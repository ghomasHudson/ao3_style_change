Dean looks at Castiel quizzically, to which Castiel shrugs. Dean then looks at Sam. “I mean I’m good, not sure why Cas wants to hang back but…" turning to Castiel, "if you’re not up for the hunt today that’s fine. You do plenty for us Cas, take a break if need be.”
Castiel finds himself back where he was as if what happened in the field wasn’t even real, pressed shoulder to shoulder with Dean on the bed watching tv, talking about random things. Dean’s changed it to something else that Castiel doesn’t recognize but he’s beginning to think that Dean changed it to something less interesting so that it serves more like background noise. Dean is currently talking about his guitar because Castiel asked about it.
?!” Dean shouts, interrupting Castiel. Castiel is taken aback causing him to struggle for the right things to say.
This time the hand he is strumming with slides down the strings for the last note and just falls against his lap as Dean stares at the floor, not moving for a while. Castiel wonders what he is thinking. He senses Dean is sad, the air in the room was thick with an ache. But why? Perhaps he is thinking of Lisa. Castiel is aware that he cared for her. But a sound that wrenches Castiel out of his thoughts reminds him that he is in the doorway behind Dean. He hears Dean sniffling and sees him wipe his hand down his face. Is Dean crying? All Castiel wants to do at this moment is hold Dean, but he knows Dean wouldn't be okay with that so he doesn’t. Dean moves finally to reach for the whiskey he has sat beside him, downs it and pours more. Castiel wonders if Dean would still drink as heavily, if at all, if they were together. If Dean knew just how much Castiel loved him. Would it be enough? Enough to cover up all the guilt and doubt that Dean feels. Enough to finally give Dean some peace. Would Dean even be able to accept it?
Raising his beer bottle pointedly, Dean responded, “Well, takes years and years of practice but give it some time and beer will go down like water” while at the same time Sam shot him a doubtful look, “Barely felt it? Dude, you were full on wasted.”
He took one of the rings out of the box, gingerly as though it was the most precious of treasures and held it up. Then he gestured to Dean’s hand. “Come on then.”
He’d said all of this casually, but something in the older man’s stance quickly dispels the good mood Dean had been in just a few moments before. “Sir, is it…?”
“Thanks for today, Dean,” he murmured just before he fell into unconsciousness. “You’re the best.” And for all the weird things that the actor’s chest had done in the last twelve hours,
actually been listening the day that Cas got caught up on a rant about agricultural practices, even if the actor had made loud, obnoxious snoring noises through most of it.
“Pick up, pick up!” Dean demands, jiggling his leg so that it brushes the keys sticking out of his ignition.
Dean felt only a half-second of hesitation, but even that was enough to raise his annoyance with Lisa more. She’d admitted that he and Cas hadn’t stepped over any lines. He shouldn’t have to change his behavior based on her conspiracy theory. Besides, it’s not like she could accuse him of anything when they had two brotherly chaperones.
“Hey, compadre, I’d appreciate if you stopped checking me out. I’m not a piece of meat,” Nick announces with false offense.
“I have writer’s block,” he continued, reaching into his pocket to grab his cell. “I’ve used the ‘backspace’ button on my laptop so much that the key is starting to come loose and, on top of that, my agent, Crowley, has recently discovered WheresDeanWinchesterNow.com—so he’s trying to get me to pressure you to come to the launch for the publicity.
When Dean and Benny exit the interrogation room, Dean does him the favor of leaving behind the half-eaten chocolate bar.
Castiel reevaluated the look in Dean’s eyes. It wasn’t angry—it was almost desperate. Dean’s need to act because he didn’t have the words. There was also a new, longing feeling in Cas’s phoenix he hadn’t experienced before—or at least not this way—like the sun again, but this time, burning him from the inside out.
By the time he got to the part about how Sam had escaped out of the bathroom window—(“Somehow, the idiot lost both his phone
“Yeah, I think that has more to do with the kind of people that come on to him than the other way around. Meg? That reaper, April? Kinda took the lead.”
“How is he?” he questioned first thing—only to have another notification pop up, saying that “Dean Winchester is requesting to join the meeting.” His heart rate shot up so dizzyingly fast, it could be mistaken for altitude sickness.
smell was already so familiar—and soothing to the nerves that had been building in his stomach the last half hour.
he got lost. It was so predictable that he’s surprised the weatherman didn’t announce it was going to happen when he turned on his TV that morning. Equally predictable is that after he took a left, another left, backtracked because he
“Yes, right,” Dean repeats, feeling the tips of his ears going pink. “And when Hannah wanted to shove an angel blade through me and grill me like a kabob, you picked me over your army.”
Castiel pauses to consider that. He’s met a few psychics, but he’s never been close enough to one to really know how their powers work. Plus, he suspects, like all enhancements, that it varies by the individual. Regardless, the confidence in Sam’s voice—and emanating off him in steady pulses, like heartbeats—makes Castiel inclined to believe him. It doesn’t make him any less scared though.
Castiel had been against the idea of any traditional action-style sequences in the movie to begin with; there weren’t any in the book. However, he knew and had accepted that a lot of the moviegoing audience found them ‘cool’. Judging by the way Sam looked at Jessica, blonde curls eagerly trying to escape the long braid she had put her hair in, he was among them.
It’s a weird feeling—having a room in Sam’s and Dean’s house rather than the other way around. Having Dean make breakfasts and do the laundry—with, get this,
Even though Cas has stayed with them on hundreds of cases, there’s no doubt that the motel feels a little cramped now that there are three men who need to shower, brush their teeth, and sleep in the same space instead of two. Sam will admit, he’s gotten off pretty easily though. Even if Cas and Dean are both tall guys, they still don’t take up as much bed space as Sam, so it makes sense for them to bunk together.
Cas clears his throat. “All that is to say, you did all the exact right things to make me rebel. However, if the angel I was on September 20, 2008 finds out who I have become now—without going on that journey? He won’t understand it. He’ll think I am a disgrace like Lucifer. He might even send himself for reconditioning if he feared he was becoming too close to you.”
not on the menu,” Aaron mutters under his breath, either not seeing or not caring the way Castiel scowls.
I close my eyes. The blackness behind my closed lids seems to teem with unseen colors—oil slick blues and greens and purples like my wings.
A second later, Richard came into the room from a side door. “Lisa, Ben,” he greeted, followed by a “Dean.” And maybe the actor was imagining things, but he thought that there was a harder edge to his name than usual. “You’ve been making quite a splash in the press this week, haven’t you?”
“It doesn’t have to be today. I could go with Sam if you’re busy. After all, I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you,” the angel demurred.
“And are they difficult to prepare?” Cas questioned, body language still that of someone leading a board meeting, despite the way his shirt pulled off a little more to one side, revealing his left collarbone. “I’ve been trying to make an effort lately not to just order in or eat microwave dinners all the time.”
Palm trees extended beyond what he could see through the window; groups of people in brightly colored shorts and sunglasses strolled by—faster than Baby could go at the moment—occasionally stopping in the middle of the sidewalk to take selfies of something they deemed important. Tour groups, Castiel would wager.
Talking with his hands the way he is causes Dean’s fingers to brush Cas’s hair—something Jack definitely notices. His forehead wrinkles in concentration, “I thought that was just what close friends did.”
And as he heard the wheels turn a little faster in Gabriel’s head the longer that he kept on talking, Castiel almost felt bad for the Brit. Almost.
stay there,” the man purred, adjusting his cufflinks as he stepped under one of the swinging metal lights. “I was talking about this one, of course,” the agent told Cas’s mother, indicating Dean. He offered her his hand. “Name’s Crowley.”
And yet, as if the book has a memory of its own, it opens up to the next marked section when he tries to set it on the desk and his eyes skim the page automatically.
But Dean seemed to have worked himself up. “Look, I don’t exactly go around advertising. But my friends know that… I’m bi, OK?” The actor swallowed, thickly. “I mean, I lean more towards chicks. But, yeah, I’m perfectly cool with guys doing—whatever.”
Cas had often been told by Gabriel that he looked like he had a metal rod shoved up his ass into his spine because of how straight he sat. But
. After a second, Lisa’s voice joined in. Neither of them had a particularly amazing range or anything, but you didn’t need that for singing softly to your kid, who was still young enough to think they were the coolest things ever.
“When you and I started hooking up—I figured it was like any of the other dates I’d been on. A bit of company, a bit of fun, but that was it. I didn’t need another man in my life—not when I had Ben to focus on.
“Well…” Dean started, in the same voice that he used when trying to convince Castiel to have ice cream for dinner. “Why don’t you try working on your other thing? The sequel to your fantasy novel? The plotline for that sounded pretty awesome.”
yet. When he finds out, he’s probably going to want to tell his story in his own time. “OK, thanks, Gabriel,” he says instead, indicating to Benny he should hang up.
“Yeah, but someone reported her making things float in the supermarket and they—came and got her. Bobby eventually found the place she’d been kept, but… She didn’t make it past childbirth. Her or the baby.”
“Apologies. Could you repeat that?” Castiel asked, eyes refocusing on the picture on his screen and then away.
He ducked around the corner, drifting closer to the smell of the dumpster. That’s one of the things people had never told him about being a celebrity. You spent a lot of time hanging around dumpsters, searching for a bit of privacy.
Castiel stared at a pool of grease that lingered in one of his pieces of pepperoni. “I fear if it comes to that, I won’t have much of a choice.”
But even if Cas wanted to, he couldn’t spend forever watching him nap. So, rather than give himself time to think about what he was about to do, he fit his hand to Dean’s shoulder and shook him awake.
“Fine,” the author grit out at last—because what excuse could he give?—before turning so his back was fully to Dean. A hundred different possibilities played behind his closed eyes, very few of which turned out well for him.
Castiel was jolted out of the memory by the first words that Dean had spoken in several minutes. “What’s that look about?” the actor asked, pointing vaguely in the direction of Cas’s mouth. “Figured that with the papps at your door and Crowley and everything, it’d take a lot to get you to smile today.”
“I’ll do it after the rest of this,” she concedes, skimming what she can find on license plate number BQT 9807 belonging to a Max Miller.
“Look, Charlie knew I was coming here. She’s been running interference, posting old pictures of me across town so that, hopefully, the papps will look there for me instead. But that’s no guarantee that someone didn’t follow me—or that there wasn’t already someone staking out this place, trying to get photos of
“Please just…go away,” I beg after another minute of silence with me walking and him following in Baby at a snail’s pace.
“It’s, uh,” Dean’s cheeks turn pink with embarrassment. “Cas only ever touches my left shoulder. Don’t think he even realizes he does it, but it’s—the one he left his handprint on when he raised me from hell. Last time he touched my right shoulder, it turned out he was possessed by Lucifer, so I just promised myself I’d pay better attention if it happened again.”
“Jesus fuckin’ Christ,” Dean grumbled, turning away from Cas like the author did earlier—less out of true annoyance than because he wanted to hide the blush on his face. Castiel wrapped his arms around him from behind. A few seconds passed in silence. And then—
“Dean,” Sam murmured, arranged like the world’s most awkward coatrack in the corner. “I think she’s right. I mean, you’ve said before that Cas was easier to talk to about—certain things.”
And I figure that even if I did have a woman in the future, there’s no way she would cause my breath to catch every damn time I saw her the way Baby does.
This time, I’m looking at my own face, glancing between me—or I guess, Castiel—and the bursting lightbulbs.
Castiel vaguely remembers the dark-haired doctor mentioning something about going to The Roadhouse during early morning rounds. Emphasis on the
Castiel’s mind skittered, knowing she was right to be skeptical. “I also have some funds saved up from the job I had over the semester.”
Dean tries not to squirm in the sudden silence. When Cas does talk, he starts off slowly. “A few hours ago, you were concerned that everything I did or said was going to be colored by my affections for you. But now, you’re upset because I chose
Just for that, Cas was going to write that Michael grew a beard because he knew that Dean didn’t like them.
Jody sighs, “Yeah, he stopped by a couple of times. The first time was to see Jack—the second and third time he just chewed us out.”
15 minutes later, they’ve commandeered the left-hand side of a table meant for six. Dean convinced Cas to get a burger, too, on the basis that he’d eat whatever Cas didn’t—but judging by the way that the dark-haired man’s going to town on his sandwich, he figures that they probably should’ve gotten three.
“I know it’s none of my business. It’s just—I’ve been thinking about soulmates a lot lately,” he made himself say, heart lodged next to his Adam’s apple.
The civil war among his kind is…draining to say the least. There is a very real possibility that he will fail, that Raphael will win, and the Apocalypse that Dean and Sam gave so much to stop will be put into motion anyway. He needs moments to not be a leader of his people—to not be decisive or strong—to, if anything, be very, very weak. And while he used to spend time gathering his thoughts in an autistic man’s afterlife—ever since he met Dean Winchester, he has to admit that he prefers Earth to Heaven.
For some reason, that seems to ease Cas’s embarrassment, rather than add to it. “Dean, I rebuilt your body from molecules. I am intimately aware of what you look like—or at least what you looked like eight years ago.”
And yet, as soon as they step out of the lobby headed back towards the car, Sam has to ask, “Are you sure about this? You and Cas don’t want to be alone…?”
Cas believed he had been getting better at reading people’s expressions lately—but how was he supposed to interpret
The actor hesitated again—a question clearly on his lips—but Cas put his hands over Dean’s, encouraging him to push the fabric down—over the vee of his hipbones—then lower. The material caught partway down, hanging on his erection like a towel on a hook—until Dean pulled the waistband wider. Cas’s cock jerked as soon as it was no longer confined.
Sam can’t help but choke out a laugh, causing both men to turn toward him suddenly, hands dripping with soap and water. Dean feels his cheeks heat up. “Pizza?” Sam offers, lifting up the boxes in his hands and shaking them slightly.
Castiel preferred Meat Lovers’ actually, but “I don’t see why my choice in toppings should upset you. It’s not like I would be forcing you to eat it.”
Dean hears people talking around him—knows that some of them sound worried—but his mind keeps resetting itself, jumping backward in time like a broken record.
With a jolt, Castiel realized that Dean was right—that they’d fallen into an easy conversation and companionable silence together in spite of how anxiously he’d left the audition. He tried his hardest not to let that change now. “I don’t have a problem with Balthazar,” he said, slowly. “He actually reminds me a lot of my cousin. However, the attention—it’s not what I’m used to.” He supposed, in his best-case scenario—where the book and movie were both successful—the eyes on him would only get worse. Of course, being an author would never be as high-profile as being an actor. He glanced at Dean. “Did you…get used to it?”
His foot had squeaked on the polished floor and the man had turned, raising his gun in steady hands until he’d seen Jimmy’s face.
Sam shrugs. “I mean, I can see it? Especially around the eyes. But I really don’t think they’re that much alike.”
Dean whispers Cas’s name and nods toward the opening. Cas points at him and raises his eyes. Dean knows it means Cas intends for him to go up alone. Except to turn his head, he hasn’t moved, watching the thing walk farther away from them. Now that he’s not close to boiling, Dean’s curiosity piques. He wants to see for himself what’s going on, what’s caused the change in the air.
“Ignore him. They have terrible food where he’s from. He can’t help himself. Do you like spicy stuff?”
“It’s just a coat,” Castiel said and pulled his hand free, wiping the blood from Dean’s cheek. He had no more grace to give; it hadn’t regenerated yet, and the lack of it had made him weak. His body was shaking, which Dean took for nerves. Maybe they were.
. His choices were his, as was this life, this body, the pieces of the past returning to him bit by bit. And Dean.
? Sammy?” Dean shakes the radio but the screen’s dead. “Dammit, batteries took a crap. Cas, you feel anything?”
Dean runs into the gas station alone and comes out with a thirty-six pack and a bag of beef jerky, a buffalo chicken wrap from the refrigerated case, a pint of Cherries Garcia, and a couple of candy bars that were near the checkout.
If he’d lived with Dean and his brother in the past, “friend” was probably the correct word, though it felt wrong coming out. He frowned.
Dean’s expression softened. He crumpled the empty cup in his hand and drew in a breath. “Then talk to me over dinner.”
Castiel could infer what Dean didn’t say, that there was nothing formally tying them together. It was an out.
“No,” the man had cried, his voice dark and deep. Like smoke, Jimmy couldn’t cling to it. The man had breathed that word into the air and it was gone as suddenly as the life in his eyes, which flickered and went dead.
Castiel opened his mouth and drew it into his lungs. The grace entered him like a thousand butterflies, overloading his senses, flowing through every part of his body. Overhead, the lights shattered and he passed out.
“It’s the only way to purify them,” Sam says, rejoining them at the table. “It’ll be respectful, I promise. We’re only interested in helping them move along. You said Joseph didn’t die inside of the hill. Do you know where he’s buried?”
“Oh. Here, just like in the diagrams.” Sam pointed to a spot on her neck below her ear and tore open the alcohol pad to clean her skin.
“What did you make?” Dean said from the doorway. He was leaning against it with his hands in his pockets. He hadn’t come inside.
Dean looks carefully at the skin around Cas’s eyes and on his forehead. He tries to remember the way Cas looked—the way they both looked—all those years ago when Cas nearly ripped the roof off of a barn. He supposes Cas has changed, though it’s not like Dean has a photograph to prove it. They’ve never been the types for sentiment. A part of him regrets that there’s nothing to show of the relationship. If something happened to either one of them, the other would be left with only memories, but he doesn’t need anything else and he doesn’t think Cas does either. Even so…
“Our time on Earth won’t be our only time together.” Castiel needed to believe that or he wouldn’t be able to go through with this. He put a hand to Dean’s face and kissed him. “I love you. You don’t know what a miracle that is: that I could meet you, that I could learn to feel like this.”
Castiel is brought back to the room by a whimper Dean lets out. Castiel notices Dean has passed out. He must be dreaming now and seems to be crying in his dreams as well.  The thought of Dean constantly upset and alone rips Castiel apart but what can he do? Dean isn’t interested in him like that, he's sure. Dean has never been with a man as long as Castiel has known him...why would Castiel be an exception? Castiel debates visiting Dean’s dream, it’s really eating at him to know what’s going on with the man he loves and he really just wants to help. Against his better judgement Castiel decides to do it and he regrets it immediately.
This chapter has smut. Extremely brief mention of suicidal ideation but nothing at all graphic, a passing thought referring to the last chapter.
“I admit I did have a specific creation in mind when I said it,” Castiel says quickly as his mind raced to find a way out of this. While he wants nothing more than to give into all of this, Dean is pretty drunk so he’s unsure if it’s right to even entertain and the last thing he wants is when Dean does sober up for him to be pissed at him. “So, do you normally have a fascination with space or did Star Wars bring this out of you?” Castiel says trying to be nonchalant as he turns his gaze to the sky. Effectively missing the disappointment on Dean’s face as he mimics the move.
“Your beard rubbed me and it’s...nice. That guy before was baby faced, s’new. Feels like...a man.” Dean says continuing to nuzzle into Castiel slowly bringing the rest of his body closer and curling into him as his ears burn from admitting something so embarrassing, something so...not straight.
“Take you like a drug, I taste you on my tongue. You ask me what I’m thinking about. I tell you that I’m thinking about whatever you’re thinking about. Tell me something that I’ll forget and you might have to tell me again. It’s crazy what you do for a friend.”
He thinks. He looks down as Dean starts tugging on his pant leg and asks “So why aren’t you in some PJ’s or something? This isn’t comfortable.”
keeps repeating in Castiel’s mind. Does Dean consider Lisa a friend? Surely he thought he’d consider her a lover...even if he let her go after having Castiel wipe her and Ben’s memories of Dean. Dean deeply cared for them. Just seems like a strange way to label that. Castiel watches as Dean practices this part of the song until he seems satisfied with it. Then he starts on the next part.
“Dean... I hear you. But you’re not in the right headspace right now. You can’t possibly believe that I’m only saying these things to bed you? Doing all of this because I want to use your body? Logically, if that’s what I was looking for then I would do what you normally do and find random people. You do understand the difference right?” Castiel looks at Dean incredulously.
Instead, Castiel goes to a pond where he and Dean have had a few heart to hearts. Castiel comes here when he's feeling lost. It somehow helps him to remember things Dean has told him, things that he doesn't get to hear very often from the man he loves. Castiel begins to contemplate recent events. He often finds himself debating whether he should just tell Dean how he feels so that he can properly take care of Dean, the way he so clearly needs him to. Or if he should just repress it and let Dean make the first move, if Dean feels the same. Castiel really believes Dean loves him but he also knows Dean so it really makes him wonder sometimes. Dean is a martyr, he has some internalized homophobia, and he knows Dean's life has been so drenched in toxicity that he can't even express himself unless he is dying, literally. With a heavy sigh Castiel decides to repress it as he always does, he doesn't want to add to Dean's problems. Castiel would also prefer to love Dean the way he has been for years versus facing rejection and losing Dean all together.
Dean lets out a short, hollow laugh and continues with, “It’s crazy too because here I am everyday all bent out of shape over my father yet if he knew...if he knew about you he’d straight up disown me. Hell, he’d probably kick my ass, matter of fact I know he would. What’s even worse is I’d give up someone that I mourn every single day for you. But instead I just carry on this pathetic existence I’ve created. I drink and hookup with random women trying to sate my needs and get my mind off of you but it’s never enough. Worse than that I end up pretending it’s you and half of the time here lately I can’t even go through with it. I come back to the bunker and play it off like I got laid but most of the time I back out unable to fuck. What kind of man am I? Nothing man about that shit, and that’s exactly what my dad would say.”
It’s all that Castiel can focus on. Then Dean snaps at his silence, misreading it as Castiel agreeing to what he’d just said or at the very least not having anything to combat it with.
“Okay Cas, you don’t have to sit here and butter me up or lie to me, I was literally trying to fuck you already, we’re past that,” Dean says as he shoots Castiel a look accompanied with his hands on his hips and an eye roll.
Castiel sighs and debates on whether he should stay or not while looking at Dean's back rising and falling as he breathes. He wishes that he could convey the comfort that he finds in seeing that simple involuntary process, in knowing that his human is alive. He decides to stick around for safety's sake and lays in his own bed. He closes his eyes and tries to meditate as he often does when Dean sleeps.
“I don’t know I kinda want to look at real stars..” Dean mumbles as he starts for the door. Castiel gets up and follows Dean. Once in the parking lot Dean gets frustrated that he can’t really see the stars due to light pollution. “Well that sucks, can’t really see them.”
Castiel can’t help but wonder what exactly Dean meant by that. Shaken from that Castiel notices Dean lays on the ground, propping his head up in his hands as he kicks back and looks at Castiel, nodding trying to get him to join him. Castiel does, with a reasonable amount of space between them. He looks at the stars his father created, laying on the ground, next to a human his father created with so much burden and pain. A human that Castiel can’t help but love, against what heaven expects of him. To Castiel, it seems wildly unfathomable that a star could awe him more than this deeply complex human and how that human thinks himself so insignificant in the grand scheme of it all. While thinking about this Castiel feels his arm closest to Dean warming, turning his view to see that Dean has slid closer to him, now their arms are pressed together. Dean is still looking up at the sky like nothing changed. Castiel supposes this is harmless and looks back at the sky when Dean breaks the silence.
“I kinda had the idea from our fight that you did obviously. But I want you to know that I do too. I’m sorry I’m an ass all the time. I just…” Dean trails off for a minute then it seems like his mood shifts completely, “well enough of that let’s go back to the motel and hang out some more that was fun.” Dean says as he tries to get up so enthusiastically that it causes him to fall back on the ground and laugh before he tries to get up again. Castiel’s heart is simultaneously soaring and sinking but he can’t do anything but ride the roller coaster with Dean so he stands up and places a hand on Dean’s shoulder as they go back to the motel.
“Dean?” Castiel asks quietly. No response. Castiel isn’t sure what he should do but he decides so far that nothing harmful is happening so he just waits to see what happens. To Castiel’s relief, Dean just snuggles up to Castiel and falls asleep. Castiel lets out a sigh and thinks about how this could’ve been the outcome of tonight if Dean wouldn’t have tried to turn things sexual. While lost in his thoughts he feels a burst of warmth coming from Dean right before Dean tightens his hold on him followed by draping his leg over Castiel’s hips. This makes Castiel smile but he worries that when Dean wakes up in the morning he’ll be upset.
“Yeah, it’s better now,” Dean says as he smiles into Castiel’s neck, nuzzling him. Dean catches some of Castiel’s stubble on his skin and that does something unexpected to Dean’s insides. “Mmm, that’s new.”
Feel free to leave any thoughts you have! I love new insight and feedback. Hopefully, you enjoy my twist on the boys' story. Thanks for reading!
Castiel's chest tightens as he tries to calm the war going on between his mind and his heart. He makes his usual choice and removes Dean's hand. Dean visibly becomes upset.
Something quickly catches his attention before he can begin to think too much about his dream. The sound of a guitar and he wonders what Dean is listening to. It doesn’t sound like Dean’s usual taste in music. Though Castiel doesn't understand the significance of music to humans this somehow seems softer, calmer than his usual rock and roll choices. Castiel could even detect a note of sadness or longing. Perhaps both. Looking at his phone he sees that it’s 3:15 am. Castiel gets up and listens while stepping very quietly towards where the music is coming from waiting for the lyrics to begin curious as to what Dean is listening to. Maybe it will give him some insight as to what is on Dean's mind. But then he is shocked by what he sees...and hears.
“But I also got you ramen, a few random candies because I wasn’t sure which you were in the mood for, sunflower seeds, jerky, and this!” Castiel says excitedly as he unveils a pie taking note of how wide Dean’s eyes go as a smile spreads across his face. Without missing a beat Dean notices a bag that Castiel didn’t unpack.
Dean comes back to the motel in a great mood to find that Castiel isn't there. When he does see Castiel again, Castiel's eagerness gets the best of him.
“No! No that wasn’t what I meant. I mean I have sex while drunk all the time, why does it matter?” Dean tries to de-escalate and it just makes Castiel exasperated.
“I need you. Please Cas, I am begging you.” Castiel yet again cannot respond as much as he wants to and feels the panic inside him rise. Castiel is desperately trying to respond to no avail. Then he wakes up.
Before Dean can say anything else, Castiel has flown them into the middle of an open field. There are stars everywhere, and everything is worth it when Castiel watches Dean’s face absolutely light up with pure unadulterated joy, bathed in the glow of the full moon.
Castiel just smiles at Dean in acknowledgment and goes to sit on the bed next to the one Dean is on and says “So were you able to find anything you wanted to watch?”
“What is?” Castiel asks, confused as he tries to ignore the way Dean’s lips are brushing over his sensitive neck. He senses arousal coming over Dean.
“Yeah, dad gave me it. I don’t really play it around anyone because I’m not that good but I like it. You know how I am about my music.” Dean says as he cheeses at Castiel because yes, he does know.
“Do you ever think about us?” Dean asks thoughtfully. Castiel’s mind races to find a way to keep this conversation from going south.
Castiel sighs heavily as he reaches for his scar on Dean's left shoulder, physical proof of their bond, and uses his grace to calm Dean. Castiel takes note that Dean's expression and body language in general has fully relaxed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean pulls back just enough to allow his tongue to trace the seam of Castiel’s lips, asking permission ironically. Castiel hesitates but decides to open up for Dean. Dean deepens the kiss and moans into Castiel’s mouth which goes straight to his dick. He tries to push Dean back but as the kiss breaks Dean sternly responds with “Cas, stop fighting this.” and Dean is on Castiel’s lips again.
Castiel stiffens as he feels the bed dip under the weight of something moving across the bed, opening his eyes he looks to the right of him to see Dean crawling over to the middle of the bed, getting under the covers as he wraps an arm around Castiel’s midsection.
Dean places a hand on the back of Castiel’s neck, sliding his hand up to card through Castiel’s hair as his other hand finds his hip helping to keep him from swaying. This leaves Castiel struggling to keep a rational mind as his feelings heighten and all his mind can do is ask for more while repeating
Nonchalantly trying his best to help Dean distract himself, Castiel decides to find a case for him to take on, after all Dean is the king of deflection. As unhealthy as it is, Dean’s habit of sacrificing himself to put others first is one of the things Castiel loves about him. He finds something that seems to be "their kind of thing" and shows it to Dean.
Perhaps not to himself...but to who? Castiel kneels down beside Dean who has rolled onto his back now. His eyes clenched shut, eyebrows knitted together. He looks like he is in pain again. Castiel decides that Dean isn’t in any sort of danger after looking him over, he’s just very drunk and upset. He decides to just stay close to make sure Dean remains safe, unsure of what he meant by the last thing he said.
“Ha, there’s no way that you don’t get tired of being pulled into my messes.” Dean turns his body so that he is propped up on an elbow facing Castiel. Castiel immediately misses Dean’s touch but finds himself in a new predicament. The way Dean shifted now has him extremely close to Castiel’s face and slightly over him. Assumingly Dean is so drunk he’s unable to realize this.
“I feel like I should warn you… just because it wasn’t real this time, doesn’t mean… The bigger of a name you get, the greater chances are that your dad—your
“You’re a bit young to be Jody Mills,” Dean tacks on, referring to the head of the Wayward orphanage, who was supposed to meet him five minutes ago to answer a few questions and introduce him to Jack.
“Sorry if she was giving you a hard time,” the woman who must be Jody murmurs. “She lost her dad to cancer a few years ago and  I think Castiel reminds her of him. She’s taken it harder than I expected.”
But he’d been invited to the actor’s house originally to provide insight into Michael’s character—it wasn’t necessarily because Dean wanted to spend time with him. Charlie had then encouraged their next interaction. And Sam had suggested this outing. Maybe, Dean didn’t
It was amazing how quickly Dean dropped his fake outrage. He stood up straighter but brought his shoulders in. His eyes darted to the ground, and the tips of his ears burned. “Man, it’s just potatoes,” he mumbled.
At least in his mind, the sensation she was describing seemed like a good thing. “For what it’s worth… I think you’d be very well-suited for it,” he said instead, which was just as honest. “Will you hear back soon?”
Castiel navigated his character (Yes, he chose the Red Hood) through the hole in the wall Charlie—aka Supergirl—just created with her laser vision. “He’s going out with a friend that came to town unexpectedly.”
Dean huffs but accepts my redirection. “People still don’t assume we’re gay for each other, right?” he asks, stepping around me toward the heavy fake-wood door.
As he strangles a high note, adding to the headache behind my eyeballs, I casually mention to Bobby that I might reroute on the way home to see a friend.
“Dean,” Cays says, earnestly. “I’m sorry if I made things awkward. But, after everything we’ve shared this evening, I—I would be upset if we started avoiding each other again.”
got him to mention his thing with Rhonda Hurley of the pink satin panties. And yet, when he caught himself last minute, she’d smoothly transitioned the conversation away rather than going in for the kill—so as much as she scared him occasionally, there was mutual respect there.
Dean almost starts to say something dismissive—but then he remembers what it was like after Sam left for Stanford—when Dad was pretty much all he had at times.
“Yes, Dean,” Sam says, still chuckling while picking up his slice. “I know you’re more of an ‘acts of service’ kind of guy rather than a ‘words of affirmation’ type.”
"In the distance he could see Sears Tower, where he once stood on the 110th floor, feeling almost celestially tall as he watched the oblivious people shuffling on the sidewalk below." - Due to the setting, I couldn't use the Chrysler building, but this was still a little hint about Cas's true form being that large, referenced in "Family Matters" (6x7)
Don’t go back to the bunker. There’s cameras set up everywhere—sending live feed—but when I checked the control room, all it’s showing is looped footage. Plus, I did some follow up on that psychic whose box you just popped—Magda. Seems like she never made it to California. If I had to guess? The British Men of Letters have been keeping an eye on you.”
“Wow…” he said when he had regained equilibrium. “Um, Cas, I hate to break it to you, but no… this is not…
have been expecting this question. But, for some reason, he’d imagined it coming from Charlie—someone who didn’t live in the same house as Dean and Lisa, seeing first-hand how happy they were together and why Cas’s fantasy could never be reality. “I enjoy being Dean’s friend. Being a part of his life is more than enough,” he responded slowly—but truthfully.
“To be honest?” Gabriel huffs. “I think he wants the company, but he just doesn’t find that many people interesting. He doesn’t get the point of gossip or small talk. As a teenager, someone would bring up the weather, and he would tell them about the different kinds of clouds there are or what some shit-old religion believed about how to summon rain—only to realize that the person just wanted him to say, ‘Yeah, it sucks outside’.”
Castiel breathed through his nose, his tongue fluttering against a vein on the underside of Dean’s cock. Remembering something he’d read on the internet, he molded his mouth as if he were going to say the word “purple” and—
Eventually, Dean came to the right wall, where he paused between two white French doors like Vana White waiting to activate letters on
Cas samples the air with a little bit more restraint before his eyes narrow with annoyance. “Truth spell, Sam?”
It was one of the things Dean liked the most about her. She got annoyed, yeah—like when he wasn’t “sensitive” enough to her friend that was going through a divorce or the time he told her that her red-carpet hair looked like a poodle’s—but that was about it.
And Cas—Cas should be worried about that—about the sounds they were making and the very thin walls and the neighbors who already disliked him. But Dean went from kissing him long and intense and deep to finding a spot on his neck that made him move up the bed, towards and away from the sensation at the same time—and he
Cas catches brief glimpses of the man himself all morning: wheeling a laughing Krissy through the hospital in her wheelchair, charming the woman who brings around patients’ Jell-O cups, signing the cast of a little boy with square-rimmed glasses. But for the most part, he’s busy picking up the slack for his fellow interns who, he’ll admit when Michael isn’t around, are a bit distracted.
A few minutes later, the door opened, and a handsome, stocky man matching the photo on Hannah’s tablet strolled in. “Larry!” he greeted the director enthusiastically, the movement tossing his shoulder-length hair like a shampoo ad.
Eventually, though, Meg turned to him, wiping the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. “I ever tell you about my parents?”
thing Castiel didn’t particularly like about seeing Dean act—how lifelike his injuries appeared. So, he tried to distract himself from the sight by turning on the small TV set up in the corner of the room.
Dean’s eyes narrow where they meet his in the rearview mirror, his own distrust rising the more Castiel voices his concerns. It’s ridiculous, Castiel decides, glaring right back. He’s spent however long passed out in the back of their strange vehicle.
Charlie took a deep breath, like the kind you took before diving into a pool or stepping out onto a stage. Dean tried not to copy her.
“And? What was angel Castiel like?” Dean asked, sarcasm layered over what sounded like genuine curiosity in his voice.
He thought in the other man’s direction, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion—until Dean tilted his head significantly towards the top of the stairs. More specifically, towards the woman standing there, lit from behind.
“We’re going. Now,” Dean insists after clearing the tab with the bartender, hooking one hand under his dad’s armpit and hauling him from his stool, quickly remembering John still has a lot of muscle to him. Ignoring his muttered curses, they eventually make it out to Baby, Dean shoving John towards the shotgun seat.
“Uh, yeah, gonna pass,” I say, ignoring my other self’s glare and Sam’s horrified expression all at once. “Can we get four beers and four Fireballs? Please,” I tack on for good measure.
“You’re not trying to lift with the spatula really. You’re trying to flip it in place,” Dean instructed Cas on his third attempt, coming behind the other man. He hadn’t been lying before when he said Cas smelled fine. A bit like sweat, but also like fresh-cut grass, and even more strangely, like the Impala. “Imagine it like… turning over a page in a book real fast,” he added.
It was… strange to be close enough to see every freckle on Dean’s nose, the curl of his long eyelashes. It was… definitely not conducive to listening to Dean's question.
as 1900, even though it was released in 1899, just because he wanted his book to be a herald for the new century?”
The ceiling is also different than what he’s used to—bumpy, like acne—and he stares at it, regretting sleeping so much in the car since it has made him wide awake now. Or maybe he’s wide awake because
He feels the angel lean closer to him and he instinctively presses his head as far back into the pillow as it will go to get away from the scrutiny.
“For angels, reinventing themselves is even more difficult. We’ve had thousands, if not millions of years, existing exactly as we are—being told that the only way to do things is the way they’ve always been done. The very idea of evolution—even in a strictly metaphorical sense—is something we all instinctively fear.
Or maybe he was just sad, he didn’t know. Earlier, he’d thought of himself as an echo. He’d forgotten that for pain to have an echo, it must first be very, very loud.
Castiel does roll his eyes, then. “Considering what’s going on out there, I’m guessing both of you are used to throwing a punch on occasion. I’m giving you my consent.”
“Dude,” Dean said, once the Brit had wandered out of earshot. “If you wanted him to fuck off, you coulda just said you don’t swing that way or something.” He handed Cas a pretzel but then proceeded to tear the top off for himself.
“When I wake up, well I hope I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be the man who’s waking up to you. And when I’m dreaming, well I know I’m gonna dream. I’m gonna dream about the time I had with you… shit!”
“I haven’t had a hug in a while…” Dean suggests nervously. “Mom had a way of wrapping me in her arms and just pressing all my broken pieces back together.” Dean laughs hollowly as his eyes start to get watery. “Where’s my beer?” he asks sniffling, clearly turning to the next best thing. Castiel’s heart begins to really ache for Dean. And he can also sense that Dean is longing for him more so than usual suddenly.
How do y'all think Dean is going to react in the morning? We got some fluff in there finally! I didn't want to make it too unrealistically sweet but I just wish we got to see them happier in the show. :c
“Uh, I don’t know Dean..” Castiel trails off as he thinks about all the possibilities of this being a bad idea.
Then Dean just falls onto his back on the mattress dramatically. “I don’t know Cas I want to have some fun.” Dean starts to sit up to grab something out of the snacks that Castiel brought for him. Castiel is glued to where he is, his heart racing.
“Yeah, you already told me that.” Dean pouts, looking up at Castiel still not leaving his lap. Huffing as he crosses his arms across his chest really making himself look rather innocent and upset, which does something for Castiel he'd rather not think too hard about given the proximity of Dean's face to his junk.
He was already pretty out of it before that—his eyes losing focus for minutes at a time before snapping back to Dean’s with a jolt. Dean wondered if he could feel it—whatever ‘it’ soulmates were made of— without Dean having to tell him. But that question would have to wait hours, if not days—and he supposed that it wasn’t the worst thing in the world if the guy just found him pretty.
“Hey--” Dean argues, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. “You are a lot more than just hunting. So, what if you told them a fake job or gave them a false reason for your daddy issues? Those details aren’t the stuff they fell for. They liked the person your experiences made you. Period.”
In his mind’s eye, Dean made an expression Cas had never seen on him before: he bit his lip, uncertainly. “I guess I can’t really say ‘no’ when you put it like that.”
"The agent... preferred to go by his middle name, Crowley."  - Crowley mentioned to Bobby that his vessel was "a moderately successful literary agent out of New York" in "The Devil You Know" (5x20)
—that’s when the problem goes find a fuck buddy and makes a whole litter of other problems. I mean, wasn’t that how your whole soulmark mess turned out?”
He quickly discovered that it didn’t work at this angle—not without having to contort his wrist to a ridiculous extent—and Dean gave out a snorting laugh.
They chatted for a few more minutes—making promises to video chat regularly—before Charlie begged off to go find Dorothy.
“My car,” Dean explained, his chest puffing up with obvious pride. “A 1967 Chevy Impala. Restored her myself.”
Using his arms to push off Dean’s bed, Cas removes the trench, suit jacket, and loosens his tie slightly; Dean has a sudden desire to take it off and put it on backward—you know, just for old time’s sake.
Castiel frowned at the phone. “You’re always telling me that I should be the one deciding what I want for my life and that anyone who thinks they know better should go screw themselves.”

Chapter 13: "Castiel sat on top of the closed toilet lid, scrolling through his phone. The photo he was looking for was several years old, but—at last, he found it—the selfie he’d taken of his soulmark back when he’d first learned the truth."
“Look,” Dean sighed, addressing Castiel directly for the first time since the reading. “I don’t know what kind of game this dick is playing—because it’s clearly
Dean clears his throat as he approaches. “What seems to be the problem here?” he asks with a polite smile.
Regardless, it’s clear that Cas doesn’t want to elaborate and Dean isn’t going to make him—not when whatever happened is probably his fault to begin with.
reason that Castiel wasn’t yelling at him in the middle of IKEA right now. “I hope you know how incredibly hypocritical you’re being,” he growled at him. “You get so mad when people claim that bisexuals must be more inclined to cheating because they can’t be satisfied by one partner for long. And you’re right to be that angry. Because you know as well as I do that if you love someone, it doesn’t matter how many other options are available.”
“Dean?” he asks with overwhelming hope in his voice. Then he takes in Bobby beside me and tilts his head to the side. “Oh. You’re not…you. Not now you, anyway.”
Sam obviously doesn’t buy it and God, Dean’s seen his face crumple like that before as a kid—usually, right after Dean told him that they couldn’t afford to send him on the classroom fieldtrip or that they couldn’t keep the stray dog he found—and each time, Dean swore to himself that it was the last time he’d disappoint his brother like that.
Only a few hours ago, Castiel had been relieved when he came clean about his insecurities. But those were
Dean put his arm around her, easily, like they did this every day. They probably did. “He’ll get over it,” the actor promised, making it sound like the simplest thing in the world.
“Uggghnghgg” is the first thing I hear when I regain consciousness. Maybe I was the one who said it. It’s hard to know when the pounding in my brain is so loud.
Appointment in Samarra - Season 6, Episode 11: Sam wants to stop Dean from restoring his soul -- and plans to kill Bobby to do it.
“I don’t understand,” Jack says fifteen minutes later when Chelsea starts dating Mr. Bland Handsome Doctor Guy.
Of course, he could have thought he was covering up for Dean—who felt even less capable of speaking than at that July 4
“If it’s so easy,” the youngest Winchester continues, twisting his back to look at his brother. “Why don’t you answer it first, Dean?”
“Dean…” Cas rumbles back, his voice more of a question—and yet, whatever he sees makes him brave enough to fit his hand against Dean’s left shoulder, long fingers splayed. A light shiver runs over his brother’s body.
if Sam hadn’t arranged his schedule to have Fridays off so that he could spend a couple of weekends every month back in L.A.
And once the actor started talking about the pranks that he and Sam used to play on each other, Castiel
An idea comes to me. It’s a stupid risk—but as long as I choose carefully, it may make him feel better without revealing anything he’d find uncomfortable.
“Fine, fine,” Nick says, jabbing his index finger into Cas’s photo right between his eyes. “Yeah, I know him. A loser who’s trying to get his sense of self-importance from having
devastated. But he’s already got an emptiness in him from what happened with his mom and if the hole Cas leaves behind joins with the one she left, he’s never going to be himself again.
Lisa had said because she wanted to know if she and Matt had something real—if they were going to last.
“Fine…,” Dean smiles through his teeth. “One last question. Where were you Monday evening into Tuesday morning?”
Castiel squinted at him, as if to see him better. “Should I be concerned about how happy you sound about that?”
weird about it. At first,” he admitted, and Cas felt his arms lock tight at his sides. “I mean, he already knew Lisa and I broke up—and it didn’t really seem to bug him because… Lisa and I are both still there at home with him, doing all the same stuff together. Well,” he conceded when Castiel raised an eyebrow. “Not
“Castiel,” Anna tries again, talking through her teeth this time. “Are you really going to pretend we didn’t just all find out that your—your
Cas paused outside the door to the Dean Cave. He’d tried knocking. No response. Eventually, Sam pushed him forward—a silent entreaty to go in anyway. So, taking a deep breath, he did.
“My point is that the papps already have pictures of us rubbing shoulders or whatever, so… stop freaking out, okay? If you act like we’re doing something wrong, it’s only gonna look more suspicious if someone
“Okay, well, we already know who she is, so if we work together—” Sam suggests, his enthusiasm dimmed but still clearly there beneath the surface.
“Patrol?” Dean says, with raised eyebrows. “Why does that sound like a new code word for ‘watch over you’?”
The breath that Dean let out when he realized it was his turn to speak was shallow—thin—and then his throat seemed to close shut entirely.
people learn to let it go. I just ain’t there yet. But….” Dean took his hands back as if to force Castiel to maintain eye contact. “I don’t know, Man… I feel like you go around collecting all these facts about everything in the world. About history and bees and blue boobies…” Castiel glared at him “…which are definitely not funny at all.
“Just need to get a rhythm is all,” the slightly taller man winked, hands falling to Cas’s waist as he encouraged them to jump together.
Castiel could just picture Dean staring at Benny. Then, the defeated moment when his shoulders slumped, as he gave out a half-groan, half-growl. “It’s not like I enjoyed… putting it out there. Nearly had a damn heart attack in that interview. But a lot less people came for me than I thought they would. And it didn’t cost me any jobs or anything. I mean, an actor coming out… I’m practically part of a trend at this point. Nothing to get worked up about.”
Dean rested his hands on either side of the sink, face turned to the window. He wondered what kind of moon was out tonight and where it ranked on Cas’s list of favorites.
Cas didn’t take that as an insult. Rather, he saw it as a sign that neither of them entered into their relationship naively.
Dean finally got the shirt over his head, even though the feel of damp fabric kinda drove him insane. “The way Cas tells it, you’re a douche but a
Cas looked down at his hands. His skin, especially the lines of his palms, was dyed a translucent red and there were squiggles of ground beef still clinging to them like slugs. “Dean, what happens now?” he asked the actor, who was laying the hamburger patties they just finished shaping into one of Cas’s seldom-used pans with a
—but… What do you want me to say?” Dean asked, tugging at the neckline of his Henley, his voice walking the razor-thin edge between aggressive and defensive. “I like sex, okay? So… if you gave me a list, I might not be hitting the ‘Check All’ box, but I…” his shoulders inched toward his neck just slightly, making himself smaller. “I’ve… tried a lot of stuff.”
That’s not to say Sam and Cas aren’t family. They hang out together all the time, share eye rolls when Dean’s not paying attention, and have each other’s backs no matter what. But they don’t share the same kind of ‘profound bond’ Dean and Cas do. Which is probably part of why they never fight.
“Okaaaay…” the future hunter draws the word out like it’s damn string cheese. “And you’re feeling—what?—sentimental?”
“‘Sammy’ is perfectly fine,” Sam points out, ignoring the way Dean glares at him from behind Cas’s shoulder.
“We talked about this, Bud,” Dean turned away from the counter to scrub the child’s hair. “Even Batman has to change outta the Batsuit sometime. Otherwise, people would figure out his secret identity.”
Dean grunted an acknowledgment, turning back to his food. He held his sandwich with both pinkies out. “Is this fancier?”
,” she insisted—and he realized, belatedly, that it might have sounded like he was insulted on his character’s behalf when he was only curious. “But Dean and I decided not to do any more projects together once we wrapped

supposed to be the person that you feel like you can talk to the most. And you haven’t been.” He took a deep breath, let it out again. “To be fair, though, I haven’t either. I think…” he considered Dean, all of his revelations from earlier distilled down to one point. “I think that day that I read about you and Lisa getting married, and you came over to correct my assumption… something changed between us.”
“Oh, right. You can always just say I have great taste in cars and music. Two freebies right there.”
He looked at Cas. “You ever think about reaching out—for real? …Before the universe decided to throw us into the same trash compactor and squeeze us together?”
He feels the hollowness of this victory. Even looking out at the same playground Cas is seeing and knowing that he saved them all, he feels more separated from them than the angel is. Part of him thinks of them as actors on a screen—false visions planted behind his closed eyelids—a glimpse of the sun that Alastair will rip away, laughing at him for ever believing it was real.
“Well, that and I’m allergic. To cats, at least.” The author chose not to process the slight twinge of disappointment he felt at that. - Dean had a cat allergy in "Man's Best Friend With Benefits" (8x15) Also, just a general reference to Cas saying, "Do we need a cat? Doesn't this house feel one species short?" in "Survival of the Fittest" (7x23)
It’s approaching morning when we dump the car on the road next to a forest. Other Me insists we walk the rest of the way—since he actually lives in this town and doesn’t want to call the wrong attention to his home. He’d said that so casually: “home.”
Ben was seated on the black leather couch that Dean—and Cas—were prone to taking naps on, his tongue stuck out in concentration as he played a video game on the TV.
By contrast, the acting stuff—it’d never been something he’d ever wanted for himself—until, one day, it just fell into his lap.
That’s why he’s instantly on alert when the chair a few seats down from him is suddenly filled with—Dean hurriedly takes a second glance—a really hot guy.
There was a link to an article attached, but Castiel ignored it in favor of reading Charlie’s only remaining text message—which was actually the first one that she sent.
Probably smart of him. Dean doesn’t even know what he’s feeling half of the time—besides hungry and Cas probably wouldn’t count that as an emotion. “So…what? Skip it?” he asks.
Many of the follow-up inquiries were also fairly easy to answer—questions about his writing process, his favorite authors, if there had been any significant ‘deleted scenes’ from the book—up until—“There’s a rumor going around about a movie starring Dean Winchester as Michael,” spoke a balding, dark-haired man, pen poised over a notepad.
“Well, I’m not. Cas, do ya think that you can heal this cut I got?” Dean requests, folding his dress sleeve up to reveal a freshly bleeding mark. Where did he even
Instantly, Dean’s expression changes from joking to concerned, which is pretty much the opposite of the reaction Sam expected him to have. “Well, steal Sammy’s almond milk next time.”
“That implies that we’re playing a game, and we’re not,” Castiel chided but still gave the matter some thought. A minute passed.
The next time his friends bring up Dean Winchester, Castiel’s not surprised. The actor’s name has been all over the news—so, of course, it would also be brought up in their locker room as they all get ready for morning rounds.
“So, what—we’re just magically fixed now?” Dean asked, still as skeptical. “You’ve been mad about the Marv thing for—almost a month? And now we talked for ten minutes and that’s all gone…?”
Dean nodded absently, perhaps nervously, as he finally disentangled them to flip the burgers. “So, here’s the thing,” he said, clearing his throat. “I’m not—moving out. And that's not about Lisa, it's—”
And yet, in spite of that rough start, lunch is pretty nice, actually. Cas and Sam get into a discussion about which popular superstitions have a real basis—everything from broken mirrors to spilled milk.
“I’ll take a leak,” Ben agreed, only somewhat reluctantly, before sliding out of the seat. Dean made sure to keep an eye on the bathroom door as he dialed.
“Sorry, boy. But you just got outta Hell and I ain’t kept my eye on you every minute since then. I’m not sure if you’re you or he’s you.”
“I have to be there. At your memory exchange parties. I get you don’t want me to be, but it’s the only way,” I tell him flat-out. “Because I know how your mind works and you’re going paint yourself in the worst possible light without even trying.
He actually falls asleep at one point, clutching his bottle of Jack like it’s a baby. When he wakes up an hour later, he’s certainly not hungover, but his thoughts do have a slight protective wool coating over them.
Still, even if a part of him wished he could go back to his apartment right now, he and Dean had never actually gotten around to discussing Michael, so the author obediently followed the actor to something dubbed “the Dean Cave.”

All too soon, however, his musings were cut short by Balthazar’s return. The self-proclaimed Frenchman remained standing, but leaned over Castiel’s desk from the other side, once again drawing emphasis to the very low cut of his V-neck shirt. Castiel wondered if he often lost food down it when he took lunch.
Dean snorts. “God has many issues with us, lady. Our living arrangements ain’t one of ‘em,” he says and then, to my utter surprise, he grabs my hand. “Isn’t that right, angel?”
“Oh, awesome!” Dean exclaimed, as the spikes of his hair came dangerously close to brushing the ceiling. He locked his legs upon landing, trying to stop himself from bouncing back up, but he wound up sprawled across his back on the bed instead.
curious why she thought you would want to be visited by your past. Or why she picked that particular moment in time to steal them from. Without Sam even?” Cas’s eyebrows pull together in what counts as a frown for him.
My stomach growls like a garbage disposal. It’s ass o’clock in the morning, which means I haven’t eaten for almost fifteen hours. And it seems stupid to just sit here, listening to it, when I could do something about it, so…
Castiel wonders, even if he can’t imagine Dean engaging in platonic cuddles like this. Or maybe he misses someone from back home or his past?
Eventually, he shoves some pants at Cas, figuring they had to start somewhere, and wonders where the hell Dean got off to.
stitch them up because they’d already bled out. Now, hate is probably too far away for her to reach. She’s distant inside—her old personality only bobbing to the surface in isolated moments that are so brief, sometimes Castiel is the only one to notice. “She can also make you feel so drugged, you can’t stand for hours—so I suggest you show her some respect.”
love and affection play in your life?” He sounds like one of those infomercials that play at 3 in the morning asking you to donate money to some online church.
From his perspective, probably—but she only manages a smile when he laughs. He wouldn’t believe her if she told him what was really out there. After all, she hadn’t.
“I recently moved here,” Castiel admitted after a moment’s pause, figuring that it was a safe enough detail to share with a stranger.
"For the return trip, they’d switched tapes, and now Christian Kane’s House Rules played..." - Christian Kane played Lee Webb in "Last Call" (15x7)
It’s weird reading what he thought back then. For example, his feelings for Lisa were both more and less than what he remembers them being. The book will describe her playing catcher for Ben while Dean tossed baseballs or stroking Dean’s hair while they watched a movie together and he realizes he was damn lucky that someone like her gave him a chance at all—let alone a second and a third.
“You’re in a delicate emotional state right now, which is why I’m going to excuse that question. I know
“Morning!” Dean greets him, deftly sliding pancakes onto a plate that already has half a dozen sausage links on it. “Your breakfast is over there,” he says, pointing to a spinach omelet that he has made slightly less gross by completing covering it in cheese.
Was it, honestly, then just trying to make people happy? That seemed strange when tragedy struck the world daily.
and beautiful and—get this—she draws, but she’s ambidextrous, so she can start from two different sides of the paper at once—”
“I’m not saying you didn’t have a legitimate reason to be annoyed at me,” Dean inserted quickly. “And, hell, I’m glad someone here is calling me out on my crap—but you’ve been doing this—” Dean made the same headache-soothing motion Castiel had been performing a few minutes ago—“all morning, even when I had my trap shut, so I figured I’d ask.”
Sarah stood in the darkly lit library that the characters had just broken into. Artificial night lingered beyond the set’s fake window.
The Impala finds me a half an hour later, which isn’t much of a surprise, but does make me wish violently that I had my wings back. Dean’s head pops out of the driver’s side window, “Dude! What was that?”
Contrary to some people’s (Gabriel’s) opinion, he didn’t run from all confrontation with his mother. He defended his friends—the ones she knew about—whenever she made disparaging comments. They often came to a head politically, too. But speaking in his own defense ultimately felt too exhausting.
Cas tugs on his tie and flashes a smile, “I believe ‘giant ants’ came up once or twice for some reason.”
“Why didn’t we have him carry her in again?” 2008 Dean says, probably remembering the way he huffed and puffed getting her into the bunker.
“I worry that if he learns—or even suspects—the nature of our current relationship, he will actively try to take a different path.”
The actor rolled his head in Cas’s direction. “You still up for this?” he echoed his question from an hour ago, motioning between the two of them. The car key was still in his hand rather than in the ignition.
Castiel didn’t have any other words besides, “…Thank you.” And then, because it was true, he added, “I do choose you. Every day.”
Dean tugged at the neck of his shirt. He was used to being under studio lights, but they were still a goddamn pain, and the uncertainty rolling around in his stomach reminded him of being sixteen again. “Don’t know. Seemed like the time, I guess.”
Dean turned to get a look at Cas. Part of the author was probably hoping his mother’s last-minute appearance was a good sign—but it was clear that most of him was freaking out. Well, Dean could at least do this
He whirls around to find Dean in the doorway, also looking amazingly like his normal self. Except that he then walks around the counter and
” Castiel marveled when he got a better glimpse of the cart. “Dean, this is enough food for approximately half a dozen people,” he argued, even though the smell of some sort of beef dish was
With that in mind, he takes a breath, figuring he should at least go first. “You know how much I hate the whole destiny schtick. But even before you guys decided to write Sam and me into the Bible, I sorta felt like I didn’t have a lot of choice anyway. I mean, what was I gonna do?
“It’s changing, it’s growing. It’s learning to see Baby the way you see her and coming to value Ben and Sam
Once that’s taken care of, he surreptitiously sniffs himself and yeah, he definitely needs a shower. It’s as he’s coming out on a puff of steam, a towel wrapped around his waist, that he notices that his dorm room is a complete mess. Of course, by the time he finishes cleaning it up, he needs to shower again. Then, somehow, he gets super sweaty when he’s at the store stocking up on snacks until he figures, what the hell, third time’s the charm, so he showers
“So, what?” my future self continues, this time addressing Crowley. “You guys just happened to show up on our doorstep at the same time?”
Cas pauses only a moment. “I suppose I have also taken comfort in the fact that their place in your lives is mostly fleeting. They will not be the person you count on to back you up on a hunt or choose to confide in about your worries. You take a lot of people into your bed. You don’t take many people into your family and I recognize the privilege of that.”
His father’s not going to get off so easily. “Dad,” he hisses at John’s voicemail the second he’s out of the lab. “You call me as soon as you get this. I’m not playing around.”
) and the time he lost his shit over the sheer number of different kinds of Reese’s peanut butter cups available (
“Dean, you moved my piece, not yours,” Cas points out, gesturing towards the Monopoly board laid out in front of them.
I let the quiet sit there, but when it stretches out for another minute, I decide that’s probably my cue to leave. I nod my head and turn, but Dean’s voice stops me with my hand on the doorknob.
Sam resolutely turned away from where Dean looked like he’d been hit in the face with a waffle iron.
“No, we should be the ones to—uh…. We’re just gonna talk in our room,” Dean tells his brother, rising as well.
“Oh, right.” Dean’s eyes bounce across the room as if he’s going to find the answer on the walls somewhere, instead of right in front of him.
Luke, Han, and Leia are in a trash compactor about to be crushed to death when their pizza arrives, prompting them to sit even closer together so that any errant pepperoni that falls off their slices will fall back into the box.
biggest lie is ‘fine.’” The actor scowled, waving down at the ground. “They’re not giving you this much grief when I’m not around, are they?”
The dining room was homey by contrast—the ceilings lower with lots of natural light coming from the big picture window on one end and a big, hotel-style buffet laid out on the large mahogany table. Now, in Dean’s opinion, food should mostly be brown, ranging from the ‘golden’ brown of pies and pancakes to the darker brown of steak, burgers, brownies, and potatoes. The Sampson’s spread included way too many colors—starting with the million and one kinds of fruit and ending with a platter of avocado toast. Ben wrinkled his nose for the both of them. Guess this was a napkin day after all.
Cas jolted, as Dean’s mouth was suddenly on him too. And he wanted to gasp out an apology, except Dean seemed to welcome the involuntary rut of Cas’s hips—bobbing his head short and shallow and then longer and deeper, echoing every one of Cas’s groans with a moan of his own and—
loud enough that he thinks he’s going to have to get hearing aids a couple of years earlier than he would have otherwise.
you for having enjoyed your life as you saw fit. I’m merely trying to gather information so that I can make informed choices. If it helps, you can… see it as a form of foreplay. People talk about sexual preferences as a way of… setting the mood, right?”
“Had I not sold my book, I would have been headed up to Stanford to start Med school in a couple of months.”
Of course, not. We’re—Dean’s playing Michael in the movie. And we started talking and one thing led to another…”
Dean has also found that Brady did originally go to Stanford to get revenge on Sam for John Winchester killing his father--but became weirdly obsessed with him upon meeting. As a result, in addition to continuing A. Zazael's habit of killing people with angel soulmarks, he's also killed several people that he thought had an interest in Sam (Jessica Moore, for example). This is not necessarily the same as people that Sam has had a relationship with. Dean has yet to tell Sam this.
“I can understand why you might have some hard feelings, Sam,” the man—Mick—says calmingly. “My colleagues behaved abhorrently and against orders when it came to you. They were only supposed to reach out to see what information you and your brother and your--” his eyes flicker over to Cas for just an instant “allies would

about to erupt—and if we don’t figure out what they’re really up to, we’re going to be caught with our pants down and no bug spray.”
Dean’s a tall man. It wasn’t so obvious when he was next to Sam, but he is… tall and broad-shouldered. And the confines of their two-bed motel room quickly become too small for him. He paces; he does stuff on his computer. After showing them the TV remote, he kicks Castiel over to share a bed with Hannah and Samandriel and takes quick naps. Then, he wakes up and paces again.
decided to prank the toilets at his school. So, there’s the slightest chance that I’m taking out some of that frustration on you.”
“I mean, of course you would be,” he sounded like he was talking to himself. “You found out your boyfriend is a piece of chickenshit. But Cas… It’s not… I know I’m
“And yet…” the angel sighs. Dean’s life is full of “And yet”s. “Even though you stopped Samhain, the seal was broken, and we are one step closer to hell on earth, for all creation. Now, that’s not an expression, Dean,” And the hunter wonders if he should start a drinking game of how many times the angel says his name. “You, of all people, should appreciate what that means.”
So far, three middle-aged, good-looking guys have all been found dead of heart attacks in hotel rooms across the city. They’d been caught with their pants down, literally—so their working theory is a succubus. “This guy’s name is Arthur Handon. Married, two kids. Traveling sales rep.”
He shrugged his arm off her shoulder. “Yeah, fine,” he murmured, but he was looking at Sam and Jess again and the fact that they seemed so in sync now took on a slightly creepy edge.
“Dude,” Dean exclaimed. “You’re not supposed to use the stuff I tell you in confidence against me. If you didn’t notice, I’m trying to be all sentimental and shit.”
Dean turns to Sam—throws his arms up in the air exasperatedly. “You want to revise that crazy statement?”
Dean’s throat bobbed like a fishing lure in his throat, and Castiel wanted to reach out and touch his arm, but he didn’t. He was surprised when Dean took a step closer to him instead. “And there’s always been other stuff that bugged me, too,” the actor added. “What if Ben needs to go to the hospital while Lisa’s in Italy for a shoot or something? I mean, yeah, she’s his mom—and she should be making medical decisions for him—but what if I’m
Those long hands fist into his shirt and tug him closer—and when they kiss, it’s like being caught in a thunderstorm. The kind that makes you want to dance until you’re soaked and throw your head back and drink it all in.
“Yeah?” Dean asked with raised eyebrows, shuffling chopped potatoes off to the side. “Sammy’s just about to start at the law school up there. Wants to become a medical malpractice lawyer.”
I knew—I was a good writer. I was sure that, even if the book wasn’t a bestseller, that it would be fairly easy to get it published.
If Dean was going to continue to keep choking on nothing, Castiel was going to insist that he go to see a doctor.
Benny snorted. “‘Course I do. The whole world thinks you’re pretty. They’re trying to make you ‘Sexiest Man Alive.’ Just don’t let your boy hear you talkin’ to me like that.”
The game of something’s-going-on-here-but-we’re-not-talking-about-it escalates quickly. First, it’s Cas mentioning that he can’t see the screen properly and asking Dean to adjust the angle of the laptop. Of course, this obscures
To be honest, he didn’t really know why he’d come out here. He could’ve done this just as well in his room but this seemed more fitting. Don’t tell Sam, but Dean did like chick flicks and the occasional dramatic moment and this felt like it ought to be one.
So he’d bitten the bullet and actually bought himself a bar. With the golden ticket credit card and counterfeit documents of course – hey, he was legally dead and probably still wanted by the FBI after all – but it was still his most priced possession. After Baby, naturally, Dean quickly added and blew a kiss out the window next to the door where he could see the Impala’s impeccable paint job gleaming in the sun in her assigned parking spot.
until he heard Sam hurrying down the metal staircase through the thin wood of his door, each step accompanied by a resounding
“Jesus, Cas. I could’ve killed Chuck. You know I’ve never had faith in any God and especially not in this one. He went and proved me right. I’ve been wanting to kill that son of a bitch for years but when it came down to it, I didn’t. I didn’t because you said I ain’t that person. And when you said that? I believed you.”
Turning off the lights and shutting the door to the bunker the last time had been difficult. Dean’s heart ached a little at leaving behind the first home he’d ever really known. The memories they’d made here were special but with that thought he’d also realized the memories weren’t going anywhere. They would always be with him and now he was about to go make new, even better ones. This in mind, it had been easy to lock the door behind him with a smile.
Castiel didn’t look up from where he was sitting on the bed, one of Dean’s favourite books on his lap. “I’m fine, Dean.”
After that, Dean left the two to catch up, feeling a bit like intruding on a conversation as he knew they’d had struck up a friendship back when Kelly was pregnant. So once again he sat at the bar when the door behind the counter burst open.
“Quite the turnout, huh?” Somehow Dean had ended up next to his brother without noticing. Looking up and seeing Sam with Eileen hanging off his arm, the heavy weight disappeared for a second. He was genuinely happy for Sam. Seeing the way he’d reacted when they got to Eileen’s house and found her phone and bag on the floor – Dean didn’t know how to get the heartbroken look off his brother’s face and that had terrified him. But now here they both were, smiling widely at him.
“Dean, Sam and Eileen are back and they’ve brought food.” That last word always peaked his interest so Dean opened his eyes slowly and stretched his arms above his head. Well, one arm. The other was still attached to Castiel’s fingers. Who still sat in the uncomfortable chair, his unoccupied hand holding a phone. That’s probably how he knew there was dinner ready without leaving the room.
Or that time we got called on an evil Santa. That stuff just doesn’t happen. I mean, it actually doesn’t, it was some Pagan douchebags, but still.
Dean stumbled into the kitchen with a yawn rubbing his eyes, clad in a Zeppelin shirt that had seen better days, his dead guy robe and of course, the hot dog pants he was so fond of.
“I can, Jack, and I have. There’s so much bad in this world and after all we’ve been through? Everything you’ve done for us? How could I
He didn’t need to imagine how that would have felt. He’d lived it before and it was anything but pleasant.
The angel let himself be pulled into Dean’s side again, pouting and muttering something about that son of a bitch not belonging in Heaven all the while.
Dean chuckled softly, staring into the glass that had magically been filled with amber liquid again. Or maybe it was just Jo moving like a ninja. “I did. Cas and me, we’ve sat outside, blankets, some hot chocolate, the whole nine yards. And we’ve watched it, Mildred. We’ve watched the sunset and it was beautiful.” He stole a look at his angel where he laughed at something Kelly said. “It was beautiful.”
The only thing that had really changed was their moods. Where once both had been prone to grumpiness and frustration, a lot of anger in Dean’s case, now they were exchanging fond smiles and soft lingering touches. They seemed to always be touching in some way. Fingers intertwined, hands on waists, arms around shoulders. It was almost as though they both needed to make sure the other was still there, reassuring themselves that the days of being abandoned were over for good.
Dean raised his hands in surrender, slipping down under the covers but hesitated before he got too comfortable. He chewed on his lip as he began in a low voice, “Can you – I mean, obviously you don’t have to but I would probably – and you still have your room of course, you’ll always have that but – I’m just…” Dean realized he was rambling – badly, too – when Castiel squinted his eyes at him, confusion all over his face. So he took a deep breath. “Could you maybe … Could you stay here? Just for tonight. I need … I just gotta make sure you’re real. And that you won’t disappear again.” His voice had turned into a whisper as he spoke, picking at threads in the blanket to avoid Castiel’s eyes.
He swiped at the screen and yelled “What?” in a voice hoarse from crying before the phone was even pushed to his ear.
There was a nasty piece of rebar sticking out of a wooden post behind him – Dean had noticed the shine of the dim overhead lamp reflecting off of the metal when they’d first walked in looking for the kids – and the vampire was pushing him straight towards it.
Sam made a thoughtful sound into his mug. “So that’s what it meant when he told Jack that he’d ‘made it loud.’”
Taking a shallow breath Dean scrunched up his face, tried to push the memory out of his mind but to no avail. He didn’t want to hear the words again but Castiel’s whole monologue had burned itself into Dean’s brain, so deep that no amount of alcohol would ever get it out of there. Not that that would stop him from trying. Hard. He gulped down another mouthful of scotch.
Dean turned his unbelieving face to Castiel and tapped him on the chest with the back of his hand a few times. “We’re gonna be uncles!”
It had also come directly out of Mildred Baker’s storage. They’d had a grand time sifting through dresses upon dresses, some more modest, some straight from the stage performances Mildred had enjoyed in her youth.
“So what’s all this then?” Sam asked when he came back from his shower, still dripping a little from his hair. Dean sighed annoyed and pulled a book away from where the water drops had fallen on the cover.
