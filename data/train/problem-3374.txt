Of course the game is ridiculously one-sided.  No matter where Castiel tries to aim the puck, Dean is there to stop it.  Dean knows he is toying with Cas but the look of pure concentration on his face is worth it.  Castiel’s stick-handling actually isn’t all that awful, but it’s no match for Dean.  Finally, he starts to laugh until Castiel skates straight for him before slamming on the breaks and spraying him with ice, stopping directly in front of him.
“No, Dean. This is hurting you and I just want to understand why.”
“Jesus, Crowley, we’re not making a chick flick here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can’t do it… love the smell of paper books too much.  So, what’s the last good thing you read?”
He puts his hand against the doorframe and leans closer to Castiel.  “Cas, I…”
Sam huffed in exasperation, “We aren’t in competition.  We don’t want any publicity, just to help.”
Castiel was a mess. He couldn’t understand where things had gone so wrong with Dean. He had tried to fix it. He called Dean but he wouldn’t answer. He left messages and texted, all of which were ignored. He even tried going to Dean’s apartment but he wasn’t there and he wouldn’t bombard the man at his place of work. It didn’t seem possible that the man whom he had fallen in love with could be so stubborn over one argument.
“Hey, Dean, is everything OK?”
“I don’t know.”
It’s two weeks later and Dean comes to see him almost every day, always bringing some new thing for his home. A throw rug that keeps his feet from freezing when he gets out of bed, a clock so he will be on time for his new job, a soft old quilt that he said is pretty girly but Ellen had insisted once she heard all he had was a sleeping bag. They eat together - Castiel is becoming pretty good at cooking in his little toaster oven - or they watch movies, but his favorite is when they lay on his mattress together on their sides, facing one another and just talking. It's on one of these days that he finally tells Dean his real name through tears that are kissed away. Dean says he likes Cas better than Jimmy anyway and it’s good that he left that life behind or they never would have met.

He couldn’t believe that he had been so wrong about what he had with Dean. Sure, Dean had never
Sam invites the women to sit and have a drink with them and, when they agree, Dean immediately gets up to go find two more chairs.  The ladies sit on either side of him as he signals for a waiter to order a round of drinks.
The music was soft and sultry and soon the dancers began to get caught up in the mood of the song and the feel of their lover in their arms. Somewhere along the line Dean stopped counting steps in his head and let his body relax to just react to Castiel. And it was beautiful and fun and intimate and passionate. Castiel threaded his left hand along Dean’s neck into his hair and drew their bodies so close that their cheeks were touching and Dean hummed in approval.
“Supernatural fandom,” she answered casually.  “So it’s true?  He’s dead?  What happened?”
"I don't get it. If he likes girls then wouldn't it be easier to just stick with them? Why even… y'know with guys?"
Dean gives Lucifer a nonchalant shrug, “You think being filleted by you scares me? I spent 30 years being your minion’s chew toy; even learned a few tricks myself.”
Castiel chuckles, “Something like that.”
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel responds with a soft smile.
Dean slumps onto the bench after a grueling shift on the ice.  He wipes down his sweat covered face and takes a long drink of water, spitting half of it back out.  Shifting his eyes up to the scoreboard he wonders how they got here.  It’s about half way through the third period and the score is tied at 4-4.
Becky looks a bit bored with the technical hockey talk and unsurprisingly, changes the topic, “Our readers would really like to know about you as brothers.  Tell me, are you close?”
“Castiel Krushnic,” the woman asks, “Was that Dean Winchester I just saw you talking to?”
“Mmmm, I love this song,” Castiel whispered in his lover’s ear, “dance with me, Dean?”
“Tonight’s your lucky night.  You wanted to see what it’s like to do what we do?  Well tonight you are going to get your chance.  Drop Cas off here at the Pine Meadows Motel off if I-75 and go get dressed for digging and bring shovels back with you.”  And with a click Dean was gone.
The actress squeezed Sam’s hand and gave him a weak thank you before they left her room.
The three sit anxiously side by side, Castiel in the middle, flanked on either side by his manager and coach.  And when the scores are finally read, Castiel nods.  He is neither disappointed or surprised.  He scored high marks for his elements, landing the jumps and completing the required moves correctly.  However, he isn’t surprised to see his grade of execution score lower than it has been in the past.  He just didn’t feel any passion or excitement for the routine.  It felt just that – routine. It felt empty, like it was missing something important that was just beyond Castiel’s grasp.
“Oh hell no!” Dean exclaims to the incredulous look on Castiel’s face.
“I was thinking more along the lines of Men in Tights… and almost as gay,” Sam laughs at his own joke.
“Your secret’s safe with me,” he whispers conspiratorially.
“Snowboarding, that’s cool,” Sam says excitedly.  “I definitely want to check out some half-pipe while I’m here.”
He was now desperate for Cas, he couldn’t remember a time in his life that he wanted to make love to anyone so badly. And when Cas rubbed the palm of his hand down Dean’s erection it felt like heaven. The two men immediately began a rushed effort to get their pants off and blend together skin touching skin.
He sat now, ready to permanently close a chapter of his life and begin a new one with the woman he loved. He was nervous. Jess was wonderful and supportive and she and Dean had this great connection. He didn’t know what he would have done if those two hadn’t hit it off. They both meant so much to him. Dean can be a tough person to really know. Oh, everyone that met Dean liked him right away. He was fun and flirty and he charmed most everyone. But he let almost no one in past that mask he wore all the time. But Jess was able to see past it and he had seen her get through to Dean about things he used to only share with Sam.
“Yeah, I want you to stay… with us… with
Sam smiled and put his hand on his brother’s shoulder. “I sincerely doubt you are gay, probably bi. I mean you are mostly attracted to girls with just a few exceptions, right? Sounds like you are pretty low on the Kinsey scale.”
“Drowning your sorrows?” Castiel heard a low voice beside him say.  He looked over and found that he was sitting next to a handsome man with green eyes.
“I’m OK!” Sam yelled back and turned to Harry to retrieve a weapon but it was too late.  Ed, Harry, Maggie, Castiel and Nick had all scattered like roaches through the various doors back into the hallway.
Cas groaned and rolled out of bed, shuffling to the bathroom for a quick clean up. He put his hands on his hips and stretched out his back, feeling the warm burn through his lower back and legs that was a delicious reminder of the night before. He brushed his teeth and splashed water on his face before pulling on a pair of jeans and a soft hoodie, knowing it may be cool and breezy at the pre-dawn shore and shuffled over to Dean, who was standing there with a cup of coffee and a smile, looking ridiculously handsome for this time of the morning.
“I really am sorry about what happened.  I had no idea.”
He glides to the center of the ice, takes his pose and a deep breath and blocks out everything but the mechanics of the next two minutes and fifty seconds that are planned out to the precise second.
Sam, of course, misunderstands. “Dean, we aren’t going to let Amara do anything to you. We’ll find another way.”
The only hockey terminology here is the chapter title of slashing.  In hockey it's kind of what it sounds like, slashing someone with your stick.  But what Dean Cas fic would be complete without a little fandom slashing of our own?
Dean sighed and rubbed a hand over his face.  OK, so teaching a former Angel of the Lord how to play poker may not have been his best plan.  Luckily, they were saved from the game by an incoming call from Charlie.
He hangs up and texts Crowley back:
“Right, the spell would only have worked if Castiel was in love with a human.”
“Cas, it’s too much. I don’t - ”
“Well, that’s just cheating. Now I’m gonna have to find your turn-ons so we’re even,” Dean grinned down at Cas mischievously. “Hmmm… maybe this?”  Dean whispered onto Cas’ cheek as he swirled a finger around Cas’ nipple, causing the angel to arch his back and suck in a breath as Dean chuckled at his friend’s reaction.
Dean was the first to lose patience, “Charlie, what’s going on?”
“I don’t think I
Sam passes a puck to Victor but Dean jumps in and intercepts the pass, laughing at his teammate’s surprise at his unexpected move.  Sam catches on quickly and chases down his brother to try to steal the puck back but Dean is fast, skates around behind the net, and sinks a wrap-around goal.
She was once again the picture of perfection and classic beauty. This time she was in a tailored dress that looked like she just stepped out of a 1950s fashion magazine. Her hair was again pulled up and she was still wearing that blood red lipstick Dean noticed as she flashed a dazzling smile.
“Dean Winchester,” she purred eyeing him up and down with a flick of her long lashes, “I have heard about you. Josie Abaddon.” She extended her hand with the palm facing down and fingers splayed out. Wait, what? That isn’t a handshake pose it is a kiss-my-hand pose. Dean almost looked around for a hidden camera. This had to be a joke. He extended his hand to hers and clapped it into a firm handshake. Sorry, not kissing hands!
A hand grabs him on the shoulder and pulls him away.  It’s Bobby, with the EMTs right behind him.  Dean reluctantly moves away from Castiel so that they can do their work.  He skates off to the side to watch as they work on the man.  It seems like forever.  They wrap him up with a neck brace to immobilize him when Sam skates up to Dean’s side and tells him that they should leave.  Bobby has cancelled the rest of practice and everyone is heading back to the locker room.
“Do we have to do this now?”
Castiel turns the engine over and pulls out of the garage, heading north towards that quiet woods in Canada where he will once again pray for the guidance of a father who isn’t listening from the secluded park bench surrounded by thawing snow and early spring flowers.
“Archive section,” the librarian pointed to her left, “check in the…” she paused as she finally looked up and whispered a soft, “Oh.”  When she took in Castiel, her demeanor immediately changed.  She offered him a broad smile and bit her bottom lip, looking up at him through her eyelashes.  “Why don’t I just… show you myself?”
Dean clenches his hand into a fist.  It itches to punch the smug look off Gordon’s face.  But instead he takes a deep breath and proceeds slowly, “Listen, man, I saw that game.  It was a fair hit.”
He is lost in his thoughts until a warm ungloved hand lightly snakes its way over his thigh.  He looks down at Cas’ hand, admiring the long graceful fingers as they inch slowly up his leg.  Biting down on the groan that tries to escape his throat, he chances a glance at Cas, who has about the best poker face he’s ever seen.  Seriously, the guy is staring straight ahead with an expression so stoic that no one would ever guess the sinful things his hands are doing in the back seat.  Good thing too, because the taxi driver picks that moment to look in the rear view mirror and start up a conversation.
“I need… Dean, please hold on. I’m going to give you what’s left of my grace.”
“Touche,” Dean laughs. “And speaking of school, I’ve got to get you home.” Turning to Castiel he adds, “Brainiac here is in AP everything so as much fun as it’s been hanging out with you, Cas, this one’s probably got like five books to read tonight.”
How did humans manage all of these emotions every day?  He had never realized just how connected human bodies were to their emotions.  Now that he was flooded with them for the first time in his exceptionally long life, it was too much.  They drained him and confused him and he just wanted his grace back so that he could stop being so overwhelmed with all of these feelings.
Chapter Title - Thunderstruck (AC/DC)
“Well, it was added for the movie.  I mean it’s pretty implied in the books, right?  I mean the epic staring, the dying for each other, the ‘gripping you tight’, and how many times do you need to look at a guy’s mouth, really?  All kind of points to something more, don’t you think?”
"What the hell was that?!"
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
“Oh my God, Cas, you are so… ah! Fuck!”
When Castiel and Theresa had a stack of large books and a box of files piled onto the table, they began to go through them, searching for police reports of accidents on set.  After about ten minutes of searching, they were able to find the correct folder and records of two deaths.  The first was in 1957.  It was a man, a camera operator, who had fallen from a cherry picker during an overhead filming shot.
“Dean, I want you inside of me,” Castiel growled out and Dean pulled his fingers slowly out of Cas and sat up, quickly grabbing a condom and rolling it over his cock and applying more lube to himself.  He leaned forward, slotting his body perfectly over Cas’ stopping when his head was just teasing at Cas’ hole.
Dean searched frantically around for the rest of his team but couldn’t find anyone still alive. It would be up to him. He ducked behind a crumbling makeshift berm to inventory his ammunition. Damn, he was running low. He would have to collect some from the dead bodies strewn across the battleground. He dropped around the berm and low-crawled to the nearest body, trying to remember all of his combat training.
Sam stopped tying his shoes and looked up at his brother, “Then why do you want me to leave?”
“My dad would.  Bet he’d say I let him down.”
“Really?” Ed turned on her, “You read these douchenozzel’s books?”
Cas caressed and thrust and tasted and teased Dean until his mind had lost all thought outside of the immense pleasure that his lover was giving him. Cas pulled away and leaned back to take in the sight of Dean, laid out vulnerable in front of him, ass presented. And it was beautiful. This man, whom he loved also trusted him and wanted to give him everything of himself.
Dean turns to her and removes his left arm from Bela’s shoulder, snaps his finger and exclaims, “Hey, wasn’t that the year they went to the playoffs?”  Bela, who is pretty absorbed in her cell phone barely notices he is no longer paying any attention to her.
dad down, too.  He hasn’t talked to me since I came out.”
Dean chuckles a mirthless laugh, “Yeah, it would suck to fall at the wrong time, huh?”  The double meaning of his words hurt more than he cares to admit.
When he listened to Cas’ message earlier it had been a relief just hearing the man’s voice.  His morning had been absolutely terrible.  Between the bullshit with Bela and then actually coming out to his brother, Dean was ready to just get the hell away from everyone and everything.
“This one day, we got a lead on some insurgents holed up in an old factory that were recruiting boys, like 14 and 15 year olds, and teaching them to make bombs. They were going to turn these kids into suicide bombers. We were headed in and I took point and I got us inside the building when we were ambushed from behind. They killed my squad leader and injured my commo. But we got ‘em. There were just three of them. Two of them couldn’t have been 16 years old.
“Yeah, man,
Dean’s eyes snap to Castiel’s face, “Wait, you understand her because you speak every language from bumblebee to Impala? Or you… are happy hunting?” Dean doesn’t say
“No, its cool, I just don’t usually talk about it. You know, why relive shit like that? So, anyway, after that Sam was pretty freaked out. He had nightmares and got really jumpy. He found this symbol in one of his books.” Dean tapped his finger to his chest at the tattoo. “It is supposed to ward off evil. He begged me to get a tattoo of it and to let him get it too. At first I flat out refused but he wore me down and I figured if it made him feel better, what the hell? So we found some shady tattoo parlor that didn’t care too much about age. I mean he was tall for his age but he was still only like 13, all gawky and pimple faced. I still can’t believe they let him do it. So we got matching tattoos. He was a tough kid. I thought he would cry or something but he kept a straight face the whole time. So, there you have it, I am officially protected against evil.”
Dean smiled back at Cas, “You did amazing with ‘Liv. Man, that kid is crazy about you.”
“Charlie, hi.  We’re good.  How are things in… well, wherever you are these days?”  Sam greeted their mysterious friend.
Dean headed back to Melody’s dressing room and knocked on the door.  When she didn’t answer right away and he heard a soft whimper from inside the room, a lifetime of training kicked in and his spidy senses began tingling.  He reached around under his jacket for the weapon he always kept tucked in the back of his pants, taking comfort in the smooth feeling of the ivory against his fingers.  As he stretched his hand towards the doorknob, prepared to face whatever was inside, Melody opened the door sobbing.
Dean stood beside his brother at the front of the church, scanning the pews for Cas. They had come separately since Dean was obligated to be with the wedding party and it had been a busy and stressful morning. He just wanted to set eyes on Cas, who could always calm him with just a smile.
“Well, I was kind of hoping maybe you could help convince him to take the game off.”
“Oh.  Well it’s… uh… nice… to have you… I mean a nurse like you… I mean an American, not that I don’t like Russians.  It’s just the language,” Sam groans at his own mouth.  Why can’t he form a sentence?  Is it this girl? “Ugh! How hard did I hit my head?”
What would his brother think if he knew how Dean felt? Would he see Dean any differently, any less? Would he still look up to him? Would he stand by him if he ever came out and the shit hit the fan about him being the first openly bisexual player in the NHL?
grown man. You don't need to keep sacrificing for him. And I know I like to mess with him, but truthfully, he's smart and he loves you and he'll come around. I know you're willing to do just about anything for your little brother. Question is, what are you willing to do for yourself? Or Castiel?"
Dean laughs, a bitter sound, “I was taking care of Sam long before
One week later was the accident that took their father’s life and left the boys orphans.
Dean immediately pushed past her, gun raised, making sure to keep her safely behind his back as he cleared every corner of the room.  Dean then turned on Melody, “Are you OK?  Did something hurt you?”
“Meg Masters worried about someone other than herself?  What am I hearing?  I’m touched.”
Everything hurts.  When Sam comes to he is in the back of an ambulance and people are fussing over him and speaking quickly in a language he doesn’t understand.  The bright lights burn his eyes and that’s the least of his worries.  His mouth tastes like blood and he can’t move at all.  A feeling of claustrophobia hits him as he realizes he is strapped down, presumably to immobilize his neck, but still a panic bubbles up in his chest.
Dean didn’t know what to say. He felt a lump in his throat that threatened to take his manhood if he tried to make a sound. Instead he leaned over and hugged his soon-to-be-sister-in-law.
Dean reluctantly calls Crowley back, prepared for a thorough ass reaming from the douchebag.
“Oh no!  These skates aren’t leaving the ground.”
“Cas, you’re going to have to stop that now or I’m going to end up defiling your kitchen,” Dean quipped.
Dean pull’s Cas closer towards him so that he can rest his lips on the man’s forehead.  The position reminds him of way that they had woken up together this morning.  Was it really just a few hours ago?  Could his life really have changed so much in a day?  The soreness in his knuckles and face confirm that it was only yesterday that he had fought Lucifer on the ice but it somehow seems a lifetime ago.  Only 24 short hours ago Sam was fine, Dean had a made-up relationship with Bela for the media, and being with Cas was just a fantasy.  Now Sam is in the hospital, the evil combination of Bela and Crowley have it out for him, and a naked Cas is draped across him tickling his chest with soft breaths.  For better or worse, his life has officially been turned upside down.
But then Dean turned back around and stepped into Castiel’s space, “Why?”
“Dean, I don’t care that you woke me up. I just worry about these dreams. This one seemed more difficult than most.” Castiel laid his head back down onto his side so he was facing Dean, with his arm still draped across the man’s chest, pulling him close by the shoulder, trying to share his warmth and draw his partner into the safety of his arms.
They sent their swiftest messenger to put forth the challenge. Really, he was the swiftest because he was 12 years old and was willing to run to the Orc’s forest where none of the adults were willing to move that fast. Brian (aka Endor the Brave) returned breathless with a scroll in hand, running up to Charlie, who promised should he survive this battle, he would be knighted for his bravery.
“Dean, stop,” Castiel interrupts, saving Dean from further embarrassment coming out of his mouth. “Gabriel was right. I’m… it’s nice to meet you.”
“Dean?”
Castiel climbed the stairs to his apartment hating his traitorous heart. He didn’t want to fall in love with Dean Winchester. He had been hurt enough. He didn’t think he could ever fall in love again and now here he was wasting his heart on an unattainable man. Maybe he was doing it on purpose. If he only loved someone he couldn’t have, there was no risk in being loved back just to eventually lose that love. He was a little drunk and his head was fuzzy and he didn’t like where his brain was going.
“It’s nothing, Anna,” Castiel looks at his sister with pleading eyes.
“We had to come back to get our stuff.  We had left some of our equipment in a locker.  We just heard about Lance.  I thought once the body was burned the spirit would be gone?” Ed questioned the brothers.
spent a lot of time in front of mirrors.  Are you going to stand there all day?”
Dean sat in the car and tried to clear his head. The rain was coming down harder now. How fucking cliché! His mind drifted to another time he had made love to Cas in the rain. Damn it! It was so easy then. No family, no prying eyes, no questions or judgments, just him and Cas.
And then there was Bobby. Dean worried about how the gruff Midwesterner would take finding out that his surrogate son sleeping with another man. Bobby wasn’t exactly flying rainbow flags. What if he reacted the way his father had? Would he think Dean was less of a man? Bobby was family but Dean had to see him every day at work too. He didn’t know what he would do if Bobby started looking at him differently. Maybe he wouldn’t even want to be business partners any more. The idea of being rejected by Bobby terrified him more than he wanted to admit.
“Don’t worry, we don’t need keys.  Get in the passenger side.” Dean jumped into the driver’s seat and quickly slammed his hand up into the dashboard under the steering wheel to find the wires needed to hotwire the car.  In a moment, the car whirred to life and Dean was high-tailing it back to the motel.
“Well, I imagined a lot,” Dean chuckled and gave a playful nip of Cas’ ear, making the man smile. “But that didn’t come close to how great it’s been.”
Long after he leaves the arena he is still on cloud nine.  Sure, he wins games like this every week but this was his first win on his way to Olympic gold.  Maybe it’s the adrenaline, maybe he’s still high off the euphoric win, but he finds himself standing in front of Castiel’s door.  It’s a foolish thing to do but something in him just wanted to share this moment with his new friend.
Sam shrugs and gestures to the open bench beside him.
Sleep doesn’t come quickly.  He lays in his bed and for some reason the man with the blue eyes keeps coming to mind.  He shouldn’t be bothered that this one pretentious jerk hates him but it’s eating at him anyway.  Why should he care?  There are plenty of people who don’t like him, probably a few hundred thousand fans in Philly alone that are pretty pissed off this week after the shutout he handed to the Flyers last weekend.  He tells himself it doesn’t matter; that he probably won’t even run into the guy again, didn’t even get his name.
The two continue to watch the show, Dean narrating and pointing out his favorite parts of the show as well as laughing as he heckles parts that he doesn’t like.  It is fun and comfortable and Castiel is enjoying the friendly camaraderie that he and Dean are developing.  He finds that he really likes Dean’s sense of humor.  He is kind of crude and cocky but it somehow suits him.
. So if you want to blame someone for that shit I’m right here.  But you need to stow your crap with Benny for now ‘cause I want that fucking gold around my neck and it ain’t happenin’ with you two goin’ at it like a couple of teenage girls.  Got it?”
The lovely work of fanart at the end of this chapter is by casneedslove.  It wasn't made specifically for this fic but when I found it I was moved by how perfectly it fit with this chapter.  Thankfully, the artist was willing to let me share it with my readers.
Sam headed out in the Impala with Harry in tow.  He told the Ghostfacer that they would need to pretend to be FBI agents and asked if he had a suit he could change into for the interviews.  Harry said that he did back at the Ghostfacer’s headquarters, which turned out to be just the garage of a small house they were renting.
His mind still saw them as they were the last time they were together. Dean, a freckled little punk with big eyes and a heart of gold, proudly strutting around in clothes that emulated his father perfectly, that amulet that Sam was supposed to give John one Christmas hanging loosely around his neck. And little Sammy, with his big hazel eyes and floppy hair, always holding onto his big brothers hand and looking up to him as if he knew the answers to every question in the universe. He thought about the rambunctious boys whose dirty feet pounded on his hardwood floors as they ran through the house playing superheroes, fighting imaginary monsters.
Dean adds, “I think we spent more time in skating rinks than in school growing up.  We were doing skating drills and passing and shooting the puck for hours each morning before most kids were even out of bed.”
And he really loves that warm tingly feeling that rushes through his body every time Cas cures him. It used to always be the two fingers to the forehead and even that Dean tried to secretly pretend was a caress as the grace coursing through his body warmed him and gave him butterflies. He could pretend it was more because he had watched Cas cure other people and he knew that no touch was even required. Cas could do the glowy hand-hover trick and fix people up fine without any contact. Hell, that’s how Gadreel cured everyone. So Dean liked to tell himself that Cas used the forehead tap with him because he wanted to touch as much as Dean wanted to be touched. But he also knew he way lying to himself.
"Hey, Dean."
"Well, here we are," Dean said. Castiel smiled, unbuckling and stepping out into the parking lot. He followed Dean along the sidewalk to a house near the end, and Dean unlocked the door, leading Castiel inside. The house was warm in contrast with the increasingly bitter evening chill, and it smelled nice, like a rich-scented candle. Dean flicked on the lights, revealing an open-concept first floor and a bright, clean kitchen straight ahead. Dean shucked his coat and his boots, and Castiel did the same.
"You can do that?" Dean asked. Castiel chuckled as he poured coffee from the carafe.
Dean closed his eyes and continued to waltz with himself, deftly spinning around Castiel, who stood dumbstruck. After a few beats, one of Dean's eyes cracks open to look at him and he smiles.
"You should ask out Cas, too. I know you want to, and now you know he wants you to, too."
"It's your turn," Dean finally offers, and Castiel knows that it's an invitation to use their game as a distraction, but it's already clear that a simple game of chess simply cannot pull him from his wallowing.
Castiel was dumbfounded. Dean locked the portafilter in place and then paused. He turned to Castiel with a big grin. "Actually, there's something I want to show you."
"Sure thing. Do you want room for dairy?" Castiel asked. The man looked puzzled, so Castiel added, "Do you take milk? We keep it at the end of the counter."
He walked over to Castiel and held out his hand. Castiel hesitantly took it and pulled himself up off the couch. Shoving down his fears of what he might be about to find in the upstairs of the house of a man he was now realizing he barely knew, he followed Dean up the stairs to a room down the hall on the left which appeared to be Dean's office. It was warmly decorated, with a few plants, some photos of family and friends, and a large corkboard on the wall next to the computer. Dean flicked on the lights and stood next to the corkboard. Getting a better look at it, Castiel saw pieces of thick paper pinned all over it. Paper with...his handwriting. Castiel brought a hand to his mouth.
"I wouldn't call owning a successful business 'substandard'," Dean said. "What does your brother do?"
Dean starts to walk past Castiel looking completely defeated. Castiel's mind is screaming to the point that he can't understand what it was saying, so he just follows his heart instead, grabbing Dean by the shoulders and pulling him close, slotting their lips together with as much expertise as someone who has been kissed once (thirty seconds ago) can. Dean's body is frozen, but Castiel persists until finally, Dean's hands fall onto Castiel's waist and he gently, carefully moves his lips against Castiel's, as if he's afraid to startle him and ruin the moment. After a moment that feels like a lifetime, Castiel slowly pulls away, searching Dean's face for...something. Anything that might indicate how he's feeling. All he sees is slightly hooded green eyes and a hotly flushed cheeks.
Dean's face lit up and he looked at the side of the coffee cup where his name was written. "'Good luck on your date'?" he asked. Castiel smirked.
"D-Dean," Castiel stammers. Dean's eyes are wider than before and he looks terrified, an expression Castiel has never seen on his friend. Dean quickly pulls his legs out from under Castiel, sliding a few inches away.
Dean sat down and ran a hand through his hair, kicking himself internally. "Yeah I...I just brought a bunch of groceries in from the car." Castiel hummed and Dean leaned back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling. "Listen, uh..." What was he supposed to say, anyway? He thought of Sam earlier, heard his brother's words ringing in his head. You should ask out Cas. "Do you...are you busy tonight?"
"Oh, hello, Dean." Castiel sounded like he was smiling, and didn't that make Dean's stomach flutter. "Are you alright? You sound breathless."
Dean chuckled, tamping down the grinds. "I was running late one day and it was on my way to work," he explained. "Guess I liked the ambiance."
Dean rolls his eyes and smiles playfully. "Come on, it's not really winning if you forfeit."
"I don't want this night to end."
"Sam," Dean said and a chill ran through Castiel's spine. He wrote the three ominous letters and set the cup to the side, ringing the items in on the computer.
"I'm not much of a car person," Castiel said reverently, "but even I can tell this is a really nice car."
Castiel made his way to the living area, turning on the fireplace before he went to sit. Just as he was lowering himself onto the couch, he caught a glimpse of Dean in the kitchen, turning on a high-quality espresso machine.
Claire appeared from the kitchen area, tying her apron behind her back. "You? Really? With who?"
"Indeed. Just like Gabriel."
Dean accepted the cup, looking slightly crestfallen. "You, uh, give free coffee to a lot of 'cute guys'?"
Castiel flushed and pulled off his apron. "Okay, that's enough of that. Come on, Dean, let's go."
When they arrived at the Roadhouse, Castiel was starving. Dean had raved about the burgers and on ordering one, Castiel found that he was not exaggerating.
Dean smiles sadly, rubbing his thumb over Castiel's cheek and drawing his blue-eyed gaze back. "I know," he says softly before touching their foreheads and brushing their noses together. "But you'll always have me."
"Damn right you are," bartender and owner Ellen said from behind the counter. According to Dean, she and his family went way back, and he thought of her daughter Jo as a little sister.
Castiel's face softened and he smiled. "Well in that case, I'm sure you'll do fine. Sounds like you've been working really hard on it."
When they part again, Castiel's hands slide down along Dean's arms as he casts his eyes to the side. "Dean I...I'm getting married in a few days..."
"Sam, huh?" Castiel said, trying to keep the bitter iciness out of his voice. "Who's that? New girlfriend?"
The blush fought back hard and Dean punched Sam in the shoulder. "Shut up, bitch."
Then, he started coming in every few weeks, and then every week, and then every couple of days. Each time, he spoke more easily with Castiel, and even tried the seasonal latte that Castiel had recommended (he said he liked it but Castiel could tell he found it too sweet compared to his usual black coffee). Then, one day, Dean came in looking like he'd already had a dozen cups of coffee. He shakily ordered his usual and Castiel slowly pulled the cup from the stack and wrote out Dean's name.
"Have a nice day. Say 'hi' to your brother for me."
"Really? This is the dreamy guy you're always talking about?"
"It's our last hope," his father had said after describing his--well, it could really only be described as a  "plot"--to Castiel. "With your brother gone to chase skirts across Europe and your mother ill, we have no choice."
"He runs a small chain of candy stores," Castiel explained. "'Something Sweet', I don't know if you've heard of them. He sometimes sends me samples to sell at the Bean."
"What?" the man asked, looking surprised. Castiel smiled warmly.
Sam pointed at his cup and said, "I think you got a little bonus from the barista."
"I know, I'm sorry. I've been up all night and the only thing that's kept me up is about two pots of coffee. Not as good as yours though," he added with a weak chuckle. "I have this big presentation today, and I really need it to go well."
He can still remember the day that he was called to his father's office, now sparsely furnished as they had auctioned the furniture for a few extra dollars.
Dean looked surprised, which confused Castiel. Dean clarified, "Don't you think it would be a little weird for you to make me a coffee, since we're going on a...date?"
When he's finally standing, Castiel's fingers brush over his lips. They still tingle as though shocked from the unexpected contact. "Dean, I..."
Castiel nodded towards Dean, who gave a little wave. Claire's eyes widened.
"Dean..." Castiel says quietly, his voice deep and thick. Dean brings one hand up from his waist and places it on Castiel's cheek.
"Great," Castiel said. He rang up the coffee and pulled a medium paper cup from the stack. "And can I get a name?"
"Dean, is that..." Castiel said, admiring the appliance. It was almost nicer than the ones he had at the Bean. But if Dean could make excellent coffee at home... "Why do you come to the Bean if you've got something like that at home?"
"Wow," Castiel said.
They passed the rest of the drive making small talk and getting to know each other in simple ways. Castiel learned that Dean's father was a mechanic most of his life and ran an auto shop with his friend and Dean's "Uncle" Bobby. He learned that Sam was studying to be a lawyer, "But the good kind," and that his mother was a painter. Castiel told Dean about his failed attempt at following in his older sibling's footsteps and his decision to drop out of an undergraduate in medical sciences and instead take some small business courses while working as a barista. Eventually he had enough schooling, experience, and savings to open his own place and after years of barely scaping by it had become a local favourite.
Castiel straightens and, feeling a little silly, mirrors Dean's posture and attempts to move himself to the beat of the music, stumbling over himself every few bars. Dean continues to encourage him and after a few songs, he begins to feel more confident.
Castiel smiled. "That would be lovely."
For a while, Castiel didn't see Dean again.
-------
"Make yourself comfy," Dean said, gesturing towards the couches to the left of the door. "Feel free to turn on the fire place, the switch is next the mantle.
"One vegan cup of syrup with a splash of coffee," he said teasingly as Sam put the book away. His brother took the coffee and produced a bitchface.
"Tonight?"
Castiel's parents owned a very successful newspaper. He has fond memories of visiting the printing press and watching the machines mass-produce the morning paper. He can remember when his father had found out about his brother Gabriel skipping his lessons and had sentenced him to selling papers for a day, telling them if he didn't earn at least thirty cents, he would not be allowed supper. Castiel had snuck out of the house for a chance to witness Gabriel on the street corner, pathetically announcing the dull headline while the other real newsboys looked on and laughed.
"Okay, Cas, let's move around a little more." He counted them in again and Castiel began guiding Dean around the study, careful not to run into anything. He casts a glance down at their feet but Dean quickly interrupts him.
"Yeah. I was...I was gonna go out to the Roadhouse for a burger. Do you want to come? With me?" Dean slapped a hand to his forehead as quietly as possible. Smooth, Winchester.
"Ah, ah, Cas, eyes up here." Castiel's gaze flicks up and lands on Dean's sparkling green eyes and his heart begins to race again. His mind spins with concern, causing him to lose his footing and tangle his leg with Dean's, knocking them to the floor. When Castiel's mind catches up, he finds himself on top of Dean, hands splayed out on either side of his friend's head while Dean stares up at him with wide eyes. For the briefest moment, he sees a hint of colour on his friend's cheeks beneath the constellations of freckles. Castiel's chest feels tight, perhaps because he is embarrassed. For once, Dean appears to be speechless. His mind insists that he needs to get off Dean, help his friend up again, but his muscles simply won't respond. Dean isn't telling him to get off of him, either. Castiel can feel a tickling in his stomach that felt foreign and strange. Just as he's about to apologize to Dean for knocking him down, Dean surges forward, capturing Castiel's lips in a surprisingly passionate kiss. Castiel recoils, shocked. Now kneeling above Dean's legs, he feels as though his face is burning.
When Dean walked through the door, Castiel almost leapt over the counter to greet him, until he checked his watch and saw that the man was about ten minutes early. Calming his racing heart, Castiel went back to cleaning the espresso machine. There had only been a few customers here and there for the last half hour, mostly retail workers picking up dinner before their 5PM shift. Dean came up to the pickup counter, near where Castiel was working.
It had started out pretty innocently.
"I don't think you'll actually need it, though. Seems like this date of yours is quite taken with you."
Castiel felt a blush rise to his cheeks and he felt his heart pound in his chest as he tried to objectively interpret the meaning of Dean's last sentence. Castiel smiled at Dean to relieve the tension.
Castiel hugged Dean back. "Of course, Dean. You're welcome."
"Okay, now here's the tricky part," Dean says, adjusting their stance. "Keep moving to the music, but take me with you. Show me where you're going with your hand on my waist." At Castiel's terrified expression, he laughs. "Don't worry, I'll help you out this time, but you probably won't get so lucky with your bride, so focus. One, two, three, one, two, three--Ouch!" Dean winced when Castiel stepped heavily on his foot. "Right foot first, Cas...always the right foot first. Probably should have mentioned that."
"My usual," he said as Castiel pulled the cup, "and a medium vanilla soy latte, too, please."
One day, Dean threw a wrench in the whole thing.
"Order up!"
"You sure? You look pretty wired already," Castiel said. Dean ran a hand down his face.
Castiel climbed inside and sat down on the passenger side of the bench as Dean slid in the drivers side and started the engine, which revved with a gentle purr. Classic rock played softly through the old stereo and Dean pulled out onto the quiet downtown street.
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, me neither." There was another moment of silence until Dean said, "Do you want to come back to my place? I still owe you coffee."
"That's perfectly alright," Castiel said, trying to sound less excited than he was. "Would you like something to drink while you wait for my shift to finish?"
Undeterred, the two begin again, Castiel gently rocking them side to side. His confidence grows the longer he goes without hurting Dean again. Finally, Dean ups the ante.
Dean reversed out of the parking spot and got on the road back into town. They parked in a lot in front of a row of narrow but warm-looking attached houses and Dean turned off the car.
Dean downed the rest of his coffee and stood up. "Well, I've got some errands to run. It was good to see you, Sammy." He turned back and, looking at his brother, his face softened into a fond smile. "And thanks."
"This is the best burger I've ever eaten," Castiel muttered around a mouthful before diving in again. Dean laughed and picked up a fry.
"Hey, sorry I'm a little early," Dean said. He looked sheepish as he rubbed his neck. "Guess I was a little eager to get out of the house."
"I'll work extra hard on this one, then," he said, turning away with the cups. He quickly whipped up the soy latte and held Dean's cup in his hand, hesitating in front of the carafe. Before he could talk himself out of it, he quickly took the sharpie from his apron and scrawled out his phone number, just above the paper sleeve, before filling the cup and taking both drinks to Dean. He smiled as innocently as he could.
After that, it sort of became a habit, especially on the days when Dean had something important coming up. Castiel would write a little message on the cup and Dean would take it without reading the message. He wasn't sure why he did it, he didn't even know if Dean read them at all, but it was something to do and it made Castiel feel better having done it, so he continued.
Castiel sighed. "Me neither." He thought for a moment, and then added, "I haven't been on a date like this...ever. I haven't even been on a date at all in years."
"Yeah. Actually, I'll have to thank him later," Dean said cryptically and didn't elaborate. Castiel let it hang until Dean continued, "Do you have siblings?"
"Several, actually," Castiel said unenthusiastically. "Mostly doctors and lawyers now. In fact, only my brother Gabriel and I have 'substandard' jobs by my parents' standards."
His father's face had turned stone cold. "You will do what I say, Castiel. You are a part of this family, and as the future man of the house your have a responsibility to it."
"Oh, sure, it's Dean."
Understanding dawned on the man's face. "Oh, no thanks, just black."
"Did you have a good meeting with your brother?" Castiel asked conversationally. Dean's lips quirked up as he stared out the windshield.
"Thanks," Dean said with a tired smile as he tapped his card on the reader and Castiel stamped his frequent brewer's card. Dean ritualistically made his way to the pickup counter, and Castiel took the opportunity to write a quick "Good luck on your pres" on Dean's cup before pouring the brew and handing it to Dean. Dean took it and thanked Castiel without looking at the cup. Castiel hoped that he would see the message before his presentation.
"The notes you left for me," Dean confirmed. "I...kept them. Cut them out. They really brought me out of some tough places, and they're a reminder that there are good people out there, people with big hearts." Dean closed in on Castiel and took his hands in his own. "People like you."
Shit, he was not about to have one of those share and care moments, though. That was Ellen’s job. He turned to head back into the repair shop, hoping his surrogate son would get his head out of his ass.
“Don’t, Sam! You know she used Cas to get to me? You don’t think she’ll do it again? She was torturing him and somehow she figured out how to get into my head through him. We can’t let her get near him again.”
“Um, yes, Army. 498th Medevac. I piloted Blackhawk medevacs.”
He expects Cas to pull his hand back, to turn around and leave him standing alone in his room. But instead, against everything his mind is telling him, Cas stays where he is. He tilts his head a bit but he doesn’t pull his hand back. Instead, he slowly slides it down to Dean’s neck.
And Dean can’t help but smile at the big moose. Who knew having this teenage girl come into their lives would change everything? The family he had always envisioned certainly never looked like this. But a wise man once told him that family don’t end with blood. And here he is, still hunting with his brother, healthy and curse free (well, for now), living in a secret society bunker, with a girl he cares for like a daughter. His brother’s got a date with a hot teacher who is in all likelihood
"What you gotta know is that I'm mostly into girls. There was this one time, though. I met this guy, Aaron, while we were playing a two game series in Boston. He was kinda this nerdy college student and we hit it off and one thing led to another and, well… I'll spare you the details.
The dog lets out a small whine and Sam answers, “And I also think he needs to go out. Guys, I’ll take him for a walk and be back shortly. Cas, I’m so glad you are back. I’ve missed you.”
“Oh my God, Jess, that’s great! I will definitely be that awesome uncle that buys the kids loud toys, lets them play in the dirt and ruin their clothes, and someone will have to teach them good music.”
“Not really,” Castiel grumbles, “I have to skate my short program tomorrow and I don’t even know if I’ll be able to do all of my jumps.”
"Saving your hide. Now you've got five minutes to be ready to face reporters."
When Castiel wakes up the first thing he notices is pain. He’s used to pain, but his grace always dulled the nerve endings so that all of this sensation was greatly muted. It takes him a moment to recall why his grace isn’t working and then he remembers that he used what was left of it to heal Dean. He’s human again and this time his grace isn’t just stored away in a vile in a library. No, the last of it was used up (except the small remnant that will always live with him, integrated into his vessel – no, not his vessel, his body). He concentrates for a moment to figure out where the pain is coming from and if there is any permanent damage that he needs to be concerned about.
Dean finally broke the spell, looking over at Castiel, “Sorry, Cas. Didn’t mean to spill on you like that.”
It had been rough going there at first.  That night a couple of months ago when he pulled up to the front of the bunker with his brother spitting up blood and breathing so shallow he had to keep checking his pulse had been a low point.  But Sam was pulling through, like he always seemed to.  Each day he was getting stronger and stronger and Dean could see he was itching to get back to hunting.
~ * ~
grace was what breathed life back into his body after hell and it now lived in his very cells, connecting them in a way that even he could barely understand.  Dean had no words; he was always more of a man of action anyway.  All he knew was that he wanted to take away Cas’ pain and fill the emptiness left by his grace.
“I don’t even want to think about what all she needs yet. I’m going straight to sleep for the next 12 hours. Do not disturb.”
But Castiel pulled him by the back of the neck into a searing kiss, his tongue exploring Dean’s mouth, rubbing against his own tongue and the roof of his mouth, a heady dizzying feeling. And Dean sped up his strokes, needing more and more of Cas. He wanted Cas as his own. Wanted everything about Cas. He buried his face in Cas’ neck, sucking hard, pulling the blood to Cas’ flesh, reveling in the possessive satisfaction it gave him to mark his love on this man.
Castiel just smiles at him in a way that really has Dean worried.  “OK, Winchester, your turn.  I played your game, now let’s see you play mine.  You’re going to do a jump.”
Castiel walked back to Dean and was pulled into an embrace full of love, acceptance and comfort.
"But how-"
Dean takes in a huge gulp of air, breathing it back out through his nose as his mouth opens a couple of times to say something that never escapes his lips. Finally, he begins, "Listen, Sam, it's not the kind of thing you tell your little brother. You weren't even old enough to drive when everything with Benny went down."
“We’re not debating this here.  The officials made their call.  Get past it.”  Dean glances to the side where Benny is standing, stone faced.  “You too, Benny.” He says and looks back and forth between the two seething men, “Hey, we good?”
“Do you have a better answer here? Sometimes you just have to go with the best worst solution.”
“You did it! So did Sam.”
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean said, a hint of exasperation in his voice as he turned back to the bathroom to put away his towel, “I still want you to hunt with me – us.”
“You’re a beautiful soul, Dean Winchester,” the words are slurred and come out as half-asleep ramblings.
Castiel’s jaw drops, “Reindeer hat? I must see that!”
There's something about Castiel that he can't shake. Castiel is like the answer to his deepest questions and at the same time an enigma of endless mystery himself. He barely knows anything about Cas but something deep inside of him, some root desire, wants…
“Is he OK?” Sam asks Dean through heavy breaths.
The corners of Castiel’s mouth turn up into that almost smile that he does as he gives a minute shake of his head.
Dean leaned forward, looked Castiel straight in the eye, pouted his lips (which was absolutely adorable) and said, “My name is Dean Winchester, I’m an Aquarius, I like long walks on the beach and frisky women.”
“Watch it,” Dean growls, eyes narrowing on the little man.  “This is about me, leave Cas out of it.”
“Screw you,” Dean slurred.
Shame, because that Castiel seemed like a perfect fit for Dean. He had a calm weight to him, like he was so much bigger and deeper than he let on. It would be the perfect complement to help ground Dean, who had a restless anxiety to him, always seeming to have too much energy to contain.
The whole scene was surreal. Seriously, who was this chick? Well, keeping in mind that money seemed like no object to this woman, he went out to take a look at the car. Walking around the classic vehicle, he was pretty sure this job was going to be fun. The body was solid, just a few rust spots here and there and it didn’t look like it had ever been wrecked. The engine was original but in pretty bad shape. He could see someone had tried to soup up the carburetor and now the damn thing was flooding the engine. Idiots, he thought, he hated cleaning up after backyard mechanics who didn’t really know what they were doing. The car had so much potential, though, and Phoenix, seriously? His mind was already racing with ideas of how he could incorporate beautiful firebird imagery.
“Yes, my name is Nick, but I will be putting that name aside for a while to become Dean.”
“Bobby? It’s Dean. Dean Winchester.”

seriously.”
If you aren’t familiar with hockey it may seem odd that the refs just kind of hover around while the players fight.  Actually, this is pretty common, and it also isn’t unheard of for tensions to run so high that multiple fights happen on the ice at the same time (when this happens in a game it is often referred to as a gong show especially if multiple fights happen during the duration of the game).  They usually let them go at it for a bit to let the players get it out of their system, stopping the fight if someone goes down or it’s getting too one sided.  And, yes, the audience loves it.
It’s then that they hear a groan from inside the room and they both briefly make eye contact before rushing in. Dean, of course immediately sits on the edge of the bed trying his best not to touch Cas while Sam stands beside him seeing if their friend will rouse.
“Yep,” she nods, “made it all the way to the conference championship and got taken out by the Lake Erie Monsters.”
Dean gets quiet for a little while, his free hand gently tracing nonsense patterns on Castiel’s shoulder.
“No, Dean. You can lay still and let me take care of you. Just enjoy.”
“You make it sound so simple,” Dean replied with a bitterness that he hadn’t intended.
“You’re kidding me!  You’re siding with him?!”
Castiel wants to laugh at the mere idea of it. Little Jimmy Novak, the son of the two most famous televangelists in the country and
“Yeah, Sam’s fine. Well, he’s not exactly thrilled to be bunking with Lucifer, but--”
“Of-fucking-course it is,” Dean grumbles. “It’s OK, Sam’ll be thrilled to have some research to do to cure this thing.”
He hears Sam’s large steps running out of the room and a moment later feels a calloused hand on his cheek gently lifting his head from where it was slumped against his left arm. It’s the touch that grounds him, brings him back to reality and makes him realize that yes, it truly is his friend standing in front of him.
“You don’t know shit about me, lady.”
“Hey, hand me that flashlight, will ya?” Dean interrupts. “Shit! Looks like we’re going to be down two cars ‘till I can get her back to hunting shape and we find your Lincoln.”
“I think we have all been there.”
Dean is surprised when Castiel’s anger seems to fade and he looks down at the outstretched hand then up to his face.  Those damn blue eyes are looking up at him with an expression of… hope?  He can’t believe this guy is willing to put aside everything and just start over.
“So I hear,” Lucifer drawls slowly as his expression morphs into a sneer and Dean can’t see his friend in that face at all. This is 100% pure satan standing in front of him. He tilts his head and crosses his arms, examining Dean, “You were good, could have been great. You know, sometimes I wonder if I wasn’t assigned the wrong brother’s vessel. We could have had a wonderful time together. You and I are much alike, Dean.”
Castiel gives Dean a sad smile and turns to go back into the bunker but Dean catches his wrist.
“You know what? Screw you, Cas! I’m emotionally constipated? I’m not the one who pined away for a dead guy for three years!” Dean knew immediately that was below the belt. It was uncalled for and inaccurate and really off topic. Castiel froze, his mouth opened as if to respond but nothing came out. He felt as if he had been slapped. He had to get out of the car where he suddenly couldn’t breathe.
“What the hell?!  That’s a horrible ending!  Who would end a story on that note!?  I’m going to kill Chuck if he ever shows his face again.”
He looked back at his friend, who hadn’t entered the garage but was standing apprehensively outside, eyes wide and hands balled into tight fists at his sides. “You OK?” A quiet nod to the affirmative was his response. “Wow, Cas, you’re lucky to have survived. Looks like someone up there likes you.”
Castiel took a deep breath and slowly risked, “Are you embarrassed of us?”
Dean doesn’t respond to this.  He hates the idea of Sam not being able to play at his side.  Nothing feels more right then when he and Sam are in the zone, passing, scoring and kicking ass together.  And he really didn’t like the sound of a neck injury.  Those can be tricky, the thought of a career changing injury is something that is always hanging over professional athletes.
Cas’ words rang out in his head:
“You want to go back to bed, now, Cas?”
“Holy shit?! Are you serious?” Dean was floored. He knew from thousands of stories from fans that their little show had touched and inspired people in ways he could barely fathom. But to have someone who he admired so much, whose works he had read and loved, say that those works had been in some way inspired by Unnatural? It was crazy (and maybe even a little bit of kismet).
“Then you’ve already won. Look over there at your family. They are so proud of you no matter where you place.” Castiel nodded over to the table in the audience where the rest of their family was sitting, beaming at the little dancer. Sam was holding Jess’ hand and on his hip sat a little boy of two with floppy brown hair that nearly covered his big hazel eyes. Sam was trying his best to keep the rambunctious toddler quiet, but he was getting bored and Castiel could see that Robbie wasn’t going to have patience much longer.
Pamela had offered to come home with him so he wouldn’t be alone, but he knew that she wasn’t really what he needed. The two friends had occasionally found comfort in each other’s arms, abandoning themselves to the physical release that sex could provide, but both understanding that they were not meant to be. She was the only woman Castiel had been with and, as nice as it was with her, he knew that he had a strong preference for men.
Maybe it was still the high from the conversation with Jess, but Dean was feeling pretty good. He made a quick stop at home to get cleaned up and in the shower ran over a thousand scenarios in his head of what he could say to Cas. The problem was there never seemed to be a right thing to say. How do you tell your best friend (and a guy at that), who is with someone else, that you think you have feelings for him and not have him run for the hills?
“Well, I barely got dizzy doing my spins, which is a really good sign.  But I chickened out of my quad.  I can’t risk getting vertigo in the middle of a jump.  I guess I have to work on that one.”
“Woah, Cas,” Dean grinned, “you have that many people staying overnight that you keep a stash of toothbrushes?”
Dean’s brain just went on overload for the third time in one day. So Pamela wasn’t with Cas and Cas was into guys? Seriously, this was all just too good to be Dean’s life. There had to be a hammer somewhere that was about to fall.
“So, were you in the service too? A pilot? I saw your picture.”
Castiel skates back towards Dean and zips past him so close he can feel the wind on his face and when he looks at the figure skater, he is turning around, giving Dean a cocky smirk.  The bastard’s obviously getting back at Dean for showing off and doing a little posturing of his own.  Not to be defeated by this guy, Dean pushes off and skates across the ice, gaining speed until he jumps, two footed like he is hopping over a hurtle.  It’s a move he has used many times to jump over a felled player rather than tripping over them.
“Technically,” Castiel chimed in trying to be helpful, “I no longer have an angel’s grace so in my current state I am something that can be perceived as closer to human.”
“Yeah… I wonder,” Dean answers quietly and goes back to focusing on the road.
And he remembered sitting on her lap in their living room in Lawrence, Kansas.  She would sit on the rocking chair with Dean on one leg, his chubby little fingers gripping the arm that wrapped around him while his other hand twirled through her smooth blonde hair, while Sam cuddled snugly in her other arm.  He could still hear Sam’s snuffly baby sounds and smell that comforting combination of talc and milk.
“Ugh, Dean, you are impossible.” Jess groaned and laughed and squeezed his hand. “Come on, let’s get some breakfast into you then I’ll take you to pick up your car.”
Ed fumbled behind his seat for something.  He retrieved a small recording device and brought it to his mouth.  “OK, I need to record this.  Testing one, two, three.  OK.  This is Ed Zeddmore, professional paranormal investigator with the Ghostfacers.  I am sitting next to Castiel, who claims to be an angel of the lord.  Castiel, can I record this interview?”
Dean looks down, and scratches the back of his neck.  It seems to take him a moment to figure out what to say.  “So… um… yeah… I just… wanted to check on you and… just… sorry, man.”
All of my love, all of my love
You say you never worry cause you don’t need a home
And this time, Dean actually looks forward to the ride high over the mountainside in the dark with Cas.  It definitely turns out to be the most fun he has ever had off the ground.
“Jess,” Sam whispers, trying out the woman’s name on his tongue, “Uh, yeah…. hospital? Sochi?”
“Shit, Sam, go check those mooks for a key to these things.”
“What?!  Have you seen that guy?  He’s freaking hot!” Nick said defensively.
“Come on,” she gestures with a tilt of her head and lightly grabs his elbow.  “Let me at least change that bandage on your eye.  That thing’s barely holding the skin closed and you don’t want a scar on your face.”
Dean and Sam share a knowing glance, “Yeah,” says Sam, “we’re pretty close. Honestly, we were raised by a single father who had a pretty crazy schedule.  Dean really stepped up and took care of us both.”
Just then Sam comes bounding back looking really smug, “Hey Dean, I’m going use the Impala on Friday, OK?”
Castiel was taken aback. “I don’t know what you think we are doing here, Dean.” He was getting upset now too, the jealousy and feelings of being left behind all night finally brewing to the surface. “I will not be your dirty little secret, someone to fuck in the dark and deny in the daylight!”
Two weeks had gone by when Sam pulled up to the studio just as he was closing the doors for the evening.
His anxiety was already starting to feel a little lighter, the dreams becoming more spread out and even when they happened, it was getting easier to calm himself down by curling up in Cas’ arms or pulling the man close in his own. Yeah, Cas had helped him in so many ways and he was pinging with excitement that he could do something for Cas.
A couple of hockey terms in this chapter:
“So, he did good, right?  I mean, it looked good to me,” Dean asks a bit anxiously.
“So,” she asks, “what would you have done if you hadn’t gone into the family business?”
“See you later, man.  We’ll meet up for dinner?”
love between a fully powered angel and a human.  The second part was to collect the arrow of a cupid, because cupids create a
“I’m sorry?” Castiel managed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can’t be let free. I told you, I’m dangerous,” he grits out between clenched teeth.
“My mother and I,” came from just behind Dean, making him jump. He hadn’t heard Castiel coming at all. When he turned around he realized why. The man was standing clearly in Dean’s personal space fully dressed except for his bare feet. He looked so relaxed and at home like that, it stirred something in Dean’s chest, which he promptly tried to squelch. But as he took a moment to take in the rest of Castiel, he realized there was something about this man that he just couldn’t ignore.
“Cas, you can’t blame yourself. And if his family blamed you, then they are total dicks!”
Towards the end of the program is a movement in the music where the Imperial March plays and he does a slow spin combination during this dark, slower section.  Then at the end, the music picks back up to the familiar main theme and he flies around the rink, doing split jumps as the music crescendos and ends the routine with a fast combination spin and stops on the last note of the music.
It’s lovely, what they’ve finally figured out between them. This is still new, spending most every night in Dean’s bed, reading or watching TV as the hunter sleeps next to him. It has taken years to get to this point, with a decade of ups and downs, hits and misses, and back and forth between them. Years ago, during the apocalypse that wasn’t, it all started. But back then it was an occasional fuck, usually after a hunt when Dean just needed someone strong to make it all go away, a physical release of stress, energy, and adrenaline. Dean would block most feelings out, well, as much as he could from an angel who back then could pick up feelings and longing with his strong grace. It was hurried and neither of them stayed afterward. And over the years they seesawed between ignoring this thing between them and crashing back into each other after each death, near death, or possession. Castiel never thought it would go beyond that.
“I was actually thinking… you.”
"Oh my gosh, that would be so great. Thank you so much for everything, Lars." They had arrived outside of her dressing room and she leaned in and gave Dean a peck on the cheek.
Cas was rolling his own hips in time with Dean as he buried himself fully and Dean loved the feeling of Cas wanting him, all of him. He came with Cas’ name on his lips, thrusting into his lover over and over until he was spent and collapsing down to the feeling of arms and legs wrapping tightly around him. It was such a soothing and comforting feeling and Dean felt like this was home.
Baby, baby, baby
"Well, maybe you should find out."
Understanding paints across Castiel’s face, “Dean… have you ever been with a man?”
Life is weird and unpredictable and with Dean’s life, he never knows when he’ll be facing the end of the world again. And so the next day at the breakfast table, instead of just handing Cas his coffee, he sits down across from him and softly takes Cas’ hand into his own. As as Cas gives him that little upturned smile he can’t believe how easy and right this is. And loving Cas suddenly isn’t the end of the world but feels more like the beginning.
“My…” Cas stops, mouth agape.
Even with his mediocre performance score, though, his mastery of the elements puts him solidly in second place after the short program.  He knows what he has to do now.  He has to focus all of his energy on his long program and get his quad jumps back in the routine.  And he really needs to find that spark, the passion, the joy in his skating that was missing tonight.
“Love!  What else?” Theresa turned to him and handed him a box full of files to take to the table.

Dean glances behind him, searching out his little brother.  He made sure they would be rooming together here in the Athlete’s Village and he wants to find Sam and get settled in their room.  He can really use the rest.  He’s exhausted and has a raging migraine from the flight here.  Damn, he hates flying.  Even back in the States, he prefers to drive to away games if he can get away with it.  Back when he was a rookie, his teammates would tease him endlessly about it, but hockey players are a superstitious breed and if the man who is now their captain tells them it’s ‘cause he has a better scoring record when he drives his beloved ’67 Impala, well they’re more than happy to let his little oddity slide.  So what if he keeps it to himself that he is terrified of the metal death traps?
The song was Aerosmith’s
“I guess jealousy?  Lance and I went… a lot further than second base.  He’s the only one I actually had sex with.”
“Hey, it’s your dream, man,” Dean shrugs. “You got somewhere safe we can go?”
She coughs into her hand and fumbles with her notebook.  “Well, I’m going to alert the team that you are up so we can get you a clean bill of health, OK?  Just call the desk if you need anything.”
“Oh, right, let’s see,” she began rooting through a stack of papers, “wardrobe, lighting, and Melody Waters’ assistant.  Here we go.”
Internet?” Sam asked.
Dean goes still for a long moment, blinking several times. Baby can feel his fear but she also knows that this man’s courage knows no bounds.
They each sit back in their seats, leaving a respectable amount of space between them, fidgeting and straightening clothes and hair as they approach the well-lit area at the top of the lift.  Dean can’t get the stupid grin off his face and he’s pretty sure everyone around is going to be able to take one glance at him and read that he spent most of the ride up here with his tongue in another dude’s mouth.
to use it. I don’t even know what stopped me because when I brought my hand down I had every intention of it going through his heart. And you know what he did? Nothing! The fucking bastard just laid there and said my name. Fuck!” Dean slams his hand down on the dented edge of her grill and pulls his hand away, shaking it in pain. Baby feels every sharp edge of his pain and frustration.
Sam nods and heads back towards the door while Dean turns back to Cas. It only takes a moment for Dean to unlock the cuffs but without the aid of them holding him up, his knees buckle and he nearly falls to the ground before being caught by Dean.
Nick looked up at him and shrugged his shoulders sheepishly.
“We’ll get Cas back, Dean. But… we need Lucifer to re-cage Amara.”
Dean guides him to a nearby chair and lowers him into it. He sinks heavily and leans forward with his elbows on his knees and buries his face in his hands. Dean stands in front of him, arms crossed looking immensely uncomfortable.
When Dean hesitates to respond, Lucifer pounces on his silence. “So, you gonna tell me what this little bootie call is all about?”
“I… I don’t understand…” he responds, that crease between his eyes becoming more pronounced as he squints his eyes in confusion.
Luckily, when he returned to the hospital things had calmed down.  He hadn’t seen Meg in the waiting area so he went to Castiel’s room, but hesitated outside of the door, second thoughts halting his steps.  Castiel obviously hated him, even before he brained the poor guy with a puck.  He was pretty sure that he would get something thrown at him the moment he peeked his head through the door, or have security called.  He thought the last thing he needed was to have reporters catch him being escorted out of the hospital by security.
“Yes.  It was written that they were to be witnesses to the apocalypse.  It was my duty to inform them of the divine plan for them.”
“I… I’m sorry?”
The two friends settled in, prepared for a very long ride together. Dean pulled out a Led Zeppelin cassette tape and popped it in as they headed out with Dean singing along to
Castiel hears a quiet knock at the door and looks up.  It is Dean, and oh my God, what is he wearing?  He has on white pants with black boots.  That looks nice enough.  But the sweater!  He is wearing a loud red, white, and blue cardigan with a patchwork of red and white stripes, the Olympic rings, two US flags, and a spattering of big white stars over a navy blue background.  It looks like someone had an ugly Christmas sweater contest in July!
He reached for the older man, wrapping John’s arm around his shoulder to put the burden of the older man’s weight on his own back. He shuffled over to the nearest bed and lowered his father gently down. He squatted down in front of the bed to unite and pull off John’s boots then stood up to slowly lift each leg up onto the bed. He leaned over the older man to reach a pillow and lifted his head to gently rest it on the pillow.
In those dark corners, Dean had been approached by sleazy men who reeked of cigarettes, alcohol and sweat. Sam sat terrified and frozen the first time. Dean never wanted to see that expression on his little brother’s face again so he quickly learned to hide a small knife in his pocket and to flash it just under the table, but in the older man’s view, while giving the slightest headshake and give off his best get the fuck out of here glare.
The woman’s laughter is rolling as Sam tells her stories that Dean remembers fondly.
“Second base, OK?  We had just had a bit of a grope before she was hurt!” Nick admitted as he bent over and groaned into his hands.
Cas tilts his head and looks at him with those sad eyes that hold a thousand heartbreaking stories and says, “I’m so sorry, Dean. I won’t leave you.”
Once the horrible noise stopped assaulting their senses the two men, hearts beating fast with adrenaline, looked at each other and after a brief moment both erupted into fits of laughter. When they were breathless and dizzy from the hilarity, Cas walked over to Dean and lifted his hand to examine it. “You’re burned.” There was a small but angry red line on the palm by Dean’s thumb that was swelling to a blister.
"You know it don't change who he is, right?"
Sam made a face but he knew when a conversation with Dean was over.  He crossed his arms and leaned his shoulder against the sidewalk post, giving his brother the space he needed.
He decided to look closer at the photographs. There was one of Castiel with Pamela, she had her arm around his shoulder, grinning in that sexy casual way she had about her. Castiel was standing stiff as a soldier, but looking slightly sideways towards Pamela with a slight smile that reflected in his eyes and Dean could read in that glance nothing but love and respect between the couple.
Charlie laughed, “Oh my God, Dean.  He’s a keeper!”
“So this one’s going to be a beaut’ when we’re done,” Dean gave a low whistle as he walked around the 1969 Mustang Mach 1, lightly caressing the edges of her steel body as he examined her lines.   Damn, he loved these classic muscle cars.  The sharp lines, the detail that went into them, the rumble of the engines, the power he felt in the driver’s seats.  He couldn’t wait to see this one restored to her former beauty.
As the song came to a close, Castiel let go of Dean’s hand and arm and Dean immediately felt empty with the loss of the touch. “Thanks, man, now maybe I won’t make such a fool of myself at the wedding.”
“Actually, that last book, it’s called Swan Song and it’s… pretty amazing!  Anyway, so, three actresses have been-”
Unfortunately, the lenient security guard from earlier has changed shifts and the new guy is having no part of letting some random American guy back stage, hockey star or not.  Defeated, he finally gives up and decides to leave.  But he can’t get the itch to talk to Cas and congratulate him out from under his skin.
And then came the damn Mark of Cain, which made his feelings towards his best friend so much easier to ignore. It whispered in his head that he was worthless, a blunt killing tool, and that no one - not his brother and certainly not Cas - should ever care for him the way he has always secretly desired. So every time Sam tried or Cas tried is just pissed him off. What good would them taking care of him do now that he could barely feel anything but pain and anger and fear anyway?
Wow, Russian shots hit him harder than usual.  Apparently, though, not as bad as Sam.  When he kicks the side of Sam’s bed, his little brother lets out a pitiful moan, rolls out of bed and heads straight for the toilet to expel whatever is left in his stomach.  Dean is dressed and ready before Sam has made it out of the bathroom.  He sits on his bed, back against the headboard, shaking his head at Sam, who is leaning against the doorframe groaning about being hit by a train.
“The idea for angels and demons was like a tiny seed planted in my mind when I watched your show. But it was very… abstract. I was searching for more inspiration to build fuller characters and I started… following Unnatural, not just the show but as a fan of the cast as well. God, I must sound like a stalker,” Castiel groaned putting his hand over his face.
“I already promised the next dance to the flower girl, you don’t want to let down a 6 year old, do you?” Just then, as if on cue, Jess’ niece came over and jumped into Dean’s lap, forcing him to free his hand to hold her.
“Same here, Ms. Abaddon. We are all finished with the Thunderbird and I think you’re going to like how she came out. We were able to get out all of the dents and repair the rust on the body and I think the artwork came out great. Also, we had to rebuild some of the engine but with the new transmission, it now shifts like butter. Here she is.”
“Yeah, it’s cool, though. I’m not sure I’m really interested in her anyway.”
The two of them ate scrambled eggs and toast and a generous amount of coffee while discussing wedding plans and Sam’s latest case and the Dean’s bizarre new customer. Then they headed out to The Roadhouse. As they pulled in Jess asked Dean, “How do you feel about being an uncle?”
All he knew was that the thought of Cas with anyone else drove him crazy. He knew that Cas was amazing. He was smart and talented and refined. Dean was a grease monkey, a high school dropout, and a seriously damaged emotional mess. Maybe it was so easy to believe that Cas wanted someone else because he really didn’t get why Cas would settle for him.
The crowd erupts into boisterous applause as flowers are thrown onto the ice from all directions.  Castiel has skated a clean program.  It is certainly not his best ever, though.  It felt cold and detached, mechanical.  But the largely Russian audience is cheering him enthusiastically and he lets himself smile through his bows.
“Um, I’m and Aquarius?”

The woman glares up at Bobby and points a finger at him, “You better hope he’s OK.”  At that, she shoves past him over to where Castiel is being moved to a gurney.  She looks down at him and shakes her head, “Hey, Clarence.  What kind of mess did you get yourself into this time?”
Photo was
“You’ve already met her. She is parked outside.” Dean smiled at his joke and sucked on Cas’ earlobe.
Dean steps forward and shakes his hand, “Name’s Dean Winchester.  Nice to meet you too.”
“Gonna tell you a secret, Cas, most humans are shit at humaning too. Everyone’s just white knuckling it through as best we can. You’re doing fine.”
“That sounds like fun.  I’d love to go.”
The garage door groaned and creaked its objection to being opened after its long dormancy. As it rose up, the light from the sunny day made its way onto the front of the car. Dean took a deep breath and stepped forward. He could see that this car was once a beauty, probably around a 1965, convertible, off-white exterior with bright red leather seats and beautiful chrome accents. He smiled a bit thinking about its previous owner. He thought he was probably pretty cool if he liked cars like this and was best friends with Cas.
Sam pulled Harry up from where he was squatting on the ground, so he could rummage through the backpack for the salt and iron.  But Harry was clutching the backpack to his chest with a death grip.  Sam growled for Harry to give him the bag but before he could wrench it from the smaller man’s grip he was shoved forward into Harry, crushing him against the wall and sending both men crumbling to the ground.  It was the spirit and she had reappeared and was shoving everyone back.
Dean nods, a huge smile spreading across his face under his mask and he walks away with a spring in his step.
“Remind me again how many penalty minutes you’ve racked up this year.” Dean says, rolling his eyes, “Just cool it with Sam, huh?”
part of himself.  Even looking like hell lying in a hospital bed all bruised, stitched, and tired, Dean couldn’t help the little flip that his stomach made when he locked eyes with the man and shook his hand.
Dean lifted a hand to rub against the back of his neck, not knowing what to say to that. “If you say so.” The next thing he knew, his mouth was speaking before his brain even registered it. “Hey, you know what else is great for a sucky day? An ice cold beer. How about it, Cas?”
An idea dawned on Castiel.  He may not have angelic grace to mute feelings, but he knew what Dean would do to numb himself when he didn’t want to feel.  He would drink.  So Castiel headed for the nearest bar.
Benny just laughs, "No thanks, brother. You know a little man-love's your cup of tea, not mine. And I think Andrea might slay us both."
This time was different.  The drink burned his tongue and throat going down and filled him with a false heat.  He hated it, but he wanted to chase that numbness, to bury the hurt and confusion and jealousy that were just too much.  Castiel ordered another shot, and another, and another before his eyes began to feel heavy and his head began to feel light.
“Oh, that’s terrible.  According to all the blogs, he and Nick had incredible chemistry, almost like, Wincest levels - oh” Charlie caught herself as soon as she realized what she had said.
Cas ran one hand all the way up Dean’s spine and back down and in one smooth motion easily breached his already spit slicked hole with one finger. The shock of the unexpected intrusion was just about the most amazing thing he had ever felt and his body coiled up ready for release. “Cas, I’m gonna,” but Cas already knew and had reached around him with a wetted hand to stroke him through his orgasm. Cas felt the glorious clenching of muscles around his finger and the hot wetness of Dean’s come over his hand and nearly lost control himself. But this was Dean’s first time with this so Cas wanted to make it perfect. He steeled himself, holding his breath until the wave of sensation was under control.
“Let me guess,” chimed Maggie, “saving people, hunting things?”
Dean was so hard in his jeans it hurt and when Cas’ tongue licked along his hip, he couldn’t take it anymore.  He pulled Cas up by the shoulders and dragged him to the bed, pushing him down and crushing their mouths together in a blinding kiss as he straddled Cas’ hips and rubbed their bodies together, desperately seeking the relief of the friction between them.  When he pulled away and looked down at his friend Cas was smiling, fucking smiling up at him with the most smug look he had ever seen on the angel’s face.
Castiel’s dance was unrehearsed, raw, and pure passion. He danced with an unnamable weight, it was grounded and solid, all strength and grace. He leapt through the air, landing gracefully on his feet and continued the fluid movement into a roll onto his knees as he pulled his hands in, cupped over his heart. He stilled for a moment, just breathing with the music, head bowed, nothing moving but the slow rise and fall of his shoulders through heavy breaths. Dean held his breath.
Sam looks up from his screen, "Dean, what's going on? You were gone for like an hour and now you're all over the news. I've gotten a dozen messages from people asking me to comment on my brother's love life. Why didn't you tell me about you and Bela?"
“Sounds like you and Sam would get along great.  He was a bookworm too.  Always wanted to go to college but when he was offered an NHL contract right out of high school… well, you know, hockey, the family business, kind of took priority.”
He had resigned himself, however, to let friendship be enough and not delude himself with fantasies that Dean would ever want more than that. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. Castiel had certainly had his share of fantasies about the man with the sparkling green eyes. But where was the harm in that? He fantasized about George Clooney too, but that certainly wasn’t happening either, right? The difference was that he didn’t have to ride to Texas beside George, breathing in his intoxicating scent the whole way or listening to that low voice say his name or sing along to the radio. He was in so much trouble.
“You never will be,” Castiel assured Dean as he pulled him down and between his legs so that their bodies were aligned perfectly, erections slotted together and arms and legs locked around one another’s bodies.
Those touches would send electric jolts of excitement through him. He hadn’t wanted another man this much since Michael. Damn it, keep it together Winchester. He knew Cas wouldn’t want him. He had seen him with Pamela and didn’t want to mess that up for the guy.
“Oh, you know, howler monkeys,” Dean gave a fake shiver, “those things are terrifying.”
As they headed towards Melody’s dressing room, the group passed through a makeshift corridor with multiple doors on either side.  Dean guessed this was for a hotel scene but something at the end of the hall had him stop in his tracks.  Cas was sitting on a bench next to an exhausted looking Nick and he had his arm around the actor’s shoulder.  Sam slowly looked at Dean, keeping wisely quiet about the situation.
And a laugh bubbles up in Dean too. He can’t believe it. He just escaped death yet again. Maybe it is time to slow down a bit now that he doesn’t have Chuck’s plot armor anymore. But that’s a thought for later. Right now, they’ve got a barn full of headless corpses and a passed-out angel to deal with.
They were both way too big for this room and these beds now, but he remembered a time when this little corner of Bobby’s house had seemed like a palace. It was here that he tacked his first poster to a wall. It was of Einstein and Dean had called him a nerd as he hung his AC/DC poster on his own side of the room. They had spent their entire lives feeling like everywhere they stayed was temporary, borrowed, someone else’s. This was the first space that he had ever called his own and it would always hold a special place in his heart.
“You… you’re going to be trapped inside of your own mind. You’ll need to fight.”
“I thought it would be good to be prepared considering recent circumstances.”
“Think about it,” she says and turns on her heel and walks away.
“Yeah, I call that Tuesday, Cas. You know how many times I’ve been tortured?”
Blackbird (The Beatles)
“Dean… I need… oh, God… now, Dean… please!”
“You live here? Nice commute, man. Sure, lead the way.”
For all Sam had talked about wanting to get out of the life, now that he had gotten a sample of being stuck in the bunker, he was actually going a bit stir crazy.  He kept looking online for old fashioned easy salt & burns, bringing them to Dean with that hopeful expression, trying to convince him that they were easy enough for them to take on.  But Dean had him on lockdown until he was back to full fighting health.
He took another moment to calm Melody back down, patting her back and telling her she was safe.  This time, though, he made sure to keep his touches very platonic so they didn’t get out of hand again.  Finally, he took her by the shoulders and pulled her back, looking into her eyes and told her, “Melody, I need to find that guy.  I won’t leave you.  I just need to see if he is outside.  I’ll be right here, OK?”  He talked slowly and deliberately to keep her focused.  She nodded and he pried himself from her vice grip on his jacket, but she still wasn’t willing to let go of his hand.
