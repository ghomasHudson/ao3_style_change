John didn’t look up, spearing a piece of tofu with his fork. “Do I know you?”
John narrowed his eyes, and Sherlock stiffened in his seat slightly. “I’m not going to ask you what you did wrong, Sherlock, because you are an adult, and you know precisely what you’ve done. So what I’m going to do is go to Tesco, buy another kettle and razor, and when I get back everything will be cleaned up. And I am not going to talk to you for several days, because actions have repercussions and it eats you up that you have to physically talk to me to know what I’m thinking, rather than deduce it at a glance.” Sherlock fidgeted more and more by each word, and John derived a sick happiness from it. “Is that understood?”
Sherlock ignored most of what he said, rocking back into his seat. “Can’t have a ‘Stag Night’ without a ‘Buck’, can you?” He mused, more to himself than anything.
“I’d bet,” came a voice from somewhere above. “You’re supposed to dodge when you see a rugby ball comin’ your way, coach.”
“Headroom,” she breathes. And then she huffs out something resembling a laugh, until she’s outright smiling. John’s never seen her this excited, and wouldn’t have dreamed of her lighting up like the sun after seeing her meekly open the front door earlier, when he and Rosie had first arrived.
“Yeah,” Mike said from somewhere beside him, voice seemingly far away. “That’s always the first reaction, following the first time you see him. Is he real? Am I dreaming? Who is he?”
Another thing that John was sure about: Sherlock Holmes had a lot more secrets than he would've thought.
“Would you expect anything less from a Holmes?”
“It’s looking like it, why?”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said eventually, tearing his eyes away. Because it
John hoarsed, arms moving on their own accord to curl around Sherlock’s waist and pull them impossibly together. He buried his face into the curve of Sherlock’s neck. “You...”
The artificial grass beneath him began to itch on his skin, and his brain felt as if someone had taken it to a blender, but John managed a chuckle. “Duly noted. Now help me up.”
“I had to watch him
Heal soldiers, don’t get shot. Transfer medical supplies, don’t get shot. Try to sleep at night, don’t get shot. Whenever possible, endeavor to shoot at the enemy, but also while not getting shot.
John smiles, almost sadly. Slowly, carefully, he reaches up a hand onto the other man’s shoulder, thumb brushing the skin opened by his collar. Sherlock’s eyes widen. John doesn’t do anything else, just simply squeezes the warm muscles and bones there and takes a breath as if to speak, but then it rushes out of him in a sigh and his smile dwindles, feeling his face and his eyes open awfully into something he can’t name. His hand drops down to Rosie’s head, softly brushing her curls, before John releases them altogether to turn towards the doorway.
“The address is 221B Baker Street, and it’s right behind us. Shall we?”
Sherlock’s eyes open slowly, just barely. John doesn’t withdraw his hand.
The apology is in John’s eyes far before it leaves his mouth, but he says it anyway. “I’m sorry.”
John felt a jolt in the car’s speed (which he was really tiring of), and then Sherlock’s face was twisted again. He jerked his head towards John and spat, “That has to be one of the most
“Brilliant,” John was able to gasp, and an intense rush of arousal went straight to Sherlock’s groin. With his free hand, he reached down to wrap around himself and he nearly shuddered with relief. He moaned around John’s cock, and an extra bead of bitter precum dropped on his tongue.
John’s order was called, and he stood reluctantly. “And you aren’t?” He asked lightly.
ME: Hello, Beta. I’m a bit rushed at the moment, but I need you to answer something for me.
“John,” he sighed, which was rewarded with a twist of the fingers inside of him. He had nowhere to put his hands, so he settled on the doorframe above him, forearms flexing in a last-ditch effort to keep upright. When he was properly slicked and painfully erect, John dragged him to the desk and cleared it off to the side, pressing Sherlock down from the waist until his cheek was squashed against the wood. Another tear of foil and the wet sound of lubricant, and then John was pushing into him with an unyielding force.
Mycroft watched him unblinkingly, as creepy as he had been this whole meeting. “What affairs do you have, doctor?”
“Of course not,” Dimmock backtracked quickly. He turned to the overseer. “Try and find the captain.”
“It’s come up in
LOG 1.78
At the cafeteria, John ran into Sarah, and the two ended up finding a small table to sit at with their lunch. While John saw her as only a friend, he had a feeling that she saw him as something more.
- "Bite",
Sherlock was pounded with delicious pleasure mixed with diminishing pain, his groans and sighs reverberating into the wood of the desk beneath him. He was thankful of his shirt, protecting John’s eyes from seeing the absolute disgusting array of scars and burns dancing around on the skin of his back. John would just forget himself and show a doctorly concern, a pity that Sherlock had no use of.
His breath hiccups.
John’s laugh is caught in his throat. It threatens to bubble out. “Can I kiss you?”
Sally’s found the guitar. It’s not exactly
for a living. I’m capable of-”
The boy’s hands were small but surprisingly dexterous as they fiddled with the intricacies of the ship in his hands. John was surprised that he hadn’t seen the obviously young member of the crew around the facility before. While his face was pristine like an AI’s, he held a sort of determination in the dramatic swoop of his eyebrows, not dissimilar of the expression a human child would make when pouring their own milk into cereal. John was utterly intrigued just watching the boy.
“You have my word,” Sherlock said gravely, hand over his heart in pronounced sincerity. He then quirked his head. “Ellie, is it?”
The rail to Quincy Street was six minutes long, despite the near-100 kilometer distance. Though John had grown up with nothing less, the fact of today’s technology never fell short of amazing him whenever it could.
She was hooking back in her earbuds. “Well, you should be,” she said frankly. “You two would make a lovely couple.”
When he straightened, Sherlock was looking his way. The volume of the song they were listening to lowered. “I can make the trip in less than four hours, I’d bet,” he said conversationally.
Sherlock blinked once, twice. “Is that your first question?”
The brute’s face was almost hilariously offended. John’s arms were snapped backwards even further, and the fury in the air was harsh, tangible, so much so that when a knife was pulled from a pocket, John wasn’t even surprised. It flicked open, and with gleaming teeth the man grabbed a fistful of John’s hair and jabbed the blade towards his lower abdomen.
It was like dragging his hands down hard-packed snow, and John felt those dark, murderous eyes flick up to his face.
“Tell me,” Sherlock says again. It sounds like a prayer.
ME: I see. I’ll just have to give you one, then. ‘Baskerville’ is a bit tedious to type, and ‘AI’ might cause confusion in conversation.
John short-circuited. His hands were frozen around the shoulders of the man crouched in front of him, as if they were held together by magnets. Sherlock’s pale eyes were looking at anywhere but him.
“John-“
Molly was way past passive aggressiveness, now resorting to slamming cabinets and smacking down equipment. “
The water was getting cool, so they hurriedly finished washing up, sharing Sherlock’s expensive soap. “You love me,” John said finally, almost deliriously happy.
Sherlock couldn’t
RJ glanced over to look at the man across the room as well, but when John followed his gaze, Sherlock was gone.
There have been Moments. There have always been Moments, as far as John is aware, and as is the way of the world, there will keep being Moments up until the end of time.
“You’ll be taken to the 30th level, Mr. Watson, and then please proceed to the room at the end of the hall.” The elevator opened as if summoned, and he slowly nodded in acknowledgement before stepping in.
Sherlock twitched his lips, and in unison they continued down the hallway at a much slower pace. “You have? I can’t recall that particular tidbit. I could tell your military service from your right pinky, anyway.” At John’s laughter, he let his own ring out, that same sound that belonged more to an instrument than a man. He held the laboratory door open for them both. “Come now, John, this hipbone won’t liquefy itself, will it?”
“Doing what?”
John’s already halfway down the stairwell. Cheers erupt behind him in celebration, champagne glasses clink, friends give loud, theatrical kisses. Through the television, Big Ben chimes louder than it does through the window of 221B, only at a slight delay. Somehow, Rosie stays asleep.
“Okay,” John said after an awkward moment. “I’ll just…”
not to be dangerous. To live off of artificial blood, to find joys in science and detective work, to stay away from humans before they find me out, before they..." He waved a hand in John's direction. "... learn too much. But you. You're... different. I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, yet."
“I’m fine,” John said immediately, though he couldn’t help but lean heavily into the other man. He was being led quite hurriedly around the main chasm towards the bridge, the morning sun not yet hot but brightening considerably. Sherlock wouldn’t let him remove his mask. “How are we sneaking back in?”
He was here for comfort. Sherlock made a mirroring sound, chest coming alive with the vibrant ache that arose whenever he was encountered with the love he felt for John. He scrabbled him closer until he couldn’t breath, pressing his lips to the top of his damp head and wishing for all the world that things were different. That Sherlock hadn’t died and that John didn’t have a murderous wife because
Cheers, then. “How’s Candy?” John asked in a superbly transparent change of subject.
This was how they were meant to be, knowing each other in every way imaginable. Holmes and Watson, John and Sherlock. It felt right, a sense of elation in the release that came and went but was irrefutably there in the first place. In its place was surrender. John was looking at Sherlock with wide, guarded eyes.
That didn’t seem to bother Sherlock, his lips twisted in a wry smile, borderline mischievous on his face. “Oh,
Sherlock leaned further back in his chair and waved a hand, schooling his features into something more impassive. “I called in. You’re not scheduled tomorrow, we’re leaving for Plymouth at noon if we’re to secure a hotel early enough. It’ll take nearly five hours to drive there.”
In an eternal limbo filled with high blood pressure, apparently. He sighs, and when he finds his daughter (who he
But when he gets to the conversation right before the phone call, with Sherlock’s deductions towards the coffin, something gives. “He said that the coffin belonged to someone unmarried, living on their own, practical, used to death, all that. Someone rather short, I think it was 5’4”, maybe? And then a few inches, accounting for headroom.” He rolls his eyes. “Sherlock thought it was unnecessary, the git. Having headroom. He’s not wrong, as we both know that the dead don’t quibble about a tight fit, but still. After that, he...”
Dear lord, he even spoke as if he were from another time. John swallowed, mouth dry, and tentatively stepped further into the room. Mike, unperturbed at his side, let the double doors shut behind him.
John Watson was a delightful enigma that Sherlock had the privilege of never solving.
“That’ll be fine for now, Anthea, thank you,” came a voice from the doorway. John whooshed out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, before turning his head to the holder.
Mycroft was the first to break the silence. “Sneaking out of the facility, Sherlock? Really? I would have thought you to be smarter than that.”
ME: I just wanted to get in my log for the day. I’m off.
Lestrade laughed at John’s unease, which was very effective in making it disappear. The captain was charismatic, John would give him that. Lestrade clapped him on his shoulder (thankfully the right). “The past few days were mostly informational meetings, all of which I’m sure Mycroft will inform you about before the day is up. Considering that you’ve gotten your breath back, you are already ahead of the few simple exercises we’ve done. In case you were worried.”
It went fine, he had to admit. He wasn’t exactly a skillful fighter, especially with a see-through opponent, but he could feel himself working up a renewed sweat at the workout. The rhythmic movements, dodge here and strike there, all like a formula bent on being followed. It could even be fun, when John sort of got the hang of it.
“He wants to know if we’re secretly dating.”
If AIs could blush, RJ’s face would be crimson right now. Without a word he ran towards the hovering craft and jumped up to grab it, powering it off so it sat stagnant in his hands. He sat back down on the ground, and John cautiously followed suit.
“Oh, hardly. Only the parts you couldn’t reach.” Sherlock takes back his eggnog to have a drink, but instead just uses it to hide his smirk.
John had managed to grab a few more hours of sleep after the shocking dream he couldn’t make heads nor tails of. He awoke again presumably only a couple of hours later, as the sky wasn’t yet light and the ship beneath him was still. There was a shuffling in the next room.
ME: I can feel the ingenuity from here, though I accept. I’m sure this is how others feel whenever I force out an apology.
At that moment, the wounds on his face stung brighter.
At the chatter, the captain rolled his eyes. “Yes, I realize the ship is 30 stories tall and probably bigger than most of the neighborhood domes, but the tour will be brief and only over the basics.
For once, Sherlock was the sane one. John’s mind was racing all around from mistress to secret child, so he let himself fall into Sherlock’s words instead of his own delusions. He placed the rose over the lilies he left. “Yeah, you’re right. Come on, let’s make the trek back.”
John stifled a bark at that. “Sherlock? Feelings for
John wasn’t sure if he liked it or not, but it didn’t matter.
The day of the accident. John nodded stiffly. “What could you have been thinking about, might I wonder? I mean, I know what you’ve been thinking about, I just thought it only fair to ask.”
John nods slowly, sliding his arms through his coat’s sleeves. Mycroft continues on.
“Just getting you a closer look,” he said innocently, something hidden and almost mischievous behind his words. He held the door open for both of them.
“Did you sleep alright?”
“That’s right, you’d have to sleep every once in awhile to dream,” John joked.
John hesitated. “By ‘the gang’, you mean…”
Sherlock wasn’t breathing evenly, only through his mouth and in quick, jolting gasps. They were narrow enough to avoid notice, but John was becoming skilled in Sherlockian subtleties.
John’s heart instantly warmed at the words, at how much faith Sherlock put into him without even ever have seen John in action. The man liked to feign disinterest, but John had noticed that his eyes had stopped scanning the screen and that the beginnings of a flush were creeping up his collar. He decided to give Sherlock a break.
“I don’t follow.”
“Yes, Sherlock, I have a ‘type’. Sound the alarms.”
. No family, then. So what
“Nicely put,” replied Mycroft. “One would be a fool to ignore a formal invitation from Sector A, wouldn’t one?”
“No thank you, dear, I’m expecting company. Make sure Sherlock cleans up after himself, please.”
The moors were very flammable. Shaking his head from those thoughts, the only thing he could do was meet Sherlock’s eyes equally. He tried to fill his stare with conviction. He was making it as clear as he could that this was a subject that he was willing to let go for now, but not forever. “Okay,” he said slowly.
There was his reason. When the door closed, Sherlock ground the heels of his palms into his useless eye sockets and couldn’t control the sob spilling from his throat, utterly uncalled for.
John’s brain short-circuited.
Sherlock gave into his smile this time, and the room fell into the most comfortable silence it’s had in the last two weeks.
John shook himself before his ogling could take a dangerous turn. He wondered if the skin was still as cold as it looked, as cold as he remembered. Pursing his lips and feeling like a tool, he grabbed a pair of gloves from the box and slid them onto the proffered hands.
by Debussy. It’s written for piano, but the guitar has enough versatility to allow both individual notes and chords. I could never master its exact nuance on violin, not one string at a time.”
“I need to go back to Plymouth.”
Behind his right shoulder, John glanced up to meet his gaze. His lips quirked into a smile. “There you’ve got it,” he said. Behind him, the french horns sang.
Sherlock huffed out a laugh, though it didn’t have much humor in it. He said a string of words, muffled and wholly unintelligible.
“There was a dead frog floating in the carton.”
John rushed back online, and he gripped his cane tighter. He’s sure he looked even more breathless than he sounded. “Uh, yes, yes I am still in need for a flatmate. And I think that sounds just lovely, much closer to Bart’s than my current arrangement.”
here to put on the report!”
“Not today, sorry. He hasn’t been here in nearly a month.” There was genuine concern in her voice.
“I wasn’t going to- thirty seconds? Really?”
“Myth. Really, John, that’s not very scientific.”
“I don’t think we have a… ‘Jimmon’,” the overseer piped in. John resisted glaring at her.
didn’t want that to happen. “You have to understand, Sherlock, I’ve known that you were otherworldly for some time now. Whether you’re a… vampire or an alien or a particularly tall type of goblin, it’s not much of a shock. Or I’m just currently repressing it all. It’s only that I’m… a bit curious.”
“Please? If it’s okay.”
First and foremost: Sherlock Holmes rarely ate. Anytime he
“Crime scenes? You work with the police?”
What was
For example, he had forgotten his keys somewhere on the rugby field, so the door to his home unlocked itself to the touch of his hand. John looked up as the dome above the neighborhood began to light itself, the sun almost fully beneath the horizon. The time blinked 19:59. John watched it turn to 20:00 before heading inside.
John flushes. It’s not as though he’s
“Nothing gets past you.” His voice was smoother than John remembered, the baritone of it practically masking the rudeness of the words themselves. John whooshed out a breath.
did you put mealworms in my kettle?”
“I know what you said,” he says. “You’d be more surprised by me giving them to you after agreeing not to, wouldn’t you say?”
I always thought you were getting calls from an overbearing ex-girlfriend, desperate to get you to visit.”
“Sherlock!” A man yelled immediately, jogging over past the flashing lights from a collection of emergency vehicles. When he reached them, he clapped Sherlock’s shoulder heartily, and John was shocked that Sherlock didn’t immediately rip it off. “Glad you’re here, I wasn’t sure you’d deign to come and lend a hand.”
It took little thought for John to run his hands up the other man’s waist, to where his shoulder blades jutted through his shirt like wings. He tightened his arms to no give. “Hey, hey,” he said softly, “It’s alright." Human? He was sure that what he said was terribly rude and... species-ist (?), so he hurriedly tried to backtrack on his statement, however truthful it was. "You're... perfect the way you are."

the captain was trying his damnedest not to come over and throttle the man. “None of that shit, Sherlock. Mycroft was the one that called
ME: …
“I trust you,” John said quickly, without thinking. He didn’t need thought to have his answer. “I just don’t trust the other drivers.”
“Once is chance, twice a coincidence, three times a pattern. Is what they say.” He spared the rose one last glance before dropping it to the mantle, instead meeting John’s eyes excitedly. “I’ll check it out at the Yard, bribe one of the detectives into letting me into the archives. It wouldn’t hurt to see if there’s a history of blue roses floating about.”
He didn’t say that, but John
Mary opened her mouth as if to reply, but then she closed it, thoughtful. “Hmm,” she hummed.
This one was easier to explain with context.
“Yeah? I find that hard to believe. My mum calls me her open book, and I can never seem to get things past my sister.”
Of course, John immediately looked down. Jesus, they were above the immediate chasm. There was only a thin metal rail extending beneath them, acting as the magnetic track, though beyond that was a thick and cloying darkness that almost hurt John’s eyes to look at. The moon and stars above were bright enough to reflect off the train’s exterior and barely illuminate Sherlock’s pale skin, but the void utterly absorbed any light it could manage. It was like they were on a transit through space, holding on to the only thing that was grounding. If they let go, John almost felt as if they could float away in any direction.
“And?” His eyes trained ahead, shoulders relaxed. If John didn’t know any better, he’d have thought that Sherlock was bored of the conversation.
That didn’t add up. “But we’re in the same…”
“I don’t know,” John says, using all of his strength to hide his own grin. He leans down to rummage through his bag. “Am I capable of being aware?”
A grumble. "Fine."
“Don’t pull any of that shit,” John warned, suddenly angry. “I’m your friend, I’m in this as much as you are. I’m asking you to explain yourself before I inevitably help you in any way that I can.”
Sherlock met John’s eyes, much more sober. “They aren’t particularly worried about what happens on Earth, as opposed to what will happen off of it.”
And, just like that, like sun-warmed water rushing over his ribcage, John thinks,
Sherlock nods, almost purposefully casual, and turns back to the stove. John hides his face behind the newspaper, and sees that Rosie’s currently gotten the applesauce everywhere but in her mouth. He wills the conversation out of his mind.
“We would?” He hissed.
After using the bathroom and washing his hands longer than necessary, John decided to withdraw his application. Too disheartened to visit Harving himself, John went to just pass the request onto the front desk receptionist.
“I have a car, actually, in a car park just ten minutes from here. It’s been gathering up dust lately. What do you say to airing it out?”
‘Sleep’, he typed. Articles about sleeping during the day and such were the majority, but John found a bit of a gem nestled in an article about a Filipino legend:
Understanding dawns behind Sherlock’s eyes, and his mouth shapes John’s name without sound. Unsteadily, John lifts his hands to let them rest on Sherlock’s thighs, and the muscles beneath his fingers flutter.
“Fruity,” John complained, though he went back to drink the remaining few drops like Sherlock had instructed all those bars ago. Sherlock was frankly mesmerized by the line of John’s throat as he swallowed. He pulled out his phone to type in the data, but realized it was dead. With a purse of his lips, he stuffed the information halfheartedly into his Mind Palace to log in later.
Mycroft wrinkles his nose as if smelling something bad and flaps his hand, shooing the words away. “Please don’t start waxing poetic about my brother to me. I came out here for a smoke break, and nothing more.”
instead of
“But you asked-“
He needed to breathe, to take lungfuls of the London air, but he couldn’t be around people right now. If Mrs. Hudson chose right now to enter the flat, John was sure he’d fall into a panic attack. The anger was quickly ebbing away into something rawer, a feeling he could peel away at until painfully exposed. He wasn’t sure that he wanted to ponder on it, at least not right now, so he decided instead to lie down and rest. Somehow. He hadn’t slept in over twenty-four hours – for all he knew, he could have hallucinated this whole damn thing.
In the hull, it was a grand room roughly the size of the training facility, though twice as tall and slightly rounded at the sides. There were pulsing machines and grinding gears and constant noise, and a grand ceiling-high cylinder in the center that seemed to be the heart of the great engine that was the DSE Intrepid. People in black jumpsuits were swarming, either scaled up the walls, or furiously writing on tablets, or running across the floor. It was all black and chrome. John and Sherlock stuck out like a sore thumb.
“You’re still drunk,” he said, hips rolling up to make the briefest of contact. John’s mouth parted. Sherlock continued. “It’s comfort. A mistake too many, what’s one more?”
Mary brough him out of his thoughts. “Yes. It’s just, well, the baby’s due in around a month if everything goes according to plan, and… John won’t have much free time, you know. He loved the stag night you did for him, still talks about it. He says it was the most ‘Sherlock thing he could have planned’, if that makes any sense. Regardless...  I would like for you to take him out for a night of drinking. Just one more night. Let him have some fun before he’s all bogged down with Ellie and me.”
John blinked away the fog as the neuron-chip died down, feeling his brain become whole once again without distinction. Auroras were always a treat, save for their terrifying drumming against the dome and widespread ruining of anything electrical. Outside of the sun during the day, these solar flares were the next top reason every man-made area on Earth had some sort of overhead protection. The light show used to be harmless, but with a thinning atmosphere, it had the capacity to be lethal.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft rolls his eyes, but turns back around to fetch his coat with as much dignity he can muster. “I always
“I’ll… think about it,” he lies, half-heartedly. She smiles again, seemingly satisfied, and coos something to Rosie that has his daughter giggling. He desperately wants to leave. What with Molly’s sudden mood change and her thorough knowledge of the human body (and its insides), he’s not willing to take any chances. Besides, there’s no way in
John laughed at that. “You’re not wrong.” As they entered the field, John picked up his pace. “I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep up, so I’ll see you around?”
Although, her terrified reaction upon meeting Sherlock and Sherlock’s late-night admittance were completely separate points. Those were the points that gave the theory merit. That somehow, Sherlock was a creature of myth whose eyes turned colors and who was strong enough to tear a man in half. Those were true points, concerning Sherlock; John thought of his monthly visits to France (if that’s what they even were), and his eyes whenever he returns. He thought of the car accident, where Sherlock stopped the vehicle with just a hand.
John groaned, though his voice was gravelled and he had to force it from his chest. His head throbbed tremendously. He opened his eyes to the blue of the high ceiling, the projected clouds moving sluggishly across the arc. “That hurt,” he muttered.
“This is pointless,” John said aloud.
Sherlock had to remember that this was a heavily impaired man he was dealing with, so he pulled back reluctantly to ask: “Are you sure?”
The door downstairs closed, and the flat fell into a deafening quiet. Sherlock stood with a pop and wandered over to the mantel, brushing his fingers over the layer of dust. Somewhere in there, John’s skin cells remained. “The worst is never over,” Sherlock muttered to the skull.
Sherlock leveled him with a

John! You aren’t allowed to be bitter.”
“Oh, it’s worth it,” he drawled.
“Sherlock.”
“Yes, he’s on the roster. Do you have any questions, Mr. Holmes?”
half a minute to manage the steps and the traffic; John had tested it, later. Less than five seconds from the flat to across the street, that was what Sherlock had managed.
John was going to ignore the ease this boy apparently held when breaking into top-secret files. “Weird as in…?”
hope. “We hopped over a fence to get here, John. Do you really-”
John couldn’t quite school his mouth from curving up in response. “Good morning,” he replied.
“… Out.” He hesitated slightly, but John was too tired to really notice. He
“So yes?”
She said it as if it was expected of her to help him out. This was the longest they’d spoken since before he left, even longer since they’d spoken without a fight. But John couldn’t pass up the offer of a newer phone, not with his current sand-encrusted one he’d bought before deployment. “Thanks, then. Are you and Clara still in Chelmsford?”
Sherlock huffs and digs some more, past the makeup (for last-minute disguises) and a withered 1929 edition of Shakespeare’s
“I know, I’m a doctor.” He absently sipped at the next one, eyes flickering between the man sitting across from him and the menu, and said, offhandedly, “Adrenaline seems to be a popular subject between us.”
And, of all the times and all the places, that’s where John first saw him.
“Wait,” the man interrupted. His eyes were dangerously narrowed. “You’ve spoken to Mycroft?”
“Hey Sherlock,” he greeted, peeking into his own room. It was expectedly small, only enough room for a twin bed, a nightstand, and a thin wardrobe. There was a porthole just above the bed, though, which John would definitely take advantage of. He glanced back to Sherlock. “So you’re room 111, yeah?”
Sherlock suddenly narrowed his eyes, sniffing the air like a bloodhound and lips just barely covering his teeth in disdain. “Anderson’s here, isn’t he? I can smell his cheap cologne.”
“John,” he said in lieu of greeting, voice slightly scratchy. John couldn’t tell if it was just the lighting, but Sherlock looked positively haggard, dark circles beneath his eyes and sullen cheeks. He looked like he did the first time they met, now that John could compare it to how he looked when his eyes were silver and he was alive with health and energy. It did nothing to damper his beauty, oddly enough, his exhaustion just more obvious now. His voice was cold, but not harsh. “I’m not tired.”
Those were the only ones that stood out. The rest were bordering on irritating, like ‘does sunlight burn’ or ‘do you like the taste of human blood’. There was even some rubbish about magic and energy-sensing. Growling under his breath, he opened a new tab with a jab of his finger.
“I think it’s more metaphorical than-”
“Oh, thank god!” He exclaimed, swinging his feet over the edge of the bed. “Remember the last time I was there? Your mum thought I pissed the bed, my sweat drenched the sheets so bad.”
The rain came in, pattering the roof with a symphony of woodwinds. “You misunderstand as usual, brother mine,” Mycroft voiced into the quiet, impossibly kind. “This isn’t to protect himself. Everything, the marriage, the secrecy, the mission. Destroying A.G.R.A, the root of Moriarty’s network and the last of the fingers in the pies. It hasn’t been for him. It’s all been for
“Yes?” Sherlock drawled, pajama bottoms on and chest bare save for his dressing gown. John didn’t have the patience to ogle. Sherlock was seated at the table with one of John’s slippers, a mealworm wriggling along the sole.
John didn’t
John wasn’t an idiot, despite what a certain detective-consultant-or-whatever liked to say. If it were anyone else, the signs would be blinding enough that John would’ve already asked them to dinner long ago. The constant looks in his direction only seemed to grow more heated lately, and touches between the two were becoming commonplace.
“It’s beginning to heat up, I think!” He yelled. He only coughed once, though it was harsh. “Also, the fuel is beginning to release fumes. I’m not sure how toxic it is…”
“Well, I know that you can go out in sunlight.”
“Because he’s in them too.”

“What I’m goin' to do -” John began, toeing off his shoes with barely-there coordination, “- is get myself undressed -” the socks were a moderate success, considering that he almost tipped over, “- clear off your desk by that window -” he fumbled with his fly, forgetting that he was wearing a belt, “- bend you over it -” off came the pants, too, where he was half-hard, “- and fuck you until you forget your own name.” He peeled off his jumper and shirt, and gripped the hem of his vest. “Does that sound like a plan?”
. I’m sure you’re just
“John! This way!”
good fellow.” Sherlock took the rose easily, not having to worry about pricking his skin. “Unique enough to catch our attention, yet simple enough to pass over others. A flower at a gravesite is common, and it’s easy to confuse a fallen rose as a romantic gesture. If this
his brother was correct.
John rolls his eyes at the transparency. “Sherlock. I know you, and I know your brother. There’s a file over me hidden away in one of these bookshelves, I’m aware, and I stopped minding it long ago.”
Sherlock’s eyes zeroed back in on John, taking in his confusion with a quick glance from head to toe. “This is a very particular crew that has been put together. While to you the decision may have seemed abrupt, this isn’t just one of your football teams that can switch around players at a whim. Everything has already been calibrated specifically into the ship, and potential changes in the crew aren’t taken lightly. So, by context, that means that we must be kept safe in our nice little bubble.”
John locked his jaw closed, an impossible notion clouding at his mind. He had questions, millions of them, in fact. What was Sherlock talking about? He spoke carefully in that baritone voice, as if he was limited in the words he could voice aloud. Whenever it came to John, he was never the person he put out to the public, more personal and familiar even when giving John the cold shoulder. He was becoming such a large part in John’s life, so much so that John couldn’t help but entertain the thought.
He realizes he’s not alone. An exhale sounds from the living room, the kind that your body releases without your permission, like a balloon rushing out of air, and the familiarity of it curls against John’s throat.
feel alive. For the first time in quite a while.”
He’s handling the greatest mind in London, in the world, pressing his fingertips to his skull. He wonders what it’s like. How it feels to live as a man who thinks and feels with potency, with considerable weight behind it. It feels wrong, knowing there are things within his mind that John will never know, memories and fears and desires with an occupancy of one. He can pretend it’s scientific curiosity. Pretend it’s anything other than what it really is.
John was already fading into the crowd, and with a start Sherlock watched hands already reach out to grope. John didn’t seem to notice, let alone mind. Torn between staying out of sweaty, sticky bodies and becoming well-acquainted with them, Sherlock reluctantly had to choose the latter when he watched John grope someone back.
John watches. John watches him swing Rosie in the air with a laugh as bright as the morning air, watches him doze on the couch with his whole body melted into boyish innocence, watches him as their skin brushes and John gives a tentative smile, the grin he receives in return capable of launching a thousand ships to their deaths. Hears him quietly sob in the night when he believes nobody is awake, his thick shouts from nightmares and the shuddering of his breath whenever they’re at a crime scene with too much tragedy. Watches him dance the waltz to lure a baby to sleep, putter around John’s health with gentle hands, hum as he prepares dinner in the kitchen, chase suspects down alleyways with constant reassurances to verify that John is still right behind him.
Sherlock flicked his eyes back to John, and the graveness in his expression made his face seem uncomfortably gaunt. “You have my word,” he said seriously, “that going outside of the dome and taking my readings is something that I need to do. If the data I take from my body and the environment proves my hypothesis… millions of lives and future lives here on Earth can be saved.”
Now, they were in John’s bathroom readying for the Galactic Gala, as it was cheekily called. It was an enormous event thrown for the residents of the ICAM (as the twenty thousand or so people had all dedicated themselves to everything regarding the Intrepid), and broadcasted around the world for each sector to officially see the crew and learn more about the terrifyingly close launch date. It was a very formal thing, John had soon realized when the tuxedo had appeared in his wardrobe. Luckily Sherlock had swarmed into his room ten minutes ago, perfectly dressed, as if he could sense John’s cluelessness and immediately remedy it.
ME: Changing the subject, when do our logs shift to stage 2? Is there a certain number we have to reach, or do I have to decide? I admit, I wasn’t entirely listening to my dear brother’s initial explanation of the program.
Sherlock knew immediately who he was talking about. Who else? “Taken?”
Sherlock blinked, once. “You
Damn. “Jimmon.”
There was a brief moment of silence. “Boring,” Sherlock then proclaimed, eyes leaving John to study the empty table beside them with utmost fascination.
The scrubbing gets louder, and a fork clacks in the sink with too much force. “I don’t ‘tip-toe’, and I’m certainly not—”
“John Watson,” he greeted, holding out a hand. It was gloved, so John took it. Between their palms was a business card, complete with phone number and title. “Pleasure to meet you. My name is Mycroft Holmes, and as I’m sure my assistant has mentioned, I am the First Officer of the DSE Intrepid.”
She seemed irritated, but mostly confused. “Yes, I realize. Er, do you remember the name of the… patient?”
John held up a hand, effectively silencing him. He then extended his arm over the table with a pleasant smile. “My name is John
“Well, the gang is planning on heading into Dartmoor tomorrow evening, out towards Red Lake. Just the usual, drinking and catching up. Would you like to join?”
ME: Surrey.
Sherlock smiled mirthlessly. “Now, yes. At the time, not in the slightest.”
“No,” they said simultaneously, both blinking at him. John eyed them both for a brief moment, almost suspiciously.
Second on the list: Sherlock Holmes never slept. Never. Not even once has John seen the man catch a wink of sleep, and John spends majority of his time in the actual flat. He sees him lie on the couch for hours on end, eyes closed, but he knew better than to think that Sherlock was actually dozing. His breaths, while even, always seemed
After that, Sherlock began to climb. John, unable to do nothing while he worked, began tugging up the rope with another exhausting use of strength, inch by inch. When Sherlock made it up, John tugged him over the lip into the bay, their roles switched from when the other man had saved him from the canyon’s edge. They collapsed on the floor, both utterly worn.
He watched Sherlock shrug, the man’s own hands gloved and grasped onto his handholds tightly. “They don’t expect people to do this,” he replied. “There aren’t any precautions to take if there isn’t a foreseen problem. An obvious miscalculation on the security’s part.”
Sherlock automatically felt offended at the offer, but before he could snap out a rejection John pushed forward. “We’d love to,” John interjected. Sherlock turned his glare onto him.
John blinked, feeling an odd sort of anger rise from nothing out of his chest. Was it jealousy? No, of course not. Where had the thought even come from? What did John have to be jealous about, he wasn’t in love with the man.
He’s still guilty about everything he’s put Sherlock through, his
John watched Sherlock’s face downturn, like the cast of a shadow. His lips tensed, and his brows slanted sharply over narrowed eyes. He looked completely different, yet utterly familiar.
That seemed to throw Sherlock off, but he recovered quickly enough, lips pursing as he resumed the session. John couldn’t help but wince when the chip powered back on, brain splitting back into distinct, overwhelming parts. Sherlock, though, seemed to attempt another route.
“Yes, thank you,” Sherlock said, swinging the door closed. He eyed the officer beside the door, a pretty woman who already seemed acquainted with Sherlock, if the glare on her face was enough to go by. “The door locks, if you’d like to join him,” he said in faux innocence.
Laughter scuffled around the group. John raised his head only enough to lock gazes with the ringleader, keeping his eyes steady, and then promptly spit in his face. “Go fuck yourself,” he wheezed.
He pushed back impatiently. “More,” he growled, voice thick. If John Watson was going to tear down every brick of his foundation, then Sherlock Holmes wasn’t going down without a fight.

was beautiful?
“You should be scared,” he says. “You’re next.”
What he didn’t expect, however, was a lunch request.
Sherlock ignored that, eyes drinking in what they can from John’s appearance. “You’ve lost a half-stone in the two weeks since the ordeal,” Sherlock commented. “You need to eat more.”
Sherlock nodded towards the door, as if to say ‘follow my lead’. Dear lord, the man was a drama queen. With a barely-constrained sigh, John followed his lead.
Sherlock’s jaw tenses, and he turns his head to look back out the window, where the snow is beginning to fall again. His hands are braced tightly around the guitar as if he’s ready to heave it away. “Then what are we talking about, John?”
“Yeah, sure,” John sighed, leaning against the desk. Her voice was nonchalant enough, but her eyes were wide whenever she looked at John. It sent off the smallest of alarms in his nerves. “What’s this about, then? Another member joining the team?”
“It’s… stiff, but nothing too major.” He blinked at her, questioning, while he struggled through righting his sock. Bart’s seemed relatively calm, now that finals were over and summer internships beginning. That didn’t explain her excitement.
job, better than any woman I’ve ever gone to. Just yesterday, I…”
John nodded, no need for modesty. “Very good, actually. And I enjoyed the work more than anything.”
And then the fifth time, almost exactly four weeks ago. John found that he wasn’t upset that Molly knew, only that she was angry. At
Sherlock wanted everything. He deserved nothing.
But Sherlock didn’t answer, only pressed his shoulder firmly against John’s. Mycroft raised his eyebrows slightly at that, a surprised expression that looked wrong on his face. His eyes were curious as they studied his brother’s body, and his brows dropped to furrow the barest amount when he didn’t find what he was looking for.
muscle memory," John muttered absently, then starting in surprise that he knew the words. Mycroft gave an off-putting smile at John’s dismay.
John starts in surprise. He wasn’t expecting her to want the specifics, and he finds himself wholly unwilling to reexperience it all himself. “Are you sure? I don’t remember any of it too well.”
"And it's about to start heading this way."
From there, during the pivotal moment of John’s lifelong emotional state, it only gets worse.
John’s not even surprised by the question. He runs the pick down the strings slowly, quietly, in one final chord, and shakes his head just barely. “No,” he replies. “Not yet. But almost.”
“Oh, John,” he said, pulling out a box. “You’re joining me?” He tapped the carton against his palm, pulling out the extended cigarette with his teeth, and lit it up.
he sings softly, fair and lilting. His foot is keeping rhythm.
“I need you down here,” John interrupts, pulling away. “Playing your guitar. The same thing as earlier, it’ll calm her down. And then, afterwards, later tonight when she goes to bed and it’s midnight in Argentina, I’ll kiss you again, even if January 2nd is nothing to celebrate. And I’ll keep kissing you until it’s midnight across the United States. I’ll kiss you on all the midnights. Would that be alright?”
“I suppose,” John replied, ignoring the niggling at the back of his mind.
John was spinning. Through the doorway, he could see flashes of an aggressive sort of pink, worn by the woman face-down on the floor. The corpse. Serial adulterer? Suitcase? Sherlock could be making this all up, for all John knew, but damn if he didn’t believe him regardless (if he could figure out what ‘it’ he was believing). Lestrade must believe him, too, if he kept bringing him back to antagonize the NSY and call everyone idiots. John knew first-hand Sherlock was too extraordinary to stay away from, even while being a complete and utter-
ME: Thank you. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.
Lestrade’s teeth ground together, jaw tensing and vein popping noticeably on his forehead. He wagged his finger at Sherlock, but his hands were so tensed that John
“It’s gotten better,” John defended, even as he nearly tripped over the slightly-peeling carpet. He glared at it, as if it was there solely to taunt him. “Really. Plus it’s cheap, and army pension isn’t accommodating. The Moorgate rail lets off close here, shouldn’t take you longer than an hour.”
inclined, the kind of inclined where he couldn’t walk straight and giggled at everything Sherlock said, he would get the cap badge of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers on his bicep. Perhaps even something related to Sherlock, as John’s impulse decisions usually seemed to involve him.
, John wanted to say, but he (wisely) didn’t. “Right. I’ll see you in the morning?”
John tries not to let a hysterical giggle bubble up his throat. He glances around the sitting room and notices Molly, from where she’s talking to Greg and very transparently watching them from above her wine glass. He shakes his head to clear it. “Sherlock,” he says. “Are you asking me to kiss you when the clock strikes twelve?”
Sherlock held the door open for the both of them, and John entered first.
“Oh, for
ME: In any case, to summarize, I was able to secure the last ‘Barbie’ doll before that wretched woman could snatch it back. Also, it seems as though the end of the world doesn’t excuse those blasted Christmas songs from playing on repeat. That Mariah-something song has been wracking around my brain non-stop for the past hour.
“Sherlock!” John yelled, eyes pleasantly dazed. He batted away the man behind him, stepping much too close towards Sherlock. “Have you ever been to a gay bar before?”
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed, narrowing his eyes. His hand on John’s thigh creeped up higher. “Then I think I’ll go to the loo, then, before I take my leave.”
The rail was simple enough to latch onto as it began slow, and there were several notches on the exterior that they could grab. Surprisingly, no one noticed the two men darting onto the magnetic track and hopping on the back of a train, which really said something about how much the general public observed at five in the morning.
It starts on a Thursday morning while John’s making pancakes for three.
Well, John wasn’t wrong. For nearly all of their brief acquaintance, Sherlock had shown not even an inch of sexual interest, because there wasn’t any there to begin with. Something changed last night, a switch flipped that caused Sherlock to be utterly and irretrievably attracted to John. Now, it was quiet again, but like a volcano; he could feel it just below the surface, dangerous and unpredictable. But, at the moment, the atmosphere was as it was before this whole issue, though maybe a bit more awkward.
There are two – no, three – others, outnumbering John significantly.
The Moment is upon them. The backs of John’s fingers brush the royal-blue silk of Sherlock’s shirt, and it’s startlingly warm, warmer than his own skin. Sherlock’s chest shudders and he lowers his eyes. “Now?”
On second thought, this is the simplest thing in the world.
is it?”
“So a stalker who leaves odd-colored roses? Seems sort of… banal.”
There was no sweat on Sherlock’s brow, and no color in his cheeks.
There wasn’t another knock, a long enough quiet that by the time Sherlock made it down the first flight, he hesitated. Was he still there? With slow, careful movements, he unlocked and opened the front door.
John closed his eyes, defeated. “I’m… not-”
“Sherlock has spoken of me? My, this is worse than I thought.” He continued on before John could respond. “As of now, my brother is tearing himself to pieces trying to find you. You left in quite the haste, you know, door wide open and cane forgotten. Looks an awful lot like an abduction, you see.”
Hands. Hands everywhere. Heat. Lights and colors flashing, voices and music blasting Sherlock’s ear drums. And most of all John, hips dictating the rhythm Sherlock followed. Arse against groin, shoulder blades knocking against a chest, sandy blond scalp drenched into brunette propped on a shoulder. John reached behind him to grab Sherlock’s hands, placing them firmly on his hips.
John sighed, though he felt his own blood awakening into something much more thrilling than casual sparring. He let some of it leak into his voice. "Damn it, Sherlock. I would have liked a bit of a heads up that I might fall to my death today."
But it
But they just barely made it to the doorway before Sherlock was barreling past them back to the stairs, eyes wild with glee and phone in hand like a bat out of hell. Both men spun around, only one in surprise.
221B. No, strike that; the safehouse Mycroft had organized for them on the coast, waves crashing somewhere outside and his skin damp and sticky with salt. There was a slight grit in the air. His fingers tensed on the grained wood of the table in front of him, the texture soothing him as if it tethered him to the Earth. It was easy to retreat into his mind when all he met in reality was the hopeless veil of black.
His own drink needs some topping up. “Do you mind?” John asks, and Sally shakes her head. She hides her smile by turning back to the bookshelf, pointing out a knick-knack for Rosie to try and grab at, and John thinks (but dares not voice) that motherhood suits her. He wonders if that’s something she’s ever wanted, and then realizes exactly who he’s thinking about. He shivers involuntarily.
John pulls back, cutting him off. Sherlock’s arms loosen until his hands are merely resting against the curves of John’s shoulder blades. John looks up to meet his gaze, but Sherlock’s eyes are closed. There’s moisture dewing on his dark eyelashes.
At the village, John was pleasantly surprised by the modernity of it all. It was never too traditional – there had always been cars, and running water, and basic electricity. There had even been a movie theatre, albeit a drive-in with barely enough space for twelve cars. Only today, there were full-blown roads, and even a bank. There were two schools now rather than one, and instead of there being a small farmer’s market, there was an actual chain supermarket. Mary had told him that she had just gotten air conditioning for the inn – he hoped that applied for the other places in the town, as well.
A gunshot rang through the air, and then another. Logically, it was just an unfortunate series of backfires from any number of vehicles, but John didn’t have the time nor the mind for logic. The sound of rubber screeching on asphalt burned through the air, and John’s instincts came to play. He immediately dropped to the ground, cane flung, and only had the slight vantage to see a car barreling towards him at too-high speeds for the city. He was frozen on the pavement, muscles steady but locked on the ground, and he couldn’t do anything more than battle at his war-torn body to
He didn’t love John. He wasn’t dense enough to know that he wasn’t too far off, but at the moment, it was just a friendship that lived off of the way they suited each other. It thrived from John’s sudden bursts of intellect and Sherlock’s reluctant moments of sympathy. They suited each other, even (unsurprisingly) in the most intimate of ways. He cared for John. He didn’t want a relationship, per say, but he selfishly wanted John to stop looking for his little girlfriends. No, he didn’t love John, he decided, because he hadn’t the faintest what love was even supposed to feel like.
“He played the violin at your wedding,” Molly repeated, though this time softer and voice thick with something sad. Despite himself, that pissed John right off.
John paused, tongue prodding at the inside of his cheek, before letting his eyes roll at the implication. “I’m not in love with Mary, if that’s what you’re getting at. She’s an old friend, never was anything more than that.”
“What?”
“Good luck,” was her reply.
“Two months,” John says.
The sun was nearly gone. John turned his head to the dimming sight.
John closed his eyes, body wobbling from inebriation as he reached up to fist his hand into Sherlock’s shirt at his chest. “You know why I’m here,” he said quietly.
Sherlock sighed and propped up his elbows on the tabletop, sinking his face into his cupped hands. “That leaves us,” he said carefully, “In very dangerous waters.”
At the words, Sherlock’s face seemed to fall out of its frenzy, into something more familiar. “You’re… we’re…”
ME: Let’s go about this again.
He dropped his head in his hands, stifling a groan.
As if possessed, John walks until he’s directly beside where Sherlock sits, and he doesn’t know what he’s doing. Something masochistic, he’d wager.
John sits back up in his chair, and at the look on his friend’s face he suddenly wishes he could ruffle his hair without looking like a lovesick fool. As it is, he’s not doing much better. “You… you don’t seem to realize that you have an even bigger heart than I do. That hardly means I have the brain, obviously you have enough for the both of us, just.” He scratches at the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I’m shit at this, you know. You’ve been a saint about all of this, of the baby crying in the middle of the night and the diaper runs and being, frankly, the best godfather a bloke could ask for. I just thought… I should return the favor, is all. For being, well, you.”
“End of term,” Mike explained, fiddling with his tea bag. “I like making my finals unpredictable, changing up the format every year. I’m a notoriously tough grader.”
With a sigh, John steps closer to study the pipe himself, noting how the wood catches red in the sunlight. The carvings are clean and detailed, the result of a steady and practiced hand. “It is a nice pipe,” he admits.
“Sherlock,” a woman’s voice whined, backing slightly out of the doorway as if she was being ushered. John immediately froze in his tracks.
John nodded, feeling some of her nervousness against his skin. “Yeah, yeah, I’m not in a rush. D’you know what it’s about?”
“What?”
have. Domestic life suits you.”
He sucked in a hiss through his teeth, cradling the phone between neck and shoulder as he perused the menu. “No can do, busy.”
“Just...” John slurred, eyes more black than blue and level with Sherlock’s mouth. He was licking his lips.
“Point taken.” While Sherlock had the most impressive arsenal of insults known to man, he rarely spent the energy on aiming even the mildest ones towards John. Whenever he did, John knew to tread lightly. “One more?”
John made a needy sort of noise in his throat, like a man dying of thirst being given a river. Sherlock had released their hands so he could grip John’s head in his hands, pressing them impossibly closer even though there was a table between them. John hung his hands loosely from the other man’s biceps and opened his mouth, deepening the kiss skillfully and earning himself a thin moan. Sherlock tasted so deliciously familiar, he almost wanted to cry.
She tilted her head to the side so that John was in her periphery. “He came to my flat last night, as drunk as I’ve ever seen him. He… he told me about the five times.”
"If you could allow me one more question?"
It was obvious.”
Oh. John will regret this. John will
In London, there was room for doubt. Filled with people that were decidedly
“Yes, well,” Sherlock said, trying to keep his mouth from curving at the corners. “I prefer my doctors healthy and at the top of their game, you understand.”
“That
In a flash, John was jostled by Sherlock’s hands clamping around his jaw and holding him still, his pale face up close and cracked open with glee. “A c
So John left for the ship ten minutes before call time, dressed in the last t-shirt he would be able to wear outside of sleeping for quite a while. He had a bundle of anticipation in his gut, utterly excited to see the spaceship as if he was a little kid. He’d have his nose pressed up against the glass very soon at this rate.
“Dumpsters?” For a DI, Lestrade seemed eternally in a state of confusion. “Sherlock, do you remember what we talked about? About how you should talk through your reasoning so it doesn’t look like my unit is pulling convictions out the arse?"
“Yeah, yeah,” John interrupted, face to the sky and eyes closed as if he was restraining himself. “This dumpster hasn’t been used for its intended purpose for a while. I got it.”
ME: You’re definitely helping. John was always
Lestrade appraised him evenly, for just a moment, and then he nodded, satisfied. “Good to know. The room’s just this way, up we go.”
fine; he could go without having sex with John Watson. He had gone 34 years without it before and he was perfectly neutral about the matter of it happening again.
Two strapping arms pulled him up, and ink dotted his vision from the sudden movement. His legs were steady beneath him, but he could feel the persistent ache in his thigh he was well used to by now. He prodded his head with careful fingers. “How long was I out for, then?”
John tried to scream between aching gasps.
Unfortunately, someone had beat him to it.
hungry, as all of his neglected human tendencies were rushing back with a force that was difficult to ignore. He didn’t deign John with a reply.
They were closing in, though. John had to focus on the fact they were trying to kill him to keep up his determination and, even more importantly, his sprint.
A hefty sigh, as if John’s question could bring down the human race from its idiocy. “The Intersectorial Center of Astronautical Means, more colloquially known as ‘Sector 15’,” came Mycroft’s reply. “It’s the home of the DSE Intrepid and, more importantly, your training. Now, if you’re quite finished admiring the vehicle, I would suggest that you
Someone shouts, “Oi, the countdown’s starting!”
“Of course you’re my friend, Sherlock,” John assured. “Course you are. If we’re being honest, you’re probably my best friend.” Not that he had many others to call ‘friends’, either, to compare him to. Before Sherlock could stutter out something else, John shook himself back into something serious. “Tell me what your plan is.”
How did I not see it?” He ground his brother’s hand into his hair, crushing it to his scalp in anguish. “I couldn’t protect him, Mycroft. And now he has to protect himself against the person he shouldn’t
Many hours later, both men trudged into the dormitories, every muscle aching and utterly worn out. The physical training was designed to push to and identify limits, and the mental test was nothing but relentless. Before John made the turn down to his room, however, he paused. He had been curious. “That thing you said earlier. The interesting theory. What is it?”
ME: ...
. He’s
“Ta. Stake through the heart?”
In the morning, John descended the stairs to the smell of a delicious breakfast, the oily scent of bacon intermingling with eggs alongside fresh coffee. John hoped this wouldn’t be a daily occurrence, as he could definitely get used to it.
Just as Sherlock had predicted, Lestrade was waiting for them right as they entered. And, to absolutely no one’s surprise, he was furious.
John blinked. He had figured as much, but to hear it spoken aloud did strange things to his heartbeat. “Oh,” he said dumbly.
“But what if I’m not talking about the criminals and experiments?” He murmured.
anything related to stalking, it’s genius.”
“Yes, yes, same time. Now
“Well, aren’t you in for a treat,” Lestrade said, though he didn’t have the same good nature as earlier. He continued to browse the crowd thoughtfully, lips pursed. “He’ll show up eventually. Unfortunately, I can’t discipline him for any sort of misbehavior, that goes straight to my First Officer. For now, just…” He waved his hand away distractedly, his smile tight. “Log yourself into one of the stations and use the simulation for practice. I’ll send him your way when he decides to grace us with his presence.”
John wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but it wasn’t
John tried to protest, ears burning, but anything he said would just incriminate him further. What argument could be made, anyway? The man was undeniably gorgeous, after all, and unfortunately said man was all too aware of the fact himself. With harsh movements, John jabbed on the radio and settled into his (comfortable) seat as vague pop music played. Sherlock chuckled at the display.
Sherlock’s hair wasn’t tamed, curls slightly flat against the left side of his head. He noticed John looking, though, and hastily ran his hands through it. “I need to leave,” he eventually said.
The hostess seemed surprised that it was for two. “Yes, of course. Right this way.”
“We’re both drunk,” John commented without heat. He was doing up his trousers, but he wasn’t avoiding Sherlock’s eyes in the aftermath, oddly comfortable. He met Sherlock’s eyes with an easy smile. “We couldn’t stop ourselves, yeah?”
Apparently not. John felt himself, sadly, more put off by the fact that he was being asked by a man than being asked for the third time that day in general. He stares at his flatmate’s ass on occasion, and suddenly there was a giant flashing
Why had Sherlock stopped, exactly? Oh, right; they were at a dead end. There was a ladder leading up to the roof, but it was severely rusted; he doubted Hawthorne had climbed it. There was a dumpster beside them, and Sherlock was positive he was in there. Recently rained, the rooftop above was tilted down so the run-off water ran into the alleyway; there should be water on the dumpster’s slightly-concave lid, but it was merely damp. Someone had recently opened it.
John huffs in disbelief. His hands begin to trail up, up, up, and Sherlock’s eyes flutter open in surprise when his fingertips brush the cut beside his ear, half-hidden by his hair, where John’s fist had sliced open his skin. John’s other hand barely touches beneath his right eye, almost catching on his bottom lashes, where the white of his sclera is still stained red. Sherlock’s stopped breathing.
ME: Baskerville has already launched this AI program to several different facilities around the globe. If we shift our focus towards specialized robotics, we can have machines find the best solution at double the time.
That much was obvious, if his busted lip and broken nose were anything to go by. To be honest, he had
The first blow was dull and powerful, a meaty punch to the abdomen that John absorbed the best he could. The next came higher, unprepared, catching his breath sharply beneath his ribs. Apparently his death couldn’t be quick; they had to have some fun with it, after all. Of course. The next punch skid across his face, nicking the skin of his cheekbone open. He tried to kick his feet, to writhe himself out, but another man just simply leaned down to hold his legs together. When the second punch to the gut came, John couldn’t stop the grunt that slipped out.
John interrupted, voice commanding. Sherlock popped his jaw closed, and for the first time since John arrived, Sherlock met his eyes.
“John Watson,” Sherlock murmured into his neck, “it’s been my pleasure to be ruined by you.”
In his lungs, John’s breathing was shallow.
“Let’s start with your kind.”
cases without his help before, and he seems to be on the top of his game today, fueled by the past month of inactivity. John settles in for a quiet evening.
“I experimented a bit in uni,” John confessed, breath hot against Sherlock’s neck. “We’re having fun, yeah? Just fun.”
Sherlock’s mouth went dry. His chest was fiercely struck with that familiar all-encompassing pain, the one that ran alongside John showing any sort of affection, as twisted the interpretation. His eyes fixed themselves on John’s clavicle.
Obviously ogling his flatmate while getting examined for internal bleeding, nice. “I guess I’ll, er, turn in for the night, then.”
John cracked one of his eyes open, and spoke in a whisper. “Can you sneak me out of here?”
Their lips brushed barely, the electric spike of contact, and John inhaled sharply through his nose and tangled his hands in Sherlock’s shirt to pull him closer.
With John, though, Sherlock had little tact, so it didn’t take long for the issue to bubble to the surface.
“John?”
Sherlock ran his fingers along the laughter lines of John’s face, more pronounced in his delighted grin. “You have wrinkles,” he commented with a playful twist of his nose.
He’s decided not to buy it. The shopkeeper took it with good humor, waving them away with a promise that he’ll keep it warm until Sherlock decides to come back for it. Now the man’s back at his work table, polishing the bell of a french horn with careful, precise movements. John stares until he realizes that Sherlock asked him a question.
But, as Sherlock watched with narrowed eyes as John stared at the kettle until it boiled as if in a state of trance, there was something irrefutably ‘up’ with John that couldn’t be defined.
Sherlock heaved a sigh at having to repeat himself. “I’ve just told you about my own gift; I’ve never told anyone else, you know. My brother had ordered men to kill you, which means that you know too much.” His eyes flashed against the road. “I would like to hear your findings.”
Grounding the heels of his hands into his eyes, he opened up his old medical notebook to a blank page. He found a Sharpie on Sherlock’s side of the table’s clutter, and uncapped it with his teeth. At the top of the page, in neat, block letters, he wrote:
He only briefly heard Mycroft say something sounding like
But, inherently, he isn’t cruel, so he eventually cuts her off and says, “Kidding. Thank you, Sally.”
She was being suggestive, but John hardly noticed. He was blinking far too fast, and his blood was cresting in waves behind his ears. There were… far too many similarities to simply shake off.
“Your car is en route, approximately thirty seconds away,” he drawled. “Don’t bother packing - anything you bring will be confiscated anyway.”
The initial cleansing was painless, though the tour afterwards didn’t go nearly as far in depth as he would’ve liked. The interior was gorgeous and modern, sleek with a sort of majestic nature that was directly correlated to its size. Massive windows decorated any free wall space they could find, and chrome seemed to be a favorite accent material. The crew was shown the main lobby area, the dining hall, the direction of the plethora of research laboratories, the off-limits hull of the ship, the even more off-limits bridge (that only the main crew had access to), and lastly the rooms. John’s neuron-chip spat out his room number easily.
“Distract me. Prattle on about nothing and everything so I don’t go back there and-” He cut off his sentence with a strangled sound, writhing in his seat as if his body was at war with his mind, yearning to take action on its own accord. John subconsciously flattened himself to his door.
John nodded, taking another sip. The chatter began to disperse into something more casual, a little gossip and some more venting. It was a cathartic meetup for the group, sure, but John only sat there positively itching to interrogate the story behind a specific ‘myth’ that supposedly existed amongst the moors. Mary, sensing his boredom, nodded him up to take a walk with her.
… And now what? Now he was going to play ‘house’ with a monster, and pretend that it wasn’t impossible? That this was just a normal part of life, that it wasn’t an absolutely insane notion? It seems as though he’d never truly ‘accepted’ Sherlock for what he was, only delayed it further.
Sherlock inspected the container as if just now noticing what kind of tin it was, and rolled his eyes at the sight. Popping off the top revealed five rather large pills, almost violently red in color. “I have severe anemia, so for it I have to take an iron pill any time I eat. I have more… iron in my body than others, and as a result I suppose there are positive side-effects, including clear skin.” He inspected the pills for a short moment, before clasping the box closed and sliding it back in his pocket. He drew his eyes up towards the sky. “Quickly, now. We’ve a small window before it pours again.”
Sherlock? John carefully swung his legs over the bed, sliding his socked feet quickly into his trainers. The doors opened automatically with a hiss, and John winced at the sudden noise. Another hiss soon followed.
“Who,” John breathed.
“Oh, funny. My
John was feeling terribly unnerved, shifting his position. He looked at RJ’s shoulder rather than his face. “Why is that?”
Sherlock cleared his throat and shifted in his seat, keeping his eyes perfectly trained on his device. “Shouldn’t I be? You obviously don’t get enough sleep as is, whether nightmare related or not, considering you’re up with me half of most nights and off on your own the other half. You do your best to hide it, granted, but a hangover is the last thing you need.”
In the car, John pretended to be asleep, but he knew he didn’t fool anybody. Least of all himself.
Sherlock rumbled, and John refrained a shiver. “Very good. I’ll make a detective out of you yet.” He stepped back and around, to glance behind the gravestone as if someone was hiding. His full lips were pursed. “Mary successfully fundraised for the stone, which means that he was well-liked around the town. Any number of people could’ve left this.”
Which is why he wasn’t expecting a red hologram to power to life in front of him, and for it to reach out and strike him in the side. “Hey!” John yelped. It didn’t hurt, but the feeling of compacted energy hitting his side was an uncomfortable, intense sensation. He tried to punch back, a tad childish in his lack of strategy, and it easily dodged.
just to drop his aggressive ‘not-gay’ mantra and give into his attraction. Where every heated look, every touch, every moment of tension was immediately disregarded depending on sobriety. Was John the sort of person that could feel attraction on a whim? Where he could see Sherlock just as another bloke until he decided he was good for another shag, and then he was ‘beautiful’ and ‘brilliant’?
“Nope,” she replied, popping the ‘p’. John furrowed his brows.
A hand pressed lightly on his shoulder. Sherlock didn’t even have the energy to shake it off. “I’m sorry,” Mycroft said awkwardly.
for some excitement, yeah? Some danger?”
It was like he was addicted, a niggling in his bones that called for action. For a dying soldier in his hands, for something to sew and wrap and
“Are you serenading me?”
“Impossible.”
So, like any emotionally-constipated British man, John chose to blatantly ignore the problem. “I’ve thought about radioactive spiders.”
John felt offended on his lying imaginary behalf. “Am I- What is your name?”
Sherlock scowls, but does an inconspicuous shimmy in place, little more than a shuffle in his step but preening nonetheless. He’s done that since the very first day John’s known him, and it’s comforting that he’s still the same man from before, as hard as it is to believe sometimes. Sherlock straightens his shoulders an inch taller. “Well. Thank you. I didn’t know if this shirt was ‘festive’ enough.”
“I’ve set the field’s temperature to be nice and toasty for your run,” he continued. “Because I am a kind and gentle god, I’ve turned the obstacle course setting off, so all you’ll be doing is running. Ten laps minimum; I’ll decide if we should stop there, in case some of you are still unenthusiastic. Any questions? Excellent. Follow me.”
ME: CANCEL
Delicious breath washed over his lips as Sherlock sighed. “As you wish.”
“Understandable,” Lestrade replied. “Six years ago, I was a physics professor with an obsolete piloting certification. Now, for whatever the hell reason and after an assload of training, I’m leading a ship into the great unknown.” He downed his water in four great gulps, and then gave John a grin. “Scary as hell to hear your captain say things like that, huh?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, fighting the nausea. “Yes.”
It was odd, waiting. Not just for the cab, but for… life, in general. Not even a month ago, John had had the most powerful epiphany of his life, the biggest upheaval of his whole belief system in the physical existence of the unknown. And before that, he had been living months like in a mystery novel, of near-death instances and scary stories in the dark and vague observations that his flatmate rarely ate, never slept, and could sit like one of Michaelangelo’s sculptures indefinitely without so much as breathing. And before that… he was waiting for his deathbed to arrive, trading the sand of Afghanistan for fast food joints and people dressed up in ties and skirts.
“Ever?” John questioned with raised brows. While he
They headed outside, where it was lightly misting and darkening by the second. Sherlock seemed paler in the outside light, the contours on his face shadowing gray rather than a more human shade of red or pink. He was much too beautiful for his own good. The pair loitered at the entrance, almost awkwardly, before deciding to speak.
John couldn’t help but set down the fork and reach out to touch his fingers, trying to use his warmth to soak into the pale skin beneath. It was awkward, as John was practically cupping Sherlock's cheek by proxy. The hands tensed, but didn’t move away. “I haven’t said it enough, Sherlock, but… I’m not… whatever happens, I’m not going to shout it from the rooftops. You can trust me.”
“Obvious.”
John’s laugh is so high-pitched, it borders on a giggle. “You have?”
The response was near-instantaneous.
ME: Don’t, you know I loathe platitudes.
“I killed her!” John shouted over the thunder, closer than before but still much too far. “She tried to... I killed her.” He stepped closer. Sherlock had no way of knowing that John was precisely the length of an arm away, his sense of sound in such a loud atmosphere touchy at best, but he could
ME: What is the current world population?
Scratch that. Sherlock’s heart must be twice its normal speed at this point. With a gulp (and much internal cursing and praising towards the invention of alcohol), he followed John into the bar.
This time John
ME: Rather, you could be learning wrong information at any given time?
“Obviously,” Sherlock grumbles, sliding his phone back into his pocket. He stands up, facing his reflection in the mirror over the mantle to straighten his clothes, as if he wasn’t already (annoyingly) impeccable. “Why don’t you just ask Mrs. Hudson to babysit? She’s made it clear that she’s always available.”
Sherlock nodded, and crouched down so he could be more level with the man. “You’re a doctor,” he commented. “Is this position comfortable enough for the human body to sustain overnight?”
It was just a step off of a ledge, now. The fall. The landing was for another time, another place, and it would most definitely kill him, but the fall was the adventure, he thought. When there was nothing to lose and everything to prove, the fall is what mattered.
ME: …
John imagines Sherlock cutting a sharp line with a violin perched on his shoulder, the music guiding him into something both charming and oddly alien, passionate and powerful and unspoken in its elegance. John would’ve never imagined him over something as casual and as warm as a guitar, and he’s not even sure he could conjure up an accurate picture in his mind if he tried. “You don’t seem the type,” he says carefully.
“With who?”
He looked back to him and shook his head earnestly. “Neither am I. It’s been… very nice, living with you. A test of self-control, yes, but not something I would readily give up.”
He was just standing there, unyielding, the moon much larger in his mind than in real life.  As part of the ground as the skyscrapers were. Waiting. Completely alone.
Though when Sherlock came back the next day, eyes silver and a smile on his face, it was harder for John to drop the thought. Luckily, he was (apparently) hard to read.
up down… and again.”
ME: No, thank you. Again, are you hooked up to Google?
It was the landlord. Lestrade thanks them distractedly, promising John a pub trip soon and Sherlock a nice, juicy murder for his help. It’s nearly midnight when they leave.
Sherlock huffed under his breath, as close as he was getting to a laugh. “I think you’re properly worn out from the last one, don’t you?”
Sherlock couldn’t help stumbling back at the force. “What’s this for?” He asked with an affronted look.
John nearly yanked at his hair in frustration. “
There was something unnerving about being outside on land so flat, that he could spot the slight curvature of the Earth over the incredible distance he could see. But there was no use dwelling on what made him uncomfortable. He found a particularly dusty-looking spot, and settled there to take his samples.
She shakes her head, hugging Rosie to her chest as she lets out another huff. “I thought it didn’t make sense, really.” She blinks up at John, controlling the squirming baby in her lap. “You need to ask him, John. If you and Rosie can move back into 221.”
And that’s when Molly squeaks. She widens her eyes and stiffens in her seat, as if she’d just solved the equation that’s been on her whiteboard for years. She starts blinking quickly in a very Sherlockian fashion, so much so that John has to trail off in worry.
Crime scenes and prying DIs behind them, they walked. Sherlock still didn’t meet John's eyes, but he couldn’t stop the smile of his own, small and endlessly fond. “In all my years, I’ve never had my heart broken before.” He huffed to himself. “I don’t think I could survive it.”
“Midnight?” he asks.
11 DECEMBER 2017
Information loaded rapidly into John’s brain, things like
He was beginning to talk more, and John felt triumphant. He leaned further forward. “What is your name?”
Both men fell forward into the ring, and the spar began once more.
by the way – to make the party. And you know that, because you cried yourself to sleep last night. On top of that, your dog has cancer and you don’t know how long you must see it in pain before you put it down. Oh, and check your teenage daughter; I think she might have a drug problem.” He said all of this in rapid fire, before the woman in scrubs could even think to close her gaping mouth. Sherlock leaned closer, eyes manic and teeth slightly bared. “So how about you focus on
“I’ll just assume that you’re either a doctor or used to be on the force, and not a serial killer, shall I?”
“What should I do, then?” John asked after a moment.
Sherlock didn’t mention the subject change, though he definitely noticed it. He glanced up from the screen with confusion at the words. “Who?”
6 JANUARY 2017
Sherlock didn’t reply. He didn’t have to, as Mycroft seemed to be taking his leave. “I’ll keep in touch,” Mycroft said, returning to his annoyingly posh exterior. “While you did excellent work in destroying Moriarty’s network, we both know that the man was popular enough to warrant admirers. I’ll alert you if anything arises.”
John rolls his eyes, perching his chin in his palm. He lightly taps their feet together beneath the table, which isn’t too difficult considering it’s only truly big enough for one. “Yes, multiple. How’d you know I bought you something? Sitting on my wallet at a slightly different angle, am I?”
John likes to pretend it would’ve been the former, but he’s not too sure. “You’re not insufferable,” he says instead. “I’m still here, after all. I
John thought. John had slept in his own uniform, anyway, his a light sky blue with ‘CHIEF OF MEDICAL - WATSON’ labeled at his chest. He inclined his head in agreement. With a tight nod, Sherlock began down the hall with John alongside.
“I…” He breathed, eyes dropping to John’s mouth and forehead leaning in to brush against John’s, “That is, I…” He fluttered his eyes closed, his nose slotting beside John’s, “You…”
today, as if still going through puberty?
“Hook your right arm around it, like that. Here,” Sherlock hands him a pick. “And then… right. Just start strumming, I suppose. Not too hard or it’ll sound harsh.”
“Home?” Sherlock asked, hopeful.
“Mycroft?” John asked. “Wait a minute – if your brother didn’t tell you where I was, how on Earth did you find me?”
John bit back a groan. “Might I ask
He places a clean plate to dry on the rack beside the sink. “It’s not about Mary.”
“Well, I heard that you came back from Afghanistan, so I was wondering if you were going to pay your father a visit? Like you used to?”
John stood and shook himself of the pint he’d had.
John shrugs. “It’s not an entirely selfless gift. That’s my favorite opera.”
With a silent exhale, Sherlock flipped open the lid with a great swing and jumped back, the sound of it hitting the wall harsh and sudden against his ears. When nothing immediate happened, John leaned forward to peek into the bin. He sighed and dropped his gun. “There’s nobody in there, Sherlock. Just… garbage.”
Sherlock waved a lazy hand in acquiesce.
RJ nodded excitedly. “Yes! Like the walkway.”
John scowled at that, but pushed himself up further into something more comfortable. “No, no it’s not.” He could’ve leveled Sherlock with one of his no-nonsense stares, but he preferred to just close his eyes against the harsh lights. “How did you get to me so fast?”
“Understood.” His chair creaked as he began to lean back, their questionnaire over, but John held up one of his hands.
“Who is this?” He demanded.
Gritting his teeth, John kicked off the pavement and began to run.
“Eat,” John insisted, pushing the plate further towards him, the iron pill nearly rolling off onto the table. A bite to eat usually seemed to ease the sharp end of his temper, and after the yelling match earlier over the state of the toaster, they both could use a peace offering. Sherlock paid him nor the plate any mind.
“With the level of-” kiss, “-friction on the tub floor and-” nip, “-our combined weight, the chance of slipping is currently at approxim
“Then the sheet music wasn’t one of your brightest ideas,” Sherlock shoots back, tilting his head in John’s direction with a smile to soften the blow. There’s an extra second of silence before he continues. “I don’t play at the flat. Not recently, anyway.”
He shifted in his seat, eyes still hard. “It wasn’t difficult to deduce that the ringleader was planning to draw the beating out, nor that the one in red had a gun in his waistband, nor that the tall one was aroused. Not difficult in the slightest.” He leveled John with a peripheral glare. “You’re not invincible, John!”
“I’m the doctor,” John reminded him, standing up with the glass vial in hand. It was still freezing, but the lack of moving air at least kept his skin from numbing. “Would you like me to help you with that?”
Yeah, he should not have said that. Shockingly, instead of pushing him, Sarah dropped her arm for him to hurry past her.
ME: If we can’t determine its effectiveness within this lifetime, then this may be the end of humanity as a whole.
A sigh.
Faces alight in recognition, a few laughs and several groans smattered into the mix, but a good chunk of people join in on the following verse. Molly seems pleased with herself, even if she’s not singing along, and when she meets John’s eyes he gives her a slight nod of approval. She blushes, but not before smiling even wider.
John snorted. “A bit.” And then he cleared his throat awkwardly, but this next part needed to be asked: “What are you going to do about your brother?”
“How did he die?”
With a wince John sat up in his chair, not even bothering to tame the disarray he knew his hair was in. He sluggishly tapped in an order for coffee and the greasiest thing he could find on the digital menu at the table. “Never. But it’s all fine. Anyway, before you were saying something about… Mary?”
The number was unknown. “Hello?”
She tried to seem professional, John could tell. The break in her voice gave her away. “Y-yes, of course.”
“No iron pills today, then?” John asked.
Sherlock was a genius through and through, and while he never skipped the chance to call John an idiot, he
John zones out and glances into the kitchen, to where Sherlock and Molly seem to be having a serious conversation. Not an argument, persay, but not casual small-talk either, out of place among the lighthearted atmosphere. John narrows his eyes curiously at the sight.
was that?”
It was an unspoken rule that they not bring up the more intimate ways they were together, and that heavy inebriation around the other wasn’t much of an option anymore.
John chuckled. “The blindness is temporary, Holmes. Trust me, I’m a doctor.”
The door opens and closes, and the front door downstairs soon follows. The silence is deafening, so John pulls the Union Jack pillow from behind him and promptly screams into the fabric. Rosie giggles in delight.
All he had thought about was John, and that singlehandedly drove him into completing the mission. How John smiled at him when Sherlock said something that shouldn’t have been funny, how he ordered extra chips whenever he needed to eat during a case so Sherlock could pick off his plate, how he could say exactly the
“If you ask around Dartmoor, you might hear similar tales. Of a cold stranger, more dangerous than the hounds, screeching to the heavens in search of this… thing. This woman. Frightening the townsfolk into their homes, ransacking house to house until he found her. In our little town is when blood was first drawn.
John has the sneaking suspicion that he does know. That he’s known for a while now. Still, because he’s a coward, he shakes his head.
“All the more reason I should join you.” Sherlock, for all the glamor and confidence he inherently carried, suddenly looked unsure. “I know that I have been difficult to live with… and that I’ve been avoiding you lately, however circumstantially. And that won’t change, my constant mood swings and sudden sulks. But I’m…
In the car, John turned on the radio to something droning and aimless, already drowsy from a full stomach and the back end of an adrenaline rush. He was absolutely beat, both body and mind. He was just closing his eyes when Sherlock spoke.
‘Victim killed by poisonous gas. Covered in a thin film of concentrated chlorine. College student, Lestrade matched him up to a missing person’s case a few weeks back. I found his old flat. Coming? -SH’
“Sherlock?” John questioned, feeling alarmed. With his adrenaline having lowered considerably, the various aches around his body were making themselves known.
Staring at the front desk longer than appropriate, John spun on his heel and walked out the main entrance with a shaking fist.
“That’s a rainbow,” John said dumbly.
“Red Lake, I believe.”
A particular Moment that stands out, for example, involves the Outing That Need Not Be Mentioned (John has a habit of emphasizing the landmarks in his own mind palace with Capital Letters). Or, to the layman, John’s stag night. More specifically, the last thirty minutes of it.
ME: Do you go by any sort of name, by the way?
John let himself be maneuvered. “Isn’t it a suicide?”
Looks like he wouldn’t be getting any small talk at the moment, then. It felt like the past hour was a dream John had just woken up from, a nightmare that he was still feeling the effects from. Hell, the past 24 hours could be explained away as a particularly feverish hallucination. This, eating out together, could easily be a normal night for them, without context, but the tension that simmered under the surface couldn’t be ignored. Sherlock was very obviously looking anywhere but at him, falsely casual, jaw hard and the line of his shoulders expectant.
“I don’t dream,” Sherlock answered immediately.
“Welcome home, Sherlock,” he called over his shoulder. “The worst is over, it seems.”
And yet… ‘signs of vampirism’, he typed into Google.
John just smiles tightly and keeps cleaning. After everyone leaves, he oscillates for a moment, floorboard creaking outside of Sherlock’s door. A love affair, he remembers. He raises his hand as if to knock, then thinks better of it and starts up the stairs.
he was seeing where Molly was coming from.
Inside was bare and metallic, oddly soothing in its lack of emotion that death provoked in the outside world. There was a woman there, thin and mousy in a lab coat that seemed a size too big. When she heard the door close, she whipped around with a squeak, ponytail hitting her in the face. “S-Sherlock,” she sputtered.
John feels his lips twitch despite himself. “I’ll buy you candy floss.”
John froze. Completely and thoroughly froze. Thomas, the shy scientist he was assisting for the evening, was nervously staring at his paper rather than writing on it. This could not be happening. It was a well-known fact that Thomas was gay, though John didn’t like to listen to the gossip of what the young man got up to outside of the workplace. They both were just acquaintances, after all, and it wasn’t John’s place to judge. He thought that the two were simply professional with the other.
“My opinion? There’s dead bodies in there.”
John clenched and unclenched his hands at his side, something uncomfortable sliding along his spine. “Sherlock, I’m… we’re not going to. Do
John eyed him warily. “I’m not leaving 221B.”
Sherlock practically ran over the scantily dressed men on the dance floor, nearly suffocating in glitter as he tried to reach his friend. His John, who was currently laughing at something another man was saying into his ear. Sherlock hesitated before them.
With the cell phone switch months ago, John had only really given his mum and Harry the new number. No one else was immediately necessary. “No, no, not a problem. What’s the lucky occasion?”
save me, twice," John reminded him. "I think your kindness is a much easier assessment."
John throws down the newspaper with a sigh, twining his fingers together instead and staring him down. “Am I what, Sherlock?”
Sometimes, when John is very, very lucky, late into the night after a case or while Rosie naps on one of their shoulders or even sometimes over a simple, quiet breakfast, he can catch the briefest wave. An impossible gentling of the face, painted in adoration and longing and happiness all in one as Sherlock Holmes lets his facade fall from the great brain, and into the even greater heart.
“You don’t understand,” he nearly spat, not out of anger but out of tight restraint to keep himself quiet. “My hypothesis. The one brought about by RJ that I haven’t been able to tell you about yet. There’s a way I can prove it, but I need to get down to the research building and grab what I need. I wasn’t allowed to bring it aboard.”
Yeah, tied down at her booming profession of haircutting. There were no barbers anywhere north, John was sure. “Harry…”
He nearly scoffed at the notion. Sherlock's hands were that same pallid color as the rest of his skin, fingers long and nails perfectly manicured. He wore a royal blue shirt, buttoned up and sleeves folded pristinely up to his elbows, and John was surprised to find that Sherlock wasn’t as thin as he had thought. Slim muscles winded his forearms and buffed his chest, buttons straining against the pressure. A month ago, John thought him to look almost sickly, but now that was
Sherlock takes one look at him, and mildly turns back around. “Nevermind.”
we are. Though this has to be some sort of copyright infringement.”
‘No time,’ Sherlock mouthed back. With a hard look, John only locked his jaw and pulled out his gun, flicking off the safety with the press of his thumb. He nodded to Sherlock, once.
see?”
That stung with a truth Sherlock was almost afraid to admit. “A grave error on your part,” he admonished with a humorless smile. “I don’t have friends. High-functioning sociopath, do you recall?”
“Excuse us, Mrs. Hudson,” he says, giving her a tight-lipped smile and jerking his head imperceptibly to the side. She huffs but pats John’s arm anyway before puttering off to save Mycroft, from where he’s seated at John’s chair and looking terrified while he holds Rosie as if he’s never seen a baby before. John turns back to the man before him.
nothing, Sherlock supposed. So, despite the fact that he wasn’t sure if he could even classify himself as ‘tipsy’, he nodded back and stuffed himself back into his pants. “Yes. Drunk.”
After the pool incident, Sherlock thought that John had seemed a bit… off.
“Relax,” Sherlock felt John say through their bodies, more than he heard.
“Yes, well,” Sherlock said, snatching back John’s jacket and bodily stuffing him into it. “We’ll honor them by finding their killer, won’t we?”
initiated,
The knee bouncing won’t work forever, now that Rosie knows how to walk. Sherlock tries anyway. “Okay,” he says slowly.
“No, god no. I have a few tricks up my sleeve.” He ran his hands down his jean-clad thighs, wiping off the sweat. “I admit, the knife wasn’t expected, but no, I wasn’t prepared to die. I was prepared to
Her smile was frenzied, if not bright. “Just trying to keep busy. I hate having days off, and the captain refuses to give me any share of the workload. I’m afraid to ask the first officer, myself.”
John awoke with a start, sweating and much too interested in the events than he should be. His cabin was small but oddly comfortable, and out of the porthole the sky was still dark. The knot of anticipation for the impending launch in the morning was nearly painful at the pit of his stomach.
Pulling back just enough, John looked up at the other man and slipped his mouth into a slow grin. “What a coincidence,” he nearly purred. “So do I.”
Sherlock eyed the table suspiciously, and then flickered his eyes back. “Talk?”
“So you miss it?” His voice was almost too nonchalant.
“Nicely put,” the brother replied with a sniff. “Now, regarding your involvement with Sherlock, I’m afraid that it’s high time I take this… predicament into my own hands.”
“You? Underestimating me?” He wraps his arms tighter around the taller man, soaking in his warmth. “What a strange and completely new experience. I’m reeling in shock.”
John thought that to be ironic, considering that the exercise for today was
He shook his head. “I may walk amongst the angels, John, but don’t think for one second that I’m one of them.” He was pressing his lips together, his brows furrowed in an almost confusion. “I’m… I’m not a good person.”
“Not the shirt,” he commanded in a decently-strong voice. Let him have this one thing, if John Watson was going to consume everything else. After a charged moment John jerked his hand from his grasp and nodded, once, before dropping to his knees and sucking down Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock hid his smile into John’s cheek. “Damn. Oh, well. I’ll have to deal with it, I suppose.”
Sherlock’s eyes gentled impossibly further. “Obvious,” he murmured.
John chuckled, just a bit. “Did you even look at me? I wasn’t making small talk, Sherlock, I was…”
Ahead, there was a figure - Sherlock. The pale of his hands matched the blinding white of the moon, as if he absorbed the light directly from it. He was walking away from John, and as fast as John ran, he just couldn't seem to catch up. He called his name, but Sherlock never acknowledged him. Eventually John awoke in a jolt, damp sheets tangled around his legs and alarm clock blinking 3:48. Troubled, he was unable to sleep again for the night.
“Of course I did,” John says, turning his head to watch his daughter gnaw on her toy. In reality, he just can’t face the raw emotion in Sherlock’s eyes, not in the middle of a half-empty café in Islington without preparing himself beforehand. “You shouldn’t be surprised.”
. Imagine being this Scott, then, who can smell the chemicals in your blood with just enough focus. Who can pinpoint which Indian restaurant you went to three days ago just by the barely-there scent of turmeric still lingering on your teeth, and what brand it is. Usually it takes making eye contact to focus in on all of these different signals, like picking out an individual from a school of fish, but the process isn’t exactly well-documented, even by me. Imagine being so caught up in this world of yours that you disregard the baser of urges that other people like you experience.
Sherlock chuckled humorlessly at that. “You’re five years too late with that one, I’d say.”
“Leaving,” Sherlock announced. “I’ve got some dumpsters to rifle through, I’ll let you know when I find something.”
John’s eyes lit up. “No!” He replied triumphantly, face looking as if he was trying to damndest to control another fit of giggles. He struggled to push himself back up from the floor.
“Forty-six seconds,” Sherlock corrected. “Serial adulterer, dry umbrella, ‘Rache’,
baby. They paint a nice picture, he thinks, all smiles in front of the fireplace and the mantel’s twinkling lights, and when Sally sees him, her expression schools itself into something much more dignified.
“Myth.” He seemed to hesitate. “As you’ve no doubt noticed, I don’t sleep. Can’t.”
have had to.”
Sherlock huffs and plays his major chords even louder.
“Oh, it’s official now, isn’t it? When’s the wedding?” His smile is unnerving as he gracefully disrobes his outer coat. John wants to throttle him. Sherlock takes the coat from him with a too-wide smile, leaning out the door to toss it right back out onto the landing.
what was the bloody point to all of this if it didn’t keep John safe? Sherlock’s death, his return, the wedding, Mary’s bullet in his chest, Magnussen. Was there ever even a reason?
and Fitzgerald’s
Oh. Oh, John. He reached out his arms in the semblance of a waiting embrace. “Always, John. Alw-”
Mycroft goes to stand under the cover of Speedy’s, his beloved umbrella nowhere in sight. John watches him carefully, expectantly, like Mycroft’s a viper planning to strike at any moment, but it’s like the man doesn’t even know he’s there. He pulls out a cigarette and lights it, taking a slow drag that mingles with the frost of normal winter’s exhale. It’s silent for a moment.
Sherlock hummed, eyes trained somewhere on the far wall. “Unimportant.”
“Goodnight,” he says instead.
ME: My dearest brother urged me to join the program, obviously hoping that this promising piece of scientific discovery would be enough to lure me away from a relapse. An understandable but futile tactic, I’m afraid.
murderous. John didn’t want to meet the stare, but after he slid on the last glove, his eyes moved on their own accord.
“Do you want to go home now?” Sherlock asked over the rising music. John, eyes bright, vehemently shook his head.
“Sherlock!” He shouted over the rising volume of the ship. God, Sherlock was further down than he thought. “Try not to breathe very much!”
about me, and yet you’ve never told-”
When they arrive to 221B, Rosie is just rousing from her nap, so John changes her nappy and sets her into her favorite toy, a seat surrounded by a variety of knick-knacks where she can jump and spin around to entertain herself. It’s taken up a permanent, colorful residence in the sitting room. Sherlock is wearing a hole into the rug as he paces, face unreadable, and John just sits in his chair and waits.
“Upstairs.”
“Because you are going to sleep for the next few hours, up until precisely 04:45 in the morning.”
The hills were dark and bathed in milky fog, the only source of light coming from the full moon above the trees. John recognized the scene instantly as the moorlands in Devon county, where he would visit his grandmother during his adolescence. The air was stiflingly humid, even during the nighttime.
“You’re… pale. Icy. Eat very little. You’re very strong and even quicker. I’ve never seen you sleep, and… well, you’re beautiful. Gorgeous. Incredibly, impossibly perfect. It’s just a sort of beauty that doesn’t exist. Can’t happen, not naturally." Sherlock was staring straight ahead, not blinking nor breathing.
“Three weeks and five days ago,” Sherlock said simply.
alternatives. I’ve heard of a family in America who feeds purely on animal blood, though the practice is rare. While it’s enough to survive off of, it’s really not enough to thrive.”
“No!” She cries, batting him away while John bombards her with smacking kisses. The music falters again, and John glances up. Sherlock’s looking at him in a way he never has before, like how John knows he himself looked that day in that little café off Camden’s Passage, when his feelings for the man (whatever they may be) threatened to crash over him like the murky Atlantic. John’s tired of losing himself in his confusing, anxiety-ridden thoughts over it all, so he instead just grins.
And you helped him
“I can’t see the ground!” John shouted over the increasing loudness of the wind. They were slowly but steadily gaining velocity, and if it took off into hyper-speed now, John was certain that they would be ripped off.
“So,” John began, fingers rapping at the table. His left hand was clenched in a fist at his lap, to avoid Sherlock’s wandering eyes noticing the tremor. “What have you been working on all morning?”
The ground was cakey, and what looked dusty was just a fine layer of film that stuck to his fingers when he touched it. There didn’t seem to be any excess dirt that could be transferred to the vial. Nothing came off even when he scraped his thumbnail against the rough ground, and only minimal dirt puffed up if he roughly shuffled his feet against the earth. That would have to be good enough. After a few minutes of kicking and scooping with the vial, there was only about a centimeter of dirt at the bottom of the palm-wide length. Clammy sweat was running down his temples at the exertion. He sighed, his breath puffing in the cool air.
he mutters, shrugging John off with slow movements.
It seemed as though Sherlock’s secrets went far beyond London, possibly even into the villages west of Dartmoor. The signs seemed to point, oddly enough, to John’s small town of Stansex. But that was impossible, it had to be. England was far too big, and Stansex was far too specific. Something didn’t add up, and it ate at John’s spine terribly.
He squeezed the phone between his shoulder and ear, but nothing could stop the cane from falling over, his hands grappling thin air. He cursed lightly under his breath. “Yeah, and ‘fine’ is my answer to that. Really. Mum already offered, and my answer was the same. I’ve already got a flat, anyways.” With a sharp jab with his good knee, the door opened. John shuffled the cane inside and kicked the door back closed.
“Then ask me,” John replies, breathlessly.
LOG 1.01
Before he could leave, he felt a hand brush his arm. It was as quick as a breath, and John already felt the goosebumps arise from the chill.
Lestrade’s eyes flicked to John, and then back to him, and he sighed. “She’s not going anywhere,” he muttered, but otherwise nodded them towards the taped-off building. “Besides, while you consult, I’m sure that me and - John, was it? - can have a bit of a chat.”
don’t think I should drink anymore. Ever.”
Sherlock nodded, the beginnings of his usual blush blooming in his cheeks. “Yes. Good. John, would you be… well, would you like to join me for lunch?”
John stifled a groan.
A thump, and Sherlock bellowed: “PINK!”
Sherlock seemed torn, as if he wanted to tell John but also needed to leave. “Walk with me to the elevators,” he nearly pleaded. “If you change your mind towards helping me, then you’re free to turn around.”
He was hammered. His eyes were hazy and body swung, and he only had enough mind to hang up his Belstaff before stumbling further towards the room, all legs while he swayed. He was looking at John with utmost attention in such a state, the most he’s given in nearly a month. John didn’t blame him for the ignoring, but it still felt achingly wonderful to feel those sharp eyes on him once again, at whatever capacity.
Sherlock’s mouth was dry, lips chapped. He fumbled the condom onto himself with uncoordinated fingers, and then reached up to run his hands down John’s neck. “Alright,” Sherlock breathed.
“I’m sorry?” John asked. What would he have to say, when the man beside him was infinitely more interesting?
Indeed. “Why humor it?” John repeated, dazed. Sherlock nodded, obviously pleased, and he kept his hands cradling John’s head. The ambulance was closing in on Baker Street if the wail was anything to go by, and when John looked up he swore he saw more than fourteen people. Did they multiply, or did his vision?
,” John says, purposefully ignoring that little tidbit, “I was in med school, you were in your last year of secondary, presumably. Just wondering, is all. If we had met then.”
John couldn’t help the grin spreading across his cheeks. “Can you deduce me, then? Tell me my story?”
John. I know you can. Cloning has been the only mode of reproduction available to humanity for the last thousand years. Say, for example, every single human used to have an AB negative blood type. Therefore, through cloning, every person
It’s still too vague to tell. Someone from the homeless network clears her throat, her name something like ‘Melinda’ as far as John remembers, and she sings, pointedly,
He smiled fondly. “No, not France. Yet another clever deduction. Now, where else did they hurt you?”
“You’re kidding,” John whispered, squeezing the muscles beneath his fingers. They yielded slightly, like a cast made of thin metal. “You’re making a joke.”
Hopefully.
His voice dropped a whole octave, one that John could feel in his spine. “I’ll handle it.”
“John, I’ll meet you back at the hotel tonight,” Sherlock murmured, eyes never leaving Mary. It was almost a surrender. “Mary, nice to meet you.”
John’s curiosity was surely not the only reason he was given this list, not with those awfully sharp eyes trained so intently on John’s. Shifting uncomfortably, John ran his eyes over the array of faces and ignored the stare. Some of the people were familiar, but not enough for him to recall exactly how he knew them. On the fourth page, something lurched in John’s mind, and his fingers reached out to brush the printed face of a relatively young woman. Who
She closed her eyes, as if counting her breaths to measure them, only to open them and look anywhere but John. “It’s, um, the summer solstice banquet in a week. June 20
But then Sherlock pulled back, mask still strapped over his mouth. The sudden movement made John realize he hadn’t been breathing, himself, and his abrupt inhale brought that same intoxicating scent onto his palate. At that, he felt himself pushing more support onto his cane.
“It’s 12:01 in Kathmandu now.”
“I’m not sure that word even exists,” Sherlock protested.
John wants many things. He’s not sure words can handle the weight of it all.
The bed and breakfast was in the best condition he’d ever seen, bursting with spring-grown flowers of all shapes and colors. Before he walked in, though, he hesitated.
Another AI. John tried to control his distaste. He wasn’t inherently racist, after all, but this was different, wasn’t it? John didn’t exactly have a pleasant history with the kind. The man sat at the chair across from him gracefully, hooking his umbrella around the arm of his chair. His eyes were vacant of anything other than calculation, a tell-tale sign of being made of wires, and his movements were far too measured.
“Sherlock…” He began nervously. “About last night…”
John grumbled something unintelligible but became hyper-aware of his own legs, how they stretched and bent and pulled without even the smallest twinge of pain, imagined or not. “I was afraid to bring it up earlier,” John admitted. “If I did, it would remind my brain it was forgetting something, and then the limp would be back with a vengeance.”
and...? John had made it perfectly clear that it didn’t mean anything, same with all of the times before. Even at his stag night when both men were similarly inebriated and the possibility was there, John was almost aggressively ‘not interested’. It was not a possibility anymore, if him being drunk was ever classified as ‘interested’ in the first place.
John huffed out in a snort, taking off the mask once he was sure his breath had returned. The atmosphere was insufficient to breathe in when under stress, but normal breathing patterns seemed to work fine. He offered the mask to Sherlock, but the man waved it away and stood up to his full height.
"It starts off slowly," Sherlock explained, watching the passengers enter and exit the carriage from his vantage point. "It can’t go straight into its maximum speed initially, so it clears the dome altogether before hitting hyper speed. We’ll be jumping just before it rips us off.”
Every time John’s feet hit the ground, he felt the impact in his teeth. He whipped through the cemetery, flying past tombs and scenery that
“John,” Sherlock greeted, returning back to his microscope, though keeping his eyes trained on the other man above as he went into the kitchen and rummaged for a glass. “How are you feeling?”

There’s no understanding, only randomized generating to simulate unpredictability and mental advancement. You’re a simple machine. You will never be able to
Sherlock was knocked hurriedly into the bathroom wall before the door even closed, lips unyielding against his neck and hands already at his fly. John’s stubble dragged against his skin roughly. “Eager, are we?” Sherlock gasped.
ME: Interesting little ramble. Who put that argument in your arsenal, then? A bored intern?
regret this. He takes in a great big breath to clear his head, then releases it, and finds that it didn’t help in the slightest. “... Sure.”
The first night back at the flat after the accident was the first night John dreamed of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock’s sigh is completely overdramatic. “Yes, John. Whenever I was an adolescent, and my hormones had pushed my emotions towards ridiculous heights, I had engaged in a… frivolous romance.” There’s bitterness in his voice. “The mistake was never repeated.”
He demanded.
“I liked it,” he muttered, crowding John against the mantle above the fireplace, “I liked it whenever you got drunk. Don’t get me wrong, you completely ruined me body and soul each and every time, but I
“Yes, well,” was all that John could say, the wound still bright. Sherlock didn’t
ME: Oh, it was Mycroft. He has a big fat nose and a propensity to drift it into my business.
Sherlock’s lips quirked. “I’m thirty six, actually. Around a decade off.”
“I don’t know, did I get any of it right?”
Sherlock grunted and shook his head. “Need more data,” he managed. But then he stopped and turned to John, face careful and oddly bright despite his exhaustion.
Mike laughs, then goes back to leaning against his wife. Greg’s loudly flubbing all the words, but he’s making a valiant effort.
Sherlock tilted his face down and to the side, so he could meet John’s eyes above his glasses. His lashes were dark and full. “No,” he murmured.
“So, Diane,” he started conversationally, wiping at the windows with a sponge and thick gloves. The experiment had been more explosive than expected, and the person he was assisting was worryingly carefree about it. “Do you know who Sherlock Holmes is?”
There was a badge at his waist. Sherlock straightened his shoulders and sniffed, voice monotone despite his dancing eyes. “A series of mundane suicides that have no reason to be linked together? I can hardly contain myself.”
“Precisely why I didn’t mention it, either,” Sherlock said, but it was distractedly. Quite redundantly, he nodded up towards the rickety building that seemed like it couldn’t hold a body, let alone dozens. “Let’s save this conversation for later, the crime scene’s up ahead and I can smell the cyanide from here.”
John nearly asked, before the reason made itself perfectly clear and he locked his jaw closed.
A hint of teeth. “A shame,” he murmured. “I should probably show you, instead.”
“No problem, Molly. How’s the morgue? Anything interesting?”
He’s not sure if that makes him brave or a coward.
John closed his eyes again, suddenly exhausted. The heart monitor betrayed his reaction to the words. “Just… no more of that, unless you want my blood pressure to
“I, er, actually have plans. I’m going down near Plymouth, to visit my father’s grave. The 21
John looks at him for a long moment, still, and then nods. “Okay,” he agrees, and then lugs up his bag to his lap.
Sherlock shook his head, but didn’t reply. Rolling his shoulders, he called the computer back and hovered his finger over the manual ‘resume’. He watched John expectantly. “Will you help me?”
Sherlock spares a glance and Rosie, where she’s dozing off on John’s shoulder. He quirks his lips. “No, not today. I’m sure I couldn’t even make a decent sound, given the chance.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Me, obviously.”
be beautiful, if not for the frenzy he was caught in, keeping his eyes straight ahead in single-minded focus. He felt terrified. He felt exhilarated. He felt
He hummed, utterly focused on the task at hand. “I loathe to ask what.”
The morgue should have been utterly boring, but Sherlock made sure it was anything but.
John’s eyes darkened, and he flung off his vest and grappled Sherlock by his waistband, tugging both trousers and pants down in a jerking movement without undoing them. Sherlock had slimmed considerably during his time away, so his clothes hardly fit anymore. John went to brush off Sherlock’s half-drawn shirt, but Sherlock grabbed his wrist with sudden importance.
John chuckled. “He’s really not that bad, once you…” He really didn’t know where he was going with the statement.
Sherlock ducked his head, oddly sheepish, and fluttered back off to the kitchen. John watched after him in brief puzzlement before shaking his head, ready to open up the paper. Instead, Mrs. Hudson chose that moment to come back into the flat with something in her hands.
Well. There it is. A strange sort of thrill ran up John’s spine, the words finally spoken having a bigger impact on him than he’d have thought. A shiver racked him.
was even more flawless, pores virtually invisible and skin milky white, unscarred. Those dark eyes rolled at the whispered words, and he tore off his mask as if to speak. His lips were rosy and plush, John couldn’t help but notice, and cheekbones sharp enough to cut.

And yet, despite that, he always takes the gamble.

was going to let me use her equipment for a theory that I mentioned yesterday. Not exactly related to Exodus, but interesting in its own right.”
Her eyes alit with an emotion so strong that John had to take a step backward. “Tell him,” she demanded, something fierce and out of character flashing across her face. “Do you have any idea the pain you’ve caused him? Just as he has no idea the pain he’s caused you? Oh, you
But he knew it was right. “No,” Sherlock groaned, bucking his hips to wring a gasp from the man beneath him. “Not while you’re drunk.”
“I got it!” John yelled, barely restraining a growl of frustration. As he was scratching his head over the problem, though, Sherlock called him back.
“Vampire,” John said.
tried
A whiff of familiar fragrance, and then the men restraining John were ripped away, like a giant hand from the sky had plucked them up and off. With pure military instinct, John dove forward and immediately disarmed the knife-wielder with a jab to the wrist, kicking out his legs from beneath him. He pressed his foot hard against the man’s throat.
Not that it had any right to be. They were pushing on two months together in the flat, a roomy two-bedroom-one-bath just over the sandwich shop they'd had lunch at. Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, was only too happy to have the company, if her frequent not-so-subtle hinting of their ‘romantic’ relationship was anything to go by. Sherlock worked with the police, as he had told John during that first week, and while he never discussed any of it with John, there was a mysterious man by the name of 'Lestrade' who, at a phone call, could whisk the madman away for most of the day. John was half relieved that he wasn't expected to tag along, while also half utterly, maddeningly curious about it all.
“I had bad days.”
Inside, the facility was rearranging itself like a great box folding in on itself, morphing into whatever layout the next activity required. John finished off his own bottle with a lesser, answering smile. “You had some training, at least. You should be more worried about me handling lives.”
Seventy years ago, limb from limb. John, striking his head on the curb as Sherlock pushed him out of the way of the incoming car. His hand outstretched, paint under his nails, a dent in the metal. It should’ve taken roughly
, grow up, I’m not talking about sex. Well, a bit. Disregard.
“Simmons is working the first quadrant of the inverter ring,” the overseer murmured to Dimmock, though loud enough for John to hear. “He’s by himself. If something happened…”
John was suddenly struck with the imagery of
one in weeks and so painfully familiar that Sherlock felt his heart nearly stop beating. “You can’t take me to a gay club and not expect me to dance,” he said innocently.
His smile grew at that, but he shook his head and nodded towards Northumberland street. “Later,” he promised, and the sharp-eyed detective was back and ready to play. “We have work to do tonight.”
The stoplight was red, which gave Sherlock a chance to minutely sink into his seat. All of a sudden, exhaustion seemed to take home in every line of his body. “John,” he said. “Whenever I got to the cemetery, I did something. I nearly… the man there, I held him up by his throat, and if you hadn’t interfered…” He huffed out a breath. “I wasn’t doing that for lack of thought.”
“I’ll take this one,” Sherlock says. He blinks down to Rosie’s face, who can’t keep her eyes open nor her head from lolling onto his shoulder, and murmurs, “Are you ready for bed, Watson? I’ll read you a story, if you’d like.” She doesn’t seem to have noticed the change in person. John cups her head and leans forward to press a kiss to her temple.
Sherlock made an embarrassingly high noise that John quickly swallowed down in a nipping kiss. “Quickly, now,” he warned, shucking down Sherlock’s trousers and pants only far enough to free his cock. His hand was sliding in a hot grip with delicious heat. “We can’t be gone long.”
Sherlock tilt his head back, so the words are spoken against John’s mouth. “As long as you’ll have me,” he murmurs.
“For now,” John repeated, incredulous. “Are you going to do something later?”
Sherlock paused before moving into action. “Can you say anything other than yes?”
“Get some sleep, it’s nearly 3 AM,” John said sometime during the third week, having gotten up for a drink of water. Sherlock was in the same position he was four hours ago, seated by the window with his hands clasped in his lap. The moon’s reflection bathed his face, and his irises were an unnerving black whenever he turned to look at John. Luckily, there seemed to be no malice in his face despite his prior moods the last few days.
Sarah, the front desk receptionist, seemed to be there every day John was. She was sweet, trading greetings and goodbyes whenever John passed, and in turn John liked to drop off a coffee on the days he had a morning shift.
John watched him oddly, watched the play of emotions on his face like sunlight on a riverbed. “So there’s a possibility that we’re being stalked?”
ME: What I mean, is there anything in particular I should be calling you?
‘Pale’.
She turned away, fiddling with a microscope. “He told me, John.”
He licked his lips. “RJ,” he began, suddenly unsure. “I... know you’ve been following me.”
"It ranges across the scale, how people initially feel about him. Beautiful, to heart-stopping, to downright terrifying. At first, most people are dying to get his attention around here. Until he talks, that is." After a beat, Mike nudged him in the side. "You alright, mate?"
ME: …
John remembers, and figures that it’s a subject better left untouched.
Sherlock coughed into his beer. “John?” He asked quietly.
A laugh, and then: “Mary Morstan, from Stansex?”
isn’t it?”
“Oh, sorry!” John apologized, though he wasn’t sure for what. He held out a hand, but the man wove him away. When he stood, his cheeks were darkening quickly and his eyes seemed glassy, roaming over John’s body with a startled air.
“Actually-“
‘Historical traits of vampires’.
“Just past eleven.” He set John with a slightly disapproving look. “You didn’t sleep last night, did you?”
“Not… really,” John said slowly. “I’m actually perfectly fine the way things are.”
John’s eyebrows flew up to his hairline, and suddenly the fact that he was speaking to a machine was the farthest thing from his mind. The DSE Intrepid? The object of everyone’s collective taxes, the ship that was going to fly off into space and find a new Earth to colonize? And the First Officer wanted to meet with
“I can…” John offered with a slur.
Right. John was just getting ready to give up, already sitting to his own meal, before Sherlock heaved a dramatic sigh and flung the book off to the side. Never taking his annoyed glare off of John, he pushed the too-red pill between his lips and chased it with water, and then speared the pasta with his fork. There was a slight grimace on his face, as if the action of eating disgusted him, and with infinite grace he shovelled ravioli after ravioli into his mouth. He chewed methodically and forcefully, his jaw popping from disuse, and when the plate reached exactly half of its original content, Sherlock dropped his fork and pushed it all away.
“Please, Sherlock. I insist.” He cracked a smile, something crooked and handsome even from where John stood, half behind a corner. “Could you do a favor for me, then?”
“He knows.”
hasn’t thrown any deductions John’s way. At first John was glad: knowing that Sherlock couldn’t tell his deep dark insecurities was a plus, no matter how you looked at it. And then, odd as it sounded, John began to worry; was there something wrong with him? Was this some sort of warning sign? Just another bullet point to the list of Sherlock’s eccentricities, John eventually decided. Best to move on.
John chuckled, the thought of Sherlock lifting weights popping up in his mind. Somehow, it wasn’t as ridiculous as it should be. “Do you need me to spot you?”
“No, I believe you,” John acquiesced. He didn’t, but that was the best he was getting for now. Sherlock seemed satisfied. “The most important question of all, why in the
It didn’t help that despite the tense atmosphere, he was still just so
John felt the chip buzz to life, and he couldn’t help a wince at the sensitivity. “I really hate this thing,” John grumbled.
This was right. If there was one thing in this bloody universe that was fair, it was the fact that Sherlock Holmes was meant for John Watson and who cared if the Earth circled the moon or the sun? What did that
“To the hull. The engine room.” There was a doorway, but Sherlock motioned John off to the side so it wouldn’t sense them and automatically slide open. He met John’s eyes steadily. “I need you to cover me to the center of the hull, where the landing thrusters are being prepared. From there, on the right wall there’s an exit and a cleansing station as well for the engineers. I can use that for coming back aboard.”
notice it, and I still hate it.” He copied the stance the chip presented to him. “Are you ready?”
“Stansex. Great history of the namesake, one that I can’t for the life of me remember.”
Sherlock was caught off-guard for a moment, surprised that John didn’t question more about the earlier incident, but he recovered rather quickly. “Oh, John, I thought you’d never ask.” And then John’s favorite grin slid on Sherlock’s face, the crooked one that nudged his eyes and made him look so achingly
John felt himself smile, and popped an artificial stalk of broccoli in his mouth. “Apology accepted.” When he looked at Sherlock’s face, though, his smile dropped immediately. “God!” he blurted out.

thinking it all over, too cowardly to even broach the subject. The whole point of all of this was to wait until he was ready, before going on and taking the final step, the leap of faith. Breaking down the only barrier that still divides them. He doesn’t know what he’s going to say, what he even
But Sherlock was averting his eyes, desperately trying to look anywhere other than in the face of the man he... he...
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, hands dropping so he could grab John’s arse and press them closer. At that, John came with a hiss between them, slicking and tightening his grasp until Sherlock was positive that he only needed another stroke to completion. When John halted his movement, Sherlock protested and went to finish himself off.
The hospital's director remembered him, that much was clear. Whether it was from the high test scores or the infamous girl fever he’d had at the time, he wasn’t sure. Regardless, John was in for the job and started on Monday, where he would be on beaker duty, and for that he was grateful.
He drummed his fingers impatiently. “Determining if I had any sort of significant other, a valid topic for new flatmates to inquire about.”
On the nights when John can’t quite keep his eyes closed, the even breathing of his daughter across the room doing nothing to soothe him to sleep, he instead draws himself into his own meager mind palace that Sherlock knows nothing about.
Inside, both Mind and Heart at his shoulder, the words John Watson had always left unspoken were suddenly and completely obvious. The pain, the grief. The bravery. Sherlock opened his eyes inside of the padded cell, looking directly into his soul without ambiguity. The words John had always meant to say but never did, the words that John had kept from the world but left imprinted in his footsteps.
Sherlock

onto the table, a balanced variety of just enough randomness to avoid a pattern. The tiny makeup box nearly falls off the table, but John catches it with a quick hand. “Happy Christmas, Birthday, Halloween, Easter… all of that.”
“Oh, okay,” Thomas said simply, tension draining from his shoulders. That had to be a massive perk when it came to dealing with men; for the most part, they didn’t feel the need to pry. An uncomfortable rock sat in John’s stomach, and he had to level his breathing.
John Watson has been in love twice before in his entire life, and each time ended in disaster.
Sherlock opened his mouth, and then closed it. “I’m fast.”
John shifted further up his bed into a half-slouch, head filled with cotton and pain. His words came out in a quiet groan amidst the beeping machines. “So something

Despite himself, Sherlock chuckled, if lackluster. “I’m a

you were. In me.”
“It’s... important,” he says slowly, fists clenching and unclenching on his thighs. He feels flayed open by Sherlock’s rapid-fire accusations, so familiar and so much more cutting than he remembers, and it’s just this side of too much. He swallows. “It’s definitely important, it’s... something I need to know. There’s a reason. I can’t… I can’t say why, yet. Can’t tell you exactly. Not until I can come to terms with it myself.” He looks up towards the doorway, heart hammering so hard he might pass out. Anxiety thrums his blood. “Alright?”
“Do you have a date yet?” She asked lightly, feigning disinterest. John knew she was feigning, as her cheeks were a tad darker than earlier and her eyes kept flickering up to his face.
Sherlock sighed noisily and turned, sitting himself normally on the couch so he could level a glare. “Does your visit have a point other than voicing the equivalent to ‘I told you so’?”
“The first song you play for me,” John deadpans, “and it’s
“It’s Sunday, so I’ll cut you all a bit of slack. The neuron-chips are programmed with personalized exercises for the next hour in the weight room, and after you’re done and logged you’re free to leave.” The facility was doing that grand folding thing again, the floor opening up to rolling contraptions and a variety of forthcoming exercise machines. When it was all settled, Lestrade hopped onto the floor. “Dismissed.”
John snorted. “How about in human terms? Most people don't count in decimals, you know.”
John switched back to handheld, stabbing the button out of spite. “I would love a new phone, actually. I have nothing else to offer you, unless you want me to cook you up some gourmet frozen fish fingers.”
ME: Oh, this ought to be good. How much time do you have?
“RJ,” John said slowly, brows furrowed. He glanced back up at Sherlock. “I think his name is RJ.”
It’s quiet. Past the heater, John can hear the barely-there susurrus of snowflakes settling onto the ground in mounds, even through the window. A car passes, slow and careful atop the unpredictable frost, and John relates to it on a personal level. He hesitates. “Last night. Or this morning, rather. I’m sorry I couldn’t… well. I got scared.”
John’s face broke just a bit, and it was beautiful. It was a glimpse of the John that felt fierce things and wasn’t afraid to show it. “A mistake,” he repeated, jaw tensing and untensing. “Right.”
Sherlock let out a groan, cutting it off at the end in a choke with John did something devilish with his tongue. There was the tear of foil, and John’s fingers were slick and probing at his entrance. Sherlock widened his stance automatically.
In Islington, there’s a pedestrian road named Camden’s Passage that is the bulk of the antique stalls, already bustling with people on the Saturday morning, nearly noon. Predictably, Rosie whinges roughly two minutes into the journey from the cab, across the street, and to the passage, stubbornly refusing to walk, so Sherlock scoops her up and atop his shoulders with practiced ease.
“Idiot,” Sherlock chides softly, his voice not as smooth as he was probably trying to make it. With a small smile, he picks up his guitar and reclaims his armchair. “Go on, then,” he says. “I’ll be here.”
“By Sector A, it seems.”
Thirteen was studying him openly, brown eyes darting around his face as he tried to see if John had some sort of ulterior motive. When nothing was forthcoming, the boy nodded. “That’s fine,” he said simply.
John furrowed his brows. “Like what?”
“I get nappies, you get

God, but it’s been years. Sherlock bit and slid his way into John’s mouth with vague familiarity of his movements, following John down to press him into the mattress. John, despite his not inconsiderable state of mind, was pleasantly skillful as he used his tongue, one hand threaded through Sherlock’s curls and the other kneading at his arse.
” Sherlock asked desperately.
John furrowed his eyebrows. “Where’s what?”
“You’re the one who tells me that ‘curiosity should never be ignored’. So.”
“Sorry, sorry,” John managed, both hands occupied with bags as he bustled into the living room. He unloaded onto the counter, rolling his left shoulder from the previous strain and striding over to Mary to drop a kiss onto her cheek. He clapped Sherlock’s shoulder as way of greeting. The touch lingered. “The line at the Thai place was awful. Were you both waiting for long?”
go through the cleansing station beforehand to kill bacteria, and wear a protective face mask
Sherlock’s head shot up, surprise and (familiar) frustration lacing his features. “
Warmth pooled in John’s belly, but he still felt awfully tense. Leaning further on his cane, he scratched at his head with a shaking hand. “Alright, then. I… I’m glad to hear that. And, er, likewise.”
And then he strode past John purposefully, nearly brushing his shoulder. He smelled of chemicals and plastic, but underneath it all was something electric that called John’s blood to attention. It was utterly unfair, that a man who held such hatred towards him could stir at John’s very bones, like a magnet to metal. Even when being horribly rude, John could not help but feel an urge for contact, as if he were at a museum with explicit instructions not to touch the exhibits. He had to. There was no question, it was merely instinctual.
Mycroft knew that, apparently, as he added: “Doctor Watson has a stunning arm on him, don’t you think? Or was that his forehead?”
John’s tired of hearing that. “Why, were you the one who shot her?”
“It’s not worth it, mate,” John tried, eyes scanning the skyline as if it would miraculously provide a ladder up to a rooftop that didn’t exist. Surprisingly, none existed. The man in the gate took a step forward, slow and patient, and his smirk became visible in the light.
could clock in for a shift, once in awhile,” he mutters darkly.
“Yep.”
Sherlock almost looked affronted, head tipping back to face John incredulously. "I've done nothing disingenuous to warrant that, you know."
At work, the scent of blood seemed to cling to John’s clothes as more and more people piled in to donate. He had never been bothered by the smell, being a doctor and all, but Sherlock alerted something about it that morning. As he drew the next donor’s pint, he felt himself practically tasting the salt-and-copper tang of her blood at the back of his tongue. He scrunched his nose, feeling a tad green. The woman he was drawing from gave him an odd look. John, awkward as ever, patched her up early and sent her on her way.
John huffed out a sigh. “Look, mate, I’ve only just met you, and I’m not-”
John chuckled. “It won’t be too bad, at least you’ll have me.”
ME: Better.
They’ve touched before. They’ve even
He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “That was reckless, Sherlock. You could have died.
later, I’m at my wit’s end.” He stops by the hatrack, suddenly, utterly deflated, and pinches the bridge of his nose. “John,” he says tiredly. “Why do you need to know?”
After both Sherlock and John managed to exit the cab without injuring themselves (though John had hit his shin somehow on the curb and Sherlock was rubbing at his funny bone), both men stared up at the neon-bright building they were standing before.
John was beginning to stare, and Sherlock cocked his head in curiosity. He quickly averted his eyes, just in time for Lestrade’s voice to sound from the center of the facility.
But by the third night, John eating alone in the dining hall at 21:00, the character himself made a reappearance.
His friend was already walking away. “I can handle myself, John,” he shot over his shoulder, though it was more playful than rude. With a snort, John spun on his heel towards the cardio machines to begin on his own exercises.
The universe throws them together until they’re
“Yes, fine,” John said distractedly, trying to blink himself back into clear-headedness.
John swatted his arse half-heartedly, and their soft laughs mingled together into the sun’s dim golden haze. They slept until nightfall. And after that, well, life was just fine. All fine.
“Um, yes, alright,” he said hurriedly. He swallowed, eyes darting around the cabin and out the window, catching sight of a Tesco. “We’re out of milk,” he settled on.
“I can’t,” John stated, a tad too gruffly. He immediately felt bad; it wasn’t Thomas’s fault that Molly and Sarah had already eaten up his patience, after all, so he cooled it down. “I’m going out of town, family stuff.”
‘Yes,’ Sherlock mouthed.
“That was an awful attempt at humor, John.” His half-smile said otherwise. John shivered at the sound of his name in that voice. Other than the glitch earlier, Sherlock was lively this morning, all long strides and rapid movements. He still wore the surgical mask, but it didn’t seem to bother him any.
“...”
It was before John had
“The crime scene,” Sherlock said. Before John could reply, he continued to Sarah, “Did Lestrade give any details?”
“She’s a beauty, and has been sittin’ on her stand for far too long. You interested?”
John’s never had an inclination for the classics, but he’d always moderately enjoyed them in school, things like Shakespeare’s
Sherlock huffed, a moment of peace in the rolling storm. “You’re the only one who drinks it.”
“Yes,” said John.
Fantastic. What year am I in?”
Inside the restaurant, no one even glanced down to notice that Sherlock was barefoot, everyone too busy staring in wonderment at his face. “Table for two, please. Somewhere a bit private if you don’t mind.”
John shook his head. “Oh, it’s nothing, just- well. A memory.”
After John hung up and figured that fiddling with the TV for twenty minutes wasn’t worth it, he decided to take a stroll.
The next morning, Sherlock was at his microscope when John emerged from the shower. He glanced up, taking what he could from observation. Eyes hooded, movements careful: hungover. He had shaved, though there was a slight cut on his cheek. Still drunk? No, it’s been 10 hours, give or take; malnourished. Low blood sugar, shaky. He wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes, even though he knew he was there.
A pause. “Like shit,” John admitted, pouring water from the tap. “That’s the last time I go to a coworker’s birthday party.”
“I’m assuming that you’re the Chief of Medical?”
fiancée.”
“Usually I stay at the town he’s buried in northeast of here, if I stay at all,” John said, straining his eyes for a motel. “There’s a small bed and breakfast there, but it’s only one bed and, like I said, rather small. I’ve never come here the day before, so I figured Plymouth would be a better idea.”
He fisted his hands against the ground, and his left hand skipped the hardened ground and reached into nothing. Oh, god, they were terrifyingly close to the cliff of the canyon.
“The woman had seduced a man, convinced him to fall in love with her. From Sherlock Holmes, I’d imagine. He found the both of them in the middle of town and went berserk. From what my grandmother said, Sherlock Holmes ripped the limbs from the man, and began devouring the body.”
“Welcome home, John,” came the security system of his home. While John was typically unnerved by the thought of getting too close to AI technology, he could stomach it when it kept his home secure. He slid off his shoes with a sigh, and was ready to take a shower before a familiar chime alerted his ears.
John leaned against the window that separated them, elbow to the glass wiping tears from his eyes. “That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done, I’d think.”
That was a bit not-good, he was sure, but John was a bit not-good anyways.
“Drunk driving, meaning he was the driver. Floored it straight into a tree. Night of his birthday, matter of fact.” John shrugged. He had loved his father, but he had known that his alcoholism would be the end of him. “It hurt for a while, but it also forced me to take life a bit more seriously. I’m realizing now that he’s probably the reason I went into the army.”
Heavy breathing, and Sherlock’s eyes were blown wide. John came back to himself in increments, finally relaxing himself with a defeated sigh. In the slack, Sherlock shifted and felt that John was hard.
“Good,” John said with a nod, shoulders relaxing as if he just shrugged off an invisible weight. “I promise, it’ll never happen again,” he added. He then disappeared back into the kitchen, more than likely to fix some breakfast.
Out on the sidewalk, John risked a glance back up to the flat. Sherlock stood in the window, arms crossed and eyes trained on John, but he made no move to show that he was guilty. Typical. With a sigh, John looked both ways and crossed the street, determined to be back at the flat before the day reached its peak heat.
Lestrade protested, like this was a common occurrence. “Come on, you were only in there for a minute!”
It would. Sherlock tilted his head up, hoping that he was meeting John’s eyes. John was exactly 172.5 centimeters tall. John had eyes the color of the Atlantic whenever you were halfway to America, and while Sherlock could imagine the hue in perfect clarity he would give anything to see it in person again, right now. Here. His hair was probably damp with sea salt itself, almost fully silver now with stubborn streaks of gold in the back. Sherlock trailed his fingers until they were pressing lightly against the inside of John’s wrist.
“- beautiful,” John finished for him. Mike chuckled from beside him.
John nodded. “Several.”
Sherlock hushed him, neck craning to peer at the people swarming around the main entrance. Above Sherlock’s training uniform was a great black coat, hanging open at the front and completely incongruent with the skin-tight fabric beneath. He looked a bit better with what sleep he was able to get, at least. While their hiding place was a tad dramatic, crouched side-to-side behind artificial foliage, it served its purpose just fine. "You have little faith, Watson," he murmured in a light tone.
“Usually, the trip is more of a private affair,” John said warily, face betraying his doubt.
“Right,” John said with an easy smile.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, lowering himself into his own armchair opposite John’s. With John this slouched and Sherlock this tall, their feet nearly touched. “Even Mrs. Hudson could make that deduction.” His next words were quiet. “Are you having nightmares?”
He was either an idiot, or bloody brilliant. With an incredulous grin, John did as he was told, beginning to swing the rope parallel to the ring with great pushes of strength. It took a bit of momentum, but soon the end of the rope was nearly brushing the sides of the great ring, though considerably higher up.
John grinned for the first time since he’d been shot, keeping up with Mike’s leisurely strides easily. “Then this will either be very good or colossally bad, depending on his memory.”
Second, with a man named James Sholto.
“… Of course.” John shot him a strange look, but just like the rest of the madman’s mysteries, he let it go. “Are you packed for tomorrow, then?”
Sherlock spun away, oddly robotic in his movements rather than graceful. Had John stepped over a line?
“I’m not a doctor anymore,” John protested. “More like a glorified custodian.”
John groaned again, returning to Sherlock’s lips with fervor and reaching around to his back to push his shirt up to his shoulder blades. Taking the hint, Sherlock sat up to strip himself of his shirt and taking the time to unbuckle his own trousers. John watched him with hooded eyes, and Sherlock had to close his eyes with a hiss of breath when a hand pressed deliciously into his hardening groin. “That’s...” he muttered breathlessly.
“When you told me what RJ said about energy reports, I did some digging,” Sherlock said, voice slightly wavering as he strode. “I’m not as talented in hacking as Thirteen, mind, but I do have the distinguishing ability to steal my brother’s access into the more hidden of files. I couldn’t get into much without a password, but I got into enough.” If he saw John’s name in any of the files, he didn’t admit it. “The energy reports have a peculiar trend over the last several hundred years that could be counted as a coincidence. Fortunately, I don’t believe in coincidences.”
The urge frightens him. John quickly chucks the fabric across the room as if burned, as far away from him as he can get it. Satisfied and more than a little uneasy, he picks Rosie up from her highchair to go get her dressed.
want a little brother,” he says over his shoulder.
The man blinked, seeming too surprised to muster up offense. “It’s, um, Dimmock. Sir.”
“Fuck off,” Sherlock growled. After putting up his coat he fell into the couch, back turned stubbornly to his brother. “If you’re bored, go destroy another third world country.”
rise. And we’d, y’know, prefer there to be no murders happening on the ship.”
Sherlock tensed. At first, John was afraid that he’d done the wrong thing. But then, with a high-pitched cry, Sherlock spun around and captured John’s lips with his own, pushing him desperately into the bathroom wall. Impatiently, he yanked John’s legs up around his waist. John yelped but otherwise held on for dear life. “Sherlock, I don’t think this is-”
ME: I’m certain I will. Farewell.
John shouted back incredulously.
That night, in John’s dreams, Sherlock stopped walking away. He kept his front turned and still ignored his name on John’s lips, but it was progress.
“I don’t make a habit of snogging with strangers I hardly know,” John managed whenever he reluctantly broke away for air.
actually work at the clinic doesn’t include Sundays. He hasn’t accidentally ruined one of Sherlock’s expensive shirts in the wash, not lately. “I’m sorry for yesterday?” He tries.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, doctor,” Sherlock said drily, “But I’d assume that shoving a wooden stake through any living thing’s heart would succeed in killing them, wouldn’t you agree?”
John didn’t know if it was a good idea, but he was going to say it anyway. “When I first saw you,” he said, “I thought you looked very familiar, almost as if we’ve met before. I don’t know where, or how, but… A name came to mind. Is ‘RJ’ alright? Can I call you that?”
“Oh, you’re... That’s nice. It sounds familiar.”
John whispers. The hand on Sherlock’s cheek drops back down to the center of his chest, where he kneads into the scar that his wife had made.
He let himself stay on the floor for a bit longer, hoping to get his breathing back to normal before booting up the next round. He rolled over to his stomach, arms braced beneath him and ready to push up. The mat was cool against his damp forehead, so he couldn’t help but linger more than strictly necessary. A voice broke him out of his reverie.
Sherlock was chuckling as John finished, dimples flashing. “I’d love to meet her too, then.”
He paused, feeling something quiet and deep reverberate into his abdomen. What was that? He glanced up to look for Sherlock, but the man wasn’t paying attention, face illuminated in the low light as he read his screen intently. Was another rail arriving? John couldn’t spot it along the track, but at that speed it could show up at any time.
“Ominous,” John mutters, but Sherlock only winks and snatches his coat, ruffling it behind him like a great big cape as he disappears through the front door. The stairs echo with his footsteps, as if he’s dropping down them three at a time. John has to remind himself that his flatmate is only
John drew up a blank. “Oh, er, hi?”
happen again seemed to bite annoyingly at him.
Huh. He supposed that was probably the more accurate way of putting it. “That’s true,” he agreed.
John meant to say something more, but Sherlock was already deep within the recesses of his mind. There’d be no getting him back for a while more, so John retired for the night.
John was in that hazy state between awake and asleep. “Mm,” he grumbled. “Good odd or bad odd?”
Maybe not so platonic, then. Even more conflicted than before, John settled back into his seat and nudged the volume up on the radio. Sherlock, face scrunched in contemplation, put both hands on the wheel in alternating fists while they continued their drive.
John quirked his lips. “You’re telling me,” he joked.
Back in Afghanistan, there were a straightforward set of rules.
“I’m always eager to help with the Yard’s cases as long as it isn’t a waste of my time,” Sherlock said offhandedly, scratching at the dried mud on his sleeve and thanking the gods he hadn’t worn his Belstaff today. He nudged John lightly. “Come on, John, let’s head home. I’m in need of a shower.”
“Sounds like you scared him off, Johnny.” She stretched her legs, socked feet propping up on the coffee table. “Whatever you did, he’s having none of it. Best to be rid of him.”
“Yes, of course. Commander. How are you?”
“Your leg,” he said simply, voice low in comparison to Mary’s bright one. “You’re walking without a limp.”
“Yes,” Sherlock voiced. After a beat he heard the front door close gingerly behind him, and the familiar steps up to the level above.
Sherlock knew of Stansex? Been there, even? Of course he had, he’s Sherlock. “And that would be?”
John felt guilty that he had to ask, as if John would say no. But that’s when he remembered something, his happiness starting to fade. “Are you sure you don’t have plans instead?” He questioned.
At first, he thinks it’s the telly, sounding out amidst Rosie’s giggling and the occasional cadence of Sherlock’s teachings. He’s taken to reciting the elements of the periodic table over and over to her, in hopes of sparking her inner scientist early, to no avail. But then, as John turns off the stove, he realizes exactly what he’s hearing and sneaks to the doorway to take an incredulous peak.
Sherlock was looking at him with something thoughtful. “You mean Molly,” he said slowly.
John hesitated with his vest, and his flaming eyes dimmed. “Tell me to leave,” he commanded with quiet fervor. “Tell me to put my clothes on and to go home, and I swear I will never expect this from you ever again.”
“It’s a match, then.” Sherlock’s lips spread into a full-blown grin, complete with ultra-white teeth and a crookedness that almost made John’s heart stop. He’s sure he would get tired of the man’s incredible beauty (he would
ME: Well, he
It’s too much, hearing it out loud. Knowing is different than acknowledging, and speaking makes it solidify into something tangible, something heavy. When a concept takes shape in the world, it can’t be ignored anymore no matter how hard you try. John meets his eyes and it feels like a challenge.
Oh, dear lord.
It’s a hit or a miss, whether Sherlock’s breakfasts are edible (John thinks back to the Cinnamon-Soil Mishap with a frown), but the eggs smell delicious and completely free of chemicals (or dirt), so he’ll take his chances. He sits down at the table, takes a sip of tea, and opens the newspaper.
“How long are you going to take?”
“… Right. Well. Last night in Stansex, you remember, when Mary told me that legend. About you. It feels like ages have gone by, but it’s only been a day. But, anyway, how you told me that ‘Stansex has a good memory’. It’s just, well… set off some sirens, to put it mildly. I made a list on things I’ve noticed about you, the things that are inhuman. In a word.” At Sherlock’s silence, he carefully continued.
“Beautiful,” he muttered, then unable to stop his eyes from closing and head from falling against the mattress. Sherlock lingered for a moment, catching his breath, before standing unsteadily on his feet.
“Well, there’s always a reason for a visit, good doctor.”
John smiled grimly. “You don’t know what I deserve.”
“But you don’t know a thing about medicine, do you, doctor?”
It didn’t even register as a kiss until John started yearning for something more. Now, every time he thinks of it, the skin between his mouth and the hinge of his jaw stings like razor-burn, and he wishes the homophobic serial killer would just break out of prison already so Sherlock can kiss him again.
a noticeable reaction.”
He turned his head, only to find Sherlock holding one of the men in midair with just a hand at his throat. His eyes were as wild as his unruly hair, the latter looking as if he’d been pulling at it with restless fists, and his teeth were bared dangerously, like some sort of wild animal. His feet, for whatever reason, were filthy and bare.
John’s hand gripped painfully, the stuttering of an earthquake in his fingers. “I... I have to...”
John licked his lips free of sweat. He was never the first to resort to begging, but his sense of self-preservation far outweighed his pride. “Look, whatever he’s paying you, I’ll pay double. It’ll take some time, but-“
Sherlock met his eyes steadily through the pane, deadly serious and eerily pale in the lighting. Was he sweating? John met his gaze straight back, trying to signify harshness through the set of his brow. Above them, a voice sounded to announce the ten-minute mark to launch, and to ready at your stations.
Though the man was still facing straight ahead, John swore he felt his eyes on him. “And boyfriends?”
John thinks bitterly. He hopes the universe understands sarcasm.
There’s only one memory he’s intent on keeping safe.
Sherlock says quietly, “don’t you know?”
John was shaking his head as Sherlock spoke. “Nnnnn-“
There was pulsating music coming from inside. “Seems more like a gay club to me,” John said with uncertainty.
“Yeah, he’s real. I know, I know, he’s-“
“No girlfriends, as well?”
And he was gone. John frowned at the doors still swinging shut from his departure.
“For someone who doesn’t live on human food,” he said with a yawn, knowing (now) Sherlock would hear him anyway, “you certainly know how to cook it.”
John took a few more breaths, and held up his hands in a thumbs up. Sherlock nodded once, seemingly satisfied, and pushed back into a crouch. He leaned towards the right, studying the darkness just inches beside them.
“He loved her,” Sherlock hoarsed. “He chose her and married her and vowed to spend his life with her. And she’s evil, she’s...
ME: This was a ridiculous idea. I’m not going to waste my time on an unthinking machine.
“Humor me. Please,” she pushes. Her eyes are oddly bright.
“Are you-”
Sherlock blinks back to the present, and immediately picks back up his strumming, almost instinctually. Before the next verse, he smirks, but the pinkness of his cheeks betrays him. “I’m betting on it.”
“I’ll get you some clothes,” Sherlock finally said, eyes careful on John for any sort of reaction. He just nodded. With tight lips, Sherlock ducked into his room for a cotton tee, pyjama bottoms and a spare dressing gown. John didn’t have any clothes left behind at 221B, having used his spare set after getting caught in the sewers during one of the last cases they were together on. One month and three days ago.
“Hm.” John steps off to the side to perch on the desk, studying the flat; without his daughter here, it seems much too big and much too empty. He raps his knuckles on the tabletop and looks back to Sherlock. “I’d like to hear you play it, though.”
ME: And who told you to do that?
John’s not even sure he’d say yes. No, there’s no chance that they’re living together again, unfortunately, not unless Sherlock asks them to himself. John scoffs at the thought.
“You won’t punish them,” Lestrade accused, though he almost sounded tired.
Sarah seemed impressed. “Lauriston Gardens, in Brixton.”
It seemed as though Sherlock’s secrets went far beyond London, possibly even into the villages west of Dartmoor. The signs pointed, oddly enough, to the town John's father was buried in. But that was impossible, it had to be. "While we're there," Sherlock said quietly, "Call me William Scott."
“Where’s my cane?”
He starts up strumming, knee gently bopping to an invisible metronome. It’s a bit rough, but a guitar can get away with any woody sounds, unlike the violin. His fingers on the fretboard are, frankly, mesmerizing. The chords aren’t basic anymore, something more personable and evocative, flush with an unfamiliar feeling, broad without any specific notes to carry on a melody. His lips are pressed together, eyes mirthful, as if trying to hide a smile. Coy. It takes John much too long to recognize the music.
JUST where that star above
Sherlock slid his hand out, palm-up and fingers slightly curled. After a beat, a smaller, warmer hand slipped into the grip with a squeeze. Sunshine. It had only been a few days of this temporary hell, the blindness not permanent but inconvenient, and John had adapted to the change even better than Sherlock had.
–kerzh-
“Pleasure to meet you,” he rumbled breathlessly, before tugging John forward with a jerk and crushing their lips together.
“Love you too, Har.”
John fumbled out a couple bills and handed them over, the cabbie grunting in thanks. “I noticed immediately, thank you very much,” John said, crawling out into the light afternoon’s sprinkle. He squinted up at the rain clouds with a frown. “Can’t blame me, though. In Stansex I was a bit preoccupied as you might recall.”
he continues, lips curved in a smile,
It’s immediately apparent that this trip is more for Sherlock than it is for John and Rosie. While the beginning stalls are quite boring, lines of gaudy jewelry here and shiny tin tea sets there, the hidden treasures are what Sherlock enjoys sleuthing for the most.
John bites his lip to hide a smile and snatches the glass back, saying, “What, not going to take the piss out of that one?”
ME: Likewise. Until next time, Beta.
It was quiet outside, early Sunday mornings not yet yielding much traffic. He was frustrated at the world for not being louder, as at least that would make some sort of sodding
He does, his nimble fingers flipping the fabric. He hums at the sight of Leonard Nimoy, hand raised in the Vulcan salute with ‘Illogical’ typed in bright red boldface.
“Holmes? As in Mycroft Holmes, the first officer?”
Sherlock. Lately, John tended to section him off into his own category whenever doing something irregular. He more emulated a storybook character than a mere mortal, anyway.
Google had yielded no results to Sherlock’s name, nothing that wasn’t related to the man’s current work. That was odd – while Stansex was a tiny, irrelevant village, a death had supposedly occurred. John had eventually given up the physical search, instead turning the battle inwards to try and explain it all. Again, nothing of value resulted.
Lips pursed, John was still staring at him in poorly-masked contemplation. “The salad,” he said vaguely, voice seeming far away. Sherlock gave him a thoughtful kind of look but turned back to the window, already onto the desserts.
She seemed satisfied with his response.
ME: Also, while I haven't been interested in Artificial Intelligence until relatively recently, there is definite merit towards the theory of uploading human intelligence into a machine, if that's what the future can bring us.
ME: Logging off.
“Not you too!” John groaned. “
It’s always a thrill, when Sherlock Holmes is rendered confused just like the rest of us. John stands and takes a step closer, and the chair between them presses against his knees. Like this, Sherlock perched on the desk, they’re the same height, but John can’t help feeling like he’s only a centimeter tall.
John’s heart was hammering, but his breathing was slow, lungs pressing against his ribcage and threatening to split his chest in two. His hand rose, sluggish, to brush against Sherlock’s cheekbone, mirroring him, his nails lightly scratching the skin. “I think…” he breathed. "That you're a much better person than you give yourself credit for."
John felt his chip whirl to life, vibrating in his skull. He glanced up at Sherlock once he processed the download. “I have the elliptical first, you?”
“John,” Sherlock breathes, eyes alight and a touch overwhelmed for the briefest of moments. John fears he’s going to cry. But then, blinking himself back to the present, Sherlock grins. “Are those Star Wars socks? I thought you knew me better.”
Not even an antique’s fair could save them now. They’re bored enough that only arguments (John) and explosive experiments (obvious) give them any sort of entertainment. Rosie’s picked up on the tension, and has decided to wake John up screaming at two in the morning for the past four nights in a row. Daily strolls are the only things keeping his sanity together, and Sherlock is
“Anthea will accompany you there,” Mycroft said, and the AI herself suddenly made an appearance at John’s side. She lightly touched his arm and nodded her head away from the entrance, face carefully blank. John refrained from flinching, and with a lasting look to Sherlock, he followed her out.
John had forgotten Sherlock wasn’t up-to-date on his pop culture references. “No, it’s just in movies, or comic books, the superhero usually has a strange sort of circumstance that, er, makes him a hero, one of the good guys. Makes him super. Gamma radiation is another good one.”
Nothing ever happened. Nothing
a voice in his head says vaguely, if he had the mind to listen to it. Panicking. He feels like he’s in a school of fish, crowded and devoid of thought, and it’s all too much, he needs to-
“Just… Well. It seems as though I’ve yet to ask the most important question of all.”
Sherlock held out his pale hand, fingers relaxed. “Pleasure,” he drawled.
“John,” Sherlock couldn’t help but murmur, head dropping until his cheek pressed against the other man’s temple. John’s hands bumped over both cocks to spread hot precum, before gripping again with increasing speed. His wrist twisted at the top, and Sherlock bucked his hips.
John shifted in his seat. “I never dated a woman long enough to warrant one, I’d imagine. At least lately.”
His voice, slow and patient despite its frightened undertones, the pattering of a bassoon beneath the chorus. Sherlock blinked back into the present, looking around blindly before he remembered that that didn’t do any good. Not anymore, at least. “John,” he replied, as if on instinct.
“Are you alright?”
John felt his brow dip, unable to mask his concern, but he didn’t want to overstep any boundaries with further coddling. He settled for an awkward pat on the knee. “Yeah, alright. Don’t mention it.”
“There’s… something I want to try.” He took a step forward, and John felt his heart jump somewhere in his throat when hips brushed his knees. He opened his legs automatically, feeling the coldness come closer and closer to seep through his jeans. A marble hand reached up to brush John’s cheek, like it had earlier, only this time with aimless intent. “Is this… fine?”
The call cut off, and when John checked the screen, it seemed as though the phone went dead with it. With a growl, he tossed the cell into one of the bushes before shifting into soldier mode, the one who could sit still for hours in search of the sound of a pin dropping.
John fiddled with a sugar packet and pled the fifth.
“That hardly forces me to-”
ME: Oh please, that’s not what I
brought the bubbling of laughter from his chest. Sherlock’s fingers were insistent beneath John’s eyes. “
“Sherlock,” Lestrade warned with a sigh. He held up a hand to the woman before she could respond, so she huffed and opened the door back into the crime scene. Anderson was frowning crossly at her. “She’s behaved herself and hasn’t said one word to you today, was that necessary?”
he thinks, but to Sherlock’s credit he only inclines his head. “That’s probably the kindest compliment you’ve given me yet,” he says, a small smile curving at his lips. The saddest part being that he likely means it.
will you join me? I’m sure that’ll give Mrs. Hudson enough ‘warning’.”
“I don’t care.”
“... Yes?”
mean something was the brief flash of the man that John got, face flushed and shirtless and hair in disarray as he bodily moved the woman from the room. “I’m tired, I need to take a shower, and you don’t belong in my room anymore. Get
She laughed. “Speaking of mum, she would love to see you! You absolutely have to meet us at the inn for lunch, after you pay your respects.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. “He will be disappointed. Not enough to call off the wedding, obviously. He loves her too much.” He opened his eyes, hands steady on his microscope as if he hadn’t just been near to breaking. “But I predict that she’ll incorporate primrose regardless. Because she loves him, as well.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly, and then he released her. That was the only way John could describe it – it was almost as if he was forcing her to engage, if the lack of color to her cheeks was anything to go by, and then suddenly let her free. The air calmed marginally.
Nearing the end as they collected the parts back together (including an ear that had flown halfway across the room), John expected a number of things. Another body, perhaps, or orders to follow him back down to Chem Lab 4 to help with even more experiments. Hopefully a dismissal.
In the end, there was no night of fun. Because exactly one week later on a stormy Wednesday night, Sherlock got a call from Mycroft.
“Mary was-”
John was certainly no stranger to early wake-up calls. He disposed of his dishes on the moving rack. “I expect you will too. Why so early?”
It was no lost on either of them that the words directly reminisced of the exile, the final words spoken. Sherlock could hear John’s smile, sad and dripped with low brass. “There’s no daughter to name,” he pointed out, free hand reaching up to stroke Sherlock’s arm. “And I do hope that this isn’t the last time we meet. Would put a damper on everything, I’d say.”
was wasn’t in the stars for them. And then they both were definitively, irrevocably, wholly messed up beyond repair.
much of an impression,” he joked lamely.
“This body is case-closed, correct?”
“Right,” he said slowly. “Okay. Er, Sherlock, have you had anything interesting happen lately? How’d that case go the other week, the one with the cornfield?”
“Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it.”
John was too far intrigued to start at the words, now in the face of his own agreement. Without a lasting look behind him, he did as he was told.
“Punishment never stopped you before,” he replied.
“Would someone like to explain to me,” he began in a large voice, causing the people around them to scatter. “Why I was awoken at five in the bloody morning to news that two vital pieces of my crew decided to go on a little adventure?”
“You were paired with them on the first day. Since you weren’t here, though, I’ll assign you to…” His eyes darted along the crowd of people, searching the different faces with an increasingly tight brow. “Sector 2 isn’t here yet, as per usual. You’re from Sector 2, yeah? Have you met your representative yet?”
“Turn it that way,” RJ said. “Then press its belly. I put a button there.”
ME: Hm.
John cocked his head. “Why wouldn’t you?”
“-a kid in love.” John sighs. “I understand.”
RJ huffed. “The DSE Intrepid,” he insisted, “the
“Idiot,” Sherlock admonished fondly. “Are you sure you’re not drunk?”
“You didn’t even let me ask!” Sherlock laughs. As if on instinct, John reaches out so their fingers brush together, and suddenly Sherlock turns a shade darker. Beneath the thudding of his heartbeat, John feels like a helium balloon, floating into the atmosphere… soon, the pressure will pop him, but for now, all he can do find something to tether onto before the inevitable. When Mrs. Hudson returns, John draws back his hand reluctantly.
“Huh,” Sherlock muttered absently, definitely
In the following days, Sherlock became scarce as quickly as he had first appeared. After their initial spar, with an excuse of further experiments he needed to tend to, he faded back into the crowd, and then from the training facility itself. John found himself thinking after the man when he failed to come the next morning; after all, they were partners now, weren’t they? And wasn’t John somehow part of a plan, now, one that seemed of utmost importance while being explained? Surely Sherlock wouldn’t skip out on training, now that he knew he had someone waiting for him. However, for the rest of the day, there was no sign of him.
