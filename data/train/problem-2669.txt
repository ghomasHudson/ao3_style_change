As much as he wanted to do it that night, he wanted to prevent the bunker from burning down a little bit more.
Dean was so winded and his surroundings were spinning so fast he couldn’t form a coherent sentence. Whatever happened during this dream, hit him a thousand times harder than the rest.
As Dean turned to storm out, Cas entered the room, blocking his escape. Cas tilted his head in confusion as his gaze also focused on the bed, “Well......this is festive.”
“Because I.....” Cas stammered as words began to overwhelm him and none seemed fitting enough to explain. He was provided another second before the modulation of the answer he’d come up with wavered, a new shakiness present that Dean had never heard from him before, “Because I can’t have you. If I have you, I’ll have to go.”
Sam sighed, “He’ll be dead to you. I’m not making any promises that I won’t ever see him or talk to him again. But I can promise it doesn’t ever need to involve you.”
Dean had read through exactly how almost a hundred times. He practically recited it to him, "Stake dipped in dog's blood. Stab them in the heart and we're golden."
Cas finally stood from his spot and began to pace, “Theoretically yes, it is possible. But it’s not in a Cupid’s nature to commit such acts of violence. The motive is questionable.”
But, he wasn’t. Sam had his computer propped in front of him at the table with his stack of pancakes and home fries starting to get cold beside him. Cas and Dean sat across from the him, focusing more on nourishment than the case considering they had already seen four hours worth of lore and sketchy Internet forums. Dean had ordered an omelette with a side of bacon and the caffeine  he was desperate for. Of course, Cas didn’t order anything because he never did. But, always around ten minutes in he’d start asking Dean for sips of coffee. Dean always anticipated this and would insist on just ordering him a cup but Cas always pushed back insisting he didn’t think he would want it. Luckily, Dean had become accustomed to sharing. He didn't want to admit to himself that he had missed this when Cas was gone.
Cas was hesitant in answering. He looked at the ground for a few seconds before returning his gaze to her and signing,
thing he could’ve done. He knew how much Jack meant to him—despite how they parted ways. And as much as he wanted to add a cold remark about how Jack would’ve been better off had they let him die the first time, the motivation to do so never dawned on him. Almost like the pain he felt every time that name was mentioned was beginning to wither away. Dean couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or not.
“You mean besides the screaming in her sleep that I couldn’t wake her from no matter how hard I tried?” She questioned bitterly, her nice exterior fading away at a moment’s notice.
Dean’s head felt like it had been deep fried and this time it wasn’t the succubus’ spell. So much had been dropped on him and didn’t even know what to unpack first. He felt his primal instinct to close himself off started to take over, hopelessly trying to rebuild the wall the two of them had just shattered. More like, obliterated.
The woman stepped closer to him and answered, “Yes. We were minding our own business and your friend here told us if we so much as looked at this tree, he’d tackle us.”
written down the right leg. Given him and his brother’s height difference, they were going to be slightly baggy on Dean. Regardless, he still carried them into the bathroom with him and changed while performing the rest of his usual nighttime activities.
“Cas, I am not having this conversation.” He snarled. He made a beeline toward the mini fridge. He swung open the door with more force than necessary. His suspicions were correct in that it was stocked with alcohol.
It only took Dean about ten minutes to get dressed and pack his things. He spent the next ten minutes waiting inside the driver’s seat of the impala, which was parked in the garage. It was something he found himself doing more and more often lately. Because the bunker was pretty much empty and there wasn’t anyone to strike up a conversation with. Just Sam and Dean. No more Jack. No more Cas.
I realize now that I've made this story so much more kinky than I ever originally intended. I feel like no ones complaining tho lmao
“Yeah, well, I changed my mind.” Dean defended, closing his eyes. Suddenly he wanted dream world Cas over the real deal. Because at least the fake version merely wanted to make him come, the angel next to him wanted to make him honest.
Dean was impressed with Cas' amount of professionalism while discussing this topic, because Dean didn't have any. His face was nine different shade of red—and if the room wasn’t dark Cas could see it, and his heart rate had skyrocketed. He tried his best to keep his voice steady as he nodded, "I guess that explains why it hurts so much....and why you didn't wake me up." He remembered the agreement him and Cas had made before he went to bed and he had been wondering why he didn't withhold it.
Dean perked up upon hearing his brother's confusion. He slightly pushed himself off the car and tried to stop him from inspecting the item thoroughly, "Wait a second-"
Mortified wasn’t even accurate enough of a word for the way Dean was feeling. A blush crept up on his cheeks for no one to see.
Dean just shook his head and didn’t answer his question. He gave Sam a resentful scowl, “Well then I guess you’re gonna need some padded walls, because I’m not doing this.” He finally pushed against Cas, trying to get him to budge.
Sam took a large step over his unconscious brother to get to the door, which Cas finally moved out of the way of. Sam patted him on the shoulder as he opened it, “I’ll go start investigating the vic’s spouses, when he wakes up, he’s all yours.” He slightly smirked.
He looked over at his equally shocked companion, who was staring wide-eyed at a silver ring. He saw tears threatening to spill over his eyelids and that was when Dean noticed that, he himself, was already crying.
Cas fiercely placed two fingers on his forehead, knocking him out cold. It was something so spontaneous and something so purely done out of rage that Cas hadn’t realized he’d done it until Dean was snoring against the pillow.
Dean’s face lit up crimson for what seemed like the hundredth time this morning. He quickly diverted his gaze to the window in hope Sam didn’t notice. He felt Cas shift in his spot beside him and he mentally prayed that he wouldn’t say anything.
His younger brother simply ignored him and looked at Cas, “I got the dog blood and made some wooden stakes while I was at it. Are you positive it’s in there?”
, he responded after Dean told him. And clearly Sam told Eileen because next thing he knew, she was approaching him at the map table with a catalogue of rings. She even had some already circled of the ones she liked. The only reason she had that on hand in the first place was because she’d proposed to Sam a few months earlier, right after Chuck was defeated. So, Dean had to keep asking himself: What the fuck was stopping him from doing the same?
He then took the opportunity to search through the ornaments he chose. A majority of them were various flowers and birds because of course they were. It pleased Dean at just how
Dean felt like they were both drowning in the hostility, so he tried to lighten the mood, “You say that like I’m actually competent when I’m sober.” He still decided to listen to him about the speed at which he was downing the vodkas and put the other remaining bottles aside. He was, indeed, feeling a bit tipsy. He then shrugged, “I’m already fucked anyway. I’m infected or whatever, like you said.”
they were. He rooted through them with a smirk and a slightly raised eyebrow, which Cas took offense to, “You said I could pick.”
Cas repositioned himself beside Dean as he laid down. Dean made the effort of climbing into the covers as if anything about this was normal.
aspects of the situation but she did say she heard her mother screaming she was going to be eaten.” Cas stated while folding his hands in his lap. His eyes flickered over to Dean only to see his gaze was glued to the floor.
Cas’ face sulked and didn’t try to reply. His look of sadness and guilt returned in a flash and it made Dean feel worse than he expected. Regardless of what Cas did, Dean hated when he upset him. Yet, he always found himself doing it anyway. Because that was the only thing he knew how to do: hurt the people he cared about.
If Dean didn’t know any better, he could’ve sworn Sam was implying that him and Cas were going to do more than sleep and do research.....
“You’re fucking with me.” Dean stared incredulously at his little brother sitting across from him in the kitchen. He was minding his own business, sipping his morning coffee in his usual robe, when Sam came storming in, laptop resting on his forearm. He had a child-like wonder that sparkled behind his eyes as he took a seat. And then he proceeded to tell him one of the most insane things Dean had heard in awhile. In fact, his brain barely processed what he said, his voice stammered as he asked for clarification, “Obviously, I didn’t hear you correctly because I could’ve sworn you just said—“
Dean shuddered when his palm finally reached the bulge between his legs. He felt horny again, despite already coming twice just a few minutes ago. The heightened state of arousal theory was really gaining traction. Dean's body felt like it was on fire. He suddenly wanted to be touched. Needed it. And he knew Cas was the only one who could satiate him.
“Tell you what? Go get yourself your own room. It’s on the house.” Dean tried to flash him a genuine smile as he pulled out his credit card and held it out to him.
“Hey, you said it yourself that I needed to try to get along with Cas. Don’t you think sharing a room together alone would be some sort of progress?” He proposed.
wasn’t going to tell him he wouldn’t mind if he had the dream again. It did feel incredible, after all.
Dean’s head finally lifted in his direction to meet his gaze when he had a clue of what he was referring to, which was only made more obvious by the discomfort and tinge of fear written across Cas’ face. Dean bit the inside of his cheek and pointed at him, “No way in Hell.”
"So like right now?" Cas was quick with a reply and Dean wasn't ready for it. He then tried to get ahead start on stopping his filthy mind from distracting him, but he was unsuccessful. The thought of Cas—real Cas, choking him made him ache.
Cas squinted at him and tilted his head in the way he famously did, “I-I didn’t say anything. Are you positive you’re alright, Dean?”
“Well, ain’t that a bitch.” Dean uttered, fully sitting up, “In the car earlier—what the hell was that?”
“This one.” They spoke in unison. Their harmonized words caused them to lock eyes and smile at each other. Dean only lasted a few seconds in his gaze before he looked away bashfully. And all of a sudden, his plan was playing through his head again.
“It’s going to eat you if we don’t stop it.” Cas had said after it was quiet for way too long, at least on his end of things.
“Well, I slept great—for the most part. Did you guys hear that one room last night? Like I get it’s a by-the-hour motel and all, but jeez they were loud. Talk about having no shame.” Sam then resumed his typing on his keyboard.
Dean usually wasn't the dreaming type. More than likely, 4 hours of sleep a night didn't exactly give his body a whole lot of time to fall into REM.
Sam was then pulling Cas into a short hug, giving him a pat on the back as he did. Dean rolled his eyes at the sight of the small grin that washed over Cas’ face as it happened. When they pulled away, Sam admitted, “It’s good to see you, Cas.”
Cas had rolled back over toward the edge of the heart. The mental beat down he was giving himself was fully visible on his face.
Sam groaned at his reluctance, “Dean, this is for your own good. All the moping around the bunker, not eating and running on nothing but crappy coffee, sitting in the impala alone all the time......” Dean fixated on Cas’ reaction to his words, feeling slightly bashful all of a sudden. Cas simply raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t say anything as Sam continued, “You’re miserable. Even if you won’t admit it. And I’ve just about had enough of not talking about the elephant in the room for weeks now. So here’s the fucking elephant. Talk to it. Before I go insane.” He pleaded.
They had been through this before. “You don’t have to actually cook it or eat, Dean,” Castiel reminded.
a pubescent Sam, carrying a crate of fireworks, looked alive as he ran ahead to start placing them on the ground.
The hunter himself was distracted, finding a bone-deep familiarity with the country tune pouring through the door as much as the image of the bar inside; one might call it the Roadhouse, but the signage, the lighting and the decor were a whole new world of its own.
“Strange to think I argued my way back to life purely on the idea that I was needed as a tool and not wanted as family; but whatever it took to be with you, to protect you, and to bring about that new world--that’s what I wanted.”
He wouldn’t lie and pretend he’d never laid with a strong, muscled form next to him before. But there was something different of two souls binding into one; an energy, a force and a passion that--while easily recalling the heat of lust and dire needs of release came with an entirely different charge.
Castiel continued.”They were the most fearsome warriors in ancient times. There was a movie called the 300 that was given to the Spartans, but at the end of the day--the true band were the Thebans.”
“Well,” Castiel dared to interject cautiously. “Dean’s decided to help me stay and run things,” Castiel reminded. “And Sam and Eileen have agreed to go back to earth with you.” There was a nearly motherly gentleness that tended to take the ex-angel when he spoke to the nephilim.
Mistakes made with sirens; untold stories of worlds that never were with Smith & Wesson. Jack silently took it all in, watching silently. He witnessed the day his father fell in every way imaginable. Dean saw it through new eyes as well--and more, truly saw himself as the angel looked into him that day. A spark and a switch seemed to fill the air, sharing with the audience the moment the angel gave himself to man just before the light of banishing played on the nighttime screen.
More silence aired, and Sam intently watched Patience’s lips to see if Eileen was just protesting signing at this point.
Dean smarmily, silently parroted back the angel’s words, mouthing ‘good time to make use of that reincarnation system’ before moving on.
“And at least this time, King Herod is dead.” Castiel added his idea of humor to it, causing a few perplexed looks.
“Except not. Or at least, not digested. The light being cast doesn’t belong directly to the souls, but they’re still there. Their minds are there. So if we can locate all the leviathans and get them to disengorge the souls--”
Castiel spoke up. “Regents. Protecting the throne until Jack is ready, if he ever will be. Heaven’s functions have changed. Man should honestly rule. And while I may be Soul instead of Grace now, I can’t call myself Humanity’s Representative.”
“When did they die?” Dean asked at his private window-table with Castiel, eyeing many others--Garth and Bess; Missouri; Victor, even.
“I’ve told you, Emptiness is not a thing, or a place any more than the garden or heaven is. The Shadow of the Empty is nothing more than what we hate about ourselves, what we fear. What we don’t want to admit we want, or who we are.”
“Each on their own time.” Castiel explained, “But when the garden calls, we leave the door open for everyone. They’ll always be here when ready. All of them will. Some part is always here, save for when I have to close it now and then.”
He watched Dean’s eyes fill with mixed emotion; love, and maybe even a spark of fear as if this might be the last he heard again; a new goodbye.
“Yeah? I mean not on purpose. You dragged me up here but--guess it came from me because you--this you, or whatever,” Dean gestured from bed, propped up on an elbow, “Wasn’t there.”
“You asked,” Dean casually shoved a bundle of fries in his face, chewing through it while Eileen smirked and eyeballed either of them.
“You chose this place.” Castiel segued strangely as he found a grey robe thrown over a desk seat, pulling it warmly against himself while reflecting on memories framed on the wall.
Dean’s light caught a ring of Leviathan Blossoms at the base of the tree. He tucked his chin. “Might as well bring home some flowers.”
The regents of heaven dog walked their pet Leviathan through the crowd. It was a sure way to get plenty of room and short cuts through lines, Dean noted.
“I wanted you. Son knows I wanted you. And I wanted to believe… maybe I had even thought that you and I were courting at that time, with our gifts, and movies. I even let myself start to think you might have wanted me the way I felt. That I wasn’t misreading what I felt from you.”
Castiel nodded. Dean tried to open the door, but it would only budge half an inch. Inside, there were voices--most complaining, some more abruptly with the door.
“I mean, if you can call it that. Not a happy one. You were all storm clouds and nihilism,” Dean admitted with an air of burden, rising to stand and finally head over towards the window.
“And surviving’s different from living. Bunch of rabid croats out there don't exactly sing honeymoon.”
It was distinctly different from the quiet scene Dean had first wandered up towards, given Bobby still seemed planted on his porch stoop with a beer. “Hey kids. Everyone’s been waiting for you.” He nodded the brothers inside and locked his eyes on Castiel. “And half of heaven’s been waiting for you.”
The ideas had started small, like trying to find it a spark in nice views of nature, escalating to concerts, and currently, standing in the idea of an amusement park. Half the crowd may have actually been real due to the lively appeal.
That was certainly a far deeper answer than Dean had worried about like Castiel watching him break out the porn.
Castiel chuckled. “Actually, their heaven is with William. Jo’s father. They’re free to help here as much as they like though.” Castiel looked at his own hand resting on the table before inching his fingers closer to Dean. “That’s actually something I wanted to speak to you about.”
“Yeahhhh uh, about that.” Dean cleared his throat. “We uh, found a way for me to help out with that.”
The family sat amidst ample and fertile greens and floral arrays of all colors, shaded pleasantly by trees of all shapes and sizes and the sun warmly beaming through. The weather was perfect--and always would be.
And cinema played on--dark silhouettes in surprise combat in a shoddy dorm room; ouija hospital runs and roadside arguments. Flash run-ins with the Trickster, movie set hauntings, ghostfacers and drunk-santa-hunting christmases. Fairy tales and the gaffes of unlucky rabbit's feet and lost shoes; and Sam seeing for the first time what Dean had witnessed the day he met Castiel--apparently, showering sparks none too different from the fireworks, open fire and chest stabbings were still greatest hits.
“That world was not yet there. I considered it a--” Castiel chuckled grimly, eyes drifting to the rafters of the ceiling, “A waste of how useful I could be moving forward. I had at least convinced myself I wasn’t useless, and maybe that was an improvement. Raising a son together made me reconsider much of this. I couldn’t let him think the way I did.”
Dean snapped up a hand, holding up one finger demanding a moment of attention even while delaying freeing his lips from Castiel's for a few more seconds.
Dean knew deeply that Castiel had seen and remembered many things; but flicker frames of first storm floods and towers of babel paled to the Grand Story; the multiple shots at ripping up the ending, and the rules; of Dean and Sam as Castiel’s Cain and Abel; of maybe a spark of Sodom and Gomorrah in brief flashes of Castiel perceiving Dean screaming for him beneath Lucifer’s control; and of course, maybe the most remarkable event--
A monster hit a zone. In 20 minutes, it was identified. In 40, it was assessed. They knew better than murdering outright these days. There were too many Garths in the world, just doing their best. Of course many stayed under observation without their knowledge, but the cameras were easy enough for Eileen and the other hunters that had put the bunker back online to manage--and Sam could occasionally flip to them on remote view access.
The angel leaned away and escaped his grip, leaving Dean looking momentarily shattered, “What, was that--”
Sam chewed on his lip, reviewing Eileen’s wide-eyed face and her trying to argue through gesturing. “No it--listen--”
“Chuck tried to create something out of the prime material, but they couldn’t self perceive, but by the time they tried to gain an identity--possibly by Eve acquiring a soul from the tree--they were--”
Dean realized he had been cycling his drink in his grip, finally tossing it back on that harsh note.
Rufus glanced up from his pitcher. “Yeah. Your angel there was salty about your long-assed death speech without calling a damn ambulance and put it out in the Celestial Times."
“Beyond being dangerously self-loathing in life and equally daft? I couldn’t tell you. But I know what we are.” Castiel detected the side glimpse. “Real. Even here. You are my Universe, Dean. And together, we raised the World.”
He could see the river, and carved into his hunter mind the best he could the configuration of the trees and ferns around it, hoping it would react if he got near to it. He wasn’t about to try and go for soggy boots round two yet.
“And I saw myself,” his gaze communed another memory, tangible and yet silent. Something the hunter would simply know.
Dean glanced to see if Castiel had much to add; but apparently, the angel was going to leave the hunter to make his own decision. “Look.” he turned back to Saileen, “My whole life… I was doing work because dad put that on me. On us, mostly, but--”
Castiel looked pleasantly humored. “I wouldn’t change much. But I’m thinking more… living, than surviving.”
Sam and Eileen were a few states away enjoying the night in a hot red Mustang, feeling just as young; and somewhere, an ageless duo crossed the neverending sea of stars to find what new heaven called to them.
“Yeah uh-- I don’t want to derail storytime with my own but apparently, Rowena’s version of hell really doesn’t sit right with those around since Lucifer.
Eileen hadn’t left the life; Dean, frankly, was surprised Sam had. He clarified that he helped her mostly from home, working on networks and intel while she took over the bunker for herself for the very few remaining cases. It had become a transit hub for the Sioux Falls women more than anything, and the various others exposed to the truth while cleaning up the final loose ends and untamed monsters. Unfortunately, one such case took Eileen away when their son was only a few years old.
“Right.” Dean still scoured the ceiling, balancing his breath. “Less dumb. Lots of ass. So that’s--that’s it? We just… bone the knot and--”
“Listen,” Dean cut in, “I’m not here to point fingers at where we messed up. But what I can say is--Jack’s been working his ass off keeping Earth online and helping Cas around this place. And he’s not going to stop the other part if I walk out.”
He caught Cas’ smug grin as the angel ruffled his hair. The ex-angel could still get Dean hook, line and sinker with his dry humor juxtaposed to old alien ways.
The hunter caught the angel opening his mouth, and pointed to slash that talking point off and interrupted
The back door of the Roadhouse popped open. Ellen was the first to come out, trying to figure out why it was raining men. Looking up, she found the dangerous duo and sighed, “What did you two do now?”
“Yeah, but that’s not what I mean. You know. You never really got to go to school. Or… build your own family, or whatever.”
“Nothing,” Castiel uprighted himself. “I’m just wondering if it’s possible to eat yourself sick here.”
Castiel, finally kidnapped into the moment, went less for the jazzy-rock-shuffle and instead stole away Dean’s hand as he had once in a black and white dream, snaring him in abruptly out of his fake performance and giving one close-chested, daunting leer of warning before testing the threshold of the stage in tango-swing.
“I think--” he took her hand, “We should do it. And do it right. I’m not saying I want you to get out of the Life. But we can build something better, closer. Safer. We had something good going on there, we can do more with that. Just no more pointless deaths. I’m so tired of losing people.”
A bunch of demons kept crawling out of the hole begging for something to do that wasn’t new soul reception, rehabilitation, or giving her a massage."
He knew without as much as looking. The corners of his eyes crinkled as he nodded into a small grin, turning to glance back.
Dean broke long enough to mutter a “shut up, Sam” aside, the angel pressing forehead against the side of his head in full surrender with his hip crooked over the table.
“The happiness my Shadow wanted me to embrace would never destroy me. I didn’t even understand it when I said goodbye to you. It simply wanted to be known. And to be. The glass wasn’t empty anymore, Dean. I let you fill it.”
“That’s how the others happened.” Castiel pointed out while approaching with a pair of Margiekugel bottles in hand, passing one to Dean.
“I mean, yeah. Figure, why not? One less evil bastard in the world. And Rowena’s really not all about the blood and mayhem anymore. Might as well give a few a shot.”
"He was up in here yellin' 'look out for the spike!' and 'call an ambulance'. Ever see heaven try to get out of heaven? That's some funny shit.”
He swore he felt the answer. Shadows. Emptiness. Absence. Maybe the light wasn’t allowed to reach here.
Sam hesitated. “I mean it’s up to what Eileen wants, really.” He conceded. “If I didn’t forget this… maybe we could avoid losing her in the hunt. Have our kid… grow up with his mom instead of a Nanny. Not that I’m going to.. Nail her down into momming or whatever.”
“She’s been road tripping with me up here and showing me around. Apparently she’s been trying to find you to talk about making a network to cross-conference with hell so we can talk to Rowena, but she jerry-rigged something up that’ll work until you guys can do something more official? Something about working with Charlie.”
“Alright,” he conceded, wandering to the breakfast table near the other window and setting down either glass. “Hit me,” he invited, as he poured their equal shares.
“What if they’re trying to find the light, Dean? They don’t know how. But I’ve been there--a mind without a soul. From a different direction, of course. But it calls to us.”
The two were pressed so close, bare bodies pressed in the all-encompassing mattress of their upstairs bungalow, that Castiel could only see the question spark in the depths of the hunter’s eyes rather than the creases at the corner of them.
Castiel vocalized it. “Welcome to heaven controlled by man, Dean. Try not to chew on the ants for sport. But,” he tapped him on the shoulder, “I’ll let you get away with playing with them once in a while. As a treat.”
Fighting faeries, meeting Charlie; long wars through Purgatory as brothers in arms and brief flirts with domesticity for Sam that left Eileen knowingly eyeing him. Battles with cartoon logic, and nazis, and titans.  Sam's knowingness of Artemis' weakness in Prometheus, earning a belated chuckle and nod from Dean.
“...Yes.” A memory shift, by no means linear, of the view Castiel had the day he intimately removed Dean’s blade from his pocket in the archives to cut his hand again and paint a similar rune. “That was it.”
Dean realized he had to quantify that last one, but had been inquiring about the former after Castiel had let it be known he was watching them post-mortem.
“I mean--not really, but--” he paused, eyes searching the walls. “I think? I knew? That we had something there. Like. Future-me was a complete dick when you flirted with me or whatever.”
“...You’re not the only one who has to deal with it,” Castiel rolled his eyes, dipping a fry in ketchup while side eyeing the current karaoke serenade going on just above their shoulder level.
“I didn’t say they were cosmic,” the angel interceded. “But it, like every piece of soul and mind in heaven, has its own plans. And they might become something else one day.”
where he emerged. After all, that was where the Roadhouse was. Which he guessed was where the heart of the Garden was. Which he guessed was where Heaven’s throne was, if he was tracking all of these details of his afterlife correctly.
“This glass is still a glass whether empty or full,” Castiel raised it while easing himself into a chair, Dean matching him on the other side. “The shadow is just the empty glass,” he saw Dean’s gears turning. “You’re my whiskey, Dean.”
“Well, he’s always going to be here. Every human that could ever Be is here. But most of his Being would be on earth. He won’t be able to travel all over like the rest of you, but he could find somewhere to settle down.”
Castiel hopefully offered aside, “If the union only requires us, one could make use of nonlinear time to re-enter at a point others you would know are there.”
“Dean,” the angel caught his attention on the bridge. The hunter stopped to face him, keys in hand and ready to go but eyes full of questions. “I shouldn’t have stopped you.”
“I remember this.” Sam mused, none too differently than Dean years ago. “I think that was 1996. Fourth of July.”
Despite the high mood, both men deflated with a heavy gust of air once settling into their typical designated Impala seats.
“Yheah,” Sam chuckled. “Tell me about it,” he uprighted himself. “The house is so quiet with Jack off to college I don’t even know what to do when Dean’s at daycare.”
Dean takes one sated, drowsy look at him and bursts out laughing, while Castiel mock-scowls at him and swipes the come off his bottom lip with his tongue. “Very funny,” he mutters with a smile, nipping gently at the skin of Dean’s hip before propping himself up on his hands. “One day, I’ll get the hang of this without making a mess.”
There’s curiosity on Dean’s face now, and Castiel can’t help but feel a little smug as he turns away, guiding Dean up towards where he’s been working on the surprise. It feels like Dean has him on the back foot so often, whether he means to or not, that it’s nice to be able to flip the tables. Just for today.
Castiel gives an experimental circle of his hips, then rocks up into Dean, earning him a quiet moan and a flutter of lashes.
He tangles his fingers in Cas’s hair and pulls him in close for another kiss, the intensity of his feelings bubbling up in his chest. After everything they’ve been through, all the trials they’ve faced side by side, he knows there’s no-one else he’d rather have in his life.
“You… you made this for me?” he asks, and there’s an awed tone to his voice. “Cas, it’s beautiful, I—“
It’s even more endearing inside than it is out, populated with small tables and lit in such a way that is warm, friendly, a little romantic. It’s homely and welcoming, and Castiel feels part of him relax, just a little bit.
“I didn’t know how many vamps there really were here,” he mutters under his breath, reaching over to retrieve his machete from the vampire’s shoulder.
Instead of trying to read the clothes that brush against his fingers as people push past, he follows Dean, who moves through the crowd as though he belongs there. There’s a moment when he turns as though to check that Castiel is still there, when the dim lighting catches across his face and illuminates his smile, that steals Castiel’s breath away.
Dean was certain he didn’t entirely understand the weight or consequence of that proposal, but he understood the basics. His mind wrapped around it, simplistically, as the world’s strangest marriage proposal. “How--how does that even work here? Do--do we find a priest?”
Sam still stumbled through questions. "Wait, if he's heaven, and you're-- and we're in-- oh god get me out of here."
“Sorry, Cas.” He imagined the angel panicking on the other side of whatever threshold he couldn’t get through the same as earth.
“Fair ‘nough,” he jolted as his line was tugged, with both men going silent beyond the hunter’s aggressive grunting as he waged warfare on the other end of his line.
“I knew, even if I made your perfect world… it was something I would never have. Not with you. At first, because I didn’t think I belonged. And then… hearing you pray--hearing what I so cruelly, if oblivious, stopped you from saying; in fear for disappearing in that moment, that I might have it?”
“Yeah. But come on.” Dean returned to the banister--this time slinging one arm around his brother. “Pretty fantastic, right?”
“They, greatly outmatched in number by the Spartans, still sent even them to historic and shameful defeat.”
“They were lovers, and warriors; neither one more than the other.” Castiel finally finished, having earned Dean’s enduring stare and trusting the roads of heaven to guide him more than the idea of his eyes. “Ever since I pulled you out of hell,” he repeated some of the final words Dean heard from him in life. The brightly lit road became grim, murky and lightning cut, underpassing crossways of chains binding one dream to the next, “I found myself unable to ever truly leave you, no matter the battle.”
A large, dead oak bare of its leaves stood over the clearing like a skyscraper. The husked out, black goo seeping skeleton of a serpent hung from it as if crucified. Dean’s distant flashlight beams descended, as if expecting to find something. But nothing.
“He walked away, Sam. We let him walk away, and we didn’t stop him. He still deserved a life, a family. I dunno, to go to school and have a stupid first crush.”
Couples-pool lasted hours of the night. Dean himself may have been a master poolsmith, but Eileen and Sam’s solid play left no room for Castiel’s novice hand. That, and Dean may have been more than distracted with taking his chance to teach him
He approached the bar of the bridge, sensing the angel at his flank--closer, even, than in the car moments before.
Dean popped his brows; but he didn’t say anything. He shouldn’t have been surprised that Sam might have wanted to see the angel. Maybe their connection was somehow different, but no less war-hardened.
Dean headed to their mini-bar, pulling out a few fine bottles of divine honeyed whiskey touched by the apiary out behind the roadhouse and twin glasses pinched in his fingers.
“HEYYYY!” A familiar voice cut in from across the crowd, causing the trio to whip to look towards Ash cleaning glasses at the bar. “Dean Winchester. The godslayer. Heard you died getting nailed from behind.”
“That’s kinda the point, kid.” Dean inserted. “You get to figure that out. Only rule is, no powers, no using your hoodoo stuff to fix things. Like you said, hands off. Do it like the rest of us.”
He blinked. “O...kay.” Sam closed the door, wandering through the ground level while opening the envelope.
“I’m--yeah. I’m good with that.” Dean tucked his lips and chin in content surrender, only to find himself being rolled on top of by a shaggy-haired, stubble-faced and blue-eyed warrior.
There was no true concept of time, or passing, or anywhere to be or anything to do. Just laughter, and old tales, and the weaving of new ones. Food fights; a brief winter and snow forts gone as quickly as it never-was--though Dean distinctly remembered the angel pounding a tree and tumbling a mountain of snow down onto him. But truly, spring felt timeless.
Castiel recited over the increasingly energetic jive of one of Dean’s two favorite songs resonating through the car, “And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their beloved, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honor;...”
Dean readily fed into the song, pointing in command to Sam and Eileen while mouthing the lyrics in far too much exaggeration and coasting further into the room and past them. Eileen didn’t have to hear the song to itself to feel the vibration and the rhythm rattling the walls, casting Sam a long-upwards look of invitation.
“There hasn't been a monster-related death in the united states in the last eleven months.” Eileen updated over the video client while Sam stared on, a pleasant smile steaming as much as his coffee as he stared at her.
“So um,” Sam paused. “Before you got on this whole storytelling kick, there was something else we wanted to tell you.”
“But,” Eileen’s distinct voice cut through while stirring her drink, eyes shifting from Sam to Dean and Castiel, “Only if you come too.”
As the day’s events wrapped, Castiel shook Henry’s hand and found himself almost trapped in John’s grip with a pressured stare before releasing; Mary was warmer with her firm hug, which she shared with Dean once John had his go.
They shared a strong, fraternal hug. For one, it had been decades; for another, an eternity and yet only a few short trips. Despite that, it was like they were never separated.
By the end of the day, almost everyone had filed out to head back towards their personal Blue Idahos with only a few still mulling around giving thanks.
Dean found his gaze snapped back to a blinding light as they drove through the putrid abyss, hearing his own screaming as an eldritch body of light filled his view.
“Yeah! But it’s like the reward of it all. Play the game, get the prize, have the dinner date,” Dean defended, only to see perpetual judgment from his heavenly partner.
“Wait, there’s a Cas?” The angel, having enjoyed the sentiment of watching them from afar, simply suddenly-was behind them.
“What?” Sam repeated, brows furrowing in a loud attempt to catch a wifi signal to try to run that one through google.
And with that, they walked into the unknown; or maybe the known. A brief rend in space glowed in orange and rippled open for them to pass through. And like that, they were gone.
“Yeah, looks like the new warding alert systems did most of the work for us,” Sam made sure to speak into the active camera clearly, signing halfway along as best he had learned to help clarify.
each brother lit, taking the steps back before rainbow fire burst into the sky, reflecting memories in five sets of eyes--new to some.
“In Purgatory. I heard you. But it wasn’t fair to you. I shouldn’t have stopped you from saying it.”
Sam continued, “They came pounding on the bunker door while Claire was here. I think she did a few of them a mercy by ganking the first ones before they explained what was going on.
Dean had chosen to begin the night with the same thing his first remembered trip to heaven started with. The group inclined forward when they realized the show began on the ground.
Inside the Roadhouse, Castiel settled out the blossoms and stared at them, fingers knit as he meditated. Dean’s explanation of the tree was enough to connect to his previous vision through the eyes of the Leviathan stuck in Bobby’s panic room.
Dean knew well enough from a past heaven trip how very real shared lips could feel. He leaned in cautiously while guiding the angel towards him, finding himself lost in blues just as deep as the cosmic seas they had traveled on the day, noses brushed against each other and neither ready to move. He didn’t know if he was imagining the taste of breath -- everything there was imagined, after all, but--
Sam raised a challenging brow, as if expecting the elder brother to brush something under the carpet. “What would you call it?”
“Goodbye, Sam.” Castiel offered from the back, pulling from his own enduring hug with Jack. The nephilim was jogging to catch up to Sam and Eileen, only to swerve back and throw himself into a hug with Dean. “Thanks, dad.”
“I don’t know if I really feel like I need to find anyone. Besides, I need to help out around here, Cas is already carrying this place. Literally.”
“I’m gonna help Cas keep this place together until you’re ready to come back. Or if you ever are. It’s cool here anyway. Got my car, a bar, everyone I know. But you can go and… I dunno. Find something. Someone.”
Dean won a wiffle bat from a stand, which was used more than once to scold the shrieking Leviathan for splitting its’ face open and screaming. Given, behind the safety of a muzzle they’d installed, just in case. “No eating people.”
The Impala rolled up to the Roadhouse, three heads strong. Boisterous laughter had filled the ride, with Dean sparing nothing to avoid potholes and bounces to test the idea of heavenly shocks. More than one other stop was made, but it was less the where than the who-with. Various mementos filled the back seat from carnival prizes to cowboy boots, at least one heavenly drive thru had filled the car’s cupholders and Sam was grinning past the candy bar he nearly finished as the Impala swerved into the lot ahead of the bar.
Jack was never alone on the road of life, not even through college. Sam had known what books to recommend and even managed to gift a few war-torn copies of his old study books that had somehow survived the decades of chaos. Jack never told Sam that they never actually helped his courses, but they stayed nearby on his desk being worth more than any shiny new installations.
Castiel turned to face Dean, tipping his chin up the bare inch needed to meet the other man. “Exactly.” Dean’s tiny head tilt charmed the angel if the spark in his eye said anything. “Dean, what is a shadow?”
“I wanted… that life with you so badly. But it was my own mind that warped what I saw. My own doubt, of who I should, or shouldn’t be; I saw a world without me and thought that was your paradise. It took being, living, and saying in the moment to know and become instead--anything you could ever want, or need. To give you anything you dream, in life or in death.”
“Well, if she’s the first monster, and they’re the first monsters,” Dean tipped his head back and forth. “But we killed her.”
He looked up expectantly to the older brother just shy of adulthood who stood in a familiar leather jacket.
The young one latched on, squeezing tight. Soon, young Sam pulled away, lighting the fireworks and running away.
Dean tipped his head in acknowledgement and kept rolling. “I was maybe Jack’s age when the whole world got put on my shoulders. Then we turned around and did it to him. Now he’s out there wandering the earth like Cain from Kung Fu or whatever just to hold it up. And while I don’t think we can fix the ‘holding earth together’ part, I think he deserves better to live in it.”
Castiel didn’t mean to sound mysterious as he stroked at a strand of Dean’s hair thoughtfully, but it didn’t keep the hunter from being confused.
Dean and Castiel made it back to Bobby’s heaven, who bitched them up and down for leaving him with a screaming mess. They talked through the basics of the idea with the old hunter-- who only half tracked the situation but decided, “If you think it’ll work.”
“Oh heyyyy, come on, Sammy.” Dean threw his arms wide open, inviting his brother to reconsider. “One more night, in the garden out back. “We’ll get Jack on board. I’ve got some ideas. But for now,” Dean slammed the jukebox, kicking off Zeppelin’s
Either way, we kinda saw a good opportunity there. For a while we just had helper demons on basic cases, which isn’t quite the same trade as an angel but you know.
“Maybe we should stop calling it an It or a Thing, too.” Castiel realized how it sounded coming from the gamemaster.
“I dunno, maybe.” Dean dismissed while nosing along the angel’s jawline shamelessly, from ear towards neck.
“Um… hello!” Jack raised his hand to greet them, bright eyed. “I was just bringing in a few of the bees that were getting glowy so Cas could figure out what to do with them.”
The angel walked away towards the Impala without looking back. Dean softly looked after him before realizing he risked being left behind. Quickly bundling his stock and wares, he headed back to the car, where the angel already opened the back door for him to shove in his supplies.
“Yeah, you can-- you can say that again,” Dean obliged into the humor, still restrained but able to crack a grin and a laugh.
“Are we just gonna’ keep going back and forth about who saved who here?” Dean caught Castiel’s confused look. “I’m trying to come on to you here.”
“Yoooooooo,” Ash butt in from the side. “You talking about the cellar? Don’t go down there man, there’s some wild shit down there.”
“Everything but one piece has come to bear fruit,” Castiel considered, ignoring Ash moving to and fro in the background cleaning glasses.
Ultimately, they settled Levi in a new addition to the upstairs, as seemed easy to imagine. If not the side access to the archives, then their own little reinforced room of forest themed bedding, wall planted plastic cover lamp domes, and iron-everything.
. More than once, Sam had to clear his throat to remind them that the pair had easily taken several minutes ‘lining up a shot’ to the point of discomfort. In the end, Sam and Eileen won the gamble, and Dean and Cas won everything else.
“At least you know they’ll be in good hands when they’re gone.” Dean pointed out across the table, elbow propped on the back of the booth.
Dean hopped his way up onto the shallow stage, stealing the idle mic stand and making unnecessarily sweet love to it with a long raking finger up its length while continuing his exaggerated lipsync and pointing out to the others, curling up his fingers to invite them in.
“Busy. But he’ll come if you call. I just imagined we could protect this place as Regents to lift the burden of obligation from him.”
Dean Winchester and Castiel had settled into the vibrantly and colorfully lit stage-flanking tables. The hunter had a face full of memories from Swayze’s, while the angel simply knit his fingers and watched him immerse himself.
As the call transferred from their radio to Jody’s heaven--a system they had been developing at this point to avoid the Clown Car Patience Catastrophe all over again, Dean shot a glance to Cas.
“Glad to see you two finally worked something out.” Sam grinned crookedly. He paused. “So wait, if you two right now--” he gestured between both of them. “Does that mean mom and dad?”
“Are we going here again? Because like, I’m sure there’s at least three other me’s you’re running through the cosmic philosophy bint and there’s a perfectly good bed right there.”
Long rides of two brothers in Baby, wrestlers and chitters and finding partners in the life. Meeting Eileen, who blindsided Sam with magic and cut his hand as a test as their first meeting.
Dean nodded long thoughtfully. “Talk it out with her and see what she thinks. You know where to find us.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and kept tracking. “So somehow when heaven was reformed and the new garden was made, the creatures of the shadow of the garden came chasing the light, as they are wont to do.”
“Hey. I’m pretty down with the Having and the Being right now. Pretty sure Saying it’s sailed. But you know what, you stupid son of a bitch?”
Dean waded out of a stream in soggy boots, taking an immediate seat on the shoreline to dump out the water. He didn’t care it was just mental. Mentally, there was nothing more annoying than being stuck in sloshing boots.
Sam nodded that away, before glancing at Dean. Even in spirit he could read his brother like a book, and the older hunter clearly had something to say. Sam took a step back to give berth.
The angel continued. “But at some point, I’m going to need you to let go of any of the people you ate. We’ll get you better food, like we did at the fair, okay?”
“Levi? I know you can hear me.” Castiel knew the Leviathan weren’t totally mindless. “We’re going to let you stay here a little while. Dean’s bringing in what we won at the fair. They’re gifts. You keep those.”
He found himself standing in the kitchen, staring at the most absurd image: a freezeframe, a snapshot, of two goons and a leviathan screaming their way through a heavenly joy ride.
How was it any time the angel opened his mouth--or his mind, in this strange place--he was always affirming him; how did every word always sound like adoration, every thought a declaration of love, even when he didn’t say it so.
within the invisible box, his torquing lips and energetic face doing more dancing than the other six and a half feet of him.
“Damnit, Cas.” He threw it down, oversnapping his bravado to betray his embarrassment. It didn’t last long, because the wryness he spotted in the angel’s eyes was enough to make him crack a grin.
“Well that was-- definitely a thing,” Dean commented, glancing back. “I hope that’s easy to clean up.”
Castiel took his silence as opportunity to speak. “I wouldn’t change anything about what we have if you didn’t want it, Dean. But I certainly wouldn’t oppose it.”
Cas side-eyed him, but couldn’t help but crack a grin. “Dean, generally identities are made in the first few years of life, not the first few universal cycles. But if all it’s known is this, maybe you’re on the right track, we just have to find a better way than dragging it around.”
Dean’s face warped in a flash wave of micro expressed confusion and boyish flirtation grinning back at him. “I better be a damn good year.”
“Nothing about us is normal, I admit.” Said the male-vesseled self-proclaimed Queen of Heaven embodying the entire world around them as they rolled through neverending dreams in the hunter’s idea of freedom. “You know what I would compare us to?” Dean’s glimpse told the former angel that the hunter had pulled himself out of any embarrassment and was listening. “Have you ever heard of the Band of Thebes?”
It was easy to steal away into the mind of eternity just as much as the body of it. There was nothing they were immune to sharing in Being at this point, no memory too walled.
The initial awkwardness of a family dinner across multiple generations eventually cracked. Castiel found himself feeling strangely welcome amidst the passing of glasses and portions -- best dreamed incarnations of Winchester Surprise and favorite beers.
When Dean scoffed at the predictability of the ex-angel wanting to be a beekeeper, Castiel had explained to Dean that in some forms of theosophy, the soul was represented by bees. And, with souls being grown in the Garden, the new Occultum and Throne, the young and fresh ones deserved a quiet place to take their first form and work in harmony.
Castiel raised his brows. “Well, we haven’t heard about Jack--or Jod--coming back,” Castiel reasoned. “Your brother and Eileen have each other. And they knew to make some safe changes. I think they were ready for this. They’re fine.”
Sam and Eileen shared a look, then glanced back to Dean. “Alright,” Sam took the first step. “I think we’ll go back. With Jack.”
“I shouldn’t love you. The old oath forbade it. And yet I found myself drawn to you. And then… I saw that future.”
Elsewhere, Castiel and Dean looked up from their idle perch at the lakeside on a dock where Dean was fishing with the angel’s bystanding company.
“I saw a world where you were happy, without me. A life you would live, able to be free to pursue your dreams.”
Castiel continued on as he approached the table, rimming the glass with his fingers but not lifting it.
Eight heavens later, there had been no success. Castiel was beginning to suspect that Dean Winchester was using the shackled Leviathan to fill out some post-mortem bucket list of his own.
Sam took in a breath and slowly nodded through it. “Yeah. I’m sure they’re taking care of each other. We’ll get up there and find some sort of futuristic utopia with… classic cars and naked green women. And probably Beyonce.” He laughed off Eileen’s confusion, waving it away. “They’re fine. Maybe later we can do a seance and try to break through. It’s worked before when we wanted to talk to Bobby.”
“And while I would happy to have Saint Dean, the Bouncer of Heaven’s Gates keeping everything running right here, I just thought we might want to share it?”
“Okay?” Jack looked between them, “I’m gonna go back to… Jod things.” Jack pointed awkwardly over his shoulder, turned, and disappeared into the aether.
Dean gruffed, muttering his protest while unhooking it and setting it back into the water, “Whatever happened to no cosmic plans?”
Castiel sighed, slipping out of bed and ‘fixing’ his hair, which actually leaned more towards tossing it worse while collecting the grey bathrobe and pulling it around himself. “He hasn’t done anything wrong.”
Dean nodded through it eagerly, picked up his mug and took an overlarge beer swig to chase the thought down with a refreshing burst of air to finish it. Ah.
The roadhouse was calm, but still not empty. Even the few souls in it gave it life. Without the endless bustle, there was a sense of security--like being in the safest place in the world.
Castiel’s lips wrapped in a calm smile, turning to look back out into the memory of the wilds. “We had a life there.”
“Yeah, long story, trust me.” Dean put up a hand, cutting it through the air to chop the cord on that conversation, “Don’t try to understand. Just think Rowena and hell and leave it there.”
The angel tried to break the weighty silence with a jovial note, “Jack really made it all loud, didn’t he?”
Sam raised his eyebrows suggestively, “Well, I was thinking of going out for a drive. I could swing by there, pick you up, and we do something tonight?”
However many hours or years they spent wading through memories, what they saw, and shared, they knew they would never forget.
“Yes. If you take it on a search for itself and what makes it full, rather than stealing anothers’ light--it just might break through.”
Ellen crossed by, carrying a platter towards a table of familiar faces-- Rufus, among others, with them. “Everyone knew it’d be like that, honey..”
“Okay. So now the Leviathans are wanting to, what? Make it to heaven? Or just have snacks on souls?”
Dean let out a ‘Huh?’, but Jack understood perfectly. “Oh! You’re right. I could go back to when Sam’s still there.”
“I am so sorry. For giving you grief, Dean.” the angel's voice called emerald sights back open to the road.
Summers of Love with Crowley still had charm. Dean as a child all over again. And Castiel, bonding with Claire. Rowena chiding Castiel privately of being shattered at the altar of Winchester, and his proud declaration of the meaning of family it gave him.
“Of course,” he gravelled in the most familiar way before moving on. “When I saw the future, I saw you without me. I saw you happy. I saw… heaven, for myself, and Jack; not knowing what that meant. And then I died.”
Back on earth, Sam mulled over his laptop, hand propped on his chin as a back client scoured for searches, analyzed data and potential cases. The main window, however, was Eileen staring back at him from the bunker.
Many stories were shared: of John’s early childhood by Henry, who apparently dreamed of owning a hot dog stand when he was small. Of Mary’s over-willingness to talk about the gross things Dean did with what he found in his diapers to all at the table, particularly fixated on Castiel’s response. Castiel informing them of trips to Dodge City and Dean’s still-living fixation with cowboys.
Castiel pondered. “Well, if theory so far is correct, they’re essentially a form of conscious shadow. No soul. No individual id or ego.”
Dean emerged back from the cellar, where an ex-angel had taken to frantically pacing. When the door rattled, Castiel swiveled sharply, running up to greet him and pulling him in tightly.
Dean morbidly nodded through, eyes downward and overanalyzing the table grains his mind had come up with.
Castiel moved on, stopping at a game hut again. Dean had to reign in the leviathan bursting for the game’s fish bowls. “No eating the fishes either! Geez. It’s like having a toddler, keeps trying to put everything in its face.”
Monster movies and hiding from phobias laid out jamming to the eye of the tiger in the impala were interspersed with quiet bench conversations.
“No, it just kind of came to us. We looked it up and it meant ‘Joined in Harmony’ and I mean, considering all events to date--for you guys, for us--it just felt right.”
“It's not goodbye. It's 'I'll see you later'.” Dean affirmed brusquely. “C’mere.” Sam wasn’t leaving without one last firm, brotherly hug that lasted a short eternity of its own, each brother tentative to let go. He slid away. “You do it right this time, you hear me? Don’t worry about here, we’ll hold down the fort. Rowena’s got downstairs. No summoning cosmic space invaders by mistake and we should be good.”
“No--no. It’s--wow. Okay.” Dean searched the ceiling and its bizarre antler chandelier design for some sort of answer. “Man why didn’t we ever do that on earth?”
“Sorry to say I didn’t go all dramatic warrior with Eve and her minions or whatever to get it for you. Actually, it was pretty chill. Just a giant creepy assed tree and that wind that never stops.”
Sometimes it chilled Dean how much of a boyish shadow of Castiel the nephilim could be.  “Yeah uh--anyway. I feel like we kind of jipped you on the earth-thing.”
Once a mighty bass was hanging on the line, Castiel watched Dean proudly celebrate and wave it around like a prize from a crane game. Seeing the daily, eternal youthful vigor of the hunter was all the angel could have ever asked for.
Dean found himself leaning into the angel, whispering feigned criticism, “This is a good memory for you?”
