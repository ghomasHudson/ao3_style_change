“Ta. You’re doing that quite well, actually.” They are standing close, there isn’t much space between the tub and the basin. The atmosphere between them is charged again, Sherlock is badly distracted by John’s naked chest and the wonderful way he smells.

It was a very early September morning. Outside on Baker Street it was still silent and dark. John didn't want to open his eyes. He wanted the images to

Sherlock’s parents come out of the house and, a few moments later, Mycroft. John takes a look around while the Holmes’s start arguing about which wine to have with the lasagna. John doesn’t listen, he is too busy taking in the garden. It is a beautifully arranged cottage garden and larger than John had expected. The lawn is interrupted by groups of bushes, tall grass and little walls. They divide the vast garden into many secluded corners and hidden niches, places John didn’t see from the house. Whoever handles this garden must be a great lover of flowers and plants. There are so many flower beds it almost seems a bit chaotic. There are blossoms everywhere, the air is loaded with different scents and the humming of the bees.
What does bother him is the fake relationship, even though he has grown a bit accustomed to this weird plan. He asked Sherlock about that a few days ago. About what he wants John to do.

Despite all his sleeping, John felt groggy. After he had taken his luggage upstairs, he sat on his bed, looking out of the window. He fought the impulse to
Sherlock cries out a broken groan as they come almost simultaneously. John crushes a hard kiss on Sherlock’s mouth, forceful and filthy, which grows softer and gentler with their ebbing orgasm.

“Good, I started to think they never would. With John getting married and all.“ He sighs with relief.
Sherlock watches them. He doesn’t quite know how to handle any of this or how this will affect his life.

Sherlock opens his eyes. After a moment of disorientation, his body straightens. He casts a look of something like thankfulness at John and gets out of the car. John thanks the driver and follows Sherlock. He is leaning against the wall, not bothering to open the door. John fumbles his keys out of his pockets, as Mrs Hudson opens from inside the house.
John tries to get back to sleep, enjoying being held like this, but he can’t. It is too exciting, too great a joy. After a while, he touches Sherlock’s
In reply, Sherlock gets two forks out of the drawer, sits down and opens the boxes. They eat in silence. This is more than eating. This is sustaining the basic needs of life. Food, drink, a safe place to stay. With someone to watch over you.
John closed his eyes and exhaled. He was grateful. Downstairs, Sherlock got into his bed, shifting over to the other side and making room for John.
With all things settled between them, they doze off for another few hours. When the rain has stopped and Mycroft and Marcus are having breakfast downstairs, Margaret knocks on the door again.
The next day, Sherlock tells John about Mycroft’s visit. John listens without saying a word. He just clenches and unclenches his fist.
After a few days, the hospital where his daughter had died called John. She could be buried now. It was only John, Sherlock and Mrs Hudson at the funeral.

She smiles at Sherlock in utter delight. Then there is a knock on the door and Lestrade enters the kitchen.
Sherlock has vanished into the house. John hears him shout something about Mycroft putting his sodding umbrella out of the way. Mrs Holmes – Margaret – rushes into the house, still smiling hugely.
Thank you so much, all of you. You've helped me so much and made writing this fic such a pleasure. You're invaluable, each and every one of of you.

John’s thoughts are interrupted by the noise of the train. During the ride, John writes something about their last case on the blog while Sherlock stares out of the window for most of the time. They arrive in the Holmes’s small home town and they take a cab from the station to the house of Sherlock’s parents. Sherlock’s ability to summon a cab out of nowhere seems to work everywhere.
John draws a line with his finger down from Sherlock’s jaw, along his neck and collarbone, across the pale pink scar on his sternum. He raises his hand

Special thanks to Cindy van Wilder a.k.a. links for her French translation! I'd planned this chapter for months, but I hadn't anticipated how difficult and plain wrong it would feel to write the slurs. My French is practically non-existant, and so I asked the amazing Cindy if she could help me with the translation -- sending these paragraphs to her felt even more disturbing and painful. So, thank you so much for you support, Cindy!
In other words: This is the first of three to four angst-heavy chapters. I'll let you know at the beginning of the chapters if the angst is going on or if things are taking a turn to the better, in case some of you want to skip this or wait until things are finally resolved. Also, I added a few tags.

“Sherlock, we need to know. The doctors are running some tests on your blood, but we need to know what you have taken. Please tell me.“
He grabs the t-shirt he slept in last night and cleans them up a bit. Then he lies down, nestling into Sherlock’s side, kissing him on his cheek bone. They lie there for a while. With a voice gentler than John would have ever thought possible, Sherlock says, “John. I might be in love with you.”

Sherlock is back at two in the morning. The case was thrilling, but simple enough to solve in the end. He missed John at the crime scene. A lot, actually.

Sherlock takes off his coat and shoes. After a while, John adds, “I… I just wouldn’t like being in my own now.“
John tries to wipe the small white spot right beneath his lower lip off as lightly as possible. But he fails, and the movement becomes something heavier, loaded with want and desire, when he touches Sherlock’s lush lip with his thumb.

John puts his bag on the floor, takes a t-shirt and his pyjama bottoms out and gets changed. He folds his clothes and puts them on the chair (military habit). He looks at the book shelves while Sherlock is probably brushing his teeth. John recognizes some books on chemistry, medicine, forensics and science. There are a few old school books and even a children’s book on pirates and a copy of "The Beekeeper’s Handbook". Violin notes, and even some CDs. Right above Sherlock’s surprisingly big bed hangs a picture of a bee like the one in his bedroom in 221b. Next to it there is a fading shadow from a picture that used to hang there. It was probably the one to be found in Sherlock’s bedroom in London.

Six weeks, it has been: forty-two days, seventeen texts, and five orders of chips in the small hours of the morning. Six weeks since John has spoken to him.
Hesitance. Not borne out of uncertainty, Sherlock observes clinically, and he thinks about the way John’s behavior for two years had seemed strangely off-key in a way that nudged at his recognition: now he sees the bitterness of love severed before its time and resurrected only to taint everything around it like necrosis; John’s rage the brighter for lost love. Murders have been committed for less, he knows this firsthand, and his pride tugs at him—it isn’t fair, he had saved John’s life and Mrs Hudson’s and Gavin’s and given up his livelihood for the interminable trudge of international espionage and wet work; he received a stab wound perilously close to his kidneys and cigarette burns on his shoulderblade and has scars spanning the length of his back, all this in service of saving them, and it isn’t
He had paused in the hallway against his better judgement, already regretting the manner in which he had lashed out at Mycroft: not for the sake of his housing, which was unimportant, but because he knew that Mycroft cared for him ruinously and it was cruel to pretend otherwise.
Science is, at its heart, a process of trial and error. Mistakes are inevitable, Sherlock knows. It’s all in the name of progress in the end.
“Well, you never know,” Sherlock says, beginning to chuckle himself, “I could always come across a Santa who doubles as a human trafficker, there’s still time,” and they laugh as they keep hold a handcuffed elf in the middle of an ice rink and wait for Scotland Yard.
“The holiday one and the beige one,” Sherlock says, waving a hand dismissively as he gestures at the sink. John walks into the kitchen with the air of a man who knows exactly what he will find but hopes against hope that he’s wrong. He’s not, of course. What’s left of the jumpers is a sodden mass of charcoal, still steaming slightly. Surprising that John didn’t smell the acrid smoke on his way into the flat. He looks closely at the slight shine above John’s upper lip: he had applied a menthol balm to his philtrum to cover up an unpleasant lingering scent, one that clung to his—ah. Sherlock narrows his eyes. “A patient threw up on your shoes today.”
“You thought I knew,” Sherlock concludes heavily. “That I’d—known, and turned you down; that I didn’t want you. But John, how could you not know—?”
The loophole is large enough to drive a tank through, and Sherlock smiles gleefully. Oh, it really is Christmas! Caught up in plans, he absently says, “Yes, alright, I’ll replace the kettle.”
He could tell John, of course; his use of the homeless network as an aid to his work is well known to John—but he dislikes the possessive note in John’s voice and refuses to indulge his delusion that Sherlock needs to justify his whereabouts, he tells himself, steadfastly not thinking about the small plastic bag the man had held in front of him [an ignominious package for such an otherworldly substance, one that would make him brilliant and uncaring—no.]
“At least,” John says, slanting him a look. “But, and answer me honestly—do you even know what you want right now? I don’t. I know what I feel, and I don’t like myself for a lot of it. That’s not something for you to carry.”
“You shouldn’t burned mine in the first place,” John says and inhales sharply, as though about to shout. He lets out the breath slowly. “Replacing them is the least you could do. But. This is nice.”
And oh, isn’t that a lovely thought: John in his bed, curled into his sheets, head resting on his pillow. His scent would linger in the fabric—
John doesn’t move even a centimeter away. He holds his ground, hand tightly grasping the forgotten glass, and Sherlock knows that here be minefields: the tension in John’s features tells him that this is not the only secret he carries. But John’s rage is simmering beneath the surface—carefully, always so controlled—and Sherlock makes another deduction, one that ought to have been obvious:
“I mean,” John says, worn features illuminated by the lone lamp, “that he’d started to have yours fixed as well, but then something stopped. And Mrs Hudson’s is fine; has been for two weeks, she told me. So I ask again: what did you do? And, you know, you only repeat things when you’re deflecting. Bit of a tell, that.”
“Obviously not. It’s not as though we talk about these sorts of things, after all. Or even as though we talk anymore.” The last is intended as a jab but it comes out petulantly; Sherlock wills himself not to flush at his childishness, passingly grateful for the half-demolished flat with its surfeit of shadows.
“Please,” Sherlock says, “stay and watch the dawn with me,” and he is uncomfortably aware that he is asking for too much: asking for something foolish, at any rate; but this is belied by the urgency he feels. It is almost a physical need, to see John’s weary face gilded by the first light of dawn and know that he is real and maybe, just possibly, the smallest of John’s fingers would brush against his without John pulling back: something akin to desperation is evident in his voice and he hates it, hates his vulnerability.
He agrees with John: he doesn’t know anymore. But—”John,” he says, “you have to know that I’m going to hurt you. Not on purpose, you understand, but it’s who I am, and so you might want to leave regardless.”
John goes to a conference in Edinburgh the next week and returns to disabled smoke alarms, a kitchen table with a hole burnt clear through the wood, and a new laptop.
The silence, as it falls, no longer has the same sharpness to it. “I’d best be going,” John says after a bit, and his words are similarly transformed; no longer a threat but mere acknowledgement that life goes on and needs living.
John rises to his feet, glass in hand, and crosses to the opposite side of the room. He moves like a caged animal, sleek and languid and lethal. “Oh?” His tone deceptively mild. “And why is that?”
“Fine,” Sherlock says. It occurs to him that he may be smiling more than is considered appropriate, which is confirmed when John says, exasperated, “At least, you know,
“It has to be true.” John runs a hand over his hair, not yet used to the new style; it disarrays. He looks, in every way, like he’s coming apart. “Because if it isn’t—” He takes another sip of whiskey straight from the flask. “If it isn’t true, then that would mean that you’re a good man. And you aren’t. You can’t be.”
The ice skaters stare as Sherlock stands, covered in hot chocolate thrown at him by a little girl who preferred the elf to the man chasing him. “With the Met,” he says, flashing Lestrade’s badge at the crowd, which begins to disperse. “Um,” Sherlock says eloquently as he turns to John, still holding the elf, adrenalin coursing through his blood, “happy Christmas?”
And here is the crux of the matter: he no longer knows. Once upon a time he knew John better than he knew himself; he could have deduced exactly how to bring him back to himself, to put down the bottle and use a gun for something other than morbid half-longings. The slightest trace of gun oil on his index finger the day they'd met—that was all Sherlock had needed and he had pulled John the other side of London and back to remind him of a lesson he should have known by heart: that throwing yourself into the path of danger is, paradoxically, a way to stay safe from yourself. Six years on and John still needs to save him from himself, but he is no longer the same person. [The one who laughed, the one who cared.] In fact, Sherlock thinks, settling his gaze on John’s swept back hair, brilliant even in the low light, and his neat cardigan, a better quality than Sherlock has ever seen him wear voluntarily, his appearance is put together in a way that speaks of a refusal to be seen falling apart. John reminds him of himself now, of fires that burn too bright and then not at all, and it is horrifying to think that this is what he has done to him: saved him, only to shatter him.
Coat swirling around his calves, he turned, furious: at Mycroft, at Mary, at the impossible and absurd turns his life had taken and most of all at John. “Mummy was right, you know,” he said, the words bitter as they rolled off his tongue. “You should have done better. This is all your fault.”
“Ah.” A beat, while John takes in the flat once more: exposed drywall, flooring half-done and unfinished, threatening to splinter in the foot of anyone foolish enough to walk barefoot across the room. Sherlock has to admit the two chairs and the couch are incongruous in the unfinished room, but it wasn’t as though he’d expected visitors: only Mrs Hudson, who merely clucked her tongue and told him to use her spare closet, “so your lovely suits don’t wrinkle and pick up the scent of drywall, dear, it’s far more difficult to intimidate people if they think you’re a poncy interior decorator.” “What did you do, then?” John asks.
“Why are you holding flowers?” Sherlock asks. He’s filled with a sudden, vicious desperation to escape the inevitable conclusion; to turn the focus onto John. To force John to bare some small part of himself, so Sherlock isn’t the only one in the room who feels flayed open.
John rubs his forehead wearily as he translates this. It’s a comfortable, familiar gesture; Sherlock likes it enormously, particularly when he is the source of it. “Which of my jumpers did you burn?”
“What else is there, though?” John says quietly: a rhetorical question, because both of them know the answer intimately.
“Don’t think this gets you out of giving me something for Christmas,” John warns, tugging the ribbon loose with gentle fingers and, incongruously, ripping the paper. He holds up a jumper and examines it. It’s 100% cashmere, Sherlock knows, with a crew neck and rib-knit cuffs; he’s far more interested in seeing how the grey-green plays off John’s coloring.
Three hours later, he sets the last load of presents on the sofa, straightens with a grimace, and sees John standing in the living room with a bouquet of flowers in one hand, looking both unsure and determined. For a moment they only look at each other.
He watches the ember burn just beyond his fingertips; exhales smoke. “No,” he says simply. “It won’t.”
Sherlock sits silently. He feels brittle and so he turns up his coat collar and sets his face into something hard and aloof, but that’s no longer an effective shield: John doesn’t turn away as he once did, angry at Sherlock’s coldness; instead he looks at Sherlock as though he understands, and somehow this is harder to bear.
[“You called him family,” Mycroft had said two weeks ago in the backseat of a ubiquitous black sedan.
Examining them, Sherlock breathes, “Amaryllis. Eranthis. And—viscum album?” He looks at John in wonderment. “You gave me a bouquet of poisonous plants.”
His voice has tapered off by the end of the tirade, and John faces him head-on now. John is tired, maybe even exhausted judging by lines of his face, and so is Sherlock: he wishes passingly that he could settle under the blanket on the couch and sleep, as he once had, secure in the knowledge that John would be there when he woke. But they have to get through this first.
His silence is an answer. “Jesus, Sherlock,” John sighs. They’re quiet as the rubbish bins are emptied, metallic clanging ricocheting through the air. “This is a bad idea,” he states as the vehicle rumbles away.
“Yeah, well, it’s already torn. Adding bodily fluids wasn’t the deciding factor, you deciding to dive in front of a knife was. On fucking Christmas Eve.”
It is not the response Sherlock expected to hear; then again, he doesn’t know what he expected. He tries to keep his lips from twisting with bitterness. “Give my goodbyes to Watson,” he tells John, who merely stares at him for a moment, concern melding with the barest hint of amusement.
On December 19th Sherlock finds his new strategy in the form of a series of poisonings at Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland. He bullies John into his coat and scarf and they end up chasing the poisoner, posing as a hired elf, through the market. The shrieks of traumatized children follow in their wake. It ends with Sherlock, John, and the elf-cum-poisoner sprawled in a pile on the ice rink while Sherlock cuffs the man’s hands behind his back.
It is obvious John wants to leave: his knee jiggles and he takes large, recklessly certain swigs of his whiskey in an attempt to hide his tremor, but Sherlock can still see it. But he does not walk out, and an awareness seeps uncomfortably into his brain that John might have chosen to stay solely because Sherlock himself told him to. One word, John had once said, and the depth of that kind of loyalty is—impossible to contemplate. So he doesn’t. And John has another reason for staying; must have.
“Posh arsehole,” John mutters, but he sounds almost. . . grateful. And then John’s eyes dart up to meet his for a second before he returns to contemplating his drink, and Sherlock sees that he was wrong: that John had hoped for mercy and now, having received it, resents Sherlock for bestowing it in the first place. It ties a knot in the left side of Sherlock’s chest as he thinks, staring at John.
John has gone still now. He looks worn but dangerous, tightly restrained: this, Sherlock thinks, is a man who would not think twice about pulling a trigger, and he refuses to allow the thought any further but the ghost of it nudges at the back of his mind—the question of where the barrel would be pointed.
like. But for some unbelievable reason, I prefer you alive to dead. I’ve no idea why. You’ve destroyed my wardrobe, my laptop, and my mattress; you throw yourself in every dangerous situation available in the greater London area; there are ears in Tupperware on the top shelf of the fridge—the fucking top shelf, Sherlock—and you’ve chased off all of my dates for years. So. God only knows why.”
The darkness in the flat has shifted incrementally as the dawn approaches. Soon the rubbish collectors will be by, and the 5 a.m. regulars at Speedy’s will exchange tepid little greetings as they pass through the entrance, and the early morning joggers will be followed by the rest of the world and the chaos of another day. Sherlock wonders how he will fit into it. “So what now?”
“Of course I didn’t set it up,” Sherlock returns, ignoring the latter part of the statement, which is just as inaccurate as the former in its own way. He never relies on mere luck, obviously, and he therefore has a plan: not only will he give John a Christmas-themed case, but he’ll also provide John with an opportunity to showcase his skills as a soldier. After such occasions John stands tall and proud and grins recklessly at him, and Sherlock can glimpse who John must have been during the war. It threatens to take his breath away.
In the dark room John inclines his head slightly, acknowledging Sherlock’s presence. “I should have known.”
John presses down on the edges of the bandage, ensuring its adherence. “I’ll check it tomorrow, but you’ll be fine. Might scar a bit.” He sounds exhausted.
“I did,” Sherlock confirmed, impatient. John had not responded to any of his texts, even the one about the triple murder in Chiswick, and the silence had taken a malignant turn: his mind supplied images of John held in a basement by kidnappers, John bleeding out in an alley, John drunk and suffocating on his own vomit, John [worst of all] seeing his attempts to reach out and ignoring him, deciding he was better off alone. Without Sherlock. “Why are you wasting my time with this—haven’t you any sweets that need eating? Where is he?”
“I thought—” He stops, gathers himself. It was supposed to be for John: not the injury but the case, the danger, the
He reads want in the dilation of John’s pupils and the set of his mouth: John wants to fuck him, and Sherlock finds himself contemplating the idea; he might even enjoy it, with John’s hands grasping his hips and John’s breath panting on his back and John’s cock moving in him, but there is the aftermath to consider. Bruises blooming dark on his hips and on the tender skin of his neck after John leaves, because—wouldn’t he, wouldn’t he leave? John doesn’t want a fuck, even, he just thinks he does: he wants to possess Sherlock and make him plead and probably even to hurt him, and Sherlock thinks he has had enough of bruises. John would only hate himself more come morning in any case, and Sherlock thinks about self-loathing and how it wears and sometimes snaps.
“Right,” John says. “Right.” There’s the clink of glass and metal, and John sets a flask down next his feet, a glass to his lips. Flask, glass, whiskey: he’d brought the supplies from his own flat then, the one where he lives with his daughter and the ghost of his wife; he hadn’t planned on seeing Sherlock, thought that he’d be able to drink alone in a ruined flat, and Sherlock doesn’t know what it means.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose at the mundanity of this [but mostly, he will admit, to see the way John bites back a smile at his petulant expression].
John looks at the box on the kitchen table: glossy silver paper tied up in a red satin bow. Sherlock fidgets.
“We could talk about why you plan on leaving, or why you blame me for—well, everything, I suppose—that has happened over the past six years, or what I did while I was, as you so quaintly call it, ‘off playing hide and seek’; and we might even discuss why you’re here tonight, because I
“You’ve been trying to give me gifts these last few weeks, haven’t you,” John says. Hesitant but certain. “The Christmas-y case because you know I like Christmas, even though it wasn’t quite up to your usual standard. The jumper and the laptop and the mattress and the, the kettle. In a twisted way I think you tried to give me a gift by putting yourself in danger, which, don’t even get me started on that—”
Sherlock presses his lips together, a dull ache resonating through his chest. “Past tense,” he observes.
“No.” Sherlock shakes his head. He doesn’t say: That’s just what you tell yourself so you don’t have to feel guilty, that you hate me for it. He doesn’t say: I wonder how you walk around with such loathing. How you bear it.
“At least tell me this,” Sherlock says after a while, once silence almost become a third party in the room. “Why is it that you can’t look at me without steeling yourself beforehand?”
John drags his gaze up from the bottom of the glass. “I don’t know what you mean,” he says, meeting Sherlock’s eyes defiantly. Quickly. Too quickly.
“I did,” John says. His voice is defiant in a way that speaks of hidden shame and his muscles are coiled, the tension obvious even through the staid exterior of a navy cardigan: his control is beginning to fracture. He clears his throat. “I did,” John says again, shifting his weight as though readying for a brawl, and Sherlock has no doubt that John would give as good as he got if they came to blows; dawn would break with both men in A&E and their partnership irrevocably lost.
Somewhere a child is crying. The sound grows louder as Sherlock approaches, but remains far away. Some memories imprint with smells and sounds, even tastes. Though only an echo, Sherlock finds himself looking for the source of the noise.
"Oh God, yes." The haunted look faded away and in its place came determination and a hint of exhilaration.
Mycroft looked up as an alert sounded on his phone. Someone had used his ID to access Baskerville. Mycroft knew that there could only be one person responsible, his brother. He placed a call to the facility asking them to escort Sherlock to Diogenes. The creak of the door caught his attention and Anthea slipped in. She took one look at his face and frowned knowing that something was amiss. "What happened?" She asked.
“Bill?” John whispered carefully creeping closer to the mans still form. John’s breath quickened and his heart raced as he took in the man’s appearance. The inky curls were tangled and matted with grime. The high cheek bones were smudged with dirt and the Cupid-bow lips were cracked and bleeding and even with the eyes closed that face was unmistakable. The face that had haunted John’s dreams ever since the fall. Sherlock? No, it couldn’t be; he was dead. John had seen it with his own eyes.
"That, my son, remains to be seen." It was that same night that Greg learned the truth about the world and about the evils that lay hidden in the shadows and the few that hunted them.
“Since when have I allowed Mycroft to influence my judgement?” John remained silent as the answer was never.
"Tell me, I need to know. The other demon in the church, what do you know about it?" She insisted causing Sherlock to frown. He and everyone else involved assumed that the two demons had been working together. "Don't tell me the great Sherlock Holmes hasn't figured it out. Show me what you're made of. After all, brainy is the new sexy." She whispered stroking his face before leaning back and staring into his eyes. Her irises turned red as she attempted to cast him under her spell of seduction. "Look at those cheekbones. I could cut myself slapping that face, would you like me to try?" Irene challenged. "Tell me." Her voice turned hypnotic and Sherlock could feel the pull of a spell.
"Yes," Sherlock answered pulling Molly's attention away from John and back to him. Molly frowned as she looked at the hunter. He was deathly pale, but more worrisome than his complexion was the fear in his eyes. He could sense it too; the darkness.
"But his light…his blood…I need it." John trailed off looking torn. At the mention of Greg's light, Sherlock eyes moved to the holy water font that still contained a small amount of the water that Greg had blessed and anointed with his own blood, which was still glowing softly, infused with Greg's light and holy magic.
"I have been reliably informed that I don't have one." Sherlock replied trying desperately to keep the panic out of his voice, but not quite succeeding. Moriarty could sense it just below the surface and felt a thrill at the knowledge that he was the one who caused it.
“What about Mycroft?” John challenged as he recalled the powerful mage attempting to kill him after the ritual. It was then Sherlock’s turn to scoff.
“What was it like?” His brother’s question brought it all back. So many things were lost in the rut, but Mycroft could remember clearly afterwards. He could still hear their Uncle’s voice.
"I don't understand what is special about you, why you are worth all this effort and subterfuge. You were the end game all along. John Watson, he was the lure. I was to keep him alive. They knew you would eventually come looking. I have just received new orders. You're coming with me. They're not done with you yet, not by a long shot."
"Father…I need to know the truth and if that means taking religious vows then so be it. But remember, I did warn you. I'll be a lousy priest." The old man smiled and answered softly.
"I'm doing my best to protect him, Sherlock. I truly am, but there are limits to my influence." Mycroft admitted with a sigh. "Finish the job, brother, but do it right. You cannot afford any more missteps. You're nearly there." Mycroft insisted before turning away and disappearing into the shadows of night leaving Sherlock both enraged and helpless.
"You sound quite happy about being slapped, I always suspected that you were a masochist." Sherlock quipped allowing a teasing note to enter his voice. Lestrade chuckled.
The sounds of gunfire still surrounded him as he was blindfolded, bound, and gagged as he overheard enemy soldiers arguing loudly in Pashto. This one, Officer, the deeper voice of the two insisted as John was pulled roughly to his feet. Too old, kill him. The other countered as he shoved the barrel of his rifle into John's side. But look at the scars. This one is a fighter, a survivor. The deeper voice pointed out as he ran a hand over the expansive scar, which decorated John's chest and shoulder in a distinctive starburst pattern. John grit his teeth and bucked uselessly against the bindings. Very well, we'll take him as prisoner, but I still think you're wrong. He'll never survive the treatment.
"How did you meet?" John asked. Sherlock sighed and for a moment John was convinced that he wouldn't be getting answer to that question, but Sherlock spoke after a pause.
Before Molly could reply John exploded. "Sherlock! Are you mad? You're asking her to raise the dead?!" Sherlock pinned John with smug look and retorted.
"I'll ask you again, John. Who are you? You're setting off my wards. There's something you're hiding. Whatever it is, it'll come out in the end. Secrets always do." Greg pressed. "I don't like going in blind, at least with Sherlock I know what I'm getting into." He added bitterly.
"Stop!" Sherlock shouted catching her wrist. She hissed at him angrily. "Do you have a death wish? You saw what just happened."
"Well, he certainly stood up to you and defended Sherlock. Even if we are missing something, he seems very loyal to him." Anthea pointed out.
John then heard his jailer's footsteps. The men, as expected, were in possession of a syringe and the medication which the syringe contained was quickly emptied into John's IV. John heard one murmur in Pashto "Hard to believe that he has lived thirty days. Phase one is complete on to phase two." The pain floated away as the medication took effect. John struggled to stay awake as the drugs threatened to pull him back under. His heart rate doubled as he felt the restraints being removed. He gagged as the Nasogastric tube was pulled out and whimpered in relief as the soiled diaper was changed. "Type II," one of the men said briskly as he cleaned John's genitals. John looked down at himself and frowned. His penis and testicles looked smaller, much smaller. His pubic hair was now thin and downy. The thought fluttered away and John sighed in relief as a clean diaper was applied and the sting of a needle pierced his buttocks. He blinked blurrily as he fought sleep. This medication was different, rather than knocking him out completely, he just felt sleepy and very relaxed. Most likely a narcotic like morphine in combination with a benzodiazepine like valium. John struggled to swallow and moisten his parched throat.
“I don’t have friends.” Too late to explain to John who hadn’t heard the rest of the statement. “I just have one.”
"Stake him." He insisted causing Sherlock's blood to run cold. No, there had to be something. Anything. He would try anything.
“That isn’t--I’ve got no ulterior motives here. I’m just trying to tell you how I feel.” Greg cursed himself for letting it get this far.
"Well, hello Johnny, may I call you Johnny?" John grit his teeth as he was called by his childhood nickname. It was a name only spoken to him by his mother and Harry when they were feeling sentimental. The sound of that name on this man's tongue turned John's stomach. "I've been wanting to properly meet you for the longest time." He confessed.
John breathed a sigh of relief as the scorching heat was diminished with nightfall. He moved towards the barracks unsure of exactly what to expect. Not so much worried as annoyed. How he could have gotten on Sholto's shit list was a mystery to him. He had reenlisted in order to serve in combat and if that wasn't a possibility then John always had other options. He had his military issued weapon on his person at all times. It was like an old friend, always ready and waiting should the need arise. He pushed Bill Murray's plea out of his mind. He would do what needed to be done. "Watson, Attention." John's body responded by rote as his straightened and saluted.
Greg didn't know what to think, but suddenly things made a hell of a lot more sense. Sherlock's suicide was a front and Mycroft had pulled strings in order to allow John to reenlist. The question was why had Mycroft done it? John certainly would have been safer in London and Sherlock would have been far less likely to be distracted from his mission knowing that John was safe. "I'm calling Mycroft." Greg said as he pulled out his phone before Molly could protest.
Greg felt a chill run down his spine as he watched the news footage. There were now four dead priests in four nights each from a different church. There was no sign of traumatic injury and the bodies were being examined to discover the cause of death. Greg knew deep in his bones that this was no coincidence. Something dark was afoot. Greg debated his next move. He was not well known amongst the priesthood. His order was small and secretive. He was currently housed in Westminster's rectory, although he did not perform the traditional duties of a parish priest. He did not say mass routinely, or hear confessions. Greg couldn't remember the last time that he had performed a wedding or baptism. Few in the large congregation would recognize his face and even fewer knew his name. It was safer that way. He was busy hunting the darkness using his talents in other ways. He performed blessings, just not the traditional kind. He routinely performed exorcisms as well as last rites.
The words cut off suddenly, and John doesn’t look as though he’ll find them again soon. Sherlock moves away from the wall to sit in his old chair across from John, plucking the glass from his fingers as he sits. John doesn’t protest.
John thinks before he replies, his eyebrows lowering in thought, and Sherlock loves them—loves him. It terrifies him, even having sat with the thought for years: he carried it around like a note, worrying the paper until it softened from movement and darkened from frequent handling. “Because this is my life,” John says finally. “This city is my home. My work is here. And you’re here, and—God knows, I don’t want to presume anything. But don’t you feel that, somewhere along the line, we lost sight of everything? Aside from my daughter, you’re the most important person in my life. Maybe we can work out way toward being friends once more.”
“I have to wonder if you even care about me, honestly,” John says quietly. He’s not angry but resigned, and somehow that’s worse. “It doesn’t often seem like it.”
John looks up at the fairy lights hanging above them and laughs helplessly. “Oh God,” he manages to say, between burst of laughter, “this is, without a doubt, the maddest Christmas I’ve ever had. You’ve outdone yourself, you know; I no longer need a Christmas gift. This was perfect.”
John looks at him then, unmoving, and Sherlock can see the ghost of the man he once was: the ghosts of who they both were, really, and he thinks about how John had gone from seeing him as human to thinking he was something more exalted; he remembers how glorious it had felt, the near-worship, and knows that he would have given it up in a nanosecond had he known its final destination: here, this flat, with John sitting across from him and looking as though he’s been punched by the reminder that Sherlock is flesh and bone. That he knows pain.
“Yes,” John says, not looking at him, and it goes quiet again but neither man leaves. Why this is, Sherlock doesn’t know.
Regardless, intentionally infecting John’s mattress with a particularly virulent species of bedbugs might not have been his best idea. “It was an experiment, and anyway the bed aggravated your injury,” Sherlock tries. And: “I need you in top form if you’re to keep up with me on cases; for God’s sake, John, you were ten feet behind me when we chased Jones last week and it was entirely due to your substandard rest.” And finally, in response to John’s furious query: “Of course I wouldn’t like it if you did the same to me, but it’s entirely different. My mattress is
“Er, yes. I did.” The tips of John’s ear turn a delicate shade of pink, which is delightful. “So. Do I get to open my presents now?”
And this sentence is the final fracture: the fourth shot, and the reason the glass shouldn’t break. “This,” John says, coldly furious, “this is why. You break people, Sherlock, break them into little pieces and then wonder why they don’t function like they used to. And meanwhile you’re above it all. Better than the rest of us puny mortals, it isn’t as though we matter, really. Just an audience for your genius, that’s all I am, and I—”
A pack of cigarettes occupy a permanent place in the right inside pocket of Sherlock’s coat these days. The room might have windows, but the insulation leaves much to be desired and so he wears his coat still; he need only reach a hand in his coat to grasp the carton. The lighter was a gift from a client over a decade ago: vintage, silver plated and, for the first few years, almost exclusively held to the underside of a bent spoon. It makes a satisfying sound as he lights up.
“Oh God, Sherlock, no, it’s—it’s good. Very good. Especially the Santa hat on the skull.” John huffs out a laugh. “You don’t have to worry about that,” he says, and his voice is gentle now. “These presents, though. Um. The shops are closed today, ‘cause of the holiday and all. They wouldn’t have been open last night, either. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that you’d bought these before the case.”
Mycroft stood too still. “221a’s renovations shall be completed by the end of next week,” he said finally, and Sherlock snorted on his way out of the room. “And Sherlock—”
John only tilts his head and reaches for Sherlock’s hand. He turns it over and rests his thumb on his wrist, sweeping over the fragile skin reassuringly before pausing. Feeling Sherlock’s pulse. And then he taps a pattern on Sherlock’s skin: two short taps; short tap, long tap, short, short; long, long, long—Morse code, Sherlock realizes belatedly.
, John is saying, and Sherlock feels his face crumble. Odd how joy can feel so much like grief, he thinks. John looks at him with a question in his eyes. “Did you hear me?” he asks, and Sherlock has to swallow before he manages to say, thickly, “I heard you.”
Something that feels very like hope flares in Sherlock’s chest, and he only half-successfully represses it. He asks, “Why?”
John swallows. Clenches his fast spasmodically. “I loved you,” he states, and it feels like the end of something.
Sherlock has been standing in the doorway, he realizes; if he’s going to be called out on his falsehoods he’d prefer it happen face to face and so he steps into the room, chin raised haughtily. “I suggested he bugger off and eat more sweets,” he says. It isn’t even a lie.
“Known what?” He dislikes the openness of the sentence, the myriad possibilities of it. John should have known a lot of things—that severed digits belong in the crisper and not the top shelf of the fridge, that astronomy doesn’t actually matter, that Sherlock isn’t actually a girl’s name; but then, that’s never stopped him before, Sherlock thinks, disgusted at his own pettiness and thoroughly unwilling to relinquish it.
John tilts his head, querying. They are both exhausted in body and spirit and mind, in every possible way; Sherlock’s body sinks into the leather of his chair like lead falling through water.
John’s shoulders slump. “I can’t lie to you about that because you already know the answer, but—well. Danger is something I like. Adrenalin is, um, something I
John looks at him: looks at the earnestness written on his face, the expression infrequent enough that it feels odd on his face, and huffs out a laugh. “Nice try,” he says, “but you’ll have to do better than that. You forget I lived through a head in the fridge. I can deal with most anything.” After a moment he adds, “And actually I can’t remember the last time you hurt me. I don’t think you ever have, intentionally.”
Leaning against an exposed beam, John meets his eyes and takes a sip. One arm crossed over his chest, gripping his scarred shoulder as he drinks: the low light refracts in the amber liquid as he lowers the glass and lets gravity pull it from his fingertips with casual certainty. Sherlock thinks, irrelevantly, about scars knowing when rain is coming on—a proven link between barometric pressure and increased pain, especially with older injuries—and casts himself back: yes, he distinctly recalls the increased moisture in the air as he’d walked the streets, the scent of ozone; when he lets himself, he can feel the same ache in his own scars. His knee twinges, which is new. He’s getting older.
They sit with their backs against the chimney, concrete and brick leaching the heat from the bodies. This isn’t about comfort, anyway.
He rolled his eyes. “Dull. I intentionally configure a sequence of events so as to induce John to hit me and suddenly you think I’m in danger from him? Honestly, Mycroft. I’m certain that you sympathize with his frustration.”
,” John hisses, having tackled the murderer and handed him off to the Met. He examines the wound with quick, careful fingers. After a moment: “It’s mostly superficial. Keep pressure on it; I’ll patch it up at the flat.”
John looks at him like he understands. “Okay,” he says quietly. Levers himself onto his feet and gestures for Sherlock to do the same. They make their way up to the roof in silence.
“You need to ask?” When Sherlock doesn’t answer, John clenches his fist. “Because, you dick—tonight I saw you put yourself in the path of a knife. For no apparent reason, I might add. And I don’t know what to do about that.”
He should be angry, but he when he reaches for the emotion he can’t find it. Instead, there’s an aching sense of loss; familiar, like pressing on an old bruise that’s half-healed.
There is no response at his side, and after a moment Sherlock turns his head to find John smiling sadly. Regretfully, maybe: wondering at who they have been and what they have done. “Tell me you’d leave me,” John says.
Outside the air is cool and wet. It had rained at some point in the past few hours: Sherlock doesn’t recall when; he thinks that this should be disconcerting before dismissing the thought. London is very nearly still around them, the faintest tinges of light overtaking the rust color of light-polluted clouds.
Sherlock wants to reach out for John’s hand but refrains; instead, he curls both fists into the hem of his coat, digging his nails into the heavy wool. He wants, he wants, he wants. “Stay,” he says, “please,” and they watch the sun rise on another grey day together.
His attempt at aggravation falls short of the mark, but John only smiles. “We needn’t,” he agrees, “but I would, um, like to tell you something.”
The space around them is bare, stripped of its usual comforts of wallpaper and rugs, paintings and books, and Sherlock feels similarly raw. They sit each to each and the silence is thick as bulletproof glass: but no, Sherlock thinks, that’s not right, it’s bulletproof glass with a fracture spidering across the pane, splintering; and he thinks: polycarbonate with a thickness of 3.175 cm can withstand three shots from a .44 Remington Magnum but what would happen with the fourth shot, he wonders, would it make any bit of difference—
“Yes, I do,” John agrees, an amused twist to his lips, and Sherlock curses himself for not thinking of it sooner. John likes cases, John likes Christmas, and therefore Sherlock will do his level best to supply him with all of the holiday-themed crimes in London.
“Oh, fuck off,” John says. Weary: insisted on taking the train, improbably. Why would anyone choose a fourteen hour train over a two hour flight? Sherlock can’t fathom it. The overnight trip aggravated John’s shoulder; he can see it in the way John holds himself. He can also see the exact moment when John decides to let the argument go. “You’re still replacing the kitchen table.”
John very nearly smiles, but it hangs wrong on his face: bitterly. “Right. I’ll just—go, then, shall I.” He shifts his weight on the chair as though to stand.
“The kettle wasn’t intentional,” Sherlock protests. It’s the only thing he can refute, after all, and accuracy is essential.
John does not refute this. Setting his jaw, he only looks at Sherlock as though daring him to speak again, and Sherlock has never turned down a challenge in his life.
"I'm sorry, but I haven't had a clue yet, John. All I know is that I have to keep you safe. We'll wait and see what's going on, and it's not necessarily going to be long till I work it out. I'll protect you, that's what I am meant to do, you know?"
'You... Made me think of one of my friends. Or my friend, for I've only got one friend, and that's him.'
John nodded. He seemed a bit unconfident with his ability to socialise, for he stayed silent most of the times. Sherlock could only wonder what changed him into a loving gentleman in his later life.
But was John really back? When Sherlock began to wake up from the alcohol, he thought about why the boy appeared. It could be a trick. John was an ordinary name, so was Watson. This boy could be someone else. He can't be---
"What a good excuse," John remarked, making Sherlock blush. But John didn't seem to be sarcastic- Sherlock supposed he was still unaware of the difference between reason and excuse. However, Mrs Hudson laughed at this cruelly.
'I'll go in,' he said,'and you... Stay outside and check if anyone noticed us. Be careful, will you?' John nodded slightly, and they both went into the darkness.
But that wasn't what made him excited either. Just now he was thinking about how John would act when he woke up. Would he be frightened in such an unfamiliar place and cry for his mummy? Then he would definitely have no idea what to do. He was excellent at solving problems though, as long as they had nothing to do with children.
The boy finally turned to look at Sherlock. Sherlock was greatly shocked the moment his eyes met the boy's eyes. They were John's eyes. He could never tell their colour. Sometimes they were too dark to be recognised, and sometimes they were light, and now he thought they were pink In the dim light. That was just imagination, he told himself.
'Ah, we've got a client, John. I'm sure she's gonna come in, my boy. Try to observe to find your answer, John. Her strange actions indicates that... ' He stopped here for a moment and was a bit amused to see John's eyes wide with surprise and worshipping. 'That it's a lover's problem.'
John was a bit uneasy in front of him, not knowing what Sherlock was going to do. But he soon calmed down, for he trusted Sherlock, and Sherlock would never hurt him.
“What’s going on, Sherlock?” John walked towards him and sat at his feet. Sherlock suddenly felt the urge to touch the boy’s face, but he fought it back, knowing it would make the boy jump. He sighed again.
'Em... John, I don't think it's the right time to tell you--- ' It was a hard task to stop a child from asking, but that hesitating woman saved him from the embarrassing situation. John jumped up and hid behind Sherlock. 'Hey, it's fine, she's just a client--- ' Sherlock said while walking to the door.
He patted the boy on the shoulders. 'Hey, young fellow,' he said in his drunk voice, 'you don't look well. What had happened to you?'
“Thank you Mrs Hudson, thank you so much!” Sherlock shouted back sarcastically. John frowned at this.
When that lady came in John stopped hiding and got out. Yes, children are really sensitive, they could always know who would possibly hurt them and who would not. As soon as the lady got in John decided she was the 'wouldn't' kind, so he wasn't afraid anymore. She was dressed in a very casual style with simple warm colours, yet her face was so pale that she looked as weak as a piece of glass that could be broken at any time.
He suddenly brightened up and texted a number. Mrs Hudson, Anderson and Lestrade stared curiously at him, but he stood quite far away from them that they couldn't see anything on his phone. He texted
No. He is John. Sherlock was sure, and for the first time he had no proof. He knew it was John. Maybe it was Moriarty's trick, but he didn't care. John was here, nothing mattered anymore.
'You could call me Sherlock, John,' said Sherlock while handing John a plate containing an egg and another which contained much vegetable salad. John smiled when he saw the vegetable salad--- Sherlock was right. His doctor loved vegetable salads. And Sherlock loved the way John smiled. When he smiled, his entire face lit up, and he showed his rare happiness so truly, even when he was abandoned, even when he was staying with a stranger. Sherlock always loved that.
“John?” He placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder and stared, only to be stunned by the last symbol on the wall, an identical symbol to the rest, only in scarlet. It hadn’t dried, and the paint fell down from the symbol, looking like a dreadful warning.
"Oww!" Sherlock jumped to the window and cried in frustration. Indeed, one more... He had to be quick and solve this before that guy did something to his John. He turned to see John behind his back, slightly leaning on the sofa.
'I must find out,' Sherlock whispered, 'A trick. A trick that connected to John's life.' Maybe, just maybe, he'd see John someday. When the boy grew up there's gonna be clues for him to find John. Before that, he could enjoy his time with kid John and do his research. Finding John seemed hopeless, but Sherlock would never give up, for it was John, his John.
Sherlock spent four minutes to solve the security code and got the files he needed, but when he broke into a room with a window he could not see John outside. He should be there at this time. What happened? Fear slowly rose into his mind. John was not there. John was in danger---
'John!' He rushed to the ground, but it was too late. Blood was running like a river, out of his lifeless John.
“No, I don’t think so, John, but I think he’s the man behind all this.” Sherlock stared at John for a while. He could tell from the boy’s look that he didn’t understand a thing, maybe it was all too much for him. He reached down to comb through the boy’s hair soothingly. The boy looked up.
"Yeah," the boy went in, and Sherlock noticed the traces of marmalade around his lips. "I actually found a new one—— a new doodle... I mean, that dash-shaped sign. It looks exactly like the one in my room, but it's on the kitchen wall. Would you like to, um, see it?"
But still there was an embarrassing silence between them. Sherlock tried to sit near John, but John jumped a little when he felt Sherlock's scent so near to him. So Sherlock had to move a bit farther from John. It was embarrassing and disappointing for him, as well as painful. However he made a vow not to show his sadness to this child whatever happened. So he thought he should make the first move.
"... That was a hard question, John," Sherlock coughed, "To consult someone doesn't necessarily mean you are stupid- although most people who come here to consult me are indeed idiots- sometimes you just have to ask people about things that you couldn't be bothered to learn."
'Well, sit,' Sherlock added,'Are you feeling well?' How was he supposed to be well so soon after being abandoned by his family? That wasn't a good question.
The boy frowned for he saw the pain in Sherlock's eyes. 'And then what? I guess you lost him.' He said.
'I love you,' he mumbled. John whispered something in his sleep, Sherlock tried to work out what it was but failed. He gave up, and went into his own room. He grabbed a blanket to cover himself. For the first time after John's death, he fell asleep successfully.
Sherlock turned to see John wrapped in his pyjamas, which looked funny on him because of how large they were. They were Sherlock's, of course, because he didn't have the time to buy him kids' pyjamas. A lady came here yesterday and showed him the watch with "J.W" on it, and John was claimed to be her husband. Obviously someone has already begun to act: there's no need to wait till Sherlock Holmes is ready, because he's always ready for a case, not to mention one related to John Watson. How strange it was that he was overwhelmed by fear! He would admit that he felt some strange but mutual thing with Moriarty every time that psycho commited a crime, but now there was only hatred left.
Sherlock frowned. In order to protect John, he and Mycroft was always careful to keep him away from people's attention, and hardly anyone knew John was still alive. But this lady mentioned him, and she seemed to be familiar with John. He looked at John to see if he knew the lady, but John was never readable to him. He was worried about John, but still he nodded and agreed to go with the lady. 'Play by yourself, John.' He added before entering a private room.
His pale skin, his tiny fingers, dry lips and long, golden eyelashes. If possible, Sherlock would touch his skin, and place kisses all over his body. He'd probably do that to John if he was an adult, and they'd be regarded as gay, but he wouldn't mind. He thought about how he was always the one being admired by John, and dozens of other people. That ordinary blogger was seldom cared about, but Sherlock just found that he was amazing. And he was admiring John. What would he be like when he wakes up? Would he be quiet again? Or would he be strong, strong enough to carry on without his family? Family was so important to John, and Sherlock understood why. It was because he lost one before, so he treasured it.
John walked to him hesitantly. When he finally came into Sherlock's reach, Sherlock grabbed him by the shoulders and looked into his eyes seriously. "John, from now on you must not go out of my sight, do you understand?"
When he began to feel really drowsy, he placed an arm under John's body and lifted him up in a bridal style. He walked slowly to the room John used to sleep in and put the kid on the bed carefully. When he finished he stood by the bed for a while, and bent down to kiss John's forehead.
As soon as they got in the lady closed the door and looked behind the curtains to see if someone was watching. Then she shut them quickly, ignoring the fact that Sherlock snorted.
'You do know what J stand for, don't you?' She asked, breathing heavily. Now it was Sherlock's turn to be astonished. 'I don't know what you're saying, Miss.. Am I supposed to know his name?'
Sherlock frowned, for he saw the fear in Johns eyes, though he said nothing. Surely he wasn't happy at school! Sherlock thought to himself. This child suffered too much before he becomes an adult. He walked towards him and knelt down in front of him. It was the first time he decided to get those words out in front of John.
“You’re not stupid, John.” He locked eyes with the boy sincerely, “You’re an intelligent kid, and that’s why I’m telling you all this. But it takes time and training to understand-- I couldn’t have become a detective without training myself and all my experience, either.”
"As far as I can see, that's far from solving it," said a voice from the stairs. It was Anderson, with Lestrade following him.
'I see,' Sherlock interrupted coldly, 'you are safe, Miss. Go back home and take care of yourself. I'll be in charge of this.' He nodded again, and opened the door. The lady got out, it seemed that she really wanted to look back when she got to the door, but just as her head turned slightly, she trembled violently like a ghost was swallowing her soul. She stormed out and slammed the door.
“What? You saw what?” Sherlock jumped to grab her shoulders. John jumped out her arms, looking scared as Sherlock stared at her with his eyes filled with angst.
'Thank you, sir--- I mean Sherlock.' He said. Sherlock stared at him with much love in his eyes. His John was back, finally. He would ask no more from God. John noticed his gaze very soon. He blushed a little as all children would do, and lowered his head.
'Goodbye, Sherlock,' he said in a pleasant tone, 'You'll never see that little brave, stupid soldier again. Have fun!'
Dear readers, I'm happy to inform you that I deleted everything after chapter five because they were mere shit... I don't think I could do any better now, and I've lost the ability to actually write something since I started taking writing classes. It's nice to see you... if you are still there. I really can't blame you if you gave up on me because this piece of turd took me so long... Anyway, since I'm back (happily), greetings, my dear readers!
One more sign on the wall, identical to the ones they found upstairs. Sherlock checked the corridor, expecting another sign; no sooner did he find one behind the umbrella. Mrs Hudson covered her face, holding John tightly in her arms.
'It's fine. He means nothing to me.' Sherlock tried to use a cold tone, ignoring the fear inside of him.
"This." The little boy pointed at the bottom of his nightstand, confused. There was a "一" sign just beneath the lower drawer. Sherlock frowned.
Sherlock released his hand in silence. "Two hours," he said. Irene nodded, with a wicked smile on her face. Probably trying to impress Sherlock, but Sherlock really wasn't in the mood of finding her attractive. He turned to walk to the gate, leaving one last glance behind. A few steps away, he was suddenly stopped by a horrific voice, one that he recognised to be Jim Moriarty's-
I'm trying to write about cases but that's quite new to me. I can only wish that you would cope with it...
He stared at John for a few moments. He could leave John to no one and be free of worries. The best way would be to take John with him, but he wasn't sure what he would encounter.
'But you don't even know how to raise a child, Sherlock. Just give him to me, I'll deal with this. I promise I'll get the best caring for him.'
Sherlock got out of the room soon after the lady was gone. His eyes searched where John was, and he was sitting on the sofa, looking confused. 'What happened, Sherlock?' At that moment Sherlock knew he had to think up a good excuse.
“That...man, I saw him running into the bushes in the backyard.” She yelled as Sherlock ran into the backyard, “Get back, Sherlock! He must be gone by now!”
'Oh you can't fool us now, Sherlock. We all know very well how much he means to you. That's why we did this. You are not our purpose, he is. And since I could easily kill him... There's no need of you here, Sherlock. Go home now, my dear, your work was done well.' He made a gesture, and the five killers fired at the same time.
'John?' Moriarty smiled, showing his shark-like teeth. Sherlock's heart clenched, because that was usually not a good symbol. 'It seems you really got a hold on him, my dear detective,' he said,'you were too careless, Sherlock. They found you on the day before. Your loyal soldier noticed them and tried to cover for you, but unfortunately he was arrested, and five killers could get him killed easily. Of course, he wouldn't say a word about your work, although that meant death to him, so you don't have to worry, Sherlock.'
But Sherlock didn't answer him. Instead he lowered his head and sighed slightly, while stroking John's soft hair in a slow rhythm. 'Lovers do have problems, John,' he started a moment later, 'They would quarrel and shout at each other.' 'Why would they do that?' 'For a variety of causes. Maybe they can't decide whether to have a baby or not... Maybe they can't bear each other's habits... Or maybe just sexual tension,' 'Sexual what?' John caught the last two words immediately.
'Elementary, miss. Look at your wrists--- the traces there told me you once was a secretary and you didn't get high salaries. But look at your nice expensive watch--- Surely you've got a great chance and had a better job, because all your clothes are expensive except that scarf--- It's old and cheap but not yet out of style which suits your clothes, I can see why you like it--- But only that watch is old and expensive, and it's such a private thing. Well, look at the back of it--- J. Watson---'
'Jim Moriarty,' he replied without thinking, and turned to him in a sudden. 'What have your men done to John?'
“I don’t know, John, and that is rare. I should’ve got a few things clear by now, but today my guesses are wrong.”
John blushed, but didn't look away. Instead he gave Sherlock a careful smile. Suddenly, he seemed to be reminded of something.
He got excited in the kitchen. Of course it was not the food he was cooking that made him excited. In fact nothing was worth being excited for about the food. When John was here( as an adult) Sherlock never had to worry about eating. John was always there to make delicious and healthy food for him, and force him to eat. So he couldn't really handle anything difficult in the kitchen, but according to the book about children's diet Mycroft gave to him, children's meals were easy to cook. He was quite proud of himself: so far he succeeded in frying two eggs as well as making a bid vegetable salad. John liked eating vegetable salads before---or when he grows up.
'I believe he's a good boy, Sherlock. Maybe we can leave him alone in the sitting room for a while and have a private talk? I'm sure he will understand. He's such a brave little soldier.' She smiled at John again.
The lady lowered her head for a while and looked gloomy. 'It's not that,' she said, 'Or maybe it's all related, but I didn't come for that.' Her voice was thin, and she sounded so heartbroken. 'You know---' She suddenly looked up and stared still John. 'So that is the child. John.' Her lips curled into a gentle smile. John hesitated a bit but smiled back shyly.
It was embarrassing for John, for he did not know how close he and Sherlock once were. All he could remember was that Sherlock saved him from his darkness. That already made Sherlock very important to little John.
'I'm tired,' said John, who was counting that woman's paces with great interest, 'What's she doing? Is she gonna come in or not?'
He noticed Sherlock walking towards him, but he didn't raise his head. 'What are you doing here?' Sherlock asked. When he was near enough to the boy he noticed he was biting his lips to fighting back tears. This made him a bit sympathetic because this was exactly how he acted right after John's funeral.
“Okay.” Sherlock smiled and sat back into his armchair. “If my guesses are right, whoever left those doodles here separated his sign into two parts-- one part downstairs and one part upstairs. Then there should be three symbols downstairs too, but there were only two, so my guesses are wrong. I’ll have to come up with new guesses-- or hypothesis, you’ll impress any teacher if you used that word in your writing.”
John walked towards the backyard door, and watched curiously as Sherlock stabbed into the bushes with a funny looking stick. Is that what a detective does? Stabbing the bushes with a funny stick? But Sherlock soon ended his search, groaning and running his fingers through his messy hair.
Sherlock turned back nervously. John was already up. His eyes were a bit red from yesterday's crying, but thank God, Sherlock could tell he hadn't cried this morning. He was fine, although he looked very pale. He needed to eat more, Sherlock thought, he was too thin. Maybe his family treated him badly. Maybe he had been bullied by the children luckier than him. After all he was there with Sherlock, after all his sufferings. For that reason Sherlock admired him, as well as his great courage.
For a moment he thought he saw John's tears, but they never fell down. Instead, John shivered, his arms went straight up to Sherlock's neck, and rested his head against Sherlock's chest. 'I know,' he whispered. And that was enough for Sherlock.
Why am I doing this? I'm horrible at cases and I'm not half as intelligent as Anderson from Scotland Yard!
"Of course!" Sherlock almost jumped and followed John out of the room. The boy looked a bit frightened by his sudden movement, but there was no room for that thought in Sherlock's brain at the moment.
The doodl—— if he could call it like that—— was created using black paint. They already knew that the character "一" means "one" in Chinese, but was it possible that Moriarty would use this trick again when he knew someone was ahead of him? No, it was more likely that this was a trick, and that the doodle meant something else. However, that was not the most important thing to consider right now: obviously someone got into John's room without being notice. Maybe Moriarty knew that his concern for John's safety would slow down the process of solving the case. He didn't care. John had to be——
"Oh, for God's sake, Mrs Hudson, I forgive you." Sherlock put on his coat and looked at John. He stopped at the door.
He looked at the child sleeping on Sherlock's lap. Sherlock's cold, thin fingers brushed his blond hair gently, and he looked sad and and desperate. 'I must, Mycroft,' he said in a low voice, carefully not to wake the boy up,'He's got no one. I can't send him anywhere. He needs to be cared for.'
Sherlock laughed. 'No, they don't, John. When I say lover's problem I mean other things. Lovers aren't all that happy, John. In fact most of the times they end up seperated from each other.' 'And?' John asked, noticing Sherlock was a bit sober. 'What happened, Sherlock?'
The boy thought for a moment, and licked his lips. 'John Watson,' he said, and that was how Sherlock knew everything wasn't over, and for that he cried in front of all the people staring curiously at his unusual act.
Sherlock makes wrong guesses which turn out to be right. (Seems there's no need to read it anymore XD the summary says it all)
Sherlock studied her in an emotionless way. 'You do have a good boyfriend,' he started a bit later after staring at her for a while, 'Why did you break up?'
A woman walked anxiously outside their door. Two steps forward, one step back, and then three steps to the left...
I wrote this chapter listening to The Rolling Stones-- probably the wrong thing to do 'cause the chapter turned out to be a bit different than I had thought...
'Yes, yes you are--- James Watson, the doctor, and my husband.' She seemed to be at the edge of getting crazy.
He froze, for he thought John was back, in this special form. A child that needed help. A child that had no one waiting for Sherlock to save him and guide him. He was shocked by his thoughts. What was he thinking about? He never believed in these things. John was dead. He saw him lying on the ground, covered in blood. He was dead, and no matter how much Sherlock missed him, he could never see him again. Although he knew it wasn't real, he still had some hope.
'Sherlock.' He whispered. He was blushing again. Was he always blushing? Sherlock wondered. It seemed easy to get him blushing. And that was adorable, he added to himself.
I've just decided that this series is going to have part two, and it is in process. I just write for fun anyway.
John nodded. He looked confused for a moment, it seemed to Sherlock that he didn't know whether to stand there still or to sit down by the table. Obviously he was nervous, although he appeared to be calm.
"Good boy." Sherlock stroked the boy's hair gently and turn to the drawer. "Breakfast's on the table. Now go, if you find anything weird just tell me and don't touch, okay?"
“Two sugars.” Mrs Hudson shrugged and went into the kitchen. “You better remember that too, John.” She turned to look at the confused boy, raising one eyebrow.
