I am now writing this in the living room. The feeling of the pen on paper may be my last. I can already feel my senses leaving me. I threw up on the ground next to me. That was the worst three minutes of my life. On the floor lay a fully formed daffodil, when I regained control over myself. I scrambled to find my phone, and texted John.
"Getting sentimental in your old age, brother?" I added jokefully, and he smiled. His eyes shone with unshed tears, and he reached to hug me. "May I at least stay with my brother dearest as he withers to death in a puddle of his own blood and petals?" he whispered. "Of course."
"Brother mine. I heard from your adorable doctor that you are feeling under the weather. Might you care to tell me what is going on?" An all too familiar voice jerked me out of my mind palace quite rudely. My annoying elder brother was standing at my room door, casually leaning on his umbrella as if he had no care in the world. "Mycr-" I could barely finish his name before i erupted into a fit of coughing. This time, it lasted longer than usual, as if it knew that Mycroft was looking at me, and it wanted to show Mycroft the severity of my illness. Mycroft rushed to my side, patting and rubbing my back with smooth movements.
John patted my shoulder, and I swear an electric current passed from him to me. I tried in vain to suppress the shiver, and thank goodness John did not notice it. After John left, I let loose all of the coughs I had been holding back in front of John. Wave after wave of pain washed over me, and when the tide finally subsided I had a hand full of yellow daffodil petals, some even speckled with blood stained phlegm.
Hanahaki Disease. Sherlock had it. He loved me, but I was too thick to understand. "Oh, Sherlock, I understand now. Sherlock, I love you!"
"Sherlock, I'm so happy you're alright... Never do that again." John croaked. He looked up at me, and I saw his face, with tears running down his cheeks and mucus tainting the salty fluid. He looked utterly broken, worse than the photos of shell-shocked men in war. "Its... alright... John, I swear, I will never leave you again." I managed to say, and as the words left my mouth, a strange feeling blossomed in me. I do not know what it is, and even all my analytical prowess fail to come up with a word in the English language to describe how I feel.
"It was... about ten years ago. I started to throw up petals, much like you. DIfferent from you, I did not know who I was in love with. At that time, you were about thirty, peak of your life, so you wouldn't have noticed me. Every day, I asked around the international board for any piece of evidence, anything at all, which would help me to get better. After tons of digging, and at the verge of my death, news came to me of a cure. I could have an operation to have the flowers removed from my lungs, where they are growing. I was told that doing this operation had the risk of not being able to love ever again, but I took it. I recovered, but have been unable to feel love ever since. The only person I have what goldfishes consider love for is you, Sherlock. Your loss would really, really break my heart."
Love, however, is exempt to this rule. Love breaks all the known laws of science and deduction. and I fail to comprehend it. Mysteries of the heart are the only ones not for Sherlock Holmes. It seems, however, I seem to have gotten myself entangled in the mysteries of love, and life, mine, hangs in the balance. Many books that I have found on the subject give very little on how the Hanahaki Disease. I have taken great pains to hide the books from John, lest he realise something is amiss with me. Many books start the probable cure by finding out who the afflicted is attracted to.
Could it possibly be Irene Adler? She was the only one who beat me, was she not? No, she can't be. I have no attraction to women, and the thought of lying with one does nothing to make me excited. Perhaps, I am gay? It is possible that I am, but then if so, who am I gay for? I can scarcely think of any men i would even want to talk to. much less be attracted to. That detective from the Yard, Giles, Gilbert, Granham...? That is definitely not possible. I do not even know his name! I cannot understand how I would be attracted to a goldfish. The only two people whom I know who are not goldfish are Mycroft and Eurus, but once you eliminate Eurus (I'm gay), I am only left with Mycroft. Mycroft? That pig! No way in hell!
Mycroft pulled open the door and we saw the tragedy inside. Sherlock was lying in a puddle of his own blood, with many fully formed daffodils near him. One of them was growing out from his mouth. Mycroft gasped and ran to his side, kneeling down next to him. His expensive trouser pants got dirty with the blood, but he didn't mind. He started wailing, one of the most horrendous sounds I have ever heard. "Come on, you buffoon! Say you love him!" I was stunned speechless for a moment, but then it hit me.
I have been reading articles on the internet on how I should profess my love for John. My coughing has gotten worse, and I have been coughing up a mouthful of blood alongside the petals, which increase in number. The cheery yellow of the flower petals, coated with a slimy red, makes me want to throw them away, but I have been keeping them all in a jar under my bed. Perhaps if I die, they can be used for medical research to find more cures for Hanahaki Disease. Holding my hand up to my mouth, and coughing another bundle of petals up, I stagger outside. John is sitting on the chair with his laptop on his lap, writing in his blog. Seeing him write makes something in my heart flutter, and I have the sudden instinct to cover John. Just as I was about to dispose of my waste, John turned around and saw me with a handful of petals and blood. "Bloody hell, Sherlock! Are you on anything?" John jumped out of his chair and came to my side immediately. I clenched my fist, not allowing John to see the petals in my hands. Blood dripped from the gaps between my fingers as I threw them into the sink next to me.
An odd look crossed the doctor's face though, like a shadow of a painful remembrance. He paused for a moment, looking across at the ruin, almost as if seeing it with new eyes.
Single bottle chosen, Sherlock turned back to him with a flourish, a broad, proud smile on his face. “Massage. Let’s see if we can really get you in the mood.”
That was all that Sherlock needed and by the time their drinks and then the first dishes were being served he was fully into his stride in regards to the history of the restaurant, the family who owned it, where they had come from in France and the significance of some of the dishes.
He wondered for a moment what the doctor would do when three o'clock ticked round and there was no sign of him. Would he grow angry: at himself, at Sherlock? Would he climb a ridge to stand like a sentinel at watch? Would he try to deduce where he had gone?
“Three break points for Holmes in that game, but it is the Englishman who manages to cling in there.”
John was under no illusion as to who the favourite was going into the match, and for once that left him relaxed and almost fearless. At least this way he was not going to have to endure Sherlock’s disappointment or dissection of his inadequate game play as he had during Cincinnati. Now
Burying his head deeper into the pillow, he closed his eyes and breathed in deeply. Sleep found him surprisingly easily.
Yes, the heavy beat would certainly lend itself quite well to dancing, even to the most inept novice, of which the doctor did not appear to be.
Not since Harry, Sherlock finished silently. This Adair had clearly known Harry then, known what their relationship had been, and had not been bothered by it.
Sherlock expression changed to one of deep consideration. “Beauty is a construct based on childhood impressions, influences, and role models, and is therefore subjective. Based on your past choices, however, Maria Sharapova more than fulfils your concept of beauty, but I believe she has just been defeated by Caroline Wozniacki, so is unlikely to be still in town for your birthday.”
John dropped his free arm over his face. "Give me a mo," he mumbled still hyper aware of just how close he was to climax, and how much of Sherlock he could feel.
“Yeah, fine,” John said. “Just let’s make it an early one. Matches tomorrow and all that, and I know what you two are like when you get going. And no alcohol for us.”
“But in better news, John Watson went through convincingly on Saturday, maintaining the form that won him Wimbledon just two months ago. Could he become the first player ever to follow-up their first Grand Slam win with a second? Well, there’s still a long way to go and he’d be facing some very tough opposition along the way. Catch him in action from eleven a.m. local time, four p.m. in England when he’ll be taking on the Chinese wonder kid, Zhi Zhu, in what could be a fascinating clash of two very different styles. That’s the opening match on Louis Armstrong Stadium, to be followed by the women’s singles fourth round game between Kaia Kanepi and Yanina Wickmayer.
He nodded, rising to his feet. Match bag, racket bag, shoe laces done up – tripping over them and falling flat on his face was something to be avoided. Other bags securely stowed away – no postcards to be slipped into them at least. Mobile relinquished to the safety of the locker. He took a deep breath and joined the steward by the door.
"Would you be as kind as to enlighten me as to how you are aware of such things?" I asked him with some curiosity.
By now the sun was climbing steadily higher in the pale blue and grey sky, and he paused for a drink. The coffee added warmth to his chest and a caffeine kick to his system. As physically fit as he kept himself with his boxing and Bartitsu, he was finding this tougher going than he had expected, and he still had many miles to go in order to put sufficient distance between himself and the doctor, even if he failed to find civilisation before complete darkness.
It transpired that the doctor had liberated more than just clothing from his uni room. A selection of his course books had been brought also, complete with some of his notes and journals. Non course books were also among the assortment, including the two books on forensic science he had just taken from the library.
He sank his fingers into his palm, the brief spark of pain a pleasant side effect of his newly awoken senses. He had forgotten the rush that came from feeding from a living subject. Or not exactly forgotten, he had
At that the barrage of words finally ceased and John took a moment to process everything he had heard. Keys. Houses. Baker Street. Home.
In 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert published 23 problems which were all unsolved at the time. They ranged greatly in topic and precision. Some – like the 3rd problem – are propounded precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer. Others require interpretation or are not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to apply. Still others concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like theories of quadratric forms.
There was nowhere for him to put his wet things though, so it was with some reluctance that he slowly made his way back down the stairs, towards the main heat source.
"Hardly the more expected hunting rifle considering the surroundings, and certainly more than one would expect for a simple GP," Sherlock pointed out.
Content, John allowed himself to be pulled from the bed and bustled into the bathroom. It wasn’t a lazy cuddle in bed or a morning blow job, but somehow that made it all the better.
Harry had been barely conscious when he found him, skin already unhealthily cool to the touch. But his words had haunted him ever since.
The remaining words were lost to frantic movement and heated kisses. His knees hit the bed before he even processed they were moving, and then the dressing gown was on the floor and they were on the bed and there was skin and heat and sensation and sound and someone asking for something, someone asking for more, and it could have been him, or it could have been anyone, and the touch of his groin against a thigh was enough to have him rearing up, arching his back, thrusting forward, searching for more.
"Just the usual. Keep in touch. Look after myself. Eat more. Which reminds me, what do you say to an early dinner since we sort of missed lunch?"
Today he was about to play the World Number Three in the quarter finals of the US Open. The same World Number Three who shared his bed, his hotel suite, and his life. The same World Number Three who was frowning at him in all his tousled perplexed gorgeousness.
So altered was he from his usual state that I was momentarily lost for words, but before I could exclaim to ask him of the matter, he turned to fix me with a look of such anguish that I can cease to do it justice on the page. Indeed, it is a look I have not seen on his face since, and for the life of me, never wish to see again.
Unless, what? Sherlock considered. Unless he would prefer something different? He shook his head. Unless he would like something else, something to eat perhaps? Possibly, he thought glancing at the clock, but he couldn't have eaten that long ago and dinner wouldn't be for another hour or two.
“… forehand Watson, Holmes forehand slice, Watson runs forward, but there’s no way he was going to get that one.”
"That's Harry's violin," the doctor said slowly. "It's also an heirloom. No offence, but it's not like the book. Why would I just give it to you?"
helping. The pain in his head was starting to ease and the glass gave him something to grip onto, but that still left him with questions. The most pressing of which was-
"I watched for some time the comings and goings of particular members, noting similarities that they shared which would be unusual in the general population. My interest, however, was less with the club in general and more with a specific individual, a fact, I believe that helped save my life."
"'Since you are the only one currently aware or interested,' the second gentleman said slowly, 'what is to stop us from ending your existence rather than this individual’s?'
“True,” John said with a small smile.  “But why would you think I might be angry that you’ve done this?” he asked.
“Yeah, about that,” John said. “You do know that Google and I are on quite good terms at the moment. Was quite enlightening really. Now, what was the score that I found out? 6-3, 6-1? Not quite what you told me, was it?”
"My dear Watson, as much as I would wish to take this experience further, I fear Mrs Hudson will be looking to serve us supper within the half hour."
There was a long look, the hysteria having given away to weariness, and then a slow nod. "Alright," the doctor said softly. "Alright. Goodnight, Sherlock."
They mixed with other images; of a dog that wasn't a dog, a house that no longer was, and a young girl who didn't exist.
Perhaps the question of why was unnecessary considering the command had been followed by a reason, but also because lying listlessly with his head hanging off the sofa was perhaps reason enough for the doctor to suggest a change of activity.
His climax rolled over him like a crashing wave of pain and pleasure. It burned through him with ecstasy and devastation. For a moment he was more alive than he had ever been.
Picking the new ones out of the box, he sorted them by genre as best he could. The likes of Queen and the Bee Gees went into one pile, classical music into another, the
There was only one place where it might be, though, and the doctor was unlikely to allow him to simply waltz over and have a good rummage. He would need a plan.
"Okay," the doctor said after a moment. "Well sunset will be around four. We normally get a couple of hours of twilight, but with the rain coming in this evening I'd say there's a good chance it'll be pretty dark by five, five thirty. So, how about, if you're not back here by three then I'll come and find you and make sure you're okay."
John pulled out a new racket and got to his feet. His shoulder was still twinging, reminding him that not everything was perfect, but it was nothing that he couldn’t play through. That was all part and parcel of the sport. If it doesn’t hurt you’re not doing it properly. And he was going to do this properly. Oh yes he was, and he was going to win, just as Sherlock had said he would.
“His royal pain in the arse is back at the hotel,” Greg said as a way of explanation as he took some of the bags. “He gave me a list of tasks to do, the last of which was to bugger off, so here I am. Figured I might as well do something useful with my time.”
Nothing more was said regarding the agreement and yet it seemed to fizz under everything they did. Or at least that was how it felt to Sherlock. It was... distracting.
Sherlock shifted meaningfully, and John found a strong arm suddenly looping across his chest, pushing him down onto his back into a familiar sleeping position.
Lieder is the first piece of music mentioned in the Holmes canon and the only named piece that Sherlock plays. In A Study in Scarlet, Watson remarks that Holmes had proved his ability on the violin by playing him some of Lieder and other favourites at Watson's request.
Hi everyone. Wow, you've all been so lovely and generous. I had no idea how this story would be received after so long, but I've been feeling so loved! So big thank you!
There was no sign of human life, and it occurred to Sherlock that perhaps the doctor would have known this. He could well have been aware of how far someone would have to travel before finding civilisation.
“Ah no,” John said quickly. “No, no.”  But was cut off as Sherlock surged forward, catching him in a deep kiss that became leisurely but thorough, breaking away only to rest their foreheads together as they shared the same air.
“There’s a reservation booked for nine at a quiet out-of-the-way place if you want it. Sherlock’s got the details and you’ve got plenty of time. Otherwise you can fend for yourself.”
What were his own weaknesses that Sherlock would try to exploit? His age and fitness probably, so short rallies would be the best for him, no chasing needlessly after hopeless balls. His shoulder, that was a weakness. He would have to try and pace himself throughout the match. No point throwing his arm out in the first set. His height? Would Sherlock try throwing in a few lobs knowing that John had neither the reach nor the arm motion of the majority of players?
"You knew my habits well enough to drug me and my timetable enough to pick the most opportune time."
Would he simply sit and stare into the fire, drowning in the memories of his former lost love and the thoughts of what might have been?
There was another long pause, the doctor's chest rising and falling as he sucked in deep breathes between the hysteria that had gripped him.
Joining to doctor at the table, he took the offered plate and started to eat. The food, cottage pie with veg, was warm and filling, and although they shared conversation, the doctor didn't mention the time he had lost while he had been organising his thoughts.
“Yes,” John said. “Which I believe was the aim. At least for you. It was a good match, and until that last set, was quite a close one as well.”
The doctor's smile was small but wonderful. "Is that right?" he said. "Although, the two player version isn't as challenging as the four player," he added. "I wouldn't want you to get bored."
The rest ended back in Scottish Gaelic and then the stranger was off, firm slap to the shoulder for Sherlock, clasped arm shake for the doctor, before a near bellowed greeting to the bar lady, and then off back into the cooling afternoon.
“Tell your delightful agent that I already know everything, and not to think she’ll get anything past my
The television. The tennis. The tournament. Then Sherlock had asked him for something. His notebook.
The place felt colder and emptier without him though. Everything in its place. Well, that was hardly surprising.
“That’s incredibly thoughtful of you,” John said.  “Very thoughtful. You’re not doing is out of some sort of misplaced sense of guilt though, are you?”
My other headcanon is that they then waited to have a second child only for the second one not to happen once they did start trying. Months turned into years while they kept trying and hoping, until finally Sherlock came alone, and then surprise when Eurus came along a year later, after all, why bother with birth control when you want another child and it took you five years to conceive the last one. I also like to think it was due to the premenopausal hormonal surge that women can have.
He would never grow tired of seeing Sherlock’s small smile every time he referenced the distant future, the future they were going to have together.
Bigger than he had expected, it was far more than just a fortress; it had been a castle, a stronghold, a home. Here the courtyard with the imposing towering walls. There the arch through which all would come. At the centre, the keep with imposing towers. Beside it the steps that would lead you home.
The kitchen was clearly period, in keeping with the general feel of the property. There were no modern convenience devices. No microwave, no toaster, no electric kettle, the fridge and freezer were clean but clearly dated, the sink and oven likewise.
The rain hit his face the same moment the realisation that the door actually was unlocked struck him. He honestly hadn't been expecting that, his body working more on instinct than cognitive reasoning. He had gone for the door because he had needed to try. He just never thought he would make it.
"What gave it away?" the doctor simply asked, as if he was actually curious as to the answer and not at all concerned by the deduction.
“If you don’t fucking well fuck me right this fucking minute," John growled, twisted his head to shoot his lover his darkest look, "I swear I will-” He groaned as the fingers pressed firmly back into his body.
The creaking sound of movement below wrenched his attention back to his surroundings. He wasn't alone. Obviously. There was little chance he had managed to get himself into bed.
Hurrying back, he opened his locker and fished out his mobile. Sherlock, of course. No one else would dare text him this close to a game.
“Hmm, tempting,” he said back, biting gently at the soft skin before pulling away. “But come to think about it, I’m kind of knackered. Challenging match and all that.”
"Since it's your birthday," the bastard was saying, "you get to choose what we do. We can switch and you can penetrate me or-"
The warm, oil covered hands on his shoulders wasn't overly surprising but very welcome, successful in diverting his attention away from other parts of his body. Sherlock offered the odd encouragement as he gradually worked his way down his back and then the hands were kneeling his buttocks before encouraging him to pull his knees up under him. He sort of knew what was coming, but it didn't fully prepare him for the feel of Sherlock's tongue right there against him.
On 23rd August, 1973, four people were taken hostage during a robbery at Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, central Stockholm. The robbery and hostage crisis is best known as the origin of the term Stockholm syndrome - a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity
The air was warm, almost unbearably so. Maybe he should have switched off the space heater. Maybe he should have opened the window slightly; got some fresh air into the room regardless of the temperature outside. Maybe he should have-
"There's no bow," he said, not bothering with a greeting or even with looking up from where he was on the floor. Even to his own ears his voice sounded a touch hollow.
Smiling, John returned to his seat, flopped down and grabbed his drink. One set in the bag, two more to go.
"He got worse," Sherlock said. "He was always chubby, always eating, but then he piled on the pounds, especially after uni. Mummy blamed Uncle Rudy."
Blood flow, yes. There was definitely and noticeably increased blood flow to a certain part of his anatomy.
Then a finger joined the tongue and somehow it all got better still. The first touch to his prostate had him bucking forward, almost losing his balance. Stimulated blood flow to his prostate indeed. The foot massage must have really done the job. He had never seemed so sensitive before. It was god damn marvellous.
"No," the doctor said. "No, not yet." His smile was almost apologetic. "Not as young as I used to be. Once will be all I'm really good for. But at your age, I'd consider myself a failure if I couldn't get you to climax two or three times before we're done."
By biological rights, he had not felt so alive in years, and yet it came with such a heavy price. The blood link meant he could feel Sherlock moving farther and farther away from him, the action only heightening the siren call; life, blood, love.
Sherlock jerked slightly, unable to completely suppress his surprise. He had braced himself for all manner of statements. That had not been one of them.  "Why- what- why would you say that?"
Climbing in the passenger seat, Sherlock couldn't help but feel a sense of dread as he buckled his seat belt. For a brief moment he wanted to flee, to jump down and run off into the growing gloom. A prehistoric part of his mind was screaming for him to escape, that he was nothing more than prey trapped in a maze, being toyed with by a much more advanced predator.
"I-" hadn't really got that far, Sherlock thought. He honestly hadn't considered that he would be allowed to leave the cottage on one hand, or to do so alone on the other.
"Oh aye," the stranger said the whole exchange moved from odd to downright uncomfortable. "Chì mi.  Chì mi," he said before breaking into a broad toothy grin. "But by devil's teeth, Hamish. He still naught but a wee bairn."
You don't keep a ring and call yourself a widower if your partner just left you. Sentiment. You do move to a new area, though, start a new life, remove pictures from the wall if you find the memories associated with them too painful to contend with.
He bolted upright, eyes wide but unseeing, chest tight as he sucking in deep lungfuls of cool air. His heart thudded; in his chest, in his throat, in his ears, deafening in its loudness.
"Sex," Sherlock confirmed. "That's what all of this is about, is it not? Ultimately that's why you kidnapped me. You want to have sex with me. Well if that's the case, I want something in return."
Reflexology was certainly a new interest, John conceded. He’d had his feet done as part of an overall massage plenty of times in the past, but definitely not in the way Sherlock was now doing it. It was good to know that reflexology could help restore the body’s natural balance and promote the healing process, hearing Sherlock talk about how it could also boost your sex life as well was something else entirely. Especially as those strong, long fingers were now doing things that John really hadn’t thought were possible.
"If... you'd... let me," he heard, and then the pressure was gone, and the heat, and the skin, and he blindly sought for it, wanting it back.
The doctor paused long enough to give him a pointed look, then went back to packing a rucksack with what looked like lunch. Six minutes later the doctor was locking the cottage and unlocking the jeep. This at least was a surprise, as Sherlock had expected them to be walking straight from the doorstep.
"And," a slanted smile, and a flickered gaze towards Sherlock's lap, "it seems you'd like that too."
Now there was the question of the space heater; off or on. On would keep the room warm, but at the risk of it getting too warm considering what they were planning on doing. Switching it off though ran the risk of having to halt part way through to warm up.
The sofa wasn't bad, more comfortable than the chair, warmer than the bed. The blanket draped over him was warm and soft with a smell that was almost familiar. It was nice.
“Underestimated, no,” Sherlock said slowly. “Overestimated my ability to compartmentalise in regards to… sentiment, perhaps. Fortunately, I had my gorgeous, generous boyfriend there on hand to remind me.”
John is listening to “Vera Lynn Remembers: The Songs That Won World War 2”. The lyrics mentioned come from the medley of "When the Lights Go On Again All Over the World," "I'll Pray for You," and, her best known song, "We'll Meet Again."
The doctor's expression softened from amusement to something else completely, something almost predatory.
Sherlock straightened his shoulders. This was not how he had been planning to broach the subject, but he had started now. This was where he was now going from and he would only settle on one outcome.
“Good idea,” John agreed as he reached for the fruit salad, “but I thought I told you that you didn’t have to go to too much effort.”
He studied the doctor's body language. There were several tell-tell signs that a person was lying, but the doctor was not showing any of them; confusion, guilt, hope, sadness and a hint of desperation, but not deception. He honestly appeared to believe what he was saying.
He was being left alone. There was only one way out of the room - the window was obviously too small to get through - but he was being left alone.
“You’re not the only person who knows the location of the properties, and we both know Greg likes me more than you.”
Leaning his head against the side window, he ignored the doctor's curious glance for staring at the headlight lit road.
Most significantly for this story, the soundtrack included several songs by Queen, including "Who Wants To Live Forever", which was written by Brian May for the film. It is hauntingly beautiful.
"Daddy's brother. Works for the government. Civil service, MI5, not exactly sure what. Official Secrets Act and all of that. He got Mycroft a position. Mycroft got fat. Or at least even fatter than he had been."
Ah, yeah Culloden. History wasn't his strong point, Scottish history even less so than English, but Culloden was one of those names that stood large in the general cultural collective consciousness, along with the likes of Hastings, Agincourt and Trafalgar.
Springing to my feet, I paced to the window. Despite the many times of having such a conversation, I found it to never get any easier.
He frowned because he was confused by the connections, but was certain he was right. "Doctor Watson?" he asked.
While the going was not the best, the scenery was stunning. A layer of white already painted the tops of the tallest nearby hills, while the valley clung onto the last colours of autumn; leaves of dark red and ochre, long grass of yellow and brown, heather of dark green and orange.
He automatically reached for his forearm, pressing his thumb against the puncture mark. Had it really been that simple?
He jerked, cursing, when Sherlock’s thumb found a particular spot on the sole of his foot that shot a sharp sensation up his leg.
“The inside and outside of the ankles are one of those surprisingly sensitive spots,” Sherlock was saying, his voice low and soothing as his fingers stroked their way across the first of John’s feet. “The multiple nerve endings correspond directly to some of the most important erogenous zones in the body. A steady application of pressure can stimulate the blood flow not only to the feet but also to the penis, testicles and prostate.”
The twenty-two thousand seater stands seemed to stretch up towards the sky, dwarfing everything on the blue and white court below. If there was ever a time when John felt tiny it was when faced with the enormity of knowing that so many people were going to be looking down on him, watching his every move.
It was what he was he had concluded he was willing to endure to acquire such a beautiful instrument.
Their chests heaved as they both sucked in deep breaths, although for different reasons. A faint sheen covered Sherlock’s face as he wiped at his mouth and John didn’t need to look down to know that he was similarly covered. He felt hot, and desperate, and so much alive. His hand automatically reached for his cock, only to be caught by Sherlock who laced their fingers together.
It wasn't the warmest weather wise, but the tea was hot and the view was stunning. They spoke little and stayed until the chill caught up with them.
“What? Really?” Clara’s tone somehow managed to encapsulate surprise, delight and a whole heap of fascination.
Five possible outcomes; the doctor lets him go with or without sex; the doctor doesn't let him go, with or without sex; he escapes, negating the issues of sex and whether or not the doctor would let him go
Dubhloch? Black water? Dark water? Named in relation to the loch, obviously, but had it been important? A stronghold? A clan base? Who had lived there? Why was it so forgotten?
The words hit Sherlock like a lightning bolt, a weird fluttering sensation forming in his stomach as an equally weird sensation ran up his spine to the base of his head. He stumbled, even as he registered the doctor's hand tightening slightly in his, the other arm offering support.
“Well then, I guess we just have to make sure he doesn’t win. I’m not going to let him play with our heads. I’m not going to let him worm his way in. But you have to talk to me. Swear that you will, whatever he says to you, whatever he tries, you’ll talk to me. You won’t just bottle it up in that big brain of yours.”
Because they had taken Sherlock – Harry – to get to him. They had held him, and hurt him, because of John. Because of
Grabbing the doctor's coat, he barely considered what he was doing before he pressed their lips together. He felt the doctor's surprise, but then it was over and he stumbled back, eyes wide as he tried to process what he had done.
“A mixed weekend for British tennis fans. Andy Murray is out, beaten in the third round yesterday by the twenty-fifth seed, Stanislas Wawrinka over four sets. It looks like Murray still hasn’t fully recovered from that ankle injury he picked up at Wimbledon.
Startled, he quickly looked away, trying to stop his cheeks from colouring on realising he had been caught staring.
I was originally going with the Beatles' "The Long and Winding Road", but then "Unchained Melody" was just so perfect that I switched them, especially since everything about "Unchained Melody" just screamed this Sherlock and John.
Oh. It had been years since he'd had one of those. Daddy had been fond of them. Or at least, fond of making them for Mummy when she was in one of her more manic moods and her mind was stuck in a high gear. Half the time she didn't even notice she was drinking it in her distracted state.
Opening the door, he noted the closed door opposite before stepped out onto the staircase and making his way down at a steady pace he hoped would seem neither hesitant nor fearful.
Already? He gave a nod and grabbed his drink for one last swig. Time to go back out there and give it all he had. This time it was his turn to serve.
The doctor was still staring at him. "Just to get this right," he said with a slight shake to the head. "You're saying that if I agree to let you keep that, the violin, then you'll have sex with me."
Breakfast had been cleared away and Mrs. Hudson had removed herself from the property to visit the market, as was her custom on such days. Holmes had finished with the day's newspapers and had retired to his customary chair to pick up his current book. I supposed there would be no better time to broach the subject and that I should do so quickly before I lost my nerve.
“Our homes,” Sherlock corrected. “I’m also instructing my solicitor to draw up the paperwork to add your name to the deed of Baker Street. Unfortunately, that has not been completed yet, but should be shortly.
“You, of course, told them that it’s all positively heart breaking, that I’m the last person you want to face on a court, that it’s going to be difficult because obviously I know every weakness in your game, that you’re going to have at least one sleepless night worrying how the outcome could damage our rather spectacular and successful doubles partnership, and how you wish this had never happened, but since it has, you’re going to suck it up and try not to get distracted on the court by my rather fabulous forehand.”
“Smart, I suppose,” John said as he was ushered towards the bedroom. “Since it’s a special occasion.”
Another languid kiss and John broke away with a slight pant. “Please?” he asked motioning to where his cock lay hot and heavy.
"So let go of that guilt, John Watson. Let go of the grief and the pain and the fear. If you need me to forgive you, then I will, I do. I forgive you for not being able to save me in my last life, and I forgive you for not giving me the choice in this life. But close your eyes and rest now, my love,
Repositioning his rucksack, he continued with his trudging, first along the shallowest part of the river - well
A brief lingering tap on the doorframe and then the doctor was gone, his footsteps uncharacteristically heavy on the stairs.
A challenge then. Deduce what Sherlock had said during his press conference. Well he was never one to back away from a challenge.
The only thing between them now was the thin fabric of his boxers, which did little to hide his arousal. The doctor made no attempt to hide his interest, gaze lowering to that very place, his tongue wetting his lips once and then again. There was something shockingly heady about being looked at in such a way, with such
“Git,” John muttered, but after a small shake of the head started the walk down the corridor, leading Sherlock out into the bright sunshine.
They had been having sex. The doctor had penetrated him. It had felt surprising good and he had been just reaching climax when-
Stretching, the doctor brought one arm up behind his head in a move so reminiscent of the drawings he had found that Sherlock felt the breath caught in his throat.
"Yes." The response was more automatic than anything and it was a beat or two before he realised how he had answered.
He turned the ball over in his fingers, bounced it twice and then opened the match with an ace down the line.
And there was the second surprise. He had just presumed that even if he was allowed out, the doctor would be following very closely on his heels. After all, there was no guarantee that he would come back.
“Sherlock,” he said trying to keep his voice firm and steady. There was no need to jump to conclusions after all. “What’s this?”
Turning, shifting, stretching, he used the last moments of semi-consciousness to conclude that yes, he was in bed, but this was not his bed.
"It wasn't your fault, John." The arms tightened further around him. "The person behind it, the person who ordered it, did you find them?"
Not wanting to make it obvious as to where he had gone, he carefully jumped from the bridge into the shallowest part of the river. The water splashed up his trouser legs, but at least there would be no broken bracken to give away his new direction.
He’d had many different birthdays over the years. Many of the best ones had started with company in bed, usually of the female variety, who had then taken it upon themselves to kick his birthday off with a bang. Or at least with a blow job.
Illegal drugs, it turned out, were surprisingly easy to get hold of among the nouveau riche and the lower landed gentry of his elite university. Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, whatever he wanted, however he wanted it, and he wanted it, oh God he wanted it. Anything to break up the tedium; to release his mind; to take away the encompassing emptiness life inflicted upon him.
"Oh, and in case it helps, I could have done anything to you while you were unconscious, but I didn't because that's not who I am. I'm a lot of things, some of them a bit not good, but I'm not
The doctor's expression lit up with a mixture of surprise and hope. What would have happened if he had said no?
"All that dust though, you're probably parched. I'll put the kettle on before you go back up. Unless-"
"Yes, I am aware of your excursions, as I am aware that you are a member of the same club I had previously investigated. While you might have been aware of any attempt by myself to follow you, my homeless network were far less conspicuous.
Gasping, he wretched himself away, breathing deeply even as Sherlock pressed a finger to the already healing cut. Even that small amount of blood was enough to make his cock twitch, part blood lust, part Pavlovian response built up over the centuries. Oh god he wanted him; wanted this young, passionate lover; wanted the blood and body of the latest reincarnation of the only soul he would ever truly love.
“For the match,” John clarified, his lips tilting up into a smile. “I don’t plan on sharing you with the rest of the tour afterwards.”
might work. The Beatles, possibly. The Beach Boys? Elvis? Something newer into the collection. Something Harry may not have known? Something newer that the doctor had only just brought with him?
Twisting his fingers into Sherlock’s shirt, he had tugged him forward into a brief kiss – because he could, because Sherlock was right there, and because he wanted to.
John laughed. He couldn't help it. The words - oh god the words - it had been so long, so much. He could feel his legs beginning to buckle as the relief washed over him. It had worked. The plan had worked. Sherlock was Sherlock. The right Sherlock. His Sherlock.
“Another serve down the centre from Holmes. Stretched return Watson. Holmes forehand, Watson, it clips the net, wrong footing Holmes who returns, but it’s an easy put away for Watson at the net.”
It was a journey they had covered before, albeit last time at dusk and in the opposite direction. Even so, he noted the turn off that would have taken them to the castle ruin and the loch.
Sherlock waited. He had agreed, he had signed, the doctor was going to get what he had set out to get.
“Holmes holds. He isn’t out of this set yet, but Watson now has the opportunity to serve out the set.”
Sherlock turned it over in his fingers and then disappeared into their bedroom. When he reappeared the postcard was nowhere to be seen.
He expected a reaction to his choice - a scoff, a jesting comment, at least a raised eyebrow - that was what everyone else did, but the doctor merely nodded and headed to the bar. Truth was, he wasn't much of a drinker, another thing that made him an outsider at university. He had never enjoyed the deadening affect heavy imbibing had on his brain, nor the tribal ridicule from those who had deemed him a 'light weight'. He also had no intention of losing his inhibitions in current company, or of putting himself into a potentially compromising situation.
Throwing the covers completely off, he was relieved to realise he was still fully dressed, albeit missing his socks and boots. The air was surprisingly cool on his newly bared skin as he swung his legs over the side of the bed. His plan was to be up on his feet when the unknown person appeared, but a sudden bout of dizziness and faint nausea had him clenching tightly to the mattress edge even as a tap came on the door.
“Hmm. Thanks,” he said, then pulled away from the kiss as the words filtered past the cloud of arousal dominating his mind. “Wait. What?”
“Please know that this isn’t something I’m purposefully keeping from you,” Sherlock said. “I would tell you, but it’s not only my story to tell.”
There was a pause as Sherlock’s gaze searched for something in John’s expression. He must have found for a moment later he nodded.
‘Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Please rest assured that the matter to which you did consult us has been resolved. We now consider the matter closed and all debts between us discharged. Yours’.
The doctor offered nothing more, just continued to sit calmly at the table, newspaper spread, mug in hand, just watching him.
"I confess that until now I had thought myself a man above all such failings concerning the flesh. Untroubled as I have been by distraction from the fairer sex, I had concluded, however erroneously, that I had escaped that weakness which plagues more common men. Rather, I now find myself firmly within the category of those considered most abominable and irredeemable. Worse still, I find myself wishing that you too share the same moral failing. Thus I am twice cursed; once for being of a perverted nature; and twice for wishing a good man, the best of men, might be of the same damned inclination."
As they walked, Sherlock could almost see the land changing as the doctor spoke, pointing out the original course of a particular river, the odd rocks that spoke of walls or paths, the odd pattern in the heather and grass that spoke of previous cultivation.
“Four serves from Holmes. Four points. Watson’s going to start wondering why his service game seems to come round far too fast.”
There were other sensations to consider as well, touch in particular, the body pressed up against his, the press of lips to his hair, the stroke of hands over his back and arms. Soothing. Comforting. Loving.
Tea made, he pressed the doctor again on the issue of time. What was the schedule? When was the contract going to be ready to sign? What was the deadline for the final decision?
He stared at it, his thoughts awhirl until they settled on the one overriding fact that had started his mental maelstrom.
He returned to watching the sights of New York and tapping his fingers against his thigh. The traffic seemed heavier than usual. Maybe it was simply the time of day. Or maybe it was the day itself. It was a Monday, wasn’t it? Day eight of the Open. The first day of the men’s fourth round. So Monday traffic, yeah, that could be it.
“Watson aimed that serve at Holmes’ body leaving Holmes with very little space to swing in. It was a clever move and for the first time this game Watson is only one point away from holding his serve.”
It was like the air had been pulled from his lungs. It wasn't the words... Okay, yes, actually, it was very much the words, but it wasn't solely the words. The image the words brought about was at least part of it, but the words-
For a moment afterwards there was stillness and the sound of their heavy breathing. He could feel Sherlock around him and was conscious of just how hard he still was even as Sherlock’s body was relaxing, but he didn’t move, content to linger in the moment, his arms supporting Sherlock’s back as well he could as they both caught their breath.
He was alright. More sleep was unlikely though, at least not right now, not with the amount of adrenaline currently coursing through his body. That was something he knew all too well from experience. This was hardly the first time he had woken up feeling like this. Nor was it the first time he had dreamt about fire. Gone, though, were the days when he would seek out his brother. Now he had replaced the familial with his books, or experiments, or, on the odd occasion, cocaine.
“Sure, it does. And that’s the difference between a good player and a great player. What do you do when you’re in that situation? How do you react when you find yourself under pressure? Do you dig deep and pull something out of the hat? Or do you start doubting yourself, your performance, your tactics? Do you panic?”
He met each thrust, harder and deeper, losing himself in the building pleasure. Every part of his body felt alive, and it was so good.
"Yes, Watson, of that I am aware," he said. His words were measured, his tone neutral, his expression leaning only a touch towards amusement.
"I slung a towel on the radiator over there. Should be a little warm by now. You should change out of those wet things sooner rather than later. There's a bag of your stuff by the sofa there. I just grabbed a selection of your things, so apologies if they don't match. There are more clothes in the wardrobe upstairs though. You're welcome to help yourself."
Easy to forget that the other man had kidnapped him in the pursuit of sex. But even that was not as-
Yet, despite everything so far this week, the doctor had only praised and encouraged him, even when some of the deductions had raised things the doctor no doubt would have preferred to have kept hidden. Like the dead lover, perhaps.
He packed the food and flask carefully away again. If he was prudent he had enough food and drink to last him another two days at least. It wouldn't be pleasant spending the night in the open, but he would do it if he had to.
"Confused though I was, I recovered my wits sooner than the young lady. On approaching her openly, she appeared to be in quite the daze, but allowed me to walk her back to her usual accommodation. Unfortunately, she could tell me nothing about the gentleman in question, barely able in fact to recall there being a gentleman at all. Certainly, by the next day when I paid her a call, she could remember nothing of the previous night.
Despite all the jokes about Sherlock having had the easier match, it was John who found himself the last awake that night, Sherlock out for the count not long after crawling under the covers. Maybe it had been the match, or the sex, or the good meal, or maybe it was simply that Sherlock had far less on his mind than he did.
The single word sliced through the room like a scythe through grass, cutting through his speech, halting his words.
That might be nice too. With the doctor. But only with him. Touching and being touched. The doctor probably knew how to do things, things that would be nice. He could do that.
“Now this is the Sherlock Holmes we’ve come to expect. He might have lost the first set and then needed a tie-break to take the second, but here in the third, he’s come out and he’s throwing everything at Watson. Fast balls, drop balls, slices, volleys, even the odd lob. He’s dragging Watson back and forth across that court like some sort of rag doll, refusing to allow Watson to settle into any sort of rhythm or play his own game at all.”
The weight and warmth against him moved away and he was partially aware of the doctor rising to his feet, of the sound of running water, then the coolness of the glass as it was pressed gently into his hand.
could be used to render a person unconscious long enough for them to be more securely incapacitated. The roll of duct tape under the sink could certainly be used to bind even the strongest of people to a kitchen chair. A GP in an oversized jumper shouldn't pose too much of a problem.
"You've hidden it. Pretty well considering I didn't find even the barest hint of it. Not that you’ve been looking after yourself properly.
“Did you see that? Perfect play there from Watson. Returning Holmes’ serve back on the wide side, he predicted Holmes’ favoured crosscourt return, got right on it and had the court right open for the down the line shot.”
Apologies in general to anyone who is Scottish. I honestly tried my best when it came to accents and phrases. One day I will learn not to have a main character speak even temporarily in another language or dialect.
John’s brow was furrowed but his eyes never left Sherlock’s throughout his whole speech. His first instinct was to reach out and place a hand on his friend’s shoulder in an effort to comfort him. He had only seen Sherlock reach an emotional spike like this one a few times before, but they were usually all for a case. He had seen the man cry right next to murderers in order to get their confession, he had seen him comfort an abducted little girl by holding her close and rocking until she fell asleep at the Yard, he had even seen him get choked up when Rosie first gave the detective a true, genuine smile, but never before had John seen Sherlock Holmes look so lost and scared himself.
"--have not." The detective rebutted quickly, making the doctor laugh. Sherlock took his phone back in his hand and started weighing the pros and cons of officially coming out in his head.
“Papa! Papa!” she said happily, a little skip in her step. Sherlock smiled big at the little girl and leaned forward so she ran into his open arms. “Gift, Papa,” she said as she held her hands out.
…” She stared directly into her brother’s eyes as she smirked like the devil himself. It was almost scary just how much she reminded Sherlock of Moriarty. The way she looked at him made his stomach twist.
“John,” he started softly, taking one step closer to him. He felt nerves rack up his spine, making his tongue feel a thousand times too thick for his mouth.
"Now, hold that thought, Mr. Holmes," he whispered with a quick peck before going to pick Rosie up. "Come on you," he said as he walked with her past the kitchen and into their bedroom.
“A gift for me? What is it?” Sherlock asked with a playful tone in his voice. The playfulness was replaced with a soft gasp of surprise. In the little girl’s hand, there was a golden ring.
"Well..." The blonde had to let out a puff of air, not knowing what to say. "Uhm... Well... If they won't tell the truth, then we can."
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he brow furrowed in confusion. He turned back to look at the monitor and saw the red dots disappear from his friends and parents.
"Just admit that you liked today," John said as he joined him. "It's okay to say that you've enjoyed our
Both men turned their heads up towards the ceiling, and it was like all the air was sucked out of the room. At the exact same time, they both slowly lowered their heads and looked back at each other; and John couldn't help but break out into laughter. Sherlock looked like he was going to cry and/or murder John right then and there.
Moriarty’s face burst on the screen to heighten the tension in the room. “Tick tock brother dear… Or your friends will all be seeing red…” Eurus taunted.
But once he had met Mary, John would look back on all those moments with Sherlock and try to pass them off like they were nothing. The way Sherlock could make John laugh without meaning to, the genuine, real smile that he would give him that he rarely ever gave to anyone else, the way Sherlock would just watch and observe John that would make his heart beat a little faster, none of that could have been love. No way. No, what he had with
John in his life, more than anything. And despite what it may look like on the outside, he loved his brother more than he would ever admit. He stepped back and squatted down, putting his head in his hands.
“You jumped off that roof, and unknowingly shattered the life of your best friend,” Eurus continued.
The way both of their eyes were half closed as they looked at each other with lust, it made the detective's mouth go dry; and he discovered that he quite liked the way they looked on camera.
"I don't know, love," John said as he moved the kettle onto the stove. "It's a mystery." He set a timer before walking back over to Sherlock and wrapping his arms around his waist. He leaned up on his tip toes to kiss the detective's cheek. "And since when do you care about what the fans think? Don't fans normally annoy you?" he smirked.
else other than right here. Hell, he’d even take being back on the battlefield than this place right now because being shot at over and over again was better than facing emotions for John Watson; and especially when those emotions revolved around his flatmate.
His thoughts were wiped clean when John started undulating his stomach down into Sherlock's ever-growing erection. "
Sherlock looked down at the object in his hand before looking up at John and Mycroft. His eyes quickly shifted back down to the white canvas on the floor, and it was suddenly very clear what this game would be.
John purred softly against the delicate skin of Sherlock's neck and started to lick lightly at the area behind his ear - eliciting a small moan out of the detective. The cheeky doctor let his hand slide down Sherlock's side and along the long leg curled around his waist. He snaked it back up to give his boyfriend a nice pat on the arse followed by a delicious squeeze that left Sherlock withering for more.
confused; and it made Sherlock huff out a small laugh, relaxing him. They were the same eyes he saw after they came home from chasing a criminal. They were the same eyes that lit up whenever he made a rather impressive deduction. And they were the same eyes that he had looked into for the past seven years, hoping.
buy you chocolates..." John smirked against the bruised skin of Sherlock's neck. He blew cold air over the mark and was delighted when he saw the texture change from smooth to prickled with goosebumps. "So by your own deduction..." He started to kiss down from Sherlock's neck to his collarbones and chest. He left a trail of little nips along the way that made Sherlock arch his back into the feel of John's expert mouth. "Then there's only one thing left for us to do as a couple..."
“Well, I guess I’ll break the tension,” Mycroft said as he straightened his suit jacket. “All I ask is you don’t shoot me in the head, I promised my brain to science,” he said with a small chuckle hidden in his voice. Sherlock’s eyes widened in confusion as he stared at his brother.
"I agree with everything you said. I love you so much Sherlock, and I love that you have accepted Rosie as your own daughter. And I vow to show you that love every day of my life." He cupped the back of his head and brought him in for a loving kiss.
"Alright, let's find a good one. Not so innocent, and not so..." he paused when he swiped right on his phone and saw the camera had taken a picture of them with John biting and tugging slightly on Sherlock's lower lip. "...explicit."
John laughed softly and moved to look up at Sherlock before leaning in to give him a small peck. "Yeah, I thought for sure that was the one thing they were going to write in. Especially after all that talk about this episode being 'ground-breaking' and 'history- making.'" He got up from his knees and brushed himself off before returning back to the kitchen. "Maybe next season, if there's another."
"You know, for someone who doesn't believe in this lovely holiday, you're very eager to..." John undulated his hips into Sherlock's, feeling the tell-tale outline of his morning wood - most likely educed even more by John's actions. "...
Sherlock cursed himself as he felt his bottom lip tremble and he immediately closed his eyes and turned his head slightly to look away from John. He wanted to melt into the floor. He wanted to crawl into the coffin and be buried alive. He wanted those snipers to turn on him and shoot. He would have taken any form of torture over these heartbreaking thoughts and feelings.
“You said earlier that Saint Valentine didn’t even do anything that involved love, but you’re wrong,” John continued; a small chuckle playing out in his voice when Sherlock tilted his head slightly like a confused little puppy. “Saint Valentine was imprisoned for performing weddings for soldiers that were forbidden to marry,” John informed. “Which, I think, is not only noble… but very appropriate in this situation,” he smiled.
The three men walked into the new room and were greeted by nothing but the static sounds coming from the blank television, and a small, open casket in the center.
Sherlock looked like his head was going to explode and John was loving every second of it. In the end, the detective settled for crossing his arms over his chest and sinking into a pout. "Worst Valentine's Day ever," he grumbled like a five-year-old, not even looking at John anymore.
Sherlock opened the camera on his phone and turned it to selfie mode as he brought John as close as he could to him. He smiled the sweetest smile down at his boyfriend before reconnecting their lips for another passionate kiss. As they kissed he took pictures of them, hoping there was at least one decent one in the bunch. He also took a picture of John kissing his cheek while he smiled - both men looking absolutely in love and happy.
“Stop it!” Sherlock yelled, almost falling to the floor in a tizzy mess of limbs. He closed his eyes again and took a deep breath. It was time to stop being scared. He had to do it.
"John...! Stop teasing...!" he whined before letting out a sound that could only be described as a human squeak. John let his tongue lazily lick along the trail of fine hairs on Sherlock's pelvis and it made the normally elegant detective react in a way that would have been embarrassing if he was with anyone else other than John. He leaned up on his elbows to watch John drive him crazy but found his head too heavy with stimulation to keep from rolling backwards - especially when John started to kiss along Sherlock's pubic bone and his hands started to slowly slide his boxers down.
“Wait,” John said, stepping forward and interjecting. “Out of the three of us, only two of us are geniuses, and we all know it’s not me,” he said. “You two could outsmart Moriarty, you can take down your sister. I’d probably just get in the way.” When those words left John’s mouth, his face turned pale and his eyes suddenly turned glassy. “You don’t need me.” He was a soldier, and soldiers accepted death.
The confession should have brought relief and happiness, or at least that’s the image that always danced around the detective’s head whenever he allowed himself to imagine it. But that had been a fantasy. In reality, the confession left Sherlock feeling miserable and vulnerable with tears streaking down his cheeks, staining them.
"I know, I know... I just think they could have done better without twisting the truth," Sherlock said, leaning his head down to rest on top of John's. "They didn't even get
“You called yourself a fake up on that roof, Sherlock, because it’s true. You’ve been faking since that very first night, haven’t you?” Eurus taunted.
“We’ve been through countless adventures Sherlock, and along the way, I not only found the best friend that I could ever ask for, but I also fell in love with him.”
John carefully watched Sherlock’s face, trying to pick up everything that was playing across his face. He was starting to ramble – a sign that he was nervous about something. Sherlock never got nervous though… “Pictured what?” he asked. “What are you talking about Sherlock?”
“Someone around 5’4’’, probably a woman,” Sherlock deduced. “It’s a cheaper looking coffin but not shabby, so someone who doesn’t have a lot of money, but isn’t a bum either… Perhaps middle class? Working class?”
"--sex, I remember," John finished for him. "Yet, I don't remember you complaining as you finished off the box of chocolates I gave you... And you
“No, dear brother. Wow, do I really have to explain everything to you?” She dramatically sighed and leaned forward in her chair so her face took up even more of the screen. “First mistake, you thought, or rather,
“Always the dramatic, aren’t you Sherlock,” Eurus said, gazing at him with a tilt of her head. That teasing, mock-innocent smile ever present. “Now, come on, one last puzzle for you…” she said as the door on the other side of the room slid open.
“Tsk, tsk, tsk, Doctor Watson, such a temper you have…” she smirked at him. “You should be thanking me! If not for me, Sherlock would have never had the nerve to finally tell you how he felt about you! And you as a doctor should know that bottling something like that up for so long isn’t good for one’s health.” Her icy eyes shifted to look at Sherlock and her smirk curled up even more. “Aww, look at my brother… He’s
Mycroft walked over to his brother and knelt down to put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. He couldn’t even imagine what was going on in his little brother’s head, but he wanted him to know that he was here for him. Mycroft always saw Sherlock as the lost little five-year-old that he could protect, and now more than ever did the older man want to protect his brother from the pain that was splattered across his face.
"Oh, you're awake," came John's voice as he entered the bedroom. He was dressed in his robe and the smell of fresh coffee was wafting in from the kitchen -
And then the symphony of text alerts and emails and notifications started flooding in from Sherlock's phone. The two men just looked from the phone to each other before busting out in a fit of giggles.
"I think... the reason why I don't care for this 'holiday' is because, people shouldn't feel the need to show love and affection on just this
“You horrid, sick, fucking bitch!” John exclaimed, practically charging the monitor as if Eurus was actually standing there. “So all of this was for nothing?! You just wanted to watch Sherlock say those things for your own sick pleasure?!”
"She has perfect timing, doesn't she?" John smirked as he sat up on his knees. Almost as if by reflex, Sherlock hooked the heels of his feet around John's legs, trying to keep him held on the bed; the murderous, almost delirious look still in his eyes.
“Hey sis, don’t mean to complain, but this one’s empty. Run out of ideas?” Sherlock said with a bit of a bite to his voice.
. He had never before thought about any other man in such a way. But Sherlock Holmes was not just any other man – which is why John didn’t think anything of it when he felt himself fall into a deep depression after he had jumped off that roof. Sherlock had changed his life in so many ways, and he loved him for that, and he kicked himself every day for not telling Sherlock that before he jumped.
The detective shook his head no as he looked at his fiancé. “Happy Engagement Day,” he said before sealing their lips together once more.
Sherlock finally removed himself from the sofa and stretched his limbs out before grabbing his phone and following John into the kitchen.
He really did want to come out. He wanted everyone to know how happy he was with John Watson as his boyfriend. But was he only doing it now because some writers hadn't included it in the show about his life? It took the kettle wailing for him to come back to the surface, and when he did, his mouth curved into a smile that would make the devil blush.
Eurus couldn’t hold in her delighted laughter as the screen jumped back to show her face. “That’s it Sherlock! That’s the passion I want to see!” This was all a twisted game for her own enjoyment. “Now I will admit, I stole this from Jim, but then again, he was always so brilliant at getting people to do what he wanted…”
..." he said with a small chuckle, always interested in the dozens nicknames and codes the fans created for the show over the years. "Hashtag...
The detective squeezed his eyes closed and shook his head to clear it. He slowly opened his eyes to see John still looking him over. His eyes were soft and warm, and still a
"Amazing," John answered before kissing Sherlock back, wrapping his arms around him. "How long do you think until someone notic--"
John bit his lip and glanced only for a moment in Mycroft’s direction. He knew the man was trying to make a joke and make light of this situation but it wasn’t a joke. They had already witnessed five people die today, and that was five more than John had ever wanted to see again. He crossed his arms and followed slowly behind Sherlock, trying just as hard to put the pieces together. Smaller woman who loved Sherlock…
“Sherlock, no!” John screamed, but it was too late. The detective pulled the trigger and crumpled to the floor as the bullet disappeared inside his torso. He could faintly hear John’s and Mycroft’s voices calling his name, but they sounded so far away. He was losing consciousness fast, but he knew he had to do it, he knew this was the only way to win this game.
“Five people that you care for, correct?” Eurus asked in a rather chipper voice. “Five people that you would do anything for, yes—“
John laughed and gave Sherlock one more kiss before getting off the bed and walking out to retrieve their daughter.
"Yes! Oh my god, yes," Sherlock whimpered, feeling his heartbeat in his groin as all the blood redirected itself there.
Both Sherlock and John looked over at Mycroft before walking to him. Mycroft turned the lid around to reveal a small golden nameplate that was attached.
“I love you so much John,” he whispered on his lips, tears streaming down his cheek as he hugged him close. “More than I could ever say.” He looked at the ring on his hand and hugged John even closer, unable to process just how amazing he was feeling in this moment.
“No, don’t! Stop!” Sherlock said, practically lunging at the screen. John and Mycroft both did the same – a sort of automatic response to protect. Mycroft had his hand covering his mouth and eyes blown wide while John kept looking from the screen to Sherlock and back again. Sherlock didn’t know which footage to look at and could feel himself start to shake slightly in a panic.
John laid down between Sherlock's legs so his mouth lined up perfectly with his nipples. The little buds were already standing at attention from all the teasing that he had unleashed upon his boyfriend. John made a sound in the back of his throat as he engulfed his right nipple. He switched fluently between using his teeth and his tongue to entice a gorgeous symphony of sounds out of Sherlock's mouth. John was always amazing when it came to foreplay, but this morning was a whole new meaning to the word. A light flush spread over the entirety of Sherlock's neck and chest as he thought about how John was treating him like he was some sort of king. Surely this couldn't be just because it was Valentine's Day, could it?
think I would be stupid enough to risk them noticing a red dot on them while I waited for you to finish up your sap fest?” The laughter that filled the room was cruel and mocking. “No, no, no, Sherlock. They’re all perfectly safe. I just needed a way for you to speed up your cute little love confession.”
!” she congratulated, her twisted smile looking even more sinister with the obvious joy that was dancing on top of it. “Well done indeed! You know, I should really give you more credit, I didn’t think you had it in you to actually confess your feelings.”
He went to stand behind John and waited until he finished with the tea to turn him around and kiss him passionately. The doctor's eyes widened slightly but soon closed when the detective cupped his face and deepened the embrace.
The detective moaned again and would have sworn that his hips pressed up into John's of their own accord. "T-This 'holiday' is just an excuse for couples to buy chocolate and hav -- ahh!" He drew in a sharp breath that quickly changed into a shout of a moan as John started to bite and suck a mark into his neck. "H-Have sex..." he finished weakly, biting down on his own lip to prevent any more embarrassing sounds. It was very hard to prove his point when John had the knowledge of every single thing that made the detective squirm in arousal.
Sherlock swallowed as he looked at the footage in front of him, and he had a sinking feeling about all of this. “Molly in her kitchen, Mrs. Hudson watching television, Lestrade in his office, and my parents reading,” he answered.
“You have no right to talk about that day or about me,” John said, his voice dangerously low and angry. “You know
John walked slowly back from the bedroom and leaned against the doorframe of the kitchen, the sweetest smile on his face. He could see every cog in Sherlock's head turning as he looked over the ring. He could see so many thoughts and emotions play out on his face as he weighed it in his hand and allowed his finger to trace over the smooth curve of it. This was a moment that John would never forget as long as he lived.
The sunlight slipped into the room through the window and illuminated Sherlock's face, causing him to slowly awake from his sleep. He groaned like a little kid being woken up by their parents and turned over so his face no longer got the brunt of the bright sun. It was no use however, his body had decided that he was awake, no matter how much he protested. He brought his hand up to rub his eyes as he slowly opened them. He blinked a few times in confusion when he saw a vase of beautiful red roses standing on his nightstand. He raised his hand up to feel one of the flowers. They were real, but where did they come from? Why were they here?
Sherlock didn’t dare steal a glance at John but he could feel the pain and anger radiating off him as he was forced to relive that moment.
“Don’t you think I fucking know that?!” Sherlock yelled back at his brother, rounding on him. Despite his outburst, his eyebrows were turned upwards, making his eyes look even sadder and scared. “You act as if I’m just talking about the weather, but this is a lot more complicated than that,” he said. “But you wouldn’t even understand how hard this is, would you, brother mine?” His tone was direct and pointed - stinging like a wasp. “
right," he mumbled. "Especially after that build up in The Lying Detective, they should have just written in when I told you I loved you, it wouldn't have been that hard. I counted about five different areas within the episode where they could have easily put it in."
“Alright then, since you’re playing dumb, let’s add some incentive,” Eurus said, those last few words practically slithering out of her mouth like a poisonous snake. The screen then changed to show four different surveillance videos. “Now tell me Sherlock, what are you looking at?” came his sister’s voiceover.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I already told you, there's nothing special about a made up holiday. It's just an excuse for chocolates and--"
Sherlock then turned to look at John and couldn’t help but smile. “And you, John Watson… you’ve saved me more times than you could ever imagine, in so many ways. I will always love you.” He saw John’s jaw tighten as he kept eye contact with him.
Sherlock gave Mycroft a small nod of thanks and stood up with his brother’s help. He straightened his jacket and wiped the dust off before starting towards the open door – back into battle.
The sound of clapping filled the room through the speakers and Eurus’ face soon appeared back on the television screen.
“Remember that footage of your friends and family?” Eurus asked as the four video screens came back on the monitor. “If you don’t play my game, I think I’ll finish what Jim started,” she said as five little red sniper dots appeared on the five people on screen – Molly, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and Sherlock’s parents.
Sherlock looked over at the camera in the room. His chest was rising and falling a little more rapidly than he wished. This was cruel. She was forcing him to confront his deepest secret and then ripping it out of him without much consent. He closed his eyes and hung his head briefly, forcing himself to hold back the hot tears that threatened to surface – tears of embarrassment and fear.
“Oh, I know everything about you, Doctor Watson. More, in fact, than you know yourself.” Her face now turned to directly look at John. “For instance, do you know
As soon as the words left John’s mouth, it was like a dagger had been shoved into Sherlock’s heart. That was it then, John didn’t need to say anymore. He tried as best as he could to keep his face neutral, to not show the pain and heartbreak that was eating up his insides, but even the world’s only consulting detective couldn’t help his eyes from turning glassy again as his stomach squeezed itself into a knot.
John's smile grew three times its size at Sherlock's words. He promised himself he'd do it when the time was right, and right now, it was perfect.
“That’s not true John, and you know it,” Sherlock said, taking a step closer to his friend. “Don’t sell yourself short.” He took a risk and put his hand on John’s shoulder, relieved when he didn’t pull away or shake him off him. “I could have never solved those crimes without you. You’re the key to it all John Watson.
"I take it your lack of communication on any level means you didn't like it?" John asked, looking at Sherlock through the opening in the door frame. "I mean, it wasn't as good as last week's, but I don't think I minded--"
All three men turned their gaze from the monitor to the casket. What were they supposed to do with an empty casket? It wasn’t very big, that’s for sure.
Sherlock took another deep breath and looked down at his shoes for a moment before returning to John’s gaze. “I thought I was never going to see you again, John. You had been the best friend, and most incredible man that I had ever had the pleasure of knowing… And I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t tell you,” he said, voice cracking slightly as his true feelings started to rise up.
The detective stood up slowly and turned around so that he faced John. In one brief second he could see the slight confusion in John’s face as he looked at him, and it made Sherlock close his eyes again as a defense mechanism.
Sherlock quickly shot that down, someone else already on his mind. “Don’t be ridiculous, look at the coffin… Unmarried, practical about death… Alone.”
Sherlock grunted slightly and reached his hand around to give John a small slap on his arse. It was too early for sarcasm. John started to laugh and kissed Sherlock's shoulder again. "Of course they're for you, babe. I want today to be special from start to finish."
Sherlock matched his smirk and let his fingers card through John's hair before giving it a small tug. "Maybe you can change my mind about this holiday..." he murmured, his voice a clear octave deeper than normal.
His confession just hung there in the air, suffocating the room. This is why Sherlock had never acted upon his feelings, this is why he tried as hard as he could to push sentiment out of his life; this is what he had been terrified of.
“It’s not empty Sherlock,” Eurus said, her face appearing on the monitor. “You still have the gun, haven’t you?”
day. They should show it every day of the year." He turned to look at John and leaned in to kiss his lips. "This, right here, this is what I love. You and me, and Rosie." He turned to smile at the little girl. "I love our little family, and I love what our relationship has become. And I don't need some damn holiday to show that."
The detective grunted again and slapped John's thigh this time. What did he say about the sarcasm?? Too. Early.
When he entered the room, he found that it was bare except for a canvas on the floor and a monitor against the wall.
"Alright, we have plenty of time to experiment more with camera work later," John smirked, reading exactly what was dancing around in that giant brain of Sherlock's. "Just pick one out for Twitter, will ya?"
John looked back out at his flatmate to see him now looking down at his lap, arms now wrapped around himself.
That was it, that was the last straw. Sherlock was done being a puppet for his sister. He was done being laughed at and mocked and he was done being trapped in this twisted Saw trap that she had developed for them. He walked back over to the coffin and started to smash it. He needed to get his anger out, he needed to destroy the object that started this whole debacle. This is what she had wanted all along. She had made the coffin intended for John because she knew Sherlock’s confession would kill any sort of relationship – friend or romantic – they had.
“—What are you playing at?!” Sherlock interrupted, his breathing coming in a little faster than he would have wanted.
"The night ended with me shooting a cab driver to save his life, and I realized then and there that I would do anything for that man.” John smiled big and bright as he gently cupped Sherlock’s face, stroking his cheek with his thumb. The gentle touch was the catalyst for Sherlock to close his eyes and allow his tears to flow silently down his cheek.
Just as John was about to free Sherlock's straining cock, there was a cry from the upstairs bedroom.
“Do you remember that day on the tarmac?” Sherlock started, trying to collect his thoughts. “The one when I thought I was going to be exiled?”
"They treated my sister like she was some sort of psychopathic monster and she wasn't. She was just lost and scared and.. and... and Redbeard! What gives them the right to just write out my dog like he didn't exist? This is not what they said they had in mind when we met up with them over the summer."
“Seven years ago, I came back to London, and didn’t really know if I was even going to make it to see another year,” John started, his own eyes becoming glassy. He really had been so alone when he met Sherlock, and he really did owe him so much. “But then I met this very tall, very smart, very gorgeous man, and I let him borrow my phone." Both men huffed out a chuckle at that, memories swirling around both of their heads.
Sherlock stood back up and took in a deep breath to clear his head. The room turned red as Moriarty’s face came on the screen to hurry Sherlock up with his decision. He stepped back so he was equal distance from Mycroft and John.
happy in my entire life." He gave Sherlock's hands a small squeeze as he blinked back his own tears of happiness.
The doctor's smile grew, and walked over to the two. “Thank you so much for all your help, Rosie,” he said as he picked his daughter up and kissed her cheek. He put her down and took the ring from Sherlock before bringing him to stand up, holding his hand. The detective was biting his lip as he blinked down at John, trying as hard as he could to keep his tears from leaving his eyes.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock said, allowing himself to be pulled back into the snuggle hold. “Could be interesting, but we wouldn’t all fit in the bed.”
Getting to his feet, Sherlock crossed the room to the kitchen table, picking up the single key. "Show me," he said and tossed the key over.
The hand was the only thing to touch him, but it was enough to shake the spiralling thoughts from head, grounding him back in the present.
“Obviously, since you already had a key to Baker Street, that one is a duplicate, but the gesture did not seem complete without that one, more so than any of the others.”
“Love Really Hurts Without You” was one of the first songs attached to this story, although I ended up using it in a slightly different way than I had originally envisioned.
It was another three quarters of an hour before his partner finally made an appearance, carrying his own bags, Lestrade for once not trailing after him.
The doctor was quiet when he re-entered the cottage. The dampness to the bottom of his trousers spoke of a walk, his expression as his eyes flicked to the two unmoved keys on the table spoke of surprise and uncertainty. He didn't comment on the keys though, just took off his coat and boots before taking the armchair opposite the one that Sherlock was occupying.
“Except, Watson will know this. He will know exactly what Holmes is like, so he will do everything he can to keep Holmes on the back foot. Holmes is a brilliant player, technically one of the best the game has ever seen, but he’s not unbeatable. Moriarty’s beaten him twice in Grand Slams this year; Nadal’s beaten Holmes twice in the past month. Who knows, maybe it’s now Watson’s turn.”
Sherlock was looking at him with a look of amusement, already noticeably different from the boy he had been. Gone already was the gangly, awkward teenager, still a stranger in his newly grown body. He was more upright now, head high, shoulders back, self-assurance evident in every cell. This was the new him. The proper him.
noticed then. For all his mild persona and easy going attitude, the doctor was intellectually sharp. Not perhaps at his level when it came to making deductions, but certainly, despite what he claimed, far more attentive than the average person.
He signed the autographs with a flourish and posed for a couple of photos, before making his way back to the changing rooms.
Words were murmured and heads turned as they entered, but their presence was deemed otherwise unremarkable.
"If you're done critiquing my book collection," the doctor said with a mild hint of amusement, "there's a box of games behind you which need storing. Cupboard under the stairs. Move stuff around, but there should be enough room."
John would have giggled at the whole display if it wasn’t for the fact there was something undeniably satisfying about Sherlock’s reaction. Knowing Sherlock so nakedly physically desired him was as much a turn on for him as for Sherlock. God knows Sherlock was definitely a physical turn on for him to.
.” Sherlock rolled his eyes when it became clear that he wasn’t moving fast enough and if he wasn’t moving fast enough it was because he wasn’t comprehending what was apparently going to happen. “Inside and out,” Sherlock added.
For a cupboard under the stairs it was considerably well organised. The left was taken up with coats and other outdoor wear, while the shelves to the right were stacked high with well used games. Old classics such as chess and draughts sat with newer classics: Monopoly, Cludeo, Battleships, Ludo, Risk, Coppit, Operation, Sorry!, and more. Boxes with bent corners and dented sides. Some boxes mended with sellotape, held closed with discoloured string. Well used. Well loved. Well played games.
With the passing centuries, the acceptance for who we were and what we did as men together had varied considerably. At best it was something barely remarked upon, at worst we were forced to conceal that as much as we did everything else. For the most part though, it passed with little more than a glance or comment by our acquaintances, and, by and large, even by society as general.
He shoved the first ball into his pocket and balanced the second on his racket head. Sherlock was already at his baseline, twisting his upper body in his final warm up. No different from practice really.
One, the doctor wasn't prepared for an extensive length stay - two points towards the likelihood of being allowed to leave in seven days, one point towards the likelihood of being murdered instead.
The hug was as large and encompassing as the greeting was loud and warm. Sherlock wasn't sure what threw him more, seeing the doctor willingly physically embracing this man, or the fact they knew each other in the first place.
“Holmes doesn’t appear to be paying any attention to the crowd as he wipes his face and gathers himself for his next serve. Which goes long. Holmes steadies himself, bounces the next ball, once, twice, then serves. Watson returns, Holmes backhand down the line, Watson chases, Holmes backhand down the middle, Watson gets it and what a return there from Watson. Backhand, pushed as wide as it could go and Holmes had no chance.”
“Holmes knew exactly where that serve was going, and he knew exactly what he was going to do with it, and he executed that with his famous precision, inch perfect on the baseline.”
“Smart side of casual will be fine. Shirt, jeans, that sort of thing. I’m sure anything you chose will suit.”
"That may be," I said with some shortness, "but even your skills could not foresee what I am about to tell you. It is unlikely that you will even believe me, but it is of the honest truth, and I beg that you at least let me finish before declaring my sanity suspect."
Holmes had spent the summer months in a state of activity, as buoyed by the pleasant weather as the rash of crime that came with it. While his reputation was far from the heights he would later enjoy, he had a steady stream of visitors, and between cases, there was a bustling, living city to become ever increasingly acquainted with.
The trousers and pants were the first things to go, and other than using his hands and lifting his hips to help, the doctor made no other direct movement. Even when their kisses started to become more heated, when it was clear the doctor wanted more, he made no move, just let Sherlock continue to explore his own way in his own time.
The energy that thrummed through him from the recent feed was slowly fading into melancholy. The crash after the high. Moving was good for him. Inactivity gave way to dark thoughts, dark thoughts to even darker deeds.
John watched as the vehicle drove away, his eyes closing only after it had been lost even from his sight.
Biting into his banana, John chewed absently. In any other situation he would have been delighted to be a set up. He was delighted, but there was something else there was well.
“Hello and welcome to quarter finals day here at the US Open. We’re coming live to you from a sunny Arthur Ashe Stadium where shortly the first of the men’s quarter final matches will be getting underway. Recent Wimbledon Champion and current British number two, John Watson will be looking to add the world number three, Sherlock Holmes’ name to his growing list of defeated top players. After comfortably seeing off Chinese wonder-kid, Zhi Zhu, in the last round, Watson faces a much tougher challenge in Holmes, who is also, to add further complications into the mix, his training and newly formed doubles partner. Can Watson carry on his remarkable recent form in Grand Slam competitions? Can Britain triumph over old rivals France? Can Watson beat Holmes? You’ll just have to stay with us to find out.”
"Yeah, that's not going to-" He eyed the room critically again. "Sofa it is then," he said, pointing to the far end. "Sit."
Kissing was not going to be the sole act, though, this he was certain. Even with penetration as the ultimate goal, Sherlock was certain there would need to be other activities that would bridge the two extremes.
Running the tap, he took his time rinsing his hands under the cold water. The face in the mirror still looked flushed, but there was nothing he could really do about that.
He couldn't stop the questioning look, but the doctor failed to continue. It was almost as if he was taking great delight out of the situation.
Of course that hadn’t stopped Sherlock from diving into full research mode. Apparently, Sherlock hadn’t spent all of his time after his match on the Saturday watching Nadal trounce Simons, or deciding what would be the outfit most conducive to seducing John Watson and then shagging his brains out. Sherlock had also tuned into Zhi Zhu’s game and gleamed what he could from a set and a half, and had then presented it to John with a flourish and an expression not too dissimilar to a cat’s when presenting their owner with a freshly killed dormouse.
John sucked in a deep breath. He could feel the anger churning within him, building, searching for an outlet. He wanted to grab Sherlock and shake him. Force him not to keep things hidden. He wanted to shout and rave, to swear and to fight. But most of all he wanted to hunt down Jim bloody bastard Moriarty and punch him in the face. And then keep punching him. Over. And over. And over.
"Because that's what they told you, is it not?" the doctor continued, still holding his gaze. "The children at that school you were forced to go to. The parents who smiled to your face, but said things behind your back. Even the teachers who should have helped you but instead felt threatened by your intelligence. They called you a freak. A loner. A weirdo.
Sherlock, of course, denied that he had challenged John to at least reach the quarter finals on the off chance they would get to face each other on opposing sides of the net. The chance to face someone who had beaten him in the only professional game they had played against each other naturally did not come into it, nor did the chance to beat one of the few players to have beaten Moriarty that season.
Of course this was planned. Sherlock had probably gone through his wardrobe and picked out the outfit most conducive to seduction. As usual he was pretty well spot on, wrong only on the account that the clothing barely mattered. He could be wearing a bin liner and John would be happily seduced.
Circling the head with his hand was enough to stop the doctor's words. A slight tightening of his fingers was enough to elicit an exhaling of air and a small chuckle. After that it was merely a task of trying different things and judging from the reactions what the doctor particularly liked.
The words caught him off guard, completely at odds to their mood and position. He braced to pull away, but a firm tightening of the arms around him told him not to.
Mummy and Daddy were also abroad, enjoying a cruise in the Caribbean. The absence of all authority figures had made this the perfect time for experimentation and discovery, free from the eyes of those who would protest and stop him.
“Because, John Watson,” Sherlock had said clambering to his feet and planting his hands on John’s shoulders, “you made a promise that you would at least make it to the quarter finals, and you’re not a man to renege on his promises.”
The doctor looked blank for a moment, eyes darting back to the door as if they might hold the answer until the full question finally dawned on him.
He shrugged again, reluctant to admit that in truth he had no idea who they were. "They seemed as good a choice as any."
Despite everything, there were weaknesses to Sherlock’s game. While his first serve was fast, accurate and technically brilliant, he relied too heavily on it, leaving him with a weaker than expected second serve. Known for his killer forehand and his inch perfect baseline play, errors tended to creep in when he was pulled into the net. And for a player who deduced his opponent and then played on his opponent’s weaknesses, he could be at least momentarily thrown by the unexpected.
And take him he would, over and over, driving into him again and again, wringing climax after climax from the beautifully responsive body, taking him to higher and higher heights, until finally satisfied, he would finally let himself go, and tip them over the final edge together.
And then suddenly he was there. For a moment there was stillness, like standing on top of a mountain, and then he was crashing down to a triumphant yell and finally a hand to his cock to prolong his climax.
"You took a lonely, insecure, teenage virgin and you tempted him with everything he so desperately wanted. You even let me think you were suicidal. As if bullets could do anything to you.
"It wasn't as you might think," he said after a moment. "It wasn’t a big thing for me. There was no struggle, no self-hate, no big moment of realisation. At least not about this. I was young. Curious. Unconstrained. There were girls. There were boys. Then there was Harry, and that was that."
look. The Mark IV was similar to the Mark III, but where the Mark III could be translated roughly as
The quarter finals. The bet had been that he should be able to at least reach the quarter finals if he put his mind, shoulder and belief into it. It was the challenge Sherlock had thrown down at him, and like the headstrong, impetuous person John could be – especially when any form of gambling might be involved – he had risen to the bait and been reeled in by his cunning, wily boyfriend.
He’d expected as much. So far they had pencilled in the definites, but Moselle and Montpellier both wanted Sherlock to play in their tournaments, and he and Sherlock still hadn’t decided upon China or Japan. Clara was also under the impression that if John wasn’t playing he should be available to continue with the interviews, presentations and appearances that had fallen by the wayside due to his return to tennis. She was quite adamant about it in fact. Adamant and forceful.
Alan Turing’s war time work, although well-known now, remained secret for many years due to the Official Secrets Act. A play called “Breaking the Code”, based on his life and work, and which thematically linked his cryptographic activities with his attempts to grapple with his homosexuality, was staged in the West End in 1986, transferring to Broadway in 1988. The play was then adapted for television in a 1996 BBC filmed production, and starred Derek Jacobi, who had always played the role in the stage productions.
After that there was no more movement, other than the swaying of their bodies. It was nice, but now he was over the initial surprise, Sherlock found himself impatient for more and the doctor wasn't- oh.
“Oh, for goodness sake. Stop trying to deduce and just open it. Your food it getting cold. Or better yet, eat first and open it while I’m in the shower.”
“That’s not the only present I have for you,” Sherlock said, “but it seemed prudent to give those to you before the match.
He slipped his arm around Sherlock, who wiggled a bit until they could find a mutually comfortable position.
Awareness creeping back in, Sherlock lay still, eyes closed as he once again tried to take in his surroundings. He was in bed, the covers heavy and warm over him. Not
Right, third set. Remember what Sherlock told you. Zhi Zhu is going to have to come for you now. He’s going to attack and attack hard. Hold your ground, hit the balls back and wait for him to make the mistakes, then when he does, punish him, hard, swift, sharp, like an arrow through the heart.
It wasn't about him – Sherlock – after all. It wasn't him the doctor really wanted. It was about the doctor. About Harry. About what had been. He had just been caught up in someone else's story. Here, no doubt, because of his uncanny resemblance to someone dead and gone. The doctor could have chosen to kidnap anyone who matched the right criteria. Being here didn’t mean he was special.
"You want me," he whispered, because that was where all of this had started. "You want me. And I don't know- no one has ever-
Grabbing his racket, he got to his feet, a plan in mind. He might live to regret this, but he knew he would probably regret it more if he didn’t do it.
Floor to ceiling, the shelves held a collection a small library would have been proud of; fiction and non-fiction; plays, poetry, novels; essays and text books; what looked to be an early publication of
The doctor was waiting for him when he emerged. That was, he was sitting in his armchair, fingers between the pages of that stupid reincarnation book, but it was obvious that he was basically waiting.
The engine starting, there was another pause, then slowly the vehicle began to back up, turn and then carefully pulled away.
After a lifetime of travel and adventure, he had devoted the last years of his life to the quiet sorting and publishing of his many findings and observations. It had been a peaceful, pleasant time, one I have only fond memories of, but with his leaving there was nothing to hold me to such an existence and the desire to be once again amongst my own people gripped me.
“Watson discards one ball, but accepts the next one. Now, what can he do here to stop Zhi Zhu getting his fourth consecutive point and going a break up in this second set? Watson steadies himself and then serves. It’s good. Zhi Zhu returns, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu forehand, Watson returns, Zhi Zhu reaches it, Watson with the half volley, Zhi Zhu gets it, Watson again, Zhi Zhu … and oh, excellent reflexes there from Watson at the net. He can’t have seen that one coming and yet he somehow managed to get his racket to it and he saves the break point.”
What he needed was something he could cover himself with but would be easy enough to remove. Something like... the tartan bathrobe.
That was hardly the reaction Sherlock had been expecting. He paused for a moment, carefully scrutinising the other man. Nothing suggested anything other than complete honesty.
Despite only having a basic knowledge of advanced mathematics, Sherlock could see the genius behind what he was seeing.
He froze, the words dying suddenly in his throat. For a moment he undoubtedly looked like an imbecile, mouth moving but no sound emerging, brow deeply furrowed, but that was the price he was more than willing to pay if he had really heard what he thought he had heard.
He drank, the water sloshing against his face, cooling the skin there. He felt ablaze. Heated. His groin felt-
2) Later folklore: monsters similar to vampires and succubi that seduce young men and then feed on their blood.
Sherlock frowned for a moment, but then seemed to think nothing of it, launching back into some spiel about idiotic French reporters and in that instant John knew he had made the right decision.
Which meant going back out there. Maybe he had mistaken the doctor's meaning. Just because the other man said he wanted him didn’t necessarily mean he meant sexually.
There was very little he could say to that, but that was fine since Clara was more than capable of controlling the conversation. For the most part, the majority of what he was expected to say was ‘yes’, with the occasional, ‘of course.’ In that respects it wasn’t all that different from some conversations with a certain Frenchman.
“Unforced error there from Watson, but Holmes gave him very little to play with. Holmes certain knows how to push an opponent into making mistakes.”
The words startled them both into silence. The doctor looked away at that, lips pressed tightly together, and then he started to laugh. It was more of a giggle at first, but then it was definitely a laugh, a full, contagious, body laugh. And then there were tears. Which again seemed to catch them both equally by surprise. And then the doctor was sinking to the floor, the sofa and armchairs apparently too far away. And he was still laughing.
Just like he had promised to stop if Sherlock requested it, and had then kept his word when told to stop.
Following the death of my beloved botanist and zoologist in '53, I found myself suddenly devoid of occupation. Clean living, fresh air and advancements in medicine had allowed my dear Sherlock to live longer than either of us had dared hope, before finally passing away at the respectable age of 71.
The answer given by the Old Man of the Mountain is: Out there, where sky shines, humans say: 'To thyself be true'. In here, trolls say: 'Be true to yourself and to hell with the world.'
"Not so much," the doctor admitted as he slipped the records back into their sleeves. "He didn't so much mind slow dancing, but anything faster, I think, made him feel clumsy. Two left feet, so to speak."
Sherlock blinked owlishly for a moment, scanning the room for the obvious changes in time. Darkness had fallen outside, while inside new logs had been added to the fire, and Mendelssohn had been exchanged for Elgar.
The LPs told him something similar. They were all recorded between 1976 and the present. The board games had been published likewise. All newer than 1976, and all initially unopened, because there had been no one to play with.
"Oh," Sherlock drawled slowly, "I'm sure this is exactly what it looks like. Not exactly the legally mandated locked cabinet, is it,
He tried catching up on some of his course reading that had been somewhat overlooked during the week, but his mind did not want to settle.
“Holmes is now just two points from taking the break. What can Watson do about it? Again Watson serves and again it bounces long. Second serve for Watson. Holmes steps in as he returns backhand down the line. Watson scampers, forehand crosscourt. Holmes pushes it deep, Watson returns, Holmes forehand, Watson gets it, Holmes with the drop shot and Watson had no chance.”
Oh. Right. Well, that was certainly informative and the blood John could suddenly feel rushing in a downward direction certainly made a specific part of his anatomy twitch in anticipation.
The odd scribble, correction or addition did match the copious lines of mathematical equations in various notebooks, but the original writings were in a different hand. Or, in fact, in two different hands if the even older manuscripts were to go by, and in this case, old was indeed old. Late nineteen and early twentieth centuries for the 'newer' manuscripts. Early to mid-nineteenth century for the 'earliest'.
“Home,” John said. “I’ve always considered it less of a place and more of the person you share it with. In which case, you’re bloody well stuck with me now.”
Grieg wrote "Hall of the Mountain King" as incidental music for the sixth scene of Act 2 in Henrik Ibsen's 1867 play "Peer Gynt". The play is based on "Per Gynt", a Norwegian fairy tale.
It had changed because rather than doing everything in his power to avoid the whole point of the doctor's rather ludicrous endeavour, Sherlock was now considering what the whole thing would actually entail.
“I have a flat, in Spain,” John finally said into the pause. “I can’t say that it’s much. Pretty poky actually. Not exactly what you might call a home, more of a temporary stopping place. Was planning on selling it actually, well before. Not that I knew where I would go.” He straightened up, his other hand reaching out to rest on the box. “These, well. These are not only yours, your properties, your homes, but the fact that you’re not only giving me access, but also ownership. You’re… god, I haven’t had somewhere to call home in such a long time, and now you’re giving me six. This is more than I could, well, more than I have ever been given or could have even imagined.”
“Alright,” he said. “Obviously they brought up the fact we’re going to be facing each other in the next round.”
Resting his hand against the door, Sherlock slid out the bolt and paused. Once again there was movement downstairs which told him that he was not the only person up and about. The bathroom, however, was downstairs, and there was only so long that he could deny his physical needs.
boy by all meanings of that term. It was something desired, something wanted, something worth sacrificing
This whole part was going to end with him climaxing, so unzipping himself certainly made sense, and yet to Sherlock it seemed like a big step. It brought the inevitable that bit closer.
in the original Spanish; the works of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes and Euripides in Greek; Seneca and Virgil in Latin;
When I searched through violin forums for favourite violinists and pieces, Rabin’s name was one that was often mentioned.  He played and recorded all of Paganini’s Caprices for solo violin, a tie-in here as Canon!Holmes was a Paganini fanboy. In "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box", Watson reports how, over a bottle of claret, Holmes told “anecdote after anecdote” about the extraordinary violin virtuoso, Paganini. The significant thing about Paganini’s Caprices is that they are études – usually short pieces of music, considerably difficult to play and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill. Reason, I believe, that Canon!Holmes was particularly drawn to them.
"Well, yes," the doctor agreed. "Last night was a late one and you were up early, going through the room."
This was definitely not his room, but also not somewhere he had ever been before. For a moment he considered the likelihood of his brother's interfering hand, but the simple yet warmly decorated room was a far cry from either the overblown Victoria extravagance his brother favoured, or the white clinical starkness he would have expected from a medical facility.
There was a flash of a smile at the acknowledged weak joke, but then the doctor had turned away and busied himself relaying the fire. He did so quickly and smoothly and it wasn't long before both the light and the warmth added to the room.
There was noise and movement and flickering light that was spreading hotter and brighter. Everything was burning, crumbling, falling. People were shouting, crying, screaming.
"Direct descendent of a clan chief," the doctor said, "if you take his word for it. Probably is too, through a younger son and a couple of daughters, but don't let him hear that."
“It’s fine,” he said quickly, for a brief moment wondering what he would do, how he would feel if he couldn’t be seen in public with Sherlock. They weren’t out officially as a couple – a conversation they had yet to have and not something he really wanted to consider at present – but their friendship and partnership on court did allow them a little more flexibility than most. They weren’t, for one, the centre of tabloid attention.
The doctor stopped for a moment, a thoughtful look on his face. "I can't play that," he said, pointing to the violin. "Certainly not the way it's supposed to be played." He leant forward again. "But I can play the human body. And what I most want to do is to coax every musical note I can out of you. I want to know what makes you moan, what makes you groan, what it takes to have you scream my name.
Breathing deeply, he looking quickly around, reorienting himself. They were on the bed, side by side, the doctor a touch higher up, allowing for the embrace Sherlock had just wrenched himself from. Sherlock was naked, flaccid, the doctor not quite on either account. He was being watched, carefully, but not judgementally or disappointedly. Just carefully. With care.
“You won Wimbledon. Of course you’re going to be nominated for Sports Personality,” Clara had said when he had offered a joke about that not being a sure thing. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
He looked between the two men, stacking up the deductions around probability, upbringing and linguistic ease. No, he decided, not a first language, but close.
He expected a defensive comment back, but the doctor merely seemed to find it amusing and took it as a sign to slip the tips of his fingers under the waist band of Sherlock’s jeans.
It was true, his mind told him, anything could have been done to him while he was unconscious. But it hadn't, had it. He had awoken in a comfortable bed, with his clothes - other than his shoes and socks - still on. He could have quite easily have awoken to find himself handcuffed, or bound to the bed, or worse, but he hadn't. He had been given space, given a drink, been treated more like a guest than a captive, but there was no guarantee that that would continue. A man who not only considered abducting a near stranger but also carried it through could not be completely sane. Except, to Sherlock's rational mind he could understand the thought process the doctor must have gone through. In a twisted way it made a strange amount of sense.
Then the fingers were gone again, along with the press of skin and the body heat. He heard rather than saw the moment; Sherlock’s underwear hitting the floor, then the sound of rustling.
Because of course Sherlock had pulled the second match on the bigger court, just in time for evening in Europe and after the midday sun here. But John couldn’t complain too much. He was in the fourth round of the US Open and scheduled to play on the second biggest court, in front of a ten thousand strong army of fans. Things would never get much better than this.
“Watson looks pensive as he goes to collect the balls. He knows he can’t afford to let Zhi Zhu dominate, nor can he afford to give away cheap points.”
"Sorry I wasn't here, but I hope you didn't mind me going out. I passed a shop so got you a paper, but more than that, here, it's for your room."
Drying himself off for the last time, he discarded the wet towel for a fresh one, briefly considered slipping on a bath robe before deciding that since anything he was going to put on was going to some off rather quickly he might as well keep it simple.
No. He shook his head, alarmed at the foggy, sluggishness he was feeling. His brain felt heavy, useless. Dehydration, he concluded.
Part chuckle, part moan and the doctor responded with all eagerness, his own hand seeking out the ties to the dressing gown, loosening it, but pausing in an unvoiced question.
“Only if we can prove it,” Sherlock said. “Which we can’t. Oh Moriarty is clever. Very clear. That’s how he’s got this far. It will be our word against his and he’ll just smile and play the innocent. No, he knows we’ve got nothing.”
Sherlock had rolled his eyes. “Experience, John,” he said. “You’re a solid all-rounder with the experience to recognise an opening and the capability to take it. Keep him guessing, keep him jumping, and then go for the kill. Short, sharp, brutal. Let him do the hard work, you just finish him off. Don’t play the game he wants you to. Don’t string it out. Go for the point and he won’t be able to respond. Trust me.”
His Sherlock, whose life had been entwined with his since before modern time had begun. His artistic mathematician, his Victorian detective, his Regency zoologist, his Culloden boy-soldier, all the way back to his Roman captive who had refused to cower before the impossible.
If there was one thing he had missed this week, it was his violin, and here, here was the most exquisite example he could have ever imagined. And it belonged to a dead man.
"That said, my dear Holmes," I said after I had somewhat reluctantly moved aside. "Your current countenance is as foreign to your usual state as a camel is to the Arctic."
The sheet of paper was on the table when he went down that morning. Beside it was the nib pen that had been obviously used on it. Catching his name amongst the plain but flowing script, he paused with a frown.
The doctor had taken off his shoes and socks as well. No doubt because they were wet. It did draw some attention to his pale feet though, so innocent in appearance, much like the Aran jumper that almost swamped him.
the memory until it had become a much smaller, less important thing, making it easier to live without.
It was only then that he realised that he had simply presumed that the bedroom he had awoken in would be his.
Certain I was not to be rejected, I granted him the kiss which he returned quite eagerly, putting to good use all the lessons he had learned in the past few weeks.
Paper and pencil was not the only medium used. Two oil paintings rested in frames on the floor, their size and slight fading telling them to be the missing bedroom pieces. The first was of the castle from the day before, thin sunlight softening the rugged stone while somehow emphasising the sense of loss and loneliness. The second was the exact same scene but this time of an imagined past, the brighter sunlight warming the magnificent whole structure while casting a shadow of what was to come.
John is indeed a vampire. Yes, a real bona fide vampire, fangs and all. I've always wanted to do a proper vampire story, I just never expected it to be this one.
Take his time? Okay, he could do that, breathing deeply to make sure that no more blood needlessly rushed anywhere. There was plenty of time for rushing later, apparently.
Rubbing his towel across his hair, he took a quick glance across to where Sherlock was sitting, preoccupied with his drink and snack bar. Wherever Sherlock’s mind had been in that first set, it was now very firmly back in the match and didn’t John’s arms know it.
This was where it was going to happen, he realised as he stepped over the threshold. In this room, on that bed, that was where they were going to have full, penetrative sex.
At no point had he ever thought that a blunt, “Oh, good, you’re awake,” from his already conscious male partner would instantly have the day shooting high up his list of best birthdays ever. And the day had only just begun.
Sherlock, for once, was seated properly in the armchair, fingers pressed together as in prayer, chin resting on his thumbs.  Behind him, the current game from the Arthur Ashe Stadium continued on mute, the players bordering on comical as they ran to strike the small yellow ball.
Sherlock found more scars, on the chest, on the hip, small, thin, almost invisible, but perceptively there against his lips. He traced the muscles, the shape of the doctor’s pecks, the strength in his arms. Then there was the penis, swollen and upright in arousal, of good size and girth within the upper tiers of average, but so obviously
