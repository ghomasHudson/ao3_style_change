Instead of trying to move, he lay still, curled on his side in the corner with shattered knees dragged up to his chest and both wings tucked behind him, as if he could shelter them somehow.
It got inside him. The spell wormed into him. It snaked around every nerve, plucking them like chords, and it took everything in him not to scream as magic that shouldn’t even exist clawed to the base of his grace and ripped, burning colder than hellfire, right through his true form until it reached the piece of him it wanted and pulled out. He couldn’t hold the scream in anymore and he wailed as the spell lifted fragments of his body into the air.
Crowley smirked, a pleased and smug expression on his oh so slappable face. “I knew you’d come around.”
A familiar weight pulled down on Gabriel’s wrists. Chains. Cold, heavy, and carved through with Enochian sigils. He hadn’t been bound in warded chains since the first few centuries with Asmodeus, before enough of his grace had been drained to leave him powerless, because at that point he didn’t need physical chains. Fear had bound him, wound taught around his whole body, too tight to escape.
The demon set the tray down and toed it closer to Dean. Dean glared into the bowl. It looked like some sort of oatmeal paste, but mixed with ground up meat chunks inside of it. It looked horrible, but his stomach snarled anyway, and Dean remembered how hungry he was. His disgust faded away, but he still took a moment to prod through the mixture with the provided plastic spoon to look for anything dangerous, like pills or broken glass.
One of Sam’s hands vanished, returning with the point of a blade following the lines to slice into his skin, but he didn’t just cut. He carved. The knife edge slid under his flesh and gouged off thin strips of meat.
Hopefully those exhausted idiots would actually sleep instead of doing literally anything else, but just in case, when Sam got to his room, he dug around in the top drawer of his nightstand till he found a pair of disposable earplugs. Even though he and Dean were used to the sound of gunshots by now, he still kept them around out of habit, and out of the hope that he could keep himself from losing his hearing before age fifty.
Dean laughed, but the sound only crawled out of his throat, a dull, mirthless echo, alongside a smile that didn’t reach his bloodshot eyes. “No, that’s no problem at all. I’ve mostly been into women, but there’s been a few men that I just can’t help but find attractive. Dr. Sexy was my first man-crush. I’ve experimented a bit, but not much. I never told anyone, didn’t want Dad to find out.”
When Crowley arrived at the Men of Letters bunker, he found the door ajar. He adjusted his grip on his blade and held it ready as he nudged the door further open. It creaked, groaning on its hinges, and red light flickered around its frame.
The demon laughed. “I thought archangels were supposed to be tougher than that. Oh well, I’m not here for you anyways.”
Dean had been hesitant at first. If he tortured a demon, he could be torturing the vessel too, but Crowley and Cas both confirmed that there was no human soul inside the demon’s body. Crowley offered to do the work himself, but Dean wouldn’t let him. Crowley would relish in torture, draw it out, and take up time they didn’t have. Cas offered next, but he didn’t have the kind of experience necessary to break a creature forged in the fire and agony of the Pit.
Cas glanced once again at the wall clock everyone had made it pretty much on time whereas Dean, Sam and Gabriel were still absent.
"Seriously you can't wait?" Gabriel shook his head in answer, gasping as Sam lifted him off the stool to carry him back to their bedroom.
Truthfully he had loads, but he hadn't told her that. Sure he loved to draw but it was just a hobby, his father had said even worse things. From then on they had regular twitter exchanges especially after realizing they shared a love for most fandoms with a lot of the same opinions.
"Hey, do you know where I can get a soft toy gnome?" at first Cas thought he'd misheard until he remembered Dean's reluctance to go near the gnomes at Hive.
"It's just Cas is too nice to tell you to leave, he's already wrapped around Henry's finger. I'm sure he's busy but no doubt has spent time with you guys."
"She's out, and I really should be heading off to meet her, I'll put your orders through the kitchen if you want." offered Bobby, Dean ordered his usual and Cas the same once he knew what that was, and after grabbing a couple of sodas from the guy (someone Dean didn't recognize) tending bar they chose a booth.
Sweeping his eyes down to Cas' lips made him realize it was only his voice that was stuck, it was with that thought his body reached forward until his lips were pressed against Cas'. Unfortunately, it was not the red hot passion of his dreams or fantasies but rather stillness, before Cas can hit him with worded rejection Dean runs from the apartment as quick as humanly possible.
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam smiles at the angel taking the present, revealing an assortment of shampoo cubes.
"The health nut?" Dean's attention moves from Cas to Sam since his brother seems to be choking on his water. "Sammy, are you sure that's water?" he jokes watching his brother recover.
Sam took the other side of the bench opposite Dean, "How did it all come out?" his brother asked his eyes down inspecting the gift, "Wait, you didn't send this."
"Uh yeah, I don't think I've done too badly." Dean gestured to his square bookshelves - mostly filled with books, photos and what Dean deemed too many pop figures that Charlie kept adding to - between his filing cabinets.
"Well, how can I say no to that." Dean felt happy having thought it would be harder to get Cas to agree, he leads him back to the car wishing he had Baby to drive. Damn Sam and his green attitude.
"Oh, go ahead," Dean waves his hand at Sam to shoo him away before pulling Cas closer quickly pressing their lips together in a proper greeting.
"I wanted to start a veg garden but I need some help, I might pick his brain." the fact that Henry's little garden was bringing Cas business made Dean really happy. He downplayed it of course, he didn't want to be seen as a sap or something.
Sam sighed, "You got this Dean, just relax and be yourself." yeah because a High School dropout has high chances of ensnaring someone older and sophisticated like Cas. "Let me know how it goes, the PG parts anyway." Sam teases as someone knocks on his door.
Oh My God! It looks and smells divine, the bun is charcoal black with the Death Star design imprinted on the top, inside is a thick beef patty topped with rich BBQ pulled pork and luckily no frigging salad.
“No, I think Cas spoke to Gabriel though,” commented Sam without looking remotely annoyed by being left out of the loop.
Once Baby was parked, Dean felt unsurprised when Cas bolted out of the car sticking him with the tree, luckily Sam arrived to help.
They were sort of at an impasse, he never noticed at first but every few days after her coming over he found something new. Not wanting to encourage her by mouthing off rather choosing to ignore it (the unicorn, however, had gone straight to Goodwill). "Uh, Sammy I've got to go," says Dean moving to gather everything up (Cushion, literal flag, magnets, pens) which would be easier with two hands.
"Sam, he wants you to be happy we both do." of course they did, the whole be happy Dean wasn't anything new no doubt they were a month away before they got t-shirts with #TeamDean. He takes a slice of pizza as a way to prolong his answer, fucking meat feast is delicious. It's even better when Sam isn't around laying it on thick that it's a slice of death.
"Police!" well about time, Dean recognized Officer Jody Mills (from his wilder days) and another he didn't. "Drop the weapon." the man released the paperweight, it fell to the floor with a dull thud. "Hanscum, cuff him." Jody directed her blonde partner, keeping her gun on the man.
Dean was regretting one decision out of a sea of many, days after surviving Bobby’s pep talk he waited for the words to pass through his thick skull along with his own words of encouragement.
"Because you're going to make him laugh," clarified Gabriel, "He can't be mad if he laughs, house rules." Damn, that was smart, Dean really needed to remember that one.
"Oh man, this is awesome. Thanks, Cas, I haven't been in ages." not since before Henry he remembered, life had gotten too busy but maybe this could become a tradition and a way to educate Henry on proper cars.
"No, why would you ask that?" Henry just shrugs before resuming to eat his dinner and leaving Dean feeling very small at the bottom of a really big hill.
Even through the dark, he can see how trashed the place is: his foot keeps colliding with plant pots, the scent of earth carries in the air. Hopefully, the destruction would have given Cas time to grab a weapon or hide.
Dean chortles clumsily, still dodging both men’s gazes. “Nope. Nothing.” With one long pull, he finishes the beer and chucks it into the trash. “C’mon, let’s get this party started!”
Does the guy not realize how gorgeous he is? Whoever gave Cas the impression that he’s not a bona fide Apollo better not meet Dean in a dark alley in the future. When Cas looks up again, his expression is a weird cross between curious and smug.
for fucking porn. Gorgeously flushed, long, and thick, it strains proud and straight toward the divot of his bellybutton with Cas’ elegant fingers spread around the base in a tempting V.
So Castiel swallows thickly around the words, rests his head against the window. Breath gently fogging the cool glass, he lets his eyes slide shut and consciousness fade.
He’s cut off by another hard kiss, far more desperate this time. Dean’s palms cup Cas’ face, and Cas’ hands fall to his hips, pulling their bodies flush and he feels so fucking full in this moment, so much so he could burst with the intensity of it. He breaks away panting, eyes flitting between Cas’ glistening eyes and spit-slick, swollen lips, and fuck if they were alone in the bunker he’d drop to his knees right here in the middle of the kitchen just to show Cas exactly how much he appreciates this surprise.
“I'm glad to have met you, too, Dean. I'd like to—um—” Cas pauses, shifting on his feet, mouth twitching like he can’t decide what to say, or doesn’t know the right words at all. His face draws blank as he decides, and his entire posture changes, going kinda rigid. “Thank you for the drinks.”
Dean strides through, eyes darting around the room as though he’s looking for something. He frowns at the empty room, glancing again at Castiel before quickly looking away and placing the tools on the table beside the window. There’s tension in the line of Dean’s plaid-covered shoulders (
It’s an uncommonly resigned sound, coming from him. His older brother will never admit it, but Castiel knows him better than anyone. The snarky facade is just that; a mask, one he’d donned when they were kids, and rarely let slip. Beneath all the sass and hedonism, Gabriel
There’s Sam, who he considers his other half in a lot of ways and knows him better than anyone. But even with his brother, Dean’s always had to play a role. Parent, guardian, teacher, big brother, and pretty much in that order. Hard as Sam tries to get him to open up, talk about his “feelings”, he can’t. Not to the extent Sam wants, because to do so would lay bare all his insecurities and, worse than that, all his guilt. Guilt he holds for resenting his brother when Sammy did literally nothing to deserve it.
it’s right on his prostate like this and every upward shift rubs his cockhead against the satin and lace and his legs are on fire, he’s not gonna make it, he’s too close— “Gonna… gonna come, Cas,” he begs, voice rough and fucked-out, “please, please can I come?”
against the tile. She clears her throat. Frustrated, she finally skirts around him, squeezing through the narrow gap but it’s too close a call and the rung where big items sit scrapes noisily along the bottom edge of the freezer door, dragging Dean out of his stupor.
He feels every inch of his body so starkly in these moments. Denim bunching around the crevice where thigh meets pelvis, soft cotton and flannel around his shoulders, tepid South Dakota summer air rustling through the hair on his naked forearms.
Cas’ mouth curves at the edges—not quite a smile, but close enough. Then he bends down to the cases he still needs to sort, a clear enough signal that the conversation is over.
Dean peers through the windshield as he turns off the ignition and smiles at Cas’ concentrated frown. He’s focused intently on counting the register, putting the last of that day’s cash into the zippered envelope which gets deposited in the office safe before it’s dropped off at the bank. Pocketing Baby’s keys, Dean makes his way to the door, rapping his knuckles on the glass.
“Can I do anything?” It doesn’t feel right letting others do all the work. Castiel needs to feel useful, to know he’s not merely a burden.
Dean walks into the garage that day with his face nearly aching from the grin stretching across it. It’s not until midway through his shift he realizes he didn’t ask for Cas’ number… or that date.
“I can't go into battle without my handmaiden again! The Kingdom of Moondoor needs our combined strategic expertise to win back the territory we lost to the Shadow Orcs last month. So no excuses this time, capisce?”
Dean’s heart squeezes in his chest, tears gathering at the corners of his eyes the way they always do when he talks about Mary. He briefly closes them and sighs.
“Do you honestly think you can go through life like that, Dean? Just—what? Drink half a fifth a night and you’re good?”
As though reading his mind, Dean looks over his shoulder again, says, “Ain’t gonna hurt me Cas,” and bites his lip. Then he bucks back and
, would look so good sliding down him that the very thought makes him groan, tighten his grip and stroke faster, faster, edging toward the precipice, pressure coiling in his groin like a rubber band stretching taut. What shapes would Dean’s perfect pink lips make if Castiel pinned him against this wall, spread his cheeks, and fucked that tight, pretty ass with his tongue? He’d make him beg and whine and writhe and plead for his cock, for his touch, make Dean cry out his name as he takes him, splits him apart and puts him back together atom by atom, claims him as
He chuckles. “Not at all. I think it’s… cute.” The cup hovers beneath his nose, hiding his cheeky smile, but before Dean can respond he gulps it down and shoves his cup back into Dean’s hand.
“I was thinking maybe we could hang out in my room? I mean, since my TV is up here already, and I have Netflix… we can watch a movie or somethin’? If, uh, if that’s something you’d wanna do. You know. With me.”
“I know what you’re thinkin' and she’s fine. Had Joanna drive her home while you were dead to the world. But don’t you try to change the subject,” she says, wagging a finger at him. “I haven’t seen you like that since—”
Gaze downcast, he shoves his hands in his coat pockets and takes a nervous step forward, a dozen eyes burning into his skin. The sensation brings him back to age thirteen; they’d moved cities after his father purchased a publishing firm there and enrolled the boys in a prominent private boarding school. He recalls the tension boiling in his stomach, the sweat on his palms as he’d crammed them into his pockets much like now and, staring at his feet, entered the building full of unknown faces for the first time. His home for the five years that followed...
It’s the weekend; Dean’s chore day. He’s done his rounds on the tractor they found stashed in the unattached garage (which he’s started parking Baby in most days and has enough space for three more vehicles even with all the equipment in there. He’s sorely tempted to convert the building into a mechanic’s dream, but that project is gonna have to wait), tended to the acreage that isn’t heavily forested, and is now chugging an ice-cold beer in the kitchen with a full view of Cas doing yoga.
“Maybe. I don’t know.” Pouting, his eyes search the floor as though there’s a straightforward answer built into the grout lines in the tile. He traces one with the toe of his boot and shoves his hands in his pockets. “You know how I am with... relationships. What if I fuck it up? It’s… it’s too complicated.”
Dean’s heart wasn’t in it, not the way hers was. There was too much shit he couldn’t let go of, too many pieces of himself he simply couldn’t give her.
Maybe it’s the heat that gets to him. Maybe work’s stressing him out. Maybe it’s that he hasn’t been laid in a few months and watching Cas walk past him in those tiny running shorts and
Tuesday evening after work, freshly showered and smelling so delectable it takes all Castiel’s willpower not to devour him on the spot.
“You’re incredible,” he blurts. Then feels himself blush, embarrassed by the outburst. "What you do for the people here, I mean. It's amazing."
“Yeah. Payments quit comin’ in, and Bobby said your dad stopped calling. Didn’t know why. Figured he gave up on the place or something.” Dean shrugs. “I still went by every once in a while to mow the lawn and shit, but after my business took off and we hadn’t heard from Chuck in a couple of years…” he trails off. “I’m sorry.”
Dean reaches behind himself with one arm and yanks his own shirt over his head before sitting on the bed, scooting back to lie on the pillows. He tries his damndest to give his most sultry
“Let me hear you, sweetheart,” Cas gently orders, the desire in his voice palpable. He knows Dean has misgivings about being noisy in the bedroom but makes a point to draw every last gasp and moan from his lips anyway, intent on breaking down Dean's walls with such tender, patient baby steps. “You're going to be so tight for me, so hot,” he continues. “Push in one finger now, dragging against the rim with your knuckle as you go. Slowly. Slide it in and out, tugging and pulling, loosening yourself up until you're ready for a second finger.”
Their bodies are inches apart, the heat emanating from both of them near sweltering, so close if Dean took a deep breath their chests would brush and when Cas finally speaks again it's in a steady, careful, low smolder.
Clearing his throat, Dean glances at Cas to gauge his reaction, but it seems he’s already more invested in studying the daily specials menu written on the blackboard above the serving hatch in thick multi-colored chalk. They both order burgers and cokes and soon after delivering their drinks, Missouri wanders off holding a fresh pot of coffee to make her rounds.
Castiel holds his hand out over the table. Dean cheerfully accepts it, clasping his second hand over their linked ones and fuck, a simple handshake shouldn’t give him such a thrill but it does. The smile Dean offers him is exhilarating, his voice laced with promises Castiel can’t begin to analyze as his focus narrows down to the sensation of Dean's strong, capable fingers against his.
Pulse thrumming in his ears, head splitting in two, he drags himself upright despite the protesting muscles of his back and dangles his legs over the side of the bed. He’s not a hundred percent sure how he got home and is still in the same t-shirt and jeans as yesterday, but the brain fog is still strong enough for him not to care.
Sam glances between them both for an oddly long, scrutinizing moment before letting the guy’s hand go and busting out a giant grin. “That so?”
“Don’t,” he snaps. Then, ashamed, his eyes immediately dart the floor. “It’s nothing, don’t worry about it.”
Pouting and picking at the label on his beer, Dean’s startled by a light touch on his forearm, right below his rolled-up sleeve, and realizes he’s been sitting there brooding silently long enough to worry Cas.
He pops the cap on the tube, relishing the shiver that crawls across the sea of skin before him at the sound, and pours a generous amount into his hand, warming it between his fingers.
Things get quiet and tense for a long minute. Cas’ fingers twitch around the bottle as his eyes flit between them above his nearly empty plate. “I’m... sensing awkwardness.”
Dating is a simultaneously awesome and terrible sorta torture, like an alternate universe where he’s served perfectly cooked Kobe every day but the craving for a disgustingly greasy bacon cheddar burger slowly wears away at him until it’s all he can think about and the steak turns to ash in his mouth.
Cas reaches for the liquor bottle, pours them each another two fingers, then gulps his down and slouches against the seat, mirroring Dean. He tilts his head back, resting it on the leather and wood as he mumbles, “My story...”
—Cas’ face. Then Sam’s, and Jack’s. Content, surrounded by the people he loves most in all the world, he blows the candle out.
On top of that, Charlie had been there soaking up the whole thing between fits of giggles and demands to meet the elusive “blue-eyed angel” (as Dean had unknowingly called him during his previous stupor at the same bar. Jesus, he’s a dumbass). He told them both to shut their traps and grumbled the rest of his disputes into a tepid, slightly stale lager.
Cas’ eyes shine wetly in the fluorescent stair light, the most breathtaking blue Dean has ever seen and the only color he thinks he’ll ever care about for the rest of his life. His cheeks are ruddy, blushing almost crimson and covered in the permanent shadow Dean’s imagined so many times scraping along his inner thighs.
, and he feels rather than sees Cas' smile trail down to press into the tender skin of his throat. They're in their own little world now, Dean and Cas, a world of their creation. And he's never been more sure of anything than in this moment.
Out on the bathroom counter, his phone rings, and reality hits him like a brick. He shakes off those thoughts and yanks back the curtain. Grabbing a towel, he wraps it around his waist as he steps down to the rug below, curling his toes in the plush, damp material.
?” Ash asks, probably one shot away from giving him full-on heart-eyes at the news. No wonder he and Charlie get along, the saps.
“Are… are you sure?” Cas pants above him, eyes glazed over, mouth hanging open. Christ, he already looks fuckin’
Dean spends the rest of the week catching up on his Netflix watch list, introducing Cas to shows and movies he’s never seen, and re-reads his tattered paperback copies of
“But what if I decide to stay here?” he says. He tosses back the final sip of his second beer. “What will you do?”
“Yeah, yeah Cas. Please. I want it, I want it so bad. Fucking come all over me, baby, mark me up and make me yours—”
“You see that?” Ash points somewhere in the general vicinity of Dean’s entire fucking face. “That little twitch? That’s his tell.”
Dean and Charlie embark upon a heated debate about which is the best Star Trek captain. Dean’s team Kirk, and Charlie’s team Piccard, Castiel has no idea what either of them are talking about, and from the sound of it, this is an argument they’ve exhausted on more than one occasion. When Dean’s arm ends up on the back of the couch behind Castiel’s head he feels dizzy with the urge to lean into him.
Screw Michael, Naomi, his father, and everyone who’s told him how to live his life, how to act, how to think. This time Castiel is going to listen to his heart because this?
By the end of the following day, though, both their stomachs were growling and Sammy was sitting up on the bed, quiet but clutching his stomach, fighting back tears and trying so hard to be strong. To be a good boy.
Cas stands in the doorway, dripping wet and beautifully flushed. His damp hair’s spiked in forty different directions, piercing eyes narrowed, a towel slung loose and low around his
Uncomfortable with the attention, he squirms a little, unable to think of a polite way to turn Meg down without either outing himself or hurting her feelings and making things awkward. He glances furtively at the man across from him, his gaze pleading.
A flare of frustration is visible in the set of Cas’ shoulders and tightness around his eyes. “Then what is the problem? Talk to me.”
Castiel has never been the talkative type, least of all around strangers. Yet despite having barely met, he feels oddly at ease with Dean. It's a familiarity bred not from time, but from what he supposes Gabriel would ascribe to "chemistry". Around Dean, Castiel can simply
“You’re right when you said the house needs work. It’s been a while but I’ve seen it inside and out and I got a rough guess of what needs done. Usually, the house jobs I do around here are small potatoes like, extending a porch or patching someone’s old roof, minor repairs. I enjoy it, don’t get me wrong, but I haven’t had a project like this in years. Besides, Cas, I want to help you.”
The two of them, here and now, skin to precious skin, with the blissful promise of tomorrow lying in wait… for now, this is enough. But the longing remains, stubborn and unyielding, and the very second Castiel thinks Dean is completely lost to the world of dreams—only then does he allow himself to acknowledge them aloud—low and soft, to the damp skin at the hollow of Dean’s throat. That’s where he presses one final kiss, and that’s when he whispers them, safe and secret between himself and the moonlight streaming through the curtains.
Both their mouths snap shut as they stare blankly at each other, parallel on the bed. The sheets are thrown askew due to his thrashing but neither of them are brave enough to allow their eyes to drift downward. Dean’s face colors, his heart racing. Thudding so loud he’s sure Cas can hear it.
“Offer?” Dean mimics Cas’ posture, one elbow on the counter facing him. He rests his jaw in the propped hand and lets the other settle on his thigh. Cas looks so serious, like he’s about to make him a business proposition.
After a minute that stretches on for an eternity, the gorgeous stranger’s hooded eyes slide from Dean’s down to his lips, and he licks his own, real slow.
.” He pivots on his heels and storms away, the sound of the front door slamming shut replaying through Dean’s mind for hours after.
Still reeling and a bit lost in his own thoughts, Castiel croaks the first thing that pops into his mind. “Water.”
Dean’s brow wrinkles and mouth twists like he’s just smelled something foul. “No offense, but your brother sounds like a real douchebag.”
“Tease your right nipple. Rub and circle and pinch. That's my mouth, Dean, licking and sucking and biting your beautiful freckled skin. I bet it's flushed such a pretty pink for me right now, isn't it?”
He stretches, eyes closed. Leisurely locking both hands high above his head with a husky and contented groan, his plaid shirt flaps open as the breeze wisps across the exposed softness of his belly, just above the leather belt where his faded Black Sabbath t-shirt has ridden up. Cracking one eye open, he finds Cas watching him and can’t tell if it’s a blush on his cheeks or a shadow cast from the streetlight above. Dean lowers his arms and self-consciously straightens his clothes.
The hand on Dean’s hip finds its way to his hair, grasping the strands at the top where they’re longest. “Like this?” he growls, tugging Dean’s head back and forcing his spine into an exquisite arch.
“Yes, really. I mean”—he gestures vaguely at Cas’ entire body—“look at you, dude. Fucking sex on legs.”
Held down by his hip, Dean twists the plastic stirrer between forefinger and thumb, and a lingering droplet of coffee splashes onto the toe of his boot. Stepping forward into Cas’ space, his nose captures a pleasant scent—soap, or maybe aftershave. Something sharp yet earthy and clean. Reminds Dean of petrichor, the aroma of dew clinging to the moss and leaves and delicate petals scattered across a forest floor the morning after a tepid rainstorm. It suits the guy, somehow.
Asmodeus shook his head. “What bold words for the man who burned up Gabriel’s wing and shattered his knees and tore him apart with glee in every possible way.”
If only Cas could numb the pain of Dean’s guilt. No matter how many times he tried to assure him that the Righteous Man had to spill blood in Hell, Dean never forgave himself.
“Yep, feeling much better, Samshine. By the way, don’t bother asking for your clothes back, I own them now.”
Sam pulled together enough resolve to manage a glare. “Someone screwing up isn’t an excuse to torture them.” Yes, Gabriel had gone above and beyond ‘screwing up,’ but Sam still stood by his point.
He could be coming down with something, actually. That would explain why he’d been having constant headaches for the past few days.
With the gun raised and his finger hovering deathly close to the trigger, Sam ascended the stairs. He shooed Miracle away, and the dog padded off to sulk in Dean’s room. Sam took a breath and yanked the door open. Oh shit.
He knew Hell by its smells. Fire and brimstone clogged with the odors of charred flesh, coppery blood, and thick sulfur.
On one wing, blue hellfire and blue grace ripped through golden feathers, snapping and bending them as the fire burrowed deeper in to char his flesh back. His skin bubbled and peeled apart to expose his bones.
He didn’t give Alastair any time to recite his usual speech; always the same, a string of insults and threats and reminders of all the horror he’d done in Hell, not because he had to, but because he wanted to.
They’d go back and forth, sometimes, with Cas trying to convince him and Dean refusing, as stubborn as ever. Sometimes Cas dropped it after the first few pleas, and Dean filled the silence with rambles of any and every other subject.
Asmodeus approached with a sickening grin. He grabbed the edge of one wing and pulled, ignoring Gabriel’s cries as he stretched it as far open as it could go in the confined space. He shouldn’t be touching it. No one should be touching it. The wing spread out longer than Gabriel’s height, though it still had more length that could reveal itself if he had more room to stretch out or if his gilded feathers weren’t slicked in thick blood matting them together in frayed tangles.
He knew that much. Touch didn’t have to hurt. There wasn’t exactly a pain requirement for physical contact. But in Gabriel’s experience, touch did hurt. Not because it had to, but because it wanted to. Because the people who got close enough to touch only ever wanted to hurt him, even when they pretended otherwise.
And yet, those moments of communication passed, and Cas would lapse into total silence. Asleep, Dean hoped. Dead, Dean feared. Dean would sit against the wall, waiting, counting the intermittent taps of water from the leaky pipe hitting the ground behind the wall. But no matter how many times he thought it was really the end, Cas had really died this time because no one could take that kind of pain, hours or days or eons would pass and he’d hear Cas again.
Sam’s breathing sped up more and more with each passing second to the point of hyperventilation, and to calm himself down he forced himself to think rationally, breaking everything down like the steps in a mission. Just a hunt, he told himself, just a misadventure during a hunt.
Sam slept through the night, for once. No violent visions or horrific nightmares woke him up. Instead, a hand on his shoulder did.
“Dean?” Cas swallowed and shuddered at what might’ve been the bitter taste of his own blood in his mouth. “Are you really here?” He struggled to lift his head, turning to stare over his shoulder.
“Hmm. We’ll just have to wait a little longer, then, until either an opportunity presents itself for escape, or Sam arrives, sent by Crowley, to find us and get us out of here. Whichever one comes first.”
From the middle of a summoning circle, tied to a chair, a demon hissed. “I’m not telling you anything,” she snarled, baring her vessel’s teeth. Crowley had summoned her with a spell; apparently she was one of Abaddon’s most loyal, and the perfect choice for trying to get information out of, since she was one of few demons who knew Abaddon’s plans.
She returned her eyes to her vessel’s copper color so Dean could see it when she rolled them. “Wow, how original, never heard that one before.”
If not for the constant threat of pain, Cas would let himself relax completely, lulled into a sleep-like state where he could just close his eyes and pay attention to nothing more than Dean’s presence. His hands, the sound of his breath, his scent (which would be pleasant in other circumstances where Dean hadn’t been covered in sweat and blood.)
He’d only left the room when Claire kissed Kaia, because seeing two people kiss just made him think of Cas, and how he could’ve had something like that with Cas if only he’d been a little braver. He’d excused himself, awkwardly, and mumbled something about how he needed to take a shower cause he smelled horrible.
Years ago, he’d never have done that. He’d take it in stride, crack some witty joke, make a flirty comment. His old mind even tried to think of a few sassy remarks, stuff about Sam being hot enough to burn him, or not realizing Sam was into bondage. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t bring himself to make a joke, say something just for the sake of saying it, or hold out against pain with a wicked smirk and a trick or two to get out unharmed.
Sam swallowed. Choosing not to tell Crowley that Rowena had died by his hand, Sam said, “She died fighting, but then she became the Queen of Hell.”
The position of the forks pushed the head up, forcing the victim to look towards the heavens. Heretics, those who didn’t believe in God, were the tool’s prime victims.
Asmodeus approached a shelf along the wall, lined with boxed filled with various torture implements, all locked away, otherwise Sam might’ve tried to use something in there to fight his way out. Asmodeus unlocked a box and took out an object Sam wished he didn’t recognize.
After lap fourteen, fingernails dragging along the wall and worn down too far, Sam stopped. He lifted his hands, holding them in front of himself. In the low light, the blood looked like ink, but he could still smell it, heavy with iron and another, sharper smell he’d come to associate with angel grace.
A grin split Ruby’s red lips. Her eyes gleamed deep, glossy black, glittering onyxes reflecting the flashes of lightning outside the window. “What are we waiting for, then? I’ve got a lot of things I wanna do to that bastard, Azazel.”
Dean resisted his urges. So gave him a look that said, “You idiot,” and closed the distance himself. Dean tasted the blood on Cas’s tongue and couldn’t bring himself to give a damn, because it was Cas, and it didn’t matter if the kiss was imperfect, in the wrong place at the wrong time, Dean just appreciated that he could have it, and he never wanted to give it up.
“You don’t have to say any more, talking after you’ve had one of those things in hurts like a bitch. How long did that bastard leave it on you? Rhetorical question, I don’t need to know.”
“We just wanted to be left alone,” Adam sighed, “but Michael says that he owes a lot to Gabriel and Castiel. There’s some wrongs he needs to right. And I guess it wouldn’t hurt to see my brothers again. So if you need us, we’re willing to help.”
Sam punched the wall. His knuckles popped from the force and he felt something crack. He punched again, again, again, over and over, both hands ramming into the concrete. His bones snapped from the force of his strikes and rolled under his skin, shooting him with pain.
No one bothered them, or even noticed them, as they stuck around, potionioning cameras into the windows. No one at all. Which, for a building full of demons, didn’t seem normal.
At least the weather gave her an excuse to walk in treading water off her clothes and onto the floor, cold puddles slicking sticky alcohol-stained flooring. Most of the bar’s patrons had the same problem, water pouring off their drenched bodies, chilled by the icy torrent flooding from the black sky.
“You’re gonna burn Gabriel. Here, you’ll need this special-made blowtorch.” Metal clinked in Sam’s hand. “This should be similar to how the angel’s wings burned up in the fall, but not an exact replica. It’s the best we can do without the angel tablet,” Asmodeus told him. Gabriel shivered. “It’s designed to burn with hellfire, not regular fire, so it’ll do some real damage if you hold it in place long enough.”
Finally, someone out there answered Gabriel’s prayer by allowing the words to soothe him into sleep. His eyes were already closed, but the rest of senses faded out. He stopped registering sound and smell, and eventually pain. He felt the warmth pulse against his head, the last thing he noticed before he drifted into silence.
For the first time, the nightmare forced him to feel real pain, and his eyes snapped open. He scrunched in on himself and screamed just once before remembering what would happen if he dared use his voice. He clamped his jaw shut and flinched into the same warmth from earlier, before realizing its source.
Cas turned his head to look over his shoulder. He squinted at the demon, then, forgetting the shock collar, said, “Meg?”
“Fear not, Squirrel, I’m thinking of a way to stop her without that pesky Mark, but I’ll need some assistance.”
“Cas? Cas, hey, what’s wrong?” Dean shouldered Alastair aside and ran to Cas’s side. “Cas, what--” Dean’s brow furrowed. “Is this a fucking shock collar?”
Cas sighed. “Consumption of alcohol does nothing for me.” Well, that wasn’t entirely true. It would have an effect on him, but he’d have to consume inconceivable amounts of alcohol, such as breaking into a liquor store and drinking every single bottle on the shelves until he ended up with a violent headache.
Cas sat up and stretched. He shrugged the blankets off his shoulders, and Dean stole a glance at him. Dean had convinced him not to wear stiff, filthy clothes to bed, and he lent Cas some of his own clothes, a Led Zeppelin t-shirt and pajama pants. Without his trench coat and business formal attire, Cas looked almost like a different person. Softer, rounded off at the edges. At ease.
But at least his wings were still attached. That was about as good as they could be at this point, dislocated, burnt, bleeding, and half torn from the base.
Why? Where were they, how did they get here, and why did Sam have Gabriel’s blood on his skin? And why, why did Gabriel look so frightened, trembling hand enough for his teeth to chatter. What happened, what…
Sometimes Cas would just name a restraint or torture device, knowing Dean would recognize it. Gossiper’s violin. Vice. Thumbscrews. Prayer cross. Whip. Rack. Stork. Pear of anguish (in the throat, he assured him, not… anywhere else.)
“Bite me,” Sam growled, straining to keep the tremor out of his voice, but he couldn’t completely disguise the pitched, pained edge lining his words.
“They haven’t hurt me,” Dean said, leaving ‘physically,’ unspoken. “What about you? I’ve been on a rack before, I know how much it hurts.” Cas didn’t answer, contemplating just how much to tell him. “Come on man,” Dean urged, “talk to me. I could hear you from over here, I know they hurt you. How bad is it?”
He opened the kit and dumped everything out, sorting through bandage rolls, suture needles, antibiotic spray, a cloth and rubbing alcohol, bandaids, and butterfly strips. He’d have to make due with what he had. Dean would’ve liked some burn cream for the electrocution burns on Cas’s neck, but he hadn’t even expected this much, so he couldn’t risk asking for more.
And Gabriel was no exception. How many times had he died (but not really) until he’d finally stayed dead? How many times had he left a false corpse behind just so he could run away and let someone else deal with whatever problems he’d gotten loosely involved in?
(Yes, they, because Jack came to understand that they didn’t have an attachment to gender, and though he didn’t mind the ‘he’ pronoun, he liked ‘they’ too.)
Asmodeus once cracked open his ribcage from the back and lifted out his lungs, resting them like folded wings on his back.
“His grace for one. Gotta find that damn syringe,” Asmodeus muttered, mostly to himself. “But Azazel learned a little trick some centuries back that I’d like to learn for myself. It has quite a few benefits.”
Sam’s breathing gained weight after a bit, now long and slow, the breaths of a sleeping man. Gabriel thought he could fall asleep himself to the sound, but every time he got anywhere close to unconsciousness, Sam would groan or shudder in his sleep, and Gabriel would jolt back to full wakefulness, speared through with too much adrenaline. It took hours for Sam to wake up, but when he did, he came to without hostility.
“It’s okay,” a rumbling whisper assured him. “I’m here, I’m here. Whatever it takes, I’ll protect you. Just rest, you’ll be safe soon.”
A rush of fear chilled him to the bone and his eyes watered, but at least the tears cleared his vision a little, streaking red and salty down his pallid cheeks. Without the blood in his eyes, he made out a dimly lit concrete cell, walls lined in rusty shelves stocked with… Sam swallowed. Stocked with instruments of torture he’d been forced to become intimate with. Blades, whips, meat hooks, thumbscrews, and others he didn’t even want to name, lest thinking of them cause them to come to life and leap off the shelves to dig under his skin and turn him inside out. Again.
Cas nodded, though Dean couldn’t see him. “So that’s what you said no to?” Dean had quite a talent for saying no. He resisted Michael, after all, and that took some serious willpower.
“Sorry,” Sam apologized yet again. “I shouldn’t have asked. I, um, I didn’t mean to scare you or anything. I just…” Sam pressed his palm against his forehead as if that could ease its aching. “I wish there was something I could do to help you. I did this to you, it’s not fair that you should have to handle the fallout on your own.”
Cas stiffened beneath the blade, tension spreading through his shoulders. Dean just wanted to drop the blade and rub Cas’s back instead, working out the tension and letting him relax, but he couldn’t. The knife weighed his hand down like a boulder, digging itself deep into Cas’s flesh until it stopped at bone, and when Dean made the first incision into glowing cerulean marrow, Cas’s back arched, his wings flared up, and he screamed.
A numb buzz ran through the limbs, fading with each passing second. When the feeling returned to his wings, he wished it hadn’t. They ached too badly to move.
Gabriel glanced in his direction, revealing little with his wide-eyed stare, but Sam made out the outlines of disbelief about the apology in his face, shadowed beneath all the trembling, pallid fear.
Cas grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled them closer so they touched chest to chest, arms lying over one another and legs tangled under the blankets, doomed to the fate of serving as a pillow for Miracle.
The ‘knee-splitter’ felt crude in his hands, a shoddy, splintered tool made of wooden boards, pointed metal claws, held together by screws he could twist to tighten the jaws till the tool bit down and crushed flesh and bone.
“That would be very kind of you, Fergus. In the meantime, I’ll take care of our new little friend.” Her voice rose several octaves as she doted on Miracle.
She wanted Sam, didn’t she? And if she wanted Sam, what did that have to do with Asmodeus hunting down Gabriel? Unless he’d dreamed that. He’d blacked out somehow, so he must have dreamed that, which meant… Asmodeus tracked him down, broke into the Bunker, abducted him and Sam, and now here Sam was, back in Hell, about to suffer once more, just because Gabriel couldn’t handle his shit.
“Yeah,” Sam assured him. “He’s better than okay, actually. So, ah, this is kinda trippy to think about since we basically raised the kid, but he’s God now.” Cas stared, stunned. “Right? It’s crazy. But yeah, so he became a sort of power vacuum and he started sucking in power, and he ended up absorbing Chuck, and Amara by extension, so Chuck is completely powerless now, and Jack took his place.”
“If you scream, I’ll get it over with and cut it out,” Ruby bargained, because that’s all demons knew how to do. Bargain. Make deals, manipulate people into surrendering far too much for far too little. But Sam had made too many bargains with demons in the past. All that his dealings with Ruby had gotten him was a one-way ticket to Hell, plus a severe, nearly lethal drug addiction on the side.
“They dragged me in here, didn’t they?” he groaned. “Dammit…” Sam wrapped his arms around his stomach and choked on a shuddering breath. “Oh, that hurts like a bitch.” He glanced over at Gabriel, who flinched. “But you’ve got it worse, don’t you? I-I’m sorry. I remember hurting you, but not clearly, I… I think they did something to me, controlled me somehow. I never wanted to hurt you. I don’t hate you. I’m sorry.” With that last apology, Sam’s voice broke and a few rogue tears snuck out of his eyes.
“Feathers is there too? My my, that’s interesting,” Crowley’s voice crackled from the speaker. “See, my sources claim that he’s been dead. Swallowed by the Empty, now that’s a way to go. Welcome back, angel, your survival is actually quite convenient. Alright, now that the whole family’s there, let’s get to business.”
Why would the demons break Sam’s hands? He wouldn’t be as effective at torture if he couldn’t use his hands.
And all around Cas, feathers. Charred, crooked, most of them missing, and the remaining ones had twisted into broken angles. Sam followed the line of the feathers curving up exposed burn scars and blackened bones, finally ending at Cas’s shoulders. Angel wings, he knew without having to think about it, because Sam knew what angel wings looked like now.
Rowena rested her elbows on the sticky table and folded her hands to rest her chin on them. “Hello, lad. Do you by any chance know who I am?”
“Lookie here,” said Abaddon, red curls shifting like fire in the orange light. “Looks like we’re having wings for dinner tonight.” She pulled a gun from a leather holster on her hip. “Night, angel. See you in the morning.” She fired, and Cas’s vision went red, then white, then black.
They were supposed to be Team Free Will, yet look at Dean, cracking under pressure already, about to torture the man he loved on a demon’s say-so with no way to break out or fight back.
Normally he didn’t hear much when someone went into Dean’s cell. Just a bit of shuffling around, probably tending to his human needs while he was unconscious. Dean didn’t sleep deeply though, so maybe they drugged him somehow to get him to sleep, because normally a mere footstep on the other side of the room would wake Dean up.
Sam sat up straight, aching spine stiff as a ramrod. If he had any blankets, he would’ve thrown them all off, but no one had given him any. Not even a jacket to pull over himself.
Oh, so they were starting the psychological torture now. Get him to believe that Sam wasn’t actually mad at Gabriel even though he should be, make him trust that Sam wouldn’t harm him, even though that was Sam’s job. Hunting and hurting and killing things that deserved it. Things like Gabriel.
Dean didn’t wanna get up. He had Cas sleeping beside him, head cushioned against Dean’s chest, and Miracle sleeping by his legs, with his snout draped over Dean’s knee.
Sam stood up. He pulled a folding knife out of his pocket and flicked it open. Do Winchesters ever not have a weapon?
“ I had to make a deal with that asshole,” Sam pointed his thumb at Asmodeus, who scowled. “I don’t get to leave, but anything I do to you, he won’t do to me, so long as he gets to watch. Y’know I was really considering just taking the pain myself, I gave you a chance. If you’d just apologize, I wouldn’t touch you. But you didn’t.”
Cas couldn’t say anything, and even if he could it would’ve been muffled by his shaken sobs, so instead, he ran a trembling finger across Dean’s lips, then leaned in and silenced him with a kiss.
Later that day, Asmodeus came in to torture him instead of Sam, whipping his burnt wing. The next day, Asmodeus peeled the skin off the bottoms of his feet.
Cas gave him an odd look. Is that really all he noticed from that? Not that Dean had a favorite knife in the Pit, not that he tortured countless agonized souls and liked it, but that he’d named a knife after his car.
She materialized from the smoke, a hazy blend of black hair and a gas mask covering her face, but Gabriel didn’t need to see her vessel’s face, he could see past that, beneath the stolen human skin where he could make out the black and gray threads of her true form, horned and fanged and covered from teeth to tail tip in tiny bat wings. A demon. A very, very old one, with none of her original soul left. If the eyes are the window to the soul, no wonder demons eyes were as black as the Empty.
Cas huffed a laugh. “No, Dean isn’t reckless enough to start a kitchen fire, though he does come close.” The humor flicked out of his eyes like a light turned off, and Sam felt his heart squeeze in his chest. “It would appear my survival isn’t the only strange occurrence. Dean just got a call. From Crowley’s number.”
Then Dean tilts his head just right, the moonlight silhouetting the long line of his neck, bared and presented like it’s meant for Castiel’s lips. Laying a string of kisses from the bolt of Dean’s jaw to the point where his pulse beats a rhythm against the skin below his ear, he latches on hungrily, nipping and sucking.
“Okay. Well…” In his periphery, he sees Cas' eyes dim, the edges of his mouth downturned. “It was great to see you again… Take care of yourself, Dean.” Cas backs away, gaze lingering for a long, agonizing minute before he rounds the corner and disappears from view.
Dean knows he brought it on himself, having spent a few hours at Harvelle’s polishing that bottle off after Cas left (well, until Ellen cut him off and forced some water down his gullet), but fuck if he will admit that out loud. Story of his life, really. Always keeping everything in.
The boarding school didn’t improve his situation, either. Perhaps less isolated, since he went from living in large and nearly empty mansions wherever they’d moved to that year (save for his siblings and the few staff hired to maintain them) to dormitories, shared rooms, and crowded hallways. He made a few friends, excelled academically and in select sports and extracurricular activities, and got along well enough with his teachers. But it put distance between him and Gabe that neither of them adjusted particularly well to, fanning the flames of loneliness already existing within Castiel’s heart. Told him no matter what he attempted, there’d always be something lacking, some missing piece pulling at a thread in his mind, unraveling the quilt no matter how many pieces he added to it to blanket his feelings of inadequacy, of failure, of emptiness.
“Are you sure?” Cas whispers, leaning forward over the table as Ellen leaves. “I can pay for my drink, it’s—”
Hissing through his teeth, he massages the spot and replies, “‘m fine,” to Cas with a pained grimace while digging through the drawer. This kinda shit hasn’t happened since he hit puberty, and now it’s become a multiple-times-daily occurrence.
The clearing of a throat snaps him from that train of thought and back to the present. He's been staring.
Just when he thinks Cas isn’t going to reciprocate, Dean hears a thud, the crinkle of plastic, and feels a soft, tentative press of lips. Cas’ hands cup Dean’s jaw, fingers run through his hair, pulling him closer, the bag forgotten at their feet. An orange rolls out onto the dark, rain-spattered sidewalk, bumping Dean’s shoe. Ignoring it, he leans into the kiss, deepening it eagerly and tracing his tongue along the seam of Cas’ lips. They part, welcoming him inside, and he takes the invitation as a man possessed would, mapping out each warm crevice and pulling Cas closer with desperate fingertips digging into sharp hips. Cas’ mouth tastes of honey and tea and rain, herbal and salty-sweet, of time lost and the beautiful here and now.
By their third glass, Dean’s beginning to feel the buzz. Throat warm and slick like it’s coated in molasses, numb and tingling from the mild sting of the alcohol, head pleasantly fuzzy while he taps a beat with his fingers along to Bad Company playing over the bar’s speakers.
They clicked immediately, yeah, but he sorta thought that as the novelty faded, so would his infatuation. If anything, it’s gotten stronger as they’ve grown closer and now he's struggling to tune out the voice in his head that whispers "soulmate" every time he looks at those beautiful blue eyes.
And if Dean gets a little hard to the sensation of those thick thighs straddling his, and those strong, slender hands kneading every inch of exposed skin, well. Nobody needs to know but him.
A hot blush works up Castiel’s neck as what he’s implied hits him and more comes tumbling heedlessly out. “I meant, just sleeping, not sleeping with, of course—uh, not that you’re not attractive—” Castiel’s throat clicks around a harsh, too-dry swallow.
Eventually, he meanders into the kitchen to nab another beer. Cas takes pity on him with a long-suffering sigh and tentative, “Dean…”
And holy shit, it’s like a lightning bolt runs straight through his fingers into Dean’s. His hand is warm, smooth, and far softer than Dean’s calloused one, made so by a lifetime of manual labor. But it’s large and strong, too, and still rougher than a woman’s.
. A swell of love and gratitude floods through him and suddenly he wants nothing more than to hold his brother, to be held. To let loose the tears, have a drink with the man and reminisce about old times, as they are wont to do each time they reunite. Moments that seem more rare and fleeting as the years fly past.
“You two can make out later,” Alastair scoffed. “Dean, I didn’t bring you in here to watch you get all cuddly with your boy toy. Now pick that knife back up and cut his other wing off, or I’ll do it, and I’ll use a butter knife.”
Forced into lucidity, he faced the light with eyelids narrowed to slits. He nudged the blanket aside and pushed himself to try and sit up, then gave up and let himself lay still.
“Gabriel, can I touch your wings?” Sam regretted the question the second he asked it when Gabriel’s head snapped up and the little color left in his face blanched. “I’m not gonna hurt you, I just wanted to see the wounds. See if there was anything I could do for them, and maybe straighten some of those feathers for you.”
They looked so much smaller, now that he’d gained new power, like fireflies, yet no less dazzling, especially in numbers, where every individual spark united into a blaze.
“Hell,” Sam growled. “I went to Hell, and when I got out I spent years thinking about other people exclusively, but now I think it’s time I think about myself. You’d understand that, wouldn’t you? Only thinking about yourself?”
Sam gasped and tensed, but he wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of a scream. Pain clawed under his skin with the blade as Ruby cut him open. She slashed his skin, cutting through every layer, and peeled him open, exposing his blood and meat. His organs throbbed. Sam swallowed bile and closed his eyes.
Dean frowned. “Hey, do we know if Jack brought Michael back? He probably brought Adam back to life when he brought everyone back to life, but did he resurrect Michael too?”
But he’d only been able to access that ability once, how could he do it again? Well, Hell did fill him with terror and desperation and panic, so maybe that would be enough to spur powers that Sam barely knew he had, never mind control. And there was no guarantee it would even work. He had to try, though.
Gabriel glanced at Asmodeus again, watching with cold eyes and a colder grin. Sam grabbed his chin and wrenched his head so hard his neck popped.
Shit, shit… He’d have to fly what distance he could, and swim the rest. Gabriel entered a loop of lifting himself from the water, traveling as far as he could, and then falling back into the waves, panting and choking on saltwater. Eventually, he managed to make his way to shore, crawling up on the sand with frigid rain pelting him from above.
Gabriel gasped in pain, tears flowing down his face. Even if he could will himself to speak now, only muted sobs would escape.
“Pathetic,” Sam growled. “You’re so pathetic. You can’t even say you’re sorry for murdering my brother? Damn you to Hell… but I guess you’re already here. We’re both stuck here because of you.”
“Yes,” she started, drawing the word out, “but it’s complicated. See, several unsavory figures are also back from Empty. Demons abducted Dean and Castiel, and I fear the same is true of Sam and Gabriel. Two separate abductions, and I haven’t had much luck with either. When I sensed your grace I actually thought it was him at first.”
“I just thought of something. Michael said he can hear his siblings, yes? Well if he concentrated enough, could he hear their voices from all the way in Hell? Hear them, or sense their presence, something?”
Gabriel yanked the chair out to sit down, digging his fork into fluffy sweetness and melty chocolate. Not sweet enough though. “Do you have any syrup?” Gabriel asked with his mouth full. “Or some whipped cream?”
Cas peered through the fire. From the balconies above and edging in between buildings, demons swarmed off the streets. Doors opened, and more came out. Just how many forces had Abaddon amassed? Too many, evidently.
Sam dreamed that night, of a cold, dark room with no windows and no doors. Images flashed around him, distant and wavering, and only some of them came into focus, over-sharp, defining bright red blood and the shine of fluorescent light reflecting off a polished blade. A door slammed, a light blew out, and Sam stumbled around the room, pacing in circles around the walls, with one hand pressed into the concrete, leaving behind red smears where his fingers dragged by.
Ruby had been branded a traitor and a coward, even when that couldn’t have been farther from the truth.
“You’re outnumbered,” Cas said, trying to raise his voice above the noise. “Go home, get help, come back for me.”
The flickering lightbulb sent his shadows sprawling, warped and distorted by his broken fingers, shaping bent spider legs on the wall. Sam followed the shadows with his eyes, tears pouring down his face. He could barely breathe through the agony, breath catching in his lungs every time his body tried to sob, but that didn’t matter.
That was the moment he’d realized how far he’d fallen. When he started to crave certain aspects of torture. Fire gave him warmth, and beatings gave him touch. When he flinched but didn’t try to pull away, he spent about a decade in Hell-time trying to tell himself he’d given up, that’s why he didn’t pull away, because he’d surrendered to the suffering, no sense resisting.
This time, another image had invaded the nightmare’s blood and fire onslaught, punctuated by screams. Sam closed his eyes and breathed in through his nose, trying to keep himself calm long enough to separate one mass of bloody feathers from another until he finally grabbed hold of what he knew in his heart to be a premonition with no doubts.
Dean’s cell door slammed, and a moment later the door behind Cas opened. He turned around to face Dean, who refused to meet his eye and looked ghostly pale.
He tilted his head up to look at the city. Its lights pulled him, drew him forward. a beacon, like the moon to hatchling turtles, and he managed to stagger to his feet and take a few steps before falling back to his knees.
“Then you go--” Dean’s voice cut off when a demon rammed him from behind and slammed him into the ground, winding him. “Go,” he wheezed, words tensed and clipped as he struggled from under the demon. “Go to the bunker, get Sam--”
From what she’d heard, after her death, in a desperate attempt to save the world, Sam had said ‘yes,’ then overpowered possession long enough to throw himself into Hell, plummeting all the way to its dark, fiery core and landing in the Cage, where he spent a few centuries Hell-time suffering all kinds of horrific torture so severe that the aftermath had nearly killed him. She didn’t know the details, but what she wouldn’t give to find out.
Dean gave in, letting Cas hold him in place. He didn’t have to get up just yet. He could just lie here, let himself float, caught between sleep and wakefulness, grounded and yet free to hover in his own subconscious. Dean had spent plenty of mornings lying in bed, lacking the mental strength to get up, but now he could lie there, not out of pain, but out of peace.
Sam finished his coffee, then meandered back to the kitchen where he set the mug in the sink amongst a pile of other unwashed dishes and turned to the stove. Sam set a pan on the stove and turned it on. He got some eggs out of the fridge and cracked them into the pan to cook. Maybe he’d make an omelet, he hadn’t had an omelet in a while, but as Sam cooked, he tried to fold the eggs into proper omelet shape and--welp, looks like he’d be eating scrambled eggs instead. Sam finished cooking and transferred the eggs to a plate before he turned back to the stove. Sam picked up the pan to rinse it off in the sink. Then he dropped it.
Dean sat on a different seat finally realizing what else was bothering him, it wasn't just his feelings of insecurity, more that with Cas he wanted it all, this was as close as he ever felt to having to actually getting it.
"You could never bore me Dean." well alright then. "If you do need help though, one of my employees could help out, he's saving up before he goes to college, I could give him your number if you're interested."
This deserved framing, retying it Cas headed back to the counter so it wouldn't get damaged before reading the next clue.
"Dean, would you come in?" he smiled, "Now my brother has fresh gossip it won't be long until my more gossip inclined brother begins spamming my phone."
Shit! By the time his brain had triggered Dean was already moving rushing to push Cas through the door, he made it, however, he'd been outsmarted.
Once calmer Cas replied, "Not if you need to be taken care of, let's move this to the sunroom, can I get you something to drink?"
Yet it had been effortless, his friendship with Cas was easy the guy was awesome and Henry did love him, Dean quickly told her so. "Exactly if friendship is this good imagine what more could be like." she told him making him feel as if he'd been caught in her web.
"Yes, my pretty one," claims Cas in the voice that has Dean losing space in his pants. "And I think I ate your musketeers," added Cas sending Dean a smirk that told him he knew exactly what that voice was doing to him, the bastard. Gabriel looked personally affronted by the news of his eaten candy bars.
"You got me fucking fired!" he shouted followed by a crash, "Couldn't handle a little flirting so you cried harassment, yet you let Michael do as he pleased."  the familiar curl of curiosity flared under Dean's skin, who was Michael? Doing the equivalent of putting his foot down Dean shook himself, now really wasn't the time.
It took Meg a while to reach that level, not naturally she kept her water bottle filled with cheap vodka and swallowed it down with pills. The bell above the door pulled her from her thoughts straight into shock at the sight of Sam and Gabriel.
As ideas go this one hadn't been bad, just not forthcoming with the results. Spending the half hour since he got here walking around the different plants, hoping something would jog his memories of his Mom.
"It might take me a while to get it out, um Sammy and I grew up in Kansas, it was where our Mom died. Our Dad was never really the same after that, he drank a lot and..." Dean having dropped his eyes to start stole a quick glance at Cas, the man was giving his full attention to Dean that his eyes seemed to be burning. The sight made Dean want to look at Cas instead of the floor.
"True, though maybe we could watch something at mine on Netflix something new to both of us. I'd hate for you to be sitting next to me wishing you didn't have to watch the same thing again." Dean put his fork down (basically unheard of) to rub his neck, for a second Dean thought Cas had been suggesting a Netflix and Chill date. Though truthfully Cas probably didn't know what that entailed.
"I think we can just about manage driving her, you got a portfolio?" asked Jesse staring Dean down, wow these guys really took their cars seriously.
Opening the front door Cas was surprised to find Dean stood before him, "Dean, you're here," said Cas stepping back to let him in.
It didn't have to go beyond his being horny, no doubt any contact from someone beautiful would garner a response. And Dean could admit that Cas was beautiful.
Thirty minutes later found Dean in turmoil the steady ground beneath his feet traded for a choppy ocean in stormy conditions. Yep his boat was truly rocked. After agreeing with Henry, the three of them headed upstairs. Dean had wrangled Sam from the study - where he'd sneaked off to
"Uncle Sammy!" he squealed attacking the giant, thankfully Sam was still able to catch him, for the moment.
"Come on, you know my track record with relationships, I can't mess this up with Cas he's too important to me and Henry." God wasn't that obvious?
"So Henry how was the trip?" Cas walks around the table until he's in front of them immediately kneeling for Henry's sake. The action in no way makes Dean's heart jolt.
"Still nothing!" exclaimed Gabriel taking in the room, of course, he hadn't been expecting perfectly coordinated decor but he'd take a load of faulty lights over nothing.
"Oh you know around." he gestured wildly with his free hand, Dean looked up at his brother something was off. He was being all cagey, and oh my God was he blushing?
"You take me out on a date." Alfie asked loud enough that silence fell once again Meg was the exception.
Henry was eating dinner when it came, "Daddy, can we visit Cas at Hive on Saturday?" he'd been waiting for that question since he got home from his trip. Where in Henry's words it had been: "The bestest time ever with actual learning."
Cas was here! Dean blinked wanting to make sure, realizing Cas had never been here made him a little self-conscious. What would he think of the place?
"Maybe, I'll have to check with him first. So don't get your hopes up," warns Dean and just like that he has Henry's full attention.
"I had a fight with Sam," he tells her heading for a slice of pie, emotional eating is the worst but so is fighting with Sam. "He thought me and Cas were going on a date and got all uppity when I set him straight." he wanted to keep to the bare facts, not wanting to discuss his Dad right now.
"I'm back, it's Novak times two," shouted Gabriel just as Sam came back with the coffee, Kevin taking the beer for himself.
“Me too, they’re very important to Santa so need to be represented and look at all the tinsel and baubles!"
Noticing that Sam and Gabriel had departed too Dean attempted a pep talk. He could totally do this while being his usual charming self, the ladies loved him after all. For whatever reason, though he found guys harder, he stumbled and got all flustered so he didn't tend to bother as much.
Cas loved that classics, while Gabriel favored anything animated and Die Hard ended in a fight. Elf they were planning to watch again.
Daddy would hate a cuddly garden gnome, it was a good gift idea. Finally grabbing Chomps Henry walked (definitely walked) down the stairs finding his uncle not waiting by the door but looking at himself in the mirror.
"Dean, I don't care about any of that stuff okay. I just want you and your brother happy." John gets his word across with a strong shoulder grip.
Opening door Dean met disappointment in the form of his as good as little sister Jo, he didn't quite push away the dejected look quick enough with a smile.
Currently, he's inside grabbing dessert and in no way writing down his thoughts of the spices Cas used. Squirreling his note into a cookbook Dean places all of the pie on a tray along with what Cas brought before heading outside
"Absolutely, your drawings are beautiful they hold a raw energy I've not encountered before. If you're amenable I'd like to get together and brief you on my idea and see what you can come up with."
No way would his brother address Sam like that, which meant, "Shit! Blame Alfie and Benny for distracting me," he heard Dean answer before the line went dead.
"Trust me Cas, if this doesn't get him right where you want him, it's a lost cause." Bal smiled triumphantly.
Also, it explained the tension between him and Cas. It was clear now that Cas had wanted Sam to spill the beans about this place, so Gabriel wouldn't be hidden like a secret. What in the hell was going on between them?
Dean smiled back knowing he was blushing, "I didn't think you'd be this way, Oh God sorry that sounded so rude, it's just you're different." clarified Dean.
"Whoo, Cas wants to get his drink on! I've increased your flavor receptors and I'll be ready to grace up mistletoe in a tick,"
"Ah no Dean, I called to speak to you." oh, Dean felt a thrill of excitement at Cas' words. It felt good to hear the man's voice again. "Since we missed each other, I thought we could do the next best thing." suddenly Dean found himself smiling. It felt so effortless with Cas, their acquaintance was easy becoming a friendship and Dean found it pleasing.
"Sam was right earlier, Henry really is impressed with you. You're like his new hero, and you're real so it's an improvement." was that rambling, Dean had no idea what he was doing. "Can we just sit here for a bit?"
His mind went spiralling back to the time after the barbecue, how he’d touched his silk covered cock to thoughts of Cas.
"Yes we are, now cupcakes await," feeling bolstered Gabriel waltzed back into the kitchen happy to see all the ingredients weighed out ready for mixing.
"Cas brought them, just keep them away from mine and we'll serve them with these." he points to black and white napkins. "My burgers in black Cas can have the white, that way it'll be clear when I win." Benny nods his understanding before gesturing to where Cas is in deep conversation with Gilda and Kevin.
"Gabe!" moaned Sam his hips jerking as Gabriel sucked a very sensitive spot on his neck. At once Gabriel pulled back to kiss him, this time longer and sweeter than the last, before letting go.
Cas caught sight of Cesar who rolls his eyes fondly at their posturing causing Cas to hide his amusement behind his hand.
Waiting, he watched the noise register as Sam moved his impressive physique toward the sound his eyebrows moving high, "Gabriel! Wow, you're here too?"
“Dude! Are you crying?” asked Sam only to be more shocked when Dean couldn't formulate a response, Gabriel was quick to take over the conversation.
Cas' head popped up on hearing that, they weren't due to open for another half hour, meaning Gabriel wasn't here for leftovers it was rare for him to be up this early on a Saturday.
Dean could feel himself getting all warm from the praise, Cas standing so close wasn't helping either. He could feel all his practice words lodged in his throat, unmoveable, keeping him from what he desperately wanted.
Once everyone who's going is gone it leaves a handful of people (Benny included) in the kitchen when it happens. Cas had been tasked with grabbing a few beers out of the fridge for Dean, Gilda, and Gadreel.
Cas' head snapped up his face sporting his own confused expression, "Making room to plant the Red Velvet Yarrow." what? Did that make a lick of sense to anyone? A tugging on his jeans had him looking down to find Henry.
"Phew, that was close." sometimes his nephew had a love for the theatrics, Sam just raised an eyebrow at him. "Sorry I lied," he added ducking his head down, trying to look suitably chastised.
"Dean, I really want that too," moving forward but slower than before Dean reached out to Cas keeping his touch gentle Dean wrapped and arm around Cas' waist his other moving to his hair, God, it was so soft.
The trolley was mostly full of Christmas themed food and E numbers, looking down at his list Dean saw all that was left to get were the pecan for his spectacular Pecan Chocolate Chip pie, Ice cream and the vegetables, having left them last so they wouldn't get crushed.
"And Dean?" Sam wasn't sure he understood feeling to dazed to keep up. "Is that mean big brother making you keep secrets from me, Baby?"
A knock at the door announces his brother, "Yes?" Gabriel bounds through an obvious question in his eyes.
After having such a good time  -Dean was totally basking in all the good comments about Baby - the whole scene felt off. "Weird the door feels a little stiff," commented Cas mainly to himself but loud enough for Dean to hear and have everything click into place.
"Dean, I think you should put that down." Dean blinks forcing himself to look away from the hurtful sight to find Charlie in front of him (great this should make for an interesting Monday) hands out to take the tray.
"Well it sounds excellent to me, it could lead to a kids club maybe." Cas nods at him happily, before passing Henry his backpack. "So how did you get on?" Cas asks as Henry digs through he bag.
"You're getting heavy," Sam teased again the light didn't reach his eyes but Henry was glad for the attempt. "I'm sad because I really like Cas' brother Gabriel, but he's been hurt before by people he trusted. So I'm figuring out ways to show him how much he means to me," answered Sam.
"Thank you Cas! I've been wanting to talk to you all day, I've decided to go to college and I'm going to talk to Mom and Dad tomorrow." confided Dean.
What the hell was he meant to with his hands? Cas giggled making it obvious it was a thought loud enough to hear.
“I always pictured him to be a blabbermouth, guess he’s a big brother after all,” Dean's compliment had Sam smiling.
"Good evening, Hive Gardens." Dean sat down on the couch his eyes going wide and worry flaring in his stomach.
"Dean I wasn't displeased by the food, just surprised, happily surprised that you had gone to so much trouble, it's been a long while since anyone's done something like this for me and I fucking love sliders." Dean nods in understanding feeling good, Cas made him feel good and calm.
"Well I'll check things out," and oh shit, "Crap, I forgot to call him about a plant Henry was going on about." Dean grabbed the house phone ready to dial the number.
He suddenly felt fear that had nothing to do with being thousands of miles in the air and more about making a fool of himself. Shit, he had just taken half the pill Ash have given him, it was supposedly Valium but it who knew where Ash had gotten it from.
"Well our parents did name us after angels, you've no need to worry Dean, looking like you do he'll do more than keep you safe if you ask."
After a good look Dean pulls himself away from imagining bringing Cas here, spreading themselves out in the reading corner to find Charlie gone. It doesn't bother him so he heads over to the fiction area, now he's made a decision he feels planted. Knowing Cas is a reader of factual titles when it comes to his love of bees Dean hopes a novel won't be amiss. He scans the shelves eyes searching for anything yellow or gold.
"Do you want me to go?" Gabriel shook his head, "Cassie told me what you did, I uh thank you, Dean, he's the only family I have left." Dean nodded knowing that feeling all too well, for a long time it had been him and Sam. "I guess you want answers?" Dean looked up at the ceilling his thoughts straying to Cas, hoping the man was asleep.
Well here goes, "Yeah, I have a date, with um Cas," Dean felt under prepared for the table to break out in frantic applause and loud screams.
“Haven't you heard, I’m cool,” Jo typically, responds with a rude hand gesture since Henry won’t see.
Dean moves to open the door the sight of Cas filling his vision, gladly he stands to stare at his boyfriend (wow) not noticing he's on his own until Sam clears his throat. "Hello Dean, Gabriel will be along in a minute he's currently occupied removing his secret candy out of my apartment." Dean decided to leave that one, how much could there be?
"Morning, of course, its bacon, I assume there's coffee?" he asked smiling when Dean chose to pour him a cup allowing Cas to settle himself at the breakfast bar. Cas loved the Winchester's place, it felt like a home whereas Cas' place lacked anything that made it one including more often than not his parents.
"Hey, I am scary." he protested, or at least he could be when it mattered. "We're gonna start over there." Dean pointed at the little bookshop the decision made had him feeling positive.
Weirdly Cas smiles, "Hello Dean, are you currently under the influence of any impairing substances?" God, who talked like that?
"Just my brother, however my relationship with my parents is complicated and not something I want to go into currently." that really didn't sound good, what had happened to him? Dean really needed to know, but he respects Castiel's need not to say anything. Knowing himself how hard these things were to talk about.
"He's not making me do anything, unlike some people!" screamed Sam jumping from his seat before dashing out of the cafeteria. Dean watched him go feeling like the worst big brother ever, he hated that feeling.
"Yeah, right now you go watch a movie I have something to take care of in the kitchen," said Sam shooing Gabriel away
After the final bell Dean was walking out toward Baby, hoping to smooth the way with Sam. Only his brother wasn't leaning up against his car but Gabriel's, sighing Dean changed direction to speak to his brother.
"Okay I guess it could be pretty cool and I'll get to tease Sammy, um would working together stop us from um..."
"Dean asked me to deliver this to you," she said skipping the pleasantries, holding out an oblong shaped gift sporting the same familiar black flower paper and tag. "And I wanted to talk so I could explain everything,"
"Poof it back! We're not third rate magicians at some kid's birthday party, honestly, you talk as if we have no finesse."
Sam had returned to Bobby's almost two weeks ago and Dean's constant mother hen behavior (Sam's words, God Dean was allowed to be worried!) had him threatening to pull out of today. The last two months with Cas had been amazing, containing the best sex of Dean's life, certainly not a hard feat after his past encounters. Being with Cas was everything he dreamed he could never have, even better was Cas was one kinky bastard and Dean had discovered his submissive side.
"Yeah, he's gone to help them because your Daddy is brave, okay." Henry nods doing his best not to cry, he wants his Daddy to be okay but he's scared. So he does the next best thing clutching to Sam. "I've got you, Egg, we'll get through this together."
"Yeah besides we've all eaten too much to be bending weirdly," added Sam though Gabriel was not one to be easily swayed.
"Oh God, yes. Have you accepted please say yes Kevin, I'll do anything I'll give you access to the good biscuits." she pleads her hands entwined as if she's praying.
"Okay, well this is my brother Sam, Sam this is Cas." Sam was nice enough to get up and shake hands along with all the other introductory stuff that first meetings deemed polite until Cas asks:
Dean met Cas' eyes and saw a look of trepidation. "No Cas, Charlie's just a little weird." everyone nodded in agreement all well versed in her Star Wars obsession that she called a lifestyle choice.
Never being one to stand on ceremony Gabriel attacked the wrapping paper with vigor, "Holy shit Sammy! Did you buy the sex shop beginners package or what!" exclaimed Gabriel.
In the afternoon, Sam had found Gabriel in his bedroom hiding more things for his prank against Dean.
"The early bird I see, is Cas the worm?" asked Gabriel hoping Dean understood his meaning, the blush told him he did.
Cas left smiling, smart enough to take his tart with him leaving Dean with Gabriel, "Listening in, not cool Gabe." to whihc he scoffed.
"I can't find anything to wear!" oh boy this was really bad, Gabriel about to reply before Cassie lost it again, however, he was silenced by the sound of the doorbell. "Oh my God! That's Dean, he's early."
With his thoughts swimming, Cas took advantage of it being Saturday and bedded down for some extra sleep. Only minutes later the incessant ringing of the doorbell started, God, wasn't anyone else home?
Sighing, Dean nods, "Yes, okay it's Cas." his parents have no reaction to this, making him wonder if they knew before he did.
"Fine, God Sammy and I used to get into some pretty hard prank wars. Did you and Gabe ever do that?" asked Dean gently hoping Cas wouldn't realize he was fishing for information about his childhood, but he was curious, dammit.
It was quiet moments like this when Cas couldn't deny his feelings for Dean, he watched him for a few moments more before Dean turned around a big welcoming smile adorning his face and those beautiful green eyes staring at him.
"No, our Grandfather never said if he'd spoken to them, I don't even know if our mother knows he died." Cas pulled away from the embrace surprising Dean at how hard he found it to let go.
"Before she uh... left, she told me Angels were watching over me and Sammy keeping us safe. The plant reminded her of that, we had one back in Kansas."
"Why do you sound all down? asked Dean noticing Sam had popped up again, "What now Sam? We were talking." God his brother was so over-protective.
"Fine, it's a new guy at my building we've been hanging out and he's just lovely. God, Gabriel the way he blushes, he does it so prettily." Gabriel holds up his hand in a stopping gesture.
"She really works there?" Gabriel nodded again knowing Sam was being serious, he felt certain he'd seen her in the back as he paid for his purchases, for whatever reason he felt it was something to keep quiet.
Dean hits the doorbell ignoring the trepidation fizzing in his stomach, he certainly wasn't expecting Cas to open the door nor was he ready for it. Laying eyes on him was wonderful after giving him some space with texts their only communication.
"We have those inside if you're happy with the Shasta you with need a bigger home for both of them and fresh fertilizer. Will you be alright, I'm being signaled." Sam and Henry both looked up to find a young woman flailing her arms at Cas.
"I'm here!" greeted Cas a little loudly approaching from the other side, it was enough to make Dean jump a little.
Feeling he could watch less furtively Dean moved as if to approach Cas, when the tingle became a large slice of fear as a neatly wrapped package was passed from Alfie to Cas' waiting hands and slightly blushing cheeks.
"Right now everyone grab a bauble!" demanded Gabriel unlike the others Dean grabbed a hot chocolate.
Nothing else was said, Dean kept looking into Cas' blue eyes how he loved to do, then without knowing who moved first they were kissing, far from the soft tentative kiss in the bathroom it was more desperate, Cas' hands were on Dean moving to push him against the door.
Working on cars is second nature now, allowing Dean to let his mind wander. He knows ignoring Cas isn't the answer, knew it even without sensing his brother's disappointed face through the phone.
"I wish! Nah we're playing twister," Gabriel clarified as shouts and screams came through the connection. "Something up?"
"Henry, it's so good to see you. Hello, Sam." Cas smiled at them. "You may call me Cas to Henry if you'd like if that's okay with your dad, is he here?" Sam wanted to applaud the man for being subtle.
"Hey, only if you're interested back, Cas," informed Sam, "Gabriel and I have got your back, you know?"
"Yeah Benny show some respect." it's now Dean wonders why he invited them, so he could mingle (spend time with Cas) while they managed the grill, good one Dean.
"You kidding, I'm getting a load of candy, watching cute pandas and snuggling against Sammy's shoulder, it'll be heaven."
"Ah, if I might interject." both brothers jumped at the voice turning to find Balthazar had joined them leading them to speak at the same time.
Satisfied in justifying his really very minor spill, Gabriel looked up at Sam, "Please don't social media any of that, I'll catch you later." Gabriel added before hopefully walking off in a cool demure way.
Dean was saved from his thoughts, by the fact that his phone was ringing. Looking at the display he felt his heart fall down into his stomach. It was Cas. Cas was ringing him. Okay take deep breaths, this is fine, normal even. Two guys talking to each other on the phone. It happens all the time. Maybe he wanted to speak to Henry, after seeing him today, possibly calling with important plant maintenance.
"Ah, Mr Novak, I've been waiting for you." Cas turned around to find the librarian Ms Moseley looking at him with a glint in her eye, she looked really happy to see him.
Before leaving the nursery, Castiel had been kind enough to give Henry some books and Dean his card - for any questions or concerns. At first, Dean thought he was being hit on, but that was ridiculous. Cas was too good for him not to mention male, besides looking like he did, there was no doubt Cas was short of romantic entanglements.
"Gabriel, that is quite enough! Sit down Sam, I can manage with Dean, believe me when I say I've dealt with worse,"
So when Sam opened the Bunker door to find Gabriel, he dropped his gun and half-dragged-half-carried him down the stairs, leaving a trail of muddy water behind from where it dripped off Gabriel’s clothes, and laid him down in his own bed.
The same cold that chilled the vacuum of space infected Cas’s blood. His wings. He felt the heat and color drain out of his skin, leaving his face ice white. Cut off. Shivers ran through him, and pain followed when Cas whimpered in fear and the collar struck him with its punishing voltage. His wings… cut off.
Sam reached out to his nightstand and fumbled to turn off his lamp. In total darkness and total silence, he buried his head into the pillow and finally let his eyes shut.
Castiel tries not to search for intent where there is none, determined to believe Dean’s sole priority is getting the house in order. Yet that doesn’t explain the “Mornin’ Sunshine” text he wakes to on Sunday, two hours before Dean picks him up to view the house. Or Dean showing up at the motel with dinner wrapped to-go Monday
Hollowing his cheeks, he slides back up to the tip, sucking like his life depends on it until Cas’ hips jerk, a sign that Dean is finally cracking through his controlled veneer. He knows what'll really break him though (shit, been there, done that), and raises his hands to Cas’ ass in a wordless request.
Castiel flicks the nearby light switch without luck before wandering past the stairs into the central living space with an open kitchen to his left. Straight ahead, speckled grains of dust float across the light streaming through French doors leading to a large wooden deck and separate covered porch. The right-hand corner of the living room bears an enormous stone fireplace, and beside it, the master suite. His father likely left the house before he was born, yet someone had to have tended to it in the meantime, or else it would be in far worse condition.
he’d be hard-pressed not to drop to his hands and knees, present his bare ass, and whine, “Please, Sir!” right there in the kitchen if Cas demanded it. Deep down, his rebellious, bratty side is kinda itching to see what’ll happen if he pushes his luck. But he’s not actually
With a simple touch and a look, he’s telling Dean that it’s okay, that in this moment at least, he is not alone. As small a gesture as it is, it’s still more than any of the meaningless platitudes he’s come to loathe hearing from others and brings a grateful smile to his lips.
He drops his coat on the small bench in the foyer, reaching for Dean’s shoulder so he doesn’t fall over while toeing off his muddy shoes and wet socks and Dean does the same. With a glance behind them, he sees the wreck they have made of the floor and knows they’ll have a lot of cleaning to do in the morning.
“Anytime. Um… we still probably have an hour or so till people start clearing out, though. Are you gonna be okay? Do you want to go lay down or something?”
Dean grumbles. He doesn’t know if he can move or that he wants to but is alert enough to surmise Cas isn’t asking so much as telling. “‘Kay...”
Just then, Castiel’s stomach lets out an embarrassingly loud rumble. A blush quickly rises to his cheeks as Dean belts out a deep, husky laugh.
“Can we, uh. Can we put this behind us now? Have a few beers, marathon Dr. Sexy, hang out like we always do?”
and the next day, when their lunch hours happen to line up, he wanders next door right as Cas’ break starts and asks bluntly, “Hungry?”
Dean groans. Castiel opens his mouth to remind his friend that the following Friday, he’ll be on a plane when a sudden sharp pain squeezes his heart. He takes a shuddering breath, curling in on himself. Thankfully the others are too distracted now to notice his agonized expression. Between his prior nerves, Dean's increasingly affectionate touches, the alcohol, strange glances their companions keep giving them and each other, and the butterflies flapping away in his gut each time he catches Dean’s eyes on him, it’s too much.
Rubbing his sore, heavy eyes, he turns the corner into the long, dim hallway beneath a solitary fluorescent bulb. It casts an eerie glow over the faded ivy paint, sputtering and flickering as though just to spite him. Castiel stumbles forward, briefcase bumping against his thigh, and digs into the pocket of his damp trench coat for the keys.
Cas doesn't quite know until Dean finds the sensitive place that makes him tremble and gasp at the junction of neck and shoulder and sets to work.
him. He wants to know everything there is to know about the guy; where he’s from, what he’s doing in Eden, what’s his favorite food, drink, does he like cars, movies? Is he a morning person or night owl? Coffee or tea? Does he prefer waffles to pancakes, or is he a bacon and eggs guy? And... does he like men?
His vision muddies, quivering at the corners. He flashes his most charming smile, hoping it hides his disorientation. “Hey there, gorgeous,” he says with an exaggerated wink.
Dean clears his throat. “You, uh… you ever want that?” he says, cocking his head toward the people nearby.
“I’ll bet those feel wonderful on you, don’t they? So soft, so beautiful. Do they make you feel beautiful, Dean? Because you are. You’re gorgeous.”
“I mean, I’m no good at this, man. I don’t know what I’m doin’, and it scares the hell outta me, but… I guess maybe I’m willing to give it a shot if you are, ya know?”
“I’m sorry.” Cas glances up, gaze soulful, searching. Dean looks away. He can’t bear the hope within them any more than he can bear to live through that rejection twice. “I… I just saw you standing here and… I wanted to make sure you were okay. Sorry for bothering you.”
He sighs, listlessly scooting eggs around the plate with his fork. “I couldn’t afford a place near my office. Could barely afford anything, if I’m being honest. I kept couch-hopping with friends for a while, stayed in a few shelters. Eventually saved enough to get my 'shithole' apartment, as Gabriel calls it, in Mattapan and started getting up at dawn to take the red line to Downtown Crossing every morning. Needless to say, it was a difficult adjustment.”
Thick, strong arms wrap around his back. One hand moves, a slow stroke between his shoulder blades, firm but soothing. His face warms and heart
His eyes fall to the silver counter below as a memory resurfaces; just a month ago, he’d been in this exact position with Cas knelt between his legs, hands pinning his hips to the cold steel, perfect pink lips wrapped around him, sucking and licking and teasing until Dean was a squirming, whimpering mess.
Four hours later, Castiel trudges up the stairwell to his apartment on legs of lead, the disgusting squelch of wet leather following him with every step.
“Yes. I’m… Cas,” he says, trying out the nickname for himself. He smiles, liking the way it sounds, and offers his hand to each of them. Though they’d technically met at the door a couple of hours before, they hadn’t been formally introduced as with the other guests.
“Because it is that easy. Look, bro, when’s the last time you did something for yourself? Just because you wanted to? I know you want this. You know it. So what’s holding you back?”
“What?” He shrugs, looking at Sam and Jess. “You’re both fresh from college, and in California, no less. I assume you have at least tried it.”
It’s bad enough the dude is sex on legs when he’s being awkward and cute; Cas brings out that Badass Motherfucker “I will smite you where you stand” look and all Dean wants to do is sink to his knees in the middle of the produce section. He doesn’t even eat this rabbit food, not unless it’s shoved into a sandwich between stacks of meat and cheese or tossed into a hearty stew or something, and is only here because he knows Sammy will complain if there’s nothing healthy at the party.
It’s fifteen minutes shy of 7 a.m. when he pulls the Impala into his spot at Singer’s Auto Repair and cuts her engine, taking a brief moment to check his texts. There’s one from Ellen confirming dinner at her and Bobby’s place that weekend, and another from Sam doing the same, as though he’s irresponsible enough to forget. Dean’s twenty-four, for Chrissakes. He practically changed the kid’s diapers.
Castiel rolls his shoulders within the damp fabric of his shirt where it clings to his chest as he steps into the kitchen, but chooses to ignore it for now since, he laughs bemusedly to himself, he’ll likely be out of it soon if all goes well. He finds no whiskey left in the cabinet, but there is a leftover bottle of high-end tequila Charlie brought two weeks ago during a dinner where she’d roped both Dean and Castiel into attending some event set to take place in early November. Lark-something, maybe?
“I don't know...” Heat rises to his cheeks. “Perhaps.” It comes out sounding a lot more like a question than he intended, the answer to which is lost somewhere in the air between them.
Which leaves him circling back to Cas. He’s not a brother, nor a lover, and not merely a friend like Charlie or Benny. So what the fuck is he to Dean?
At that, Dean hums, plopping onto his butt and shifting to face Castiel. He stretches his legs out, twisting his neck side to side, working out the kinks from squatting in the same position too long. The relieved groan which escapes Dean’s lips is not lost on him, and he prays his face remains impassive despite the momentary hitch of his breath.
He’s tired, and still kinda pissed, and the last thing he wants is to rehash the events of that evening. But he knows Cas well enough now that it’s obvious he isn’t gonna let this go unless Dean says something, so he half-turns and replies in a throaty voice, “Me too.”
“I prefer the word ‘oblivious’. Less dumb, less ass.” Cas’ head tilts, pondering. “Unless you’re into the latter. Which I certainly hope you are because I’m quite fond of yours.”
Castiel hurriedly turns off the shower and jumps out, yelling, “Just a minute!” He wipes down as quickly as he can and tugs on fresh boxers, a pair of dark-wash jeans, and navy t-shirt which sticks to his damp skin.
“Of course. Call my office on Monday and, provided he improves, we’ll set up a follow-up appointment for next week.”
Cas’ lips part around a soft intake of breath, and Dean’s eyes fall to track the movement. His heart races, the tinny music from the overhead speakers drowned out by its frantic
Castiel nods, relaxing on the bed again. “We'll just have to buy some, then.” It doesn't hit him at first, what the phrase implies. He's surprised to find that instead of shooting off a snarky retort, Dean is wearing a huge, eager grin.
One episode and several beers later, Cas says he’s going to feed Claire and change, bemoaning the evils of summer and current odor accumulated by his (and technically Dean’s) clothing as a result.
Dean sits forward, eyebrows cocked, leaning both elbows on the table. Cas, a rebel? Guy doesn’t look the part, dressed as he is.
It feels as though each moment which has carved Castiel’s path, each stepping stone along his journey, occurred solely to lead him here, to this place, this life.
. When fingers card affectionately through his hair he looks up from beneath his lashes, takes Cas down as far as he can go without choking and moans, the sound vibrating through Cas’ thick girth.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says wearily. He parks a hip against the counter and rubs the back of his neck, feeling sheepish and ashamed and still stupidly turned on. “I, uh… I don’t know what got into me.”
His style now, if it could even be called that, ended up a strange hodgepodge of that era and the current one. It boringly consists of jeans, slacks, a few plain, monochrome t-shirts, shorts, sweatpants reserved for exercise or lounging at home, and his favorite trench. And for work, exactly a dozen white dress shirts and five business suits (three black, two dark navy) he rotates through each week and dry cleans every Saturday like clockwork.
Winchester, haven’t tapped that?” He shakes his head, which is now feeling a little too light for comfort. Charlie’s mouth opens and closes several times before she whispers, “But you’re like, living together.”
The utter monotony of it all wears on him. Gauges deep worry lines in his face, puts bags under his eyes. It's a lonely, disheartening life.
Dean hunkers over, wheezing with laughter, supporting himself with a hand on the small of Castiel’s back. Dean seems to be touching him more than usual today, something he hadn’t expected the man to do with others around. It leaves Castiel with a confusing mixture of warmth, uncertainty, and longing.
Rivulets of sweat run down his brow, temples. Damp heat curls the hair around Cas’ ears and nape, though he tries not to look to closely at that. Or the way clothes stick wetly to the curve and shape of him. Dean pushes his own hair off his forehead, frustrated, and halfway through the day peels off his shirt.
, Dean.” And when did they get so close? When did his hands reach for Dean? He’s not pushing Castiel away, not yet, but his eyes are wide and shining like a deer caught in headlights, brimming with unshed tears. Castiel ponders whether the depth of the affection he feels toward this man will truly be the death of him because it’s welling up, overflowing—
“Yeah? Anything specific on your mind?” he says suggestively, feeling playful. Not like Cas will get the implication, anyway.
and though Cas had wanted to go along with him, it'd been Dean’s idea for him to stay behind. Jack might be an all-powerful nephilim and hunter-in-training, but they’re still just a kid, and with Sam busy tracking leads and appointing cases to the rest of their steadily growing network, at least one of ‘em had to stick around to help them out (and keep him out of trouble).
This is his own personal Heaven; a perfect two-lane strip of rain-damp asphalt stretched far into the horizon. It’s so still, so quiet. Soothing. His head tilts back, exposing the long, bare line of his neck to the breeze. Rotating gently, he cracks it and groans with relief.
Blinking slowly at him like a drugged owl, Cas hooks a thumb over his shoulder and murmurs, “I should—”
, Dean hears the slap of flesh against flesh through the phone, and the image of Cas stripping his dick while listening to Dean fuck his own tight hole, panting and whining for more, sends such a strong bolt of arousal through him that his cock weeps another drop of precome. “Pull your hair now Dean. Make it hurt.”
Even now, with his own troubles and pain, Gabe thinks of him. Reaches out, tries to ease his burden, shows him he isn’t
The thought, however fleeting, carries with it a stir of excitement that leaves him breathing through his nose and clenching his jaw to will away. He barely manages a weak and strangled, “Y-yes?”
Two and a half cups of all-purpose, unbleached flour, spooned and leveled. One teaspoon salt. Six tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed. Three-fourths of a cup of vegetable shortening. Half a cup, 120 milliliters, of ice water.
Lost in thought, he doesn’t notice that Cas slipped away for a minute until the harsh rattle of the metal cart underneath his fingertips jerks him away from that runaway train. Blinking rapidly, he wonders how long he’s been standing here staring at six different varieties of lettuce. Cas is beside him, hair as ruffled and fucked-out as always—which just makes Dean want to run his fingers through it—tossing box after box of Hungry Man Dinners stacked high in his arms into the basket.
“Cas...” Dean says, voice breaking. Castiel hears the click of his throat, feels his pulse against his cheek, the movement as Dean swallows. “You’re gonna be fine.”
Within seconds, Dean is calm once more, virtually purring from Castiel’s ministrations. It brings a fond smile to his face.
Beyond the desk, filing cabinets and shelves line the walls, making the compact space near claustrophobic. It’s less an office and more a closet, and the more he stares, the more he despises it. Not only the room, and the impersonal clutter within, but the menial tasks he does in it too, day after day after day.
They both lean in simultaneously, fumbling for the cap so maybe they can reattach it, and their heads crash together with a painful thud.
Throughout the week, Castiel had scraped every inch of dated, peeling wallpaper from the house and prepared the walls for fresh coats of paint.
Turning to Castiel, Meg shrugs and says, “Me and Dean here, we go way back. We just like to tease each other.” He nods, takes a sip of his beer, and she smiles. This time it’s kind rather than suggestive, which just makes him feel even worse. “I’ll leave you boys to it and check you out at the register when you’re ready.”
, to remove the tension in Dean’s posture and bring back the pleasant mood from earlier, he’s frozen in the passenger seat, terrified that he’ll only make things worse. Putting his feelings on the line, if Dean’s question is indeed a joke, would only end in catasrophe and heartbreak. If not… fuck, he could be letting his one chance at happiness slip through his fingers.
, makes him think of Dean. A song gifted to him by the love of his life, because what better is there to occupy his mind with than the man he’s intent to impress today?
“Yeah,” he breathes. “Yeah, okay.” His fingers slip and slide as they twist and tug the base of the plug. After a brief struggle and frustrated grunt, he pulls it free, his gaping, wet hole clenching and pulsing around empty space, and pleads, “Need you.”
Dean yawns again, pulling Cas even tighter against him. Hopefully not for the last time. He listens, waiting for Cas’ breathing to even out. Then whispers, “G’nite,” into his soft curls and falls asleep with a smile.
(because why would he be), he doesn’t show it. The combined decades growing up with older brothers and in private boarding schools taught him quite well how to appear neutral and unfazed by just about anything. He steps back and gestures for him to enter.
Lips locked, they’re stumbling like idiots step by step, alternating between Dean being pressed against the wall and Cas being pushed into the railing. Hands claw at clothing—son of a bitch, why is Cas still wearing so many
Chuckling fondly, he tosses the empty cup in the trash, immediately pulls off his shirt and shorts and tosses them in in the corner. Eyeing the small pile of clothes accumulating there, he makes a mental note to stop at the public laundromat nearby within the week.
For whatever reason, Dean keeps holding back and Castiel can’t bring himself to push. Even if Dean is attracted to him, Castiel wants more than one night of euphoria, because however amazing it may feel in the moment, it wouldn’t be worth ruining what they have now.
They sit for a time, quiet, surrounded only by the gentle melodic patter and soft, even breaths, before Cas speaks again. “Do you like the rain, Dean?”
The rhythmic strumming of an electric guitar and steady beat of a drum flow through the wood door as they approach. He hums along to the familiar tune and holds it open for Castiel, because contrary to his brother’s belief, he can be a gentleman when he wants to.
How could he have not known? In that moment, or all those preceding it, that Dean felt the same longing that rages like an inferno within Castiel? His eyes brim with tears, the brunt of that realization hitting him with full force as he stands alone in the kitchen, lips twitching with a smile.
It’s one thing to take some hot piece home for a quick tumble in the sheets and quite another to want someone you have to look at the next day, and the day after, and the day after that. Like mashing together two universes that totally don’t belong, sticking the Man with No Name into a Bond film or Obi-Wan into Star Trek. Dean isn’t just out of his element here; he’s in a whole other fucking
Dean puts the phone on speaker and sets it on the desk. Trembling with anticipation, he tugs open a dresser drawer, reaching beneath the layers until his fingers graze the soft, silken material buried there. Once freed, he rubs the black satin between thumb and forefinger. Presses it gently to his cheek, relishing the caress of it over his heated skin. It soothes, comforts, emboldens him just as much as arouses and a moan slips past his lips unbidden.
Dean’s fingertips twitch with need, and as he rubs two sweating palms against his jeans he notices his cock's beginning to take a keen interest in this new development. He angles his body away, forcing his eyes to follow suit, and ends up railing his pelvis into the corner of the dresser.
He sighs. “I’m fine.” Wiping his eyes, he relaxes into Dean’s side, relishing the man’s body heat in the mild chill of the night.
! And at that moment, all the other shit hanging over him would disappear, those old uncomfortable feelings he keeps buried, locked behind an impenetrable vault, and he’d let himself be
Her eyes dart between him and Castiel a couple of times, putting the pieces together before a devilish grin spreads across her round face. The competition is on, and now they both know it.
Castiel sits forward, lips pursed. Hearing Dean speak about himself in such a way hits a nerve. “That’s not true at all. You’re not ‘Average Joe’, you're Dean Winchester. And from what I have heard, you have many admirable qualities.”
. His lips trail down Cas’ jaw, finding the small spot beneath his ear that makes him hum with pleasure (and sometimes, when he bites it, whine with need). Then he slips a thigh between Cas’ legs, less out of wanting more than reflex, and rocks forward, careful and slow—
By the time the call is over, he’s feeling irritable and drained, and his stomach is beginning to protest its emptiness. Reentering the room, he flings the phone at the bed before flopping into the chair beside Dean, who is mounting the A/C back into the wall.
His heart feels too big for his chest, seeing all the people he loves in one place like this, happy and at peace. Only one person is missing, but in a way, maybe she’s looking down on them right now. Watching over them… or, ya know, something like that.
Dean chuckles weakly, the sound vibrating through Castiel’s chest. “Maybe a little, but not in a bad way. Once they get to know you, they’ll love you...” he trails off.
Castiel takes in the manuscripts piled haphazardly in the middle of his desk in metal-clasped, orange envelopes. The organizer at the corner stacked with manilla envelopes filled with company memos and reports, labeled and organized. The cup full of pens next to the placard in the center bearing his name and job title. The framed picture of Claire, taken a few years prior. The computer beside his left elbow, screensaver with a small icon crawling across the screen in the same annoying, repetitive pattern.
Once alone with Cas, the nerves kick into high gear. He’s wanted to ask Cas out for months by this point, but now that they’re actually sitting down together somewhere outside of work, he’s at a complete fucking loss. His eyes zero in on the napkin he’s currently shredding for want of something to do with his hands.
Filing that information away for later, he angles Dean’s head. Licks along the hem of his lips until they open, eager and wanting, tongues sliding together around their mutual sounds of pleasure. He slots a thigh between Dean’s legs, a shiver vibrating down his spine at the sensation of Dean’s plumping cock upon every sinful roll of his narrow hips. His own responds in kind, beginning to strain uncomfortably in his slacks as Dean pants into his mouth, each breath coming harsher than the last until Castiel forces himself to pull away for air.
,” Dean pleads, hand dropping from the death-grip it’s had around his shoulders to fumble at Castiel’s belt. “Waited so long—”
, he thinks. He doesn’t say that, though, instead simply nods and smiles. “Pancakes?” he asks hopefully.
Seconds later, Cas follows with a shout of his name and Dean hums, sated and content, muffled where his mouth is smashed into the blanket right beside the phone. They remain like that for minutes, hours, he can’t tell, just listening to each other breathing. Warmth unfurls within his chest. He feels light, so light, body weightless and numb, drifting upon clouds when he realizes Cas has been repeating a question.
He doesn’t bother waiting for the shower to heat before stepping inside, hissing as the cool water hits his skin. The shock of it stirs him further awake, and it’s a stark relief from the summer heat outside. Before long, however, steam begins to fill the room, so he pops the cap off the small travel shampoo he bought and lathers the suds into his hair. He’s barely scrubbed and rinsed the sweat from his skin when someone bangs on the front door.
“Then you’re going to stay just like this and ride that cock as if it were mine. Do you understand?”
The further into the house Castiel wanders, the more he thinks about his father's life here and how it made him the man he was, the more unsettled he feels. Backing out, he turns and tiptoes up the stairs, which creak and groan mildly under his weight. He grips the banister but quickly withdraws his hand, almost black with dust. Grimacing, he wipes it on his coat and continues his search.
But there are many layers to loneliness, some of which cut so deep only one thing can heal the wound. This loneliness is cold with no glimmer of hope for heat. Like sitting in a dark room, crying for a light that never appears. The sort of heartwrenching lonely that eats at you slowly, an ache so constant, so sure, you eventually believe it’s always been there and there’s no other way
Half peeved and half worried, he toes off his boots and hangs his jacket in the small closet in the foyer before wandering to the second floor. It’s not until he reaches the top that he hears the shower running and sighs with relief.
“Shh,” he soothes, caressing the man’s jaw with his nose. “I’ve got you.” He sits back on his heels, withdrawing his hand despite the desperate whine Dean emits. “How do you want me, Dean?”
“I’ll work for room and board. Long as you pay for what materials I can’t get through my business or from Singer’s Salvage, the labor’s covered.”
He reluctantly withdraws his hand, returning his attention to the screen. His jaw clenches as a new feeling settles over him; determination. Navigating his cursor to the little plus sign in the upper left corner of the page, he clicks “Compose”.
, oh God, g-gonna—” he chokes out. His rhythm begins to falter. Close, too close, the coil in his groin a bowstring pulled taut and so, so ready to snap. “Touch yourself.” Dean obeys, arm jerking beneath them and he wishes he could
“I—” Cas pauses, glancing toward the front of the store, probably to make sure Rufus hasn’t come out of the office. The box of supplies sits empty in front of them. “For school.”
Half-expecting the Empty to manifest and ruin this fleeting, happy moment, Jack whipped around, searching for the aggressor. Which form would it take? Would he have time to say goodbye to Cass? Maybe the Empty would go back to sleep. That’s all it wanted anyways, right?
Dean felt the air leave his lungs in one, swift motion.  How many times had he been betrayed?  Used?  Abused?
Quick as the wind, all three men turned to the source of the sound.  Amara and Sam had arrived all right, but someone else had too.
Told ya it’s not what you think lol One more chapter left. Also, it’s gonna be open ended and a little angsty but hopefully more bittersweet than sad! :,)
He snapped his fingers and the ropes binding Sam tightened even further over his raw wrists and ankles, causing him to cry out. And then he was gone.
“Because I know what it feels like to feel like you don't belong, to feel like there's this darkness inside of you, to be scared of who you are, what you can do. Dean, Cass...my family helped me through that. So now I wanna help you. Because you're not evil, Jack.”
Apologies for the inconsistent updates! I just started a new job, so I’ve been settling in, but I haven’t forgotten about this fic. I foresee a few more chapters. Hope you like it!
Stalking across the room to the door, Dean checked the hallway before gesturing for Sam to follow. Sam’s limbs had atrophied from being forced to sit so long, so he stumbled to the door, but Dean steadied him.
Shuddering, Sam closed his eyes, willing it to all go away.  He could feel Lucifer’s hot breath on him as panic began to take over his senses.
Slinking into the dim light of the room, Lucifer, now somehow donning Nick’s form, sauntered over to one of the bookshelves and lazily leafed through a book.
He was inches away from Sam’s face now and all Sam could see was the road to hell etched in the devil's eyes.
“You know, this is getting pretty boring. So predictable. I mean, I’m God now, I can do whatever I want, but I have some unfinished business.”
The Empty would still come, Jack thought. Cass wasn’t completely happy. Something was missing. Sighing, Jack wished he could simply enjoy this moment. Dean forgives him. Cass is here and somewhat satisfied. Sam is still by his side, always has been. Chuck is gone. And the balance wouldn’t be thrown off since Amara agreed to leave this dimension and never return. Dean had convinced her somehow.
“Oh, not long. So if you’re wondering if he hates your guts too, yeah he did. We finally had a common enemy. But you know I’m not one to let go of grudges so easily.”
“I was hoping we’d have a chance to do this before you had that boy kill me,” she remarked calmly as she pulled up her dress.
Cruelly, he pushed Sam farther into the ground, smiling as Sam screamed out in anguish.  Dean snapped into action and ran to his brother’s side, brandishing an angel blade.
"If you're sure, this place belongs to Ellen, she and my uncle married a few years back. She won't take shit from anyone, and you'll be safe with me." he wanted to reassure Cas, but he seemed unable to do so without his protective instincts coming into play. Ever since Sam, he'd never been able to turn them off, he was a mama bear alright.
"Found them!" cheered Gabriel pulling a pack of butterfingers out and digging in, Cas hadn't even known they were there, trust his brother to have stockpiles of candy secreted throughout the office, it sure did explain a few things. "Don't judge me, I need the pick me up after my journey, okay. Besides my free time was spent spiritedly, these college kids Cassie, they've got stamina.
"Wow, Dean this looks amazing." without further comment or niceties Cas picked up his burger and dove in. Dean couldn't look away, his own burger forgotten (yes forgotten and Dean Winchester wasn't one to forget food especially a burger). His eyes went wide as Cas moaned from the taste, the noise jolted Dean his body reacting with a sort of yearning or was it jealousy?
"Other there," Cas waved his spoon holding hand behind him, "It's a spiced Cranberry infusion jello, Dean everything tastes so good with my enhanced receptors," explained Cas digging in for more.
“Our dear old Dad would have some festive cheer in his heart for his kids,” Cas nodded looking sad. Dean still remembered the night he stole gifts from a house close to the motel they were staying in at the time.
"Well, that put him in a good mood." Dean couldn't answer yet, he was in a sort of tailspin. "You will call Cas, won't you?" finally he met his brother's eyes and nodded knowing it was the right decision by Sam's beaming smile.
Once he had said what was wrong the questions came, Henry wanted to know when they would see Cas again and why hadn't he called or texted. Thankfully Sam messaged Cas who called Dean cell's, he hadn't even been able to answer it, instead passing it over to Henry to take the phone, the kid's smile had been nice to see.
"Wow, Dean that's low, I'm not going to say and you'll thank me when you can still run up the stairs without collapsing." Sam pushed his unfinished plate to Henry, now he was getting all defensive under the guise of keeping Dean trim (please he still had a hot bod and knew it) could his little brother have a crush, on a baker? If so Dean would support it wholeheartedly.
"I'm a paying customer." protested Bal shaking his bag of Cheetos at him. "Besides the night is still young."
"Hey would you mind swapping seats with my brother?" asked Sam moving fast with his own guy while Dean had yet to speak. Sam's guy had golden hair and eyes to boot, even sitting down he seemed kind of short.
A noise sounded from his position, crap he could swear he had more stealth than this. Dean had completely forgotten to miss the squeaky step.
Finally, he hears Dean coming down the stairs, from Dean's expression it's obvious their grouping is about to lose a third.
"Well thank you, you're so considerate Dean." he watched as Cas picked up his burger, "Now let's eat." Dean certainly couldn't argue with that.
"You can cook!" it comes out like an accusation which is certainly not meant. Only the way Cas reacted to his food made him feel good, and it always brought Cas back to him.
It took a little longer than expected because his room was a complete mess (Dad's words) it wasn't that bad, Daddy was just too tidy. Finally locating what he needed Henry grabbed one of his astronauts (sorry Chomps) since space travelers were good for inspiration and headed back downstairs.
Sam and Gabriel graced straight to Sam's bedroom, he couldn't remember a more special Christmas Eve.
And if he did why did that make Dean angry? Because they were friends right? Dean wanted to be sure this person was good enough for Cas like he would with any of his friends.
It was now Thursday night and Henry had spent time with Jo consuming too much sugar. Dean had been busy, having taken steps to ensure a full schedule all in the name of avoidance.
"I hope you like it Henry." his voice came out shy something Henry quickly abated by hugging the man in the seat he'd adopted.
She wanted him to come along, only Cas had seen them for what they really were having been at the hands of bullies many times. Alistair and the others hadn't done anything yet apart from the few glares he felt now and then, soon his good luck would run out and he didn't want to give them any ammunition.
"Our parents are hugely religious they named us after angels. For whatever reason I came out too, I thought if they knew it was both of us they'd know it was something that couldn't be fixed. So they threw us out instead." Cas offered a weak smile, one that in no way touched his eyes, eyes filled with unshed tears his arms wrapped around himself protectively.
Dean's swap of the home office to the kitchen had done nothing for his productivity, hoping the change of scenery would do him good along with a little fuel ( coffee and pie). So far he'd only managed to open the email from Jesse, mainly it was pictures of the Corvette so he could get an idea of what he was up against.
Taking pity on his brother, Dean let it go. "Okay, I was just thinking about Henry's birthday, I have an idea but I don't know if it's good or not."
"Cassie what's with all the stomping?" his brother jumped at the intrusion, wow Cassie was all over the place right now. This definitely needs a deft touch, Gabriel was more a sledgehammer type hopefully he could tone it down a little.
"He?" oh fuck, that was meant to stay under wraps, curse his stupid brain. The new information has Sam perked up like nothing before.
Before Dean could stop himself the words had already escaped. "He did?" Dean silently cursed at himself, he didn't need to give his brother any more ammunition.
"That's probably true, I'm not sure if you remember but Henry mentioned my Mom the day we were here. It got me thinking about her and it occurred that I couldn't remember her favorite flower, so I'm here looking for inspiration." Dean didn't really mean to say all that, personally he was blaming the man's gaze.
"Excellent, my brother Gabriel is always taking issue over my lack of pop culture references, perhaps with your help, I could surprise him," queried Cas walking over to the door.
"You're not spoiled," argued Cas to which Meg raised her eyes, "Fine you were a lot but you weren't a mean person because of it, hell Sam wouldn't ave been friends with you otherwise." clarified Cas.
It was Cas who got him to sign up for the class in the first place, during one of their many comic book sessions Cas had found some of his sketches stuffed into the pages as temporary bookmarks.
Checking he had his good night clothes on Cas ran a hand through his hair, it didn't help any. Pulling his bedroom door open Cas dashed down the stairs flinging open the door to find Meg looking the least confident he'd ever seen her.
Dean had been his Knight, perhaps he had even before this hour of terror. Trusting people was difficult (Gabriel struggled too) but with Dean it was easy, he was dazzling. He was free now if only it would sink in and stay there. Not straight away of course but soon he would  stop checking his phone and ignoring his mail.
Following his nose to the welcome scent of coffee where he noticed a filled yet untouched cup no doubt belonging to Gabriel. Knowing Cas wouldn't mind and hoping Gabriel would be the same Dean helped himself before taking a seat at the massive table while soaking in his surroundings.
"I may not be here, Henry I need to leave once the delivery arrives." Henry nodded mirroring Cas' earlier disappointment, well wasn't that interesting thought Sam.
"Since it means so much you guys should get to experience the whole thing," answered Sam his brain sparking an idea, "Is there anything you guys specifically want to do?"
"Thanks again Dean, I can't believe you went to so much trouble, it really puts me to shame." smiled Cas leaning in.
"Are you okay at your Aunts?" Cas asked wondering how he'd react if his parents up and left him and Gabriel.
Fate, however, threw a curveball, when Dean was eight and Sam four a fire tore through the Winchester house killing Mary. Feeling betrayed that the Angels Mary loved did nothing to save her John left with his two sons, immediately set out to find others who shared in his distrust.
"Dean, you really need to treat that as a blessing," joked Cas as Dean weighed their plates down with bacon, mushrooms and fried bread while the eggs cooked he poured two glasses of orange juice setting them down on the counter, "Dean this looks so good, you sure you're stomach can handle it?" Cas teased as Dean brought over the pan holding four perfectly cooked eggs.
That was odd, his brother knew his schedule better than he did and only called when during his free times. Currently, Sam should be in a lecture. "Hey Dean," he answered lying back down.
He wants to believe what Bobby said, the man hasn't ever set him wrong. Dean hasn't really embraced the whole optimism thing even with Sam as his brother.
Sam made a show of looking around the room. "Okay, who are you? Where's my brother? He'd definitely recognize his one true love, even in a box." joked Sam.
"Let's look for something to watch." phew crisis avoided, it was probably best to let it well alone and ignore it. Flicking through the channels Dean stops on an all too familiar Doctor.
Hearing Gabriel coming down the stairs Dean straightened himself, the man was on the phone to someone just finishing up as he entered the kitchen. "Yeah, thanks Alfie, I'll call you later."
Dean stopped the thought from forming again, mainly because it wasn't comforting or helping him understand what he was seeing. Truthfully it wasn't really a salad, it was all fancy! Sure there was a huge pile of leaves, but along for the ride was something orange, rice, mushrooms (he knew those two) and some type of beans.
Cas entered the Library happy to see Sam at their usual table, curiously holding court in the back were Meg, Alastair and Lilith seemingly engrossed in actual work.
"Cas, those are Angel's Trumpets, right?" he asked his voice quiet, hoping. The plants were large, with big green leaves, the flowers drooping down in a spectrum of different colors as if showering the earth with their grace.
Reluctantly pulling away from his hiding spot, Dean met the beautiful eyes of Castiel Novak. Seriously how were they so blue? "I'm good, thanks, um I'm Dean Winchester." okay as starts went that wasn't bad, maybe he could do this.
About a week after Henry's school trip, Dean didn't know who was pissing him off more. Henry with his constant obsession over his plant (at first it was cute) or Sam with his constant smirking and teasing.
Shit! This again, did he want kids? With Sam? Woah, this was way too big, he and Sam hadn't even been together a whole month.
“Well I thought we could involve Gabe and Cas, and um I was thinking you could handle the food,” said Sam dangling the proverbial carrot.
Dean is two thirds through his current beer trying to forget the previous evening and most of the day when Benny sits down opposite him no doubt he was wrangled here by Ellen.
"No, he told us on the trip they do up gardens." well shit. "We can't do it alone Dad, you two don't know anything about it and I only know a little but Cas knows
He brings the drinks in, Cas thanking him with his eyes glued to the tv he doesn't see Dean leave again until a tray is set in front of him holding sliders and fries.
"Sure is, Ellen knows the owner, Missouri. She's out of town but I really hope you'll meet her one day, we have her express approval to be here." Dean could see Cas still looked doubtful, "Let's just say you both share a common interest." that earned him a smile, he was collecting them at this point always feeling that one more would be enough only it never was.
"Dean," Cas called making him turn back his eyes already raised at the assumed protest. "Thank you, I know you probably don't think so but you're special." feeling his cheeks blush along with that familiar swoopy feeling Dean hurried away.
Deciding it couldn't hurt Cas made his way to the coffee, Cas loved his black and rich it was the only thing that made getting up bearable. Stopping in front of the roast beans he scanned the items, a flash of yellow caught his eye.
"Do you want her to be your girlfriend?" Henry continued, Dean was about to step in knowing his son would just keep on with the questions otherwise when Cas' answered and Dean felt he could no longer move.
"Oh, that's cool. Look I wanted to run something by you." for whatever reason Dean couldn't get the words out, he didn't want to rock the boat, his relationship with Cas was still in its novel stages. They weren't really at the stage of favors just yet.
"Sure am, so where'd you guys end up?" Dean asked while attempting to tidy his desk a little. The work crisis avoided he was ready to hang out.
Feeling his cheeks blush Dean looks down at Henry "I just wanted to help out, the job shouldn't cost more than two fifty. If this other guy charged more its unnecessary, that's more than enough to break the contract."
