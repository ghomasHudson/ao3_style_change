intervene, now or any other time. God never does. Though when John Watson cried out for God, he used Sherlock's full name, like maybe God didn't know who Sherlock was, or maybe John just wanted to make sure God didn't confuse him with all the other Sherlocks in the world and inadvertently save the wrong one.
"Your  lab coat is wrinkled, like you don't care anymore. No make-up. You  didn't even shower. You're too much of a professional to come to work  like that. And you've never said a hurtful word to anyone in your life,  even when they deserved it. It's your defense mechanism, one that  clearly didn't work when you were singled out for termination." Sherlock  pointed at her black office. "And you were crying alone in your office  in the dark and there's a roll away under your desk. Despite putting in  so many hours you've actually slept here in an effort to save your job,  you're getting laid off."
John was walking down the sidewalk, behind him. He could not see John. The hair on the back of Sherlock's neck stood up. He could hear John's stiff gate, recognized it immediately. Familiar. Angry. Oh yes, the bank account. Drained.
The communal visitor center looked something like a cafeteria with no windows. There was a television mounted to the wall in the corner inside a plexi-glass case. There was a coffee vending machine that only brewed decaffeinated coffee. There were half a dozen large, circular tables with matching chairs made of muted off-white molded plastic (no sharp edges), bolted to the floor so they couldn't be thrown or moved. There were stacks of magazines with curled edges and some donated books. Several low risk patients who were not confined to their rooms had meandered in and lounged around the television, a few reading.

“Harriet Watson, I’m Sherlock Holmes.” He extended his hand.
Later, old Sherlock descended the stairs and walked out of 221b. As he did, he saw that Mrs. Hudson's door was ajar, sweet smells and cheerful humming drifting out. He felt a pang of longing but ignored it. He went outside and paused in front of Speedy's, eyes skimming over familiar tables and a familiar awning…and a familiar life that died long ago with John, during a time when he could watch and deduce without guilt and simply experience life as it was without attributing dark meanings to every observation.
Molly froze. She turned around slowly, her face  puzzled, like she didn't believe what she had heard.
With a sigh, Molly stood up, shrugged off her  lab coat and wadded it in her hand, looked at it for a second, then  dropped it on the floor. She unclipped her name badge from her blouse  and dropped it in the floor. She took her purse off the desk, slung it  over her shoulder and stepped unceremoniously over her discarded  identity and emerged from the office, closing the door behind her. "Lock  up when you're done," she told Sherlock. "Whenever you're done."
Sherlock was in the kitchen, washing dishes. He paused uncomfortably at John's question. "Um," he started. "I hope you don't mind. I told Mrs. Hudson about the baby. She gave us one month of no rent as a present. Oh. And she's going to organize a surprise baby shower once Harry's pregnant, so…be sure to act surprised whenever it happens. However, because she has to keep it a secret, she has to refrain from gushing her excitement to us for a bit, so expect only a few more weeks of peace. Then all bets are off."
“Okay,” Sherlock agreed readily, nodding.

"Well," John sighed, putting his napkin on his plate. "I like you just fine the way you are. And by the way, your compliment was very good. Magnificent."
"Sherlock? Sherlock?"
"He's my friend," John said defiantly. "I have a  chance to make things right."
John looked up at himself in the mirror.
"The way you felt," John attempted to articulate, "when you thought I was the bomber?"

John's shoulders relaxed.  "Right."
Mrs. Hudson said, "He either has to…learn to be proud of that silly little thing…or hate himself along with it for the rest of his life." Now, she took the rainbow flag from John. "I think he wears those black suits because every day is a funeral."
The windows rattled. The floor shook.
0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0
At  that, Sherlock smiled wider, revealing teeth. It was a challenge then.
“This is going to make me late to my appointment,” John admonished. "I have to change."
"I break stupid laws," Sherlock hissed. "And the others I observe because they are right, not because they are punitive."
to give you a chance. For one, I'm not interested. Sorry. I don't want your feelings hurt, but I just don't want to.  And furthermore, I'm very happy that you are straight. So just stand there and continue to be straight."
John barely noticed the honor he'd been given and continued on; "And I did. I told her I loved her and I meant it, and there was nothing forced or fake about it. And Harry didn't stop drinking or partying and she didn't become a different person. But she did meet Clara and Clara was very sweet and the two of them were happy for a while and I was happy for them, even while my parents weren't. And yes, you were right, Sherlock, as always. When I came back from Afghanistan and I found out Harry and Clara were divorcing, I was disgusted and I didn't take up Harry's invitation to stay at her place. But it wasn't because I 'liked' Clara. Well, I did, but not in the way you were suggesting. I was disappointed in Harry for still being thoughtless and spiteful and immature. But I've never been disappointed that she's not straight. I haven't dwelled on it since. Not once." John sat up and propped his elbows on the table, ruffling his hair. His scalp inched. He was also long overdue for a shower. "Anyhow. Why did you ask me about Harry?"
Harry took a deep-breath. “But do you think I
Sherlock unscrewed the cap of his bottle and took a sip. He winced. He looked over his shoulder at John for approval.
"I made all my own problems," Lestrade said with a sigh.  "This is the first decision I've made in years I'm really proud of."  He's eyes were gleaming.
Sherlock's  fingers dug into his thighs. He pierced the cloth and his skin.
. So there's that, too. You…you…" He looked away again, settling down into his seat with finality. "…suck."
It brought  all of Sherlock's brain work to a startling halt. His face turned bright  red, heat rising from his cheeks. He felt as if the bustling crime  scene, the busy street, the traffic beyond the yellow tape all came to a  halt and every eye was on him.
“You’re very calm all of a sudden,” John said impatiently, accepting the mug.
John didn’t seem to realize he'd actually said anything. He paced back and forth in front of Sherlock, rambling to himself. “I had to...I had to…and look at
"Do what?" Sherlock asked.
The table was smoking from the hot kettle sitting on the bare bamboo surface. Sherlock’s face was burning. He twirled back and forth, unsure of which to tend to first.
He still had
Willis smiled. "Would you like me to teach you?"
"Oh." Sherlock deflated.
John. He was angry at everything. He was angry he was sitting here, taking the brunt of Harry’s well-justified hatred. He was angry that John betrayed his confidence and vented about him to Harry, telling her details of his life that wasn’t his business to spread around. He didn’t know where to start. He cleared his throat with effort, trying to get back on track. “And you’ve never
Mrs. Hudson lifted her chin. "Sherlock has every right to say what's in his heart," she defended. "He's a good boy." She marched up to Mycroft and jutted her index finger into his chest, looking none-too-pleased. "And I want to see him right now."
"Yeah." She sounded so tired.
? A normal life with a wife and kids and a house? Vacations and family reunions and Christmas mornings and showing people the pictures in your wallet?”
Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock looked over John. "I wish you were my brother. I wish I knew you my whole life. I wish you were around when I had difficult, frightening times so I could run into your room and spill my guts to you and listen while you say something spectacular and effortless and know in my heart you have my back. Because that's all I would ever need. I could do anything if you loved me. I could tell my mother and father how it really is. I could carry my head up high, tell every rotten kid who called me a freak that I'm not ashamed and mean it. Because I wouldn't be a freak. I wouldn't be a freak if I could just be myself for a minute. I bet I could laugh like this all the time if you were my brother. I bet it would always feel as good as it does right now."
"Why not? She'd deserve it!"
Sherlock spent the next ten years not thinking about John.
“I’m used to it,” John grunted petulantly. “Get it replaced before the weather turns cold?”
John paused.
His anger was ignited anew, thinking about it. That hypocrite! All that moaning about how ‘other people’ were undeserving of having kids. About how ‘other people’ devalued relationships, cheated on each other and were generally worthless.
She was slender, angular and tall, just like her sons, and John could see the other similarities immediately. It was apparent, not just from the sharp cheekbones or the flawless alabaster skin, but in her walk, in her solemn, dark ensemble and in the way she acknowledged no one, oozing money and entitlement.
John wanted to erupt at the blatant  unfairness of it all. He teetered on a thin edge between all-out  homicidal rage...rage at Sherlock for ruining his life, for destroying  any chance John had for a career, for alienating him from his friends  and colleagues and now poisoning his relationship with Sarah and also  for all the constant put-downs, the manipulation, the disregard for  human life and the deliberate and casual cruelty Sherlock was capable of  inflicting on people and for everything, for
And suddenly, Mycroft was there. Nobody saw him emerge or approach, just suddenly he was quickly walking through everyone's line of sight, making a beeline right for John. He reached down and grabbing John by the upper arm and shoving him around to face him. "I told you that you had one chance and that I wouldn't give you another," he said not angrily or impatiently, just authoritatively. "You're making me regret that I allowed you to come here. Do you understand that we heard everything you just said all the way in Sherlock's room? I think the whole hospital heard you."  He yanked a handkerchief from his breast pocket and thrust it into John's hands. "Wipe your face and turn around and don't. Say. Another. Word." He turned around in the direction he had come. "I'll see you out, Mummy."
Molly tried to think of something to say, but she couldn't think of anything.
She blinked. "
Sherlock curled his lip.  "You
Slowly,
Street lamps illuminated little islands of sidewalk and crumbling pavement over ancient cobblestone while the road was swallowed by darkness in either direction. Bare trees clawed the November sky against surging gray clouds and a sickly moon. The windows of the little white town houses across the street stared back at John, vacant and dark.  Dead leaves swept by the window as the wind kicked up.
"I'm not a child," Sherlock growled. "I don't need to be minded after."
His skin wasn't just pale anymore, it was translucent. John had to stop himself from counting the webbed, blue veins in his neck. His breaths were slow but shallow, and he'd lost weight. Too much weight. His skin was practically hanging from his bones, giving him a haggard, sick look. He was passive, but not peaceful. This isn't a state John would have mistaken for sleep. It's a state he would have mistaken for death.
"I'm leaving."
John laughed. “It’s alright,” he said. “Just bringing you your tea.” He held out a cup in his hands. Sherlock just stared at it.
Now, she wishes they were anywhere else. "You berk," she sighs softly, swiping under her eyes to catch the tears before they can fall. "You've made a big fat mess out of everyone, you know that?" She reaches for his hand again, and rubs the pad of her thumb along his knuckles. "You're always twelve steps ahead of everyone," she whispers. "You have a reason for everything, don't you?"
“I’ve waited long enough,” he bit back. “After you.”
for him to be sad and depressed…!" At  that moment, the driver pried John's hands off the door. "London's full  of blood stains and murder weapons and crime scenes and it's all waiting  for him! London is waiting for him!" Then the door slammed shut.
"No," Molly said more firmly and little louder. "I want to know what he means.

John thought, peering out the front door peephole.
Harry looked away wistfully. "I'm really not…ready to be a mom. It's not for me. I do want to look into my own kids eyes and have him or her look back at me and call me 'Mummy.' I think that's fair. Maybe a few weekends a month? An extended vacation now and again?"

John gestured frantically at nothing. "I've been sitting in the dark, waiting for you. Watching out the windows! Listening! Waiting for some government ops team or assassins or something to storm the flat a 'disappear' me and my daughter, wondering where you are. How did you get in my house without me hearing?"
"Why, thank you. I'm glad you see things my way."
Any other day, this would mean he had a case on the brain. But he didn’t.

He was so dumbstruck, it took him a moment to realize that someone was shouting.

"I am," John declared. "If I go through with this, I'm moving out."
baby.
The woman carried on, her emotions flaring. "And there's still hope. There's still hope for Sherlock…"
It looked unsettlingly real.
Sherlock unscrewed the cap. "Has…your life been that unhappy?"
John stood there, startled.
Sherlock frowned. He wasn’t particularly fond of the idea of John adding alcohol to his black mood. And alcoholism ran in John’s family, not that Sherlock had ever observed any addictive tendencies in John, but best to stop problems before they started. “I understand you’re upset. But don’t you think that having something to
"Yes, please."
Mycroft twisted his lips in a sour, non-committal expression to neither defend his brother or agree with him and John knew immediately that he was right.
John was curled up on the couch with Sherlock. He propped himself up on the arm, legs tucked under him, looking and feeling small, while Sherlock was draped over the length, head resting on John’s thigh, eyes closed and hands folded casually over his chest. He repositioned frequently, muttering. Rosie slept in the bassinet John dragged out of the closet. They were huddled together in one room like cavemen trying to wait out a predator lurking outside the den. John had his gun on the coffee table.
"I don't know why I
if he’d done any of it
Since John knew that  silent understandings are no substitutes for truth, he answered  Sherlock's unspoken question with a spoken, direct answer; "You're my  best mate and I'm glad you told me this."
With a sigh and slumped shoulders, Sherlock headed for the wash room to take a shower, muttering "Goddamn it, goddamn it," the whole way.
Nothing.
, as no human being could feel at home in these surroundings. Clearly the red represented the fires of hell. The chickens were burnt offerings. Appropriate. This was the place he'd come to barter for his soul.
When the coffee was finished and the clerks chased them out for "disruptive behavior," Sherlock and Molly laughed madly on the sidewalk, walking away. It had been an exhilarating day for them both.
But he never saw John.
"Everything is fine," Mycroft assured him (too quickly, too soothingly.) "There was a minor incident this morning with Sherlock. Its presently being sorted."

Both men were quiet. There was no light in the flat except the candle between them, held delicately in Sherlock's fingers.
Molly said,  gently turning over the bottle: "When I first started working here,  there was a string of arsons." Her eyes unfocused, her mind withdrawing  into the past. "There was this office building on fire. Maybe a dozen  people jumped from the roof to escape the flames. When we processed  their bodies, I remember how their hands and feet were charred black,  how the skin was split open from swelling. And I wondered…how long
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and wept.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "I wasn't excited."
“Its nothing,” John says sheepish, “I just scared myself is all. Coffee’s done.”

And I just can’t let you crush a little child like that, the way you crush fully-formed adults.” He looked at Sherlock sadly. “If you want to help me, fine, good. If you want to be the cool uncle or something, do that. I'm sure you'll be adored. But being a

Donovan shrugged. "Couldn't you and Molly…negotiate a time-share for the second bedroom?"

John ignored Sherlock.
John’s flesh and John’s muscles and John’s tendons and cartilage and bone, he was feeling it all, shoulder blades and vertebrae. Yet, he couldn’t help but making circles against John’s back. John was warm.
"Yes," Sherlock finally admitted. Then he frowned. "No." He looked up almost defiantly. "No, I didn't do it to hurt you. I didn't." He shook his head. "I mean, I knew it would hurt you. But I didn't do it
"I'm sorry?"
"Go on," the younger Sherlock urged, pressing his forefingers against his lips tensely, his mind at work, chasing the strands of information.
Mycroft chuckled into Sherlock's hair.
But it clicked. It all clicked.

Suddenly, John's intermittent-tremor hand spasmed.
"Time travel!" the man declared.

Sherlock remained unmoving, eyes hovering over the  microscope, the slide under the light empty of a sample. The dish  holding his slide had rattled slightly. He touched it gently, trying to  move his imaginary experiment back into place.
Sherlock turned around, his expression sagging and blank. He held his scrubbed-raw hands in front of himself, dripping water on the floor.
Really. John wasn’t to blame.

Sherlock looked down. “What do you mean?”
Willis balked. "What?"

thing John needed to adjust to:
Sherlock parted the blinds and looked out at the city. "Yes."
To  Sherlock's intense embarrassment, cruel rumors and nasty jokes began to  circulate at the New Scotland Yard at his expense, mostly due to the  not-nice word John had called Sherlock.
Sherlock had felt for John, experienced his frustration! Because that’s exactly how Sherlock felt!  He’d never wanted this…normalcy, this domesticity…because he’d never believed the lie of the ‘happy family.’ It wasn’t real, it didn’t exist. Spouses cheated. Children were ungrateful. The elderly were forgotten, left to languish and then they died. No one cared about each other. Families sucked. Sherlock never wanted a family.
John shouted, "
He didn't belong.

Harry said bitterly, “There’s this video on YouTube. Have you ever seen it? It’s a clip of an American soldier coming home from Iraq. There’s lots of them, but this one is particularly...well. The front door opens, and this little yellow dog comes rushing out and falls at this soldier’s feet, whimpering and squealing and kicking up a huge fuss, falling all over itself in excitement, scrambling to get into this guy’s lap. And he kneels down to pet her, going, ‘Dada’s home! Did you miss me?’ All the while, the wife is video taping it, crying.”

Sherlock’s eye lids fluttered. “There’s a broom closet at the end of this hallway. No, not there. Ugh. Embarrassing public school memories. Remind me to lock that door. Uh. There’s a dumbbell waiter. No. Nothing. Let me try this door.” He went quiet.
There was nothing except Rosie’s miserable cries.
For the next twenty years, Sherlock devoted himself entirely to the subject of time travel, which wasn't really time travel at all he discovered, and nothing at all what he expected. He imagined that time travel would involve building a machine or traveling through outer space at unheard of speeds and it wasn't like that, though he sat through many lectures from men younger than him who insisted that's what it
"John…" Sarah was beside him before he knew it.
Sherlock stood alone in the middle of the sitting room, surrounded by broken glass.
Mycroft's back went straight, his hands rose and his finger tips steepled. "Why did you come here to tell me this? Obviously, you two have managed to keep this quiet."
by how you're falling apart." She turned to face him with a dramatic spin, arms raised. "Become obsessed with one another and make it your new religion. Become shut-ins. Pick a Sabbath. Write and sing your own hymns, celebrate your own holidays and accuse people of intolerance when you disturb the public." She paused. "Sounds romantic. Falling apart." She was dressed in another ugly, cheap pant suit--a sunny yellow today, and a cheerful floral blouse with a ruffled neck, white kitten-heeled shoes. On a
"Greg," John said, reaching out for  Lestrade's arm. He gripped his sleeve. "It's okay. It really is okay. I  forgive you, if that's what you need to hear."
“What? Shambling corpses? From your mind palace?”
"You don't understand," John plead. "In the  beginning, I thought I was being sincere. I thought I was accepting. I  really looked at myself and I thought I was happy for Sherlock and I  could be the friend he needed. But I wasn't. I couldn't have been more  spiteful, more vicious. He depended on me." He looked miserably at  Lestrade. "I could march in there right now and promise Sherlock I'm  sorry and I want things to go back to the way they were and feel  completely honest. But I don't trust my own feelings. What if I turn on  him later? What if…it gets ugly again?"
"Get out,"  Mycroft ordered.

He stood naked in the shower, letting the hot, hot water sluice down his body. He teetered between despair, rage and giddy excitement.
"No talking."
Spectacular and effortless were not words  usually attributed by Sherlock to other people. And John was not  accustomed to hearing Sherlock praise or compliment him in any way. Love, also, was not a polite word a man used towards another man,  but Sherlock chose the word deliberately and said it with dignity and  confidence. Because it was now or never. Someone had to know.
Who can nurse on two beers all night….” John’s eyes popped open. He stopped speaking suddenly and began rocking back and forth. “Get out. Right now. Go away.”
“We’re making an effort to repair our relationship,” Harry said. “Now that mum and dad are dead, we don’t have the excuse of Christmas dinners to stay in touch anymore. We either have to work it out or drift apart. Thankfully, John has a lot to vent about. And I’m pretty good at maintaining eye contact and nodding.”
Sherlock drifted away from the door.

to be John's body, knew by the feel of the cardigan, by the button up, by the smell of John's aftershave.  John didn't move below Sherlock. John was wet. John was soaked with blood. John wasn't breathing. John wasn't suffering. Just a few more moments now.
John licked his lips and pointed at nothing. “This one?”
"Just as I thought," Sherlock huffed, finding a towel and drying his hands. "This isn't about you wanting to have sex, you want to do it because you think you

Sherlock's voice had  been so raw.
did you last talk to Sherlock?" John demanded, an edge in his voice, possessive and hungry. "Has he been hiding out with you? Do you have any idea what I've been going through, waiting for him to come back?"
A  minute later, he added:
"Okay," Lestrade said, stepping between them. "Why don't you two just relax?" He looked miserable. "This is absolutely not the time or place for…whatever this is."
John pressed, "Something morethan just the surrogacy?"
did."
He went out the front door of 221 Baker Street and walked down the steps into the busy London street, never to return.
Mrs. Hudson was resetting her kitchen clock when she heard a terrible “thud” directly above her head. The impact was so forceful that her china rattled. She looked up apprehensively, closing in on herself, waiting for the ceiling to cave in. When it didn’t, she scowled. “Boys!” she shouted angrily at the ceiling. “Stop experimenting up there!”

"His therapist? Ella?"
"Sherlock," Mycroft said. "I thought you were dead. I couldn't find you all day. I pulled every agent under my authority to search the city, comb your phone records, watch your bank account for any activity. I broke down the door of every dealer I know you've been to. I even went to mother's, hoping you might have gone home."
Molly crossed her arms defensively.
"People  are staring," Sherlock said. No one was staring now, it was all in  Sherlock's mind, but his skin crawled. "Please go home."
There was no wind. The curtains did not rustle in the breeze. There was no noise coming from outside. No howling wind, no skittering leaves, no distant hum of traffic or chirping insects. There was no faint outlines of backyard in the moonlight. Just black nothing, flat, unmoving, unearthly.
Lestrade spotted a taxi and raised his arm. "Can I confide something in you?"
Mycroft took the laptop from the table and handed it to Sherlock. "Take it. You have all the time you need and no distractions while you are here. That is, if you want to stay here."
On his way, he changed his mind several times. His mood swung wildly. He made plans to see Molly first thing in the morning and laugh like he had today, no regrets. He knew a shop that ground excellent exotic coffees and he could bring her a batch and they could enjoy it together.
"I mean. Yes," John admitted.  "I didn't think about all of that. And that might be true of other people. But with
Just at that moment, the lobby doors opened and everyone turned to see Molly Hooper walking quickly inside, looking rattled and rushed and surprisingly well-dressed in a white cotton suit. She looked at Mycroft with uncertainty and then at John, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson each in turn. "Oh. Um. Hi, everyone."

"He wrote a suicide note and he's gone and  nobody knows where he is and he's shot himself or he overdosed in some  rat hole somewhere or he jumped in front of a train, but he's gone. He  wrote a note. He wrote a note." He wasn't crouching anymore. He sank to  his knees, putting his hands on the ground, trying to center his weight,  but the whole universe was rocking and gravity wasn't working. He  heaved once, nothing coming up, but threatening to. "He wrote a note to

Sherlock stood up and went into the kitchen and returned with a glass which he handed to his older self. In the time he was gone, he saw that the other man had taken a moment to compose himself.  Older Sherlock then took a small sip and set down the glass on the coffee table. "Thank you."
Sherlock nodded.

Then Sherlock shaved. He barely needed it, so he made quick work of it. He combed his hair, patted it dry, tossing his head dramatically until his curls began to fall in a way that pleased him. He crouched under the sink and pulled out a bottle of fine hair gel, spritzed his comb and ran it through his hair again, parting it the way he preferred. From here, his locks would take care of themselves. He liked looking attractive and it pleased him that his routine was relatively effortless.
John  shrank back.

John asked, "What went wrong between you two?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Look, I'm not suggesting you couldn't raise a healthy, well-balanced child in a single-parent home. Successful, happy children emerge from all kinds of environments. But statistics prove again and again that children are happiest in two-parent homes regardless of whether the parents are a mother and father or two mothers or two fathers, so long as the parents are in a stable, healthy relationship. Why would you intentionally give yourself an unnecessary handicap when I am a perfectly capable adult, able to assist in child-rearing duties?"
, extraordinary fucking lives, who'd lived through war and plague and did Sherlock know any of them? No! They were dead and forgotten, their deeds and sins meaningless now, and John Watson was very, very close to becoming meaningless and forgotten because Sherlock was the only person who remembered John now and Sherlock was always just one bullet away, one bridge away, one overdose away from joining the billions and billions and billions of other dead, useless, worthless people. And there was no reason that John ought to be dead while Sherlock remained alive. Sherlock ought to be in the ground, too. And that was the tragedy of it. Sherlock deserved to die, but when he did, John would be gone,
She passed by.
Sherlock came out of his bedroom, hair limp and tousled, his dressing gown hanging open. He had a lit cigarette in his mouth.
Really, Sherlock knew he’d cocked everything up before he’d even started. God, this was a recipe for disaster. Before this was all over, everyone was going to be mad at him, he could tell, and all he wanted to do was make...John happy.
"Odd. You know everything." Sherlock folded his arms. "You even snoop through my text messages."

"If you want to talk about it…"
His fist clenched miserably.
Sherlock drummed his fingers impatiently. Then he laid sideways in the booth and glared at Molly. "Hey. Look at me."
Sherlock hugged his laptop. "Is John okay?"
John stared. He  had no clear memory of shoving Sherlock down the stairs. He didn't need  to. Sherlock had lovingly detailed the account in his notes.
Mrs. Hudson said, "I know that Sherlock doesn't think you're a 'thing.' He adores you."
detective.” She folded her hands on the table, studying Sherlock carefully as he was studying her. “You and John have lived together for almost two years and…I’ve never seen you. Except your picture in the papers.” There was an accusation hidden in her words.
"You came  of your own accord, you can leave if you're going to be disruptive."

like, one day.
"It has been deeply unhappy, yes."
Sherlock turned the water on and started vigorously washing his hands. Steam swirled around him. “They all just turned their heads and they’re looking at me.” Sherlock took the dish detergent and poured generously until half the bottle was empty, then dropped it in the sink. “I better not look at them.”
"But for
"As an adult, you concluded it wasn't the
Sherlock flinched. "God! No! I don't want anyone to know. I just wanted to tell John. I was satisfied just to have him know and have him accept me and have him keep my secret."
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and tapped his foot. "Well, I didn't mean for it to come out like that then, if that's how it sounded."
"Did you really put the moves on poor John Watson?"
Until now. Until John. John…Sherlock thought he was better somehow. He thought John was the exception. And without sex muddling it up, their family was going to be…pure. Purer than other families. Built on a foundation of genuine, selfless love and not the writhing of flesh against flesh or the stinking emission of fluids or the release of oxycodin and dopamine.
John continued to slink closer. Sherlock ended up backed up into the door, cornered with no escape, nose-to-nose with John. Sherlock was about to resolve to fight to restrain John, even if it meant hurting him, when John whimpered, “You want to have a baby with me.”
with him? Why? Why  did he feel this way? John knew he should have been happy that Sherlock  was trying to be a better friend. In the past, when they'd had  disagreements, they'd simply let issues drop, leaving wounds to fester,  usually leaving John in worse shape than Sherlock. Now Sherlock had  tried to be accommodating, tried to compromise. He'd tried to be human.  It just threw John into a rage.

"You had me at 'I like penis'.'" Molly dissolved in a fit of giggles. Her head sank into the table.
"John was very explicit about his motivations," Mycroft countered.
Sherlock tried to control his smile. He swallowed, pursed his lips. "Why don't we talk about it some more later?"

Sherlock was poised to cross the street, his leg already extended mid-step, but he spun in the other direction with a violent twist, fists clenching angrily. “God fucking damn it!” he shouted at nothing and nobody, though two middle-aged women strolling by paused to gape at him before hurrying along. Sherlock stomped off directionlessly before whirling to glare back at 221 Baker Street.
a sad by-product of school yard name calling. Those years, as unpleasant as they were, don't define me in any way as an adult and it certainly doesn't have anything to do with what's happening now."
"It's a valid desire either way," Sherlock assured John. "To reproduce and procreate…."
"Get a therapist," Harry countered.
However, Molly's face was still unchanged. She was stiff, her face blank. She had an expression like she'd just been crossing a dark parking lot and a stranger came out from behind a car to hit her up for her number and wouldn't let her leave. She looked at John like he was an unassessed threat. Regardless of what he might say, whatever smooth line he might use, she didn't believe his intentions were good. All her instincts screamed at her to run. Or fight.
God save Molly Hooper, the patron saint of lost causes.
She angrily pointed behind her, in Sherlock's direction. "He's sick! My son is sick. And he's a drug addict on top of it all…!"
to us." Suddenly, John's face was awash with guilt. He glanced away briefly to gather himself and when he spoke to Mycroft again, his eyes were fixed at some distant point. "Sherlock and I would be crushed if…this didn't happen."
"So, you want me to come over and be a guinea pig?"
John stared at Mycroft, his smile fading. "What?"
he thought.
Sherlock muttered impatiently, "I'm
John. We aren’t lovers.”
John looked straight ahead. "How can you see this a bad  thing? Sherlock is safe and sound. He's in a hospital. He's being
"Look," Lestrade said, pointing towards the patients' corridor.
"My friend has been dead for fifteen years," Sherlock explained numbly. "He was murdered."
The other Sherlock listened without interrupting.
John  said, "
Harry said, “Fuck ‘em all. And I wish them well. I’m not going to be held hostage because other people are selfish. I wish everyone well, including myself. I wish everyone had the capacity to forgive, even if they don’t deserve it, because I’m sure I’ve fucked someone over at some point, too, and I hope they forgive me. I hope I’ve never casually ruined someone else’s life because I was stupid or thoughtless.”
John kissed Rosie’s hair. “Shh, shh. Its okay.”
"Sherlock," John sighed. "That's not the point." He followed Sherlock towards the front door. "Besides. Um. There's something I need to tell you. Something strange happened to me today."
Sherlock blinked. “What? What is it?” Had she figured it all out, just sitting there?
Sherlock looked horrified.
Molly said, "Pretending to be straight isn't going to make you feel better. Pretending can't make you straight."
Sherlock stared at him in awe. "I just started building a Mind Palace last week. I haven't even told Mummy about it yet."
"Does it matter?"
The Doctor walked into the consul room, holding a small bundle in his arms. He wasn't angry, not the way Rose was, but his blank face and silence resonated in the room with a crushing gravity. The Doctor was never really quiet. He always had something to say, a fact to deliver, or a reassurance to share. Now, as he knelt in front of Sherlock and took a wet, sterile wipe to his son's arm, he said nothing. Sherlock couldn't look at him.
"Rose," he tried again, a bit louder.
"Hey Sweetheart," the memory said, running her free hand through his hair as though she were addressing a young child instead of a grown man. "Do you want to talk?"
"Sherlock!" she shouted suddenly. He jumped out, fists balled and ready for a fight if there was something dangerous around. Rose crossed her arms. "Where is my pie, Sherlock?"
John furrowed his brow. "It's me, Doctor. John Watson. We met a week ago."
John spun around, enough anger on his face to make even Sherlock stop talking. "I don't know why, I really don't, but after everything that's happened with Moriarty, and Baskervilles, and the cabbie, I actually thought we were friends."
"Okay," John said finally about an hour later. "Aliens are real."
"Look at that," John grinned. "A footprint. Already. You were right."
Sherlock seemed to wince, only for half of a second, but John caught it.
He emptied out a small compartment under the TARDIS floor, then closed it, not going near it for several weeks. In fact, the family didn't travel at all for those weeks. The TARDIS sat alone in the yard, just out of sight. Rose kept asking him why they were living so linearly, but he told to wait just a bit longer. He wanted to be sure his plan would work before he explained it.
"Um… Sherlock is…well—"
"I know. I know, Sweetheart. This is partly my fault, so I'm going to fix it."
"You and I both know that half-Time Lords age mentally very fast. I understand what you're talking about. You're telling John that he has to keep quiet about Mum and Dad, but that's obvious. He's smart, like us. He knows he shouldn't go telling people about aliens, they'd lock him up. You just like to scare people."
Jackie smirked with a knowing look. "Little jealousy problem?"
"Oh," the Doctor said, "Uncle Jack says hello, by the way."
"John!" Sherlock said, grabbing his arms to stop him. He said nothing for a long moment.
"Camping trip!" the Doctor screamed next to the bed.
"Weeping angels have to feed. They take human lives, in a way, and who better to take than chimney sweeps? Tramps, beggars, prostitutes, anyone that old London town would never miss ends up in here. Plenty more where that came from."
"More than once," Rose said, hopping up onto the counter and munching on a biscuit. "She's a sweet lady. Do you want one?" she asked offering him the tin.
"I'm not changing the subject, I'm answering you," Sherlock said with a frustrated growl. He stalked over to the box and felt around the top of it for a moment, then pulled down a key. He fumbled with the lock for a moment, then slipped into the box and closed the door behind him.
"I'm getting older. Mycroft too. You and Daddy never get older. The logical progression would mean that Mycroft and I are going to die."
"No," he said, a lopsided grin on his face. "This is…this is amazing."
"Morning, Sherlock," she said, careful not to let him think her smile was anything more than a greeting. He'd been insisting on dressing himself the last month or so, but for such a clever boy he had a child's sense of clothing. "Have you been helping Daddy with the trip?"
"A few hours every couple days. I think I've eaten. John hasn't yelled at me at least, so he must have seen me have something."
They had followed the dirt trail for only a few minutes before they found the muddy stream. There was an indent in the mud where the chimney sweep had fallen. Sherlock examined the muddy pit, determining which direction the man had been running from.
The door to the room opened, and a memory walked through. It was his mother, smiling, bright-faced, in an old Union-Jack tee-shirt he remembered from his childhood. She walked up to him, placing a delicate hand on his shoulder.
Rose shrugged, finding a warm outfit already laid out for her. One thing she'd come to be used to since running away with the Doctor was being ready to go somewhere on a moment's notice. He'd slowed down a bit once Mycroft was born, but she supposed that now that the boys were getting a little older things had been picking up a bit.
"You…you have a jacket by the door. It looks like it's your size. There's a little metal disc sticking down from the pocket. It's too big to be a watch, besides, the look of your computer over there means we're probably in the early 21st century. By that time most people just got their time from their phones. Balance of probability says it is probably the end of a stethoscope. Only doctors carry stethoscopes."
"You know why," she said softly, trying to let her voice sound soothing. "Daddy is from a place where people don't sleep very much, and Mummy is from a place where people sleep every night. You fall somewhere in the middle."
Mycroft smirked. "This has nothing to do with the greater good of Britain, I'm afraid, but nonetheless it does have to do with security. Am I to understand that you met our parents last week?"
"I can't tell you just yet, but I think you'll find out tonight."
Sherlock grimaced, touching the man's face experimentally. "I don't like it. Can you change back?"
Sherlock didn't answer at first. He looked away from John, suddenly finding the floor very interesting. "Uh, texting. Any time before this you would be expected to call, or not have a telephone at all. I prefer to text."
"John, has anyone ever told you that you look like a hedgehog?"
"Why?" he asked. "Am I going to fall? There's no gravity in space, John, there's only the field that pulls things toward the TARDIS and keeps others away from it. I used to sit on the roof to read. I'm just as safe as you are in there."
Sherlock huffed slightly, and she patted him on the leg as she followed the Doctor into the TARDIS.
"That doesn't seem long enough," Sherlock said after a pause.
"Maybe Redbeard got ahold of it."
John frowned, seeing the mess his flat mate had left on the table. "I suppose so."
"No sleeping just yet!" the Doctor said suddenly, swooping Sherlock up off the ground and carrying him to the spread out blankets. "Lots to do."
Sherlock looked up, peering through the trees to see the simple brick house not fifty yards from the stream.
The Doctor stared at the boy. "Cake? Really, of all the words in every language…"
Sherlock pounded loudly on the door to the house, peering into the dusty windows. No light shone from within, and the whole place had the smell of being utterly abandoned. When no one had answered in five minutes, Sherlock kicked open the door, holding the side of his coat over his mouth as the dust rushed out to meet them.
"Sherlock," John snapped, grabbing the man's hand. "Thank you for bringing us here. You may want to alert more…proper authorities so that they can alert the man's family, maybe try to conduct their own investigation."
The Doctor nodded sadly, gently taking his arms and examining them. "I didn't think you had relapsed. Really, that's not why we're here. We've just missed you boys."
"Besides we already have a destination," the Doctor said offhandedly.
"We've been looking for you," the Doctor said incredulously. "We've been trying to visit you for six months, Sherlock. Every time, every single time we tried to contact you, there was something else going on. Did you think no one was watching? Mycroft knows you've been visiting those…places. You've been missing from your flat for a week. We've walked through every drug den in London for days, trying to find you!"
"This is a bad idea," Sherlock said.
The boy nodded, looking at John with a suspicious glint in his eye. "Who are you?"
Rose tapped him on the chin lightly. "You sound like me, in the early days. You and me. Cardiff and Jack and Mickey. You remember that?"
"How do you know?" Their client asked, mesmerized.
The Doctor chuckled, looping his finger through hers just as her cellphone started to ring. "You may want to watch that. The people of the eighteenth century were not quite ready for selfies and Angry Birds."
"Oh, yes," she beamed. "Lovely woman. Been keeping well?"
"Don't see why not. You look like you need one, honestly."
"Are those beakers?" he asked suddenly, peering sheepishly into the kitchen.
"You're not even that kind of a Doctor. Besides, I haven't been sick a day in my life."
The knock came again, more insistent this time. John rushed to the door, already making an excuse.
BREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAK
Their client cleared his throat. "Can I help?"
"What do they look like?" he bellowed at the young man. "Do they look human?"
Mycroft nodded, hopping off of her lap and scurrying out of the kitchen.
The Doctor grinned at John shaking his hand. "And wonderful to meet you, Dr. Watson."
Rose cradled the side of his face, a deep sadness in her eyes mixed with amazement. "You really don't know. You don't see yourself, do you?"
She pulled some of his unruly hair out of his face. "I know, I know. Do you want to go to sleep soon?"
He waited a moment. "Well? What about?"
As soon as they were alone she turned to him, one side of her mouth pulled up in the way that he hated. It was the smile that means 'I know I'm right, Sherlock'. He shifted uncomfortably, turning away from her.
"We also went to the Diamond planet last year on your birthday," the Doctor reminded her. "Cooking just isn't my forte. Mycroft," the Doctor repeated, shaking his foot gently. "Look at Daddy."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. "Prove it."
"Come on, your Dad will be here any minute," John tried to remind him.
"God," John breathed, sinking to the floor. "We almost… God."
"Leaving me to think you couldn't possibly be interested in someone as dull as me. I was afraid to tell you that I loved you, because I thought you'd just get rid of me to save us both the embarrassment. I couldn't just leave you, because life without you was miserable, but I couldn't last forever pretending that I didn't want more. That's where Sherlock is right now. He could never stand to lose John, but my baby is miserable. I trust John. If he can't love him back…he won't abandon him. I'm sure."
"Um, Doctor, this is not the future. Right place, wrong century."
"I think you'll like this one," he said pulling the ship to a quick landing. "Stay right there, I'm going to make sure it's safe."
"I should have a cot somewhere," the Doctor assured him. "If you prefer you can sleep in the TARDIS tonight."
Sherlock giggled a bit before he remembered that pirates don't giggle and quickly stopped. The worms squirmed around in his hand while the Doctor struggled with untangling the fishing lines. The day was beginning to wane—they'd spent a few hours splashing around in the other side of the lake. Mycroft sat on the bank next to them in a dark hoodie that was too hot for the humid climate, his line already in the water. Rose sat a few yards behind them in a chair in the shade, having elected not to squat in the mud again.
"If we wanted to move from place to place he insisted on being carried. He said if he stood on anything but a boat or the sand he would lose his sea legs and have to start all over again. Thank goodness we could convince him that the TARDIS was just as wobbly as any ship in the ocean—"
"Oh no!" Sherlock cried, sinking into a pout on the chair as the little blue box appeared. As soon as the Doctor opened the door he was in front of it, shaking his head vigorously. "Dad, I'm not ready to leave! I want to stay here with John for a while! Please?"
"I know, I know," the Doctor sighed. Every day for a month the boys had been having the same argument. Mycroft wanted his privacy more than ever and his brother seemed incapable of letting him have it. "He just wanted to spend some time with you, it's a good thing."
"Well, I have. This was literally child's play for me. Grasping the concept of the universe, exploring different times, accepting the ends of things, that was remedial stuff I learned along with shapes and colors. Honestly anyone who steps foot on the TARDIS and acts like it's mesmerizing looks incredibly dull to me. The science behind it is rather obvious when you think about it hard enough."
"Lie about what?"
"It's affecting my life, Sherlock. You don't even know, do you? It's like you're not even human half the time. There are two strangers in my flat who know all these things about you that I've never heard about. You all talk in riddles, and when I try to understand you shoot me down. I've been the dunce in the corner since they arrived…"
The Doctor looked back and saw Sherlock standing very still behind him. The boys eyes were red and tears were starting to pour from them. He was staring hard at the newcomer, a look of deep concentration on his face. The Doctor seemed to understand because he ran back to his son and got down to his eye level, whispering so quietly not even Rose or Mycroft could hear him.
"Do whatever Dad says, even if it doesn't make any sense."
Mycroft sighed. "You're right," he said, giving into the logic of a child. "Nemo must be a special fish."
He sighed again, rubbing his face. "Mum, I'm sorry, this isn't a big deal—"
"Not surprising," the man mumbled from his little nest.
Castiel looked apologetically at him. “I’ve been trying to fly to you for an hour, but I keep finding myself in the wrong continent. There’s something wrong with this land, it’s like it’s warded against everything. I wanted to warn you,” he glanced toward the Doctor, “but it seems I’m too late.”
"Started with what?"
"Clean hands?"
"Doctor, up here!" Rose called from behind Sherlock. "Boys, I can see them both."
"That's why people fish, stupid."
He frowned. "No."
"Pretty much resolve themselves," the Doctor grinned. "Things have a weird way of working out, even if you stick your nose in another decade's business."
"Well, I was going to. It was going to be our Honeymoon spot, but I know you wanted some adventure. I figured we'd go some day as a surprise, but then we had the boys and I wanted them to be able to understand what they were seeing."
Nothing prepared him for the young blonde woman who eased open the door to Sherlock's room and peeked her head out into the hall. Her eyes fell on the two patiently waiting men and she smiled, a warm sparkle behind her brown eyes.
The boy frowned. Of course he knew it was a lie, this was Sherlock after all. "Where's your room, John?"
"He's gorgeous," Jackie said, leaning back in her chair at the table in her flat. "Look at those eyes."
John fought against a smile. "He's right though, Mycroft. I wouldn't tell anyone. Your family is safe."
He imagined the same would apply to banana cream.
"You have people to trust," Mycroft insisted. "That's what the list is for. I know how to get into the Sontaran mainframe, Dad."
"Well, I'll go grab a bit of change, then," he said, trying to rush deeper into the TARDIS.
"Mycroft and Sherlock Tyler," Jackie shook her head.
"It's our family photo," the boy beamed. "John…do I live here? Do I live here with you?"
"I never idolized Mycroft."
"Because I'm me. I'm an asshole. Aggravating. A freak. An alien. I'm thrilled that he doesn't seem to want me to move out, even after what he's seen today, but that's more than I ever dared to…" he trailed off. "John will find someone better, and I'll be happy for him. I just hope he lets me see him every now and then. That's all I want."
"Half Time Lord, yes," Sherlock said. Leaning back against the consol.
Molly chuckled. "Leaving our patient to spend time with your wife again? I swear he gets jealous when you go home early."
Who was he?
She shook her head. "You still don't believe I'm his mother."
"The Thompson Savings and Loan. You know exactly where it is, despite the fact that it existed a hundred years before you were born."
Mycroft snorted. "Older. John, I assume this means you know quite a lot, yes?"
"John was just on his way out," Sherlock lied quickly. "He has to be to work soon."
She stared at him. "What, Baby?"
Sherlock turned and looked at the door. "I can just leave? I don't think I can, John. The case isn't finished. You have to take me outside."
"Mummy!" he called.
“We had it wrong,” Castiel said, shaking his head, “this is my fault. I was looking through the pictures again and I saw it. This man has a TARDIS. They only come from one place, and it’s not hell. I seriously doubt he has any connection to the recent deaths.”
"Go?" John asked.
"The Doctor," John said, pointing at him, "he is an alien."
John waited for a long moment, then he finally rolled his eyes and pulled open the door. "Hiding from me won't change the fact—"
John sipped at the pint in his hand, staring dumbfounded at the scene before him. Old pals and new enemies sat around tables in the pub, arguing and laughing and belching in the fashion of a workingman just off of his shift. Some part of his mind was insisting that these people weren't really from the past. This was just a game, a role-play they had all agreed to assist in. It could be one of Sherlock's experiments—how far-fetched is too far-fetched for John Hamish Watson? It was believable, Sherlock had tricked him for the sake of science before.
He placed the paper in the Doctor's hands, pointing down the street with the other. "It's a business card," he announced, "for the Thompson's Savings and Loan. It's about four blocks that way, where the little restaurant Sarah Jane Smith likes with the chips will be one day. Do you remember the street?"
"I've found him!" she called back into the room. "Right flat, wrong room." She ran forward and pulled the tall detective into a tight hug.
He sighed, watching her skip away to the wardrobe. His mother had made 'decisions' in the past, and he'd never seen her fall through on one. Not once.
She was about to grab him before he woke up Sherlock, but the dog just hopped onto the boy's bed and laid down next to his side. Sherlock's hand came up absently and rested on the animals head, his eyes still closed. "Night, Redbeard," he mumbled.
The Doctor did sleep that night; not for very long, but he slept. For one night, everyone in the family slept at the same time. It didn't happen often, but that was okay with them. They were strange, but it was a wonderful strange.
The boy thought a moment. "This is the TARDIS, and there's only one of those. Mum told me once, about how Time Lords can change. Are you…are you Dad?"
Mycroft grinned, giving Sherlock a quick hug before running back out into UNIT to help a very resistant Rose.
Sherlock leaned in closely so that only the two of them could hear him. "Mother, I'm going to need some time alone with John if your little ultimatum is going to be met."
There was the pattering of small feet, and then suddenly the young Sherlock was right in the middle of the living room, peering up at the middle-aged Mycroft. The man jumped, looking down in complete shock.
"I think I recognize this place," Sherlock murmured. "It'll be an office building someday. A secret one, of course. Mycroft keeps his more private meetings in the middle of bloody nowhere. He's such a drama queen."
"What do you see?"
Sherlock smiled, still trying to calm down. "Mycroft got my note then?"
"Sherlock."
"Barely," the familiar voice crackled out of the other end. "What year are you in?"
A voice rang out around him again. "Sherlock! Sherlock!"
"You have to make it convincing. Grieve with them. You can do that, Molly, there's plenty you can think of to be sad about."
"Oh," Molly adjusted the phone against her ear and there was a pause before she said, "He's sitting at one of the tables. Looks like he has a headache or something. His eyes are closed, and he's got his fingers pressed against his temples. Is he okay? Like is this...normal?"
Sherlock's throat was closing. "This is real?"
“Dr. Hooper, are you alright?”
John's murderous glare, previously saved only for Mycroft, now harrows in on Greg. "He jumped," he tells him, voice unapologetically cruel. "Right off the bloody roof, made me watch the whole thing. You know what he said?" John does not give Greg an opportunity to answer. "Said to tell you it was all true. That he really was a fraud. Congratulations, Detective Inspector, looks like you were right."
“It’s not the same,” he said. “It doesn’t feel right. This isn’t right.”
It was too much. Sensory overload and he couldn't decode what was happening. John finally pulled back and gripped Sherlock with his strong, steady hands. It was only then that he realized he'd been trembling. "What's happening?" And he must have been crying as well, something was dripping from his chin and he didn't know if it was his tears or John's but it didn't matter. Nothing mattered but John.
"And despite what you think, I do have people over sometimes, so if anyone calls you'll have to -"
"Wait him out?" John repeated. "While he torments himself in a godforsaken memory prison?"
Long, pale fingers squeeze back.
He did not enjoy sentiment.
Tea. That was right, wasn’t it? They’d been discussing something in the living room, and John had suggested tea. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “That was quick,” he noted. John rolled his eyes.
He decided to probe. "Do you know what day it is?"
Molly sighs and crosses her arms over her chest. "Right," she says. "Well, when should I call John? He'll need some sort of explanation before you just go prancing back to your flat -"
Despite it all, Molly tries to hide her smile. "Nothing," she muses. "Nothing at all."
Molly unwillingly lets go of Sherlock. John stands in her place, one hand on each of Sherlock's shoulders. "Bloody idiot," he murmurs, but the words are said with such love that the bite from them is gone. Molly wonders how John can see anything through the thick veil of tears.
"Isn't there always?"
But he’d never seen him like this.
Sherlock swallows hard. She watches his Adam's apple bobble nervously in his throat. He blinks at her too fast. "It's for his own good."
"Mike," John sighed. "Where in God's name are we going?"
Sherlock crossed the room in two long strides and wound his arms around John. "But I'm right here, John."
"You're here," John whispered into his lapels. "Thank God you're alright."
Sherlock ignores the comment and shimmies out of his Belstaff. The coat falls to the floor in an inglorious heap, and Sherlock pushes himself out of the gurney on unsteady legs. Despite her anger, Molly still reacts to help when he sways and has to lean against the counter. "I'm fine."
Sherlock looked at John expectantly. The smile they shared was inappropriate and deranged and brilliant.
Another wave of misery crashed over Sherlock's body and he gasped, which had John's focus pinned on him in an instant. For a second, they just looked at each other. Sherlock, for once, was speechless. All the small changes, the new creases in his skin and the scar on his temple and the cracks in his lips, made John almost unrecognizable. These, of course, were the only things Sherlock was able to catalogue before he was smashed against John's shoulder, breathing in a scent he thought he'd memorized but God, he hadn't. Every familiar smell before now paled in comparison to this.
Sherlock couldn't feel his own body. He didn't know where his voice was coming from. "You're not," he choked. "You're dead, you were blown up in Afghanistan, they called Mycroft and -"
Sherlock was about ready to tell John what he could do with that phone if he had a mind to, but the familiar footfalls of Mrs. Hudson kept him quiet. Mycroft might not have set up his equipment to spy on him yet, but he doubted if his landlady would feel comfortable letting a madman live in her apartment. And talking to people who weren't there qualified - to some - as madness. "Sherlock?" she called, and she was very close to the door now. She swung it open with a flustered smile. "Sherlock, there's a man at the door for you, he says he's with the," she lowered her voice to a whisper. "With the police."
John would have loved this place, he decided. The central nervous system of London, right in the middle of everything. The landlady, Mrs. Hudson, she'd make all over him just like she did Sherlock. They would have the master bedroom on the first floor, and maybe turn the one upstairs into a lab so Sherlock's experiments wouldn't be all over the kitchen table. But John wouldn't mind either way. He would have gotten a kick out of it. Eyeballs in the fridge, skin samples on the duvet. Corrosive acids in the toilet. John would make a big show of pretending to be annoyed, but they'd laugh about it later. They always did.
The seventeen steps it took to reach Sherlock’s door were the longest of John Watson’s life, made longer by the cane he was forced to use. The distinct walking pattern wouldn’t go unnoticed by Sherlock, and John half-expected to see the younger man meet them at the halfway point. But his door remained stubbornly closed.
John John John John -
His voice was muffled by the material of John's jumper, but John must have understood nonetheless. He laughed between the tears, still refusing to let Sherlock go. "You git," he murmured. "You've no idea what's going on, do you?"
"Dr. Watson!"
John tilted his chin so that they were facing each other. He swallowed, and Sherlock watched his Adam’s apple bob beneath the tiny hairs on his throat, and dear God, how was this not real? “Then you know what you have to do,” John said. Sherlock’s heart plummeted.
"My flat, smart-arse."
John giggled, the same giggle he often used when he was laughing at something inappropriate. "What's the matter with you?"
John didn't turn around, but simply repeated, "Please, just come back to me."
John raised an eyebrow. “Out there?”
“Yes,” Sherlock whispered. “Here is much better.”
She’s suddenly very aware of the other people still in the room. She catches one of them mid-explanation. “ - just outside, actually. Someone said he jumped off the roof, God knows how he got up there.”
"Molly, you have to relax, and I'll -"
This time, John's chuckle was warm and highly amused. "Right," he murmured against Sherlock's neck. "Great work convincing him that you're okay."
"Just wake up, you idiot," John stammered. "Wake up and come back to me."
Though it was more a rasp, Sherlock finally managed, "What?"
Mycroft strolled behind the couch and patted Sherlock’s curls with more compassion than John ever imagined him capable of. “Come sit,” Mycroft said, nodding to the vacant seat beside Sherlock. “You won’t wake him. He’s not asleep.”
Sherlock distinctly remembered punching his brother in the face, but his knuckles weren’t bruised. He remembered the needles and the sweet, burning relief as the drugs teased his veins, but his forearms were as pure and innocent as they’d never been in his life. Absentmindedly, he brushed his nails along the pale skin, bridging the gap between the radius and the ulna. He sighed through his nose.
The second she's free of him, she throws her arms around his neck and presses her nose into his hair. He's a statue beneath her, every muscle taut, every movement stiff. But Molly doesn't care. Sherlock is here, and he's alive, and -
“You turned his own bloody brain against him!” John’s cries are quickly growing louder, his face is carved from stone and breaking apart all at the same time. “You know what - you know what he said to me, at the end? That he was a fake! Tell me, Mycroft, who could have given him that idea? You and I both know - but he was convinced, and he asked me - he asked me to -” John broke down then, sinking to his knees, pressing his hands into the cold floor.
“Like I said,” Mycroft muttered. “I should probably prepare you.”
"Will you come?"
John kissed Sherlock’s knuckles one at a time, those lips like a whisper against his skin. Sherlock trembled.
“In there,” Sherlock corrected. “I…misspoke.”
John's laughter played with his hair and twisted his insides. "What'd I tell you?" he smirked. Sherlock shook his head and John's image disappeared in wisps of smoke.
"Right," he smiled. He was happy. Far too happy. "Hey," he seemed to remember something, and Sherlock knew what it was before he said a word. "Given anymore thought to the position I told you about?"
"He was what?" Lestrade asks, looking back and forth between Sherlock and John.
John's close relationship to his friends makes Sherlock insecure and he can admit to that. But he's only been home four months and for most of that he's barely caught a moment to breathe. Meeting John's cozy little group of friends hasn't been high on the list of things to do. He knows how important it was to John that Sherlock attend this party. Knowing Gerald will be there is even worse—Sherlock won't be able to stop himself from comparing the two of them and tallying up all the ways in which Gerald is better.
, breath coming rapid, forced out of him. "Christ, when I look at you, I can't believe you just—you fucking gorgeous creature, you're like drugs used to be, I can't get enough."
Of course, Gerald is last. Everyone holds their breath as Sherlock stiffens when John introduces them. There is a brief staring contest as they size each other up. Sherlock softens first, puts out his hand. So quietly only John and Gerald can hear, he says, "Thank you for loving him when I couldn't," and John gulps over the lump in his throat.
, of course, it were an accepted practice. The article is titled "Why Did Men Stop Wearing High Heels?" on the BBC News website.
"Tell me what you want," Sherlock says, lowering his head to lick along the waistband of John's pants. "You can have anything you want from me."
"And that makes you feel guilty, I suppose."
After they're cleaned up, John puts on corduroy trousers and a blue button up shirt, looking shabby next to Sherlock's tight, black, fine wool trousers and a crisply pressed blue shirt.
"Sorry," Gerald says.
"Hand me the bottle," Gerald says, nodding at the bottle of lube.
John looks up at Sherlock, his eyes dark and wet, his lips swollen, saliva trailing from his mouth to Sherlock's sheathed cock and back to John's chin in a skinny triangle of spit that catches the light, and Sherlock has a brief vision of John wearing nothing but Sherlock's Belstaff and red high heels, but his brain gets rid of that thought, too, as Sherlock's orgasm begins to gather in his groin. He recalls John's request that Sherlock come on his face, but in an uncharacteristic fit of shyness, decides not to remind him.
Tate rushes to chivvy Sherlock out of the office as he and Bradley stare daggers at each other.
Sherlock has spent the last ten minutes rapidly coming to the conclusion that if he tells John he was raped then it will be months, many long months, before Sherlock could convince John he was well enough, emotionally and physically, for a sexual relationship. In fact, John would probably require a signed affidavit from a trained professional in rape recovery stating Sherlock was sufficiently over his trauma to give informed consent before he did so much as touch Sherlock.
Sending my whole world crashing down around me
"Fucking Shakespearean tragedy, that," John jokes. "Well, minus the dying part."
He mostly feels numb and that stumbling stupidity that he had when he got shot. He's confused. Nothing makes sense but that's okay. He's grateful for it right now. He's not ready to feel anything. He's tired. He wants to sleep but he's afraid he'll wake up and the numbness will have gone away.
"I just don't know what to say to Gerald," John says.
John, it turns out, needs no reminding. He yanks the condom off of Sherlock's cock, flicks it onto the floor, and then takes it in hand, his thumb and forefinger teasing Sherlock's foreskin. Sherlock's toes begin to curl, and his arse clenches, while his hips try to thrust his cock into a nonexistent hole. John sits back on his knees, tilts his face up to the ceiling, exposing the whole long column of his throat, and his thumb and forefinger go up, down, up again, and
"Rebecca suggested I bribe you to go by offering to fulfill your sexual kink. If you had one, that is."
Approximately seventy gajillion words written (that number may be technically inaccurate)
All seemed to be going well with Sherlock's teething troubles when he and John went to bed on Thursday night. But shortly after midnight, John woke to the sound of coughing and retching. Before he could get Sherlock to the bathroom, the poor dragonet started vomiting. Once he stopped, John snatched him up and took him to the bathroom and laid him on the tile floor. John stripped out of his pajamas, which were stained with vomit, and tossed them into the corner. He was about to head into the bedroom to strip the soiled sheets when he looked more closely at Sherlock.
Speaking of last night, what did it mean? John has a tendency to treat uncomfortable situations in which he is involved as though they didn't happen. When it involves other people, though, he can gossip like a little old lady.
"Look, if this is about what I said—"
Cold discomfort (example: 20 min cold shower)
"Dr. John Watson?" the man said, coming all the way into the room until he was only a yard away from where John sat in his chair, his palm resting on Sherlock's feverish egg. The man had eyes only for the egg and he glared at John's hand. "My name is Mycroft Holmes. I'm here to pick up the egg."
jealous), he can't help but feel deeply grateful to Gerald for teaching John how to suck cock. The entirety of the front of Sherlock's pants is soaked with John's saliva. A breathy, barely-there moan rides each of Sherlock's exhales. He's so embarrassingly close to finishing, and he hasn't even taken off his pants! He tries to remember the last time he had an orgasm, and vaguely recalls several nights of debauchery in Abu Dhabi about nine months ago. Surely, he brought himself off at some point in the intervening time, but he honestly can't recall. Once he entered eastern Europe, it was night after day after night of little sleep, food snatched and eaten on the go, contacts and safe houses increasingly few and far between until the thirteenth of February when—
Tucked into Blaine’s flat front khakis is a button-down shirt in aubergine. Underneath he wears a plain white t-shirt. His cuffs are rolled to his forearms. Black monk straps with a double buckle complete the ensemble. A boiled wool coat in navy is thrown over the back of his barstool. It’s January, and even New Orleans is subject to the cold grasp of winter. Blaine’s clothes show his body to its best advantage without being fussy.

or not.)
It's meant as a tease, and the words are out before John can consider the implications. Gerald's eyes widen and then drop to the floor. John doesn't need words to interpret what Gerald's thinking.
John shakes his head. "I thought he was in Denmark." When Rebecca makes a noise of skepticism, John says, "I swear!" but he can't help but laugh—laugh at Rebecca's fierce-fake anger, laugh with joy that the man he loves is here, finally, surrounded by all the other people John loves.
"Theething? Whath tha' mean?"

Good morning, my love. I have a long list of things I need you to pick up before you come over.
"Of course, but I had to stay out of sight until every single one of Moriarty's operatives was sussed out and detained. My options were either hiding out in the countryside slowly going insane or going along on the missions. I made my decision in part because I didn't trust myself to, well—to stay away."
attachment to my best friend, I mean that I have become a hindrance to his happiness, and while happiness is not a state I attempt to achieve on anything like a regular basis, I would do anything within my power to ensure John's happiness."
"The thing is," Gerald says carefully. "I don't do sex-only relationships. I'm not - I don't get
"Nope," John says, interrupting him. He shakes his head back and forth slowly while staring at the ceiling. "C'mon, Sherlock, put those mad deductive skills to work."
Chatsworth had reassured John multiple times that dragons didn't eat people. In fact, dragons only ate in their dragon form after they hatched from their egg until they could put on their human skin.
John sighs deeply, and says, "Just ten more days, Sherlock; you can do it." When Sherlock doesn't say anything, John looks up. Sherlock is staring at him with an intensity that only Sherlock can, his eyes wicked and dark, a thin line of grey-green around his pupils.
and John stares, open-mouthed. Sherlock kisses his mouth closed, and goes to fetch the numerous broadsheets and tabloids they're subscribed to, and that Mrs. Hudson kindly leaves on their landing if she's up before them. He and John have their tea and toast in bed while Sherlock reads the crime reports and obituaries out of habit, and John does the daily crossword and Sudoku, leaving them both unfinished in favor of a shower, which Sherlock invades.
"I feel like I'm lecturing you, but I've never been involved with someone who was straight for their entire life."
. Hurry up," and sits down, leaning back against the headboard, toying with the red lube launcher, which John finds far more arousing than funny at this point.
"Oh," Sherlock says, sitting up straighter, pleased with himself, though there isn't a logical reason to be.
That drags a soggy chuckle out of John, and Sherlock's smile is soft and sweet and childishly pleased.
Sherlock leaves John dozing, and in the kitchen, he unearths the proper tea service and tray, makes a pot of tea, fills the little pitcher with milk, the miniature bowl with sugar cubes that don't seem ancient, makes toast, finds fresh orange juice in the fridge amongst the greenery of John's (and now Sherlock's) healthier eating habits, and carries it all back to the bedroom. When John sits up, Sherlock says,
followed by the satisfying, muted
"That's not—I'm not comfortable having anal sex with you. Just yet," says John with a grimace.
"Yeah," he says, and a grin breaks out on his face even though he's not quite sure what he's grinning about.
It takes fourteen seconds from the moment that John gets to his feet to the moment he slams the door, and then he is standing in front of Sherlock, and he's doing the only thing he can think to do. If this evil memory is strong enough to capture Sherlock in its grip, then John's grip will be stronger. This man is his responsibility. This man is
John nods.
The therapy room looks nothing like he'd expected. John stops right inside the door and gapes openly. There's no metal cages clanking on chains hung from the ceiling. The paddles, canes, riding crops and floggers are discreetly tucked away in a closet, which is well lit and has professionally constructed hooks for holding them. There's not a bed in the middle of the room draped in crimson silk. In fact, the room looks a lot like a combination of gymnasium and classroom.
"I'm gonna make tea and get my kit. Don't move. Seriously, Sherlock, do not even get up from that chair, are we clear?"
"Aiden's six months out of the egg and he's meant to be teaching Sherlock how to use the Internet."
. It's all very proper nonsense.

Mycroft Holmes was a liar.
"Johnjohnjohnjohnjohn!" He grabbed John around the knees, his tail winding tightly around John's ankles. "I'm never letting you leave the house without me again! It was

"Almost there," Gerald murmurs, giving John's back long, firm strokes with his clean hand.

, tall, devilish man—I'm so jealous, you bastard. He is way out of your league. You know that, right?"
The next thing he's aware of, he's being shaken awake by John, whose eyes are a bit wild, and whose keys jingle madly from his hand.
Gerald surges up but John puts him back down with a firm hand on his sternum and then kneels between Gerald's legs.
John opens his mouth to say something rude, but then his eyes flick down Sherlock's body, and Sherlock sees the moment he remembers what's happened and decides to bite back his retort. Sherlock goes from contrite to furious in the quarter of a second it takes him to read the pity in John's eyes.
about my fucking reputation? If it were just me, as much as I love London, there are other cities in the world who could use my particular talents."
At first, John is nervous about having Gerald in the flat because he sees so much of Sherlock there, especially in the sitting room. Two months after he meets Gerald, John has the bittersweet realization that he's gradually let his own personality take over. It’s been eight months since Sherlock died.
"Thank you," he murmurs against the map of ginger stars.
John walks through the kitchen and then through a doorway into a roomy and comfortable sitting room. John knows right away this room is the heart of Gerald's home. For one, it's cluttered. Bookshelves line every available wall. A window directly across from the door looks out onto a small back garden.
Sherlock's forehead rests against John's stomach and he reaches into John's bottoms and his nimble fingers wrap around the base of John's shaft and then slide up. His fingertips tug John's foreskin up and down over his glans before sliding down and then back up again, thumb stroking over the slit, fingers dragging his foreskin back and forth. John knows that if he doesn't intervene soon, he's going to come and this is a problem. This is a
"Where did you hear that word?" John asked, his face heating.
Another curious development was a sort of fan at the end of his tail. Like the ruff or his wings, this was also jointed. When Sherlock was agitated, he would snap his tail much like he'd always done, but instead of it looking like someone flicking a booger, the fan opened with a sharp snap like
It's six in the evening, and the sun has set but it's not quite full dark. Sherlock is sitting in the back of a sleek, black car, waiting for John's boyfriend to leave so Sherlock can finally go home. At half six, Sherlock watches him step out onto the pavement and waits until he walks off in the direction of the tube station.
Then John stands up, runs to the kitchen, comes back with something—a square of foil. He guides Sherlock back to his chair, pushes him down, peels the backing off the foil square, and holds it to Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock knows what he's supposed to do. He pushes his tongue out of his mouth
"You're here to tell me it's over," Gerald says, low and deep. John shivers, a Pavlovian response to the timbre of Gerald's voice—it's his Dom voice.
Sherlock blanches and Olivia holds out her hand for him to shake and says, "Ignore her. We try not to encourage her behavior."
He goes downstairs to take a shower, and make tea, which he then takes back upstairs. He sits down at the desk in the bedroom. The whole room is depressingly character-free, considering that John slept in it for eighteen months. Sherlock had been expecting a John-ish aura to pervade the room, a golden, cozy-warm net in which to nurse his bruised body and heart, but whatever presence John had in this room is gone.
Sherlock stiffens almost as soon as John lays his hand on the back of his neck. John's mind and body are moving slow and heavy with lust, and it seems like there's a moment when John could have stopped the flashback by removing his hand, but the time between realizing what he needs to do and executing the action might as well be none at all. John yanks his hand back, but he's already lost Sherlock.
John turned to his new dragon-rearing partner. "Let me help you bring the rest of the stuff upstairs and then I'm taking a goddamn nap."
He had to admit—it did seem like the writings of someone caught in feverish delusions. He needed to leave a note to himself, a separate note, taped on the fridge or his laptop or the bathroom mirror to tell himself he wasn't crazy and to believe what he'd written.
Gerald. He
for it on occasion. He's gone head to head with some very idiotic commanding officers or hospital superiors, and had to make the call without disobeying orders. It's made him a little wily, maybe, but not underhanded. He attacks problems head on, out in the open. He's made stupid mistakes and been reamed by the higher ups, but Sherlock is the only person John's ever met who makes him feel stupid.
"Oh, my
"Okay," Sherlock says, not realizing he'd been holding his breath until he speaks.
“Sherlock, you bloody, lying bastard! I saw you fall—you

"So, you're saying—" John says, the words coming haltingly. "You're saying that you are sexually attracted to me?"
"I'm gonna have a shower and then go to bed."

Chatsworth
Gerald's hair is spread out on the pillow behind him, a black splash against the ivory pillow cases. A study in monochrome. He likes Gerald's long hair because he's always liked burying his hands into a luxurious head of hair. He used to fantasize about pushing his fingers into Sherlock's hair, tangling it up, fisting it and pulling his head back to expose that ridiculously long, white neck. John swallows hard and closes his eyes, his desire morphing into a tight pain in his chest. John feels Gerald's hand cup his shoulder before sliding down and taking his hand, their fingers tangling together. John doesn't open his eyes.
John settles his hand on Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock's heart cracks open. The blackness seeps out, every dark bit of it. He closes his eyes against the rush of emotions.
. Yesterday afternoon, he thought you were dead. It's only been twenty-four hours since you returned from the dead. Give him a chance to adjust." Mycroft sits back in his chair before speaking again. "What did he say when you—as you so quaintly put it—confessed your love?"
"Is Sherlock with you?" Gerald asks after a moment.
“They are
"I want to undress you slowly, my lips, and tongue, and teeth working their way from your mouth down to your neck, and then your chest, but no lower, at least not yet. I'll use the time spent undressing you to pour my love for you into every kiss and caress. When you try to hurry things along, I'll slow you down, but when I finally remove our clothes, it won't be love I'm thinking of. Our height difference makes it too unwieldy for me to take you on your hands and knees, but I'll work you open in that position, and then I'll lie down on my back, and watch you pant and grunt and wince at the burn as you work yourself down onto my cock. I'll let you set the pace at first, but then I'll put my feet flat on the bed, grasp one half of your arse in each hand, and thrust myself into you, spreading your arse cheeks so I can get in as deep as possible. You'll come first, and then I'll pull out and roll you back onto your hands and knees, and make you spread yourself open for me, and you will, even though it means your face is smashed uncomfortably into the mattress. When you've got them spread as wide as you can, I'll jack myself while staring at your hole, the rim red and puffy and slightly gaping, aiming my dick so that when I come, I'll paint your hole with my semen. I'll make you keep yourself spread open so I can watch my cum drip from your arsehole to your balls, and then I'll lick it off, balls first before burying my face between your cheeks to make sure I lick you clean."
"Mr. Holmes gave me a list of what to bring. I assumed you knew. Should I take it back?" Chatsworth looked very unhappy at the idea of taking all the boxes back downstairs.
If he can't lay it all out for Sherlock, then they might as well go back to the way it was before—before Sherlock pretended to die, when John was too much of a coward to tell him how he felt.
John bit back a laugh. "C'mon, you. Let's go feed you your disgusting food."
"I can't stay here forever!" John hissed. "I've got a life back in London, you know. I'm lucky I haven't lost my job."

expect me to think you're not a coward when you had the chance to tell me, but
Sherlock obediently swallows the pills and then he puts the pajama bottoms and t-shirt on the bed.
"I'll be back, dear one," John said gently. "But I can't have nothing to feed you when you hatch. The instructions are very specific about what you can eat."
"You," John says and it almost sounds like an accusation. "
"You're not interested?" Gerald asks, sounding disappointed.
"No, it’s just—but it's not

him up on the counter. John startles violently, bangs the back of his head on the cabinet, and curses loudly. "What the hell—" he starts to say, but Sherlock grabs his hips and pulls him forward, ignoring John's protests at being manhandled.
"You don't have to pay me back for attending the party," Sherlock says, sullen and wounded.
"You would be wearing the shoes while we had sex," Sherlock says, and then flushes splotchy red, eyes sliding away from John. "You would take the coat off when you arrived. It's, well—like role play."
"Yeah, but—it was easier with you. It felt less—" John stops.
Yes, home. Sherlock's home was with John, here on Baker Street, not that—that ostentatious manor house in the countryside with its live-in cook and handy young dragons named

"Okay, okay. Fine. But—"
. That's rather like taking a human baby and giving it all the necessary care for life, but isolating it completely from anyone who can relate to it. You know, they did studies of that way back before it was deemed inhumane. A king did, yeah. He took babies, put them in a room by themselves where they were fed, but not touched. Guess what happened." John leaned forward, letting all his menacing anger towards this bastard show. "
"Yes."
We all have an inner monologue, Dr. Reed says, an idea of

Sherlock turns his face, his glittering eyes narrowed and fixed on John's. "I'm never wrong," he says.
Rebecca gives him a predatory wink and pulls the door out of John's hands. The cab pulls away, and John is left standing on the sidewalk, smiling like he's mental, getting hard, thinking of all the dirty things Sherlock has groaned and whispered in John's ear every time they have sex.
"I believe my brother needs to speak with a therapist about what he endured in Serbia. Did you read the medical brief?"
"Bit late for that," John says, his eyes on his plate. He takes a bite of stuffed mushroom, and doesn't bother to look up at Sherlock.
"Don't ever—please," John says, swallowing around the great aching pain in his chest where another crack has appeared in his glued-together heart. "Do not
"You're welcome?" Sherlock said, brow wrinkled in confusion.
John turned on the taps and then ensured the bedroom door and the bathroom door that opened onto the hallway were both locked. Sherlock reared up on his hind legs, hooking his front paws over the edge of the bathtub as he watched the water pool inside.
"Oh, for heaven's sake, John, how many orifices does Sherlock have?"
"I just want you to know that the only thing more disgusting than the thought of eating raw chicken livers is the thought of eating raw
"Well, to me, if I touch someone's genitals with any part of my body and it leads to an orgasm for him or myself or both, then we've had sex."
In the taxi on the way home, Sherlock leans against John and buries his face in John's neck and sighs. "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry," John whispers, leaning his forehead against Gerald's. "Do you want to try to go back to sleep? I can give you a painkiller and it'll make you a bit drowsy. Easier to sleep; two birds with one stone and all that. And I won't think you're not a proper man for not pushing through the pain."
. "Yes, well. It's me."
Now is not the time to be thinking about Lestrade and it’s definitely not the time to be thinking of John.
Chatsworth closed his eyes and shrugged his shoulders a couple of times. John didn't think the shrugging was normally part of Chatsworth's routine, but a visual cue to help Sherlock get into the headspace needed to shift, or at least to imagine shifting.
His symptoms were the same as thousands of other soldiers who came home from war, but the therapists he saw
"What?"
Sherlock turned away from John and moved like he was going to get off the bed.
"Would you lay off the bloody sex? You're doing my head in! And if we're going by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, I believe relationships are further up the pyramid."
"We don't have any secrets," Rebecca says, and laughs deeply. "We're all a bunch of nosy, gossiping busybodies, and he knows
"He didn't die
"I think we seduced each other," she points out.
If he can't lay it all out for Sherlock, then they might as well go back to the way it was before—before Sherlock pretended to die, when John was too much of a coward to tell him how he felt.

"Please," John said reflexively.
John shakes his head. "I thought he was in Denmark." When Rebecca makes a noise of skepticism, John says, "I swear!" but he can't help but laugh—laugh at Rebecca's fierce-fake anger, laugh with joy that the man he loves is here, finally, surrounded by all the other people John loves.
Sherlock's shivering so bad that when he shakes his head it isn't immediately evident, but when it is, John says, "Well, then. I'll just have to carry you downstairs."
"They're having a party on Saturday and they've invited us."
and took all his medicine. (John frowns at Sherlock's word choice. Lately, it seems like everything Sherlock says is cloaked in sexual innuendo.)
"Out in the garden," Cyril says tilting his head towards a sliding glass door that leads out to a small but well-kept and charmingly decorated garden.
First, Sherlock's teeth didn't come in after
John was exhausted and it was barely gone six in the evening. Mycroft had said Sherlock would mostly eat and sleep. John hoped that was true, though he would have a word with Sherlock about how to eat neatly. He didn't think he could handle giving Sherlock a bath again. And he certainly didn't want to have to explain the function of any more body parts.
“So you're not a virgin?” John asks with puerile glee.
John knows this next part, because he's seen it after every flashback—the transition from threat-alert-maximum-red-blaring-klaxon-defcon-five-times-a-hundred, to
Mycroft opens his mouth to speak.
, and then, hesitantly, says, "Can I—do you want me to use this?" and dangles the red lube launcher in front of John's face. John says, "If you want, but you—you'll need to, um—do you see that little tub right there? Yeah? Okay, pump the stuff from the green bottle into that little bowl, and then you can suck it up with the—" and Sherlock picks up the tub, and says, "This?" and John nods.
Then two things happen back to back. The first thing is Zivko.
John had forgotten the bond with him and Sherlock stretched beyond the confines of their flat. He struggled to work two conversations through his sleep-deprived brain.
Gerald slumps in mock disappointment.
"Yes," Sherlock says, and licks his lips. "And the Belstaff. If you're interested, we can—explore things—but I don't want you to give me sexual favors because of—that. I said I would go, so."
"What do you wear?"
"If giving him head only earns me a piece of toast and an egg, what on earth do you think would earn me an entire evening socializing with people, one of whom is my ex-boyfriend? On, and a baby!"
Sherlock obediently swallows the pills and then he puts the pajama bottoms and t-shirt on the bed.
John looks at Sherlock then at the floor, his jaw working. John has always been so easy to read, and not just for Sherlock. John's face expresses how he feels, even when he thinks he's hiding. Sherlock has dozens and dozens of pictures in his mind palace of what each lift of John's eyebrow or quirk of his lips means.
The surprise John feels must register on his face because Gerald looks a little uncertain. John can't tell if this bloke is trying to chat him up or just being really friendly. John finally turns towards Gerald and really
"I'm going to use the cane on you first. I'll only stripe your arse and then I'll stop. When I do, I want you to say red, yellow, or green like we discussed, remember?"
, when Sherlock's neuro-hormonal levels bottom out, and he sinks into a sort of pliant lassitude, with a narrow window of maybe twenty minutes where he can still move under his own steam, but only just. This is, ironically, the time when John has to
Unfortunately this meant Sherlock spattered more egg slime over the sitting room floor. He tucked his wings in and they lay neatly along his side. Then he swiveled his head until it landed on John. "John!" he cried in a surprisingly deep voice.
John shook his head. "Just talking to myself."
"I'm sure you do, now look at me, please. At my
John reaches up, grinning with pride, semen sliding down his cheek to meet up with the bit on his chin, and puts his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck. He pulls, guiding Sherlock down into the kiss, but when Sherlock feels the pressure on the back of his head, he stiffens abruptly, every muscle seizing, fear rocketing along his nerves and obliterating the warm pleasure that came before it.
When he wakes up again, he's already been secreted inside the British embassy in Belgrade where he's immediately surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses. They insert a port IV in his neck, not even bothering going through his hand. They have to push antibiotics, a saline drip, an electrolyte solution, an antifungal and a corticosteroid into his body as quickly as possible.
He hears Mycroft shifting in his chair, and then a deep sigh.
"I can treat your injuries. If you'll let me. I can see that you're injured, Sherlock."
, of course. Surprised. But then, I wasn't."
"You have to be absolutely still, Gerald. No flinching. I don't fancy giving you a split lip and then following it up with an ugly scar. If you think you might flinch, we can come up with a way to restrain your head."
"By the look on your face, I'm thinking my luck has changed for the better," Gerald says, his voice lower and rougher. He gestures to the bar stool next to John and asks, “May I?”
Sherlock's face turns ugly when John says
Around one in the afternoon, Sherlock's temperature had risen to 103.1° and with alarm, John realized he had nothing in the house to feed his imminent hatchling.
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow, and says, "I'll keep that in mind," and reaches for the drawer in the bedside locker.

the PTSD. Dr. Reed needed to understand what had happened to him, and heal his shattered psyche.
"What am I supposed to do, just wash my hands of him? Stop being his caretaker because he's old enough in dragon time to be treated like an adult?"
Sherlock's mood turned dark. John could feel the frightening chill of the void Sherlock had existed in before John had come along.
and touches his tongue to the tiny white pill inside, then pulls it back into his mouth, remembering not to swallow or chew, but let it dissolve on his tongue.
Sherlock asked John.
"—it was indigestion—"
I'm in love with him because what happened to me in Serbia left me feeling very—needy."
"Are you in pain?" John asks.
John mopped the bathroom up as best he could, using all the dirty towels and several clean ones, squeezing the water out of everything and laying them over various surfaces to dry out. He toweled himself off, and hurried back into the bedroom to dress.
Sherlock is almost worth all of it. At least, he was

"Yeah," John says, thinking about Sherlock's arse, pale and plush and begging to be bitten. He licks his bottom lip, and then bites it. Shakes his head, trying to shake off the image. "I mean, no, I can't stop you."
. I never know if I'm coming or going! I'm forthright, and honest, and, yet, he seems to think I need to be handled like—like—
But he also reads about high heels being a signifier of power in women and that the same could be true for men.
"What?" John asks, looking up at him.
"Yeah," Gerald says, licking his lips, unable to dampen his grin. "And, uh, I think you're gorgeous, too."
"Why didn't you—"
"And that makes you feel guilty, I suppose."
Despite Sherlock's request, John runs up the stairs to the second floor bedroom, and opens it without even bothering to knock. He finds Sherlock huddled in the corner of the bed, against the wall, with his knees drawn up, and looking miserable. He looks like he's been hit with the flu, and John is immediately on alert.
"I'm starving," John says, when he comes out of the shower. "What about you?"
"Yeah. Like an idiot, I went out with a few friends last night and stayed up far past my bedtime but I had to get up at six because I had two clients this morning and –

Gerald's arms wrap John up, and John leans into him, letting his own arms circle Gerald's waist. This isn't one of Cyril's

"And then I got shot. And it got infected and I've got nerve damage in my shoulder and I had a psychosomatic limp in my leg and the army sent me home. They gave me everything then took it all away again. Well, they handed me a therapist and a shitty pension as recompense for kicking me out of the army."
. Truth has escaped and is hell bent on running wild in John's life, and John will let it, he'll even help it wreak havoc. Tomorrow. A great, jaw-cracking yawn hits him over the head right before sleep steals what's left of the day away.
"Yes," Sherlock says.
!" John shouts, stabbing his finger in Sherlock's face.
Sherlock waits, still in his chair, still fighting with himself to stay still. When he hears it again—
“You know about that?”
Right as John reaches into his locker in the doctor's lounge to grab his bag and jacket, he gets a text from Sherlock that leaves him staring at his phone, his mouth hanging slightly open in a way Sherlock would have pointed out with blistering disdain if he'd been there.
"No, the other thing," Sherlock says. The tremor in his voice makes John sober up.
"Okay, fine," John says finally. "He works with SIS. He was on a mission for them, out of the country. He's undercover—well, not
Sherlock's eyes were drooping and glazed; John immediately recognized this as a sign of fever, but he wasn't sure if it worked the same for dragons. Maybe Sherlock was just really tired. John asked him if he wanted any water, but Sherlock just shook his head once, without even lifting it off the floor, and closed his eyes.
There's silence for a minute before Sherlock sighs and says, "I would not agree to make a deal to exchange your sexual obeisance for my attendance at a social gathering of your friends because it would backfire. In case you need reminding, the results of the last deal we made is still charted on a spreadsheet on my hard drive, and you didn't like that one either," says Sherlock, low and serious.
Elspeth chuckles. "Detox, Mr. Holmes."
The fact Sherlock makes
"Oh, well, of course. Everyone does. I have to peel them off of me."
"Yeah, sorry," John says, unable to hide his blush.
boy. John, put the kettle on and then come downstairs with me. Last night I made some of those currant scones you like so much and you can bring them up here and have them with a cuppa."
The sudden stillness and quiet makes John look up only to find everyone's eyes locked on Sherlock.

Slowly, Sherlock opened his mouth, his eyebrow ridges drawn together in suspicion. John depressed the syringe. Sherlock closed his mouth and for a few seconds, John thought he'd swallowed it. Then Sherlock's eyes went wide and, without warning, he spat the medicine all over the floor and, consequently, on John's shoes.
Slowly, despite his misgivings, allowed Mrs. Hudson to touch him. She reached under his chin and began scratching him there. In his lap, John could feel that subvocal reverberating noise akin to a purr that Sherlock made when he was particularly pleased.
"A place. Is that where you take all the men you're trying to seduce? You have a secret sin palace?"
Sherlock starts to say something sarcastic such as
he died, just because you're glad to be home."
No response.
At that, Rebecca's pager goes off as well. "Uh-oh," Rebecca says, grimacing at John, who echoes her dread.
"Oh, I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it. I have a feeling MH is very knowledgeable on the feeding of newly hatched lizards, even if he's a heartless bastard."

know him well, because he's right about John being afraid of it happening again and embarrassed about hurting him. Neither of these things are enough to stop him sleeping with Gerald and certainly not enough to stop seeing him, which is a minor miracle. He's changed so much since Sherlock died. He doesn't take anything for granted anymore and he's not going to throw this away because he fucked up.
John closes his eyes and lips, and blindly seeks Sherlock's penis, and Sherlock cries out at the sight of John trying to position his face to catch Sherlock's cum. His body convulses, and the almost violent power of the orgasm tears through his nervous system. He shoots semen onto John's nose and cheek, then chin, throat, and the last sputtering dribbles land on his chest.
Sherlock groans and slumps against the headboard in annoyance. "
"Don't—" Sherlock spits out. "Don't you fucking dare feel sorry for me!"
Mycroft spread his hands. "It seems to me that you and I both have our reasons to distrust each other. I assure you, though, that it would be nearly impossible to kidnap a ten foot dragon hatchling without anyone noticing, not to mention the injury to the kidnappers and the property damage even a small dragon is capable of. As I said earlier, he's not as vulnerable as you think. Not once he's out of the egg."
hugs. This is an embrace, a clinging, protective hold that tries to express in touch what feels too difficult to say in person—
anything else was possible.
"Well, then come home with me and we'll get to know each other," Gerald says and puts both hands on John's knees. "I can make you supper and ply you with alcohol."
"Three broken ribs on the right side. Two cracked on the left."
"Let me guess—I ruined your life first by faking my death, and ruined it again by returning! Is that it? You wish I had
"He is; he

with you. In other words, can he overhear our conversation?"
"I can't cure you from being in love, Sherlock," Dr. Reed says.
John's body eases into this skin the way he used to ease his way into a woman's body, the way he used to ease his hand into someone's guts to save their life because it was what he
"My name is Chatsworth."
There's silence for a moment as the weight of the truth settles over them.
"So you've been watching porn for the last—" He checked his watch. "Twelve hours?"
"Oh dear," Chatsworth muttered in an uncanny echo of Mycroft.
He needs a friend.
Gerald's eyebrows climb into his hair. "He went all the way to Denmark because you had a fight?"
Before he faked his death, before Serbia, Sherlock could act as well as anyone in Hollywood. Fitting in at this party would be a breeze—he wouldn't mean it, but it would've been easy to feign. But the last two years have changed him. In so many ways, he's more raw than he used to be. His polish has been stripped away to reveal the naked, rough-hewn wood beneath.
"Tell me what you want," Sherlock says, lowering his head to lick along the waistband of John's pants. "You can have anything you want from me."
John watches the path of the water with open mouthed lasciviousness, his pupils dilating so quickly he has to squint against the light. Sherlock checks John's crotch and is delighted to find John has a little erection of his own happening down there. (Not that it's

feelings for me because of the sexual trauma you endured and, quite frankly, I think it's a possibility—"
Explicit sexual content
"Look, it's about compromise. You know this—it's basic relationship stuff. You and I—our relationship wouldn't have worked without talking to each other and trying to meet halfway."
Sherlock sat up straighter and smiled at John, opaline eyes shining with affection. "Oh, well, I forgive you. Next time just tell me."
John shrugs, afraid of saying something that will call attention to how very pedestrian John's worldview is. He doesn't want to disappoint Gerald, so he says nothing.
Sherlock doesn't answer, and Molly steals a glance in his direction. He's propped up on her couch, one of his ankles elevated on the armrest and his head bandaged with fresh gauze. It would appear that attempting to fake one's own suicide is not without its risks. Sherlock must feels his eyes on her because he tosses his head back and shouts, "What?"
Sherlock tries to re-situate his aching limbs. He groans under his breath. "Moriarty," he says. "He wasn't the only one. There are others out there, and as long as they are, John isn't safe."
"And how long do you think that's gonna last? They can't all be tens, Sherlock. Lestrade will do his best, but you'll still get bored."
This was when the first seeds of fear planted themselves in John’s bones. Sherlock wouldn’t ignore him.
Mycroft clicked his tongue. How long had Sherlock been left alone? "Before you go in," he said smoothly. "Tell me what he's doing."
Now, now they were home.
"There's more."
"How you did it?"
John noticed Sherlock's change in mood immediately. "Seriously," he whispered. "What's going on?"
Sherlock didn't have to throw open the curtains. He knew whose car he'd see parked on the street. "Tell him to go away," he told Mrs. Hudson somewhat petulantly.
She winces as the sound of impact reverberates in her mind.
This goes on and on until one of Mycroft's cronies comes to fetch him. No one says anything when he presses a soft kiss to his brother's hair. Once he's gone, Molly is left alone with Sherlock, something she's dreamed of for years.
Sherlock tried to ignore the wetness that had formed at the corners of his eyes. “I can’t remember how.”
"Think of it like a date," Mycroft suggested. "You have heard of those, haven't you? When two people who enjoy each other's company -"
"Obviously," he stammered. "Been trying to call you the last forty-five minutes!"
Without realizing he was doing it, Sherlock's fingers danced over John's face, catching John's hand in the process and bringing it down to his chest. There, right there. Drums in his ribcage, a bass in his bones, the steady, reassuring thrum of a beating heart.
John laughed again, but this time, the eye-roll that followed was somewhat fond. “How is the British government, anyway?”
Hearing John was not surprising. Sherlock has been hearing John's voice in his head every day for three years. It wasn't even surprising when John walked through the door. The visual hallucinations had happened before, though not for some time.
It isn't the first time Molly's done it. Her job is not without its difficulties, and she's found comfort in idle chatter, even if the other party isn't exactly capable of responding. "Now, Mrs. Turner, over you get while I examine your back." "George, I'm going to go over your papers for a spell. You sit tight, alright?"
“Boring,” Sherlock mumbled. “Last we spoke he was trying to convince me you’re still dead.”
"But you went to the shops,” Sherlock insisted. "You said so yourself. It was only a couple of hours ago, how could we run out of sugar so fast?"
After years of loneliness, Sherlock could finally breathe.
John flexed his left hand intermittently. The scowl he wore could have rivaled Mycroft's own. "I'm sure I'd agree with you," he huffed. "If you would tell me what the hell's been going on.”
John's voice in his ear kept him from drowning in the fantasy. "Not good," he warned. "If you start all this again, it'll be a danger night for sure. You won't get a moment's peace. God knows who Mycroft will send to babysit you this time."
"Or your brother?"
A heartbeat. The one thing he'd missed in every delusion. No matter how deeply he buried himself in his mind palace, no matter how many memories he relived, he'd never felt John, not like this. The man who was still half-straddling him on the sofa was alive. There was life in every blink, in every flush, in every breath. This was no shadow. This was no hallucination. Not a trick. This was John.
For one thing, mercilessly beating a corpse with a riding crop did wonders for his anger.
"And here I thought you'd be pleased."
Molly flinches when John laughs. It's the most pathetic sound she's ever heard. He can't even speak.
Sherlock's features soften. He reaches for Molly's hand almost tenderly. "And yet, you're still here."
Sherlock practically pushed her out. "Yes, I'll keep that in mind, thank you." He shut the door before she could fix him with a look that might make him feel guilty. He smashed the deadbolt into the locked position and fell against the wall with a hard thud.
"Go to hell."
And then John and Greg are gone. Molly looks pointedly at Mycroft, but he only has eyes for his brother. "I miscalculated..." Mycroft repeats this over and over until the words stop making sense. "For God's sake, Sherlock, why didn't you tell me?"
Greg lowers his gun. “No…” he shakes his head and steps back, gaze flicking between Sherlock and John. “No, Jesus, no -”
He’s talking into his phone again. “Do not let him come down, do you understand? Do not let Dr. Watson anywhere near -”
It's quiet now. The distinct hums of various pieces of machinery are the only sounds. It's like someone has cut the strings that were holding John upright, and he slumps in Greg's arms. Greg tries to console him, but only succeeds in helping him stand on his own. John's eyes linger on Sherlock. As if compelled by some unseen force, he shuffles towards the gurney. Greg says something, but no one pays attention.
"You're dead!" she tries to shout, but her voice is lost in the clammy skin of Sherlock's palm. He's probably managed to get his blood all over her, but she can't bring herself to care.
They stayed that way for a long while, and eventually, John dozed off, pretending that Sherlock really was holding him back.
Denial comes first, because this isn’t Sherlock Holmes, it can’t be. This is some sick joke, an experiment on how the human body reacts to shock. If she flicks him on the forehead or pours cold water on him, he’ll spring up like a spastic Pomeranian and proceed with his deductions.
Molly spins around on her heel and quite literally throws the duvet at him. "Would you stop that?"
John was playing house in a world of make-believe.
Realization crashes over Molly like a wave. "You need me to fake the papers."
Sherlock. Still. Dead.
Sherlock dropped whatever it was he was holding. It fell to the ground and probably broke, but he didn't care. Because frozen in that spot, looking just as surprised as he was, was John. John.
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock hoped that Mycroft would forget what day it was, even if he couldn't.
“No…” he shakes his head, and Molly fears that he’s going to faint if he doesn’t sit down. She reaches for his arm but he swats her away. “No,” he repeats. “No, no, I’ve missed something! Get me the footage,” and it’s only then that Molly realizes Mycroft has smashed a phone to his ear. “Yes, all of it, from the last twelve hours at least, and - what do you mean?” Mycroft waits only a moment before his gaze cuts back to Molly. “Dr. Watson,” he hisses. “has he been here?”
