Cas pinned Dean's arms down, sucking down on his bottom lip as he ground himself down against Dean's thick thigh.
Once dressed in a pair of jeans and a plain t-shirt, Dean sat on the edge of his bed, waiting for room service. “You just gonna stand there and make sure the door doesn’t jump out and hit me?” He asked.
“Mm...” It wasn’t a long ride back to the hotel, but Dean wanted to make every second count since he wasn’t sure how much time he’d get with Cas once they returned.
Cas was pleased he had found another one of Dean’s weaknesses, the sensitivity of his hard nipples. Cas could have played with them all night, rolling the bud gently between his teeth, his tongue caressing them as he slid his hand down the front of Dean’s boxers, stroking him a few times.
"Yes, I do want to stop. It's not like you have few options." He muttered. It shouldn't matter; Cas would just have to find another way to relieve himself. Dean was just annoying. And charming. And attractive. Damn it. He could just pretend he wasn't into it. Why was it so hard to? He wanted to service Dean; maybe it was confidence? Cas didn't know. But he didn't care. This wouldn't happen again. Hopefully.
He licked the excess cum from his thumb and stood up, obedient to Dean without hesitation. "What?" He asked, voice breathy.
Cas rolled his eyes. "You are going to keep bothering me this whole ride huh?" He glowered, moving closer and pushing Dean back. "Sit on the chair.” He couldn't help it. He could act like he didn't want it, but he wanted to hear Dean moan again, wanted to feel his fingers tug and pull at his long hair desperately.
“Alright, we’re done here. I really hope I never have to see you again. But enjoy my concert, I guess.”
Dean closed his eyes, pulling Cas close. “Tonight was fun. Thank you.” He kissed his cheek, gently stroking his hair. “Mm.”
"Yes." Cas pressed a kiss to Dean's forehead and ushered him under the water, rinsing his body down with soap to keep Dean distracted. Surely he would stop thinking about spiders if Cas was washing his thighs.
“I don’t require anything. But if you want to stay here and maybe...not act like you’re at work for a bit, I wouldn’t mind.”
“God, me neither.” Dean shook his head. “Here.” He took off his sunglasses and handed them to Cas, going over to the elevators and pressing the button. His hand still firmly gripped with Cas’, he leaned back against the wall once the elevator arrived.
“Oh, don’t think I can see it.” Dean squinted. “Oooh, that huge thing right in my face? Ohhhh. Let’s go.” Yeah, he was at the immature stage of being obnoxious for no reason at that point. He clapped Cas on the back, then started over. “Are we gonna have to wait in a long ass line for this?”
"Mm, you have had a long day." He didn’t close his eyes, but he leaned over and turned the light off in hopes that Dean could get some much needed rest.
Dean removed his sunglasses, meeting Brad’s eyes. “Oh, you’ve gotta be fucking kidding me. It’s you?” He recognized the man from his London party.
Cas took a brief look at Dean. Did he honestly not care? Even a little bit? Maybe all Cas was was another person sucking Dean’s cock. He followed a few steps behind, rigid and face expressionless. He was to blend in. Not stand out.
Cas leaned into him for a moment before retreating, squeezing Dean’s hand gently. He sleepily made his way to Dean’s room; all he could think about was falling asleep in his arms, kissing him slowly. He nudged open the door and removed his shoes, belt and jacket, yawning and dropping them aside.
“Good point.” Dean was used to getting VIP treatment wherever he went, and this would be no different. He bought two tickets, then got in line with Cas. When the ticket checker came over, he did as was suggested, lowering his sunglasses a little to look at the man before slipping him 150 pounds.
"Like it?" He asked softly, drawing himself to his feet to massage Dean’s waist and chest, scrubbing off the leftover chocolate from his body.
“Uh huh.” Dean let out a yawn. “You’re still gonna be here when I wake up, right?” He asked, that fear still present in his mind as he curled closer to Cas, comfortable despite the quality of the end.
Dean hung up and pulled off his t-shirt, deciding to go for just the sweatpants. They were a little loose on him, so they hung low on his hips. He got up and unlatched the door, pulling it open for her. “Hey, thanks. I know it’s kinda late, but I can’t sleep. I’ve had a rough day...”
When Cas woke up, it was around 9pm. His head was spinning and he felt vomit pooling up inside him. He fled to the closest bathroom and threw up the empty contents of his stomach. He clung to the bowl, praying for death.
"Look, I may not be your bodyguard anymore, but I will be damned if I let you get caught out for this. Get dressed and call a car to meet me on Fifth," he instructed, hurrying to pull his clothes on.
, was all Dean could think as Cas grabbed him. It was enough to knock the breath out of him completely, but he didn’t hesitate in kissing back, his hands gripping at the fabric of the back of Cas’ shirt, bunching it up in his fists.
“No problem.” Dean couldn’t help but think that he looked kind of cute when he blushed. Cas was attractive. He wasn’t going to deny that. And the forbiddenness of the situation made him even more appealing to Dean.
Cas nods, tucking his hands into his pockets as he stands to the side. They would find it odd, disguise or not. Dean was tall, well-built and obviously well dressed and handsome. Cas was kinda weird, lanky and there was just something...odd about him, not to mention his clothes matched his dishevelled appearance
"I didn't think you would even want to mention last night," Cas said honestly. Mostly when these moments happened out of passion or a drunk error of judgement, they were ignored. "I don't think it would be professional to do it again," He said slowly, but that didn't mean that he didn't want to. The tip of his tongue was still reminiscent of the taste of Dean’s skin no matter how many times he brushed his teeth and Dean’s moans stirred something in him he couldn't smother.
“Ooh, I figured.” Dean chuckled. It kinda turned him on to hear that Cas was ‘here to serve’ him, but he didn’t say anything. He finished his breakfast, wheeling the cart toward the door to be picked up later.
Dean shuddered. He knew he’d spend the next couple days with a large bruise on his neck and no one would question it because he was always covered in hickeys. That was a big part of the reason he’d had to start wearing makeup onstage. “Cas-fuck,” he cried out, not meaning to moan his name like that, but he couldn’t help himself.
Dean bit his lip and looked up at Cas, shedding his flannel and tossing it to the ground. He placed his hands on his hips, watching him suck the mousse form his fingers. “Fuck...if that’s not one of the most erotic things I’ve ever seen.”
"Mm...." Cas hollowed his cheeks, running his tongue along the underside of Dean's thick cock as he worked him slowly. He loved Dean saying his name like that; it was gorgeous.
Dean shook his head, sucking in another breath as he watched Cas. It made him squirm a little, how erotic that small action was. “Get your ass up here,” he grunted in a low voice.
"Dean, please." Cas sighed, trying to get him to stop talking before he potentially made things worse. He was broken up, his heart on the floor and sadness pouring out of every pore of him. He needed to find somewhere to stay, and he needed a minute to cry. But it wasn't going to be in the conference room.
drunk. I still remember everything that happened.” He smirked, climbing out of the tub and grabbing a towel off the rack to wrap around him. “I normally get room service up here for breakfast, but it hasn’t come yet. Did you see them?”
When he was sure Dean was prepped, he pulled his fingers out and coated them generously in lube, wrapping his hand around his hard cock. He lathered himself up, wiping his lubed hand on the sheets before climbing up behind Dean. He pushed his knees apart, pressing his tip at Deans entrance and pushed in slowly, letting out a deep, guttural moan. "Fuck, you are so tight. And warm. Fuck-" Cas growled, his voice dropping an octave lower. He leaned over Dean, one hand on his hip and the other gripping the headboard as he started off his slow, deep pulses inside him.
Cas pulled his hand back so Dean couldn’t touch him. "I don't want my job back. I don't even want to know what you did to get it back," he replied, rubbing his forehead.
“Consider it a hidden talent.” He pulled out a few miniature bottles of whiskey and set them on the table. “I think I’ve found the solution to being trapped in here with you.” He smirked.
Dean reached out to take his hand. “Well, you’ve got your job back, but I don’t know what I can do about the rest. But hey, I’ve been there. We all have. It’s okay. I’m the king of getting wasted and doing dumb shit.” He chuckled. “And honestly, I’m not proud of some stuff I’ve done tonight too, and I did it sober.”
He grabbed Dean's collar and pulled him closer, "Dean. I’m going to have to ask you to shut up and kiss me," he breathed out, losing any kind of self control in that moment.
Dean shrugged. “I dunno. I just wanna be outside as little as possible. It’d be fun to do touristy things, but that’s where most of the people are...”
Dean held his breath for a moment, trying to quell his excitement. But with the praise and commanding demeanor Cas has now taken on, it was nearly impossible. He let his arms go limp, squeezing his hands into fists, then relaxing them as he was cuffed to the headboard. The slap to his thighs made him shiver and his eyes trailed slowly down Cas’ body as he got close.
“Yeah, go fuck yourself.” Dean huffed and left the room, sunglasses back on. He went to the elevators and rode it up to the top floor. What had started as the perfect night had spiraled downward so quickly, and he was in no way in the mood to put on a concert, but he’d never let down his fans. Once he got to his room, he undressed, hanging up his suit to be taken for dry-cleaning, then hopping into the shower. He wondered if Cas was going to show up at the concert, and while he wanted nothing more than to run to his side, he also knew it would be best to give him his space.
"For fuck’s sake, only you would find the damn porn channel." He scoffed, taking a seat back on his side of the bed. “Sports, huh? Didn't pick you for a fan."
Dean smiled a little and got up, retrieving the flowers that were now a little crushed and wilted, and the container of mousse and brought them back over to Cas.
“Fuck!” Dean couldn’t take it anymore. The minute Cas pushed his hips down, he exploded, coating his cock in cum. His chest heaved and his head drooped to the side. “That’s...what you do to me,” he panted, his body going limp.
"If that's what you want," Cas said flatly, his once playful mood darkening. He stood up, dusting off his shirt. Of course, he forgot he was on the job for a minute and for a slight second, he thought it might be him. How foolish. "Do you have a type?"
“Mmf...” Everything about Cas made him moan. His words, his hot breath, his perfectly timed thrusts and the grip of his fingers on his hips. Dean was done for. He let out a near scream when his prostate was struck, his ass clenching around him again as his breathing grew ragged.
Dean climbed out of the shower and got dressed, putting on a pair of  black jeans and a black hoodie, his ‘sneaking around outfit’ . He put on his sunglasses as well and slid his phone into his pocket. There was an ATM across the street from the hotel and he left through the back stairwell so he wasn’t seen. Walking over and reading the instructions, he groaned. He could only withdraw €250 a day. And the banks were all closed by then. Shaking his head, he went to the bar anyway, hoping to explain the situation.
"Well that would prove you are a little slut for me, wouldn't it, Dean?" He breathed out, his hardened gaze on Dean as he slid his own already half-hard cock over the rock star’s slowly, grinding them together.
“Oh, this is super family friendly,” he smirked, but the expression on his face was immediately changed to a soft moan.
Dean smirked, licking the mousse off his tip before swallowing him down as far as he could without choking. “Mm...” he hummed around his shaft. Cas always tasted good to him, but this was even better.
"It's a talent, actually. I must say, getting you worked up in the shower is very exciting for me." He flashed Dean a  cocky smile, brushing his fingers up through his dark hair and flexing a little, eyes on Dean.
Cas let out a soft, muffled reply as he comfortably fell into a warm rest, shrouded in so much warmth and happiness that he swore he could have died right there and been content with it.
“Stop parenting me. I know my limits.” Dean sighed and walked over to Cas. “You’re just gonna be a pain in my ass this entire time, aren’t you?”
“They’re like, parodies of classic horror movies. Really dumb, and fucking hilarious. And they’re not actually scary if you’re not into horror. In my opinion, it’s better to watch them high, but I didn’t bring anything this trip.”
“Oh, fuck...” Currents of pleasure coursed through Dean’s body and he pushed his chest up, moaning as Cas licked and sucked on his nipples. “That feels so good,” he gasped, gently tugging on Cas’ hair.
Cas hesitantly sat beside him, taking a mouthful of beer and leaning back on his palm. He tried to ignore Dean, his eyes focused on the TV as he flicked through the channels mindlessly, his  thumb circling the top of his beer bottle.
Cas didn't bother drying down, squeezing out the ends of his hair to ring it out the best he could, each droplet sliding down over his already wet body that had a slight sheen to it. "How about I touch myself, and if I get off before you touch me, you win, but if you break and give in, I win." He smirked, beckoning Dean to come closer.
"Oh no." His panicked eyes fell back to Dean. "Crowley is here." He was the head boss. Above Jo. Someone Cas had only met once and prayed he would never have to meet again.
movies is on. You ever seen those? They’re absolute garbage, and the best media I’ve ever seen.” He laughed.
"I will be on your team because you need a set of hands. But that’s all," he eventually replied. He liked Dean, so very much. But he didn't want Dean to only like him out of pity or because he liked his dick.
This chapter is a bit shorter than usual, but the next one will be back to normal length! Thank you everyone for your kudos, comments, and continued support of this fic. Each one means a lot and keeps us going.
Cas stayed close to the window as Dean fell out of it. He helped dust Dean off. "After this, you are going to wish you were. Fifth is only about two blocks away. We can either split up or go together, whatever seems less conspicuous."
He finally gathered himself enough to seem rather casual, trying to keep the really dumb smile from his face. He flopped down on the bed next to Dean. "Well, that was better than earlier," He breathed out. Better was a definite understatement. Incredible? Fucking amazing? World shattering?
A soft, involuntary whimper fell from Dean’s lips as he heard his question. He slid his hand into Cas’ boxers, lightly caressing his cock as he responded. “Mm. Pretty sure I’ve done just about every sex act you can think of. But that doesn’t mean I’ve been fucked good.” He chuckled lowly, helping him undress completely, then grinding his hips again. Fuck. That felt good.
She helped him strip her bare, her eyes on him as she swallowed thickly. "Fuck me however you want," she breathed out. She would do anything to please him, sexually or not.
"I use it to help me sleep; sometimes my insomnia has me up all night. I would ever do it while I'm on the job. Although maybe I would working for you, because fuck, you are high maintenance," Cas teased.  "I also smoke in general. But mostly just as a relaxing technique." He didn’t know why he was telling Dean these things he probably didn’t care about; he just...felt like something changed. Their awful evenings had left them in a state of vulnerability with each other.
“You call it ‘bothering’ and I call it making conversation, but yes.” Dean chuckled, raising an eyebrow when Cas suddenly became commanding. “Oh, yes sir.” He couldn’t tell whether he was going to get lectured or straddled, but he obeyed, taking a seat on the couch.
Dean gratefully slid the cap on, keeping his head tilted down. He smirked a little upon seeing Cas’ mussed hair and he reached forward to ruffle it a little. “Thanks.” He ducked into one of the nearby stores.
When Dean was finished washing him, he slid his hands over Cas’ ass and pressed their chests together. “So much muscle. That’s why I wanted to lick you all over.” He chuckled.
Dean sighed. “That’s not true, Cas. You could get anyone you wanted too. You know me, first of all. And you’re...not so bad looking, you know?”
“No, that’d be an improvement.” Dean snorted. “Fine. I’m offering you free clothes here. Take it or leave it.”
“Well geez. She might be the only person I’ve met with a stick farther up her ass than yours.” Dean laughed, uncovering the dishes and setting his burger on a tray on his lap. He set his beer on the nightstand and took a bite of the burger.
“Can we just go ahead and skip the ‘this is never gonna happen again’ conversation?” Dean asked. “Because we only lasted a few hours since the last time we said that. I’m pretty sure it is.”
Cas sucked on Dean's nipple, giving it all his attention as his fingers lifted Dean's waist, giving him room to move as he needed to strip out of his clothes. He moved over to Dean's other nipple, licking and nipping at the bud slowly.
“You’re damned right I am.” Dean gritted his teeth as soon as he felt Cas brush against him and he arched his back, clenching and trying to keep himself from finishing so he could enjoy as much as he could. “Fuck! Fuck...Cas. Oh my god...”
"Fine,” He muttered, turning to glance out the large glass window. He caught his own reflection in the mirror and shifted a little, trying to flatten out his wind blown hair. He averted his eyes and instead focused on the view.
"Same. I hate sleeping alone," she replied, although that wasn't entirely true. She slipped her shoes off and sat up next to Dean as requested.
Dean walked around to the opposite side a few minutes later and slid into the seat, removing his sunglasses and combing his fingers through his hair as he looked over at Cas. In a deep voice, he said, “ah, Mr. Novak. You’re right on time.” He leaned forward and grabbed Cas’ tie, pulling him closer. Just against his lips, he murmured, “so glad you could make it.”
“No angel is allowed to come down to earth anymore. If they want to fall, they have to rip out their grace and start life as a baby. A new soul, a new human.”
For a moment Castiel forgot that he no longer was an angel. He jumped up and put his arms around Jack to try and calm him down, but it didn’t work. The last thing he knew felt was a burning sensation in his hands and then being blinded by light and then pure darkness.
“It’s an ancient form of communication between guardian angels and their charges. With the changes Jack made to heaven, there’s no other way I can come and see you.”
Castiel looked his son in the eyes, searching for a trace of the soft boy he had been while they lived together in the bunker. All he found was a strong and decisive man, a God, kind yet unrelenting.
“He is. He knows he can’t do anything. All he does is pray. They are saying goodbye right now, they know what’s going to happen.”
With a groan he sat up and grabbed his head, probably to stop it from pounding. He slid his fingers through his hair, gently massaging his scalp. Before he got the chance to really get up, a small-ish beige dog came running for him, burying itself in his chest. He held the creature tight for a second, hiding his face in its fur. Dean just stayed on the floor, barely moving, until Sam walked in the library with a worried and annoyed look on his face.
“You know you can go back, but know that it’s definitive this time. There is no changing your mind. If you return, it’s as a human being with a soul. You’ll start your life as a baby and you will live it out like any other human until you come full circle. And Castiel, you will not remember anything from your time as an angel. Not your past as a warrior of heaven, nor your time as a human. You will, in essence, become a brand new human being. I can guide your soul so you’ll be born in the best possible circumstances, but that is all I can and will do. Everything else is up to you and the people around you.”
Castiel could barely suppress the urge to punch the older Winchester. His eyes narrowed and he stared Dean down, trying not to blink.
Cas melted in his embrace for the second time, and Dean genuinely wondered if they would ever be ready to let go of each other to do normal, everyday stuff.
“You don’t have to change anything. There are rules and there’s free will. You just can’t… orchestrate people’s lives. If they want to do something that’s against the rules, well… it’s their decision and they can and should be punished for it. Now…”
There was nothing special about it, just a regular Thursday on earth. When Castiel checked up on Sam and Dean, there was nothing amiss. They were on a run of the mill vampire hunt. In the past few months, vamps had been the only monsters left to actively fight their extinction, they’d tried and tried again to repopulate their nests. They had turned large numbers of people, but only few of them survived. No matter how hard they tried, there were always some hunters in the neighborhood itching for a good fight. Most nests got exterminated quite quickly. The main issue was that those few that were left, mostly the newly turned, were extremely aggressive. So when the Winchesters came across a newly formed nest, Castiel knew to keep an eye out.
"I am an Angel of the Lord, Dean Winchester," he said with barely suppressed humor in his voice, "I can take care of a burning pan of bacon."
The atmosphere in the library was tense, but Castiel could see Jack visibly relax when they entered the room. He walked over to him and enveloped the kid in a hug. Sam sighed in relief, somehow simultaneously glaring at his brother and smiling in Castiel’s direction.
Sam still looked bewildered by everything that had happened in the last ten minutes. From being resigned to continue without his brother to having his best friend returned, he really couldn’t fathom what had happened.
Jack kept his eyes trained on Castiel all the time, barely sparing a glance for the Winchesters. Castiel could feel the confusion and anger coming off the kid clearly, even in his human form.
“Dean’s praying to me, asking to bring you back. He does this dozens of times a day. He doesn’t know you’re out of the Empty.”
For all his previous confusion and hesitation, Dean found he returned Cas’ feelings fully. His heart skipped a beat when he thought of his friend’s face, the dark mop of hair and his clear blue eyes. There was nothing Cas couldn’t have if it were up to Dean. He imagined what it would be like to cup his face, to feel the roughness of his cheeks against his palm. The thought of tracing his upper lip with his thumb, before capturing his mouth in the softest of kisses made Dean blush. He tried to hide the twinkle in his eyes, but one look at Sam's face told him he failed terribly so he gave up fighting it.
“Cas? Is that you?” Dean’s voice coming from this small, frightened kid was jarring, but Castiel nodded.
“Fuck you, Sammy. Fuck you.” Dean got up and took a swing at his brother, but that just landed him on his ass again. With a barely suppressed groan he leaned on his elbows and watched Sam walk away, muttering under his breath.
They were on the way back to the bunker early the next morning. Sam was happily texting with Eileen, updating her on how everything had gone down with Chuck and staring out of the window with that weird, dreamy puppy look in his eyes.
Castiel was surprised to hear these words, this open acceptance of a need Dean would never allow himself when awake. He took in Dean’s resigned posture as they walked away from the battlefield into a dark forest. The foliage was bright green and retreated as the two friends walked on. Stars lit up the sky and the forest and guided them on the right path. Castiel had always known Dean’s mind to be a welcoming place for him, no matter how strained their relationship had become at times. A weight fell off him as he followed Dean onto the narrow paths filled with freshly fallen leaves.
“You’re going to let this happen? You’re not going to interfere? After all he went through, you’re going to let him die, like this? It’s been a month since Chuck, he barely had the chance to live his life.”
A few hours later, they were both sated and relaxed. They were tangled together on top of the covers, enjoying the cool air caressing their bare bodies. Castiel lay on his back, caressing the Dean’s neck, softly scratching that sweet spot where his hair fell over his skin. He was on the verge of falling asleep when he heard Dean whisper something, before burying his face in his neck.
“He’s with Sam in the library,” he chuckled darkly, “they seemed afraid of me… I tend to...” his voice trailed, and Castiel couldn’t pinpoint if it was fear or regret that caused it.
Yet this was different, he could feel it to his bones, and for once, he allowed it in. For once in his life, Dean believed. He believed he deserved this. Cas deserved this. After everything he’d done for the world and the Winchesters, he deserved to get what he wanted most. And maybe, just maybe, it was what Dean wanted most too.
Sam walked up to Castiel like he was something out of a dream. His eyes squinted at the assault of the light, but he managed to grab Dean’s other side and together they lay him down on the floor, most of his weight supported by Sam. Castiel healed him as fast as he could, feeling the remainder of his grace burn out quicker than Dean’s wounds were closing. He sent a prayer to Jack, hoping he would hear him, and forgive him for his actions.
From then on, Castiel went to check in on Dean every night. Sometimes they talked about the apocalypse, about Chuck, but sometimes Dean told him about movies he’d watched, about a job he was thinking of getting. Other times they just walked or sat in silence. The scenery often changed from desolate and bloody to green and full of sounds as soon as Dean was aware of his presence.
When Dean tried to grab the flask again, he found Sam’s hand on his wrist, disapproval and sadness written all over his face.
Castiel pushed Sam roughly aside and grabbed Dean’s face. He felt his grace rush through his body as he held his hand over the dying man’s heart. With practiced ease, he healed the internal damage as best as he could before he pulled Dean off the piece of rebar.
“You know what, baby brother? You’re right,” he said, causing Sam’s eyebrows to disappear into his hairline.
The bunker seemed the same as when they last left it, but Dean could smell the difference. A whiff of ozone, as well as his own shampoo mixed with frying bacon... his stomach revolted when he smelled food, but in his heart, he knew who would be waiting in the kitchen as soon as he found the courage to go there.
“Please, let me go, Jack. Let me go to him, heal him. Let me send an ambulance at least. Sam doesn’t seem capable of doing anything. He’s paralyzed.”
Castiel was puzzled. Why wouldn’t Dean enjoy his life without him around? He’d been doing okay when they talked in his dreams. Taking a good look at Sam, he noticed much of the tension he’d seen in his face had vanished. While at first he attributed this to getting rid of the vamps, there was something else to it. Something frighteningly akin to hope started to rear its head deep down insid of him, but he didn’t want to read too much into it.
“When you were in the Empty, while I was looking for a way to get you out, I discovered many damaging events that would have been prevented if angels and demons had not interfered. At the time, it seemed prudent to close off the exits in both heaven and hell. Most monsters have been dealt with, they have their own place in Purgatory now. Eve watches over them and takes care of them. They no longer have a need to roam the earth. The few that are left will be finished off by hunters or they can live their lives in peace if they so choose.”
Castiel had moved into Dean’s room. The two of them often didn’t bother to come out all day long, except to grab some food from the kitchen only to disappear again with a smug grin on their faces. Neither man had ever looked happier. Their lingering glances regularly brought Sam to despair, causing him to yell at them to get to their room. Every time this happened Jack usually looked on with a fond smile that turned into horror when he realized neither of them cared to keep the noise down.
“Jack, I’m… I’m sorry,” Sam started, trying in vain to mask his disappointment behind an attempt to smile, “you’re right. You’ve done enough, we won’t ask for more.”
This time there was no deception, no Lucifer waiting for him like last time. Cas stood at the stove, wearing a white shirt. His trenchcoat was hanging over one of the chairs. He was obviously startled by the sound, but Dean could see him catch himself before the surprise showed on his face.
“I changed you, Castiel. I changed all angels. You are now capable of experiencing all emotions and sensations, and to let them guide your decisions. Your capability to feel love, to care, changed heaven for good. We made it a better place.” Jack told him, not long after they finished the repairs.
Sam had fallen asleep with his face against the window, his phone lighting up in his lap. Dean smiled wanly, his baby brother deserved rest. He grabbed Sam’s phone and texted Eileen to make sure she wouldn’t worry again. He then dropped it on the seat next to Sam.
Castiel felt the floor drop from under him. What was going on? What had just happened? This wasn’t Dean, he’d only known Dean to give up once before, when they were up against Lucifer, but never again. He tried to take a closer look, but before he could see anything else, the tray dissolved in front of him, leaving no trace of its existence.
Dean’s smile widened as he saw Sam grab Eileen and pull her close to him. Seeing his baby brother happy had always meant the world to him, and he got his fill right now. Sam smiled through his tears, both speaking and signing at the same time. Eileen looked just as happy as Sam did, her tears flowed freely while they both tried to talk and kiss at the same time. Resolved to give the two lovebirds their privacy, Dean quietly got out of the car. With a quick wave and a smile for Eileen, he went inside. He knew Sam would follow as soon as he had composed himself.
“Where it should be?” he started, suspicion clear in his voice, “Eileen was resurrected from hell… you think she’s there?” His tone was flat, yet dark and threatening.
“Cas?” Dean asked, his voice clouded with emotion. He immediately grasped Castiel’s hands like he’d done dozens of times in their shared dreams by now.
Taking out Chuck had been no worse than taking out any other monster they’d battled before. In the end, they beat him. Sam, Dean and Jack. Team Free Will minus one had done it again.
Castiel and Sam both gaped at Dean, mouths wide open in surprise, but when Castiel shifted his attention to Jack, he knew Dean had found the right thing to say. The boy’s face lit up like a Christmas tree when presented with the opportunity to stay with the family he’d built during his short term on earth. He grinned and walked around the table to pull Dean in a hug. Eileen temporarily forgotten, Sam joined in too and he grabbed Castiel by his sleeves so it ended up a proper group hug.
Sam didn’t waste any time, moving the dog out of the way and hauling Dean up from his spot. Irritation radiated off him as he shook his brother a little rougher than strictly necessary.
Dean chuckled and nipped playfully at the finger still covering his mouth. He caught Cas' hand with his and softly caressed it, mirroring the actions of the angel in his dream earlier.
“You know that thing you wanted, but couldn’t have?” When Castiel nodded, Dean continued “What would you do if I told you it has been yours all along?”
A surge of anger shot through Dean. He'd recognized the pity in Sam's tone, and it pissed him off. His fist clenched by his side, he forced himself to not just hit Sam to get him off his ass. He closed his eyes briefly, taking a deep breath. This was not a fight he was going to get in now, he needed to be clear-headed to take Sam on. He knew his brother would make him open up about what happened in the end, but this was not the time. They still had work to do. He sat up straight and shot Sam a dirty look. Letting go of his anger, he sat up straight.
When he looked into those sad green eyes he knew that this was it. He’d keep watch over Dean as he’d done ever since pulling his soul from the pit, until the end of time if possible. One day, they’d be reunited in heaven, but unless Dean stopped his behavior, that day would come way too soon.
Dean kept his eyes on the road while shooting a prayer in Jack’s direction. He sneakily glanced upward through the windshield, but the early morning sky didn’t change. There was no sign that Jack was listening, but he knew had to try. He'd blown it by not asking to get him back as soon as Jack had announced he was the new god, he'd really done it this time.
“Let’s take this elsewhere,” he breathed, barely hanging on to his self control, but Dean shook his head and groaned.
He was busy rebuilding the Axis Mundi when he felt it, a sharp pain close to where his heart would be if he were still stuck in his vessel. This couldn’t be good. He vanished from his spot and appeared in Jack’s space, or office as he sometimes called it, which was thankfully empty. He walked up to the cupboard and took out the tray he’d used to check up on the Winchesters previously.
“And yet you forbid me to go back to the man who taught me to love, who changed me into who I am now,” he said, matter-of-factly. He allowed the feeling of anger and loss to pass through him, but refused to focus on it for longer than necessary.
What happened next surprised him even more than their earlier kiss had. Dean’s gaze grew impossibly soft and he placed a kiss right under Castiel’s ear before he hugged him close.
Castiel gave him the short version of events, without losing himself into the details of rebuilding heaven.
Life was good, Sam mused after he got off the phone with Donna. Another hunter family barbecue was coming up and for once, they weren’t in charge of it. All they had to do was show up at Jody’s by nightfall. Grinning widely, he got up and padded down the corridor to Dean’s room. He ignored the noises coming from inside and banged on the door.
Later that day he went back to Jack and asked for permission to keep an eye on Dean. He not as much asked for permission but told him he was going to keep an eye on both the Winchesters and their immediate circle. Jack surrendered the tray without even a trace of protest.
Castiel walked out of the room without looking back at his son, fearing that if he did, he’d do something monumentally stupid, like trying to kill him. He needed to figure out what had happened to Jack between the time he’d left him behind to go with Dean and when he got back from the Empty. Maybe Chuck destroyed him before he could even take over heaven? It also occurred to him that Jack was still a kid, and kids were often misguided in their desire to make things right.
“Sammy?” he called, and when no reaction came, he shook Sam’s shoulder roughly. Sam’s mouth fell open, but no sound came out.
“Scoot over, Sammy. Drive us back home. We’ll figure things out from there,” he exclaimed with false courage, “We have an angel to find!”
When Jack saved Castiel from the Empty, he told him in no uncertain terms that angels were no longer to leave heaven, unless they chose to fall. He also asked Cas to stay and help him redesign heaven so Dean would approve of it.
“Dean was-,” Sam started, looking Castiel straight in the eyes, “He was lost after we dealt with Chuck. At first he seemed okay, he had Miracle, we went on hunts. It was weird that he didn’t try to bring you back, so I looked and couldn’t find anything. There was nothing on the Empty, nothing we could do. When I told him, Dean, he… he just stopped, you know?” He looked apologetic, his eyes cast to the floor, where his and Castiel’s feet almost touched. There was something in his demeanor that made Castiel uneasy, until it hit him.
“Hey, hey, Sammy… let’s not get carried away here,” Dean interrupted him, “If you’re talking about Cas, just give the man a break. He doesn’t need to be punished. Just,” and he took a deep breath before continuing, “let nature run its course. Take me with you, like it was supposed to be.”
Before he could allow doubt to take over again, Dean pulled him closer so their mouths were only inches apart. He licked his upper lip, looking at Cas' parted mouth. He felt at peace when he claimed the angel's lips in a soft kiss. When he pulled back, he just gazed into Cas' blue eyes before he couldn't hold it anymore and went back in for another kiss. He could do this all day, for the rest of his days.
Castiel looked at Jack’s open expression, wholly different from the one he had worn only five minutes earlier. His mouth pursed, his hand covering his eyes. He looked sad, resigned, devoid of anger. It took him a few seconds to regain composure.
“How do I do this? How can I make it so that you won’t go against the rules again? What can I change?”
Dean’s eyes filled with tears as he saw Cas’ eyes, he too was blinking away the tears that threatened to fall. Moving slowly, almost hesitantly, he lifted his head to touch Cas' cheek. The scratchy sensation was strange at first, he hadn't held a man's face like this in many years, but seeing how Cas melted in his touch made his heart swell. He brought up his second hand and gently started stroking Cas' wrist, just a delicate touch on his skin, and made his way up to his shoulder to rest there.
“Did Jack ever mention her? When you were in heaven with him, did he say what happened to her? And to the others from the other world?”
His eyes went wide in understanding. Had Dean really missed him that much? That might explain why it had been so easy to crash his dreams, to use the man’s own expression. He tried to push down the wave of hope that came over him. When he told Dean that the happiness was in the being, not in the having, he’d meant every word of it. Yet he found that, confronted with a new life as a human, reciprocated love might be preferable. Maybe there was a chance that Dean felt the same for him. He’d certainly hinted at it in his dreams, but they only just spent time together, neither had ever taken the first step. While the realm of dreams was a safe place, it was also a plane where dreams and longing could be taken for something it wasn’t in the real world.
“You gonna drive or what?” Dean grumbled as Sam didn't move behind the wheel, but kept looking out of the window. He startled when he felt Sam's hands grab his leg with more force than necessary. Sam’s face was expressionless, but his eyes were on fire. His pupils were dilated and his breathing became shallower the more seconds passed. He looked like he was about to pass out. Dean waved his hands in front of Sam's face, but there was no reaction. He just kept looking.
“I want us to stop hunting. I want to find Eileen again, and start that life we talked about.” Sam’s Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed audibly.
“Do you want to stay here for a bit? To get your act back together? Take a little break? We can finish the last of the Harry Potter movies, we were only on number six.”
Castiel didn’t think rule two was a rule as such, but Dean allowing himself to ask for something for himself was a big thing. He knew better than to argue with that. Looking straight into Dean’s eyes he nodded solemnly. Heat rose up in his stomach as his lips caught Dean’s in a blistering kiss. If he’d ever wondered which room he was going to stay in today, he now knew for sure it would be Dean's.
Dean looked properly chastised and sunk back in his chair. There was some defiance left in Sam, but he deflated quickly as they let the magnitude of Jack’s words sink in. Castiel wasn’t happy with Jack’s reaction, but could see things from his point of view, even though he had rebelled and abused his powers to save Dean Winchester from certain death, time and time again, and he knew he’d do the same in a heartbeat. He couldn’t begrudge Sam his desire to bring back Eileen, but he also realized things had to change.
Castiel felt lighter when he heard Dean’s grumbling voice. While he knew his grace had healed most of the damage done, he’d been afraid there would have been lingering effects. The man seemed to be in good health, as long as he didn’t try to stand up too fast. Sam caught him just in time before he could fall onto the floor again. They both guided Dean back so he could sit while the fog lifted from his head.
Dean lay still on the floor of the library. He looked dead to the world, but the soft snores coming from his mouth said otherwise. Surrounded by empty bottles and disorganized books, he looked every bit as unhappy and destroyed as he’d been after Sam had jumped into the cage with Lucifer.
In his relief after being freed from Chuck’s cruel storytelling, Dean hadn’t even thought of asking Jack to bring back Cas. As he watched Sam’s softening features the longer he talked to Eileen, his stomach churned.
Castiel took a step back and felt Dean’s hand between his shoulders, offering silent support. He saw Sam look at him with a soft and encouraging smile. For the first time in ages, he felt that those feelings he had for them were returned. He could feel their love and friendship reach him without needing words. Dean slipped from behind his back, covering him with his body, and Sam too took a few steps so he was in between Castiel and Jack. His heart grew three sizes bigger now he saw and felt what it truly meant to be under the Winchesters’ protection. His human body was weak, powerless, but his family had his back.
That’s when Castiel knew it had hit Dean that he and Sam were not alone. He went still when those green eyes came to rest on him.
Neither man seemed to pay attention when the door to the kitchen opened to let Sam and Eileen in. Dean grinned in the kiss as he noticed Sam's face fall when Eileen patted her breast pocket.
Taking the stairs three at the time, Dean barrelled down to the kitchen. His head pounded and his stomach felt like it would make an unwelcome appearance any second now, but he didn’t care. He made it to the kitchen in no time. In a swift move, he threw the door open and looked inside.
“Guys? We really should get going before the cops show up. Those kids,” he pointed at the two young boys cowering in a corner, “need to go home too.”
"You don't need to speak, Dean. I heard you in your dream. It was your dream, our connection in that dream that allowed me to get away from the Empty. Your words, your feelings, made me see my sacrifice meant nothing if you ended up broken and defeated....again."
Castiel turned his head to catch Dean’s green gaze. His eyes were soft as he closed the gap between them. He closed his eyes and gave in to the feeling of Dean’s lips softly touching his. He kissed back with everything he had, this was what he’d dreamed of since his first time as a human. His feelings had been just as strong when he was still an angel, but his physical reaction to their proximity had never been as overwhelming as it was now. He held on tight as Dean’s tongue caressed his, both possessive and uncertain. He let out a soft, contented sigh when Dean moved his hand and took a hold of the hair in his neck. A warm, tingling feeling spread throughout his body at the touch and all he could do was hold on as their kiss grew just a bit more heated.
It wasn’t hard to see the man was in pain, and this might have been the last drop. Coming close to losing his brother for real, left on his own after everything that had happened? It would be enough to break a stronger man than Sam Winchester.
“So Jack told me Eileen is in heaven. Her place wasn’t in hell, but because of the nature of the spell, he could not bring her back. She,” Sam hesitated and glared at Jack, “she doesn’t belong.”
“Guys, I can’t! I can’t bend the laws of the universe every time because we’ve lost someone!” Jack exploded, his eyes glowing a dangerous gold, but he managed to get himself under control, “I came here to tell you I’m not going to watch you guys anymore. There will be no more higher power to intervene when things go wrong. You got this life, that’s it. Castiel and I, we finished rebuilding heaven. All souls are at rest and happy. What do you want more? You wanted Chuck gone, you have true free will. Isn’t that enough?”
“NO!”, Jack screamed, causing several light bulbs to burn out and the tv to start playing. Whenever he was upset, he tended to destroy things, but that didn’t matter right now.
Castiel held his breath for a fraction of a second, just long enough for Dean to close the gap between them and place the gentlest of kisses on his lips. When Dean broke the kiss, he rested his forehead against Castiel’s and smiled at him. Castiel swallowed and tentatively smiled back, liking the feeling Dean’s gaze gave him. This was the first time he’d ever been on the receiving end of this heated look, filled with promises of good times to come. He lifted one hand to cup Dean’s cheek and pulled him in for another kiss.
The glare of the early morning sun snatched Dean brutally out of his dream. His throat closed up when he realized Cas wasn’t there. Feeling deeply ashamed of his silly prayer and the tears that had fallen subsequently, he looked to his right. Sam was still fast asleep in the passenger seat, seemingly oblivious to Dean’s small breakdown earlier that night.
“I love you too,” he replied, just as quiet and tender as Dean’s words had been. He could feel the answering sigh, and Dean scooted just a little closer before they both fell asleep, tangled in the sheets and holding each other close.
“I missed you, you dick,” he breathed deeply, inhaling Cas’ scent like a drowning man, “you can’t do that, you know? You can’t drop a bomb like that on a man, and then just get sucked into the Empty.”
The road started to get more and more blurry, at the speed Dean was going, it probably wouldn't take long before something would happen. Sam remained asleep, exhausted after all that had happened in the last few days. If Dean's frantic driving didn't wake him up, a crash probably wouldn't either. Pushing the pedal further down, going faster and faster, Dean felt less and less aware of his surroundings. The effects of the alcohol were slowly seeping in, clouding over his mind and dulling his reactions. Dean realized he would end up sticking in the side of the road if he didn't slow down right now. He dragged himself out of the haze the whisky was putting him in and focused on the car and the road. With a final effort, he pulled over on a stretch of deserted road and allowed sleep to overtake him. The last thing he heard was Sam’s soft snoring.
Sam had found a way to contact Eileen in the afterlife, but when she realized he wasn’t moving on, she’d kicked his ass so thoroughly the poor guy no longer knew which way was up. In the end he gave up and decided to focus on helping out the few hunters that were left. He kept the library up to date and made sure everyone who needed it had access to the Men Of Letters’ archive. Miracle slept with him most nights, both as a cure for loneliness and as a refugee from Dean and Castiel’s endless lovemaking sessions.
A beach, a desolate beach filled with dead bodies and debris, was the first thing Castiel saw when he entered Dean’s dream. More and more bloody and mangled bodies washed ashore, the blood red sea never seemed to run out, until there was not a trace of sand to be found. He knew he could take control of the imagery, if only to turn the dream into something nicer for Dean, but he also realized this wasn’t the purpose of his visit. He had to talk to him, make sure he didn’t self-destruct as he was prone to do when he took everything too much to heart. The first thing he had to do was to look for Dean himself, and find how he manifested in his own dreams.
With a tender chuckle, he looked down and pressed a kiss to the top of Dean’s head. With one hand, he grabbed the duvet and pulled it over their rapidly cooling bodies.
Noticing that Dean hadn’t repeated his offer, that he didn’t want to give his life for hers, Castiel felt strengthened in his resolve.
It was only when they let go that Castiel could relax. His arms and legs felt heavier than ever. Recognizing this feeling as fatigue, he stood up with an apologetic smile and said he needed sleep, as he was now human.
“You always have a choice, that’s what the three of you taught me when I lived here. So how can you say you didn’t have a choice?”
Dean slammed the door in Sam’s face, leaving Sam standing in the corridor, with only Miracle’s confused look as company.
A soft smile settled over his features as he got inside the car and shoved Sam so he was behind the steering wheel.
Dean laughed as Cas threw the pan off the fire and into the sink, making yelping noises every time his hand touched the hot metal. Still shaking with laughter, he grabbed Cas' arm and pulled him close again.
Dean looked in the direction Sam was currently staring in, knowing the bunker was only a few hours away.
“You can only see events happening in real time. The future is no longer set, no one knows what will happen later on. Everything is up to them now.” Jack warned him before he took a deep breath and looked.
Cold feet? Now? Why would he get cold feet? This was Cas, his friend, his not-quite-brother, his... his angel. The one who had sacrificed his life again to save Dean’s, the one who saw through all of his bluster and bravado and still chose to love him, against his upbringing and everything he had stood for the first four million years of his existence. Imagining Cas standing at the stove, cooking Dean’s favorite breakfast, was the image that did it.
In a flash of blinding light Castiel disappeared. He didn’t know how he got away, but next thing he knew he was walking up to the barn where Sam and Dean were saying their last goodbyes. With one wave of his hand, he broke the door and saw the scene inside. Dean still stood against the wall, his forehead leaning against Sam’s. His body hadn’t given in yet. He had some strength left.
The young God still looked self confident and sure of his decisions, even faced with his father’s ire. He put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and drew him closer.
Jack nodded and pulled out a tray that looked suspiciously like a pensieve out of the Harry Potter movies. Castiel couldn’t suppress a grin when he realized Jack had probably shaped it exactly like that because of the meaning it carried. Their movie nights had left an impression on the kid. His expression turned serious again when he took the tray and looked into it.
Castiel let go of Dean’s hand and threw his arms up in an unusually theatrical gesture. Forcing himself to remain calm, he took a few deep breaths and got a little closer.
"So what you're trying to say is that you annoyed a cosmic being so much it kicked you out, two times in a row?"
The first thing they did was tear down all of the walls, gathering every soul in one place. Seeing souls gravitate towards one another, finding each other again after a long time, made Jack understand that people will always seek connection, with more than just their soulmates. Castiel looked over this process with mixed feelings, surprised that he could all process them even with his grace intact again.
They never discussed Castiel’s feelings, nor the way he’d finally told Dean about them. He noticed Dean acted differently in the dreams, that he didn’t hold back when he wanted to touch Castiel. He took his hands whenever they sat close, he hugged him every time Castiel showed himself. He never spoke up, but his actions filled the angel with joy. Dean’s physical shape changed with each of their encounters. The less anxious he became, the younger the man appeared. After a while, the only version of him Castiel still saw was the young, freckled man he had rescued from hell, but in his eyes lay the wisdom of the experienced hunter he’d left behind when the Empty took him. One who deserved rest and retirement, and had obviously found exactly that in his own dreams.
“You know why I did it, Jack. You know I had no choice. You gave us free will, it comes with consequences. There was nothing short of imprisoning me that you could have done to stop me.”
When he turned around he saw Jack. The young man’s hair was disheveled, his eyes wide with fear. There was no trace of his earlier confidence left.
There was no amount of booze, no hangover, nor a kick in the head strong enough to erase those words from his mind. In a desperate attempt to alleviate the pain in his chest, he let out a deep breath and gripped the steering wheel tighter. Cas’ tears tore at Dean’s heart, they would probably haunt him forever. His sacrifice had saved Dean’s life yet again, but he hadn’t been able to speak as his best friend was taken by that dark entity. Of course he loved him, but what shape that love was taking, Dean didn't know. He'd never considered Cas to be anything but a close friend, a brother. Taking another deep drink from the flask he kept in the Impala for just these occasions, he looked over at Sam with a smile on his face. At least he was still there, safe as he would ever be, and hopefully soon reunited with Eileen.
The dazzling smile on his baby brother's face as he handed over the money was worth it though, Dean had never seen Sam this happy in all the years they'd spent together. With a last squeeze he let go of Cas and moved back a bit so he could embrace both Sam and Eileen as well. Maybe everything they'd been through had been worth it, just so they could end up right here. He hugged his brother tight with his one arm while pulling Cas close with the other one. His lips found the angel's earlobe, and he kissed it softly.
Sam and Jack said their goodnights, but Dean just stood up and came with him. When they got down in the corridor, away from eventual prying eyes, Dean grabbed him by his lapels and pushed him against the wall.
Castiel opened his eyes and groaned. Fuck, his head hurt. He lifted his arms to assess the damage to his hands, but they looked fine. Before he could sit up, he was lifted by Dean, who moved him to rest into his lap.
After what felt like hours, he found the familiar light of Dean’s soul emanating from a small boy with the brightest green eyes. The boy stood in a corner of a battlefield that was filled with dead monsters as well as humans. He kept his eyes averted from the light Castiel’s true form spread out over the whole plane. The angel treaded carefully as he made his way to the young kid, knowing that he could disappear as soon as he realized what was going on. Dean could also banish him from his dreams. He was fairly certain that wouldn’t happen, but he had no idea if Dean would be happy to see him now.
The creatures were advancing on Dean. Sam was trying to help the two kids they’d kidnapped while Dean was fighting off the vamps. They both looked exhausted, but whether it was the fight that had worn them down or something else, Castiel couldn’t say. He hadn’t been looking for more than a few seconds when he saw Dean getting slammed into the wall. The man didn’t move, he didn’t try to get away. He stayed where he was, waiting for Sam to finish the last of the nest.
Any thought of crashing in Dean’s bed, or in his own old room, dissipated when he saw Jack sitting in the living room. Sam and Dean wanted to go and welcome him home, but Castiel held them back with a wave of his hand, his other hand slipping effortless into Dean’s. To his surprise, both Sam and Dean followed his lead without any questions. This time, he was the one who didn’t trust his, or rather, their son.
“Dean… he wants out. He’s been applying for jobs for the past month,” Sam chuckled, “he thinks I don’t know, but he’s not as good in hiding his search history as he thinks. It will be good for him. Now that you’re back, he might even be able to enjoy it.”
Hours later the three of them made it back to the bunker. The ride had been quiet. Castiel had updated them on the state of things in heaven, including Jack’s new rules, the closing of heaven and hell. Sam updated Castiel on their family, he told him about Claire and Kaia venturing out on their own more and more. Castiel couldn’t suppress a smile when Sam told him Claire would definitely want to see him again, but then things got quiet. He sat in the front next to Dean, their hands clasped tightly together. There was still a lot to be said, but they could do that later. His, now very human, body was screaming for rest.
This went on for nearly a month. When he watched Sam and Dean, he could see both of them move on. They went back to hunting the monsters that were still running amok, they established a routine. Castiel was glad to see them go back to their job. He knew their time as hunters was running out. With the monster population on earth dwindling, it wouldn’t take a year before there were none left. This knowledge was comforting, and it wouldn’t be long before both brothers would be truly free to live the lives they deserved.
Castiel didn’t hesitate to squeeze Dean’s fingers between his, completely ignoring Sam’s gasp and his smug grin. His face lit up as he smiled at Dean, finding his own emotions mirrored on that beautiful face of his. Their conversations in Dean’s dreams came back to him full force. He had to stop himself from burying his face in the man’s neck as long as he wasn’t sure his feelings were fully reciprocated.
With the last of his grace, he finished healing Dean, who now lay unconscious on the floor of the barn. His breathing was steady and his face was no longer gray and drawn. Castiel supposed Dean would wake up any minute now. He sat opposite Sam, but kept his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Sam paled at first, but soon the skin around his temple turned pink. His eyes, filled with tears and regret at first, then grew hard and dangerous. This was the fearsome hunter Castiel knew Sam could be. His breathing quickened, and he grasped his knee for leverage.
“Can you get him out? Please?”, his voice broke and after a deep breath he continued, “I’ve never asked for anything for myself in my life, but could you please do this for me, for Cas. He doesn’t deserve to rot in the empty. He saved me yet again, please...”
Sam’s eyes were wide, holding all kinds of questions, but Dean settled in against the window and promptly fell asleep, probably helped by the amount of alcohol in his system.
Castiel looked at Jack, really looked at him. The boy looked lost, completely out of his depth. He tried to do the right thing, but he found himself walking into walls time and time again. Rebuilding heaven hadn’t been easy, they’d had a lot of resistance from the other angels, and from a lot of the souls who had been at peace for a long time, and yet Jack had pushed through, only because he knew Dean would be pleased when he finally arrived. Pleasing his family had been the kid’s first priority, so it wasn’t a surprise he was torn between doing the right thing and making Sam happy.
For a moment Castiel contemplated ripping out his newly replenished grace and going to find the Winchesters, but when Jack showed him the state heaven was in he knew he couldn’t leave. Not yet. So they went to work.
Cas’ plea for him was music to his ears and he shuddered a little from the desperation in his voice. “Hm?” His thumb brushed over his slit, trailing down to trace along the underside as his other hand worked quicker.
"Mm, but I am an asshole, Dean." He caught the pillow, the smile still evident on his lips. "You don't look old. She just- she's an idiot," He murmured, ignoring the Lisa comment. It hurt, even though it shouldn't. He shouldn't care who Dean fucked, but he did care. Just a little bit. He would have to get some headphones for the flight.
about to demand an explanation when he felt Deans palm drag slowly over his crotch. Cas fell silent and squirmed a little, panting softly.
“Thanks.” Dean closed the door behind her and walked back over to his bed, climbing in. “But, listen. It’s not gonna help me sleep at all if you just stand there and stare at me. So would you mind sitting with me?”
Dean chuckled. “Alright, so we both had bad nights. That means I can laugh at you too, huh? Since I’m also an asshole.” He smirked. “Ohh, you know people, huh? Look at you, Mr. connections. Maybe I’ll need your help getting into parties,” he teased. “It’s not like I’m a celebrity or anything.”
Cas was relieved when Dean climbed in and his ridiculously cute voice had him grinning and laughing. "How could I be late to see such a handsome face?" He muttered, leaning in to kiss him.
“Don’t apologize, Castiel. I offered.” Dean rolled away from him, pulling the covers over his head to burrow into them and closed his eyes. He was too tired to think about the consequences of what just happened. He’d deal with it later, if at all.
Dean sighed, letting her hold onto him and he wrapped his arms around her waist. “Can I ask you for a favor?” He murmured, glancing down at her.
"Well now you will never know." He chuckled lightly, wiping a little cum from his own stomach and sweeping it across his lips. "Mm. Now give me those handcuffs and lay down."
“Sure, sounds great.” Dean got dressed, putting the robe back in the closet and laughing softly at Cas. “You had my cock in your mouth earlier today and you’re still looking away when I change. You’re...interesting, Castiel.” He sat back on his bed, grabbing the remote.
It was creeping around to midnight and a very hungover Cas was dried out from puking, his eyes heavy and he was sick of being unable to sleep. He brushed his teeth and grabbed his coat, deciding to go for a walk to the 24 hour diner down the block from the hotel. He needed to think and make somewhat of a plan on how to get back to the states.
He reached down, wrapping his hand around his cock and bringing his lips to Cas’ ear. “Oh! It’s so big...can’t believe it fit...” he mocked, then broke out laughing.
"Okay, come on. We need to make sure we can sneak you back in," Cas murmured, reluctantly pulling back. He scooted to the door of the limo, then immediately froze, seeing the last person on earth that he wanted to see at that moment.
"Please, I want you inside me, Dean. I’m so wet; I want you to pull my hair and fuck me like a dog," she whimpered, looking at him with desperation in her eyes.
"Tomorrow is my day off. So you will have another guard taking care of you. I don't think hanging out would be a good idea. Plus, I'm sure someone else would enjoy your company."
"Better than meh." He rolled his eyes, nudging Dean gently. He was going to say something sarcastic, but the look on Dean's face meant he was serious. He reached down and laced his fingers gently with Dean’s, squeezing it just a touch. Weirdly, it felt more intimate than the sex they’d just had. "You are welcome," he murmured.
“Night,” Dean replied, stretching himself out across Cas as he slowly fell asleep. It’d been a weird day, both good and bad, and he was relieved it was over. And draped over Cas like this, it was the best sleep he’d had in months.
Dean’s eyes widened a little as he glanced down at Cas, parting his legs and leaning back against the couch cushion.
"Should we go take a shower? Even if you do smell like chocolate which is delicious," Cas murmured softly, hugging him tightly for a short moment before relaxing and letting him go.
“Okay.” Dean pulled back and slid his sunglasses on again, putting his hood up. He took out his wallet and paid for what Cas had ordered, then offered him his hand. It had been a crazy day, but he was glad it was ending with Cas by his side. And he knew he’d made the right decision.
“Ooh, I’m intrigued.” Dean couldn’t get out of that shower fast enough, examining the towel carefully before he hesitantly wrapped it around his hips.
Dean leaned his head back and closed his eyes. This was what he’d driven Cas to over the past 24+ hours. And he was pleased. As slutty as he was, he’d never crossed this boundary with someone who worked for him before.
Cas nostrils flared. Dean was being a little bitch that morning, so he had to suck it up, "My apologies." His eyes fell to the bruise, last night worming its way back into his thoughts. He swallowed, taking his position next to the door.
"That is fine," Cas answered. He was hoping to get some time off to go sightseeing, but this was his job; he would just have to save up and come back to London another time.
“Thanks.” Dean smiled, scooting the cart over to him and starting on the waffles. “Mm!” He exclaimed with his mouth full. “These are awesome.”
Dean clenched his fists. Of course Jo was behind this. His blood was boiling. “Are there cameras in my room now? Do you have access to it?”
“What, huh?” Dean groaned, rubbing his eyes sleepily and pouting at the lack of contact as Cas climbed off of him.
Cas looked down at Dean, his eyes desperate and he cried out, coming into his mouth. He panted heavily, his body shaking as he got lost in a dizzying high of pleasure.
“Hey, so uh, this should go without saying, but this money I’m giving you is also assurance that you’re not gonna leak the footage anywhere and you’re gonna delete it, right?”
Cas had a point. And he wasn’t really sure what to say to that. “You’re not gonna lose your job unless I fire you. No one’s gonna find out about this. But I get it if you wanna stop. You’ve got more to lose than I do.” That half hour had gone by much more quickly than he’d thought. And he was still a little buzzed.
Cas laughed and nudged Dean back, straddling his waist and pinning him down to the cheap mattress. “Gimme that.” He took  the chocolate container and scooped out a decent fingerful. He slid it between his plush lips with an elated, soft moan.
Dean stepped out of the limo and into the hotel, going up to his room where the party had been set up for him. Jo had made him paranoid, afraid that whoever had brought in the champagne had also installed cameras, but he couldn’t see any. So he greeted the fans as they walked in and poured their drinks, making sure he went light on the drinking himself so he wasn’t too out of it to see Cas later.
"Dean. It's okay." Cas reached out, his voice soft as he brushed his hand over Dean’s shoulder momentarily.
Dean leaned back on his palms as he spoke, his eyes trained on Cas. “I brought the handcuffs with me. Couldn’t fit the paddle in my pocket, sadly, but I would’ve brought it too. I’d want you to handcuff me to the bed, then sit between my legs. Then, you’d grasp your cock and slowly brush the head at a torturously slow pace along my shaft until I come all over you. Then I’d want you to uncuff me and grab me by my hair and shove me down until I’ve licked you clean.”
Cas growled as Dean ground his cock up against his, his length hard and pre-leaking, a pearl of cum slipping down his dick. "Lube. Condom?" Cas asked, wondering if they were as easy to access as just being on the side table. He couldn't wait to have Dean screaming under him. That would be a sound he would never forget.
Cas finished, leaning up to gently pick the lock on Dean’s handcuffs and they fell off in a clatter. He moved to lay beside Dean properly, his fingers gently combing through his dark hair.
“I don’t care,” Dean grunted out, soft, desperate cries pouring from his lips as Cas made him melt beneath him. “Fuck, fuck!” His hands slid up from his hips to glide along his abdomen and chest, feeling his heated, muscular body beneath his fingers.
Cas smirked, taking his time as he leaned back against the tiles and let out a pleased sigh. His favourite pastime was most definitely giving Dean a shower show.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Come on, your hair’s soft. And long. Like a hippie.” He eyed the back shelf of designer sunglasses. It wasn’t like he needed a new pair, but it wouldn’t hurt to buy some while he was out. It was hardly the weather for it, but it’d disguise him a little more at least.
Now that Dean knew there were cameras in the room, they were easy to spot and he couldn’t believe he’d missed them before. But he guessed they couldn’t be found unless someone was actively trying to find them. Satisfied, he asked, “do you really need it in hard cash? That’s gonna be a pain in the ass for me. I could just send it to you electronically or something.”
