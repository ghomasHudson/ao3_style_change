Smoke billows from the half-collapsed building as the camera pans down over the covered bodies of those not fortunate enough to escape the destruction. The chaotic scene is intercut with camera footage of Wanda sending a flaming ball into the nearest solid object which just happened to be a building with three hundred people in it. The count is at eighty-nine dead, but Tony expects that number will change. Wanda killed citizens of Lagos and the fallout from this will hit critical mass.
As they enter a vast room Tony takes it all in. These might be cryo tubes and there is something inside of each one.
"As I imagine losing you and this child will have a profound impact on Captain Rogers." The hand pressed down on the wound on his side, a small warning of things to come. "But first we have a trip to make."
Tony looks down at the pregnancy test still clutched firmly in his hand. He starts to explain though he figures it should be obvious.
Natasha shrugs and turns her attention back to Tony. She touches the side of his neck, there's a pulse, her fingers come away wet with blood pooling beneath his head. Tony's eyes open slowly, his mouth moving to say something she can't understand. She leans in close, trying to hear over the persistent ringing in her ears "B-baby." He whispers taking the hand she’s resting on his chest and moving it down. She gets it.
"That doesn't explain it. He'd have to have some ties to someone at the signing and everyone there was vetted or has been in the past. He couldn't know we'd all be there. The only Avenger that the press knew for sure would be here was Tony." Natasha says
"Bomb went off in the west corridor, just outside the command center. Whoever planted it knew what they were doing" Sharon explains.
Miles away a plane bound for an unknown destination sits, waiting to take off. Helmut Zemo looked over the prone form of one of the men that caused him so much pain. Tony Stark would pay for what he'd done to Sokovia. Unfortunately, the other part of the plan had fallen through. Barnes had failed to secure Rogers and the man would no doubt be on the warpath until he got his teammate back. That could work to his advantage. All he had to do was leave enough breadcrumbs for Rogers to follow, make it clear to come alone. Not that he expected Rogers would, too many loyal friends for them to allow him to do that. Still he would come all the same.
"Again, that not what I want to talk about.” Tony puts a hand up as Steve seems to be settling into a longer statement. “A lot has happened while you’ve been chasing Rumlow for the last month" He starts go on but Steve's phone buzzes. Steve’s brow furrows for a moment before a look of dread comes across his features.
Zemo laugh "Nothing. After seeing what the famed Winter Soldier could do, I wouldn't want any more of them in the world. Him, like them, like you, are what happens when power goes unchecked."
"He left." Rhodey's face goes murderous. His hands ball into fists like he could beat Steve to a pulp, but he never raises his voice, "You told him you were pregnant, and he just left you standing there?"
"Agent Carter." A squirming agent approaches. Sharon joins him off to the side. He whispers something, and Sharon's face goes white. She comes back to them
“Maybe. Probably. It wouldn't be just you. We’d do everything we can to prevent that.” Tony says and she gives Tony a small smile.
Steve shakes his head "We're going to have to make do. I don’t want to pull Wanda from the compound. Things are chaotic enough around her and I don’t want her in more trouble then she needs to be."
Natasha comes to first, head throbbing and ears ringing. She rolls onto her side, coughing as smoke and debris fill her mouth.  Blinking repeatedly until her vision stops swimming, she tries to take in as much of the room as she can.
Christ! Steve hadn't considered that. Zemo wanted Tony dead but what if he decided it was soothing to his soul to sell Tony and the vast amounts of military knowledge he'd have. Not for the money but for the knowledge that his enemy would suffer.
Steve wasn’t used to feeling this helpless, not in a long time. Bucky was sedated downstairs, but the impostor had escaped and now Tony is missing.
Zemo presses a blade against his throat. “I lost everyone." Tony swallow thickly. As he inches closer the man's eyes appear black, cold and unrelenting.
Rhodey taps a few keys and the phone lights up. Its a little dinged up but still works. They all look surprised at his ability "I went to MIT too and he’s my best friend."
To make himself busy he set out some clothes to Steve. It feels pointless and stupid in the face of what is happening, but he does it anyway. It makes him feel oddly domestic. Steve comes out almost an hour later and dresses without a word. Tony stays seated on the small sofa adjacent to the bed.
Tony smiles. “I had some extra time yesterday when we arrived in Vienna so I figured a picture was worth a thousand words.”
Something gleams in Bucky's hand, a jagged piece of twisted metal. He swipes at Steve, once, twice and the third time proves to be the charm when Steve cries out as the weapon splits skin along his left forearm.
Jarvis is already on task, bringing up floating screens of various news networks before Tony has a chance to ask. It’s about the Avengers. Tony takes a deep breath; Steve nor any of the others are dead but they probably wish they were among the casualties instead of this.
Sam jumps into the mix, holding Bucky's legs as Sharon grabs the syringe from where is skid across the floor and jabs it into Barnes neck; Bucky stills beneath them instantly.
“And you thought this was going to be boring.” Sam teases extending a hand to help Sharon to her feet.
Tony shakes his head "He's flying to London for the funeral. He'll meet us in Vienna. After we get it all straight with the accords, I'll make an omelet and tell him." He says to Rhodey. Natasha eyes them both but doesn’t press the issue.
Bucky laughs but it's far from joyful. "Your mom's name was Sarah. You used to wear newspaper in your shoes."
"Tony! Tony, I need you to open your eyes.” She shakes him, not too hard in case there are injuries she can’t see. “Come on Tony. I need you to open your eyes!"
"Hold on! Steve, can I talk to you for a second." Sam doesn't wait for an answer before pulling Steve into the corridor. "You wanna head into a death trap with him watching our six."
Tony is there, beside him. The laughter fades to a soft smile as he turns to look at Steve directly in the eyes for the first time.
Bucky catches him at the end of a shift guarding the Stones, and pulls him aside. “You’ve been out of it for weeks, Steve. We’ve all noticed it.”
“Indeed! Lady Stark speaks truly. Let us celebrate with joy the lives of our fallen friends, and the victory they brought!”
He’s been avoiding Bruce, because the mournful, disapproving look he knows he’ll get is a hell of a lot more intimidating on the Hulk’s features. Unfortunately, he gets called in to run tests with the transporter.
“It’s going to be me,” Steve says, final. It’s the first time he’s felt like their leader in a while.
“It’s my fault,” Steve says, suddenly. “I made him do this, Pepper. He told me he didn’t want to give-” he sweeps his hand in a gesture at the house “-
Steve suddenly sees himself laughing with Tony and Nat somewhere on a couch, watching television with the other Avengers. He knows Strange is right.
Steve watches as the scene changes, and monsters attack. He watches himself die now, getting shot, getting crushed by a giant. Being sliced in half by some sort of masked warrior.
“Spider-Man, get it together,” he snaps, and the kid wilts under his disapproval. Steve feels bad immediately. It’s hard on the kid too, being in an open training field with nothing to swing from. Completely out of his element. But he has to get used to it – that’s what training is for. So nobody has to die needlessly.
“Of course,” Strange says, smoothly. “Regardless, he knew the cost, and he did not hesitate to make his choice.”
“Dad’s the best Avenger,” Morgan says, and her round face breaks into the first smile Steve’s seen on her. “You’re Cap, a stinky mean-face. He told me who you are.”
“Steve,” Bucky says. He might have been saying his name for a while. Fondness for his best friend breaks through, overcomes him, and he gets up and hugs Bucky fiercely.
“Wise of you,” Strange murmurs, flowing down the staircase as though he’s walking on air rather than wood and carpet. “Or rather, wise of Banner, perhaps.”
Steve sits in silence with that thought for a minute. “It doesn’t seem fair. He spent all this time warning us, and he had to die for it, too.”
Steve smiles. “We’ll always be friends deep down – the six of us. I wish I’d known what we had, back at the beginning.”
“We won,” he says, and feels tears sting at his eyes. He walks forward to Tony – to the body of Tony Stark. Rhodey has taken Pepper in his arms, and Steve knows it’s his responsibility to deal with the body of his fallen comrade. He closes Tony’s eyes shut with a gloved hand, digs under the armour to lift Tony up in his arms. He walks, with Tony’s limp body, his head hanging slack towards the sky. The other Avengers are falling in, murmuring his name like a prayer. “Iron Man,” they say with reverence, grief and tenderness. “Stark,” and “Tony.”
want compared to that? I don't know that I can be what you need. Most of the time I tell myself we'll be okay and hope like hell, but like this,"— he took a shaky breath — "I can't push it down. Damnit, Steve. You should have left me alone until it wears off."
He found the moment inexplicably peaceful between one breath and the next, and then he was out cold.
Tony's head was swimming by the time he finished hugging Howard, thanking him for wanting to try to be a good dad. Steve was watching him from behind one of the military trucks out in the yard, and he had signaled he already had the Pym particles in hand. Tony clenched the handle of the briefcase with the Tesseract and made himself step back from his dad. Jarvis was already opening the door of the car, and Tony wrenched himself away from him, too. The thought of what it would be like to abandon the plan and talk himself into Howard's good graces in order to get invited into his home to see Maria was like a persistent insect buzzing around Tony's head. He pulled away from them before he did something stupid. These people would go on to live their own lives, while Tony would always miss them.
"...Even if we get inside, Pym moved his stuff." Steve rallied around the change of subject like a champ. They'd hashed this out to death earlier that day. It would take time to figure out where Pym stashed his miniaturized equipment and even when they did, getting inside would prove difficult; Pym was a paranoid bastard.
It was up to him to get them back home. Leaving Steve alone in the past wasn't an option, but Tony couldn't abandon Morgan either; she needed him. The thought of being torn away from her like this, through his own mistakes, was unbearable. He couldn't live out his life here, in this time, and never get to see her again. But the only way he could see to stealth back on that base was with a disguise, and Tony would need time to build that.
"Save your strength," Tony stressed, mind running through their options. A hospital? How would they explain it after the break in at a SHIELD facility? But if Steve needed it—
"What were you gonna do for fun?" Steve asked with a quiet patience that made Tony cut a glance to him again. Steve's probing blue gaze caught him and wouldn't let go.
the one who always changes," Tony protested, baffled. He lifted his head off his make-shift pillow. "For one, I became Iron Man. And—"
he says he got dosed with truth serum and he won't be coming out of the workshop today. At all. Not even for the wedding reception."
Tony's expression changed from concern to a stricken mix of pain and anxiety at this. He said, "Are you okay? Your head? Hurts bad?" He brushed the side of Steve's forehead, where Steve suddenly realized he had a bandage covering his temple.
The stranger was also securely fastened to Tony at the knees, with what looked like two dog leashes, only one of which ended in Tony's hand. When Tony examined the predicament they found themselves in, he realized the man had a black dog with him, a breed with distinctive looks that Tony had no trouble placing when it already came up to his knee as a puppy.
"Okay." Steve nodded. He shuddered, then straightened his spine, visibly steeling himself. "We'll talk then. I can wait."
Steve stared up into the starry sky, wide-eyed with a sudden thought. "Did you give me mouth-to-mouth?"
"Tony?" Steve called, and his expression showed concern even through the unfamiliar features of the image inducer.
Steve nodded, picking at the cuff of his uniform. "I'll need different clothes, so I can move around more easily."
"We did defeat Thanos; you were there." Tony frowned. His fingers brushed the bandages on Steve's head. He glanced towards the bedroom door, reluctance on his face. "I really should at least get someone—"
"Damn, right." Tony said, returning that smile, before it vanished as he watched, terrified, Steve's eyelashes flutter closed again.
"Let's try to keep a low profile, the hotel guy already thinks I'm on my way to Woodstock." Tony ran a thumb over his bearded chin.
"I should send you back to the future," Tony muttered, feeling that last remaining vial burning a hole in his pocket. He'd thought of doing it earlier, while Steve was asleep-going-on-unconscious. Tony could simply wrap Steve's fingers around the handle of the briefcase with the Tesseract and send him on his way. But the trip through the quantum realm was a little rough, and waiting until Steve was more stable seemed wise.
The voice belonged to Tony Stark, a short guy with bushy brown hair and big dark eyes. Steve knew him from school halls, they had some mutual friends but they never actually interacted expect that one time they sat together in detention and they briefly met. But that was two years ago. Tony ended up in detention because he blew up the chemistry lab and Steve got detention for being in a fight. To be fair he was trying to stop some jocks from bullying another kid and got punished for it.
“So I think your car is okay now, he made trough the operation” Steve gave Tony a small smile. “Could you please turn in the engine”
He got out of the car opening the hood when he was hit with a lot of smoke. He swore loudly, punching his car with his leg. Anger was slowly starting to build in him. He could walk home but he was way to tired and he lived way to far away. And he also had no money for cab and the bus was long gone.
“Yeah I mean I love fixing stuff and right know I’m really bored so you are lucky guy Rogers, and like I’m kind of a genius so yeah I can tutor you math and chemistry if you want” Tony give him a small smile, and Steve was a bit shocked.
“I need to tell you something, and like you don’t have to say it back or anything, I know you probably won’t because you know you are Tony Stark and I’m well me.
He parked outside of the workshop walking behind Tony. Once Tony unlocked the door, Steve went and sat on the couch and Dum-e immidetly brought him his favourite juice he thanked the robot and drank it slowly. Than his phone buzzed and he unlocked it.
Steve thinks about Peggy, because he is always thinking about Peggy. In between the action, in the silences and down-time he’s had over the past decade, his mind always drifts towards the
“For what it’s worth, Tony would have wanted you all to get absolutely trashed in his memory. I believe he would have considered it an insult if you don’t cause at least two international incidents tonight,” she smiles. Thor claps her roughly on the back.
Steve follows her, curious. When he sees Nicholas J. Fury standing on the edge of the pier, hands clasped behind his back, he feels almost disappointed. Steve wonders if he was there for the funeral, or just flew in at the right time to talk shop. As he walks towards him, he has a brief impulse to push him into the water, just to take out his restless energy on
Steve had never liked it when the scientists talked as though he wasn’t there. “Is there anything I should know?”
A weird expression crosses Bruce’s face. “And that’s… if you’re asking what I think you are. I mean, if you’re going to do that anyway. What’s another minor deviation from the plan, right?”
“Well,” Bruce says finally. “If you’re going to take them back, you should talk to Strange before you leave. His teacher is the only reason I know we have to take them back in the first place. He might know something else important, in case we screw it up again.”
“It wasn’t the only option,” Strange repeats. “It was the only outcome I could influence to happen with the limited time I had. But if I’d seen this coming sooner, if things had been different, I know Tony need not have died. That thought haunts me, but of course, any action I have taken could have had much better or worse outcomes-”
Steve hides his face in his hand. “I didn’t ask you to do this for us. I didn’t know we’d be losing you, Tony.”
Banner stops working and considers him for a moment. “You know, you’re really not as heartless as Tony always made out, are you?”
He wants to punch something. To go for a sprint, or throw his now-broken shield. Tony isn’t here to fix it this time, he supposes. He’s not really sure why Tony fixed it up in the first place. What was Steve to Tony – just some guy begging him to save the world yet again, pretending there wasn’t a very real chance he’d die in the course of doing so?
“Did Tony know?” Steve asks, suddenly, remembering. “He said that you knew how to stop it, that we had one chance. Did you tell him he had to die?”
“So it will be you,” Thor says, as though he hasn’t spoken. “And as such, I have a favour to ask you.”
Steve nods, ready for anything. But he isn’t ready for tears to fill Thor’s eyes, and for him to choke pleadingly, “Find a way to tell my brother - to tell him I love him. I believed I would see him again when I was there, and now I know I will never get him back. Tell him that for me, Captain.”
“There are so many universes,” Strange starts. The scene shifts, and he’s there again, in a different place and time, with Thor beside him. Now Bucky. Now Hulk, and Natasha.
The last dream he has, Tony is sitting on the edge of the same pier where they held his funeral. Steve sits down on the pier next to him, his jeans sinking into water that isn’t wet, or cold. Everything is unnaturally still. Steve wonders if this is Tony’s heaven, or some version of it.
It’s a good idea as it turns out, other than the vastly increased rate of property damage that comes from housing heroes together. They all get along, more or less, and the collection of exuberant personalities help some of the older Avengers – Wanda, Rhodey, Bruce, Clint - not dwell as much on the ones they lost.
He lowers his arm, squinting against the light. When can see again, his vision adjusts to the sight of a field of enemies turning to ash.
“Steve?” Pepper’s voice calls out from behind him. He turns around, and finds her with Morgan shyly tucked behind her legs. “You okay?”
“Okay, dear,” Pepper calls back in a long-suffering voice. Steve snorts with a choked laugh despite himself.
“Watch out, Rogers,” Carol calls from above, and Steve ducks just in time to avoid being blasted by a stray energy beam.
Steve flinches. “You’re telling me that if we – if we had agreed on things, signed off on the Accords, been a team – this wouldn’t have happened.”
Steve cowers under the offensive. “I’m sorry. I am. Tony, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to lead, without you here. I need you.”
“It is hard to celebrate when we have lost those we love,” Thor observes. “I almost think it fortunate that most here did not know them, so they do not mourn and suffer as we do.”
Steve thinks. Tony talked about him to Pepper. Complained, probably. All this time, all these years separated and angry at one another seem so idiotic and fruitless now.
“I’m so fucking torn up about Nat I feel like going back to being Ronin,” Clint admits. “Killing people, to feel like I’m avenging
“He liked to pretend to be you,” Thor says, chuckling. “He thought you were unbearably good, even more than he thought I was.”
“I can’t help it,” Steve admits. “I saw her. When I went back, with Tony. I saw her in 1970, and she was so beautiful, and I couldn’t talk to her, and I-”
“I hope you know what you’re doing,” Bruce says, measuring out Steve’s shoulders for some sort of calculation. “But,” he says, pausing, looking for something. “Ah. It's probably best that it’s you.”
He watches the scene play out like a movie, the grieving boy, the sobbing wife – widow. The sobbing widow. Tony’s dead, the smile fading from his lips, the light gone from his eyes.
“Will we see you again, after tomorrow morning?” he asks quietly. “How will I know you made it through okay?”
Strange considers him for a moment, holding one hand upwards and twirling magical symbols around his index finger. “Many things you should know, entire libraries of things. A few vital things of importance, but none to do with time travel – or perhaps everything to do with it. It depends, I suppose. How much you want to do, or not. Everything depends on the human heart, in the end.”
“Steve, I don’t know if you’ll get this,” Tony starts, then pauses. “Look, okay. I know, this will sound stupid, but things just don’t seem to be working out lately, and sometimes I worry you’ll die, or I’ll die, and we’ll never kiss and make up, and honestly? I’m right, Rogers, and you’re an arrogant prick, and if I die at least I’ll die with you knowing that I was right, but-”
“Thank you, Thor,” Steve says, clinking his glass against Thor’s oversized tankard. Thor smiles at him, and gets up to join the others. “Who wants another round?” he roars, to cheers and whooping noises.
Strange smiles, that irritating, arrogant smirk that seems to imply he knows all the secrets of the world.
“He saw the future, you know that. Or a vision, a nightmare, if you will. Whole world of heroes dead, because of him. I told him, it was nothing he could set in motion on his own. You know what he thought the worst part of it was, though? That he didn’t die too, with the rest of you.”
Steve doesn't know where his unkind thoughts come from. That Pepper can finally get a break, that Morgan won’t have to grow up with an alcoholic, irresponsible father. There’s an anger inside him that’s wholly inappropriate for a funeral. He’s so angry at Tony, and he doesn’t even know why. For dying? For leaving his wife and kid here, alone?
“I – suppose. Black, please,” Steve says, nonplussed. Strange ushers him through to a sitting area, the antique armchairs far too beautiful and expensive looking for Steve to feel comfortable sitting on. Strange procures a teapot from the air and delicate matching tea cups alongside it.
He folds the paper over delicately, and tears off a new piece of paper from the pad. This one is harder to write. The Avenger’s faces flash through his mind, and he struggles to find the words to encompass the feeling of love and protectiveness he has for them all.
“Why did you never summon Captain Marvel to help us before, anyway?” Steve counters. “We could have used her aid countless times.”
“Well,” Tony replies, looking at Steve with exasperated fondness. “I got your second chance right here, Cap.”
“Your caped crusaders did what they had to,” Steve says, coldly. “Nat and Tony – they gave up everything for it. Why are you here, Fury? Are you going to ask me to bring the band back together already?”
“If I tell you what happens, you’ll be driven half-mad with the millions of possibilities and lives you will never be able to have or experience. I will not be responsible for Captain America’s derangement.”
“Thanks, Morgan,” Steve says, crouching down to her height. “Your dad was really – he was really amazing, you know that right?”
“A word of advice; sometimes you have to go back before you can move forward. I won’t hold that against you. But others might. Be kind to them.”
“Some do,” Steve says quietly. Wanda sits across from them in the huge space, on another set of assorted chairs Bruce has dragged in from somewhere. She’s staring at her drink, quiet and contemplative. Pepper seems to have left. Clint never showed at all.
he would,” Bruce says, peering at Steve over his too-small glasses. “I know I probably would too, even though I know how damn stupid that is. Plus, the Hulk isn’t exactly good for stealth,” he says, waving a gigantic arm in a gesture at himself. “And there’s the fact Rhodey would probably use the opportunity to say goodbye to Tony, in his own way.”
“You both have the singular ability to make the universe go very well or very poorly depending on how friendly you are feeling towards each other on a given day,” Strange replies sardonically. “Of course it’s a lot more complicated than that, but nevertheless, your friction in our reality brought several levels of hell down on us all.”
Tony had always told him to get a life, hadn’t he? To be selfish, for once? What did he, Steve Rogers, want?
Pepper shakes her head. “Tony was never going to sit by and watch other people save the world for him, Cap. You know that as well as I do.”
Steve feels like he’s fighting a losing battle. At least some people are working well together. Valkyrie and Okoye are well matched, and Bucky and Sam are engaging in fluid hand-to-hand, although Sam is finding it hard to keep up with Bucky’s stamina.
As though to prompt him, he puts his hand over Steve’s, a strangely comforting gesture. There’s warmth radiating from his gaze. Steve feels himself lose lucidity, the dream shifting into something else, something unknowable.
They move the Avengers into a new facility, an old Stark mansion. Fury says Tony left it to them all in his will. He keeps them all there while they set up communicators that will work across vast distances and even different realms. “If it happened once, it can happen again,” Fury quips, and forbids them from leaving until he’s processed them all into his systems. “Besides, it’s a good opportunity to bond with your fellow heroes.”
“The Ancient One knew that the condition of giving you that stone was that you would return them to their rightful place. A universal constant, you see? At least, if we can help it. Other things don’t matter as much – other things shift and change, but some things affect the fabric of reality more profoundly.”
friends, Fury. I know how much he cared, alright, I know we both screwed up, and now he’s dead and I can’t change any of it, so what is the
“Jerk,” Steve laughs, and then leans his head against Bucky’s right shoulder, resting. Just for a moment.
“When the Guardians leave, I think I will leave with them,” Thor says. “I don’t know when I shall return here.”
release any kind of projectiles until I give the okay!” Steve barks, flinging his makeshift wooden shield across the field to protect The Wasp from a stray rocket launched by Shuri.
“That was not your decision. You would have done the same in his place. I know it.” Thor pauses, and looks out the window once more.
Steve considers the hammer, lying on the kitchentop. “I’m glad you did. We may well not have won without it.”
Steve feels his heart sink in his chest. “I hope not,” he says quietly. Bruce seems to notice his expression close up.
It’s Steve’s attempt to do what Fury wanted and lead a giant team of heroes, but he feels rudderless, overwhelmed by the change in numbers and dynamics between people. Everyone starts chatting to each other and showing off, and Steve feels himself grow more irritated by the second.
Nebula curses as her attack misses, and strikes Clint hard sideways, sending him flying into War Machine’s armour, which clangs loudly at the impact and knocks
“I appreciate that,” Steve says slowly. They walk off, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts, but he’s barely picked up his gun when he senses someone else emerge from the shadows.
“What can I say,” Fury says, turning back towards the house and clapping Steve on the shoulder. “You’ve earned it, Captain. Think about it, won’t you?”
Pepper has words of thanks for everyone who has come together for him. She never wails, or weeps, just smiles through glistening eyes and looks peaceful. Perhaps there’s a part of her that can finally rest now that she won’t have to wait and wonder where her husband is, and how he’s doing. Whether he’s alive or not. For his part, Steve doesn’t cry at all, doesn’t even come close to it. He feels like the Tony Stark who laid down his life is a total stranger to him suddenly, given tribute in this small wooden house on a lake in the middle of nowhere. His wife and kid and shed full of gardening tools make him look like he had the life of any other ordinary American man.
Amid the pounding of his heart, Tony told himself all the reasonable, logical things. The last couple of days, months, years have been hell on everyone. Steve was coming off losing another friend, and clinging to what remained. He was upset. He'd feel differently later. Tony should thread cautiously now, and not believe spur of the moment confessions. Good reasons, all.
Suddenly he needed a touchstone. He needed to see Steve, to know that he was really with him. The desire to map out his face with his eyes again was a jittering, nervous itch under his skin.
With a long breath that he didn't want to admit was a sigh of regret, Steve clasped Tony's hand in his and used it to pull himself to his feet. Their eyes met for a long moment and held.
"Shhh," he whispered into Steve's hair, kissing his brow. For some reason this made Steve cry harder, curling himself against Tony's chest. It was warm there. "I'm here," Tony repeated, while Steve tried to hold back pathetic sounds. "It's okay. You're okay. Mostly. You seem to have a bit of a memory skip there. But you're safe, honey."
Tony stared at the text. Not even he was dense enough to answer that what he was thinking: when are you picking up this dog?
"—why I had to make the call." He sighed out the last part, sounding almost relieved to get the words out. "There was no time."
, Tony thought, gripping the steering wheel and staring ahead at the road. The silence weighted on him.
Steve's lips compressed in a thin line, and he glanced down on the ground before looking up again. "Tony..."
you—" A new harsh sob tore out of his throat, his chest aching the way it had that day at the lake; the funeral. He couldn't remember how he'd made it from the house to where he could be alone. He didn't remember a whole lot about the rest of that day, really. It made it easier to believe that maybe—
"Yes! You have no idea how hard it is not to tell you things," Tony blurted out again and looked frustrated. He jerked his hand away from Steve. "Sorry," he mumbled, starting to turn away. "It's unfair."
Tony winced, tsking. "Not my finest hour." His eyes were the furthest from angry now. They were loving. Steve's hands trembled and Tony frowned. "You remember that we'd made up though?" he asked, looking very concerned about it.
"I'm okay," Tony croaked. He wasn't completely sure at the moment, but, yeah, maybe. Someone called for a doctor. FRIDAY had administered some sort of a painkiller, unprompted, responding to the readings she was receiving from the suit, but he didn't feel like he was about to keel over right there and then.
"I had Cap pajamas when I was four. Probably shouldn't have told you that." Tony's gut was fluttering as if he was mid-flight. The sense of companionship he and Steve had found again had him feeling like he was in an elaborate fantastical dream. They couldn't
"Why bother? We'll be out of this century tomorrow," Tony went past the beds to peer at their bathroom. The small room was old and dingy looking, but he'd seen worse places. "Besides, don't you think I look like an academic?" He glanced over the shoulder at Steve with a challenging eyebrow raised.
By that point, Steve was so out of it, he couldn't remember why he was struggling anymore. He knew he'd have to swim, he'd have to try to get to his feet and find land, but try telling that to his body. His limbs refused to cooperate. So, for a moment, he just let himself sink; but only for a moment. Air bubbled out of his lips, and he felt the burn of water enter his lungs.
"Yeah?" Tony croaked. He felt like all the strength had gone out of his body, and all he could do was remain upright where he crouched with one knee on the ground. And if he collapsed, he thought it would be fitting if he collapsed at Steve's feet.
"I do," Steve answered harshly. His lips were pressed in a dissatisfied line, frustration with the way this conversation was going evident in the jerky movements of his hands as he unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt and pulled it aside to let Tony examine at the scar tissue there. "I wanted to help."
Steve looked on, and his eyes were inscrutable. Tony waited, because he felt like Steve was picking over the argument and this was important. Tony wanted him to stop clinging to the past and try to be happy. He could practically see the wheels spinning behind those blue eyes as Steve considered his words. But when he spoke, Steve only said simply:
Meanwhile the two dogs were happily sniffing each other's butts over on the park-lawn grass next to their feet. Fifi and the black puppy had somehow managed to circle the two of them with their leashes. But did they look remotely remorseful about it? No, they did not.
The AI's voice sounded from somewhere above. "Colonel Rhodes is correct. Boss is in the workshop and he's called for a Blackout."
When they finally found the right lab at the end of the corridor, and Steve made use of his command voice to order the lone intern out of the room.
Tony recounted the encounter downstairs, and Steve easily validated his unease with a frown of his own. They couldn't risk Steve being recognized. If it got back to SHIELD and the general state of alert rose on the base, that would interfere with their plan. So when Steve suggested they abandon the hotel and make their way to New Jersey then and there, instead of waiting 'till morning, Tony couldn't argue with the idea.
Steve didn't answer, but Tony was already slowing and descending into an empty hay field at the side of a road. Instead of a dramatic landing, he lowered the armor closer to the ground, expecting Steve to step off. When Tony unwrapped his arms from around Steve's torso, the other man swayed and nearly went down.
But Tony didn't get to hear what Steve would do, even though he had no doubt Steve would choose the mission over his own feelings.
“Run a check against all the intel we have on Barnes. Something doesn’t sit right. And Jarvis, be discreet.”
“Tony. Hold on." Paramedics and armed guards enter the command center. Natasha is still shaking as two medics help her stand and another two work to stabilize Tony “He needs an ultrasound, there's a baby”. Her own medics guide her to a chair nearby, but she doesn't take her eyes off Tony. His eyes are closed, and his breath is ragged.  She’s hoping for him to sit up and wave them off like he always does. They get him on a stretcher quickly and she waves off her own medics to follow.
“You're assuming the worst, Sam. People died but you still figure what we do should be above some type of review. 117 countries want to sign this thing and your attitude is I'm cool!”
It’s hard but slow, and immediately erases all thoughts from his mind. Steve pulls him close and they stay in each other's embrace, Tony with his head resting on Steve's shoulder. Steve takes several breaths in and out. "I've wanted to do that since we got back, everything just got away from me." Steve pulls him in tighter.
Natasha rushes back inside as people run from the building in a panic. Sharon meets her at the door, and they race towards the lounge area where Barnes is currently kicking the ass of every person foolish enough to challenge him to a fight.
In minutes they know that a man named Zemo orchestrated all of this. Of course, this isn’t public yet, Jarvis is making the same deductive leaps that Tony would make. Rhodey sits back, engrossed in all the data that Jarvis is gathering when Tony's phone rings. Part of him hopes its Tony, the more cynical part knows it couldn’t be that easy.  He sits the phone in the middle of the table on speaker.
The information Barnes gave him was another piece of the puzzle. It was vital and would unlock the most vital part. The empire would fall.
"We don't know that it's about me either. Obviously, there are easier ways than blowing up a room full of people and hoping I'm one of the casualties." His phone buzzes again. He fully intends to tell Ross to fuck off but it's not Ross calling, it's not a call at all.
“Killing others in the process! That can’t be overlooked, accident or not. Those people are still dead, and someone must answer for that, Captain!”
Tony can hear the bones in Howard's face shattering. Barnes lets the body fall, stares at it before hoisting it up and placing Howard back in the driver's seat. He moves to the back of the car. Stopping at the trunk he's there for a moment, simply searching for something.
Tony takes the seat across the table. “If you sign everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours is legit. I can get Bucky into one of the best American psychiatric centers instead of him going to a Wakandan prison. This is the best solution for everyone.” Tony takes a deep breath, “I want you to know I heard what you said, I know you don’t want to compromise the Avengers or yourself. We need you, Steve.”
"Welcome to where Hydra made their monsters." Zemo stands up from the command center and holds out his arms.
Bucky shakes his head "Before the program was scrapped Hydra made five more. They, from what I remember, were less stable and harder to control. There was a man that ran the program, he was the one that always spoke the words." Bucky winces, closing his eyes for a long moment and taking a deep breath. Against better judgement Steve steps to the containment and unlocks it. Before stepping inside he opens up a bottle of water. He puts it to Bucky's lips who drinks quickly.
Rhodey suddenly jumps to his feet and head back towards what’s left of the conference room. "Did anyone find Tony's phone."
"I just gave him enough sedative to put out four horses. I'd say we have 20 minutes to get him into another containment unit"
“You actually read all 2000 pages of this.” Steve sounds flabbergasted, not that he should be, Tony did become an expert in thermo-nuclear astrophysics overnight
When Tony wakes this time its to grogginess and a splitting headache. He maneuvers himself into a sitting position slowly, the creak in the cot beneath him is almost deafening and only adds to the pain in his head. His legs almost fold the moment he tries to stand. The ground is freezing beneath his bare feet. His shirt sticks to him in places but his wounds have been cleaned, sutured and dressed. Fresh clothing has been laid out for him, all black complete with boots. Its just as well, the suit is done for. When he feels a little steadier, he undresses and redresses quickly because its freezing in here.
"I have to tell you something." His phone buzzes again but he won’t let anything interrupt this moment. He sits his phone on the desk and goes for the picture in his pocket. Steve stares at it for a moment then his eyes go wide, and he gets it.
Zemo quirks a small smile. "You think I'm a monster. If I were truly a monster..." he trails the knife along Tony's throat "...I would have them strap you to a table..."
Secretary Ross is a formidable man, he’s also a grade A asshole and he's barely given them time to process the situation before he lists all the ways they've fucked up. A few times Steve turns back to look at him but Tony already knows they're going to be divided on this.
"Yes, right now. But what if they say whatever words trigger him. Plus, Tony's injured without armor, so how are we supposed to protect him and fight them off? We need a better plan than just going in guns blazing."
As Sharon had estimated the drugs couldn't keep Bucky down for long. His dark eyes track Steve as he steps closer and closer to the containment unit. Zemo said that Bucky might help him track down Tony, if that was the case it was time to see just how much Bucky knew.
He follows Steve into their room in silence. It still feels weird to think of it as “theirs”. Steve disappeared into the bathroom quickly and still without a word. Tony can hear the shower running, the steam rising from beneath the door.
He’s is still watching when Rhodey arrives twenty minutes later. They sit in silence, watching the coverage that switches between updates and footage of the fight that took the team from the parking lot of a bio-facility, to the packed street of a local market to the building that now lay in ruin. He takes a sharp breath when Rumlow press the button with Steve standing mere inches from him. Wanda did what she has to do Tony will always be grateful for it but this choice will cost her.
"No. Steve it's okay." Tony cups his face. "Yes, I wanted to tell you, but you got the call about Peggy and I knew you needed time to grieve for her. Then this mess with the Accords and Barnes happened."
Steve, Natasha, Sam and Sharon stare back at him "He’s been hiding since Shield fell but he pops up to bomb the Accords signing. Why?"
He looks from the picture, to Tony's face then back at the picture and finally at Tony again. "You? You and me?"
Only a couple of miles away, his younger self is in his workshop unaware if how his parents are dying and how everything is going to change.
All eyes outside the room are one them now with Ross and Steve standing practically chest to chest. Natasha and Sharon eye the spectacle, looking a cross between proud, amused and concerned. Tony grabs Steve arm, ignoring how foolish they must look with him pulling against the bulk of Steve’s weight. Thankfully Steve spares him the embarrassment and allows himself to be led from the room. Since he cares about prying eyes and ears Tony leads them to an office at the far end of the hall. Steve takes a few calming deep breaths, pacing back and forth. "I had to protect him, Tony."
Steve grabs the fake doctor by the jacket and slams him against the nearest wall. “Who are you? What do you want?”
Tony comes to in waves, mostly to pain and nausea at first. He groans, pain radiating up his side as he tries to turn over and finds resistance. He pulls at the straps around his wrists. "No need to struggle, Mr. Stark." A hand comes from the darkness to caress his forehead "We're going to take good care of you and your growing family."
Natasha takes the empty spot beside Tony on the long couch. “Tony, you're being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal" She says.
Ross nods. “Yes. If you sign we can have you reinstated, everything in the last 24 hours becomes part of a legitimate joint task, including the destruction of a portion of that tunnel. The only thing still in question is Maximoff’s tenure as an Avenger, that is yet to be determined.”
"For the moment." Steve says, his eyes never leaving the monitor. "You meant what you said, that you'll help him."
As promised, they come out of the tunnel across the street from the parking lot. Helicopters still fly overhead so they move quickly before they are spotted by anyone that might recognize them.
"I knew this would happen. Everything Hydra put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words."
They both run towards him; Barnes is still as quick as she remembers but she’s always been faster. Normally she’d let her opponent tire themselves out but that won’t work with Barnes. She and T’challa duck and dodge, trying to give Sharon and angle to get in the syringe. T’challa catches one arm in a lock and that’s their opening.
“The ambulance carrying Stark never made it to the hospital. Witnesses say that the ambulance was forced to pull over, a black van pulled up moments later and they moved Stark before blowing up the ambulance. The black van was seen heading east, only thing that way is the airport.
That same hand moved down settling on the small bump. "Family is such an important thing in this life. To lose it is to lose a part of yourself that can never be regained. To lose a child, even one you haven’t met, it will hollow you out." The voice coos. He still can’t see a face, but the accent is distinct, it reminds him of Wanda. So Sokovian most likely which would explain why he’s here.
"Listen Steve. I know how much Barnes means to you and I’ll do everything I can to help him but you have need to sit this one out. If you get involved it will just make things worse for all of us and for him." He’s trying to keep emotion out of it. Steve is about to do something stupid. Tony wants to tell him it doesn’t have to be him, that the task force can handle Barnes but he already hears that resolve in Steve's voice.
She always loves his bots, they're his friends, they can be her friends too. He sits a box of tissues in the bots arms and sends it rolling into the room. Her sniffles stop and he hears a soft chuckle. From his hiding spot he sees her take the offered tissue and wipe her face.
He lets him go. Anything he should say is trapped in this throat. He can’t drop this on him now, not when Steve looks like all the light has gone from the world. Sometimes Tony feels like he’s competing with the ghost of Steve's former life. Instead of letting himself go down that sad and frustrating pathTony heads back to the others. They’ve broken into smaller clusters which leaves Rhodey open to grab him by the arm and pull him aside. "Are you okay?"
"Just take what you came for and go." Tony whispers. He knows his mother is about to die, that he's about to witness the moment that altered the course of his life and still he silently wishes for a different outcome. Barnes sets his package down. "Please don't." He whispers as if they can hear him, as if it will change anything.
"There has to be something we're not seeing. All of the pieces are here, we're just not looking at them right."
Vienna doesn't happen as planned. There's an explosion and people are dead. He, Rhodey and Natasha manage to get out only bruised. Agents and heavily armed people run back and forth as paramedics tend to the wounded. Pictures of the bomber, one James Barnes have already begun to circulate. Every time Tony seems to gain a spare moment someone or something clamors for his attention, he needs to call Steve.
Natasha holds Tony's hand as they move the stretcher to a waiting ambulance. She’s about to climb in with him when Sharon's voice comes over her com.
"Could be but that doesn’t play. When he killed people it was covert, never something that looked like an assassination. If Steve was the target there were times before he could have come at you, more private, isolated moments than this.” His phone buzzes again but he’s on a roll. "But he attacks a public place, it’s too flashy. And for what purpose? If it’s Hydra then the accords give them the advantage.
Her words sting, just a bit. It's not that he doesn't want to go but the foreign press tends to be a circus whenever he makes an appearance and this is about Steve saying farewell to Peggy, he doesn't want to distract from that.
"If Steve was the target how could he know for sure Steve would be there. It doesn't add up." Sharon adds
Wanda looks apologetically at him. Over the last two years they’ve become comfortable enough with one another but there’s still an uneasiness between them.
Locks click and he finally gets a look at his captors. He's been abducted and held captive enough times to know neither is the man in charge. They cuff his hands, in front not behind thankfully, and shove him into the cold corridor.
Tony had been plagued by his own nightmares the last two weeks, not unusual when Steve was away for prolonged periods, but it had begun to mess with him in ways a phone call couldn’t fix. Only to wake up feeling sicker than a dog. He couldn’t say what it was about how they fit together that chased the nightmares away. On more than one occasion Steve had called him, looking as haggard as Tony felt, for something to chase the shakiness away . Some nights just a few stolen moments would do it, others required they talk until the sun rose on either one of the corners of their world.
"What the going rate for watching the Avengers fall and killing Tony Stark on the world stage?" Sam asks aloud "Or selling him to whomever might wants him for the highest bidder"
Rhodey steps right into Steve's personal space "When it's Tony, I don't do sidelines. Understand, Captain?"
Down the knife goes until its pressing against his belly "...and I would cut this blessing you don't deserve right out of you. But I won't. Your suffering won't be quick " Tony feels the panic attack coming. "We have to leave Captain Rogers with the idea that he can save you. As I told you before, you and your baby are safe, for now. I would like you to sit here and watch this.
Bucky eyes him for a moment then lets out a resigned sigh “I’m sorry” Bucky sighed. "What did I do? How many people did I hurt?”
The psychologist goes through the usual checks. He queries about Bucky's time at Hydra, what buried memories have resurfaced and why he set off the bomb. Bucky maintains his innocence.
There's no ill will. Steve knows the story of how Rhodes fought his superiors to keep searching the Afghan desert for Tony.
Sharon and Natasha shoot one another a concerned look. The color drains out of Steve's face. Natasha pulls him to the side. "He's on his way to the hospital. He took a hit, got knocked around a good bit. Took some shrapnel to the abdomen. He told me about the baby. The paramedics had two heartbeats when they left."
Ross comes storming into the compound at nine-sharp, red-faced and ready to ship them all to the Raft. He screams about violations against international law, foreign dignitaries wanting the Avengers arrested, the lack of care for casualties. Tony only listens with half an ear more concerned about sending what aid he can to Lagos. Then Ross drops the big bomb, a stack of paper with Sokovia Accords written on the front. Tony eyes it for a moment and sighs, it was bound to happen. Since Ultron, since Johannesburg, since Sokovia he had heard rumblings of superhero legislation being in the works, Lagos just tipped the boat.
Steve gets involved, he doesn’t stay away, Barnes is in custody, but Secretary Ross and CIA Ross are out for blood. Sharon spares a glance at Tony, rolling her eyes as CIA Ross rants on that Steve, Sam and T’challa should be in cells next to Barnes. Tony stifles a chuckle at King T’challa’s looks unfazed glare. His eyes shift over to Barnes and the containment cell, if looks could kill…
CIA Ross blabbers on as they follow him towards the command center. They are led to glass room where Secretary Ross is waiting. “Rogers. Stark. The rest of you can wait outside.” He looks pretty put together for a man dealing with an international crisis, Steve is less impressed as Secretary Ross rounds the conference table like a disappointed parent. He sits his fancy pen in the middle of the table. Steve to his credit, doesn’t even spare the man a glance.
The video has no sound, but Tony feels like he can hear everything. His father stumbles from the car, bleeding and disoriented but not drunk as Tony had always believed. Staggering until he dropped to his knees a foot or so from the car.
He’s staring at the face of the man that signed in as the psychiatrist next the older and rounder face of the doctor that should be with Barnes. "We have a problem." Tony projects his phone feed onto one of the monitors.
“I was just telling him that once the PR fire is out we can amend some documents, make some contingencies.” Tony steps between the two men when Steve stands up, pen still twirling in his hand.
“Hydra's most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in Hydra history and that was before the serum. When he could get the under control, they were lethal."
Vision offers his opinion which pretty much means he’s going to sign. Natasha admits she agree with him and Tony would tease her about it if he had the energy. He chances a glance at Rhodey who has already made his stance abundantly clear. For lack of anything better and because a wave of nausea just hit he sits back down on the couch. When he tunes back in Steve is speaking directly to Vision.
T’challa paces back and forth across the conference room. “What’s to say Barnes and this other man aren’t working together.”
“I did and the blowback from that wasn’t like this. This is bigger than us and what we decide now will determine a lot of things.”
When Steve left to chase Rumlow, a little over a month ago Tony didn’t question why. Steve felt responsible for all of it. For Hydra resurfacing. For Rumlow. For the fall of Shield. For Bucky. For many things he had no control over. Some nights, on the rarer moments Steve felt like talking he would just let him vent, listening with an open ear and a reassuring word if needed. Steve had sacrificed his life trying to stop Hydra and it had to be a kick in the teeth to know that they flourished in the very same organization that was meant to fight them.
He could tell Steve right now. Ross just left, the accords sit open on Steve's lap and Rhodey keeps giving him the look while simultaneously debating with Sam. Tony opts just to lie back as arguments take place overhead.
, Steve, please. Come inside – there’s plenty of food. And tea, coffee, or anything – it might help you feel better. Thor’s been going heavy on the liquor supply already, so don’t feel shy. Whatever you want, it won’t be an imposition.”
The two letters go in an envelope he leaves on his desk, with the words ‘TO: FALCON’ on the back in large, looping letters.
Sam shrugs. “We only have the time we get given, Steve. All we can do is decide what to do with it.”
“Losing someone just as you reconcile with them - I know what that’s like too.” Steve wishes he didn’t.
“I’ll find a way back, Bucky,” Steve says. “I promise, no matter what happens, I’ll try to find a way back to you. This you, the one in front of me.”
The quantum transporter takes time to rebuild, with Tony’s data and facilities destroyed. Bruce does his best, but just like before there’s always some link he’s missing, some instrument a little too fragile for his massive hands, and they can’t afford to make mistakes this time. They spend shifts guarding the Infinity Stones, and a couple of idiots decide to break in to try and steal it. All amateurs, especially compared to Thanos. Steve is there when one of them try, and pinning the culprit down to the floor is laughably easy.
“In Asgard, we celebrate, Captain,” Thor says gruffly. “For our friends have surely ascended to Valhalla, the hall of heroes, for their good deeds. And that is no thing to mourn.”
of two lives, one lived and one unlived. Steve doesn’t know whether he needs to just let the dead lie. What was the right thing to do – to give Peggy the love story she deserved? To make sure he didn’t fight with Tony in other futures? To save Bucky from ever becoming the Winter Soldier, or SHIELD from Hydra agents, or come back to this time and keep fighting for justice here?
“Yes. They’re right,” Wanda says sadly from behind him. “But it’s not too late, you know. For you, years ago.”
When he sleeps, he dreams of Tony as he first met him. Obnoxious, arrogant, infuriating Tony Stark, the Helicarrier a blur around them.
“Thanos killed my people before the snap,” Thor says, his voice heavy with grief. “The Asgardians who fought him didn’t return when Bruce undid that. I lost – my brother, and – Heimdall, and -”
Steve knows that Fury wasn’t there to hear that, and equally knows Fury already knows everything that happened on that day better than Steve does.
They all raise a toast to the fallen, following Thor’s lead. They are silent for a moment, and then Pepper speaks up.
“But I’m getting off track, and back on this damned argument. Again. Why are we like this? All I want sometimes is just you and me, Rogers – Steve –
Steve leaves the body there, and stumbles down the rubble, tripping on his way down. Bucky is there to catch him and hold him upright.
“Perhaps I knew that you could handle it,” Nick says. “And so you did, until I started disintegrating into goddamn drywall pieces in front of my own eyes and I thought, ‘Gee whiz, those caped crusaders finally got their asses handed to them.’”
“We’re here,” Clint adds. “You know, or any of your other friends. We all deal with it in different ways. But we need each other. No man is an island, and all. I wish – I wish someone had been there to say that to me five years ago, to tell me to go to Nat, when I was dealing with the Snap. And now I can’t take back that time.”
Steve though, still feels as though he's been cast adrift. He isn’t even sure how he’s meant to react to what happened. He has lost too much to celebrate, and yet he hasn’t lost enough to justify his monumental grief. He feels empty, purposeless. Sometimes he spends hours just lying down, thinking over everything. Wondering if there was a way out he didn't see, or what he could have done differently to change what happened. If they call on him, he’ll be there. But when he doesn’t have a mission, he lies restless in his new accommodation, wasting hours to thoughts about a past he can’t change.
“Much of what happens isn’t fair, you will find,” Strange says, pensively. “But were Tony not your closest friend, you might consider one life a small sacrifice for billions.”
“Good to see you alive, Nick,” Steve says. “We spent a good few weeks working out what the hell that beacon was. You could have told us. Trusted us, in case it didn’t work.”
Steve didn’t know the answer to that. All he knew was that the present didn’t feel like home to him at all.
“You probably won’t have to wait very long at all,” Steve chuckles. “Time travel’s convenient like that.”
“A different version of it may or may not have happened,” Strange says. “But ultimately, you did make those choices, and we were left with the timeline we are in, and there’s not much we can do to affect that. Changing the past doesn’t affect the future you left behind, it just creates a new one.”
“You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play,” Steve snarls. But Tony just smiles, almost apologetically.
“There’s no shame in not being okay with things,” Sam cuts in. “It’s a normal response to losing people.”
After those incidents, they work on the transporter with renewed conviction, ever paranoid that someone will eventually fight them for it and win. If they wait long enough, Steve is sure the forces of some distant galaxy will come to claim their prize – even if there’s clearly no match for the Avengers on Earth.
“You’re here to ask about time travel,” Strange declares, from his balcony. He seems to have the same fondness for dramatics that Tony had.
“In another time, perhaps,” Thor says sadly, shaking Steve’s hand with the aggressive motion of someone who never learned how to do it properly. “And - there’s one more thing that I may have forgotten to mention.”
"Oh, stop it." Tony sighed. "You should leave, you really should." He bit his lip, before saying, as if compelled, "I can't lie, and any moment I'll tell you— I'll tell you—" Tony seemed to struggle and then just went for it, squeezing his eyes shut, "That you shouldn't marry me." He opened his eyes and looked a bit sick.
Then he dropped the phone on the desk with a clatter. Fifi lifted her head from her paws and whined. She probably needed a walk. Tony dreaded the inevitable. He'd spent the last fifteen minutes alternatively doing deep breathing exercises to ward off the panicky thoughts and looking up other reputable dog sitters who could take over in case Natasha's hospital stay got extended.
"But it did!" Tony stressed. He still didn't understand. The memory of the realization Steve was shot chilled his insides. "You saw them pull out their guns and you just stood there?"
"You know we barely have five bucks to our name?" Tony's mind jumped to the other topic that worried him. They had left the hotel room behind, and there wouldn't be any beds to sleep in tonight, comfy or otherwise. Tony was used to falling asleep working in his garage, but it didn't do his back any favours. "Even with the current prices, that's
