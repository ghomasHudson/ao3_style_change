He brought the baton down again, pressing it beneath Tony's chin. "But you do really know your way around this stuff. Even this little thing," he shocked Tony again and Tony ground his teeth together as he convulsed, "it looks so innocent, yet with correct settings it can kill a man with one little push of a button."
"Actually, yeah," Tony said, gasping when Ezekiel's fingers pressed down on a laceration, "but you know, I'm stuck in a basement with some weirdo so—"
"Becker!" Marco called, hand grasping Beard's shoulder tightly. Beard didn't react to him, and Tony felt his limbs going numb from panic.
Now that he was up and about once more, Bates had strung him up again, the chain of his cuffs caught in the hook near the top end of the pole. His arms were stretched high above his head and it felt horrible on his back; a couple of the welts had opened up and began weeping blood into his new shirt, and the burn from the stretch on the muscles on his back and shoulders made him gasp for breath.
When he was done, he grabbed Tony's neck and the smaller man tensed at the touch. Becker didn't squeeze however; the grip was just to warn him and keep him in place. Tony glared daggers at him, unable as he was to otherwise fight the hold.
JARVIS replies somewhat indignantly, as if he's offended that Tony even bothered to ask, but Tony's mind is already occupied by other stuff as he closes the door to his bedroom, so he doesn't pay the AI any attention.
How have you liked the story so far? It's been a ride. Also, I know it says 5/6 chapters at the moment, but the last chapter is going to be long, so I might split it into two separate chapters. I guess we'll see in 1-2 weeks.
"We didn't?" Ezekiel asked mockingly, allowing Tony to tilt his head so he could meet his eyes. Tony bit his lip.
"Hi, Mom." He returns her hug, more than shell-shocked, although he's used to getting hugged or kissed on a cheek as a greeting, being an upper class omega and all that.
He came to a while later, shadows passing over his face as someone moved around him. His eyes followed the silhouette lazily as it busied itself with something next to him. Then it leaned over his chest and touched it.
Rick just huffed out a laugh. "We shall see about that," he replied easily, surging forward to catch Tony's mouth with his. His kiss was bruising and hungry. Unforgiving, like the hands that were starting to snake around him, pulling him close and leaving dark bruises in their wake.
They end up talking about the team, Rose and their day at Central Park yesterday, enjoying the wine as they do. Sometime around 6:30 PM, just when Tony'd begun wondering what Rose was up to, the child makes her way to the living room, first showing Tony a picture she made, then walking up to Rogers and showing it to him, too, albeit a little more shyly. Tony had been wondering whether she was manifesting some sort of hero worship towards the captain. Well, he couldn't blame Rose. Tony'd been probably just as bad, or even worse, with his Captain America admiration when he'd been a kid.
He looked down at Tony, looking disgusted by what he saw. "Truly, the Merchant of Death." And just like that, Tony felt equally disgusted by himself, no matter how he tried to tell himself that this was exactly what Ezekiel wanted. Everything was just too...much, at the moment.
"Rick!" Tony exclaims angrily and gasps when a bruising kiss is pressed against his neck. Rick takes a hold of his flailing arms, pressing them against the table as he shoves Tony down on it, and changes the kiss so that he's sucking a hickey to the long column of Tony's throat.
"You should've put your parka on," Natasha tells him, warm in her own heavily padded tactical winter gear.
get the impression that you like to skip meals." It's Tony's turn to roll his eyes. Yesterday at dinner with the team Rose had let loose that her Daddy 'didn't eat dinner' when Bruce had come to the living room to inform that the vegetable masala was ready. Which, he of course
He was interrupted by a sudden loud bang, reverberating from somewhere in the room. He instantly lifted his shield as Rhodes spoke,
"She's all yours," he said, sounding irritated, and made room for Natasha to exit the room. She disappeared swiftly from the viewing room and Rhodey took the place she had vacated by Steve's side.
"That's good enough for me," he replied. He paused before meeting Steve's eyes again. "Wanna come with?"
On the helicarrier he meets this team of misfits. Nick Fury's super secret boyband. The Avengers. Which, he can never be a part of, at least as anything more than the consultant he already is, thanks to Alpha Romanov's evaluation on him and the ever-present fact that he's an omega. Everyone else on the team is either a beta or an alpha. Figures.
As Natasha and Bucky cleared out, he turned so he could see Bruce and Sam both. "I want you two to go through possible suspects. Anyone that has had a bone to pick with Tony in the last few months. See if he's received any threats. Or, a....ransom."
Huh, Tony hadn't noticed. He walks up to lean against Clint's cot, watching the archer's mouth hanging open as he takes in the two women in the room, when Pepper shoots him a look, daring him to comment. He just nods and smiles, and that seems to be enough.
"Get your hands off me," he nevertheless snapped once Marco had steadied him on his feet, shrugging off his hold on his arm. "I can walk by myself."
"Please, untie our guest. I believe he hasn't eaten properly in several hours," Hammer told Bates, smiling at Tony. Tony was man enough to admit that he hadn't expected that; Hammer had been working on his poker face.
The three of them are all gathered around the long table, Rick in the same white shirt he wore for work, sans the jacket, Tony clad in a white, generously loose and soft dress shirt and dark trousers, borderline casual but still formal enough to pass by Rick's standards, and Rosie glammed up in a cerulean blue dress, hair pulled partway up and adorned with Pepper's silver flower headband in a way that Rosie firmly tells Tony is 'princess-like'. She'd made him do her hair for her, of course, and Tony's beginning to question whether passing on his diva genes was a good idea after all.
He walks up to tower over Steve, and Tony notices Steve subtly righting himself where he was previously leaned casually against the plastic headboard. His expression isn't cold per se, but it isn't that welcoming either. Rick, on the other hand, has full-on plastered on his dazzling Public Relations Smile.
He was at campus when the first wave of his heat hit him, thankfully with Rhodey, who might as well be his knight in shining armor. He'd all but carried Tony, half-delirious by the time, from the lecture hall, away from interested gazes, and stayed with him in his dorm room all three days of his heat, only leaving to get them food.
"Yes, thank you," she says and takes the puzzle after Steve unpacks it and hands it to her. The alpha himself grabs the puzzle Rosie had just rejected and starts inspecting it carefully from side to side. He solves it under one minute. Tony smiles fondly at them. Even though for Rosie the puzzles are advanced, they are still designed for kids, so they're no match for normally developed adults. Much less for super soldiers.
The doctor stepped closer, smiling gently and watching Tony's movements begin to grow weaker as the sedative kicked in.
Tony starts, using the same tone as Rick did when he repeats the blonde alpha's name, "is a wonderful, kind man. A very capable captain, and an alpha." He turns to lean against the table, looking into Rick's eyes. The alpha isn't angry, not yet, but he's obviously ired by the fact that Tony and Rose are close to Steve. Tony shrugs. "He's a big help when you're not around." And that does it. Rick's eyes flash.
Rick graduates the same year as him, and their wedding is held in the following summer. It's hot and it's unpleasant and it's everything that Tony hates. He hates the upper class mannerism that he has to keep up with the wedding guests, the fake smiles, the hollow laughter and the artificial pleasantries. He hates seeing the traditional alpha-omega couples where the omega stands quietly and submissively next to their alpha while they talk their head off. He hates his golden accessories and his traditional white dress suit, its collar cut so that it shows off the column of his neck, unmarred by any mating bite, telling everyone that he's pure and desirable.
according to Rosie) start towards the direction of the zoo, she immediately brightens up and scrambles from the bench to get a head start.
"All good questions," Tony agrees, "Let me provide the answers for you, cap. One, if the intel is wrong, which it shouldn't be, we adjust. Two, you've got our three big guns with you now, we'll be fine if they try to capture us. Three, if one of us gets left behind, the rest will come back and get them. Capisce?"
His mouth betrayed him before his conviction could, "No!" it burst out with, the short word quickly followed by a half-stifled sob. "No, he doesn't."
Dabble is a huge understatement and clearly meant as a slight. Tony decides to ignore it. "Sounds like something Mengele would say, but I guess that's not an insult to you guys, is it?"
"I know that," he tells Steve, "But I'm still going to investigate it." He moves against the alpha's hold. "Now, if you're done chiding me and not about to ravage me in that broom closet behind my back, I'm going to have to kindly ask you to let go of me."
"Really, now?" Hammer asked, pushing the doors to the house open and beckoning for the three of them to follow. "I'm sorry to hear that, Tony. I believe you'll find my lodgings much more...accommodating."
His voice was neutral, neither mocking nor concerned, but it made Tony bristle all the same. "No," he bit out against his better judgement, and leaned heavily on the hand railing as he took the first step up the stairs.
Hammer huffed. "Yes, you would know about that." A brief silence ensued, and Tony could guess which person, and by extension his son, they were both picturing. He held back a shudder at the reminder. "That's why I needed you, actually."
What made it an eternity more uncomfortable, was when Rick said, "Come on, dear," giving him a dirty look over his shoulder as he walked towards their bedroom. Tony felt like throwing up for the second time that evening, but he followed his husband anyway.
He rubbed at his eyes, scratched his beard — the exhaustion from staying up all night was beginning to take its toll on all of them. Rhodey's movements were even sharper and angrier than they had been at the start of the night and Spider-Man, seated behind Steve's back, kept twitching like he was jerking in and out of sleep.
Tony sighs. "Care to help me make sleeping beauty here some breakfast?" he asks Steve, and relaxes a tad when he sees the alpha nodding stiffly.
Tony just smiled back at him, watching his expressions attentively. Eventually, Hammer raised his eyes and met Tony's gaze again. "Bates," he said, and Tony imagined Pepper there, screaming at him that he was out of his mind, going out of his way to bait Hammer.
Pepper screamed, and someone near him fired a gun, nearly stopping Tony's heart. It stuttered back into rhythm when he heard it ricocheting from something metallic and Pepper let out a startled, not
"No!" was all he managed to gasp desperately, when he heard Ezekiel descending the stairs to the basement as well. By then Bates had managed to twist the chain around a few spindles so that Tony was stuck to the chair.
All that collateral damage." He hit him again. "So, you can claim that you saved humanity from Thanos, but that's not what happened, is it. You saved what was
"Oh, is that so?" Hammer asked, setting down his cutlery and contemplating Tony. In the end, he just shrugged. "Well, it wouldn't be the famous Tony Stark that I have in my possession had he not attempted to escape at least once. How far did you get?"
"Hey," Thor protests the backhanded compliment, which goes ignored by Steve. Bruce pats him consolingly. He shares a knowing look with Tony, who sighs, knowing what Bruce is getting at. Steve's a little jittery, probably because this is the first mission since their botched undercover one. Yikes. Tony thinks it's probably no wonder the man is a tad irritable.
Bates walked him over to the same chair he had sat at earlier that day, letting Tony take a seat by himself. He let go of the chain once he had. Hammer sat down opposite to him.
mad about it). As Tony watches, the alpha's expression starts to grow more and more angry by the minute.
"First, you gotta finish your plate, honey," Tony tells her, pointing at the meal that is hardly half-eaten. "You know the rules."
Marco turned his back on him, and Tony pushed the pin back into the lock. He found the right position and twisted, listening to the click as the double lock disengaged. He twisted again, this time in the opposite direction, pushing up and down, and the cuff fell open. He repeated the procedure with the second cuff, eyes glued to Marco's back as he payed the food delivery guy.
The next day, he's curled up against the backrest of the couch in his and Rick's apartment, doing work on his tablet. Rose is on the floor before the couch, playing with her colorful spacecraft toy set. She keeps occasionally sending a spaceship or an astronaut flying across the room, just to run off to retrieve the toy and then send it back after ten minutes. Maybe she's sending them to space in her play by doing so. Tony isn't sure, but at least the toddler seems to be enjoying herself so far.
"I want to, too," Tony forces out, and it's somehow such a surprise to say out loud and such a powerful statement, to actually
The piece of paper crinkles in Rosie's small hands, she's gripping it so hard as they wait for the elevator to stop ascending. Tony has to brush his hand over the toddler's head in a calming manner to gain her attention, as she's practically quaking with excitement.
They sit there for an hour maybe, listening and joining in on Rosie's stories, until there's a knock at the door.
Once seated, Hammer lifted his hand and motioned with it, flapping it at Marco and Becker. "You can leave now. We're good here." They looked towards the wall, and Tony watched as Bates nodded at the two and they cleared out of the room.
"Congratulations, Tony. A good match, indeed." He flinches hard at the voice just an inch from his neck, nearly dropping his flute of champagne as he whirls around.
And yeah, Tony was willing to admit, it was a stupid thing to argue about. They were now in line, and Tony was about to apologize in turn for getting all hot under the collar to the alpha standing a little behind him, but he was halted by a woman standing before them in the line.
Hammer met his eyes again, looking at him over the rim of his wine glass. "Yes, it is." He set the glass down and grabbed a piece of bread from the basket between them, tearing a piece from it languidly. "I will rebuild my company, and you're going to help me."
she whines, tears already welling up in her eyes and oh boy, Tony isn't ready for another tantrum after this morning.
"Oh, Master Anthony," Jarvis interrupted him, sudden tears in his eyes. He'd reached to cup Tony's head with both hands. They were shaking, Tony had realised. "Remember, that whatever happens from this point onwards, you have nothing to be ashamed of and you have done absolutely nothing wrong. Alright?"
The first two attackers had been a piece of cake. They had ambushed him as soon as he'd stepped through the door, going for his arms to pin him down. Their joint attack was easy to evade, as were the amateur boxing jabs they threw his way after he'd dodged their hands. A few easy blocks, and soon one of them was wide open for him to land a solid punch to his jaw.
She chuckled at him, as if he'd said something particularly amusing. "Yes, of course, Mr. Stark," she replied. He just stared at her, having trouble figuring out whether she thought Tony was batty and was playing along, or she was the batty one and was just going through her day as she usually did.
Tony met Hammer's eyes, and he was taken aback when he saw surprise etched on the man's face. As Tony watched, it was quickly hidden behind a smile. When the two of them approached the table, Hammer gestured with his hands grandly.
"How come you guys didn't show up on my scans?" Rhodey asked, sounding about as irritated as Nebula had and as Steve currently felt. The other man looked like he had had quite enough of surprises for one day. Steve couldn't agree more.
"I know that it isn't well-spread information, but my Mother, who raised me practically all by herself, was an omega. So, no, I do not appreciate literature that degrades omegas like her. Or, any other omega. Such as Tony, for example." Steve looks quickly at Tony, and Tony, for some unknown reason, feels relieved. Relieved to be sure that Steve isn't like so many other alphas.
They are standing in front of a mirror. Tony is leaning on the counter, staring into the mirror at the arc reactor that had been bared. There are sickly looking veins flared from the rim of the reactor, from where it’s implanted into Tony’s chest. Bloody scratches mar his chest, disappearing into his shirt, peeking out at the wrists. Steve takes in the details, horrified, and looks up to Tony’s face.
It was in the way Tony knew to pull at Steve’s hair just right to make him gasp. It was in the way Steve knew to press just under Tony’s jaw to make him moan; the way Tony let Steve support his entire weight, knowing Steve would never let him fall; the way Steve lean on Tony in return, knowing there would always be hands there to catch him.
falling from his lips and he impaled himself faster on Steve’s cock, the hand in Steve’s hair tightening painfully, deliciously. Steve let Tony set the pace, rolling his hips once for every back-thrust of Tony’s. He knew no one was going to walk in on them. He had made sure of it. Tony was just a little bit of a closet exhibitionist and Steve had no worries showering Tony with affection in public. This, however, this was private. This was between them. This Tony, moaning an endless stream of his and God’s name, was for him and him alone.
Tony blinked away the blurriness in his eyes and tried to maintain his glare at Steve. Steve had a look of shock on his face, mouth open but silent. Steve looked back behind himself, as if trying to see what he’d been dragged from.
He took one last shot at the blob and flew around to where Thor was depositing giant barrels of Anti-Slime Slime around the blob with gusto. Thor hadn’t been too pleased when his lightning seem to invigorate the blob. Tony let JARVIS set the HUD to show the path for the trench again and he primed his lasers for concrete cutting.
Steve clenched his teeth harder and reached towards the drone. It flitted about then positioned itself under Steve’s fingers for the sensors to read him. It beeped once, a green light flashed, and it sprung open.
Tony settled on his blankets and pillow in the cell. His punishment of one night in the cell wasn’t terribly bad. Steve kept him warm, comfortable, and fed at the very least.
Straightening his glasses back on his nose, Bruce clears his throat and opens his mouth to move the situation on.
Sam meets Jim in the corridor on the way back from individual Aerial Combat Training. Jim sends him a questioning look and Sam shakes his head. Jim sighs and shakes his head in return when Sam quirks his own eyebrows in question.
They walk on by each other, Jim heading towards the hangar, and Sam heading towards the kitchen to nurse his bruises with food.
Jim sets his glass down and nudges the other at Tony. Tony takes the glass but keeps his still narrowed eyes on Jim as he takes a long swallow. Jim does roll his eyes this time.
Tony turned the channel off and blocked it for good measure. He knew what he was doing when he’d remade PLASM’s gear pro bono, the least Fury could do was to give him a Containment Unit in return. He thought for a second, then set a course towards the Helicarrier currently hovering over the Atlantic, magnetically sticking the Trap to his back. He brought up his personal files and flicked through all the data he had on the Containment Units. He was going to find out how they worked. And then make his own. He’d been trying on and off for years but he was just missing some magical ingredient he didn’t really want to think about. Certainty One did not include outright believing in
Tony grunted in thanks and sat himself down at the nearest workbench and tried very, very hard not to touch any part of himself. He could do this. He could focus on tasks at hand despite intoxication and altered states of mind, as he full well knew from experience.
Steve was nursing a cut on his brow and a sprained knee. This was going to take longer to recover from. Usually this sort of thing healed in hours. Now, it would be days, weeks. He checked the clot on the cut, then took a pill of aspirin. His knee was going to be a priority and it still hurt.
Tony was drawing aside one of the girls who had danced with him. They were slowly making their way towards the stairs, both of them giggling too hysterically for Steve’s liking. And Steve—Steve should get Tony back home now.
Steve chuckled at Tony's balled up but delighted expression. "Incoming trains, incoming riders, incoming sun, take your pick." He leaned in, a hand slowly massaging at Tony's groin, freeing Tony's cock from the flaps of cloth. "But I betcha I can finish you off within a solid minute."
Steve snorts, now tying the laces on his shoes, then straightens up to give Sam a dry look. “Nice try. But I’m fine.”
The Skull is holding the Cube and its blue glow saturates the stark interior around them. “You will never understand Power, Captain,” the Skull drawls. “You are the man with a plan but you cannot see beyond your small mind. You lack the will to execute and I will see it be the end of you.”
"I think so. It doesn’t feel like I’m trying to rip my skin off anymore.” Steve nuzzled into Tony’s neck. “The past couple of months without having, uh, sex with you might’ve been harder."
Steve smiled. Correct. “So, agent,” he said cheerfully, “you know what I’m after. You’d do well to give it to me.”
. Here and now. Despite himself, he had grown attached to this time. Even if this was a fevered dream as he froze to death in the Valkyrie, he wanted to live it while he could. He wanted to watch creations come alive at Tony’s fingertips. He wanted to see Thor reunited with his estranged brother. He wanted to see Clint fulfil his dream of shooting an apple from Nick Fury’s head. He wanted to help Bruce with managing the Hulk. He wanted to keep seeing Natasha being comfortable enough around them all to tend to Pepper’s pot plant, Joseph.
And this was beyond what T'Challa was willing to lend ears to. He gave the metal shoulder of the Iron Man suit a single pat and then stooped to pick up his own helmet. The sky was already beginning to darken and he intended to leave before the night sets. His job here, as they said, was complete.
"I hurt him," the Captain said quietly as he passed. "Check if he's okay. Please." He didn't have to say it for T'Challa to know he meant more than just physically.
Steve shakes his head again, confusion growing. He tries to tell Tony to go to the controls, to turn the plane around, and Tony’s expression twists into something livid and dark. Something he’d never seen on Tony’s face before.
“I’m gonna call it quits fer tonight, Buck,” Steve said, slapping his mug into Bucky’s free hand. He pressed through the crowd before Bucky could say another word and made a line towards Tony and the girl, Susan?, both already halfway up the stairs.
Steve looked up from Stark’s wide grin to see where his eyes were directed towards behind his probably very expensive sunglasses. There was another person standing a few feet in front of them: a well-dressed blond man and, a little ways behind him, two burly men dressed in black – obviously bodyguards.
“What were you going to do without me? Keep having your agents run around with those horrible particle accelerators on their back?”
Steve growled and turned to walk the hallway to his bedroom. He didn’t need this tonight. Not again.
Two hours later, after feeding samples from his armor and biological samples from himself through several machines, after multiple EEG scans and physical and cognitive tests, after a priapism scare that didn't amount to anything because his dick looked and felt absolutely normal beyond the part where it was constantly hard and begging for contact, Tony was stumped for a quick answer. Everything was normal. Everything was normal except for the increasingly vivid images in his mind of the broad expanse of Steve’s naked back, the flex of Steve's abs, the need to taste Steve’s di—
Tony sighed. Fixing up the town, providing all the hardware, and giving back missing limbs to the townsfolk were things he took joy in. But then there was what had happened to Bucky. And maybe if he had tried harder, Bucky wouldn’t have—He shook his head. He couldn’t let death be his only legacy. He had to try harder.
“What kind of question is that?” Steve asked right back, voice sharp. “You know I wouldn’t. Not unless it was with you.”
“Coordinates, agent,” Steve prompted again. He picked up a knife from the trolley as he passed it. A blunt thing, it was, dulled with neglect and overuse. Just something to direct the real strength that would be behind it.
“Bruce, can you hurry the evac along? I don’t want to have to deal with a ‘Fried Chicken Is A Menace’ on the front page of the Bugle tomorrow.”
Pure. Different. Of an energy they couldn’t detect because it hadn’t decayed like all those others. Uncharacterized, and dismissed by Tony as a consequence.
Heat pulsed at the centre of his chest and he looked down to see Steve’s shield, somewhere far below him. He willed himself to go near it and when he reached out to touch it, a small puff of green light emerged and hovered between him and the shield. “Are you the thing that took Steve?” Tony demanded.
He decided to wait for the opportune moment. He would need a distraction of sorts before even dreaming of escaping without getting caught right away. He was quick and he did possess a pair of deft hands, but he wasn't that quick, and he wasn't that inconspicuous.
All there was was freaking taiga, and all we had time to worry about was not getting our asses frostbitten at night, since let me tell you, this time of the year it gets
He somehow managed to lift his head just enough to turn and see the man talking to him. It was Bates, crouching next to his prone form.
After that, the belt was discarded; it fell to the floor with a loud noise when Becker threw it down. His free hand came down on Tony, landing on his lower back and sliding down. The hand fumbled around before roughly grasping one of his buttocks and squeezing hard. Tony let out a sound of protest, and it was more fearful than he cared to admit. He listened to Becker's heavy breathing above him.
Rosie deflates a little, a pout that's surely inherited from Rick settling on her face as she turns back to her plate. "Okay."
Tony smiled venomously up at him. Marco had stopped at the bottom of the stairs, so he now had to tilt his head up to meet Hammer's eyes. "Yes, well, the entourage I was provided with wasn't the most accommodating, I'm afraid."
Tony sighs because apparently the captain isn't just going to drop the subject. He fishes out his new necklace from beneath the collar of his t-shirt, using his index finger. "This." Steve bends closer to take a hold of the small plate and read the even smaller print on it. Tony chest feels somehow tighter at the sudden proximity.
Tony couldn't do anything but stare. The conversation went a little while after that before Alpha Darrow decided it's time they take their leave. The Starks walked the other three to the front door, and Tony couldn't help the shiver that ran up his spine as he caught the smirk Rick shot in his direction. He answered with a glare.
and he hadn’t walked away. Hell, hadn’t there been the one dream where Steve told his younger self about how great Iron Man was? He needed to have a chat with Steve about subliminal messaging but it had been nice at the time. Of course, it could all have been out of necessity for being anchored to Tony but Tony thought they’d become friends at the very least.
And when Tony was close, when his gasps became higher pitched and his nails scratched sharply into Steve's scalp, Steve finally undid Tony's pants to watch his reddened cock stand erect around the folds of charcoal wool, leaking precome almost nonstop. It was a beautiful sight and Steve only wished he could preserve it forever. With a firm grip, he started pulling the black silken tie off of Tony's cock, letting it slide along the entire length, eased by its smoothness and Tony's precome. It caught on the head of Tony's cock and Steve tugged it off, hard, earning himself a scream of pleasured pain from Tony. He smoothed his hands down Tony's clothed thighs in comforting strokes and licked at Tony's slit until Tony came and came, splattering swirls of white on the dark fabric of the suit and sliding down Steve's chin. He made sure to keep his own suit spotless even as he loved to see Tony's stained with all the marks of their pleasure.
Tony opened and closed his mouth, staring at Steve with wide eyes. “Are you saying you were brought back as a ghost just to ‘
Tony rolled out of the way of a giant glob of slime thrown at him and blasted forward to circle the head of the Colonel. Ectoplasm. Slime. He hated slime. Decontamination and neutralization was a horrible experience; Anti-Slime Slime smelled terrible.
“You’re unreasonably graceful, Vision," Wanda says in the distance. "I’m flying like a caterpillar with small wings.”
The shield. Of course. They'd never found Steve. His father had never found Steve. Steve could have gone down anywhere over the North Atlantic. The Arctic was a vast, everchanging landscape so the search for Captain America should not have been expected to be immediately fruitful, even if Howard never accepted the failures. And now, Nick Fury had just gone and found it, just like that. At Steve's prompt.
They walk on. “So,” Bruce says, “hypothetically speaking, again, if we were to organize a charity event, and we were to have people bid for a date with any Avenger on stage, would you be keen?”
Jim sighs. “And not one of us wants you to go through your troubles alone. You’ve got all of us now. And you could have Steve.” Jim pauses, eyeing up Tony’s reaction. He’s just digging his heels in, Jim decides and continues. “And you know, you could be kissing Steve—“
Steve’s hands left his hips to roam his body, so Tony was being held up only by Steve’s weight pressing him hard against the wall. The very thought made Tony’s brain almost scatter into oblivion. He gathered the last of his wits and took complete control of the kiss, fingers scratching desperately as he stroked down Steve’s neck to drag them closer together.
Steve stayed by the bedside until the moon was sinking and the stars disappeared. And the next day, when Tony came to find him, it seemed the matter was entirely forgotten. Tony laughed and Steve laughed with him. Steve thought that that would be enough for now.
Bucky almost chokes mid-drink but recovers quickly. “Yep,” he says, wiping at his mouth with his flesh hand. “I’ve even got a little extra sensation going on at the fingertips.” He wiggles his metal fingers at Steve for emphasis.
Tony’s smirk grew wider and he started stepping slowly, deliberately, towards Steve. Steve kept his face blank, a mask of professionalism, and watched as Tony leaned himself onto the desk, head tipped in a defiant tilt. Even in this low light, Steve could see how blown Tony’s pupils were in arousal.
Stark ground up against him, one arm and two legs wound tight around Steve as he continued to move his hips in languid rolls. Steve took the moment to enjoy the ride, wrapped in Stark's warmth with bristly kisses breathed onto his cheek. He could feel Tony growing hard between them with every roll of hips. If this were any other time, he would let Stark do whatever he wanted. If they were in any other place, he might be inside Stark already. Stark could have been inside him already…
Somewhere, a deity was probably laughing at him and counting their unexpectedly doubled dues. It took two to fight a war. And the same two to end the war. It took one stupid wish and the payment of the one last thing he didn’t know he still had. Something he never would have given.
Steve huffed in amusement. Tony Stark, never letting a moment go unsullied by his terrible humor. And Steve loved him for it even more.
Almost nine million people in this city and only a handful could treat him like a normal fella. He didn’t scream superhero but his superserumed physique was still noticeably different to the civilians he wanted to interact with.
Sam silently praises the sun. “Look, here’s what you’ll do. Next time he video calls, ask him to stick around when he visits. Take him to that café. Have some fun. It doesn’t have to be a date. It can just be two good friends having some fun in town. Let it develop from there.”
“Muffins. He bakes us muffins when he’s in the mood. Usually after a marathon texting session with you.”
Steve, still sore in at least twelve different places, had swept a quick eye over the crowd, chattering in excitement among themselves for having come across the great Tony Stark. They hadn’t looked like they were going to cause more trouble, and a few of them had even started to help pick up the broken crockery and furnishings. Steve made a decision and had run out after Tony.
Rhodey chuckle comes through the comm, still on private. “They’ll come through. He listens to you more than most of us.”
“Did you go find someone to give you a hand?” Tony asked before his brain-to-mouth filters caught up.
A flock of birds fly over the trees in the distance. Behind them, the sound of Quinjet engines rise and fall. A duck quacks somewhere in the distance.
Steve turned back to the counter, keeping his head down, and started putting the fruits into the fruit bowl at the corner of the counter. Oranges. Apples. Bananas. The grapes should go in the fridge-
It was a game Steve thrilled in playing -- shattering Tony’s control and using his toys against him. Slowly, so very slowly, he dragged his palms down the front of Tony's chest, feeling the contrast of suit, shirt, waistcoat, and skin. He stopped to pinch sharply at Tony's nipples through three layers of fabric, breathed in Tony's groan, and continued on his way down until he was undoing the front of Tony's pants and slowly pulling the fly open over the bulge of Tony's erection.
“Wow, Cap. I’d’ve expected that from Tony,” Natasha said. “Clint and I are in position to capture the chicken again. Clint, on my mark.”
“Everything is safe now,” Tony continued in front of him, “Normal. Calm. Well, as normal, safe, and calm as it’ll ever get in New York City.”
it. Now, he runs his hands over the soft sheets, pressing against the firmness of the mattress and feeling it depress against the pressure. “It was Howard, alright? I thought he was a bit of a womanizer.” He looks at Tony and almost wants to kick himself for having had mistaken this man for Howard all those months ago. It’s not just in how different the two men look, but Tony also carries himself differently, thinks differently, acts differently, and in the end Steve just knows Tony better than he ever knew Howard. “I
God, he just wanted to lie down somewhere and let the frozen peas do their thing. He made his way through the darkened living room by rote. When he was at the large couch, he dropped himself onto it without preamble.
He scrambled to help Steve shove his pants off his hips just enough to feel the heat of skin pressed against sweat-slick skin. It was almost harder to do than the twenty-four hours of almost-celibacy he’d endured but when his dick did finally touch Steve’s, the last little slivers of sanity left him and he gave in to the primal urge to just rut and take and take and give and give—
Steve opened his mouth for an apology but only grunted as Stark molded his body to Steve’s, curling his arms around Steve’s biceps. Steve stiffened as he felt the press of warm chest muscles against his arm. He tried very hard to will his heartbeat down and to stop a blush from rising to his cheeks; Tony Stark was definitely more attractive in person.
It was Tony's warmth filling out the smooth wool underneath his hands, and how sleek the sleeves felt underneath his fingertips whenever he dared to allow his touch to linger on a shoulder, an arm, a wrist. How Tony started leaning into his touches. How Tony looked, buttons undone, dark silk framing bared skin and the bright glow of an arc reactor.
Steve laughs out loud and shakes his head. He nudges Tony to sit on the bed and then joins him. He could always touch, but he never
Steve should want to salvage their ruin of a relationship. Tony had been his, once. Steve didn’t have the privilege of calling him that anymore.
Tony smiled at him, flirtatious. He pushed back from the table and slowly started to undo his cuff links. They dropped to the floor in careless thuds and then Tony’s fingers were at the buttons of his suit jacket. Steve kept his calm façade, but he couldn’t help his breath catching at the sight of Tony’s fingers flicking open the buttons one by one. As Tony let the jacket slide off his arms with a roll of his shoulders, Steve finally had enough of the distance between them.
He thought he saw Steve say something but he couldn’t hear it. He thought he knew what it was. He tried to say it back, tried to make his lips form the words. The Stone was still in his grasp and it was burning through his entire being, consuming him. He loosened his grip further, feeling the burn lessen and his throat finally obeyed him.
Thor was cut off by the sound of something heavy slamming into the pavement and then the noise of something large deposited into an even larger pile of dry leaves.
“How’d this happen?” Tony said shakily, lips brushing at the skin beneath them. He felt hands rest on his back and waist. They were so warm. “How are you alive?”
“I’m in my usual spot!” Steve yelled back, feeling a beat in his chest. “I wanted to make sure you were okay. You’d never miss watching The Matrix or planning a party. And it’s not like I haven’t seen a naked man before.” He had been in the army and Tony of all people should definitely know that.
Steve wasn't one to lie to himself – he liked it when Stark took control. He liked it when Stark put on a show for him, satisfied him with theatrical moans like he was doing now. But the idea of having him bound and unable to wrestle control away like he usually did was something Steve never really thought about until this moment. He was usually the one to be taken apart by a clever mouth and fingers. This time, however, he was going to be the one wringing honest noises out of Stark's throat.
Spengler nodded. “Exactly. Now, we’re taking this to your debrief and you explain to everyone exactly what happened when that Trap activated and closed.” He turned and marched towards Conference Room Five.
Jim watches as Tony sighs and slips off his stool, moving towards at empty table further into the bar. Jim signals to the bartend before he follows.
What? Tony snapped his mouth shut and studied the Captain’s dimly lit features as the other man slowly walked towards him. He couldn’t make out the expression. He thought he saw recognition there but his brain was probably just playing wish fulfillment with him.
“You know,” he says as he dodges a drone with a spin, wings straining, “there’s this new café that opened up in town.” He banks left hard to avoid another drone, then twists around, shooting the paint rounds onto the little drone that buzzed him. It drops out of the area with a sad, farting noise and Sam continues on towards the Target of the Day. “Atmosphere is nice. Good coffee. Excellent pastries. You could take someone there, Cap.”
This was the worst time to talk about this. Tony closed his eyes and kept his hands firmly planted on the knees of his crossed legs. He wondered where Steve’s hands were. “JARVIS said you had something to say? Is it about the others? What happened to the others? J, what happened to the others?”
Tony looked up at the intercom, then cycled to the lab cameras on his phone. They were on loop and Tony almost dropped the Trap on the ground and left then and there. It wasn’t like he could waltz in and
Steve was staring down at the Trap, and he looked up to Tony with a frown at Tony’s prompt. “That was dangerous,” he said simply.
Steve got to work, teasing his fingers into Tony's ass one by one, eased by a minimal amount of lube. Tony let out lovely moans at each finger added as Steve took over the talking and whispered all his dirty thoughts into Tony's ear, glad that Tony couldn't see him blush through describing the many ways he was going to ruin Tony and the suit. When Steve pushed a fourth finger into Tony's loosening hole, he gave the back of Tony's neck a kiss and knelt down to check his handiwork, fingers never leaving their snug place inside Tony's body.
Thor shakes his head. “I, like yourself, have only just stepped into the building. But I do believe Tony is yet to arrive.”
“I’ve got a good medical team,” Steve said. He reached forward and poked at the injured right shoulder. The agent rose a few pegs in his estimates by not screaming at the gesture. “Tell me, and I can get you patched up and send you off.”
“No psychokinetic energy. No psychomagnotheric energy. No anything.” Spengler flipped the switches on the side and the Trap opened.
Steve shook his head. "Got 'em all, and none of them'll be comin' back any time soon." He indicated Stark's entire body from head to toe. "They roughed you up?"
Revelations of Stark’s social practices aside, the rest of what Stark said was what Steve hated the most about the 21
“Steve. I’m still horny. Normal horny.” Tony nudged at Steve’s shoulder. When Steve didn’t respond other than by burying his nose deeper into Tony’s neck, Tony squeezed at Steve’s ribs with his knees. “C’mon, Rogers. I'd fuck you, but I might need a few hours. You, though, you can start making do on all those promises.”
Tony didn’t feel an ounce of sympathy. Instead, he felt the heat of anger rise at his throat. He tried to grab for the puff but his hands met nothing. The puff glowed bright, green, at the half-contact and Tony clenched his fists. “Put him back,” Tony snarled. “Where is he? Put him back to how he was.”
Tony snorted, heart warming a little at the equally teasing and affectionate nickname. “I need to come up with a ridiculous nickname for you. Hang on, it’s coming to me!”
“My choice was to sign myself up as an attack dog for the government, or to not. It wasn’t a hard choice and I stick by it.”
Tony waved it away. He might have been angry (very angry) once upon a time, but now he didn’t think he could be anymore. He remembered those dreams, those nightmares – they’d shown Steve what he himself could never put to words, things he could never have even brought up to Steve in the first place. Tony knew he was a coward in that respect so he was grateful for them, in retrospect; Steve had seen it all, and hadn’t walked away.
Steve might not be gone yet. The universe hated Tony sometimes but this was too far. Tony was going to find Steve again, by whatever means necessary. He would bring Steve back.
Steve finally took a step into the apartment and closed the door behind him. Ignoring the out-stretched hand, he side-stepped Tony and made his way to the counter to put away his groceries.
When Tony had been young, he’d had three certainties in his life: one, that cool logic, the methods of science, would always be where his mind functioned best; two, that the idea of ghosts completely negated his first certainty and thus should be ignored, no matter what his mother or Jarvis had told him to get him into bed; three, that his father had liked Captain America, World War II hero and national icon, better than him and he was never going to find out if Cap was really that much of a paragon because Cap was long dead.
"Did you kill him?" Stark's voice was hoarse. He was a smart man, and T'Challa knew he was working it out now that he was given time and distance to reflect. There was no mistaking that Stark was now referring to Zemo.
“You can admit that I was your best, you know, Tony,” the blond continued before Stark could say anything. “Tall, blond, and handsome you’ve got there is a poor stand-in. If you want, I can teach him how to please you, seeing how you aren't looking very satisfied these days.”
Tony pulled a good thread roughly from his sleeve. “You asked,” he said. “And you lusting after me now only when we’re both very unscientifically sex whammied isn’t helping.”
The unofficial summary of the fic was: Nat and crew try to get Tony and Steve to go on one date. They themselves get set up in the process. Everyone is subtly unsubtle.
It was a promise in the way they both separated, lips clinging and pulling apart, but plunged right back in with a plea to stay. It was the promise of a place to belong, a place for a new beginning, and a place for happiness to finally, finally take root.
His need was too strong. It was everything. Every stroke of Steve’s tongue, every scrape of Steve’s teeth, and every squeeze at his hips fanned the heat brewing within him. He felt so empty. He needed to be filled. He needed to fill Steve. Anything. He gripped tighter at Steve’s hair, drawing out a low moan, and he seized the opportunity to invade Steve’s mouth and take what was always his.
century culture and history, and doing whatever it was that Steve wanted to do. Steve was still unsure of what it was he had stayed for, which was puzzling to all the paranormal experts they’d consulted but they’d kept trying. Tony knew Steve wasn’t dealing well with being a fully ethereal ghost and he’d tried to confine his support to providing Steve with non-physical means of exposure to the world which mostly equated to entertainment media and sightseeing. From the increasing number of smiles on Steve’s face, Tony thought he was at least doing something helpful, even if it wasn’t to actively help move Steve on, and even if he fell asleep on the couch every other night, not even halfway through whatever it was they’d been watching.
reached up with a frown and scratched at the side of its head. It mouthed something Tony couldn’t make out. “You know Howard? Howard Stark? Are you related to Howard?”
And in many other ways, kissing Tony was as familiar to Steve as breathing, as walking. Kissing Tony was safety and it was home.
Tony heard the sirens on the helicarrier sound again. The lab was flashing red with the rise and fall of the klaxons. More call-outs for high Class entities. More trouble in the streets. Shit. PLASM was only so big; they couldn’t deal with this level of activity. The team was already called out for two Class Sevens, one stampede of Class Sixes, twelve Class Fives, and more than a hundred of other minor paranormal activities from all around the five boroughs. Even if Tony had joined them, they were not going to be able to contain this.
“I would’ve come to find you. And, well,” Steve's arms tightened around him, "they didn't want to bring your hopes up for nothing."
“Jesus Christ!” Tony shouted, and scrambled away from the voice, landing with a thud on the other side of the bed. As he tried to untangle himself from the sheets, he called for JARVIS and the suit.
They made their way down the hall, checking various doors as they passed them — lavatories, small offices and storage rooms as far as Steve could tell — until they reached the control room. It contained a whole lot of dust and multiple small, outdated televisions embedded into the structure on the far wall — CRT, if Steve remembered the name correctly from the technology guide books he'd read, although he couldn't quite place the decade.
Tony let out a frustrated sound when the bodyguard pulled out two padlocks and closed them around the loops on the buckles, finalizing Tony's fate for the time being with two soft
he asked mockingly. Tony couldn't quite contain the glare he sent Hammer's way. Whatever, it just added to his performance. "You're getting old, aren't you, pal?"
"I really don't like hurting people," Marco told him, "I don't like hurting you either. But I will, if you force my hand." Tony wanted to roll his eyes at him, but couldn't quite gather the courage required for it, lying as he was on the floor, dizzy and shaking like a leaf. Maybe once he caught his breath.
Steve gives him a terse nod, and Rosie mumbles a soft goodbye to which Rick replies to with a wave of his hand. Tony doesn't bother saying anything, just curls his arms tighter around Rose and lets the book fall from his hand and land on top of the covers of Steve's bed.
"Not sulking, hon," Tony replies, turning to smile at her and level a glare at his husband. "Your Father just imagined it, I'm sure. He must be pretty tired from his day at work." Rick's mouth twitches at Tony's retort, but Tony can't tell if it's the good or the bad kind. Either way, he just decides to roll with it.
The man that had first grabbed him, nose bleeding from Tony's punch and beard straggly, crouched down and twisted his hands behind his back. And all Tony could do was watch as he did it.
"Hey," Rick says, stepping up behind Tony and boxing him between his chest and the kitchen counter, his nose buried in the omega's thick hair. It's a few minutes till 12 PM, and Rick has just gotten back from another trip for SI. This time he was gone for a little under five days for some prolonged negotiations in Seattle.
His hands trembling and his vision slightly dimming around the edges, Tony wasn't sure whether to be happy that he had the right to finish his studies and any rights to Stark Industries at all — since this,
"Well, what do you think? Pretty, right?" Rick inquires as he steps into the room behind Tony. He walks over to the table and plucks a single, pink lisianthus out of the colourful bouquet, and hands it to Tony. His eyes fall on the necklace, still visible, resting over the fabric of Tony's shirt, and he reaches a hand to straighten it, so that his name etched on it is level with the horizon. "Don't you think it would call for something a little more nicer to put on?" He tugs meaningfully at Tony's band t-shirt.
"Hi, peanut," he says, hugging her close to his chest as she twines her small arms around his neck in her customary choke hold. "I missed you."
That meant Tony had been missing for about six hours now. Rhodey, Steve and the team must have been informed already, as well as the authorities.
Marco sighed somewhat explosively. "Just, leave it at that, man. We're supposed to only deliver him."
However, before he could pull himself up to his aching feet, Ezekiel had wrapped his hand around the back of his neck and pushed him back down. He
Tony is glad. This way, he can keep a direct eye on his teammates and make sure none of them go missing again. Rick hadn't been happy, as expected, but he was smart enough not to attempt to keep Tony off the field. He had lost that fight a long time ago.
They walked to the door that lead to the dining room, where Bates stopped and gestured at Tony to raise his hands. Reluctantly, he did, only because he saw no way out of it, and Bates clipped the chain back to the D-rings, securing them to each other. Then, he knocked on the door.
In the end, all Rick does is huff out a soft laugh, adjusting Rosie in his arms as he does. "Well, I'm glad that's settled then. I wouldn't want my husband to spend too much time in the presence of contemptuous individuals," he says, extending one arm to stroke the side of Tony's face. The engineer deftly evades the touch, but Rick's hand still lands on his neck, caressing the skin there as the fingers travel down his shoulder, then his back. Tony is painfully aware of Steve's gaze following Rick's hand as it sweeps over him.
"It's okay," Steve reassures again, smiling at Tony. It's a little strained, and Tony thinks he knows why; they still haven't gotten to talk about yesterday's
Tony felt his gut twist at the words and the hairs at the back of his neck stood on end. He didn't want this.
Now though, Rick kept his gaze locked to Tony's, his mouth set in a slight smirk that seemed to be his trademark expression. Tony kept a straight face throughout the whole ceremony.
So, he goes, and ends up entertaining guests for five long hours in total, meeting only once with Rhodey over the span of those hours, until Rick walks up to him and tells him that their driver will be taking them home in half an hour. To
Tony frowns at the hallway. "I can handle it, Steve." And he knows he can. He just handled a whole unit of HYDRA agents, whether or not it was with JARVIS' help. "JARVIS, get the civilians out. I'll make sure you're not followed."
By the time Tony was finished with his survey of the room, Hammer was finally reigning in the last of his giggles and Ezekiel was pulling out his chair and taking a seat opposite to him.
"I told him," a distorted female voice answered, and Steve twisted around towards the speaker. He had to blink a few times to make sure he was seeing who he thought he was.
Tony felt sick. In fact, yes, he had noticed, he had been alerted of a security breach to his servers, but the access had been terminated quickly enough for him to not loose his sleep over it, despite all his paranoia. He had assumed it was a rookie from SHIELD, trying their luck at one of the sturdiest firewalls in the country. FRIDAY had attempted to trace the hacker's IP address, but they had been using a proxy server to hide it.
Their life continues on as if everything was normal, Tony giving up hope to ever owning more than 30% of his own company, when he still doesn't get pregnant soon after his 39th birthday. In Afghanistan he'd mulled things over again, and begun to think that maybe a child wouldn't be that bad of a thing after all. At least then he'd had done one good thing in his life.
"Yes, Sir," replied the woman — Dina. She turned, walking through the door on the other side of the room, presumably leading to the kitchen.
"I can, actually," Tony said, doing his best to stare Marco down from his spot on the floor. "Most times I just choose not to. Also, fuck you."
"What?" he asked, shrugging as well as he could with his hands bound to the bed. "I asked nicely, didn't I?"
Steve found out a couple of hours later, the trail long gone cold, the building empty and the venue cleared out of guests. The first thing he'd done, was punch a hole through the wall. The second, was to alert the rest of the team.
"Can we go and give Steve a flower, too?" she asks, stopping her earlier tale mid-sentence, and turns to look at Tony with wide eyes.
He hit Tony again, this time on his other thigh. "His friendship?" he asked, taking a hold of Tony's jaw and twisting his face upward. "Or, is it his love?"
the alpha yells at him furiously, and boy, doesn't that make all the hairs on his body stand on end. It's frightening, and Tony's omega side starts immediately begging for Tony's alpha to come and save him, even though Tony's rational side knows that he's completely safe here with Steve. Probably even safer than he'd be with Rick one floor up.
He wasn't back at the compound, playing poker with Rhodey, Natasha and Steve, but in the back of a car that smelled of cigarette smoke, disoriented and in pain.
"I know doctors that can kill with the snap of their fingers, so you being a doctor really isn't any excuse, miss," he said. He wasn't sure whether Strange would appreciate his assessment on him, but it would have to do for now. He was in a pinch.
"Becker is a handful, Sir," Bates explained without any actual remorse to his tone, "Marco informed me that this was his way of...punishing him for attempting to escape."
We're now entering the part of the timeline where things are starting to build up towards Age of Ultron. Currently AoU is about a year away, and we start from early spring, 2014. Enjoy!
Still, he swallowed past the lump forming in his throat, forcing his voice to stay even as he spoke the words that would end his life as he knew it, "I do."
"From this day on, no more talking back or bitching to me. You do what I tell you to do, and you do it when I tell you to do it. And you
He carefully released the tension he had stored in his frame, trying to will his hands to cease their trembling as he did. He inhaled and exhaled in an attempt to calm himself.
. First, you stripped our nation of our best weapons, because you decided that manufacturing and designing them was beneath you. Then, you befriended aliens, going as far as welcoming one into your home with open arms."
"What," he grits out, and shakes Bruce's hand off, turning towards Barton but refusing to meet his gaze. He's feeling too raw for that now.
When the data is done downloading, he leaves the control room and goes to help his team with the cleanup. He's starting to think that Steve was right all along. Maybe the HYDRA head was just baiting him to get him all puzzled, to get his attention elsewhere.
"Stark," Ezekiel bit out, resentment clear in his voice. He walked further into the room, stopping when he was only a few feet away from Tony. Tony felt himself go tense as he peered up into Ezekiel's eyes.
"FRIDAY can analyze a sample," Rhodey replied, scraping off some of the blood with his armored thumb, then pressing it into a compartment on his arm. They waited only a moment in silence, until FRIDAY piped up,
Tony sets her down and she pouts up at him. "I want Daddy to do it!" she whines and throws her arms up in an universal 'pick me up' sign. Tony sighs.
"No, no, no," Tony protested, struggling against the cuffs with all his might. He needed just one hand! The sedative would start effecting within the first two minutes — he would have to get away,
The next mission is in the early June when they have gathered enough intel to breach the second HYDRA base. This mission is less volatile than the last, with less risk factors such as civilians or underground conditions. It's a simple plan; infiltrate, subdue and cleanup.
Rhodey sighed. "Yeah..." He stood up from his crouched position and moved closer to Steve. "Not that I'm happy about it."
"Hammer wants you to have dinner with him," Bates replied and Tony wanted to groan. Right. He had completely forgotten about Hammer.
"None of that. Ms. Potts will send help my way. I can hold my own for a while." He jerked his chin in the direction of the hall. "Now, go."
"Morning, Cap," he replies, not turning from where he's loading the coffee machine. He pushes the on button when he's ready.
She seemed terrified at the notion and Tony wondered how she had come to have a position such as this. Now wasn't the time to unpack all that, however.
"You know you couldn't even hold a candle to him," Ezekiel continued, his voice drowning out the others in Tony's ears. He let go of him as if disgusted and the burn of embarrassment inside Tony intensified. "He hates you, just like the rest of the world."
"Yeah," the toddler replies him and grabs handfuls of Steve's shirt when the alpha plucks her from Tony's lap. Tony eyes the tray curiously; there's a bowl full of some sort of veggie stew, a cup of water,
Natasha says through the comm. Tony taps his ear, the one with JARVIS in it, and the readings are obediently displayed in front of his face from the head piece. Between him and JARVIS, the next set of cameras are hacked in less than five seconds. He meets Steve's gaze through the holograms and nods.
and scurried over to Marco as he pushed the door shut. When he turned, Tony grabbed him by the wrist and brought his other hand up to deliver a hard, open-palmed strike to his jugular. The plastic bag containing their food dropped to the floor.
"We decided that you needed a break," Steve's voice informs him, and Tony turns his head to see the alpha walking towards Tony's workstation, a tray in his hands.
"Becker...." Marco said from underneath Tony, voice filled with meaning. Tony frowned down at him and turned his head to look at Becker. He watched as understanding flooded his expression, then relief and Tony went cold with doubt.
, he released him. Tony gasped for breath, eyes watering as he pulled air into his lungs in rough gulps. He could feel himself shaking.
"I couldn't even tell it was a snow leopard," he admits, smiling over his glass at the alpha. Rogers smiles back at him.
Tony takes a steadying breath. "I'm not wearing it," he states, voice wavering with anger and repressed emotion. So much for a good moment.
"Rough day?" Bruce asks from one of the couches in the common floor living room, where he's currently reclined on, watching his fellow scientist collapse on another couch. Tony wordlessly hands him Rosie's drawing, after carefully freeing one hand from beneath the sleeping girl now that she's lying on top of him and not balanced against gravity.
"Yes, Sir," Bates replied and swiftly left the basement. At the top of the stairs, he closed the door with a definitive
Becker shook Marco's hand off. "I'm not afraid of Bates," he said unconvincingly and — with difficulty — seemed to regain his composure. Or, at least most of it. He sent one last vicious look in Tony's way, then turned around. "I'm going to have a smoke," he said and left the motel room.
"For kidnapping me, obviously," he said, frowning and trying to convey just what he thought of the other man and his intellect, "Is everyone in your line of work an idiot? In the kidnapping business, I mean."
Cap is giving them orders through sign language. It comes in handy at moments like these, even if it gives Clint an excuse to boast about the usefulness that they all learned it, and how it's thanks to him. Thor and Natasha go one way, Steve, Clint and Tony the other. The Iron Man armor, not really built for stealth, is left for JARVIS to commandeer and keep watch in. Tony's brought and extra pair of gauntlets, a chest plate, shin pieces and his head piece, anyway.
He didn't mind waiting, though, because he was a little afraid to disappoint his parents if he turned out to be an omega. Scratch that,
Rick or even miss him when he's gone, and he hates his traitorous body for making him so dependent on another human being.
The hands returned to his shoulders, keeping him still. "Easy," Bates told him, and Tony noticed that his breathing had sped up considerably. He tried to calm himself down again, find that courage from a couple of minutes ago, but it was hard. Impossibly hard.
The years fly past, blurred by alcohol, inventing, verbal and physical fights with Rick, and Tony doesn't feel sorry for not getting knocked up. Even though the omega part of his brain makes him hate himself for being unable to give his alpha a child, the rational part is overjoyed about not getting the short end of the stick for once. Rick isn't happy, as expected — thus, neither of them is really happy. But you can't always have it all, right?
Marco let go of him to pull out a chair and Becker unceremoniously pushed him down to sit in it, ignoring the pained hiss Tony couldn't quite contain when his bruised flesh hit the wooden surface. He kept his hands on Tony's shoulders, preventing any further movement out of his seat.
"Yes, Sir," Bates replied, walking up to Tony. Tony shrugged off the hand that grabbed his arm, but couldn't evade the one that enclosed around his right hand, the one holding the knife. His knuckles were white from pursing his fist around the handle, and yet it didn't take more than the slightest pressure from Bates to make him release his hold.
"Has he now?" Hammer asked. He seemed interested rather than amused now, and the overly fake polite smile he had plastered on his face spoke of his resentment. The side-eye he gave Tony told him that it was probably because Ezekiel had managed to make
He was struggling with pulling the shirt on when there was a knock at the door and Bates abruptly pushed it open.
, he thought, looking at the smudges of blood again. Maybe they could find something else here, too.
"Sure," he agrees anyway, and it must come out as sarcastic, because Rick's eyes flash with anger again. He grasps the back of Tony's neck in his palm.
"Follow me, please," Tony shouts over the alarm, getting their attention. When discussing the mission plan, they had previously agreed on who would take which part of the mass of prisoners, and Tony had been voted to take the front if he needed to reopen any routes for them. "We'll get you out of here."
"I mean it," Steve clarifies from the other side of the counter, having followed Tony to the kitchen. "I'll do everything in my power to help you out. And Rosie."
Tony huffs softly, looking to the side as he tries to avoid answering. "We fight all the time, Cap. It's nothing unusual." When he sees the stormy expressions returning on Steve's and Clint's faces, he hurries to soften the blow of his words, "I mean, the fighting. Not the hitting. I mean, no, this isn't the first time he has punched me--" okay, Stark, this isn't helping your case the least, "--but hey, I have punched him too, you know. Plus, it's not like he's really breaking any laws."
Rhodey took one look at the monitors and concluded that they hadn't been used in a very long time. Steve had been expecting as much. He sighed; he could almost hear Tony mocking them, standing there with them in the middle of dusty, broken tech and creaky office chairs.
Tony looked up at him in confusion. He couldn't bring himself to stand up, how was he supposed to walk upstairs after Ezekiel? Was Ezekiel mocking him?
Tony nodded again and shifted his gaze to Becker. He was angry, but also surprised. He glared at Tony for a moment, then looked down at his phone screen again.
Then, about five months later, around Christmas, the Mandarin happened. Tony was barricaded with a swarm of reporters as he spat threats at a camera, almost going as far as inviting the terrorist to his home door.
it! You just say that you'll 'get motor oil on it' or some shit. Well, you can't get motor oil on a necklace unless you're going to dunk into a damn container full of it!"
"Oh, he won't manage," Tony reassured. Still, he didn't like the thought of Hammer's greasy fingers all over the housing unit. "Can you get it to me?"
Tony bit his lip and nodded reluctantly, grip tightening around the bobby pin. This would complicate things.
He had summoned one of the suits still in the workshop beneath the penthouse floor, then flown a couple of miles before he'd been shot down to the sea. That's when JARVIS had taken over and in turn flown him all the way to Tennessee. From there he leaves a message to Pepper, trusting his long time personal secretary, nowadays a COO thanks to the promotion Tony'd arranged her two and a half years ago, the highest she could get within the company without being the CEO, and his dear friend, to get it and inform others that he was still alive and kicking.
"Daddy was tired?" she asks, absently kicking her shoes off as Steve's hands grasp at her feet. The two of them look homely, comfortable in a way that indicates love and mutual trust between an adult and a child, and Tony's head feels warm and fuzzy at the thought. It feels like a proper family.
They get them to follow, but it takes a while since there is at least fifty people and most of them seem to be a little out of it. The shooting that starts doesn't help one bit.
Tony chuckles softly. "You're right, Rose. Daddy was just taking a nap." He brushes a hand over the toddler's forehead, carding away stray pieces of hair as Steve pulls off her back bag and starts unlacing her shoes.
Which brings me to: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you who left me lovely and encouraging comments! You guys, you wouldn't believe how much they've warmed my heart. I haven't replied to any I've received in my absence, but believe me when I say I've read them over and over again, and that they were the thing that got me continuing writing again. So thank you, and I'm sorry, you really deserve better.
"Hey, Steve, Clint," Tony tries, but to no avail. He starts panicking when the two near the elevator and the staircase. "JARVIS! Lockdown on common floor!" he screams and instantly the lights flicker off, replaced by dimmer emergency lighting, and the doors to the stairs don't give an inch when Steve yanks at them.
So, when at the age of 38, still not having gotten pregnant, he gets taken by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings, he decides to turn his steadily downwards spiraling life around and creates Iron Man in order to safe himself. His heart breaks once more when he hears that he'd been betrayed by the one man that he'd still considered family, a last attempt at getting his hands on the SI before Tony turned 40 and the company would belong to the Darrows by law, as was according to the contract. He kills Obadiah, and doesn't sleep properly for months afterwards.
After cleaning up and getting away the worst of the dirt and blood on his person, he made use of the facilities. As he washed his hands, he eyed the set of new clothes on the counter. It was another t-shirt, folded on top of a pair of soft-looking pants. In between there were a pair of briefs and socks.
ed again and the next blow was pure agony; Becker had used the buckle end to strike him, and Tony could feel welts opening up on his back, leaking blood. He cried out.
"Why?" Ezekiel still continued, seemingly reveling in Tony's turmoil. His hand had left Tony's shoulder and was now traveling down, coming to rest on his bruised ribs. "Why doesn't he love you?"
Steve looks at him with hopeful eyes now, and stands up to walk over to Tony. Tony feels like he should shrink back, but he stands his ground, because it's
He shuddered involuntarily as the words left his lips, wanting to take them back. His mind had been on Obie too much lately, and now he was already dropping phrases that the man had used to.
He's standing by an intersection to another set of hallways, looking intently at a metallic structure. Tony inches to stand next to him and sees figures on the surface of the metal. He turns his head to watch Clint signing the details to cap, who nods before signing back.
"Five minutes. Got it," Tony said, turning his body so less was visible to Becker. He didn't like the creep leering at him. The t-shirt he wore felt all too thin all of the sudden. He lifted his hands a little. "What about the cuffs?"
Tony bristles and abandons his cup of brûlée in favour of taking his wine glass in hand. He swirls the liquid in its vessel, once again remembering his Mother as he always does when he's holding a glass of wine, and takes a sip. "It's Captain America. Who wouldn't be fond of the guy?"
"Fury? What is it? Is it about Cap and the others?" he asks quickly, mind jumping from one unsettling conclusion to another and so on. He sets the tablet back down.
He gingerly shrugged off the remains of his t-shirt, letting it drop to the floor by his feet, and kicked off his sweatpants. He picked up the washcloth and wet it, adding a little soap, and swiped it across his chest.
He didn't bother waiting for longer than fifteen minutes before asking Becker to let him use the toilet.
JARVIS displays a holographic scan of the contract and Tony watches in silence as his teammates read through it. Even Natasha ventures from the kitchen to join with the reading. Tony doesn't have to. He knows the contract by heart, could recite it from word to word if needed.
, with Tony's whole life depending on it staying a secret, whether or not their affair is mostly innocent at the moment. Rick won't care about the semantics were he to learn about Tony and Steve's budding romance.
Tony paused, eyeing the cutlery in his hands, before continuing, "How did you get your filthy hands on my tech?" he asked bluntly and raised his gaze to look Hammer dead in the eye. He needed to capture any tells that Hammer would let slip past; he had to get his weapons
Steve might not be coming. Rhodey might not find him. The team operated on too many variables nowadays. Tony had to be prepared to survive by himself.
had a vision for your company! For this country! His weapons would have saved us from that monster. He was going to protect us, arm us, unlike you and your bunch of freaks that somehow have the authority to run around rampantly."
"Sweetie," he begins, smoothing his hand over Rose's forehead gently. "Steve will come home, alright? He's doing work with Clint and Nat, remember baby?"
"She's going to screw this up," Rhodey said with an clipped tone, banging his bare fist against the reinforced one-way mirror. Natasha didn't as much as react to the sound. "We won't get her to trial if she can plead coercion." He looked at Steve. He looked torn, just as Steve felt, and the look in his eyes was urgent. But his sense of morale was stronger than Steve's, since he continued, "Tell her to stop."
"—so we decided it was as good time as any to finally wrap this up. We have been in discussions of a deal considering the heir of Stark Industries as well as the second alpha child of the Darrow family—"
"Yeah, I've noticed. I could've done some quick sketches, though. I'm quite good at capturing moving targets." The alpha smiles down at Tony, and the omega feels the corner of his mouth quirking up.
Half an hour into his watch Marco ordered food in. As he spoke his order into the phone, Tony pulled his hair pin out of his pocket and removed the rubber tips. He bent the pin and pushed it into the lock, bending the exposed tip until it was shaped the way he wanted it, then closed it safely inside his fist.
"With a mouth like that you'll never get into Rogers' good graces, Stark," Ezekiel said, "Isn't that what you want? His acceptance?"
"Well?" Ezekiel pressed, his tone implying that he was growing tired of waiting for Tony's compliance. "Last chance."
"Next time answer with your mouth empty, okay hon?" Rosie hums at him, always the one to find a loophole to a rule, and chews on the dessert in her mouth.
"Don't speak with food in your mouth," Tony rebukes her. "And no, we're not going to Disney World." At the way Rose's face falls, Tony feels compelled to add, accompanied by a deep sigh, "Maybe some day, honey. But not today." It seems to placate her, and she tuns back to her plate. Tony cranes his neck to glimpse at Rogers and Barton. "I was thinking we'd go and see some playgrounds at the Central Park and visit the zoo as well. Then maybe get a bite to eat, later." The two give him approving nods.
He shakes Tony again as if to emphasize his words and then holds the boy's gaze, eyes unloving and calculating. It makes Tony's hands shake and he purses them into fists.
," Tony said levelly, "I've still got just enough fight left in me." He looked Hammer straight in the eye so the threat in his sentence wouldn't go unnoticed.
"Speking of oaths, I have another one," she spoke over Rhodey again. She turned her head back to look at him, the smile still on her face. "Doctor-patient confidentiality."
and afterwards you will still wear it." He lets go of Tony's face, but doesn't break their eye contact. "I would hate for Rose to wake up to your cries." The words make Tony flinch, his instincts going haywire as they scream at Tony to submit to his alpha and to fight the threat — his alpha — to protect his child. Rosie comes first, always, and Rick knows it. Tony watches as the alpha smirks at his reaction, sensing and smelling and plain old
"Still remember this?" Ezekiel asked, tapping Tony's back with the end of the crop. He walked over to crouch in front of Tony, pushing him back up. "Now, do as I say, and I won't be forced to use it on you again."
"Shut up, Tony. We are doing this now," Rick responded in an even voice, all business, yanking and ripping Tony's expensive white silk off of his shoulders in one fluid motion. The way it ripped felt like it was meant to rip anyways, so he didn't really care. Instead he was more focused on keeping his cool as the reality of the situation began to set in.
The alpha has a deathly pallor to his skin, which is otherwise littered with purple bruises or covered up with white bandages, and while the beeping of the heart monitor is steady and strong, the rise and fall of his chest seems too artificial and shallow. In addition to the ventilator and the heart monitor, Steve is also hooked up to an IV drip and a leg bag, and really, Tony is no rookie to standing near hospital beds with people he knows in them, but hell, this one takes the cake.
Tony had never bothered to find out what these so called 'signs' were in-depth (something about his behavior analysis and his physical development thus far, he'd gathered), but he trusted the doctor's medical opinion. He was happy that he'd most likely get to attend the same classes as his best friend, Rick, who'd been assigned to alpha classes about a year prior. In fact, most of his friends had transferred to alpha studies, since his school focused on students that were likely to present as alphas. It was the best and the most expensive private school his Father could have thrust him into.
"And I hear there's dessert coming afterwards, since it's a special occasion. You wouldn't want to miss that, right Rosie?" he tries to cheer her up, and look at that, she seems to visibly brighten at the mention of dessert.
Ezekiel released his hold on him completely, pushing away from him violently. "That's what I thought," he said, voice filled with disgust. Tony drew in a shaky breath, fighting for control over his emotions.
"I'm just going to take a breather outside, okay? It's a nice night, after all." He winked at her, smiling encouragingly, even while he felt nothing but. Sarah didn't either, if her pale face was anything to go by.
"Don't get cocky," he reprimands, turning to the people still crouching down the hall. "Come on, let's get the hell out of this place!"
"Yay!" she exclaims as Tony lowers her shimmying form to the floor, and runs back towards the room. Tony chats for a while longer with Omega Dunn as he waits for Rose to get ready to leave, since the kids that are still playing in the room are being watched over by an assistant, a young girl that seems to have her hands full as she monitors the children. Rosie seems to be in her sights more often than most other kids, so Tony suspects that his girl has already taken over the role of the class troublemaker. Great.
"Tony," Rogers cut him off with a sharp look. "It's not an alpha thing. You're a part of my team, so it's my duty to take care of you." At Tony's dubious look, he sighs again. "I help out Natasha with her workouts and training and Clint I help with his relaxation exercises that his therapist gave him. Sometimes, Thor and I try to figure out things like the Internet together and Bruce....well, Bruce I really can't help with anything other than cooking when he's doing it, since he takes care of himself and I don't know half the words that come out of his mouth when he's talking about his work. But you get my point, right?" He finishes, searching Tony's face. "I wanna help my team members. And that entails helping you. Which apparently consists of taking care of your basic needs, like eating and sleeping...—"
Tony met Hammer's gaze. "Yes, they are," he agreed, picking up his fork. He wouldn't be able to wield his knife and his fork at the same time with his hands bound so closely together, but he would make do with what was offered. "Company men in particular," he added, a slight grimace working up his face. "It's a tough business."
"Tell him to come in," he replies, lowering the tablet so that he can peer in the direction of the elevator and the door to the stairs. Soon, he sees Rogers emerging from the staircase, ever the athlete.
So, it's the most magical moment in his life when he one morning finds himself hunched over the toilet, puking his guts out, and after a visit to his doctor hears the words, "Congratulations, Omega Darrow, you seem to be expecting."
and hugs his daughter tightly to his chest, keeping a hold of Pepper's hand as he does. Rick's at the other side of the country, having been away handling SI business, and won't be making it back home till the next day because of the disturbances in air traffic that the alien invasion has caused.
Huh, so he's been here for quite a while then. "Sorry, Steve," he says while rubbing at his tired eyes. "I didn't realize I had been here for so long. She wasn't a bother was she?" He bounces Rosie on his knee. She waves at DUM-E and Butterfingers on the other side of the room.
Tony twist in his chair when he hears a happy squeal from behind his back. Romanov is playing with Rose, throwing and twirling her in the air as she giggles and tangles her tiny hand in the assassin's red hair. Tony feels the tension leaving his shoulders. A plate of scrambled eggs and toast is set before him.
"Move," he said simply, nodding towards the double doors. Tony eyed the people around the room, calculating the chances of successfully escaping now; his odds remained persistently below what Tony deemed as anything worth trying, and he saw no choice but to do as he had been told.
Hope that I don't seem like I'm hurrying to you guys. I myself prefer to get over the canon stuff as fast as possible, so that's why the story's been so summarized thus far. Next chapter, the pace will begin to slow, and we'll get to see some domestic Avengers, as well as some Steve/Tony moments. B-) Catch you next time!!
"Steve?" he calls, one hand on the alpha's chest as he watches intently for changes in his facial expressions.
Tony shook his head desperately, trying in vain to deny the statement, but it was too raw, the wound from his altercation with Steve still festering like an untreated cut. "Steve doesn't—"
"You're wrinkling your drawing, honey." He watches as Rosie unclenches her fingers and clumsily starts to smooth out the paper against her thighs. It's Sunday, and they are going to pay Steve a visit since Tony's nerves can't take anymore of Rose's constant questioning about the alpha. Also, the gruesome bruises and cuts have finally mostly healed on his face, so it's safe to bring a toddler to see him.
When he stepped out, Becker, who had been waiting by the nearest bed, walked to him and took him by his arm again.
"Boss won't like that," Luis suddenly spoke up. Beard ignored him in favor of grabbing Tony by the throat and pushing him tight against the floor. Tony's heart began hammering against his bruised rib cage.
"Yes," Bates said, twisting the rope around itself so it was pressed snugly against Tony's chest. Next, Tony felt it wrap around his upper arms. He sighed.
"Well, it's not gonna stop, Steve," Tony growls and pinches the bridge of his nose. He's really tired of this old conversation. "And there's nothing you can do, so suck it up!"
Only four of them were in the back with Tony, Boss presumably sitting at the front with the driver, and in the low light he could clearly see the blue lights of the ear pieces they all wore, designed to filter out the frequencies of the sonic taser. The ear pieces designed by
"You," Ezekiel cut him off, once again, "had taken on the mantle of protecting this planet. And you,
"Dad!" Rose squeals excitedly when the elevator doors reveal Rick's form standing inside the car. She pads over quickly, and Tony watches as she slows her steps as she nears the alpha, radiating nervous respect towards her Father. With Tony she would've just barreled straight to his legs, positively attempting to squeeze the life out of them, but Rick demands reverence. Sometimes the alpha reminds Tony so much of his own Dad that it makes him sick.
"What time is it?" he asked after a while of fidgeting. Two faces turned his way; Marco looked at him with an expression that said he couldn't believe Tony was on his shit again so soon; Becker just looked like he wanted to punch him. It seemed to be the norm.
"You need to get cleaned up," Bates said, pulling him up the rest of the way. Tony stumbled along as he walked him to the stairs, hands on his upper arms, and stopped there. "Do you need to be carried?"
"Becker, that's enough," Marco warned again, this time with more authority to his voice. "I think you've punished him quite...
"Good," Ezekiel said, shrugging off his coat. He handed it to his assistant. "Bring him down," he told Bates, then nodded at his own bodyguard, "You go with."
Tony gasped but refused to reply. Ezekiel twisted his shoulder with an angry sound, and Tony's mouth fell open with the pain.
"Yes," he gasps out finally, eyes desperately scanning the other man to find any sign of dishonesty. Any sign, that would make alarm bells go off inside his head. Any sign, that Steve would ever hurt him.
Truth is, Tony's happy about it. He doesn't want a kid. He'd be the worst parent. And Rick? Talk about worst. The only minuses are the added stress of losing the SI if, and when, the clause considering their child in the contract won't be carried out — the SI, which he'd found he genuinely enjoys running and working for, designing weapons and solving puzzles, alongside with being part of directing the company's interests and pissing Rick off — and the fact that Rick seems to be more and more prone to smacking Tony across the face when he blurts out something offensive (which really isn't all that rarely).
"She's good with kids," Rogers comments, eyeing the two girls behind Tony. The omega hums, grabbing a fork and shoveling eggs into his mouth.
"Now," he begun, shifting his gaze from the chain to Tony's face. "You do as I say, and I'll let you sit in that chair," he nodded his head towards the chair behind his shoulder, the one he had dragged over to the pole, "If you don't, you spend the night here on the floor. Got it?"
After him, had trailed in a woman, seemingly an assistant or secretary of sorts to Ezekiel. She held herself timidly, but didn't look surprised or particularly disturbed by witnessing a bruised up Tony Stark dressed in tatters, sitting there having brunch with Justin Hammer. Now, another woman walked through the doors, this one a bodyguard by the looks of her. Tony didn't recognize either of them.
"She sure enjoys Romanov's and Barton's company," Rogers observes, smiling at the two as Barton lifts Rose back up to the jungle gym.
"Stay still," she barked at Tony, buckling the other cuff tightly. She produced a short metal chain from the paper bag and clipped it onto the D-rings on the cuffs, securing Tony's hands around the pole.
Bucky was seated to his right, face blank and his posture stiff. Sam was next to him, looking serious as he digested the news. Neither of them knew Tony all that well, but they were acquainted with him or other team members well enough to acknowledge his importance, both as an Avenger and as a friend to the team.
Tony's eyes tracked Hammer's hands as he smoothed them over the blueprint. It was spread out on the table in front of him, along with an open notebook and a simple pencil. He was standing on the other side of the table, while Tony was seated by it, glaring up at the other man. Bates was lingering by the wall, as was expected, and the study felt small with all three of them cooped up in there, even if it was of average size, really.
After a few minutes, the War Machine armor kicked down the door to the interrogation room. Natasha let Dr. Miller slump against the table.
Tony coughed and pulled his legs under himself to sit up. "Careful with the merchandise," he quipped. With the current treatment, Tony feared soon his bruises would have bruises.
Becker hit him again, now with the leather part instead of the metal buckle. Tony supposed he ought to be grateful for it, but he couldn't quite bring himself to, not in the midst of the searing pain. He squirmed and bucked as Becker struck the open welts on his back, but Becker had him pinned down good and firm. He hit him again and again and again, until Tony's back felt like it was on fire.
"Impressed at your conviction to behave like a brat." Bates' voice was as indifferent as always, but the iron grip around Tony's chin spoke for itself.
Six years after their wedding, when he's been a year off any kind of suppressants, aged 25 years, Tony still hasn't gotten pregnant. He has been off Howard's suppressants ever since the consummation of the marriage, has had a wonderful total of three heats over the span of a year and he's eating healthy and exercising, more out of Rick's orders than of his own free will. The alpha wanted the heir to be in top condition, and that unfortunately included making Tony take care of himself too.
"Your latest patient," Rhodes clarified, his voice tight. He was visibly vibrating with anger, but reigning it in good. Better than Steve would have, in any case. "The one you treated last night."
"Hello, gorgeous," she wheedled at him, body turned all the way around to speak to Tony, her obvious alpha scent making his nose twitch. "You want something from over there? My treat."
He places his tumbler on the coffee table, then stands up to grab Rosie from Rick. He places her on the floor. "Run along now, pup. Go put on that nice new headband Aunt Pepper gave you, so you'll be fancy for dinner." She nods and takes Tony's command to 'run along' quite literally, speeding to her room to rummage through her drawer.
"You don't learn, do you?" he asked and reached for him. Tony went without too much of a struggle, since in the end he did prefer being handled by Marco rather then Becker. At least Marco could be reasoned with on an occasion.
Bates took a step forward, while Tony kept his eyes on Hammer and his face carefully blank. He wasn't afraid of Bates, or Hammer using him to inflict pain on Tony, but he wasn't an idiot either — he was the one at a disadvantage here, and painfully aware of that and what Bates was seemingly capable of.
has had a bruised face because of Tony for a couple of times, even), but he still doesn't think they need to know every detail of their relationship. He doesn't want their pity and they can't help him either because of the contract.
"What do you want?" he asked after a moment, when Bates had yet to say something. Instead of replying, the man walked behind Tony and Tony tried to angle his body in a way that would keep him in his sights. He started when Bates' hands grabbed a hold of his hips and lifted, dislodging the chain from the hook, then depositing him down so quickly that Tony lost his footing.
"Thank you, Rose. I like it a lot." Rose beams up at him, and seems to take that as encouragement to talk her head off, since the outpour of questions that had been staunched for the time being starts up again.
"You and the Avengers saved us," she stated with a wavering voice. Tony frowned at her in confusion and she swallowed. "I wanted to thank you."
, as Tony had begun calling it in his mind. "I'm alright, peanut. The doctors are saying they'll let me come home noon tomorrow."
Bates gave him another push, and Tony was steered to the middle of the room where a wooden pole stood. Bates pushed him down onto his knees next to it and held his hands when he attempted to break away from it.
"Hey," Tony says back, the omega in him purring at the attention his alpha is showering him with. His hands are full of clean plates he'd taken from the dishwasher to put into the cupboard, and he sets them down on the counter top. It's been a few weeks since Tony, Steve, Clint and Rose visited Central Park, although the memory is still fresh in the engineer's mind. Since then, everyone in the team has shifted to first name basis, Tony preferring to use his teammates' given names even in the privacy of his own mind.
"Ezekiel?" he asked, frowning as he looked the man over. It had been several years since he'd last seen him, but what Tony could remember of him as well as the striking resemblance to his father, Obadiah Stane, were enough to clue him in. This was definitely Ezekiel Stane, in the flesh.
He made Tony stand and kneel again and again, until his legs refused to move and the tears on his cheeks had dried up, replaced by the sweat of exertion. When he couldn't stand up anymore, Ezekiel struck him twice with the crop. Then he uncuffed his hands.
"Why?" Tony asked, pulling his arms to his sides. He was miserable and in pain, and just wished that Bates would give him a break before Ezekiel's inevitable return.
The first strike hurt like the devil; Ezekiel was strong and he took aim well, hitting him right on an existing bruise. The next one was on the other side of his back. The third one over an open wound. By the fourth one, Tony was trying to inch away from the crop.
Finally, after what feels like an eternity, she settles, and Tony bounces her on his knee to get her to cheer up. Pepper had taken over the duty of making her (and Tony) an afternoon snack, and Tony listens to her clattering away in the kitchen. Rose is still mostly nonverbal, being only a little over two years of age, but with her genes Tony shouldn't have been as surprised as he was when she uttered up at him, "Luv Dada." It was garbled and simple, and Tony could've easily misunderstood the almost-sentence, but he thinks he got the meaning behind it just right.
"Yeah, but she could eat again in an hour or so." Then he looked up, frowning. "Huh? You're making me food?" He watched as Rogers' back disappeared into the kitchen. "Hey, Steve, wait!" Because apparently 'Steve' was what he was calling him now. He scrambled up and hurried after the alpha. "You don't have to cook for me, I can cook for myself."
Tony did, hissing faintly as he rested his weight on his sore thighs, staring at the stretch of floor between himself and the table Hammer was seated at once again. He noticed movement from the corner of his eye and saw Bates leaning up against the wall as usual. Next to him stood Ezekiel's bodyguard and by her side the timid-looking assistant, still clutching Ezekiel's coat.
In his life Tony had been called by many names. Wonder Boy. The Futurist. The Merchant of Death. Iron Man. Some had claimed he was a one man army.
They move as quickly as they can, but it's still agonizingly slow. They are just past check point two, when a door is slammed open up the hallway and a unit of HYDRA agents bursts through.
"We were without protection because you, is what I'm saying. After Thor, alien invasions became the new norm. And with the Avengers, so did the destruction of entire cities."
He's finished one of the bigger projects that had been waiting for finishing touches, and tackled an enormous amount of paperwork, both digital and concrete, that have been piling up in his email and on his desk, as well as finished writing a few reports, when the door to the workshop hisses open and something latches to his leg. That something is his daughter.
And that's one of the reasons why Tony refuses to believe those ridiculous claims about alphas not being able to control themselves in the presence of omegas, especially if their heat is close or hits them while in public. Not when he'd seen first hand that an alpha could, in fact, resist the pull.
"Brace him against the van," Boss instructed Luis, who obediently pulled him up and sat him on the end of the van, between the open back doors. He was already capable of keeping his head up, but he did end up leaning heavily against one of the two benches in the van.
Tony rolled his eyes. Hammer had promised that in return for his help, he would be provided with food and a comfy bed, as well as a new set of clothes and the opportunity to bathe. He could even tend to his injuries, Hammer had said. He had promised a lot of things, all of which Tony had promptly refused.
Tony blinked at the question. "Why? Because I—" He cut himself off, not sure what to say without giving Ezekiel more ammo. Because of his guilt? Because he had been tired of fighting? Because he had been scared? Everything he could say, Ezekiel could use and spin against him.
Thinking back on the lightning of the basement, it had probably been some hours after he had passed out when someone came to get him, nudging him to rouse him from his sleep.
Tony swallows at the anxious feeling that surfaced when Steve mentioned leaving. He tries to push it down. Opens and closes his fists. "Okay."
"Your reactor," she said, tapping her own chest. His eyes widened. "Hammer has it here. Bates' guys brought it over today."
"Don't interrupt me," Ezekiel said with a dangerous tone, taking a step closer to Tony. Tony recoiled a little on instinct and hated himself for it. Ezekiel leaned down, looming over him. "Speak out of turn one more time, and you'll learn the consequences."
"Let me tell you something," the head alpha says, sounding winded from the labor of keeping Tony in place. He leans towards Tony's face, so close that Tony can smell his breath. "Let me tell you something about that alpha."
PLEASE READ: I just feel the need to point out that I'm not trying to romanticize the relationship between Tony and Rick in any way. It's not healthy in the least. What I'm trying to show you guys is how their relationship has twisted and morphed during the years spent together, in good and bad. They are codependent and they have good moments because they have to in order to cope, but they still despise each other and their marriage is toxic more than anything else.
Specific warnings included in the notes at the end of the chapter. If you've read the work tags you should be fine, but there are some faint 'themes' that haven't been specified, so if you feel like you need to make sure then please take a look below!
"Maybe you'll get her to wake up," he says in way of an explanation, the lines of his mouth tight as he eyes Rose in Romanov's arms. The toddler just blinks curiously up at the owner of the new arms around her.
It wasn't all that bad. Cleaning up made him feel more human. It felt good, wiping away the sweat and grime from his skin. He just wished he could wipe away his injuries along with the dirt.
"Yeah," she replies and shovels some of the asparagus and lemon sauce from her plate and into her mouth. Tony watches her eat and takes a sip from the wine the staff had poured in his and Rick's glasses. Pinot Noir. An excellent choice to go with the duck breast they are having.
"Yup," he replies. "ETA two minutes, Captain Handsome." He hears Steve sputtering a little, mostly from exasperation, and can't quite contain his snicker.
Tony nods. Rick is leaving to work then, and is just coming down to give Rosie to Tony. The engineer gets up and walks to the living room where the elevator is. As he passes one of the sofas the elevator pings and the doors slide open.
"Yes, and his glasses with FRIDAY in them." Jim smiled a little, then sobered and glanced at Steve over his shoulder. "He also has a tracking implant in him. Two, actually. FRIDAY's working on triangulating his location as we speak, but so far it's not looking too good."
Tony, JARVIS and their group of prisoners have almost reached the exit, when Tony hears footsteps coming their way. From behind them.
The only near normal people attending his wedding were a few beta couples. There were only a few of those, since upper class functions were often times reserved only for the alphas of the families, as they were seen as the best you could get. And where there were alphas, there were omegas. Or at least in the world where Tony lived in. Rhodey was also at the wedding, but Tony hadn't seen the young alpha in a while now.
So, yeah, I'm not a doctor, but I tried to go for some level of credibility. I'm really into realistic writing and I often research some stuff way too thoroughly than I probably should, but I don't know if it was enough for what little medical mumbo jumbo I wrote for this chapter. I hope you enjoyed reading regardless!
"Good afternoon, Cap. What brings you to my humble abode?" Rogers rolls his eyes at Tony's antics, since Tony's abode is anything but humble, much like the whole tower.
"Shut up," Tony snaps, standing up to bring the book into Rick's line of sight. "You know that's not what I meant. It's by
Tony decided — banged the driver's side of the van hastily once everyone was in, the doors still partially open as Luis struggled to pull them closed. Tony lurched backwards on the floor, sliding down as the driver stepped on it and the car took off. He wanted to yell in frustration when they begun gaining speed, his odds worsening by the second.
Their move went on without any hiccups, all done and finished in one day. Rick had packed up their shared study and bedroom, where as Tony'd packed everything from the kitchen and the nursery, as well as his own room. He'd long since taken residence in one of the guest rooms in their penthouse apartment, preferring the privacy because of his night terrors whenever possible. Some nights Rick wanted him to sleep with him in their bedroom, either to have sex or just clutch Tony against his chest to cover the engineer in his scent. Some alpha urge, he was sure. The mornings after a cuddle session were usually good, both of them lounging relaxedly in bed before they had to leave for work or go take care of their daughter, talking about whatever was going on around at work or at home, either both or the other flipping through a tablet or a cellphone as they did. They continued on with the habit in their new apartment in the tower too, although Tony still slept in his own room most nights.
"I know you are," Steve replied, forcing his voice to loose the sharp edge it had adopted, "But Rhodey—
"Yeah, yeah," Tony replies him, shaking the alpha's hand off and walking back to the common floor's kitchen. He grabs a paper towel and starts mopping up the coffee he'd spilt earlier.
"It is so painfully obvious," he told Tony, pushing the tip of the metal baton into Tony's chest uncomfortably. Accusingly. "Of course you would be selfish enough to love him and to wish him for yourself. And only you would be egoistical enough to delude yourself into thinking that the Captain harbored anything other than disdain for you."
so, this story WILL be completed if any of you are still wondering, either with 9 or 10 chapters in total, depending on how long the conclusion or the epilogue end up being. i already have ch 7 ready, just in need of editing, while chapter 8 and 9 are still partially in the making, so let's hope you don't have to wait as long for the next update :D
Tony stares at him, eyes wide. He scoffs. "Like hell I will! I'm already wearing a damn ring for fuck's sake." He dearly hopes that Rose is in too deep of a sleep to wake up to hearing her parents yelling at each other, especially with the amount of swearwords Tony's utilizing.
"You're a doctor!" Rhodey was saying, his voice coming from the speakers by the wall, when Steve tuned back into the interrogation. "You swore an oath, didn't you.
"Okay, so that's a no then," Tony agreed. Dina smiled faintly at him. Then she glanced at her wristwatch and stood up.
He was glad that she hadn't driven it away by herself, in any case. She was safe at home at the moment, with Happy to keep her company. Jim supposed they both needed it right now — the soothing presence of a friend. What Jim needed right now was very different — he needed to crack the case.
"Are you sure about that, Stark?" Ezekiel asked, as if sensing his conflicted thoughts. "I'm not sure when Hammer will be amenable to feed and water you otherwise."
"Yes, you damn well will, omega. I will not see my only son become one of those promiscuous wenches." He yanks at Tony's hand until he's looking at Howard again. Then he slaps him.
"Sure," the other man replied as Marco walked over to the twin bed that Tony wasn't attached to. He sat down and met Tony's gaze.
Tony chewed on the vegetables in his mouth before answering. His bruised jaw ached at the movement, but he was also famished so it was worth it. "Hey, I'm not judging. I know what it's like to get stabbed in the back by your own board. I'm just stating a fact."
"We'll start off easy," Ezekiel said, presenting the crop to Tony. He walked back around, standing behind Tony. Tony braced himself.
It was an all too familiar face; arched eyebrows, straight nose and harsh blue eyes. Tony remembered seeing those eyes last just moments before their owner had fallen to their death.
," she said, and when she didn't continue half a second later, Steve decided she was too slow and that action needed to be taken.
Ezekiel had now rounded back to stand in front of Tony, and so the engineer raised his eyes to look up at him. Ezekiel was watching him as well.
The next time Tony kisses Steve, is a few weeks after the HYDRA raid. Rick is away, they are alone in the common floor living room and Tony's a little tipsy from good wine. He clambers into Steve's lap and seals their mouths together.
"Slipped in the damn shower and banged my face against the faucet." He ponders for half a second whether his explanation had been too long, too detailed to pass as the truth, but relaxes when Clint's face morphs into a sympathetic expression of pain.
Tony raised his arms up before anyone could touch him. "Hey, whoa, nope, I'm really not—" he cried out when the bodyguard grabbed his arm and twisted it,
"Get me something to gag him with. He'll alert everyone in this shitty motel with that racket," Becker said to Marco. Tony looked up at him and saw the hesitant look on his face. He glanced down at Tony as if he was weighing his choices. "Marco," Becker called impatiently, and Marco sighed.
Steve takes the piece of art gingerly, bringing it near his face for closer examination. His eyes stray briefly to Tony, before landing on the toddler in his lap.
"They are fine, they just got released yesterday morning. You're the one that's been stuck in the damn hospital bed," Tony snaps, and notices that his vision is blurring and that his lungs are burning. He sets the plastic cup back on the side table. "I fucking hate you," he hisses and buries his face in Steve's neck, gasping as he tries not to start screaming -- or worse, crying -- scenting furiously and inappropriately as he embraces the other man. He feels Steve answer in kind, holding Tony tightly against himself and scenting his hair and exposed left ear, and unconsciously scent marking him by rubbing fingers against his neck. Tony knows that he should pull away, and he knows that Steve knows the same, but right now he doesn't care. Neither of them do.
"I've got nothing today," Rogers replies, finally having taken a seat himself and begun demolishing his huge pile of food.
He did it again, and Tony screamed into his gag. Once more, and he choked and whined when Becker dragged the belt across his back after the blow. Above him, Becker was outright panting, at that point.
With that, he carelessly let go of his jaw and stepped back from him. "He's clean. Knock him out and load him up. He needs to still see the Doctor before we can deliver him to his new owners."
It takes a while, but they finally return to the tower red-eyed and tired to the bone, Tony carrying the child asleep in his arms as he steps out of the elevator.
The doors at the front opened and slammed closed, and two sets of footsteps moved to the back doors. They were promptly popped open. Becker's hand let go of Tony's neck and he coughed, gulping in air.
Rick had just sat through the entire ordeal, not moving a muscle as he had watched their daughter running around, amusement evident on his face, and now he was patiently listening to Rosie's eager description of her latest play, which consisted of astronauts, princesses and the stuffed leopard Clint had gotten her. The beta was really hell-bent on spoiling Tony's kid.
Tony smiled strainedly at him. "And last time I heard about you, you were still in prison. Pleasant stay?"
The moment their feet touched the ground, Steve rammed his shield against them. He pinned the shape against a wall behind them, crowding close to them, and listened to their squawk.
Something clattered by his left ear and he turned his head to look at it. The woman had dropped a small chip into the metallic container. She stood by it, wiping down her tweezers.
Then the belt struck his ass. Tony froze beneath Becker, and Becker seemed to take that as an invitation to continue. He hit him three more times, holding Tony down by his hair as he flinched away.
Steve felt nauseated at thought and lifted his gaze from the brass table in front of him, eyeing his teammates to distract himself. He'd just delivered the bad news and paused for a moment to let them sink in.
"Come in," Hammer replied, and Bates pushed in. Tony stumbled in after him, since the man's hand was curled around the chain of Tony's cuffs, tugging him along.
Rick lifts his half-empty glass at Tony. "Happy anniversary," he congratulates again, and downs the wine. Tony grabs his own glass and does the same. He places it, now empty, on top of the spotless tablecloth. Rick's chair scrapes the floor as he gets up, then walks up to Tony. Tony doesn't turn to look.
He let out a startled sound when Bates lifted him up, and tried to twist away when the bodyguard pushed his arms in so that the chain got caught in the hook. Bates let him down and Tony was left half-suspended, his chest pressed uncomfortably against the pillar while his toes barely touched the floor.
"Does that include you?" Rick asks, leaning slightly forward. Tony can sense the alpha's possessive side firing up, and he opts for not answering the question.
This contract is legally binding to both parties, ALPHA RICHARD TERRENCE DARROW and OMEGA ANTHONY EDWARD STARK, as well as to their legal guardians, ALPHA CHESTER RUDOLPH DARROW and ALPHA HOWARD ANTHONY WALTER STARK, respectively. If either party breaks the clauses made in this contract, the deal shall be broken off and redone in favor of the party innocent of breaking the clauses. The rights negotiable in the new contract would be the ownership of the
As soon as the HYDRA agents are visible, Clint tackles the first one to the ground. The man yelps, unsuspecting, and his companion tries to grab Clint. Tony blocks his arms with a well-controlled
"Oh, you love it," Rick taunts, like he always does when he gets Tony's body to play against him, and thrusts against the omega again. He does it for the third time, now with strong hands holding Tony's hips in place, and Tony groans, knees going a little weak. No, he doesn't love it, he
Tony's throat tightens up again, and luckily it's Barton that hurries to answer, "He's still under, but he's fine."
"What the—" Beard, or Becker apparently, started, raising his eyes from Tony's to look at the others. Tony squirmed faintly against his iron grip; his lungs were beginning to burn.
And really, it's ridiculously pathetic how much better he instantly feels when Steve steps up behind him, cups his shoulder in one of his big hands while the other halts his hands that are fumbling with the coffee maker. Ever since Steve went missing and came back, it seems as if the captain cares less and less about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to Tony, as long as the omega is fine with it.
"You know me?" Tony asks, "I'm flattered. Sorry I can't say the same. You see, old dusty alphas seem to always slip my mind."
Flying to the edge of the city took considerably less time than traveling there by any other means of transportation. Steve had hitched a ride on the War Machine armor, hanging onto Rhodey's shoulders as they flew over to where FRIDAY had received the signal last.
"Whose fault was it?!" Ezekiel sounded angry now. He electrocuted Tony right after his question, not giving him time to recover. "Whose fault was it?!"
It had come from an abandoned industrial hall that to Steve resembled some type of a factory. When him and Rhodey made their way to it, however, Rhodes' scans confirmed the building disappointingly empty. They had hastily landed near the entrance.
"Is there anything we can do?" Steve asks, seemingly recovered from the revelation that is Tony's premarital agreement. He still looks angry, but a lot more calm than a moment ago. Tony bites his lip.
His heartbeat stuttered when Ezekiel finally stopped moving, standing still behind Tony's back, right in his blind spot. He couldn't suppress his flinch when a large hand touched the skin there.
"I see. Although, you seem pretty stressed about it," he adds, questioning, and turns his head minutely to eye the slight rise of a a tendon by the side of Tony's neck. Tony just shrugs, although he must admit that his stress levels must be through the roof for Rick to notice the change from the usual. The mating bond urging him to tend to and reassure Tony must be driving him nuts by now.
Marco sighed again, looking somewhat fed up with the conversation. "Whatever, man." He bent down to dig through the duffel back he'd earlier set down by the wall. He pulled out a wide, sturdy-looking zip tie and started walking towards Tony.
Together, Steve and Bruce bully Tony into taking a nap on the sofa in the common floor living room, and when Tony wakes up it's to Rosie's exited chatter about her day at the preschool. She's holding hands with Natasha, who had been previously tasked with picking her up, and is looking straight at Steve with bright eyes as the alpha crouches before her tiny form. Tony watches with sleep-blurred eyes as Steve picks her up and hears him shush her, until they are kneeling before his face where he lies on the couch.
With Becker distracted from tormenting him at the moment, Tony dared to turn his attention to his handcuffs. They were standard issue with a double lock, which meant that Tony should be able to rid himself of them with the bobby pin in his pocket. Becker had tightened the zip tie as taut as it would go, so he would probably have to pick both cuffs rather than just one in order to get away. It would increase the risk of him getting caught in the midst of it, but it was still his best shot at freeing himself.
"Pass me the hash browns, then," he said. Hammer eyed him for a moment, but indicated for Bates to serve Tony some.
"Then why do they call you the Merchant of Death? Why do they hate you? Why were the Sokovia Accords ever proposed?" Ezekiel stepped to stand in front of him again. "I thought you agreed with them. You were one of those who signed, yes?"
He clears his throat and lets his helmet retract. He waits until all of them are on the move, except for Bruce who is staying behind as technical support and backup if needed, and takes a spot by Steve's right. "It'll go alright," he says after a moment.
So, note that this chapter is pure hurt. It gets pretty bad. This means that you should maybe re-check the tags for this fic. I'll also add some additional ones into the notes below.
"Hi," is what Romanov greets him with, coming near and taking a peek at Rose. Tony's still a little wary around the assassin, her lies still fresh in his mind, but the enormous, and more than shocking, enthusiasm the alpha has shown towards Tony's little girl has warmed Tony up for her. So, still a little stressed, but deciding it's the time to let go of the past, he pries the small hands off his neck and tentatively hands the kid to Romanov. The small break in the alpha's otherwise impeccable façade is mesmerizing, and she accepts Tony's ultimate show of trust with wide eyes.
"Come on, baby, have a drink." He brings a water bottle to her mouth, one hand swiping dark strands of hair out of her face as he tries to prevent Rose from drying up. You never know with kids. One moment they are fine, running around the park with their friends, and the next they are in the throes of heat exhaustion because they didn't notice how thirsty they were in the middle of their game. Tony doesn't want that to be the reason they'd have to stop their day trip to Central Park. "You want a snack, Rose?"
Tony blinked, paling slightly as realization was beginning to dawn on him. "I promise, Jarvis." With that Jarvis had pulled him into a tight embrace and Tony found himself returning it just as fiercely.
He sits near Bruce by the table and the beta glances at him apologetically. Tony decides that striking up a conversation is the best way to show forgiveness, even though he really isn't sure which one of them should be the one apologizing. His sense of right and wrong seems to have been skewed from the get-go, as Howard, and later on Rick seem to always remind him.
"Nat, Clint and I are leaving on a mission in a couple days," he says in a low voice, and Tony frowns at him. "Nat found another Hydra base."
It was bright outside, he could tell that much even with his eyes closed. The sunshine came from up high, so Tony presumed it was currently around noon. For a big chunk of the hour that they had driven they hadn't made any turns, proceeding straight forward with great speed, if the low-frequency noise permeating the car had been anything to go by. They had been on the highway for a long time, before taking a turn to another road, this one bumpier, less smooth, perhaps a gravel road. Soon after that, twenty minutes or so, the car had stopped.
Tony's first heat hits him the fall he's sixteen. It's his second year at MIT, the first ever omega to get to attend thanks to his Father's influence and Tony's undeniable intelligence.
, he thought, attempting to stave off his impending panic. He felt something warm trickling down his cheek, Obie's voice ringing in his ear.
"Dear, please take a seat," Maria was ushering him into a chair and gesturing for Rick to also have a seat near Alpha Darrow. Howard and Chester were both seated in big armchairs facing each other, when everyone else was sitting in smaller chairs, accentuating their positions as the heads of their families. Tony wanted to scoff, but he knew better.
"Cap's doing just fine," Tony bites out, spoon digging into his dessert as he savors the taste. "He sometimes helps out with Rosie, as do the rest of the team. Why?" He knows exactly why Rick's asking, but if Rick's going to go down this path, he might as well work for it.
Tony didn't react to the touch, but he turned his head away from the blueprints, staring at the wallpaper in favor of it. His hands, which were cuffed behind his back, tightened into fists and the chain attached to the cuffs
"You can blame only yourself for this," Becker told him. He leaned closer and spoke with a low voice. "When you're less out of it, I'll make you pay for that little stunt, just like I promised." With that, he left Tony by the wall and wobbled back over to check on Marco.
"An oversight, on your part," Ezekiel said, rubbing it in, "One that I was relying on, since I knew how cocky you are." He grabbed the chair and righted Tony again. Tony grunted as his bruises were jostled. "However, your cockiness isn't what I meant to discuss with you. Captain America is."
Tony knew he could rationalize that, knew that he could come up with a dozen of reasons, but he couldn't right now, not now when he was dizzy with pain and embarrassed beyond measure. So, right now he didn't want to think about it. He tried to pull his head back, but Ezekiel's hold was tight and firm. "Stop, I—"
Tony's mouth turns with his anger. "Because this is how I fucking cope, Rogers," he snaps. "This is the reality I live in! And no matter how much I want to have a fit or bawl my eyes out, you know what? I can't do that because I have responsibilities! I have a
," he points at Tony, "you know that I have no other heir for the Stark Industries. How am I supposed to train you now?!"
"...Hammer," he gritted out, turning slowly to face the stairs that the other man was stood on top of. The man smiled down at him, spreading his arms in welcome.
"Can you blame me?" Tony snapped back, willing his weak muscles to work so he could heave himself up and lean against the wall. Before he was halfway there however, Becker had walked over and pulled him away. He let go of him once he was in the middle of the patch of floor between the door and the nearest bed.
The fingers leave him, and Tony bites down on his lip to keep from whining at the loss. Instead, he makes one final attempt to buck out of Rick's hold, a scream building up inside his lust-addled brain.
"It really doesn't," Tony replies curtly and moves out of Rick's reach. He walks towards the dining room where the staff is finishing up setting the table. Rick likes to indulge on special occasions like this and have professional cooks come over and prepare an amazing, Michelin restaurant level meal to celebrate whatever they feel like celebrating.
He was hauled up, pressed tightly against Becker's chest with his hand still over his mouth and dragged over the cracked parking lot. When they reached him, Marco was unlocking a door to the building. It was a dingy motel with two floors and a bright neon sign, shining its blue and red light overhead.
Tony watches Steve's pupils dilate slightly at the mental image, but in the end the chivalrous captain in him seems to win the battle. He sighs, hands dropping to his sides.
"That the only thing about him you find yourself unable to resist?" Bruce asks coyly, and man, the beta has definitely been spending too much time around Tony.
It takes Rosie about ten minutes to solve her puzzle, and by the time Tony has already eaten and is typing away another report. She helps Steve put back the puzzles before wandering back over to Tony.
"Missed you, too," Rosie mumbles in a whiny tone against Steve's neck, and Tony decides it's time for an intervention.
"Get up," Bates repeated, reaching over to remove the chain from Tony's leather cuffs. He put it in his pocket and pulled Tony's hands down, closer to the rest of Tony's body from where they had been reaching around the pole.
to submit to someone and let someone take care of him, that he has to clamp a hand over his mouth, lest he say something else as damning or worse, start bawling. Which are both equally likely, at the moment.
"What if the intel was wrong? What if we get captured again? Or, what if only one of us gets left behind?"
Two and half years after their wedding, December 17, 1991, Howard and Maria Stark die in a car accident, alongside with Edwin Jarvis, long-term butler of the Stark family. Tony spends the following week mostly in bed, even managing to worry Rick to some degree, despite their more than hostile relations.
"You're up early this morning," Rogers comments, moving over to grab the juice from the fridge. His shirt clings to his back with sweat and he's slightly out of breath. A morning run, then.
Weirdly enough, Ezekiel didn't continue. He had also stopped pacing, and the horrible trepidation it caused was what urged Tony to speak, "You did," he agreed, feeling sweat beading near his hairline.
"Why do you have to be so difficult all the time? Amanda's omega bitch, Carl, is such a good sport. I hear he actually listens to his alpha," he tells Tony as his other hand moves up to unbutton the omega's shirt collar.
Becker breathed harshly for a while longer, but eventually both of his hands left Tony. The tension bled out of Tony's shoulders.
When he reached the door, Marco turned to look at him and Tony felt sweat prick the back of his neck. His first irrational thought was that Marco had somehow read his mind. That wasn't the case however; Tony watched as Marco brought his finger up to his lips and his eyes widened as the other man pulled out a gun from his duffel bag.
Seeing his three teammates all battered up and in varying states of consciousness feels just as bad as it sounds, if not worse. Clint, who is sitting up on his medical cot, sports a collection of bruises and cuts on the left side of his head, and apparently banged his head hard enough to cause his left hearing aid to start failing. Natasha, who is lying in her cot unconscious and under sedation, since she had been operated just a few hours ago. Something about shrapnel, was what Tony had been told, and he'd shuddered at that, the ghost of his arc reactor twinging in his chest.
"Thanks, pumpkin," Tony tells her, appreciatively, and Rose turns back to Barton so that they can return to their play, grabbing his hand. Her chest is puffed out with pride that she had managed to find such fine gifts. Tony smiles gently at her back and lets the rock fall back to the ground; if he kept every rock and stick and pine cone the kid gave him, he'd already have a roomful. Rogers looks unsure what to do, and Tony laughs at him.
He listened as Becker stumbled over, collapsing on his knees by Tony's side when he was close enough. He took the gun from him and threw it away, along with any chances Tony might have had of escaping that day.
"A leopold!" Rose near screams from where she's sitting on Barton's shoulders, pointing towards the feline in the exhibit area. Tony has to stifle a chuckle at the toddler's expense.
“Long time no see, Tones,” Jim says with a laugh, patting Tony on the back. “Now let go of me before I choke.”
He tried to sit up but his arms wouldn’t hold his weight. He looked to the side, to Jessica, but she was still unconscious from her fall.
Steve forced the tension out from his limbs and closed his eyes, phantom breath leaving his body in a rush.
Tony made a decision and released the back of the suit, stepping out and around to face Steve in his undersuit. He circled a finger at the arc reactor and nodded at Steve. “Try it now.”
Tony huffed a laugh at that and Steve counted it a small step forward. He watched as Tony picked at the steering wheel, eyes focused on nothing in particular. Steve waited. He would always wait.
The hand at his waist lowered to pinch at his ass and Tony yelped, leaning back to give Steve a mock scandalized look. Steve chuckled and Tony felt the vibrations run through him. This was real. Steve was real. And he was solid. And he
Steve blinks and suddenly he’s in a bedroom. The décor looks different, almost clinical. There’s a simple wooden wardrobe, a desk covered in books and paper, and a plain, narrow bed with simple white sheets. There is a schoolboy’s uniform hung outside the wardrobe and a single poster on the wall at the foot of the bed. Steve recognizes it as one of his old propaganda posters.
“Oh, my God, Steve,” Tony rasped out, hands clenching on his tensed thighs. “Are you sure you’re not reading off a teleprompter projected from my brain?”
racing through his veins. And he hadn’t been drinking much at all ever since he and Steve had gotten togeth—
“How much… convincing do you need?” Tony asked in a husky voice that went straight down to Steve’s already tight pants. “Did you want me to hold myself back? Or,” Tony’s fingertips walked across the table until they were just inches from Steve’s hands. His back was arching beautifully and the tent in his pants was pressed into the edge of the table. “Do I need to work harder? Spread myself a little more?”
Tony stood still for several silent moments then huffed in amusement and made to climb into his bed. “Virtuous son of a bitch,” he muttered. He rolled around pulling the blankets and covers to and fro before shoving the pillows behind his back to settle on as he looked at Steve.
s rang through the comms at their Captain’s order and they ranged out around the Colonel into position.
Steve smiled back, and they spent the rest of the evening thinking up increasingly ridiculous activities to do.
The Captain, Steve, looked so much lonelier without his friend Barnes to ground him. It had been a decision Barnes himself had made and T'Challa had been all too glad to provide the facilities – and the security – for the cryosleep.
Good. Steve didn’t need that this morning either. He chewed on his toast, cut into bite sized pieces. At least his teeth were in decent working order, even if nothing else in this old body of his was.
The words swirled through Tony’s mind and Tony almost laughed out loud as the loose pieces clicked slowly into place, one by one. What was the Certainty Two had told him? Anything was possible. Him, a man of science, dealing in
And Tony was not going to negate Certainty One by thinking of soulmates. Dammit, Spengler. He rubbed at his throat and thought of science, with logic.
Steve shook himself back into control and pushed away with effort, earning himself a silly pout. He had plans and desperate rutting was not one of them.
Steve fell backwards in shock and stared down at the hand he’d pulled away. He looked back up at Tony.
Tony had brought along a bottle of good wine from his private collection and then drank most of it himself among the revelry. When that dusty bottle had emptied, he had gone on to find more swill to guzzle.
No calls came his way, as dictated by the lockdown, but he had JARVIS read him the prodding messages from Clint and Natasha, who were still following leads with Maria on the kid. Bruce was still Hulk. Thor was still AWOL. Tony just wanted
“I don’t want our first time to be like this,” Tony said, this time trying for something that was a little bit of the truth.
And as he watched on, his breath coming harder and harder through what were probably broken ribs, he thought he heard the whine of a repulsor.
get his mouth on that patch of skin that had been calling to him since he'd gotten here. Stark made a noise of protest and it was easy enough for Steve to pin down the one free hand that tried to tug him back up. Steve was going to be the one doing the handling today.
He shook his head. There was no point in dwelling on it. The train was wrecked and miles behind, and Timely, evacuated or not, was safe for the moment. He called out to Stark then broke into a slow run.
“Or maybe,” came the testy reply, “we were just made to feel like this physically, and our own minds decided who we want to feel it with.”
He almost thought he could see Timely in the distance but he knew he was still at least five miles out, if he was reading the patches of drying bushes and grasses around the single rail line correctly. After another half a mile, the sun disappeared behind clouds and his horse still hadn't caught up to him.
Stark didn't miss a beat, a sly smile of his own curled on his lips beneath his bushy mustache. "Why Sheriff, my dashing hero, ravishing your damsel right here and now? Who am I to refuse such an offer." He finished by wrapping his legs around Steve and pulling them flush together. Steve dropped to his elbows and pressed his cheek against Stark's, groaning at the pressure on his cock.
On the one hand, they were out in the middle of nowhere on top of the rail line with the sun still flickering through the clouds. Someone might have noticed the explosions – the townspeople perhaps – and riders could come by them any minute. On the other hand, Fisk's men shouldn't be a problem anymore and neither should the explosives the locomotive had been hauling. They would be able to feel an approaching train through the vibrations in the iron and it should be easy enough to cut Stark's wrist free in time. And Stark was bound and vulnerable and there was a patch of tanned skin just peeking at him just above Stark's pants, just enough to see a dark trail of hair…
It was just past noon and the sun was beating down onto the dusty land. Steve walked on with only his hat and a small hip flask keeping him from drying out.
The resultant flood of excess unanimated slime had slid to the ground with gravity and washed over the pavement into the trenches. The Anti-Slime platoon was spraying Anti-Slime Slime over anything red and oozing. After another fifteen seconds, everything that remained on the ground was a neutral grey. The platoon fiddled with their tanks and then started sucking up the slime from the ground.
“It was very nice,” Tony said, nodding. His tongue darted out to flick at Steve’s thumb. “Could have lasted more than half a second, though.”
“I had a good time,” Steve said. “With the team, with you,” he raised another hand to cup at Tony’s cheek, “and it would have been my choice to stay, even as a ghost.”
They sat in silence and Steve let Tony absorb it. He’d meant it. He wanted to stay. He was going to stay. With Tony.
“It’s not my fault if your bedmates happen to find my bed more likeable than yours,” the blond said sharply. “Or what secrets you choose to tell them. Or that my technology is the next big breakthrough rather than your cute little energy plug.”
Tony closed his eyes against the peaceful sight before him. He didn’t know what the after-life was, but this couldn’t be it. He opened his eyes again and reached forward to wake Steve.
There was a shuffling beneath him and it took him a few precious seconds to realize he’d fallen on top of someone who had already been laid out on the cushions. He rolled around and braced himself over the person, trying to see past his own shadow from the soft light of the kitchen behind him. He glimpsed a head of dark hair. Jess? Second surprise, but at least Jess wasn’t hard on the eyes and wasn’t a Skrull this time…
that wasn’t Tony run its hands over him. When the hands reached his hips, he swept his shield at it and staggered backwards. Behind him, he could hear Bruce speaking rapidly with JARVIS. Tony had to be alive.
When they’d finally Trapped the last animal at sundown, it had started to snow. The team had had a happy and rowdy dinner but Steve had stepped out to the Iron Man landing pad halfway to watch over the whitening city. Steve may be dead and he couldn’t eat, but he could still admire the scenery. He just wished he could pick up a pencil to capture it.
“Oh Christ, Romanoff,” Tony sputters out, hands thrown up. “You know he’s probably going to end up throwing me out the window.”
“What if he says no,” Steve says in a low voice, rubbing lightly at his abdomen. “He’s had just as many opportunities as I've had to do something and he hasn’t.”
After going over his ‘experiment’ with a clear mind, Tony came to the conclusion that whatever the sex whammy was, it definitely messed with his intelligence at least a little because the planning that had gone into the entire project had been so embarrassingly inept he decided to delete it all (soft delete—JARVIS kept a backup and Bruce definitely had a copy. Tony also kept a copy of the security footage of inside the workshop at the end of the twenty-four hours which he may or may not have watched numerous times when Steve was away on long missions with Wilson). That Steve had apparently gotten himself off about sixty times in the twenty-four hours was also a piece of data he hoarded with glee.
Something like a whine escaped from Steve’s throat and his hips shimmied against Tony’s making Tony gasp. Steve was fully hard again; Hallelujah, they were halfway there.
No sooner had the words left his mouth that his arc reactor glowed bright. And through the single opening of the Containment Unit, the spirits, the soul remnants flowed out in moans and screeches and slammed into Tony’s chest like a sledgehammer.
“Just get a room!” Clint yelled over the shared comms, and they all laughed, Tony chuckling weakly at the implication.
“No,” Steve said quickly, shaking his head once. “I can do that. For you.” He looked at his gloved hands briefly, then removed the gloves and tucked them into his belt. Hands now bare, he raised one, fingers hovering an inch from the surface of the arc reactor, then looked back up at Tony, asking permission. Tony turned to perch a knee onto the seat and shifted forward that last inch, letting Steve’s fingers sink into him.
Tony shook the light of the Trap from his eyes and brought up the camera diagnostics on his HUD. All fine, but it hadn’t filtered out the light. Weird. “I’m fine, Steve. JARVIS helped.” He looked around at the aftermath of the deblobbing.
Steve hummed then took off his gloves and reached through the bars, miming for the deck. Tony handed the cards over and continued to recount his story, watching Steve’s fingers play over the curling edges of the cards as he shuffled.
“I wanted to ask you something,” Steve’s hesitant voice came after a pause. “Um.” Silence. Tony raised an eyebrow, waiting. “But first tell me what your experiments have turned up on this condition of ours.”
After his nightmare of the fight with the Skull and the Cube, Steve had gone to Director Fury with a request for information regarding the Cube. The dream had been the first time Steve realized that although the Skull had been taken from the Earth, the Cube, something of such immense power, had remained. Tony hadn’t known anything about it, and neither had Clint, Bruce or Natasha, and Thor had still been away for the holidays. So he’d gone to Director Fury, who had known something but he hadn’t shared it with Steve. Steve had then asked after the Valkyrie, the bombs, his shield, his body, and Fury honestly hadn’t known anything about any of it.
He stood, and pressed himself to Tony, letting Tony’s naked back brush against the buckles and zips of his uniform. He gripped at Tony’s ass and kneaded at the tight flesh.
The door behind him opened and closed silently. Steve kept still, listening to the sound of footsteps across the plush carpet. The weight, the tread; it was definitely Tony. He’d not seen Tony in so long, each of them having been too busy with work, but he would always recognize the signs of Tony’s presence. He waited until Tony was just a few feet away from the desk before turning the chair around, dramatic.
was also something I’ve considered for a long time. This“ —he squeezed at Tony’s hand, hoping the armor would let Tony feel it, hoping Tony would understand the intimacy of the gesture— “was something I’ve also wanted. Still want. You and me.
. He was getting to know this man outside of Howard’s influence and he wanted more. And he hated that he wanted more. Steve should come first; Steve needed to move on to his next life.
Steve’s knee had gotten worse over the past couple of days. The fluctuating fall weather was not doing his creaking joints any favors let alone the sprain in his knee.
Tony bit back something that sounded almost like a moan and Steve’s hands jerked a little in surprise, pushing. Tony tipped back with the movement and he opened his eyes to stare back at Steve, equally surprised. “You can move me?”
Tony slapped at Steve again. “If this is a dream,” Tony said, his voice starting to shake, “then I want out. Now.”
That seemed enough to alleviate the worry; their shoulders dropped as the two men finally relaxed from their combative state. Still, they'd walked in three men and only two were before him.
and Tony Stark did not succumb to things he could not define. His coherence was leaving him quickly with every glimpse of Steve’s flushed skin. He bit hard at his tongue, using the pain to focus his thoughts away from imagining how best to give a blowjob in armor. Steve was breathing heavily, Tony could tell from his vantage point. Breathing heavily and staring directly up at Tony with naked desire.
He couldn’t quite remember, but he knew he missed it almost painfully. And he was going to try and fix this broken thing between them.
Steve started putting away the cold foodstuffs first. Vegetables in the vegetable drawer. Meat in the freezer. Milk in the door. Butter on the tray. Eggs in the eggrack.
Steve’s mind ground to a halt at the words. He drew back and stared intently into Tony’s eyes. “What did you say happened?”
a teenager. He was sure it wasn't physiologically possible. He also didn’t think he could want Steve any more than he did right this moment. He needed Steve so much his dick was literally aching for it.
“Did you want to pick up my resignation in person?” Tony’s modulated voice came through the darkness.
“Do you remember when I used to wander Avengers Mansion at night?” Steve started to say, hoping he was going in the right direction. “Do you remember when we used to talk into the night? It started there. You helped me relax into the future. And you helped me relax at the end of the day when I couldn’t sleep. That old two-seater with the gold trim?” Steve traced its outline with his hands in the air. “We talked a lot in that seat. We fell asleep there a lot as well. Together. It started there, it started from there, and it never stopped until—until last year. Until Extremis.”
That no one outside of Tony’s immediate area of about two hundred feet could see him had been a huge relief to Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD and PLASM, who had not wanted a national furore over the appearance of Captain America’s ghost. It had certainly made Steve’s increasingly extensive nightly wanderings easier to a degree, if he went alone, but it hadn’t stopped Tony from running rather exhaustive tests on him all the same.
He’d been doing so well with Steve—with their little blossoming relationship. He’d been keeping his hands to himself. Keeping it above the belt.
Pepper turns to Steve and Steve swallows his harsh tone when he sees the tears in her eyes. He doesn’t know if they’re tears of frustration or anger but it’s probably both and he feels the need to apologize.
"I'll go see him," T'Challa said, cutting off the increasingly panicked speech. He frowned as he parsed the Captain's words. "I have my own jet—"
Natasha sits back and narrows her eyes at Tony. Tony fidgets in his seat in a manner she will never admit out loud to be endearing.
Thor guffaws in amusement. “Though our good Captain presents as the ideal Midgardian image of masculinity, he would be the mother.”
So Tony watched Steve write out reports all night, appreciating the company, and eventually he ended up just watching Steve sleep in his chair, neck bent over the back, hands folded over his stomach. It really didn’t look comfortable. Honestly, there was plenty of space in Tony’s cell to share.
He stood and nodded at his well-trained soldiers as they put the room to order again, scrubbing out the worst of the blood and brain from the chair and the floor.
His muscles are tearing as he pulls and shakes against the solid grip of the cold but he can’t move. The ice in contact with him melts at his exertion but he still can’t get enough leverage to break through.
They spend over an hour chatting over food and drinks and Bruce lets himself relax. He isn’t here for official Avengers business. It’s been peaceful for the past few weeks, with only the odd minor villain holding up jewelry trucks or trying to blow up a building. Small things, on the scale of peace to "robot apocalypse", as Tony puts it.
He reached back to grab his shield and was preparing to signal in Morse at any one of JARVIS’s cameras when Bruce came barrelling through the door at the other end of the workshop. Steve watched as he ran to Tony’s little safe room and emerged with a glowing spare reactor and a large med kit.
Stark frowned didn’t reply. He sat back with another wince, a sign he wasn’t holding to his composure. “No one died this time,” Stark said in a tired voice. “There were a few still in critical when I last checked but everyone is going to make it.”
“I vote we take it to Phase Four,” Bucky says, gloved hand raised, looking around their table. “Try for a final push.”
Tony straightened from where he was lounging against the kitchen counter and sipped at what appeared to be a steaming cup of coffee. He took one last obnoxiously loud slurp then set the cup down and walked around the counter to stand in front of Steve.
From his ice coffin, he sees the Skull drop the Cube and vanish. His shield is by the Cube and he strains against the ice to get at it. They’re still flying towards America and he needs to get the plane away. Now.
century very well because he walked right into another person. The person stumbled and Steve reached out to steady them, having regained his own feet with no trouble. Looking around he realized he’d ended up on Park Avenue near Grand Central.
Steve reached out and held tight onto a flailing, armored wrist. The armor hummed beneath his fingers as it charged with power at the sudden movement. He loosened his grip but kept his hand in place.
, of the people. He could see brighter glows of the souls of his teammates; Natasha, Clint, Thor. Hulk was a giant blur of colors. All of them scattered in the streets of New York, trying to contain the fainter glows that were the remnants of what once was whole. He could see Pepper in Seattle, Happy by her side. Rhodey was in D.C.. They were all glowing with life. The entire planet was glowing with life, some brighter, some disappearing.
After the tenth, twelfth, twentieth, fiftieth time, Steve stopped counting and simply started expecting. It was a common sight for an Avenger to find when wandering around Avengers Mansion: Captain America and Iron Man, curled together on some seating surface, the Captain usually reading or the both of them fast asleep. And after it had been revealed that Iron Man was in fact Tony Stark, sometimes it was Tony Stark sans armor who was curled around a compliant Steve Rogers.
He pulls Tony in around the neck as Tony rubs the back of his head. “Good to see you looking healthy, Tony. Now let’s get beer and bitch about life.”
His part was done. He’d put himself out there. The ball was firmly in Steve’s court now. As if reading his mind, Steve spoke up again after an amiable silence.
Steve turns to see a soldier in modern army gear run toward them around the tombstones. The young man comes to a halt beside Tony with an ecstatic expression and holds out a pen and paper.
Steve rushes forward to pull the young man off of Tony but he falls through, barely keeping his feet. He looks back and sees the young man straddle Tony, clawing at Tony’s chest and arms. Tony screams and pushes weakly at the young man, and Steve leaps forward for a tackle. He lands on top of the young man and watches with mixed sadness and vindictiveness as the body dissolves in a flash of green light. Steve looks around, back at Tony.
mischievous expression. “But if I could just make him die, I wouldn’t need permission to take him.” Its grin widened. “He is mine now.”
“It couldn't be me," Steve said quickly, hoping to diffuse the tension in Tony's shoulders and the tightness in the corners of his eyes. "I took up a guest room after they turned the music off. “I was sleeping, and then you - or someone I thought was you - crawled onto the bed. Onto me.”
