"John. John Watson."
Inside, Sherlock was sitting crossed legged on his own bed in the dark, wide eyed and shifting uncomfortably at John’s presence. John didn’t see what the matter was at first.
And when Sherlock played, he felt the world change. There was no other sound but the sound of the violin. He felt the raw emotion in the music and watched Sherlock's body stretch as he played every note. The faster, more intense parts caused Sherlock to lean into the violin, his entire body leaning into the instrument. He felt the emotion in Sherlock, the passion being played on the strings. Sherlock's eyes were closed and his lips were parted in concentration. John and the rest of the world no longer existed.
He threw himself onto his bed, beating his head against his mattress in pure desperation. Why was he like this? What if other people found out? Greg and Mike had made it clear that the school wouldn’t accept it so even if Sherlock was interested in him romantically, what could they do?
"So, you flirted with her?" John felt himself smile.
“Would you like me to make you some tea?” This made John laugh, a little stronger this time. He watched John push himself by his elbows, bleary eyed.
“We were just talking about Anderson.” Greg said as he grabbed his drink from Mike’s hands..
“Leave him,Greg.”
Sherlock did not come to the exam, which John was not surprised by, but it still put him on edge. The entire exam was filled with John randomly staring off into space, his head filled with other, more pressing matters. This does not matter. John reminded himself. This is not important. He had somehow stumbled from the shower, to his room. Put his pressed cotton shirt against his skin. Breathed. As he walked down the stairs in the dorm, James caught him again. He saidAtHe said nothing to him, which was a relief. John felt as though he were going to cry again at any moment, so when James simply walked past without small talk, John sighed with relief.
A moment, passed, the pitch emptying of people in kit. Sherlock looked at the boys next to him. A joke had passed between them and now they were looking to Sherlock with small smile on their mouth.
"Sure, here" John gave him a black ballpoint, meeting the boy's demands.
“Yes Sir, I was just sick over the weekend so I’m just…recovering.”
“Anderson, go and get John a drink” Mike said suddenly not look to the other man. The way Mike was looking at him put a heavy weight in his stomach.
“Relax Gavin.”
“Is that all you’re gonna have, Sherlock?” Mike asked when he saw the cut-up food on Sherlock’s plate. John saw Sherlock lick his lips anxiously before replying.
It wasn't pleasant to wake up in the middle of the afternoon from an after shag nap, to an armed squadron of special forces busting down the bedroom door and grabbing your naked arse out of bed while they restrained your lover. John was barely able to grab the comforter to wrap around himself before they were ushering him through the apartment in the middle of their group with guns at his back, then down the stairs and out the back door and into an unmarked black van in the alley. He was seated between two men and across from four others as the van drove off silent, efficient, and without a word from anyone. One of the men across from him handed him a set of his own clothes, shoes, and his wallet, all neatly folded and waiting. Mycroft then. Well, probably. This could be bad, or very VERY bad.
"Yes he is quite the match to her isn't he?"
"I can't understand how he doesn't have a million more customers." Lestrade commented absently. "He's got some of the best stuff in town, has new promotional and seasonal items every month or so, he's attentive, polite, the store is always spotless, and to tell you the truth I would pay a lot more than what he asks for, I just don't get it why it's always dead in here."
"I don't know why you're so bitter, Sherlock. Your brother is doing things with his life. You should be proud of him." Sherlock laughed.
"What like denim?" John laughed as he walked towards the intercom, nodding at his sisters own denim jacket.
He wondered if Sherlock simply hated him. Perhaps John was so irritating that the boy couldn't bear to be in the same room as him? As far as he knew, John had done nothing wrong, but judging by what Greg and Mike said, Sherlock was a person who was easily irritated. And, although he tried not to focus on it too much, he found his brain circling thoughts of losing the closest thing to a friend, as well as the face of his mother and whether she would be disappointed in him.
“I don’t think its okay. It matters not if you think it is okay or not”
"And when she runs she doesn't use her arms."
"I thought so. Although I think the prosecco is off brand." They chuckled again and John felt Sherlock glance at him. "I somehow feel that Sour cream and chive pringles are superior."
"John." He replied, steep-ling his hands under his chin and staring off into the distance. John stared at Sherlock, his eyes flickering between the page and the boy. The table was surrounded by shelves either side, so Sherlock must have intentionally picked to sit with John.
“Amazing.”
“He’s my room mate.” And the man nodded, spinning round John’s folder to face him, a large finger pointing to his ‘basic profile page’ which had been collated. John tried not to focus on the fact that there was an information page formed by some random man on him.
“Can you not?” John said, shaking off the feeling of James’ arms around him.
He turned over to see if Sherlock was in bed. When he had fallen asleep, Sherlock had not returned and John didn't hear him come in. Yet Sherlock was there, asleep in his bed, his curls were splayed across the pillow and he seemed too at rest to wake. John didn't know if he ought to wake the sleeping boy, but the second bell did not stir Sherlock.

When John was younger, Harry would often come and get him in the middle of lessons, unannounced. It was occasionally to collect his lunch or money or to take him to an appointment. After a pay day, she would come and get him from the last lesson of the day, an hour early, and together they would go to the supermarket to buy food before their father could get his hands on the cash. John enjoyed those trips, the fruitless and pointless arguments over whether they should get branded bread or store bread. John knew it would be the cheaper option, the logo didn’t matter, but he jokingly caused conflict anyway. It was entertainment for the rather depressing trip, which became even more depressing when they saw how much money they had left for that months gas card.
Curiosity piqued, Sherlock merely nodded politely, but asking him to ignore anything was tantamount to telling someone to try to ignore the sun shining directly in their face. The lights were dimmed, and John emerged from the back and went into the side office in a familiar white coat, a stethoscope around his neck.
"Will you help me take the lid off of this box? It's a present for the Lady Violet, take a peek and tell me if you think she'll like it."
“Shhhh, it’s alright. You’re alright Sherlock. It feels good, doesn’t it? I think I’ve figured out what it is you like so much about this. I can read you like a book right now. It’s not just the intimacy or the attention, it’s the proof of what I feel for you laid out in a way that usually isn’t seen. You’ve always liked it when I get protective, or charge after where you lead, or tell you how brilliant you are, but this, it’s a whole different level isn’t it? You don’t have to be brilliant, or clever, or have an exciting mystery to solve to keep my attention. You just have to lay there quietly, not needing to do anything more than accept what I’m doing, and I’ll just take my time, letting my eyes and fingers and lips linger on you for as long as I can. What you enjoy is being cherished and taken care of by someone you love so much. Right, Sherlock?”
Seeing straight through Sherlock, and to find him as fragile as a butterfly's wing or a snowflake, where to even touch it would destroy it, yet Sherlock's eyes telling him he could, if he wanted to, is a power John really doesn't want to possess. Especially not with the dark beast lingering somewhere nearby, because it would absolutely destroy this, ruin Sherlock and therefore John forever. No, John could never claim the fragile vulnerability Sherlock shows him.
“Ah is this the point where you tell me if I break your brother's heart you will inflict gross personal harm on me?”
"Get back to work Love, and remember that eating and sleeping are necessary if inconvenient requirements for that 'transport' of yours which I am so inordinately fond of to work properly. I'll see if I can get Mycroft to surrender my mobile tomorrow so you can keep me updated on the case alright?"
One blink.
"There's finally a case, Mrs. Hudson, and I can only hope that it isn't boring."
"Mr. Holmes Sir, it's an honor to see you." said the only unarmed officer there, a colonel by his mark of rank who actually saluted Mycroft.
“Her face is bad, Johnny.” Harry had also taken to calling him Johnny, but it was reserved for particularly bad moments. “Swollen. Just to warn you.” And John didn’t have to ask who did it or what happened for he knew. The intricacies didn’t matter to him, whether it was a punch or a bottle, it was the same result in the end. And when he saw his mother’s face, it was one he was eerily aware he was familiar to.
He wondered if Harry would be okay at home. If she would be safe. If dad would try anything when drunk and—-
The stairway to Sherlock's upstairs was as John imagined it: spiral and made of oak wood. There was a large chandelier down the centre of the stairs, which John caught himself staring at with his mouth agape and tiny detailed designs on the banister that followed the case. As they walked up the stairs John glanced at the many pictures that lined the walls, a combination of paintings and prints. At the top of the stairs was a long corridor with 5 doors on each side, a window at its end.

“I’ve had a lot of training.” John said into his drink. Out of the corner of his eye he watched Greg smile a little to Mike.
"Do you not get on?" He asked. Sherlock shrugged and walked behind the piano, which was beside the open door, before pulling out a violin.
“Can we spread into our positions?” The teacher said suddenly, throwing the ball to one of the players. John kept his eyes trained on the ball, but even when it was moving closer and closer to John’s end of the pitch, he could not switch into action. In fact, when the the ball was passed to him, John fumbled with the ball, dropping it in the mud.
“So is chemistry. I just need to learn the polarity and intermolecular force stuff and then I’ll be able to relax.” Greg smiled.
"No." Sherlock replied, turning on his side to face the wall.
“Come on, let’s get going.” And together they helped up a giggling Mike and made their way back across the field.
“John, it’s okay if you and Sherlock are dating or whatever.” Before John could argue, Mike continued. “You just need to keep it private. They’ll kick you both out if they think anything’s going on. They’ve done it before.” John was dumbfounded.
When he opened the door, John was hit by the scent of cigerettes and booze. Inside were about 10 students and, in the furthest corner, sat Greg, Mike and one other person, all hunched around a small table. Mike was the first to see John and becond him over with a smile and waving hand. They were all sitting on a mismatching wooden chairs that wobbled on the uneven floor.
“Why- What do you get out of this?” John asked, half laughing as he mixed the tea. Anderson shrugged and John again questioned the incentive of the boy. It was almost as though he was so desperate to have a connection with someone that he’d take an argument over nothing.
“Uh, no.” He replied and again the pin stripe counterpart was studying him before nodding.
“Hang on John.” He heard Sherlock say. There was a hint of panic in his voice. John tutted. How dare he ask me to hang on after the stress he caused me. John thought as he opened the door.
“You were joined at the hip not that long ago.” John shook his head.
"That's because he's a wanker." Sherlock passed the bottle to John and pulled out a cigarette. "Mike and Anderson and the other one.” He paused, accenting his movements with smoke. “Gavin?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Won't the school have some?"
“What’s happened?” John asked as they walked through the corridor’s to the school’s sign out office. Harry was walking fast, her eyes down. She said nothing, nodding to the lady at the office door and pushing the door out of the building. From behind the gates, John could see a black car, what he assumed was a taxi.
At around 8 o clock the pair decided to head into the old town to get some food. Sherlock was very drunk and occasionally would heave into a bin before continuing to walk. It seemed as though the alcohol had hit him harder than it had he and it meant that John was essentially carrying Sherlock through Brighton’s lanes. It made John wonder how much Sherlock had truly drunk in the past and whether all that champagne consumption had built any resilience. John had been used to the public-school experience, which included drinking hooch and vodka in open fields at the age of 14, students doing A class drugs in lessons and the occasional teacher running a class whilst still drunk. Sherlock’s upbringing, however, had clearly been a very different experience. John wondered if true drinking culture that was so rampant in the city had made its way this far into the countryside. Then again, John could not imagine any of the upper-class boys going to a corner shop and spending the last of their change on 3 for 2 bottles of alcopop.

TW: REFERENCES TO HOMOPHOBIC AND DOMESTIC ABUSE
"John; I'm inviting you to my house." Jesus, he could be so clueless.
“What John?” Sherlock turned violently towards John, which made him flinch. “Yes?”
"John, I am a homosexual. I like men." And what if he did? What would John do?
“You know what I’m doing, John.” He spat. “Stop asking.” Sherlock opened his chest of draws and bundled some clothes in the same bag with the blade in it.
"Hi." A guy next to him said as he reached across the cupboard above John's head. John didn't feel like talking, but equally didn't want to get off on the wrong foot with his dorm mates. The boy opened the cupboard and reached for a packet of biscuits. "I'm Philip" John smiled forcefully.
"What time?"
“Two chips please.” John answered, feeling for the note in his pocket. £2.50 each. He could decide if that was a good deal or not. The man nodded, turning to shovel chips into the yellowed cartons that were sitting on the countertop. John licked his lips anxiously, waiting for the man to ask for payment. He defiantly had a £5 note on him. Even if he didn’t, he could ask Sherlock for money. Sherlock would give him money. After about a minute, the man turned back.
"Sherlock..."
hello im alive
————-
It still made him feel uneasy though, the gossip around Sherlock. Anderson was not the first person to mention his personality, and John felt he would not be the last. Still,, Sherlock had been mostly nice to John. He seemed eccentric, that was all. John couldn’t figure him out though.
In History, they were beginning to plan for their next essay exam. John had at least 20 different plans and did not see how this was beneficial, but quietly did the work none the less. Sherlock was not in the lesson, which did not surprise John. His brain was too tired to worry and simply fixated his thoughts on revision.
“Well Sherlock, you know from last year that I don’t mind extra tutoring if that’s what you need.”
"And that." John added. Sherlock smiled quickly before taking a long drag, flicking the ash into the air.
"That's nice of you, Sherlock."
“What do you mean, kidnapped?” And so John explained as dead pan as his possibly could, Sherlock’s eyes not leaving John’s face as he listened intently. After John stopped talking, Sherlock paused for a moment, shaking his head slightly before smiling loosely.
John opened his eyes to look at Sherlock, who was now standing at his full height. He seemed to be smiling, large and sincere, and John felt his heartbeat in his ears. This time, John met his lips halfway, standing on his tip toes, and laced his arm around Sherlock’s back. He felt him relax into John’s arms as they began to kiss again. It was perhaps one of the most natural feelings in the world, kissing, and kissing Sherlock seemed to be the best of it.
"No problem." John smiled, pressing the mug into his hands. He turned away from Philip to go and sit down.
“I’m getting a drink.” Sherlock gestured to the kettle.
"Yes, she does." Sherlock replied, causing a lump to settle in John's throat.
“You need to work in pairs, so I expect the plan submissions by next Friday. They shouldn’t take too long. You have todays lesson and then the next one, as well as homework. Any problems, let me know.” Mr McGowan said from the front of the class room. There was the nodding of heads from the rest of the students as a low hum of conversation began. John slipped his text book from his bag, opening the page to the section on the security of the Tudor dynasty as Sherlock produced his history notebook.
"John, have you done chapter 3." Sherlock asked, sitting up. His eyes caught the sunlight, and they suddenly became a translucent bluey green. They were stunning. John blushed at the idea that he called Sherlock's eyes stunning. "John?" Sherlock did not drop John's gaze. He cleared his throat.
They'd stayed at the Holmes estate for only an hour after that. After Sherlock had fixed the shelf he walked straight past John and down the stairs. John had quickly followed, bemused over the sudden silent treatment. Mrs Holmes announced she had made lunch and they ate on the patio that overlooked the grounds. John ate silently, listening to Sherlock and Mrs Holmes speak. It was clear that they didn't get on, Sherlock with his mother more than his mother with Sherlock. Sherlock’s entire body faced away from her, arched towards the lake. John sat alone in his own seat, the one furthest from the round table that the food was on. It was interesting to see Sherlock with his mother, he was a different type of arsehole around her to the arsehole he was around John. They were discussing something about Mycroft and an organisation.
“It’s okay John, not all of us can be student of the week.” Greg was referring to the time their history teacher used John’s Henry VII essay as an example for high quality writing and deemed him as ‘student of the week.’ It lead to John being banter-fully mocked for the following fortnight.
“It doesn’t particularly effect me.” Lie. He could tell Anderson could hear it too.
TW: ALLUDING TO PAST SELF HARM
After stepping through the door, John closed it firmly behind him, listening to it click into place. There were only 3 doors in this corridor, and John quickly found room 1b. The B, he assumed, meant there were other room 1s in the house. He was surprised how large the house was, the exterior fooling him into expecting a smaller building.
“I don’t ask you to care about me, John. I don’t know why you do, I didn’t ask you to.” Sherlock glared at him.
"Would you like me to get some mugs? If you're boiling the kettle, can you pour me a cup." John nodded as Philip bent down to his right to open a cupboard, producing several mugs. "Would anyone like a cup of tea?" He called to the group behind him. Someone groaned.
"Yes." John was sure Sherlock wasn't like this with others. He was rude to Anderson and seemed to avoid all human contact. Yet, here he was, being invited back to his room-mates home. Sherlock paused. "Unless you're busy doing...stuff." Sherlock said the word 'stuff' as if it were a poisonous word. John shook his head.
"Oh, hello Sherlock." Philip replied bitterly. He turned his head towards John. "Would you like to come to breakfast with me, John." John almost spat out his drink and watched Sherlock stifle a laugh out of the corner of his eye.
"Are you alright?" He asked. John ran his fingers through his hair, pulling at the roots. He closed his eyes before turning round.
"No problem." Silence. "Sorry, what's your name?"
“How nice of him.” He quipped and John shrugged, cracking his knuckles. There was silence for a moment and John watched Sherlock open the window, the air already chilly with the autumnal air. “I should start wearing jumpers,” John smiled at the thought of Sherlock wearing a blue cable knit. “it’s becoming cold.”
“Yes, Sherlock.”
“Thank you for apologising.” He begun. John was unsure of how to continue. “But I’m more worried about…”He trailed off, his eyes catching the inside of Sherlock’s sleeve, his brain filled again with the blade that was tarnished with the boys blood. Sherlock looked towards the front and sighed.
“John, this won’t reflect your abilities if you do it now. Currently, you need to sleep.” John knew Sherlock was right, but something was stopping him from letting him help.
John was guided back to the car swiftly after, his thoughts cloudy and confused. He wasn’t sure which team this man meant, who this man was or if being on the same team was a good thing. It was hurried journey back to the school and John could hardly remember it at all. There was the underlying stab of fear bubbling restlessly at the back of his head.
At his own insistence Mycroft had handed John a fresh suit, a huge strap of cash, and vehicle transport that John used to take the four of them along with Carl and Michael's wives Diane and Cecile down to Brentwood to treat them all to dinner and their own bottle of wine at Masons.
They stayed for another two hours, ordering more drinks and snacks, talking with John since it was slow, and completely forgetting about the outside world. Soon the store emptied, John topped up their tea cups and laid down a fresh pot before he and his staff cleaned up half of the dining room for the day, pushed five tables together, and loaded the tea trolleys with the day's leftover food: soup, sandwiches, pastries, salads, even some hot boxed lunch items and desserts as well as coffee and tea. They also opened up a side office Sherlock had assumed was a store room for cleaning supplies, and set two chairs against the wall next to it. John came back over with a smile.
They waited there in full silence for several minutes, seemed a small eternity of course, but he made sure to keep his breathing steady and even, no hint of fear, no showing of nerves. Though he could feel that his hand was as steady as stone. Mycroft must be pissed about something to have these guys pick him up instead of the aloof assistant, and he had been trying to puzzle out why when he remembered the one way mirror and almost broke out into a cold sweat as he figured it out. Big Brother was always watching. Mycroft had bugged the flat again from the last time Sherlock had done a surveillance sweep, he had seen what had happened to Sherlock last night. Oh great buggering fuck, not even Sherlock was going to be able to find the pieces of his body.
Watercress and beet root salad with a ginger sesame dressing
And why would someone who'd had the brains and ability to put themselves through Oxford immediately turn around and risk their necks on the front lines of a war instead of putting their hard won education to any kind of good use? It made absolutely no sense. Not to mention, this was a man enjoying his military life to the point he not only pushed himself to join the Commandos, but also tattooed his deployments into his skin for posterity. This man would have stayed in the military until it killed him, he was invalided, or he'd climbed as high as he could up the officer's ladder and stayed there until he died. The man had never set foot in Oxford in his life. Welbeck or Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, he would absolutely believe, but definitely NOT Oxford.
He blinked once.
"She needed surgery, probably appendicitis from how she was holding her stomach and her age. Child Services would have forcibly taken her away after the surgery once they found out she was living on the streets with her homeless guardian, probably permanently. John got him to sign over emergency temporary custody so they wouldn't be slowed down with paperwork on the hospital's end and possibly reduce her chances of survival. John or his assistant is probably also a notary. Closest hospital is only six blocks away, they should definitely get to her in time." He said quietly for Lestrade's benefit.
He smiles a bit at the sight of food, but that doesn't stop the wince when he sits down on the hard bar stool. Dinner is eaten in silence, it's always quiet for about the first twelve hours after one of these 'episodes'. John doesn't know what to say, and Sherlock doesn't want to talk. He has three cups of tea, knowing full well it will make him have a hard time sleeping tonight, in fact he's counting on it. John does the dishes without preamble, more to give himself something to do than anything else.
John nodded again and they headed back to the restaurant. The ambulance was still there, and Lestrade had the matter well in hand. Surprisingly, Sherlock had taken on the task of keeping the customers happy and was directing the staff even though John would have thought that food service would have stopped entirely, but he had merely reorganized people in the affected areas into other available seating. Mycroft had shown up as well and was directing a cleanup team to finish documenting the evidence and clear up the mess. A repair man was also there removing the old windows and replacing them with new ones.
“You were fucking with my head, I get that, but the fact remains that there's something there inside of me for you to fuck around
By midafternoon they were finally pulling up to the main house of Holmes Manor, Holmestead Groves, even though they would probably be staying in the west annex house Briar Rose Hall, or if Mycroft had his way about it, he would take over the southern guest house Crestfield Point for the duration of his stay and let everyone else get up to whatever they wished.
He doesn't even remember when it started happening, when things had... shifted so greatly. John had never thought he would be like this. He was a doctor for chrissakes he helps people, heals them, and yet somehow, he has no idea when, this great dark beast started rising up inside of him, a beast that willingly and intentionally hurts someone he cares about so deeply.
"I meant running a medical clinic out of a restaurant."
He'd gone there once, in uniform so he wouldn't be recognized, to check them out after they took over the bistro. The manager was a severe looking individual who obviously had his workers afraid to draw his attention to them, he hadn't seen the owner or met the chefs, but the food was overpriced for what it was, and all of the meat dishes were either cut into small pieces, or breaded and deep fried, and most were completely smothered in gravy or heavy sauces, a sure sign of cheap ingredients and low quality meats, and usually poor or terrible kitchen standards.
John nodded but his silence and probably his expression, was very telling. Sebastian nudged his shoulder a moment later.
staff meeting
How could anyone be so blind? John under no circumstances had any love of having power over another, if anything he was selflessly noble and protective to a fault. John had seen Sherlock at his worst and also at his weakest and had never done anything to revel in it, or even come close to taking advantage of the situation. They were all moronic idiots not even worthy of breathing the air on the same PLANET as John. He wondered if there was a way to make stupidity a painfully fatal disease. He was sure he could figure it out, now that he had sufficient motivation.
The wicked tone convinced him, John was obviously proud of the drink, which made him want to try it even more.
Fresh Crab cakes- Three made from scratch crab cakes using fresh lump crab and our own blend of seasonings.
Kinkmeme fill. Sherlock provokes John into rough, angry sex, which John believes is at least borderline abusive, so that Sherlock can bask in the attentions of guilty!John.
He grabbed his gear and shouldered it roughly onto his back.
For sitting on the floor bleeding profusely into a pocket handkerchief, Mycroft was surprisingly calm and articulate.
"Detained and Tortured Black Ops. That was Mark Hamsfeld, he's a buddy of mine from Afghanistan and one of the best combat surgeons I've ever known, we worked tandems together for six months. His security clearance was level five before I even GOT to the war, so you shouldn't have a problem vetting him. I'll call you when Fletcher can be moved."
“He’s not wrong though. He is the most powerful man I know.” He stared off into the distance for a moment before shaking his head. “He’s such a dickhead.” John laughed.
“You can take my jumper if you want.” He was meant to make it sound like a sincere request, but in reality John sounded almost desperate.
“John, I just want to say I’m sorry.” Sherlock quietly murmured to John. “I’m sorry you had to see that. I’m sorry I walked off, I can’t imagine how awful you must have felt.” John put down his highlighter and looked to Sherlock.
“Of what?’
"It's Mike. Mike Stamford? We went to school together?" It did not ring a bell.
"Goodbye Anderson." Sherlock said, signalling with his hand to close the door. Anderson nodded, sighing. As he stepped away Sherlock called him back. "Anderson. You might want to tie your robe tighter. Just a suggestion" Anderson followed Sherlock's eye train to his hips and the gap in the robe before wrapping it round himself tighter and slamming the door.
“Sherlock.”
When he finally made his way back to the dorm, John found Sherlock curled up on his bed, reading.
The walk across the grounds allowed John to clear his head, so when he entered the Sixth form house he was almost calm. It was a common room for all the students to share. And by that it meant it was the local student drinking place. Although none of the lower sixth students could legally drink, that didn’t stop them, and it seemed the school was getting paid too much money to care.
“Well, that’s just Sherlock.” Mike replied and Greg nodded. John shook his head.
The room he was now sat in was white, with a large desk which was empty and a few paintings on the walls. He guessed it was some form of office, the tall cabinet in the corner marked with some labelling system, although John was too far away to see the inscription. He was slightly on edge, his fingers running the rough polyester of his blazer between his fingers. John could not begin to imagine why he was here, and the office gave little to no information about it’s owner.
“You wouldn’t want the wrong person finding out.” Anderson said and John swallowed.
“I know she would, Johnny.”
“Nothing.” He remarked and Greg tutted.
Someone knocked on the wall.
It was on the Thursday, the night before match day, where John felt the worst. His body hurt to move and his brain was cloudy from a lack a sleep. He could barely form coherent sentences and answered most questions with a low huff, his body not yet used to excess movement. That evening, Sherlock decided to intervene.
"In my bag." He replied monotonously. John crouched down under Sherlock's bed and retrieved his rucksack. He dug around inside till he found a pill box. It was at the bottom, covered by clothes and books. They rattled loudly, clearly untaken for quite some time. John passed Sherlock the bottle of water on his night-stand and box of pills and watched him take them. Sherlock hesitated for a moment, before pressing one out of their silver wrapping and downing it with a swig of water, rolling his eyes as he did so.
“Yes.” Sherlock paused, as if resetting something in his head.
John swallowed. His roommate was a nut case who went off without telling anyone and his education was screwed unless he maintained his ridiculous grades. Now he almost missed Raglesfield.
"Well we can just bullshit our data."
"Enemies? Real people don't have enemies." Sherlock smiled and shook his head slightly.
“Like repeition of clothing. Most people wear one particular style or item, regardless of the outfit. You always wear, or carry jumpers.”
"Really John?" He said sarcastically. John frowned at Sherlock's reaction.
"We could have a ball! Like Cinderella!"
“No, Mycroft would skin them alive if they hurt me, I'm actually surprised one of them knocked me out. You knicked his phone? I'm impressed. Where are you?”
Allyenda giggled and held her arms out to him. He darted a quick glance to Sherringford to make sure this was fine before taking the girl with his good arm and balancing her on his hip.
"Thank you John, yes we will. I will have a large full English with Earl Grey tea today please."
Davis shook his head. "We deal with locals, mild sedatives, and nitrous oxide for the most part. If someone needs to go under they bring a specialist and their own supplies. The closest hospital is a thirty minute flight out from here, and they don't have clearance. Mr. Holmes has the list of approved hospitals. We've got only the most basic supplies, and I can get more pretty quickly, but the thing is I really don't know what exactly we would need for this, this is way beyond my level of training, so you're the expert right now, and officially in charge unless Mr. Holmes says otherwise."
“No, I have since had one by both a male and a female nurse for comparison, and it did nothing for me.” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.
Sherlock left the room and was just evidence binning the gloves and mask as Anderson came in. The man was in a tolerable mood today so Sherlock was ignoring him for the most part and reached for his coat. He didn't miss the small gasp of breath from Anderson however.
Sherlock hated the inane media idiots buzzing like flies around a dead corpse, or corpses in this particular instance. This case had better be interesting, he may have been BORED lately, but couldn't this have happened later this evening or even a day later? John would have continued last nights activities this morning, continued them for another few hours at least before going and making breakfast and serving it to him in bed then giving him an earth shattering blowjob and maybe even helping him bathe. John had done that once, after the first time. Annoying as it was, Sherlock really DID have a difficult time standing for any amount of time that day, he hadn't had any time to prepare for John's unexpected reaction, a fact he never overlooked again. While showering would have been very difficult to manage, sitting in the bath would have been even harder to get out of. So John had given him a sponge bath in bed.
"I don't care how you do it but find anyone else who is type A Pos or O Neg that is clean and willing to donate even just a half pint. I need another three pints to have a chance of stopping this bleeding and stabilizing his BP. Everyone else, lets wheel him to the surgery room, cut off the rest of those clothes, clean him up as best you can so I can see what I am doing, and prop him higher off those nails with rolled towels. Support everything that isn't pierced, I want absolutely no pressure on any of them. Leave a 4-6 centimeter gap between every nail head and the table in case we have to resuscitate him again."
The extremely enjoyable company after the long day and the lovely meal he didn't have to dash away from right in the middle of, had John feeling more relaxed than he had in ages. It also had him missing his brilliant madman, and John finally realized what Mycroft had meant.
John just rolled his eyes and led them to their table.
! The only way you could have
“Fruit medley, or porridge with cinnamon and honey?”
Five years of deep undercover work cooperating with nine different governments to collect intel on insurgents trying to amass weapons, whose primary objective was to get another country to fire the first shot so they would be justified in declaring war, and they were within a month of being able to do it. Their main contact was a man called Sebastian Moran, the right hand man for one of the most notorious shadow crimelords in the world, known only to other criminals as a name whispered in terror, 'Moriarty' as if he were the Boogie Man or the Devil himself. Any criminal mastermind that struck terror into the hearts of some of the most ruthless cutthroats in the underworld was definitely someone they had their eye on. This agent had successfully retrieved not only all of the information on the insurgents, but also managed to get a detailed view of the vast web that Moriarty controlled, and the information had been terrifying. There wasn't a major or minor criminal element that the man wasn't involved with or connected to in some form or another. Drugs, theft, money laundering, protection rackets, street gangs, counterfeiting, smuggling, jewels, false antiques, real antiques, political bribes, assassinations, weapons, starting or ending wars, government corruption, terrorist movements, bombings, political backing and blackmail, there wasn't a single thing he wasn't involved with. And Mycroft realized with a sickening realization, Moriarty was almost too big to fail. If they cut off one leg the others would absorb the loss and he'd retaliate with twice as much vengeance and rebuild it up again stronger. How had they not seen such a major player for so long?
James looked a bit green around the gills and Steve looked like John might be nuts. Tom however looked like he was fighting off a laugh. Perfect.
fucking know better! You let me believe for HOW long that I was hurting him, DESTROYING him and you
He had forgotten, in fact erased the memory until the moment the task force had entered to take John, and that's when he knew Mycroft had death on his mind. 'Only one place to take their wounded', he remembered too late. Their family's home had served as a fort and an army hospital during both world wars, and during World War Two the wounded had resided in the chapel, which also housed the family crypt.
“It is, and having grown up here myself, I can tell you it is a very good world, good for the soul, and good for healing the heart. I wish I had known you a little better before trying to talk to you about this, I have to admit it's quite awkward.”
"Letting student interns assist a veteran doctor in his own practice? Of course it is, why wouldn't it be? I'm more concerned however about the detective inspector asking the civilian consulting detective about what is and isn't against the law."
He wanted to protest, Sherlock was one thing, he wanted to follow after the mad git, Mycroft was another matter entirely, he wasn't some pet to call to heel when beckoned. But he also knew Mycroft may have just changed his mind about slitting his throat, probably to offer him a devil's deal in exchange for his life, but something had come up, something he could be useful in, something that might let him walk away without selling his soul, and so he warily followed after Mycroft, grabbing a few tissues to clean up the blood on his neck.
The presence of five of those people in that room had honestly surprised him. Unless there had been several more accomplices than two, which would hint far further towards organized crime than a psychopath killer. But the organized crime type of killer wouldn't have made it so easy to find and identify the bodies or left all of the victims valuables alone when they could be so easily kept or sold for profit, or done the whatever it was that was still off, there was a piece either missing or added to this puzzle and whatever it was, it was important, and something a hired hit or criminal lackey would never do. If their killer was smaller, overweight, and physically weaker like he suspected, it would have been very difficult for him to intimidate one, let alone all five of them at one time without any restraint, guns or not.
“And what is that going to end up costing me?”
The response was almost automatic, after all, that's what he had been living for. Over three years, and all he could even think of doing anymore was running after the mad genius consulting detective and pulling his arse out of the fire, or away from the cliff, or shooting a serial killer trying to take him out. Sherlock would remember him, that was enough, even if Mycroft erased him as completely as he could, he would always exist for Sherlock, so it was fine, it was all fine.
One swipe, just one single swipe of the damp sponge going up and over Sherlock’s hard and flushed cock, with John’s warm breath only inches behind it gently murmuring those words against his skin was all it took. Sherlock was undone, gripping the sheets and crying out as he came, hips thrusting up into the air, John kissing the soft and tender part of Sherlock’s thigh as he rode out the orgasm.
Sherlock is led, gently and without rush, back to his bedroom. John lays him out on the bed like a priceless treasure and feathers kisses all along his forehead and face, and Sherlock wastes no time in unbuttoning his shirt so he can be touched more. Fingers and lips, both incredibly tender and worshipful, travel over every new expanse of flesh revealed. If he could melt, Sherlock knows he'd be doing it now. He's held close and wrapped up in all of John's attention and affection and... and he just wants more of it, all of it, he never wants it to stop, because this, this is a fix that won't kill him, or run out, or leave him a twitching mess wracked in the pains of withdrawal. This is a drug that makes him more, makes him better, makes him strive to try, to want to be something even better than what he is, to become someone who glows just as brightly as John glows. Sherlock has always been an addict, and John is a drug he refuses to fight. The man gives him a high that nothing else compares to, and he's never going to let it go.
"That's why he's always here when I am, I wonder if he ever takes a day off."
"Alright that's very good. Arms?"
"Because, John Hamish Watson, I in no way consider you an abuser or a threat to me. The day you make me afraid of you or make me fear for my own life, is the day I will shoot you with your own gun."
When he pulled up the report, they of course confirmed his assessment. Insulin, steroids, PCP, and THC were present in both victims and were the determined cause of death, both had been ruled as homicide. A small, shallow, crescent-shaped mark on the second victim, on the inner hip near the pubis caught his attention. It was from a fingernail.
John had been slamming Sherlock's hips into the harsh edge of the table without care, there was a red indented mark there that he sees before it's covered by fine tailored trousers.
He doesn't know what he'll do if Sherlock says 'yes', maybe stay at a bedsit or a hostel, but at the same time he hopes that Sherlock does kick him out, that the man will start protecting himself, defending himself against this monster that obviously John has no control of, and no idea how to fight, a monster John wants to rip apart with his bare hands. He'd die for Sherlock, nearly has several times. Heck he killed for Sherlock within two days of knowing the man, and now after two years, something inside of himself wants to destroy what he wants to protect. To literally be at war with yourself, he wonders if this is how it feels to go mad.
Of the staff of fifty and supplies he'd had sent up in order to help prepare for their arrival a week ago so that their appearance conscious mother would not feel stressed about the possibility of John coming across a single speck of dust or untidiness, only ten were standing out front to greet them, along with the permanent staff of ten, meaning she was taking the opportunity to use the extra help to get all of the other houses in order and anything else done she had been putting off for more urgent things as well. The visible grounds were immaculate, and he had no doubt the veritable army of gardeners were somewhere on the expansive acreage creating or maintaining an Eden for his mother. He'd keep them all on here for another month or so as a gift, so his mother could host one of her parties, she did so love to play hostess.
He had called the house in Essex and neither his eldest brother nor mother had any idea where Mycroft was. Sherlock was furious and terrified, and a full search of the city and his brothers usual haunts had revealed nothing. Then again Mycroft wasn't tied to the city nearly as much as Sherlock himself, Britain, yes, London no, chances were good that he was still somewhere in the territories because he disliked getting his hands dirty, but that was no indication that John was anywhere even remotely nearby him, and most likely nowhere near London anymore. This entire situation was unacceptably infuriating.
OOOOH Mycroft next chappie! Hehe
Violet Holmes swept Mycroft into her arms and hugged him like she had feared she would never see him again. Sherringford clapped him soundly about the shoulders and pulled him into a one-armed embrace, and the little girl immediately held out her arms to be caught in a half flying/falling maneuver that landed her squarely in Mycroft's arms and planting a kiss on his cheek at the same time. The boy hung back from physical affection, but smiled and waved shyly to his uncle.
He smiled at them. "I'm surprised you two have stayed this long, won't your families be worried about you? It's nearly eleven."
"Apparently I AM, Sherlock, even if I never meant to be and I don't know why I am. But I don't run away from my mistakes, and what I did yesterday definitely counts as me making a terrible mistake. I hurt you, and it isn't the first time I've done it. Believe it or not Anderson was trying to do you a favor, wake you up to reality, and part of me is praying that you will actually listen to him and throw me out."
Sherlock fought to not sigh in exasperation.
“Yes, well awhile ago your brother thought he intentionally exposed me to a psychotropic drug that affected the primal fear centers of the brain, then locked me in a lab and proceeded to do everything in his power to scare me to death all while he watched me on camera. The thing is I actually
Mulled wine
Apple ginger tea with cinnamon honey.
“Sounds great, ta.”
He tucked the pack back into his pocket when the man refused to take it back. The ride was completely silent, not even any radio as they drove who knows where. Silence is one thing, but awkward, uncomfortable silence is another matter entirely.
"About an hour ago Sir. We called you the minute we got him back within communications range, but he's not doing well Sir, he's been severely tortured and dumped, so who knows what he may have said. We don't know yet if they managed to find the information, but we will soon."
Only twenty-four, been in the military long enough to not only be a fully trained commando but also deployed as such to the middle east three times, the first time three years ago for a full six months, then again a year after that for nine months, and this current tour had still been ongoing before his untimely end. Yet he'd found the time and had also had the money to go to Oxford, whose lowest degree of study was a bachelor's degree which some people could complete in 3-4 years if you went for the right course of study, were there full time and worked yourself to near exhaustion? Most people on average needed about 5-6 years for their bachelors degrees just because they needed all of their classes to line up right in their schedules. Even if he'd graduated early at sixteen, that would have still put him at twenty-one at the time of graduation, and he was about to be on his second tour by then, not finishing his education and joining up.
"I'm sorry Sherlock, I am so, so sorry."
John fetches his own phone out of his trousers, and sees he has a voicemail from Lestrade as he heads to the bathroom to do a quick wash up. "Twenty five people discovered dead with no immediate signs pointing directly to either murder or mass suicide. All of them died at approximately the exact same time, many of them in obvious pain, some accompanied by seizures. I need answers fast because the media found out about this one before we did, a reporter's kid discovered the bodies and they walked all over the place and probably took pictures before they phoned the police. I've sent an officer that will be there in ten and Sherlock doesn't get to argue it this time. Please make sure he's decent, this is already a media nightmare on its own without him deciding to show up in a ninja suit again. And if anyone asks about the photos of him covered in blood and wielding a harpoon, please say no comment."
“You might just have a thing for sponge baths.”
"Not really, no. You kill me and Sherlock's safe again, I get it. Just tell him I'm sorry and I love him. Sorry I let you down Mycroft." John closed his eyes, because the last thing he saw wasn't going to be Mycroft damnit, it was going to be Sherlock, that weekend a few months ago when he'd had the detective wrapped around his entire body as he'd taken him against the wall in his bedroom where Mrs. Hudson couldn't have heard. Sherlock had actually blushed that day, apparently there was this one spot he had been hitting just right and the stoic man had been blushing and whimpering and repeating John's name in a seductive mantra that had sounded like a desperate prayer. If it's possible to wait around after death, he'd do that, look after Sherlock until the mad git either did himself in or got himself killed.
convincing about it, you just might talk me out of hitting you again, but you had better be damn convincing.”
They stood there in the foyer with Sherlock pressing him against the door and the man's tongue literally halfway down his throat in a possessive gesture he'd only seen once before, the first night Sherlock had kissed him, after they went home from the incident at the pool.
“Terrible thing to be held that long, hoping to be rescued, only to be killed in the end.”
Your life not only feels ruled by food, but you also have a hard time putting on weight or gaining it back if you get sick for awhile. I've had an overactive pancreas resulting in chronic low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since I was a child, and will most likely be an insulin dependent diabetic when I get older because it is a common result of my condition. The body makes too much insulin then it wears down and doesn't make enough or stops altogether.
Instead of being insulted, John merely smiled. "You know it really is brilliant how you do that. Though if you had to deal with Harry, you'd do everything you could to not be available either."
"Of course, bubble and squeak, just made a fresh batch. And for you Miss Diana, or did you change your name again?"
"Allyenda Marie Elizabeth Diana Eloise Holmes. I'm four. I'm going to be a princess, uncle Mycroft is going to make me one, so I'm going to marry him."
"Hello Mummy, you're looking absolutely radiant."
Sherlock got undressed while John fetched the needed supplies. Sherlock was surprised to find himself shaking a bit as John soaked the soft sponge in the basin of hot, soapy water, squeezed it out, and began gently washing him down slowly. Every touch seemed electrified, lighting up his nerves and hitching his breath. This was all definitely John’s doing somehow.
“Yes I've noticed.”
Moran grinned. “You like it when I play rough.”
Sherlock couldn't remember a time he had been more furious or had felt so utterly helpless. Part of him wanted to phone Lestrade, no matter how big of a blow to his ego it would have been, but the rest of him knew it would be pointless, and not because half of Scotland Yard were incompetent morons, though they were of course, it was simply the fact that it was Mycroft. Sherlock could have gone to Scotland Yard with videotape showing his brother abducting and murdering a man, presented the gun with his fingerprints in the victim's blood, found his DNA at the scene of the crime, and presented a signed confession and there still "wouldn't have been any evidence to support your wild claim against your brother". Mycroft had connections, hell he could probably blackmail the entire world into handing him the reins and letting him rule them all if he got it into his head to be an overlord instead of a manipulating bastard pulling all the strings from the background and pretending like he was no one special. You could assassinate the entire Royal family, The Prime Minister, all of Parliament and the House of Lords, and not even a day later all of Britain would still be ticking away like clockwork as if nothing had happened. Contrariwise, If someone ever got it into their heads to shoot a minor clerk in the British Government, Great Britain and half of the world would fall into utter chaos in less than twelve hours. Unless of course Mycroft had some sort of failsafe in place, and knowing Mycroft, he most likely did.
"Sure you did, that's why there are finger marks on your wrist instead of cuff abrasions, and why John looks so guilty instead of embarrassed. How many times has he apologized so far? Because John would NEVER hurt you, Sherlock, he CARES too damn much, you know that right?"
It was around seven and the paperwork was finally finished, (but not by him), so Sherlock grabbed Lestrade and insisted they go out for drinks to celebrate. Since Lestrade had yet to give up on him 'becoming more social' he had startled the Detective Inspector half to death six months ago when he had accepted the regular offer to get a drink after the conclusion of their latest case. Lestrade really should have been more clear that he had been expecting to go to a pub and get alcohol, not be dragged into John's little shop and be treated to, in Sherlock's very knowledgeable experience, the best cafe in London. It had all turned out for the best though, now Lestrade could oft be found several mornings a week tucked into one of the window seats, doing some people watching as he sipped his large vanilla espresso and ate his breakfast, even getting drinks to go for most of his team a couple times a week. It was also quickly becoming a tradition for him and Sherlock to wind up there after cases, and this was no exception.
TO BE DELETED
“John. Could you tell me how you would expand on this point?” His English teacher said suddenly. John had been in the middle of debating whether he ought to just go to Sherlock’s house to see if he was okay.
"Nice to meet you, I'm John"
“One question though,” Sherlock hummed in reply. “Why a palace?”
"I've been here for the last 4 minutes."
“It’s fine, Sherlock.” John responded; his throat suddenly thick. “Still very impressive.” Sherlock nodded and John noticed how he didn’t push it any further.
"Not if you're making them I won't, Anderson." Called a voice. Philip looked down sheepishly.
“Where the fuck have you been?”
“What?” John said defensively. The pin suited man smiled.
He couldn't fancy him. That would make him gay and John wasn't gay. He'd had girlfriends in the past. They hadn't lasted more than a couple months and even then, anything of the sexual nature seemed to un-nerve him quite a bit. Women were pretty, John liked their smiles, but the thought of what was underneath made him feel almost sick. Sherlock, however, was different. He didn’t smile, he wasn’t soft. He was mysterious and almost untouchable. But it was just Sherlock, no other man, so it meant he could be gay. John was trying to figure him out, that was all.
"What did you do to your hands?" Sherlock asked, walking towards John. John shifted over slightly, inviting Sherlock to sit next to him.
"There will be a trip to Brighton in two weeks time to study the castles and other buildings made along the coast to support your findings for coursework.” Their teacher said. John and Sherlock sat next to each other but, as Sherlock was not talking to John, they worked in utter silence. John didn’t mind so much that Sherlock was silent, but he wished he wouldn’t sit next to him. It put John on edge. “It will be an overnight stay at a local hostel, and we will be leaving at midday the next day. Money must be payed to the school by next Monday. Any questions, do not hesitate to contact me." John saw Sherlock look at him out of his peripheries, he sighed, before looking at the front. Why did Sherlock keep looking at him?
"No problem, John." John lent across the table to pull Sherlock's book closer to his own, but brushed Sherlock's arm as he did so. John jerked back quickly and looked up to see Sherlock looking up at him with a look of bewilderment on his face. John swallowed and laughed airily before bending down to begin writing. He felt Sherlock move slightly away from him and a rock settled in his stomach. Get your shit together, John.
“I’ll give you something to laugh about in a moment.” Sherlock responded, his voice a sudden, very different, growl and John knew he ought to leave it, but the giddiness from the alcohol pushed him further and he wanted to hear Sherlock’s voice again.
"Your house? Now?"
“He’s a winger. That’s his job.” Greg said, leaning to talk to Sherlock.
"Stay here." Sherlock told John before going in. He was obviously very secretive. John nodded and paced the corridor, feeling for the rug under his feet. After a while John settled on leaning on the table under the window. Sherlock had only been in the room for a few moments when there was a loud crash from inside.
Sherlock's brow wrinkled. "How do you mean?"
"Gossip and sensationalism Sherlock, the press and public are addicted to it and you tend to amply provide them with both. Talking about it only makes it last longer, even if it's just to deny it."
Incidentally on this particular generational branch of the family tree, the Holmes traits had become more prominent with each child their mother had borne, and Sherlock had the worst of it. The thrice refined and honed blade of his mind was razor-sharp on both sides, cleanly slicing through everything in its path, and then just as quickly, it's owner. Sherlock had become an addict for years in an attempt to escape his own mind, and though Mycroft didn't approve, he could understand Sherlock's reasoning, misguided though it was. If he made his mind speed up it all became a hum of white noise and was easier to ignore. At least it was a drug easy for Mycroft to obtain pure and to limit Sherlock's supply of, gradually cutting it with prescription drugs to aid his recovery until Sherlock's self medication was truly that. The now harmless combination of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, caffeine, and prescription drugs that Sherlock routinely injected these days still gave him a feeling of being high, but did him far more good than harm and wasn't in any way illegal, seeing as Sherlock had prescriptions posted in his medical record for everything, along with instructions to inject intravenously, even if he wasn't aware of it.
i’m back again
hello hello
So, John left for his English lesson, his bag on his back, alone. He was naturally good at English, it came from being able to write essays very quickly without having to think much about them. He kept it to himself, but secretly John boasted the ability to write pages and pages on one line of text, analyse it until the very last full stop. It meant that most lessons John didn’t need to focus particularly hard, instead he wrote things in the back of his notebook, from things that were worrying him to shitty poems or sketches of flowers and bad horses.
“I can’t be here. I need to get away. I can’t be here.” Sherlock repeated, his tone desperate.
“Wait, John.” Sherlock said suddenly. John looked up and moved his hands.
“Makes sense.” Gregg added with a laugh, rolling his eyes in a friendly and downing the dregs of his drink.  The plates were collected by one of the bartenders, and they sat together in silence for a moment briefly after.
John, however, had meant it when he kissed Sherlock. He meant it even more when his friend lent forward to kiss him again and was sure of his decision when the curly haired lad kissed him with his tongue. Suddenly, the explicit attraction John felt didn’t seem so ridiculous anymore, but he wasn’t sure if Sherlock felt the same. It was more an even footing. John was waiting for Sherlock to say something.
“I think so…” He paused, looking up to see Sherlock’s eyes. “I think I was just kidnapped.” Sherlock laughed in a way that to John sounded almost like a purr.
