Dean is stirring the beef stew when Sammy gets back. As soon as he’s in the door, his mouth is running a mile a minute. It’s a welcome sight to see him this animated. So much better than the angry brat pouting all the damn time. Sammy pulls out his homework and still, he keeps yapping about this or that and that he made some new friends. Dean just smiles at him.
So, yeah, maybe it wasn’t his business but a dash of curiosity and wanna-be hero lingered in his veins. He followed the voices.
Dean gave him a cheeky smile because, for some reason, this other boy getting so upset and flustered was endlessly amusing. He shrugged nonchalantly, “Oh you know, not much, besides getting fired is all.”
It was actually nice to see Sammy enjoying himself that day. It was getting rare to see the kid smile. He understood what their dad was doing was important, but he felt like their dad should be here more or at least find a healthy balance. Of course, Dean agreed, but a part of him was glad their old man was gone. As the years passed, it seemed their dad become more… apathetic and violent. Small mistakes, he blows up over. The apologies became fewer and his drinking increased. He knows their dad loves them. He tells them so, but it’s one thing to say, and another to show it.
“Look at you getting all huffy.” Dean teased. “It’s cool, man. The dude made it clear he doesn’t want me around and I don’t plan to save his hide a second time. Even if he claims he’s going to get it worse.”
“So Dean put his physical well-being on the line the first time and knew you needed help later because you were unwilling to do it, and asked for compensation if it came to that? Am I getting this right?”
Around the corner, he saw that there on the ground was a dude. He had a split lip and glaring at his attackers. They closed the upper locker on his hoodie, but it was too tight for him to slip out of. He was stuck and was using his messenger bag to defend himself. Three against one seemed hardly fair. Why not even the odds a little?
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just all that lifting and carrying made it really tender.” Dean said as he made his way to the living room. He inwardly groaned at the mess Sammy left behind. Empty water bottles, chip bags, and crumbs everywhere. With a grimace, he knocked some of the crumbs off the couch. Deeming it acceptable he plopped down on the couch and propped his feet on the coffee table. He’d have Sammy clean it later. He hated cockroaches and this is how you get them.
The biggest of the group yanked the bag from the bullied boy and dumped its content. “Where’s my money Faggot? Huh?” He kicked the guy when he didn’t see what he wanted. The dude on the ground winched but didn’t say anything.
The Elders called this man “Chuck” and refused to say more. It’s like he’s a God. A man that never dies. He’s fathered many children, but he never really gave a damn about any of them. If they didn’t prove useless, he didn’t have any quims about getting rid of them. So far, Castiel and James seemed to be his favorites at the moment. Which resulted in Michael and Lucius (aka Lucifer) resenting these two twins. They didn’t like being replaced.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Fine! I can do it for $30. Final offer.” He wiggled his eyebrows up and down at Castiel.
“Are you sure?” It seemed to be a family trait as he tilted his head too, in a gesture that said he didn’t understand.
“No!” Castiel adjusted his bag over his shoulder. He shook his head as if in disbelief. “My god, you are even worse than Crowley’s goons. At least with them, I know they’re assholes. But you? You act like a savior but your not. Your just another kind of bully. But what really makes you worse than them, is that you prey on the weak and helpless all for your own greed.”
The Elders know of him and are terrified of his power. They were all encouraged to have large families, just to keep the ranks. However many families died out or “disappeared” for any infractions.
Dean was a little out of breath, “Now listen up you sons of bitches. You ain’t shit. If I so much as see any of you around, I’m going to fuck you up, again and again. So stay the hell away from me and him.” To which he pointed at Mikhailov.
“Hiring a bodyguard isn’t about being weak. Don’t you think I also want to rage war and say fuck it all! I, too, have people I love and care about.” Balthazar seethed but gathered in his emotions. He came forward and knelt in front of his cousin. He peered into his eyes. “Dean isn’t a bad guy. Whether you like it or not, he isn’t like us. Our family issues don’t apply to him. Yes, he has his own motives, but I saw how he looked at you.” Balthazar softened his tone. “You may be strangers, but he cares about you. He’s genuinely worried about you. Even so, life has taught him that his usefulness needs to be compensated to a degree. It’s obvious that he would have done it for free but he has someone he cares about, that why he even asks.”
Dean could feel a whole body flush. Whether it was anger or shame, he didn’t know and he didn’t like it. This was the first time anyone accused him of being the bad guy. He and Sammy have acted as bodyguards in the past, and everyone they helped was so thankful. This was the first time that someone claimed what he did was wrong. Was it wrong? I mean, they were putting their asses on the line. Was asking for a little compensation really a bad thing?
It was getting closer to midnight, but already he was getting tired. He knew it would be a terrible idea to ask to go home early, so he pressed on. Benny could hear him huff and groan. By midnight, he had enough and pulled him into the back break room.
, his sole purpose until Cas is breathless once again.  Then she’s tugging and steering him by his hair so much that he's starting to think it might be physically possible to cream his shorts just from the burn of it.  That...and the obscene noises dripping out of Cas’s lips on every other exhale.  When Dean finally pulls his slightly swollen lips away, she whimpers.  A hard throb has him rutting up against her.  Shit, he made Castielle Shurley
The receiver buzzes with a sound Dean’s heard a million times in the dead of the night.  He shoves his own bullshit into its deep, dark corner and grips the phone tighter.
“Meet the third Musketeer, boys,” Luc’s smile is entirely too much teeth, “This here’s Jack and he’s gonna be the newest addition to the boy band.  Isn’t that right, kiddo?”
“Heh,” Dean chuckles, drawing back enough to meet her dark blue gaze.  He leans into the soothing circles she’s moved to rub along the tip of his spine, “I was gonna ask you the same thing actually.”
“I know,” Sammy is so close, the words can’t be more that a murmur, but they’re loud even over the blood rushing in his ears, “Dad was a bastard, okay?  A drunk, mean son of a bitch—but that was never on you.  I know you’ve been blaming yourself for a long time—for a
Dean scratches the back of his neck and is already backstepping a little toward the staircase before he even realizes he’s doing it.
“Shit, yeah, of course.  Here why don’t we…” With a psychic message and quick nod to his friend, Cas hops up onto the bed and puts their pillow over his crisscrossed legs.  Dean reaches his arms out but is sure not to actually touch the boy, “I’m gonna lift you up onto the bed so you don’t, y’know, put any strain on anything.  Sound like a deal?  I swear I’ll be super gentle,” Jack’s eyes dart up to Cas for something, some kind of confirmation.  And, yeah, Dean doesn’t remember that many people, but he’s pretty sure Cas has one of those faces that you just trust automatically.
“Shhhh,” Luc holds out a raised finger without even looking over his shoulder, “Hang on, darling, me and Cassie are having a moment.  So, what do you say, Cassie?  Are you gonna grow a pair and take your bon-bon-eating life like a man and not go all Edward-Scissorhands again?”
He almost feels a little dizzy with the need to get as close to Cas as possible.  When he skims his other hand over Cas’s clothed stomach he sees a flash of the oozing wound something had torn into Dream Castiel’s stomach.  He slips his hand under Cas’s shirt until he feels his sleep-warm, unharmed tummy under his fingers.  Dean breathes a little lighter, stroking the soft skin.
Castiel brushes a sweaty lock of hair off her forehead and inches his thrusts even deeper.  She gasps and one of her hands drops away from spreading herself, scrambling back to find his own.  Castiel entwines their fingers and strokes the back of her hand with his thumb, “You can do it, love.  You’re already doing so well for me.  Daddy believes in you.”
His stomach is playing freaking tug of war between fear and blinding anger, making him want to throw crap through the walls and also curl up in a ball and die.
Castiel popped off immediately, pulling the plug ever so slightly away from Dean’s prostate, careful that it wasn’t not enough of a glide to give the sensation of being fucked.  Dean groaned in frustration, a sob wracking his body as he thrusted up into nothing.  He hiccupped; legs squeezed around Castiel’s body.  Castiel clicked the toy off completely, kissing over Dean’s shuddering abdomen and rubbing gently wherever his hands could reach.
Dean balances the player on Cas’s hip and fumbles to figure out where to slide on the headphones over Cas’s wild hair.  He counts the nub of each button until he feels the bottom one--the ‘play’ button.  As the familiar chords break the quiet, Dean hums.  Nothing like his Robert to bring some sunshine to his soul.
Dean’s gaze is fixed on her, gentle and syrupy in a way that isn’t practiced like it usually is for all the usual girls Dean shoots a wink at.  He squats down beside her, and Castielle can feel her cheeks heat up.  A hand equally as warm as the sunshine rubs her upper arm, a conspiratorial smile quirking his lips.
is around.  Mouth opening and snapping shut in quick succession, Dean takes a step back when Luc thumps forward toward the bed, dropping whatever he’s carrying hard onto the unmade surface.
He sits squarely on Cas’s thighs, heaping the rags and towels and a few of his shirts wherever there’s a new cut.  He wraps the whole blanket around Cas’s frame.  How does he seem even smaller?  He tucks in the edges to keep as much of Cas’s body heat locked in as possible, then he lays his entire frame over the other boy to keep even pressure everywhere.  He curls himself tightly over Cas like he can keep the rest of the world out somehow if he holds on long enough.  He kisses the cold tips of ears and whispers against dark, sweaty hair, “Come on, Cas.  Come on, sweetheart,” he sniffs back his clogging nose and nestles his cheek into the unruly hair he can’t imagine living without, “I need you to wake up...
Afterwards, they start up breakfast/lunch and Dean gets out all the fixings for a double-decker PB&J.  He catches the Raman he’s got going on the camp stove right before it burns, cheeks hot but glad that at least Cas hadn’t caught him staring like a weirdo.  And, okay, maybe Dean still is a little hung up on the way Cas’s voice dropped like a stone sometime over the summer--sue him.  He’s got a thing for deep voices, is that a crime?  There’s nothing that catapults Dean into happiness like the sight and sound of Cas walking around with the thin metal headphones on, singing (mumbling) along with Paul Rodgers to “Holy Water” like something out of Dean’s wet dreams.  Dean just counts his lucky stars that Cas is too caught up in the music and making their bed to see Dean look like an idiot.  Something swoopy hits his chest at the fact Cas can nail the song word for word.
Dean’s stomach twists painfully.  Cas’s gaze darts to the side, the quirk of her lips fading though she’s trying to hide it like it was nothing more than a joke.  Hurt twinges in her dark eyes and Dean wants to kick his own ass.  He reaches out and cradle her jaw in his hand.  Barely concealed worry is all he can see leaking out when she turns up to him.
“Perhaps,” Cas hums. Dean’s insides twist and churn and he’s nearly about to change the subject when Cas speaks again, “Do you believe in God, Dean?”
Dean pushes the hard line of his cock up against one of her firm thighs, as if she somehow hadn’t noticed, “Yeah, Cas.  That good.”
Lost in the pink-black behind his closed eyes, Dean scoops in a long breath and lets it fall back out a few seconds later.  He pictures Cas--not flushed and kissy-lipped Cas, but sweatpants and soft smile Cas--standing next to him.  His friend would rub small circles on his back, maybe hook his chin over Dean’s shoulder while he murmured a whole bunch of nothing that would feel like sunshine creeping under his skin.  Cas would tell him to breathe deep and Dean would do it without question, would do almost anything Cas said because he knows Cas is one of the only people on this fucked-up planet that actually gives a shit whether Dean lives or dies.  Dean would do whatever that sweet voice says because he knows his best friend loves him, too.
He doesn’t want Robert to hold him down though.  He doesn’t want to be held with his hands above his head either.  That’d be too much like Luc.  Luc always likes to pin Dean down--usually while shoving something in him he doesn’t want anywhere near him and calling him a slut for it.  Sometimes he’s holding Dean so tight and putting so much of his own weight on top of Dean that the boy wonders if one day his ribs will just crack.  Luc probably wouldn’t stop even if they did.  He might even like it and press on Dean’s bruised body if he wants to hear more of the “funny noises” Dean makes in his agony--
“Sweetheart, just lemme hear your voice…” Oh God, it’s the only thing he wants right now.  That and maybe to not have been born, but no take-backsies on that so here they are, “What’s wrong?”
I hope this longer chapter can distract you from all this election and 15x18 stress at least for a little bit.  I'm going to aim for releasing a chapter every week so let's hope I'm not overestimating myself :))) As always MIND THE TAGS, this chapter isn't as graphic as others but there's still some rough stuff.
Dean grabbed the baby monitor from the counter and dragged Cas down the hallway to the bathroom across the hall instead of the master bath so the lights wouldn’t bother the babies.  Shoulders bumping, Dean and Cas brushed their teeth together.  Dean grinned and hip-checked Cas and Cas’s glare dissolved into laughter which only seemed to encourage Dean further.  Cas spit first, rinsing and glancing in the mirror at the sunny grin that played on Dean’s lips.  And, though Dean quirked a surprised brow, Cas found themself wrapping their arms around Dean’s ribs and hugging the man tightly when it was Dean’s turn to use the sink.  Ever since the second trimester, Cas always got more cuddly than usual after Dean and they were intimate and it looked as if that little perk had made a home for itself in Cas’s heart.
Cas rubbed their son’s little neck fold that pudged in his sleep, “I think we’ll spend the rest of our lives asking that very question, Dean.”
As always, Luc crowds in on Dean first.  Thick hands slither up to cup Dean’s jaw squashing their lips together and slipping his bossy tongue past Dean’s lips.  After the split second he needs to tamp down the flaming panic in his belly, Dean presses back as much as he can.  When Luc draws away, the dark glint in his eye makes him look like a lion sizing up a zebra.
” Cas says, voice warm enough to have Dean melting back into the bed a little where he and Jack are perched, “
All of a sudden, he feels too hot, the awesome feeling low in his belly boiling over and sizzling like a sparkler out to each of his limbs.  He groans loud and low and pulses in Cas’s light hold, come shooting out of him like a fountain, eyes rolling back into his head.  His hips give little aborted thrusts into Cas’s hand as he rides his wave until finally slumping into the bed.
He scoots Cas up into the bed, letting him take up the whole pillow as he sets him down.  Cas’s head lolls into the side of his chest before he can pull away.  Red-rimmed oceans turn up to him, still staring but blinking at least.
Castielle holds the cloth up in front of her, hoping it covers up something at least as she tries to keep her breath from stuttering.
Dean’s chest squeezes and flutters and about a million other weird spasms he doesn’t quite know the origin of.  Cas is still pressed right up against his side, and one of his best friend’s hands sneaks just under Dean’s shirt, making little soothing circles at the small of his back.  His furrowed brow and bruised, beautiful face looks at Dean and waits for whatever he wants to tell Sammy.  Maybe it’s the fucking landslide of a day, the fact that he’s running on no sleep and breakfast for dinner, or maybe it’s just that Dean can’t think of a single thing in the world that he wants that’s not right here in this room...but Dean doesn’t want to die anymore.
Cas squeezes his arms, drawing them in even closer.  Both of their hips hitch at the tease of friction, Cas’s own hardness lining up beside Dean’s.
The boy lets out a long exhale and nuzzles against his t-shirt, both of Dean’s arms coming up to wrap around his best friend.  Cas’s hand starts to go limp where it rests on the rise and fall of his stomach.
Dean wants to scream.  He even wobbles on shaky legs to a stand, ready to give the whole attic a piece of his mind—
“You look really, really different with glasses, Dean,” Jack smiles, taking the hand he doesn’t need but Dean still offers to hop up into the van.  Climbing in after him, Dean gives the kid a playful shove and a
Even if Luc just wants to beat him, he’ll kill him.  Just accidentally, he’ll do it.  If all those cuts open again...and Cas loses too much blood…Dean will have to watch Luc carry his corpse back out of the basement the way it entered: wrapped in that stupid fucking blanket and slung over Luc’s shoulder.
Finally, she draws back, letting the happy fuzziness in her veins manifest itself in a split-second smile, “I’m wonderful, Dean.”
Cas shuffled in their t-shirt and boxers out to the kitchen, eyes half lidded and not quite focused yet.  Cas squinted and blinked back when they turned the light above the sink on and filled up their glass under the tap.  The whoosh of the faucet felt entirely too loud in the quiet of the small apartment.
Dean’s smirk splits into a wide grin and Castiel has a flashing memory of the nineteen-year-old, cocky kid he first met when they were in college together.  His chest squeezes in affection at the thought.  Now a forty-year-old doctor, Dean’s eyes still glimmer at Castiel like they have every day for the last two decades.
Cas is moving into Dean’s space in an instant, wrapping his arms around the older boy and drawing him into Cas’s warm body.  Placing a small kiss just behind his ear, Cas murmurs and hushes Dean who knows he’s squeezing way too hard but physically can’t let go.
Charlie laughs, “You can say that again. Hey! Maybe I should write a fic but instead of Dr. Sexy turning into a werewolf it’s Dr. Wang and Dr. Piccolo has to help her find
He’s not sure what it is with Cas and backing him up against doors, but Dean sure as fuck doesn’t complain when that’s exactly what they do as soon as they cross the front door’s threshold.
“Daddy!” She gasps, eyes going wide and she whispers, “Of course not! Nobody but the prince is supposed to touch me...
Like he’s trying not to startle Bambi, Sammy slowly leans down and picks up the closest notebook to the top with a gentle look.
Slow motion turns to flash-flood-fast and suddenly Dean can’t move quick enough.  His hands fumble with the buttons of the cordless, thumbs slipping in all different directions even though he doesn’t know what he’s looking for.
Sam turns back around first, through the glass doors, back into the busy hall, and Dean starts after him, a hand already twitching toward his holster, sparing Cas a look from over his shoulder.
The coffee will never be black enough, honey will never be sweet enough, beer will never be strong enough, eyes will never be blue enough, lips never full enough, no one will stand close enough to him, not the way Castiel did, not with the innocence of someone who simply wanted to be near him and didn't adhere to social conventions.
Shutting his eyes to calm his own nerves, Sam relaxes into the pew, sliding down in its worn, glossy wood, and sighs before asking, “... did the screaming help, at least?”
Something burns bright in his middle, pulling up toward his head without hurting somehow, then lightning strikes around them, setting several small fires on dry grass that catches too quickly, and the glass of all the car windows, mirrors, and lights blow out.
Castiel gives him a very dry look, and begs, "please do not parrot me, Dean, or this will take substantially longer to sort."
If his father had lived to see the day Dean made a mixtape like that for a man-shaped Heavenly Angel - Dean can't even think about it further than that without bile stinging his throat.
"Be happy?" Dean fills in, cocking a brow, "Make a nice life for myself with a nice little lady? I bet I could, Sam. I believe you, I'm not being an asshole right now, I believe you, but it wouldn't be the same kinda happy, it'd be different, and I don't want a different kind. How the fuck is anyone gonna compare, Sam? How much of a dick would I really have to be to let someone else come to know and love me when I know damn well that they will always be a second choice?"
"I can't drive," he admits to her, looking down, over the round of his shoulder to her, "I'm fucked up. Will you drive me somewhere?"
. There is stubble in this equation other than his own, and that’s new, and terrifying, and should be wholly unwelcome, but every synapse in his brain dedicated to pleasure is telling him otherwise.
When that Cas was marching into his death without hesitation, Dean respected him, wanted to save him - but now that his own Castiel was headed to the gallows, all he could feel was anger?
She's stunned for a second, and then she asks him, "you think you'd've been happy with him, like that?"
He casts his arms about, encapsulating the entire campus beyond them, “she took my seat beside you at every meal, she sat in on meetings I’d not known were being held, every spare moment you had, you spent with her in privacy, and I kept forgiving it, I kept forgetting it, I kept letting it slide because ‘she’s mourning,’ you said, ‘she’s scared,’ you said, as though I wasn’t mourning or frightened! ‘She needs me,’ you told me, but when I gave you the same sentiment, you seemed - disgusted. Or disappointed - I don’t know! You wouldn’t talk to me!”
Diamonds fall in quick succession down both sides of Castiel’s face, and he’s laughing amiably, but Dean’s chest is so tight, and heavy, he can’t fathom how he’s even still standing.
So, he doesn’t speak about it, because speaking about it will only solidify it more, make it real, and he can’t have that. He just can’t. He can’t have it be any more real than it was, he needs degrees of separation from it all just to keep moving one foot in front of the other.
“Wish I knew. But now we don't have a choice, so - it's in him, and it's not gettin’ out. And we've gotta kill ‘im, Dean. And you need to see it—the whole damn thing, how bad it gets—so you can do it different.”
When Sam sees him next, of course he asks, “Dean? Where’s -” and Dean needs to stop him before he says anymore.
Dean knows that, as he does it - as he says it, he knows it’s not right, that it’s not real the way he knows Castiel wishes it were - but it’s all that’s left that he can do or say that feels like fixing anything at all, and he has to do something.
Noticing that Castiel’s eyes are getting glassy, Dean’s heart rate climbs; Castiel being this vulnerable, and earnest bodes ill. But, there’s nothing for Dean to do but listen.
Swaying where he lands, Sam stumbles back and tries to place them, but he doesn’t recognize where they are. Wherever it is, it’s high up where the air is thin, with overgrown, dark grass undulating under the whipping wind for what looks like miles of uninhabited hill and valley in every direction.
“And I know it’s not enough,” he adds, eyes drifting shut as if in death, “I know there is no amount of penance that will put this to rest. I promised I would help. I promised I would not be in the way. I promised I would do all I could, and I failed. I kept failing. I’m prideful, Dean. You know this. And I couldn’t take the wounds to my ego anymore - I began to turn you away before you asked for anything at all because I knew how it would end, how you would only hate me more for however I failed you next, and you - you must have felt me turn inward, away. You left me, Dean, but I left you first.”
There’s a magic-laced bullet, an arcane spell, or a rune-carved blade, or his hands - his useless fucking hands should be capable of so much more than trembling - there has to be a loophole somewhere, because there always is, there has to be a way to make all of this stop -
him, even though he knew all the fucked up, ugly shit in him, Cas wanted in for the long fuckin' haul despite the baggage, despite Dean acting like a huge dick all the time, despite there not being lots of hope for something like that, because Dean constantly pushed him away...
Passing his lips and nose through the dusting of dark chest hair at eye-level with him, Dean breathes Castiel in, and comes to pinch one nipple with his left hand while he suckles the other into his mouth.
Dean, weak at the knees, lips criminally swollen, face flushed, hair mussed and harder than he’s ever been in his life, turns slowly to scowl at Sam.
He’s shocked, and at the mention of each name he thinks - maybe it broke Castiel’s heart, seeing him love other people. How many times has he broken Castiel’s heart?
begun exploring the spectrum of human emotion really recently; it could be that you feel, you know… intensely bonded with him, or something.”
What sounds like hundreds of cherry bombs going off has them stumbling away from each other, and frantically looking about.
of Dean - but more than all of those reasons, the thought that he would misunderstand me simply because the words don’t exist…”
Castiel has his own summoning sigil, as it turns out, and Dean is inexplicably bothered by how pretty it looks, painted on the drive in sanctified oil.
Visibly struggling for the right words, Castiel moves his arms in an indistinct gesture around his chest, and tells him, “he carries a… a despairing... anthem - o-of such calamitous love for the world, for all he knows and all he has yet to learn, it is a song I recognize somehow, and when he nears me, when the music of him comes closer, I feel some timeless distance dissolving from within me. Some unknown part of myself disappears, and another is risen over a chasm that I didn’t know was there until he bridges it back together, with only his nearness. This is what I must have recognized in Hell... how the nearness of him effects me.”
Castiel is still trying to catch his breath; his exposed neck and torso are still covered in hickeys, his nipples are pert, his abdomen is still twitching, and his cock is still hard.
Lost in buzzing endorphins, Dean hesitates just long enough that Castiel’s eyes flicker back to his, and he repeats himself sternly; “Dean. Do you understand?”
He doesn’t know, and he figures he never will, because he’s not poking that sleeping bear for anything or anyone.
When one of them is hurt, the one more able always hefts the other's arm over their shoulders, and helps them across whatever finish line is so near; and he’s happy to do that for Castiel, he’s not angry, not really, but he can’t stand the fear of this formal 'goodbye.' His heart can't take that shit anymore.
“I apologize,” Castiel announces softly, drawing in Dean’s attention again, “I seem to have… upset you? Or caused you discomfort?”
The more comfortable Sam and Eileen get in their half-retirement, the more they try setting Dean up with nice women who smile warmly at him even when he's not looking, and swoon when he winks at them. Sam has evident trouble understanding why none of them stick.
He never felt like someone had been admiring him from afar, too frightened to just take their shot because they cared
He snaps a picture of it with his phone, and considers showing it to a jeweler at some point - maybe someone could make a pendent out of it, and he could keep it around his neck.
Eileen is quietly holding back tears from somewhere to Dean's right, and Sam looks like he might want to argue, but instead, his voice wobbles when he asks if he can hug Dean.
For all he’s struggling to breathe and articulate, Dean may as well have a literal garrote working his neck, “God in Heaven, Cas, it’s just - you’re so - you’re too -”
A group of vagrants find their way to the vigil, saying that they know Castiel by the name 'Steve,' and how he was a good friend, if a little bit odd, explaining that Cas lived with them at their makeshift camp for a long while; one man looks at Dean very sadly, and says, "never asked for nothin', spent every mornin' just tellin' us how glorious the new day would be. I'd wondered what happened to 'im."
"Dean..." she soothes him, rubbing his back with a wide circling pattern, "... tell me what's happening."
“Nuh-unh,” Dean answers, shaking his head and putting his drink down on a nearby table, “That’s - that was a travesty, what I just witnessed. Babes are fuckin’ wasted on you, Cas.”
Unable to take a deep breath in, Dean tries to focus more on what he knows he can do - what he’s good at (although, normally he would count breathing among the things he’s good at, that just doesn’t appear to be the case tonight).
Kaia looks at him like he might be touched, and comments, "that sounds like the opposite of a problem?"
Cas’ eyes snap to attention again, and his forehead wrinkles, “… I don’t understand that reference,” but he follows after Dean anyway.
Maybe only an hour or so later, Dean rides with Cas into the night, watches him get high enough to feel somewhat normal, and when morning comes, he can’t stop anything - he can’t stop himself, he can’t stop Risa, or Cas, or the monsters, or the Devil, or the carnage, or the end of the world.
Dazedly, Dean doesn’t actually think about his answer before nodding, mumbling, “yeah,” and leaning back in.
“What the fuck do you want me to do about it? He’s a grown fuckin’ man,” Dean’s counterpart argues, “I made my shit decisions, and he made his. I don’t
Readying himself for whatever cosmic bullshit he’s about to hear next, Dean sets his shoulders, and tries not to clench his hands; he wants Castiel to get to the fucking point, but Castiel doesn’t usually talk at such length. Whatever he’s saying now, it’s important, or he wouldn’t bother with it at all.
When Sam needs to go ring-shopping, Dean tags along, claiming it's a brother's right - obligation, even - to help him pick the right one - but when Sam is being wooed over emeralds, intimidated by cuts he doesn't understand the significance of, Dean pulls aside an engraver, and pays him in cash.
He considers saying something sarcastic, or brushing her off rudely, or denying it altogether, but he's very fucking sad, pretty fuckin' drunk, and he's still trying to be - whatever the fuck it is that Castiel thought he was.
Dean’s so ridiculously nervous about the whole thing that he almost misses the experience at first - he barely registers that he’s made contact when he does, but a beat after he closes the distance between them, he feels and hears Castiel hum contentedly against him, and that snaps him out of his panic-induced numbness.
With Castiel taking control of the basic motions, Dean's able to focus on breathing and laving at him, and it works - it works beautifully, and Dean's hands massage around Castiel's thighs, encouraging him to go deeper while he goes cross-eyed behind his shut eyelids.
The visiting hunters seemingly brought entire liquor stores with them too, though, so Dean rests easy knowing he won't be running low at any point in the night.
like that, and I didn't even have time to - I had time, obviously, but it's like my whole body just - he was so
“It's been more than a long time,” Dean exhales, his face falling as he withdraws his arm, and they approach the Impala, “Years.”
Dean Prime storms off after that, and Cas gives Dean a loaded look before he’s tugged in another direction for preparations and repairs to some of the lights on the nearest cars.
- and he knows he's moaning, and he knows he's supposed to be embarrassed about it, but he can't find the energy to devote to shame anymore, he's too focused on sucking Cas' tongue into his mouth, and running his own over the flat of Cas' and making Cas gasp, and writhe, and grip the fabric of his shirt like he's scared they're going to fall.
Maybe it was the fact that Cas wasn’t a human that made it feel so different. Maybe what he felt for Cas - in that alternate timeline - maybe it was carnal, or some kind of religious experience, or spiritual journey, and that’s why it’s so markedly different, but Dean knows deep down that it’s more to do with who Cas is, fundamentally.
“You should mind you’re fuckin’ mouth,” his future self threatens, coming nearer to him, “You have no idea what I’ve been through. You should be following my every fuckin’ order, you idiot, you should be thanking me on your knees for bearing this reality in your stead, so you can learn from it. Don’t fuckin’ question me.”
Dean had been sleeping in the library for the last week, trying to avoid that long corridor, and all of its identical doors, because he knew that he could be blindfolded and spun on the very axis of the Earth before stumbling drunk and in the dark down that hall, and he’d never miss Castiel’s door.
One wide hand insinuates itself under the hem of Dean’s weathered flannel, calloused fingers pressing into his left hip possessively while the other hand glides over his pec, and shoulder to the back of his neck, pinky finger teasing the sensitive skin just under the back of his cotton collar, and thumb brushing the fine hairs at the base of Dean’s skull.
“What do you think ‘dayenu,’ means, Dean?” Castiel is asking as Chastity pulls him up by his trench coat.
“Is it the humanity of it that draws you in, after hunting?” Castiel inquires, casual as anything, “Having someone trust you to treat them kindly, and offer them pleasure must be reassuring of your own humanity after such a long time of being used as a weapon.”
Among the makeshift family, Dean turns out to be the best at changing diapers; it is both a curse and a blessing, and Eileen vows everlasting gratitude to Dean that he threatens to call upon her for some dark day, but never will.
“And you better fuckin’ not, seeing how rich that’d be coming from the abomination I picked outta the fuckin’ reject pile - the one mistake I did fuckin’ make.”
“I-I’m in love with Dean! “ Castiel says again, his voice duplicating itself, sounding like a gospel choir all around them, but somehow also only inside Sam’s head; Castiel’s body and face only growing more and more panicked by the admission, manifestations of miracles keep moving through his body, shifting gears at a worrying rate, “I am in love with Dean! I’m in love with him! I feel
The clean smell of pollen and a trail of little green blades of grass followed Luc down to the basement one night.
Cas glances down at their coated stomach and then back up at Dean.  He’s biting back a smile, a blush coloring his cheeks.
“Oh,” Jack simply shrugs, the little smile growing on his face as he looks between the two of them.  He knows he said something funny but can’t seem to figure out what and that kind of dopey confusion only makes Dean laugh and squeeze harder.  As their chuckling dies down again, a gentle, munching quiet fills the space and has Dean’s chest lighter than it’s been in a while.  Dean catches Cas’s eye again.  There’s a familiar spark burning behind those baby blues that has Dean’s warmth spreading down to his fingertips and toes.  Maybe if they can plop the headphones on Jack and face him towards the wall with some paper to scribble on like they did last time, him and Cas can steal some time together-- “Hey!  Can I teach you two a song now?”
“Nuh-uh, none of that,” As he slides into place beside Cas, his friend’s body instantly leans into his.  Warmth crackles like hot embers in his belly, “I just didn’t want to jostle you around and make you hurt anymore ‘s all.  You’re my...Cas, alright?  I’ll sit by you anytime you damn well want.  All you gotta do is ask...unless I’m on the john--then you might have to wait a minute.”
“Okay, Cas,” Dean smiles in return, popping back up to his feet. He rummages the sunscreen out of his bag and squirts a heaping dollop onto his palm.  For a second, a split one, Castielle wonders if he uses such a generous amount of the lotion when he jerks off.  She shakes the traitorous thought from her brain, “You want some?”
The crack of the first door has Dean springing from the bed and scrambling to tuck Cas back up in the blankets.  Cas squirms, “Dean?”
When he glances over Jack’s expression matches his tone perfectly, “I’m not sure.  Couple of months, maybe?  How come?”
Dean’s fingers brush over the penciled in lines along the doorway of his childhood bedroom as he rounds the corner at the top of the stairs and shuffles off to the master on the left.  Since no lights were switched on downstairs, and the warm glow of the lamp isn’t pouring out from under the door crack, Cas must’ve called it a night already.  Maybe he can convince Cas to go a round with him in the morning instead?  Give the angel a real nice wake up call with a hand down his boxers..?  So many possibilities.
“But--” Cas’s voice is warm and muffled against his t-shirt, “What he does, it hurts most of the time...
Again, she knows full well that she’s all...secure down there, and no one would be the wiser.  She knows that.  She does.  As clearly as she can see the light freckles dotting the bridge of Dean’s nose, she can see that she looks absolutely flat under the flowery pattern of her bikini bottoms.  Just another thing people wouldn’t give a second glance at...but still.
Cas doesn't realize they’ve clamped their legs down tight to hold Dean in place until their fuzzy brain floats back to the surface.  When did they close my eyes?  Dean is staring down at Cas with dark moon eyes and shaky breaths stuttering from his lips.  Cas feels utterly weightless and shivers a little each time an aftershock has them contracting around Dean.
And after three solid minutes of puppy eyes, Dean lets Jack feed him a few bites of his sandwich and is rewarded with the biggest smile of the day so far.  His skin gets a little prickly and the tips of his ears pinken, but Sammy and his mom hardly bat an eye at their weird shit anymore.
The boy’s little throat bobs and his giant eyes drop to the ground, shoulders scrunching up to his burning pink ears.  In a voice that’s more of a sob than Dean can stand take, Jack mumbles, “Y-Yes...Daddy.”
Dean jerks upright, blinking and blindly feeling at his side for the little body that was nestled up to him the last time he was aware of anything.  The sheets and cover are crumpled and messily pushed back, and Dean tries to calm the fuck down.  Jack has the right to go to the bathroom or whatever without Dean losing his shit, and if the kid comes back right now while Dean is doing just that, big grey eyes will go guilty and that’s the last thing Dean wants.
“Daddy just wants to take care of you, baby boy,” Castiel said firmly but kindly, “So unless you tell me your color is red, Daddy is going to keep telling you how good you’re doing.  Do you understand?”
Dean’s eyes slide open and the wide-eyed, flushed boy above him nearly makes his heart skip a beat.  Did he do that?  Is Cas like this...because of him?
“I know, baby, it’s been a long time,” Cas says gently, carding their fingers through his hair, “That’s why I’m going to give you two options.”
He curled and uncurled his toes where they brushed against the armrest.  Castiel had sprawled out lengthwise across their couch, computer starting to burn his thighs where it was perched on his lap.  He yawned and drew his knees up, balancing the laptop between his chest and legs hoping that would adequately vent its little fan.  Just a couple more sentences--
It felt magnificent with the slightest edge of discomfort that had Cas already a little shaky.  Suddenly, the discomfort started to morph into the all-too-familiar twinge that usually meant--
Well, here it is.  Thank you all so much for months of your time and energy!  It's meant so much to me to hear from you guys as I tried this little experiment :' )  I hope you enjoyed reading this whole thing as much as I enjoyed writing it!!
She holds out an album not packaged in a plastic case, but one that feels like an envelope of thick cardboard.  It’s all black with a triangle in the middle, a beam of light going in one side and a rainbow bursting out of the other.
Having someone else’s warmth tucked right up next to him, to wake up to someone else’s breathing tickling his neck--it’s Heaven and sunshine and a million other things Dean had begun to believe he’d only imagined in some fever dream and not experienced in his life before Luc.  It honestly freaks him the fuck out...but, like, in the best way possible.  With Cas, it’s almost like he can feel his skin again.  He didn’t even realize he’d lost that sensation until a warm hand touches against his or fluffy dark hair brushes his cheek when Cas inches closer, seeking warmth.
“What’s this, sweetheart?” Castiel’s feet carried him closer and closer of their own volition, like a cartoon rascal floating toward the scent of a pie cooling on the windowsill.  Both a sticky sweet treat waiting to be devoured.
Dean stood, eager, before Castiel as the shorter man set the clothes on the bedside table.  He gave Dean a quick peck on the cheek that made his baby giggle before making quick work of pulling off the purple Henley. It was soon replaced with the crop top, and Dean poked at the Bat Signal where it sat over the top of his tummy.  As Dean entertained himself watching his daddy dress him, Castiel shimmied his baby boy out of his jeans, boxers, and socks.  Dean was already half hard and straining against the smooth fabric of the panties by the time Castiel had them seated on his hips.  As Bad Company started filtering through the small speaker, Castiel felt that he was nearly as deep in his own space as Dean was in his.
, feel so bad yourself,” she says.  A bubble of laughter pops from her lips and she beams back at him.  With her hands now steady on Dean’s shoulders, he pistons his hand, letting her own slick coat the way.  Cas throws her head back on a cry that makes her throat bob and the cords of her neck tighten, “Dean!”
Dean chuckles, pulling a hefty-ass box of books until it rests in front of a couple of the other boxes.  As good a place to start as any.  Jack just plops on the floor, still fixing Dean with curious eyes.  It’s a look he used to get in the basement sometimes, but the storm clouds aren’t there like they used to be.
Cas’s eyes fall to the violent shaking of his arms, from the clenching of his fists they can see how hard he’s fighting his own muscles.
Cas let their hot breath glide over hot scarlet skin, smirking when it twitched.  They could see Dean start to open his mouth in a plea, but Cas cut him off by trailing the wide, flat expanse of their tongue up the underside’s pulsing vein.  Dean gasped sharply, palms growing sweaty against Cas’s.
His own hips start rutting against the back of her skirts until his clothed hardness with the sinful curve of her ass.  The inevitable way Deanna
He didn’t talk to Jesse or Garth, sure, but then he talked to Donna and Charlie.  But now not Sammy…?
“Are you two done with your eye-fucking, hmm?” Luc leers, “‘Cause it’s time to get this show on the road.”
” Dean and Cas simultaneously hush, eyes glued above them as though they’ll gain Superman’s x-ray vision if they can only focus a little bit harder.
Castiel did his best to keep his hold in his baby’s hair tight in the way that Dean loved and not vice-like, but with each stroke of Dean’s tongue squirming further into Castiel’s folds it was becoming an increasingly difficult task.
It’s Jack’s low whine that breaks Dean’s gaze away and his eyes fall to tear-filled little saucers.  Jack has a vice grip on his shirt and hiccups as a cry, “D-Don’t get shot, Dean!  I’ll go to faucet care...Please—don’t wanna lose you, too…”
Dean can’t help it when his eyes fall back to the obscenely large bulge pushing against Cas’s zipper.
The next time he squirms, however, a nice little zing runs down his legs when the plug nudges perfectly on his prostate before it loses the angle.  He scrunches a bar napkin in his fist, biting back the whine that almost escapes him.
“Dean…” Mary’s own voice lilts down like she’s talking to a two-year-old when Dean knows she’d cry her eyes if she knew half the things that he done with Luc in the last seven years.
There’s a playful lilt to her voice as she says, “...Can I have another piece of Halloween candy before I brush my teeth?”
At that instant they crook their middle digit, smoothing over the nub of his prostate with practiced precision.
Jack’s only lost his shit like this a few times.  The last time Dean can remember it happening was after Luc wanted some alone time with Jack in the Playroom.  Cas had been the one to help him calm down enough to let Dean clean up Luc’s mess before the kid conked out for the night. Dean remembers that better than he remembers his own middle name.
Castiel tipped their foreheads together, closing his eyes.  He tried with all his might to will Dean all the infinite love his husband usually squirmed away from when Castiel tried to verbalize it.  He felt a wash of gratitude at the fact that this incredible man trusted him so much.  It had taken a lot to get here.
Kissing the shell of her ear, he whispers, “Have you ever touched your special princess place, love?”
Cas still isn’t looking his way, but Dean’s eyes zero in on the teasing way their slender fingers circle the rim of the glass the bartender sets in front of them.  Skin tingling with each second that all Dean can see of Cas’s fucking gorgeous face is their profile, his fingers tap on the neck of his beer bottle impatiently.
Dean’s gaze drops to his friend’s face, half obscured by a stiff bicep.  His face is still near expressionless, which is why the soft words spoken against Luc’s t-shirt startle Dean even more.
The sheriff’s eyes soften like they did last time she talked to Jack but there’s a tension tightening her jaw just below the surface.  Dean’s pretty sure he’s not gonna like whatever the answer is.
“Yeah?” Dean snaps, “And he coulda killed you, Cas!” When, Cas’s smile fades slightly, Dean sighs, “Look, I’m sorry Cas.  I’m just...
Cas’s hands rounded over the globes of Dean’s ass and encouraged his hips to start rutting--though their knees were starting to get sore.
Also, I got a question about my chapter release schedule, so here's the tentative plan: I will be releasing a new chapter every Wednesday evening, and I'll let you know the week beforehand if I anticipate any problems.
“Was it a trying day, love?” Castiel asked.  But Dean didn’t meet the remark with the usual snappy one-liner, he just nodded against the hand in his hair and let his cheek fall against Castiel’s dress pant-covered thigh.  Castiel found himself already missing his husband’s usual sarcasm, “Did you and Garth get into an argument?”
The pen hovers over the page.  Should he?  It feels really weird to even think about, let alone jot it down in black and white.
No.  No, that’s not right.  His dad didn’t—his dad wouldn’t have done something like...Dean would remember something like
seen before draws across her face and he can’t help the matching one that crosses his own.  She pulls his lips right to hers, rocking their mouths together all slow and reverent-like. Dean’s skin tingles.
Cas’s chair squeaks behind him, the rustle of his friend scratching the back of his neck the only other noise besides Dean wiping down the dishes.  Cas has been doing that a lot, too.  Fidgeting.  Honestly, he didn’t know the dude even knew how to fidget. The boy sighs again, “Yes.  I know, but…”
He reaches to unload the bag and Luc snags it back, smiling when it’s just out of Dean’s reach, “Come on, sweet cheeks.  Not even a ‘hello’ kiss?”
charades.  Nonetheless, as soon as he sees a sliver of an opening, he asks what other kinds of Christmas-y stuff Cas has in mind.  They try making a Christmas tree out of whatever crap they’ve got lying around and the thing is, well, it’s pathetic at best and depressing at worst.
“Come on,” Dean tries, drawing her impossibly closer and kissing along her jaw until Cas is melting once again, “I like your noises.  They’re adorable.”
“Dean,” Cas put a firm hand over Dean’s heart to halt their husband before he could twist out of Cas’s arms, “I still want to as well, I just--I didn’t think you’d be aroused anymore after…” Cas gestured to the dark patches on their t-shirt, the tips of their ears turning pink.
Jack’s eyes are bright and curious even though it’s only a little after sun-up.  Staring down at the steaming toast, his brow furrowed in thought, before turning an overly serious gaze back to Dean.
Dean’s hands let his ass cheeks go, one curling under his chest while the other threads with Cas’s most lube-free fingers where they rest on his waist.  Cas squeezes his hand.
Dean’s hands came to rest on Castiel’s shoulders, as Castiel often instructed him to do, and twirled a lock of hair that curled at Castiel’s ear.  Dean started letting out cute, rumbly giggles as Castiel peppered his tummy with nips and kisses where it was left uncovered by the crop top.
The tension in his body snaps like a twig and he loosens under his friend’s touch.  He licks his lips, “I can’t lose you, Cas.”
“Castiel’s the angel of Thursdays.  At least, that’s what Mother always said.  There’s a whole story she used to tell me about him.  I haven’t thought about it in a long time, but I always liked how her voice sounded when she told it to me.”
The stinging in Dean’s eyes turns to burning, and suddenly his chest is spasming around a breath he can’t quite draw in.
“Sure, man.  And when you give Dean his ask if he wants to be your valentine,” the big dork laughs, hauling Jack and himself over to a cupboard that Dean assumes houses the sprinkles, “He’ll get a kick out of it.”
” there’s another sob like Cas’s heartache is trying to literally strangle him.  It’s a sound that has Dean angrier than he’s ever been at a God he didn’t start to believe in until he met Cas.  He hates how much Cas is hurting—but he hates it even more that Mrs. Shurley is probably right about him, “
Luc’s body stiffens and for a split-second Dean’s pretty sure he just screwed things up with his dumbass thoughts--like always.  But then Luc is practically melting against him, groaning in delight.
even.  Especially when Cas’s legs tangle with his under the table and he shoots Dean that show-stopping shadow of a smile, biting into his sandwich with a soft scrunch of his nose like his isn’t the answer to all those prayers Dean stopped saying years ago.
“I-I just,” Dean gulps down a noise that feels like it’s clawing in his chest, “You didn’t say you loved me back and--and then you rolled away and I felt so cold a--” Dean hiccups, cheeks flushed and mortified that he’s letting any of this be put into words.  But it feels like a volcano bubbling inside him, unstoppable, “and you keep wanting to leave me and I can’t--I can’t be here without you--”
As thick fingers undo the strings of her bikini, Castielle can’t decide if she’s an accidental-genius or a masochist.  She shivers when cool sunscreen is dripped onto her back, an exhale punching out when warm, broad hands start to work the sunscreen into her skin.  Dean’s palms knead into her shoulder blades, rolling with the curves and turning her muscles to pudding.  His hands skim down to the flesh of her lower back, thumbs grazing down her spine and leaving hot trails in their wake.  Arousal starts to pool low in her belly and she feels a tiny pulse at the root of her.
“Whoa, whoa,” Jack’s face is getting redder and redder by the second, and Dean brushes an eyelash off his cheek, “Easy, tiger.  You gotta take a breath sometimes.”
A hiccupped laugh tumbles from Dean’s mouth and his grin is shy, “B-Before we left, Sir.  In the shower.  W-Wanted to make this last. Can ya blame me?”
“Ca--” he bites his lip before he can whimper the name he’s not supposed to know, “Baby, please, please…”
“K-Keep—Cas, please,” Dean hiccups and buries his face in the crook of Cas’s neck, muffled as he whimpers, “More.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! This was a rough one, but stay tuned!  Let me know what you think in the comments :)
The cold, wet sand squishes between her toes.  The water is a little hazy but mostly clear, little pebbles sparkling up at her and she takes her first step in.  A chill runs up her legs and causes a shudder to rattle her spine. Dean, in all his dripping glory, is jog-splashing up to her and she grunts for him to slow down before he sloshes all over her.  He throws his head back as a belly-deep laugh rumbles through him.
“I don’t want you to hurt your knees, and linoleum is nearly as bad as tile,” Cas said, situating the pillow in place in front of Dean.
When Dean plummets back down to Earth, Cas’s arms are still wrapped around his shoulders, hot breath panting against his collarbone.  He kisses whatever square of skin he can find with his eyes still squeezed shut and bliss vibrating all the way down to his goddamn bones.
“Holy hell, Cas,” he pulls away with a gasp, slumping back against his seat like he just ran a marathon.  Bright dilated eyes and a wide grin are bright and sunny on Dean’s face.
very pretty,” Castiel chuckles, “And if you’re going to be the princess, who should Daddy pretend to be?”
Hand sliding in a little further once again, Dean finally meets the sticky, soft-hard mess in his boxers.  God, yeah.  This is a much better train of thought.
Dean squeaked when Castiel finally dipped two fingers into the warm crease, tracing down the sensitive skin until his fingers caught on Dean’s fluttering hole—well, actually the base of the plug burrowed in his hole.
“Caa…” Dean grunts, eyes squeezing against the brightness of the room before falling open.  An unfocused, emerald gaze meets Castiel’s and a smile pulls at plush lips.
“Yesyesyes,” Dean hummed, kissing a line down to just above Cas’s knee.  They shivered at the wet touch, “Gonna be so good for you.”
His ass is still presented like a feast in the air.  Cas glances down at his heavy cock that’s still throbbing and making a mess of the towel below.  They massage Dean’s hips and ask, “Did you...climax, love?”
His breathing is raspy at best and choked at worst, so he lets Sammy guide him to the car, a protective grip still keeping them hip-to-hip.  Jack squeezes his hand and Dean squeezes back, but he doesn’t look down.
Jack tucks in a little closer to Dean, as close as the seat belt will let him anyway.  He’s looking at the hospital, too, and it doesn’t take their weird mind-reading thing to know the kid is missing Cas, too.
“Good, very good,” Dean mimics, pressing his smile into Cas’s cheek even though it was meant to be a kiss.
“I think you’re going to be happy with your decision, love,” Cas says, dotting a gentle line of kisses from his shoulder blade to his waist and rubbing a soothing hand over his hairy thigh, “Now, can you spread your legs a little wider for me?  Good boy.”
He won’t look Dean in the eyes as he gathers up his two trays and heads for the cafeteria doors, but Dean doesn’t miss the little over-the-shoulder glance Gabe gives him before disappearing around the corner.
“Mhmm,” Cas sighs around a hint of a smile, giving the faintest buck of their hips, “Perhaps when your energy returns, you could demonstrate to me the ways of the Magic Dragon.”
“You alright, sunshine?” Dean asks, keeping his voice as smooth and quiet as possible.  Looking her up and down, he sees no outward signs that the guy did more than invade her space and touch her glasses.  She nods, but continues to stare off over her shoulder, “Words, Cas.”
Castielle didn't even heard Dean’s sandy footsteps approaching, didn’t even realize he was right on her heels until a warm hand is at the small of her back and she sees hazel eyes in her periphery, darting between her and the sarong.
A delicate hand with slender digits falls over Dean’s, entwining their fingers and ceasing his restless tapping.  Warmth like when Dean first crawls into a hot bath floods his body, wrapping him in a calmness that he wishes he didn’t feel.  He’s weak, so weak, and he hates himself for letting Cas
“I love you, Dean,” Cas hums, placing a gentle kiss on the ridge of Dean’s cheekbone.  The hunter feels his cheeks flame again and buries his face in the angel’s neck.
And maybe he’d press his face into Dean’s neck like he always does right before they do their stuff together.  Cas would skim the soft point of his nose up to Dean’s jaw, pressing a kiss to the bolt, to his cheek.  He can almost feel Cas’s smile at the way Dean shivers--because he knows he always shivers at neck stuff whether he’ll admit it or not--and the closed-mouth chuckle that would buzz against his skin.
His chest is still stretched so tight, his limbs still a shaky heap when Cas draws back slightly to kiss each of his cheeks.
“What? I thought you liked my singing, baby doll,” Luc chuckles, rounding the table to where Dean stands with his hands in his pockets, “Don’t I get a kiss?”
The car jolts beneath them, sending Jack and Dean rolling along the floor.  Cas screams bloody murder, clawing at Luc’s face, and wiry arms try to tear Goliath to shreds.
She’s draped a long dress over her frame.  As Castiel absorbs all the details, he feels the heat of Deanna’s expectant eyes on him.  The dress is bright in exaggerated pastel purples and pinks with meshy, decorative flowing arms attached to capped sleeves that remind him of the material florists wrap bouquets in.  Pink ribbons crisscross the bodice down from the middle of a wide collar that extends to sleeves.  If Castiel had to guess, the collar will leave Deanna’s sharp freckled collarbones bare.  At the waist, where the flowing skirt meets the pink ribbons, a plastic cameo with a cartoon princess completes the costume.  And, swinging from Deanna’s fingertips is a glimmering, plastic tiara.  The front pattern seeming to twist into a bedazzled heart with swirls.
.  Y-Yeah…” With a little chuckle that would’ve had Dean’s cheeks flaming if he were in his right mind, Cas returns to rocking Dean’s fucking world, “M-More...ple--”
“Do you like it, Daddy?” A blush that highlights her freckles stains her cheeks.  Castiel is only human and can’t help but draw her in close and press their lips gently together.
With a raised brow, Castiel snaps the band of the panties for emphasis.  Her hole squeezes like a vice around his fingers before going loose again.  She shudders and nods, cheek pink and exquisite.
“Yeah, uh, yeah,” she looks between everyone in the room for a second before setting the cap tucked under her arm back on her head, “Of course, Mrs. Shurley.”
A weak whimper shatters through Dean’s messy brain, and he whips his head around, realizing that he’d actually walked a few feet from the chair and met his mom and Sammy halfway.  The second whimper has Dean meeting huge grey eyes with tears brimming on Jack’s lower lashes.  The kid is biting his bottom lip white, arms and blanket wrapped around him like a shield as he rocks back and forth in place.
Solid arms wrap around Dean once again, and he buries his face in Sammy’s shoulder, “Dean...nothing’s okay.  But it’s gonna be.  We’re gonna
“Y-Yeah,” Lips are sour when he licks them, the shitty taste in his mouth grows more and more inescapable as the rest of him decides to calm the fuck down.  He drops his own head to the side, resting right on top of Jack’s as they both stare at the wall, “Your singing’s gettin’ better.”
.  Hopefully, now having been fed after their third time waking up, both babies would sleep until at least 5:00am or so.  Fingers crossed.
He surveys the rest of the kitchen from where his ass is seated on the countertop.  It feels like all he does these days is take in new information and try to sort it all out.  It’s all new but also not and that kinda freaks him the fuck out if he thinks about it too long.
He almost startles when the bursting drums of “Immigrant Song” start to rattle the car.  Sammy, sitting in the passenger seat, cranks it a little louder.  Jack is grinning and grabbing Dean’s arm and looking like he’s about ready to explode into confetti.  The little guy’s energy is, honestly, infectious and the liquor store slips out the back door like it was never even there.
Cas works their finger into a gentle rhythm that has Dean’s eyes fluttering shut, head dropping limply to his chest.  They suck a blooming red mark into the lingering pinkness from the early smack, painting the colors of a carnation across their baby’s backside.
“Shuddup,” Dropping a quick kiss to the pulse point there, he rises from the bed.  After peeling off the $7.99 sticker off the old CD player, they’d gotten the thing all plugged into the outlet behind their dresser where the player now sits.  It’s maybe Dean’s favorite object in the whole apartment, “What do you feel like listenin’ to?”
His legs burn, like all the blood and nerves in his body are screaming to run, to help.  But his muscles aren’t moving, so he stays.  Things are even hazier, though, as the
1.) I just watched last night's episode and it was had so much domestic fluff (unforutnately, w/o Cas) that I didn't know I needed, so I decided to post another chapter in honor of The End of The End.
That whooshing wet sound is there again, Jack’s cheek ticking in discomfort under the tape.  Dean doesn’t have to guess--he knows what it feels like to be pissed on, but he also knows that this time it’ll actually be more than worth the cost.
It cracks through Dean like a wave and he’s off like a shot, all three of them scattering in different directions to gather their things.  Dean keeps trying to meet Cas’s eye because
Cas nods dutifully, but the seriousness is somewhat undercut by the gorgeous mess his raven hair has become.
Now, Dean lies on the bed, in his boxers and no shirt.  He’d boiled water for a bath earlier since the tub’s faucet only ran ice-cold, stepping in when it still felt like it’d melt his skin.  He hadn’t wanted a trace of Luc left on him.  With his bleach-stained towel hung over the back of a chair and the slim headphones hugging his head, Dean lets himself drift.  He still has a few hours before Luc will be down.
sounds punch out of her with every rough brush against her p-spot as her white knuckles grasp the bedspread on either side of the towel.  Electricity is coiling low in his abdomen, the tingling of his spine settling at the root of his cock.  He won’t last much longer at this rate.
“Green,” Dean smirked, then tapped his hands on his knees and looked back up at Castiel, “See, Daddy?  I-I’m being a good boy and keeping my hands to myself until you tell me I can touch you—just like you said.”
Wrapping the little guy back up in his arms, Dean closes the remaining distance between them until Jack has his face squished between Dean’s pillow and neck.  There’s only a hiccup or two more before Jack relaxes again, warm puffs of breath evening out where they fall on Dean’s collarbone.  Dean makes slow circles over the kid’s shoulder blade, nudging his face into dark blonde hair that still smells like baby shampoo, “I gotcha, I gotcha.  You don’t gotta worry anymore, okay?”
His spouse’s lips pull away with an obscene pop, and Dean shivers at the feel of cooling saliva on his slit.
Dean sinks to his knees beside Luc’s thundering hand, pawing at the man’s waist and the growing lump in his jeans, “Luc, baby, let me take care of--”
Cas presses in even closer as their lips meet, sliding together with warm breath dusting their cheeks. It’s a long moment that Dean gets lost in, any of the day’s tension releasing from his muscles.
With a playful roll of his eyes, Castiel bridges the gap, squishing Jack in between them to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek.
A little smile twitches at the corner of Cas’s lips as he sits back in his own chair--much less slouchy than Dean.  Damn, Dean kinda wants to climb up on
“There we go,” he murmurs as Cas’s lashes flutter open, eyes bright but still unfocused.  Gently, he tucks her back in place in the bikini bottoms, palming her lightly to see the aftershocks jolt through her, “I gotcha, sunshine.”
Glancing over his shoulder, Dean searches out those familiar, dark waves or the glint of purple aviators.  His eyes scan twice over before he finds her, flannel and all.  But it isn’t just the paper dish of pretzels she’s carrying that catches his attention--it’s the dude talking to her.
They’d pushed the table into a corner and stacked the chairs in the dry tub, then they’d hauled the mattress down to the ground.  It was back before Cas stopped looking at him, so as soon as Dean’s walls had collapsed, his friend had pulled Dean down beside him and wrapped them in the scratchy blanket.
Dean hums, breathing in the chilly morning air and drawing Cas’s body a little closer to his.  At some point they must’ve shuffled around because now Cas was almost entirely tucked in next to Dean, head squished up under his chin like he’d tried to bury himself in the older boy’s chest.
“Mmm, look at you, cupcake,” Luc breathes wetly against Dean’s neck, “Look so good bent over the table like this…”
,” Dean’s knees turn to jelly and he stumbles to a seat in the chair before he faceplants onto the concrete, “He wants to keep you with him forever and ever.  So, what?  You’re just gonna let him find you cold and bleeding out on the floor one day?  You’ll probably shit yourself when you die and, to hurt our precious Dean’s feelings even more, he’s gonna have to clean up your filth, too.  That doesn’t make you a very good friend, now does it--”
Cas administers another light smack to the meat of Dean’s ass, his hole clenching around their tongue, a bone-deep shiver wracking through his body.  Cas kneads at his rosy cheek and draws back.
and Dean just really wants to hear more of his best friend’s voice, so he asks, “How are you even calling us anyway?  I thought your mom...”
“Cas,” A long, easy exhale sweeps right out of Dean’s lungs, and his eyes fall closed without him even realizing.
Before the spend even has a chance to get uncomfortably tacky, Castiel rolls to the side and grabs the baby wipes.  He cleans them with practiced swipes that are gentle yet efficient, tidying them up while still being mindful of Dean’s tender parts.  Tucking said tender parts back into his boxers, Castiel smiles at the sleepy blush now gracing Dean’s cheeks and the stoner smile tugging at his lips.  He scoots back up the man’s body, pressing a kiss over Dean’s heart as he does so because age has not just made him slow but also an utter sap.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, cupcake!” he shouts, one hand whipping out to the side in pride and the other hefting a large rolled up blanket over his shoulder, “Surprise!”
Sammy squints, starting to shake his head before a grin starts to pull at his lips, “Uh, yeah.  I think so.  We used to camp there sometimes when we were really little, right?”
“I dunno, maybe they could team up and take down enemies together,” he shrugs, fingers playing with the same thread in the blanket that’s been loose for years.  He mumbles, “They’re soulmates, man.  Just seems stupid for them to not at least hang out sometimes.”
Cas is only in a shirt and boxers, shivering from the drying sweat and the open patches of skin Dean had to lift the blanket off of to bandage.  When he’s all done, Dean tucks the kit back in its place and wraps his friend up in the scratchy felt like a burrito.  Cas squints at him in confusion as Dean steps out of the tub, steadying himself until the ground feels even under his feet again.  His friend squeaks when he reaches back in and scoops Cas up into his arms.  The other boy is startlingly light, and Dean resolves to feed him extra over the next few days and hopefully fatten him up a little.
easing an inch out—then sliding back in.  If it’s possible, Cas is shaking even harder than Dean, and that’s one hell of a high bar.
The soothing heat of tongue laves over the abused nub at the same time Cas’s pinching fingers play with the other sending two very different lightning bolts straight to his cock.  Speaking of cocks…the still functioning parts of Dean’s brain lights up when he once again recognizes the thick line pressing into his thigh.  Cas is rutting down against him, even as their concentration is almost entirely directed at biting him into oblivion.  He’s gotta give his baby props for really getting into character with this--Dean’s really gonna go all out with the angel/demon roleplay (yeah, Charlie got Cas hooked on that
Dean’s confused-puppy eyes looked between Cas’s face and chest before hurt realization crossed his features.
“Uh,” Luc never ever asked him what his notebooks were for, and Dean was never quite sure why.  He always figured that since Luc didn’t see bound paper as a threat, he simply didn’t give a shit what Dean did when he was down here when Luc wasn’t.  He’d never had to tell anybody what he wrote.  Or why.
He wanted Dean anyway. He wanted Dean quietly, unobtrusively, without expectation, and the wanting alone made him happy, because he was just that innately, organically selfless, and he's not coming back.
“It’s a panic attack, Castiel - you’re panicking,” Sam intercepts, confused about how or why an Angel would experience a panic attack, but glad that he can be useful in some way, “what’s going on? What were you doing when this started?”
"He was a good soldier," "he was a clean fighter," "he was a worthy opponent," "he was a warrior of unique make," "a better shield brother could not be imagined," and variations thereof - Dean wants to tell them to fuck themselves, to get out, that they're not welcome, but then one Angel approaches him with a stone in her hand, and says simply and plainly, "he was my brother."
He pulls away long enough to see fat tears falling from the corners of Cas' eyes, and he nods, his hands pushing into Dean's jacket, so he can press his palms against Dean's back, over his henley, and his voice is a little weak when he says, "there is nothing to forgive."
Cas detours to their little closet, unhooking the plastic-framed, full-length mirror from the inside of the door.
Cas is quiet as a goddamn shadow as he shuffles over toward the driver’s seat, jaw tight as his fiery blues never leave Luc.  Cas huffs out a slow breath.
Before any real thoughts, let alone words, can form a coherent order, Cas’s lips are back on Dean overwhelming him with sounds and smells and sensation.
Cas doesn’t get out of bed that day either.  Or the next day, or the day after that, or the day after that...
“‘Course, dude,” Dean’s grin returns in spades and he knows exactly what gets the kid feeling better every time, “What? You don’t...
Tears are free flowing from one blink to the next, making Cas’s skin slippery where Dean gasps against it.  He’s just so...
“You know, that’s not a bad idea,” Cas leans in even further until the warm puff of their breath is falling on Dean’s cheek.
Sliding two bowls onto the table and grabbing the toasted bread from off the camp stove, Dean glances to the bed.  Cas is a lump under the covers, huddled around Jack like a little kid holding his teddy bear.  Jack’s eyes are open, already a little misty for 8-something in the morning.  The kid isn’t moving, though, and Dean can see in his eyes a glimmer of something to match his own insides.  He didn’t know that guilt was so easy to spot, but there it is.  Dark and haunting, as obvious as the blonde hair making a halo against the arm Cas has tucked under the kid’s little head.
There’s a matching gulp on the other end that Dean could pick out of a line-up, followed by the voice of the angels...
Dean’s already thrown his ball of clothing into his bag and is slipping his small pile of notebooks in beside them when Luc’s sudden gasp makes his bones shake.
“Yeah?” Dean must be grinning like an idiot.  Cas tells Dean they love him every day but there’s still a little thrill that sizzles out to Dean’s limbs at Cas saying ‘I like you.’
just what, fuckhole?” Luc mocks, suddenly grabbing hold of that grown out hair and yanking Jack’s head up to face him, “Look at me when I’m talking to you.”
A warm palm cradles Dean’s jaw, drawing his gaze to watery blue eyes, “I know, Dean.  I love you, too.”
Jack is cradling his own plate like it’s stacked with diamonds, like he’s not sure if he should eat it or thoughtfully observe it.
He stumbles back and genuine surprise flashes in his eyes before it is quickly replaced by sheer delight.
If werewolves were real, and humanoid, and had dicks...Dean could only pray that their dicks would be
“Every time…” Cas smacks his lips together around another shaky breath, smiling against Dean’s cheek, “Never ceases to amaze me.
Dean chuckles when he feels a little peck of lips on the collar of his t-shirt and he doesn’t need to look down to feel Jack’s smile pressing into his skin.
“Yeah, he eats, sleeps and on to the next job. When he’s back, it's usually at night and leaves early in the morning.” Sammy said. He looked over at Dean with a quirk to his mouth. As if to say, “Happy now?”
“I know,” but Dean needed that money. “It’s not a big deal. It’s just babysitting if you think about it.”
“Castiel. You are Mikhailov. Act like it. It’s time you understand the power and leverage you have. This boy, Dean, will be your shield. Use him to your advantage. He’s willing and can be your devoted dog. This isn’t about weakness or misconceived injustice. It’s a monetary transaction. A job he can handle. If Noami says to keep the peace, your little guard dog can take the fall.”
The drive was short. Soon enough, Dean opened the door and ushered Sammy into the other room. Sammy whined but did as he was told.
On Castiel’s 6th birthday, it broke his heart to see him well behaved and courteous. The boy moved like a robot and called Naomi his mom without question. The woman paraded him around the room and the kid just acted like a puppet. It was then and there that he decided to take this kid under his wing. He hated seeing this distorted version of the boy he once knew. Who was once bright-eyed and curious. A child completely in awe of the world. Hungry for information and so very kind. A boy that wept over a snail getting stepped on.
“Dean,” Gentle fingers card through his hair, pulling him back down to Earth.  Cas’s eyes are equally gentle with a little glimmer of mirth.  His amping thoughts slow down a little in the rhythm of her touch, “Relax.”
“Nice job,” Sammy’s eyes aren’t on the cinnamon buns though, his bright smile instead resting on Jack.  Dean stands just out of the doorway the whole time, not wanting to disturb...well, whatever this is.  He just wants to see it happen, let that nice little bubbly feeling dissolve the panic—let the warm and fuzzies take the steering wheel for a while.  When an idea sparks into his brain, he just as stealthily walks to the entryway, his jacket pocket, and back to his out-of-sight place by the doorway.  He’s back just in time to hear Sammy say, “Hey, I think we got some sprinkles from Valentine’s day or something.  Wanna put those on, too?”
Castiel taps the finger of his clean hand against his chin, “I believe the expression goes ‘Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.’”
Why can’t they just stay like this forever?  Why do they even go out into a dismal world that only wants to see them suffer when they could just stay wrapped up in this heavenly bubble until they die in their sleep at eighty like normal people get to?
“I am in,” she grumbles, “I believe my nipples could cut diamonds and all I wish to do is bury myself in the hot sand like a snake.”
The slight chuckle he lets out shifts them ever so slightly and then Dean isn’t laughing anymore.  He’s fucking writhing as the tip of Cas’s length presses painfully good against that deep spot on every thrust.
Suddenly everyone is way closer than they were a second ago and he wonders if he blacked out, but they’re not acting like he did so that’s a good sign.  He’s probably just being weird again.
“Yeah, buddy,” Sammy chuckles and tucks a strand of hair out of Jack’s face that the little guy keeps trying to blow away—just like he’s probably seen Dean do a million times now, “Careful of the sheet, though.  It’s super hot.”
“Then, one day, Castiel was called by the other angels to court--apparently, a ‘court’ used to be just a special meeting place, and not where judges and lawyers go.  So, Castiel went to court before his brother and sister angels and, as a reward for being so obedient, he was given a special mission: save the righteous man.”
Dean quirks a brow but holds up his knapsack and continues, “I said that if you want to toss your shirt in here, just go for it.  It’s where I threw mine.”
He unleashed an avalanche of butterfly smooches all over Dean’s giggling face until his baby boy was squirming so much he fell onto his back, his head only a foot or so below their pillows.  His baby was so beautiful like this, sprawled out and panting, a light sheen of sweat glimmering at his temples.
“This Cas sounds like a very special person,” Mary’s eyes are still glassy but take on a genuine brightness once again, “He really seemed to love you.”
His friend kisses and licks and hums into Dean’s mouth with more drive than he’s ever seen from the boy.  Cas is pushing closer, huddling into him like he’s afraid Dean will just up-and-leave.  The house would have to be on fire before Dean would even think of putting more than an inch of space between them.  A fire...or if Luc came down.
This only gave Castiel incentive to nip and kiss even more, chuckling as Dean squirmed and smiled in his hold.  This was the reason Castiel so often enjoyed their Playtime as a supplement to their more typical sex life.  He would never grow tired of getting to bring joy to this beautiful person he loved.
Shaking his head, Cas sighs around a smile, “It appears that way.  But he did say he wanted Marvin around ‘just in case.’”
“When I, uh,” Dean let out a humorless laugh and his eyes squeezed a little tighter, “When I told him that, no, it was not actually my birthday we got into a fight.  He got defensive and actually tried to
Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, eyes still owlish and full of wonder.  Slowly he draws their threaded fingers further and further under the blanket, finally coming to rest on the fine downy hair of his warm thigh.
Cas gives him one more glance before settling their head back against Dean’s shoulder, as Dean tries to sink low enough into the couch that he disappears.  When the hot and heavy scene finally ends (Damn, how long was that anyway?  Apparently, werewolves have
Castiel's sweaty, sticky hands roam over the purple and pink dress that feels oddly nice against his bear skin.  His fingers play over her crease, muscles jumping in their wake.  Deanna takes in a shaky breath and nuzzles into the dip of his throat.  Her rim is hot and puffy under his fingertips, smeared and tacky with lube.  She shivers at the feather-light touch, pushing minutely back against it.  Castiel inches down to her upper legs, pulling the twisted panties up her smooth thighs until they sit perfectly on her hips.  He kneads over the lace-covered valley of her cheeks, palming until a mix of lube and his come squishes through the dainty fabric.  The obscene sound it makes has both of giving a valiant twitch where their sexes are squashed between their stomachs.
“Come again, fuckhole?” he hisses.  Cas squeaks as Luc’s grip turns to steel around him--then the squeak turns to a giggle.
Castiel cracks his eyes open and his gaze is suddenly filled with the cutest sight.  Jack’s little fists rub over sleepy hazel eyes that still don’t quite focus.  His jammies with the cartoon candy bars are rumpled from his sleep, rucked up over his little pudge of a belly.  He’s clutching the plush snake that was a birthday present from Sam and Rowena as he yawns.  Jack’s baby-bird hair sticks up at all angles and he moves to lean against Castiel’s shin.  His legs are angled in weird directions that would have an adult popping a hip, but little kids seem to fold into effortlessly.  Castiel has half a mind to sneak his phone off the nightstand and take a picture for his lock screen, but he’s been trying to live more in the moment, so instead he twists his upper body to face his son.  The movement is enough to draw Dean out his own light sleep, and the next moment Dean’s snuffling awake.
It’s the question Dean’s brain has been running defeated circles around since Luc plopped Jack onto the concrete.
“Daddy…” Dean shot Castiel his best cheeky smile, green eyes damn near twinkling, “Wanna lick you now.  Please?  Wanna make Daddy feel all tingly, too…”
“Feel so hot and sticky in my hands, Daddy,” Dean said in awe.  He suddenly drew his hand away and Castiel found himself nearly whimpering at the lost contact.  Dean licked the spend from his fingertips, lips glistening with it as he smiled, “Heh. You taste good too, Daddy…”
Another staticky sigh.  Dean’s getting really fucking sick of her sighs.  He’s feeling really fucking sick in general, but that’s beside the point.
“Please, more, Daddy...want more…” Dean’s hips continued to wriggle back and when the entirety of the toy slipped back into his baby as easily as sliding a sudsy bar of soap through one’s fist, Castiel took pity on him.
Dean leans in closer.  He can feel the summertime warmth of her body so close to his own, like she’s radiating out all the sunshine she soaked up on the beach.  With barely a foot between them and the vague smell of Cas’s fruity shampoo mixing with the lake fills his senses.
Dean realizes that he needs to get a grip on himself--and soon--when he feels that familiar coiling deep in his lower belly.
Luc had been all riled up when he charged in, dropping a paper bag on the table and scooping Dean up from where he had been sitting on the bed, carrying him off to the Playroom.  He’d done that thing with the blindfold that scared the shit out of Dean and made the usual handful of hours Luc spent inside one of his holes feel like it stretched into days.
Castiel slowly sat up and was sure to keep his hand on Dean as silent reassurance that he wasn’t going anywhere, merely changing position.  As soon as Castiel was upright with his back to the couch, he spread his knees a little and motioned his boy into the V of his legs.
sex scenes, too.  And while, yeah, they never fail to get him all hot under the collar--this is ridiculous.  So maybe Dean’s always been a little… overly into the whole scruff and cowboy boots thing the good doctor has going on, but this is new.  Dean’s never been this riled up from a few moans and some pretty shitty dialogue, his dick has never perked up this fast at exactly no direct contact or promise of fun times later.  It’s like he’s fifteen and popping a boner during an episode of
It ripples through his body like hot lava and he’s untangling their limbs and throwing himself out of the bed before he can burn Cas.  He gets nearly an hour of dressing and cooking and pacing in before the other boy’s sleep-heavy head pokes out from under the blanket and finds Dean.  God, he’s adorable like that.  After Cas yawns and palms away the last tendrils of sleep from his eyes, much clearer baby blues look at Dean like he hung the moon.
For a moment, Dean is stock still, unable to get any of his limbs to work.  He’s staring at Cas whose saucer eyes snap to him.  Even after everything Cas just said, his friend’s gaze is still filled with so much trust, wanting Dean to be there for him.
But now, when he thinks about dying, he thinks about leaving Cas.  Not just leaving Cas but leaving him
“Dean?” Dean only realizes now what Cas has probably already figured out: he’s locked up again, “Dean, what’s wrong?”
“Oh,” Not what he was expecting, but okay, “Uh, maybe.  I know Mom did since she told me about the angels and stuff, but I don’t really know anymore.  If God is up in the clouds somewhere, just watching us and...everything that happens to us--if that’s who God is, I don’t think I want him to exist.  I’d rather it was just me here all alone than have s-someone else know I’m down here too and just not giving a damn.  Y’know?”
Sam is a gigantic squeezing mess and Dean is quickly catching up as the shock comes crumbling down.  With Sam and his mom, who’s now got her arms circled around the both of them, Dean buries his head somewhere in his brother’s shoulder (Sam somehow even smells the same, too) and let’s a sob shake his whole body.
Finally, they reach the car.  After throwing the cooler into the trunk, they hastily climb into the front seats and slam the doors behind them.  Cas is laughing now, a genuine smile 9not just a hint of one.  It’s that way everyone seems to after running in the rain, no matter how old they are.  Eyes bright, her grin is a sunbeam in the grey light coming through the windshields.  She’s panting with pink cheeks and a single, perfectly shaped curl is sticking to her forehead.  Dean is shirtless, freezing and cool water drips from the hair he slicks out of his face--but, God, he doesn't think it’s possible to get much happier than this.  He can’t take his eyes off of her.
Mrs. Shurley’s tone softens ever so slightly and he’s pretty sure it’s the kind of voice that she believes is soothing.  It sure as hell is
The fingers on his ass lift away and Dean misses them already.  His friend’s hand doesn’t travel far, just lifting back up to the swell of his backside and doing that massaging thing again.
A glint from an object slightly tucked under the pillow caught Castiel’s eye and he didn’t have to look to know what it was.  Warmth bubbled in Castiel’s chest—he loved that his baby boy wanted to be his and only his.  And even as he reached for the collar, he didn’t let his eyes tear away from Dean’s.
“We’ll keep searching to see if Kelly has a cousin or someone else willing to take Jack in, otherwise…” Sheriff Mills deeply exhales, “otherwise Jack will have to go into foster care.”
Dean doesn’t answer, brushing past and making a b-line for the door.  With the arm not scooped up under Jack's butt, Dean reaches out and shimmies the metal handle, trying to push it open.  It doesn’t open.  Why the fuck won’t it open?  Did they lock them in?  Dean jerks the handle, trying to push.  Did that fucking asshole—
“Better,” his friend sighs, “I think he’s going to have a sore throat for a while, though.  But...he’s still alive.”
When Dean crawls into bed behind his friend, Cas shifts closer to the wall, back turned toward him.  Dean had kept his distance the whole day, but when he wakes up with only cold blankets hugging his body and Cas curled into an impenetrable ball, his guilt is worse than ever.
“Hey, I love that card,” Cas’s brow dips but Dean steamrolls on despite the butterflies doing the Cha-cha in his full belly.
Cas’s feet were starting to twinge, though, and they grimaced slightly, hands unwinding to sit on Dean’s hips.  Cas pulled back and kissed Dean’s slightly parted lips, “I gotta sit down, love.  C’mere.”
A smile overtakes Cas’s features and they draw his mouth to theirs.  Dipping their tongue between satiny lips, Cas tastes the traces of salt and tang of Dean’s release.
Dean runs a hand through his own freshly cut hair.  God it looks weird.  Good weird, but still weird.  It’s way shorter on top than how Luc liked it and, though Jack still liked his a little longer, Dean wouldn’t want it any other way.  The lady who cut it even did it up in this off-to-the-side style, and he kinda liked it so he’s been replicating it as best he can.  God, it’s so soft.  He had no clue his hair could be this damn
It’s better here, where he can’t see them as shame squeezes and chokes his neck like a snake. Tighter and tighter and tighter until his throat burns and he can’t breathe—
“Uh…” Dean’s face is getting hot and his throat is tightening and it’s really fucking inconvenient because he’s gotta say
Sunlight radiates through the windows of the minivan, reflecting against the many stories of windows of the hospital in front of them like a glass castle in the sky.
Castiel smiles at the petulant side-eye she’s giving him over her shoulder and kisses one of her plump ass cheeks, “No, sweetheart.  Daddy gets to decide when you’re ready.  Since nobody’s ever touched your special princess place, I’m going to make sure your beautiful little hole is nice and loose and ready to take Daddy.  Is that understood, princess?”
“Here?”  Dean wraps his hand firmly around his friend, fingers reaching all the way around to completely embrace him.
Jack is still here, too, sprawled out on his stomach like a starfish.  Floppy, sleep-heavy limbs lay across Dean, little fingers flinching and squeezing as his eyes move beneath pale lids.  He’s never seen Jack so goddamn peaceful and something burns nice and bright under his ribs even if he’s still not awake enough to be certain this isn’t a dream.
When Cas climbs into bed, he silently joins their hands and pulls Dean along behind him.  Dean knows he should protest, and he’s all kinds of fucked up but...Dean wordlessly slips in behind Cas and pulls his friend into the circle of his arms.
,” Dean slaps his palm to his forehead.  He’s such a moron, “No, no, no, Cas.  Fuck, sorry, that’s not what I meant.
Cas, with the fleece pulled up under his chin, stares at the ceiling.  The glow of the TV catches in his watery lashes.
, he starts to catch Cas’s tells.  Despite his friend’s smooth voice, there’s a little hitch to it, and he’s swallowing more than normal.  His slender fingers shake ever so slightly with each pass through the long-ish, blonde strands.
“I thought--” A blush creeped up Cas’s neck, eyes falling to a smattering of freckles on Dean’s shoulder, “I just wasn’t sure if maybe my body might be...off-putting to you now…”
a calendar.  He can usually tell the season by how cold or damp it gets in the basement, or by the fact that Luc’s boots start tracking in snow instead of dried leaves.  The best clues him and Cas get are the expiration dates on packages.  But since canned Spaghetti-O’s have shelf lives older than him, they only give him a rough estimate.  Sometimes they’ll get really lucky and Luc forgets a receipt in a grocery bag and the automated little stamp with the date can tell them just how much more of their lives has been eaten away.
“Does that feel good, Dean?” Castiel asks with a chuckle, brushing the shell of Dean’s ear with the tip of his tongue.
Castiel tsks, giving a firm pat to his princess’s ass in admonishment.  She squeaks and all traces of brattiness seem to dissolve from her system, “I said to ask
Castiel held his boy close until Dean’s muscles all seemed to simultaneously turn to gelatin, arms sliding off of his daddy.  When Castiel pulled himself up onto his elbows once again he met no resistance.  Dean’s expression was slack and blissed out and he giggled drunkenly as Castiel peppered his cheeks with kisses.
“What the fuck are you trying to do, Dean-o?  Huh?”  Luc growls, nails breaking the thin skin of his throat, “What?  You think you’re protecting him?  Like you protected Sammy?” The edges of Dean’s vision are starting to close in on him like a cartoon character looking through binoculars.  His lungs are burning and he’s pretty sure the squawking noises he hears are coming from him.
The glow of the headlights flashing over the garage door is a blur in the back of Cas’s mind as Dean pulls the Impala into their driveway.  Cas flexes their nimble fingers where they’ve been lightly gripping their husband’s leg since leaving the restaurant.  Slowly, Cas has been teasing their way upwards, kneading at the warm flesh under worn-soft jeans.  Dean’s muscles clench and unclench under their touch, leg pushing closer and closer to Cas’s hand until his knee is sitting awkwardly against the cupholder so he can still reach the gas pedal.  The slow hum of the radio had only been cut into a few times by loud gulps clicking in Dean’s throat or tiny sighs drifting in the warm air between them.  Dean’s eyes had been dead set on the road the whole time, but a smile quirked Cas’s lips when Dean finally glances down at the hand in his lap as soon as the car pulls onto their street.  Cas gives his thigh a little squeeze, an inch from the prominent bulge that’s been slowly swelling the whole ride and pulls their hand away.  Their smile dips into a smirk when Dean coughs to (quite poorly) cover his whimper.
Dean clears his throat once more, but it still burns.  He kicks into motion again, flipping the tap to run the next plate under, “I dunno.  Nice, I guess.  I don’t really remember.”
“Did I do good, Cas?” Dean beamed, and pulled Cas’s boxers back up around their waist.  He rested back on his heels, tracing his thumbs over their bare knees.  He was so earnest and something fuzzy squeezed in Cas’s chest.
Rolling his eyes, Dean shuffles Cas around to face him and cards the dark, sweaty tangles off the boy’s forehead, “But I
“Please, don’t do that again, Cas,” Dean’s gulp is loud in the small, humid space between them, “I can’t--I don’t wanna wake up one day and find you--”
Dean isn’t even aware he’d napped until his eyes slide open and his stomach gives a hungry garble.  He combs through the dark bedhead that his fingers had tangled in at some point.  Light little breaths make his skin tingle at the warmth where his friend’s soft lips softly snore against him.  He might not have been able to save Cas last night, but he can’t help but wondering if maybe he saved Cas a little bit this morning.
He shuffles his feet under Cas’s gaze.  He huffs a humorless laugh at his prickling skin, and he looks back down to the ground.
,” Dean murmured, turning pleading, fiery greens upward and Castiel couldn’t help but plant a chaste kiss on slightly parted lips, smiling.
Dean feels all sorts of warm as his sticky eyes slowly start to open.  Of course, he doesn’t actually see what’s so warm since it’s nearly pitch black in their little room, but that’s certainly not a surprise anymore.  He doesn’t need to see that it’s Cas to feel the slight expansion of his friend’s chest with every sleepy breath he takes.  Dean also doesn’t need to see to be able to feel comforted by the smooth jut of hip where his palm had landed at some point during the night.
“I thought maybe we could celebrate Christmas today.  It’s most definitely winter,” he buries his little icicle toes between Dean’s calves and at least it’s enough to wake him up even if it reminds him of just how cold his own toes are, “And even if it’s already passed...it’s not like we’ll ever know.”
Dean chuckles and squeezes Jack’s hand, “We’re doing good, Cas.  But, uh…” Jack squeezes back, “miss you like crazy, man.”
I hope you enjoyed the chapter and continue to stick around!! Thanks so much for reading!! Comments give me life lol
She doesn’t waste a second shoving her hand past the band and wrapping tight, slick fingers around him.  He fucks up into the blissful, tunnel grip, muffling his shaky moans against her bare shoulder.  She’s not holding back in the slightest and he knows this is all going to be over ridiculously fast because, well, it’s Cas.
The first thing Cas suggests is charades.  The other boy explained it as something the adults played each year when his family was forced to go to Aunt Amara’s house for the holidays.  It sounded simple enough even though Dean hadn’t ever heard of it--or if he did, he couldn’t remember, so they gave it a go.
It’s a hard minute while Cas gets up from where he’d taken a seat on the bed to turn off the lights, but then his friend is wrapping around him like an octopus.  Dean can almost feel the other boy trying to absorb all his pain like a bandage protecting a fresh wound.  Dean does kinda feel like a fresh wound, but one that’s been cut over layers of old, lumpy scar tissue.
, is the first thing that had come to Dean’s mind as Luc latched the third door behind him.  Then he saw the small paper bag tucked under the man’s arm.  So, it was going to be one of
When he glances up, Dean’s eyes have already fallen shut again, his arm heavy where it’s draped over Jack’s body, hand resting on Castiel’s hip.  Likewise, Jack’s gentle, even breaths are almost definitely indicative of the boy already dozing.  As tempting as another nap is, the picture he’s looking at is too beautiful to close his eyes to.
For a second Dean almost hangs up because he must be going nuts, right?  He’s talking to fucking static because he can hear
“I can think of other ways you could show your appreciation,” Cas’s smirk is goddamn predatory and probably would’ve gotten Dean’s southern half going again if he were a decade younger.  Now, all he feels is giddy as his hand slips down between them until he’s kneading over Cas’s soaked boxer.
Dean nodded, biting his lip and staring down at Cas with pleading eyes.  Cas took mercy on their husband, undoing the loose ties of the pajamas and hooking their fingers in the waistband.  Keeping his eyes, they tugged the fabric down at a teasing pace to reveal Dean’s flushed cock to the air.  The tip glistened as pre-come dripped down the sides.  Dean’s hands fidgeted and pulled at the scrunched-up fabric at his hips until Cas weaved both their fingers together.  They squeezed their husband’s hands and Dean squeezed back.
“Would you like me to put your collar on for you yet?”  He lowered down to sit at Dean’s waist, his baby boy’s hands scrambling up to grasp under the pillow.
Dean is nodding and opening his car door before the words have fully left Cas’s mouth.  Cas chuckles, following suit with a teasing casualness that makes their blood rush with the feeling of power Dean relinquishing control always gives them.  Once their door is slammed shut behind them, Cas rounds the hood and finds Dean antsy but waiting patiently by the house’s entrance.  He shimmies open the door as soon as Cas is within a few feet from him, apparently that is all the patience he has tonight.  As soon as they both cross the threshold and before either can turn the lights on, Cas’s fists grab hold of Dean’s canvas jacket, walking him backwards until they’ve thrust him up against the now closed door.  The warring halves of Cas’s body want to rip all their clothes off this instant but, simultaneously, can’t bear the thought of having an inch of space between their bodies.  The latter half wins for the mean time as Cas draws the hot column of Dean’s neck to their nibbling lips.  He squeaks in surprise before melting against the door, fingers winding in Cas’s hair and drawing them closer.
He gasps and heaves a few breaths before the burning in his lungs starts to fade.  He feels hot tears slide down to his pillow from the corners of his eyes.  Scraping the back of his hand over his eyes, he rips the headphones off, plunging him into deafening silence.
“I love your little noises, Dean,” Cas purrs, leaving a sharp bite to his jaw that Dean whimpers at before drawing back.
Dean slips to the floor without a second thought, because Luc’s voice isn’t one-tenth the raging screech it was before.  Is it possible Dean actually had an idea that fucking worked for once?
“How’s it feel, Cas?” Dean mutters between smooches and brushes of tongue.  Cas groans and wraps his arm around Dean’s shoulders to draw them even closer, “Say it, please?  Say--I need to know you like this, please--”
“Just like that, sweetheart.  Fuck, I love you,” Dean grips the ex-angel’s velvety hardness even tighter as Cas begins to spasm and twitch around him, “Come for me, baby...just for me--”
There’s the rustle of clothing—what?—and Jack’s whimpers keen like he’s trying to speak.  Dean raises his head as much as his aching neck will go, but he can only see the back of Cas’s head.  Did he turn his back to the kid?  Why?
"No, no - it didn't travel very far, and was forgotten in time, but it is a song I think of often. I would thank her for it, could I find her. And there will be no laughing this time?"
He stares at the voided space, waiting for the fluttering sound of feathers to return, waiting to wake up, waiting for the universe to rewind or reset, since this turn of events is so obviously incorrect.
“Revenge?” Dean’s voice cracks, a hot lump sitting heavy in his throat, “Why the fuck would you want revenge on Lisa?”
Eyes flickering open with some difficulty, Dean tries to remember who the fuck Anna is, and will later be ashamed that, in the moment, he can’t.
His forehead scrunching in confusion, Cas tilts his head in a painfully familiar way, and tells Dean, "no. Or - I don't believe so. Dean, I've already had a time of - the last eternity, or so - please don't make me question my existence first thing."
Obviously, Castiel has lost hope, and Dean will carry him up that mountain, if it's what Cas needs. He'll keep the faith, if Castiel can't.
Stunned enough to sway where he stands, Dean swallows roughly, caught and paralyzed by Castiel’s glimmering eyes, and the tears still falling from them.
"Yes, you can," Dean permits, ensnaring Castiel's gaze again, a dare in his tone, "You want to. Look at me, Cas. I'm on my knees for you. You talked big in the car, now
For a second, Dean's eyes spring open, and he's never - it's never happened to him before - that words alone - just words! - nothing is even touching his dick! - but before he can talk himself down from it, he's stepping over the edge, right into a one-two-punch of an orgasm that has his eyes squeezing shut and throat seizing up.
He leans in close, pressing their foreheads together, breathing in the smell of him, and it's ozone-apple-cider, something downy, and spring water, it's home, it's sanctuary, and safety, and everything plainly good in the universe, and Dean utters lowly, desperately, "you can have me - you can have me. Cas, you can have anything, everything - you can have me, you always had me."
Or, maybe it's just that Castiel made him feel young, and he's coming to the realization that he's old and lonely.
That’s why Dean is with him - he’s the literal, human shield. Academically, Dean understood that a few hours beforehand, but now that the morning hours are creeping steadily toward them, he thinks there’s a real, actual possibility that Castiel won’t make it out of this.
A foreign, shy smile tempts the edges of Dean’s mouth, and he’s inwardly embarrassed that he feels so flattered by a single adjective, “yeah?”
Normally, Dean would shut down this conversation at this point, but there’s something more than his inability to accept kindnesses making him feel ill at ease.
Confused for a brief moment, Dean needs to crouch and lift a little of the blanket to see underneath, and there's their beat-up Clue board game box in plain view.
He's glad Sam is happy, he really is, it's just difficult to reconcile that gladness with the enormous awfulness that's sucking the life out of everything else.
“Hey, listen. Take this,” he holds out a few bills to Castiel, “If she asks for a credit card, no, and stick to the basics, okay? Do not order off the menu.”
“... Cas?” he rasps, knowing full well what Castiel is feeling in that moment - it’s dizzying. It’s sickening. It’s all at once too much and not enough.
They let a few more quiet minutes pass, Dean pulls his knees up to his chest, and rests his head against his knees, turning to face Jody.
He looks the same now - though, softer. Kinder. There is more to him now, he isn’t only a soldier anymore. He’s more, and it shows in his face.
Cas turns his head again, and murmurs against his lips, “there is nothing more beautiful to me than the thought of being completely alone with you. You would never need to speak another word if you didn’t want to, I understand you in your blood, your knuckles, and sweat, hair, and freckles. A shallow grave, somewhere the sun shines, where it’s green and quiet, it would be narrow and sun-warm, a bed for the ages, just you and I turning to hourglass sand, and no eyes in Heaven or Earth could find us. Imagine what flowers might sprout from us…”
mastered sarcasm and is just unwilling to admit it to anyone so he can keep masking sly digs with plausible deniability, “I want to help you, Cas. Just talk to me.”
The portal closes, and all that’s left is his heavy breathing - he couldn’t hear it before, over all the blood pounding in his skull - this must be where that sensation of tightness in his chest came from.
“Ohhh, man - nothing,” Dean manages, throwing a casual arm around Castiel’s shoulders, grinning widely, “
As soon as they’ve both slid out of the driver’s side door, Castiel is turning around, probably to ask Dean if he’s angry, but he doesn’t get the chance.
It takes Dean a full minute to brave stepping through the threshold, and when he does, he feels flooded by memory - inconsequential shit, things said in passing, Castiel being human and yawning widely enough that his jaw audibly popped, he and Cas pacing around the war room while Sam grimaced at his laptop, Cas worrying over Dean and Sam as they competed to find the most convoluted or dangerous way to spring the cap off a beer bottle, the sound of his feathers ruffling from some other plane, handing an ethereal entity a plastic, stupid fucking mixtape while fully believing that entity wouldn't know how to listen to it.
"He said I was the most caring, selfless, loving human being he'd ever known. He said I changed him - a way he shouldn't have been able to be changed. He was a soldier, he was built for it, he wasn't supposed to care about humans, he wasn't supposed to care about anything other than orders, but he cared about me, so he cared about you, and Claire, and Jack, and the world, the whole world all 'cause he grabbed me, and saved me from the depths of Hell, and - he didn't even like John Wayne, Sam. Like, he didn't like him, but he liked watching old Westerns with me anyway, because he said he liked how I imitated him, and he said he loved my mixtape - all those Zeppelin songs - and how I sing off-key and think I'm funnier than I actually am."
While Sam does a fine job of teaching Castiel, and Castiel is a very quick study, they struggle with their height difference while Dean tells them about their height difference, unhelpfully and repeatedly.
Glancing down kind of curiously at his chest again, Castiel smoothes his tie down, and mutters, "it is criminal, ruinous, very possibly cataclysmic, but I’d not surrender it to anyone, anywhere, for anything. I feel like such an insignificant entity compared to its endlessness, and I know beyond doubt that I will mishandle it, that I will bleed, that it will gladly destroy me, but I'd have it no other way."
Pulling away with a scratchy gasp, Dean throws his head back, hands flying to Castiel’s waist, and he full-body shivers at the low, undeniably masculine
He should have, but he never told Cas that the betrayal wasn’t a matter of wanting Cas to report to him like some superior - he never told Cas he wanted Cas to stay, and that’s brass tacks.
Kaia explains to them that Jody, Claire, and she had all posted his picture on Facebook, and handed out physical posters town-to-town while they hunted, encouraging folks that recognized him to come pay respects.
Dean’s hands are shaking, he wants to compulsively crack his knuckles, but he’s trying not to, and no matter what feelings are stretching the seams of his chest, he won’t let himself cry, because crying would be some kind of surrender, and surrendering means
“Dude, shut up,” Dean tells himself, redirecting his attention back onto Cas, “Tell me what you think, Cas.”
“I -" Sam interrupts, nervously shaking his head at Cas and rushing to say, "- look, I shouldn’t have even asked, it’s like - proving what you feel is love is like… I dunno, it’s like telling someone to describe the color red to a blind person, you know? You don't need to tell me anything -”
Billowing out a breath, Cas slips down from the truck onto his feet in the mud, his arms and hands seizing and shaking violently as he gesticulates nervously and paces.
“Even if - which I don’t - I’m not - listen, though, okay? I’m not, and I don’t want that - not that there’s anything wrong with it, or something, just - even if that were the case, Cas isn’t like that. He’s not a being that experiences shit like that -”
Baby crawls into the field, stopping just a split second before Jody actually hits the brake; it's fine, though, because Dean's pretty certain she didn't notice.
"I can't," he rasps, grossly wiping under his nose with the sleeve of his jacket, "I can't, I can't do it - I can't do this - we weren't supposed to
He likes the way the light bounces off his band when the sun comes through Baby's windshield just right, and sometimes, it feels like that flash of blinding white is some confirmation that Cas somehow knows.
“Oh, I don’t think anyone’s thinking of it as an insult,” Sam intones; Dean shoves his elbow into Sam’s kidney to shut him up.
!” Dean’s hips stutter as the molten coil in his groin grows tighter than he can remember it ever being, “Cas, Jesus
She's struggling on the ground, making some of the ugliest noises he's ever heard a beast make, but he's rather sure she'll be dead by sunrise.
It's as he goes to glance out the passenger-side window for a quick admiration of the view from that side that he notices Cas just occupying that space where nothing had been a split second beforehand, and he slams on the brakes fast enough that they realistically should have spun out and both been tossed through the windshield to grisly ends, but thankfully, that's not what happens.
However deeply Castiel likes to kiss becomes apparent with how challenging he makes it to grab a breath, and how much control on Dean's part it requires for him to keep his hands to himself.
He brushes her off, he gets Eileen to come and help fix her make-up where it's run, and then he gives Claire Novak away to her wife, thinking the entire time how Castiel deserved to be there.
He looks to some faraway place over Dean’s shoulder, and rasps, “I still do. So, yes, Dean. I will follow you everywhere you lead, for however long you allow me to. I don’t mind flying blind if I’m flying with you.”
“What…” Sam trails off, taking in Dean’s expression, and then seeing the bloody handprint on his jacket; his voice is a little more choked, and gentle when he finishes, “... is there anything we can do?”
When Dean was very young, he remembers taking up every opportunity he had to run through freshly fallen snow, before it had been shaped at all by another’s footsteps, or mud, or slush, or wind. To him, as a child, it was like discovering new land, and marking it as his own, if only for the brief time it would stay in place. There was something very satisfying about the ritual.
There are candles and faerie lights all around, crystals in varying blues, and there's a grill still going next to a table devoted to cheeseburgers on one half, and pre-made, saran-wrapped PB&J sandwiches on the other, split down the middle by a
“When you wanted me naked, you would call me whatever made me smile most, which you sometimes - you sometimes just -” Cas chuckles, sweetly, authentically, serenely, “You would guess at what pleased me most to hear that day until you got what you wanted. Occasionally, I would ignore how happy those names made me feel, just to see what wild variations you would come up with to try next. It was a game you and I could play together. It was endearing.”
“All -” Castiel clears his throat, still barely able to respond, “You’ve always - Dean, I cannot take from you what -”
“I do want you, Dean,” Castiel confirms, eyes shut, voice whining lowly while he rubs unabashedly against Dean, “I trust you. I like this. All of this. All of
Dean tries to snatch the phone back, glaring at Sam, but Sam keeps it out of reach, and kicks at Dean to keep him at a distance.
“I am not Lisa,” Castiel starts, his head tilting to the side, “nor am I Cassie, Robin, or anyone else you might have seen a life with, built a life with, loved in that way, but I… I would have unfolded all the universe for a chance of that with you. To fulfill you, and to make you happy for all of your days. That's what I want - more than anything, and above all else.”
Then, Cas tugs on his belt loops, pulling him in tighter, pressing all of his front against Dean, wetting his lips so close to Dean’s that Dean can taste clementine again.
Into the second year, he drinks slightly less, hunts - he sometimes asks Sam to go with him, but tries to let him have his Sort Of Normal Life without too much bother.
He pets the point of Dean’s exposed canine, and mutters closely, “there are no conditions under which my affections for you exist. Do you understand?”
"Dean, is there somewhere we can - I mean, is there a place for us to - like, you know - pay our respects?" Sam asks desperately, wringing his wrists, "I mean, you didn't even tell me what happened, is there - does he need a salt and burn? Is there anywhere -"
"There are many pleasures I will not know," Castiel surrenders with a shrug, "I am at peace with what I do not, cannot, or will never know."
Proud, Castiel's chin juts forward a bit as he continues, "I wrapped him tightly in the safety of my torn, tired wings, I burned him with the brand of my divinity so enemies would know that any trespasses against him - that they would be answerable to
Objectively, the kiss should be odd with Castiel’s probing touches, maybe even invasive, but instead it only serves to make Dean feel admired while being closely examined, and endeared.
Sam appreciates the gesture, takes Cas’ hand, and when he’s stabilized again in his and Dean’s latest motel room, Cas draws his hand back, looking a bit cowed.
He smiles his kind smile, big glossy tears threatening to tip over his dark lashes, “from the moment I pulled you out of Hell -”
“I’m a coward this way,” Castiel adds, half-smiling in a self-pitying type way, “The truth frees us, Dean. I suppose I’ve always known that, but theory and practice so rarely align neatly. This helped me realize what I need to do, though. True happiness was never going to be measured by some scale of validity - it would be measured in my honesty. The laying down of my secret, freeing myself of the burden - true happiness. Happiness, unencumbered.”
Still confused, thunder claps overhead, and Castiel asks, “what do humans scream? What am I meant to scream to get it out?”
"Whatever - never mind, that was stupid, I -" she takes a deep breath, during which Dean finally recognizes the stuffed animal situated next to her computer screen, and his heart seizes up, "Anyway, I got it to you. The mix. He didn't know what to title it - like, he thought because yours had a label, that his had to have one too? Like those were the rules? You know how he was... anyway. It's yours now. I can, uh - wash my hands of this."
understand, and there are so many reasons not to voice this, to not give it body enough that it might exist outside myself, or worse - in
When the strumming plays out, and Castiel looks up from the lyre to gauge their reactions, Kaia inquires, "what does it mean?"
Before Dean can further fuck up this interaction, Jody calls for Claire, and when Dean and she leave the room, Jody hustles them both back outside, where Garth and some of his buddies are getting ready to set off fireworks against the purple sky; it's not even ten yet, but a bonfire is started too.
) “When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever.”
He lolls his head over the back of the passenger seat, holds his forehead with both hands, smearing blood from his ripped cuticle in the short hairs by his temple.
At a sidelong glance, Dean realizes that Castiel is smiling back at him - it’s not just a twitch of his lips, it’s a real smile, and it changes his entire face.
Nearby the sigil, there's a table not unlike a gift-table at a wedding, but there are bundles of incense, bottles of holy water, white sage burning out of marble bowls, jars full of black feathers, other glass jars full of honey with the honeycomb still floating around in them, and golden singing bowls being played by a very Joplin-looking woman that Dean has yet to meet.
Several realizations occur to him at once; first, that Castiel is sincerely, expressively happy at seeing Dean be happy, even if he doesn’t get what’s going on, or all he gets is that it’s at his own expense.
“Heaven left me, Dean. I was of no more use. God - my creator - saw no use in me, the Angels - my family, my
The expression on Sam's face is a cross of anger, frustration, grief, obstinacy, and heavy, heavy sympathy.
“My love, please,” was begged of him, “See reason here. I want you on my side, I do not want to be at odds with you, one and only. Seek sense in me, I promise you will find it. I wouldn’t spout nonsense for the sake of nonsense.”
shame for what he wants from Dean, and he's knowingly choosing to worship at Dean's altar in a fucking Chevy Impala over knowing his own home in the Kingdom of Heaven, and he'd make the same choice given a million opportunities.
When Sam inevitably turns away, surrendering to Dean’s silence, Dean unclenches his jaw long enough to say more than one word.
“I never -” Cas decides that venture is futile, and so looks back at Dean, “Sam and you were always better and stronger together, as a team,” Cas insists, stepping up closer, “Whenever you two were divided, Sam in particular was weaker to outside influence, and Lucifer could woo loyalty from stone with his silver tongue - Sam had no hope on his own. Even on his best day, I think in Sam’s loneliness, his despair, and desperation, he did all he could think of to do, misinformed, misdirected, and without your -”
kilig (Tagalog): the feeling of excitement due to various love circumstances such as making first eye contact with one's crush or watching another person propose to someone.
Feeling a great pity for the Angel, Sam adds on, “okay, well… imagine he smiles at you, what do you feel then?”
“... yeah, okay,” he complies, abandoning his busy work to stand in front of Dean, “You're coming because I want you to see something. I want you to see our brother.”
Smiling his most winning smile, Dean straightens up, offers his hand, and nods approvingly when Castiel all but glides into step with him.
There's a noise bubbling from behind Dean, and he turns in abject horror, to see black pools of The Empty squeezing through the bricks in the bunker's wall as a portal begins to open.
Dean waits for further explanation, but when none comes, he figures he ought to know by now that Castiel doesn’t really feel he owes explanations to anyone about anything, and so the resounding silence really shouldn’t come as a surprise.
The Angel is standing there alone, unmistakably ethereal with a backdrop of twinkling stars and lazy fireflies illuminating him; he’s examining his hand as though Dean may have left a mark or a message on him somehow.
Setting his drink down, Dean worries at Castiel’s overt and obviously anxious expression, “hey. Relax,” he tries.
He tastes blood, and he wonders if the next thing he'll know is being in a pine box, and needing to break free. It's not funny, but he laughs anyway.
With a noise that's a cross of pain, shock, and pleasure, Castiel jumps again, his wide hands splaying over the top and back of Dean’s head, pushing Dean against him while pressing himself more in.
They—they can’t.  They can’t escape!  Luc will catch them, and he’ll kill Dean’s parents like he killed Sammy. O-Or he’ll kill all of them in his rage.
“I know we have the First Aid box…” he sighs, eyes flitting back open with a new flare of barely restrained panic that gets Dean’s stomach in knots, “But the way that
There’s a pause—not a silence.  Silence is static and electronic humming; this is a shaky breath from a deep voice.  Dean’s own air supply catches in his throat.
Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel saw his husband shuffle over toward the couch.  Those broad shoulders were slumped, and his usually perky nature seemed bogged down.  Instead of flopping down into the space on the couch between the armrest and Castiel’s drawn-up legs, Dean sat down on the floor at Castiel’s side.  Dean let his eyes flutter shut and he nosed at Castiel’s crooked knee, a lowly, tired hum leaving his husband’s body on an exhale.
Sharp pleasure-pain suddenly blossoms from Dean’s nipple, dragging a pitiful sound out of him.  Cas is simply staring up at him with the sensitive nub still pulled between their teeth, when Dean’s squeezed eyes open enough to meet Cas’s gaze and the fucker rolls their jaw, sending another round of fireworks bursting beneath his skin.  He’s seeing fucking
The hands on his shoulders squeeze, sure and gentle just like the man Sammy grew up to be, “People have been telling you it’s your fault for a
“Cas,” Dean gasps, his muscles tighten again.  It’d been an hour since he asked Garth for an update about Cas.  Wasn’t he supposed to be out of surgery soon?  Was he out now? “C-Cas was there, too.  Uh, with m-me and Jack and he—”
Dean doesn’t want to see it though, so he busies himself shuffling through the box past some old Thomas the Tank Engine trains.
you to promise me that, okay?  Please? ‘Cause I can’t take--I’ve seen you broken and bloody too many times...”
Is it still gonna feel like home?  Without his Dad there? Don’t even get him fucking started on how weirdly numb his brain still is to that fact.  Will it still feel like home with Jack and all the memories of the basement riding shotgun?  Can it even be home if Cas isn’t there, too?
Frustration starts to roil inside of Dean.  Given all the shit Luc does it shouldn’t be so damn difficult to say the words.  But a part of him thinks that maybe it’s
The dark brooding mask they’ve had worn at the bar is gone now as they hold themselves steady above him.  Always so patient when Dean can’t find the words.
“Well, I was thinking—it’s supposed to be a really nice day...maybe we should spend it outside.  Just get away from all this for the day and see the beach?  How does that sound?”
“Actually,” Mary’s own smile winds into a smirk, “That’s not a bad idea.  We could take a trip up to the attic.  Get Jack some of your guys’ old clothes.  See if anything of Dean’s found its way up there,” Her cheek twitches, “Maybe catch you up a little?”
Now, he thanks the angel Castiel that there’s enough light for him to make a quiet getaway without falling on his ass in the still unfamiliar space.  It’s a fucking miracle Jack doesn’t wake up at Dean’s gaspy breathing, or that he even has the mental wherewithal to remember to be quiet when he closes the bedroom door with a soft
A few drops patter down from the heavens onto his bare legs.  Then a few more.  And even more after that.
“Dean,” the sheriff starts, voice just this side of talking down to him.  His skin is practically buzzing, “I’m sorry but you don’t have a choice—”
“Does that feel good, sweetheart?” His fist wraps around her, moving in quick, slippery strokes.  Deanna trembles, hips stuttering between pushing back onto his cock and moving into his hand.  A choked moan vibrates through her back and against his chest.
“You can’t save everyone, my friend,” A softness warms the eyes that look up at him, “Though you try.”
“Dean?” Dean’s throat clicks around a wet, whiny noise that he can’t reel in fast enough, “Dean, what’s wrong?”
Something warm and sappy squirmed in his chest for the umpteenth time that day at the image of Dean, with his rolled-up jeans, walking in the glittering sand.  Square sunglasses perched on his barely crooked nose, hunched dramatically as he tried to protect his slice of cake from the seagulls overhead…
“I wanna go home, Dean…” Cas’s shoulders shiver under his t-shirt and against Dean’s leg.  His resolve melts like ice chips under the sun and soon his hands are lightly rubbing over Cas’s arm and back.  The boy flinches at the touch, spine going rigid.  Dean immediately starts to pull away, but Cas’s body seems to only follow his hands as they retreat.  Holding his breath, Dean slowly lets his palms settle back onto sharp shoulder blades.  He feels the boy sigh under him.
Castiel’s heart clenched with a brilliant squeeze beneath his ribs, and he knows he’s fallen just that much more in love.
“Aw, you take such good care of me, angel,” Dean cooed, dropping to his knees before them, big hands stroking over Cas’s leg hair.  Cas rolled their eyes and jutted their hip to the left but couldn’t help the way their lips twitched up at one side.  Forest green glimmered up at them.
Cas’s length slip-slides once, twice over his entrance, teasing the sensitive, twitching area, “C’mon…I gotcha…”
bad.  C’mon, i’s actually super warm if you swim around a little.  You just gotta get used to it.  Yeah?” The cold blanketing every inch of Castielle’s can’t hold a candle to the sudden rush of warmth that courses in her veins when steady fingers tuck a curl behind her ear.  Damn him, knowing exactly how to make her knees weak.
“I--” a raspy cough crackles like lightning.  With a wet click, the other boy continues, “Where are you?”
He’s just glad all their stuff isn’t stored in the basement.  Dean’s pretty sure he’s never going in anything deeper in the ground than a puddle for the rest of his natural born life.
“Okay,” his voice is fainter now--but at least he’s talking.  His cheeks turn pink and eyes fall to where his fingers play at the hem of Dean’s shirt, “I...I think I’ll stay here though.”
“Well,” Mary scooches in on his left, “If you like them—ah, I think you’d also like these guys, too.”
A breathy whine trickles from his princess’s lips when Castiel’s hand travels even lower to the warmth of her thigh and he starts to draw the billowing fabric of the skirt up.  Inch by inch Castiel scrunches the material into his palm, exposing silky, light-colored legs to the warmth of the room.  His princess shivers against his chest as the chiffon glides over her skin, leaving goosebumps in its wake.  Deanna’s hand reaches up and threads into his hair, tugging his head in even closer.
The heaviness in the other boy’s voice makes Dean’s bones ache a little.  He pushes the feeling to the side, shooting a wink over his shoulder at his friend, “I’m always right, dude.”
“Okaaay,” Kevin huffs, letting his chin drop to his collarbone as Charlie smears the last of the pungent lotion.
Mary’s cheeks get a little pink and her eyes drop to the floor, “I can’t imagine what you went through over there, baby—what you all went through,” she glances at Jack and bites at her lip, “I know the kind of things you saw...and did everyday...it’s not your fault if your mind deals with it in funny ways--”
Castiel came back out of the closet to find innocent, emerald green eyes watching him return.  Dean wore a dopey grin as Castiel removed the come-splattered crop top and shimmied the briefs with the cartoon cowboys up around Dean’s hips--being gentle, of course, when tucking his sensitive cock into the underwear.  He moved down to his baby’s hairy legs and rubbed at the muscles upon remembering Dean’s wince from earlier.  While Castiel was powerless to turn back the clock on the cartilage in his baby’s knees, he could certainly massage some of the tightness out of Dean’s thighs before they started to bother him like they sometimes did.  When Castiel surmised that he’d worked out the majority of the kinks he placed a kiss on each knee and stood back up.
on every other thrust.  Pushing his jerking hips deeper, they say, “Don’t come until I say.  Do you understand, sweetheart? Don’t come.”
Sammy rises back to his feet, towering over them all.  He still fidgets like a kid though and the thought has something dull and pleasant thumping around in Dean’s chest.
Dean can’t say it.  He can hardly think about his best friend as the bloody, tangled mess he’d last seen on that black top—let alone fucking describe it.
Ripping himself out of the hospital bed, Dean surges toward the bathroom.  The weird grippy socks they gave him are the only reason Dean doesn’t slingshot right past the door, narrowly missing the light switch as he drops to his knees.  In the hot second it takes him to get the toilet lid pulled, the first spasm in his stomach has acid shoving up his throat and out onto the tiles.  By the second heave, he’s face-planted into the cavern of the toilet bowl.  The blood pounding in his ears is only magnified by the echo of the ceramic.  The world is blurry and bitter and it all fucking
Dean’s tongue is thick and lazy like a slug in his mouth, refusing to form the letters he needs it to.  He tries to twist again and, this time, he realizes it’s Jack’s slender hands that are holding where the duct tape is still pinning his arms to his back.  Frustration roils in his stomach and Dean keeps pulling, and struggling, and pulling.  The smell of smoke and burnt rubber is pushing through his cloudy senses, bringing the world and his thoughts into focus.
“I’m sorry,” she grits again, widening her stance a little.  Dean’s shoulders hike up and he finds his own legs widen to square off.  If she thinks he’s just gonna back down from a fight she’s got another thing coming—he’s earned way worse bruises for way stupider reasons.  Meg’s eyes have get considerably less soft, “You can’t go in there.”
The night sky is pitch black through what Dean can see of the windshield. A smooth, dark blanket that’s pricked with white stars, and Dean starts crying the minute he sees it.
Dean orgasm.   It was the first time Castiel had realized that, yeah, this was actually going to work.  Dean hadn’t asked for more than Castiel could offer.  He’d been comfortable the whole time once he’d seen the mechanics in action,
“But I don’t underst--” Then Cas’s body goes rigid and the hunter squeezes a little tighter, “your mother...Oh,
Y’know--if they weren’t just totally non-real, made-up, fictional monsters.  Which, of course, they are.
It’s the driving force behind Dean, pen in hand, as he abandons the table by the windows that he, Jack, his family, and the cop eagle-eyeing over them in favor of making a b-line to the condiment island along the opposite wall.
After three more guided breaths, the tightly-wound bow of Dean’s body seemed to snap, and he slumped back into the bed like a puddle of warm ice cream.
Stepping away from the bed, Cas reaches into the bottom drawer of their dresser.  They pull out the fluffy towels, tube and a half of KY, the strap-on harness, and, lastly, the ribbed purple dildo.  Anticipating emerald pools watching their every move.
