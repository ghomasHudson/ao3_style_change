“Whatever,” John grumbled and closed his eyes, trying desperately not think about what his mother was going to say, what the kids and teachers at school would say, what would happen to Sherlock, would he go to jail, how he could prevent him from going to jail? It was just too much, too many questions, and too many variables. W
It was no surprise when Sherlock logged in under
“Punishment?!” John said, flabbergasted at the fact that he just threw up and now they wanted to punish him.
“Sherlock, I would never be happy to see someone die,” John said, sick at even thinking about it. Hell, he’d do it all over again, even if Sherlock beat him.
Chapter 6 – Been Away too Long
“Why?” he had to ask as curiosity was one of his few weaknesses.
“Sherlock, wait,” John put his hands on the pale chest, moaning slightly with a particularly tight squeeze at the tip of his cock. He didn’t know if he could do this, it was one thing to let Sherlock take him but now it was his responsibility to-
“But…but my mum? You said she thinks I’m dead, right?” The thoughts of his mother crying over his tombstone filled the boy’s head, bringing tears once again to his eyes. He loved her, even with all her faults and shortcomings she was still his mum and John had always taken care of her when his dad died.
“Yes ma’am,” John said, staring at the floor.
Breathing deeply, John ignored what Sherlock’s presence and voice was doing to him, and continued to wash his hair.
“You liked the way Sherlock made you feel, emotionally and physically, didn’t you?” John nodded. “And you miss that feeling, yes?” Again, John nodded. “You think no one in the world is ever going to give you that again?”
John sat dumbly on his haunches, trying to make sense out of why they would let him choose. However, the thought of eating out of someone’s hand while he was on his knees infuriated John, clouding his rational mind with thoughts of escape and vengeance.
“Yeah, because Doms are stupid,” John said, scrubbing out the rest of the bubbles.
John simply nodded, blowing out a bit of hot air, which ricocheted off the leather and blew a bit of hair from his brow. “Let’s have a look here,” Sherlock grabbed ahold of John’s head, turning it this way and that as if the Sub was nothing but a rag doll. “There is padding but you threw quite a fit back there.” His head was pushed forward into the man’s chest while the two straps, one above and one below his ear, were readjusted so they didn’t pinch the small hairs or interfere with the collar.
Mycroft knitted his eyebrows together and for a moment, John panicked, thinking he was mad.
“Oh, uhh, no, I really don’t know where else they’d go. The pipes are the only place I know about,” John lied, proud of himself for keeping cool and not stuttering over his words. The Doms however, didn’t look convinced, which made the teenager start to squirm in his seat.
“Sh-Sherlock, I-I…I understand,” he forced out while the knot in his throat grew larger. With a final kiss, just below his left eye, John realized he would never be alone again in carrying his weight.
“John!” A small voice shouted when the glass doors to the room opened. The teen’s face lite up when he saw Molly run into the room. It wasn’t necessarily the fact that she was so happy to see him that made John beam, but that she had on a brand new shirt, her hair and face were clean, and their seemed to be no bruises on her skin. The young girl was being well looked after by whoever Mycroft had given her to, which John would be forever grateful to the man for that kindness.
Tears of panic and all the unnamed feelings that ran through his mind, poured from his face. John turned the corner, praying that the collar remote had a small transmitting radius. The thing that worried him even more though, was where the fuck was he going?
“No, seriously,” John told him, a shiver running through him at every touch.
John's POV after their first night together.
“I’m so-so sorry.”
“Just punish him and get it over with Mycroft before we die of old age,” Sherlock snapped and left the room without so much as a look at John, who was trembling.
“Okay, okay, we are headed to the Holmes place from the hospital. We’ll pick you up on the way. Just sit tight for me, Jim.”
Bursts of flavor danced along his tongue with every suck. Sweet marshmallows and coffee filled his senses in a way only Sherlock could. John relished every drop that hit his tongue until his beast became sated and his cognizant mind started to return. Reluctantly, John pulled away, licking the two bright red marks until they closed up completely. He slowed his hips, looking down at the hardness in his pants.
Poor John's embarrassed. Sherlock is the John whisperer. Greg offers John a Deal. And yep, Mycroft's still a bastard.
“He may,” Mycroft said, turning to face John, giving him a pleading look.
The door slammed behind him, and John’s fate was sealed. There was no turning back and he would have to make the most important decision of his young life. “Where to, Mr. Watson?” the Cabbie asked the million pound question.
This bliss though, this bliss was something Sherlock had not foreseen. This was something that could take John away from him from the inside.
Anyways, thank you so much for keeping my spirits up while writing this, you all are the reason I decided to come up with a sequel. I hope you enjoy this update!
“I would love that, John. Have you…well, have you ever given one before?” Sherlock rolled over, bringing John with him so he lie on top of the broad chest, bracing his arms on either side and straddling the man’s thin waist. Originally, he was planning on just winging it and trying his best to copy what Sherlock had done to him instead of admitting more inexperience. He nodded his head, not meeting the man’s gaze. “Then I’m honored, it’s okay,” he cooed, running a hand through the bed head victim that was John’s blonde hair. “You don’t have to rush, take all the time you need, yeah. We have all the time in the world now, John.”
End of part 2
“Normally I would be the one doing this, but since I can barely move my arm, Sherlock will be taking over. John,” he motioned towards Sherlock, “you will receive a spanking of 40 swats.”
though, was the only question, John really cared about. “W-what’s going to happen to Sherlock?” he whispered, the sound barley rising above the engine.
“Oh, well isn’t that lovely. Have you bedded him yet?” she asked, pulling slightly on her lead to make sure her Sub was still there.
“It’s John,” Mycroft said, his tone serious and to the point. “We’ve lost track of him on the CCTV.”
John had two options; leave Sherlock’s come inside him until his own body started to absorb it, or push it out like Sherlock told him to do. In the end, John wanted to get this over and get some feeling back into his limbs so he could beat the ever loving piss out of the man. He pushed and a moment later, globs of white pearly come oozed out of his swollen hole.
“But I-” John tried to defend himself, but was cut off by the eldest Holmes holding up a hand.
The rage boiled inside him as soon as Moriarty picked the lock and entered their home,
John knew he wouldn’t be released until he did what Mycroft said, so John swallowed and lowered his head. “I’m sorry for using foul language in front of you, Greg.”
The woman merely gave him a sad smile and stood up. “John,” she said, her voice kind, as if talking to a child, “while I appreciate your idealistic youth, your naiveté will not help us win this war.”
“I said stop it!” John shouted one more time, then hung his head in defeat. He knew there was no way he could fight off Sherlock, no way he could stop his body from responding to being filled up.
Sherlock, however, had two ice cream cones in one hand while the other was typing on his mobile. It seemed like he had no idea John was even there until he finally spoke. “Why aren’t you in your room?” he asked without looking up.
“John, I need you to listen to me, okay? Can you do that,” Sherlock commanded, placing his hands on either side of John’s cheeks.
When the car finally stopped, Sherlock was as pale as a sheet and his pupils had blown wide. “Mycroft,” he whined, huddling over. The eldest Holmes sighed and wrapped his arm around his brother, working him out of the car slowly.
John was quiet for a moment, trying to figure out what answer Sherlock was looking for. Why wouldn’t he pull Mycroft out? It wasn’t like the Dom had beat him, or assaulted him. No, Mycroft had given him a warm place to sleep, food, water, and not to mention he was John’s Dom. “He saved me,” John said, looking down at his hands and then pulling the thin blanket up to his neck.
“Okay, thanks,” was all the young man could think to say, though to be honest he really wasn’t processing what was going on completely.
As soon as he felt the hard plastic break under his foot, John knew he’d made a mistake and both he, Sherlock, Greg, and Mycroft would pay the price for his ignorance. The ‘proxy’ exploded with a light so bright it through John back a few feet. It was ultra violet and it burned, it burned like John had never felt.
“Like hell I will!” John said, picking up his plate and fork. Before he could shovel the first bite of sausage into his mouth, Mycroft snapped his fingers. Confused, John looked up from the plate in his hand and stared at Mycroft.
Greg has his arm wrapped around Mycroft as he hauled the man to the bed. Mycroft was still out of it, if his blown pupils and content expression was anything to go off of.
She looked at Mycroft and then back at John. “No one owns me. Now, on Satu-”
“It’s okay to be upset, John,” Sherlock told him, clipping the lead to his collar.
“Well, that is if you behave yourself and you do want to behave yourself, don’t you John?”
John stood up, leaving his crutch behind, and hobbled over to the closed door. He knocked a few times. “Sherlock? Sherlock, are you okay?” When no answer came, John opened the door to a large bathroom with white and blue tiled walls. There was a stand up glass shower with silver trim and a big bath tub standing on four lion’s feet. Sherlock was sitting in the tub with a mound full of bubble surrounding him.
“Yes, John is just finishing his breakfast,” Mycroft told him, motioning for John and Sherlock to follow. “Are the other Subs being taken care of?”
“See,” Mycroft continued to pull on the hairs at the back of John’s neck and gently pluck at the collar.
“John, why aren’t you upstairs yet?” Sherlock asked as he came into the main entrance. Without another word, he grabbed John’s arm and tugged to make him follow. The boy stood up, his head hung low from the pain and embarrassment of not being able to stand up to Mycroft. He knew he should be able to handle it, but it just hurt so much.
After they took John away, leaving the boy in capable and bribed hands, Mycroft felt like he was facing a huge chess game where the one with the most money
After what seemed like forever of that dull burn, Sherlock finally pulled out and John’s eyes widened when he felt something much wider press between his cheeks. “Are you ready to be mine, John?” the older man whispered in his ear.
However, when Sherlock decided to keep John, that room became abandoned as they both moved into the more spacious study on the main floor. The furniture was rich mahogany and chocolate colored leather, a brick fireplace stood in the corner, casting a soft glow on the burgundy and gold Persian rug. The entire ambiance was warm as he held John on the wide couch, looking at all the small objects on the desk and mantle, which served as memorandums to their new life on Baker Street. His favorite piece, the one that was always his first stop when he entered the room, was an antique Edison gramophone with dark cherry wood and an engraved brass horn, which recalled every time John moaned Sherlock’s name into the man’s ear. All Sherlock had to do was hold the object and a rush of memories would flood him, keeping him sated until he could hold the real John in his arms.
“I do…but, but,” he did trust the man. He hadn’t an hour ago when he heard the two men talking downstairs about him and Victor. Now, though, after Sherlock chose not to give him back or even shoot him but to instead make love to him, well if that didn’t instill trust, John didn’t know what did.
John looked over at Mycroft, his eyes wide. John didn’t know what to say.
“Oh don’t be obtuse, John, it does not bode well for Sub stereotypes,” Sherlock scoffed. He flicked the collar once to show what he was talking about, “my brother likes to pretend this is just a behavioral incentive but it so much more than that, and I know how to use it.”
“How many humans have you killed this year? This month, even?” Sherlock asked him.
“No, I wasn’t there, John, none of us were. However, I’ve known Sherlock for a very long time and I know how manipulative he can be, especially when a person wants to be…manipulated. I know you want to protect him but you aren’t helping him by covering for him, John. Sherlock is ill and I need you to be honest with me so I can help him, do you understand, son?”
Sherlock slowly walked over and crouched down by John’s head. He petted a hand through the blonde hair and smiled. “Sleep now vampire, there is much to do in the morning.”
was all John could think, or rather was unable to think anything else because his feelings were so damn conflicted his head hurt worse than the actual burn marks on his shoulder.
John looked over at the boy, who had his back turned to him. The thought had never crossed his mind, to be honest. He was so desperate to get Molly and get out of there, he really hadn’t had time to process what was happening.
“Good,” Mycroft smiled, and Molly was pretty sure it was the first time she’d ever seen the man’s teeth. “Now, I think I can distract Greg long enough for you to eat a piece,” he said, whispering to her as if conspiring to take over the world.
He had just bitten Sherlock and changed him into a vampire. A bloody vampire! Sherlock had never asked for that, and now his choice was taken away. John covered his mouth in shear horror. “What have I done?”
“I can’t stay here Sherlock. It’s not right, this isn’t my life. I’m not yours, I’m not a thing,” before John could finish his sentence, the hand on his chest tightened painfully. He began kicking his legs only to have Sherlock’s longer ones lift up and over his. A growl hit his ears, halting all the boy’s movements.
“Mycroft, I thought you had business to attend to in your office,” Sherlock said nonchalantly, “I was just taking John in to see Dr. Magnussen.”
“John,” he reached around to untie the knot holding the gown together, “you can either let me help you or I can hold you down on the bed and dress you that way.” As soon as Sherlock released the knot, he let go of the string and the gown fell to the floor, pooling around John’s sweaty feet.
“You brought this on yourself, John,” he said, untying his robe and letting it fall gracefully to the floor. “If you just did as you were told and bent over, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” Sherlock stood behind John, rubbing his hands possessively over his flank, from his neck all the way down to his arse. He started using his nails, making John groan and shiver in response.
John growled viciously, then threw Sherlock at the wall. “Leave,” he said and rolled over on the bed, pulling the comforter up around him.
“Yes, I know,” she said, barely glancing at him. She opened a manila folder in front of her and waited for Mycroft to acknowledge her.
“Oh, what are ya gonna do fairy, hit me?” The boy said when John clenched his fist. He could feel his face getting red, both from anger and embarrassment.
“None of that is important. Anthea is an exceptional employee, Dom or Sub.”
“Though it might appear you have no say in what happens to you here, we will allow you to choose who you wish to feed you, bathe you, and sleep with you.”
“You’re going to hurt yourself,” Sherlock told him when he stepped out of the bathroom. The Dom quickly strode over to him and placed his hands on either side of John’s head, making his thumbs meet just between John’s eyebrows. He started massaging the area, forcing John’s face to relax in the process. “Stop thinking so hard and the answer might come.”
“It hurts,” the boy whined, trying to roll over onto his stomach, but Sherlock stopped him by pulling John tighter to his chest.
“Yes, I was,” John finally answered, knowing that there was no use in fighting.
“Keep him in there until we get the kid in the car, damn it!” The man holding him shouted when only the top of Sherlock’s head could be seen over the bodies invading their home.
Underestimating how much the detective did not want the drops; John lost his balance and toppled on to the ground to get away from the flailing form below him. “Damn it Sherlock,” John shouted as he hit the floor with a loud thud but thankfully keeping his hand up right and saving the liquid from spilling. “I’m trying to help you, here. Do you want to go deaf?”
“It’s okay,” he cooed, pulling the boy into his tight embrace, swearing to himself right then and there that he would never let John go again. There was really no point in sending his boy back into a world that taught him to think so poorly of himself and made him so scared of being with someone he loves.
“I said relax John, I’m not trying to hurt you but you’re hurting yourself from worrying too much,” he snapped at the boy, hating himself for it but knew that tough love was sometimes the only way to get through to his stubborn boy.
Just as he was about to give up and throw the silky fabric across the room, Sherlock appeared behind him and grabbed his hands. “Let me help,” was all the man said before he took the material in hand and began looping it in and out of itself. John felt the warmth of Sherlock on his back, and that strange feeling of safety mixed with danger ignited his nerves. “You look very handsome, John,” Sherlock said when he was all done. He patted the Sub’s chest, then backed away.
“A tracker, I think, glued to the can. I’ve never seen one like it before. It was as flat as paper, hell I wouldn’t even have thought to look if you hadn’t said something.”
There was a long minute with no response, so John set his jaw and continued to type.
Instead of a heartbeat, he heard a growl, and in an instant, his throat was grabbed in a vice grip and he was lifted almost completely off the bed, his toes barely touching the sheets.
John asked himself as he sat back in his chair, stretching. As if knowing he would be done, Sherlock came in from the other room with a wild look in his eyes. “John, get dressed, there has been another murder, a ritualistic hanging it seems. This is the fifth one in three weeks,” Sherlock said, buttoning his dress shirt.
At two o’clock, an hour after Sherlock had decided to stab three different types of pillows to measure the amount of feathers that came out, Lestrade texted him about a murder. “Oh thank God,” The detective sighed, throwing on his coat and grabbing his mobile just in case his boy needed him again. He would go to the crime scene, solve the Yards petty murder for them and be back in time for John to tell him all about his practice. “Perfect!”
Sherlock let his lips go, and with a smile, started washing over John’s arse and thighs. He held John steady while he squatted before the shorter man and took him completely into his mouth. John gasped as blood immediately rushed to his limp member, making it grow while it was still inside Sherlock’s mouth. With an expert tongue swirling over the head, John let his head drop back and grabbed the mop of brown curls between his legs.
“What visitor?” Mycroft grabbed his shoulder when they were half way up the stairs. “Did Jim come visit you, Sherlock?”
“He’s mine,” Sherlock snapped, angry at just the thought of someone else, especially Jim Moriarty, touching his property.
“Yeah, these people had everything we needed! Guess what, it was even sitting out on the counter top, like it was just begging to be taken,” Harry laughed, excited at how full her tote was.
The moment Sherlock checked the text, he knew his John had made it on the team. Of course he already knew this, his boy was the most exquisite creature on the face of the Earth, so how could he not succeed in some stupid football game.
“Good night, my love,” Sherlock whispered over the unconscious body lying in his bed. The body was his now, his, and now it was time to ensure no one would ever take John away from him. The detective licked the boy’s cheek once, buried his nose in the soft blonde hair for a moment to see if the scent had changed any, and then turned off the light on his way out of the room. Sherlock had given the teenager the proper dosage of his homemade sedative, which he’d tested out on himself many times, in order keep his boy asleep for 10-15 hours. However, the detective had been planning this moment ever since he talked to the boy on the phone and knew it would only take six hours to complete his possession.
John used his bare heel to aim for Sherlock’s shin, putting all the force he could behind the attack. A grunt escaped behind the mask though when the Dom grabbed his foot in mid-air, holding it hostage to make John jump a few times to keep his balance. “I guess not,” Sherlock mocked, keeping a steel grip on his foot. “Let me know when you’re done.” This wasn’t funny, this wasn’t funny at all and that stupid fucking Dom was making a joke out of tying someone up against their will! John growled once and then halted his movements when the muscle in his thigh started to cramp up from the awkward angle. “Good, now I’m going to put your foot down, John. If you try to kick me again I will put you on your back, is that understood.” John breathed out an angry huff through his nose, but nodded so his foot would be released.
“Are you all right? Shall I call for a wheel chair?” Sherlock asked, but John could tell his words were hollow with a touch of sarcasm.
“Everything is going to be alright, John,” Sherlock reassured him while Sebastian began to pace back and forth quickly.
Thankfully, well perhaps for John’s sanity, pain shot through his neck. His teeth bit down, piercing his tongue and making his jaw ache with the force of the shockwaves running through his body. Though he would never admit it, John wanted to kiss Mycroft’s hands for throwing him a rope to pull himself out of the trance Sherlock seemed to put him under. “I said, open,” Mycroft ordered again. This time, John opened his mouth to accept the food while keeping his eyes diverted to the ground and his head propped up against the Dom’s knee.
“He is a strong one, isn’t he?” Mycroft said with a final kiss to Greg’s hand.
“Wonderful, come on it’s right here. You go ahead and get in, I’ll find another towel and flannel for you.” He followed behind the boy until he tentatively walked into the bedroom,
John eyed the man carefully, then nodded his head when Mycroft seemed to be sincere.
“Yeah? You okay?” The man turned back around, staring at John with kind eyes.
The problem was, John did see, and he hated himself for it. His two Doms must have fucked up his mind more than he thought, because how on God’s green earth could he feel happy that Jim was with Doms and experiencing bliss? Jim should be free in the city somewhere, recruiting other Subs like him. But that’s not how John felt.
“Yeah, I totally agree with you mate!” John chimed in, taking extra care to reassure his friend they were on the same page. “That’s why I was so excited when we talked about these scholarships. Uni will be awesome, I just know it!” Sherlock saw the boy’s pupils dilate even more and the fact that he quickly turned his attention back to the papers meant he was embarrassed by how turned on the older man made him feel. Adding to the flames in the youths lust filled mind, every few seconds the detective would shift his leg, creating the slightest bit of friction between them as they filled out forms. “Can I use the loo?” The teen finally broke.
“John!” Sherlock shouted, but his legs wouldn’t let him stand up.
John freaks out. Greg tries to help. Sherlock needs to work on his Sub etiquette.
“Because we want you to convince them to turn themselves in,” Greg said.
Then, there was a knock at the door. John quirked his head and sniffed the air. Whoever it was, was human, and the blood smelled faintly familiar.
“So what do you need to know?” John asked, setting his tea down and bracing his forearms on his knees.
“I’m a Doctor, lad, let me see your hand,” John insisted, reaching for the bleeding hand. The smell of the blood was exquisite, but John was able to damp down his primal need enough to help the injured human. He’d done it all of his life, well at least the last hundred years he had. “How did you do this?” John asked when he pulled the hand into his palm.
“Good, so everything has been taken care of, correct? I’m not going to find out a month from now that these documents are just for show. You know how I don’t like surprises, Timothy.” Sherlock glared at the man, who immediately paled and unconsciously took a step away from the detective.
“You can’t escape my eyes now John,” Sherlock grinned as he placed another camera just between the shower rod and curtain, above normal eye line so the Watson family would be none the wiser. The intruder looked over the shower, smelling the shampoo that coated his boy’s soft blonde hair and the soap that coated his smooth young body. A shiver of pleasure ran up his spine and down to his now aching cock, but he regained his composure, unwilling to come without John.
“Make him shock me? You’re kidding right?” John took a step back, hitting the door with his back. Sherlock looked up from testing the water with a disapproving look.
“That’s not necessary,” Greg told the Dom, who stood up and loomed over John. Sherlock removed his hand from John’s back, which terrified the teenager even more now that he was alone.
“John?” Jim asked, is voice shyer than John had ever heard.
Warmth flooded his body, making his heart begin to beat lightly in his chest. John gripped the man harder, his instincts telling him to ensure his prey’s immobility.
One thing was for sure though, he would not be leaving John alone, ever.
Sherlock's POV continuing right after the first chapter.
“It’s quite simple, dear. Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes are a vital part for the IBAD industry. If they are eliminated, IBAD will be crippled and that’s when we make our move.” Irene smiled at him, as if she hadn’t just proposed killing two men.
“Yes, that is the plan, I’ve already taken care of the legalities and loose ends so there is no need to worry about reputation,” Mycroft added, earning a frustrated burst of laughter from the other man.
“Now, Sherlock.” Mycroft cut off his younger brother’s protests with a quick jab at the ground with his umbrella.
“Do you think the collar had anything to do with your shift from a rebel Sub to a boy who runs into burning buildings to save his Doms?”
John rushed outside, still holding his stomach. That’s when he initiated part two of his master plan. Thankful for his years as a homeless criminal, John bumped into David as the man turned his back to him. As he exited the car, John pulled David’s wallet from his rear trouser pocket. S
“Says the man who just shot my best friend and ordered him to be put down like some kind of…some kind of DOG!” John felt tears form in his eyes. His throat turned dry and his stomach sank at the thought of Jim being killed because of him.
“Yeah.”
“John, I’m trying to help-“
A low rolling growl came from the vampire, and before Sherlock knew what happened, John latched on to the sensitive part of his inner thigh. “Ah!” his scream turned into a moan of pleasure when John started to suck greedily from the pale thigh. John’s hand moved down slowly to grip the waist band of Sherlock’s pants and pull them down. Sherlock’s hard cock sprang free, bouncing once off his belly.
“We’ll talk about it while we eat, yeah?” Sherlock smiled and pulled on his sleep trousers and a baggy grey shirt.
The plan seemed to work too, as Sebastian released John and focused on Sherlock again. “Sherlock,” John called to him, making his heart melt from only two syllables.
“Yes, John, we’ve already contacted your mother. She’s so happy you’re alive. Sherlock made everyone think you were dead!” Greg said, realizing his mistake after it was too late.
He refused to look intimidated though, because that would only validate his own inadequacies, so he grabbed some more soap and slowly worked his way down the trail of hair until he was gripping Sherlock’s hard cock. He heard a soft moan above him, bringing a pleased smile to his lips at the fact that he could cause the older man to make the same sounds as he did. He worked his hand up and down, just like Sherlock had done, until the tip was a bright red. The man pulled him away and suddenly pushed him against the wall, pushing his chest up against the boy’s back.
“Teddy doesn’t eat honey,” Molly corrected, looking up at the man with a playful smile. “He likes leeks and rice and-and corn!” Suddenly, her eyes caught John’s and to the teen’s horror, the little girl waved at him.
Sherlock's POV four days after John was shot.
Sherlock’s face fell at the words, sadness glazing his eyes over for a moment and as soon as it had arrived, it was replaced by indifference.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know, John, me neither.”
John closed his eyes, and fell back into a deep sleep.
John woke up to a loud shout. He shot up immediately, feeling light headed, but on edge enough that he was able to ignore it. Even though he was in Sherlock’s room in the new house, it felt strange and a bit eerie to be alone. John jumped up, throwing his legs over the edge of the bed and hissing in pain when his left foot hit the ground. The burns on his ankle were a constant ache and every sharp move sent pain through his entire leg.
“Sorry, I think I left some oranges in there too long,” the man laughed turning his back to John and pouring two glasses of milk. He put the container back into the contaminated fridge and sat down across from John, sliding a glass to the boy. “Drink up, I promise it wasn’t the milk,” he smiled and took a sip.
“John?” a nurse said, peeking her head into the room. Her eyes went wide when she saw he had taken a hostage.
There were heavy foot falls at his back and they were getting closer by the second. Nurses, doctors, security, and most likely his Dom were all chasing him and trying to grab him as he twisted and turned out of their grasp.
“Well, Sherlock, we’re going to get you cleaned up, yeah.” John dabbed some gauze in disinfectant and started to apply it to the cut. “This is going to sting a bit.”
“You will keep an eye on him,” it wasn’t a question.
He hadn't expected that, not in a million years, but then he kicked himself for putting Sherlock into a stereotypical box of careless lovers he saw in the movies and porn.
“So this John Watson, the file you sent me, he’s staying with Sherlock indefinitely?”
“I’m not that young,” the boy said defiantly.
“John?” Sherlock asked, placing his hand in the middle of John’s back. Once again, the calming presence stilled the Sub’s nerves and helped him refocus on the task at hand.
“I’m sorry, Mike-“ his voice pleading but it didn’t do any good. Without another word, he ran, leaving the food behind as tears ran down his face, which were most likely from hurt pride at giving in so easily to a Sub’s command. “Fuck, Harry, Jim go after him, would ya? I’ll carry Molly back to the Pipes…” John looked over at Jim for the first time since they’d left the house. The teen’s dark eyes where wide with panic as he looked down at both empty hands, hands that were not holding onto the little girl’s. “Jim!”
“No!” John’s head shot up immediately, ready to beg for Sherlock not to torture him like he did with the cock ring. It did feel good at the end, the final explosion when Sherlock removed the piece of silicone, but the wait was so infuriating. However, he was learning, at least that’s what Sherlock had told him, because they had done it enough times for John to finally realize all he had to do was lie back and trust his lover to take care of him, which he always did.
Hello everyone!
Hello again! Thanks to everyone who commented and left kudos. It always makes my day a little brighter(:
“What…oh God, how did you-?”
“Where did they take John?” Sherlock demanded. He had a large bandage over his left eyebrow and a dark bruise around his jaw and neck. The Dom seemed on edge, like he wanted to wring somebody’s neck.
It burned something horrible, but it was well worth it when John pulled the kettle off and rushed over. “What happened?!” he said, panicked. Sherlock dropped the piece of glass, which had inadvertently cut his hand too.
John cleared his throat, his hands worrying Sherlock’s shirt sleeve behind him. “Well, umm, it’s kind of hard to explain. I guess at first I was scared and I…I tried to fight it, but it did feel amazing, like being in a hot tub. Now, umm, now I’ve become more used to it and it helps when I’m sad or, or hurt.”
“See, you know you love what I do to you, John.” He could hear the smile on the man’s face. It made him angry that Sherlock was enjoying himself so much while he was tied up like a hog, but he still couldn’t stop his hole from clenching and his cock from filling up.
“Why…why did you do that?”
It was strange, but the hospital seemed empty. They didn’t pass anyone as they walked down hallway after hallway. It didn’t make sense until Mycroft spoke up. “Good Job, Gregory.”
“Sherlock?” Mycroft’s voice pulled him out of his musings.
John's POV directly after chapter ten.
John was startled out of sleep and murdered by the man in front of him…
John stood hunched over with a sore bottom and regret in his heart, while Sherlock saw everything the Sub’s lower half had to offer.
“I can…I can feel bliss now, John,” Jim finally looked up, his eyes twinkling a bit in the florescent lights. “It’s amazing. I…I just never knew.”
“Five years! And if he still wants to be with you, then by all means you two have my blessing to bask in each other’s madness. Until then, you are to stay on my short lead while you either work for the FBI here or hunt down Moriarty’s network of child abductions and slave trade. You will keep a tracker on you at all times, a monthly check in will be required and if you miss any of them or your tracker ‘stops working’ then I will hunt you down and make sure you never see John again, is that understood Sherlock?”
“Games?” Sherlock asked, offended by such a statement. “Oh no, John, we won’t be playing games here. You will be on a strict routine, as to insure all my tests are as accurate as possible. You will feed from me-”
“Go upstairs, John,” Mycroft ordered, but didn’t use his push to make the boy follow his instructions.
“Then why don’t you try and explain it to me,” John spat. “You almost killed Jim, me, and my Doms!”
Mycroft sighed a jagged breath. He knew it was the logical thing to do, but the thought of that vampire getting near his little brother again just didn’t set right with him. In the end though, Sherlock’s cries of pain and his pleas won out, and Mycroft un-velcroed John’s ankles. “You will do exactly as I say vampire, or this,” he pointed to the crossbow in Greg’s hand, “is going to take you down.”
Deciding this was too serious to handle on his own, the teen wanted to ask for advice, after all asking for help is a grown-up thing to do, right?
“Yes your penis is of adequate size and girth, John, please don’t ask to compare measurements,” Sherlock was staring at the ceiling, a small smile on his face. This time, John laughed out loud at the first inaccurate assumption of what he was about to ask. “What, isn’t that what boy’s worry about?” The man asked, confused at the boy’s reaction to what he thought was supposed to be a serious subject.
“Good boy, that’s it,” Sherlock cooed in his ear, feeling how the hard cock twitched at the praise. “Come for me John, come while I’m inside of you,” he growled, becoming lost in the sensation of thrusting in and out of the tightness. “Come on, show me you love me John, show me,” his hips bucking harsher, showing John how much he was being possessed, forcing the come out of him.
John was gently placed down on Sherlock’s bed with his rear in the air.
“Mycroft?” he heard John ask. “Do you think you can give him one more?” Sherlock didn’t hear the answer but when both the frigid mouth and hand left his achingly hard cock, the vampire’s mouth started to water. He’d been good, so now it was John’s turn to produce a reward.
John steeled himself, focused on his task as he got down on hands and knees to crawl towards the door, avoiding the room with the light shining.
“Stop?” Sherlock asked playfully, tugging on John’s flaccid penis and knowing full well in less than a minute John’s body would be forced to respond to its lover’s touch. “Are you sure, John?”
“Okay, that’s good right there,” John said, when Sherlock’s teeth were mere centimeters from Greg’s neck. “Sherlock,” John said, keeping one arms wrapped around his vampire and using the other to tilt his head back. “Let his scent fill you, but don’t let it control you. You are in control here, not the blood, not the scents, you.”
John knew he was losing this fight and that lead was going to be attached to the already degrading collar.
At least his parents never had to live with the fact that their child was a vampire who killed people. But, he did miss them from time to time; about every fifty years or so he’d see a girl who reminded him of Harry, or a man who had a mustache just like his father’s.
“I am not!” John said, but it came out more as teenage whining.
The younger Holmes clenched his hands together and looked at his brother, knowing exactly what he was about to say.
“Good boy,” Mycroft said after two minutes of standing in front of John, waiting for the soap to activate. “Now, do you know what wall sits are?”
“Damn it, Mycroft!” Sherlock shouted above him. Shockwaves of pain still coursed through his body when two large hands were placed on the side of his ribs. Small amounts of bliss seeped from his neck, dulling the pain like a fast acting balm. “He’s still injured and you’re hurti-“
“No, don’t leave me! Ahh!” Sherlock’s body straightened out, then arched off the bed as his muscles tensed.
“Sherlock,” a distant voice called to him. The detective opened his eyes to see John burst into a cloud of smoke. “Sherlock!” The voice shouted, coming closer as he was forced to leave the room and the comfort of his mind. “Sherlock!” It was his brother’s voice, which brought him out and into the dull Johnless world he was forced to live in.
Then, John looked up and saw the mirror was broken into small and large pieces, as was his reflection. The boy had stopped crying, finding that some of the pain had receded when his hand throbbed from the lacerations he’d caused. The blood continued to drip on the floor, so, in what felt like slow motion, he walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower, adjusting the tap to warm.
asked and shimmied out of his clothes.
Chapter 12 – Life in Color
John wanted to balk, he really did, but when you’re lying on your back in the laps of two Doms, self-preservation tends to get the best of you. All the Sub could do was put his head back in Sherlock’s lap, and try to figure out a way to use his own bliss instead of depending on theirs.
“Your body is still learning how to process blood as an energy source, sweetheart,” the older vampire said kindly, keeping his palm on Sherlock’s face. “You’ll sleep for at least five hours so your body can completely focus on its transition. Don’t worry, I’ll be here to watch over you while you rest.”
John used the crutch so his left ankle didn’t have any pressure on it, and walked outside to meet Mycroft and Sherlock. Sherlock held his arm close to his chest, the sling helping support it. He was dressed in a simple long sleeve button up with grey slacks, but the normal confident aura that emitted from the man was severely toned down.
John knew surprise was on his side, so he took a deep breath and then slowly began to lick along the detective’s lower spine. “J-John? I’m tired I really don’t…oh!” His protests were cut off when he felt teeth clamp down on his left arse cheek.
The boy didn't know what to say, everything Sherlock had said was focused on him, taking care of him, loving him. John didn’t know what he was supposed to do for the man who talked so sweetly to him. Suddenly, an idea popped in his head and he mumbled a quick, “hold on” over the phone. He pulled up the camera on his mobile and focused the lens on his hard member and took the photo. It didn’t turn out exactly how he wanted but he captured from the tip to his balls so it would have to do. Plus, while he was taking the picture he could hear Sherlock panting and his hands were tied up so he couldn’t wank along with him. He hit send and waited for himself to be judged by the only person whose opinion he cared about.
John paced around the small changing room, debating whether he should send Sherlock a picture of the clothes. He knew he looked ridiculous and didn’t want Sherlock to laugh at him, or worse not want to be friends with a loser anymore. He decided to put his stupid insecurity behind after he saw Sherlock’s next text.
John looked at him in confusion, trying desperately to identify the man who had apparently kidnapped him. “That’s okay, you only know me by my user name, StripedTiger.”
“A tracker that they can use to find us,” Harry chimed in, annoyance in her voice. John glared at his older sister then nodded for Molly to continue.
“God you taste so good, John. You feel so good,” the man below him moaned and thrust up once more and then pulled out slowly. This…this was the worst part of John’s day, the emptiness, the coldness, he was alone again and there was a chance he could float off into space, into a place where not even Sherlock could find him. “Shhh, it’s okay, we’ll use the plug next time, John,” Sherlock cooed, holding him and stroking his wet hair as the boy’s cheek rested on his shoulder. “Let’s see if you can walk downstairs on your own, yeah. Then,” he pulled the boy back to look at him, “if you make it, you can get on the laptop if you want. How does that sound?”
Then, the detective’s voice rang in his ears, telling him exactly what Greg had just told him.
John lay there wide eyed, his lips sealed, but the smell of Sherlock so close to him made him on the verge of losing control. The pale neck above him pulsed with delicious blood, and it took all John had to tune out the soft thumping of Sherlock’s beating heart.  Then, pain shot through his jaw, forcing his mouth open.
Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of John talking in his sleep. The boy’s face was scrunched up in pain and he was repeating ‘please, no ‘please, no’ over and over again under his breath. To calm his Sub, Sherlock pushed out a small amount of bliss and placed his hand on the side of John’s face.
With another sigh, perhaps self-loathing or acceptance, and a quick gulp of the rest of his whiskey, Greg nodded. “Yes. Damn, this John must be some kind of kid. Hell, I’ve never seen Sherlock so calm at a crime scene before, he only called Anderson a moron once.” Greg stood up with a groan, thanked Mycroft for the drink and left without asking anymore questions regarding his new duties or Sherlock and John’s relationship.
John hesitated, buying enough time to get his thoughts together by rolling out his own charcoal sleeping bag and snuggling down into it. Before he zipped up the edges to keep out the cold, John gave Mike a playful slap on the chest, his friend was lying next to him and hadn’t said a word since their argument. “I’m sorry,” and he was. No one liked being dommed, especially these Subs, who had histories with their Dom parents darker than most would believe possible, or at least deny they believed it. “I was just really scared, Mike. I didn’t mean to-“
“I’ll show myself out,” Greg said, waving once to Sherlock and giving John a weary look.
“Thank you,” John said, breathing a little easier now. He could understand why Jim wanted to go back. Hell, John wanted to go back. It was so much easier to let Sherlock take care of him and all the big decisions.
It was slow, most likely from the medication John was on, but after much coaxing with his mouth, his boy was starting to get hard. Sherlock took John’s entire cock in his mouth and applied just the right amount of pressure to make him squirm at the top of the bed. “Gaaa,” he mumbled, then squealed when Sherlock ran his tongue up and down the slight and head.
“Are you almost done with you fruit, Molly? Remember, you have to eat the whole thing if we are to complete our experiment.” He said, looking down at the girl, completely ignoring John, who was dumbstruck and glued to the spot.
John only nodded, even more afraid than he was before.
“Oh,” Sherlock continued to look up at the ceiling as if he could find the words he needed. “Then, sorry,” he said, his tone a bit sad. Then, he rolled over so his back was facing John.
“You will do exactly as I say, yes?”
“Y-you want me to-“ John motioned from Mycroft to Sherlock, his hand shaking slightly.
Alone and obviously scared,
This chapter is pretty dark, but it gets us were we need to be. The next chapter will be John at the conference, so that's always fun.
Sherlock finally looked up from his table and stood up, fixing John with a serious stare. “I will take off the chains during the day when you bite me. End of discussion.” Sherlock grabbed his table and started to roll it out of the room.
“John, you know I can’t do that. Now, just calm down and tell me what’s going on?” Greg had his gun in his hand, but when he saw the fear in John’s eyes, he slowly put it back in its holster and held up his hands, palms forward.
These weren’t just any murders though, no, they were all too familiar when Sherlock saw the names of the first three families. It took the Detective less than five hours in his mind palace to find where he had seen the names of the children whose parents were hung. He found what he was looking for on the second floor from the basement, where he only ventured after a good thorough fucking and when he held John in his arms to keep the monsters at bay. Dodging around corners and staying in the light wasn’t hard when blonde hair was right under his nose, the soft scent cloaking him with protection.
“Five, I believe,” she said, as they reached the final flight of stairs.
“Damn,” Greg sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. A little bit of life was starting to come back to the human’s features. “What do we do now?”
“Just say no if you don’t want to…but, umm, would you maybe like to meet up this weekend and you know…hangout, like get a cup of coffee or something?” There was a long pause on the other end of the phone that made a dark cloud come over the boy’s confident façade. “If-“
“No, John, I will come up with something else. I am not letting that man anywhere near you.”
Sherlock laid him down, pulling the covers up to his chin as John tried to bat the six blurry hands away from him. “Go to sleep, John. When you wake up, you’ll be a whole new person.”
“What did I do to deserve you, John?” he moaned, feeling his cock growing harder, Sherlock gave a few more rough thrusts and came with a loud  grunt, falling limp on the boy who let him. After a few moments however, the detective could tell the teenager was becoming uncomfortable after the halo of their orgasms faded, so Sherlock popped up preparing for act two. “I think we kind of ruined our clothes, did you bring pajamas with you or do you need to borrow some of mine?” He stood up, watching the boy closely and was pleased to see there was a hint of sadness at the loss of his lover’s warmth in his features.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock actually purred against his side, digging his body deeper into the old vampire. “I’ll take that as a yes,” John said, genuinely laughing for the first time in a very, very long time. No matter how selfish it sounded, John knew he wouldn’t be lonely for at least five years because of what he did to Sherlock. It had been at least one hundred years since he’d had another immortal to share his life with, and hopefully, Sherlock would stay with him for the rest of their eternal lives.
“This will work,” Greg said, trying to convince himself.
“But it won’t happen again and you will never find them if I have anything to say about it,” John tried to pull his hand away but was met with a steel grip.
“John!” he groaned loudly, pain evident in his voice. Sherlock gripped his chest and started shaking. “Please, I need John,” he cried.
John's POV after the events of chapter four.
“John Watson?” without waiting for an answer, Mycroft stepped into the room, his men following behind. “Get down on your knees.”
“Oh it shouldn’t be too hard. After all, some believe it is only an attitude problem that can be fixed with a little discipline. Isn’t that right, John?” Mycroft asked. John swallowed nervously, realizing he still had the soap in his mouth too late and started to cough, hacking up bits of soap onto the floor. John crouched over onto his hands and knees, sticking his finger into his mouth to get out the bits stuck in his teeth.
He wasn’t given a chance though, any chance for that matter, which gave John a slight since of childish pride that the man, a Dom, was scared to turn his back to a sixteen year old Sub.
“Sherlock, stop,” John said sternly, grabbing Sherlock’s chin and forcing his black eyes to look at John’s dark blue ones. Sherlock bared his fangs, trying to appear threatening, but John just glared back at him and tightened his hold on the young vampire’s chin. Finally, he relented, frustrated, but something deep inside him made him want to obey John.
“And why are you so red? I guess you do need someone to shower with you if you insist on burning yourself alive in there.” Sherlock said, a hint of a grin on his face.
“Bye Molly, I’ll see you later,” John bent down and hugged her, letting her wrap her arms around his neck even though it pressed the barbs painfully into his nape.
“Sherlock, please!” John squeezed his eyes together from the burn in his hole. Two fingers just wasn’t enough, and Sherlock was going way to fast until, finally he was fully seated. John squirmed in his ropes, unable to do anything but hang there and take what Sherlock was giving to him.
Then he felt a more uncomfortable stretch when Sherlock tried to put two fingers in instead of just one. “Ah, wait Sherlock don’t!” but his plea was too late, and the burning he felt before, intensified as the fingers sat unmoving inside of him. “Please take them out, it hurts,” the boy whined, his erection flagging slightly.
“What did they tell you to do? Spy on Mycroft and me? Murder us in our sleep?” The man laughed as he spoke, resulting in a growl from John. He could kill them if he wanted to, hell he could do it while they slept, easily.
“I-I’m trying, I’m sorry, please just slow down,” John begged and was met with a deep kiss, calming him enough to focus on the hand bringing him to full hardness again.
“John…you have saved my brother’s life twice in the literal sense, and many more times in other ways that only a few are able to understand.” Mycroft paused for a moment, gazing deep into John’s eyes.
“You lie, vampire,” Mycroft narrowed his eyes.
“I knew that’s how I would catch you,” Sherlock ginned happily. “From the moment I saw you merely drink from that drunkard and not kill him, I just knew it.” He began pacing back and forth, holding his crossbow tightly in his hand. “You’re different,” he said, stopping and staring at John with those icy eyes.
John pressed his nose up against the crook of Sherlock’s neck, hearing how the man’s heartbeat had sped up tremendously. “Sherlock,” John shaky voice said. He tried so hard to fight against that dark part of him, even though he knew it was pointless. In the end, the vampire always won.
“Y-yeah, I tripped and fell down the stairs,” John whispered the facts that hadn’t been true until Sherlock made them so in his boy’s head. He could feel the shy teenager fiddling with the hem of his robe but he kept his eyes on Mycroft the entire time.
The hand on his shoulder tightened like a painful vice, making the teen wince and lift his shoulder out of instinct. “You’ll find out later, John,” Sherlock chimed in. “Come, let’s go upstairs and change before we go to visit Jim.” Sherlock waved him over, but when John tried to move, the pain in his shoulder grew much, much worse.
“You promised you would tell me about Anthea if I was good. And I was. So spill it, Mycroft, how is she a free Sub?”
Mycroft and Sherlock looked at each other for a long moment, having a silent conversation. “I almost died because of this bloody thing and you still want tell me what’s going on?”
“Tell that to the Subs at the conference.” David, a man about twice John’s size, started to move towards John, while Irene left the room. Amy blocked the door for any quick escapes, but John thought he could get by her easily if he could only slip past her male partner.  “Fuck you guys,” John said before leaping off the bed and swinging at the man’s chest.
A harsh knock came again, then John got up to open the door.
The warmth radiating off the two men next to him was starting to make John sweat, but there was nowhere for him to go. He decided to break the silence and try to throw Mycroft for a loop. “So-”
Sherlock sighed and the next thing John knew his arse was on fire. Wave after wave of hard slaps hit his sitspot. John closed his eyes and held his breath, his face turning as red as his bum.
“And who is this handsome little thing?” she said, moving to cup John’s cheek.
I'm sorry I abandoned this story and hurt all of you. When I wrote all these stories I was in a very bad place and it was an escape for me. I tried to kill myself and ended up in a hospital for a very long time. I've since been trying to not indulge in these anymore for my own mental health.
The teen proved his love with a loud shout and Sherlock held the cock tight, feeling the pulsing seed leave his body in waves.
All the reporters started asking questions, until John pointed at a woman, letting her talk first. “John, everyone is so proud of you. What you did was the bravest thing I’ve ever seen a Sub do.”
“I know, love. Let’s get you a bag.” John caressed Sherlock’s cheek once, giving the young vampire more physical contact with his sire, then stood up. Greg had brought in the box of blood and thankfully had put it in the fridge. John pulled out a pack and sat down on the couch, beckoning Sherlock to join him. “I know we eat blood to survive, but you need to learn to control that hunger.”
Hey everyone,
“Don’t lie to me, Sherlock! I will help John but I need to know exactly what happened,” he was losing his temper, which thankfully…or not thankfully seemed to only happen when dealing with his brother.
“Who the fuck are these people and how did they know we were going to be there?” Harry asked, reaching over to grab the can then tossed it from hand to hand. “Why were you so scared when you got back, Johnny?”
“Because I don’t want you to hurt yourself, John, do you understand that? Do you understand what is happening?” Greg’s voice was gentle and coaxing, calming the boy a bit and John removed his hand but kept his back to the door, just in case.
There is a bit of violence in this chapter, so beware. Also, not beta'd so please forgive the errors.
All and all though, John was happy, happier than he’d ever been and he wasn’t alone anymore. Sherlock might not have known the earth revolved around the sun but that didn’t matter when every day it seemed like the man revolved only around John himself. His only complaint was the stupid casts, which prevented him from touching Sherlock, he didn’t care about anything else his appendages could do, John just wanted to touch. However, Sherlock promised him the night before, today was the day he would remove the casts and John would be free to do whatever he wanted. “I just want to touch you,” John whined, staring over at his entire world, who was grinning with some sort of buzz saw in his hands.
to vanish from the boy’s mind. Then, he moved his hand to drape over the still sleeping form and began rubbing gently over his belly. There was hardly any hair on his chest yet, save for a light sprinkling in the center and a trail of light brown leading down from his belly button.
Mycroft sighed again and readjusted his arm in the sling, wincing as he did so. “Must we turn this peaceful drive into an inevitable shouting match? I am really not in the mood today, John.”
“John,” Mycroft bowed his head slightly and shifted in the wooden chair next to John’s bed.
“I’m not going back,” was all John said before he pulled the handle to open the door. However, they had already locked it and by the time he turned around to locate the release, Greg was on him and pulling him back by the collar of his shirt and placing something cold and hard around his wrists. Then, in one awkward move, mostly because of his continued struggles, John was held to Greg’s side with a firm arm wrapped around his shoulders. “Please, Greg, please don’t take me back to my old life, please! I’ll do anything, I promise, whatever you want just don’t take me away from Sherlock, please,” John cried, knowing that begging was his only option because the embrace and handcuffs were too strong.
“Oh quit being such a baby, I’m only going to collect a sample of the liquid your fangs produce. Quite an interesting feat you vampires have, the perfect predator.” Sherlock continued to move forward against John’s hand, pressing the confused vampire onto his back. Straddling John hips, Sherlock held the vial up to the vampire’s lips. “Open.”
“Yes, yes, of course,” Sherlock waved a frivolous hand, excusing himself from the room. Instinctively, John followed, the thought of Sherlock being around another child, a ten year old boy, setting off alarms inside his entire body.
“I…I want you, Sherlock,” John said, his voice squeaking when Sherlock pulled the shirt over his head. He looked down at his feast of golden brown skin below him and he realized he needed to be inside John right now.
“But Sherlock-”
Irene held up her hand, causing Daniel to set the youngest Sub down. “Oh?” she said, standing up and walking,
“Alright, you know the drill, inform the necessary departments please, Anthea. I want a tracker on John Watson at all times and do tell them to try to find a way to bug my brother’s flat without him finding them in the first hour, yes.”
“Seriously, I wanted you to come to your own conclusion. You would realize the people who really care about you are the ones in this house, not those poor Subs who can’t feel bliss.”
With a smile on his face, John opened his mouth to take the entire piece into his mouth. An ‘mmm’ sound made its way out of the Sub’s mouth as he chewed the delicious food. He closed his eyes and pressed his head up against Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling warm and calm. In turn, Sherlock placed his cheek against the side of John’s head, pressing his lips to the boy’s scalp. “You don’t need your own bliss,” he whispered, “you just need to be taken care of.”
When they arrived at the table, Mycroft sat down next to a man who had a white doctor’s jacket and then Sherlock sat next to him. John was pulled into Sherlock’s lap, his legs hanging off the side of the man’s legs and his back supported by a long arm wrapped around him. “Okay?” Sherlock asked closed to John’s ear. John only nodded in response. Though Sherlock’s thighs were bony, there was something comforting about feeling the other man’s warmth enveloping him.
Once they settled and the pain of being jostled subsided, John closed his eyes at the beautiful warmth radiating below him. He felt whole, as if the old Greek myths were true and John had found his other half that Zeus had cut away from him at birth. It was right, and even though John felt guilty for taking Sherlock’s genius and true love away from the world, he knew he was also protecting the world by keeping Sherlock focused on him.
“I think I’m going to take a little nap,” John told Mycroft, who nodded his head.
Sherlock glared at him for a moment, like a child testing what they could get away with. Then, he visibly sagged in his seat with a petulant huff. John couldn’t help but smile. His new vampire was exactly the same as the human he once was; bratty, adorable, and brilliant. “Alright,” John said, holding the bag back up to Sherlock’s lips. “Finish it up.”
“Damn, you are one crafty little guy, Jim,” Harry said, handing Molly back off, making sure to not let go until Jim had her. It’s what John told them to do and no matter how hard any of them fought it, they were still Subs in mind and body. Most of the time, it’s said at least, that Doms don’t even have to emit their hormone to make them submit, it’s the command in there voice and the nature of the others to follow.
“Good.” Sherlock absentmindedly stroked a hand though John’s hair before he went over and picked up the bagel. He held it to John’s lips. The teen looked at him wearily for a moment, feeling the leather rub against his skin. Deciding he was more hungry than angry, John took a bite, which was washed down by a big swig of milk that Sherlock brought to his lips.
However, he wouldn’t allow his boy to hide anything from him, now that they were together. “No don’t hide, you’re adorable when you’re embarrassed,” he said, pulling the small hands away and cradling them in his larger one. Slowly working into the next part of their night, Sherlock reached up and cupped John’s cheek for the first time. The soft peach fuzz, the heated skin, and the sweet sigh that came from the boy’s throat all washed through the detective in a wave of bliss, calming even the most violent of storms in his mind.
Molly nodded her head somberly, thinking about how much she worried about John and her other friends who protected her all those years.
“I know it is, but that’s the best we can do,” another voice said, though John couldn’t place it. “If that Sub didn’t shoot you then they would’ve been more lenient, but seeing as you have a bullet hole in your arm I don’t see how they can ‘not’ put him down.”
“Oh, wow, you actually went to the college and picked them up for me? That’s…wow, thank you! Yeah, I could really use a coffee, too. “
Sherlock held John’s arm, pulling him a tad closer. John let himself be pulled to Sherlock, keeping his blue eyes fixed on those silver ones he used to fear but now loved. There was a hand on the back of his head now instead of his arm, pulling him even closer. John closed his eyes, letting himself relax as warm chapped lips touched his own.
“Good morning,” a deep voice rumbled from near his chest. When John looked down, he saw the man who had taken his virginity staring up at him with a wide sleepy smile. Sherlock had one lanky arm sprawled over John’s bare stomach, while the other was snug under the small back and his messy brown curls cascaded over his chest. It was comforting to know he hadn’t been abandoned after last night, ensuring him that the older man’s agenda was not to shag and flee with some kid he’d found on the internet.
Before the vampire left to defend his new nest, he padded over to kneel next to Sherlock’s sleeping form. “I’ll take care of everything, Sherlock. Don’t you worry. Just rest, okay?” With a soft, cold kiss to the younger vampire’s lips, John turned to leave.
“John,” Greg turned around to face him as well, “feel better. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
By the time he had put his pajamas on, making sure to choose one with pockets to put the capsule in, Sherlock was dragging his feet over to the bed. He looked exhausted, making John’s heart melt recalling how his husband is usually a ball of energy right before bed. “Come to bed, I’ll give you a nice back massage to help you fall asleep, how does that sound?”
“No, Sherlock, you were supposed to let Gregory handle it. He is trained for such things, after all. But honestly, do you really think John would stab some innocent girl?”
“I’m…I’m top,” he said, trying to flip over. Now that was not happening. John laughed at the naiveté of the man below him. He was a vampire and Sherlock was a human, there was only one way this could go down. Sherlock was Johns to take, not the other way around.
John get's bathed and collared.
“Yeah, well you can-“ John was about to start a fight, anything that would take his mind off the horrible thoughts of his friends being sold to sadistic Doms, when he was met with something unexpected; a knock at the door. Both men looked up at the source of the noise, John excited to have a new variable that he could work with and maybe make an ally to aid in his escape.
“Let me be perfectly clear, John, because you seem to have forgotten why and how you arrived in this position,” Mycroft started, pushing back from the table a bit. “You possess a trait, a defect some might call it, which both myself and Sherlock require to complete our testing. As such, we need you in tip top shape if our findings are to be accurate. This means you are to eat three meals a day, bathe once a day, and sleep between six and eight hours every night. You have no say in these matters and if you attempt to rebel, as it seems your deficiency insists upon you doing so, I can assure you, John, you will not like the outcome. Do I make myself clear?” Mycroft was standing now and John could almost feel the coldness radiating from the man as if he created a giant shadow void of any sun.
“Greg, I understand all too well what I’m doing,” John told him and slipped his hand free of Greg’s grip. “I have to protect Sherlock; be the barrier between him and others. I owe him at least that and plus…” John paused, afraid of admitting the darkness inside of him.
Mycroft punishes John for his cursing and disobedience.
“Let me go!” John hissed, struggling against the net as hard as he could.
“They did what?!” John’s eyes grew wide when the little girl in front of him said Greg had kissed Mycroft on the cheek. Molly giggled as she told him and broke off a piece of chocolate and handed it to John. “Molly,” he said, taking the block, “are you sure you saw them kissing?”
“Then, he called me and hung up but I was able to track him to the Itchen Bridge before he…before he did something very stupid.”
“Did he force you into the car?”
The dark woman blanched at the name and John knew instantly that he would not find any help here at this crime scene. He sighed in relief, his body relaxing of its own accord.
“N-not helping,” John laughed again, looking up at the grinning man who rested his forehead on the teens.
She mulled it over, her feet shifting slightly until finally she took a deep sigh and pulled her brother, who was a head shorter than her, into her arms, squeezing the air out of him in a brutal hug. “I love you.”
With one arm wrapped around John’s chest and the other pumping him in time to his own thrusts, Sherlock was speeding towards his completion. He wanted, no needed, John to finish first so he could feel that tight squeeze around him, sucking all the darkness from Sherlock and going into John.
“Right,” Greg nodded, happy for the confrontation to be over. “I want to make you and your other Subs an offer.”
“N-no sir, all these documents have been guaranteed to be authentic. They do all the data entry and inside work to ensure that John Franklin Thomas is a real boy,” the man tried to break the tension with his joke but his laugh came out like a pained sob.
“Why?” John interrupted, “why didn’t you say anything until now?”
Enjoy!
The sensation was so intense it almost hurt and my God did he need to come. “It’s just like when you get that burst of sensation when the feeling comes back to your arm, yeah. Except, the only difference is,” he kissed the tip, making John shout and tears start to form in his eyes from the intense stimulation, “the penis has almost 25,000 nerve endings, which will all light up when I take this off for you to come. How does that sound?”
I had a bit of trouble with this chapter, so I hope you guys like it.
“You’re not going to try and escape again, are you?”
“Who were you talking to?” the boy’s face was bright red. Sherlock could tell he’d been crying and exerting a tremendous amount of effort to move around the room.
“John Thomas, Mr. Holmes,” she told him.
“Was-was it, you know, nice?”
“Hey, it was just an accident. You were scared, that’s all, and it’s already happened so now all we can do is take care of the aftermath, yeah?”
“Did you just...” he asked, once again lost for words at the older man’s behavior.
The boy hesitated for a long moment. It was a lifeline, a real one, unlike the number Mycroft had given him, which John knew had the potential to make the situation worse. If he took it, John thought, there would be no going back. He would endanger Archie, Sherlock, and himself if that little piece of paper made its way into John’s pocket.
Within a split second, John’s finger pulled the trigger and Jim fell from the roof with a blood curdling scream.
.oOo.
“John, stop!” Jim shouted at him, but the boy could only sit in his chair and watch.
“Why did you blow up the conference center, Ms. Adler?” John asked. He couldn’t even fathom being so angry at people that he would consider blowing them up. Hatred just wasn’t in his soul.
“John, you need to understand that Jim isn’t the same person he was when he shot Mycroft. He has a second generation collar on now, so he can feel bliss, feel happiness.” Sherlock told him as he unclipped the lead and opened the door.
“Sher!” She said, confusing John as he hugged her tightly. To his surprise, when he held her to his chest, she smelled clean and her hands were warm instead of the usual dead cold appendages they all had during the winter.
He nodded his head, but still strained slightly to get to the offered leg. The dark hairs on the human’s leg were standing on end, waiting for the predator to strike.
Satisfied with the little bit of privacy, John dropped the towel and threw on the other clothes quickly. “Umm, ‘kay,” his voice sounded small, even for him.
“That ‘center,’ brother mine, is the largest Sub research facility in all of Europe. I fail to see how understanding and training perfect Subs is a waste of my time.”
Panicked, John looked around for a weapon and found a sharp looking scalpel on a tray. He picked it up and then looked at the nurse who shook her head as if reading his mind. “I’m sorry. I’m not going to hurt you, I promise,” John said before quickly wrapping an arm around her chest and holding the sharp instrument just under her ribs. The young woman squirmed a bit and started to cry, but stilled when the door opened.
Hey everyone, hope you enjoy the chapter!
As he examined the room, looking for small expensive items to pocket and an escape route, a loud knock at the door caused John to jump up out of the bed. In one swift move he grabbed a letter opener off the dresser and slid underneath the bed, waiting for whoever put him in this room while he was unconscious. He looked down, noticing he was in plaid purple and black sleep trousers and a black shirt, neither of them were his.
With fourteen bold printed words, John’s happy world crumbled in around him and this time, he didn’t know if even Sherlock could keep him from being crushed into a million pieces.
“I-I just don’t know what I’m feeling…no I don’t mean that I just-ugh, I’m sorry,” John tried to look away from him, but Sherlock refused to let go of his tight grasp on the small chin, forcing the boy to look at him. There was so much insecurity in those dark blue eyes, more so even than the pictures had portrayed. For a moment, the man became angry at any who would try and convince his John he was anything less than perfect…but then, a light bulb went off in his head and the scenario changed again.
John quickly grabbed the man’s mobile and shut the door. John ran around to the other side of the car, praying he was fast enough to get the one up on the other Sub. He jumped into the passenger’s seat and slid over to the driver’s. Thankfully, the car was still running, and by the time John closed and locked the doors, the older Sub had no idea what hit her.
That is why, again, there was no surprise when Anthea informed him of Sherlock bugging the Watson house, the phone calls the two made, and finally the detective convinced John to come visit him in London.
“It’s okay.” Both Doms looked up, their eyes matching in confusion and oddly enough, suspicion. “I’m guessing by the way you almost punched Magnussen that you didn’t know he was a fuc-“ John paused, realizing it wasn’t best to push his luck right now, “umm, a uhh, lunatic.”
Beware, cliffhangers lie ahead ;)
.oOo.
“Me too,” Jim’s smile returned.
Anyways, once I move, I should have more time to write because there won't be as many distractions :)
“I told him about you,” John said, struggling desperately to get his hands free. “And if you don’t have that boy out of here in ten minutes, I’m going to tell him everything you did!”
The knock came again, “I’m coming,” Sherlock shouted, wondering briefly what was going through his lover’s mind upstairs when he too heard the visitor at their door. He put the scones back on the counter, placing a syringe filled with the same concoction he’d used on John into his robe pocket and went to open the front door. Before he could reach for the knob though, his mobile buzzed in his trouser pocket. Quickly, he pulled it out to glance down at the screen to see if there was a problem. “Oh John,” he whispered to himself, as soon as he saw the boy’s number displayed as the incoming call.
“Yeah,” John smiled again, playing idly with the small dark hairs that led from Sherlock’s belly button down.
“Ah, DI Donovan,” Sherlock greeted and John could tell it was the fake sentiment he used when he hated someone. “This is John, he’s studying to be a Doctor. I thought it would be perfect for him to get some field experience.”
John knew it was useless to resist his body’s reactions to the man’s touches. Sherlock new how to play him better than his own violin, and oh did he love to play his John. “You feel so marvelous, John.” Bending over to press his lips right in the Doctor’s ear, Sherlock whispered, “I wonder what you feel like from the inside?”
Mycroft scanned the room using all his senses, readying his can of repellant, another one of Sherlock’s many inventions and contributions to the League. Sherlock was the most brilliant person Mycroft had ever met, but the boy was a junkie at heart. He was still his brother though, and Mycroft would do whatever he had to keep him safe.
Molly thought for a moment, then, “don’t ever, ever, EVER, talk back to John ‘cause he’ll kick you in the arse,” the little girl grinned when her response caused the three other kids to laugh widely.
Now, he needed to touch, “may I wash you?” he asked and was met with a small nod. Moving as slowly as his lust would let him, Sherlock poured some bath soap into his palm and began rubbing into the smooth tan skin. He placed his hand on the back of his John’s neck, ensure the boy wouldn’t try to pull away in this moment of first real contact. He moved the soap all over the young body, meandering down until he rested just at John’s pelvic bone. Dipping his hand a few inches lower, Sherlock began tickling and playing with the small hairs, teasing the boy in his grasp, until John dropped his head on the man’s chest in surrender.
‘WHO IS THE MISTRESS? WRITE IT DOWN WHEN YOU CAN.’
“What did I tell you about thinking so much, hmm?” Sherlock asked when they arrived at the bottom of the stairs. “There is nothing to worry about, John. All that is required of you is already right here,” the Dom brushed his hand over the small bump on the back of the teen’s neck. Without thinking, John swung around, ducking his head away from the contact and clenching his fists, which sent a wave of pain up his left arm.
“No,” he said, his voice sounding like a five year olds.
“I think so, yes.”
This chapter has explicit material at the end but I'm sure if you've made it this far you already know that John is underage and Sherlock is not.
“Six.”
“Hey, Mike,” was all he said and then the other boy turned around to face the front of the class. As the professor gave his lecture, he glanced at John every once and a while, a small smile and his brow pulled together in the most condescending look he’d received yet.
“Hey freak,” an annoyed voice yelled as Sherlock walked into a small building surrounded by yellow tape. Rolling his eyes but ignoring the jab, when normally he would comment about Donovan’s sexcapades the night before, he felt no need and walked past the officer, going to stand beside Lestrade.
“You are the epitome of mixed signals John,” Sherlock laughed along with the boy as he sat a large duffle bag on the floor next to the bed and placed a pill on the boy’s tongue. “Swallow, for me,” he whispered and offered the glass of milk, which John sipped gratefully, then continued his laughing fit.
When John gave a few mumbles, Sherlock shook his head, “you don’t need to know why, John. I am your Dom and I’m telling you to not let him take you under.”
When John closed the door however, Sherlock sat up, confused at what just happened. He had expected a huge blow up, then Mycroft’s men would take Archie away, then there would be the most amazing make up sex of all time. Instead though, John turned his back on him, taking away his light.
“What? Oh God no. Do you think me a novice?”
John cocked his head, but prepared himself for whatever was about to come through the door. He wasn’t quite prepared for a little toaster looking device rolling in on wheels that were taken off an RC Car. It must have had a camera on top, because it stopped for a moment, buzzed, then headed straight for John.
“Well,” John said, sitting down by the hunter, “I suppose I expected this to happen.”
Sherlock rested his cheek on the top of John’s head the entire ride home. It took thirty minutes, but every one of them was utter perfection as he inhaled the fresh sweet smell of John’s blonde hair over and over again. John’s breathing had slowed, meaning he had fallen asleep curled up close to Sherlock’s chest, which made the ride that much better. He ran his hand up and down John’s arm, possessively holding him close so that no one would even think about hurting his boy.
“Well he’s been acting very strange lately, not making my officers cry for one,” Greg spoke, taking another sip.
John flinched, but only nodded his head in affirmation. “I would suspect so, as it appears your body is attempting to reject the probes.”
John dropped his gaze and Sherlock could see more tears threaten to break free. “B-but who…who is gonna…my-my mum is-“ He tried to finish but Sherlock knew exactly where this line was going and cut the head off the snake before it even made it out of the bushes.
I was having a lot of trouble writing the suicide note, I don't know why I just was, so I looked up a few examples and it just broke my heart. I know this is probably not needed but I felt like I should add this anyway.
For what he gathered, Sherlock had captured John Watson and held him captive to preform experiments. Sadly, this did not surprise the League member. He knew knowledge came first with his wayward brother, and it turns out it would come to bite him in the arse. It appeared John had broken loose, or even worse, Sherlock let him lose, and the vampire attacked him.
Hello everyone! Thank you so much for all the continuous support for this story. This will be the last chapter in part two, one because I'm running out of song titles by Elton John, and two, things are going to be changing for John and it just seemed appropriate.
“Let go of me. Why won’t you let me go,” John begged. He could feel the tears welling up in his eyes when the car started moving, taking him away from Baker Street.
John woke up to someone shaking his shoulder gently. At first, he thought it was little Molly waking him up to say she had to go to the bathroom, because she knew she was never allowed to go alone. This hand though, was much larger than Molly’s, even his was smaller than the one now pushing at the side of his head. He hummed quietly, not wanting to get up yet from an abnormally comfortable spot, but the hand was insistent. So he opened his eyes to see two light gray trouser clad legs and the back of a leather seat. It was oddly a comfortable position until he realized his head was lying on Sherlock’s lap, while his feet where splayed out on someone else’s thighs.
“No you’re not,” someone said behind him. His instincts told him to drop the knife, but his fear and anger made his hand grip the metal tight.
“You were hiding under the covers when Sherlock shot him, John, he already told us what happened,” Greg said again, his voice harsher than before. John scrunched his nose up, shaking his head and trying desperately to figure out why Sherlock would have lied for him.
Sherlock kicked himself for starting this conversation over text, he should’ve waited until the boy left the house so they could talk about their meeting. He had underestimated John’s wanting to follow the rules and it might come back to bite him in the arse.
Sherlock thought as the cabbie made another turn. Yes, he needed to get home right now.
“I don’t know how to explain this to you for you to finally understand. Honestly I don’t even know if you are capable of understanding. I tried when you were with Victor but…”
“Is that so?” John scoffed at Sherlock underestimating his planning abilities. “You know, suppositories melt due to body heat, right?” He rolled the man below him over and started crawling up to face him, lust in both their eyes. “Normally, they take about twenty minutes to fully melt so the body can absorb them.”
“Ah John, you’re awake,” Sherlock said, sounding like a giddy little boy.
“You like that? How about this?” his thin fingers wrapped around his member, slowly pulling the foreskin back all the way, then pulling it back over the head again.
John nodded. He could smell himself and it wasn’t pleasant, so he headed towards the bedroom. “Sherlock, go help him, please.”
When they arrived outside, John spotted a young boy in the back of an ambulance with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Archibald, the officer had said, had dark brown hair, longer than Sherlock’s, but he was just as pale as the Detective, save for the bright pink in his cheeks caused by shed tears.
John glared into the icy blue eyes, not wanting to back down until he saw Mycroft’s other hand reach into his pocket.
“We’re not faulty!” John challenged and pulled up his pants. The boy wiped his eyes dry so he could glare up at Sherlock.
“Listen to me,” John halted, grabbing Jim’s shoulder only to have it shaken off. “Jim, listen to me, we are going to get her back, I promise. Now, I want you to stay outside so I can scout the place to make sure those two guys go help with the fire. If they’re not, then I’ll distract them inside the house so you can sneak past and get Molly the hell out of there.” John’s voice was stern but he didn’t dare try to order the Sub, who still looked suspicious.
“I killed Moriarty,” John said, voice clear as it echoed through the warehouse.
“Trust me, John, you will feel exceedingly better once we remove that little piece of hardware. It’s a very easy procedure and my people are more than capable.”
“John, you did do the right thing. You just don’t understand-“
“I know, Molly,” John leaned down a bit, taking off his worn wool hat and placing it on her head, earning a grin from the girl. “But we are going to find a nice house to stay in tonight, one with some soup that we can make later and maybe even some sweeties. Now, do you remember what Harry told you?”
“Shh, just try to relax John. Push out for me, that’s it,” he could feel the boy obey his command, making the slid in easier until he was finally fully seated once again in the delicate tight heat of his John. “You feel so good John,” Sherlock cooed in his ear, listening to the boy panting when he rocked back and forth rhythmically, letting his hips rest perfectly against the curve of the boy’s arse. They were perfect together, like a solid color puzzle with a million pieces that only Sherlock had the ability to complete. As their grunts became deeper, Sherlock lifted the boy’s leg higher to push in deeper. When John yelped and twitched he knew he had hit the boy’s prostate. “Are you ready to come, John?” Sherlock asked, slipping his other hand under the boy and replacing the small hand with his own to slowly stroke the whimpering boy.
“I will take care of Sherlock. I’m his sire now and whether you like it or I like it, he is my responsibility and I take that very seriously.” When both humans remained silent, John continued. “Give me three days with just the blood bags and then one, and only one, of you come to the cabin. I can’t protect both of you if things go sour.”
“You and Sherlock have been through quite an ordeal, and I imagine both of you are still ‘on edge,’ so to speak.”
“Hey,” John patted his arm, “it’s okay. I’m okay. I’m just so happy to see you.”
“No, an idiot can ‘kill’ a vampire. It takes a genius to actually catch one,” Sherlock beamed, prodding at the man’s chest, feeling the iron muscles that lay beneath the pale skin. What he wouldn’t give to peel back the layers and see exactly what made Dr. John Watson tick.
“No more than necessary, I assure you,” Mycroft told his brother. “I’m actually quite pleased with our security system. I’ve never seen it in action before, but it appears to have the desired effect on any overly rambunctious Sub trying to break in or escape. Though I see no reason for the latter, still, it is nice to know our facility is well protected even from the most willful of children.” The older man looked down at John, there wasn’t much emotion, but the teen had learned quickly that Mycroft Holmes did not threaten like normal people. He simply glared ominously until you either submitted or…well, John didn’t like to think about the other option too much.
“We cannot risk it, Sherlock. Go get the straps.”
When the forearm was only a finger length away, Sherlock threw his head forward, baring his teeth. The hand in his hair remained, but his sire didn’t stop him from attacking his prey. He felt uncomfortable not having his hands to keep Mycroft from moving away, his instincts telling him to latch on with every limb. Nevertheless, his teeth hit their mark. A loud yelp came from his brother; that and the sweet toffee flavored blood that coated his tongue were the only indication that Sherlock had impaled the arm.
“Is he on?” John’s voice brought him back from his deductions.
He knew the stretch would hurt, that was unavoidable for the first time, but he took care of his boy, slowly stroking the soft penis between his fingers, feeling a bit of life come back at his touch. “Shhh, relax John, you want this, you told me,” Sherlock cooed, giving John what the boy had imagined, as his entire cock sunk into that hole where nobody else had ever been and nobody except him would ever go.
“They didn’t hurt him, did they Jim?” Greg asked the boy who had a death grip on his suit jacket.
The slow up and down movement and the soft stroking over John’s chest began to bring him back to reality. Sherlock had grabbed him as he was floating off and kept him on the ground, safe and warm. However, once the teenager came back a little more, he remembered that part of the dream was real. Sherlock had drugged him and kidnapped him, telling him that he would be a new person. “S-Sherlock?”
“Her name!”
“You two can discuss what John did later,” Sherlock said, smiling down at the furious blonde. “Is Greg coming over to the flat?”
“I know,” John said, playing with the curls on Sherlock’s forehead. “That’s why Greg is coming today.”
“We’re here mate,” the cabby spoke, annoyed that he had to drive so far.
John was just so…John, was all the Detective could come up with when describing his boy to his older brother. It didn’t make any sense why someone so seemingly ordinary had the power to sate the darkness inside of Sherlock until nothing was left but the waves gently kissing the shore. Every day was like this: one kiss, then peace, one touch, then bliss, he fucks John, then ecstasy, John fucks him, then an ultimate burst of tranquility. Sherlock would be damned if he didn’t do everything in his power to keep John from leaving, even if the boy still fought with all his might to not want Sherlock. It was a losing battle, he knew, but John still wouldn’t completely give in to his desires. It was frustrating, and Sherlock had never been a patient man but luckily his John was teaching him even in his stubbornness.
The entire east wing has crumbled down, making the house sag in a way that looked all too dangerous.
“I-I don’t understand,” John said. He was relieved that Sherlock was alright and that the pain in his shoulder was not in vain.
Sherlock's POV during John walking in on him and Archie.
So I'm guessing four or five more chapters after this one, don't quote me on that but this part of the story is definitely coming to a close. Although there are still going to be quite a few more twists and turns, which is always good I think.
“Okay, thanks mum, love ya!” With that, the boy kissed his mom on the cheek and ran upstairs more confident than ever. He jumped on his bed and started texting Sherlock.
“It will be for the best. I don’t want to shock him in front of all those people,” Mycroft told him.
“Goodnight, John,” Jim said, reaching his arm across the older boy’s chest in a makeshift hug.
“Not at all,” Sherlock answered, though he remained seated, staring at John with those strange silver eyes.
In a flash, Sherlock was out the door and hailing a cab to take him to John. He watched the little green dot on his phone constantly, hoping somehow he could channel his energy to John to let him know everything was going to be okay. He had to focus on John, because thoughts of the horrible things he was about to do would consume him if he didn’t.
That’s when an idea popped into his head. He didn’t have to deal with pain, not any more. He had always thought being a Sub was a curse, but slowly, his mind was changing.
Sherlock trotted downstairs, as gleeful as a child on Christmas.
“Is…” Greg swallowed, squeezing his eyes together from shock and perhaps a little bit of pain, “he okay?”
John slowly got to his feet, forcing back a yelp as the skin on his neck was pulled taught, straining the wound created from the collar. “Your neck should heal in a couple of days,” Mycroft told him. It was awkward, really awkward, as John stood by the bed, naked for all the man to see; however, he was relieved that the Dom seemed more interested in looking at his neck than his exposed arse. “I laced the insert with an antiseptic so we shouldn’t have to worry about infection, though Sherlock or I will be inspecting the site regularly.”
So this is it, the last chapter for the Strange Desire series. I'm quite sad to see it end, but I think it's best to stop while it's still good and not ruin it like the Saw movies. Anyways, I want to thank everyone for the continuous support and I really appreciate all the kind comments and kudos you've left for the story.
Chapter 1 - Lonely Boy
“Drop it,” Mycroft said slowly, patting John’s knee. “Everything will be fine once we get home and you get settled in. We won’t start sorting out what happened until you are ready, I promise.”
“Alright!” John shouted, leaning back when Mycroft loomed over him. He couldn’t, there was no way John would be able to live with himself for being responsible for putting a six year old girl in the grasps of some masochist Dom. No, he would endure, or at least endure until he made contact with Harry or Jim who might have a chance of finding Molly and freeing her.
“Okay, now what?” He felt a little funny and exposed sitting half naked on his bed with his mother preparing herself for sleep a few rooms over.
It wasn't until lunch when John discreetly checked his phone, almost bouncing in excitement when he saw there were four unread texts.
“And you couldn’t wait until tomorrow when you’re released?” Greg questioned, crossing his arms over his chest.
It felt good, the pain was fading and the warmth Sherlock provided on his back made John feel secure inside his little cage, his keys clutched tightly in one hand while the other gripped onto his lover’s shirt for dear life. It felt good to be owned, to be taken care of when broken and John hated himself for it, for being a weak, for feeling thankful that someone burnt their initials into him like cattle. “You just go back to sleep, love, and I’ll put a bandage on this so you don’t hurt yourself.” He could hear the genuine smile in Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock put a hand on both his wrists and lifted them slowly into the air, letting them stop just above his head. “Don’t move,” Sherlock instructed, his voice like honey to John’s ears and…
In a flash, John broke through his wrist restraints and grabbed ahold of Mycroft’s lapels. The vampire hissed, and for a moment, Mycroft thought John would latch on to his neck. Instead, John let go, looking shocked at his own actions.
When he was back on two legs, John backed away from the taller man, running into the same wall he had hid behind when Mycroft caught him. “This,” Sherlock held up a strange rounded barrel shaped key, “is the key to the arm harness and muzzle.” For some reason, hearing the words out loud made the devices feel that much heavier, causing John to whimper slightly and hang his head in defeat. He didn’t want this, he didn’t want this and it wasn’t fair! “Now, now,” Sherlock offered a comforting hand, running it smoothly through John’s hair, “this is only for today…if you behave, of course.”
Mycroft stood at the bottom of the stairs with Greg and two other expertly trained hunters. The stench of sex and vampire wafted through the flat, relaying exactly what had happened to his baby brother. Greg had already told him much, though Mycroft would be sure to reprimand the hunter for withholding the information for an entire week.
“There now, that wasn’t so bad, was it?” Sherlock asked, wrapping the loop at the end around his wrist. He opened his door and got out, pulling slightly on the lead for John to follow. It tugged on his collar, sending a jolt of pain through the back of his neck. It was a welcome feeling though, pain, as it helped him clear his mind nowadays.
The swells were rising. Two more went down as their heads were bashed into the brick wall of the alley they were stalking down.
“Good night,” John sighed, scooting deeper into his sleeping bag, letting the warmth protect him. It took another hour and a half for the teen to finally fall asleep, every breaking branch or car passing by made John opened his eyes, preparing himself to fight off any intruders. Finally, he closed his eyes and let a light sleep take him until dawn.
Running on fear and stubbornness alone, John was able to scoot his body forward enough to fall on to his knees. A shot of pain ran through his neck, causing the teenager’s core muscles to give out and flop down face first onto the rug covering the hard wood floor. The pain, like needles starting from his spine and making their way up to his brain continued until he finally stopped squirming. W
“Of course, will you be alright John?” When John nodded and waved a good bye to the elder Holmes, Sherlock removed himself from the room, following Mycroft to the front door.
“He told me he was twenty-two after I made my football team,”
“It’s the easiest way, John, easiest for her and you to move on with your new lives,” Sherlock wiped away a few tears, which John knew should have made him angry because the man was the cause of the tears.
“No, no, you’re alright, leave those on, John,” a hand rubbed over his clothed back and it wasn’t Sherlock’s, it wasn’t Sherlock’s and he was alone, he’d killed somebody and he was alone.
“You…You…” John said, his face scrunching up in anger. He pulled away from Sherlock’s hand, thankful that the man sat in the middle so John could scoot back into the arm rest. “You’re just afraid we won’t need you anymore!” John shouted, actually pushing the Dom in the chest, hard.
“Holmes? Holy shit. As in, Mycroft Holmes, founder of the league?” John began struggling anew, yanking at the chains with nothing but brute force.
“Very well,” Mycroft nodded, just as they pulled up to a rather large stone built cottage. John was expecting some wooden cabin that barely had running water. But this, this was just amazing. “The League will know nothing of this. They will simply think Sherlock ran off to live a life on his own.”
“S-Stop,” John said, keeping his voice stern and hoping Sherlock didn’t hear the slight quiver. “I won’t…don’t make me-“
“I don’t think he will give us anything to go off of...do you?” He asked tentatively, his voice laced with fear and anticipation. Even though John was five years older, it was still so easy to anticipate exactly how he would act. Not that it was boring, no, John could never be boring, but the fact that Sherlock could hold living putty in his hands gave an unexpected rush to his already aching member. It took a minute of steady breathing to not immediately come in his pants.
“Mr. Holmes,” Devon said through the door, “Gregory Lestrade is here to see John.”
“Hey!” John cried out, both his pride and stomach hurting from the swiftness of the man’s actions. Hitting and kicking didn’t seem to work either, even when John hit the man in the spine with his fist. “Let me go, you stupid ogre!” John yelled as they walked down the hall.
“I’m sorry, please don’t be mad me. I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he bit his lip, new tears welling up in his eyes.
Sherlock took a few more sips of the blood, then easily handed it over to John. “I get to drink from him?”
“John!” Molly greeted him with a big hug that almost knocked the teenager over.
“Good boy, now sit up on the bed for me and take your shirt off,” John’s muscles tensed but quickly relaxed. To distract the man, John faked a cough, hoping the Doctor would chalk up any strange movements to dehydration or sore limbs from the bonds. Thankfully, the Dom gently pinched the skin on John’s arm to check for just that, which of course came back negative. “It will pass. Up,” Dr. Magnussen instructed, only putting a bit of force into his words, accompanied by nothing more than a spritz of hormones.
There was a long pause before he finally heard another text come.
“Take him to sector C, I want to talk to him once we get Sherlock stabilized.” Mycroft pointed to the two other men, who rushed to sedate John.
He could try to escape again, sure, but where would that put him?
When he double clicked in the URL address bar at the top of the screen, a list of frequently visited sites popped up, the chat room where they first met showing at the very bottom of the list.
He heard a sharp groan of lust from the boy and rewarded him by stroking over his cock. “Shhhh, this is what you want. I know it is,” Sherlock cooed, rutting against the boy’s spine, spikes of electricity shot through him while he rubbed John’s back, slowly working his way down to the ultimate goal. Still rolling the tight sac in his hand, Sherlock brought his hand down to the beautiful smooth arse, kneading the flesh slightly.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just…let’s go back to sleep.” John lay back down, but didn’t close his eyes. The image of Sherlock’s waxy face and Jim’s screams threatened to take over if he even thought about closing his eyes.
While John was distracted by Sherlock’s scent, Sherlock had pressed his thumb just behind his ear and jaw bone. “Ah, so pressure points do work on you, interesting,” Sherlock said, removing his finger.
He sighed when he saw the contents, his shoulders dropping and losing their tension. Sex toys, Jim had left him different varieties of sex toys for him and John to play with. Sherlock, smiled thinking about all the things they would do together for the rest of their lives, how much fun they would have being all each other needed. The detective had learned from his mistakes that much he was sure of and he was also sure that John was different than Victor, different than all of them. John was special, John was perfect and John was his and he’d never felt this way in his entire life. That boy was his perfect hit and Sherlock knew he would never get bored.
“Alright John,” Greg came up to him, holding out a small devise that looked like an ink pen. “This is a tracker. All you have to do is hit the button, and it will send your location straight to us.”
Something felt a bit off, but Sherlock couldn’t quite place it. In the end he chocked it up to stupid John who had to go get himself caught, removing Sherlock’s one and only steady rock.
“Bye, John,” she said with a smile, then returned her hand to hold Greg’s.
Soon enough, he was completely worn out, breathing heavily through his nose as a few stray tears ran down the side of his face and into the leather straps around his head. The worst part was that he couldn’t even wipe them away. All John could do was lay there until Sherlock took pity on him and helped him stand.
Sherlock closed his laptop and gathered sample vials for blood and other bodily fluids, a rubber hose, tweezers, a few syringes, a scalpel, and some towels just in case things got a little messy. If John didn’t bite him after what Sherlock was about to do to him, he didn’t know what would. It was okay though, he could outlast a vampire, just like he always did. John Watson might be special, but he’s still a vampire; and when the beast takes over from hunger, Sherlock will be there to document every minute of it.
Sherlock texted as he strode up to 221B, plopping down in front of his laptop. John didn’t answer right away, so the detective pulled up the GPS to make sure everything was alright. The green dot that was his John’s mobile was still at the field. As time passed on and he still hadn’t heard from the boy, Sherlock became more and more agitated. He had nothing to do, nothing to stop the thoughts and ideas bouncing around in his head and it was eating him up from the inside. “Oh of course,” he finally said and pulled up a program called Photoshop on his computer.
“Ah, Sherlock, glad you’re here,” a man wearing a suit said, motioning them over. “It’s happened again; same method, same profile, same everything. Two parents killed and one child left alive, a boy this time, Archibald Clemmons age ten, but still the same history as the others.”
“Huh, that’s not what people normally say,” Sherlock stood up, placing his hands on his hips.
“John, your ice cream is melting!” A high panicked voice said to him. John’s eyes flew open to see Mycroft staring down the bed at him with a soft smile on his face. He tried to pull back quickly, but his limbs refused to hurry from their hypnotic like state.
“I had never been interested in sex before, my work was my life and I felt no need until I met Victor.” Sherlock added a tone to his voice similar to when he mentioned the morons like Anderson or the idiotic people on the crap telly they watched together, so John’s subconscious would register the boy behind the name meant nothing to the detective. When it came down to it, it was true, at least compared to John those people meant nothing to him, just silly ghosts wondering around.
“Yeah, I’m fine, I just wanted to tell you, umm…thanks,” John said, looking down and picking at the thread of his blanket.
“Are you okay?” John asked, ignoring Sherlock’s presence completely. “Did they hurt you? Did they touch you?”
“Do you remember when we first talked and I said I had a boyfriend that I broke up with?” He took a small step forward, pleased when John didn’t seem to notice. “That was Victor, he was my first and I loved him with all my heart but…but he didn’t love me back and left me for someone else.” It wasn’t really a lie, Sherlock rationalized, he did love Victor but now, looking at his feelings for John, Victor was nothing to him. John would never run away, he would never leave him and as if to confirm his belief, the boy lowered the gun slightly again, pointing it at Sherlock’s feet.
Sherlock focused, readying himself for what was to come.
Chapter 6 – Act Nice and Gentle
John clenched his teeth together, his body stiffening in Sherlock’s lap. John always thought of himself as a good man, a man who did the right thing. But the question was now, what was the right thing. He owed a life debt to Mycroft, but he also promised the Sub Resistance that he would help them. Finally, he took a deep breath and looked at the woman square in the eye.
“Still using the negative reinforcement on him? Oh, poor dear, I’ll make sure to have the exam room ready. “Will you be needing restraints?”
“No don’t hide, you’re adorable when you’re embarrassed,” Sherlock laughed, pulling John’s hands away from his face and holding them gently in one big hand. He saw the man’s other hand come up to his cheeks and as soon as the warm hand made contact, John let out a sigh from deep in his throat. A smile came across his face, amazed at how gentle such large hands could be.
Hello again everyone! Thanks so much for the comments and kudos. I'm really glad you guys are enjoying the story(:
“I’m fine, just-”
God did he taste delicious. Sherlock relished the sweet salty and irony flavor that filled his mouth. John was his and now, after five years of resisting, Sherlock knew the boy was finally letting go and accepting his fate. That thought alone made the Detective rock his hips a few times, stimulating both their lengthening members. “I love you, John,” Sherlock said, lifting his knees to free John’s hands. As predicted, the boy’s hands stayed still and let Sherlock do what he thought best…and what he thought best was to get John naked as quickly as possible.
“All in good time,” he chuckled watching John thrust his hips for attention, “how about you wash me off before we run out of hot water, yeah?” The situation he had moved John into would never allow for anything other than an affirmative answer, but he waited patiently until the boy gathered his courage and poured some soap in his hand. He saw hesitation sparkle through those dark blue eyes and decided to give the little bird a kick out his nest, grabbing the small wrist and placing it on his chest.
up to the boy, who was now half way between sitting and standing. “And if you try to harm my guest,” Mycroft placed a hand under John’s armpit and grabbed one half of the bar of soap in the other, “we shall test the battery life in that collar of yours.” The soap was presented again, followed by a threatening smile. The knock came again, making John jump and unconsciously open his mouth to have the smaller piece stuck in, which thankfully only reached midway to the back of his tongue. “Go,” the Dom said, rubbing a possessive hand through John’s blonde hair.

Hey guys,
It felt like his skin was being pierced by a billion scorching needles. As soon as he screamed for Mycroft to stop, the man relented in his assault. There was a hint of frustration and sorrow on the Dom’s face, but he continued to stare at John, waiting for him to go upstairs.
“It’s Moriarty, Mr. Holmes…”
“What did happen, Johnny?” Harry asked, lying down on the sleeping bag she’d stolen six months ago. It was bright red and John had told her it was too noticeable but when she wrapped it around herself with a huge grin, there was no way he could say no. “You looked right terrified when you showed up.”
“Sherlock, you need to let him go,” John said, taking a step closer to the feeding vampire. Sherlock merely stretched out a pleading hand for John to join him, but he kept his teeth in the human and his eyes on Mycroft. “No, Sherlock,” John said a little firmer, “you need to let go.”
“Please, just listen to me okay,” Mycroft said, not wanting to hear those words out of a fourteen year olds mouth again. “Look at it this way; let’s say you had to do one hundred pushups every morning for one year, yes. It would be hard at the beginning but then you would become really strong and by the end of that year you could do the hundred easily, right?” John nodded but Mycroft could tell the boy didn’t know what pushups had to do with him and Sherlock. “But what if someone else came along and said you only had to do ten and they would do the other ninety for you. Then, it would be really easy but by the end of the year you wouldn’t be as strong.” He finished his little story, proud at how he was able to think abstractly enough to explain a complicated matter in such terms.
There was fire and smoke rising above the rest of the houses. “Oh no,” was all the Sub could say, his face turning pale and his hands gripping the wheel. He sped up until he arrived outside, then put the car in park and jumped out at a flat sprint.
“This is not a conversation to be had while you both are still healing,” Mycroft said, lifting John’s feet off his lap and onto the floor. Sherlock let go of him finally, so John was able to sit up.
John nodded, happy to have a place to call home.
“That doesn’t matter. He is an adult and you are still a minor. It was his responsibility and he took advantage of you,” Greg explained, reaching out his hand to grab the boy’s shaking one. “Did you ever tell him to stop?”
“Greg, I think it’s best you and Molly head home.” Mycroft scooted himself up on the inclined bed a bit more.
“F-For me?” Molly asked. She had no idea what she’d done, but whatever it was she would make plans to do it again.
After a moment’s pause, he put the plates and glass down on the coffee table and unzipped the bag preparing for the worst.
John lazily tried to pull at the buttons, succeeding in only stretching the material. So, Sherlock lightly grabbed the hand and planted a soft kiss to John’s fingers, and then set it down on the bed. “Sherlock,” John said, and Sherlock swore he saw a hint of a smile on his face.
Even growing up with Sherlock, Mycroft knew he was the obsessive type, needing and wanting everything either in his mind palace or toy chest. It was harmless, the nanny had told their mother when Sherlock had grabbed his stuffed bear and shoved it in his satchel to take to school. It would have been ‘harmless’ if the young Holmes hadn’t punched three kids in the stomach when they tried to pet the bear. They though it was cute, even the teachers said he would make someone very happy one day, showering them with all the love they could ever imagine. Mycroft knew, though, knew his little brother was not ordinary enough to have a simple obsession, like collecting snow globes or standing in line when the newest film came out. No, when he looked at that little boy with a curly mop of dark hair gripping the teddy bear by the throat and petting its head possessively, Mycroft knew Sherlock Holmes would never be satisfied just to love, he had to possess.
“Rest assured, Greg, John is far too valuable of an asset to let anything happen to. You on the other hand,” Mycroft paused, which made Greg’s stomach drop. “You are a man with nothing to lose and without a cause,” he narrowed his eyes, as if debating something. “Heed my warning, Gregory, and do not test my patience either, for the consequences will be far more than you are willing to pay.”
“Yes, John, yes, I’ve handpicked the families myself,” Greg assured him, and John had no choice but to believe him. “We just want to help them.”
Hey everyone, sorry for only posting one chapter a week, but to make it up to you here is a long-ish chapter and some good old smut.
“A’right mate, we’re ‘ere,” the cabbie said, turning around and quirking an eye brow at the two men.
“No, I just-“ John’s breathing became more labored and Sherlock knew what was coming next, he needed to work fast.
“How long has it been?” John asked. Amazed at how quick the news heard about what happened.
Although that sweet little sound should have made John smile, the words that followed, made his heart stop instead.
“As I recall, you came here of your own free will. Plus, we’re in love, it’s not me who’s keeping you here, John, it’s your feelings for me. I know your scared of these new emotions, I am too, but we’ll get through this together.” Sherlock’s word clouded his mind. It seemed as soon as the waters cleared enough for John to have a clear thought, the older man jumped into the lake and stirred up the mud again.
“Will you let me see Sherlock?”
It only took ten minutes for Sherlock to come out of the bathroom, but John had his eyes closed and was now lying flat on his back. “John?” Sherlock asked, but the Sub was already fast asleep.
“What’s wrong about it?” John asked, his voice growing just as loud and just as angry as Sherlock’s. He would be damned if Sherlock was going to tell him some bullshit about Doms are the only ones who should be able to give Subs their bliss.
“Go ahead.”
“Sherlock!” John shouted, trying to swing, but as soon as he did, the rope tied around his cock tucked, trying to squeeze his manhood right off. “Oh God,” John let his head fall too see his cock dangling below him, bound for all to see.
With the grace of a feline, John stalked over to Sherlock, grabbing his pajama trousers and yanking them off. Sherlock gasped and shimmied farther up the bed, away from John. Although the man was only trying to get into better position, John saw his meal getting away and jumped on the bed, straddling Sherlock’s hips and pressing his shoulders down. He snarled and ripped Sherlock’s shirt over his head, then pressed his forehead to where he could see all the red glowing veins meet. John licked the skin over Sherlock’s heart, moving down to his nipple and nibbling on it lightly.
he easily found John Watson and Mary Morstan’s location on his laptop. Mary had two sisters, mother deceased, but father living in Whales,
“Indeed. There are more pressing matters that need attending to, however I do not wish to burden you with them yet, especially after your confession of producing your own bliss. I foresee many interviews, but I will make sure your first is with Greg.”
“Nothing, it wasn’t a big deal. I mean, we were already friends, who cares about age when you love each other?” John asked, defensive.
Sorry there's no smutty goodness in this chapter, but I promise there will be at least one scene near the end, which should be in three or four more chapters.
“Thank you, Sir,” John said and used the phone in the office to call Mycroft.
Thanks to Ebrill for suggesting Archie be thrown into this mess. I hope you're happy with yourself. LoL!
“John dear, there was a package left at the door for you, it’s a bit late for the mail isn’t it?” Mrs. Hudson said, handing John a medium sized brown box, which only had his name written on it with black sharpie.
“Talk to you tomorrow John, I love you.”
With those words and that beautiful mouth back on him, John could practically feel his come revving its engine in he bullocks to explode at any minute. Then, the mouth was gone again and something tight was pulled over the base of his cock. Pulled out of his blissful moment, the boy startled and looked down at Sherlock who was adjusting and inspecting the red ring, which was now tight around his flushed member. “Wh-What are you doing? Please, Sherlock, I need…I-“
One day later
“Oh God, Sherlock, I’m…I’m so sorry,” John said, covering his mouth in shock at how hard he had rutted against Sherlock’s hips.
Chapter 3 – What the Water Gave Me
“What is it, Anthea?” he asked while typing his response.
Downstairs at his computer, Sherlock created spreadsheet after spreadsheet on all the experiments he would perform on John. As he sat and stared at the screen though, his fingers itched to text someone and tell them of his new pet, but he knew the time wasn’t right. He’d only conducted one test, and just as Sherlock hypothesized, John didn’t drink from him even though there was ample chance.
“You just need to relax John, if you don’t of course it’s going to hurt. Just breathe for me, yeah, that’s it,” Sherlock practically growled in his ear, thrusting faster into his leg. John’s feet were scrambling for purchase on the wet floor, when suddenly the two burning fingers hit something that made him yelp and his cock twitch back to life. “There you are!” Sherlock laughed, thrust his fingers again to hit the boy’s prostate.
The boy rubbed a shaky hand over his face, trying desperately to get the room to stop spinning. “John?” Sherlock’s voice grabbed a hold of him while hands on his shoulders offered a pleasant weight to keep him from spinning out of control. “You’re alright, love, just breathe for me. That’s it, you’re just having a bit of a panic but I’m here, I won’t let go of you.”
The little girl, dressed in a purple nightgown, was sitting on the same couch the man was sitting on the night before. Her legs tucked up under her as she watched some cartoon on the telly and munched happily on an apple.
“Are-Are you sure?” the man asked, actual fear in his voice, but he took a step closer to the straining vampire.
“But you said-“ Harry started.
“No, you cannot,” Greg called from the kitchen counter.
Also, I make a few Chess references in the chapter, so for anyone who doesn't play or know the terminology, this is a tiny explanation of the words you will see. King, Knight, and Rook are all chess pieces. If the King has no legal moves to escape capture, it is called 'Check Mate' and the game is over. 'Check' is when the King is cornered and has only a few legal moves to escape to avoid getting captured. Anyways, that's all you really need to know for what I've put in the chapter(:
“Who’s there?” a voice John knew well asked.
Also, this chapter has descriptions of hangings and a crime scene in it, but nothing too gory. Anyways, enough chatting. I hope you enjoy the chapter(:
John slept through the whole procedure, which Sherlock was sure it was due to how gentle he was with the boy’s injuries. After an hour and a half, he had enveloped both the teen’s left forearm, from his knuckles to just above his elbow, and from his right foot all the way up to under his knee cap with cloth, extra padding, and wetted plaster to immobilize the two appendages. He took a wet flannel and wiped off the white residue from John’s small fingers and toes protruding from the hardening white cast.
“Hey,” John squealed but lay lax in the man’s arms, relishing in the warmth and smooth skin. “I can walk you know.”
“Sherlock…” John gasped. Sherlock could tell a knot was forming in the boy’s throat as he began to plead. “Don’t. Please…don’t. Just…you can just come back to Baker Street with me…please, Sherlock.”
John's POV. John and Sherlock get settled into a far away cottage and the training begins.
So sorry for not updating last week. Just got a new dog and that little guy takes up a lot of time.
When his eyes opened again, Sherlock could see everything and then some. As he breathed in, a smell so delicious it made his mouth begin to water hit his nose. He sighed loudly, examining the room to find a nurse facing away from him as she filled out paper work. There were red glowing lines running all throughout her body, indicating where Sherlock was supposed to bite for the maximum amount of blood.
John didn’t even remember getting into the car. Sherlock had hugged him, kissed him on the forehead, and then someone had put him into the back seat of a very black, and very ‘Mycroft’ type car. The entire crime scene was a blur as well, though the picture of those two parents hanging from a rope had already burned its way into John’s mind for good. He remembered seeing the little boy too, Archie Sherlock had called him, sitting in the back of an ambulance. He knew he didn’t even know the kid, but there was something eating away at John, like a starving parasite gnawing at his living flesh.
“Well nothing really, unless things turn south. Sherlock will still help the Yard with its cases and everything will be normal, save for my brother’s more appropriate behavior, which I’m sure you will appreciate.”
“What are you talking about? It’s not like you’re going out driving or walking out in public for the rest of the night. Drinking’s not a big deal, John, you and I drinking one is going to have the same effect on both of us, age has nothing to do with it.”
Mycroft ran his hand over his face, frustration increasing and patience waning while Sherlock looked like it was Christmas. “This is why we put down Subs with a defective receptor,” the oldest Dom said, more to himself than the other two in the room.
Taking full advantage of the invitation he was given, the older man moved his tongue in to taste the exquisite delicacy that was his John. Once in, he didn’t even have to fight for dominance
“Pleasure him?” Mycroft asked, confused, though John was sure the man knew exactly what he meant.
“I love you, John. Just one more day and you will have me and I you.” The detective’s body was shaking as he came down from his orgasm. He noted the amount of semen he had been producing during his time spent with John was significantly larger than normal, which indicated his arousal for his boy had increased now that he was his.
The car finally came to a stop, and Sherlock was the first to get out. It felt stuffy inside the car, like he couldn’t breathe.
Lights flashed and people shouted at him, making John want to stay down where Sherlock had taken him even more. “Good boy,” Sherlock whispered in his ear. That was the last piece of the puzzle for John to completely ignore the strange writing in his eyes. ‘FIGHT IT, JOHN.’ But John didn’t want to fight it, he wanted to stay in Sherlock’s arms forever.
Please enjoy(:
John thought it strange that the normally impatient man before him was offering to wait to ask questions. Deciding he wanted to get the questions about Jim over with, John closed his eyes and swallowed deeply, wincing at his raw throat. “Go ‘head.”
“No, no, goodness no, it is perfectly fine that you are a virgin. You should wait until you really have feelings for someone. You are too special to give yourself away that easily, John, do you understand me?”
“John! I won’t tell you again,” Sherlock smacked him on the thigh again, bringing a comical image to John’s mind of Sherlock riding a horse and whipping it to go faster.
“Wha-what’s ha-hap-happening to-“John started to panic when his vision showed three out of focus Sherlocks coming closer to him but his legs felt like he’d just run thirty miles and were ready to collapse. He hadn’t even realized he dropped the plate.
had something to do with him being immobilized. As soon as John had been woken up from the horrid dream, Sherlock noticed the boy’s eyes darted straight to his arms and then he tried to reach out to his legs to make sure they were real.
Magnussen is a complete asshole. John is in trouble. Sherlock is in trouble, but for different reasons. Mycroft does have a heart...sort of.
Suddenly, he shot up and paced the floor over and over again, rubbing his hands through his hair that his mother had made him cut. John looked at himself walking by the mirror. He was paler than he expected, his eyes where more of a moldy blue rather than an ocean blue like Sherlock had said. Dark circles rested below them and then the bags turned to cracks, which started spreading along his face. John watched as his entire face tuned into a horror puzzle of shards and crevasses. They worst part was though, John knew, was that he didn’t know how to hold the pieces together anymore. If they fell and Sherlock didn’t catch them and put them back with a small kiss to each…then no one would. He was alone. “Why, why, why, whywhywhywhywhy! Please, WHY!” Then there was pain, sharp pain in his hand accompanied by a loud crash.
Chapter 13 – Between Two Lungs
“And you’re blaming me for this?!” Sherlock was fuming now. The knowledge that his boy almost killed himself because he couldn’t be with his lover and the fact that now Mycroft was blaming him even though the bastard was the one who made him leave the country. No, this was not turning out well at all. “You are the one who is keeping me from him, Mycroft, or do you seriously think I’m here by choice?”
“We’re coming up. This is your last chance,” Mycroft said, motioning for his men to follow. As they slowly walked up the stairs, Greg prepared his net gun, while the others had their crossbows ready to fire on Mycroft’s signal. Mycroft could hear a slight growling coming from inside the room. He turned the door knob and opened the door to find Sherlock passed out on the bed, naked with drying blood all over him.
“Is it because you don’t trust me? You think I’ll go with him and leave,” the boy asked, looking down at his feet and playing with the hem of the comforter. For a moment, Sherlock became angry at John for manipulating him, using his own heart and feelings for the boy against him.
“Sherlock, stop, what are you doing?!” John shouted, his throat clogging up and unavoidable tears leaking from the corners of his eyes.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, examining every micro-expression. “Liar,” he said, narrowing his eyes.
“Well,” Sherlock said, sliding off his trousers and pulling on a new pair of dress ones. “You are right about one thing, John.”
“Welcome back, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, tipping his head slightly as he stepped into the car.
“I know, but Sherlock will make it all better. I promise,” he promised with all his heart and mind, finishing cleaning the boy to his satisfaction, never rubbing too hard over the oversensitive areas. “All done, let’s get you dried off, yeah?” John held onto him like a lifeline as they dried off and Sherlock held him just as tight, never letting go of the pieces he had broken the boy into.
Hey everyone,
“I know,” Sherlock said, almost condescendingly. “We will go public and start a relief effort for all Subs and Doms who own Subs with RDD. You have to realize, John, everything I did was for the best.”
“Sherlock…” Mycroft said hesitantly, taking a step closer to his brother.
“What are you talking about? I don’t need you! I hate you!” John tried to convince himself.
“I’ll keep them off your back as long as I can, then,” Greg said, looking at Sherlock with pity in his eyes. “I swear I didn’t think something like this was going to happen. He had him restrained with those chains you gave him and I would never imagine he would let John loose. I’m…I’m so sorry, Mycroft.”
John nodded, “No, no, I’m fine. Just got a bit light headed there for a second. Let’s go,” John said, motioning towards the end of the hallway where there was a congregation of officers. There was slight chatter and the sound of clicking from the camera used by the forensics team, but John’s attention was focused on the man and woman hanging from the ceiling via an intricate pulley system.
Chapter 11 – Isolated System
John stood in the bathroom staring into the mirror, praying that it was one of those trick props used in the circuses. His hand was splayed over his belly while the other slowly pulled the white gauze that was hiding what Sherlock had done to him. It ached and almost sizzled when the air hit the ‘SH’ just above his pelvic bone. “Fuck,” he whispered, cringing and looking up at the ceiling. He knew it was going to be intense living with Sherlock, but this…this was too much. The man was deteriorating right before his eyes; becoming more possessive, more lost in his own world as if the only thing he needed was John. Honestly, it sounded narcissistic, but John wondered if Sherlock forgot to breathe sometimes when his nose wasn’t inhaling the scent of his blonde hair, or anywhere else on his body for that matter.
“There has to be some way to help these Subs,” John asked, his eyes pleading.
“John! Get off me, I said I don’t need the medicine; I don’t want it in my ears! ” Sherlock began thrashing, pushing the hand away from his face and clawing at John’s.
‘Take your clothes off so you can feel me touching you.’
“Sherlock,” Mycroft whispered, fear and pain clear in his voice.
I hope you enjoy the chapter!
John would be forever ashamed that he couldn’t squirm out of a one arm hold by a 30 something businessman. “No!” John tried one last time, but Sherlock only grabbed his head to hold him still, then clipped the lead to his collar.
“Well it wouldn’t be the first time something like that happened.” Greg shoved past Sherlock, examining the area. His head shot up to the second floor when he heard a loud clang, like something had dropped to the floor and continued to roll around. “Who’s up there?” Greg asked, turning around to face Sherlock with a cheeky grin on his face. “A girl? Oh no, that’s right, Mycroft said you were into boys.” The man wagged an eyebrow, showing he approved.
