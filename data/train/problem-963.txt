Sherlock sighs again. “You’ve made that pretty clear already, yes”.
“Have you eaten at all today?”
"I was getting married," John explains, "but you were back, and with you all the feelings I had tried to forget. And that night, jesus, I could have kissed you a thousand times, could have pulled you onto my lap and kissed you for hours."
“I’m sure he does,” John says, shaking his head. “He always said I was rubbish at it.”
XX67: I’m not using, John.
Laughters greet him when he pushes the door open, both Sherlock and Victor sitting on the sofa and looking up at him.
"Never," John replies honestly, and he feels Sherlock's foot slide higher on his leg. "I tell you what," he smiles. "Rosie needs to take a nap after lunch, so we'll see when she wakes up."
"Yes," Sherlock replies, "but it doesn't change the fact that the fear of letting you down kept me awake for too many nights. It doesn’t matter how much I want, you because there are times when that’s all I can think of. How much I crave you, even if I don’t know what it means, don’t know if this how everyone feels. I want to explore all of you, every inch of you, all the time, and I have no idea what to do."
The nails at his sides dig in, the sound of Sherlock’s zipper cuts into the silence and there are a few moments where they struggle to co-ordinate. They’re both trying to get rid of clothes and cooperate limbs, and it’s messy. John’s head bumps into the sharp of Sherlock’s jaw as he finally manages to struggle out of his own trousers, but the pool of cotton at Sherlock’s feet becomes a tangle that neither of them can seem to figure out.
“I just need to – you’re sure you definitely–”
, there, wasn’t there? Between the poised clench of Sherlock’s finger on the trigger and the tiny hairs rising on the back of John’s neck, something, a whispering glimmer of potential on a scale larger than before.
The elbow taking his weight near Sherlock’s left shoulder is starting to protest so John shifts, slips his thigh between Sherlock’s legs and switches to the other arm to hold himself up. The pressure of that movement elicits a moan from the man underneath him, so John does it again, wetting his own lip as the sound sets fire to his veins.
Perhaps he curses again but John can’t hear anything except the blood rushing in his own ears. His heartbeat, thumping out of time with the slow morning light around them, racing against his chest as if it may leap out.
“See you tomorrow, then” Sherlock manages, and closes his eyes for fear that keeping them open will only damage him more.
The disappointment in Sherlock’s entire body is palpable, once again being pulled back from the cusp of something he’s been falling towards for years. He watches John lean back in his chair again, withdrawing into his stoicism. There are things they can only confess in the suffocation of a coffin, death looming, that seem too much in the artificial light of a hospital room, with nurses and strangers walking around just outside. Sherlock doesn’t quite understand why, never really has, but he knows that there are words John simply cannot say to him in public. He accepts this, the pain of doing so more brutal than any knife.
“I think we’ve both –” John clears his throat, voice forgotten from the insistence of Sherlock’s kiss. Considers the words in his head, wrestles with them for a moment. “Yeah – we’ve both wanted – this, for a long time, right?”
The lungs beneath his hands jump a little as Sherlock laughs quietly, pushes off the wall to look at him.
“Been better,” John admits, his left hand brushing the metal edges of the ankle restraint he’s unknowingly sat next to.
“Mrs Hudson will throw a fit, Bunsen on the table”
“Shall we just watch some crap telly?” John suggests, already letting his tired bones sink into the sofa.
“Please, can you” Sherlock swallows, shuddering slightly as tremors of pain run through him. “Just once”
“Sherlock –“
. He soaps it under his arms and across his chest, between his legs and all the places Sherlock’s hands have been. Hopes he is not washing off the last of him – that there will be more, tomorrow or the day after or just one day, any day. He will wait.
Sherlock’s warm breath in his ear is more of a turn on than it should be, a stark contrast to the cold air. Soon John’s trousers and boxers are being pushed down over his hips, pooling at his ankles as he’s laid bare. Exposed and naked, in the middle of a forest of dying trees.
“I know” Sherlock says quietly. “I appreciate that, John”
sake” John swears under his breath, attempting to sort it out one handed.
“Better seize the moment then” Sherlock manages, a flush coming to his cheeks at his own breathy tone.
The thought vanishes with a long inhale as two fingers lift his chin, so cold they send sparks of ice from his jaw to his belly. Sherlock looks at him as if he’s trying not to, as if every second he does is a second he will regret, a second that’s painful and wanting.
They head back in silence, the ground crunching beneath their feet as they walk towards the path to the cottage. Mycroft is outside, so Sherlock stops where he his at the bottom of the garden and takes an offered cigarette. The older Holmes regards John with a raised eyebrow, and he doesn’t want to know what the man can see painted on his face. His lips are still swollen from Sherlock’s teeth and he smells like him, earthy sweat and smoke. There’s no chance Mycroft missed it.
Mrs Hudson disturbs them less, whether because she genuinely wants to give them privacy, or because her hip can’t take the stairs as much anymore. At least once a week they take a tray down to her once Rosie is asleep, gin and cakes and a vase of flowers. Sherlock’s arm somehow sneaks around John’s waist without him telling it to, pulling him close in their landlady’s kitchen while she pours their drinks.
“Right,” John says, flexing his hands once more before looking to the fireplace. “Tea”
He glances back at the hill again. Clouds are rolling in and it’s more than a bit nippy. John’s dressed for London, where even in the depths of winter, the blanket of pollution offers enough warmth not to warrant more than a sturdy jacket. He’s going to ruin his bloody shoes, too.
Since when does Sherlock talk to Mycroft about him? About anything, actually. John can’t decide if he’s mad or just embarrassed, but either way he’s thankful the heat rising in his cheeks is partly hidden, the clench of his jaw masked. To be honest he wasn’t even aware the brothers were on speaking terms at all, really. Sherlock doesn’t mention the elder Holmes, minus scheduling their visits to Sherringford.
“The storm?” John asks, watching as Sherlock finds the torch function on his phone.
John tries the handle even though it’s clearly no good. Mycroft hadn’t specified the preparations creepy butler had made, nor had he mentioned rooms at all, plural or otherwise. The storm howls again outside as Sherlock pushes by him and into the open bedroom. John stands there, rooted to the spot in the hallway, willing the locked door to magically spring open.
“I’ll be back tomorrow” John confirms quietly, tucking the sheet Rosie had disturbed back around Sherlock’s waist.
He’s changed, and though the notion throws him at first, it’s incredibly easy to settle into. Where once he would prefer the peaceful allure of chosen loneliness, he now craves the warmth of John’s breath on his chest and the sound of Rosie’s giggles filling the living room. Some days Sherlock even wants to leave the crime scenes as quickly as possible, because John flexing his medical brain does something dangerous to him, and now he’s allowed to act on those impulses it’s impossible not to.
The plush sheets are soft against the back of Sherlock’s head, twisting a little as he arches up into John’s poised body. He tries to reply
They’re really not prepared for this right now, stood in the middle of a woodland, the smell of pine filling John’s nostrils and making him slightly dizzy. Yet he wants it, so badly. The mild danger of doing this here, where anyone could find them, making him even more willing to let Sherlock do whatever the fuck he wants.
John’s not listening though, the expanse of the cellar suddenly seems a bit claustrophobic, the smell of aged wood and cold stone sticking in the back of his throat. Since moving back to Baker Street over the summer, that sensation of being gently smothered has been happening more frequently. John’s not sure what the trigger is, but it’s like drowning except dry, as if something is constricting every blood vessel in his body and stealing the air from his lungs. Maybe he’s still a little stuck, weighted down by the rocks that have slowly piled up over the last few years. Moving back in with Sherlock had been a step, a big one, despite the ease at which he and Rosie had settled right in. Now and again it feels unreal, like he’s a doppelganger in his own story, the plot laid out for him long ago. As if no matter what he does, the pages are already written.
“Still a bit tense then,” He ventures, lips pressed to the rim of the bottle as he takes a swig.
Any protest Sherlock was about to make gets caught in the back of his throat. John ghosts his palm over the hardness in Sherlock’s trousers, the touch there and also not at all. It’s maddening all of a sudden, but Sherlock does as he’s told and keeps his hands on the cool porcelain, veins jumping with anticipation.
but no one actually does, no one possibly can and it makes John want hit something. But he breathes, steadies himself by counting his pulse against strong fingers and reminding the monster inside his chest that even Sherlock hurts sometimes. That maybe he hurts most of all, now.
, Sherlock would say.
Just a reset, a second to reassure each other that everything is fine, even if it isn’t. If John is the guiding light then Sherlock is the compass, both necessary to keep right. Together they are grounding and certain, when nothing else is.
“But I will give you whatever you need”
“Here” Sherlock flops into the seat next to him, knee bumping John’s own.
“Yes, yes I do” John exhales, eyeing the bar wearily. “But I’m not going back over there”
Now Sherlock curses, between exhales as the zipper on his trousers is opened. John asks silently with hooded eyes for permission. Again, Sherlock nods his consent, the cool air of the bedroom on his naked skin momentarily dampening the low hum of pain. The ease with which John is moving, undressing him and pleasing him so effortlessly, as if he’s done this in his head a thousand times, makes Sherlock’s body yearn for it even more. Without any hesitation at all, John wraps a hand around him, biting his lip to stifle a moan as he works his hand up and down Sherlock’s length once.
Despite the cramp rising rapidly up his left leg, Sherlock doesn’t want to move. The water is on its way to lukewarm and his clothes are becoming unpleasant, but John’s torso is still there, pressed against him, his fingers absentmindedly stroking Sherlock’s hip. Reluctantly he does get up though, unfolding his body and climbing out of the tub in one fluid motion. He tugs out the plug, offering a hand to John who takes another moment or two to catch his breath before letting himself be pulled out.
fault that now he lives with two psychopaths and one of them actually owns a gun? Also what can he possibly come up with, now, to explain his current position in the kitchen of 221B (a kitchen that is no longer his and no more houses his best mug or his secret stash of sugar or his snarky notes taped to the fridge) what in god’s name can he say when really he has no idea if he wants to scream at Sherlock or Mary or himself?
They’ve been here before.
The only true constants are Friday evenings, when Sherlock returns from Sherringford and finds his flat isn’t empty. It never is, on those nights. John and Rosie are there, playing on the carpet or fast asleep in his armchair. They still don’t really speak, but there’s an understanding, a trying that promises a glimmer of hope. John pours them both a whisky and they just sit opposite each other, together in their solitary miseries, the tiny anchor of Rosie between them.
“The remote” Sherlock offers, a whisper of air across John’s cheeks.
The anchor, so they can slowly pull their way back to each other across that vast sea.
if John was dead.
The breath hisses between his teeth at the carelessness of the driver, but Sherlock doesn’t relent. He’s way beyond accepting favours from his brother, their relationship respectful but still strained despite their truce. Ten days away from a case of any kind has been bad enough, Sherlock just wants Baker Street and familiarity and perhaps another painkiller or two. He doesn’t speak again until they arrive at 221B, shucking off John’s offered arm as he takes the stairs slowly.
Sherlock hands the bottle back silently, so John presses it to his lips again. Immediately he can taste the other man, a slight bitterness and warmth he already knows the notes of. They’ve breathed the same oxygen and lived the same life for so long, the tang of Sherlock’s mouth on the edge of the glass is not unknown. For some reason though, it heats his belly more than whisky usually would, some chemical reaction that makes John falter for a minute before matching Sherlock’s pace.
“John – “ Sherlock begins, cut off by John’s tongue pushing into his mouth.
Pale wrists vibrate slightly as Sherlock brings the edges of his thumbs to his cheeks, holds them against his eyes as they begin to release, finally.
Sherlock’s lids close for a second and then the look is gone, something warm and satisfied in its place again. Long fingers cover his own and Sherlock kisses him, leans in just like he had in the living room, in the shower, even though the spike of adrenaline is over and there are no boundaries left to break. John presses back, marvels at how quickly he has become used to the taste of his mouth.
John breathes a laugh, Sherlock feels it against his sternum.
Instead, his body is impatient and his mind only focussed on the mouth slowly lowering to the glistening head of his cock, John’s tongue swiping at the flushed skin eagerly. Each feeling is new, every touch more consuming than the last, as John gradually pushes his lips down, enveloping the tip in a deliciously soft heat. The mouth around him moves precisely and leisurely, just enough to drive him insane, dancing perilously close to the edge already.
One of them should say something. John should, probably, remove his hands – one now combing slowly through sweat ruined curls, the other drifting back and forth between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, stalling on the fold of his shirt collar. Yet he does nothing to remedy any of it, trapped in a place neither of them has ever really been before.
Sooo I wrote this incredibly quickly because it needed to be out of my brain. The happier conclusion of chapter 1, which is essential reading for this chapter to make sense.
“Yeah, I don’t think you’re getting that one back”
John looks to the stars, counts to ten and breathes. Sherlock continues on through the shadowy towering evergreens, weaving in and out so fast John has trouble keeping up. He gets out his phone for a second to check that Mrs Hudson hasn’t messaged (they have been rather a long time, after all), but his screen is blank. When he looks up again, Sherlock is gone.
“You know, if you ever want to –“
Which is true. John once tried to convince a doorman that they were there to do an audit, gave up halfway through his speech and knocked the brute out with the hilt of his gun instead. Impressive, but not a great testimonial to his theatre skills. This would require something more than acting, a suspension of disbelief, a brutally realistic trick.
Sherlock isn't entirely sure if that question is aimed his way or to John himself. With every ounce of strength Sherlock asks his body to move, but he can only get so far as an outstretched arm, reaching for John in the low light. When their hands meet, John immediately wraps the other around the back of Sherlock’s neck, mouth open and wanting so quickly he barely has chance to inhale. This time those lips are sure and strong against Sherlock’s own, not diminished with the threat of death, but alight with the promise of more. Instant pain shoots up the length of his neck as he strains towards John’s touch, trying to get as much of him as possible in case it doesn’t last. The hurt is only eclipsed by his own desire, pooling hot and needy in his stomach.
Sherlock still hasn’t said anything. Peels off his Belstaff and throws it with disregard over the desk chair. Rolls up his sleeves and kicks off his shoes too. Slumps down into his armchair looking shattered and slightly grey, and older than John ever remembers him being.
He does not stir as the man beneath his arm blinks into consciousness, as his doctor blurs back into the present; as
There’s a fight with the duvet. Sherlock’s sheets are like silk, maybe actually are, and cling to every part of his body like static. John lies on his back and realises Sherlock is too, and they’re not touching, and that just isn’t good enough. Then he tries to turn, leaning over on his shoulder, except he’s on the wrong side of the bed, so the wound there that still gives him grief now and again, protests.
Mercifully, the conversation doesn’t require a conclusion. The ancient looking lightbulb above them suddenly starts to flicker, stuttering inside its patterned glass lampshade, before going out completely. The small spotlights illuminating the path outside also cease, and everything plunges into darkness. They’re saved by the warm glow of the fire, picking out the furniture and bookcases in orange as they both get up to check the light switch.
Fuck it all off, because it feels too good – Sherlock, feels so good – his teeth biting and tongue soothing, being consumed by him as he has from the beginning. It feels right. So much more right than John had ever imagined it could be.
“No,” John admits, lifting his chin in some final act of defiance against his own tentative mind. “No, it’s not at all”
“John,” He breathes into greyed hair, wordlessly trying to communicate that John should move, the tension in his arms and shoulder must be unbearable by now.
“Scotland Yard are on their way” Sherlock threatens through his heavy breathing, dabbing at his lip with the edge of his shirt.
John actually has the gall to roll his eyes, and Sherlock’s not sure where he’s picked up this temper but it flares like an unwelcome monster in his belly. He grabs John’s wrists so forcefully it elicits a painful intake of breath, holds them in front of them both palms up. If John’s knuckles weren’t already sore and broken, Sherlock may have just been on the receiving end of them. Instead, he looks at him vacantly, as if knowing the words before they hiss from his lips.
Sherlock has him trapped. One thigh between John’s legs, leather gloved fingers pinning his left wrist almost painfully, the other hand pulling in his hair – and John fucking loves it. Cannot believe he has lived this long without it. The taste of cinnamon and cigarette smoke paints his gums and even
It’s miles more appealing than the room full of strangers they’ve just come from, at least. Sherlock can’t argue with that. The bed they’re sat on is temptingly soft, the room itself pleasantly warm and inviting relaxation, despite the suggestive décor and furnishings. For a short time they sit in silence, Sherlock unsure of what to do or say given the events of the last hour.
But Sherlock already knows that, and John must realise it too, now staring at his own treacherous hand. Those fingers stay there though, just holding Sherlock in place as he searches John’s eyes for whatever comes next.
An unflattering thin gown covers his chest now, the ventilator gone. Tentatively he tests his lungs, breathing deeply until he feels them pinch at the edges. Not as bad as it could be, though his entire right side aches with a half numb heaviness. Sherlock tries to move his hand to lift his gown, inspect the damage, but the effort is too much.
Sherlock lets it happen. He watches the icy cold waves batter John’s body, he tastes the salt of it in the air around them, in the kitchen as he makes tea and the vibration of his violin notes as they evaporate on John’s skin. It’s a storm and Sherlock can do nothing but stand on the rocks next to him and let it weather his friend, hoping the force of it hasn’t eroded too much when it passes.
” He repeats, those deft fingers finding the short hairs at John’s nape and tugging.
The remains of his self-control are fading away like flaking paint in front of him. If Sherlock were to push his tongue past John’s teeth, it would undo all the stitches they have been weaving between them. Replace those thin threads with something needy and unsightly, a grotesque version of what could be beautiful, given half a chance. Neither of them deserves that. As much as they want it - John
to the surface. God knows he’s been trying to get something from Sherlock other than empathy and tolerance, something that doesn’t want to make John try and fix him, find the pieces that went missing during those two years of being dead and alive all at once.
Rosie struggles in his arms, so John puts her down to flick on the light, the winter sun barely awake in the early morning. Her tiny feet totter across the carpet and straight to Sherlock’s chair.
“Who’s Greg?” Sherlock manages to rough out, crinkling the space between his eyebrows.
That catches John’s attention enough for him to lift his gaze and narrow his eyes, the beginnings of irritation clenching his jaw. It’s a certain kind of look somewhere between anger and intrigue that Sherlock sometimes likes to provoke for fun.
Sherlock is naked, holding open the bathroom door for him.
An observation, not a direct question, unless Sherlock wants it to be. For a few moments the other man says nothing, encouraging the growing fire with a poker, his back still to John. Sherlock’s creation crackles and spits as he feeds a small log into the heat, and he waits there, patiently tending to it until the edges catch and the flames eat it hungrily.
John shivers, eyes casting over the expanse of white outside.
Sherlock’s mouth is moving, but he isn’t speaking either. John can feel it open and close there against his sternum, the fleshy hill of that bottom lip catching on his shirt buttons, as if he’s trying and faltering over and over again.
, Sherlock notes, and stores that little slip up for later. John looks tentative for a moment but then relents, nodding his head with a small smile as Lestrade lets the door open fully. Rosie totters in first, her tiny hand clasped in Molly’s behind her. The fascination on her face is immediately evident, not at all phased by the tubes and beeps surrounding Sherlock as she almost runs to his bedside.
There are scratches on Sherlock’s arms. Long red lines and blurry scrapes. John looks at his own hands, bitten with cuts, dirty still from wet soil and clawing his nails at old brick. Replays the thought he had, down there in the darkness alone, that this was the end. And how amid the panic and vaguely scrabbling for purchase, after the final kick of adrenaline – he could do little else to make it stop.
“Getting anything?” John murmurs against his neck, lips brushing the flesh there with his words.
“I’m not a good man”
No not wholly good, but better now and cleaner than John. Because John is a cheater if not yet physically then mentally; has been betraying his counterfeit wife since the beginning and being unfaithful to himself for even longer. All Sherlock did was kill himself but didn’t and forgot to tell John; and even though he understands and accepts it, John still cannot let it go, so there must be something very, very wrong with him.
Then, John’s eyes flick away and focus on a spot just over Sherlock’s shoulder. They follow a target and Sherlock waits until they settle again before speaking.
“Are you going to undress me, too?”
John manages it though, squeezes his palm behind his back and turns it with his tongue in Sherlock’s mouth.
“Immensely” Sherlock replies, the smirk in his voice audible. “I have a line of defence against Stanley now”
They look at each other, John’s throat audible as he swallows whatever he was about to say. Sherlock wonders for a moment if he’s made the right decision. There’s a vast landscape of emptiness in his friend’s eyes suddenly, the horizon of his lips set in a solemn line. He’s still stained with crimson, rich reds darkening on his skin. The copper would taste bitter, and it takes all of Sherlock’s resolve not to try it.
“You’ll stay here tonight, and in the morning you will go back to Mary”
“But we can’t, we’re not –
Somehow Sherlock’s made himself closer; John feels as if he’s crawling right into him with his eyes so blue and honest, the heat from his shirt sending shivers along his neck. He knows that it’s too late, now, far too acute a situation to be able to turn back and shake it off like falling dust from a quake. Sherlock’s let go of his wrist and so John puts his fingertips to his chest instead; watches his muscles tighten beneath the almost-touch, hears oxygen hiss through the man’s nose, unsteady.
me, Sherlock? Hm? Tell me that”
John can't argue with that.
Sherlock looks sad, still. The gaze he’d held so firmly drifts away to the frosted grass at his feet, and John sees doubt and embarrassment crinkling the lines of his face. He’s doing a shit job at this. He’s come all this way and now the moment of redemption is slipping from his numbing fingertips.
Just as he’s about to give John that excuse, the man Sherlock has been trying to watch rises from his seat, leaving his partner to walk the room again. He appears to be heading in their direction, stopping at every other table to share a few words or an embrace with the other men sitting in their booths. In a few moments, the blonde haired gambler will reach their table, and the game will be up.
John is gone for all of three minutes, yet in that short expanse, Sherlock conjures lists of reasons why he won’t come back. His fear that in John’s journey to the kitchen, he will find some rationale in the depths of his head to denounce whatever it is they just became, is real. It’s happened before, in one way or another, many times. Gingerly he pushes himself up a little against the pillow, enough so he can at least try for some dignity in his nakedness when John returns.
John inhales sharply through his nose and the smell of Sherlock tightens the knot in his stomach.
John should feel guilt and shame, but all he can actually feel is Sherlock’s cock hardening against his hip. They’ve barely spoken a word, yet the intent is clear. He can’t even question how they got here because it’s been slowly building for months now. John felt it start in the weak beat of Sherlock’s heart as he lay on the floor dying, his shaking fingers dialling an ambulance, in the grip of his arm as he fell to the carpet in Baker Street days later, in the weeks of space after, as they trod carefully around each other until their orbits collided once more. It was easy to pretend, between the cases and distractions, that nothing else existed. That Leinster Gardens had been a dream within a dream.
The next few weeks are not Sherlock’s favourite. He has waited so long for this to happen, that every day and every stupidly tiny amount of possessions John brings through the door is like a new wound. Sherlock wants him now, all of him, wants to scream
John holds out the alcohol wipes and steri-strips without looking him in the eye. He takes them, and watches as cotton peels away from the damaged flesh of John’s chest and back. There are bruises beginning to form abstract against his sternum. Where only freckles should be, there are cuts from knuckles and a deeper one just below his collarbone from the edge of a blade. Sherlock is furious at each of them, and even more so with the man they litter.
John huffs a small laugh, his eyes dewy with afterglow and waning candlelight. Carefully he peels the shirt off Sherlock’s shoulders, takes the corners of the towel and wraps it around them both. It’s another pure and intimate moment, and Sherlock hears the oxygen hitch in his own throat at how natural it feels.
“Don’t worry brother, I know where the wine cellar is” Sherlock says, already marching out of the room, heels clicking on the shiny floor. “Tour starts this way, John!”
Morning blue eyes never leave his own, as John finishes what he started on Sherlock’s shirt buttons. They are prised from their holes one by one, slowly enough that Sherlock has to clench his jaw to stop himself from letting out a groan of frustration. Mercifully, John doesn’t wait much longer to touch him, mapping the contours of his chest and waist with his lips, tongue circling his navel and sucking at the hollow above his hip bone. Sherlock pulls painfully against his bound wrists, as John presses an open mouth to his clothed cock, hard beneath his trousers.
They’re really going to do this, John realises. Because Sherlock’s hands haven’t left the waistband of his jeans, and his eyes haven’t stopped raging with icy fire since he looked up at him from his armchair.
“Christ,” John curses, tilting his neck so Sherlock can graze teeth lightly over his sensitive skin. “Christ’s sake, don’t ever stop doing that”
But he cannot lie to John, he cannot hold back this truth, despite the many he has hidden from him all this time. Once again, he must tear John Watson’s life apart, bit by dreadful bit, in order to save everyone he loves. Knowing it’s a hallucination doesn’t make it any less real, and Sherlock reaches out, strains the tubes stuck in his arm, in the hope that his weak fingers may find something solid. A hand, with a pulse and blood and life running through it. Mary’s face, alive, so that he may repair the man she left behind.
A part of John still tries to keep him stuck there, rooted to the spot. He shouldn’t be here, not really. Everything up until this point has been shoving him in another direction, trying to cast them out far across that endless water away from each other, rope be damned.
Sherlock. Mercifully, John’s not alone in this hellscape, suddenly aware of the body lying next to him, must only be centimetres from his side. Wherever they are it’s not good and they’re definitely not okay, that much John can tell, as he stretches his arm out to the right and feels a solid barrier stopping him. He immediately presses up, reaching in front of his face from the flat of his back, and finds a similar rough of wood in his way, just before his elbow can lock.
John’s right hand closes over Sherlock’s left. He straightens, so Sherlock’s forehead finds the base of his neck instead. Blood, sweat and another man’s smell linger on the skin there. Given long enough, he could probably decipher the aftershave used by the criminal responsible for the desecration, but he gets distracted. Betrayed by his own lips, that seek out the unmarred centimetres of skin just below John’s hairline.
“Sherlock –“
“Hang on, what about the tree?” John stops in his tracks, tugging Sherlock back with his hand.
“I picked out the tree ages ago,” Sherlock smiles. “It’s already wrapped and ready to go”
“Knowing Mycroft, they probably feed straight through to Number 10”
There’s a head-rushing dirty moment where John hears Sherlock suck his own thumb into his mouth, coating it with saliva. He nearly finishes right then at the wet sound of it, knowing what the next sensation will be.
“Buried alive,” Sherlock finishes, keeping his tone steady. “A little bit, yes”
“Sherlock, I –“
“Happy now?” John asks the ceiling, letting his eyes adjust to the inky black as Sherlock locks his phone beside him.
voice.
John finishes with nails digging into Sherlock’s hips, holding him as close as possible. In another universe it might be beautiful and momentous, but here it’s just a brief minute of ecstasy. Immediately John is far too cold and it’s all too real, and he doesn’t know what to do, now. Sherlock produces a handkerchief and wipes the mess off his trousers, folding it neatly back in on itself and shoving it into his pocket. They’re still cocooned in Sherlock’s coat.
Sherlock tried so hard to will his lips to move. To create words but he couldn't. He pushed his vocal chords to make noise and a small whimper-ish sound came out. That was all he could manage but he hoped it was enough.
“Yes, John?” Sherlock whispered gently, still scared to make too much noise.
“Sherlock, I-” John stopped short unsure what to say.
“We’re both so stupid,” Sherlock laughed as he leaned down to connect their lips once again. This time the kiss was deep and passionate, both men seeming desperate to be closer to the other. Sherlock began walking backwards until the back of his knees hit the sofa before turning them around and lowering John to the sofa and straddling the shorter man’s hips, never letting their lips separate.
When he walked through the doors everyone was looking at him, something he had become relatively used to lately as a side effect of his social status and openness of his sexuality, but this time it was different.
“John, you can stay in here tonight,” Sherlock began.
“I’m so sorry, John,” Sherlock sobbed, looking down at the doctor who was holding his now dead wife in his arms.
When Sherlock had finished bathing his friend, he pulled John from the shower and began towelling him dry. Even when he was married, John had never been tended to this thoroughly. The actions seemed too intimate, but he was trying not to overthink it. Sherlock was only trying to be a good friend.
Sherlock almost sighed in relief, “God, yes.”
Sherlock was surrounded by black once again. But this time there was nothing remotely solid for him to grip onto, he could feel himself slipping. He could no longer hear John in the distance, his head felt like it was underwater. There was a pressure on his whole body. He had nothing.
Sherlock signaled the blonde- honestly he should have paid more attention to the man’s name- to wait in the hall for a moment. “I thought you had the late shift tonight?” Sherlock questioned casually.
“What?” Sherlock said, unable to distinguish what the army doctor had said.
His thoughts continued through the night as the sun rose and flooded the room with natural light and John began to stir awake. John yawned and slowly opened his eyes. He smiled when he realized Sherlock was still there with his arms wrapped around him. “Good morning,” John whispered, his voice still a little bit rough from crying.
Sherlock could barely sense the voice. It seemed far off and blurry. He couldn't tell who it was or what they were saying. He didn't want to be saved. Nothing mattered anymore. Without John there wasn’t a reason for anything to matter. John had been his conductor of light. Now that it had faded out, he didn't want to walk away from this.
John’s face turned bright red and Sherlock let out a loud laugh of relief, “That was rather the point.” Sherlock reattached his lips to John’s neck and ground his hips down once again, dedicating the sound that fell from John’s lips to his memory.
Sherlock Holmes was a wonderful lab partner, smarter than any of the other students in the class, John included, but he never insisted on doing the lab himself. In fact, Sherlock seemed to even value John’s opinion sometimes, even when he was entirely wrong.
John looked up at his lover, stunned silence filling the air. “Sherlock,” John managed, trying his best to keep his voice even. The other man looked into his eyes and John spoke again, “are you sure? We don’t have to do everything tonight if you don’t want to. I don’t want to pressure you.”
John took one more second to ensure the detective really was ready, not letting his lust fully cloud his judgement, before pulling out and slicking his cock and placing it against Sherlock’s sensitive arse. “Say please,” John smirked down at his lover.
John shifted back and brought a hand to the younger boy's high cheekbone, looking into those beautiful blue eyes. "It’s okay, Sherlock. Because rumor has it the rugby captain is hopelessly in love with you too.”
John sighed, “I supposed I’m doing as well as can be expected, Sherlock.” John paused. Something was bothering the detective and he was going to figure out what it was. John lifted one of his arms and brushed it through Sherlock’s hectic curls, “However, this was traumatic for you too. Are you okay?”
John began enthusiastically biting and kissing down the detective’s neck. He let his lips trail down to Sherlock’s collarbone where he sucked and bit a dark bruise into the sensitive flesh and then repeated this along the entire expanse of the younger man’s pale neck. When he was finished John pulled away momentarily to admire his work and Sherlock observed John as he watched the doctor’s pupils dilate impossibly further.
“But Orion was never dead, not really,” (Barely above a whisper, but Sherlock’s ears
“Sherlock?” John asks, as if he’s just been saying something important.
“Would you like to come inside and bake some Christmas cookies with me?” She asks, taking his daughter’s small hand into her own.
“I think we got what we needed” He says, and follows John through the door.
“I think we just broke several laws” John says, turning to face Sherlock, whose blush is evident even in the sparse light.
“Your self-flagellation is obvious. This isn’t you, John”
“Oh my god” Sherlock breathes, watching as their final present emerges from the back seat, leaping onto the gravel below.
“You can’t sleep on the floor” Sherlock states, tone even. “You’re old”
No part of Sherlock attempts to stop the exasperated sigh parting his lips, as he gingerly pushes his bedroom door open. The solace of sleep has never seemed more appealing, yet Sherlock doubts it will come that easily tonight. John places both cups on the beside table and stares at them, apparently lost in some internal battle that Sherlock doesn’t have the energy to unpick right now. With great effort he sits on the edge of the bed, toes off his shoes.
“I take it there’s no way out?” John ventures, still clinging to the chance of a miracle.
The warning is heeded, John withdrawing slowly, lips smacking as he pulls off Sherlock’s cock completely. John’s breaths come hard and fast from his nose, as he pushes a hand into Sherlock’s hair, tugging hard to bring their mouths together, moving to straddle Sherlock again. The frantic pace is welcomed. Sherlock can’t hold out much longer with all the new and overwhelming sensation sparking over him, can feel everything becoming tight and saturated. He pushes his cock against John’s stomach as they kiss, keening for any kind of friction as he becomes drunk with need. John bites at his jaw and neck, wrapping a hand around both of them in unison, his eyes supernova as they try to catch Sherlock’s own with each pull.
They look at each other, Sherlock’s pink nose flaring as he lifts his chin to regard him. There’s a confusion there, John realises. A disbelief. He continues before Sherlock can speak again, the threat of losing his confidence prompting the words from his mouth to be louder, more certain.
It’s a Weimaraner, if John’s not mistaken, doing its best to bound towards them, satin coat almost shimmering in the daylight. He knows his mouth is hanging open a little. Rosie looks between them both with a mischievous grin before letting go of the lead. The puppy sprints straight towards Sherlock, who crouches down with outstretched arms and nearly gets knocked backwards with the enthusiasm of uncontrollable limbs.
God knows how he’s managing to coordinate his limbs, but John’s fingers find Sherlock’s shirt, pull until buttons slip through holes and he can push the designer cotton off his chest. Sherlock’s skin is pale and freckled with moles and scars, a collection of sins and sacrifices John couldn’t care less about right now. His nose bumps Sherlock’s chin painfully as his lips follow his hands, kissing and dragging his teeth across exposed skin as if he only gets this one chance to do so. Nails dig into John’s scalp, Sherlock’s fingers tightening in his hair with every adoration of his chest, fighting for purchase, and John’s vision is swimming, his heart hammering loud and fast.
John prises himself from the back of his eyelids, blinks away his treacherous tear and says
Now, that hand is gripping the edge of his shoulder not to stop him, but for support. To stay vertical, because Sherlock is close, John can feel it aching in the air between them. As the hum of the crowd leaving the church gets louder, so does Sherlock’s breathing, inhales becoming sharper the more the risk of being caught increases. Interesting. John alternates between quick strokes and purposefully gentle pulls of Sherlock’s cock, watching the reactions wane and bloom in the cosmos of his eyes.
John opens his mouth to protest but he is in fact correct. Now he’s fully awake again, the ache in his shoulder is already annoying, his neck cracking as he stretches it out from side to side. The plush looking mattress is tempting, soft and warmed by Sherlock’s body. The storm outside whistles its agreement, hitting at the single pane windows as if it might break through at any moment.
when it’s so right, and John’s eyes get caught by the startling clarity of Sherlock’s as he comes, hot and whimpering, thighs trembling and head consumed with Sherlock’s own cavernous moan as he follows suit, shivering.
A strong hand grips Sherlock’s waist and John pulls him down a little as he scoots up again, trying to gain the height advantage. It works to disrupt the slow grinding Sherlock had managed to build up between John’s legs, and he’s momentarily disappointed. Then there are fingers working open his sodden shirt, see through against his chest as it’s peeled apart, and John grazes his nipples with the pad of his thumb.
Sherlock feels his lips trembling, some indistinguishable response lost in his struggling lungs. He holds John’s fixed eyes for as long as he can, simultaneously pushing into his hand and pulling away from the wall, seeking every bit of touch he can get.
“That’s what I liked most about him – we laughed together, always together”
They both break into giggles now, that childish kind of chuckling that earns them sideways glances at crime scenes. It’s not often they get to do this, just sit and be in each other’s presence with nothing else to distract them. John feels the tiny stones in his heart breaking apart a little more each time it happens, slowly chipping away at every terrible thing he did to the patient man next to him. Somehow they survived it all, and some tear in the fabric of the universe allows them to do this still, be friends and laugh and drink expensive booze while snow falls outside, as if nothing else at all exists.
He’s breathing steadily through his nose, concentrating on staying conscious until John is satisfied with his work. There’s the briefest of pauses, where Sherlock thinks maybe John will claim the space between them again, press his nose just there on the peak of his cheekbone – but he doesn’t. He darts his eyes across Sherlock’s face and presses his lips together tightly instead, repressing another want that he so clearly is leaning towards.
“Wait, you’re still recovering,” John says, thumb tracing lines at Sherlock’s chin. “I don’t want to hurt you”
John sticks the wordless note back to the fridge, places the pen exactly where it was, and does not look back.
“It’s a shame we’re mostly law-abiding citizens,” John comments, pulling a few notes from one of the leather pockets. “We could be rich by now with your pickpocketing skills”
“I’m not sure you’re that proficient an actor, John”
“Whisky before wine?” The man asks, pausing to raise an eyebrow before taking a drink.
“Sherlock,” John hisses, chest still constricted by Sherlock’s grip around him. “What in the hell are you doing?”
“Now if you don’t mind, I have business to attend to. I’m sure you can entertain yourselves”
And then again no, not
. The words slip out before John can catch them, stilling Sherlock’s hand as he lifts the glass to his lips. Those guarded eyes look down at him, the fire light catching the curvature of dark pupils at they assess. It’s not the first time John’s been on the receiving end of that particular gaze, half deducing and half wondering, trying to figure out if John’s words were a slip of the tongue or a challenge.
, how could he not foresee the trajectory and speed and
John reaches down to move the bags he’s abandoned on the floor and his shoulder twinges rather obviously. Sherlock quickly takes the weight of them and clears a square of space on the counter, putting the bottles of cava into the fridge.
Synonyms now, while John is thrusting his hips into Sherlock’s fist, knocking his skull back against the tile while lips ruin his neck.
The suggestion pinches John’s eyebrows for a moment, a refusal sitting on the brink of his lips. He moves to shake his head so Sherlock asks again, his suggestion not entirely selfless.
– didn’t need to happen. The situation was under control and you purposefully made it worse”
White noise screams in John ears, and perhaps if it ceased, he would be able to hear the shifting of earth above him. Could find solace in the scraping of metal on wood, as people feet above them dig and dig.
smiles into his oxygen mask, and brushes his lips against a single dark curl of hair.
Sherlock crinkles his forehead in return –
Stability is suddenly lost as Sherlock’s arm moves away from his chest and John’s own grip on that steady limb is forced to drop, falling uselessly to his side. Long slender fingers come to rest on the edge of his upper thigh, hesitant for a moment. John tries desperately not to buck into Sherlock’s other palm, still wrapped around his cock and moving far too slowly. There’s nothing to hold onto now, so John reaches behind blindly to find the edges of Sherlock’s coat, twisting his fists into the wool.
Sherlock
If he could concentrate at all, for just a second, Sherlock could probably read their whole conversation. That accidental touch of a warm mouth against his skin is entirely too distracting though, all senses zeroing in on the slightly chapped yet soft flesh, the tickle of John’s hair at his earlobe.
Unsatisfied, Sherlock’s gaze returns to the face searching his own. John looks worse than perhaps he’s ever seen him, a bruise faded to lurid yellow at his chin, his frame thinner and ashen underneath his maroon chequered shirt. Maybe he should ask John how he is, it’s the normal thing to do, but the answer is so obvious it negates the question. And though he should be flattered by the clear worry the man has expended on him, Sherlock finds himself sad and remorseful and wanting to shut his eyes again.
Sherlock doesn’t say a word but that’s fine because John doesn’t want to hear it; he needs to get this out and quick because he’s on the precipice of something he can’t come back from; doesn’t want to come back from, has to fall into because it’s been
And John -
He presses on regardless though. They have, after all, agreed to take the case, on John’s insistence. Bailing so late in the day would be unacceptable, even for him. The instigator behind Sherlock’s discomfort looks even more uneasy than he does. John’s precariously tight white t-shirt is only eclipsed by the hip hugging black jeans he wears, the outline of his phone comically visible in his pocket. His ensemble is a tad ridiculous, yet Sherlock can’t take his eyes off the pleasing sculpture of John’s biceps, slightly tanned from the relentlessly hot summer they’ve been having. Perhaps he’s been working out, Sherlock thinks. This is the first time he’s really seen John out of a long-sleeved shirt or jumper since becoming not-dead, and the changes are noticeable.
“Then you know,” John says quietly, the vibration of his voice skittering across Sherlock’s neck as he leans into him. “What I want to do to you?”
Maybe he should turn around. Head home, if that’s the right definition. The smothering weather engulfs and fogs John’s head; he can’t even work out if he’s pissed off or angry or sad or just needs some comfort. And it’s been just over a fortnight since the hospital (since his heart was pulled so publicly from his body, bruised and blackened and now rotting, a slow decay) but Jesus, he could really do with a break. A clean slate, some white noise - just an hour or so, just that, in his old worn out chair with tea in a dirty mug and the threat of impending doom from some meaningless case salting the air.
The church bells begin to toll and John starts at the sound, his body jumping in Sherlock’s arms. He finds blue eyes and they both laugh inappropriately, low and ridiculous and dirty as the short huffs of air turn into moans. They are in a fucking graveyard, and John is spilling curses from his lips into the curve of Sherlock’s neck, his own fingers eventually finding purchase on the hem of an expensive shirt and claiming the skin beneath it hungrily.
When they reach the Violet Club, Sherlock briefly thinks about turning back. The dark alley leading to the door reminds him of the hidden streets of Prague, passageways and seedy bars he had frequented for a few weeks undercover, back when he didn’t exist. Sherlock had consumed more alcohol in those twenty days than he had during his entire time as a student, the thought of it now bringing the memory of bile to the back of his throat.
For a moment John thinks he’s being ignored - is met by nothing but silence and the hidden hollows of Sherlock’s face lit by artificial light.
All too suddenly it’s done, and John catches the last of Sherlock’s delicious noises in his mouth, drinking them greedily from his lips. He tries to keep the moment for as long as he can, angling his forehead against Sherlock’s until his pulse settles again.
Apparently they do this, now.
“You bloody gem” He says, cupping a hand underneath the crumbly mess as he shoves it unceremoniously into his mouth.
There are a few seconds of quiet as John stills his breathing, pressing his forehead to the nape of Sherlock’s neck. The pressure in his trousers is actually getting painful now, and Sherlock’s knuckles are going white from his tight grip on the rim of the bathtub. Yet he still doesn’t move. He allows John to reign himself back in, step back from the edge as his cock throbs insistently against Sherlock’s back.
“A four?” John asks with a small laugh, starting to eat and Sherlock forces himself to pick at his own food as he replies.
I’m attaching a photo to this letter. This is what I wake up to every morning.
XX32: Sure used to act like one before. Listen, Sherlock, I really didn’t call for us to fight over this.
: 12 minutes 18 seconds.
"Matthew, Sherlock's fiancé," Matthew replies, turning to walk back to Sherlock. "You didn't tell him?"
The explanation for the parallel universes in this chapter comes directly from my own non-scientific brain.
Sherlock chuckles quietly, pulling away to look at him, "I don't understand," he says, "even after yesterday, after everything we said and confessed, I still feel so... hesitant. About everything."
“I… hmm, yeah. I mean, not right now, but in the future, yeah. If that’s alright, of course.”
John is being an idiot, and Sherlock loves him to a point it makes something ache inside his chest. They are already walking up the three stairs to his parent’s front door, snow having transformed the landscape into a white desert, and John is looking at him half alarmed, half resigned.
Pauline.
Lestrade reads over what he just wrote, "Once you went out, John followed you, right?"
“In here!”
“Hmm,” John sighs, his entire body melting into the mattress. “Goodnight.”
Getting into the car
“What is it you want then?”
“You didn’t,” John smiles, a bit brighter this time, and really, Sherlock can’t do anything else but stare. “It’s not fair, you now. You deduced in an instant why I was at this pub, but I still don’t know why you were there.”
“I’ve stopped trying to understand how they’re doing all this a long time ago, John.”
I hope you liked this short Rosie's POV!
"She's clever," Sherlock points out, straightening up. "She'll figure it out before the end of the night."
“You can deduce anyone, right?” John asks, and Sherlock thanks him silently for the change of subject, and he nods. “What about the people here?”
"But I didn't send that text, or all the others for that matter," Sherlock continues, having now turned to face him. "Mrs Hudson begged me to call you, Lestrade told me about all the times you asked for news, and I realised I was angry." He stops, breathing out deeply. "At you." John shudders, refusing to break their eye contact. "Why should I be the one to text or call? You had a phone too if you were using it to call Lestrade. You could be the one to reach out."
“Good,” John smiles, kissing over his pulse point. “Because I have one.”
There is nothing Sherlock can do about the desperate moan that echoes inside the room the moment their lips meet. Unable to do anything else, he holds on tightly to John’s hand as he lets him take his every breath away. And when John pulls away almost immediately, he can only protest weakly, “No, no, don-”
Sherlock is already sitting in one of the chairs facing Lestrade's desk, and John barely has the time to sit down himself before he starts, "Everything went as planned. Horsen bought the costume, came back home around seven and we left at eight-fourteen to go to the club."
“I mean,” Greg continues, “actually talking?”
apparently I can’t stop
“And by the way, talking about shared room, those were really complicated situations,” John says, laughing.
“Not an option, no,” John replies, picking up a pen and paper. “What about… finishing a book you gave up on?”
in your own letter?
By now I expect you had the time to deal with the situation, and I even dare hope, manage to talk about it with Sherlock. If he’s anything like my Sherlock, then he’s probably dying to understand what is happening, and as always, he needs us to do so. I know we’ve never been “good” with words when it comes to situations like this, but trust me when I say that there is no other option here than just that: words.
What happened? Did they just had drinks and dinner? Maybe had a walk, talked and laughed and mo-
might seem too eager but
John looks at the house they’ve just stopped by, frowning.
“Alright.”
Toby licking his hand makes him jump, and Sherlock looks down at him, “You’re right, it’s too early for these kind of thoughts.” Toby barks, tongue wetting his hand again before going to look around the garden. Sherlock goes back intp the kitchen, grabbing the few letters he left on the table yesterday and opens the first one on his way back outside. He sits down, recognizing Rosie’s handwriting, and lets himself smile as he begins to read.
don’t want to talk to you,
that well in the past.
Sherlock choses defense, “I, as you said so many times, am human, John. Humans get erections.”
I wasn’t sure I’d find you again
“Is he waiting already?” John asks.
______
By the time he manages to store it all at the right places, the fire has died. He represses a sigh because of course he would even ruin that, but he doesn’t have the time to do anything about it when he hears the floor cracking. He looks up just in time to watch John walk back inside the room, a cover around him but his entire body shaking anyway.
If Sherlock was blushing before, John isn’t sure what to call his reaction now. He forces himself not to move, waiting for any sign telling him he needs to go now before overwhelming Sherlock too much.
"If you mean Rosie, then yes," Sherlock replies, eyes fixed on his mouth and it takes all of John's will not to just kiss him already. "I didn't know she was coming," Sherlock continues, the previous edge of desperation in his voice now gone.
"Enough?" He asks after another thrust.
“I was serious when I said I didn’t mean to bring it up,” John whispers, suddenly afraid to break the atmosphere settling around them. “I’ve had dates that were just about sex, and this is far from it.” Sherlock’s eyes search his for a long moment, and John lets him read there whatever he needs to find. “You are breathtakingly beautiful, Sherlock, and I’d be lying if I said I don’t want you, but I want so much more than that too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock only hummed his response, too afraid of what he might sound like if he’d speak right now.
We didn’t say much about it all morning, simply taking comfort in each other presence and letting
“Because you confessed just a few hours ago that this is brand new to you,” John replies, finding that he really liked the sight of Sherlock’s flushed cheeks. “And I now realise I might have been pushing too far with this whole coffee thing.”
I’ll tell you about it.
This is first time I've written 45 chapters to get to the first kiss, and I hope you've all enjoyed the journey so far :)
Sherlock seems to be only able to moan his name, demanding another kiss with hungry lips devouring his, and John can only gives in to more, more, more. With his head spinning and heart racing, he licks into Sherlock's mouth, learning his taste, make it his only. It takes a sharp thrust of Sherlock hips and their erections brushing more firmly for John's mind to come back online, and with a reluctant sigh, he slows down the pace of their kiss until he can pull away softly.
I’m listening
“We are,” John says, almost defensively, and immediately regrets it.
“How am I supposed to know that?”
Lestrade nods, "And Sherlock told you about the case?"
“I think so, yes,” Sherlock replies, eyes searching now.
“Now,” he gasps after a while. “Move now.”
John rolls to his back, eyes now fixed on the ceiling.
09:36
XX32: …
“Yes.”
I’m sorry.
“No,” Sherlock says, shaking his head. “Bedroom.” John looks just a bit alarmed at this, frowning and about to say something but Sherlock smiles, “I want to lie down next to you and be able to hold you, please.”
Yeah, that’ll be perfect.
Sherlock is stopped by two large hand sliding around his waist, a heavy breathing echoing in his ear. The man, tall, smelling of beer and smoke, purrs into his ear, “Don’t you look gorgeous.”
“Yes,” John pants, Sherlock glancing up to find his eyes closed, mouth hanging open.
Just need to stay still, fall asleep scared.
Pauline.
“Come on, Sherlock, for old time sake,” Victor continues to insist.
“I’ve been to Paris once,” John continues, “but never to Province.”
“Perfect,” John says. “And do you know how a good date usually ends?”
From the moment you announced it to the moment where I walked away from it all.
Sherlock kisses at his neck, slowly, tentatively, and John’s entire body shivers. His own pleasure is being shattered into million pieces, months and months of dreaming of
: 3:58
Pauline.
The both of them are still on the floor, Timothy cearly not yet processing that his friend is actually here and Quentin yelling louder and louder. The scene could have almost been funny if not so heartbreaking.
Well, he really couldn’t deny that he also wanted to stretch that beautiful, long body out on the bed in their room and find out just what it took to make Sherlock writhe and moan and beg. Would he trash his head around or just bend it back, stretching that pale neck impossibly taut? Did he prefer gentle, teasing touches or hard, bruising ones? John licked his lips at the thought of leaving a mark on the alabaster skin. There was so much he wanted to do that he feared the one night he might get wouldn’t be enough.
"Your turn," Sherlock finally says, having apparently taken back control, or doing a good job of pretending to.
"You want to talk," Sherlock declares.
“Not my thing” Sherlock’s voice came from the bed, a bit fainter than John had expected so he turned around. The sight that hit him left him grinning and pulling an eyebrow up.
I should stop here, should never even give you this.
“No,” he protests the second John pulls away, and doesn’t give him the time to say anything before chasing back his mouth in a demanding kiss. He’s the one to part John’s lips this time, keeping both hands in his hair to make sure he won’t try to escape again. John is smiling, and Sherlock marvels at the mere possibilities of tasting that smile, of making it his in every sense of the word.
“Sir, I-”
“John,” Sherlock moans, hands sliding from John’s neck to his back, shaking.
"Careful," Sherlock hisses, glancing at the bathroom door. "Matt is going to hear you."
"Your well being and happiness have always been my concern, brother mine."
“No,” John replies, shaking his head with a smile. “But I want to make sure you know that you can still change yours.”
John hesitates, not exactly sure what to say next, what there is even to say at all. He looks down at his hands, teeth worrying at his lower lip as the words Horsen spook on a loop inside his head. "Sherlock," he whispers, "Horsen, did he..."
"Just to me," Sherlock replies with a smile, already getting Toby ready. "When I come back," he begins, looking down at his now free hand, "We could have that talk."
Down to it now, the third universe, or as John likes to call it, the Pool universe. You’ve probably already made the connection, so yes, in this universe, the pool incident is a decisive one. But from the beginning:
“Home.”
want me to grab
about it made me want
I promised you that I would tell you about each universe we exist in, and so I will. For the purpose of these letters, let’s established that my universe is the first one (which I’ll be talking about last), and yours the second. That leaves us with two more, and in this letter, I’m going to talk about the third universe. I’ll try to write down everything I would wish to know if I were in your place, and I apologize in advance if by the end of this letter, you feel like I forgot something important.
“John! Mind if I join?”
Sherlock's lips curl into a smile, "I was under the impression we weren't talking."
“Tell me about yourself then. What are you studying?”
John throws his head back, breathing in deeply and trying to regain some composure, “Both?”
His traitorous mind couldn’t switch off for too long though. Shortly after he had settled in to wait for the boarding to begin, he already started thinking of what lay ahead of him. When he had left for the war, all his belongings had gone into storage. There was no way he could afford to keep a flat in London when he wasn’t even living there most of the time. So his two weeks of leave would be spent at his sister’s. Harry was probably nice, in the overall sense. They used to have the usual sibling rivalry which had died down a bit with age. In its place they adapted accusations of betrayal, when Harry had realised John was going to ship out with the army, and general concern about his sister’s alcohol problem. She would never call it that but John had watched it getting worse and worse with each year. Their infrequent E-mails really didn’t give him a good point of reference but he was prepared for the worst. At least with this flight he would still get home on Christmas Eve, already looking forward to the luxury of sleeping in on Christmas morning.
John takes his time, and Sherlock loves him, loves him to a point where he can’t take his eyes off him, can’t look away from his focused, concerned face as he thrusts one, two, three fingers in ever so slowly. Sherlock loves him, and thinks this could probably destroy him, could break him apart and shatter him whole. But suddenly there is John lowering himself on top of him again, pushing inside him with something so very bright shining in his eyes, and Sherlock loves him, loves him, loves him.
Sherlock shakes his head, his heart on his lips and his entire body getting used to this crushing feeling of
“You’ll like it,” Sherlock replies.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, not sure he can. And good if John thinks he’s mad or regretting or just doesn’t care. Anything to have him react, to have him snuggle close again and demand that they talk about what they just did. But silence stretches again, and Sherlock counts the minutes until he can hear John’s breathing easing out and feels his entire body relaxing. Only then does he turn to his side again, staring for as long as he can before retreating to the safety of his own head.
Sherlock nods, looking as if he's about to say something more, but sighing instead. "I'll be back soon."
“An experiment gone wrong, his mattress is useless so I offered mine.”
Lestrade raises one eyebrow but doesn't say anything, taking off his coat before saying, "Horsen is in room four, let's go."
“I know how it works John. I already have a plan: catch the man and give him to the german authorities. They’re looking for him like every other police in Europe.”
Sherlock is standing between their chairs when he gets downstairs, playing his violin with eyes closed and his head lightly thrown back. He doesn’t acknowledge John’s presence except for some high notes following him all the way to the kitchen. The clock announces John it is no longer time for breakfast, and so he sets up for making them both some brunch. The violin doesn’t stop for the next forty minutes, melodies after melodies. John picks up on three of his favorite ones, humming along while frying toast and chopping tomatoes. By the time he’s done setting the table, the violin ends, Sherlock walking to the kitchen, tall, smiling, breathtakingly beautiful.
Driving now. I’ll be
“Wait.”
He would love to know what was currently running through the student’s mind. John felt like Sherlock’s brain was working in marvellous but mystifying ways. Given the time he was sure the other could come up with the most amazing things, especially since he seemed to effortlessly read every fact ever from anyone within a few seconds of meeting them. His mind had gotten a bit carried away and it took a few moments for John to realise their suspect had gotten out of the bathroom again and was now taking off through the airport.
John’s heart grows a little bigger, “Oh, well, nevermind. Let’s do it again, properly this time.”
“Yes.” Sherlock agreed and they both entered the restaurant, choosing a table not too far from their suspect. “Sit in front of me.” Sherlock ordered John, the doctor complying without question.
Sherlock inhales deeply before meeting John's eyes again, "It's my favorite picture of the two of you."
It felt bloody awful, and
He all but flees the room, eyes locked to the floor and speeding up once out of sight. Taking the stairs two by two as silently as he can, John flies the door open, taking a quick look around. First, the clothes on the chair, making sure it’s folded and somewhat clean. Then, the wardrobe, closed and with no peek at anything too personal. Finally, the bed. He tugs on the sheets, flattens the cover, rearranges the pillow. It only occurs to him, with Sherlock’s footstep getting closer, that his genius of a friend might actually deduce everything he just did.
Sherlock doesn’t tell him he has no idea what feeling like a teenager is supposed to mean, and forces himself to look away from John’s lips as he says, “You were the first one to react like that to one of my deductions.”
John takes one last step toward him, his answer being breathed directly against Sherlock’s lips. “Then we can’t prove your research wrong, can we?”
Also show you the case
“Whenever you need to, love.”
"I love you," John breathes. "God, I love you."
09:35
John groaned as the the words registered in his head. So much for coming home early. Luckily this was his last flight and he wasn’t one of the poor people having to scramble for connection flights in Heathrow. All this meant for him was waiting a bit more. One thing the army prepared you very well for was waiting. Waiting was what you usually did in Afghanistan. There was way too much of it for John’s liking and it wore your nerves thinner than any gun fight. Anyway, it prepared you for sitting around still in an airport, waiting for the snow storm to die down enough for the airlines to dare flying again. John just rested his head against the back of his seat, having slumped down a bit to get more comfortable and prepared himself for an indefinite amount of time of listening to the same ten Christmas songs on a loop.
“There were times when I was certain we would never have this again,” Sherlock whispers, not sure if he actually meant to speak his thoughts but finding he does not mind.
Thank you so much for your patience with this story, for all the kudos and comments. I am so glad to have finally finished it, and I hope you enjoyed the journey as much as I did.
XX67: (
“The local DI gives me cold ones,” Sherlock replies, starting to eat.
John laughed but removed his fingers. “Sure your majesty.” With a long arm he grappled for the condom, managing just to get it out of its packaging and onto himself. He couldn’t help but moan loudly when he felt his hand around him, smiling when he heard Sherlock gaps underneath him. Until now he had been so concentrated on Sherlock’s pleasure that he hadn’t realised how achingly hard his own cock was. It took him a short moment of contemplation to figure out how he wanted to do it before he gripped Sherlock securely around the waist and flipped them.
“Pardon me, but it’s getting rather late,” one of the hotel staff intervened, “we are closing this area for the night.”
Sherlock lets go of his hand immediately, his entire body tensing as he turns to face him, “You’ve changed your mind.”
“That was a lifetime ago,” John murmurs, not meeting his eyes. “So much happened in between. We’ve hurt each other in so many ways. I broke you, Sherlock. I used a morning suit and a waltz, and hurt you.”
Lestrade glances at the phone, “Sorry, scrolled past it. Here it is!”
“Well, we just need to create one and then, you reply to him.” Another laugh escapes him, and Sherlock is fairly sure he’s laughing at him this time. “You know what, let me do this.”
John stops just the time to bring the spatula to his mouth, tasting the eggs and hissing out loud. “Oh, hot!” Sherlock shakes his head fondly, wondering when exactly this became his routine, and how lucky he is for this to be his routine in the first place.
John waves at him, waiting until the boy disappears before saying, “He wants to be your friend.” Sherlock smiles, not saying anything, and John looks back him. “You always had a way with kids, did you notice?”
Here's the third chapter a little sooner than planned, enjoy :)
“We catch him. Obviously.”
"I..." Sherlock starts, tongue darting out to wet his lower lip. "No, I didn't notice I did."
“I enjoyed it as well,” I reply, uncertain of what is expected of me.
Arnold looks at him for a long moment before extending a hand, "Come on," he says, nodding toward the dance floor. "I'll show you."
“Does it mean we’ll do this next year too?”
John’s body shakes with laughter as he pulls away just enough to look down at him, a single tear rolling down to the corner of his lips, stretched into a bright smile, “Then I think it’s only fair if I tell you I would have loved to wake up on that sofa with your body next to mine. Just like I would have laughed again and again with each kiss you’d given me. Just like I would have welcomed you into my arms on that chair, like I’ve imagined too many times.” Moving one hand from his hair to his cheek, John slowly strokes his lower lip, “Because you see, Sherlock Holmes, I’ve been in love with you for what seems like a small eternity already, and I’m afraid I might combust any second now.”
felt for anyone before.
“Not sure he’s even heard about you, sorry,” he replies.
At the first sound of sirens making their way towards them, John forces Horsen up to his feet, backing him against the wall. "Don't try anything stupid," he warns. "It would only make me too happy to hit you."
Sherlock truly hopes he isn’t blushing as John’s eyes focus on him only, and he replies quickly, “I’ll have to study the scene, or at least have pictures.”
Sherlock’s voice is breaking as he says, “I can’t do this,” and John feels his world crashing down once more.
Violet, already too focused on Rosie, walks back to the house. John waits until she’s inside before saying, “Are you certain we don’t need to talk about all this?”
“You’re smiling,” Sherlock says into the kiss, his own lips curled into a smile.
This email was supposed to be about the decision I made while reading the letter a thousand times, so I’m going to stop rambling and get down to it: I don’t care what these two other versions of ourselves want, I’m going to tell you about what’s in those letters.
XX67: Each letter is a lot to take in.
Can’t promise anything.
In the end, it only takes a hour for Sherlock to reduce the list of suspects to two names only, having only three good enough pictures to help him. John spends the entire time walking between the kitchen and the garden table, taking the time to look at one of the pictures when Sherlock asks him, leaning over his shoulder for long minutes. Montgomery, smoking cigarette after cigarette, ends up staying until after one. Sherlock tries his best to remain focused on the conversation, John answering all of Montgomery's questions patiently. But there is John’s foot brushing his under the table each time he moves, and Sherlock finds he’d rather focus on that instead.
XX67: If it reassures you, I can’t either.
“Dress up quickly, we have to go.”
"Christ, Sherlock, I..." John sighs.
In the end, John decided on a plain chocolate bar because he had gotten fed up with looking at what should have been real food but didn’t quite manage to pass as that. While strolling through the airport, since there was no use in getting back to the gate, he saw a figure out of the corner of his eye fiddling with one of the doors that clearly wasn’t meant to be used by passengers. He turned and quickly walked over to the stranger, using his authoritative voice he asked, “Hey, what are you doing there?”
It only takes Sherlock fifteen minutes to get to Bart’s, which he spent not thinking about how his next actions might upset his world entirely. He made up his mind the moment he chose to reply to John’s message, and he can’t possibly back up now. It doesn’t matter that he has no idea what he’s supposed to do, or that relationships had always seemed too messy to even consider it. John Watson had kissed him two days ago, and Sherlock wants nothing more but have him pressed against him once more.
“You said you wanted me,” Sherlock pants, rolling his hips ever so lightly.
“John,” Victor whispers as soon as Sherlock walks out of the room. “There’s something I wanted to ask you.”
And yet.
Sherlock spends the day sulking, the lack of a good case for the past week making even breathing unbearable. John doesn’t say anything. He cooks them lunch and eats alone, glancing at Sherlock’ figure on the sofa. He busies himself all afternoon, reading forty pages of his book, saving two drafts on his blog and changing their sheets to the deep navy ones.
"You can't stay," Sherlock exclaims, not giving him the chance to find an end to his sentence anyway.
I’ll have it ready by
Hi everyone,
Sherlock shrugs, moving ever closer. John inhales deeply, eyes falling to Sherlock’s lips. Both of their rapid breathing are echoing in the room. John uses his free hand to stroke up Sherlock’s arm, shoulder and neck, settling against his nape and pulling just a little.
"I don't want to move," Sherlock replies, his face finding the crook of John's neck away. "You can ask. I can’t promise I’ll have the answers."
Sherlock watches her climb the stairs quickly, barely hiding her smile, and he can’t help but laugh, shaking his head.
“I’m afraid I don’t. I’m afraid there are still parts of you, of your past that I can’t reach.”
The time the detective spent bend over tables and squinting at multiple screens, John took to observe the remarkable man a bit more. There was no way he would gather even half of the information Sherlock had seemingly pulled out of his sleeve about himself, but a few things still could be learned. For example, it was hard to miss the way Sherlock’s muscles shifted under the perhaps slightly too tight trousers or how the shirt was being stretched so much across his back that John was already worried a bit. He really had run into not only a genius but one that seemed to be trapped in a model’s body. The soldier bit his lower lip, trying to steer his thoughts away from the murky waters they were getting too close to. They were breaking multiple laws at the moment to hunt for someone who was doing the same. There was no time for sexual fantasies.
) Then what the fuck was that email about?
“There’s something I’d like to do,” he says after.
“Of course you didn’t,” John replies, sounding amused now. “You should get to bed, try to warm up.”
We’ll wait there, yes.
s.holmes@thescienceofdeduction.co.uk
"Better go meet her," Sherlock declares, already pulling away.
“Yes,” John says, laugh lines around his eyes and the remainder of a blush on his cheeks. “Too much of a challenge?”
Sherlock turns to his side, eyes burning John’s skin in the dark.
Yeah, ok, I’ll
And just like that, Sherlock realises John is practically naked in that bed.
“I just need a minute,” Sherlock says, sounding apologetic.
“And now?”
“Of course we are,” John replies, looking back up sharply at him. “You know perfectly well you’re my best fri-”
"Hmm," John nods, eyes fluttering closed and Sherlock follows his example. They remain still for a small eternity, the prospect of all that might happen now making it hard to focus, but Sherlock forces himself to register the exact feeling of John's breath against his lips, so very warm.
He catches Sherlock's eyes and they remain silent for a long moment, simply staring at each other until Sherlock remembers he's supposed to be driving. John realises he's still smiling as he himself look back at the road, and despite the doubts filling his head about the entire trip, he strangely feels himself relax into his seat. Yes, Sherlock's parents are going to expect them to act a certain way around each other, but John couldn't care less. This could be an opportunity, he thinks. A chance to make Sherlock understand that they could be brilliant together, a chance to show him that he never wants to go again, a way to tell him just for how long he had been hoping for the three of them to become a real family.
Sherlock nods, a lump in his throat, and he closes his eyes to regain some composure. John laughs again, quietly, and he places their hands on his leg, squeezing. Keeping his eyes shut, Sherlock waits only a second before dropping his head back on John’s shoulder, breathing him in. Time seems to have sped up, the cab already stopping at Baker Street and all too soon, they’re out again. John fumbles with his keys, his right hand still in Sherlock’s, but he gets the door open and they’re climbing the stairs up to the flat rather quickly. Sherlock is laughing too when they finally find themselves standing in the middle of their living room.
"There's this place I always thought you'd like not very far away," Sherlock replies, looking back at him with such softness that it makes John's heart beat just a little faster.
a lot more than today.
“I’m sure you’ll find the way out,” Sherlock says, Lestrade grinning at him again. “Don’t bother locking the door.”
“Oh come on,” Lestrade cuts him off again, throwing both hands in the air. “This John manages to make thousand of people look for you, and you’re just going to ignore it?”
John's hand tightens around the phone, "Did you do a background check?"
Sherlock goes from frowning to opening his eyes wide in a second, blushing, and all John can think is how beautiful he is right now. “How can they…” Sherlock begins before frowning again.
XX32: Sherlock? Everything’s alright?
“I don’t like that he likes you,” he finally says. “I don’t like that he had dinner with you tonight.”
Sherlock remembers to breathe, his exhale echoing in the room as John’s eyes don’t leave his. He should be saying something, should reciprocate, should tell him he would have loved nothing more but to kiss him too. He should tell him that it was all he could think about afterward, wondering if kissing him through his orgasm would have made it even better; should tell him that thoughts of his lips followed him all the way to his dreams. But in the end, “John,” is the only sound he manages to let out, weak and uncertain.
I also enjoyed this evening
“Sure about that?”
part, but every time I tried to, something held me back. I can’t exactly say what is it in this letter, I’m not sure I could find the right words to do so anyway.
“Sure, yes,” he murmurs, more to himself than anyone else.
"Why did you dance with that man?" Sherlock counters immediately.
"I promise he is, dear," Mrs Hudson assures him once again. "It's just that he asked not to be disturbed and I'm not sure he'll be pleased to-"
should be in a good mood before
“Don’t,” Sherlock cuts him off, an ache spreading throughout his chest.
XX67: It’s alright, John.
But as he looks down at the set of new journals on his lap, the ones John had carefully wrapped, Sherlock can’t help but wish he could go back in time and relive the past few hours again, even just once, even just to watch John’s face as he opened his present again. One finger stroking the cover of the red journal absently, he allows himself to glance back at him, just one more time. He’s been casting him shy looks all evening, and surely John is going to notice at some point. It’s not as if it was easy not to, especially with the way John dressed for the night. Everything about his clothing screamed careful preparation, and Sherlock hadn’t been able to stop wondering how long it had taken John to pick each piece of clothing for tonight. God knows he had thought about his own for hours, finally going for the blue shirt seemed to like so much lately. Obviously, having spent most of the evening much closer than usual hadn’t made it easier either. They’d remained in their chairs or the kitchen table the entire time, but even there, Sherlock is certain the space between their chairs have shrunk as the minutes ticked by.
John threads both hands inside Sherlock's curls, crashing their mouths together again. He doesn't stop until he's fully inside him, and even then, neither of them has managed to remember how to breathe again.
And Sherlock doesn’t want to hear it, doesn’t want to listen to excuses for what they’re about to. He shakes his head, staring down at John’s hand still pressed on his chest, and takes a deep breath, “Continue.”
Sherlock shakes his head, "At the club, I was acting high on adrenaline. I didn't think, didn't question what I was doing. We were kissing and suddenly I needed to be the one against that door, to be entirely surrounded by you. Like you explained yourself. I just acted."
Sherlock closes his eyes, heart sinking.
John was tired. I could read it all over him. He barely met my eyes for the entire time we were together, but it didn’t matter. I could see the exhaustion in his movements, in the lines around his eyes, in the tone of his voice.
“Is that alright?”
. Sherlock grabbed his key card and was out of the room in less than a minute. He was going to find John and let him decide for the both of them. For once Sherlock was going to relinquish the control to someone else.
“Kind of helped,” John corrects him.
XX32: No, no. It’s just that… (
Sherlock actually sighs this time, taking another sip of his drink and ignoring the amused smile on Lestrade’s lips. Of course he had noticed the recently invalided home, tanned, limping man who hasn’t stopped glancing at him ever since they entered the pub, but it doesn’t matter that he wants to go over there and let himself deduce all there is to know about him. They are here to catch Miller, prove he’s been targeting gay couples in three different Pride celebrations already, and then he could go home and forget about the glitter, and laughter, and this incomprehensible need to let himself
“Should I turn off the lights?” Sherlock asks.
"He didn't," Sherlock says, "or else he wouldn't have agreed to leave when I suggested it."
13:15
“I fact,” John continues, apparently oblivious to Sherlock’s inner struggle, “I’ll love nothing more but to slip under the covers with you right now.”
Sherlock watches silently as Lestrade’s fingers begin to type on his phone quickly. He stares and can’t help but recite the words he already knows by heart in his head. John, after just one kiss, had been looking for him all over the Internet, trying to find him again. It could only mean he had liked the kiss just as much, that maybe he hadn’t been able to think about anything else since, and for a moment, Sherlock feels better about it all. It can only mean it’ll be alright, that John has done this before and he’ll know what to do next, he could guide him, guide them both and there’s a chance Sherlock could pretend he knows what he’s doing too.
I'm not sure when I've started to give up, when I resigned myself and stopped waiting for my dad to actually do something, but seeing the two of them exit the cab hand in hand makes me want to both scream and cry at the same time. Not that I can do either now, Dad would freak out and spent the entire week end worrying over me. And since I'm fairly sure I've already interrupted something just by coming here, the least I can do is make sure I don't ruin anything else.
John wakes up with a startle, heart pounding with every loud “No” coming from downstairs. A quick glance at his nightstand - 03:08 - and he’s out and rushing downstairs. The living room is dark, the kitchen even darker and he directly heads for Sherlock’s bedroom, getting ready for anything that might be happening in there.
Sherlock lets one last worry slip out, "Isn't it too late?"
I know. I’m sorry.
"Oh," John breathes, seeming to consider the question for a moment. "Well, there was that first night we spent together. If I'm being honest with myself, I thought about kissing you a dozen times that night."
John notes the added pajamas shirt with both rellief and regret, but looks away before betraying himself.
Some more important facts,
This chapter hasn't been betaed yet.
So, to the question you asked that very first evening and that I never actually answered, yes, I am sexually attracted to men only. And to the question you asked that night - you know which one - yes, I am what Mycroft called me: a virgin.
blue : personal investigations (a bit unsure about that) => yes, a brand new journal just for the parallel universes
Sherlock just hastily nodded and turned back to his book. There was no way for John to miss the blush creeping over the other’s cheeks since it was a deep crimson red. Apparently his worries were for nothing. He might not get Sherlock down to the party but at least he would know where to find the boy afterwards. Suddenly he didn’t feel like putting on a shirt at all but even an idiot, and really Sherlock was far from being one, could guess what his game was. Pulling the t-shirt over his head took deliberately longer than usual and he could just catch Sherlock’s head turning away again, as he peaked out of the collar. He hoped he would get some more time to tease the other when he came back.
Sherlock gets to his feet, not sure how exactly, and follows John toward his bedroom still lost inside his own head. It could be so simple, he just has to ask John, to tell him this is the most logical option, and with one or two scientific facts, John could only agree. He only has to ask. Just ask.
John climbs the first step, waiting until he hears the door closing, and breathing deeply. There is no backing out now, and whatever happens once he joins Sherlock, he's ready to face it. The flat is deeply silent when he enters the sitting room, and it only takes a second to guess that Sherlock must have gone directly to his chair and not moved since. He doesn't say a word either as John sits in his own chair, relieving in the familiar warmth, and dares to look up at Sherlock's face.
Actually, a great deal of facts about myself made me fear you’d leave. Drugs used to be first on the list but I also used to believe that my lack of interest in the most common things would drive you away. I know you’re probably thinking I’m an idiot, but I also know it drove you mad in the past, realising how little I cared about it all. And if I learned to pay more attention now, there are still areas that are completely unknown to me, a grown man. The most basic things, ones that I know for sure you never truly understood how I could just not care about. So right now I want to talk about the most obvious one (which you’ve been wondering about for years): sex.
Sherlock is the one to walk out of the room first, their hands brushing as he passes next to him and John has to repress a shiver. "I'll go get your room ready," he declares.
(020) XXXX XX67
“What we were doing was good,” Sherlock says, tongue darting out to wet his lips - and torment John. “More than good.”
“She had been trying to sell it for years, after moving to Chicago, and I remembered her mentioning it once when I started looking for something myself,” Sherlock adds, taking a turn left and John follows, a thousand questions on the tip of his tongue.
Sherlock watches, breathing heavily, as John rubs a hand over his face, shaking. He needs to move, needs to go before he says anything else that might damage what’s left of them for good.
"Right," John smiles, having now guessed from Sherlock's fantasies that the discovery of each other is important. "Go ahead."
Sherlock considers the DI’s words for a second, his mind blank and his heart beating just a little too fast. He looks down at the phone, still in Lestrade’s hand, and finds himself thinking about John. Is he staring at his own phone, waiting for him to reply? Lestrade starts to type, making him jump, “What are you doing?”
“Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock.”
Sherlock jumps in surprise, looking up sharply to find John staring back at him.
John faces him again, “From the moment I met you, Sherlock, you have been so brilliant, so clever, so bloody beautiful, and even when I dared to think that maybe, maybe, you felt just as desperate for more as I did, I couldn’t let myself believe that I could ever be enough for you.”
“I think I’ll need a few drinks myself” John admits, trying to shove his hands into his pockets and finding them unable to fit.
“What exactly do you mean to do upon finding him?” Mycroft enquires, unphased by John’s silence.
Silence grows between them for a few moments. Sherlock can almost hear John’s brain working, sorting through the files in his head to find words that are appropriate yet strong, guarding the things he really wants to say, close to his chest.
Sherlock lets his head loll back a bit. Despite the awkward angle his muscles are beginning to relax against John’s pressing lips, travelling softly over the length of his neck and the small space below his ear. It’s pleasant and warm in his belly, the heat of John’s mouth a welcome comfort on his skin. The wet cotton is beginning to feel a little tight over his groin so Sherlock reaches down to adjust it, but before he can, John has both of his wrists encircled. The grip is tight as his hands are moved to the edges of the bathtub.
“John –”
“Well let’s just do it ourselves then”
John doesn’t get chance for the moral debate he’d planned to have with himself before knocking on the door because it’s wide open. He steps in and feels the warmth of the place thaw his breath and fingers. The lights are off in the sitting room but he can see a low glow from the kitchen, an Edward Hopper interior of deep shadow and dark corners. His chair is there, watching him from the far side of the room and exactly opposite Sherlock’s again, empty and expectant. Taking slow steps as if he shouldn’t be there, he finds Sherlock at the table, lit by the solitary light of his laptop and surrounded not in the map to John’s mind, but haphazard piles of papers and a lonely lit Bunsen in the centre.
John watches him glide into to the kitchen and begins flicking through the channels on the small LCD he’d set up a few weeks ago, mostly so Rosie could watch cartoons. There’s not a lot on at such a late hour, anything showing after eleven seems to be a re-run, and he quickly skips over an old Connie Price repeat.
The bathroom is steaming up around them. John indulges in the friction for a moment more, then noses Sherlock’s face up, gestures to the hot running water next to them. They climb in, awkwardly. John catches his shin on the side of the tub but it’s just another bruise, another bit of damage they can start to undo now.
, he types. His reflection looks back at him with disdain. John holds his thumb down until the words disappear again.
John’s pulling Sherlock off his knees and onto the armchair before he’s even really thought about it, the muscles wake in his arms and he finds strength enough to manoeuvre the man; until there are knees sliding and digging into the chair either side of John’s thighs, and long arms braced on the back of it, an awkward mess of too many limbs and not enough space or air to even breathe.
The sheets rustle slightly as Sherlock hears John slide his way down to meet him at the bottom of the bed. He sits so close that their knees bump, rubbing his head absentmindedly where it smashed into solid wall.
“All this fucking time” John says into Sherlock’s mouth, the hand between his legs quickly bringing him to the inevitable edge.
“You’re still in one piece”
There’s mud in John’s hair and it seems wrong, so Sherlock picks it out with two fingers, his other hand firmly pressed to the ebbing wound, like it has been for the past four minutes twenty-eight seconds, (“pressure, Sherlock, I need pressure”), and he is so useless, so utterly
He could be forgiven for completely forgetting about their imminent rescue, but the pair will indeed be on the way by now. Sherlock rolls his eyes and groans, reluctantly reaching for his trousers in a pile at the bottom of the bed. John tosses his red silk shirt over from the floor, pulling on his jeans with a grin Sherlock finds himself reflecting.
The next time Sherlock’s eyes open, time has righted itself and the room isn’t blinding anymore, just dull and grey with rain battering the windows.
“Fast,” Sherlock begins. “He was – fast. Always running ahead of me, I think – I could never keep up”
The man’s attempt at levity in their current circumstances is welcome, and Sherlock manages to grin back. A waiter comes their way and John yet again takes the initiative in ordering their drinks, asking for whisky this time. When the glasses arrive at their table, John doesn’t down it in one as predicted, but rather seems to use it as a shield, sipping intermittently whilst avoiding the show going on just feet away from their table.
The upper hand is so often his in every situation, always the leader and never out of his depth. Yet the entire night he’s been following John’s forward thinking, physically and figuratively one step behind him at all times. More than that, Sherlock has found himself not minding this role reversal at all, the manageable danger of letting John take charge is intoxicating.
“You need more pain relief” John comments, slipping off the bed and out of the door before Sherlock has chance to protest.
When Sherlock first wakes, he is in the wrong place. A ventilator breathes next to him, pushing oxygen in and out of his lungs with painful precision. The hospital room is so bright he can’t see, but he can feel Mary, smell her perfume as she pleads with him. No, tells him. Demands things of Sherlock that he is not capable of. Time has slipped, repeating the mistakes of his past in a terrifying haze.
All he wants to do is get in, shrug off his coat, loosen his shirt collar and stare at the small metal box hidden beneath the bathroom floorboards. Undo the latch maybe, take out the contents one by one one, and wonder. And pretend. Drown out the last hour of talking about his sister and his relationships and his apparent messiah complex.
It’s only then that John hears the shallow
Three days of nothing. The longest they have been apart for over a year, and consequently the most amount of time he and Rosie have spent at their own house. The first night had been fine. They’d both been exhausted from dealing with Harry, and sleep had come as soon as John’s head hit the pillow. But the second night –
The hunger he sees consuming John’s face makes Sherlock tremble. To be fervently wanted in such a brazen way makes him moan again, both apprehensive and desperate for whatever is coming next. John kisses him deep and slow, with a care Sherlock cannot put words to. With the basic coordination he can manage, Sherlock pushes himself up into a half-seated position, back slumped against the satin pillows. Then his wrists are being guided upwards, John slipping his left hand first into the metal restraint, followed by the right, pressing kisses to his mouth in between.
John wordlessly agrees, nods his head once, slowly loosening his grip on the wrist and shirt held so tightly in his fingers. Already the defences are reforming, the cold edges icing back into John’s eyes, chin and mouth both setting into tight lines of control. The soldier in him is ever present, able to snap back into the moment and do what is needed without hesitation.
These weeks go by the slowest, as if everything is trying to progress but it only knows how to pause. There are cases, and sometimes Sherlock goes alone, like back in the day when each night would end in three hours of lost memory because there was no one to hear his stories. When John appears, he has dark pewter skin under his eyes and his hair is so slicked back it looks mechanical. It’s almost as if he isn’t there, and Sherlock sometimes wishes he wasn’t.
“Right, of course he did” John says blankly, not really knowing what to do with that information.
He can’t quite bring himself to remove the ruined leather and check. Not just yet.
Desolation blooms and wanes across John’s face, but soon he’s the soldier again. Heavy eyelids blink away the wet pooling there. He sniffs and lifts his chin away. Suddenly Sherlock feels vulnerable and alone, takes a few steps back while he still has the muscle memory to move.
The man finally voices, looks up and he remembers late nights and barely-mornings; half eaten takeaways and bad coffees in an otherworldly time, calm short moments where Sherlock would sleep rigid in his chair and John would watch and marvel at the gift he’d been given.
So they do, Sherlock following John yet again along the perimeter of the room, their hands clasped tight. They shadow the gambler along a dark corridor at the back of the building, passing doors framed with more velvet curtains, clearly private rooms for hire. The place seems to be deserted but they carry on, picking up their pace as they chase after their suspect. As they round the next corner, the man is there, just about to enter one of the rooms only feet away.
The sudden emptiness is palpable. The heaviness of Sherlock’s body on his own had been an anchor, and now John’s being carried off by the current, dragged away from Sherlock against his will. Darkness begins to filter out the furniture and features of the living room until John can barely see. He scrubs hands over his face trying to find oxygen, but it doesn’t come in the claustrophobic nothingness, so he grabs his jacket and heads for the stairs while he can still manage them.
There are indeed grapes, sitting there useless on the side table next to John’s cardboard cup. Cards too, and flowers, the petals browning from age. He’s been here for a week at least, then. The stubble on John’s chin confirms this as he leans forward in his chair, scrubbing both hands over his worn face. The circles under his friend’s eyes betray lack of sleep, the red veins creeping into his whites illustrating days of anguish.
John has no fucking clue what’s going on anymore.
“You’re so good Sherlock, Jesus – “
They are both soaked through and angry on one of the times when it isn’t okay.
He has never been good at this. Has never been able to say or do the right thing to save the person he loves. Not when it really matters.
Sherlock says, doesn’t wait for an answer and his voice is rough and so far past low that John barely hears it anyway. Only knows that his hand is taken and cradled in a slightly larger one and then he’s circling Sherlock’s cock, surreal and heavy and they’re both moving together, constantly in every shadow of space until close is no longer a choice but a necessity, until John’s trying to both push himself into Sherlock’s hold and grind into his hip, not enough and far too much.
.) “he was alive all along, up there, just - just watching, stuck in the sky with the stars instead of back on earth with -
“You’re not saving me from punishment, you’re just punishing yourself”
hear them -
“Not exactly the dramatic ending I had in mind” John tries for sarcasm, eyes trying to seek out Sherlock’s own in the vacuum around them.
“I’m sorry if I went too far, earlier” John’s tongue follows his words against his own bottom lip, the depths of his eyes betraying the insincerity behind them.
John squeezes his hand, just once, and then moves away. The space around Sherlock is suddenly lacking, desolate like the plains of his mind after the onslaught of sensation. Still rooted to the spot he stays silent, as the other man picks up his mug and goes back to the kitchen, as if nothing has happened. Sherlock hears a rustle of plastic and a metallic twang as John puts bread in the toaster, can do nothing for an entire minute until he builds up enough courage to head to the shower.
“Wow,” John says, mocking surprise as he looks across at him. “Sherlock Holmes, admitting he can’t do something”
“Shower,” Sherlock says, contrary to the hand still palming and stroking over John’s boxers. “We should shower”
They’d managed to keep conversation light, recounting a few choice adventures from the year to a captive audience. Sherlock had even bought a couple of beers himself, and the concerned look he’d been giving John intermittently for the last twelve months seemed to melt away with every mouthful. It felt a little bit like the old days, for a while there. Staring at Sherlock’s animated face while he rattled off amazing and seemingly obvious deductions, being the Boswell sidekick instead of the sad eyed widow.
Just as he’s realising he may indeed be that unlucky victim, twigs snap behind him. John spins around, but only inky black and imposing firs greet him. He swallows and reminds himself that the security cabin isn’t far away and he has his phone, there’s no real way he’s going to get knocked off by a serial killer who stalks Christmas tree farms. Somehow those thoughts aren’t that comforting. They’ve been to weirder cases, after all.
John looks, combs the fringe off his own face and then reaches the same hand to Sherlock’s cock. Pulls him forwards gently out of the stream of water and watches Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed. Sees the breath hitch in his throat and release again through parted lips, as the day swirls away down the drain.
The arms stretched above Sherlock’s head go limp, as he allows his muscles to relax. Feelings peak and fade as he breathes, the weight of John slumped and spent against his chest something he doesn’t yet want to lose.
There are only two boxes and a suitcase of children’s clothes to begin with. John brings his stuff over in dribs and drabs, the essentials first and then the few trivial things he decides are worthy of keeping. One box is marked private, so Sherlock stays away from it because he knows the contents would only hurt. He circles it in the flat as if it is a bomb, ready to go off at any moment.
“Sherlock used to follow the local shepherd around as a boy, wrangling the sheep” She continues, smiling fondly at the memory. “We think he just wanted some friends, really”
“You’d be surprised” John says, raising an eyebrow at the black and white print in his lap.
“Okay,” John says, the slight edge to his voice betraying the lie in his words. “You’ll be fine, hang on. Let me just –“
“We need tea,” John hears from behind him as he makes his way up the stairs, Sherlock following for once, and tentatively; carefully slow paced steps and too steady breath, and that hand has migrated to the centre of his spine and
“Here, I need you to do this”
Lestrade asks John about the sale of the house when he drops by about a case, so Sherlock goes into the kitchen and closes his ears. He doesn’t want to know about the perfect family moving into John and Mary’s house, and he couldn’t care less about the specifics. The details aren’t for him. Some things are still John’s business alone, and though Sherlock could very easily find him a good solicitor and a better buyer, he doesn’t offer his help.
“As ever, Mycroft does not agree with my methods” Sherlock eventually answers, turning and rising from the floor. “Nor I, his”
“I’m sorry”
Somehow the evening passes them by quicker than John would have liked. Sherlock’s parents seem to enjoy the company of a tiny human, but are simultaneously wiped out by the energy only a toddler can have. They go off to bed and Rosie follows not soon after, taking the small spare bedroom upstairs. There’s room for John there too, and though sleep is tempting he treads carefully back downstairs, flicking the lights off as he goes.
“Quiet, I don’t want to alert the security guard”
“Faulty, somehow”
There are two bouncers and a crowd of sweating people between them and the door. John grabs Sherlock’s hand again, pulling him along before he has a chance to argue otherwise. Although really he’s thankful, happy to be led for once, in an environment he can’t quite navigate himself.
1983” Sherlock says, the foreign words dripping from his lips like honey.
Maybe it would be easier just to leave, Sherlock thinks. Yet they can’t, they only have this one chance to solve their case before their client’s excuses for the missing jewellery dry up. Before Sherlock has a chance to work out how he’s going to communicate to John that they need to appear intimate, the man is downing his drink again and turning to face him properly.
“Yes, Sherlock” John puts his lips to the shell of Sherlock’s ear and breathes into him, picks up the pace until he’s trembling. “For me, come on”
the life dribbling away through his doctor’s pores, giving up without so much as a goodbye (Sherlock said goodbye, he said it and he
Sherlock’s face softens, his frosty eyes sparkling for a moment. John swallows and looks down at his feet. This is his chance, to say all the things he should say, but the words are leaving him as quickly as the heat is leaving his fingers.
