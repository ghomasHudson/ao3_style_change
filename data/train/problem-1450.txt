“I’m fine with that.” John smirked.
"What do I do?" I ask, knowing that there isn't anything I can do.
“Best not to disturb him then. How are you, Molly?”
I shouldn't have had to find out that John was injured before his parents found out, but I did. At the scene, paramedics discovered his wallet and there was a picture of us two in it. On the back was my mobile number which I gave to him the first night we went out on a date together. As his phone was destroyed in the collision and that was the only number accessible, I was called. They didn't tell me the extent of his injuries or how severe they were, just that I needed to contact his parents and get to the hospital if possible.
"Hmm?"
“No one gave it to me-“
coping methods with grief and-“
"Don't die on me, James. Don't you fucking dare. Please don't."
“My brother here has decided to go back on the drugs. I’m sure you remember how he was the last time that happened.” He turned back to Sherlock. “Do you remember, Sherlock?”
You were fucking choking and I can't get that sound out of my head. I've tried so bloody hard to block those noises out, pretend like I can't hear them but they're always there and I can't get away from them. It was the most awful sound I had ever heard and I hate that it was one of the last things I heard from you.
Mrs Hudson shuffled closer on her seat. “How are you feeling?”
the facts when they're right in right of me. Every day you're changing. Struggling to breathe, collapsing, feeling exhausted. You've lost so much weight in the past six weeks, especially since you stopped attending uni."
“At least get yourself cleaned up if you don’t want to sit down. You’ve still got blood on your forehead.”
and then he realises where he is, recognises the grey walls that have mould growing in every corner, recognises the tattered mattress that he has called his bed for a considerable number of days. There is vomit on his shirt and blood on his arms and he remembers it all.
“Yes,” he says, his voice nonchalant. Sherlock’s hand has replaced his on the cloth and it’s now Sherlock who is in control. Sherlock has learned that it’s best if he does most of the talking in times like these, which is something he had to learn quickly in the past three weeks. John is not stable. He knows that.
I receive lots of cards on the day he is put to rest. From his friends, his colleagues. His fans. The people who read his blog about us. About our cases. About our memories.
Sherlock kneels on the bathroom floor beside Rosie who finds herself hunched over the toilet vomiting. He has one hand on the base of her back, supporting her body as she heaves again, and one hand wrapped loosely around her blonde curls, pulling them away from her face. John enters the doorway in just a baggy shirt and underwear with a glass of water in his hand, and sits down on the opposite side of Rosie. John rests his hand just above Sherlock’s and they sit there as Rosie finishes throwing up.
"Tonight." John whispered against Sherlock's ear, his warm breath ghosting over his skin.
Sirens followed shortly after.
Harry’s face adopted a distressed expression but she managed to pull herself together in an instant.
He presses his eyes closed when he feels the tears stinging them, willing himself not to cry, but he can’t. He feels them unrelenting and suddenly he’s sobbing, trying to figure out what went wrong.
John braces himself against the bench and breathes deeply, each exhale shaky as he tries to stop himself from crying like he did last night. A family walk out of the hospital together and it doesn’t take a genius to know that they have heard some bad news. What looks like a dad is hugging his two daughters, and a woman who must be in her late thirties stands to the side and lights a cigarette in the smoking zone. John hates it.
They go to the bedroom (Rosie had been in there since yesterday morning) to find Rosie fast asleep, clutching her teddy bear. Sherlock’s hand rests gently against the top of Rosie’s head and he’s kneeling on the floor, head propped at an awkward angle on the sheets, and he too is fast asleep.
“Oh, definitely not. There’s no fun in that. I think I’d rather like to be out there looking at the crime scenes.” They both pressed the cigarettes to their lips again. “John.”
, and he’s dragging John in through the threshold and into the living room, removing his coat as he goes before he gently presses his shoulders, encouraging him to sit on the sofa. John obliges. He doesn’t have a choice. The blood has seeped from his eyebrow and down across his cheek. His school shirt is splattered with drops of blood and his head stings so much. There is a throbbing that he can’t stop. He knows that it’s from the blood loss and he knows that he needs stitches but he doesn’t care right now.
"Don't," and he listens, retreating backwards so that he can sit down again. One of the beakers that I currently have an experiment in has been knocked over but I have no concern for that, not now. I stop hitting the table and sigh, calming down once again. My emotions are all over the place- one minute I am holding myself together, being strong, and then next the walls that I have so carefully constructed since I was a teeanger are being destructed, tumbling to the ground in a series of terrifying crashes and loud collisions. Closing my eyes, I inhale slowly.
"H-how did you know?" Inhaling, John pulled away and looked his mother in the eyes. The blue pools were glistening with water, which was reflected in John's own eyes as well. Not out of fear or sadness, purely for the reason that his mother accepted him.
The door to the ICU is slammed shut and the two of us are left outside in the corridor, wondering what the hell is going on. Stupidly I don't think of the possibilities of what could happen because
Sherlock wiped a hand under his nose and it came back with blood. He was injured but that was unimportant. John was the only person that mattered.
was all Sherlock needed to know that he could never be without John again, and that he wouldn’t ever
A tear trickled down John's cheek as he listened to Sherlock speak to him. He would have been lying if he had said that he wasn't afraid. He was bloody terrified. Standing up, Sherlock leaned over his blogger, gently pressing a kiss to his lips.  "I thought I'd lost you."
John smiled sympathetically. “Definitely, Mrs Hudson. I need some normalcy around here. Thanks for coming.”
I am grateful that we came together, as one. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
"Yes, John. Right there." John felt the warmth pool in his lower abdomen and then he was coming, pulsing inside of Sherlock as the younger teen gasped and shuddered.
if you feel I behaved in an ‘unjust manner’ but he deserves everything that he gets.”
Mycroft visits again. He was right.
Sympathy flooded through me as I met his eyes with my own. They looked so sad, so hurt. He didn't deserve the pain that he was suffering, my sweet, amazing John. Seeing him in so much emotional agony was torturous. Knowing that I could do nothing to help him made the pain all the more real.
"Forgive me." The younger man stared at the man on the bed, eyes pleading as he watched him. This was his fault, wasn't it? If he had just realised
“Just gone six.”
Before I even register the excruciating pain in my lower back, I am looking towards him, trying to see if he is okay. And it doesn't even take me a second before I realise that he is not.
"Mum?" John mumbled into the darkness, just loud enough for anyone to hear if they were on the ground floor. When there wasn't an immediate reply, panic started to set in and John clutched onto Sherlock's hand tighter. "Mum!"
"We were able to successfully resuscitate John and once he was stabilised we were able to do some scans to see if there was any internal damage." My hands feel clammy and I wipe them on my thighs.
"John will probably not have any bladder or bowel control. Nor does it seem likely that he will regain sexual functioning." I allow my eyes to flutter shut for just a second. Why should John have to suffer through something this truly horrendous? Suddenly there is a hand touching my shoulder and when I open my eyes Lestrade is standing above me.
It was an overdose. Three days after you passed away. Lestrade was the one who found me. I can't remember much. All I know is that when I woke up I had completely forgot that you had gone and I was calling for you. But it was Lestrade who had to remind me that you were no longer here and I broke down. I never want to feel like that again.
“I was testing the flammability of different fruits. Don’t worry- there’s only a couple of burns on the counter. I managed to put the flames out.”
“I saw him, Harry. That night when you were out with your friends. Sherlock was round. They were arguing-“
Forever yours,
"Mum, you really shouldn't be encouraging your seventeen year old to have sex."
I'll see you soon, darling.
I glance at Dr Pace who is standing a small distance away from us. I hold my finger up to her, asking for a moment. She nods her head.
“You did, John.” John squeezed their hands a little tighter.
Just then Sherlock’s bedroom door opens and in comes Mycroft, suited up as always with a smug grin on his face. He takes a moment to assess the room before noticing that his brother is sitting just that bit closer to John than usual and
“See you tomorrow, John.”
"I did not raise my
for my happiness to be destroyed. I thought that you had managed to escape without an injury when I heard that gunshot and he fell to the floor.
"What for?"
“You helped him the last time,” Mrs Hudson pointed out, “and he was fine after that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Peters! Attend to Rheon and get Walters and Dawson to help with Doors and Grimes! Get fucking moving!"
John paused, watched Sherlock as he took John's hand in his own, touching delicate little kisses to his knuckles. "We need to talk."
“When I got old enough Mummy allowed me to walk him by myself. Of course, I always came here and there was always something new to discover. It’s a fascinating place. This is the first time I’ve come here since Redbeard died.”
As a droplet of water splashes back to its home it causes a pattern of ripples to interrupt the still black expanse of lake in front of us, dancing along the surface until it is no more and relinquishes. He does this twice more, his eyes following the movement each time. Pink lips turn upwards at the corners as he watches.
Sherlock is the one who pulls away first and when he looks up to his brother Mycroft cannot help but feel broken at the sight of him. He was the picture of a defeated man.
And I wasn't. Not anymore.
Mr Watson was now looking at his son again, his eyebrows furrowed in disbelief. "Don't you
"I'm sorry, John."
I didn't return back to school for another four days, instead finding myself in the relief of cocaine and highs. It was fantastic.
satisfaction. Mycroft-“
He was so gentle with me, as if he was afraid he'd break me. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous- I was terrified. I've no idea why. It was as if the universe had written our story out for us. That night was meant to be.
"I'm fine, Sherlock." I know he's not. Anyone could realise that. "It's just, you know, the headaches."
“Spare me the talk, Lestrade.” Sherlock slumped against his chair and immediately put his head in his hands. They were shaking and it wasn’t difficult to see that it was out of frustration and anger rather than worry (although Lestrade was sure that must have been a contributing factor).
Immediately John's fingers were grappling at the elastic of Sherlock's underwear, pulling them down and exposing Sherlock's red and swollen cock, the tip glistening with precome. He did the same to himself until they were both naked, bodies pressing together. John tangled his fingers into Sherlock's hair, pulling slightly and causing the most gorgeous sounds to escape his boyfriend's mouth.
“I’ll text Lestrade in the morning.” Sherlock says, looking at his daughter. Her skin is sallow and clammy, and she looks frail within Sherlock’s arms.
Sherlock twists the rings, the metal cold to his touch. There are two there now. Exactly the same.
He isn't unconscious- his eyes are blinking as if he's trying to acknowledge what is happening- but he's not moving. His body is twisted at an angle that I cannot even begin to describe and
“It’s not ok.” John responds, his voice barely there. Sherlock’s arms hold him closer, pressing John against his chest so all he can hear is the gentle beat of Sherlock’s heart. He counts.
Lestrade throws the phone against the wall before Mycroft has the chance to hang up. Of course he bloody knows. Why wouldn’t he? Lestrade clenches his fist and slams his knuckle against the side of the building. How could this happen? How in God’s name could a case go so horrendously wrong for them?
"I know J-"
“You are allowed a higher dose than what you have already.”
“Fantastic,” John responded, wincing slightly again. This went unnoticed by the doctor.
One day I have to undergo an emergency operation. They hadn't detected the bleeding on my brain. Mycroft sues the hospital and has multiple doctors and nurses fired.
Surely he'd misheard what John had said.
"John?" Mrs Watson encouraged, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“Good afternoon, Mr Holmes.” The doctor held out his hand for Sherlock to shake. “And you…”
"John, I..." But any words that I wanted to say wouldn't come out so I tugged him into me, holding him close as he rested his head against my shoulder. We stayed like that, just the two of us.
"Please John." I said again, hoping for anything. But nothing happened.
John remained silent, unsure of what to say. What could he say? It's not as if he could just make himself stop being ill, make everything just go away. He wished he could. There was no doubt about that. But he couldn't and that was a fact, one fact that
“I am aware of how distressing this situation may be for you but I am happy to confirm that John is in a stabilised position and we believe he will make a recovery.” The doctor paused and smiled at Sherlock, who in turn nodded his head. This didn’t mean he was in the all clear yet. “The way the bullet entered meant that John’s lung collapsed which caused it to fill with blood. That’s a lot scarier than it sounds, don’t worry. We’ve managed to drain the blood but the chest tube will remain in place until the lung is able to inflate on its own. Our trauma surgeons have repaired the damaged lung and surrounding area and have removed the bullet. John’s now in a stabilised state in the ICU. We’ll keep him in the ICU for today to make sure there’s no post-surgery complications. Due to the state of the injury the police will be informed but our main focus right now is making sure that John is ok.”
“You can get out now.”
I tightened my grip on him and tugged him closer so our chests were touching. His jaw clenched together tightly to try and calm himself down.
Patricia’s friendly persona faltered and she was left staring at Sherlock, confused, frustrated and just a tad angry. “I’ve no idea where you have got this information from or who gave it to you-“
With a nod of his head, Sherlock picked up another biscuit.
The first time I am allowed out in the wheelchair, I am afraid. Getting in that wheelchair will make everything seem more real and I don't want that. I don't want to acknowledge that I'll never walk again because the prospect absolutely bloody terrifies me.
An audible gasp escaped Sherlock's mouth as he was welcomed by the sight of John's chest, a light scattering of pale hair dusting over the toned, muscled body. John smirked as he slowly began fingering the buttons of Sherlock's plum coloured shirt, leaving the taller boy breathing heavily as his fingers twitched nervously on the mattress.
“She should hopefully be awake by now.”
His thumb slides ever so slowly across my clavicle- he's been doing that for the last five minutes. He knows that the time is coming nearer.
"You looked relieved to see me. When I looked at you I saw how knackered you were, how stressed. So I told you to get some rest and that I'd watch your mum for a while." Again, John nodded.
the gun was the only weapon. But it only took me a second to see that knife in his hand, laced with blood, and then I heard you and you were choking.
Sherlock listens as his brother strides away, no longer bothering to remain quiet as he takes his steps. The wind begins to pick up and Sherlock feels cold, so bloody cold. He pulls his coat tighter around his body, flipping the collar up and he can hear him, hear John's voice laughing at him.
“I’m on my way.”
The recovery process is agonising, painful. Months of rehabilitation, therapy, examinations. I can't even use the toilet by myself. I feel absolutely pathetic.
"I said shut up. Do you understand how to do that?"
"Fuck no, John. No." I stutter as tears sting my eyes. This, it's too awful for me to comprehend. It can't be happening. Why is this happening?
“Yes.” Sherlock’s hand makes its way into John’s and he holds it, feeling his pulse thrum through his veins, a little beat against Sherlock’s fingertips. For a moment all that can be heard is the rustle of leaves as they blow across the opening and then, occasionally, silence as the breeze diminishes. John turns his head to the side and watches the way the sun catches on Sherlock, changing chestnut into auburn. Sherlock’s breathing has returned to a steady pace and John cannot help but see how content he is, looking up to the sky and just
Another massive grin spread across John's lips as he stared at the man beneath him, consumed by happiness and joy.
He just smiles at me. I get slightly worried but eventually he does talk. His voice is croaky and sore, barely there, but he still manages to speak to me. "Didn't manage to get the tea bags then, did I?" He chuckles but it soon turns into a cough and he grimaces, tears forming in his eyes. I place my head closer to his and caress his hair with my thumb. "It hurts."
And I want to scream. Scream at the top of my lungs to anyone who will listen to me because
“Wait until the doctor-“
His whole left side was absent of skin, most of it burnt and peeled away, including his face. I shook my head, not willing to accept this because how could this possibly be happening?
Glaring at him, I yanked myself away from his grip and grabbed my bag, slamming the door to the classroom as I left, giving everyone the middle finger as I went.
“I honestly don’t know how I missed it. Mistake on my part. It’s the first time he’s been on drugs since he’s met John- or so I’m aware. He’s been trying to figure out this case for months. Maybe the stress got to him. All I know is that it wasn’t safe for him to be in that hospital whilst he was like that and Mycroft agrees- he could have done anything. He’s always been unpredictable whilst influenced. At least here I’ll know he’ll be calm and
“Black, two sugars, just as you like it.” She handed Sherlock a mug which was decorated with anatomically correct hearts, and sat down beside him on the sofa. He swung his feet around so he was sitting upright and took a sip of his tea.
As the two teenagers entered the room, the smell of cigarette smoke and strong coffee attacked their nostrils. Mrs Watson was sitting at the table, cigarette in hand and in her dressing gown. Her mousy brown hair looked dishevelled and it was pulled into a loose ponytail that reached just below her shoulders. A single flavourless smelling candle sat a top the table, illuminating her pale face. John switched the lights on and smiled at his mother.
The news is overwhelming and my bottom lip begins to tremble. Mycroft places his hand on top of mine, just as he used to do when we were younger. Finally I cry: it is the first time I have allowed myself any tears since he died, and when I start, I cannot stop. Mycroft holds me as I sob into his chest uncontrollably.
"John fell into a coma shortly after his arrival." She tells me, but I already knew that. "All we can do now is do our best to keep him comfortable." Eleanor has been with John since he was first diagnosed. John had once told me that she was his favourite nurse- the only one who could keep up a good conversation, apparently. I am glad that she is the one who will be with him as he goes.
to be away from John again.
Sherlock is on his feet in an instant once he sees John looking at the family and he’s wrapping his arm around his waist, embracing John against his chest. John’s head fits just right underneath Sherlock’s chin and he clings to Sherlock’s shirt, head resting against his chest.
Knocking on the door as a quick warning, John timidly crept inside of his bedroom and he was met with the biggest grin on Sherlock's face that he had seen in a while. The younger teenager was hunched over the edge of the bed, elbows on knees and tapping his foot on the carpet. Immediately, John bounded over, pinning Sherlock down by the shoulders and straddling him over the hips. Sherlock tilted his head up, latching his lips onto John's as they met each other in a passionate kiss.
"It would be my privilege." And it would. It absolutely would.
“It’s not that simple-“
“Oh for god’s sake. Not me. Your husband. You have a chain around your neck- wedding ring is on it. He didn’t die recently, no, you haven’t got a tan line on your finger from when you took it off but you keep it with you at all times. You were angry. Night after night he’d be going to dens, high as a kite. Until one day it was too much and he was found dead… Your marriage was failing anyway. Yet you still have the ring.”
I don't make it to his funeral. I'm too weak still and the doctors advise me not to go. I need to focus on my recovery, apparently. I don't think I can recover, not fully. Definitely not emotionally. And even if I wanted to disobey the doctors orders, it's not like I could have made it out of the hospital by myself.
“You have made me the happiest I have been in weeks,” John’s voice breaks slightly on the final syllables. Sherlock has been the constant in John’s life since his mother died and for that, John couldn’t be more appreciative.  It was impossible to say when Harry would be at home and when she was she was usually reluctant to speak to either him or his father. And John’s dad. Well, if those two weren’t caught in a shouting match John would be trying his absolute best to ignore him.
It was now or never.
He thinks and begins to panic.
“You need some rest.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Vulnerable. Please do spare me the pity.” Sherlock made to turn but Mycroft managed to stand in his way, blocking the entrance back into the hospital. He stood closer so he was face to face with Sherlock but the few centimetres he had on his brother made him seem all the more intimidating.
"I don't know." Sherlock glanced at him, questioning John's statement. He waited, willing John to elaborate. "I didn't want to find out. It would make this whole thing all that more real."
“What has he got to worry about? It’s John who’s-“ But before he could get the words out or even consider what he was going to say next, Sherlock’s voice broke and he inhaled a shaky breath, pressing his eyes together whilst shaking his head. No no no. He had been awake the whole night and no one had told him anything. “How is he?”
I comply.
Sherlock lifted his left hand so that it was no longer resting on the soft black duvet atop of John's bed, moving it swiftly so that his fingers looped with John's. He stroked his thumb along John's palm, gently lifting their intertwined hands so that he could touch delicate kisses to each knuckle.
“And you read my writing upside down. See what I mean?”
Closing my hand around his again, I swipe my thumb over his palm to calm him down. "John, you're in the hospital." I tell him. He looks at me and I feel like breaking down again. "There, just breathe." I'm just telling him exactly what Lestrade told me yesterday. I feel ridiculous. How is one meant to calm down when they are restrained, without knowing why he is restrained? I stroke his hair again and I want to hit myself for how stupid I'm being. I'm angry at everything.
Sherlock manoeuvred the hand that wasn’t holding onto John’s and rested it behind his head, stroking his thumb gently backwards and forwards over his greying hair. John nudged his head back into Sherlock’s palm whilst inhaling, letting the oxygen from his cannula course through into his lungs. They remained in companionable silence for a couple of minutes, Sherlock soothing John as he calmed down, never once breaking his hold of John’s hand.
John, can’t,” Sherlock panted, completely lost to his pleasure, the color high on his cheeks. Within remorse, John continued to stroke in teasing, sure circles around the small nub inside of his lover until his pink cock dripped out a small amount of cum.
"-lock, Sherlock? Can you hear me, sweetheart?" John asked, crossing the bedroom swiftly to push Sherlock curls back and lift his chin to meet his eyes. Sherlock blinked in confusion for a few moments before he realized he was back in the present.
They ordered their food shortly thereafter, and once the waiter had left their cozy table, John stared a Sherlock, watching his often severe features become softened in the candlelight and the streetlights outside on the busy road. Sherlock broke their gaze, turning his iridescent eyes outside to peer at the street, perhaps searching for a case to distract him from the heavy atmosphere surrounding their table. John coughed lightly to get Sherlock’s attention.
and carrying him in his steady arms to their shared bedroom.
The lieutenant let out a victorious “
John was no help, texting him intermittently throughout the morning.
"Come now bee" Siger prompted with an impish grin, watching as Sherlock ducked his head behind the book he was reading with an embarrassed
Sherlock, the self proclaimed High Functioning-Sociopath. The calculating machine.
“Papa, are you alright?” Rosie asked politely, “You’re red.”
Sherlock shuttered at the thought, and looked at her reflection once more.
Sherlock was tugging on his usual tailored dress pants and shot John and annoyed look, “no, John, this is not ‘just a fundraiser,’ this is a black tie event. You need a tuxedo.”
The drunken Prince sneered at the gift,
There was even an LGBTQ+ friendly church passing out cross stickers with rainbows inside.
"But, you're bisexual," Sherlock stated one night about a week after the flower incident when the two residents were reading by the fire.
“He isn’t a beast” Sherlock called out in frustration, “he was a man! He is a good person, please, I’ll do as you ask, I’ll m-marry you. Just don’t hurt John,” Sherlock pleaded.
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
Looking around the small collection of lingerie and panties that the saleswoman had laid out for him, Sherlock decided to be adventurous and with a nod he pulled out his wallet.
Sherlock thought to himself as he took deep breathe, and peered around him, taking in the shadows in the darkness and, for the first time, feeling a bit of unease.
“Sir,” she acknowledged with a nod.
Looking down, John saw a sight he never thought he would enjoy again- his body. While his shoulder still twinged a bit when he flexed, he knew his body was in pristine shape, as it had not aged in almost eight years. He gently pulled off his torn shirt and ran a hand down and up his abdomen, reveling in the muscles there from his army days.
“Only a naughty boy is spanked over someone’s knee,” John hedged, not wanted to scare Sherlock but having a sneaking suspicion that where he was going with this would not be unwelcome.
"Yes!" Sherlock exclaimed, thrusting back against John's invading tongue as he began to harden once again under John's ministrations. God, he loved when John did this to him. It was so forbidden, absolutely filthy and so, so,
Sherlock considered John, looking him up and down, a growing look of confusion gracing his pale features, his brow furrowing and his plump mouth turning down in a frown.
- this?” Sherlock begged, as John continued to sweep past his sweet spot with wicked precision, his eyes dark and knowing and staring at Sherlock.
Just a few notes:
“Sherlock?” John asked, troubled by the frantic look that was rapidly falling over Sherlock’s sharp features, “Sherlock, are you alright?”
John watched Sherlock clench his eyes shut, two glistening tear tracks making their way down his sharp cheekbones, and John reached out to gently wipe them away, watching Sherlock nuzzle his face into the fur of his palm.
“That’s right, darling,” John grunted out as he began to rock, “your pleasure is mine. You belong to me.”
Sherlock was wandering the halls of the castle one morning, staring up at the artwork on the ceilings, when he ran into something strong, and covered in soft hair.
Interesting. Sherlock's mind was firing with deductions about the young woman. Small but strong, with honey blonde hair that was thrown back in a careless braid and a weary expression. She had a plump figure that was built with muscles from her active lifestyle, and she had the careful hands of someone who could handle a gun. She was favoring her right side, her shoulder on the left somewhat slumped where she stood in parade rest- wounded in battle then.
"Greg is suppose to be here around 11 to watch the Rugby match," John commented absently, and Sherlock began whining immediately.
"What have I taught you about stating the obvious, little brother?" Mycroft said in his usual condescending tone, but it was lacking with the warmth in his eyes as he stared at Sherlock.
“You mean my lack of freedom,” Sherlock murmured under her breath, but she did look up to meet John’s gaze.
John felt dawning awareness coming over him the next morning, a strange sensation emanating from his chest. Blinking his eyes blearily, he looked around for the reason he was being awoken.
Then the spell would be broken.
Sherlock glanced up with a quirk to his lips at John’s sentimental question, deducing John’s intentions to take them to Angelo’s, and gave the appropriate response, “starving.”
" Moriarty sang out with a short laugh, rocking back in his chair with a gleam in his cold eyes.
And so there they sat, in the candle lit room in the romantic setting of Baker Street, with Sherlock squirming on his vibrating dildo, his skin perspiring and his lips pink and plumped from his teething.
“Now, something to wear” Mrs. Hudson said, “go over to the wardrobe and pick something out, everything should be in your size.”
Now, Sherlock was exploring his new residence, and he stumbled across a beautiful room full of artwork and statues with the likeness he had never seen outside of London museums of fine art. The room's celling was at least twenty feet tall, with a golden chandelier hanging ornately. A wall of windows faced the gardens, and while the gardens were mainly overgrown and untended, it was still full of greenery and made the room look more lifelike than the rest of the castle. The room was bathed in the brief flashes of sunlight that were able to break past the sun and reflect across the snow covering the ground.
The mountain town of Iris was not home to many jovial occasions- since the invasion of the Valwald armies two years ago. The King’s Guard had been scouting miles away due to false information they had received about a potential attach in the northern forest, and by the time they heard the clanging bells indicating an invasion was approaching Iris, it was too late.
John let out a surprised laugh, “yes, you did! And it is bloody gorgeous. I almost came just from looking at you and your gorgeous body. Your hidden curves, your breasts, and oh
“John,” Sherlock whined, looking at the man who was still relaxing, nude, in the bed with twinkling eyes that spoke of dark promises.
The sunlight shown in through the windows on the two men curled up together as they dozed in John’s chair, and as they relaxed, Sherlock began humming a beautiful tune, oddly reminiscent.
John reached down to begin stroking Sherlock’s arousal, ignoring Sherlock’s pleads of oversensitivity as precome began to leak from the tip of his engorged cock.
Yes, quite lovely indeed,
Siger gave a hearty chuckle at Sherlock's shy mannerisms, and looked at him pointedly until Sherlock gave up with a huffed "fine, you win. I would like a rose, if you have the means to obtain one." Siger tilted his head in confusion at the odd request, but Sherlock made no further explanations, and returned to his reading, sipping his tea gently to ward off the chill.
The commander grunted in response, observing John’s elegant footwork and quick movements and she firmly moved her sword with the determination and skill of practiced swordsmen, plunging it once again into the bull’s-eye with accuracy. Begrudgingly, he nodded and agreed, “yes, fine, she would be an appropriate addition- with our numbers so depleted, we cannot be picky. Even if she
He pulled back slightly, still gripping Sherlock by his upper arms as if to make sure he was truly there, “what are you doing here, my child? I thought-“
“Yes, well I was. No longer, now I am this…. Creature” The beast trailed off, his mind seeming to wander far away from this room and time, but Sherlock was desperate to make the most of this conversation.
John shook his head to clear the decidedly inappropriate thoughts away, turning towards his uncertainty ridden flatmate, wanting to calm Sherlock’s nerves and make sure the young man was feeling alright after the fiasco with John’s date.
Before the transformation, before he was stabbed in the war, an old army mate of his Lord Anderson had come to him with his bastard child in tow, asking John to take her on as his ward, to educate and love her as a father would. John reluctantly agreed, and Anderson left without ever looking back. Rosie, only two at the time, had instantly wrapped John around her finger, and for the Prince, going back to war after meeting Rosie was hard.
Warnings: Object insertion, slight humiliation kink
“J-John, please let me come,” Sherlock panted while he shimmied on the deliciously tickling dildo stuffed in his arse, but John only smiled and shook his head.
Too bad her eyes were dim with boredom and apathy.
In the quiet, with only the sound of the horse’s trotting along and the forest surrounding them, John pictured the princess in her mind’s eye.
With a smirk, John sat up briefly, tearing off his clothes in anticipation as he sat astride Sherlock’s thighs. Once he was naked, he settled back down, forming his body against Sherlock’s back, his cock settling between Sherlock’s plump cheeks, rubbing against the strip of silk separating them.
“John please-“ Sherlock whimpered, feeling unaccountably shy at being stripped away to his most vulnerable with John inside of him, controlling his pleasure and now, asking Sherlock to open his heart.
Once there, he asked Angelo to bring a candle to the table, since it always was more romantic, and called Sherlock beautiful between mouthfuls of mushroom lasagna. Sherlock chocked from shock, and John patted his back until his breathing was back to normal.
attracted to both men and women, but since returning to London, he had only entertained the thought of the opposite sex, Sherlock offering a brief moment of hope before it was squashed out in the same instant.
Moving his gaze briefly from the plants, Siger peered at the stone edifice in wonderment.
John sighed and shook her head, gazing up at the moon and finding no solace in the dark.
Yes, Sherlock was glad to be a woman.
“Good, because next time, I will pull down your pants and spank you for all of Scotland Yard to see,” John whispered teasingly, and Sherlock’s face grew mortified, meeting John’s eyes with his own in shocked horror.
“What did
Walking out of Baker Street, the brightly dressed men hailed a cab, who merely raised his eyebrows at their outfits, and went straight to the heart of the pride parade, which was in full swing at Traflgar Square.
,” John moaned out, never having felt such sensations, and as Sherlock let go of John’s member with a succulent –
Sherlock. More specifically, a needy Sherlock who was hunting for attention.
summoning me to the crime scene?”
So... this was all me. My mind is a dark place to be, apparently *chuckles* Did I drink a little too much wine while writing this chapter? Maybe. More rimming, face fucking, spanking and a surprise ;) Enjoy! Kudos/comments appreciated.
It had been over seven years since the transformation, and he had not talked to his darling Rosie in all those years. He didn't want her to see him this way.
John felt simultaneously out of place and comforted by the sight of the people, trying to regain normalcy.
Indescribable sensations raced through the two men as John rocked back and forth, back and forth.
“I’m err, s-sorry about that,” he stammered, leaning down to begin collecting books, and the beast lent down to lend a hand. Sherlock glanced up at him to give him a smile, and the beast’s lips quirked at the corners from the ridiculous young man who, quite literally sometimes, stumbled into his life.
“Y-yellow, I’m sorry,” Sherlock panted out, scrabbling his hands over John’s biceps to hold on, clenching his eyes shut and trying to control his transport, his arse tensing, trying to push out the foreign, painful manhood against Sherlock's will.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes were shining, and she was sniffling while looking at Sherlock with a fond expression.
“Color?” John asked.
“I can’t believe- I just- this is amazing. Are you two together now?” She asked, her eyes full to the brim with hope. John, feeling overwhelmed by the attention they were now receiving from multiple people due to the girl’s outburst, simply nodded, grasping Sherlock’s hand tighter in his own.
Your comments give me inspiration to keep going! Thank you all so much for your support of this (filthy, depraved, yet somehow still fluffy) story of mine. Feel free to make suggestions of what you want to see, and I will take them under advisement. Also, self-care is important, so take care of yourselves!
Since the day Sherlock and the beast spent in the library, their affection for one another had grown significantly. They spend almost every day together, walking in the gardens or reading in the library in front of the roaring fire. Sherlock’s fingers itched to bury themselves in the soft golden fur, and stroke the long whiskers on his lion’s face.
“Hmm,” John clucked, looking down at the results blinking on the thermometer with a shaking head.
, John thought with a shrug, laying down and closing her eyes, putting princesses and phantom curls far from her mind as she succumbed to sleep.
“Princess, I can leave as soon as you wash your hair,” John remarked, making 'princess' sound like a fond epithet.
The men threw them inside the cage and Moriarty came forward to lock it, smirking at Sherlock as he glared back, staunching the blood flow from a cut over his eye.
Next time: Exhibitionism, sex toys under clothes, and more lingerie
“Would complete you as a human being," John interrupted, leaning forward and catching Sherlock’s plump lips in a soft kiss, just the barest brushing of lips against one another, but Sherlock could taste John’s tea and an underlying flavor that was just
As Sherlock stared at the blinking document in front of him, a niggling idea began to bloom in the back of his mind. Blossoming traitorously despite Sherlock's many attempts to push it away.
The beast led him down the passageway and then to the right. Sherlock knew they were headed to the North Wing, but he allowed the beast his game of confusion, and smiled at the feeling of his hands being held so gently by a fierce some beast.
There was a the dildo attached to it.
And look at where he is now.
As he glanced down, he saw Sherlock’s rosy, puckered opening stretched around his hard cock, and decided to claim Sherlock as often as he allowed in the future to keep the hole stretched and open for his provocative use.
“Here, sit by me.”
John gave him a wicked smile, leaning down to kiss Sherlock’s sternum once again, continuing to roll his abdomen against Sherlock’s prick, and reveling in Sherlock’s whimpers.
Sherlock stared on with mounting astonishment, and the three castle resident’s gasped in tandem as John’s body began to spin, a glow surrounding John similarly to the shining light that used to encase the enchanted rose.
With that, John began to stroke harder, latching onto one of Sherlock’s nipples and sucking it while laving his tongue over the hardening nipple in the way he knew Sherlock loved.
Sherlock thought sullenly, watching Mrs. Hudson and John continue chatting about their new relationship.
John leaned back and took in the sight of his detective; his cheeks flushed a pretty rose, his lips reddened and shiny and his hair an absolute mess of curls. Lying there with the stark contrast of his paleness against the red lips and ebony hair, he appeared to be angelic, a wanton creature that was both disarming and enticing.
“You’re right, as usual, Sherlock. Now, off you go. Where’s John anyway?”
Sherlock, feeling bold, took his index finger and ran it up and down John’s soft skin just pass his perineum, watching as John gasped but did not tell him to stop. Continuing to kiss John’s cock, Sherlock also found his rosebud and began pressing lightly, never penetrating, but creating a rhythm of pulsations that began to drive John wild.
“Now, if there are no more protests, please take off your gown and assume the position,” John ordered, popping open a tube of medical grade lubricant and turning around to face the shy patient.
“You, you look amazing,” John stammered, staring at Sherlock who met his eyes in the mirror and glanced away, faking nonchalance but unable to stop the tips of his ears from heating.
, of course. Yes! Oh, that’s brilliant.
Sherlock braced himself, and lent down to pull the looking glass from his pack, handing it to his father.
This is why she didn’t have friends. Her biting tongue and natural distrust of, well, everyone made friendship an impossible task.
“Clear, like your mind is focused and relaxed at the same time, I know,” John said with a smile evident in his voice, and Sherlock turned around slightly to gaze at John in confusion.
He was raised with all the privileges of his highborn status; the library within their estate was full to the brim with novels and texts about the world, and Sherlock read as often as he was able of lands and cultures far different from his own, he learned about science and great literature, adoring the connection between the physical and emotional worlds.
, but he knew that the additional irate temperament would lead to further concern.
Well, John
John smirked, his eyes sparklingly darkly as he continued, “yes, that is just what my baby boy needed, a spanking with a ginger root and then some attention from his daddy.”
He was scanning the text for a specific section when Sherlock entered the library with a huge stack of books carried in his leanly muscled arms.
Cringing to himself, John stood up and went to seek out the only woman who had ever truly been like a mother to him.
“If I get anymore lip, you’ll have a red bottom to complement that lovely thermometer,” John warned, and Sherlock’s head flopped back down on the bed in defeat. John rocked the thermometer in and out a few more times, angling for Sherlock's prostate and adoring the younger man's frustrated wriggling until the thermometer beeped again and John quickly removed it.
“Sherlock wait,” John yelled, rushing after the impulsive younger man, but it was too late. Sherlock’s mind on a case allowed for a kind of concentration and single-minded focus that John had never witnessed before.
John did not answer, and went over to the chair, hunching in the corner, “I wish to be alone now.”
his inner-mind said sardonically, sounding annoyingly like Mycroft.
Admittedly it was a lovely dream: He and John were kissing, fighting back and forth, taking and giving, quick and hurried. Then John's hand trailed down and grasped his phallus, stroking it with precision and causing Sherlock to lose all sense.
Sherlock’s stormy green and blue eyes opened and looked down to meet John’s, flushing further at the intimacy of the moment.
With that parting slot and a final wink, John felt the bedroom, leaving the door slightly opened to into the sitting room to wait for Lestrade.
Just a little taste.
“Do we have a deal, Sherlock?”
John said it with such conviction, such passion, that Sherlock felt a warmth growing inside of her that had nothing to do with arousal. John, Oh,
Sherlock looked down, and felt blood rushing and heating his face at the slight tenting of the covers from his arousal. He pondered for a moment longer on the meaning of the dream. Maybe it was a coincidence?
Sherlock glanced over at John’s barely covered laugh, and felt heat rising over his cheeks at John’s obviously deduced train of thought.
“No, the fault is mine-“ the beast interrupted.
Did you catch the reference to "The Great Gatsby"?
Sherlock whimpered from the sensitive touches to her neck and thighs, and felt John grinning against her collarbone, pleased at Sherlock's sensitivity to her touch.
John turned and grasped the magic mirror, handing it to Sherlock and gently folding the frozen fingers around the looking glass, the hands that were still clutching the pink rose desperately.
Her cheekbones, her changeable eyes, and the top of her wet
“Nothing to be ashamed of, love, lots of people from all walks of life come here and we accommodate them all. This is not unusual at all,” she waved a hand in his direction, and Sherlock felt calmed by her blasé reaction to him wanting lingerie for himself, as if it was nothing out of the ordinary.
The younger man seemed to shake himself out of his stupor after a moment more, glancing away from John to fiddle with his silverware and begin picking at the pasta on his plate, thinking deeply and crinkling his forehead in the process.
“Ta then,” John said, turning to walking towards the living room, tearing his eyes away from his detective on the case, “let me know when we need to leave.”
A wind began to pick up in the air, and the rustling of crisp spring leaves began to join together in a soft harmony. The tones grew louder, and the wind grew stronger.
“Don’t feel self-conscious, darling, I love seeing you submit to me. I’ve never met anyone half as beautiful as you.”
“No, oh no, Philip! Where is my father?” Sherlock asked in a gasp, looking towards the forest where the horse had come running. Making up his mind with a nod, Sherlock mounted Philip and spurred him into movement with a kick and an ordered, “run!”
“Come on Sherlock, the water’s getting cold, we need to get out,” John said, stepping out of the bath and picking up a two large towels, and carrying them into his room, motioning for sherlock to follow.
“No, friends protect people. Or at least guards do,” John corrected herself with a shake of her head, more fly-aways breaking free from her long braid.
, his mind reminded him.
"No, love, I'm sorry I just-you look just so-"
No matter how much he shifted, the dildo was designed with ribs and ridges and torment and tease Sherlock from the inside.
, could get someone as lovely, and strong, and brave as John…
“J-John, please, I need you,” Sherlock gasped, and John nodded, laving kisses on the nape of Sherlock’s neck and tasting the sweet perspiration. Reaching to the bedside table, John snatched the lube and sat back, tugging the thong away slightly to drizzle the cold liquid right over Sherlock’s pink hole, nudging it with two fingers, pushing slightly and then receding.
“You’ve been wounded in battle, recently as they’ve only been allowing women into battle for the past three years due to desperation caused by the Valwald. Your left shoulder was pierced and you most likely suffered from an infection, which caused a long recovery period. The way you hold yourself says battle ready, the way you speak indicates a command of some kind- perhaps a Captain? Either way, it is simple enough to see once you know where to look,” Sherlock dismissed with a wave of her hand, inwardly smug as she took in Mycroft’s tightening jaw and the council members shocked silence.
Comments/kudos feed my soul! Until next time <3
“Do you need some help? You’ve been standing out there for almost ten minutes,” she remarked, and Sherlock looked down, feeling bashful once again at the thought of what he wanted….
While wiping off Sherlock's stomach, John heard a mumbled, "-ove you too." John smiled and teasingly asked, "what was that, love? That you just said?"
Sherlock, however….
“Sentiment” Sherlock replied with a nod.
"Can I sleep here, with you?" Sherlock asked plainly, and John nodded.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, moaning the next moment when John thrust up harshly in delicious punishment.
“Where is Sherlock going?” She asked, ignoring his growls, as she was wont to do. John shook his head; mustering up what little energy he had left.
They felt like gay royalty.
“We’re going to a fundraiser for Mycroft, there is a high ranking official who will be attending, Lord Grey. He is suspected of embezzling government funds to secure his financial stability. I need to catch him at it,” Sherlock bit out quickly, his words short and focused, his mind already spinning on the case. The many variables and possible outcomes swirling in his mind’s eye as John watched forever fascinated by Sherlock’s brilliance.
Although he had almost everything his heart desired,
“Sherlock,” the aforementioned doctor called into the flat, and Sherlock quickly threw on his red silk dressing gown, belting it just in time before John pushed open his-now their-bedroom door.
It was recent, as she could be no more than twenty-five, and she was obviously still suffering from nightmares and anxiousness regarding the incident, so maybe….
Sherlock walked to her door of her suite and opened it, looking for John for a moment.
John walked back over to the instrument table, knowing that Sherlock would be able to hear what he was doing and deduce his intentions fairly quickly.
As he continued on, a light appeared at the end of the path and an unexpected calm settled over his bony shoulders as he continued forward, his long legs dashing through the underbrush and he forged ahead. A smile broke over his face and a redness rose to his cheeks from exertion and excitement of the unknown.
John took a sip of tea, steeling herself and throwing back her shoulders into a military stance that set Sherlock on edge, “you’re right, they weren’t given to me. I bought them.”
Sherlock watched, his forehead crinkled in confusion, as John came over to the bed and lead down, placing a kiss onto Sherlock’s curly head and pressing the tattered book into his hands.
Sherlock’s heart felt full enough to burst, and once he felt John breathing even out, he responded, “Sweet dreams, John.”
“It’s like from a fairytale,” John remarked, and Sherlock nodded. There were fairy lights hanging from the ceilings, along with a massive chandelier. Waiters were passing out drinks, and a string quartet was playing in the corner of the echoing space.
Check out my page on tumblr for updates on the story:
“I am not a sentimental man, John, and I know you are aware, but you are my exception. My
John realized soon thereafter that he wouldn't hold a chance against the enigmatic Sherlock Holmes.
And there was a quiet wisdom within her: a woman who had seen the world, the world Sherlock had never been permitted to experience.
But…. Sherlock knew John. Knew that he was kind, and always accepting of Sherlock’s quirks and faults. So, releasing a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, Sherlock stepped towards the lingerie, picking it up and observing it closely.
“I can’t leave the castle because of the unrest in the kingdom and my own "frailty," and now I apparently can’t even be trusted to leave my
“You. I belong to you, John.”
Sherlock held her favorite tiara that Mycroft had made to celebrate her day of birth when she was 16; it had silver skull decorations among the emeralds and diamonds that sparkled as brightly as they did five years ago. Sherlock recalled the joy she had felt when unwrapping the gift, genuinely smiling to her brother for the first time since their parents had passed years before.
Her life was about to change, and it was right around the corner. She could feel it thrumming in her veins.
John cleared his throat once more and ran a hand over his face, steeling himself for possible rejection: “The first night, you made it clear that your Work takes precedence over any relationship, and I understand, but-“
Sherlock’s trousers were straining from his erection, and John brought his hands down to Sherlock’s trousers, while continuing to worship his chest with kisses and teasing tugs with his teeth.
A new adventure- it's Christmas!
Sherlock glanced at an enormous statue of Poseidon and looked away, giggling slightly at the voluptuous rear present on the statue before the fish-tail began to form on his upper thighs, remembering all the stories he had read about Poseidon as a boy, how he was the king of the sea and fearsome to all who crossed his path, his strength written about in great greek poetry and prose.
“Molly, I simply must-“ Sherlock cut off with a wheezing gasp as the final metal thatch was secured and the laces were tied as tightly as her maid could muster. Sherlock took a deep breath (or as deep as she could manage) and met her own gaze in the mirror, trying to ignore Molly’s platitudes and “oh, shush now” by looking at her- uncommon- appearance.
“John, you are the best, bravest, and wisest man I’ve ever had the pleasure to know,” Sherlock whispered through the dark bedchamber, and John felt tears begin to slip from his eyes as he stared out the window, not responding, and feeling as though his heart would never beat again.
As they walked, Sherlock’s ball gown danced around her long legs and created a waterfall effect in the corridors of the palace.
And then the sensation faded, and she was left with only her limp strands curling around her calloused fingertips.
John smiled, completely besotted with the adorable man beneath him, and finally delved deeper, poking at and around the still saliva soaked pink hole nestled between the two cheeks.
. I attempted to regain my smile, and she continued hesitantly, ‘And when I said I needed some help, cook said as how all London knows there’s no better detective than Sherlock Holmes-‘
‘About a fortnight before ‘e died, the master as was, Mr Milverton, asked Mr Stokes, the footman as was, to ‘ave some repairs sorted. I never knew exactly what, something to do struct- structur- having to do with building, and some plumbing work. The builder was a right sour piece, but the plumber, Mr Escott, well, he was....lovely.’ She blushed a little, and I thought that she looked, in that moment, quite lovely herself.  I reminded myself that this lovely man was a creation of Sherlock Holmes and once again determined to give him a piece of my mind.
His eyes snapped open. ‘Do I look amused, Watson?’ He gestured sharply. ‘How can I possibly find a man who doesn’t exist? Why did you even agree to take the case?’
ago. Accurate then.’
He said, wonderingly, ‘There was no thought, none. For that moment, there was just….sensation. It was….incredible.’ I smiled with relief, and ran tip of my finger across a line of moisture on his cheek, kissing the path it had taken. As his breath evened, I leaned to the floor to fetch my handkerchief and clean his chest, and as I moved back we both became aware of my hardness against his leg. I made to draw back and he caught me, holding me in place. He said, ‘May I?’
‘Why don’t I speak to Mr Holmes?’ I said in as placatory a manner as I could. ‘I’m going up anyway and he can hardly object to me.’
‘Not like them.’ He’s upset. John looks at him in disbelief. ‘Never like them.’ He crosses the room and seizes John’s hand, making a grab for the dog tags. John almost lets them go in his surprise, then sees Sherlock’s intent – he’s about to remove his own tag – and grabs them back.
It feels like forever, and much too short a time, before they come apart. John is in need of oxygen, and stability, and breathes hard, as Sherlock rests his forehead against John’s, running his hands along the sides of John’s face, his neck, his shoulders, and back again, murmuring his name in way that makes John emotional for reasons he can’t quite define. He catches Sherlock’s hands, notices their slight tremble, says, ‘Hey. You okay?’
The man himself had increased this impression a few nights ago when he had exclaimed afterwards; ‘This is excellent data, Watson.’ I had stared at him, taken aback, and he had smiled at me with the zeal of the newly converted. ‘Prior to this,’ he had explained, ‘there were certain areas of human motivation and action in which I could only theorise – now I have empirical data. It’s fascinating.’ I had looked at his entirely serious expression, bit my lip, and replied solemnly, ‘I’m glad I could be of assistance.’ The memory made me smile. As I turned into Baker Street, my reverie was interrupted by a call.
He cut me off with a sweep of his hand. In another time I would have called the gesture imperious, but the pale fingers were trembling. I noticed then that the hand on the mantle was gripping it tightly enough to turn the knuckles white. I looked at him in alarm, and took a step towards him to speak again.
I stared for a moment, uncomprehending, then practically vaulted the settee to reach him.
The Persian slipper fell from his trembling fingers, spilling tobacco on the floor. I stepped forward to help and he snapped, ‘I have it.’ He bent and fumbled for it, knocking more tobacco onto the floor. 'For God’s sake-‘ he cursed, his voice breaking on the words.
‘Doctor! Doctor Watson!’ I hurried across the floor as her footsteps sounded on the stairs, and greeted her at the door to our sitting room.
‘Holmes.’ I said, ‘You left the poor girl without so much as a note.’
‘Unless that person is you.’
Utterly to my surprise, I laughed. James regarded me for a moment, then he smiled and shook his head.
She had continued, ‘He was quiet, but such nice manners, even cook said, and she could be quite short wif tradesmen, you know. Anyway, the work only took a couple o’ days, but then ‘e came back. To check the work, ‘e said, but I wasn’t kidded.’ She smiled a little proudly, and added, confidingly, ‘A lady can always tell when a gentleman has set ‘is cap.’
He said with barely suppressed amusement, ‘Unless of course you have something better to do.’ He eyed my desk. ‘Actually, you could do with catching up on your filing-‘ I put my hand over his mouth. His eyes glittered at me and I felt his breath on my palm.
He huffs a relieved laugh into the intimate space between them, ‘And you can have it, love, but let's go slow, okay?’
He continued, oblivious to my interruption, ‘But now you have cast me in the role of selfless hero of humanity, I find myself obliged to be honest, which is painful, to be frank.’ He looked at me with a wry smile, and then caught my expression. ‘Have I mis-spoke? Forgive me, you know my bluntness.‘
‘No, it isn’t. We weren’t - we aren’t -
John freezes. After a moment, he says, in a voice slightly higher pitched than his usual. ‘You’re not. You said so.’
We sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment.
Our landlady sighed again.
Sherlock opens his eyes.
His smile disappeared, to be replaced with a look of irritation. ‘I asked not to be disturbed. What does he want?’
I started. ‘You will not lose me.’ I drew back slightly. I said, ‘Look at me.’ He kept his head turned away. I said again, gently, ‘Holmes. Look at me.’ He raised his face to mine. He looked more lost and uncertain than I had ever seen him. I held his gaze, ‘You could never lose me. Please believe that.’
Freddy Palmer was the oldest of four children in a family that lived near the docks. His mother had been a patient of mine until the previous year, when their father had been laid off from his work, and the family had fallen on hard times. Freddy’s work brought him to Baker Street occasionally, and he would run to speak to me whenever he had the chance, updating me on his family and their lives. He snatched his cap off his head and began, his word tumbling over themselves. ‘It’s mam, Doctor, I’m sorry to come, but she’s so sick, I didn’t know what else to do. She ‘ad the babby Doctor, but she’s not been right since, and now-‘ The strong, quiet lad looked on the verge of tears.
He read my face and said softly, ‘Yes.’
He was almost obscured as he sat bent over his microscope behind the dining room table, which was covered with various items of chemical apparatus. I sighed inwardly. This did indeed have the look of an afternoon’s endeavour. At the sound of my voice, he looked up, and a smile of genuine delight and warmth spread across his face. I felt myself smile back and the day was suspended as we grinned at each other like idiots. The shuffling of feet from the hallway recalled me to myself, and I said,’ Holmes, Lestrade is downstairs.’
‘Then what is it that still bothers you, Watson? We are agreed. The situation cannot be helped.’
I regained my seat and took up my notebook and pen. ‘Mr Holmes is attending a concert this afternoon. I am his friend and colleague Doctor Watson; you may speak to me as you would to Mr Holmes.’
Sherlock licks his lips, goes to speak, stops, then starts again, says harshly, ‘You can’t be a
He frowned slightly. ‘The circumstances were not conducive to accurate deduction. I was emotionally compromised.’ Some of his uncertainty fell away as he warmed to his theme. ‘It’s as I’ve always believed. Emotions are anathema to accurate reasoning.’
‘Yes.’ My voice was steady and firm. ‘Anything, Holmes, you need only ask.’
She beamed at me then, and to my complete surprise, slipped forward and planted a light kiss on my cheek, before turning and walking quickly away.
He smiled back, a little sadly. ‘It’s late. And after that compliment I can hardly throw you out. I have a spare room which you are welcome to.’
‘No.’ As I moved, he tightened his grip on my hand. My movement away was curtailed and I ended up sitting awkwardly next to him on the edge of the bed.
I held his gaze. ‘Thank you. Truly.’
I knew that there were places in London that men who preferred the company of other men could go, but it had never occurred to me to connect those places with myself, until on one of my evening walks I found myself outside one of these establishments. I had had no conscious intent to arrive there, and hastened my steps away. But now my mind was filled with the memory of those times in Afghanistan, and I felt again the desperation of those times, and remembered the relief I had found in the arms of my friend and colleague on our darkest days. What harm could there be, my treacherous mind supplied, in finding such passing absorption again, in these days of utterly unending nothingness? I am ashamed to say that I gave into these impulses on more than one occasion in those bleak, grey days. But then what does a man with nothing to lose care for the censure of the law and society? Any release from the bleakness of feeling nothing at all was a connection to life, however tenuous and fleeting.
After a while he murmured, ‘I have been a fool.’ He was lying on his back, and I had tucked myself along his side, partly to avoid falling out of the narrow bed, but mostly to enjoy the feel of his body against mine as I drifted.
‘A personage of the lower classes, Doctor. A serving girl, although she has assured me she has means to pay. I wouldn’t usually bring this to your attention, but there have been some other unusual visitors of late.’ She sniffed.
‘Be quiet, Sherlock.’ I said, teasingly.
‘I hope so. It may be touch and go for a while. She is so small.’ We sat in silence for a while before I dropped my glass down on the side table. ‘Puerperal fever. My God, have we learned nothing in the last hundred years?’ I could feel myself getting angry. ‘The evidence is clear. Disinfection, cleanliness, the simplest things, and still this happens. I give explicit instructions-‘ I broke off, running a hand through my hair. This was pointless. I drained my drink.
‘I cannot.’ Where my left shoulder met his right, I could feel him trembling. As James had done for me all those years before I slipped my free hand around his shoulders. He said,’ I have never-‘ his voice broke. I pulled him closer, at a loss for the right words. His voice was almost inaudible as he said, ‘I am afraid.’
, I thought.
He said, ‘I cannot say it.’
For his part, the Holmes who came back to Baker Street after his long years away was a more introspective man than the one who left. He had always been prone to fits of great lethargy interspersed with bouts of violent action, and this had not changed. But he would now spend more time absorbed in his thoughts, even without a case to preoccupy him. Having heard him complain so often about the stagnation of his mind without his work, I wondered what he had found to occupy that brilliant mind.
I felt my heart give a lurch. I squeezed her shoulder as firmly as I dared. ‘All will be well, Mrs Hudson, please don't concern yourself.' I said this with a confidence I didn't feel, but she smiled at me anyway, releasing my hand. ‘Thank you, Doctor.' She pulled her shawl more firmly around her shoulders. 'Goodnight.'
I remembered that at the time I had rebuked Holmes for trifling with the girl’s affections, although with hindsight, I had not been especially censorious. I made a mental note to remedy that when he returned from his concert. Then I recalled his hasty exit from our rooms not five minutes earlier. Upon seeing the young lady, he had suspected the conversation would take this turn, I had no doubt. I applied my pencil to the paper with irritation, as Miss Robson continued.
My heart was racing. God, I wanted to, so very much. I moved my fingers against his cheek. ‘I should go to my room.’
I managed a small smile and silence fell over the room again.
bi, John, you either are or you aren’t.’
‘Are you alright?’ I whispered, ‘is this alright?’
I watched my newspaper disappear across the room and resigned myself to an afternoon of paperwork.
I have spoken little of the intervening years, other than to record the death of my beloved Mary. In truth this is because I have no wish to recall those dark times after Mary's death, and before Holmes' return. But now I find, in order to set this narrative in context, I must return to not one, but two periods of my life I have tried hard to forget. This story is not as others I have told of Sherlock Holmes, and will never see publication. Certainly not in our lifetimes. But given my friend's fame as a detective, I find I wish to set on a record something of him as a man. Future generations, those of a kinder time, will still marvel at these records of a unique and exceptional brain. But I would have them know something of his heart.
Sherlock says, ‘Needed a shirt.’
‘To get my nightshirt,’ I clarified quickly. ‘I can’t sleep in these clothes.’
He turned away from the fire to face me, but did not meet my eyes. He looked every inch a man awaiting a terrible sentence, and I wanted to say something, but found myself unable to speak. Any residual anger had melted away in the face of his obvious distress. He continued, ‘I want you to know that your presence at my side for these years we have spent together has been the great joy and privilege of my life. However, I understand completely your desire to end our association, and I will make no difficulty about it. You will always be welcome at Baker Street. But I wanted to.... ask your forgiveness, before you leave.’
‘We didn't save them.' Had I been more self-conscious I might have felt embarrassed by the rawness of my voice.
His network of thugs, looters, and murders shouted their approval, going off to find the warden and start the plan in motion.
The sentimental moment was broken, however, by a slight buzzing noise emanating from Sherlock bum as John lifted his glass to his lips, taking a drink while Sherlock's mouth fell open.
“Sherlock, stop looking at me like that
He heard a light cough come from below, and he swung around to see who was there. No one. This journey was becoming curiouser by the minute.
“Thank you for your permission, highness,” John teased, pinching Sherlock’s sensitive inner thigh and smiling at his yelp of surprise.
“Tug gently, swiping your thumb over the tip,” John instructed, curling Sherlock’s hand around his cock as he remained standing, Sherlock sitting between his legs on the bed, eye level with his cock.
Rosie, who had been unordinary quiet for a girl of four so far, began to shout “Sh’lock! Sh’lock!” Over and over to get his attention, so he walked over to pick up the teacup, ignoring Lestrade’s comments.
John finally sat back to appreciate his hard work, watching the slightly gaping hole proudly while listening to Sherlock’s breathless whine as he attempted to suck in enough oxygen despite the confining corset keeping him at John’s mercy.
Sherlock rushed up the stairs, careful to be quiet as he tiptoed down the corridor that became darker the father he explored. He suddenly wished he had brought a candle for light, but he would not turn back now. He opened the large oaken door at the end of the hall and, creeping forward, he found slashed portraits on the wall, one of a family of royals, and one of a young man.
Well then.
Sherlock rolled her eyes but, remembering her promise to Mrs. Hudson, obligingly went over to pick a gown.
A few minutes later, John reentered the living room with two cups of tea, one absolutely doused in sugar and one with a splash of milk, and watched Sherlock oscillating in the middle of the room, seeming unable to decide where to go, his body tensed to escape and his eyes flickering.
John reached forward to grab his delicate hand, and led him out of the darkened hallway at Leinster Gardens, smiling as the rare London sun blanketed their forms as they walked out to hail a cab.
"I will help you out, however," John cooed, reaching behind him to lift up a small gag from their toy box, "this should keep your wagging tongue in check, at least for a while."
“Sherlock, listen to me, you need to get out of here. Leave me, I’ve lived my life….”
plan.
Sherlock’s eyes light up, and John felt a sense of unease fluttering in his abdomen when Sherlock looked at him with appraising eyes for a moment, and then nodding.
“If you’re not with us, you’re against us!” Moriarty said with a maniacal grin, and the crowd cheered in agreement. A group of Moriarty’s gang grabbed at Sherlock and Siger and drew them forward to the cage meant for the asylum, Sherlock fought back, kicking at his captors shins and aiming for their eyes, but all he received in return was a punch in the stomach and a cut on his neck from a knife.
You would think that I would have become numb to the emotions I felt after losing someone. That it would get easier as time went on. But it didn't. It still hasn't. The pain intensifies every single fucking time it happens. This time was't any different.
"I don't." I respond immediately. Standing up, I hold my hand out to Dr Pace, waiting for her to shake it. "Thankyou," I say and I am leaving, pulling out my phone and texting Lestrade.
"Sherlock," John spoke, lowering himself onto one knee as he did so. He released a nervous chuckle, which soon turned into another cough. As soon as he had composed himself, John continued to speak. "Shit. Ok. I love you, Sherlock Holmes."
At 03:11am, Lestrade phoned. “Any news?”
Sherlock scoffed. “Of course Mycroft sent you to do this.” He slammed his fist against the wall, cracking his knuckles and breaking the skin. He didn’t seem to care. “When will you stop listening to him?” The anger had broken through now and it became apparent that he wasn’t going to calm down any time soon. “Is he incapable of keeping his nose out of other people’s business?”
His hand closes on an appropriate shirt of John’s. It’ll be too short and too broad, but that won’t be noticeable under his jumper and coat and it’ll stop that awful Donovan making comments about – his eye catches a flash of silver at the bottom of the drawer.
‘You need to sleep,’ he said quietly. I murmured noncommittal agreement, but made no move. Resting in his arms, in front of our fire, was far too seductive, and I could happily have slept standing in place. He loosened his grip and gently moved me towards the door. ‘Go to bed.’
My release came on me quickly, and he was not far behind, rutting against my still sensitive organ until he came, stifling his cry against my chest. He cleaned us both, and held me until my shaking stopped and I slept.
So it was in 1894, less than a month after James’ letter, and not 1897 as I would later report, that a brief absence from Baker Street to attend a medical conference ended with me being summoned home by an urgent message informing me that Holmes was desperately ill.
Surely not, surely....Holmes was the bravest man I’d ever known. Surely if he wished for physical affection, he would simply find it? And he hadn’t, not in our time together, I was almost sure. The idea of him finding it outside Baker Street was enough to make me nauseous. Perhaps I should find a way to make it clear to him that.....whilst not expected......even hoped for......would be greatly welcome.....long desired....
Her smile faded slightly and she said hesitantly. ‘As I said sir, I don’ know what Mr Holmes’ fees are. I haven’t got-‘
I waved this off. ‘My dear fellow, don’t give it another thought. Now, you know of my adventures through the Strand. You must tell me of yours.’
He stood, and moved jerkily away. ‘What does it matter? The case is over.’
My voice breaks his frozen posture and he practically hurls himself across the room at me, pushing me into the settee, loosening my collar, and checking my pulse. His voice, when he speaks is almost a growl.
‘My good lady, there has been a murder!’ Lestrade spluttered. I placed a restraining hand on his arm.
‘Why is it different when Holmes does it?’
John is beginning to feel like this conversation is getting away from him. He says, ‘What if you were what?’
Sherlock says, ‘You stopped.’
I tried to sound encouraging, but my enthusiasm for this interview had followed Holmes out of the door. I have recorded elsewhere the events surrounding the death of Charles Augustus Milverton, and I will not repeat them here. Suffice to say that humanity at large was well rid of a man Holmes himself described as ‘the worst man in London’. That reason alone would have been enough for Holmes to refuse to take the case when Lestrade brought it to us. However, whilst we had not condoned the act, we had been present for the murder and knew exactly who had ended that odious life, and equally had no desire to see that fine lady brought to the attention of the law. I began to mentally compose excuses, even as a part of my brain wondered at Milverton inspiring such loyalty in a servant.
I told him.
I smile at him and hear myself say quietly, happily, ‘I love you.’
We were mindless then, rutting against each other. I fumbled to open our trousers, and my hand found his hardness. I had never touched another man, and the feeling of soft skin around that hardening organ made me moan aloud. He brought his hand between us, and grasped us both. The feel of his cock against mine as he frigged us made the building heat in my body pool in my groin. I whimpered against his neck and he found my mouth again as I began to sob incoherently, ‘God, yes, please, yes.'
James stood abruptly, walked back to the desk, poured himself another brandy and downed half of it, before saying, ‘Frankly, I doubt that’s true of anyone, deny it as they might.’ He sighed. ‘Just talk to him, John. I think you may find he is not as opposed to the softer emotions as he would have you believe. And even if he is, I believe you will find yourself the exception.’
He stood, and squeezed my shoulder in response. ‘Any time, my friend.’
My regimental colleague, Dr James Paulson, was a slightly older, more experienced field surgeon who had seen war across two continents. I was fortunate to have his guidance at my side, but there were days when even he was overwhelmed by the blood and pain. On one such day, we had not managed to save any of the poor men who ended on our table. Time after time, we fought and lost until we were both exhausted. When the casualties stopped coming, he took my arm, and led me away from the carnage to his private room, and sat me down. I noticed then that I was trembling beyond my ability to control, and I wasn't sure I could stand again. Somewhere, he had found brandy, and was pressing it into my hands.
James set down his glass. He said, in a voice I had heard him use to break bad news to patients, ‘John. What happened?’
‘Sherlock,’ I whispered, ‘If this is too soon-‘
‘Holmes,’ I called after him as he vanished through our sitting room door. ‘
Sherlock is standing in front of him, tension in every line of his body. He looks like he’s seconds from breaking from the room. It's that, more than anything, that decides him. He’s had enough of losing people.
There was a strange surrealism to our lives for a while. I felt sometimes as if I was living two entirely different, but parallel, lives with two entirely different, but identical, men. In the daytime, all proceeded entirely as usual. I attended my patients, and my club, and followed Holmes on most of his cases. I disciplined myself to look at Holmes no more than usual, to address him no differently than I would have before. I drew a firm line in my head between our days and nights. To do otherwise would court disaster.
He grinned. ‘There’s a reason I was never called to the diplomatic service.’
He had come back too soon, and in such a mood. I had not planned what to say, and my vague sentences withered before his clear gaze.
‘We talked about ‘is business, an’ my family, an about when we was kids, an about the future,’ - I began to wish I had been a fly on the wall for these conversations – ‘An about my place, you know, the master an’ the house. This went on for nearly two weeks, ‘an ‘Arry kept comin’ round, jealous as anythin’ he was, but I wouldn’t hear a word against John.’ I started slightly at my name, forgetting that Holmes had used it for his romantic alias. I realised that I had put my pencil down and was just listening to her narrative, but she seemed not to have noticed.
She sat up a little straighter. ‘Yes, sir. His name was John Escott, and he was a plumber by trade.’
Holmes looked at me evenly, then glanced away. He said quietly, ‘Indeed.’
James listened in sympathetic silence. I have no idea how long I spoke but he did not interrupt, and barely moved other than to drink. The words rushed out and I found myself recalling my experiences after Reichenbach, being more open with James than I had been with anyone since my wife. And there were confessions I could make to James that I could never have made to my beloved Mary.
Holmes was watching me as I looked up. ‘Perhaps then we should invite him to dine at Baker Street?’
She collected herself and fished in her purse, retrieving a slightly crumpled piece of paper and handing it to me with care. ‘This is me new position. It’s a lovely house, an’ the mistress is ever so nice, much better than the master as was.’ She smiled at me, and I felt absurdly glad that Milverton’s death, for all that it had benefitted the rich and powerful across London, had also benefitted this kindly young woman.
This most un-Holmsian display of sociability took me by surprise and I blurted, ‘No! No, that won’t be necessary, I’m sure. He’s probably not even in town for long.’ This was untrue. Even a quick glance at the letter revealed the address of his rented rooms and his intent to stay in London for the foreseeable future.
I said in surprise, ‘Not at all. I would have been delighted to see you.’
‘Alright Watson, let’s have it.’ He waved a hand. ‘Hearing you accuse me of trifling with a young lady’s affections cannot possibly be worse than the scrapings of Signor Picarello.’
He breathed out, then said, ‘Of course.'
I frowned. ‘James, I’m not sure w –‘
And not only speechless, but positively incoherent. I looked at him in surprise. ‘You were convinced of it.’ It wasn’t a question.
I opened my eyes, more awake now. He was staring at the ceiling and his face was shadowed in the darkness, but his eyes glittered in the dim light from the street lamps that broke through the curtain.
He stared 'Watson-'
‘Oh no, thank you, sir, and I’ll stand if I may.’ The young lady’s voice was hesitant, but firm. I had the impression she was trying to modulate her voice to sound as well spoken as possible and I warmed to her.
‘What have you done? Oh God, Watson, what have you done?’
‘I was so pleased to hear ‘e was ‘appy and well and’– she blushed prettily – ‘that he thought so kindly of me, and Harry, too, for all ‘arry mistrusted ‘im. I wanted to thank you, and Mr Holmes, for sendin’ on his letter, and for sendin’ on the lovely necklace. I ‘ope you don’t think less of us, but we did sell it, as we wanted a proper weddin’ like, an’ we ‘ad enough for money towards our own little place, too, as we never thought we would –‘ she broke off. Her eyes were shining, and I smiled at her obvious joy.
Sherlock huffed at that, and internally John had to agree, Sherlock was not known to be temperate. However, Sherlock was too lucid if he was still poking fun at the poems.
Sherlock took his time suckling on the head, drinking down John’s precome in a way that should have been illegal; Sherlock’s lips stretched around his cock in a pornographic fashion and moaning, his eyes fluttering closed in pleasure as John watched transfixed.
I hope you all had a wonderful Pride month last month, and I wish you all the best.
“Really, John? Even for you, this is a bit romantic,” Sherlock scoffed, attempting and failing to ignore the way his heart raced at the poem John chose.
But sometimes at night, lying in his bed and yearning for Sherlock, he wished…
'Of course he would be a bloody natural at this' John scoffed inwardly, finding the virginal detective's natural proclivity towards sexual acts both frustrating and unsurprising. After all, if anyone would be a quick study, it was Sherlock Holmes.
John watched him wiggle for a moment, softening his blows to the hole into small taps, his fingers tickling lightly against the hole and watching as shivers erupted over Sherlock’s muscled back at the action.
He really needed to finish his paperwork. But, denying Sherlock anything was difficult these days, especially when he was practically salivating for John's cock.
“Sherlock? What are you….?“
Sherlock began to shake his head, looking up to his father with a beseeching expression, “Papa, I cannot take this. It must have cost a significant sum, and I know we cannot afford such-“
Sherlock, however, had a different idea. Clutching John close to him, Sherlock traced the seam of John's lips with his tongue, seeking entrance which John gave with a low groan. Sherlock slide his velvety tongue into John's mouth, the two of them sucking and gently nipping at one another's mouth, both feeling the first throbs of arousal swirling in their groins as they continued to passionately kiss.
John thought.
John smiled. Victory.
“His name is John,” she admitted, “but do not call him that lightly, the master detests being reminded of his past self.”
The sleeping young man began to stir, sensing he was not alone in the room, his eyes blearily opening to see John standing a few feet away, a look of awe and all consuming hunger on his face.
The famous Beauty and the Beast dancing scene; I hope I did it justice.
Moriarty held up his hand for silence, and the entire pub watched on: “Very well Siger, we believe you. We will even help you
‘I adore this ridiculous man’ John thought as Sherlock grumbled slightly in his seat at John’s ability to surprise him.
“J-John please- please-“ he whimpered, biting his lips to try and stem the moans falling from his plush mouth, but John would have none of it. Biting on one fleshy cheek, John reprimanded Sherlock.
Sherlock’s tears fell faster, blurring his vision, and he blinked them away in annoyance as they were obscuring his view of John. Sherlock wished he could say everything would be wonderful, but his mind knew that John was dying.
“Can we go play now?” Rosie asked sweetly, and Sherlock didn’t have it in his heart to ignore the girl.
, and allowing his self-loathing to spread throughout his body, feeling sickness rolling in his stomach at the memories of all the times he had shut himself away from John without realizing it.
“Unzip my pants, and take me out,” John instructed with a growl, and Sherlock gently unzipped the fabric, cognizant of John’s erection, and gently pulled out the impressive length from its confines. Sherlock felt saliva pooling in his mouth at the sight of the reddening member, and leaned forward to kiss lightly at the tip where precum was gathering.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stuck his tongue out immaturely in response to Sherlock teasing, “yes, how else will anyone know I’m bi? I needed all the colors, you prat,” John lightly reprimanded, fiddling with his cuffs once more before walking forward to grab Sherlock’s hand, which felt clammy in his own.
he heard his brother's voice in his head once again.
"Come now Sherlock" he sighed as if Sherlock was letting him down by not confiding in him,"you and I both know that's not quite true."
The two men came with a wave of release, crying out each other's names in the expansive library, their release calming their arousals. Overcome by the sensations, Sherlock sagged into John’ arms, nuzzling into his neck and allowing him to cradle Sherlock gently, leaving them whispering sweet nothings to one another while curled up in the library.
Sherlock lead Philip just inside and pulled the Beast, who was regaining consciousness, to the floor of the foyer, ignoring his groan of pain and calling for Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade to help.
Blood rushed to Sherlock’s face and he turned his face back to the wardrobe, “anything else?”
- the panties acting as a tease, just hiding the furled entrance just behind the scrap of silk. Settling his body down along Sherlock back, John began to kiss at his nape while the bulge in his pants ground down against Sherlock’s mostly bare arse.
‘And not simply as a close friend.’ He continued more quietly. ‘As a friend, I would be doing you a disservice if I didn’t suggest that you go back and tell him so, plainly and without evasion. It may be that you end up leaving Baker Street anyway, but at least you would be doing so honestly, with all out in the open between you. And in that circumstance, I would of course be delighted to see you, in whatever ....capacity..... you wished to room here.’ He looked away then, into the fire.
‘He’s well, sir, Mr Holmes?’ She was watching me, suddenly serious faced. ‘And ‘appy, like?’
He handed me a glass, took the chair nearest to me in front of the fire, and we drank in companionable silence. After a few minutes, James drained his glass and set it down, leaning back in his chair.
Sherlock looks at him for a long moment, then shakes his head.
I didn’t look at him as I left.
I wanted to hit him. I wanted to throw myself weeping into his arms.
He spoke then, still without looking up. ‘No.’ I froze in the action of reaching for his arm. Quickly he reached out, caught my outstretched hand in both of his, and held it tightly. ‘There is nothing to forgive.’
“I-I am sorry, sir, I had no idea. I never would have-“
“There, all clean,” John murmured in the quiet backroom, the only sounds now the two of them sharing breathes back and forth, their chest rising and falling together.
Always a keen mate, Lestrade nodded with a smile of congratulations on his face, and turned back to Sherlock, refocusing on the issue at hand.
was all you needed tonight, just a little vanilla sex."
“I wondered if you might join me for breakfast,” John asked evenly, watching Sherlock for signs of reluctance, but the young man’s face lit up.
“Come, John. We have a case to solve.”
Sherlock’s eyes darkened, mounting Philip and grabbing a touch from a nearby stall, “we will see. I love you, papa.”
"Goodbye Papa" he said quietly, releasing the man and helping him collect his bags and tie them to the horse's saddlebag. Sherlock glanced once more over his father's figure, making sure he was bundled enough for the cold ride through the night. He Sherlock was satisfied, he helped his father up onto the saddle.
John stared at the nervous girl, uncomprehending in the face of the nervous chatter.
As he was looking around for anything of value, he heard a man yell in his ear, “
He felt his cheeks and the bridge of his nose begin to blush in embarrassment, much to John's pleasure as he leaned down to give Sherlock's nose a sweet peck in complete contradiction to his sexual prowess.
“Papa! Sh’lock! Cake now?” She demanded, and Sherlock picked her up with a laugh, allowing her to wrap her legs around his waist as he carried her, holding John’s hand tightly as they walked back down the aisle from whence they came.
John began to trust his hips gently, slowly, into Sherlock wet, suckling mouth, until he could control himself no longer.
“Your mouth should be illegal, my little slut,” John growled, carding his thick fingers through Sherlock’s curls and throwing his head back in abandon, moaning as Sherlock works his pink, glistening mouth along John’s throbbing manhood.
Yes, Sherlock thought with a little grin, his hands perched beneath his chin in a thoughtful manner, tonight Sherlock would surprise John.
He observed Sherlock for a moment longer, watching him clutch his abdomen as if he thought he would be sick and then, his realization dawning as he looked down to see his arousal, a light flush gracing his delicate cheekbones and his mouth opening to form an "oh."
“You know, when I was a girl, my mother had grand dreams of me growing up and marrying to have a family of my own,” John supplied, apropos of nothing.
He gave Sherlock a roguish grin, a 5 o’clock shadow resting upon his cheek as a peered up at the panting detective.
” Smirking wickedly as he lowered his mouth, pulling the thin silk string away from Sherlock’s opening and breathing on the vulnerable hole, reveling in Sherlock’s helpless gasp and captivated in watching the entrance pulse and clench in nervousness. He lowered his head, kissing the hole briefly, so sweetly, before beginning to ravish the rosebud with affection, locking his lips around it and humming in pleasure, holding Sherlock’s hips up and smiling at his unending moans of pleasure mixed with absolute shock, his face heating at his own enjoyment of the unspeakably dirty act.
By the time the King’s Guard arrived, the Valwald had pillaged the town and stolen the crops and any salvageable goods with them, transporting them across the hostile boarder. They set fire to the village, watching the wooden roofs of the market burn as people rushed around in a panic. The ruthless soldiers took their livelihoods away in a wash of smoke and ash.
“Sherlock,
John started to undress for a moment, but decided to wait, taking off his jacket and unbuttoning the top few buttons on his white shirt, taking off his boots and lounging back onto the bed, pleased that the servants had been able to fix the room so quickly.
Every day, every single day, she plotted to find a new way around her brother’s overbearing rules and regulations, stealing unassuming servant dresses in the servant’s quarters and scouting to find a perfect place to scale the stone walls surrounding the palace.
(See the end of the chapter for
Both men leaned against the foyer wall, panting and willing their heartbeats to settle.
Men and women openly holding hands, kissing and dancing as a Drag Queen sang “I Will Survive” over on the stage lit up with hundreds of rainbows.
Sherlock could come twice in a row, without a refractory period. Good lord, it was like a sinful dream John never wished to be waken from.
But Sherlock and Mycroft both knew that, if the situation had been even slightly different, they would be completely alone.
, oh,
As Sherlock stalked into the ballroom, and her name was announced, she greedily took in the rush of deductions that entered her mind and ignored the smattering of applause.
at the friction as he pushed his index finger, wrapped in the cloth, fully inside and carefully pulled his finger out, leaving the cloth peaking obscenely between Sherlock's plush arsecheeks.
If he and Sherlock ever became
John relaxed back into her seat, and allowed Sherlock's music to wash over her, before announcing her intention to go to bed. Sherlock watched her go and, after a few minutes more of playing, cautiously went to climb the stairs up to John's room.
daddy!”
John quickly unbuttoned his already wrinkled trousers and pulled them down along with his underwear, leaving Sherlock sitting in the chair completely nude, his glistening back rubbing against the leather of his armchair.
Sherlock took a shuttering breath, clutching closer to the beast and curling up beside him, placing his head on his chest and whispering the words he had been waiting to utter his whole life, the life he had spent dreaming of a happily ever after that would never come: “I love you, John.”
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.
So John began to drop subtle (or not so subtle, really) hints around the consulting detective after almost a year of their living together at 221B. First, he began to linger when he handed Sherlock his morning tea, inwardly smirking in the shocked blinking the detective would do before he dropped his hands away.
