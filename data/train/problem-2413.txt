Sherlock followed Doctor Carlton, his mind still reeling from John's reaction, letting himself be led into a nearby office. He sat down, declining the offer of a drink, while Carlton put what Sherlock assumed to be John's medical file on to the table. Faced with Sherlock's impatience, Carlton dispensed with further pleasantries.
“People are not really aware of things changing”, he said in a quiet, rumbling voice, still looking out of the window. “I can't imagine how this must feel to you.” He hesitated. “If there is anything I can do...”
This chapter is dedicated to random_nexus, who kept poking me until I wrote it.
Next item on the agenda. Looking around he spotted a small copse of trees with some undergrowth, ideal for his use. Half-hidden behind one of the trees he unzipped, giggling as he imagined pissing on some poor sleeping squirrel – did squirrels sleep on the ground, he wondered, or in trees? He couldn't quite remember now, and he giggled again. Yes, having a few pints had been a rather good idea.
Good Lord, he's still so young, Lestrade thought as Sherlock practically leaned into his touch, eyes closed, in what for Sherlock amounted to a nervous break-down. "Sherlock", he said gently, "John is still there, somewhere, and he needs you. Don't you dare abandon him." He shook Sherlock's shoulder and tried to reach for the silver lining. "Be glad that whatever happened to him, John is not dead. I'd hate for him to become one of our cases."
Doctor Carlton looked around at the slowly dispersing crowd of nurses and patients. “We have been trying to reach Doctor Watson's next of kin, but - “
All the frustration and unexamined sentiment Sherlock was feeling suddenly came to a head and, dropping the cigarette, he rounded on Lestrade, eyes blazing and voice full of barely suppressed anger. "This is not John stepping out for a quick jog around Regent's Park, Lestrade. John has for reasons unknown forgotten or suppressed
“No time, Mycroft”, Sherlock said as he stepped out and hurried into the building. “I'm sure I'll find out whatever I need to know from his doctors.” He hung up and went in to ask for directions to John's room.
The final item in the hospital bag was a black jacket with what looked like leather shoulder patches. He held it up and turned it around, and found that the back was not only dirty with ground-in blood and dirt, but that it also had a long tear on one side. Beyond saving, he decided, and realised that his old self would probably feel gutted to lose such an obviously well-worn jacket, but he stuffed it back into the plastic bag together with the socks and pants and dropped them into the bin in the corner.
If he had thought it weird to step into an unknown flat he was supposedly living in, it was nothing compared to going into his – old-John's – room.
I suck in a breath, and I run.
Sherlock just sighs, even as he slips his arms in and wraps the too-big coat tight around his chest. “Honestly, this jacket would have looked unforgivable even in the year you received it. Which, based on its color combination, I suspect was 1982.”
“You know, I remember that day,” she finally says. I can hear Sherlock whisperin’ to Wilma in the next room. “That time we met Scott, when you was gonna take us to the pool. You and him was talkin’ after you introduced us, sayin’ something I couldn’t hear, and then he was getting back in his truck and he drove clear away, back the way he came.”
“I’m sorry I –”
So why had he been so jealous? So pathetically lonely surrounded by thousands of applauding hands, John’s face and name on the screen in dazzling gold?
She smirks, a bit proud of herself. I don’t blame her. “You always reach up to try to adjust them after a Visit,” she explains. “I was able to get my hands on an old photo of you. Found some I thought might be a close match.”
John looks over, startled, to see another athlete in Ukrainian ski suit colors lifting a hand to apologize. John haphazardly grins and nods he’s okay, then watches as the man uses his one arm to lift himself on the railing and share a deep, wet kiss with the woman leaning down on the other side. She grabs handfuls of his suit, whispering into his mouth.
“He’s a roughneck, then?” I say, teasin’ her. I’ve forgotten how good it feels to talk to someone.
“I’m in love with him,” he says, holding his own gaze in the mirror.
Only, it isn’t dark at all.
John flings open his eyes and knows he’s getting close. He pulls and twists on his cock, fire shooting through his veins, and swallows over his dry throat to keep talking, knowing Sherlock’s hanging on his every word as his tongue traces a slow, hot circle around the rim of John’s ass, barely dipping inside to lick.
But, John isn’t yelling. His jaw isn’t tight, nor is his face red. His fists aren’t even clenched. In fact, Greg’s never seen John look less furious in his life.
-They wouldn't technically be driving down the Pacific Coast Highway to get from Hermosa to Laguna. That's not really how it works. . . (I think they'd most likely take the 405, although I'm too lazy to do the research of when exactly that freeway got built). Anyways, just don't use this fic for travel advice.
“Oh, love.” John brings Sherlock’s hand up to his mouth and kisses it, holding the skin against his face. “Sherlock I don’t need to look for anyone,” he says, voice choking. “You are my family. I have you.”
“Ah, shit. You know, now’s actually not the best . . . I have to—”
By the time John’s dressed and ready he’s five minutes late, but he knows the ceremony won’t start without him, the self-importance making his skin crawl and his cheeks burn. Walking quickly past the bench where Greg pressed his face to John’s scarred thigh, he barrels through the door, forgetting to stop and brace himself at all, and nearly smacks five waiting photographers in the face.
Sherlock’s staring at him with eyes the color of the crystal glass sea. He looks young and fresh and open. He looks like the man who conquered the wave at Waimea without falling into the deep black ocean, and he looks like the man whom John woke up next to the morning after he’d finally let himself lay his hands on another man’s skin.
” Sherlock had said to him, his face in pinched agony and his cheeks pale. “
She shivers, and John suddenly places her accent as matching that Midwestern couple he’d met on their vacation out to California. Minnesota, they’d been from. Or was it Wisconsin?
When John can’t answer, his tongue numb and heavy, Greg glances at him then calls back to the doorway, “Yes—this is Watson!”
He moves his hand up my ankle, lets his fingers brush under the bottom of my jeans and rub across the hair on my legs. I want to close my eyes and moan it feels so good. Instead I look at him, letting him know I won’t let him out of the question for once.
Watson gives a gruff nod. We distantly hear one of the other guys calling his name. He quickly clears his throat and sniffs away the wetness in his voice.
“That’s one for the books!” Rick chimes in.
“Begin,” the nurse says, glancing at the clock as a timer, and John thinks about the first time he ever skied beside Sherlock Holmes, the first time he ever successfully took off and flew in the pilot’s seat, the first time he kissed Greg Lestrade in the snowy trees, and he closes his eyes and lifts up his thigh, reminding himself every second that the burning wave through his knee and calf and foot isn’t real.
Scotty does, though. The small tension he’d kept in his shoulders as they drove around all morning leaves instantly the moment he sets foot onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes and leaves them haphazard outside before running up the few steps to the still-open door. He points to the bushes next to them and says “there’s your bathroom,” even though John can see the pipework from plumbing running along the side of the hut. John rolls his eyes and catches Scotty’s self-satisfied smirk as he disappears in front of him into the hut. John takes the bait and relieves himself outside, trying to calm the sudden fluttering in his chest. When he’s done he puts one foot on the steps and pauses, feeling suddenly momentous without any clue as to why. The curiosity burns inside of him. With one last look at the ocean he steps through the front door, eyes blinking to adjust to the light.
Also, OOPS I FORGOT THE DOG. Way back in that opening scene in chapter 1, I mentioned a dog alerting in the snow. Last chapter, leading up to the crevasse, I completely forgot the poor little doggo :( Hazards of posting a WIP, I guess! I've gone back and added sweet avalanche rescue dog Elsa into the previous chapter. If you're just picking up here without a re-read  of chapter 3 (understandable), she is Simon's trained avalanche rescue dog which the team uses.
“Alright, John?”
But Greg only shakes his head and closes his eyes, as if he can’t even watch John’s groveling. He bites the inside of his cheek—a fragile gesture John can count on one hand the number of times he’s seen Greg do. “I . . . I am not angry,” he finally manages, in a voice that sounds so exhausted, so unlike the unstoppable champion the world knows. Greg fixes him with a long look, as if he’s seeing every year of John’s life, every year they were apart. Distantly, leaking water drips from one of the showers, sadly echoing off the walls. “Later,” Greg finishes in the barest whisper. His throat works. “I cannot . . . later.”
Greg opens his mouth to reply again, then stops, and he turns to John instead, a question in his eyes.
He whips out his phone as he walks, drops it into the snow, bends awkwardly to pick it up and nearly drops it again. His hands shake so hard he can barely read the screen.
“You fucking bastard, where the fuck are you going?”
I want to say a lot of things. They rush up into my throat and get stuck at the back of my tongue. Instead, I say, “Thankful you ain’t gone and broken your legs ridin’ bulls and horses for money, ‘cus I sure as hell wouldn’t have carried you up here.”
Sherlock physically stops himself from leaning closer into Johnny’s space. The man is looking up at him with a challenge, daring him to continue to prove himself as a know-it-all asshole so that Johnny can keep up with his righteous anger. Sherlock decides to go along. He files away for later the fact that seeing the furious glare in Johnny’s deep blue eyes sends a completely unfamiliar thrill up his own spine.
Greg leans over and puts a brief hand on Sherlock’s thigh through the sheet. “You know how it is,” he says, half at John and half at the far wall. “Hardly have had a moment to breathe outside the training and the prep until we got here a few days ago.”
John holds out his hand across the water and Sherlock immediately takes it, dipping their joined hands just below the surface of the waves and holding on.
“But what about you?” he grunts out. “Do you –?”
I don't think this chapter needs any notes or context :) We all know that our lil' Scotty Holmes is secretly a romantic at heart, and that he wouldn't give a shit about whether gay marriage was legal or not. And we all know that our ol' Johnny loves his life to come with a thrilling side of the unexpected.
Interviewer: “And John – were you surprised by his initial reaction? He is normally so calm, from what we have seen.”
He looks like the dictionary definition of youth. Glorious mind burning and brilliant in the sun. I allow myself to smile. My voice is slightly choked. “It is,” I agree.
Qu’est-ce ce que tu ne comprends pas quand je dis « je suis en réunion » ?    :   What part of 'I am in a meeting' did you not understand?
Sherlock lets out a breathy laugh and runs his nose along John’s, trailing his fingers through the hair on John’s chest with one hand while the other grips under his thigh. He opens his eyes and John wants to gasp gazing down into them. Wants to press his lips right onto his eyelids and feel his eyelashes brushing against his mouth. The eyes that only he gets to see.
John flinches and rubs the back of his neck. He speaks down softly at his board. “That obvious, huh?”
John is competing in the Paralympics in the sport of Biathlon, which is so wildly complicated to explain (especially for the Paralympics) that I will wait until it's absolutely necessary. For now, though, just know it consists of a cross-country skiing race (as opposed to Alpine / Downhill skiing, which Sherlock does) interspersed with shooting a gun at a target. Yes, that really is the sport. Much more info to come, and many more answers!
To his surprise, Sherlock laughs, his stomach vibrating against John’s. “Damn,” Sherlock sighs. “Thought it would take you much longer to figure that out.”
“Alright, John, Christ, this lecture will make us late for the flight. You know that’s not at all what I meant, if you’d just think about something before gut-reacting. You honestly think
The ocean continues to pound at his back, rushing in over and over again onto the sand, covering his feet with tingling foam. He lets them pat his back and reach out to touch his board bobbing in the shallows like a trophy. He hears their words and cheers like one giant sound, crackling in his ears and blowing against his face. Sherlock isn’t even sure what he says, how he looks. If he smiles or waves or says,
John pulls back and looks up at Sherlock, knocking the wind out of him for the tenth time that day.
Sherlock only has time to throw back his head and cry out—he’s hard; harder than he’s ever been in recent memory, possibly in his entire twenty-eight years of life—and then Greg’s mouth is over him, swallowing him down, the medal resting between Sherlock’s thighs.
” Greg licks a wet stripe up John’s neck.
The air is punched from Greg’s lungs. He shakes at John’s firm grip pumping his pulsing cock. He melts. “John,
John’s objectionable jumpers, and John’s little curly hairs behind his ear when he lets his regular haircut slide, and John’s tongue wetting his bottom lip, and John’s jaw when he shoots a gun. When he watches Greg ski.
Sherlock hates his own lungs for clenching at the sound of the friend’s name, flinching away from it like it’s some sort of intrusion. It makes him feel like a child, clapping his hands over his ears to block out the sound of the word “chores.”
Greg frowns. “But you were up there with me between the runs . . .? Ah,
When he gets back to his house he throws his keys haphazardly across the room and goes to make a cup of coffee when he stops dead in his tracks.
The camera tracks down to the sight of a helicopter resting on the helipad, glowing brilliant red with the early rays of the sun.
Sherlock was of the firm opinion that the lift taking him up to the ward John was in was probably the slowest in the whole of the United Kingdom. He was through the lift doors before they had completely opened, down a corridor and into a waiting area when he heard the commotion further down the ward. He started running when he recognised one of the voices as John's, who sounded pained and in distress.
The doctor obviously realised that Sherlock hadn't heard him. “I said”, he repeated, “I'm Doctor Carlton. Do you know John Watson?”
“Sherlock, that was the police.” Sherlock raised an enquiring eyebrow.
“Hello?… Yes, speaking. What?… Of course. I’ll be there.” He cut the connection with a sigh. Apparently, it was his week for getting out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Carlton was obviously still searching for the right words to explain what had happened to John when the man at the door spoke in a rough baritone voice. “What Doctor Carlton is trying and failing to tell you, John, is that you have amnesia. You have forgotten the last ten years of your life.”
"Ah, John, you're back!", Sherlock shouted as he pounced on John who was leaning heavily on the bed caught between pain, exhaustion and exasperation.
“Interesting”, Sherlock said. “It must be a more recent development then, probably because...” He stopped himself in time. No use informing John of the more disturbing events of his life in the past ten years than he'd already inadvertently managed to do. John, however, would not let him off the hook that easily. “Because what?” he asked, then put another forkful of the chicken-and-vegetables into his mouth, seemingly unconcerned. “Does this have to do with you being my medical proxy, instead of her or my parents?”
"Hey", John said, smiling back and leaning down to give her a peck on the cheek. "Get you another?" he asked, waving at her half-empty glass.
Sherlock woke up to the sound of his mobile phone. He sat up and stretched, trying to get the crick out of his neck. It seemed that he wasn't used to sleeping on the sofa any more. He looked at the mobile – it was eight o'clock, he had slept disgustingly late and John hadn't come home last night. Sherlock was annoyed, but he supposed that it was to be expected. John would most likely indulge in breakfast with his date.
“I'll take that as a yes, then”, John said and picked up the glass of orange juice. “Oh this is vile”, he said after tasting it, “I'm not having that no matter how nutritious it might be. Could I have a glass of water, please?”
", whenever there was a tense situation between them, and he nodded. "So maybe this is just his way of dealing with, you know, all this", Lestrade made a vague motion with his hands, "and he'll be back once he's calmed down."
The barmaid looked at him, and he imagined seeing pity in her eyes. That wouldn't do, he decided, and waved at her to get a bag of crisps and another pint.
Sherlock Holmes read the message with a disgusted snort. “John's not coming”, he told Lestrade. “Obviously, he feels his date to be of more importance than the case.” He put his phone away and pulled on a pair of nitrile gloves.
“Yeah”, John said. In for a penny.... “It smells... familiar. Safe.” He blushed. “I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... Here, have it back.” He started to take off the coat, but a hand on his arm stopped him. “No”, Sherlock said, “It's fine. You need all the safety you can get right now. But you're right, the coat's too large for you to wear comfortably. You can have my scarf next time we go out.”
“Sherlock?” Lestrade had come back and was now looking at him with slight concern. “You seem distracted. Is this about the case?”
“John was found outside Barnard Park shortly after four o'clock this morning”, Mycroft's infuriatingly calm voice came through the phone. “It appears he was assaulted and mugged while on his way home from wherever he was last night.”
If I may ask you, dear readers - would you prefer more frequent updates with much shorter chapters, or would you rather have the longer chapters I tend to write, but have longer time between updates?
A slow smile spread over John's face. He and Siobhan had been introduced by a friend they had in common, had hit it off immediately, and had been going out together for almost two months. Siobhan was pretty much the opposite of Sherlock – petite, with long blonde hair and a wonderful Northern Irish lilt in her voice, and though she was intelligent, in her case it translated into an wild curiosity for the arts and history and an enthusiasm to share what she knew. They had formed an easy, almost instant friendship, and on their last memorable evening together, John found out that she was an equally enthusiastic lover. Now she wanted to meet with him on Saturday evening. John's smile grew wider as he typed out a reply.
Sherlock nodded back. “Of course I will.”
(See the end of the chapter for
To his credit, Sherlock looked slightly embarrassed. “One of the first things I knew about Harriet, and which you confirmed, is that she is an alcoholic. I'm sorry. She probably wasn't ten years ago, was she.”
Sherlock sat unmoving until John's breathing became deep and regular, then waited some more to make sure that John was really asleep and not just faking it. He wouldn't put it past the man he knew to pretend to sleep while waiting for his chance to escape. After a while, when it became clear to Sherlock that John had well and truly succumbed to the mixture of physical injuries, emotional exhaustion and Diazepam, he got up and went out of John's hospital room, locking the door quietly and leaning against it. He closed his eyes for a moment, realising that John wasn't the only one who was emotionally exhausted.
A connection between the victims, finally something resembling a lead. Sherlock hurriedly washed, dressed in fresh clothes and was out the door hailing a cab within ten minutes of waking up. Once in the cab towards Bart's, he sent a message to John's phone: “Bart's morgue. Meet me after breakfast.” Sherlock supposed that that would be sufficient, any further explanations would have to wait until John got there.
“Oh.”
Short story, not abandoned.
“Mmm. Bad luck it didn't work out the way it does in James Bond films.”
A few cautious steps brought him to the bathroom. He used the toilet, then inspected his body.
“So, I joined the Army, then.” John said after a while. “Any idea why?”
They are glowing.
They say that there are an infinite number of universes.
Carlton shook his head. "Exactly. Whatever is keeping you from remembering, it's not physical."
Carlton shook his head. “We don't know where your friends are, but as far as we can tell you are the only one who's in hospital.” He looked closely at John. “Now, I think you did enough for the moment. You have a lot of healing to do, Doctor Watson, and he sooner you start the better.” He filled the cup again and handed it to John with two pills. “That's something for the pain, and then I think you should get some more sleep.”
Sherlock took his cue. “Of course. Don't worry, Mrs Hudson. John just needs some painkillers and a bit of a nap. Come on, John, you need to sit down.” He steered John towards the stairs and up to the first floor while Mrs Hudson was still fussing, wondering what John would say to the flat.
This was too strange for John, and when he came back with the Ikea bag of freshly-laundered clothes and saw Sherlock leaning intently over his microscope, he decided to mention it.
John was inspecting his hands, trying to look past the scratches to the skin beneath. He never really looked at his hands, he mused, they were always sort of there, but he could remember the nick he'd gotten when a scalpel slipped from his grasp, the haematoma under the fingernail of his right thumb from where he'd caught it in the door to his room, the brownish-yellow nicotine stains between his left index and middle fingers from the cheap roll-ups he was smoking. None of these were there.
A nod of agreement.
While Carlton spoke, John became more and more confused. He was sure that Carlton's assessment of what had happened to him was right, he certainly felt bruised and battered enough. Something felt wrong, though, and John latched on to that. “Barnard Park, you said? Where is that?”
Sherlock was about to return the phone to his pocket when it rang again. He checked the caller ID, then answered it with a sigh of irritation. “Yes, Detective Inspector?”
of here! Let me go! What the bloody hell has happened to me? No, don't
“Don't make me regret this, Doctor Watson, Mister Holmes.” Carlton went to leave. “I'll have a nurse come in with some food and your medication.” He looked at Sherlock. “Shall we talk later, Mister Holmes?”
John was stunned. “Jesus, Harry, you beat someone up so much they had to be taken to hospital?” He couldn’t believe it. His sister was an alcoholic, yes, but she had never been violent. Thankfully, his outburst had silenced Harry for the moment.
And a cliff hanger, of sorts. Because I am that evil. ;)
“Breathe, John.” Sherlock was kneeling at his side. “There is no need to panic. Nothing happened.”
“Even then. Sherlock, you insist that you're my friend. So come on. If you want to have it in writing, I'll happily sign a waiver. I have got to know, don't I? If only to avoid running into people I should know, like your landlady downstairs, and not having one hell of a clue how to react.”
John felt a  pricking sensation in his hands and realised that he was clenching his fists tightly enough to push his fingernails into his palms. He was past anger and into a cold fury the likes of which he hadn’t felt since Afghanistan, when he had found out that a shipment of essential medical supplies had not been delivered due to the supply officer’s incompetence, and John had been forced to amputate a man’s leg when he could have saved it.
John looked at him curiously but accepted the coat. “You do realise it's rather large for me?”
Carlton looked at Sherlock, then sighed. “We don't know. The brain is a fickle thing, Mr Holmes. We can assume, we can extrapolate from other, similar cases. But we don't know for certain if and when Dr Watson will remember the last ten years.” He looked down at his notes and shuffled them around distractedly. “Mr Holmes, I have to ask you. Has Dr Watson been under unusual stress lately?”
read the first one. John sighed when he read it, folded it up into his wallet, and got the milk.
Surprised, Sherlock looked at him directly. “How it smells?” he asked, eyebrow raised.
“You'd better”, Lestrade groused. “While you're having fun cracking the case, I'm the one who has to sit in front of a horde of journalists explaining that someone is treating people like anatomical models and why we haven't stopped him yet.”
Sherlock turned to face the wall again. “You don’t need to worry about money, John. My own finances are more secure than you realise, and there really is no need for you to work. If you’d like, I will take over your share of the rent, that should make you more comfortable.”
“A street cleaner found the bag”, Lestrade told Sherlock and John when they arrived at the crime scene, ducking under the blue and white police tape. “Thought someone had been fly tipping. The bag ripped when he tried to lift it, and well… See for yourselves.” Lestrade cleared his throat and waved a hand towards where the Forensics team were clustered. “And you definitely want to wear gloves for this one”, he told them as they walked closer.
Harry kept her body still, but she started talking again in that alcohol-fuelled stream of consciousness that John tried to ignore as best he could.
John considered the empty pint glass in his hand, considered the week he'd had, considered briefly the consequences there would be if he did what he was about to do.
Lestrade winced at Sherlock's even, emotionless tone, knowing that it disguised the emotions that lay beneath. "John is a fighter, Sherlock", he said. "But he does this thing, right, of taking a break when he needs to." Sherlock could hear John's voice in his head saying, "
“Ah yes”, Sherlock realised why John had hesitated. “Your room is upstairs. Bathroom's down here, down the hall to the left. I'll get the kettle on in the meantime.”
Sherlock didn't reply. He walked over to where the second body had been found, the black bin bag opened to reveal the victim, and crouched down to inspect the scene. He admitted to himself that Lestrade might have a point. Since the body of Gavin Walsh had been discovered, John had become increasingly distraught. Then there was the situation with Harry, though John had made it clear that he didn't want to discuss it with him. Furthermore, John had insisted that Sherlock not disturb him while he was out on the date, but Sherlock had been convinced that John would want to know about the second victim. He resolved to make it up to John somehow, even though the last time he had offered to help just a few days ago it had resulted in a terrible row.
That was easy. “Bart's teaching hospital, London. Do you want the post code? And call me John, please.” He grinned too. His head might be pounding, but he was not above a little flirting.
Sherlock sat up in one fluid motion, studying John with interest. “You don’t like this.” It was a statement, not a question.
“That's beside the point, and you know it. You were an idiot for taking the pill in the first place.”
Sherlock settled back into the chair and looked down, giving John some time to adjust to his presence. He still felt annoyed at Carlton's inability to explain clearly what was going on. His friend would have wanted the information as quickly and succinctly as possible, but Sherlock hadn't anticipated the panicked reaction. He had to remind himself that this was not the John he knew, but a much younger, untempered version.
Sherlock stood dumbfounded as the nurses plucked John from his arms, laid him on a stretcher and wheeled him away. John hadn't recognised him. John
“Yes, well”, Carlton recovered, “a fugue state is a possibility that we cannot discount as yet. You will know that a fugue state is aptly named. The mind is fleeing from itself, hiding away in a different persona or in the past, to a, er, system restore point, if you will. If this is a fugue state, he may not come out of it until whatever his mind perceives as hurtful is dealt with, until he is healed...“ Carlton hesitated.
“Yes, I had the feeling I'd been waiting a long while for you this time around.”
They look at each other, grinning.
At first, the only thing John could see past Sherlock was a large black bin bag lying on the ground underneath the footbridge, but once Sherlock had crouched down to take a closer look at the victim, John was able to make out more. The bin bag had torn open to reveal a naked man, skin pale and waxy from loss of blood, deep cuts all over his body. The head was not visible, still covered by the black plastic. John frowned as he watched Sherlock pull out his magnifier and move around the body. There was something eerily familiar about the way the body had been cut, and John leaned in for a closer look.
John knew that scar. He was the one who’d put it there, cutting the trousers off the young soldier bleeding into the sand, getting the bullet out and stitching up the wound, thanking his lucky stars that the femoral artery hadn’t been nicked or the man would’ve bled out long before he’d reached him, while right next to them soldiers were firing, buying him time enough to finish his work.
“And you will, Doctor Watson. But right now, and with your consent – and that of your medical proxy, of course”, he nodded at Sherlock, “I would like to give you something to help you relax and sleep. Nothing drastic, we want you to heal, after all. ”
Both of them sobered up immediately when the door opened to admit Dr Carlton, who was carrying a folder. "Your latest MRI results", he said. John looked at him apprehensively.
John frowned. “There is a lot I need to know, Doctor. After all, I've lost ten bloody years according to you.”
"All right, thanks", Lestrade said, "care to tell me what you're on about?"
He stumbled backwards until he fetched up to the back of a chair in the living room and sank down. He had pointed a gun at someone, how could he have pointed a gun at someone, what was wrong with him...
When nothing more was forthcoming, John looked up and was surprised to see Holmes standing thunderstruck, reaching out one trembling hand to him. He sighed.
Being careful about breathing too deeply wasn't the only thing his body demanded. The water he'd been drinking made a trip to the loo a good idea. At the same time, he could check on his bruises. John admitted that he was irrationally glad that his nose hadn't been broken, but he had after all been kicked in the head, and who knew what that had done to his handsome features. He chuckled again, trying his best not to giggle outright. He hurt too much for that, but not enough to call a nurse to help him into the facilities. It would be a cold day in hell if he couldn't manage on his own, even with a few cracked ribs. Grabbing the handrails on either side of his hospital bed, he carefully pulled himself upright with a groan, then swung his legs over the edge of the bed, pausing a little to breathe against the pain and the dizziness that came from having been horizontal for too long. He found that there were no shoes or slippers by his bedside. Never mind, he'd made it this far, he wouldn't be deterred by having to walk to the loo barefoot. Holding onto the handrails for support, he put his feet on the floor – cold, why was the floor so sodding cold! - shifted his weight, let go of his support and finally stood as upright as his ribs let him. He was relieved to find his sense of equilibrium intact. So far, so good.
John kisses words onto his lips, mouth open and panting. “You don’t believe me, but I will.”
Sherlock ducks as John throws his balled-up napkin at his head, then rises on aching legs to his feet, stretching out his body with a groan. He feels lighter than air. Like he didn’t just sit there and have a conversation about dead and missing moms for the first ever time in his life. He thinks for the thousandth time that John Watson is a marvel.
Molly pushes against his arm with a frown, chiding, “Greg . . .”
They’re having the tea Simon promised, and we watch their soundless talking and easy laughter through the swelling violins of the background music. At one point, Dom puts down his mug and exaggeratedly mimics Holmes’ eyes bursting open on the stretcher, his intense coming-to-life. The rest of the table laughs, even Holmes over his tea, and Greg reaches up from beside him to wrap an arm around his shoulders.
We suddenly hear Watson scream something down towards the crevasse in the ice.
It should be embarrassing—this spectacle. It should be the epitome of everything he hates about competing; hasn’t he been saying for years that there shouldn’t be any audience? No cameras? No fanfare? Just a line of skiers and a stopwatch and a single judge to record it all in a database and call it a day?
Molly: “Most of those guys, they all grew up here near the mountains, in Zermatt or one of the other towns. They’ve seen the tragedies, some of their family or friends, and so they’ve got this respect for the mountain. And with John, from the military, he understands that risk as well.”
And this here’s the truth you need to know more than anything else:
“My man,” John whispers to him, clutching at his short hair while Greg strokes him the way he likes, quick with a hard twist at the tip. Strong.
Greg frowns. “You thought that we would not come? We texted you that we would.”
I think for a horrible second that my nurse is going to cry. That or scold me. She doesn’t, just grips my hand harder in hers. “You can have that changed, you know,” she says gently. “And even if you choose to Stay, it doesn’t have to be permanent. You can always enter your code to be Shut Off.”
“You and him seem to be very much alike,” she says softly.
Then, roughly ten seconds later:
, I’m starting to think Watson has the right idea always arguing with your ass.“
I press my shaking hands up against his heaving chest. “Please let’s get out of here.”
is here. And normally that would fill him with that foundational sense of
And now they’re here, safe and alone and far away from prying eyes and sneaky cameras, and Sherlock closes his eyes, warmth tingling through his body, when he hears muffled voices through the door.
The girl next to me leans on the bar with sequin covered shoulder pads, hair teased straight up towards the ceiling and smacking her bright pink gum. She’s smiling at me in a way I forgot people could.
“Tell me – what’s your game, Holmes? What is it? You want to help me go pro just so you can watch me get my ass handed to me by you and everyone else on the circuit for the next year? Was it pity? Do I look so depressing you felt like I needed a free meal from your blessed hands?”
We watch him walk out towards the helipad through the open hangar doors. After a few seconds, he raises his right hand into the sky and points his finger. One second later, the alarm sounds.
He also imagines how John’s wet tongue must dart out to lick his lips, glistening and slow, his soft mouth full and pink. How John must be grabbing Greg’s jaw and pulling him down to his mouth, clutching him impossibly closer while they try not to gasp too loud, not to make the mattress squeak.
Keith won a medal for it all. For saving Jack’s body for his funeral and saving John Watson’s breath in his lungs. He visited John in the hospital, holding his thin hand in the uncomfortable silence, and John clamped his mouth shut so he wouldn’t ask Keith why the hell he didn’t just leave him to rest in peace on the beach. It was hard to talk if they weren’t standing shoulder to shoulder on the starboard deck. Keith slipped a bullet casing into his hand, and neither one of them said goodbye.
do. Stay with me.”
And John is slowly backing away, convinced they’ve all completely forgotten his existence, willing himself to fade into peaceful oblivion as he carefully picks his gear bag up off the ground, when Sage-USA-BigAir throws back his head and laughs.
After you left last night, your granddaddy pulled me onto the couch. Said we could do all the cleanup later. Said I needed to sit down for five seconds and actually relax. He reminds me to do that, else I’d forget.
I think this self-imposed isolation we’ve both been under has dragged him back to a dark place sometimes – made him remember lonely, dark alleyways and sinister, empty basements from those years he spent away tracking down Moriarty’s circle. The pure relief on his face every time I enter the room is enough to tell me that these final days of his pregnancy have rendered his emotional state a little unstable, and so the result is that I haven’t left his side in going on nine days now (and yes, that includes every time I’ve had to use the damn bathroom). To most people the thought of being with Sherlock Holmes every second of the day for nine days would probably sound like a torture sentence, but luckily for me I’m very much in love with him.
They drive to the beach in silence, passing by the sleeping city covered in a veil of slowly lifting darkness, fading from black into glittering silver. For one startlingly fierce moment John almost reaches his hand out and puts it on Greg’s leg as he looks out the window, watching the trees zoom by. He lifts his hand to do it, fingers itching to land on warm, soft skin. Then he remembers it wouldn’t be the leg he’s hoping to find. He covers up the movement with a cough.
Greg doesn’t realize his eyes have glossed over until he looks back up at the slope and realizes that he can’t distinguish the skiers from the gates. He wipes a quick arm over his eyes and sniffs, tilting his head self-deprecatingly when the coach next to him says, “Ah, a cold? Bad luck, that.”
And as John shakes his head again at the ground, gritting his teeth with a harsh grunt, Greg’s eyes grow wet, and delicate words pour from his lips.
Watson looks back down, straight at the lens. His eyes shine a fierce blue against the red rimmed around his lashes. He wipes his forearm across his face, then nods again.
-The prayer Lahela says is part of The Unity Prayer translated into Hawaiian. While I got this from a source I trust, it may not be 100% accurate, so apologize if it's wrong. The prayer she says is "The power of God protects us; the presence of God watches over us."
The man grasps the rope: “Patient is alive! I’ve got audio. Patient is alive. Give me the fifteen.”
Received:
He leads me. Takes my hands and laughs as we run with abandon in the waves like kids. He leads me towards his house – warm and safe from the strong wind billowing down the beach. He doesn’t slam the door in my face. He opens it for me. Leads me inside where soft lamplight lights our path. A private universe. He presses me gently back against the wall and whispers my name and caresses my mouth with his. Tasting my sighs.
“I just
“Shh, look.” Greg grabs Sherlock’s elbow. “He is starting to ski now.”
We sighed. It was the sound of a thousand campfires together. A thousand misty mornings with the dew sliding down sunrise tent walls. There was just his mouth, and my mouth, and the warm space between the two.
He flashes a grin at the camera and interviewer, then jokingly rolls his eyes.
After another minute John mumbles “ok” into Sherlock’s skin, and they stretch out tired, sated limbs as they sit up and pull off the blanket in easy silence. John stands and marvels that the ache in his shoulder is gone, even after holding himself up over Sherlock for so long in the sand. He catches Sherlock shoot him a knowing smirk as he folds up the blanket and shakes the sand from its edges.
Greg’s face finally breaks into the smallest grin, and Sherlock wonders how many seconds he’s just stood there staring at the man.
He catches Sherlock giving him an odd look over his shoulder, and John swallows hard when it dawns on him that Sherlock’s look probably has something to do with the fact that Sherlock’s training run involves official coaches, and team jackets, and television crews, and gear maintenance teams, and an audience already in the stands. And John’s training runs involve John somehow getting himself down to the Biathlon stadium and just . . . skiing around by himself. Trying to remember everything the coach told him during the three months of training John didn’t even pay for.
Greg just looks at him for another long moment before pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“No, my expressions. Reactions.” The implied
” into his ear in a locker room, then laughed? Was it when he was thirteen and being told he couldn’t go back to his regular school, but would have a tutor so he could spend every day out on the slopes? Or was he eight, the memory now hazy with fog, when he pressed his ear up to his bedroom door and heard his parents arguing, his mother in tears, over how they would have enough money to pay for his lessons and also make rent?
“You eat yet?” I ask.
“You couldn’t imagine looking around in the eighties without glasses,” he says. Not a question.
Holmes grins, but it quickly fades.
Greg curses under his breath, shaking his head at himself. He thinks of the million reasons why watching John win a Gold medal is the happiest day of his life. Is worth every memory of loneliness. Is worth a kiss on a screen.
I read the letter every day for a month. I can hear his voice leap off the page, clear and vibrating with energy like it sounded that first summer up on Baker– how he came across the mounted Amarillo police when they was at the crime scene, how he saw all them clues they were missin’ and ran cross town for days getting all the answers for himself. How the police sheriff hated him at first and threatened to run him outta town before Sherlock turned up at his front door in the middle of the night with the bloody gloves and knife in a brown paper bag. How that same sheriff gave him a firm handshake and told him he’d call him up next time they had a case they couldn’t crack.
I guess I should probably write something about the birth, but at the same time, I highly, highly doubt I will ever forgot a second of that day. My incredible, fierce, gorgeous husband was in labor for eighteen hours, and never once did he give up, or go back to thinking he couldn’t do it, or even take me up on my numerous offers to just scratch the home birth and get to a hospital so he could get something for the pain. Even the midwives were pushing him to do it, just so that he could try and get more comfortable.
Sherlock looks vaguely embarrassed, a blush spreading up his neck, but he doesn’t back down. “Obviously, or I wouldn’t have asked.”
He clears his throat again and bends over to make his voice louder in the mic, sending up a silent prayer to who-knows-what that this plan will somehow work.
He licks into my ear and I have to bite my lips to keep from cryin’ out. I’ve never felt that before in my life. I can feel his prick hot and hard at the top of my thigh. I realize suddenly that I’ve never looked at it since that first early morning in the freezing tent, never seen it out of the shadows. I can’t look now or I’ll never look away.
“I’ll wake you up before you have to go,” he says again.
“Come on,” Sherlock says, turning back towards the punishing waves. “Watch with me. And then you can pretend to be in charge and force me to eat or stretch or some shit. Feel useful.”
God, it’s going to be fast. Bright and hot and lovely and the fresh cut of firm muscle along John’s shoulder and the rough grunts coming from his beautiful throat and the bruise and—
“Quit whining, you old grump, we’ll be ready on time. Didn’t they train you to take fifteen second showers in the Navy?” Sherlock calls through the door.
“Thanks, but – I have to go,” I finally mutter. I can’t even shoot them a smile as I go. I whip around and start to press through the thronging mass of dancing bodies, sweat and glitter and hairspray dripping onto my jumper and skin. I can feel their stares burrowing into my back. Can see their open mouths in my mind.
s’te plaît : please
Greg waits for Sherlock to look at him, but he never does. He drops his arms. And he feels he suddenly learns something about Sherlock that he’d never known before—that Sherlock is his own man. Because embarrassing as it is for Greg to admit, he hasn’t always seen him that way. Not quite.
He clutches his phone in his hand and stares unseeing at the snow. Out of nowhere, he remembers John’s face in those initial moments after Greg had stopped dead in his tracks at the edges of the trees and breathed out his name. That quick look of shocked recognition, followed immediately by a hot wave of something like shame. How Greg had stepped forward dumbly, ignoring Sherlock’s frantic, confused looks back and forth between them, then awkwardly tried to bend over and hug John in the monoski before both of them gave up and settled on a weird gloved handshake. How John had clenched his jaw and mumbled, “
The stranger stalks towards him calmly. Chin high. “No doubt you’ve noticed that Van Cleave has been Dispatched,” he says.
. Come in my hand—”
Watson: “In the . . . in the helicopter. All I could think about was you. I couldn’t . . . what if he died because I was distracted? Because I couldn’t focus, I was too –”
To their deaths.
Greg blinks, sees that Sherlock is still ignoring the rest of the world, then nods. “Of course. Let him in.”
He’s creeping down towards me, one stair at a time. The air in the darkness between us is electric. We both make our way towards the landing as the house holds its breath, waiting to see who will win. My heart beats wildly in my chest, and adrenaline fires through my veins. I can see his outline in the moonlight from the cracks in the ceiling up above, shooting down swirling beams through the thick, dusty air.
to see Sherlock’s body more clearly up on the slope before he tears his gaze away and looks desperately to the screen instead.
But there isn’t the sound of skiing behind him. And when Greg glances back at Sherlock, the lightness dies in his chest. Sherlock looks like he’s going to be sick, half-bent over and with his mouth in a terrible grimace, like he’s fighting not to bite off his tongue.
Sherlock licks his lips, squeezes John’s hand back with a small smile, then swings his leg over to settle down sitting over John’s hips. Sherlock holds himself up on his thighs hovering in the air, giving him one last chance to change his mind. John looks down at the thrumming space between their bodies then throws his head back onto the pillow with a moan, lifting his hips up into the air towards Sherlock.
“—since you can’t go twenty days without—”
Simon: “Nearly positive.”
“It was the first time he kissed me,” Greg rushes out, and Sherlock’s eyes go wide because Greg knows he’s
I don’t know what the hell to say to that, so I turn over and fall back asleep before I’m even done exhaling the shaky breath in my lungs.
My nurse leans forward calmly when we’re almost back to the Home and types something into the command panel with her fingers. I look at her with a frown as the van suddenly swerves to the left off the main road, making its way slowly down the road to the beach. She looks out the window like this means nothing at all.
“So, out with it, then,” Greg says gently.
“There he is!” someone from the press yells, and hundreds of cameras flash as Sherlock suddenly comes into view on the course, a pinprick speeding across the ice impossibly fast, like his body’s been dropped from the sky, heading for the third-to-last gate.
Back on the slope, Sherlock’s poles reflect the blinding glint of the sun as he whips around the fourth gate, stunning the crowd as he soars across the HD screen. John blinks sudden water from his eyes, wondering when was the last time he even blinked.
“One day what?” he whispers.
“There is still the time to say no,” says Greg’s voice, as if from far away. “John? We do not have to do this.”
Greg shrugs his shoulders, and the movement feels so hopeless and wrong that even Sherlock takes a half-step back in confusion. “Perhaps it is the wax. I can have the technicians check.”
still be doing that, that physically Sherlock was more than capable (and interested, too, if his cock some mornings was anything to go by). But at this point, with such a huge belly in between us, it’s become pretty impossible to do anything without touching it, and if anything has changed the past few week’s it’s been Sherlock’s almost startling disconnect from his body.
“How does it feel to be the man with the most tragic story here?”
John’s eyes are riveted, locked on the sight of Sherlock’s full, wet lips closing around the tip of his cock over the view of his own heaving chest. It’s been years since even a woman did this to him – before he ever set foot on a Navy ship. And he’s certainly never looked down and seen the fucking hard, muscled lines of a man’s shoulders in between his thighs, or felt the heady rasp of stubble scrape across the hair at the base of his cock, or heard a rumbling moan so deep he feels it rattle straight through to his bones.
Holmes, smirking: "I had . . . a bit of a 'close call,' as they say."
Sherlock stares at him. Seconds pass. Then he pushes up his goggles and rips off his bandana. “That’s all you have to say?”
“Please,” I whisper to her. My eyes are wet. “Please, I just want to walk.”
Sherlock sounds like he’s lost—that, or quickly breaking apart. But Greg can’t muster up anything within himself to help. Can’t turn him back into the Sherlock Holmes who was berating the entire crowd, calling everyone idiots and fools, sniffing Greg’s ugly jacket and smuggling in biscuits.
“My lovely man.”
Sherlock’s cheeks turn pink as he looks down at his scuffling feet. He shrugs his shoulders. “Well, the people requested an interview. You know how it is.”
John huffs. “I haven’t prepared for one fucking second. Don’t know a single thing about who’s surfing, or what’s going on, or where the hell I’m even supposed to go. What on earth made you think this was a good idea? That I wanted this?”
The locker room door handle clicks open just as John starts to pull a white t-shirt over his head. His stomach flips; he’s completely exposed on his bench, legless and in nothing but his pants. He waits to hear the telltale squeak of Walter’s wheelchair, or Sherlock’s voice, or God forbid, a course attendant coming to tell him he’s somehow missed the entire ceremony. That they’re waiting for him to clear the fuck out of there so the next event can begin. And he can’t even begin to entertain the fact that the media might have access to this room, that it might be one more camera, one more microphone, one more voice asking him how it felt to just kiss a man in front of the entire world, for the best moment of his life to also be his worst, when . . .
“I’m here, John. I’m here.”
And Greg hadn’t been able to remember when or why he’d ever stopped. Why he’d never thought to do it when John was in California for those months. Why it never felt like he could do it when John would see.
“Wicked early in the season for it, but Harry was right. These beauties’ll definitely get over thirty today.”
Watson rips his hands back from the body as Patrick leans in with a defibrillator.
Scotty takes a moment to think, scrunching his lips, then goes on as he gazes out over the floral blanketed cliffs in front of them.
I come up for air again. Focus on her face. I feel like I’m soaring through the clouds. Like a plane.
Greg breaks through the crowd and grabs John around the neck, rubbing his fist into his hair to mess it up again. He leans down and whispers “you did it, old man,” in John’s ear before telling the other surfers to fuck off back to their girls and leave the poor guy alone to relax. John shoots him a grateful smile. The side of his neck feels cold when Greg takes his arm away.
He hears John sigh and start to pull off his shirt behind him, and Sherlock looks back over his shoulder, holding his board high up above his head. The water slaps softly against his stomach and thighs, cradling his skin in foam.
He stares blankly at the sand in front of him, head tipped down. When he hears a person walk up next to him he half expects to turn and see one of the other men from inside, waiting to meet his face with a punch after they belatedly realized what had been going on (about to go on?) in the opposite corner of the bathroom. He thinks of all his belongings in a trash bag on the porch.
The sounds of the MRI were still pretty damn loud though, and the need to lie still for the amount of time it took to get an image of his brain made him itch. John still didn't know what had happened to his parents and Harry, his friends, and come to think of it, himself. When he had been to the toilet earlier and taken another good look at his body, he had seen a bullet wound on his left shoulder. A contorted look into the mirror confirmed that it had been a through-and-through, some years ago, possibly with an infection. Where the hell had he been, and what had he been doing, to get shot? He hadn't planned much further than his residency, and then possibly an employment as a surgeon; there were a few very interesting new developments in laparoscopic surgery ... but that was ten years ago, who knew if that was already standard procedure? Would he still be needed as a doctor, with medical knowledge ten years out of date? And why couldn't he remember?
He stretched, trying to work the kinks out of his back. He had spent the night sitting at John's bedside in the terrible plastic hospital chair, watching John sleep, occasionally nodding off himself. He was awake when John started to exhibit all the signs of a nightmare, soft cries, minor yet abrupt movement of his limbs. He could still hear the despair in John's soft cries, the sobbed "no". Sherlock had relaxed when John seemed to have calmed down, but then his breathing and pulse rate had skyrocketed as if he were experiencing a panic attack, and Sherlock had done his best to rouse John from his sleep.
He had just stretched out on his bed when his mobile announced an incoming text message. With a sigh, John retrieved the phone. Checking the message, he saw to his relief that it wasn't from Sherlock.
Being conscientious, he always checked the pockets of his trousers before putting them into the washing machine, even more so after the almost-disaster involving a pair of jeans, a paper napkin, and a small plastic zip-lock bag filled with some strange chemical that Sherlock had asked him to keep hold of at a crime scene.
“Yes, John”, was all Sherlock said, and John nodded, satisfied, and released Sherlock's wrist to pluck the glass of water from his hand. “Good”, he said then picked up the two pills. “Now I'm going to take these, as ordered, and I'm going to sleep. I hope you'll be there when I wake up, because then you and I are going to have a nice long talk. Alright?”
John stopped to take another few deep breaths. The nausea and dizzyness were receding, though his stomach still protested a bit at the lack of solid food to cushion the alcohol, while his bladder reminded him quite insistently just how much liquid he had drunk. John looked around and realised that while he had been reminiscing, he had actually gotten a bit lost after all, though he was sure the general direction was correct. No matter, there was no hurry. There was a small park on the other side of the street, and he could probably find some kind of map at the entrance or have another look at the sky to re-orientate himself, and there would also be a friendly tree against which he could relieve himself. Perfect.
"It would have been fine, really. A bit painful, sure, but I felt ok, warm, around people I knew. Friends. Comrades. But you saved me. And then....the laughing man came."
Sherlock closed his eyes and forced himself to answer as calmly as he could. “Ten years, Lestrade. He's forgotten the last ten years.”
“Of course”, Sherlock said, but John made no move to leave. Instead, he cleared his throat nervously, then said, sheepishly, “Um. I can probably figure out where the bathroom is, but... “
“Bugger that! I had to watch you die!”
“Hello yourself”, a pleasant female voice answered from somewhere to the side. “Good to see you're awake at last. Would you like some water?”
Sherlock twisted his upper body until he could look at John, elegant eyebrow raised  as if saying, “… and?”
Carlton pressed his lips together and sighed. “Or maybe never”, he agreed.
“You mean, to the me I was before I lost my memory?”
"How would you describe me, then?" John asked, genuinely interested.
That was probably the shortest and most heart-warming note John had found in his pocket. Of course, Sherlock never voiced these thoughts aloud or spoke of the notes, but while he did the laundry that Tuesday, John found he couldn’t concentrate on his novel. He knew that he and Sherlock had grown ever closer over the months they had shared a flat and ran around London catching criminals. He was certain that they were friends. He would certainly call Sherlock Holmes his best friend, and if John entertained more romantic thoughts about his flatmate, well, these would stay quite firmly in John’s mind and in his bedroom.
There was Karaoke going on in a side room, and every time the door opened, the sound of increasingly drunk men singing their way through the Beatles’ greatest hits floated through the pub. For a moment, John considered joining them. He wondered idly whether he was drunk enough to do it and not care how his voice sounded. Probably not, he thought. He shook his head wearily and took another sip of his ale. The glass was almost empty again, how had that happened? He waved at the barmaid and ordered another.
Oh, how it hurt Sherlock to hear that.
John pulled the tray of food towards him and inspected it critically. There was a plate containing an off-white puddle which might be either chicken in a white sauce or porridge, if porridge came accompanied with mushy vegetables. There was a plastic glass of brightly artificial orange juice and a little pot of artificial yellow custard.  The whole thing looked bland and unappetizing. John took his cutlery – plastic, he noted, probably because of his earlier violent episode – and prodded the food. “Seems that hospital cuisine hasn't improved much in the last ten years”, he grumbled and took a bite of the off-white stuff. It was every bit as tasteless as he had feared.
Sherlock had stopped in his tracks. "John?" he said softly, in a tone John didn't recognise.
“Anything?” he heard Lestrade ask, and Sherlock looked up.
He felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder and trembled involuntarily. Sherlock gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze before dropping his hand again. John turned around and leaned back against the tree, looking into the distance and into the past.
John became aware that the man was bleeding through his clothes, blood seeping through from cuts on his arms, legs and torso, dripping slowly onto the stone floor of the church. The faint helicopter sound became unbearably loud as a hail of gunfire blew the windows to little shards of glass that danced in the light of a sun far too bright for an English afternoon. Shocked and confused, John ran out of the church but instead of the familiar cobblestones of the thoroughfare of St Bart's he felt sand under his feet, and the weight of a helmet and backpack. Of course, he thought, Afghanistan.
I hope it won't be another year until I get the next chapter done. Sorry for the delay.
John was so engrossed in his relief that he didn't hear the footsteps approaching his impromptu toilet, and he was taken by surprise by the rough, taunting voices. “Oi, mate! Havin' a bit of wank, are we?” Sneering laughter followed this question, and a second voice chimed in. “That's proper dirty that is.”
drink!” Harry wrenched the bottle out of John’s grasp, and before he could duck or block it, swung the bottle at his head. John heard the glass shatter before he felt the impact, and he stumbled, stunned, fetching up against the refrigerator. There was red liquid dripping onto his shoulder, and it was only partly wine. He reached up to his head and winced as his hand came back sticky with blood. Still, he thought in a detached part of his mind, he was lucky – if the alcohol hadn't made Harry so uncoordinated, she could have hit him much harder.
He nods. “I did.”
Nurse Stephanie nodded. “Doctor Carlton prescribed it. It should lower your anxiety and make you sleep better, which will help with your recovery. You are in an unusual situation, John, and as a doctor yourself, wouldn't you give this to someone with high levels of anxiety who's already had a panic attack?”
“You would probably like to know that I was wrong.”
As if he were reading his mind, the stranger stepped back from John and nodded. “Better now?” he asked.
After a while though John noticed that there was something slightly off. For some reason, it seemed that Siobhan wouldn't meet his eyes while they talked. Instead, she was distractedly playing with the lemon in her drink, looking around the pub, frowning occasionally, and John knew her well enough to see that there was something amiss.
Dear god, the doctor hadn't been kidding. John hadn't seen a collection of injuries like this since his days of playing Rugby. He ran his bruised hands tentatively over his ribcage, wincing at the renewed pain. There, two on the left side and one on the right. He had indeed been comprehensively beaten up, and he was once again glad that he couldn't remember the assault itself.
“Of course”, Carlton said, and left.
Without moving, he checked his body, tensing and relaxing his muscles, most of which informed him that they hurt, even through the comfortable haze of pain meds. Breathing was difficult, something seemed to constrict his ribcage. Had he been in an accident? Or a fight? He couldn't remember, but he knew that was alright. He must've hit his head or, and this seemed more likely, he had drunk enough to have a black-out. Either way, it was time to find out more. He carefully opened his eyes and looked up into a smiling face framed with black hair floating above him. He smiled back instinctively. “Hello”, he croaked.
As John finished yet another glass, he knew he was getting stinking drunk. He usually had no more than a pint or two in the company of Mike Stamford, Greg Lestrade or his mates from the army. He knew his limits. When he drank alone and for personal reasons, he made sure to drink way above that limit, accepting the resulting two-day hangover as both penance and insurance. After all, alcoholism was running in his family, and he did not want to court the danger of becoming the second Watson sibling to succumb to that particular vice.
“Victim is in his early thirties, like the first one. Nothing to indicate the identity of the victim, though the tattoo on his shoulder might indicate a military background, which could be a connection. Same MO. We've got a serial killer on our hands, with access to a lab or hospital. More likely a doctor than a medical student. He certainly knows what he's doing, and he's very careful of removing all traces that could lead us to him. Brilliant. Utterly mad, obviously, but brilliant. John, can you...” He trailed off, looking over his shoulder to where John would usually be, and remembering that he wasn't, and why. He turned back just in time to see Lestrade's smirk. He rolled his eyes in exasperation. It wasn't as if he had never talked to John when the man wasn't there, but this was the first time he had done so in front of others. Lestrade would tell John, and he'd never hear the end of it.
Age does not enter here, where bodies are left at the door and only the core – the soul, if you will – remains. Nevertheless, they stretch, feeling time fall away from them and leaving their outward appearance to reflect their inner selves.
The problem with being below average height is that people whose legs are longer (and, John admitted, who were about half his age) were also faster. He did his best to outrun them, but he hadn't reached the edge of the park before someone tackled him from behind and he fell. He cursed himself for a fool as he tried to struggle free. If it hadn't been for his stubbornness he would probably have gotten away with just giving them his money. Then someone kicked him hard in the ribs and all thought fled with his breath. He could only try to avoid the worst of the beating the four men were inflicting on him, alternating punches and kicks. He curled up and raised his arms to protect his face, grunting in pain, and he felt someone roughly tearing at his jacket to pull out his wallet, phone, and keys. John opened his eyes to see if they were done with him, but instead he saw a booted foot coming towards his face. He desperately tried to roll away, but the kick connected.
Stephanie was making another note on her clipboard, and John noticed that her smile seemed a little forced.
Sherlock was glad to see his tactic had worked. Instead of leaving John to his thoughts, he had given him information to process. Good. He turned back to the kitchen where the kettle was boiling. He heard John get up and move to sit in one of the kitchen chairs.
. He looked
“Yes”, Doctor Carlton nodded, “but as a medical professional, you know how these things work, Doctor Watson.” He smiled reassuringly. “Indulge me, please. What is the last thing you remember before waking up here?”
Siobhan trailed off, fidgeting nervously with the lemon, then taking another drink, while John sat, thinking of what to say, of how to feel about this. When he didn't speak for a few minutes, Siobhan reached out to touch his hand. “John?” she said. “Are we alright? Are
“And you had to go off without telling anyone what was going on. Always too clever for your own good.”
An infinite number of worlds, like game boards stacked upon one another. An infinite number of games. In a place to rest between turns, the players might sit back, re-group, take stock of the game so far, before diving back onto the board, forgetting that they are only playing a game, the game of living.
“What do I like, then?” John asked. “Since you know me so well, apparently.”
John tucked himself away and turned around. He was faced by three men in their late teens, maybe early twenties he thought, in jeans, t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts, each holding a can of cheap lager and sniggering at him.
The victim's body had been treated in the same manner as Gavin Walsh's had. It was the same precise pattern of cuts, and – Sherlock opened the body cavity carefully – the same removal, cleaning and re-insertion of the internal organs. The body was virtually bloodless, and he would judge that the victim had died between eight and twelve hours ago. He lifted and turned the victim's left arm and inspected it with his magnifier. Now that he knew what he was looking for, he could see the two small puncture wounds where the killer had injected the sedative and muscle relaxant. He leaned down and sniffed the victim's skin, smelling medical-grade disinfectant soap and traces of latex and cornstarch. Definitely the work of the same person. A serial killer. He nodded, straightened up and turned to Lestrade.
Scotty Holmes looks like a Hollywood film star accidentally wandered onto the grimy, salt and rust-stained set of a maritime horror movie. A perfectly cut white shirt hugs his lean body, shirt collar left open to reveal the long, smooth lines of his neck. His legs look a mile long in crisp, ironed slacks, hot sun glinting off his brown suede shoes. His hair is tamed in perfect curls – a night and day difference from the frizzy halo he was sporting the night before when he had caught John unawares in the sand. He looks like a completely different person. As if someone straight out of that Star Trek show Greg’s always bugging him to watch made a magic clone of Scotty Holmes, where the original man is just a young kid in a tank top with frizzy hair, and the clone’s a top level Hollywood executive just stepping off a private jet at LAX. John’s eyes flicker over the barest hint of collarbone, and he swallows over a dry throat.
John nodded and sat back. He never would have slept with Siobhan if he hadn't thought she wanted it, too. And he would have been comfortable being 'friends with benefits', but apparently, Siobhan saw things differently.
“Come on, Harry”, John said, still trying to reason with his drunken sister. “Leave it. Give it up.”
John sighed. “I really think you should stop drinking now, I think you’ve got enough for one day.”
John had been wounded in action too. He would feel empathy for the victims, even if he didn't know them personally. Would John fit the killer's profile? If so, they would need to proceed with extreme caution.
“He probably received it from the same source that supplied the poison.”
“No, she isn't”, John replied angrily. “She does like a glass of wine with her dinner, but she's not what I would call an alcoholic.”
There is a flash of memory. A deserted college, an empty, cold room, two men caught up in a game of high stakes. Two men raising their hands to their mouths. An innocent-looking pill in a trembling hand. A life wagered on being right.
There was a thought he couldn't let go. “What did I do wrong, Siobhan?” he asked. “Why...”
If anything, John became even more confused. In one swift motion, Sherlock put one hand on John's wrist and with the other tugged the gun from his hand. Stepping back quickly, he turned the safety back on and released the magazine, which he stuck into his pocket. The gun he placed on the kitchen table, still looking at John, who had grown pale.
things, I’m telling you, if I wasn’t interested in dick in the fist place that guy would have put me right off, ow! Dammit!”
They sit in the glow of the gently crackling fire.
John thought ruefully that he really shouldn't be surprised that a week of rotten luck would end with a friend and potential girlfriend breaking up with him before things got even properly started. This was worse than Sarah, whose first date included Chinese gangsters, or Jeanette at the disastrous Christmas party. This time, he hadn't even needed Sherlock's help to fuck things up.
John thought of the past week and the dissected body. “Not much, really”, he replied, reaching for his pint. "Cheers!"
He shrugs. “Sentiment. Besides, I know you kept the bullet shell, after you shot Hope.”
“Holmes”, Sherlock answered. “Sherlock Holmes.”
Materials. Generic heavy-duty bin bags. Obtainable at any supermarket. No lead there. Latex gloves with cornstarch as lubrication: surgical gloves. Victim's skin smelling of chlorhexidine, the antiseptic component in surgical scrub and hospital soaps. Conclusion: Victim was washed thoroughly before being wrapped in the bin bags, thereby removing all traces of bacteria or other materials that would make a location traceable.
They clinked glasses and for a while lost themselves in friendly chat. Siobhan was telling John about her latest visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum, going off on a tangent about the Aesthetic Movement of the 19th century, and John started to relax. He didn't know much about interior design, but he loved listening to Siobhan being passionate about a subject, and sharing her passion with him, asking him for his opinion, even though they both admitted that he wasn't the expert. Here was someone he didn't have to pretend with, who didn't see him just as part of the Holmes and Watson duo. He felt at ease, and a tension he hadn't even noticed left him. For what seemed to be the first time that week, he smiled a genuine smile.
The first thing that struck him was how neat it was. He usually didn't have much time to clean his room, or what he currently thought of as his room, in the flat he shared with Mike, Kirsty and Jamal, between studies and his job as barista at the nearest Caffe Nero. Things just seemed to accumulate around him. Empty cups and overflowing ashtrays, which sometimes were the same things. Clothes haphazardly thrown over a chair in the corner, bed hastily made if at all.
“Stephanie. You're quite the charmer.” She was making a few notes on a clipboard. “Okay, John. Next, can you tell me the date?”
“Are you sure you don’t have enough?” the barmaid asked when John ordered another ale. John smiled at her slightly lopsidedly. He knew that even drunk, he had a friendly, non-threatening manner, and he played the harmless drunk card for all he was worth.
John Watson opened his eyes and looked at the dark-haired, fair-eyed man standing over him, worry etched into his face, calling his name, and for a moment he almost thought he knew...
Hypothetically.
“You didn't!”
Sherlock was leaning over the microscope, analysing various tissue samples taken from Gavin’s dead body. John was re-reading the autopsy report, which was confirming his initial assessment. The cadaver had been very carefully dissected.
Brawn's grin got wider, almost as if he had hoped that John would refuse. He stepped closer to John, who didn't back down. “You what?”, Brawn said. “No? You're pissed, mate, just give it over and you can go, right?”
“Oh but it was. A memento of our first case together. The first time you saved my life.”
“You don't have much of a sweet tooth”, Sherlock continued, “but will have a few biscuits with your tea. Splash of milk, no sugar. You can't abide dark chocolate. You don't drink much alcohol, probably because of your sister. And you don't smoke...” He trailed off when John looked at him with a slightly irritated frown. “My sister? Why wouldn't I drink because of Harry?”
“And then you kept it.”
Sherlock stood up and went to pour some water from the pitcher by the bedside, then reached over to give it to John. Instead of taking it, however, John's hand shot out to grab Sherlock's wrist in a grip so firm it was almost bruising. “You say you are my friend,” he said in a low, hard voice. “I've lost ten years of my life – something I still don't believe, by the way – and I don't know what has happened to me or to the people I love, so I am calling on our friendship, Sherlock. If I ask you something, I expect an honest and thorough answer. No beating around the bush or leaving anything out because you think I can't handle it. Is. That. Clear.”
John grinned, but it was a dark, satisfied grin. Yes, he had nightmares about Afghanistan, though those had become less and less the longer he was living at 221B. He'd had nightmares too while he was studying to be a doctor, and while he was in residency; he had always been a vivid dreamer. And despite everything, despite the bullet wound in his shoulder and the deteriorated relationship with his family, he was glad that he had made the choice to join the Army. His experiences made him who he was now, and though there had been a time when he was lost and walking with a cane when he had wished the bullet had hit him a little further to the right and down, it sometimes seemed that everything in his life so far had been leading up to this, to being Sherlock Holmes' flatmate, friend, and partner-in-solving-crime. Even if Sherlock was a colossal, infuriating berk on frequent occasions.
John Watson would be the first to admit that he wasn’t having the best day of his life. He thought about that sentence a few times, sitting alone at the bar finishing his fourth pint while the people in the pub around him chatted, laughed and enjoyed themselves. He waved to the barmaid and ordered another lager. Yes, damn it. John Watson was having an extremely bad day.
“Helen,” he says, a ghost of a smile just at the corner of his lips, mouth forming the word carefully like he hasn’t uttered it in years.
“No, I know, it’s not that. It’s – I wish that I could stay with you today. On the beach, between heats. While you’re off . . . being the reigning champion and I’m sitting alone shitting bricks. I wish that so fucking badly.”
The studio lights are so blindingly bright he briefly wonders if he didn’t black out the night before and then wake up more hungover than any university student alive.
It’s more than just a blast. John winces at the freezing whirlwind of fog and snow coming down off the nearby mountains, shivering uncontrollably beneath his jacket. He unconsciously rubs his palm over his left chest and shoulder to try and ward off the inevitable ache, unable to feel the raised skin through the thick layers of his puffy vest and snow jacket. He fruitlessly scans the main courtyard for nearly five minutes, trying and failing to get signal on his phone, until he finally spots Greg and Sherlock back together again in front of
It’s not at all what he’d meant to say. He’d meant to say something like
I think before I go that I’ll see one last thing. Her eyes – warm and soft in the midst of gentle black.
After the first week I decide it’s time to fully wash myself, and I leave Scott puttering round the main camp and grab a bucket of water and a little bar of lye soap. I don’t go far, just round the other side of the tent. I strip down and shiver against the icy air – let it rock through my body in a great crash and revel in the way it makes my bullet scars ache because it reminds me I still got the limbs. I squat and wash up between my legs, lettin’ the water wash away the old dried cum at the base of my prick from when I tried to pleasure myself the other night over dreams of Alma back in high school. It hadn’t worked quite right, and I’d come in my hand just watching the tanned callouses of my fingers rub and rough over myself, bunching up the silken skin hard enough to leave a burn. I feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and I turn my head to the side just in time to see Scott moving back into the trees quick as lightning and quieter’n a cat. My prick feels heavy and hot in my hand and it takes the rest of the cold water just to make me right and decent to dress again.
Walter hums. “I would ask them along to dinner, but I’m pretty sure the rest of the guys would just sit there and stare at them in silence.”
With one final serious glance at each of them, Chris turns to face out over the ocean, raising the conch shell to his lips. He takes a deep breath and blows a deep and mournful note, echoing out across the waves and billowing over the sea. John’s chest vibrates to the noise. He looks up at Sherlock, whose eyes are burning brilliant blue framed by long, wet eyelashes. Sherlock smiles, and cups John’s face in his hands, and John closes his eyes and hums as Sherlock presses a long, soft kiss to his forehead, thumbs rubbing just along his jaw. John reaches up to hold onto Sherlock’s wrists as the conch shell continues to blow out over the sea. He feels the wind in his hair, smells the salt in his nose and resting at the back of his throat, breathes in the scent from the hollow of Sherlock’s neck as his toes grip at the foundation of the earth beneath his feet.
We don’t have sex that night. I hold him close against me and feel his spine melt into my tight chest in the warm darkness as he sleeps.
He casually stares out at the mountains with his hands in his pockets.
By the time they get back to Hermosa beach, and Johnny grabs his sweatshirt from the lifeguard stand, the sun is already hot and heavy above them, sizzling across the sand. The rest of the run back had been pleasantly silent, their arms brushing against each other every few steps and neither one bothering to move any further steps apart. Something was crackling at a low hum between them. Something tense and sweet and thick. And now Sherlock finds himself for the first time in his life trying to think of a reason
I’d thought my nurse would actually faint when I’d told her that I wanted to take a visit here, right after I’d woken up in the World with the image of Sherlock Holmes’ single tear still burned into my mind.
“Thought I’d sound different? Ancient?”
, there, God I’m—”
John Watson told him.
Sherlock is pregnant. We’re having twin girls. He’s almost eight months. (blank blank blank)
and he wants to
Alma sees me pausin’ in the doorway and pushes past me. “S’alright, daddy, I been here once before,” she says, hanging up her coat and movin’ to sit down at the table. “Hundred times better than your last two places,” she adds.
“Feels like a year ago that we jumped off that cliff, doesn’t it?” Sherlock says, squinting off towards the far end of the beach where the cliff stands silhouetted against the pale blue and purple candy sky.
John clears his throat. “We haven’t met yet. I’m Johnny,” he says.
I knew, then, as you looked up at me and I held you. Knew right then I didn’t regret a single night over the last twenty years I’d had to spend alone. Away from John Watson.
“If anyone at this table says the words ‘Opening Ceremony’ one more time I am getting up and leaving.”
John turns to look at him. His eyes are shocked, raw and open. Like nobody had ever taken the time to ask him that question before.
“It’s too late for me to go back to them sheep,” Scott says as he stretches out his legs with his arms above his head. “I’m sleeping right here on this very spot and they can sure enough wait ‘til first light.”
He clears his throat, wondering if she’d noticed that his cheering for one particular skier so far had been mildly more exuberant than for all the others. Or maybe it was less?
“It does not work, to be comparing like that. You see how I am not perfect in my own ways,
Greg and Sherlock both mutter an awkward, rushed thanks as the camera pans quickly away from them, mid-words, zooming in on Sonya’s beaming face as she gives the broadcast details for when to tune in for the Super-G prelim runs.
I’m thirty-two. I’m vibrant and bold, thick hair in my short military cut and muscles bulging underneath my plain t-shirt. Blue eyes sparkling without wrinkles sagging over them. Skin tight.
The rest of the lap passes by in a blur. Sherlock and Greg stare at the distant hints of the course as if through a fog. The camera cuts back to John every once in a while, but he’s all alone in the back of the race, and an eerie silence follows each of his strokes.
He yanks off the hood of his suit and runs his hands through his sweat-matted hair, setting it free. Man after man approaches him to offer him a handshake, a slap on the back, a nod of congratulations before they make their way to the skiers who came second and first.
Their eyes meet in the darkness, and Sherlock’s hands still. Then John reaches down and presses a warm hand to Sherlock’s fingers before drifting back to sleep, trusting Sherlock to finish getting it off for him instead.
John is just starting the process of awkwardly deciding whether to keep waiting or go on without him when Greg looks back over his shoulder, immediately locking eyes with John through the bustling crowd. Greg lifts his hands in a quick, silent apology, casually shrugging his shoulders, but there’s something else there hidden in the lines of his mouth, some expression on his face . . .
“Maybe I’m starting now.”
I take one step down the rickety metal stairs.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and imagines he can feel John’s racing heartbeat against his own chest. In his mind he sees the man he saw that day on the pier, so small and lost compared to the man standing now on the starting line, exuding a fierce, quiet strength. He feels the back of his throat start to close up, and wants to reach out across the sand towards John Watson with his fingers, hoping to grasp just a ghostly wisp of his same air.
– and he’d leaned forward and kissed him.
“Have you looked at his time?” he murmurs to Sherlock.
you.” And with that parting shot, John turns and immediately starts skiing back to the road.
Interviewer, chuckling: “It really is. She did not mention that when we spoke with her.”
I hope future-John forgives me for not writing down the painful details of every doctor appointment. Frankly they’ve all started to run together. Sherlock had to go off of T, and I stood beside him in the bathroom holding his hand for over an hour on that first day. He had forgotten to turn off the alarm on his phone that reminded him to take it, and so we stood there listening to the tinny phone ringtone echoing off the bathroom tile until Sherlock felt ready to put the unused hormones back into the cabinet. I cannot believe how strong he is.
Greg smirks back at him as he continues to stutter over his replies to the well wishes, and John is inordinately grateful when someone starts blasting Earth Wind and Fire on a nearby boom box loud enough that anything more than a smile and nod becomes impossible. He feels like he’s been dropped onto a goddamn Hollywood film set, with a costume thrown on his body and a fake surfboard shoved under his arm and a director yelling “hey there, sonny, just walk down the beach and pretend you’re one of the boys!”
Greg frowns, suddenly concerned, and he asks before John can think of a way to change the subject, “
John can barely think clearly. The thought that this might be his last chance ever to kiss Sherlock hovers dangerously at the back of his mind, and his voice shakes when he repeats himself. “Pull the car over. Stop the car.”
“Christ, I . . . You know I would’ve reached out and told you, but—”
Then, after a few silent seconds, the go-pro catches sight of an ungloved, bloodied hand peeking out of the deepest crack.
Sherlock’s grip around him tightens. “Then it’s ok,” he says.
“Easy,” he says. “You see each other bout every two months, today’s a Friday so it’s her day off from her job in Signal. That husband a’ hers is up in the Dakota’s for two weeks so she’s lonely and she’s got access to his car – won’t have to wait for you to drive down to Signal and visit her at her place like you usually do. Paper three days ago had a story ‘bout a Vietnam vet in it. Seein’ as she reads the paper every day while fixin’ dinner and she always misses you when people talk about the war or the army, I reckon’ it’s a fair good chance that she’s taking the day to drive over here and pay you a surprise visit just in time to be home for Friday night supper with her neighbor.”
John gestures at Greg’s bag. “Are you happy with it, though?”
He feels like he’s floating above in the darkened clouds and watching himself down below on the shore. Stunned and indignant and repulsed that he’s been stripped down to such a sorry state – that the man he’d known himself to be since he was fifteen was really all just a façade, easily blown over by the breath from John’s mouth when he’d first parted his lips and said
John holds out his hand. “Mr. Lebedev.”
Different groups of the team flying in various helicopters over the glittering peaks; Watson being raised on the winch from Solvay Hut through the swirling skies with the frostbite patient in tow; various mechanics closely examining parts of the helicopter rotors and blades; quick shots of Greg, Robbie, Sam, and Gerold all coming home to their families, all arriving and donning their uniforms for work; Patrick overseeing a training session on the hangar floor with a CPR dummy; one lone helicopter soaring up into the storming sky from the helipad at the base.
He catches the deep brown eyes framed by unruly, grey brows and forces himself to speak. “Thank you,” he says. Sherlock stands beside him and nods once, eyes full of meaning. Chris steps back and looks between the two of them thoughtfully for a moment before giving a small smile and a nod.
“No, no, I mean that’s fucking amazing,” John says.
I lay awake at night in our bed under the thick Pendleton blanket worryin’ at the ceiling that all this ain’t gonna be enough for him. We never talk about it now– what all he did after he died and how it was for me while he was gone. Not since we woke up clingin’ to each other a month ago in my little trailer and by that afternoon I was lockin’ the front door for good and leaving the key and an envelope for next month’s rent in the little #17 mailbox.
Siobhan stopped playing with the lemon and took a large sip of her gin and tonic. She sighed as she put down the glass. “Yeah. John, I … we need to talk.”
The man raised his head and favoured John with a surprised look. “Sherlock, please”, he said, and John was amazed at how lost two words could sound. It made him wonder exactly what their relationship had been, or would become in ten years' time. Struggling with tenses made his head hurt more than it already did.
Sherlock hummed again, then sighed. Looking up from the microscope and focussing on John, he said, “I found traces of phenobarbital and pancuronium. No poison or other substance that could have killed him. I am sorry, John.”
Every Tuesday without fail, there would be a note in John’s trouser pockets. Small things, mundane things, asking him to get something, telling him about experiments, calm little asides in the usually hectic and turbulent life in 221B. When he arrived at the launderette, John always checked his trouser pocket first to find the next message. Regardless of their content, the notes always made John smile, especially when they had a more chatty quality.
“John, you have seen the body. What would you say was the cause of death?” Sherlock didn’t look up from the microscope as he asked. John turned to the autopsy report once more. “Apart form being cut open, you mean?” he muttered under his breath. Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement.
“John”, she said, still in a light and friendly tone, “can you tell me who the Prime Minister is?”
Sherlock was so deep in thought that he didn't hear John approach. Hearing his words, he turned around, the box of loose leaf tea in one hand, measuring spoon in the other, and froze. John was pointing a gun at him.
