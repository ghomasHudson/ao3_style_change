Dean wondered if Cas counted. They were definitely seeing each other, but were they
“But I thought... you didn’t...”
The man in question came out of the bedroom wearing yesterday’s clothes and looking adorably rumpled and grumpy not long before breakfast was ready.
“Dude, this is just an objectively bad song.”
“Yes,” Dean agreed because there was no place he’d rather be.
“It’s a guilty pleasure,” Dean snapped at Sam, then shook his head and pointed a finger at him. “No, you know what? I’m not guilty, it’s a great show!”
Sam and Dean sat in the kitchen for an hour talking, really talking. This had been a long time coming, not just Dean's admission to Sam but his acknowledgment to himself that he was bisexual. He’d known on some level that he wasn’t exactly straight but it was the kind of thing he tried not to think about too hard. He’d been thinking about it a lot more ever since Cas had come into his life though. It was such a relief to finally speak the words that had been rattling around in his head with increasingly loudness for so long. Sam’s acceptance of his sexuality sort of felt like a sign that he should accept himself too.
When Dean released him, Cas took a moment to look Dean up and down too. He was wearing another of his endless jeans and flannel combos with a canvas jacket. He looked just as casual as Cas, so Cas figured that at least he hadn’t made a misstep on the date outfit front. Now, if he could just keep that successful streak going.
“But mostly adorable right?”
It was harder to shake off the incident the second time it happened. Cas felt like he was going crazy, but maybe that was overly dramatic. It was unlikely he was actually going crazy. He was pretty sure it was unlikely, anyway. He was perfectly sane… but then, ninety-four percent of psychotics thought they were perfectly sane… No, if he had a psychotic illness, chances were that signs would have shown up before he was twenty-seven, right?
“Richard!” Sam hissed.
Thirty minutes later they pulled into a dingy parking lot behind a roadside bar. It looked much like the sort of places they normally drank on the road, slightly beat-up, wooden siding in need of a coat of paint, except this place had a rainbow flag in the window and the music that filtered out sounded more pop-like than their usual haunts.
Dean wasn’t sure if the story of Gay Ken was common knowledge among straight people, but he figured the largely queer crowd at the club they were going to might have heard of him. Gay Ken was a real Ken doll, though that wasn’t his official name.
“C’mon, Cas. Don’t look at me like that,” Dean said, ducking his head to avoid meeting his eyes, afraid if he looked too closely that Cas wouldn’t like what he saw.
Cas had enjoyed it too. It was the best date he’d ever been on. Well, it was the only date he’d ever been on. Or perhaps not, he supposed that lunch at Harrington’s diner counted as a date and he’d just been kidding himself that it wasn’t one because he wasn’t ready to date Dean. But he thought he was ready now, and he didn’t want the date to end.
Terrible nineties pop filled the room, as annoying as it was catchy. Charlie continued to look confused as Dean clipped a silver hoop earring onto one ear and looped a necklace over his head. The large chrome ring dangling from the chain settled low on his chest. Dean moved his arms stiffly, one held upright and one in front of him, both bent at the elbow, like he'd frozen in the middle of doing the robot. He tilted his head slightly and unfocused his eyes, his expression going eerily blank except for the rictus grin plastered on his face.
“He was anatomically correct too.” Cas’s eyes flicked briefly to Dean’s crotch. “I feel that gives him one up on Ken.”
“Leviticus,” Cas said in the end.
From the weekend
when he’s encouraging the other kids to stand up to Nelson and saying that alone they’re weak like a single twig, but together they form a mighty faggot?”
“My boyfriend does,” Dean said, looking over his shoulder at Cas, before grinning back. It was the first time he’d said that out loud he realised. It sounded good, it sounded really good.
Or maybe the fact that they liked each other, were having sex and went out together for dinner and drinks and other activities that could reasonably be called dates meant that they were actually dating, maybe they were actual boyfriends who just hadn't had the relationship talk yet. Hell, maybe Cas referred to him as his boyfriend to other people because that status would be patently obvious to anyone who wasn't Dean Winchester.

“If you want my opinion,” Sam started saying, Dean emphatically did not want his opinion, but his brother continued nonetheless, “I think you’re having a meltdown because you’re married. If I asked you to stay with someone you didn’t know, but that I’d told you I trusted, that wouldn’t phase you. You’d do it no questions asked. But that guy tells you you’re married and you start having some freak-out about commitment.”
me like one of your French girls’—people like saying that to tattoo artists,” Cas said as he stepped away from the stove to put bread in the toaster.
“Yeah, it does.” Dean fluttered his eyelashes and said in a breathy voice, “Cas, I want your meat.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, you got any plans for Christmas? Only a week now,” Dean said.
Gentile nonsense or not, Rufus was always happy to accept the bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label that Sam and Dean got him every year. Dean felt a bit like he wasn’t putting the effort in when they got Rufus the same thing every Christmas, but the last time they hadn’t gotten him Johnnie Walker, Rufus complained, ‘It’s tradition, ya idjits.’ Because, of course, Rufus had picked up calling him and Sam idjits from Bobby. That was tradition too, he supposed.
“I’m saying, are we sure this isn’t some Becky Rosen kind of deal?”
Dean resisted the urge to yell, ‘Hey, that’s my husband you’re talking to, watch it!’ but only barely. He was trying to remain calm but part of him wanted to square up to the guy like he was a teenager taking on the school bully, trying to impress the classmate he wanted to go steady with. Clearly, he’d watched Back to the Future one too many times as a kid and that scene with George McFly punching Biff had had an effect on him, not least because he’d had a crush on Crispin Glover. He knew Cas was perfectly capable of taking care of himself but he couldn’t help shifting in front of him slightly anyway. He took a deep breath and gave diplomacy another try.
“We're supposed to be,” Dean said with a frown.
“Been a little busy. What’s up?”
Dean did his best to summon up his signature confident swagger and sauntered up to the man at the bar.
Gently, Cas placed a hand under his chin and tilted his head back up. Cas was still looking at him intently but his expression had softened.
“Ah, but I followed in his footsteps first,” Dean pointed out. “So now you’re following mine, that’s just how it works.”
in the end. He’d slept in Dean’s arms and not had nightmares. He’d woken up the next morning feeling better than he had for a week.
“I didn’t say I didn’t watch it. Only that it’s not why I want a tardigrade tattoo.” Cas rolled his eyes. “Of course, I watch
“Very snugglable,” Dean agreed, taking the opportunity to start stroking Cas’s arm again, just to feel how soft the wool was, of course.
but modern art needed to be taken on its own merits. Much of it had a beauty unlike what had come before.
“Not that you don't look hot as fuck babe,” Meg began, “but I thought you were coming as a knight?"
“I’m fine, woman,” Bobby grumbled, but Dean could tell he secretly liked having his wife fuss over him a little bit.
“Oh,” said Cas, whose face clearly showed that he hadn’t known that, or at least hadn’t felt comfortable letting himself believe that yet. “I love you too, Gabe.”
Despite the eye roll, Dean could see that Sam meant the words. Good for him. He was glad his brother had somebody to love, even if that somebody was Gabriel.
“I didn’t tell Sam about Cassie,” Gabriel said, looking suddenly serious. “I don’t like to focus on the past and I thought Cas was... Well, it was too painful to talk about it. I only told Sam after I saw you and realised that dad had lied about what happened to Cas.”
“Of course he doesn’t remember- he had amnesia!” Dean said defensively. The plot by the leviathans to turn people into complacent cattle by drugging food, starting with those damn delicious turducken slammers at Biggersons, had happened when Cas had lost his memory and been living as Emmanuel. “You can hardly blame him for being out of the loop. And it’s not like I had time to catch him when he did get his memory back, what with him taking all your crazy into himself and checking into the freaking nut house!”
—he was, but not only that, he had an air about him, like he was on some higher plane than Dean and all the other people down in the mud with him. He was looking out over the dancefloor like he was some creature from up on high who was untouchable for a mere mortal like Dean but, by God, did he want to touch him.
“You are so beautiful,” he told Cas, cupping one cheek with his hand and leaning in to kiss the other.
It’s unnatural! If we were meant to fly, we’d have wings. But we didn’t crash, so I guess the flight was ok
Meg slept in his bed that night. She insisted that it was to escape the fumes, but Cas wasn’t convinced. Meg could be impulsive, but the sudden paint job seemed rather conveniently timed, not to mention that she could easily have slept at Abby’s place. Cas suspected that she’d heard him cry out in his sleep last week, but she didn’t mention his nightmares, so neither did he.
Cas put his arm round Dean’s waist as they looked up at the paintings and pulled him close.
Dean paled enough to make his freckles stand out starkly and Sam’s eyebrows jumped so high that they just about went off his face.
familiar with that reference.” Cas’s eyes were slits now as he glared at him. Dean made a sad little moue of disappointment. It was a look that Cas could never resist, no matter how silly or dramatic Dean was being. Cas blew out a loud breath in resignation. “Oh, fine.”
“Well, that does put it in perspective,” Cas said. He didn’t sound entirely convinced, but he smiled when Dean reached out to put a hand on his knee.
“I’m happy now.” Cas smiled at him
She had light brown hair that was up in two high buns and she was wearing a turquoise embroidered silk jacket over khaki overalls. Clearly, she had the same lack of awareness as Charlie did about what constituted appropriate clubwear because she was twirling a paper parasol with colourful swirling stripes over her head. She was talking animatedly to a blond guy in a Hawaiian shirt while shooting flirty smiles at Charlie.
Cas had disappeared shortly after the gift exchange and they’d left him to it. That was until a bang and something that smelled suspiciously like smoke had emanated from the kitchen. Sam and Dean had gone in to investigate and found Cas standing in the middle of the kitchen looking sheepish. Sheepish and adorable actually. God knew where he’d found it, but Cas was wearing a ridiculous frilly floral apron. Dean thought it suited him oddly enough. It felt very homey, Cas in the kitchen cooking for him in a silly apron.
Cas has
zipper.
“Well good morning to you too, sweetheart,” Dean said, smirking.
Cas kissed him, which had the dual benefit of Dean not getting stared at anymore and once again getting to feel Cas’s lips against his own. Dean tried to kiss back harder, but Cas had taken control this time and he kept their kisses slow and gentle, forcing Dean to submit to his tenderness. Cas rolled them over until he was the one on top and ran his hands down Dean’s body while he clutched at Cas’s shoulders. He trailed kisses down Dean’s neck, pausing here and there to nip and suck. Cas lavished attention on Dean’s body, anointing his chest with soft lips and warm touches. Dean’s skin tingled. He buzzed with awareness at every point of contact between them. Dean felt more alive than he ever had before dying. Being with Cas this way, with all the walls that had been between them broken down, was like an awakening. It was all-consuming and glorious. Cas ran his tongue across Dean’s nipple and he keened.
But what if Dean couldn’t find the museum? No, that was silly. He had GPS on his phone and the building was pretty hard to miss. Well, the two buildings really, since the museum was essentially two buildings smooshed together, the shorter red brick building that Cas had visited when he first came here and the new ten-story white building that had sprung up a few years ago.
Most people didn't set out to fill themselves with poison, it was fed to them by someone else, at least at first. Some had the good sense to spit it out immediately, some didn't know any better than to swallow it down and some found they liked the taste and drank more and more until their insides were rotten and they spewed venom on other people every time they opened their mouths.
Bobby had paid over the odds for the twisted hunk of metal—an excuse to give John some money to help him look after the boys—and hauled the mangled car back to Kansas. Bobby had said that it seemed like the most convenient thing to do at the time since he knew someone with a truck who’d transport it to his junkyard for cheap, but Dean knew that wasn’t true.
Cas thought he was one of the few people that Dean let himself be vulnerable around. It felt like a privilege for him to see the unguarded side of Dean that Cas was pretty sure he normally only allowed himself to show to Charlie and his family.
Cas smiled at him and rubbed his knee and Dean knew he got it. After all, he had his own annoying brother to put up with now. The thought made him grin. Sam might be a bitch sometimes, but he wouldn’t change him for anything. He was glad that Cas got to reconnect with Gabriel and enjoy the mixture of joy and frustration that spending time with family inevitably brought.
Dean was just emerging from his room with the tray when Sam walked down the corridor. His glance took in the two cups on the tray and flicked to the slightly open door behind him. Dean followed his gaze to the bed. Cas was lying down again because there'd been more cuddling once the toast was finished. All that was visible from this angle was an indistinguishable lump beneath the covers. Dean pulled the door shut behind him and turned to face a smirking Sam.
When Dean was sixteen, Bobby had told him that the Impala was his if he wanted to fix it up. He’d spent the next two years doing that, coaxing his baby back to life. Dean had gotten a weekend job to pay for parts, and Bobby had taught him how to fix cars. It had been one of the proudest moments of his life when he first got behind the wheel of the car he’d fixed up himself, his very own car.
Oh right
“It’s certainly a perk.”
“Cas!” Dean cried out at the touch, jerking up.
They lay in comfortable silence for a while before Cas said out of nowhere, “I think I’d like to see Gabriel.”
Sidenote: I love Jensen’s over the top singing so much- Jensen singing
Sam grumbled but he looked happy enough with the gift. He had said that he wanted to improve his IT skills. He was pretty handy with computer, but it was a field that was always changing, so it was good to keep abreast of new tech. Dean thought Sam’s sudden interest in learning more might be somewhat motivated by jealousy. Dean had picked up some pretty nifty things from Frank and Charlie. Computers had always been more Sam’s thing, but now Dean’s expertise rivalled his own. Still, Dean wasn’t going to call him on it, partly because it would have been a bitch move to do so and partly because he thought it’d be good for Sam to learn more. Hacking was a useful skill for the modern hunter to have. Not that a mainstream computer magazine was likely to have tips on hacking, but it couldn’t hurt.
He reached for the bottle and poured himself another drink. Hopefully the safe sex lecture was over, at least for now. It would probably continue to be trotted out perennially, though.
“Well, I am going to go to bed. If you wish, you may join me when you’re ready or, if you’re going to continue on like this, you can sleep on the couch for all I care.”
Right, yeah, he had noticed that come to think of it. The other day Cas had shared some of the pie Dean was eating. And a few weeks ago, he had made himself a viciously hot vindaloo and Cas had taken a few forkfuls of it straight from Dean’s plate.
the cowboys.”
“It's a little on the nose to paint a demon's lair blood red, don't you think?” Cas said later as he rolled another stripe of paint up the wall.
“I'm not! I just want you to be happy.” He looked back at Cas, still stood hesitantly by the car. “You coming or what?”
“What?”
“Pretty sure what Sam told you was that I work in TV, not that I’m an actor. I’m strictly behind the camera now.” He smirked. “I doubt Sam would have mentioned my acting days.”
Dean found himself wishing he’d gotten a shot of whiskey at the bar downstairs before coming up. He could use a little liquid courage. Chatting up men just didn't come naturally to Dean. He suspected that had something to do with growing up hearing that it
Dean dragged him toward his small house and they stumbled through the door. Dean was still frantic and Cas let himself be pushed and shoved, unresisting under Dean’s strong hands. He pressed Cas up against the hallway wall so their whole bodies were flush once more. The distance from the car, with only their fingers clasped together, had been too much. Dean took Cas’s face in his hands and just took in his beauty for a moment. Dean felt almost afraid to look away. He tried to hold Cas with his gaze as well as his hands, still scared of him disappearing.
normally pretty good at inclusivity compared to a lot of shows and then they fall back on the tired, old bury-your-gays trope,” Cas said, shaking his head
Dean had texted Cas before he boarded to tell him when his plane was landing. Just so he’d know when Dean was back in the city, in case he wanted to make plans. Not because Dean had been having daydreams about an airport reunion, dammit. He certainly wasn’t envisioning Cas surprising him at the gate because he missed Dean so much and just couldn’t wait to see him. He definitely wasn’t imagining Cas running through Arrivals and jumping into his arms.
“It’s keyed to your face too,” Cas told him.
“And Dean?”
“Okay, you don’t like it. Then why don’t you up the damn voltage and heal me quick?”
It was a weird British recipe that Dean had found online. They were a Christmas pie, so Dean made them every year. The British knew how to do Christmas. Every holiday ought to have a pie in his opinion. Thanksgiving had pumpkin pie, Fourth of July was perfect for the most American of pies, apple, but what about Easter or New Year? They were prime pie occasions, and they were just being wasted. Maybe he should google it, perhaps other countries had Easter and New Year’s pies the way Britain had Christmas pies.
Cas trailed off. He wasn’t sure if that one word was an aborted attempt at an answer he couldn’t articulate or if it was the answer itself. Dean stared at him. Cas actually looked flustered, as flustered as an angel that emotionally repressed could look anyway.
“It's
Cas had started calling her Pazuzu years ago as a reference to the demon in
full of me ;)
Dean closed the distance between them and took Cas’s face in his hands.
As Dean had stopped to let him out near the shop, Cas had blurted out that they should meet up on the weekend too. He snapped his jaw shut as the last word left his mouth, but it was too late. He couldn’t take it back and he didn’t want to as soon as he saw the smile that bloomed on Dean’s face. It was warm and open and so, so happy.
Charlie walked over to the couch and smoothed her skirts out behind her as she sat. Despite her small frame, she took up almost the entirety of Dean's big leather sofa in her poofy dress. It should look at least a little silly, but it was Charlie, so somehow she managed to look regal in the ridiculous peaches and cream confection.
“Sometimes, a bee is just a bee, Dean,” Cas said, before continuing, “But, also, and don’t tell Meg I told you this,” Cas looked around the room like Meg might have snuck in to eavesdrop and lowered his voice, “it’s covering up a wonky bit on one of the hexagons. Meg hadn’t been tattooing very long when she inked this. Probably no one else would even notice the flaw in the linework, but she’s a perfectionist. It drove her nuts, seeing the crooked line every time she looked at my tattoo, so we decided to cover it up with a bee. But, if Meg asks, tell her I told you that it’s to thematically tie the tattoos of the honeycomb with the flowers.”
His hands went to the button on Cas’s jeans but didn’t try to undo it. Hesitantly, Dean asked, “Is this okay? I know it’s not exactly classy.” He bit his lip, looking like he was reconsidering. "You deserve better...”
“Who or what is Gay Bob?”
“Always.”
Cas raised an eyebrow. “I must say you acquitted yourself rather well last night for someone who’s not good at this.”
“You’re charming professionally?” Cas asked, tilting his head and squinting quizzically at him.
“I’m your husband,” he repeated. The possible kidnapper, the guy intent on holding him here against his will, looked unaccountably hurt. He was still lying on the floor, which made him seem small and harmless. Dean had to resist the urge to help him when he started to rise unsteadily, unable to brace himself properly on his bound hands. He took a step towards Dean once he’d found his feet. Dean made a noise and threw up one palm in a ‘stop’ gesture, the guy complied immediately.
“I couldn’t say it, Cas. You told me that the Empty would come for you if you experienced a moment of true happiness. I didn’t want to make you happy. I didn’t want to tell you I loved you when it might end you. I thought maybe if I didn’t say it, the Empty wouldn’t take you. But you were happy anyway, just telling me you loved me and expecting nothing in return," Dean said, tears running down his face. "But I do love you. I love you so much.”
They sat down at the table that Bobby had probably had since before Dean and Jo were born. He remembered sitting at it doing his high school homework. And it still had knife marks on it from when Jo had sat there and played five-finger fillet as a moody teen trying to impress her dumb friends with her toughness. Ellen served the same stew at that table that she must have served them hundreds of times. It tasted just like home and Dean ate three bowls.
Sam raised his eyebrows and then just sat there shaking his head, confused, whatever he was looking at on his laptop forgotten. Dean’s attention was all for Cas though.
It shouldn’t be a big deal, but it was. The only other married queer guys on TV Cas could think of were that couple on
“Role playing? We’re not role playing!” He looked down at the guy, horrified, and belatedly realised what he could feel pressed against his stomach.
Cas had gotten good at putting first-timers at ease and could chat amiably with nervous customers, even if it always felt a little like performing a role. The clients he liked best were people with dozens of tattoos and regulars who didn't care if he spoke more than two words in a three-hour session though.
“Buddy, you are messing with the wrong fags. You should walk away.”
“Yes... No! Cas isn’t some hookup. We're...together... like a thing, with feelings and stuff,” Dean said, shrugging awkwardly.
“Um, yeah, I think I'd like that,” Dean admitted and pushed the tray he was holding into Sam’s hands. “Can you take this to the kitchen? I'm just going to, uh, check on Cas.”
Sam made a face like he really didn’t want to know if Dean meant that literally.
I was a fan of that too
He woke about an hour later judging by the episode on TV. The screen showed Spike laying siege to Sunnydale High School.
“Sorry, babe, Sam picked this place, but it’s my choice next time. We can go somewhere nice then,” Dean assured him.
“You’re thinking of Thanksgiving, sweetheart. There isn’t normally a game on Christmas,” Dean said, leaning up against the counter next to Cas.
Dean made an unhappy noise. Cas thought he was probably thinking back to when he’d been a teenager before he’d moved in with Bobby. He knew that Dean had worked various low paid jobs trying to earn enough to look after Sam when their dad would disappear for long stretches and not leave them enough money to live on. Dean, too, knew what it was like to struggle to survive. Though, he had a tendency to think his own struggles were par for the course while hating anyone he cared about having to struggle the way he had.
a few years ago. Puddles or something.”
Cas shifted uncomfortably in his seat across the table from Sam and Dean.
Pushing aside his thoughts of Christmas, Dean focused on the here and now instead, enjoying the opportunity to spend time with Cas in his own space. Cas letting him into his home made Dean feel like he was one step closer to Cas letting him into his heart. He slept in Cas’s bed for the first time that night. It wasn’t memory foam, but sleeping next to Cas more than made up for that.
“That’s the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever heard!” Cas sputtered. He gave Dean a pointed look but had to admit that, despite its silliness, Dean’s easy-going banter did set him at ease.
A sharp breath burst out of Dean. He wet his lips before squeaking out, "Me?"
Sam was rubbing Gabriel’s shoulder gently as he spoke. It was strange to see him looking so subdued. Dean didn’t really know what to make of it after all the jeering laughter.
Bobby had come to visit them in the small town of the month to help out while they recovered from the accident. When he found out that John had been driving drunk, he’d lost his shit. It was one thing to risk his own stupid neck, but to endanger the boys, how could he do that? Of course, John had gone straight into defensive mode—he’d only had a few drinks, he knew how to damn well drive a car and the accident was the truck driver's fault, he could take care of his boys and it wasn’t any of Bobby’s business. Bobby had insisted John get help with his drinking and John had insisted that Bobby fuck off.
Dean kept his mouth shut because Bobby wasn’t wrong.
After several jaw cracking yawns from Dean, Cas patted his lap and asked, “Do you want to lie down?”
Aw Cas, were you worried about me?
“And a twink?”
“Well, they're not giant. They're microscopic. So, not quite the same as
Dean ran his fingertips over the fuzzy little bumblebee that perched on the edge of the honeycomb. “So, what’s the bee represent?”
“Is this like the fancy, artistic version of the back row of a movie theatre? Did you just bring me here to fool around?” Dean asked laughing.
“Why are you so preoccupied with me having sex?” the angel asked, perplexed.
“Mostly,” Cas agreed, going over to the bed to kiss Dean on the cheek. “Want some breakfast? I thought I could make us scrambled eggs.”
CW for suicide obviously. This video is interesting but the topic of historic/religious attitudes to suicide might be triggering for some.
“And that doesn’t seem weird to you? Like I was a little too enthusiastic? Not myself maybe? I ain’t the marrying kind. It’s not me.”  He exhaled forcefully and rubbed the back of his neck. “Sam... there’s a picture here of us, me and that guy. And my expression in that photo, I swear I’ve never worn that dopey ass smile a day in my life!”
“Yes.” Cas took their joined hands, raised them to his lips and softly kissed Dean’s knuckles. “I was planning on finishing that old Men of Letters report I’ve been reading anyway. I’ll be in the library.”
The paintings might be low on old-fashioned gunslingers, but Cas thought they were very striking. The canvases were on either side of a sweeping staircase, so your perspective of them changed subtly as you walked up the stairs. Cas loved the size of the paintings. They loomed over the museum patrons like the legacy of colonialism loomed over America.
Cas grinned smugly at having fucked Dean so thoroughly that he could barely move.
He and Cas were enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon together, sitting on Cas’s couch while he sketched and Dean cleared a few work emails before the coming week. He’d turned his attention to Cas once he’d sent off the last email.
was a formative experience in my youth. It’s like required viewing for young lesbians,
He scrambled back into bed next to Cas and starting spreading peanut butter on a slice of toast. When he was done, he poured a ridiculous amount of syrup on it and handed it to Cas.
“Husband,” Cas corrected.
“Drama queen!” Charlie said, shoving at his shoulder playfully when he said as much to her.
baby,” Cas said. But Dean didn’t care, because despite Cas’s snark, his hand had found its way into Dean’s hair and was gently stroking through it, even as Cas’s eyes found the screen again and refused to look at him. Dean turned back to the screen too but couldn’t keep his eyes open. He drifted off to sleep feeling warm and happy.
“I’m gonna grab some breakfast. I’ll be back in a sec. Why don’t you wait here?” Dean felt rather reluctant to let Cas out of his bed now he finally had him there.
Even though Cas assured him that everything was fine, Dean still wanted to find a way to make it up to him. It was just that he wasn’t great at apologies. As far as past relationships went, if he fucked up, he’d just try to buy forgiveness with a gift. He really didn’t think some gas station flowers were going to cut it this time. Flowers had never seemed like the best apology anyway. Here, have some dying plants and be reminded of the terrible thing I did while you watch them wither. Better to get something meaningful. But what did you get an angel who wanted for nothing? Cas wasn’t materialistic. He didn’t care about possessions unless they had sentimental value, like his trench coat. Dean didn’t think he would ever give up that particular worldly good. He did like to give his husband material things sometimes. The fact that they came from Dean tended to give the items automatic sentimental value as far as Cas was concerned. Mostly though, if he wanted to give Cas a gift, he gave him an experience. That was what Cas cherished most. Dean had been trying to think of something special to do for Cas since he got his memories back.
Gabriel pronounced ‘pied-à-terre’ with a pretentious French accent that Dean thought was totally unnecessary. He had no clue how Gabriel knew his friend in the FBI had found him. He was sure he hadn’t mentioned Vic’s involvement to Sam. He’d barely mentioned anything to Sam since Cas’s past was private and not something he’d share, even with Sam, without making sure Cas was okay with it. But Gabriel was a damn know-it-all. Who could say how he’d found out?
Who is this?
“Tell me your last name.”
“What’s that mean?”
He gave Dean’s hip a warning squeeze, reminding him to stay still, before he released it in favour of taking hold of Dean’s cock. His other hand kept up its teasing as he leant down and took the head of Dean’s cock in his mouth. Cas swirled his tongue around the tip languidly. The dual sensations of hand and tongue made Dean moan and Cas smiled around his cock at the sound. He swallowed more of Dean’s length down as he slowly pressed a finger inside him. Cas pushed the single digit in and out gently until he felt Dean relax enough to take another. He moved his fingers unhurriedly, working Dean open while he sucked him. Cas crooked his fingers slightly, rubbing them more firmly across his prostate. Dean was panting and coming apart under his attentions. He made a desperate sound that was almost a sob. Cas drew back his head and removed his fingers carefully.
“Darling?” Dean couldn’t help interrupting.
Dean was sitting on the loveseat, with the lube on the coffee table in front of him, when Cas got back. Three bottles of it, because he’d found another two on his second pass of the cabin. He raised an interrogatory eyebrow at the angel.
“Dude, I thought she was your best friend. Has she met you?”
Maybe a small part of him wanted Cas to push him, maybe not such a small part.
“Made it so that he’ll understand,” Cas said cryptically.
“Like the real animal.”
Gabriel was sitting in one of the cheerful, little pastel green booths. He was wearing a shit-eating grin that rubbed Dean the wrong way. He gave them a jaunty wave while they stood there perplexed. A moment later, Sam emerged from the back where the restrooms were. He waved at them too before going to sit next to Gabriel.
Dean’s contribution to the conversation was mostly moans and him saying ‘please, Cas,’ over and over. He didn’t even know what he was asking for since Cas was miles away and couldn’t touch him, but from Cas’s own sighs and gasps, Dean was pretty sure him begging was turning Cas on as much as his words were turning Dean on.
“I am a knight, but I’m not going to actually wear a full suit of armour to a club,” Abby explained, unzipping her jacket and revealing a chainmail bra. “I ended up going for the classic video game interpretation of female armour. Not exactly battle-ready, but I think my boobs would be somewhat protected against glancing blows.”
“Ooh, let’s listen to some queercore,” Charlie suggested enthusiastically. “There are more queer musicians out there than Mercury and Halford.”
“You’re thinking too much,” he said, tunnelling his hands into Dean’s hair. “Just kiss me, baby.”
Dean narrowed his eyes at them both as they walked over to the booth.
“I’m sorry. It's hard for me to remember you might not know these things,” Cas told him, managing to look as resentful as he was apologetic.
They went into the kitchen, and Dean started looking through the cupboards. When he noticed Cas was standing aimlessly in the centre of the room, Dean pressed a kiss to his cheek and guided him to sit down at the kitchen counter before going back to his rummaging.
“Like Madonna says?” Cas asked.
“What do you think?”
He moved again and this time Dean let him go to his knees. He was only human after all. Besides, while it was easy to stop Cas from doing something he didn’t want, it was a lot harder to stop Cas from doing something he knew Dean did want. He was already shaking slightly by the time Cas undid his jeans. He wouldn’t last long, the view of Cas on his knees alone left him breathless. And Cas always gave the most intense head. Either, he had his eyes shut tight in concentration, like fellatio required the same brain power as complicated geometry equations and he had to calculate the angle of the next lick just right. Or, he was looking up at Dean intently. Dean had been known to do the sexy eye contact thing while giving head too, maybe throw in a flirty we’re-both-having-fun-here wink. But Cas would look up at him fiercely like he was gazing right into his soul, like he could take that soul into his own, the way he took Dean’s body into his own. He was gazing up at him now, eyes full of love and lust. That look on his face and the sight of his lips wrapped around Dean’s girth was too much. Dean came with a feeling of deep catharsis, sighing as he emptied himself inside Cas.
Cas had seen
“But I want to, I really fucking want to,” he assured Cas and pulled him down into a breathless kiss.
“Yes,” Cas said, trying to sound more determined than he felt.
Dean wasn’t sure what qualified as girl time with those two. He was pretty sure it involved plotting world domination, though. Dean hung out with Sam as he caught up with Bobby and Ellen for an hour or two before Ellen called it a night.
“What was your childhood like?” Cas asked curiously.
“A work of art in progress,” Dean told him, running his fingers over an inked forearm.
want to fuck Cas in a bar bathroom. He wanted to fuck him anywhere Cas would have him. But he also had some sappy idea that their first time ought to be special. If there wasn’t going to be candles and roses, there should at least be a bed. He grabbed Cas’s hand, hauled him to his feet and hurried him outside.
Dean, I’m Dean. Nice to, uh, meet you.” Dean smiled brightly at him. This couldn’t be going that badly if he’d managed to get the guy's name. Just got to keep the conversation flowing. “So, uh, is the teardrop part of your costume?”
“Don't say it. Don’t you dare say it,” Cas said, narrowing his eyes at him.
“Bon Jovi?” Sam asked dubiously.
“Seriously? Wow, that’s some sci-fi shit right there,” Dean said and Cas grinned at him. “So, you just get tattoos of things you think are cool then?”
“But I didn’t even bring it this time. It was already here after last time. We always have lube, Dean.”
“Everything has a dark side perhaps, or everything good has a cost, or conversely, where there’s dark, there’s light?” Cas said thoughtfully.
John had looked so shocked that Dean had opened his mouth to say a teammate must have put it in his bag as a joke, but something—hope, stubbornness, he wasn’t sure—had shut his mouth back up and stopped the excuses from pouring out. No mistake, no joke, Dean liked dick. And John hadn’t been happy to find that out.
Dean wasn’t sure what to do either because wanted to do everything with Cas, he wanted to suck him deep into his throat, to touch him everywhere, he wanted Cas's mouth all over his body, he wanted to beg Cas to let him fuck his ass, maybe he even wanted
After a moment, Cas pulled out and took the condom off.
“It’s nothing special, but I got you a little something,” he told Cas gruffly.
“Can’t I?” Cas asked, raising an eyebrow at Dean and giving him a smug look. Dean grinned at him because Cas being smug was oddly charming. He wasn’t sure if Cas was so pleased with himself because he’d turned a homophobe gay or made a joke about turning Dean gay. Cas was always rather proud of himself when he made a joke.
Cas spun round. “Dean!”
“Very original, Meg.”
for a while before deciding to order dinner.
At some point, someone had broken out the eggnog, and they’d all gotten a bit merry. Bobby got tipsy enough to pull his wife onto his lap in front of everyone, and Ellen got tipsy enough to allow it. Rufus got tipsy enough to crack a smile. Jo drank just enough to play charades without bitching about it. Charlie couldn’t control her giggling every time Jo mimed something with a bit too much enthusiasm. Sam snuck off to make a phone call and thought he was being subtle about it, even though he was doing that drunk person whispering thing that was almost as loud as a sober person yelling. Dean had just enough eggnog to not overthink calling Cas to say Merry Christmas... well, not to overthink it too much.
“Dean, he’s your husband, you’re confused, you got hit by a spell-”
Cas looked up at the museum as the fingers of his right hand danced along the back of his left forearm. He tried to think about something other than Dean not turning up, but instead of not worrying, he just found himself worrying about a different topic.
Dean took the cocoa out and found a pan to heat the milk. He rushed around the kitchen in a cocoa-making frenzy, as if a nice hot drink was of the utmost importance and would definitely fix whatever had made Cas wake up screaming. He added sugar and marshmallows to the cocoa before offering it to Cas with a flourish.
“I'm... it's not... It's not about ‘equipment’. I can't just have meaningless sex with someone I don't know. If I f-fucked..." Cas stumbled over the word before saying it more emphatically, “If I
Dean beamed at him and said, “Yeah, I’d like that.”
Cas retreated to the back room for a bit to get ready for his appointments, still thinking about what Meg had said. Being a tattoo artist did involve interactions with customers and thereby necessitate some customer service skills on his part. It wasn't like being a hairdresser who was expected to chat with clients about their upcoming holidays, but people did seem to expect at least
“Shut up. I like it.” Meg flicked her own roller at him and landed a splatter of paint on his nose.
“Minor mishap. It’s fine now,” Cas said unconvincingly, while shooting glances at the oven like he half expected it to explode.
And, if Dean was honest, maybe he’d wanted to protect John, not let the world know what a shitty father he was and expose him to Bobby’s anger and judgement. He’d idolised his father as a kid. God only knew why since John had never done anything to deserve it. Dean had known by the time he was a teenager that John didn’t deserve his adulation, but he’d still been loyal to him.
Dean liked penetration, but he'd never come from that alone before Cas. Something about Cas fucking him was better than bottoming had ever been with anyone else. Everything with Cas was better than it had been with anyone else. He wished Cas was there with him now. Wished he was there kissing him and filling him up. And Dean wished he was there to hold him afterwards so he could fall asleep in his arms.
“You shut your mouth—my Baby would never hurt me!”
“Are you calling me or Ken a cock slut?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows and grabbing his beer from the counter to take a swig.
Cas sniffed it thoughtfully before taking a sip, which he valiantly managed not to spit out when Dean asked him, “So, what kind of guy do you think you'd like? Leather daddy, twink, bear, otter?”
“Hmm, don’t think we’ve got any in tonight,” he said sounding... disappointed?
and Cas couldn’t believe it was happening again.
Dean moaned again. He missed all that too. He wanted Cas's body wringing pleasure from his own in the way only Cas could. He missed his body so much. But he also missed his essential Cas-ness.
“Yep, that’s the guy,” Cas agreed sardonically. “He’s all peace and love until someone has a mental illness and then fuck them, I guess, off to hell for you!”
Dean made another promise to himself to be nicer... it didn’t last very long this time around either.
Dean had been reading the same page for an hour. So, it was a relief when Sam finally said goodnight and went to his room. That meant they could go to theirs...well, Dean’s room really but somehow it already felt like theirs because Dean wanted to sleep next to Cas every night now.
“You gonna keep me here?” Dean challenged.
“Yes,” Cas murmured, a little surprised.
“Yeah, there's just not many queer bands I listen to regularly.”
“Shit, Cas, I didn’t mean to bring crap up. I get it, well, I kinda get it. My mom’s gone and I don’t talk to my dad anymore, wouldn’t want to, but at least me and Sam still have a home to go back to. We usually spend Christmas in Kansas with our uncle Bobby and his wife, Ellen. They’re not blood, but they’re family. Charlie comes most years too.”
“Dude, I’m aware porn is not real life!”
He put the condoms on the bed and handed Cas the lube. Cas spread some on his fingers and went right back to kissing Dean. Dean shifted and opened his legs for Cas, but Cas didn’t touch him straight away. Instead, he focused on driving Dean insane with his tongue.
“I think I’d be pretty pissed if someone desecrated my corpse in general, but it feels like adding insult to injury to pass moral judgment while doing so.” Dean made an unimpressed face.
“Yes, yes...” he murmured in approval when he felt Cas’s hands go to his fly. Cas was driving him wild and he was so, so ready for more. His own hands reached to undo Cas’s pants too and he was surprised when Cas batted them away. And a little concerned that Cas wasn’t craving Dean’s touch the way he was craving his, that Dean wasn’t making him just as crazy as he was.
For a moment when he got here, Dean thought it would be okay, that he really had made it to heaven. Bobby had been sitting there waiting for him. He’d told him that Cas helped fix heaven. When he said ‘he'll be along,’ Dean had thought he meant Cas, not Sam. Not that he hadn't wanted to see his brother but it was Cas who was missing when he got to heaven, it was Cas that would make it perfect. Dean had faith that Sam was alive and that he’d be happy. He was in no rush for his brother to join him here in the afterlife. He was desperate to see Cas though. Losing him like that, seeing him taken and knowing he was going to the Empty, a dark place where Dean could never reach him, it was unbearable. More than anything, he needed to see Cas. He needed to know he was okay. He needed a chance to tell him how he felt. Even without all the unresolved issues between them, Cas was his best friend. He should be here. It wasn't heaven without him. He couldn't be happy without him.
Dean took Cas’s arm and raised it to his lips, kissing the lines of his tattoo. He shifted to face Cas more fully and curved his hand around his cheek. “You’re so strong, Cas.”
“I wish I was.”
Bobby had always been protective, of course, but Dean hadn’t been accustomed to it anymore because they hadn’t spoken much since the falling out. John wouldn’t let Bobby see the boys and it had been hard to stay in touch by phone.
Cas smiled and followed him over. Dean sat in the corner and Cas chose to sit in the middle next to him instead of the other end of the couch. He settled comfortably into the leather, pulling one knee up, elbow leaning on the back of the couch and angling his body toward Dean. He put his beer down on the low table in front of them while Dean held onto his so he could gulp it down anxiously. His habitual awkwardness with men had usually dissipated by now, but something about Cas made him nervous as hell.
“Sounds uncomfortable! Maybe you pass the extras out to friends as party favours?”
“Me too.” Cas smiled back at him for a moment before saying, “I can think of a piece you might like.”
They were both dressed ridiculously, and it was just as comfortable as hanging out in sweatpants. Not for the first time, Dean thought how lucky he was to have such an awesome best friend. They chatted about random shit until they finished their beers and got ready to leave.
Cas walked out of his apartment building just as Dean pulled up. He looked hotter than usual, although maybe that was just the effect of not having seen him for two whole days. He was wearing dark jeans, a Doors t-shirt and the leather biker jacket that Dean always thought he looked fucking sexy in.
They finally entered the bedroom a moment later and Dean pulled Cas down on top of him on the bed, relishing having his solid weight covering him again. Cas kissed him thoroughly before moving down to suck marks along Dean’s neck. He continued moving lower until the progress of his mouth was hindered by the collar of Dean’s stupid mesh t-shirt and he seemed to realise they were both still clothed.
“Of course, you love me! I'm very lovable. Aren't I, sugarplum?” He fluttered his lashes at Sam.
where they had to cut a metal cock ring off some guy’s swollen dick and, just no, no, thank you, not worth it. Sure, the metal looks classier than a silicone one, but I do not want a circular saw near my dick if things go awry!”
Cas was watching Dean with quiet concern. His expression was so gentle that it broke his heart a little. He knew that Cas was scared to upset the fragile truce between them. Worried that anything he said might be the thing that pushed Dean away again, made Dean push him away. He should never have let Cas go. How could he do that to his best friend? To the man he... loved. He was so scared to love him, could barely admit it to himself, never mind to Cas. He tried not to think about it as they sat silently at the kitchen table. Now was the time for drinking, not for thinking. He swallowed the last of his whisky and wondered why he hadn’t bought the bottle over to the table with him.
“Alright, alright, I’ll shut up.” Charlie made a show of zipping her lips.
The eyeliner made Cas look like he was crying blood, which he didn’t think helped him look any more cheerful. It was sparkly though, so maybe it was the glitter that was meant to make bleeding from your eyes a happy experience. Or maybe Meg just thought people haemorrhaging from their orbital cavities was fun. It was hard to tell with her. And it was Halloween, so he supposed gore was in the spirit of things.
—“in a West Coast Gang?”
He slid one hand up from Cas’s back to his head and pulled him in for another deep kiss. Cas groaned and thrust against him lazily. Dean moaned in return and finally let go of his death grip on Cas to shove his coat down over his shoulders.
sooner if I knew it had a hot Billy Idol wannabe in it,” Cas said when he noticed Dean was awake.
Cas and the other kids his age in the congregation didn't go to the local mall to loiter like their classmates did, they went to hand out leaflets. His father seemed to be under the impression that having the teen members of the Church do outreach work would attract younger people to the flock.
why haven’t you used your special angel powers and zapped me back to health?”
Cas entered the back room where Meg was blasting ‘Bad Ass Bitch’ by the Lunachicks while she sorted through ink, checking bottles and boxes.
Dean bumped his knuckles against Gabriel’s and then shifted in his seat. “So, um, since it’s your show and all, could you get me into the studio to meet him, meet Dr. Sexy?”
Cas lowered himself to lie across Dean and began a leisurely exploration of his mouth. He pressed soft kisses to his lips and licked inside, mapping the contours with his tongue. The tender attention left Dean feeling a little vulnerable in a way that shoving someone up against a wall and fucking their brains out never did. But, he supposed, this wasn’t just fucking, this was making love and Dean didn’t normally do that. It scared him a little. He didn’t push Cas away though, he pulled him closer. Dean gripped his shoulders and sighed into his mouth.
“Bon Jovi rocks,” Dean defended himself as he turned the car key and Baby rumbled to life. “On occasion,” he clarified, pointing an emphatic finger at Sam and pulling away from the bunker.
“I’m here now,” Cas whispered and placed a soft, comforting kiss on his lips.
Minor spoilers for late season 1 and early season 2 of Star Trek: Discovery. I don’t go into any detail but an important plot point is mentioned. Honestly, I would have preferred to know this in advance but you may not, so if you’d prefer not to avoid spoilers then when you get to “An actual gay married couple on TV!” skip six paragraphs down to “I just think they’re amazing creatures.” (Also, I’m not a hundred percent sure Stamets and Hugh are married. I thought they were but one of my betas said they’d read something that said they weren’t and I can’t find a definitive answer online. But I think they’re married, so Cas also thinks they’re married!)
She kicked her feet up onto the coffee table, revealing a pair of pink high-top Converse that matched the ruffles at the bottom of her skirt. Charlie would put up with a lot in the name of cosplay, but she wouldn't wear heels if she could help it. The dress was floor length and you didn't see Kaylee's shoes on the show, ergo, Converse weren't technically inaccurate for the costume. Kaylee could have been wearing anything under those long skirts.
This was the kind of design that made Cas proud of his work. Satisfied, Cas spent the afternoon reading the new fantasy novel that he’d picked up from the library but hadn’t been able to focus on this past week. Then, he ended the day comfortably curled on the couch next to Meg watching the latest show she’d picked for them to binge together. He was feeling almost like himself again.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. Sex was simpler than emotions. Dean knew the two went together when it came to Cas but he couldn’t help focusing on the physical. That was the part he knew how to do. He could make Cas happy in bed, let Cas make him happy, in a way he couldn’t quite manage outside of the bedroom. Dean gave him a quick whiskey flavoured kiss before leading Cas to his room.
thing that made Dean realise he wasn’t straight, but it was certainly a contributing factor to his teenage bisexual awakening.
“Punk fan, eh?”
“I’m not sure what to do...” Cas admitted, biting his lip as he unzipped him.
Dean hopped out of the Impala and lead the way to the entrance, opening the door.
“Yes, let’s listen to that,” Cas piped up.
Luckily, Cas was looking amused and not like his cock had shrivelled up and done its best to retract inside his body in response to the picture Dean had painted. “Put a lot of thought into this, have you?”
“Okay, sweetheart. I’ll talk to him.”
“Cas, if you want to do something else—if you want to stay home and talk—we can do that. Absolutely. But you are not spending tonight staring at the wall moping. This isn’t helping.” She was looking at him with concern, none of the teasing in her tone that had been there just moments earlier.
“That makes zero sense.”
Dean didn't know how long he'd been here. Time was different. It seemed like only moments in some ways, but minutes felt like years without Cas. It must be years in actuality because Sam had joined him and he knew his brother had lived a long life. Cas had had plenty of time to come find him but he hadn’t. Days, years, it didn’t matter, it felt like an eternity.
Bobby got up from the table to grab a bottle of whiskey and pour them all a glass. Sitting back down, he said, “So, catch me up on the rest of what you’ve been doing in the big city. What’s new? How are your jobs going? Either of you boys seeing anyone?”
“I promise not to come home knocked up, Uncle Bobby,” Dean said innocently, earning him a glare.
Eventually the words penetrated and Cas realised that there were no hands around his throat, just Dean’s hands on his shoulders shaking him awake. Dean let go as Cas sat up, but the shaking continued and it took Cas a moment to realise that it was him, trembling. Dean turned away to switch on the bedside lamp. His hands were back on Cas as soon as he turned around again, pulling him into his arms and stroking his back soothingly.
“You brought someone home? Only you could hookup with a woman at an actual gay bar!” Sam was shaking his head and looking incredulous.
“I hate that you ever felt so low,” Dean said softly, stroking his arm again.
mindful of Castiel’s pleasure. And he watched him with love in his eyes.
“Sure, let’s start over,” he agreed, because Dean was looking at him hopefully.
“I don’t have a home to go back to, just someplace I grew up, and it’s not somewhere that I ever plan on returning to.”
“I'm still not bottoming.”
“Fine, asshole, I’ll cover reception, but Alfie better be here soon.”
They hung out watching old episodes of
“You should always be in my bed, covered in my come.”
Dean adored the look of intense concentration on his face, the quiet satisfaction he showed when he figured out the rules of the game and the little nod of approval he gave when one of the players made a home run. His heart swelled with love until it was almost painful, or maybe that was just heartburn from the hotdog. He looked at Cas, no, it was definitely an inordinate amount of love surging through him. This man. This man meant so much to him that he didn’t know where to put all of these feelings.
Cas held the door open for him and Dean grinned at him before he went through. He pulled up short when he saw who was sitting opposite the door. Cas bumped into him and put his hands on Dean’s hips to steady himself before looking over Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel laughed a touch hysterically.
“Right? Ziggy Stardust I know!” Dean looked thoughtfully at the red smear on Cas’s cheek. “I hate to tell you this, but I think your friend might have intended your costume—what there was of it—to be the sad clown dude who was on
“Well, he preserved her head and shoulders, but she had cuts on her skin from where she’d been pulled out of a river. He couldn’t get rid of them, so he disguised them by turning her into this sort of diorama. He added preserved snakes and made it look like they were strangling and biting her. It was supposed to be a representation of the way suicide victims went to hell and got punished for eternity for being fucking depressed. I guess laws about what you could do to random corpses or moral decency weren’t a thing in Italy in that day and age.”
Dean couldn't decide if he was annoyed about the magazine because of some weird impulse to protect Cas from anything that might be slightly sordid, or because he was the only one who was allowed to corrupt Cas. Probably the latter. It was Dean’s job to teach Cas about sex, not Sam’s and certainly not a porno mag’s. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to know what picture Cas was looking at. Either it was going to be something he wished Cas hadn’t learnt about from a magazine this early on in their relationship. Or it was going to be something he really freaking wanted Cas to do right now. Dean didn’t particularly want to spend the remainder of their gift exchange with an awkward hard-on while he tried to focus on doing Christmas bullshit instead of whisking Cas back to their bedroom. He wanted to do dirty things to Cas, god, so many dirty things, but he didn’t want to rush Cas into anything he wasn’t ready for. He only wanted to do those filthy things if Cas was comfortable and only if Cas knew what they were doing was in the context of a committed relationship. He still had this niggling fear that Cas might think that Dean only wanted sex. He needed Cas to know that, unlike the pizzaman and the babysitter, he truly loved him. Of course, the sensible thing to do would just be to tell him that, but since when did Dean do the sensible thing?
He pulled Cas, and then Sam, who he was only slightly mad at now, into a hug. Dean kissed Cas’s cheek and wondered idly if he could make a beer that Cas would like when he got the hang of brewing. Maybe something citrusy, with a pillowy-soft body and fruity hops.
Dean sighed happily. He was full of mince pies, eggnog and Christmas cheer. Dean freaking loved the holidays. He’d hated them as a kid because John always ignored them and Sammy was inevitably disappointed by the lack of turkey and presents and there was only so much Dean could do to make up for that when there was no money and often no kitchen to cook in even if he could afford a turkey. But now holidays were full of presents, food and family.
