Thoughts and pictures danced in front of his eyes of an alternate him: the Castiel in his late twenties who hadn’t moved away at eighteen to get married, who had stayed focused on his career and had accomplishments to boast of and stamps in his passport.
Hannah had tried to pick some insufferable animated film involving an anthropomorphized band of jungle birds which Castiel literally, pardon the expression, could not stomach. Luckily, he'd managed to steer her a bit more towards his own tastes, if not completely within their bounds. So now, they're watching
Cas pokes his head into the bedroom next to his and knocks his fist on the door in two quick successions. He takes a second as he stands there in the doorway to let his eyes take in the room. He rather like the mint green color of the walls, it’s overtly feminine like a lot of little girls’ rooms. He hopes he can convince her to keep it.
The grimace on Dean's face is undeniable. There's a lot of way he’s changed in the past few years, Cas is sure. But it doesn't seem as if one of those way is a sudden total reversal of his opinion on documentary films. (
. The word stills ruffles Castiel when he hears it, the single syllable dripping of hyper masculine bullshit. He grimaces with his back to his his roommate. “Yes?”
After a painfully long time, Dean moves to stand up. “Okay, fine," he mutters darkly, throwing the blankets off of himself as he slides off the mattress. "Whatever.”
“Where’s the pie?!” Gabriel yells from his spot on the living room couch. Leave it to him to have an eye on dessert at all times.
Cas does his best to stay composed long enough to shoot a glare at Dean. “It isn’t. I'm- I have to... go. Shower.”
Behind the bathroom door, Castiel hears the sound of a faucet running, and he knows his time is running out.
Dean tugs off his pants in the blink of an eye, and clumsily crawls over Castiel to get into his spot on the mattress. He reeks of booze, Castiel instantly notices, though he hadn’t expected any less. Dean lays his head on the pillow beside Castiel and nestles into the shoulder he finds there. A strong arm wraps around Cas’ middle, as if claiming a spot for itself before Cas can tell him to get it off.
Actually, now that Castiel is thinking about it, that’s probably for the best. Maybe his performance was just subtle enough that Dean wouldn’t even think it was weird. Of course, he was never going to… what? Be jealous? Of Alfie?
“Oh, I’m sorry. I... guess I was.” Castiel is both mortified and very confused. He excuses himself, and Lisa thanks him once more for returning her treasured item, and then he wanders off once more toward the exit.
"Alright," is all he says, though. The word is heavy, weighted, and it means more than it voices. But Dean's glad he doesn't have to keep talking about this, at least. "I'll let you get some rest, then. I'm sure you need it. If you need anything, I'm just out here." He tosses a hand towards the couch, which looks old and too small for him.
He looks up from under thick lashes, batting them nervously, or maybe flirtatiously. Whichever it is, Castiel doesn’t like to see it. He pulls back his hand finally, trying to put physical distance between him and the boy who’s heart he is apparently about to break.
“No,” Cas cut him off with a hand raised and a weary tone, “That’s.... that’s alright. I believe you... I suppose.”
This feels oddly familiar, he thinks. It’s not as rushed or sloppy or passionate as normal-- but this is hardly their first kiss. Castiel can do this. He knows he can.
Hannah’ continues to giggle to herself, her hands cupped over her gap-toothed little grin. Her eyes crinkle when she smiles, a favorite trait of Castiel’s that she’d doubtlessly picked up from her other dad.
Come to think of it, he doesn’t actually remember getting into bed last night. He would have thought he’d have passed out on the c--
The shirts are nice, too. But Dean knows he's still going to wear Cas' t-shirts, anyway. Sometimes, at least.
It was performance, all of it. Not that he’d lost all interest in Lisa. She was still as attractive as the day they’d met. But his heart wasn’t in it any longer. Every time he kissed her, it was like a betrayal to Cas, and that thought struck a chord much deeper inside him.
"It's fine," Dean tells her. It's not, and she knows it, but there's no use in making her feel worse.
All the while he’s walking back to his own room, Castiel can’t stop thinking. About Alfie, and Dean. Dean and Alfie. He’s never been much of a Casanova himself, so he hasn’t had the opportunity to go around breaking hearts, or having his broken. There’d been a few things in high school, he certainly wasn’t a saint-- but those things were flings, casual. Not strings attached. No feelings.
Castiel must be able to tell what he’s thinking. He usually can, which Dean finds especially annoying right now. “I… have a meeting this morning," he explains more clearly, "I’m… going in late.”
“Oh, while I have you, I wanted to ask you if you could take her next Thursday night,” he says suddenly when the thought strikes. Dean just stares at him for a moment. He begins to add on, “If you can’t it’s no problem, I can have Anna or Gabe take her, but I figured it’s only a day early and you might want to have her...”
Castiel decides not to over analyze anything, for tonight at least. In the morning, he can re-evaluate his fucked-up and masochistic tendencies… but right now, he needs his rest.
So there he was: on the wrong side of forty, strapped down in suburbia... and he couldn't be happier. And to top it all off: he was in a band. With a bunch of dads.
He takes a moment to try and compare what he does know with the idea he'd already had of Castiel in his head. It would have been easy for him to be a dumb, jockhead alpha, it sounds like. Just like Dean would have been, if he'd presented that way.
Just the thought of Cas rolling around on his sheets, all slicked up and covered in sweat, his fingers working on himself like he couldn’t fucking get enough-- the thought had Dean rock hard in a way he’d never been in his entire life, including puberty. He wondered to himself if he was starting to rut-- he'd heard that happened sometimes with mates, true mate: one’s heat could set off the other’s rut, and vice versa.
An instantaneous feeling of joy floods into Castiel. He grips his phone tight in one hand and smiles into the camera. “Well, hello, my little munchkin,” his voice sing-songs, “To what do I owe the pleasure of this phone call?”
Castiel looks up and finds Dean’s eyes. They’re green, like the trees in summer, and bright and comforting. He thinks he could find home there. It feels like it now, anyway.
And it was this great, brave thing he was doing- or at least that's what everyone told Cas. They were all so proud of Dean: his brother, their friends, even Dean's dad, who was fairly stingy with his declarations of affection, Cas had seen. So he couldn't hold it against Dean that the thing he was doing to save himself was breaking Castiel's heart.
What a beautiful moment of co-parenting. Who knew that it could be like this? He didn't. He feels like he appreciates Dean on a new level, knowing that he takes Cas’ wishes into consideration when he’s not around.
shit like that didn’t happen outside the movies. But even still, he left room for the unlikely event that maybe he would chance upon some guy or girl who made his biology light up like a pinball machine.
Dean reached out and placed a hand under his chin. He lifted so that Cas' eyes looked directly into his. “I don’t want to be your friend,” he told Cas, his voice low and full of intent.
He wishes Charlie were here now. He's getting that itch in his feet, the one that makes him want to run. His eyes sneak a glance to the windowsill just beside the bed. But he has jumped out of it before and the impact wasn't great on his ankles.
And that could be good. That is, isn't that what Dean's been wanting all this time? This whole thing with Cas has been so constantly present, just all the time making him feel weird or nervous or guilty, and it might be a really good thing if Cas would just drop it for a while. Give him some space.
“And on the weekend, even,” adds Balthazar with an approving nod. He moves in a bit closer to Castiel and rests one hand on his shoulder, giving it a good squeeze. “Well, you know we’re quite appreciative of things like that. A little extra effort, here and there.”
He looks down at Charlie to see her staring at him with a mix of sympathy and pity. She'd been there, at the beginning. She remembers exactly what Cas had been like.
His lips stopped moving but his eyes stayed focused on Dean’s. He couldn’t finish the thought, out of fear of what would happen once it was out in the open like that.
Dean finishes the circular appraisal so that he’s facing Castiel. If he has any critiques, he’s certainly not letting them show. “Place is a big,” he surmises, “How’s the move coming along?”
It's one of those days, a Thursday, when Dean rides his bike home from a shift at the grocery store. He's pretty sweaty himself. Summer is kicking off in California and, wow, if Dean thought Kansas could get hot he has been knocked on his ass by the coast. But, at least there's a reliable breeze here, which feels incredible on his face as he locks his bike up on the porch and heads inside.
He’s not playing along like the others, but that doesn’t matter. To Castiel, it feels like the most crushing betrayal he’s ever felt in his life.
Cassie was smiling when Dean approached. A victorious smile, smug, which was very quickly wiped away as soon as Dean began talking. Actually, ‘talking’ didn’t seem quite accurate for what he was doing. His volume was low, while she could be heard shouting from across the parking lot (and perhaps from the highway, Cas mused to himself) but the anger that seethed from Dean’s body radiated outwards in waves.
The heartbreak that he'd felt when he first came back home? It was unimaginable. It was like someone had died. Why on earth would he subject himself to the possibility of going through that again?
The risk is just too big. What if they broke up again? He couldn’t even begin to understand the psychological ramifications that would have on Hannah. And it couldn’t be good for either of them either.
This was supposed to serve as something of an apology for her behavior at the Thanksgiving dinner a few weeks ago. They were now past Christmas, of course, but things had been so busy between work and Hannah and everything else, he hadn’t gotten to have much one-on-one time with his sister since she’d essentially told him off on Thanksgiving.
There’s something vaguely flirtatious about the way Dean’s said it. Maybe it’s because he’s on his third margarita, but Castiel’s doesn’t mind. Friends can flirt. There’s no rule saying they can’t.
“Hey, let’s go grab dinner from the cafeteria,” he suggests suddenly, when the rumbling of hunger pains sounds loud enough for him to hear.
Dean and Father both nod amicably at the suggestion, moving over toward the couch. Castiel finally snaps himself awake. He hurries over to Father’s chair, the most comfortable one in the house. “Oh, yes. A seat, that’s lovely. Dean, please, this chair here.”
Dean steamrolls ahead, like he’s opened the floodgates and he’s unable to hold anything back anymore. “I want to be your boyfriend, man,” he blurts. “I... I do, I wanna kiss you for real and hold you and sleep in your bed with you…”
Dean grumbles and turns away so that Castiel can't see the smile creeping up on his face. He doesn't put up any fight though when he feels Cas' hand slipping into his, and he doesn't push the Alpha away when he dives in to press a quick kiss on his cheek.
The chair scrapes loudly across the floor when Dean pulls it out to take a seat. He hesitates over how honest to be here. "Um. Like, a little."
Dean teeters back and forth on his feet, staring sullenly across the room at Castiel. His eyes travel over to the empty space in the bed. “Can I…?”
A victorious glint shines in Dean's eyes. “Good. And speaking of… y’know, the other thing,” Dean says, casting a downward glance to the line that’s formed at the crotch of Castiel’s jeans. Castiel gasps softly when Dean starts to slide down the bed, moving all the way down until he’s nearly face to face with Castiel’s groin.
It's just a good idea to brace himself. To keep a thick membrane. If anything happens, and he has make a run for it, he'll be ready. Or, more ready, at least.
Jo sits up like a watchdog. Her eyes race to every table in the room. "Oh my god," she mouths. "Oh my god."
Dean’s smile flickered at the edges for a second before he caught it. “Oh,” he muttered dismissively, “I don’t really know about that.”
They climb down the stairs onto the front walkway and Cas wraps an arm around Alfie’s shoulder. “Are you okay?” he murmurs softly.
Mostly, that meant mowing the lawn and semi-regular blowjobs. Dean had no complaints about that particular arrangement.
He leans in and kisses him on the lips, soft and slow. He trails kisses over his cheeks to his earlobe, all the while Dean watching silently.
Castiel stays silent. He leans in minutely closer, itching to hear how Dean will finish the thought. Dean shakes his head, fiddling with his hands, and continues, “But I like being around you. I feel… comfortable. Like I don’t have to try or anything, you know? I don’t always feel like that.”
Dean scoots himself closer, still watching Castiel with eyes that betray not a single hint of dishonesty. “You don’t have to tell me anything, not if you don’t want to.”
He wishes he could just get over it. A whole year has passed. Why can't he just let go of that anger?
"I hope you don't either. I’m pretty sure you’d be fine in your own. You seem... scrappy." A hand is offered cordially to him. "Name's Benny, by the way."
Dean chances a look up to the corner where he's siting. Cas is staring right back at him, his lips twitching with a laugh. His expression is almost as satisfied as Jo's was just now. Dean looks back down at his phone and sees another message waiting.
The hardness of Cas' erection has faded but it still makes itself known against Dean's thigh. Dean swallows, trying not to focus on it too much. He dots a quick kiss on Castiel's lips and then wriggles himself free. "Yes. I'm sure. Now can I please go eat breakfast? You've distracted me enough."
His warning sends Dean back so many months earlier, to when Coach Singer delivered him the new of his being unceremoniously kicked off the team. Dean ruffles when he thinks of it. His perspective may have changed in many ways, but the memory is still tinged with an air of bitterness. He clears his throat and shakes off the negativity.
So maybe, just a little bit, he was hoping that today could show Cas that there were some options close to home that could give those big fancy colleges a run for their money.
Dean slaps the hand away. Cas is instantly crestfallen, his face caught in a mask of hurt like a door's been clammed in his face. From beside them, Daphne pipes up, "Who is
, that does sound rather appealing. And it is a possibility. He’s got no babysitter to get back to, no one waiting on him…
Gabriel keeps blabbering on, tossing in a dramatic sigh or a loud laugh every now and then, but Dean has almost totally tuned him out. If Gabe is talking so freely about him, he knows Cas must not be there. He's probably not home at all.
Dean mutters a stream of profanaties into his ear, and then Cas feels a warm spot forming on his upper thigh. The thought of Dean coming, of him being the reason Dean would come, of Dean wanting to make him come-- all these things rush together in Cas’ mind until he follows suit just a few seconds later.
He waited patiently for Castiel to respond, his own eyes wide and humble and asking for Cas to understand. So how could he possibly have responded any differently?
“Don’t worry," Castiel tells him with a light-hearted chuckle before Dean can slide further into distress about the subject, "I wouldn’t do that to you. Here, you pick.” He hands the remote to Dean, a gesture which is met with a glance that could at best be called skeptical.
When Cas finds him in the living room that evening, he asks how Dean's day was with that kind of genuine interest he always seems able to muscle up when it comes to Dean. "Did you make any friends?" he inquires, trying to hide the concern laying dormant beneath the words.
"Selfishly, yes?" she laughs. Her lack of gravitas is exactly what he needs right now. He needs someone to remind him that this is not the world caving in on itself. "Kidding, kind of. I have no idea, man. I don't know how bad it felt to be you. You should definitely ask your dude. He seems wise and helpful."
Dean nipped his teeth along Castiel’s neck and licked at the wounds as they started to turn purple before his eyes. That sight really got him going, looking at Cas’ neck and thinking how everyone would look at him and know; know that he had an alpha, that he belonged to someone, someone who knew how to take care of him, in every way.
Cas squirms under his gaze. He doesn’t normally let himself get to a point where he feels so vulnerable around someone. It’s disarming, and leaves him completely at Dean’s mercy. And even though Dean really seems to be stepping up to the plate, Castiel feels uneasy with his newfound weakness.
Dean nods silently and tries not to linger too long before going into the bedroom and closing the door behind him. Just before the metallic bolt clicks into place, he hears a faint, "Goodnight, Dean" coming through the wall. He stands still, his hand resting on the door handle while his feet stay frozen in place. Then he turns away with a shake of the head and nothing more.
Not that you'd be able to tell from the way he's pressing himself against his alpha now. Cas is laid out on the bed and Dean is flat on top of him, not letting up for a second. There is none of the playfulness they normally have now. If you didn't know any better you might think Dean was the alpha here.
But thought spur him from the outside, chip away at that sensation of desire and turn it into worry. Why hadn’t Dean kissed him when he came in? Why didn’t he hug Cas or tell him he missed him?
"Even if it wasn't all your fault," he's quick to add on, so that Dean knows there's no residual bitterness.
The omega sits up straight. "It's okay," he says quietly, obscuring the depth of his feelings in the moment, "It's.... not that scary to think about right now. Someday you'll be a kickass alpha for a very lucky pup." He pauses, swallows. "You already are a great alpha for me."
He's just caught one candy in his own mouth, and is delightedly celebrating (despite the fact that he'd forgotten he despises the taste of candy corn on his tongue), when a pair of strong arms wrap around his forearm, and frighten him enough to make him jump.
It’s only after Cas ends the call that he recalls what he’d left paused on the TV in the living room, and he bolts from the kitchen muttering a soft “shit” as he does. He finds Dean standing next to the large screen, taking it in with a curious expression. He sips from his drink but doesn’t look up when Cas enters the room.
“Dean,” he says, his voice low and wary, “Why are you so determined to stay locked here in the room?”
Dean looked over at Cas, really raking in the picture of front of his eyes. He’d always seemed so mature, so much older than he really was to Dean. He was getting his Master’s and being a teacher’s assistant and he worked a regular job in addition to being a volunteer; he was no stranger to responsibility. But really, he was just a kid. 23-years-old, fresh out of college. He had no reason to shackle himself down to a thing like this.
They’re going to turn out negative, he reassures himself. It was one slip up, one time. There’s no way that could stick. Right? It had taken them weeks, months the first time around, and that was when they were actively trying. This information relieves Cas as he heads into the bathroom with four petite boxes in hand.
. He sits up quickly, hands pushing against the hard wooden floor, the blankets tangling around his legs as he moves like a dying fish. His voice comes out strangled. “I… fuck. I n… couldn’t sleep.”
"Hey," he greeted, a little awkwardly, when he'd shuffled close enough to be heard. Castiel raised his head. He looked pained. The weariness in his eyes made Dean internally wince, and he instantly wanted to rush forward and wrap his arms about Castiel, to brush his fingers through the tousled black hair and let him know what whatever it was, this problem, that Dean would help him as much as he could.
Castiel straightens his back in surprise. That is… the opposite of what he expected Dean to say. “Yeah, sure. I can do that.”
When Balthazar invites him out to some kind of “fusion” restaurant on a Friday night several weeks later, Castiel is refreshingly enticed by the idea. He’s got to get back in the swing of things- hell, even try some new things.
And then Dean had got busy. He was bad at responding, barely ever looked at his phone now unless it was googling what temperature to heat milk to for a nine-month-old. In time, messages from Castiel grew curt, and when Dean abandoned their phone conversation that night he had sounded so mad that Dean was actually afraid.
Especially when it included Cas looking up at him from the dance floor, every single time, without fail. Cheering for Dean with a smile on his face, shouting like a horned-up teenager.
While Dean pondered that for a moment, Castiel turned to the funny, red-headed girl and waved a hand between her and Dean. "Dean, this is Charlie, from my psychology class. Charlie, Dean, my boyfriend."
It occurs to Castiel a few seconds later that he actually doesn’t know which “old times” Dean is referring to. Does he mean deployment, when Cas was calling as his husband? Or after, when he’d set up the camera for Hannah and then walk away, try to make it without actually having to see Dean’s face, if he could avoid it?
“Can you blow a kiss?” Dean asks her. Hannah puts her palm to her lips and smacks dramatically, making Castiel’s heart light up like nothing else can. He sees Dean’s finger reaching for the screen and then as quick as anything, the call is ended.
Castiel stops writing to furrow his brows. After a minute, his face smooths. "Yes, I think I could use a little break. Where were you thinking of going?"
So school is good and friends are great. And home- his new home- it's... his. And it really feels like his.
Already Castiel could feel the need to go outside, to get away from this. She was right, of course, and he was mortified to think that he might have been embarassing himself with Dean’s friends by acting like he belonged.
And why not? That is, Ruby was never biologically his. He didn’t have any obligation. And, at the beginning, she hadn’t even been his kid. She’d been his boyfriend’s. So he’d been stuck on diaper duty and bottle service, with none of the benefits of getting to call her his own.
All told, he finishes cleaning in the afternoon, takes a quick, thorough shower, and he spends the rest of the time sitting on the couch with his laptop, catching up on shows he hadn’t been able to watch when he was feeling down.
With Dean's hand still on his chin, Cas levels his eyes to look into Dean's piercing green irises. He loves those eyes, he has from the very first time they'd met his own over the table at the market some weeks before.
Hannah is all packed and ready to go, which is both unlike her and unlike Dean, so color Castiel impressed. Dean places a few warm cookies onto a plate and covers it in aluminum foil, and when he reaches out to hand the plate to Castiel, their fingers brush against each other's with just the softest contact.
Hope started to glimmer in Castiel’s eye when Hannah was around two years old. That was when the end of Dean’s military contract was well within sight.
He wasn't sure what he expected from Dean. In any case, Dean pulled over the car and coaxed Castiel into his arms, gently petting his hair and showering him with kisses. He shushed Castiel's cries and held him tight. He stayed strong while Castiel was falling apart, and for that Castiel felt another upheaval of guilt inside him. He tried to apologize, for which Dean argued with him, but Castiel pushed the point. He said that there was no reason for him to burden Dean with all this, especially when there was nothing that they could do to resolve it.
“Sorry, Char, I’m going to have to steal my partner in crime for a while.” Dean throws a wink to Castiel like what he’s just said was exceedingly clever.
Alfie takes a sip of his hard cider and manages a half-smile. “Yeah, yeah, everything’s great... How are you? How’s Dean?”
“Oh, please.” She pulls out a drawer, dumping a few utensils into it. “Did you see the way he was looking at that wedding picture? Or, for that matter, how he was looking at you?”
He tries to tell himself that maybe that’s fine. Maybe it’s not something every couple does, with the googly eyes and the constant touching each other. Maybe Castiel doesn’t even want that right now, that sort of all-consuming love that makes you feel bubbly inside and nice and warm...
Dean doesn’t even bother to tell him ‘okay’ or ‘whatever’ or ‘that’s none of my business because you’re just my roommate and I don’t give a rat’s ass where you spend your mornings’. He just takes the bottle from his hand and then walks away. Grabs a bowl and the first box of cereal he sees (which of course is some sugar-overdose crap thanks to Gabriel) and then goes to sit down at the kitchen Island.
A whine turned into a cry, which became more and more distressed. The two fathers passed him back and forth, trying to soothe him or bring him any degree of comfort. Dean plopped Ruby in front of a movie to keep her occupied, and then hopped up the stairs two at a time to get back to where Cas and Roman were pacing back and forth in the bedroom.
His whole body shudders with a combination of shock and sheer carnal pleasure. His hips jerk involuntarily and there's the fleeting thought of
Castiel blushes dark rouge at the vulgarity of her language. He’s never heard lovemaking described like that before. Meg chides her tongue against her teeth and takes a step closer to him.
He walks over to the drawer where she’d put the things and opens it, moving them from it into their proper place. “If there were any strange looks- which I don’t believe there were- it’s probably just residual awkwardness. I mean, we’ve barely seen each other at all since… everything. He probably just doesn’t know how to act.”
There is a distinct shift inside of his body, being back home. He'd felt it the moment they disembarked from the plane. And he hears it in his voice, the way it had dropped an octave just now like he'd went through a second puberty on the plane.
They set about trying every time Dean was home. They tried and tried and tried, and you can definitely bet that that’s the period Cas looks back on most fondly when he thinks of their marriage. Even now, conflicted as he is, he can’t suppress a light chuckle at the thought of all those long nights and weekends spent in bed, excitedly talking about baby names and the idea of being a family.
“What even…” Castiel stares at him, dumbstruck. The sun is breaking through the curtains and falling onto the covers. The fat cushion between them keeps the necessary space between them.
, he tells himself. He’s working himself up just like he had been all week, only now Dean is here and the idea of him seeing Castiel in one of his low states is absolutely unacceptable, so he just needs to take a deep breath and calm down.
"Yes," Cas replies quickly. "But I think... it's best that we go into this with a united front. That is to say, there's already enough tension without you and I being at odds."
But it's not going to be so easy. Balthazar steps into his path to block his exit. This is just another part of the game for him, apparently. "Cassie, don't go." He remains cool and confident. "We both know where this is going to end up."
A million words rush to the forefront of his mind, too many to filter through and try to decide which will help him save his job in this moment.
You see, the doctor, while telling him that there would be no long effects of Cas' self-inflicted sex injury, had warned Dean that something like this might happen. Not amnesia, per se, but more of a super-intense grogginess that might make Cas a little extra forgetful. There was very little likelihood that it should last more than a few hours; a day or two, at the most.
Okay. That was enough. Cas trusted him, and Dean trusted himself not to ever, ever do anything to make himself undeserving of that.
He hates that it makes him so anxious to think of them sitting there in the living room with Cas. That he's so worried for Castiel, and for himself. It would be easier if he didn’t have to feel anything. It would be easier if he just could’ve been a fucking beta.
“Of course, I understand,” Balth nods coolly. He takes a step toward Castiel and whispers in a conspiratorial tone, “I suppose that just means we’ll have to do this again.”
"It's not that you make me feel that way, not at all. But you're so young. And you depend on me for housing. I would never want you to feel unduly influenced."
And with a final squeeze on his she left him on his own, there in the hallway next to the bathrooms, staring off into nothing. She hadn’t told him anything new, anything he didn’t already know. But still, to hear someone say the words out loud, it was like driving a stake into his empty chest.
self? The idea of that is almost enough in itself to spur Castiel into action, to make him sit up and start protesting the idea of Dean having any fault in the situation.
"My concern is with your age. I know that we're true mates. I know it's biological and it makes sense and I can't be blamed. But I can't help but feeling like something of a predator."
Far behind her, Dean watches Cas get settled into a large comfy chair. He's still facing Dean. Which gives the omega opportunity to try and read his features a little more closely, just to make sure he's okay. No way he'd tell Dean if he wasn't.
There’s a knock at the door, a few hours later. Dean is still out and Castiel is deep into a  Netflix binge session, so he has very little desire to get up and answer it.
Though, Dean realizes, it is California, so summer never really ends out here. The tables are probably year-round fixtures. He finds that strangely curious, the thought of sitting outside in mid-December enjoying a half-soy iced whatever.
In any case, he wandered from stall to stall, perusing the many fine wares of local farmers and artisans. To Mr. Turner for his butter, and to Miss Moseley for the salves his father would be needing in the upcoming days after the harvest.
“Your heart beating alright? Need me to call an ambulance? I’ve got your address written down just here…”
Dean freezes with his drink next to his mouth. When a few seconds go by without answer, Cas jerks his head up to look at Dean. A tiny, barely detectable smile frames his mouth. He answers in a soft voice, “Yeah. Still the same.”
Dean’s favorite are the ones he gets first thing in morning, when Cas’ scent is strong and heady and feels like it could embed itself right into Dean’s bones if he tried hard enough. It’s become a daily ritual: waking up with Castiel’s alarm, his eyes cracking open despite their forceful protest, stretching his arms and legs wide as if to greet the day, and then finding Castiel. First with his eyes and then with his lips.
There he went, just being honest and upfront again. Dean didn't know how to do that. He wanted to, but it was so hard. He'd spent his whole life hiding feelings and pretending he didn't care.
"Dean. I have to tell you something," Sam blurts out instead of responding, like he only has thirty seconds to speak before the phone explodes. "It's about dad."
“Yeah, sorry,” Cas shakes his head, “I was just… it doesn’t matter. Let’s go find Charlie… and alcohol.”
The silver picture frame feels heavier than Cas had remembered, a strange sensation between his fingers. He’s only barely let his eyes roll over the picture, the smallest sigh he can possibly utter, when Anna shrieks loud enough to jar him and the frame is ripped from his grasp.
"Yeah. I guess so," Dean replies, and then shifts to ask, "Hey, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?"
“No one’s being too mean to you, then? I know grumpy old Zach can be a real fly in your tea…” Balthazar pulls a face and it results in Castiel feeling more at ease. There’s not need for him to be overly professional tonight, to play into the complexities of office politics. Balthazar is down to earth, he can tell. Fancy as all get-out, maybe... but approachable.
, like I never heard that...” she scoffs, again to herself, and then back to Dean she asks, “So you’ve never made the acquaintance of one Ms. Layla Rourke?”
They walk to the coffee shop, because it takes longer, and it's more time they can enjoy fresh air and each other. Since it's still summer, there are still tables set up outside to allow customers to enjoy their drinks in the sunlight.
He opens his mouth to say something, probably to apologize but Alfie beats him to the punch. “Hey, I’m sorry about last night. I know that you were…”
For him, the silence was calm, relaxed. But he could tell that beside him, Castiel's mind was working, trying to decipher which were the right words to speak out loud.
Cas is mortified, begging silently for his mother to stop quashing his chance at happiness. But Dean spins around once more to look him in the eye, and his own face is open and soft.
Beside him, Dean’s even breaths turned into tiny little snores. Castiel releases a loud punch of air into the room.
Hearing someone who actually points out when an alpha is overstepping his boundaries is pretty rare, especially someone who isn't on the receiving end of that boundary-pushing. So Dean bites his tongue and merely says, "Well, thanks." He chooses not to point out that he is more than able to defend himself and opts to be the gracious omega he's supposed to be instead. "Hope I don't need you stepping in on my behalf any time soon."
The fear (is it fear?) in Dean's body melts away quickly. Though the words elicit a visceral reaction in him for sure, he doesn't actually seem to want Castiel to stop talking. Some part of him takes comfort in hearing this. A deep, bone-level kind of ease.
Dean reaches for the offered drink and cracks it open in one hand. “But, that’s new, right? When you were my age you ate like crap?”
Jesus Christ, this is some next-level bullshit. Dean is definitely going to have to sort whatever this out, and sooner rather than later.
People often feel entitled to an opinion on the matter, once they find out. So Castiel would rather just avoid the whole thing, if he can.
So much is happening here. Sam sounds so grown up. Hell, he's always been smarter than Dean but now he sounds like he's overshooting him on all fronts. Dean has no reason not to trust him. But he also knows his dad. There's a lot to consider and he doesn't want to say yes to anything he thinks will put him at risk.
But Cas, being Cas, shakes him off easily. A hand comes up to graze his chin and he lifts his eyes. Castiel's face is warm and kind, full of hope for the day. More hope that Dean feels even close to at this point. "I'm teasing you," he whispers conspiratorially, grazing a thumb over Dean's chin. "Have a good day, huh?"
He walks off towards Charlie’s, watching his feet to make sure they don’t lead him astray; but he tosses one last look up toward Alfie’s room. Dean calls his name out, once, more like a soft reprimand than anything else. It's not enough.
He doesn’t remember putting this away after the move. Had he? Maybe Anna had done it for him. In any case, he feels like he hasn’t lain eyes on any of these in years….
look. Castiel has to laugh. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he surmises with a lopsided grin. Gabe can be a lot to handle, and for some reason he’d always taken a shine to the younger Winchester brother. Cas hadn’t the slightest clue why, but he can’t blame Sam for wanting to keep their interaction to a minimum.
Cas could be real soft when he wanted to be; which he did, a lot. He liked to whisper soft praises into Dean's hair while he fell asleep; liked to hold his hands and kiss his knuckles when they were bruised from a long day on the job; liked to smile and compliment him to their friends like he hung the damn moon and built a ladder to the stars. Dean pretended to hate the attention- but, well if he was a shit guitar player, he was a much worse actor.
Of course, the idea of Cas being with anyone else also set off his alpha territorial instincts and he started to emit a deep, rumbling growl. Castiel looked up and him and shivered, which made Dean realize what he was doing and stop immediately.
Castiel nods. “But I am not a girl, and I don’t want you to treat me like one. I am a boy. There’s a difference, and that distinction is really important. I’m just as strong as you. You can’t just replace all those old ways of being with someone. I don’t need you to take care of me. If anything, we'll take care of each other.”
His hands search for Castiel’s. When they find them, Dean began to stroke his fingers over Castiel’s knuckles. It feels so,
“Well, you’re not getting me to go with you,” Charlie outright insisted. “Me neither,” from Jo. Before Cas could even ask, Ash took a long drag from his cigarette and exhaled a cool, “Truly sorry, my amigo, but even I know better than to wrangle with the like of an ornery spectre.”
It would be great if he were able to talk to anyone about this… but of course he can’t. Dean is so very, very in the closet-- if he even
He feels spent already and he just woke up. His whole body is recoiling from their morning activity. And he doesn't dislike it. It's just... weird that he likes it.
“I don’t know if I feel like going back to my room,” he confesses aloud. Charlie and Alfie halt beside him, both of them turning in on him with support written all over their faces.
When Dr. Robert proceeded to give Castiel a work-up, Dean watched from the corner of the room. He asked if Cas wanted some privacy, but he told him, no, of course it was alright for his boyfriend to be in the room (for someone who couldn’t remember the entirety of their relationship, he wasn’t having a hard time hopping right on board, Dean could give him that).
,” returns Balthazar with an air of sophistication, pulling back his hand and offering a regal kind of wave.
Strong enough that it gets to turn around, a spatula in one hand, mouth still half-cocked into an early morning smile. When he takes in Castiel’s expression, his own face goes grim in a flash, and it’s only seconds later that he steps forward and says in a pleading voice, “Cas, no.”
A guilt nags at Castiel like a phantom limb. When he'd first moved back to Pontiac, Sam had been one of the first people he contacted. Yes, Sam had once been someone Cas considered a close friends, but more importantly, he was Hannah’s uncle and he had every right to spend time with his niece. Castiel was more than happy to drop her off for a Sunday or let Sam know when her dance recitals would be. But then, as time passed, Cas had gotten so busy and it was difficult to find the time or remember to make plans...
The closer his feet bring him to his destination, though, a hesitation takes over him. When he's standing outside the cafe, he realizes why. He remembers doing this exact same thing, not so long ago, with Lisa. He tried to use her to get his confidence back, and she shot him down to his face in the most embarrassing way. And even though he knows Cassie is different- she's better than that, and she doesn't care what Dean is- he still feels almost paralyzed by the fear of rejection.
Dean swallows thickly. It’s like he’s… trying to power through this, like he doesn’t want to say it but feels obligated. His eyes return to the screen but they don’t seem to be looking at Castiel.
Dean sinks back into his seat and watches at Jo does the same. For all the worrying he'd done, and all the hiding, he's surprised that that actually wasn't the worst thing in the world.
A long sigh of relief from Dean, but it’s plagued with guilt. “No, I’m sorry. I... really wanted to see you tonight.”
“Well, that’s great,” Dean says. There’s something funny in the way he says it, and Castiel shoots him a look, curious, but before he can give it too much thought their conversation is abruptly interrupted.
Dean halted abruptly. His grip loosened on Castiel's hand, briefly, before he turned around and addressed him very seriously. “Okay, you know what? For you, I can do that. I’ll let that slide, but I just-- that’s gotta be the last bad news for tonight, alright? I can’t take anymore.”
“Yes, sir,” Dean barely clipped out, and then Bobby took off toward the commotion in the other room. Before he could even think about it, Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and tugs him through the decrepit kitchen and out the back door, through the yard filled with uncut grass and old tractor parts, until they were far enough way that it seemed safe.
“Fuck it,” Dean cursed, and tugged down the guy’s shorts to get back to what his body was shouting at him to do.
"That's good," Mary beams. She rubs her palms together in her lap and starts to look a bit more comfortable. "That's really, really good."
Dean is still is pain, and if he wants very little less in the world than to see another doctor, but he thinks to himself that if it'll make Cas feel better, than it'll be worth it in the end.
Oh, Cas knows that it is. It’s all that anyone on campus has been buzzing about for days, and Dean is sure to be there with his jock friends in tow. “Please don’t say lit again.”
He leaned in again, pressing his chest against Dean’s and reaching up to wrap his fingers around a fistful of hair. Dean allowed Cas to take the reins, let himself relax and be present and revel in the moment of his first kiss with another boy.
LOL I'm sorry this is like the slowest burn in the world, I didn't even realize it was gonna be this bad. Haha. Thanks for sticking it out with me! Really looking forward to hearing all your hopes and dreams for these two dopes.
It comes out so much weaker that Castiel wants it to. Weak enough that Dean can ignore it, or take it as some sort of playful admonishment instead of what it is.
He doesn't, and he's not sure if it's the best idea to ask for further explanation. She's gone before he can decide one way or the other, and as she goes, Balth appears once more beside his desk. “Oh, Castiel, one more thing?”
The million words are gone more quickly than they appeared. Cas' head is empty now, working only in quick pictures and flashes of memories, and a building sense of fear that has his throat closing up to both air and sound.
It’s getting a little harder to be so stringent about those boundaries. He doesn't say anything in return, but lets the feeling linger in the air, a warmth between them that just seems to spread throughout the room, leaving a smile on Cas’ face that he has a hard time wiping off.
“Good." Cas sounded significantly relieved, and began walking again. "Because it would be an absurd waste of energy.”
Everything had been fine when they arrived at the dance. Castiel had practically had to shove his mother off of him, with her endless cooing and preening. They drove together in Dean’s car, which he fondly called his baby and of which he was immensely proud.
“I’ve got a little house just next to my shop, right on the edge of town. And... I’ve got a big heart. I want to be a good husband to you, and if you’ll have me, Castiel, I’d like to share everything I have with you from now until my very last day.”
It’s Alfie. And the minute Castiel hears his voice it all comes crashing back into his memory: the puppy-dog following, the wide-eyed stares, the carrying him home, and-- most importantly-- the aborted kiss at the end of the evening.
Cas breaks away with a small sigh and looks into Dean's eyes. His thumb strokes delicately over Dean's cheek. "I missed doing that."
It's after one when he gets in, and he fully expects Cas to be knocked out cold- though he isn't surprised when he quietly slips into bed and feels the sheets rustling as Cas turns over to regard him.
“Most people don’t think so,” Dean told him. “That’s why Cassie broke up with me. She said I never talked to her anymore.”
When he feels a finger slide inside of him, the world around him narrows down to a pinhead. His fingers grip tight around the fabric of Dean’s shirt, tighter than they should be but Dean only bites off more encouraging dirty words and god damn how does he still have so many muscles under there? Cas feels a momentary itch to run his tongue over those muscles, the taut feel of his flexed bicep--
Dean hummed in genuine interest as he picked up the readings she offered. He'd actually considered joining a frat. Their stuff about brotherhood and bonding sounded right up his alley. He wouldn’t be opposed to being sold on that.
He can sense the way Castiel is looking down at him. He’s perched on the bed all concerned, like he always is, but his eyebrows at bunched together in the middle of his face like he’s confused.
about what Cas has to say. When he reaches his phone to follow up on those leads, he feels a swell of satisfaction inside him. And he pointedly tries to ignore the grave way that Pamela glances at him every so often.
“If you want, we can just… downgrade, for now. We can go back to just being friends, to keep things simple while you adjust to having Ruby.” He cast his eyes downward, and Dean could see that the words were making him sad. “You know, and maybe later…”
Castiel laughs out a breath of air, like the question comes as a relief. “Good one. It’s Gladiator.”
He cannot tell Dean. Not yet, anyway. He knows that he should, he should probably be the first one that Cas tells. But… he's not ready. His mind is all over the place, he wouldn't even know what to say.
Cas pauses when he reaches the hem of Dean’s boxers, brushing his lips gently over the skin there. He can see the way Dean shivers when he does, and the result is a self-satisfied smirk sitting on his face.
”I’m freaking wiped," is Dean's frank answer. His eyes flutter open and his head turns toward his mate in the driver's seat. "Let's go home."
When they noticed that she was pregnant, they didn’t say anything. They’d just decided to start attempting to expand their family, and they didn’t want to talk about it and risk jinxing themselves. Everything felt too fragile, even bringing it up was too much.
“I’m just gonna check on something, and I’ll be right back,” he said, even though Ben and Lisa were already ignoring him as she cracked open the front page of a  storybook.
Never, ever, ever- for the rest of their marriage- would Dean make that same mistake again. (At least, he hoped not.)
“Hey, not my fault you grew up being denied an education in the classics.” She throws her hands up gently as if to say
Right in the middle of the pregnancy. It was Castiel's worse nightmare come to life. Dean being halfway across the world while Cas was sat at home with nothing to do but think and worry. Nights he stayed up late at his computer, his eyes gone dry from staring at the screen, torturing himself reading up on horror stories of the things that went on during war. Weeks went by between phone calls, letters almost never came. Cas was growing bigger and bigger, and so was the feeling of dread that he carried around with him, thinking only ever of Dean.
Jo wanted to go check out the campus since she was thinking of applying there, and Dean saw it as a good a reason as any to get out of going to school. Benny and Garth filled up the other two seats in the back, and Cas came along because Dean asked him to.
Alfie laughs and nods politely, though Cas is fairly certain that he does not know what throwing a party is like.
,” Dean called out again, and Castiel could tell he was moving closer, but he didn’t know what to do. Maybe if could he just run in the other direction-
But that was exactly it. Cas always knew exactly how to fix all of his problems. Dean would spend hours, day complaining about some bullshit- big or small, it didn't matter. Then Cas would come in with his big brain and his grown up attitude, and everything was just.... better.
"Oh," she answers in her same voice. Her brows knit together slightly and her nose wrinkles as she sniffs the air. "Oh," she says again, more sharply, as her eyes go wide and nostrils flare. She gives Dean a quick once over that leaves him feeling more uncomfortable than he's felt in a long while in this house.
They find Gilda there, resting in a corner and nursing some neon-color concoction that Castiel is certain Charlie has made for her. He doubts very much from the look on Gilda's face that she enjoys the taste of her drink-- but he doesn't doubt that she loves Charlie. How she manages to keep making these girls go so goo-goo over her is a mystery that captivates him, truly.
A sudden thirst takes him over and has him walking over to the fridge to remedy it. He opens the door, thinking to grab a soda or something (since he’s finally staying in a place where a health nut isn’t the primary grocery shopper). But a colored label catches his eye, about thirty of them in fact, and a terrible mischievous idea takes hold of Dean’s brain.
At one point, when Charlie steps off to go make herself another lime green concoction, and Castiel is feeling particularly frisky, he tugs Alfie into him and dives in for a kiss that is equal parts sloppy and sweet.
Dean couldn’t help himself. He felt like he might be pushing it, but he was so overcome with how lucky he was. He leaned in as quick as he could and caught Castiel’s lips with his own, so goddamn happy that he was still allowed to do it.
He hadn't meant to ask that. He didn't even mean to talk at all. The question just... came out. Like when he was writing. He must have turned on some mental faucet and forgot to turn it off.
Dean's eyes are just are sparkling as ever. His cheek bones have not gotten any less sharp and his jawline remains something out of one of Castiel's many fantasies. He's tempted to close his eyes again just to save himself the pain of having to take it all in, but he convinces himself to play along for at least another few minutes. "It's just... I've been thinking."
And even though Dean thought, somewhere in his brain, that he might have liked to have the kind of boyfriend who'd get possessive, or clingy, or make a show of fighting for him, he knows that none of those qualities hold a candle to the boy standing in front of him. So he smiled softly and let the hand that held Castiel's swing gently between them, and he said, “No, Cas. I didn’t want you to be jealous.”
Hi hello, my deepest apologies for the month-long break. This one posed a lot of problems for me. But to make it up to you, here's a nice long chapter with everything you've been waiting for.
Outside of some low-rent function hall in Lawrence, Kansas, sobbing to himself over lost opportunities.
Reckless always had been a word Cas would use to describe Dean. He was the type do blaze ahead with whatever he wanted to do, and only after did he have to worry about the consequences. It was the kind of thinking that had lead to their divorce. And now it’s gone and gotten them into yet another mess.
Suddenly, Dean’s hand pushes down on his shoulders and Cas falls roughly onto his knees. The same hands moves quickly, grabbing at Cas’ chin and forcing it right up against the crotch of Dean’s jeans.
Dean bolts upright in bed, keenly aware of the increased rhythm of his heartbeat. Meditation is a failure.
"I didn't know that you felt that way," he says, after he's had time to reflect on himself, "I hope... I will try to make sure it doesn't happen again."
He hadn’t exactly meant to turn up the heat, but as soon as his tongue has dragged over Dean’s collarbone and he’d heard the way Dean started mewling in pleasure, Cas is rock hard and on a war path all the way down Dean’s naked torso.
And his little brother too. He knows that Sammy is confused right now. But that could change. He's just a kid, he's just copying what he's seeing his dad do. But Dean had always looked out for the little brat, and Sam looked up to him. What is he gonna do now without his big brother? Would he hate Dean for running away, like a coward? Is his mom scared for him, is she worried?
(also I'm hungover right now and I just really wanted to get this out, so I didn't do much proofreading. Feel free to let me know if it needs some corrections)
He's never been one for journaling. Definitely any writing outside of school assignments does not appeal to him. But he could change his mind.
He looks up at last and sees the helpless way that Dean’s looking at him. He’s trying, so hard he looks like he’s about to pop a vein or something. Cas is frustrated, by also so endeared by the look on the face of the boy sitting across from him.
Then, there are the feelings directed at himself. It’s not like he’s one-hundred percent innocent in this who debacle. He’s been reckless, totally reckless. He’d let himself forget everything he knew about Dean Winchester and stupidly gone and got invested in something he should have known was too good to be true.
Dean bounced up suddenly from his chair, not trusting himself. “I’m gonna go find a doctor so we can talk about getting out of here.”
So he does it. He rushes around the room and leans down before Castiel can even make a noise of surprise or anything. The kiss doesn’t even start off innocently, the second their lips meet Dean is deepening the embrace and pushing for more. He wants Cas’ mouth, his tongue, wants to feel his teeth and bite him back.
When Dean is out of view, Castiel’s eyes move to the crowd behind, watches how it slowly skims and parts. As the people thin out and move away, Castiel’s eyes fall to the opposite wall. There, standing awkwardly against against the wall, next to the fish bowl, is a small man the sight of whom makes Castiel feel as if he’s gone back in time.
Dean has tried to bring him along to parties. That was pretty much a no-go, but honestly, it's as much as Dean expected. Too many people, too much drunken nonsense for someone who would far rather spend the night with a cup of earl grey at his bedside than a Coors Lite in his hand.
Cas doesn’t remember his pants being unbuttoned, but suddenly they’re shoved down around his knees and he can only think to himself what a great idea that is. Dean’s lips move over his jaw, sucking and biting while Castiel scratches his fingers through Dean’s hair. He keeps moaning over and over, he thinks he’s saying Dean’s name but he’s not sure. The physical sensations are so perfect that his brain is turned to mush. It's like his brain is filled with air and he might think he was dreaming if not for how fucking good those teeth felt on his neck or the way his dick was hard and wanting in a way it hadn't been in years.
So he found himself again passing most of his hours alone, isolated from the rest of the world- only now he was wondering why he’d bothered to come all the way here just to end up feeling the exact same way. Before, it had been missing Dean with every fiber of his being that had been the defining emotion on his world. Now, it was missing everyone else in smaller ways that added up to a giant hole in his heart.
His first thought was to laugh. He thought that (obviously) there must have been a colossal mix-up, and that this was going to resolve itself into some very funny story he would tell people about later, after he had stopped laughing. He figured there must be at least a couple hundred of guys named Dean Winchester in the tristate area, and boy did he feel bad for the one of them that this phone call was meant for.
Dean can feel his eyes practically bursting out of his head. "What? Yes. Give it to me. Give me five, give me ten."
He watched as Castiel shook his head, sullenly. He reached over and placed a hand under Cas' chin, pulled it up so that he had to look Dean in the eye when he said, “Welcome to the two percent.”
“Oh, I--” Cas starts to explain himself, flustered. Dean feels his eyes goes wide and blink several times. He doesn’t react more than that. There are no words in his brain.
Castiel leans down for the doorbell handle and feels his shoulders slump. “Let’s just get out of here and I’ll explain everything.” He waits patiently for several seconds, and then, “Dean?”
He retreats back out into the hallway without incident. Dean waits until Castiel has closed the door before he holds the shirt up to his nose and sniffs it for all its worth.
Dean’s eyes followed the sound of sweet melodic words to the mouth they’d come from: pretty, pink-colored, lips on perfectly golden skin, all underneath a mess of dark brown hair that looked like the result of wild thoughts.
It happened very quickly that her face changed, and she started to do something that Dean thought people who knew more might calling
“I’m here, baby,” he shouted back, a promise and an apology at once. “I’m here, baby. I’m gonna take care of you.”
Castiel drops the smile, turning back toward the boy across from him. “Alfie, you don’t have to butter me up,” he tells him, “I’m already here.”
“Oh,” replied Cas, his voice soft and the disappointment plain. He never tried to hide the way he felt. Dean envied that, and appreciated it. “What’s up?”
Dean tried to yell out that he was sorry and it was all a misunderstanding and to just hold on a minute before he opened the door; but none of that came out. Instead, he watched as Cas opened the door and moved into his room, and it was about five seconds of silence before he reached the door himself.
All at once an idea comes to him, and he thanks God that he’s at least capable of one solid thought. He goes to his jacket and retrieves his cell phone, dialing in an unfamiliar number. For the first few rings, he putters around his living room, feeling like an utter fool, until finally there’s the brisk answer of a “Yeah?”
They drive on for a while more, and Dean tries to clear his mind, tries to distract himself as hard as he possibly can. But he can't stop thinking about those pictures. They're all scratched into his brain, permanently. Him and Sammy dressed up at firefighters for Halloween. Them and Mom on the first day of school. The way dad smiled when he was teaching Dean how to throw a ball.
Cas relents, releasing his hold on Dean’s face, but doesn’t step away. Dean stares down at him in a happy daze. He doesn’t seem to mind having been interrupted. “What was that for?” he asks, and Cas can hear the arousal in his voice.
Looking like the next one will be the last, folks. I'm excited to get this bad boy wrapped up. Looking forward to hearing your hopes, dreams, fears, predictions, etc.
They pulled into the parking lot at nearly nine at night, and Castiel was surprised to see that he was actually feeling a little… disappointed. He’d enjoyed talking to Dean on this long bus ride and, since the other boy would be graduating soon, it wasn’t something he foresaw happening again. He was just about to say as much when Dean turned around and locked eyes with him, suddenly focused and rather awake. “How are you getting home?”
Dean's silence must be making Cas a little nervous. After a minute, he ventures cautiously, "Do you want to talk about it?"
Dean grunts a loud. Castiel, with his back facing his roommate, makes a face of total confusion to himself. Where is this coming from?
and he gave it a skeptical look. It was almost ten am, but his brain was still fogged up with sleep and post-coital bliss. He prayed that the call wasn’t coming from the shop, trying to make him come down today.
Cas stares at him contently. He seem surprised to hear this, pleasantly so. Dean is feeling emboldened by his emotional rock bottom, so he scoots closer to Castiel and keeps talking.
When it swings open, Cas is surprised to see Dean standing there, looking rather lost in thought himself. He looks up suddenly and jumps, like he hadn’t thought that Castiel would actually be inside the room. “Oh, Cas. Hi. Hey, I wanted to…”
Downstairs, the front door opens, and the sound of keys clink into the bowl on the table in the hallway. Familiar, weighted footsteps trail toward the stairs, and Dean knows he is fucked already.
"Woof," she barks out. She leans back into the couch and looks him over again. "Was it at least good?"
A memory floods back into Castiel’s mind of the first Thanksgiving they’d spent together as a married couple. Just the two of them, in that dinky little off-base apartment. Cas had wanted to make it so special for Dean, wanted to make it feel like home. And Dean had been so sweet while he ate Cas’ lumpy mashed potatoes and dry turkey, when he picked off the burnt edges of Cas' sad attempt at a pumpkin pie.
Even through the worst of moods, he can't help a small smile through at that. He turns toward Cas and answers, "Yeah." He thinks his voice sounds the same as Castiel's. He hopes it does. He reaches over for Cas' hand and rubs it with his own.
Dean leans back and stares open-mouthed at Castiel. He had obviously not been expecting the outburst.
Missouri seemed very tired of his responses, like this was the same conversation for her day-in and day-out. “You were listed at the father on the birth certificate. If you like, we can run some paternity tests, but those results will take a few weeks to process.”
? Dean had always known that Cas could be particularly... enthusiastic, you might say. But to knock your head against the headboard so hard you conked out? That was truly remarkable.
A tight expression comes over Castiel’s face. He wants to sigh, again, but he holds it back for Hannah’s sake. He deliberates for a second before he turns to her and says, “Daddy and I
Again, Castiel hemmed. It certainly wasn’t his place to get involved in their business together; and, more importantly, if they were going to rekindle their romance tonight, Castiel didn’t want to ruin his chance at friendship with Dean by bad-mouthing her. “Ah…” he croaked anxiously, “it’s wasn’t…”
“Ooh, Daddy!” Hannah yells out suddenly before Dean can hand over the phone, “Look what I made today with Uncle Sam!” She’s up and on her feet before she’s even finished talking and then she leans up into Dean’s ear and whispers loudly, “Daddy, where did you put it?”
“Oh!” Cas squeals, offended. He untangles himself from Dean and shoves the other boy down on to the mattress, but before he can make his escape, Dean’s hands come for him and pull him down as well. They laugh until it turns into something else, until their legs are tangled and their breath puffs out in little bursts and Castiel can feel a firmness pressing into his thigh that makes him emit a deep moan.
He fumbles for a few seconds, trying to cover up the little bit of vulnerability he's shown. "Yeah, but I mean- oh god, just forget it." He stuffs another, bigger piece of muffin into his mouth and chews on it for several secodns to cover up the silence that hangs between them.
One night, when Dean had decided to spend the evening at home with Ben and Lisa, Ben ended up falling sick. He only picked at his pizza, which was the first sign something was wrong; and then, when they were sat on the couch in the living room watching
don’t know what you’re talking about, since you were barely in training bras when they got hitched. I was there, and let me tell you: I’ve never seen two kids so crazy for each other!”
Normally, whenever Dean tried to remedy a situation with food (like ice cream, for example) Cas would give him a lecture.
His smile breaks out a little wider, especially when Cas starts to bear his teeth in a tiny, just barely delectable hint of a smile.
She’s about to turn around and scan the room and Cas knows she’ll see what he saw and she’ll know. So he comes up with the first lie he can think of. “It’s-- sorry, it’s silly. I just, thought I saw Alistair, was all.”
But Cas is unperturbed by what was meant to be an insult. He looks at Dean with a trained neutrality as he shoves a bag at the omega. "Here. Some pain relievers and a heating pad. Should make things a bit more manageable for you. And also..." He reaches out to hand over two more things: a tall paper cup and a pastry bag, both emblazoned with the logo of the coffee place he'd been frequenting when they first arrived out here. He hasn't been there as much recently, mostly because he doesn't feel the screaming need to avoid the house nearly as much. But it still warms him up to see the name written on the side of his cup. "I know you prefer coffee, but a green tea will be much more soothing on your stomach, so..."
Dean absolutely could not wipe the smile off of his face. "You take him as much as you want," he assured her.
“Sometimes," she answers with a shrug. Her attention has already been stolen once more by the flickering lights of the television screen.
The older man hums in interest. Castiel’s eyes return to the leaves underfoot as he releases another sad sound. “I miss her terribly.”
But for now, he's still here. When he steps out of the bathroom, Cas is standing in the center of room. It looks like he's trying to work up the nerve to unload some shit. After a moment, he finds his voice. "Can I just explain to you my reasoning?"
A bird caws loudly from outside his window and it calls Dean's attention away from his wallowing and self-pity for a minute. The blue of the sky strikes him, a comforting familiarity in it. It makes him itch to be outside, to breathe in some fresh air.
That does the trick. She skulks her way back over to the table and slumps into her seat, running her pencil over the paper but writing nothing. Cas sighs a deep breath. Things have just been hard lately. It’s normal, this time of year: cold weather keeps them cooped up inside and she gets restless, and it wears Castiel out faster than normal which typically tends to drive him into his yearly bout with the common cold, though it seems to be kicking his ass a little more than usual this year.
Just a few hours later and they were given the all-clear to head home-- though strongly recommended that someone be there any time Castiel was sleeping for the next few days.
Cas stands, too, but slower and with a mischievous narrowing of his eyes. When Dean starts to shuffle off down the street, he follows close behind, sidling up beside the smaller omega. "Are you afraid that I'll find someone else to kiss here?"
That was all it took to make Dean a happy man. He thanked Castiel and kissed him before running out the door to a class he was surely late for anyway.
He doesn’t feel the need to mention the delicious food or the fancy wine, how the atmosphere made him feel more grown-up and sophisticated than he ever had in his life; Dean doesn’t need to know any of that.
He goes right for the fridge, without looking up, which is his first mistake. He opens it up and stares into the contents of the shelves, his eyes searching for something without letting his brain in on the secret.
The rapid movement of his heart starts to relent, and Castiel can breathe once more. Dean is back in town, that’s wonderful. If he’s home, then that means all… this is over. Cas can start to feel better now, to go back to normal.
Cas goes on, "Not even... God I just can't even fathom what makes a father act that way. What makes an alpha turn away his own child...."
“So this…” Sam pursed his lips and pointed to where the baby was set inside a laundry basket that Dean had padded with pillows, “this is your kid?”
Then he thought, maybe this was a set-up. Maybe some of the guys were pissed he’d ditched them for Cas last night, and they got stupidly drunk and decided to pull some weirdo prank on him. Honestly, if that was the case, he didn’t really ‘get it’, but points for creativity, he guessed.
She's still eyeing him in that funny way. Dean reaches into his backpack and grabs his phone so that he can pretend to be googling or scrolling or anything not to give her a good look at his pink cheeks right now. He alternates that with looking at his copy of
It’s Dean who ends up initiating. After too many long seconds of stagnant air, hope pulsing in the space between them, he takes several big strides and seats himself next to Castiel on the bed. Not too close-- he leaves a few inches of space between their legs. But they’re there now: sitting in the same space, together. One step closer to whatever comes next.
“Right now? I don’t really know.” It's true. He wouldn't even know how to start describe the mess inside his brain right now.
Dean goes pink. He doesn’t know why he feels that way, embarrassed, but he does. “It was fine,” he answers evasively. “She was nice.”
Except that all he can do is think, about Cas and how bad he feels because he freaking threw himself at the guy like some omega slut from a crappy movie. And that now he is adding to it by throwing a fit like a little kid and locking himself in his room. So now Castiel is probably downstairs thinking that maybe he jumped too far into this thing with Dean and that maybe it's not worth it. That he's not worth it, not if he's going to act like this. What if he tells Dean that he should leave? If he couldn't stay here, where would he go?
Except for Dean, apparently. Castiel didn’t know how that made him feel, but Dean was still looking over at him with an expression that very much conveyed hopefulness.
When the door closes behind him, and he’s marching down the hallway, the heaviness that closes in on his heart feels so weighty that it’s difficult to move. He really does hope all those things for Alfie, and he hopes that he finds that person soon. Alfie is such an amazing person, so capable of selfless love.
His head is also telling him that he’s been hurt by Dean one too many times to let anything pass now.
Dean held the package of diapers up in his hand and inspected it. He had never done… that before. He was going to have to figure that one out. And the formula, too. How did that work?
He might have smiled if he were anywhere else. He was in love with his True Mate, who loved him back. It was a happy occasion. Dean only wished that it felt like one.
He trails off and turns to go out the door once more. A crack of thunder rumbles in the distance, and Dean’s hand pauses on its way to the door handle. Before he even knows what he’s doing, Cas hears the words come out of his own mouth. “No, wait.”
A devilish smile Dean had already seen too many times crossed Castiel's face. He hoped that when they woke up together in Dean's bed tomorrow morning, all of Cas' memories would be back and he'd kiss Dean like he hadn't seen him in a week. But for tonight... well, tonight they could have a little fun.
The smile on Castiel's face is set against the back drop of the street Dean had spent his whole life calling home. The image is perfect to him. It says so much to him and he can't help but feel that this terrifying journey back home has been worth it after all.
Annoyance builds in him. He scratches a hand absently at his arm and approaches the stove, where Dean’s pancakes sit in a neat little stack on a plate beside the pan. Castiel stares at them for several seconds. He’s hungry, but the thought of eating what was meant to be a romantic breakfast for two makes him want to puke.
Cas looks so distraught. More than Dean has ever seem him maybe. His hair is standing on end, going every which way, and he can't stop running his hands through it. He makes the effort to make eye contact with Dean. “I just… I need you to know that I would never take advantage of you.”
"Okay. I see. Well, um," Castiel coughs and gestures toward the chair across from him. Dean slides onto the couch, much closer to him, and Cas' eyes go wide for a split second, but he doesn't question his luck.
As Alfie opens the door to his building, Castiel finally finds his voice. “Alfie,” he slurs into the other boy’s shoulder. “Why are feelings so… hard?”
Dean wondered if this might be perfect. Right now, in this moment, if this is what he would look back on when he was an old man rocking on the porch with Cas by his side and think of as the greatest moments of his life.
, is that a moose I see down there?” A mischievous sparkle twirls over Gabriel’s face. “Move over, Cas, I’m gonna sit next to Samantha.”
He was just waiting for the moment when Dean would shove him out of bed, or turn away from him in disgust. He thought that when Cas moved his kisses southward, Dean might cringe or twitch or otherwise somehow remember that he thinks he’s straight. But… it hasn’t happened. And with every passing moment, Castiel is lulled into believing that everything is roses and sunshine. That this muddled-up story has somehow managed to wind up with a happy ending.
"I know that I can't always talk about it, but I do like the idea of a future with you," he admits shyly. As he talks, his ears grow warm. He can feel them turning pink. "I'm so freaking... grateful for you, Cas. Especially after today, I... you know, I don't have many people I can count on. I guess, really, you're kind of it."
Cas must have worn the sweater today. Dean can’t remember exactly, he’s not sure if he saw him much during the day, but he can’t stop himself from reaching out and grabbing the article of clothing; clutching it against his chest and inhaling deep the strong scent coming off of it. He stays there for a second, feeling the way his heartbeat calms in his chest as he does.
Before he can even finish, Dean’s shrugging off the jacket and started to hang it up on the coat rack. “Well, you’ve sold me.”
It’s hard to see her face, since most of the time she’s leaning in towards Charlie to whisper in her ear or sneak another kiss. But from what Cas can see, she looks very normal. Very lovely, in fact, the way she’s smiling and laughing at everything Charlie does. And she’s really very pretty as well-- not that that
“I’m... here for Hannah?” he says finally, no less confused than he had been when he first appeared, “You know, our kid? About yea high, blonde hair, pretty feisty spirit, loves a Barbie?”
Is that true? Castiel doesn't even know his own motivations anymore. Probably. He wishes that she wouldn't now, or that she could just give him the answers.
Castiel's knit eyebrows flare out, framing his dumbfounded expression. "What do you mean?" he asks, a tinge of sensitivity to his tone. He looks down to his armpits and gives a half-hearted sniff.
wrong she is. Instead, her pulls the silver chain out of his pocket and hands it to her. “I just wanted to give this to you. It was in our room. I’m guessing it must be yours. I saw the initials engraved on it, and I…” Now Castiel is blushing painfully alongside her, “well, I knew you’d been over recently, so.”
Castiel tore his gaze away from Roman long enough to look up at where Dean and Ruby were perched beside him. “Babies skin color changes over the first few weeks,” he explained easily, focusing on Ruby, “He’ll probably be a bit darker than he is right now.”
a good boy for Dean), a final slap lands on his ass, harder this time, enough to make him wince before he straightens himself back out. No need to act like a baby. He can take it.
“You gotta go,” he admonished, trying for it not to sound like a moan even though he couldn’t stop the rapid motion of his hand stroking over the skin of his dick, “Get the fuck out, Castiel.”
He felt the words spilling out of him with a kind of inspiration he didn't know he was capable of.“Yeah. We’re both thinking of going here next year. Thinking of signing up to room together and then pushing our beds into one big bed, calling it the Megabed. Sounds fun, right?”
From there, it spiraled out of control. Dean would go down on him, and Cas would return the favor. Dean would lick his fingers and play with Cas’ hole- and
"Hello, handsome," he greets, coming in for a kiss on the cheek. Dean turns his head at the last second and catches him by his lips. The alpha hums in surprise, but acquiesces. They stay connected for a moment, and when he pulls away, Cas gives him a light chuckle. "You're in a good mood, huh?"
. So I understand why you’d want to give him all your attention, but… you can’t just go forgetting about Ruby. She’s still here.”
“Oh, yeah,” he breathes out, searching for Dean’s lips once more. “Oh, please. Yes. Oh, please, Dean. Oh.”
Dean looks like he might have forgotten how to breath. His knuckles are turning white from how hard he’s gripping the toothbrush in his hand.
Dean’s eyes search him. Cas waits patiently while his new betrothed tries to come up with the perfect answer. Eventually, he comes out with it. “I don’t know. It just feels right.”
Dean flops onto his bed showing no signs of anything other than his typical carefree attitude. “On my own door?”
Cas stares down at the words written in front of him. “Basically in love with you”-- he wonders if that’s Dean’s own words or Charlie’s paraphrasing.
Pamela returns his gaze, her eyes going wide at first and then thin as he face turns smug. “Well, look at you, you little minx," she teases, "I had no idea you were so busy in your spare time.”
Ruby was right behind them, trying to get a peek at the round little face that stared blankly up at them from the bucket. Dean thought he looked kind of like an alien, with his shriveled skin and those big globes for eyes. The cutest alien ever, but still.
It takes a good while, but finally Castiel starts to feel like things are going back to normal. He and Dean have managed to have a few civil encounters by now. The road to repair is beginning to lay down its bricks, Cas thinks. Maybe by summer Dean will be able to stand him long enough to come over for a meal again. Maybe.
Equally flattering, in the weirdest of all ways, is hearing that Sam had said things like that when he and Dean had called it quits. He's always cared for Sam, even before- and after- he and Dean had been together. And he valued his opinion. Sam is a great guy: kind and intelligent and with such a capacity for good. The idea of Sam's opinion of him plummeting was something that really prickled at him during their separation.
He drags a hand over his face and shakes his head. “Alright, fine, I just-- I’ve never. I just never knew that I might want this, you know. For, like, a million reasons.”
He decides to go ahead and mix up the first batch of margaritas. Is it a little early? Yes, but he’s got the house to himself. He can stand to indulge a little, for once. Call it a happy hour.
He crosses the quad in the direction of the dining hall, hurrying along to avoid being late. The minute he steps into the large, open-plan cafeteria, he spots Charlie waving a frantic hand from the opposite corner of the room.
He didn’t think his dad meant it that way, but the way he said it made Dean feel all kinds of emotional all over again, so he just went for it and dove it for a hug from his old man. He clasped him tight, real tight, until his dad’s hand repeatedly tapping his shoulder let him know that it was time to let go.
But Dean stops him with a laugh, the corners of his lips twirling upward. “No, I know that you mean. And I agree, it is embarrassing. I’m happy for you guys, really.”
He visited a table for student athletes first, and had a good long talk with them about his baseball stats. They seemed more than interested in taking on a new second baseman, which had Dean leaving the conversation feeling pretty good. He picked up pamphlets from the student newspaper and the campus health center, both of which he thought would interest Castiel.
He’s barely finished the question before Anna lets out an indignant scoff and downs the majority of her mimosa. Cas can tell this brunch is not going to be nearly as fun, or as mature, as he had hoped.
It’s the retching coming from the bathroom that makes him sit up, stalk straight. His eyes flick nervously to the bathroom door, and all of a sudden the whole night comes flashing back to the front of his mind.
But he's a little too surprised by the interruption of hand stroking his thigh meaningfully. Another gulp, but he doesn't stop reaching out to grasp at Castiel, pull him in for more.
Cas stares blankly across the kitchen. He's willing Dean to come to his senses. Though, he knows all too well from experience that it'll be a long wait if that's his end goal. “It’s not that easy.”
He stumbles upon his homeroom by pure luck, practically, and it's on his way out of there, toward his first class, when a skinny blonde girl worms her way over to him and starts in on him like a target.
There's about a million reasons why Castiel could choose not to believe him. Dean is super gorgeous, and smarter than he thinks, and he could have any one of the people in this bar without even batting an eyelash.
He does the same thing now, opening up the drawers and digging behind all the bottles of hair product and faux-scent. This is the bathroom Gabe uses as his personal one, so the wall of beauty products is pretty intense.
So he pees. And he waits. The test say they will take five minutes, so Castiel waits ten just to be certain. He goes into the kitchen and pretends to distract himself with cleaning odds and ends, though of course his mind is elsewhere. He just wants to see that tiny little symbol for himself, the one that will let him off the hook and let him get back to his mess of a life without any long-lasting repercussions.
From the side of his eye, Cas sees Dean set down the book in his hands. He heaves a large sigh. “I just don’t see why you guys always have to do that here.”
Cas calls out from him another time or two, but he quickly gets the point that Dean wants to be left alone.
A boy around his own age staring back at him in horror, with his trousers pooled around his ankles. Behind him, young Meg Masters with her skirt hiked up to her waist, her cheeks all flushed and her eyes half-closed like she’s drunk too much ale.
He says this with a smile and a lightness in his voice- there’s no hint of malice in the words. But it does ring true a bit, whether or not either of them wants to admit to it. Ever since Dean had come back, he’s been the new one, the exciting one. Cas is the one who sits with her to do her homework, and Dean’s the one who takes her out on the weekends for all kids of fun things.
His pants are unbuttoned, but other than that, he is still fully clothed. It must be a funny sight: Cas, wrapped in a cocoon, hair a mess, eyes red rimmed and wet. Dean looking as beautiful as ever, though a little tired, and like a teenage boy ready for his first hand job rather than a man whose just been rejected.
“Oh, yeah,” she responds darkly, “real cute. You don’t even know what you’re talking about, Gabe. You weren’t there at the end, you didn’t have to listen to the way Cas would cry on the phone every day--”
A hand catches him on the elbow, and Cas wrenches himself away as forcefully as he can. This was a mistake. All of it, this was all…
He sees Alfie looking off into the crowd of people, almost like he's searching for one specific person. Castiel feels hopeful at the idea, so he risks it and asks. “Hey, are you here with anyone tonight?”
“I doubt that it matters.” He can't look at Dean down. If he looked into his eyes, he's afraid of what he'll find there. Maybe lies. Or maybe something true, that will hurt him much deeper. “It’s not as if I supposed you were a virgin, it’s just that…”
Castiel parrots the phrase back. He's never heard it before. “Human Services? That sounds like something a robot does.”
They were finally all together, at home. He and Cas, Ruby, and the newest little addition to the family.
So now, it is Friday again, and he is sick of sleeping on other peoples’ couches or sharing tiny twin beds. He wants to have his own room back, and damn it, he is entitled. It takes quite a bit of pumping himself up before he manages it, but now he is striding confidently down the hallway and he tells himself he will not crack no matter what happens.
Cas rubs at his eyes once, certain that sleep has bled into reality, and that this is actually just a dream right now. To be certain, he coughs out, “Dean?”
But just as Castiel’s eyes got so large it looked like they might pop out of his skull, Sam cut in to admonish Dean. “Aw, come on Dean, stop being a dick. You’re torturing the poor guy.”
“Like what?” he yells, and he’s embarrassed by how much it comes out like a shriek. That’s probably exactly what Dean’s expecting. “Like-- like, like I give a shit? Like I deserve someone who gives a shit about me?”
Dean scolds Sam but his eyes are on Cas. They’re implicitly apologizing. “C’mon, Sammy. We don’t have to watch the game. I’m sure Cas and Gabe and Anna don’t wanna sit through all that.”
. I-- I don’t know if you’re gay or bi or pan or whatever, but… you are interested in men. You can’t just ignore that. You can’t pretend you’re not.”
But then he’d think about Castiel and he’d psych himself out and put the phone down and it all went back to the same place.
Maybe some day Dean will be ready for that conversation. But right now he isn't. Everything is too fresh.
That’s fine with Castiel. He understands that Dean’s hurting. He needs time and space to come to term with the fact that he and Cas are really, truly not going to happen again.  Castiel is more than willing to give that to him. Better that tun Hannah see something pass between them and start asking questions. No, that would be no good at all.
Afterward, he lies there, soaking in the pleasure. He likes the feeling of being messy from his own come. It feels dirty, which is another thing he hasn't let himself enjoy in too long. His body is loose and the weight of Dean’s body on top of him is so strangely comforting. Dean continues to thrust into him, his own movements and words becoming more stuttered. Castiel wraps his arms around Dean and lifts his hips.
But in reality, he wasn’t bothered. He was glad that Cas felt comfortable enough to strike out on his own. As for him, he had seen a few booths that caught his eye, and he was more than capable of doing a little exploration on his own.
His stomach rumbles, sending him into the kitchen for his afternoon snack. He looks in the cabinet and pulls out a bag of chips. Cas would definitely encourage him to reconsider his choice and take a second look a second look at the fruit bowl sitting on the kitchen island, so lovingly curated. Local oranges and peaches, with some kiwis and avocado in there, too. Cas is such a health nut, Dean's seen him eat an avocado like it was an apple. Just peel off the skin and
But this girl appears undaunted by his curtness. She falls in step beside him. "Where you from?" she asks. Her voice is like a cheerleader's, but something in it seems tough. Like if a cheerleader chewed dip, or went to a gun range on the weekends.
“No, I do," she smiled wide, leaning farther over the booth toward him. Dean's gaze couldn't help but be drawn down to the deep V of her t-shirt, below which sat a line of three Greek letters he couldn't identify. "We’ve got a class together, don’t we?”
Dean placed his head on Cas shoulder. An immense surge of pride pulsed within him. “We are too damn lucky for words.”
It would be nice if for once, he could be the one who threw caution to the wind. If he could get to be a little fun, a little spontaneous.
Castiel turns away from her, from all the prying eyeshadow of his (former) co-workers and collects his things in his arms. He wants to get this over with, to take his leave with his head held high before Balthazar begins to spread whatever false reports he’s built in his head- that is, if he hasn’t already started disseminating the rumors.
Castiel groans internally at the thought of ordering delivery for one. Yet another cliché- God, this is so awful. But he doesn’t want the delivery person to give him that pitying look, asking shrewd with his eyes him why Cas is all alone on a Friday night, half drunk and ordering too many noodles.
Dean leaned down and inhaled deeply the delicious odor that sprang forth from Cas’ neck. It pleased him endlessly. It was perfection contained in one single thing. God, he loved Castiel so goddamn much.
Dean looked between the two of them and feigned annoyance. "You two are going to be trouble for me." He raised his brows at them and turned swiftly back toward second base and the game that was previously the most exciting thing about his evening.
But… nothing does. It’s silence for a few minutes, Castiel staring wide-eyed at that door. And then more sounds of sickness follow, and Castiel breathes out the air he’d been holding in. He’s safe for a few more minutes, at least.
"You'll learn to cope," he directs at Gabriel, who seems genuinely surprised at the level of bite in Dean's words. If he intends to respond, he misses his chance, as Dean turns back around to Castiel and asks, "Can we go?"
upset. Like he’s the idiot to let himself be tricked by some unfeeling jock asshole for the hundredth time. God, what was he thinking? How could he have let himself believe…
He orders their beverages sheepishly with a couple of treats- because at the tail end of his heat chocolate is truly one of the greatest medicines anyone can offer and then slinks back to the table. Castiel is sitting there, staring across the street at the people there, an inquisitiveness humming in his features.
They’re doing just that, chatting outside the meeting room, Pamela giving him a few leads for info on his education article- when Balthazar strides up beside them and flashes him them all of his bright, perfectly white teeth.
And now he does have that. This big house with the sunny porch and a kitchen that never runs out of food and a room of his own. A room he doesn't
Dean gave him one more smile and then rose to his feet, just as Lisa started to approach the bed. As they crossed paths, he darted in quick to give her a kiss on the cheek. She flashed her teeth in that charming way she did and shooed him away flirtatiously.
Of course, it could have fallen through and Lisa didn’t end up coming over… but, now that he’s thinking of it, Dean had confirmed it her visit the very next day. Had talked about it. Had apologized half-heartedly for “sexiling” Castiel, though really Cas knew he was just using it as a thinly-veiled excuse to brag about it, yet again.
"Oh my," he twirls his fat little fingers dramatically, "A coffee date. Two young lovers, venturing out on the town in hopes of romance-
Dean groans in annoyance. "I thought I wasn't supposed to have heats with the stuff Amelia gave me. What gives?"
"Something up?" Jo interrupts his thoughts. She looks dubious. Her head pivots, glancing around to see what- or whom- might have Dean suddenly distracted.
Castiel nodded emphatically. It was hard to remember that he’d barely known Dean for a week, when he felt more comfortable around that boy than he had around anyone else for a long time.
Which is fine. He is not here for Dean, he’s here for Alfie. Alfie who is smiling at him all wide and goofy, and keeps brushing up against him unnecessarily. Castiel pretends that he doesn’t notice, because he likes Alfie and he enjoys spending time with him and confrontation is a terrible thing that he will always avoid at all costs.
"Yeah," Dean mutters. The only suitable response to her particularly astute observation. If he's going to have to have this conversation a million times, he's not going to exhaust himself on the details.
And sometimes he even just listens, when Dean has to rant about some roadblock or whatever other insignificant bullshit happened in his day. Even when his eyes are glazing over cus he’s so tired, he never tells Dean to shut up or leave him alone.
They'd always been there for each other, especially on big days. He'd been to, like, four different piano recitals of Cas'. And he liked going to each and every one of them, because of how happy it made Cas when Dean was waiting for him by the stage at the end.
He never kept one long enough to really learn anything, which was fucking frustrating. Sometimes he didn't know why he bothered anyways. The older he got, the sadder the whole endeavor seemed. What, was he going to do, get discovered? Become a some big shot rock star at thirty, thirty-five years old?
His gaze is fixed on the road, and his hands alternate between wrapping around the steering wheel and gesturing into the air emphatically. His muscles are practically rippling through his leather jacket. Castiel takes all this in with a sort of hazy filter before he turns his own stare out the window to inspect where they are. He knows the road, but not why they're here. It doesn't appear that there headed anyway in particular.
But Ruby was unfazed. She was mostly likely used to her father’s complete inability to answer any of her questions. She approached Roman where he sat tucked up in between layers of blankets and peered in curiously before turning back around toward her fathers. “But, he looks different than he did a few days ago.”
Hannah says nothing in response to this. Her eyes continue to stare out the window, and Castiel goes to turn up the volume of the music. They fall into silence for the next few minutes, and Cas worries to himself that this is going to negatively affect the way she thinks about her fathers.
A thought comes to Castiel, and he has to let out a little chuckle. “You know, I think you and my friend Charlie would really get along.”
"He said no, Sam." Cas cuts in and the furor in his voice is enough to freeze hot wax. Sam's eyes widen and he backs down. Castiel can see what he's done and seems to walk back a few steps. "I'm sorry, but Dean has been through enough today."
But it was hard for him to see anything good about the situation. He was seventeen, and he just wanted to be able to spend his days with the boy he was so madly in love with. For him, all the Army did was keep them apart, and threaten to throw Dean into harm's way at any given moment. And for that, he hated the Army. He hated it, hated it, hated it.
“Castiel, Dean, why don’t you all go out for a walk for a nice while?" says Mother. "I’ll prepare supper to be ready when you return.”
The second the clock ticks onto the eleventh minute, he does an odd slow jog into the bathroom to check on his pee sticks. His eyes move slowly down the line, inspecting one after the other after the other. Then he stands to his feet and regards his reflection, his heart fully stopped inside his chest.
“I dunno,” Dean shrugs, moving from Cas’ side of the room over to his own. “It could be good. Make it so it doesn’t look weird when we’re out together. I feel like some of the guys are getting the wrong idea.”
He sighs again as he raises his head to meet Dean’s eye. Cas doesn’t want to lie to him. He doesn’t want to keep anything from him, either. Just as in their discussion the other night, he wants to start things off with a clean slate for them.
Dean’s heart stopped cold inside his chest. He rotated, slowly, until he was face to face with the threatening glare Lisa was sending him.
But, he's not going to let Cas see how that all makes him feel. Right now Castiel's eyes are shining at him right now, and that's distracting enough.
Gabriel, still, is disappointed by this news. He huffs, "Well, that's boring," with a pout before he turns and leaves the room. Cas inches closer to Dean and inspects him carefully.
It’s unclear who’s to blame. It doesn’t feel so much like one of them leans in, or the other. More like a gravitational pull that has them moving closer and closer until finally Dean’s head falls just enough that their lips touch, and then it’s a go.
“Okay,” Dean responds amicably. He leans in and begins to press light kisses against Castiel’s skin; on his shoulder, chest, and arm. “Take your time. A whole minute. Two, even.”
He does have to pop by once or twice to grab books and papers, but he makes sure to do that during times that he is
It is killing Dean to have to stand here and break her heart over and over again. He runs a hand over his face and prepares to salt her wound again.
He thinks this to himself as he shuffles in through the front door, but his head hangs down hopelessly. He should be riding high, but instead the opposite feels true.
He wouldn’t say that he ‘woke up’, per se, since that implies having slept at some point; and he doesn’t see how the hours spent tossing and turning in the bed alone last night constitute anything that comes close to rest.
“Right,” Dean confirmed. “And you two have been friends outside of that class for months. Which means...”
Dean grabs at his wrists to halt Castiel’s movement. His eyes pin Castiel to the spot, and his voice is firm. “Cas, stop it.”
After several unreasonably long moments, his brain starts back up and he can feel some semblances of firing between his synapses.
I feel like I've read this chapter over and over twenty times and I just can't do any more proofreading. Sorry if this one feels plot heavy in the beginning, sometimes these things get away from me! I'm loving hearing from you guys in the comments, keeps me going when inspiration is low! Anyway, here you are: enjoy (:
He knows that Dean enjoys cooking for himself, though he’d be furious if the fellows down at the pub ever found out, and that when he brings Castiel flowers, he’ll always choose daisies because they make him smile, and because he wants to make Castiel smile.
"Hey," she says, deciding to be done with this conversation, "Come with me to find my little minx, will ya?"
“When will this family’s vendetta on all of life’s greatest pleasures cease?” Gabe cries, and for now the tension fades.
He also didn’t want to leave Dean. Their marriage was so fresh, he’d only just started to be a husband. He wanted to give it a real try before he went running back home with his tail between his legs.
It’s true that the majority of students here are upper middle class in a way that makes Dean realize for the first time in his life how far in the lower end his family had been. They were always comfortable enough, sure- but these kids waved around their fancy gadgets and sporty cars the way Dean had shown off his Pokemon cards as a kid.
And for the record, Dean does deliver on his wedding night promise. When the festivities end, and the newly wedded couple return to their new marriage home for the evening, the door is barely closed before clothes are being ripped off and the two of them are a sweaty, singular beast on the bed, huffing and groaning and moaning. Both of their dress shirts are lost to the cause. Afterward, Castiel promptly declares it to be the best night of his life. Dean doesn’t waste to breathe to tell him the same.
at the same time. "Hey, you," he says so cheerfully, and it's heart-breaking how earnest even that small greeting sounds from him. He's so happy to see Dean. It makes all the warmth in Dean's body turn into something not quite the same. He wants to kiss him so badly.
Dean looks over his shoulder at last, and catches sight of Castiel. His eyes glaze over with joy, and the casualness in the “Morning” he greets Castiel with is incredibly shallow. He’s practically glowing.
Cas doesn't know, but he wants to believe the latter, so he does. "No, that sounds great. Here, give me your glass. I'll get us refills."
That’s… a little weird. But it seemed like the only thing he could do with the energy he felt. He couldn’t
Before he’d even finished reading the last text message, a heat had emerged from deep within Dean’s inside, and he had already thrown the phone in his pocket and gone looking for his coat.
When he finally parked the car and made his way to the offices of the Kansas Department of Children and Family Services, he found a bustling room filled with constant movement and commotion.
He finally arrives back at his own building, and he thanks God to be home. He needs a little alone time. Dean should be in class most of the day, so that will give Cas some time before he has to face him.
And even though Castiel knows it's a horrible idea, that the last thing he wants to do is drag their daughter into whatever mess their personal lives might consist of, he hears himself stuttering out, “Does… does Daddy have a boyfriend?”
“I can’t blame you,” he muttered, curling up into himself. “I felt the same. It’s… it’s not your fault.”
Which, obviously, Castiel does. It’s all he does for the next hour: thinks about it. It’s lucky that his Thursday class schedule ends at 12:30. He couldn’t have paid attention in class even if he wanted to this particular afternoon.
Now, though, Dean’s eyes go sly. A sneaky curl presents itself at the corner of his lips. “Wasn’t I your boss once?”
He is aware though, of the weirdness of this whole thing. But it feels like a far-off thing, the voice on the end of a telephone call with especially bad reception. That old rotten feeling in his gut is conspicuously absent, and for once he isn't going to go chasing it down.
It’s all very complicated, and it’s got Cas wondering if maybe he has an anxiety disorder. The internet seems to think so.
Dean gestured proudly at the vehicle behind him, but Castiel’s face remained utterly neutral. “I’ve seen your father’s car before, Dean.”
For now, he casts his eyes to the ground once more and murmurs a confession. “I’ve never… been with anyone.”
Cas could be funny about sex. He wasn’t like Dean, who was always down for it, any time, any where, any weather, whatever. Cas needed to be in the mood. Which Dean didn’t mind, not one little bit. But sometimes it could get confusing, when Dean thought the way to fix a problem is with a little fooling around, and he ended up being way, way off-base, and normally made things worse.
His eyes have shifted downward, shamefully, but he can still see the way that Dean is peering down at him: like he’s confused, almost hurt. Cas doesn’t know what to do with himself. He doesn't like behaving this way, but what else can he do? He fears losing Dean more than anything in this world. He needs to show him that he's an adult, too. That he'll do whatever it takes.
So, it's nice to have at least two people with their heads set on their shoulders like Dean's is. Jo is sweet beneath her tough demeanor, and Ash... well, Dean can't quite figure him out just yet, but it's nice to have two whole friends to his name. It's two more than he thought he'd have, that's for sure.
But at last he does reach the door, and he's ready to go and plop himself down on the beach or maybe find some hole in the sand to bury himself in until he doesn't have to come back into this mess. As the door swings open though, there's another figure standing there on the porch. A woman, around the same age as Daphne and Castiel, with red hair so bright it makes Dean think of Charlie instantly.
The scallion pancakes that Cas had ordered are shared between them, though he leaves the last one for Dean to have. Dean accepts it without shame and Cas wonders how he managed to forget the way Dean can really scarf down food when he wants to.
If he had to put a word on it, he'd say they both look a little frustrated. So, good. But catching sight of them at all renews the anger that had been sitting dormant in his core, and that's what's sitting on the tip of his tongue when he makes his own re-entry into the living room several minutes later.
On the table beside his bed, his phone starts to vibrate incessantly. One, two, three messages roll in in quick succession. He grabs the phone off quickly, hating the sound of the buzzing on wood, and glances anxiously at the screen. He doesn’t know what could be so important on a Saturday morning, but there’s a sinking suspicion at the front of his mind.
it. He understands everything about the way Cas is with him. When they're together in the same room and that smell hits him, he knows from the deepest part of his core that this is it. They really are true mates.
But Cas didn't only put Dean in his place. Nah, if that was all it was, it would probably be a little too close to home (literally) for Dean not to think he just ended up with another version of his dad in some twisted Oedipal complex thing.
He doesn’t even know what he is doing. Genuinely, in his own mind, he is trying to believe that he doesn’t care that Dean is there. That he can focus on anything else for even just a single evening.
The following day at work brings another staff meeting, which brings a new rounds of nerves for Castiel. He’s been to a few of these already, but it still feels like a ton of pressure, especially when he can feel Zachariah’s distaste for him emanating off of the older man.
“He’s not my-- I wasn’t going to, obviously," said Dean defensively, "This situation’s already enough of a mess as it is, I don’t need to bring him into it.”
What he’s pleading for he has no idea, he’s just letting the words flow out as they pop into his brain. But the results comes soon. Just a few minutes later, Dean curls his fingers around Cas’s shoulder and increases his speed.
But does he even want to be with Dean? There's a reason they're divorced. It's not as if they we crazy in love when Castiel made the decision to leave three years ago. Granted, some things have changed...
Cas laughs in a relaxed way, though he doesn’t know why. “Follow me into the kitchen, I’ll get you a drink.”
The way that Alfie is looking over at him suddenly has Castiel feeling self-conscious. Maybe he’s just not used to being so showered with attention or kindness, but more than anything else it just makes him feel uncomfortable.
The girl's jaw dropped in a totally fake, exaggerated way. “You’re a high school student? No way.” When Dean gave her a cool nod, she insisted, “I would’ve sworn you were a sophomore, at least.”
Before the thought could even finish, the door behind Cas was propelled open and a grey figure was lunging at him. It just barely brushed Cas' side before Dean reached out and tugged him away.He tucked Cas up behind him and pushed them both back, up against a kitchen counter, and then sized up his opponent.
He had to say, the feeling of incredible joy he felt getting to be around Dean again for the first time in so long almost made him feel like the separation was worth it. He treasured every day, every kiss, every late night drive about a thousand times as much as he would have the years before.
It had a little backyard where they had their friends over for beer and burgers and where Dean swore one day he was gonna set up a karaoke machine just to piss Cas off (and maybe, sometimes, he would do that version of "I'm Too Sexy" that makes Cas laugh in a way that Dean could listen to for the rest of his life on repeat without getting tired of it).
friends, who he doesn't need to fake anything with. Last year, back in Lawrence, everything was a damn performance. Dean had no idea how exhausting it was until he didn't have to do it any more.
He takes a deep breath and hands his glass to Anna for a refill. “Now, can we move on and try to have a civilized meal? Or is that too much to ask?”
But, Cas was walking really close behind him, and when he breathed out Dean could see the little puffs of air like clouds, which made him feel all warm inside and like maybe this was all worth it?
The first occasion they had to take the Impala for a proper trip, give her a chance to let her stretch her legs, was the same day that they got to play hooky from school without even getting in trouble for it. Jo had discovered this loophole (and of course it would be Jo, troublemaker that she was) that college visits counted as excused absences for seniors, and Dean had needed no convincing to get in on that action. So, early one Friday morning, he loaded up his Baby and hit the road for Manhattan.
Cas might still have his purity, but he isn’t totally without knowledge. He understands what Meg was suggesting, indelicately as she was: there are rumors abound about Dean. That he’s slept with others, before. That he’s given them his body, and that he’s taken theirs in kind.
It’s a little hard not to feel sad. Disjointed. “Out of whack,” he can hear his mom’s voice finishing for him.
Yes, that was why Castiel cheered so loudly when the winning goal was scored. For Dean. For his self-confidence.
Somehow now it feels even more menacing. Which, he supposes it is. There's more at stake here, now. But he tells himself to calm down. There’s no reason to panic yet.
Castiel feels a strong urge to leap across the room and slap a hand over her mouth. Is she being serious right now? Not even five minutes their gusts have been here, and she's already taken to snarky comments.
So it is that he is now walking down the road home with a certain spring in his step. He’s young and he’s in love and the air is fresh and the birds are singing.
Ideally, he would have woken up with his boyfriend in his arms, and the smell of bacon grazing his nostrils, and he’d feel like a changed man. As it is, he’d just like ten more minutes underneath the covers.
He could see Cas struggling against him, wanting so bad to take him at face value but knowing, but with the numbers and statistics flashing before his eyes, it was hard. Castiel wasn't hardwired for hope. That wasn't what he grew up on, and he'd never had much reason to feel it. But that was before Dean. Dean wanted so badly to be the thing that gave him hope like he'd never had before.
“You’re cute when you’re over thinking,” Dean told him with a smile, still close enough to breathe in Castiel’s air.
She continued to stare, open-mouthed and frozen from shock, all the while he was rambling on. He didn’t turn around, but he could feel Cas’ eyes burning a hole in the back of his head.
And damn if that didn’t just about make Dean’s heart drop down to the floor right then. He sank onto the bench beside Castiel, as much to steady himself as to comfort his boyfriend. “Nothing is certain, Cas. You’re freaking out.”
He withdraws his hand and uses it to reach for an almost-empty ship bowl beside them. “I’ve got to do some rounds. I’ll catch up with you in a bit.”
He knows Dean. After eleven years of their lives tangled together, he doesn't have to make a guess at what Dean is storming in there to do right now. What he doesn't know is how he feels about it.
She keeps her back to him, but somehow her body language is still open, inviting. He watches her face as she works and sees the way her eyebrows raise curiously. "Are you interested in Castiel?"
But his eyes can't help bouncing back up to the sea of people, even just for a second. Castiel follows his eye line until it falls upon just one person. He has to hold back the smile that threatens to break out over his face, so he bites down on his lip when he turns back to Alfie. He reaches a hand out and lays on Alfie's little skeleton shoulder.
Castiel smiles at the praise. The hand on his shoulder moves from firm to soft, running smoothly over the curve of his arm.
Apparently Missouri did not appreciate the comic relief, because the look she gave Dean made him feel like a class-A idiot for the suggestions.
That’s it for Dean. He doesn’t need to take this. Not from this freakin'... freakin' beta. He stands to his feet and throws- literally throws- his dish into the sink and leaves it there. He’s not going to sit around and let Gabriel mock him to his face. Not today.
And then when Dean goes home at the end of the day and Cas gets close enough to catch a whiff- well, his reaction isn't as friendly, but Dean knows he can't help it.
The sentence cuts off sharply. It cuts off sharply because the words catch in his throat when he looks up and sees none other than Castiel walking in through the door.
He’d just gone and done it. He hadn’t asked about Castiel’s opinion in any of it, even though they'd been dating long enough for his opinion to matter.
“I know that," Dean flashes him a smile like a hungry wolf and Castiel has to fight himself not to thrust his hips into his face, "I want to. Is that okay?”
It took some coaxing, Dean leading Castiel into the passengers’ seat with a firm hand on his back and even buckling the seatbelt for him, before he saw some tension relax away from Cas’ shoulders.
Castiel picks his head up and twitches his nose. He catches sight of Dean and his face takes on a soft, easy joy. "You're looking much better," he says around a smile.
He tries to turn his grimace of pain into a friendly smile. “Likewise. I mean, I haven’t been able to get Charlie to shut up about you since your first date.”
Later, when they’re standing outside in the brisk November air, two bottles of wine deep, Balth in a peacoat and Cas in his ratty old khaki thing, he smiles. “I had a wonderful time Balthazar. Thank you so much for inviting me out.”
It only took two drinks before they were back on the sofa, knees touching and posture growing more relaxed. Another half a drink and they were at it again, hands tugging at collars and ripping at buttons, until Castiel was underneath him, fingers tugging at his hair and begging Dean to mark him with a bite.
Castiel, of course, rolls his eyes at her. “That’s something you will never be privy to, and I hope you never ask about again.”
For the most part, people don’t seem to be too hung up on the labels of Alpha or Omega or whatever. People do't appear to separate based on presentation nearly as much as they did in Lawrence. In fact, he hasn't even gotten a single comment yet from a fellow student. The school nurse seems to be weirdly obsessed with him and how he's "adjusting", but she's the only one going out of her way to point out that he is what he is.
They tumble into the living, next to the open door that leads to the back stairway. Dean's head tucked comfortably but not delicately onto Castiel's chest. The sound of the beach floats in. He focuses on breathing. His own, and Castiel's. He feels the deep inhalations, the way his chest expands with air like a balloon. He'd never thought much about breathing before. To be fair, he didn't really need to. It was just something he did. But Cas is all into yoga and he yacked so much to Dean about it that something must have stuck.
A few frantic whimpers come from Castiel, and Dean responds with his own low moans. “Oh, that’s nice,” he whispers, letting his lips mark a trail from Cas’ jaw to his ear, “You feel so good. I've missed you so much, all day.”
Cas appears a little taken aback by that, but not hurt. He pushes off of the doorframe and steps into the room. “No, it doesn’t," he agrees, "But I am a bit older than you, which means I know how to keep my calm about things like this. I don’t pack a bag every time things get a little confusing.”
And then he’d had to go and get to drunk and make an idiot out of himself. Now he dreads going back to his own dorm, dreads the way Dean will look at him with pity and disgust.
He wants to be able to talk to Charlie about all this. But, she’s nearly impossible to get ahold of ever since she got a new girlfriend.
But Alfie… Alfie doesn’t look at him like that. He just looks soft and nice and wide-eyed, and right now he smells really good and Castiel just needs….
It turns out that he is the one who is jealous. He feels himself wishing that once, just once, even if he was drunk, that Dean would have acted that way with him.
From the minute they took their seats, there was a bad feeling building in Dean's gut. Cas asked if there was anything he could do to help, but short of knocking him out with a swift blow to the head, Dean couldn't think of anything.
Dean stopped his feet, momentarily, and took advantage of the moment to look into Castiel’s azure eyes. He sighed, loudly, and released some of the tension from his shoulders. “Castiel, I think you’re so great, and I’m fuckin’ into you, and don’t listen to anyone if they tell you differently. Okay?”
Because, why? Why would he say that? Why would he say that when he's trapped in a car with a freaking Alpha who has probably only ever got one thing on his mind lately, if they're being honest- certain images swirling around his brain, burned into his eyes with awful, sweaty certainty.
Two weeks went by, but not in a flash. They were, quite possibly, the longest weeks of Dean’s entire twenty-six year existence. Sleep had been totally eliminated from his life, which made every other function just that much more difficult to perform.
When she pulls the paper back, Dean is gone. Castiel doesn't let himself linger on that, instead spending his time complimenting his daughter on her perfect autumnal color scheme.
“Uh-oh.” Dean smirked. “That’s never good.” The way Cas’ countenance grew cold only served to make Dean more serious. “I’m sorry, bad joke. Talk to me.”
Cas’ voice was raw, rough, like he was parched and couldn’t find what he needed. Dean sprinted towards the bedroom, already ripping buttons off his shirt as he made his way.
He leans down and grabs at the first pair of jeans he sees and tugs them onto his body. It’s only once he’s fastened the button that he realizes they’re Dean’s-- a bit too long on him and loose around the waist as well, but he doesn’t care. He is overwhelmed with the urge to get out of that room, stat.
Which is why he tries to rush home, to beat the street lights back to his neighborhood. He doesn’t quite make it- it’s dark by the time he gets home, but he feels safe right up until the moment he gets to the door. That’s the moment, surprisingly, when his heart starts to beat uncontrollably in his chest.
He can’t help it: the color in his cheeks darkens to a much deeper red and he feels heat rising up the back of his neck. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“When you first started taking care of Ruby," he choked out, "she… she was just your boyfriend’s kid. You know? It’s not the same. You couldn’t tell people she was yours, you didn’t get to have her call you Daddy. You didn’t get to enjoy those little moments, like the first time she smiled or the first time she babbled something that sounded like your name.”
Turning his head away, Castiel’s confusion only seemed to deepen. He took a few seconds before he spoke again. “And... I’m sorry-- I was in the shop when this happened?”
good that Cas thinks he might explode from the back and forth going on inside his head, the ping-ponging of his mental state.
Castiel laughs because he doesn’t know what else to do. He scans the rest of the restaurant again, but still he doesn’t come across the face he wants to see.
He's pretty sure that he won't be able to breathe again until they're back on the road for the coast. And man, that can't come soon enough.
He trailed a few steps behind Castiel, walking down the hall to the nursery, but just outside the door his path was blocked. Cas had halted in the doorway. Dean peered over his shoulder to see what he was watching.
Cas was looking over at him under heavy lids, blinking for long moments between flashing his sparking eyes Dean's way. He was probably sleepy from the medicine, but Dean could swear that was the very face Cas was making at him just before... well right before he hit his head.
"Hold on a minute." Cas pulls out his phone and starts looking for something. "I'm taking you for a second opinion."
There’s Balthazar as well, but the thought of that makes Castiel laugh in a humorless way. If there is one thing Balthazar isn't known for, it's compassion. And Castiel isn't so naive as to not notice that Balthazar doesn't exactly love kids.
Sam looked at him cautiously, and then let his shoulders sag in a show of relief. “Thanks. I’ve got a Torts exam to study for, and I really need to get down to business.”
Dean looked over at him and quirked an eyebrow. That was... not what he had expected to hear. Cas wasn't one for jealousy, especially not with someone he knew, like Jo. But he wouldn't look at Dean, wouldn't meet his eye. Dean might've laughed if he didn't feel so many nerves simmering beneath the surface.
“Or…” Dean offered, knowingly offering up some of his best boyish, come-love-me charm, “you can just stay and we can do it all day,”
But he couldn't avoid him forever, obviously. That Sunday, Cas bit the bullet and went to Dean's place to collect Hannah himself. He was surprised to find a much more relaxed Dean. He was controlled, that was clear-- holding back. But he kept his cool in front of Hannah and he treated Cas with civility, and if that's what he was offering then Cas would take it.
He send a longing glance to the empty space beside Castiel, which Cas follows with his eyes. Every second Dean keeps talking, it feels like his heart is going from Low to E. In his head, he knows that this is wrong, that it’s somehow off, that all will
The monumentality of it all is coming over him in waves. Even looking at it objectively, this is quite possibly the biggest mistake he’s ever made in his life. And it is going to have ramifications, of that he feels dreadfully sure. For him, for Dean, for Hannah.
Out of nowhere, halfway through the film, Hannah perks up and asks him, “Daddy, when I was in your belly, what did you eat?”
Castiel peered over at him sideways and Dean saw how long his eyelashes were. “Dean Winchester, who knew you’d be such a baby about a little old ghost?”
He catches Dean’s eyes quickly and immediately has to look away again. “I’m like this sometimes. I… I thought I was better, since we’ve been…. I haven’t felt this way since I’ve known you.” Best to lay it all out on the table. No room for misconceptions. “It can be a lot to handle.”
No movement from under the comforter. Dean releases a sigh into the room. He must be exasperated. Cas thinks this must be him giving up. Any second now, the bed will squeak again she he stands up, and he’ll kick Cas out of the bed and tell him to go find somewhere else to stay…
Another week goes by and barely even a breath out of line passes between Castiel and Dean. When they’re in the room together, it’s radio silence. Cas doesn’t even so much as spare a glance to the other side of them room; and if Dean does, then he doesn’t catch it. Or care, for that matter.
He stops suddenly. It takes a moment for Castiel to realize what’s happening, and just as he does, Dean bursts out, “--buddy. Thanks, buddy.” And then he’s turned on his heels and scurried out before before Castiel has the opportunity to properly react.
He knew he loved him in that scary, too-big, no way they could keep being friends after this, kind of way. He was terrified that it would slip out one time, in the middle of fooling around, when he didn't mean to say anything. It should have made him more cautious. Should have, anyway.
“Excuse you. I think you mean to say badass," Charlie corrects him, soundings not a little put-off by his diminutive language. "But seriously. Things seem okay between you and Dean?”
“Oh,” Dean popped his head up as the thought occurred to him like a stroke of brilliance, “Can I take her over to Cas’?”
His hope is that Cas doesn't know about his wall. He thinks it would hurt him, to know that Dean trusts him any less than one hundred percent. Even though it's not Cas that's the problem. It's just... life.
Even if he had turned out to be an alpha, ended up with a nice girl, he wouldn't have ever seen himself being quite so domestic. Wouldn't have seen himself going to bed every night with a bookworm.
A single blows lands in Balthazar's office. Dean’s fist balled against the pronounced line of Balth’s cheekbone. Castiel watches as his boss stumbles back, flabbergasted, and clutches at his injury with an open mouth
After they’d finished, when Dean had made Castiel come twice, screaming both times, and they were tied together by the end of Dean’s inflated knot, Cas dotted kisses adorably over the surface of his lover’s face. “Thank you,” he whispered, sounding so much like the first day they’d met, “thank you for coming over and taking care of me. That was amazing. I’m sure it wasn’t easy to get away.”
Dean was about to scoff out loud, like that title has somehow superseded ‘boyfriend’ on the marquis of his life. At that very moment though, a squeaking sound appears in the doorway to cut him off, and he turned around in his seat to see a six-foot-tall mess of balloons reading “Get Well Soon”. Dean sighed and leaned back in his chair, feeling deflated beyond words.
"No, that's not--" Dean leaned back against the wall. “I’m just saying it’s different this time, and I know that.”
He doesn’t assume that it’s directed at him, but still Cas jumps back, curious to see what has caused this sudden commotion. What he finds is a very familiar face, standing not too far away from him, surrounded by a posse of lackeys.
If anything made him feel like a man, it was being able to call this car his own. He actually couldn't really believe it was true.
His mind is swimming. He should call Charlie back, except he's too mixed up to even try and put this shit into words right now. The only thing he can focus on is the need that circling around his mind, the want to go stuff his face into Cas' pillow right now to make himself feel better.
It takes Dean too long to realize that Cas isn't sitting there thinking abut something. He's offended. Cas is one of those rich kids- or at least, it seems like he is, if the new information Dean's just overheard is accurate. He's probably thinking that Dean oughta shut his mouth and be grateful--
Dean didn’t wait for him to finish the thought. He held a finger in the air, angrily, a heavy glare settling on his features. “Wait here,” he commanded and turned on his heels, marching over toward Cassie before Castiel would protest.
Castiel goes to the sink for a glass of water. He hasn’t let himself think about these things for a long time, probably because of that fact that it still hurts. He would rather pretend that he never felt anything at all, that would make all of this so much easier. Feeling Dean's hand on him last night, waking up to him smiling in Castiel's kitchen. It's confusing, to say the least. It's bringing back things Castiel has long since buried in a dark corner of the attic of his mind.
Fuck. No thinking about that. He had to remind himself to go back to being distressed. It was so hard around Castiel.
Another growl from Dean, and he leapt into action like a tiger called to battle. He took his time, worked Cas over with his hand and his tongue, split him wide open until he begged for release. He told him how good he was, what a perfect omega; told him he loved him. Dean felt like it was his truest purpose on this earth, doing this for Castiel at exactly that moment. He didn't have a single regret while he was buried inside his mate.
“Screw you, Alistair!” Cas shouts out at the top of his lungs, ripping himself free from the vice grip on his arm. Ali instantly takes another step forward and reaches another hand out toward Castiel. At that very second, someone comes tearing across the pavement and tackles Alistair right into the ground.
Castiel's face falls. He doesn't know Dean's dad, obviously, but he knows Dean. And he can probably relate to the strained-father-son relationship of it all. In any case, he looks genuinely upset for Dean. "Oh. Dean, I'm sorry."
Accident or not, it sticks, this new friendship that Dean’s struck. Jo and Ash become his shepherds through the process of adjusting to Half Moon Bay- and whether or not he wants to admit it, Dean could use the help.
He’s happy that the week seems to move along without anymore awkward incidences, and he’s hopeful that his daughter’s forgotten all about their car ride conversation. He does not want her their conversation to Dean. Cas has certain questions about Dean's inquiry into his personal life, but for right now, he's going to forget the exchange ever happened. If he were to indulge the idea, it would only serve to make their lives murkier.
sheets and his ratty old stuffed teddy right at hand. He sunk down onto his knees beside the bed and brushed Ben’s soft hair back from his forehead.
And when Sam smiles and makes fun of Dean to Cas, says he doesn’t know what’s got him so busy that he can’t swing by to pick up his own kid, Cas just shrugs and goes along. He pretends that he hasn’t the slightest clue why might be keeping Dean away.
Cas tries very, very hard not to let a smile crack across his face the second Dean stops talking. “Dean Winchester, are you saying you’re jealous of little old Alfie?”
He can feel Dean's resistance waning; he's too drunk to be angry for long. And, Cas thinks, maybe a little too sad.
Normally, he’d mind the somewhat significant distance between her place and his, but tonight he doesn’t. In fact, he sort of revels in it. Something in the way the wind rakes over his skin and turns his cheeks red feels suitably dramatic for his accompanying emotions.
But there's hope, since Cas immediately backpedals as soon as he looks at Dean, and he even manages to get that kind of shy, embarrassed look about him that Dean swears he's never seen on an Alpha before in his life.
That felt nice. Cas calling him brave… that felt very nice. In a warm apple pie on a Sunday afternoon kind of way.
Cas has also been trying to help him sort the rest of his shit out, too, which is more than Dean deserves. He’s looking into schools and calling different doctors, trying to see who’ll prescribe the stuff he needs without parental permission. Castiel’s already found a new job working at some… archive… thing? It’s like a library. Dean thinks. Anyway, every day when he gets home, even if he looks like he’s just been drug through the ringer, he always sits down to help Dean work on his resume or whatever else kind of bullshit problem he has.
From the edge of his vision, he sees Dean’s head tilts to the side curiously. He takes the hint to expound upon his statement.
He should tell someone. He thinks. It is too soon? No, someone else should know probably. He needs to talk about this. He needs to think about what he is going to do, preferably out loud. He has to pick up Hannah this afternoon, and he can't still be a ball of anxiety then. He can call someone or meet them somewhere and they can help him through this.
It didn’t take a genius to see that Cas was growing more and more agitated by his avoidance. At first, he was forgiving. He sent Dean encouraging texts, and told him that he hoped everything was alright. He was sweet and generous, and totally unafraid to send suggestive pictures for which Dean was incredibly grateful.
But, now that he had Ruby, things had changed. He decided to make the effort to be honest with Cas. For Cas. “I… there was so much going on. First I got the call and it was this whole thing. And then there was all the stuff you have to buy and all this shit you have to learn, and there’s so much I don’t know how to do-- and I’m trying to do it all on one hour of sleep just she gets up every 45 minutes in the night, and I don’t even know how to build a fucking crib, and I don’t think I know how to make formula the right way. I suck at this, I suck at being a father. And I’m doing it all myself and I just…”
Alfie’s puppy-dog eyes have gone red-rimmed with unshed tears. Castiel puts his head in his hands so he doesn’t have to look at them anymore.
He wished his resolve was stronger. He wished that he’d stared at the phone for days, wrestled with himself, until he finally broke down. But that wasn’t the case. Instead, he’d texted Cas the next morning, after Lisa had kissed him goodbye and told him to have a good day at work. He couldn’t wait to see him, scent him, touch him.
Dean shoots a glare at the beta, but it falls away quickly. He's in a weird mood this morning. He's trying not to be, since Cas has been sweet and woke up early to make him a big breakfast, since it's his favorite meal.
Castiel is a plaything, for his eyes only. Behind closed doors. And he’s just going to keep smiling and pretending that it’s all he wants, too.
It was a valid question. This was the moment they had been preparing for, hoping for, for months; the moment that they never really expected to come. Dean didn't have a picture of what the future looked like for them. So, the only answer he could give, what what he wanted to happen.
It’s the most honest conversation they’ve ever had. It’s definitely the longest conversation they’ve ever had.
