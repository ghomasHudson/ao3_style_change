Steve shakes his head. “I was.” He rests his elbows on his knees, head buried in his hands. “I tried to take care of this,” his eyes drop to his crotch, ”by myself. Thought that after last night, maybe it would help if I could be in this bed but…” he trails off, sounding frustrated and ashamed.
He’d never been one for casual sex, and even now, years after being out of cryo freeze and seeing how sexually free the world had become, the idea still made him blush. So he was old fashioned, a square, a prude. Whatever you wanted to call it. It felt awkward to him, being so intimate with a stranger, he honestly wasn’t even sure he would enjoy it.
“Physically, he’s mostly healed.” Bruce keeps his eyes locked on Steve, but there’s sympathy in his voice. “Otherwise...you’d have to ask him.”
“Just an hour or so,” Tony promises and feels, in his core, that his father must have made the same promise to his mother, over and over again.
Tony’s temper flared and he almost turned on his heel and walked away, but Sam grabbed him by the shoulder.
He turned to the kid. “Peter, I’ll give you a million dollars to switch numbers with me.” Tony looked hopefully at the kid, who he had invited at the last minute. Peter just shook his head, grinning.
The two of them worked in tandem, touching and kissing and stroking, until Steve was writhing on the sofa, making little confused noises of pure pleasure.
He braces himself for questions about what Peter may have overheard about the quantum tunnel, about what it might mean for him, about why they would send him in alone.
“Tony….” Steve holds his gaze in the mirror, panicked but out of options, before giving him a barely perceptible nod.
Steve just sighed his approval into Kara’s mouth and gave a slight nod. As they kissed, she picked up his right hand and placed it along the inside of her thigh, inviting him to stroke the soft skin.  Steve did just that, his attention divided by the feel of her skin under his hand and Tony’s slow caress across his abdomen. He was already overwhelmed, everything inside him on fire, his cock throbbing.
“Plus, I’ll go with you, if you want. Make sure everything goes smoothly,” Tony offered far too casually, fixing Steve with a stare. His loose tie and unbuttoned collar gave him the air of a rich lothario, which is exactly what he was.
“Look, I’m mostly kidding, but don’t act like it’s not obvious. I’m just saying, it’s harder to ignore something if you have to share a bed with it.”
Sam did a little fist pump and pretended to tick off a box. “That’s me and the kid. We took the under on that one.”
There’s a brief moment of hesitation but Peter shakes him off. “I’m glad you’re OK Mr. Stark, I really am.”  When he looks up, his eyes are big, round pools of grief that make Tony’s heart ache.
The first time felt like a one time thing, not exactly a mistake, but a sudden glitch in their protocols that allowed everything to go haywire before snapping back to normal. But it happens again, this time in the simulation room, after Natasha and Bruce suggest Tony get in some extra hand-to-hand practice. He never enters the field without his suit, but Steve had also insisted, saying it was never a bad thing to learn a few new moves.  Steve had showed him how to get out of a reverse choke hold, flipping them both to the ground. The scenario gave Tony the upper hand, let him pin Steve’s hands above his head. Instead of releasing his grip, Tony rocked his thigh between Steve’s legs and kissed him until he was panting, desperate for air. Like before, he pushed a hand down Steve’s sweatpants, but this time exposed him fully. The cold air hitting his dick made Steve gasp.
It took a total of 10 days before Bruce discharged him from the medical wing and back to his quarters. The fact that he pulled through was a minor miracle considering his blood had almost been ionized into nothing. Tony had never been so grateful to be back in his own bed. He flopped onto the mattress, barely making it under the covers before wiping out. From his internal clock, it felt like he’d only been asleep for minutes when the bell chimed.
“That’s the problem though, I’m not going to forget,” Tony said. “I don’t want to forget. Even if my mind did, my body wouldn't.” He stepped a fraction closer to Steve who still hovered by the door, ready to bolt even though it was his apartment. “I can’t get rid of this and I don’t want to.”
She keeps gasping Steve’s name as she comes down, her fading orgasm winding its way through her body.  Sated, Kara drifts while Steve lightly licks between her legs. She’s too sensitive now for it to feel good, but she enjoys the softness of Steve’s hair between her fingers and likes the way Tony is staring at Steve, so she lets him stay.
“Not many,” Steve’s gaze doesn’t waiver. “Some insomnia, residual aches and pains. Nothing serious.”
“On his thigh!” Tony said. “It was on his thigh. Like, way up on the inside of his thigh. I was helping him out.”
Sam and Natasha are better at giving Steve his space, have patience for the ages, but Tony’s never been good with patience, going too fast and too headlong into everything. He watches Steve practically flee the room and it only takes a few minutes before he’s pushing back his own chair, and following him out.
The toys are gone, the clothes are gone, the furniture all put back in place. He’s not sure if he’s mad or grateful at Steve for taking care of it. The only thing left is Peter’s bear, and
He shuts his eyes one moment and the next, the jostling of the mattress wakes him. Just enough morning sunlight streams through the curtains, lighting the bedroom a deep yellow. On the other side of the bed, Peter plays with two action figures. He grins when he sees Tony’s awake.
“We don’t know that,” Tony snaps. “Whatever this is...it could wear off. Until we know more about what happened, we can’t risk it.”
Steve sat heavily on the couch, still apprehensive and anxious. He’d been more relaxed on missions to take down Hydra.  This was ridiculous he kept telling himself. He had no idea how Tony had actually talked him into coming along. Yes, he was kind of lonely, yes, sex would be nice, but he wanted a connection, someone he trusted, someone he...if not loved, then someone he knew for longer than 15 minutes.
He doesn’t answer, just lets out a miserable wail in Tony’s ear. It doesn’t sound like pain exactly, but the cry of someone utterly fed up with everything. Tony runs his fingers through Peter’s hair, ignores the little kicks Peter’s making against his side.
“He’s bruised and battered to hell but otherwise alive,” Sam had said. That was over three hours ago. Until then, they had been searching for Steve for 8 days. Sam and Rhody had been the ones to find him, half-naked and shivering in the dense, cold woods around Eastern Europe.
“Pizza, huh?” He chuckles into Peter’s hair, relieved. “I think kids need to eat a vegetable every now and then, but yeah, I think that’s possible.”
There were smothered giggles and a yelp of laughter from Peter. At his left, Steve let out a low sigh that was either disappointment or resignation or both.
Steve smothers a laugh and kneels with Tony next to the tub. He rolls up his sleeves and plunges his hands into the bathwater. He scoops water into one hand and presses the other one on top, in a sliding gesture. The friction causes the water to squirt out, hitting Peter all over his face. The kid loves it. He howls with laughter and makes Steve do it again and again, until there’s more water on them than in the tub.
Spider-Man is formidable in his own right, but Peter doesn’t have arch enemies quite yet. They toss out theories while SpongeBob SquarePants blares in the background. Peter’s eyes are practically glazed over by the time Natasha and Sam come back with Scott Lang and Hope. Tony knows a hell of a lot about a lot of things, but she’s the expert in the quantum realm and he’s grateful to have her. Scott, it turns out, is the best with kids.
“They’re waiting for you,” Natasha says. His good mood fades when he sees the tight press of her mouth.
“You’re alright,” he whispers, when Steve starts to twitch under him. He digs his thumbs into Steve’s posterior muscles, sweeping up in a little half circle until Steve is shifting his hips rhythmically against the the bed.
“OK,” Tony mumbles into his mouth. “That’s OK,” He wants to kiss Steve, has wanted to badly for days, but doesn’t take the risk now. He keeps his hand wrapped around Steve’s cock and thumbs lightly at the head. He’s slick with lube and precome and Steve moans for him as Tony jacks him at a more punishing pace. He’s keeping Steve on edge, possibly for a little too long, but it’s imperative for what he’s trying to accomplish. Before Steve can come, he eases off Steve’s dick and reaches between his legs to gently tug at Steve’s balls, making him cry out and snap his hips up.
It takes them two days--two more long, sleepless days--to search the woods where he’d been found. They find bits of his uniform, torn to shreds, in a clearing a half mile from their drop site. From there, they follow a trail of dried blood and bare foot prints back through thick underbrush until they stumble upon the farmhouse. It makes his stomach curl to have to go inside, but they do, the four of them. By the time they come out, Natasha’s eyes are red with tears, and Tony has to drop to his knees to vomit.
“Sam’s bringing me a pizza because the intern dinner was not that great. It was all cheese and weird meat.”
Two days ago, in the bathroom when Tony had first touched him, he had made a mistake. He sees that now. He kept space between their bodies, thought that after everything Steve had been through, he wouldn’t want to be touched at all. He doesn’t make the same mistake now and wraps his arms around Steve, tangling his fingers into hair as Steve hides his face against the stiff silk of Tony’s dress shirt. Light tremors run through his body and Tony digs his fingers into the stiff muscle around Steve’s back, trying to hold him together.
“I do not, actually, know what the fuck you’re talking about,” Tony said, even though he knew exactly what Sam was talking about.
He nods, and squeezes Steve hand again, tries to make his smile look a little less sad. Logically, he gets it. It’s hard seeing people you love dangle between life and death, he wouldn’t wish it on anyone.  Still, it doesn’t ease the sudden, new ache in his chest.
“Landing the jet outside the perimeter of a known Hydra base. I don’t...” he pauses again and takes another breath. “I don’t remember how I got into the woods, or into that house.”
It’s just past 1 when May comes into the lab. The lab is usually his refuge but it feels oppressive right now, their combined worry suffocating. Tony’s not a man who rattles easily, but May’s arrival means he can no longer put off what he’s been dreading.
Tony’s ability to focus is one of his greatest strengths and sometimes his biggest weaknesses. In his lab, everything else falls away and he keeps to the task at hand, running equations, modeling different particle scenarios until it’s well past midnight. He’s lost in his work, factoring in quantum variations on cell regeneration when FRIDAY sends him an alert.
Steve almost comes right there, with Tony’s hand on his wrist. He’s so hard he knows he’s not going to last long, even though he just came. He should get a condom, or be better lubricated, but he’s confused and blind with lust, heart hammering at the thought of Tony being there, watching him while he fucks. He lines up between Kara’s legs and pushes the head of his cock inside her first, just a little, before pulling back out.
Tony smiled against Steve’s neck, and pulled down the collar of his t-shirt to bite along his clavicle bone. “Sleeping next to you, and not being able to touch you, not like this, was torture.” Steve grasped at Tony’s hips and pulled him closer. He groaned as Tony bit down hard. “The first time I saw you in these damn pajamas, I thought about making you come in them.”
They still argue too much, the two of them, butting heads over policy and procedure even on good days, but things feel different now. It’s not the pettiness of before, when Tony fought back just to fight back. He loves their push and pull now, can see how it’s changing him to his core, and how lost he would be without it.
It’s after 2am when he pushes open the door to his quarters. He waits in the doorway, let’s his eyes adjust to the darkness before stepping inside. It looks like tornado hit the place. There are toys scattered across the floor, books thrown around at random, one of Peter’s shirts
Tony shakes his head as they rush down the corridor. Steve reaches the main door first, punching in the code as Tony rears up from behind.
“I’ll be fine,” he says. There’s nothing more he can do in the lab that Bruce and Hope don't already have covered. “Peter, you good hanging here with Steve?”
Maybe he had anticipated this, even hoped for it, and that’s why he’d lingered in the room for as long as he had. He could tell something was happening here, a cracking open and he didn’t want Steve to be alone.
“When they brought you up, your lungs were so water logged they were worried even your healing ability wouldn’t be enough. Peter’s lips were as blue are your cowl.”
They’re crude stick drawings, but each piece of paper features a little scene over the past few days. He hands one to Nat, one to Scott, one to Bruce and Hope and Steve.
Steve nodded. “Red Cross after the war started, but before that at Brooklyn General. She did a lot for a single mom. We never had money to do much, but sitting around the fire, listening to the radio, it was nice.”
“You alright, Rogers?” Tony asked. It felt stupid to check in on him, after all they weren’t on a mission, they weren’t fighting aliens, but he still felt responsible for Steve’s well being, even here. Especially here.
“OK. OK.” Steve puts a hand on his arm, placating. “Bruce, can we keep trying to clean up that video from the hanger? Right now, it’s a just a blur of white light. Hope, can you run some tests? Figure out if there’s any radiation or anything that might tell us what happened? Stephen, I know you haven’t been a doctor in awhile, but can we make sure Peter’s healthy?”
“We did simulations,” he says. “I wore pads here, here, here and here,” Peter points to each knee, each elbow, before pointing to his head. “And a helmet. It was cool!” For the next 10 minutes he talks non stop about watching Natasha weave and dodge and bust her way through digital bad guys.
For a long time, neither of them move, until Tony’s arm goes numb from being trapped under Steve’s chest. He wiggles his fingers and Steve gets the hint, shiting enough for Tony to free himself. Tony doesn’t go far though, just rearranges himself so he’s draped over Steve’s back, an arm wrapped around his waist.
“I don’t want to say this, but if you found him next to Scott’s van, I think we have to consider the tunnel.” Hope says.
He holds Tony’s gaze for a second, his guard still up. “I’m alright,” he says so Tony sighs and let’s it go.
“That’s not going away, Steve.” Tony says. He glances down at the bulge under Steve’s towel, and dares to places a gentle hand on Steve’s hip.
They should go get dinner or he should call a car to take Peter back to Queens, but neither of them are much in the mood to move.  They talk quietly for a long time, about the mission and the simulation and how the hell Peter managed to hack into Tony’s medical file. They talk until Peter starts to list onto his side, so Tony drops a sofa pillow onto his lap and let’s Peter rest his head. He flips on the TV and leaves it on whatever movie happens to be playing, idly stroking Peter’s hair until his breathing becomes deep and heavy.
It would be comical, the world’s greatest super solider popping boners in public, but there’s no humor in the look Steve gives him. He looks so uncomfortable and scared that Tony ushers him down the hall into his own office. It’s larger than Steve’s, with blackout shades and a very secure lock.
Tony kisses him again, losing himself a little inside the soft palette of Steve’s mouth, before finally pulling away. Steve brushes his fingers up Tony’s back, across his side, before letting them drop.
The words are sharper than anything Peter’s ever said to him, and Tony practically rears back in surprise.
Tony sat back down and began to remove his tie and waistcoat, watching as Kara turned Steve’s head towards her, giving him a slow, wet kiss.
Tony gasps and let’s Steve experiment with feel of it before gently pushing him away. He caresses the side of Steve’s face with his free hand, and speeds up his strokes with the other. Steve just opens his mouth, ready to taste Tony’s come.
“What was the dream about?” Steve asks. They’re standing at the edge of the compound’s playground, while Peter runs a circuit from the monkey bars to the slide to the mini-trampoline.
Natasha had been right, everybody needs practice, he just didn’t think she would tell Stark about it.  Why had he even said yes when Stark had delicately but deliberately floated the idea?
He was aware though, almost constantly, of the nearness of Steve’s body, as if whatever happened while they slept together never fully left him. He had woken up this morning with his limbs thrown over Steve in a way that was so proprietary, so territorial, it had embarrassed even him. He mumbled an apology as he slid his arm off of Steve’s waist, pulled his thigh back from where it was shoved between Steve’s legs. It was a small mercy that he’d slept mostly on his stomach and his morning erection was pressing into the mattress instead of along Steve’s back.
“Peter…” Tony reaches out to him, but Peter rears back, shaking his head, tears pooling in his eyes.
“You were flirting back,” Tony said from the bathroom doorway. This time Steve looked up, his face lit golden by the fire. “That’s what really bothered me.”  He held Steve’s gaze for a fraction, before shutting the door.
They swapped places 10 minutes later and by the time Steve emerged from his turn in the bathroom, Tony was buried under the covers.
Tony waves it around in his hand. “I even printed it all out for you, because I know what a luddite you are.”
Steve cuts them off before they start arguing again. “Dr. Banner, Dr. Van Dyne, how much time do you think we can stall for?” Gone is the guy who helped dry while Tony washed, the mission leader taking his place.
Steve reaches for the file, but at the last second, Tony it pulls away. “Look, you don’t have to read it if you’re not ready for it, Steve. There’s no pressure.” It’s a half-hearted protest, and they both know Steve can’t avoid these images forever, though Tony would do anything to spare him from them.
“Tony,” Steve gasps a little and begins to rock his hips again, just like last night. Tony holds him still, stopping the motion.
It had taken Tony a second to find his words, a weird, sudden warmth spreading through his chest. “Uh, thanks?” he says, regretting that it had sounded like a question.
Still, they plan. They strategize. They try to minimize risk. They arm themselves to the teeth. They have backup. Their backup has backup. There’s a plan A, a plan B, C and D.
“You can have 30 minutes,” Bruce says. “He gets to pick who stays in the room. No audio or video recording. If he shows any signs of distress, it’s over.”
“I thought maybe it was. You seem a little nervous, but it’s all right.”  Moving closer to Steve, Kara gently placed one hand on his chest, let her bare leg brush his thigh. “We can do anything you want to do, or nothing at all,” she said. “And I’m in no hurry.”  She looked at Steve with clear eyes that held a sense of playfulness. It was her job to read people, and so far she’d read Steve exactly right.
“We weren’t able to clean up the video, but I was able to pull the energy signatures from around the hanger,” Bruce starts. He throws up video from his tablet and slows down the footage of Peter entering the room.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says into his hair, holding him close. “I’m sorry I made you do it, but I had to.” Steve nods against his shoulder and Tony curls them on their side, letting Steve fall apart in his arms.
Times were different and men were different now, and the hard set of his jaw sometimes felt like a mask.  The mask was starting to slip off more, but what worried Steve was why he found himself scrambling to keep it on.
“Is it cute snoring? Or like the loud, smother-him-with-a-pillow snoring?” Nat’s voice drifted up to him as he reached their table.
Still drowsy from his nap, Peter parks himself in Tony’s lap, chewing on the ear of the bear Steve managed to dig up.
“It’s ok, relax,” he mumbles. Tony keeps his hands on Steve’s shoulders and decides to focus on just his neck. He puts all his weight into his thumbs, kneading them up and down Steve’s neck, till he’s pressing his forehead into the pillow, arching up into Tony’s touch.
“Easy,” he says and straddles Steve again. He takes a deep breath, tries to control the trembling in his own hands before touching Steve. Like the night before, Tony starts by running his hands up and down Steve’s spine, pressing his thumbs into flesh till he feels Steve deflate beneath him. He keeps going, paying attention to the minute shifts in Steve’s breath, the twitches and flinches as Tony hits on a particular sore or sensitive spot.
For anyone else, it would be a cue to leave Steve alone, but Tony’s never known a boundary he didn’t want to leap over. He knocks loudly on the bathroom door, calling Steve’s name until he hears a muffled “What!”
He stood up from the sofa and stared at him, to see if Steve would break. When he didn’t, Tony moved to get ready for bed.
There are a few ticks that Steve has--tiny little tells that it took Tony years to figure out--and one is the slight flaring of his nostrils when he’s really upset. He does it now and Tony takes pity on him. He waggles his fingers and Steve takes the hint, curling their hands together.
Tony dims the lights, slips off his shoes and props himself up next to Peter, who immediately snuggles into his side. They read Where the Wild Things Are, Tony’s voice dropping naturally into the rhythm of the words. Peter’s attention is rapt and he giggles when Tony uses his monster voice and there’s a soft blossoming of warmth inside his chest, unlike anything Tony’s ever experienced before. Tony knows about love, has fallen in and out of it a few times in his life, but this is something deeper, something unswayable. He’s always been protective of Peter, felt admiration and pride at watching him grow, but feeling the soft rise and fall of his chest so close to him makes his heart ache in a different way. Makes him wonder how anything he’s ever done for Peter could be enough.
“I get scared too.” He looks up at Steve with an almost unbearable earnestness. “I was scared last night, but then Mr. Stark let me sleep next to him.”
It’s not so terrible, he thinks. If he has to go, at least he’s going surrounded by people he loves.
“I’m surprised you guys made it through the first night unscathed,” Natasha said. “My money’s on one of you leaving  after the third night.”
“It was just me and my mom,” Steve says. He cuts up Peter’s chicken, and pushes the juice glass slightly of spilling range. “Sometimes Bucky too, but it was nice.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, though he doesn’t really know what he’s apologizing for. Maybe for not following Steve’s orders or maybe that two people have the misfortune of loving him this much. He presses Steve’s hand to his lips, thinks about Steve taking his uniform, soaked with Tony’s blood, down to the incinerator.  How, after carrying him through the woods, Steve’s hands and skin would’ve been slick and tacky enough to make him sick.
“How is he?” Steve is waiting for him when he tiptoes out of the bedroom, putting the sofa cushions back in place.
“How did this happen?” Steve paces the length of the large living area Tony’s commandeered as his own private space.
But that was the image, not the man. No one could be that upstanding all the time and Steve was human, with feelings and flaws and desires, something Tony liked to remind him of from time to time.
“Is it?” For a long moment, neither of them speak. “Should it be?” Tony asks again and Steve shakes his head, looking again at Peter. There’s no easy answer here, nothing either of them can do but hold the reality they have in their hands.
He settled on Die Hard 2 and watched propped up on a few pillows while Steve lay flat on the bed.  “Is this the one in the tower?” Steve yawned again, his voice coming from beside Tony’s waist.
He manages a few hours of distraction before finally giving up the ghost, his lab a shamble of half-started projects. Steve’s kept his location on private, so Tony doesn’t go looking for him, for once willing to respect his boundaries.
“Always,” Tony said. He reached up, straightened Steve’s tie, and led them out to meet the rest of the world.
“Good,” Tony says and does it again, rubbing until Steve’s breathing heavier. “Let it feel good, OK?”
In the mornings, Steve and Tony do their own awkward dance, negotiating space and boundaries that somehow seem more important in the light of day.  Neither of them are good sleepers, but Steve usually wakes first, slipping out from under Tony’s arm before he can object.  He goes for a run and showers, coming out of the bathroom just as Tony’s waking up.
He gives himself a few minuets of panic, of anger and a little bit of fear, before he gets up from the table and grabs Peter, who is in mid run, hoisting him up into the air and shaking him silly before dropping him again.
The team takes to having a child around not just seamlessly, but with barely concealed joy. There’s anxiety sure —Peter not being Peter is cause for concern—but the four-year-old version of Peter is too cute to resist. After Sam’s done hurling him up in the air, Tony gets him dressed and ready for Natasha to take him down to the simulation room.
Pushing up his sleeves, Tony watched as Kara moved her mouth over Steve’s.  They’d only been kissing for a few minutes and he could already see the bulge growing in Steve’s pants. While her mouth worked, her hands wandered across his body, stroking his face, rubbing his thigh. Still, Steve was stiff, his body coiled as he processed all her touches, unsure if he wanted to give into or fight the sensations. And he still had on too many clothes, a clear barrier for what they wanted to accomplish.
Kara gasped as Tony continued to rub his thumb along her clit, sending shivers of pleasure through her body. Finally, Steve pulled her panties all the way down and placed his mouth between her legs.
“Peter, I need to talk to you about tomorrow,” he says after they’re back from watching Steve and Natasha practice hand to hand. Peter looks up from his drawing, a series of stick figures Tony can’t quite get a good look at it.
At this point, he was alright with anything. “Yeah,” he nodded, already trying to keep his hips still.
“There’s no trail, nothing that I can detect that says this might be some kind of magic. Plus, who would want to do this?”
Tony changes his own clothes but stops short of getting in to bed. In the living room, Steve is still on the sofa, eyes shut. He opens them when he senses Tony hovering.
“Not yet,” Tony says, not sure how much longer they can hold him off. He’s Steve to them, but to the rest, he’s Captain America, a highly valued government asset.
Peter nods, but he keeps one hand curled tightly around Tony’s fingers, so Tony stays with him, running his free hand through Peter’s hair until his breath evens out and his grip goes slack.
“Yeah, read it now!” He scrambles down from his chair and up into Steve’s lap. Tony clears the dishes and pours another cup of coffee, listening as Steve beings the tale of a little llama, just waiting, waiting for his mama.
“Come for me,” Tony says again and Steve shuts his eyes tight and arches up off the bed, body jerking violently before he comes with a long, strangled cry.
Tony’s head snaps up and Ross looks like he’s going to protest, but Steve stops him with a glare.  “We don’t send anyone out on solo missions, Secretary.”  It’s a lie. Steve flies solo all the time.
“Hi,” she said again, smiling wide and bright, like she’d just heard a joke. She was classically beautiful, her dark eyes small but piercing, and if she knew who they were she didn’t let on. Like Tony said, they were very discreet.
He takes a deep breath and straddles Steve’s hips, careful to keep his own weight on his knees and heels. He places both hands on Steve’s hips, before firmly pushing them up his side. Steve lets out a loud exhale at the sensation and Tony does it again, using more pressure this time, and digging in his thumbs. He presses them all the way up Steve’s back, trying to loosen the thick ligatures of muscle.
The comment stung but Tony only nodded, letting the disappointment build in his chest.  They hadn’t talked about any of this, hadn’t set any boundaries or even any expectations. It was stupid to feel slighted, so Tony gathered up his emotions and locked them up tightly. It was just sex. Which was fine. Just fine.
“I’m fine now,” Tony says, rubbing Peter’s back and letting him break down just a little. “I’m alright,” he whispers into the boys hair. “I’m always going to be alright.”
Tony is terrible at guessing ages, the kid looks to be about three, maybe four. “Do you know who I am?”
“I think this is my cue to head out,” Tony said softly beside him. Before he could move, Steve gripped his hand tightly, looking at him with a mix of arousal and panic.
“Baby,” Tony whispers, petting his face, watching the spill of white. His breathing is harsh and ragged, his eyes rough and watery and he buries his face in Tony’s neck, body heaving with effort. “It’s ok,” Tony says, their hips still rocking together, slick with come and sweat. Steve finds his mouth and kisses him again, this time more desperate than before, his sticky fingers digging into Tony’s side, great swallows of air ejecting from his lungs.
Steve groans in frustration and tries to still his hips, hands gripping the metal arms of Tony’s desk chair. With care, Tony undoes Steve’s belt and tugs down his zipper, providing just a little bit of relief. The head of his dick is already poking out of the opening of Steve’s pale blue boxers, a site that, even in this weird, fucked up scenario, sends a jolt of desire through him. He reaches between Steve’s legs, thumbs the wet head of Steve’s dick, feels it already sticky with precome.
Unable to help himself, Tony places a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “That’s not important right now,” Tony says. “You’re back, Steve. That’s all anyone cares about.” He knows SHIELD will come asking for details, the UN World Council too, but they’ll have to go through him first.
The first time it happens, it’s a mess of torn clothing and brutal kisses. One minute they’re in the communal kitchen, weary but victorious after an Avenger mission, and the next, Steve is pushing him across the floor and onto the couch, kissing him breathless.  Or, he thinks that’s how it happened. Maybe he made the first move, he’s still not exactly sure.  They didn’t fuck exactly, not right there in the den where anyone could’ve walked in, but Tony had torn the button off of Steve’s jeans and wedged a hand down his pants, stroking him roughly until he bit Tony’s coller bone and came with a muffled groan.  In return, Steve worked him expertly with a deft turn of his wrist until he came all across Steve’s navy blue sweater.
It gets a half smile from Steve. “I wasn’t the problem.” He pauses for a second, and Tony tugs at his hand to urge him on.  “I think Peter had a hard time.”
“Can I have juice,” Peter asks, already drowsy. He nuzzles into Tony’s neck, like he’d be happy just settling here for the night.
“Good,” Tony says. He brushes his thumb over Steve’s knuckles, which are still red and swollen.   “It’s creepy to have you watch me while I sleep.”
“What do you mean, ‘what am I doing?’ I’m trying to survive the last few hours of this never ending conference so we can all go home. That’s all I’m trying to do.”
“What are you doing, Tony?” Sam looked weary and annoyed, and Tony wondered just how much Steve had told him.
He’d been conspiratorial about it, had gently nudged Steve in this direction for days, and now here there were, inside a tastefully appointed, perfectly lit suit with a small sitting room in one corner and a large bed in the middle.
“Stark, calm down.” Fury is as steady as ever, leaning back on Bruce’s sofa. “We’re asking for a debrief is all. We need to know what he remembers and what he doesn’t. That’s it. No one is interested in harassing him.”
Tony sighs, remembering that the kid is too young and too soft-hearted for his own good.  “Shit,” he mutters. “Where is he? Can I see him?”
Tony had long ago been rendered immune to the charms of fancy dinners but it was nice to see it again through Peter’s eyes. It was part of the reason he’d brought Peter along. They still couldn’t tell anyone he was Spider-Man but he would eventually have a hand in running the Avengers. It was important to Tony he learn both sides of the superhero business.
“Neither,” Tony says, finally moving his feet. He’s been hovering for the better part of 10 minutes. Waiting and watching as Steve pounds the shit out of a punching bag. Sweat drips down his back, creating a long, damp V where his shirt sticks to his skin. A few days ago, there was a good chance that Steve was dead. Right now, you wouldn’t be able to tell that a single thing was wrong with him. At least not from the outside.
“Yes, it is. You thought she was flirting with me and you flipped out.” Steve stood up and laid his hands on his hips. His voice was calm but his posture demanded an answer.  “Why?”
“Well, he’s keeping tabs on your vitals,” Steve says. The bed shifts slightly as Steve settles down next to him and pushes a hand through his hair, petting him lightly.  “Bruce said he hacked into your medical chart a few times already.”
“Oh god.” Tony chuckles and carries Peter back to his bedroom. He wakes a little as Tony puts him under the covers.
Tony collapsed against him and Steve held him up with is arms. They were both sticky and wet, but Tony wasn’t inclined to move just yet.  He rested his head on Steve’s shoulder, gaze falling into the living room.
He’s losing control now, everything spilling out and over. With eyes filled with longing, he looks at Tony and begs.
“You look fine,” Tony says, blinking back sudden tears. “Expected a few more bullet wounds or something. At least make the rescue opp worth our while.”
There’ll be a next time. It’ll be a roll of the dice as to who it will be, maybe Peter, maybe Steve, maybe him again. For now, Tony pushes the thought out of his mind, and takes what he has. The three of them, safe and together. Hurting, but not alone.
“Peter,” he whispers. This time, Peter lets him take him by the shoulders. “You know I can’t promise it’s not going to happen again.” Peter’s face crumbles and Tony’s own voice starts to shake. “I can’t. I want to. Believe me, I want to so badly but I can’t. You know the stakes, you know this is part of the gig.”
“We can’t hold them off any longer, Tony. I don’t want to put him through this either but either we do this our way, or they’re gonna do it their way, and trust me, their way isn’t going to be easy.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, charmed by the bright shade of red Steve is turning. A hint of a genuine smile crosses Steve’s face and Tony’s tempted, briefly, to lean in and kiss him. He doesn’t though, and let’s Steve get on with his morning.
“Side by the door’s mine,” he mumbled as Steve yanked him up. He patted Steve on the shoulder and stepped into the washroom, shutting the door firmly behind him.
“You’re good with Peter,” Steve says, sliding next to him in bed that night. They rarely ever go to sleep at the same time, one or the other of them either on a mission or stuck in the lab or simply not tired. “He’s a good kid,” Tony replies pulling Steve a little closer. This thing between them has been going on long enough that it is no longer new, but Steve’s stomach still flips as Tony slides a hand up his shirt and captures his mouth.
It’s only when Sam and Nat push their chairs away from the table that Peter jumps out of his lap. He runs over to his little desk, and picks up his stack of drawings.
Tony stays till he’s asleep, and stares too long at the broken, bruised body in front of him. His own exhaustion is catching up to him, but it’s not time to rest, not yet. They still have work to do.
He thinks about the room Peter usually sleeps in when he’s here, all the way at the other end of the residence wing. “How about you bunk with me tonight?” Tony says. “That way I can make sure you don’t run off and break into the fridge for more juice.”
“I thought I had pieces of it but I only remember trees and dirt,” he shakes his head helplessly, starting to get worked up.
“That’s not the deal here,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand but moving it off him. “This isn’t a quid pro quo situation.”
Peter isn’t waiting for them when the light dissipates. There’s a large empty space where he should be and Tony almost faints.
There’s a flood of questions. What does he remember—”some things but not everything”—what did it feel like—”like being underwater”—does he feel sick, hungry tired—”no, no and yes”.
“You’re going to have to move me,” Tony says. Steve nods again, his face grim, and pushes a hand through Tony’s hair.
Tony is in his lab, elbow deep in upgrades to the Spider suit, when FRIDAY overrides his Do Not Disturb protocol for the second time in 20 minutes.
I would be fine if this is all there was, he thought, letting his eyes drift close. Just the two of them in a dimly lit room, sitting close together on a sofa.  As much as he had rejected the idea before, he craved the hint of closeness Tony was offering him now.
He was dressed to go out, his daytime suit replaced with dark slacks and a cream button down shirt with just one too many buttons open.  If he was surprised to see Tony squatting in a room that wasn’t his, he didn’t show it. “Did you get kicked out?” he asked. “I had you getting kicked out the first night, honestly. Nat has you getting kicked out on night two.”
“What are the risks?” Steve looks between them. From the living room there’s another burst of laughter as Peter clambers up and over the back of the sofa. With Scott’s help, he goes up, tumbles down and the two repeat the cycle.
“I don’t care that she flirted with you,” he said finally.  He could feel the lie through his body, was sure Steve saw it too. He looked down at his hands instead of meeting Steve’s eyes. “I just didn’t want us getting caught up in what was clearly a military operation.” When he looked up, Steve was still starring at him, mouth in that same stern line.
“I’m not trying to hurt him. I’m trying to keep him from getting hurt. That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.” Tony looked down at his shoes, his heart aching at the memory of that brief, crestfallen look on Steve’s face.
For once, he doesn’t run when Tony walks in, just scrubs his hand through his shower damp hair, and stares at his feet.
It would be tempting to run to the lab, to bury himself in the things he thinks he has control over but even he’s not that big a coward. There are a few last minutes things to take care of—modify the suit, create back ups of back ups incase something truly catastrophic happens, clear out the hanger in case of fire—but he knows the team will take care of that.
They had been through all kinds of missions together, spent hour after hour sequestered together in the compound or on the QuinJet, and yet Tony had difficulty recalling if the two had ever been alone together like this, in the quiet end of a day.
“You look nice,” he says, catching Tony totally off guard. “I mean, your suits are always nice, but the tux is a good look on you. You look handsome.”
After, lying in a mess of wrinkled, damp sheets, Tony rolls on top of him and cradles Steve’s face between his hands, placing errant kisses along his brow and temple.  He whispers soft endearments as they both come down, chests slick with sweat and pressed together. The words still make Steve blush, though he loves hearing them.
The sight of it makes his cock give a weak twitch, and he knows that if he hadn’t already come twice, he’d get hard again at the sight. Shifting slightly, he runs one shaky hand up along Tony’s covered thigh.
“Not yet,” he says, and flips Steve over so he’s on his back, erection pointed rudley at the ceiling. Tony’s own erection is straining his briefs but he ignores it and spreads Steve’s legs wider apart. He works his thumbs into the soft flesh around Steve’s hips and thighs, making a fist and pushing his knuckles into the dense tissue that’s rock hard from the thousands of squats Steve surely does. It makes Steve groan and arch his back, his dick making pathetic little thrusts into thin air. He wants to come and Tony’s tempted to let him, but not yet, not till he pushes just a little further. Tony trails a hand up Steve’s chest, and flicks his thumb across Steve’s nipple, making him gasp.
“Well I appreciate that, thank you.” Tony yawns, everything from yesterday coming back in a rush. He turns to his side, lifting his arm from under the covers. “Do you remember your mom, buddy?’
Steve obliges and groans, pushing slowly inside her. She feels so good, a tight, wet heat he hasn’t felt in ages, and wraps her legs around him, driving deeper.
“Nothing,” Tony said. “I honest to god thought you’d be a naked sleeper is all. Like, maybe that super solider serum keeps you running hot.” He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
Steve lets out a sound that’s something between a whimper and a cry, his hands gripping at Tony’s waist again. The sweat and lube between them creates a nice, slick surface and Tony keeps rutting on Steve, letting the head of his dick slide between the perfect V of his hips, while Steve bucks up into him, desperate for more touching, more friction, more something.
Steve had never been what you would call gregarious, but he never had a hard time expressing himself, at least not before the serum. He was sensitive by nature, as good with words as he was with his drawing pencils. His mother liked to say he wore his heart on his sleeve. Bucky, out of a desire to keep his best pal from getting beat up, would just shake his head and murmur, “You got a lousy poker face, Steve.”
Steve groaned his name again, rutting faster against his thigh, as Tony’s fingers began to skim along the waistband of his pants. “When the ambassador from Latvia touched you,” Steve started to say something but Tony cut him off by cupping him through his underwear.  His briefs were damp with precome and Tony cursed at the heat of it in his hand, losing his train of thought before finding it again. “When she touched you, I lost it. I got jealous. Why should she get to touch something when I couldn’t.”
He whites out for a second, his own pleasure mixing with Tony’s as he thrusts a few more times before coming with his own sharp cry.  In his haze he finds Tony’s mouth and kisses him again, fingers curling through damp hair.  Their are words that want to claw their way out of his throat, but he finds himself so lost, so unmoored, he has no idea where to start. But this time, when Tony looks deep into his eyes Steve doesn’t turn away.
“Oh god, oh fuck Tony,” he’s practically begging but Tony pays him no mind. “Can I take these off?” he asks and Steve grunts out an affirmative, pushing at Tony’s underwear. He kicks it off and lines their cocks up together, almost passing out himself from the pleasure.
“It means you’re right. We do things as a team. Come on, we’re gonna eat lunch and then your Aunt May is coming over.”
Tony swallows past the sudden tightness in his throat, relief and anger mixing in a ball in his stomach. They had been searching for Steve for over a week, after he’d failed to check in during a routine surveillance mission. For 8 days, they’d crisscrossed the area where Steve’s transponder had last pinged, searching for some sign that he wasn’t dead.
“It’ll work,” he says, so sweetly, so sincerely, that Tony almost kisses him right then. Not because he believes Steve but because Steve so clearly, desperately also wants to believe it.
“Shit,” Tony says, looking at the clock. It’s half past four. Even though ever second away from Peter is a second spent helping him, Tony still feels like a neglectful heel.
“I made this,” he says and shuffles through the stack he’s been working on for the past two days. He hands the first one to Sam, beaming. “See, this is me, and you’re helping me fly.”
They fly back in silence, until it’s time to land. Sam slaps him on the back, and Natasha gives Rhody a squeeze, and they school their expressions into neutrality as they step off the plane, trying to forgot what they’ve seen.
Peter nods, his expression blank. “She died. In a crash.” He marches the Black Widow figure over to Tony, making her crawl across his arm. The Hulk one he makes stomp across the bed.
He lingered in the doorway till Steve stepped aside. The small foyer led to a larger living room connected to a small kitchen, with three large windows along the west side, offering a nice view of downtown D.C.  The place was cozy in a way that the compound would probably never be.  He wasn’t sure how often Steve came back here, but understood why he kept it. It was his place, and his alone. Somewhere free of the Avengers.
“Cap told you on the radio not to go out there alone! That we didn’t know what kind of weaponry they had. You went out there and got shot up. You almost died.”
“That’s good, Steve,” Tony whispers, curling his fingers back into the hair at the nape of Steve’s neck. The touch grounds him, keeps him in place. “You’re being so good for me.”
Tony smiles through his clenched jaw and jams his hands into his pockets, out of fear of what they might reach out and touch. Next to him, Dr. Cho fiddles with an IV on Steve’s arm. “I would urge you not excite Captain Rogers too much,” she says, her voice was soft yet firm. “We’re still running tests, just to be safe.” She shuts the door on her way out, leaving them alone.
There’s an unmistakable waiver in Peter’s voice and Tony feels an urge to pat his hand, tell him everything’s going to be fine but the words get stuck in his throat.
“Tony,” he’s gasping now, as Tony makes his touch lighter, more soothing. He moans, dropping his head again and lifting his hips and spreading his legs. “Tony, please,” he pleads and Tony gives in easily.
“Is that what this is about?” Tony asks quietly, the pieces sliding into place. “Are you mad at me for getting hurt? There were lives on the line, Peter. I did what I thought had to be done.”
“You’re telling me.” Tony smiles. He’s been in Steve’s spot before, has done more than his fair share of hospital vigils over the past few years. It’s always harder to be the person waiting by the bed than to be the person in bed. The slump of Steve’s shoulders, the slight tremor in his voice telegraph that he’s spent a few days sleepless and scared.  “You should get some sleep,” he says, even though he knows Steve won’t listen.
Tony shook his head before realizing Steve couldn’t see him. “No, no that wasn’t” he said, heart sinking a little as Steve gathered up his clothes. From his bed, he watched Steve pull on his underwear and pants, hunt around for his shirt.  “You know you can stay here,” Tony offered but Steve shook his head.
In the dark, Tony can feel and smell more than he can see the mess Steve makes, and he strokes him through it slowly, teasing, using just his finger tips, until Steve comes down fully.
The serum had changed everything, and somewhere along the line, he had become serious and taciturn, saying only what needed to be said. It was born out of necessity he thought.  If the Army had taught him anything, it was that the less you spoke, the more men respected you.
“I can’t,” he gasps, sweat dripping down his face. “God, Tony I want to, believe me, I want to, but I can’t.”
“Boss, there’s suspected use of alien weaponry happening in a remote region on the western Canadian prairie. Satellite imagery shows radiation readings that are well off the normal range.”
From the counter, he pumps a little lotion into his hand, slicking his palm and finger tips. Steve’s eyes are shut tight. Tony watches his own reflection in the mirror before fixing his eyes on the sharp wing of Steve’s shoulder blade. With his slick palm, he takes Steve in his hand again, this time making a lose fist around the length and stroking slowly.
True to what Tony thought, Kara was slow about it, and took her time, trailing kisses down Steve’s chest, sucking at his nipples, at his hip bones, before finally reaching over his pants and cupping his erection. Steve moaned like he was in pain, bit Tony’s lip, and thrust his hips, just once, into her touch.
Tony spent a long time staring into the fire and thinking about Steve’s question before doing what he usually did when he felt out of sorts. He went to see Peter.
of his fists filling the room. Even without FRIDAY’s assistance, Tony had known this is where he would find him, even at this late hour.
“Tony, please,” Steve begs and Tony curls all the way around him, hands tangled in his hair and bites at his lip. He uses his knee to push Steve’s leg farther apart, weighing him down till there’s no space between them.
“Then stop doing dumb shit,” Natasha snapped. “Steve didn’t come back with us, you know that? He’s not at the compound Tony.”
“Nothing’s going on.” Nothing had happened that Tony wasn’t willing to bury forever, but Sam didn’t buy it.
Steve arched up into his touch, shoulders pushing against the door, and his hips made small, frantic little thrusts into Tony’s hand. He still had him cupped through cotton but it didn’t matter, Tony could feel how hard he was, how much precome he was leaking.
“You know he’s not OK. What he went through...that kind of trauma doesn’t just leave a person.” Bruce stops, makes Tony look at him. “I don’t remember a lot when I’m the Hulk, but when I come back to being me, I can still sense it. It’s all still inside me, Tony. Just because Steve can’t remember what happened doesn’t mean he can’t still feel it.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t visit you,” Peter says, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie  “I wanted to but…”
He runs Peter a bath in the giant tub he never uses. He fills it to the top with bubbles and hot water and throws as many toys as Peter asks for. In the end, it’s just a soup of brightly colored plastic bobbing between stiff, soapy peaks.
Tony had never seen him like this before, this undone, and his own breath quickened, his pulse racing at the sight of a clearly turned on Steve Rogers.  Kara tipped her mouth back over his, and pressed him back slightly into the sofa. Tony indulged himself and let his fingers stroke Steve’s chest, brushing against his nipple.
She smiled, dipped her head and began to kiss the underside of his jaw until Steve gasped and pulled back. She let out a light laugh and crossed one of her legs over Steve’s thigh.
“Why aren’t you locking your doors?” Tony sat on the edge of the bed and watched as Peter punched at the buttons on his Switch. His room was much smaller, barely large enough for a bed, but it had the same big window and great view.
“It didn’t bother me the she was flirting with you,” Tony said after they’d polished off the pizza and he'd brushed the crumbs off his hands. “Well, it wasn’t the only thing.”
“You and Peter were offline for 20 minutes. You both came back beat to shit. The kid needed 3 hours in a hyperbaric chamber to restore his lung function.”
There’s a moment before they step off the elevator that Steve thinks about saying something banal, something like
“What if I don’t think this was a mistake?” Steve said. His eyes were warm and hopeful, and the expression in his face crushed Tony even more. Steve reached out for his hand but Tony shook him off and fled to the bathroom, shutting the door firmly behind him. He turned on the shower and stood under the spray for a long time, coming out only after he was certain Steve had left the room.
Peter nods but he doesn’t look convinced and Tony hates seeing his face so somber. A subdued Peter is an unhappy Peter, and that’s never sat will with him, no matter what age Peter is.
“Exhausted,” Tony says, delighting in flopping down on the sofa just set to right. “Terrified. Probably still trying to convince myself this is some crazy dream.” He scrubs his hands through his hair, realizing its the first time all day they’ve been alone. “Thank you for doing all that stuff earlier. The clothes and the toys,”
Tony turns his head, places a gentle kiss on the side of Steve’s face. “He won’t,” he whispers. “Nothing’s gonna happen to me.”
“They’re not hookers Rogers, they’re escorts. Or sex workers. Things have changed, there’s no shame in it. No one is under duress,” he said. “Just take the edge off a bit, get some practice. See what you like.”
“There were a lot of voices.” His voice cracks, the strain of trying to remember already taking its toll.
Tony can’t help his own frown that finds its’ way onto his face. “It’ll be okay, pal. I’ll be better before you know it, okay? Don’t have too much fun without me, boys.” He says the last part mostly to Steve with a small smile. Steve manages to hold Peter in his left arm against his side and tucks Tony back in with his right arm.
Steve frowns. "I haven't seen my boyfriend in..." He ponders for a brief second. "Since Friday night!" He almost exclaims when he realizes. "Since Friday, Tones."
Peter nods, resting his head on Steve’s chest. He squirms in Steve’s arms until he finds a comfortable position, kicking Steve in the sternum lightly in the process. “Yeah, Daddy, it’ll make him feel bett’r.”
But an hour later when Peter falls asleep against his side and Tony falls asleep with his head in Steve’s lap, snoring so softly with a hand clutching Steve’s sweatshirt, well, that’s the only explanation he needs.
"Steve. I appreciate what you're trying to do," Tony calmly states, wiping his hand across his cheek while smearing grease in the process. "I understand you think I am going to have a heart attack down here with my abundance of caffeine and no sleep or whatever, but I am
Tony cups one of Steve’s cheeks and runs his thumb along the sculpted cheekbone. Steve’s face is etched with anxiety and yet he is a work of damn art. He watches Steve swallow thickly and places his hand over Tony’s on his cheek.
“Can we sleep yet, Rogers?” Tony inquires with sleepy frustration as Steve takes the rag to Tony’s face one more time.
The rest of the team hands off gifts one by one, Tony is pleased with all of them. Each year, they seem to get more creative. Tony assumes Steve wants to give him his gift alone; that’s been the routine the past few years.
“You were trying to distract me from a racing heart and sweaty skin with thoughts of things that induce a racing heart and sweaty skin? That doesn't really hold water, even for a guy walking off sixty-odd years of brain freeze. I think your distraction for me was just an excuse for you.” Oh please let it be an excuse. Pretty please, with sprinkles on top.
patient, Steve. Hell, if patience is a virtue, I’m in line for sainthood. I’ve been waiting for you to get with the program since you sauntered onto that damned hellicarrier. Listening to you telling me to put on the suit when all I wanted to do was rip yours off.” Tony lets his hands trace over Steve's body with abandon - making up for lost time.
So, Steve’s lashes weren’t the only thing to survive the size purge. Tony’s eyes drop low, and his thoughts, and his blood supply, obviously thinking this is a good idea, follow suit.
Lifting his mug, Clint shakes his head. “Coffee and oysters? Not a great mix.” He starts backtracking, his cheeks on fire. “You enjoy, though. Sorry about the, ah, well, you know.”
Tony pushes Steve back, grinning as he falls on his ass and his back thuds against the wall of the lift, soft strands of hair flopping down over his forehead. Tony surges forward, climbs onto Steve, and seats himself on ridiculously thick thighs.
“Nothing you can see.” Tony takes the germy playground to the high powered magnifier nestled amongst his other shiny toys. He slides the tissue into place, and sends the holographic display projecting toward the couch. He fiddles with the controls as he calls to Steve. “Tell me, step by step, everything you remember about last night.”
"I know," Clint said. "I know exactly how that feels and the worst part is that fear is never going to go away." Natasha tensed. "I feel that all the time for Laura; for the kids; for
"Tell Director Fury that Protocol Charlie-Alfa-Lima-Alfa-Seven-Too-Too has been activated. I repeat Protocol Charlie-Alfa-Lima-Alfa-Seven-Too-Too has been activated. Over."
Deciding he had spent enough time thinking for that morning, Steve carefully shut the compass, pulled himself out from under the warmth of the blankets, and walked over to the kitchen. On his way there, the stack of S.H.I.E.L.D. files sitting on the small dining table caught his attention. He had a lot of catching up to do and sadly it was seeming more and more like these files were only the tip of the iceberg.
"I find that unlikely," Natasha said. "Then there were so many things in her story that just seemed too convenient or even blatantly contradicted themselves. She said took a motorcycle to New Mexico but didn't explain how she acquired it. Fury seemed to know where she was going before she even did – to which I'll say Fury is good, but he's not

"Yeah," Tony remarked, digging one of his finger nails into the grooves of the denim. "TBD sounds good."
could be heard all over the place and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents could be heard shouting orders. Steve looked at Bruce, thinking he might have a possible explanation for this, but the scientist looked just as puzzled as he was.
"No," Pepper answered for Tony again. "And I've been urging him to all week." In all honesty, Tony knew he couldn't defended himself. He ignored his symptoms or just assumed they'd get better on their own. So, he just accepted the angry/concerned "why-don't-you-take-better-care-of-yourself" look Pepper was giving him and waited for the doctor to ask her next question.
"I don't like any of them." Tony straightened out his clothes as he prepared to go out and face the public again. Pepper looked a little annoyed as she stepped forward to stand beside Tony and did her own final checks as well. "What can I say? I have high standards. You should know about that, right?"
After a few more minutes of waiting, the blacked-out doors finally opened. Through it stepped an older man wearing a long white robe. He was accompanied by a pair of women. Both were wearing white coveralls with a red stripe running down the center. The man looked Carol up and down, as if he was assessing her. She did him the same courtesy.
"Because I've hit hard times before," Carol said. "And I would have given anything for someone – even a complete stranger – to just ask me that one question."
"Alright, I have paper in front of me right now," Charles explained. "And in my left hand, there's a pen. If I asked you a more detailed question, would you be able to take control of my hand and write down your answer?" Marx gave a curt nod and Charles found himself pulling his hand away from the shard and looked down at the paper in front of him. Written in his neat, cursive handwriting at the top of the page was a simple question: "What would you like to know?"
In the Eastern Orthodox religion, they celebrate Christmas on January 7th. I'm not entirely sure of the reasons why I think it has something to do with their calendar being different. No one in my family is Eastern Orthodox, but we do sometimes celebrate Christmas on this date because there are lots of us scattered across the country and for a lot of us it's easier to honor local commitments on Catholic Christmas and then come together on Orthodox Christmas to celebrate the holiday with our long-distance relatives (who, to be honest, are much nicer than my local relatives.) This year is no different, so while I'm celebrating, I just wanted to wish you all a happy holiday, even if you don't have this weird tradition as I do. Next time, we're getting into the real action!
"I spend all day holding back a twelve-hundred-pound smashing machine," Bruce explained. "This is nothing."
"Thanks," she said before she started slowly picking at her sandwich. It was silent for a while before she felt the need to speak up again. "You're not going to ask me what that was about?" Bruce shook his head.
"Well," she said in the most tutting of voices. "If that is the case, I hope you don't mind explaining that to the police."
"I know," she said. "And I have it noted down in your file, but I want to hear it from you live, face to face." Tony looked down and shrugged, trying to force the proper words to explain out of his mouth.
"Your work with the Tesseract is what drove Loki to it," Thor pointed out. "And his allies. It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war."
"I don't think I can be better," Stark muttered under his breath. "I've tried to be better, but I can't…" Carol knew that he didn't want her to hear that, but she did and wasn't going to let it slip by.
"What'd be even worse would be if the others were here, too," Stark said. "Steve, Romanoff, Bruce… Especially Bruce. If he were trapped here with us, we wouldn't have a chance."
Honestly, Steve wasn't sure what to make of Captain Danvers. He did feel indebted to her for finding Tony and getting him to safety during that whole debacle in D.C. However, at the same time, he questioned why she was not up front about her abilities from the get-go. Tony, he understood. He did not seem surprised by Carol's powers, so it was clear that he knew about them, but at the same time, when he last saw her, he was very heavily intoxicated. It was quite possible that Carol had demonstrated her powers to him and he wrote it off as an alcohol-induced hallucination. Conceivably, he could have known about it and not known at the same time, so Steve could easily give him a pass on that one.
"Well, given that you appear to have a more severe case," Rawls said. "The only other method of treatment would be managing the symptoms, which would be incredibly difficult. Why? Is there a problem?"
"Listen," he eventually said. "I know this is a hard time for both of us and me being impulsive doesn't help anything…"
The opening notes of "Shoot to Thrill" roused Tony from his light dose. He hadn't been able to sleep since Pepper left. Instead, he just laid there with his eyes closed waiting for his head to stop pounding. The pain did ease up a bit but had yet to fully cease. However, the sound of his ringtone playing brought a headache back full-force. Groaning, Tony felt around for the phone on the nightstand.
For example, she couldn't remember how she got the motorcycle she used to get to New Mexico. In one version of events, the guy just made some uncomfortable comments to her and she waited for him to go inside the store before taking his bike. In the other version, as soon as the words left his mouth, Carol punched him. She got the keys from him and sped off, leaving him in the dirt. Now, this was only a small detail, so nothing important was lost, but there were other things that held more of an importance that Carol was unsure of.
"Smart," Carol remarked. "So, is this what you wanted to talk to me about? Reassuring me that I'm not going to be locked away for a crime I could potentially commit?"
"You're right," she admitted. "If it's not an inconvenience to you, would you like to stay so we can work out the details?" The smile that came across Freeman's face was rather uncanny. Rather begrudgingly, Agent Morse stepped to the side so he could walk into the room.
"The CDC hasn't officially confirmed it yet," Bruce said. "But we have an idea and it's not looking good."
He was running up the hill, running to the farmhouse. He once again froze when he saw the sheer amount of destruction, his heart sinking, his universe collapsing. Continuing to follow the same pattern, he ran up to Natasha when he saw her sifting through the ruble. He said the same lines he said a thousand times, but this time something unexpected happened. He could hear her.
Part of this chapter is taken from New Avengers #14 by Brian Michael Bendis. All credit goes to him, but the person you probably want to behead for this is me. You know, seeing as I was too chicken to officially identify the character until the end.
Tony remembered leaving his tools out there after Steve came to get him to come to bed. Pushing the doors open, he was immediately greeted by a burst of cold air. Tony's skin prickled at the sensation as he was only wearing a tank-top and pajama pants made of a very thin material. The doors leading to the outdoor launch/landing pad were drafty and there wasn't much Tony could do about it without putting something in the way of the machinery. So, he would just have to suffer through the bitterly freezing January-in-New-York air for a few minutes while he got what he needed.
?" Tony winced a little bit. Just saying "no offense" didn't automatically make a comment non-offensive. Nevertheless, Tony graciously decided to let it go, mostly because he felt too horrible to think of a good comeback.
"All of that's great," Tony said. "But can we cut to your main reason here?" Pepper looked down for a second before centering her gaze back on Tony.
"Yes," he said. "My name is Anthony Stark and I'd like to report a potential public safety threat at 200 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan."
"One of your colleagues from Culver University," Hill said. "Dr. Elizabeth Samson. Do you know her?" Bruce looked down but nodded.
"Completely," Salinas agreed. "I had to throw out all of the food in my house just to be on the safe side."
Remember kids, follow the lockdown procedure. If you don't, the best thing that could happen is you get the stomach flu, and if this is bad I don't even want to imagine what COVID is like.
Tony was going to bend over to pick it up, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him. Looking back to his left, Tony's eyes met Steve's to find a worried look had completely fallen over them.
"Hell yeah, you did," she said. "The lobby's that way." She pointed back the way she came. "Didn't you hear Freeman when he told you to stop?"
"How so?" Bruce asked. Tony frowned. He tried to think of the proper words to explain it but came up empty. He felt everyone's eyes on him, and Steve's hand paused at his shoulder to give it a comforting squeeze.
"Alright then," Dr. Cranston said. "We don't have to dive right into it. We can take it slow." Tony raised an eyebrow at her phrasing but didn't say anything. "Don't worry. Like I said, first visits can be nerve-wracking. Talking to a stranger about everything that's bothering you is incredibly daunting. Would it help if maybe I told you a little about myself first?" Tony frowned.
"It's a possible complication of severe hypothermia," Wylie explained. "I wouldn't worry about it too much." Steve nodded, but was still concerned. "But no other symptoms, right? No dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, cardiac arrest, confusion, none of that?"
So, GOOD NEWS, I've already started on chapter twenty-eight. BAD NEWS, I've only written 177 words so far. GOOD NEWS, my next post-date isn't until November 22nd (Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson's Birthday.) BAD NEWS, I am currently sick, have two doctor appointments and lunch with my dad to go to between then and now, which may impede my ability to write. GOOD NEWS, stuff is actually going to happen next chapter, so when I do finish it we should be in a different place than we are now. BAD NEWS, you're going to get put through a wringer and probably hate me more. Gee, isn't this game fun!
"We'll wait for Clint to come back and try talking to the concierge again," she said. "If that doesn't work, we'll go back to our original plan. For right now, though I think it would do us all some good if we just take a moment to relax a bit." Steve was very aware of the pointed look she was shooting at him.
"I don't see how this is relevant to the conversation at hand." Pepper's attempt to get Schaffer to shut up was once again ignored.
"None of us were expecting it," Clint said. "Loki was such a wild card. Even I didn't know…" Clint's breathing hitched; a clear sign that he was flashing back to when he was under Loki's mind control. Natasha squeezed her arms tighter around him. Eventually, Clint found his voice and was able to finish his sentence. "Even I didn't know what he was going to do from one moment to the next."
Checking the caller ID, Bergeron noticed that the number was way too long to be coming from the United States. Hoping this was the break he'd been waiting for, Bergeron answered the phone.
"No, no," she said. "It's alright. You didn't hurt me. Are you okay?" Both of Lara's eyebrows shot up, almost reaching her hairline as she brought her gaze up to look at Pepper.
"I know where you can find an Infinity Stone!" Things went silent. Thanos removed his hand from Loki's neck and Loki took a deep, relieved breath.
"Of course, I do." Fury opened his mouth to say something, but Tony cut him off. "However, I'm not just going to hand this over to S.H.I.E.L.D. Not until I know what the hell this is about."
"Well, in any case, the most I can tell either of you is to sit tight. Hopefully, we'll get this all straightened out soon enough." Clint nodded and Stark made some noise of agreement as well. The doctor left without another word.
"We need to figure something out," Natasha said. "I get the feeling that the longer we let this go unaddressed, the more likely Stark is to do this again."
Tony scrambled out of the elevator and was relieved to find that the alarm seemed to be contained to that space. Without much thought, he headed for the staircase. After all, booze was more important than accountability, right? Obviously not, but Tony was too far out of it to realize that. He headed down the stairs, though in all honesty, he felt that he was going at far too slow a pace. However, it's not like he had a choice. It was his own incoordination that was throwing him off. He only had himself to blame for that.
"What do you want me to say, Pepper?" Tony asked. "I don't want to do it, but no one else can do it, so I
"Maybe they did back in the '40s," Tony said. "But nowadays we have something called 'having a good time.'"
"Come on in," the producer said. "Make yourselves comfortable. Miss Everhart will be ready for you in just a few minutes."
He ended up not confronting her. At least, he was not going to right away. He was not rude to her either. Instead, he acted like it was just another day and went through his normal routine. It was the safest way he could see going about the situation. Romanoff just went with the flow and fulfilled her duties as needed. For the most part, things went smoothly on that basis. That was until the board meeting started.
The nurses quickly went through the triage process. Upon checking his temperature, they found it went down 0.2 degrees. That was good, but Tony still wasn't out of the red yet. As soon as they were done, Tony wanted to go to sleep, but the doctor decided not to dawdle and arrived less than a minute after the nurses left. She was a redhead a few shades darker than Pepper who kept her hair tied back in a tight ponytail.
"Then why don't you do your job and let me do mine?" Pepper asked. "Unless, there's something else you need to tell me?" Freeman shook his head.
"A lot of people were," Coulson explained. "You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought Gamma Radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula."
Finally, some Steve! No Tony yet (well at least not in physical presence) but don't worry, he'll show up soon!
That was another good thing about going back to the tower. Tony and Steve could be as affectionate with each other all they like, and no one could say anything about it because it was Tony's building. If they didn't like it, they could leave, or Cabe could throw them out. Feeling a little more secure, knowing that fact, Tony leaned into the touch.
Yeah, some of this is so ideologically sensitive that I worried about whether or not I should change this from a T to an M, but this isn't the entire fic and I don't want people thinking that this is porn, so...
"He'll be fine," Fury assured. "Just let him rest and keep an eye on him. If you notice any unusual symptoms, take him to the Emergency Room right away and contact us." Natasha nodded.
"That's all that's worth mentioning right now," she said. "There are a few minor blips, but we can leave them alone for now."
Of course, this scene had changes to it. It was kind of obvious given that Tony/Pepper isn't a thing in this universe. Not that I have a problem with the Tony/Pepper pairing - I read fics about them all the time - but I just prefer Steve/Tony a little bit more. That being said, I hope I was able to cut back on the flirtiness between the two of them. As established in MHATRAR, although the two of them quickly failed as a couple, they still remain close friends and I hope that's what comes across here.
"You're sure they can't trace this or anything?" he asked. "I saw on TV once that police can trace phone lines. Do you think they'll be able to trace this?"
"Stark is missing." The room fell dead silent. A deadpan look came across Lara's face as she responded.
To be fair, she did warn Tony of this when she first started working for him. Obviously, she wasn't going to be making falling asleep on the job a habit, but she had been warned that he was infamous for staying up all night working (usually in his lab) and in case she had to accompany him in one of these all-nighters, she thought he should be warned. Tony didn't take her as seriously as he probably should have because the very first time she drifted off while working late with him, he ended up waking her abruptly and she punched him in the chest. Luckily, he wasn't too hurt, and he even took the blame for it. (
"You've got to be kidding me," he said. "The State of the Union Address? The whole reason we came down here in the first place?"
At a reasonable pace, the crowd filed out of the lobby. From the angle that the camera was pointing, it was hard to see people's faces, but Steve knew he would recognize Tony when he saw him. For a solid minute, they watched strangers pass through the hotel's front doors. Then, Steve's heart stopped. Tony came into frame and he wasn't alone. Two police officers were physically carrying him out of the building.
Tony struggled to keep his eyes open, but he knew it was pointless. The air was getting thinner and thinner. He may have thought to make his suits capable of deep-sea diving, but he never thought he would ever have to make them space-proof. The air was escaping quickly, and soon he would asphyxiate to death. That was alright, though. He had saved the Earth; saved Manhattan; saved Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy; saved Clint, Natasha, Bruce, and Thor; saved Steve… In the end, that was all that mattered to him. They would get to live out the rest of their lives safe. At that moment, that's all he wanted and all he could ask for.
However, he didn't pull up the flashlight app. Instead, he found himself opening his contacts and tapping on one of the few names contained within. The phone only rang twice before there was an answer.
Carol looked down as she tried to will thoughts of her own high score away. Smith turned her attention to Jessica.
"I want to be with you, Tony," Steve said. "What I'm asking is if you still want to be with me despite all of these fears?"
"That stuff he said about 'compulsive tendencies' and 'textbook narcissism.' Did I miss something there because I don't know what he was talking about?" Steve stopped in his tracks and did the best "are you kidding me" look he could give in the situation.
"Well, I think you just answered your own question there, Romanoff," Tony said. "It's alright though. SI has top-notch security and the NYPD is aware of the situation at this point."
"I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man." That was the truth of it. The few interactions he had with Agent Coulson were awkward at best, Steve could tell he was truly dedicated to the idea of helping and protecting people. That was enough in his mind to make the loss tragic. However, he could hear Tony scoff at that.
"I know what really happens to people who aren't mentally healthy," he said. "You can't promise me he's going to be okay when I'm not in there to protect him from what they could do." Pepper and Rhodey exchanged concerned glances.
"Yeah," Tony said once the faceplate snapped over his face and the HUD lit up in front of him. "I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the building's power levels. They should remain stable, but call me if the power goes out – either here or to the rest of the city, alright?"
It turned out to be a two-person job anyway. Steve was holding the countertop vertically. It was just a little bit taller than he was, so he couldn't see where he was going. At first, he tried walking backwards towards the door so he could turn and at least attempt to see where he was going, but that didn't really work out. Instead, Tony directed him around the furniture and over to the foyer area slowly, which went a lot more smoothly. Steve set the countertop down on the floor by the elevator carefully as not to cause another crash. Thankfully, he didn't drop it like Tony had and the two of them headed back into the office to move on to the next task.
"Alright." Adoniram clapped his hands together and sat down on the stool he'd been sitting on before. "Enough chit-chat. Let's get down to business. What do you have on the Avengers?" Adoniram locked eyes with Freeman, who tugged at the collar of his shirt.
"That's okay," Steve said. "I can work with this." He pulled the pad close to him and flipped it around, so it was horizontal. Somewhat hesitantly, Steve brought one of the pencils down to make his first mark on the page. He noticed right away that the pencil he was using felt harder and smoother than he was used to. However, he quickly adjusted and began drawing the scene that he had just seen moments before through the plane window. After a few moments of silence, Tony spoke up again.
"Absolutely nothing," she said. "The hotel called the police to break up a wild party and you somehow got caught up in the confusion. They threw you out by mistake."
"Please and thank you," Tony said. "Mostly just please." Tony could see the edges of Steve's frown rise into a soft smile.
He could feel something tight gripping his wrists. He tried to turn them just to be in a slightly more comfortable position but instead found that the leather straps were digging into his skin way too tightly. Pulling as hard as he could, Clint tried to do everything he could to break free of the restraints.
“Ouch, Cap, is that the first insult you’ve ever proclaimed? It needs work.” Tony quips, not looking up from whatever he’s working on.
While Peter has all of Tony’s personality, he is all Steve in his looks. He’s got bright ocean eyes, dirty blonde curls, Steve’s nose, and the same soft smile.
Tony pouts, frown in full force. “You never look that interested to hear me talk about sciencey things.”
Steve seems absolutely unphased by the whole ordeal, and if that doesn’t sum up parenthood, Tony doesn’t know what does.
Tony finishes his third mug of coffee, Steve has been counting, and looks around the kitchen. “Okay, Rogers, where’s my present?”
Steve and Peter pay for their items, Peter even helping Steve slide his credit card in a way that makes the cashier gush out loud, and Steve leads the two of them out of the grocery store, Peter still bundled up in his arms.
And with Peter being as much of a handful as he is, Steve understands how meaningful the idea of it all is.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Let me be sure to bring in the baby talk next time we’re in bed.” Tony sarcastically quips.
Steve sighs and lifts his head up to look at Tony. "I'm sorry. That - God, I don't even know what that was!" He looks defeated, almost embarrassed. Tony feels empathy wash over him.
And here’s the thing: Tony always thinks Steve is beautiful. Steve is beautiful after battles, after going for his morning jog, after sex, when he’s angry, and everything else under the sun.
“Are you surprised?” Steve refuses to move his head from Tony’s neck; instead, he just wraps his arms around Tony’s hips and contently leans against him.
“Yeah, Tones, looks like you’re outta luck.” Nat shrugs, sweeping a blonde lock of hair behind her ear.
"Tony," Steve says with a warning tone. "You know what I mean. When are you gonna come lay with me, hang out with the gang, literally anything that shows you kinda still like my company." He crosses his arms, defense mode in action.
Tony knows Steve is worried, whether it’s valid or not. “Why don’t you do Daddy and I a favor, little man – can you go into my office and bring me the tablet sitting there? Don’t run with it though, if ya drop it I’m selling your legos.” Tony jokes, Steve rolls his eyes. And yet, even Tony’s blatant sarcasm makes Peter grin with excitement as he dashes off to retrieve the tablet.
Steve reaches a hand up and cups one of Tony’s cheeks. “Is Pete ready to go?” His voice is so groggy and so sweet. Tony nods, placing his hand over Steve’s.
“Thank you, little man.” His voice seems to be getting weaker, Steve notes. Tony’s nose is bright red, he’s shivering slightly and has the sleeves of his sweatshirt pulled right over both his hands.
“I love you, dork,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s neck, his breath making Tony shiver slightly. This warmth, this closeness, the intimacy of someone knowing every inch of your soul – it’s unsurpassed. It’s everything. It’s the only reason Tony can wake up sometimes.
When he wakes up and reaches clumsily for his phone, he reads that it is 9:03 in the morning. And what the fuck? Unless the apocalypse happened over night, leading to both Tony and Pete’s death, there really is no logistical reason for the fact he has managed to sleep that late. Confused, he rolls out of bed, throwing on the first sweatshirt that’s lying on the floor along with sweatpants.
“When’s the last time you slept, ate?” Steve continues to pry. He inches closer, just slightly, just so he won’t scare Tony away.
"Um -- fuck, inhaler. Steve- Steve needs it." He doesn't even wait for Clint's answer as he sets his eyes on what he's looking for, right next to a bunch of bananas that have gone bad. He lunges for the inhaler and finds himself soaring down the stairs again toward Steve.
These days at Nat and Buck’s absolutely fill Tony’s heart. Seeing Bucky balance Peter in all sorts of ways: on top of his shoulders, on one shoulder, bouncing him on his knees at the table. Watching Natasha tickle Peter until he’s squealing, watching him fall asleep on her chest, soft breaths escaping his lips. Most importantly, something in Tony’s chest clenches when he sees Steve, passed out on the couch with his knees nearly tucked into his chest. It happens without fail every single time when they head to their friends’ house. Steve and Tony pawn their sweet baby over and Steve manages to always catch up on some extra sleep.
They also splay out a shirt that he refuses to wear, reading: “Tony Stark has been alive for 49 slutty years.” Whatever that means. He can’t help the giggle that slips out, nearly choking on a piece of pancake. When he’s quieted down, and looks to his right, Steve is staring at him like he’s the entire solar system.
“Not as much as I love you.” Tony states through the drowsiness in his voice. And he’s never meant something so much in his life.
“I –“ Tony tries to choke out, tears obviously blocking the way. He coughs, clearing his throat. He feels like he takes off the birthday hat in slow motion. “Fuck –” He all but manages. “God, yes. Yeah, I’ll marry you.”
“Oh. Yeah, bubblegum medicine.” Steve plays along, and when Peter can’t see, holds up Tylenol and cough drops.
He’s back to Tony’s side, crouching down to gently rub off the oil streaked across Tony’s cheeks. Tony complies, finding himself leaning into Steve with every stroke. Steve grabs a brush from the bedside drawer and untangles most of Tony’s unkempt hair with only a few complaints from his boyfriend.
Peter is squealing, attempting to hurdle towards Bucky, but his short, stumpy legs and unbalanced gait only get him so far before he’s tripping over himself and falling palms first on the driveway.
“I can’t wait to finally kidnap you from your idiot dads.” She says to him in her perfected baby voice.
Tony is twisting two pieces of some kind of metal together, eyebrows screwed together in concentration before he answers with composure, “Couple days to both.”
When breakfast is finished, and Tony and Steve have consumed 3 pots of coffee between the two of them, Steve finds Peter babbling in his high chair and scoops him up in his arms. Peter rests his head against Steve’s shoulder and grins. Tony’s heart clenches and he wonders what he used to be before any of this.
He takes a deep breath, and gently pulls Tony’s left hand into his own. When Steve slides the ring on Tony’s finger, it goes on smoothly and perfectly and with it, Tony feels his heart clench. He stares down at the ring for a moment, as if it might disappear if he looks away.
He rolls over, back cracking and joints popping. If that isn’t the most “happy birthday, you’re old” thing, Tony doesn’t know what is.
“You smell like…urine.” Tony configures finally, running a hand across Steve’s spine and then through his bed head hair. That poor hair hasn’t seen a comb in days.
Peter leans into her reach and she takes him from Bucky with delight. She snuggles him close and peppers his cheeks in kisses.
This used to never be in Steve’s future. The whole marriage and baby, domestic husbands and whatnot. He doesn’t know what he did to deserve this kind of lifestyle.
He strides over to Peter, who is speaking in classic baby jargon, waving his arms frantically, and Tony gives him a fond smile.
He finally reaches the kitchen and now he knows no apocalypse has occurred. Tony must have decided to be Superdad today and let Steve sleep in completely.
"Inhaler." He gasps, hand on his chest, trying so desperately to make his lungs work somehow. "Counter."
He grabs the inhaler from Tony like a lifeline and inhales. He gasps and waits a moment before inhaling again.
Steve almost doesn’t even think to answer due to his anxiety already consuming him, but then kicks into dad mode.
Steve pulls away, a hand straying on one of Tony’s shoulders and another cradling his cheek, running a thumb along Tony’s cheekbone softly. “Me too, baby.” His stare lingers for a moment before he turns to pop open the velvet box. With shaky fingers, he’s pulling the ring out of the box.
“I think Stevie’s got some separation anxiety,” Tony defends, lovingly looking over to Steve, who is sheepishly scratching the back of his neck.
Tony allows Nat and Clint to play dress up with him, throwing on a birthday sash and a ridiculously obnoxious birthday hat on his rambunctious morning curls.
“You know you still haven’t even told me what the special day is,” Tony teases, not looking at Steve. Before he can process what’s happening, Steve is on top of him, straddling him with a knowing smirk on his face. He leans down, lips ghosting over Tony’s mouth, hands delicately placed on his neck.
“Baby, let me see your hands,” Tony ‘overprotective parent’ Stark jogs up to Pete in Bucky’s arms and gently pries his palms up. Peter giggles and claps his hands together as Tony sighs in relief.
“Fu—Jeez. Dang it, Steve.” He breathes heavily for a second. “And you almost made me swear in front of Little Man right here!” He adjusts Peter in his arm against his hip and swats at Steve in the bicep with his free hand.
But Tony is happy. Tony has a family. Tony and Steve find time to have movie nights and cuddle and brush their teeth side by side still, and it’s enough for the time being. Tony gets to watch from the doorway when Steve reads Peter “Goodnight Moon” for the 8th time that week.
“Hey –” Steve places his hands on Tony’s hips and pulls them apart. “You hear what I said to you?” His lips curl slightly, taking the edge off the conversation, but still needing clarity that Tony understands how much he really fucking cares.
Steve inhales Tony’s hair and then buries his face in his neck, his favorite place, his hideaway, and pretends it’s plausible for them to stay in this exact position forever.
Steve is instantaneously next to Tony, placing a mug of steaming coffee next to his plate of pancakes. Tony silently thanks every and all Gods for Steve Rogers.
“Alright, Pete, we gotta let Pops rest, you know that,” Steve warns, pulling out the thermometer for Tony again. He unwraps a cough drop with one hand and pokes Tony in the cheek with it, fumbling with the thermometer with his other hand.
Tony continues to rub his back until Steve inhales yet again for the final time. He takes a deep breath and then sighs onto Tony's shoulder. He clutches him tightly, exhaustion of the attack taking over.
Tony blinks. He stares at Steve, lips slightly parted. And before he can even ask “what the fuck?” Steve is pulling a velvet box out of his jeans pocket and innocently placing it in front of Tony.
“Hm, bubblegum kind, yeah?” Steve questions, eventually scooping Peter up in his arms and settling him on his hip. He gently brushes a few stray curls off Peter’s forehead.
“Little man, they’re supposed to go in your mouth,” Tony wipes drool off Peter’s chin with his thumb, and then goes to retrieve the broom (which is now always, thankfully, in close proximity). He sweeps up all the cheerios and tosses them, coming back with froot loops this time. He pours a few in front of Peter and watches him repeat the motions again.
“I say – a day at Nat and Buck’s house.” Steve states eventually, eyes half lidded from exhaustion, and Tony agrees with a smile.
Peter laughs next to Tony. “Daddy, can I do the themo-meter this time?” He stumbles over the word a few seconds and Steve has to suppress a snort.
“Anything for you.” Tony replies, swallowing thickly after, rubbing a hand behind his neck. It’s not like it’s hard to say these things anymore, no. Tony is far past self-destructive tendencies and fear of vulnerability and things of that nature.
With all the skill in his tiny body, Peter places the thermometer in Tony’s mouth. Tony is able to maneuver the device under his tongue and lets Peter hold it until it beeps.
Steve gives him a small smile, and then, “Loving husband?” He raises a hand to his chin as if to think. “Never heard of that. Explain?” Tony just chucks a pillow at his head, despite the weakness in his throw.
Instead, just today, Steve takes Tony’s face in his hands, and kisses him deeply, filled with warmth and love and everything good in the world. Tony claims the cure for cancer could be found in the energy that is a kiss from Steve Rogers.
“I don’t wanna ask my boyfriend to marry me in that dorky hat, though.” Steve replies in such a calm and collected manner that Tony almost doesn’t even process the question for what it is.
Steve just laughs and runs a hand up and down Tony’s back for a moment. Clint and Nat are fumbling around in the kitchen with a plastic bag before they’re coming to the table with all kinds of nonsense Tony is bound to hate.
He doesn't even have to think about it anymore. He never considers the possibility of serious injury or inconveniences or struggles. He never worries that he may face crippling or detrimental issue that would put him in a state of panic because naturally, Steve always ends up okay.
Steve shrugs Tony’s hand off. “Comments like that won’t get you birthday blowjobs.” He says flatly, crossing his arms.
“And you’d make a sweet dad helpin’ his kid with the science project.” Steve replies, sitting back in his chair, arms crossed.
“You gotta stop pretending like I don’t want everything you have to offer me,” Steve commands, voice laced with both love and concern. “You gotta let me be there for you – even when life sucks, especially when life sucks.” He lets his arm that’s wrapped around Tony’s middle trail underneath his shirt and trace patterns against his skin as he talks.
Like hell if Tony knows where Steve's damn inhaler is, but that doesn't stop him from flying up the stairs to the communal kitchen and frantically scanning for it. Clint is luckily at the table, mindlessly scrolling on his phone.
Tony pulls Steve in and wraps his arms tightly around Steve's neck, immediately feeling Steve's arms curl around his waist.
“Love you kid, but I’m gonna need approximately 18 inches at least between us, kay?” Tony motions for Peter to sit back, and he does, still bouncing with anticipation.
Steve pulls away, hands still resting on Tony's hips with a comical smile plastered on his face. "Why the bathroom?"
"Hey," he places his hand on Steve's cheek and rubs his thumb along the cheekbone. "Don't be sorry. Don't ever apologize for something like that. I just - I mean, you haven't had any asthma attacks since I've known you. Not that I know of, at least."
Eventually, late in the afternoon, Nat is helping Tony gather up Peter and his belongings and tucking him into his car seat as he sleeps soundly.
"You're seeing me right now." Tony says with a nail between teeth, screwing two metal plates together.
“Mmph. Steve.” Tony’s voice is raspy from sleep. Steve is obviously awake from the yelling, as he immediately groans in response.
“C’mere, now, and I mean it,” He mumbles, and this time, Steve refuses to fight the smile tugging on his lips. This is all he’s thought about for nearly five days.
Steve slowly cards a hand through Tony’s damp waves, some brunette curls sticking to Tony’s forehead. “Alright, Pete, fun’s over. Let’s let Pop rest, okay?” Steve says softly, pulling Peter into his arms despite his son’s frown.
“Let’s go, idiot, Disney Jr. awaits,” Steve takes Tony’s hand and pulls gently, leading them to the living room.
He sits on the edge of couch, barely able to fit as Steve’s sprawled body takes up a majority of the space. Tony runs a hand along Steve’s spine and gives a light tap on his shoulder.
“You could be a loving husband and hand it to me, I am ill after all,” Tony quips, taking the cough drop out of Steve’s hand and practically inhaling it.
Bucky scoffs, and bounces Peter on his hip with one arm, and gestures wildly with the other. “He wanted to try rockband! The drumsticks are weapons, completely her fault, though.”
Steve smirks to himself, arms crossed as his four-year-old son stands in front of him. Peter looks like he has opened a new dimension as he stares at the wall of various adult medicines in front of him. Steve was definitely supposed to be in and out of here as quickly as possible to care for a currently sick Tony at home, but he adores the sight of his toddler gawking at everything before him.
“C’mere, please,” Steve murmurs, and he’s pulling Tony in one motion into his arms. He always waits for it – waits for Tony to shove him away, curse him out, push him immediately. It’s happened before, and it is sure to happen in the future. But Steve is surprised, although thankful, when Tony’s arms wrap around Steve’s waist hesitantly. Eventually, he adjusts his arms and he’s running his hands up and down Steve’s back, almost soaking in the reality he’s been missing out on for the past few days.
“Here you go, Pops.” Peter says, handing off the tablet carefully with both of his hands. Tony pulls Peter into his lap to embrace him in a hug and kisses him on his cheek in the process.
“I’m so happy.” Tony says into Steve’s ear. It’s not what he ever thought he would say after getting proposed to, but it’s how he feels. Happy.
“Baby, that’s not what a hate crime is.” Steve replies smoothly, running his hands over Tony’s forearms resting on the table. “And I need you to take off that birthday hat.” Steve looks up with his eyes, scrunching his nose at the outlandish attire.
Steve takes a deep breath and doesn’t realize he’s holding it in until it comes out of him in a big heave. “If It gets to 103, we have to go to the hospital. Promise me.” He says, voice shaking.
It's the same old song and dance, you know: Tony overworking himself, Steve getting worried, Steve getting excessively over-paranoid, actually. Steve nagging and complaining and pleading with Tony. It's a typical Tuesday night.
“I got it, baby. Coffee’s done brewing.” Tony gently says, pushing a mug into Steve’s hands, to which he grabs eagerly. Steve thanks him with a kiss on the cheekbone. Tony feels his chest tighten, still – still, after all these years, after all these years of cheekbone kisses he gets from Steve.
He guides Tony to sit on the bed. “Wait here, baby, ‘kay?” Steve doesn’t wait for Tony to agree before he’s off to the bathroom, grabbing a warm, moistened towel.
“Pop! We got bubblegum!” Peter squeals, hands resting on Tony’s chest. He coughs miserably out of Peter’s direction and then looks to Steve with confusion, eyebrows knitted together.
He can hear 80’s music in the kitchen. He could laugh out loud about it if he hadn’t just woken up. As he grudges down the stairs, the music becomes clearer: Everybody Wants to Rule the World.
Steve is leaning against the wall, watching with fondness as Tony unwraps the gift --(obviously, Spider-Man wrapping paper was utilized, but Tony isn’t really surprised).
“I did it!” Peter cheers, and Steve is taking the thermometer from Peter’s tiny hand to read the number lighting up on the screen. A solid 101.5.
“Honey, I’m home!” Steve says with amusement, walking into their bedroom. Peter is already squirming to get out of Steve’s muscular grip, so Steve leans down to release him – Peter’s feet are barely on the ground before he is hurdling over towards the bed, leaping up and crawling towards a sleepy and pale Tony. Years ago, Tony would get sick and insist on working on whatever it was that needed Tony’s attention. Years ago, Tony would ignore and deny any and all help, any medicine, any rest. Fast forward to now, Tony always, without fail, lets Steve and Peter be his at home nurses, and he couldn’t see it any other way now.
“Bed, mister. You’re crazy. Up, let’s go,” He motions for Tony to stand up, and comes around the table, offering a hand. Tony takes it and melts against his side. Steve leads Tony to the their bedroom, and it’s the first night in almost a week Steve won’t have to sleep alone.
“Happy birthday, baby.” He murmurs. Tony receives another kiss on the lips, a few light pecks on his jawline, and two down his neck. And right as he’s about to shut his eyes in bliss, Steve is on his feet, ready for the day.
It’s a bunch of shot glasses, each one with a different avenger on it. They’re actually real cool, Tony has to admit. Normally he couldn’t care less about the various ways companies try to profit off of them through merchandise, but hey, he could use these.
“Singing lessons. For all of you. Minus Bruce. He’s a good tenor.” Tony points his fork at Bruce and they share a warm smile.
Tony’s hand slides around the back of Steve’s neck and tugs him forward, swallowing down the soft gasp of surprise and the rest of Steve's self-sacrificing sentence. He’s pretty sure he can’t get any
Steve’s answering glower loses most of its effectiveness when he sneezes, crying out in pain and reaching for his back, like the simple act of sneezing has ruptured a disc. Tony eyes the small frame in concern, realizing it’s not impossible. Hell, given the circumstances, it’s not even improbable.
“Are we finally breaking up?” Tony jokes, knowing Steve will riot. Sure enough, when Tony cracks an eye open, Steve has an irritated and shocked expression his face, gaping at Tony.
Steve nearly tackles them both when he gets sight of them. He’s running up to them from behind and wrapping both his arms around the two. Tony nearly yells, jumping in surprise as he clings to Peter with both hands.
Tony clutches the steering wheel a little tighter. His mornings may start rough, with spilt cheerios and a screaming toddler and an exhausted Steve. But damn, if they don’t end fucking fantastic.
Tony practically sighs in relief. “Good! Would finally give me and my sunshine here some alone time.” He wraps an arm around Steve’s waist and draws him in tightly, their hips knocking together.
Steve fights the anger bubbling in his chest. "That's different. That's not being intimate, that's not spending quality time with someone you care about." Steve Rogers does not break, Steve Rogers does not cry during arguments. But he's got this weird, odd, unrecognizable feeling fluttering in his throat, in his sternum.
Steve takes a leap of faith, it’s all he can ever do with Tony: He reaches out gently and wraps his hand around Tony’s left wrist, putting his screwing of metals to a halt. His fingers always wrap around completely, so securely over Tony’s thin wrists. He pulls lightly, pulls Tony just enough to turn him so he can take his right wrist in his other hand.
“Does it involve one: getting up, and two: putting on clothes.” Tony questions, clearly content with the idea of remaining in bed.
Tony holds a hand out, motioning for Steve to sit next to him. Steve sits on the edge of their bed and clasps his hands with Tony’s.
Tony is tired. Tony is sleep deprived and usually cranky. Tony hasn’t gotten laid in exactly 13 days. Tony has gotten used to drool on his forearms and getting sneezed and coughed on.
Tony kisses Steve neck so gently that Steve almost thinks it’s not real, that this Tony is still a fabrication and the real Tony is somewhere else, ignoring reality and ignoring Steve.
Steve stirs, the same way he always does. Eyes bleary, squeezing shut before fluttering open. His arms stretch almost in slow motion and he kicks both legs out, all his joints popping almost alarmingly.
He pulls Tony up the stairs by the hand and soon enough, Tony is at the kitchen table, half asleep, awaiting food. The second Steve places the plate in front of him, Tony can’t help the way he savagely scarfs down the sandwich.
Bucky is immediately scooping him up; Peter may be too starstruck by his ‘uncle’ to even care about potential injuries.
"We're keeping inhalers all over this damn house. I mean it. Even in the bathroom." Tony scolds softly into Steve's ear.
"Did you come down here just to call me a shitty boyfriend? I forgot that memo. Pepper didn't remind me it was anti-Tony day, although I should be used to it, I guess, eh?" Tony is mindlessly rambling to himself as he fiddles with ripping a screw out of another metal piece.
“Okay, okay, I just – everything is so much scarier now that we have to take care of him.” He murmurs. In that moment, Peter comes hurdling in with Tony’s tablet and practically flings himself onto the bed.
“Steve. Shush. We are going to be fine. Nothing Tylenol and my two favorite guys can’t fix.” He gives Steve a reassuring smile.
Tony manages to untangle himself from his shirt and sweatpants, very uncoordinated, but successfully. He finds his way to his side of the bed and immediately buries himself deep under the covers, head barely visible.
“Yeah, I heard ya, I’ll believe you even more if you make me a turkey sandwich.” Tony shoots back. Steve can tell Tony tries to manage a quirky and comedic smile, but it doesn’t make his eyes crinkle or all his laugh lines come out.
“You want a metal, or?” Tony actually raises his head and turns to look at Steve, an eyebrow raised, annoyance plastered on his face.
“That means the gift is dirty, right?” Clint says, earning a firm slap on the back of the head from Nat. The rest of the team follows them, snickering as they leave.
“Present time.” Tony demands as Steve clears the dishes and walks them to the sink. Rhodey bunches up a napkin and tosses it at Tony, hitting him in the chin. “Hey, smarts, that was your gift. That shirt took a lot of effort, time, creativity, and most importantly, wit, to create for your special day.” He says with a straight face. Tony throws the napkin back in retaliation, but Rhodey deflects it with his hand.
Tony nods a thanks in Steve’s direction and then looks to Peter. “Wow, thanks, baby, that’s exactly what I needed. You must be getting smarter than me, how’s that?” Tony runs a hand along Peter’s cheek and ruffles his hair.
Tony is thankful its’ over, why is this a birthday ritual if it’s this uncomfortable? Singing happy birthday should have be eradicated a long time ago. He blows out the candles on his birthday pancakes to please the rest of the avengers. Bruce is able to snag the candles out of the pancakes before Tony starts cutting them up with anything except grace.
But he’s got these defining purple-blue bags under both his eyes, they’re lightly rimmed red, and his cheeks are flared pink, how they get when he’s under stress. Tony feels like a monster for turning Steve into someone he hates being, this caregiver, this babysitter to Tony’s emotions.
The late autumn sun is trickling through the window and casting a beautiful light on Steve’s cheeks and blonde hair and Tony finds himself falling in love over and over again in that single moment.
Tony swallows a bite of pancake before he’s rolling his eyes. “I’m sure you’ll recover in 60 seconds, Super Solider.”
But Tony places several more kisses to Steve’s jaw and his throat and Steve is reminded that this is what coming home feels like.
A poke in the side. The ribs, to be exact. Tony groans. The sun is already spilling over him, glaring into his eyes, anyways. He squints an eye open and doesn’t see Steve, so surely the man is behind him, probing relentlessly at Tony’s side.
“You know they’re gonna come in here to ruin the moment, right?” Tony smiles through the few tears still lingering on his cheeks.
“What? Oh – no, sweetheart. No, you did it perfectly!” He bends down to place a kiss on Peter’s head, who is currently beaming with pride.
“Act all high and mighty; it’s not cool anymore to disregard feelings, it just makes you pathetic.” Steve bites back. It’s harsher than he means it to be, but it’s not his fault Tony goes through phases in his life of hating everyone and everything. Steve stalks down the stairs, hands shoved in his sweatpants pockets.
Steve pretends to ponder for a moment before, “Yes and yes,” and kisses Tony’s cheekbone. And then Steve is already flinging the covers off himself and throwing on jeans and a white, annoyingly tight t-shirt. Tony throws himself back against the pillows and groans dramatically.
“Baby boy!” She all but coos at Peter, and she holds her hands out to him. It was weird seeing this side of Nat with Peter initially, but now, Steve and Tony are all kinds of grateful for her likeness to children.
“Happy birthday to you!” Nat, Thor, Bruce, Scott, Peter, Clint, Rhodey, and of course, Steve, awkwardly finishing singing in odd and various harmonies.
Steve hugs Tony closer, squishing Peter a bit in the process. He leans down to kiss Tony quickly and then plants another kiss on top of Peter’s head.
“That’s what Nat always says, and yet he came home with a bleeding lip last time.” Tony retorts, deadpanned expression on his face.
Nothing could take away the purity and perfection of this single moment. Not even the boys, who happen to be in the next room, clapping and obnoxiously blowing on leftover noisemakers from their morning celebration.
“You’re the mom, right?” Tony says as Steve makes his way over to the kitchen table, sitting in the chair directly next to Tony. He pulls Tony’s hand to his lips and kisses his knuckles once before replying.
Steve eventually catches up to them, looking like a classic new dad with his arms full of Peter’s things.
He doesn’t waste another second crawling into bed next to Tony and pulling him against his chest, wrapping his arms around his stomach securely.
Because after a moment, Steve emerges from upstairs, Peter on his hip, and fuck, if he doesn’t look like a zombie.  He’s got dark bags under his eyes, nearly bruising. His complexion is pale and his hair hasn’t been shaped in probably two years since they brought Peter home. Steve’s got two different socks on, and Peter is currently trying to stick his Black Widow action figure in Steve’s ear canal.
He's still talking to himself as Steve feels his throat constrict. Steve goes to inhale a deep breath and is met with utter and complete panic when he finds he is unable to do so. He tries again, chest rising with no relief of oxygen. His throat constricts yet again as he croaks out Tony's name weakly.
“You like it? Clint and I went to this one store in the mall, right, but I was heading towards the back, and the further I went, the more weird it got and eventually I saw these –”
Steve laughs, and Peter squirms in his arms. “You never say anything as interesting as Peter, I guess.” He teases.
He goes to inhale again before Tony stops him. "Hey, hold on, give it a sec, baby, it'll be fine, let it do its thing." He murmurs dryly, rubbing a soothing hand across Steve's back. Steve just nods, chest heaving as he licks his lips.
Tony sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, and then running his hand through his hair and behind his neck. “Steve, I get it, I really do, but c’mon, I’m okay, it’s just a fever.” He defends.
"And, y'know, other reasons that would lead you to run out of breath easily." Tony quips, looking up and then attaching his and Steve's lips together.
He smooths Tony’s curls again out of his face gently before peppering a few kisses on his forehead. “Love you, dummy. Get better soon or I’m finding a new husband.” He jokes.
“I promise, okay? Baby, it’s gonna be fine. It’s not the 40s anymore and I don’t have the Black Plague.” He laughs gently, trying to ease Steve’s mind.
“Tony.” He says in that stern and worried voice Tony has only heard about a million times in their relationship. “You can’t pull this anymore – it was cute when we were dating and when we had the Avengers, but we have a kid now; I don’t want you holding more than you can carry.” A classic Steve Rogers is Worried Monologue. Tony’s only heard about a trillion of those.
Tony fights the urge to roll his eyes. "Of course I love your company. I tell you that you can lounge down here whenever! Why is it my fault you don't take me up on my generous offer?" He quips, raising an eyebrow at Steve. That damn eyebrow raise.
“C’mon, Doctor, we gotta get back to Pops, can’t have him all alone now, can we?” Steve asks his son, head still tucked into Steve’s neck.
“No, today is a super special day,” Steve is smirking, Tony just knows. He feels Steve run a hand through his bed head gently. He moves closer into the touch; it almost makes up for Steve waking him up at God knows what time.
Tony is still half asleep as he fiddles with the coffee maker, shoving the pot back into place as he flicks the switch on and the machine starts to steam immediately, thankfully.
“I’m always smarter.” Peter says, so cute, yet just as sassy as Tony. And yes, Steve thinks, this is Tony Stark’s kid.
“Aw, Pete, you outdid yourself.” Tony turns and gives Peter a genuine smile, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
“Yes, yes, okay, sorry,” Steve almost laughs, but truthfully, he cannot imagine how tired Tony must really be. He’s already betting Tony will be snoring soundly the second the lights are off and he is pressed into Steve’s front, wrapped tightly in his arms.
Steve just runs his hands up and down Tony’s arms for a moment, soaking in the love of his life standing before him, sleep deprived and truthfully, a mess.
Sure enough, when they all enter the house, Nat is finishing her protection for Peter by putting the rockband drumsticks on a high shelf and putting some cords behind the TV.
Peter squeals from the high chair and Steve groans when he hears the sound of cheerios scattering the kitchen floor.
He’s crying, he knows he is, somehow he just doesn’t care, as Steve is pulling him into a tight embrace, arms around Tony’s neck. Tony’s arms find their way around Steve’s waist where they belong. Their knees knock against each other and he breathes Steve in, takes in this moment for everything it is. Now, he knows Steve’s crying, too, as Tony’s neck feels warm and wet from where Steve’s face is pressed.
Tony curls into himself, blankets engulfing him. “That sounds fair. I’ve had my other husband for awhile now.” He smirks to himself and receives a head shake from Steve in return. Steve adjusts Peter in his arms and the two of them exit the bedroom, leaving Tony giggling to himself.
“Okay, mom and dad want their alone gift giving time.” Nat says in a sing-song voice, giving Tony a kiss on the cheek before exiting the kitchen, grabbing Clint’s t-shirt sleeve on the way to pull him with.
