"First and only," John admits ruefully. "No matter how modern the Army claims to be, being attracted to men isn't something you want to advertise, if you get my meaning. Watch the wrong guy for a few seconds too long and you find yourself in all kinds of situations you don't want to be. It happens a lot - it shouldn't but it does. No one talks about it and you learn bloody fast or you go home."
“Forgive you?” John reads. “Sherlock, there’s nothing to forgive. That’s what I’m saying. You’re not thinking straight right now, so I have to be the one to keep a level head. I wouldn’t want you to do something you’ll regret when you’re completely recovered. Your friendship means too much to me to…”
Sherlock rolled his head along the wall, looking at John with sleepy eyes and a sated, sloppy smile. “We are,” he murmured, leaning in to steal one more kiss before John got to his feet and stretched a hand down to help his lanky genius up from the floor.
"My cousins - on my father's side."
After a while some of John's arguments must filter through the haze though as Sherlock addresses them between finding new places to touch.
"You're not so tough, Holmes," John grins. "Not immune to my charms, eh?"
Sherlock licks his own lips, eyes slowly refocusing, then he reaches out and grasps John firmly around the waist, burying his face in John’s belly, tasting the angle of his hips, and holding so tight as if he might lose everything before he’s even known it was his. He nuzzles into the sparse trail of hair below John’s navel, breathing him in, smearing his open, panting mouth over John’s superheated skin and leaving trails of sensitized skin in his wake.
“No need,” John interrupts and slips past her less politely than he might. “You’ve been so kind, coming out here like this so late. Really, I’m sure I can find my way around from here.”
Sherlock stays away, talks to his brother and smiles as politely as he can when Father introduces him to the young cellist who is a student of his, but as soon as is barely socially acceptable, he excuses himself and goes off into the kitchen to find some peace.
Instead of speaking, Sherlock scrabbles for John’s hand and pulls it down to where their pyjamas are damp with their combined excitement.
"Sherlock, I thought you'd turned in hours ago." Crispian says neutrally.
He watches John who lays patiently waiting. Sherlock's eyes are myriad shades of both colour and emotion. Bright and burning and tender and sweet by turns. He gently lays himself back alongside John and rolls back  into the space he left with a happy sigh and a soft, slightly smug kiss.
John sets his shoulders and pushes past him. “He called. From here. He said Sherlock was here.”
There’s no sign of anyone here though and Sherlock takes a deep breath, telling himself that’s what he’d expected so he can’t be disappointed. He has John in his real life in fresh and astonishing ways now, the ebullience of their newly declared love tempered and deepened by their months of cohabiting. It had been greed, pure and simple, to hope that his companion from his recovery might have remained. Clearly, Sherlock had created him as a point of stability when he’d most needed one. He cannot bemoan his loss when he has already gained everything. The avatar of John in his mind palace has merged with the real one.
The sound John creates is so horrific that he has new admiration for Sherlock’s skill; even when he’s
“No, of course not. You’ve never had a love of your life before,” Sherlock allows. He thinks for a moment. “Have you?” he checks.
To demonstrate Sherlock rolls to face the wall of his berth and tucks up his knees, running one long fingered palm across the swell of his perfect arse. He peeks over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow and cheeky smile.
Is John trying to let him down gently? Has Sherlock’s argument not had the impact he was hoping for? He tries to stay calm as he settles himself on the bed and encourages John to do the same. If it is fear that has stolen his voice this time, then his only hope is to ignore the warnings and indications that John has already decided against Sherlock’s wishes. It can only make his difficulties worse.
“Sherlock has never played well with others – and I’m talking generally here, not musically, although goodness knows what kind of excitement he might have caused had he chosen to pursue a career in performance.” Mycroft pins John with a needle-sharp glance. “ I mean, Dr Watson, that he’s never had the capacity or inclination to share. And this is his most prized possession – the one thing he had me take for safekeeping while he was… travelling.”
The man still doesn’t turn. Instead he shushes John and waves him away.
"Wow!" John grins. "What an impressive family you have." He wonders if Sherlock even knows how rare it is to have one celebrity relative. Growing up in a family like the Holmeses he suspects not.
Sherlock stalks off without waiting and walks back to the house with John trailing along in his wake. John rounds the corner of the house just in time to see him disappearing into one of the doors on the buildings to the side of the house. He follows him through the door and out of the bright sunshine. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the change, but after a moment he is confronted with a large, whitewashed room with modern stainless steel equipment on one side and on the other shelves and shelves of different honeys. There are some already in boxes on the floor and a counter full of labelled jars waiting to be packed but against the wall the jars are all unlabelled other than hand written stickers. They range from the palest of primrose yellows through greenish tinted jars and every shade of gold to the darkest jars that look like burned sugar and caramel.
He wishes he had known that one day he would be married to the most brilliant, gorgeous, unconventional and inventive man in London - it would have made his teenage years much more bearable. That he could not only fancy a man, but fall in love with one and promise to spend the rest of his life with him - well, that little gem would have kept him going when everything had seemed confusing and best kept quiet.
“Are you alright? You seem a little… preoccupied,” Sherlock asked after a short silence punctuated only by the soft crackle of the fireplace.
John chats to him, leaving obvious gaps for Sherlock to leap in and make an observation, should he suddenly find the inspiration to do so. John rolls his eyes at him, calls him an idiot, bullies him to eat and drink, doesn’t let him get away with any of the tricks that pity allows him to exploit in other visitors – as convalescent nursing goes, John’s is top notch in taking no prisoners and tailoring his approach to his current patient.
“And I haven't told you for reasons which will become… transparent.”
"That's not for two days," Sherlock scowls, casting John's arm away in disgust. "Tonight is Father's party, but we could have left much later than this and still been in plenty of time. Bloody Mycroft!"
Idiot.
"It was in retaliation for one of the many, many times that you stole..."
Amazing what you can miss when you don't like the answer.
"Tell who what?" he asks, looking between them.
Sherlock is relieved to remove his hated sling but hates the ache in his shoulder when he props his arm on the pillows John has placed there for that purpose. Hovering uncomfortably on the edge of sleep, Sherlock dozes but never quite tips over. The thought of John in Moriarty’s hands is bitter like bile in his throat. Was it what he had said to him that was making John watch Sherlock as if he were something to be feared? What cruelty did John have to endure even before he was strapped into a vest of explosives?
“We’ll see,” John says cagily. “You are still supposed to be resting. Maybe when you’re off your antiepileptic meds.”
“Has he only just noticed that you’re gone?” Hugh asks with a twitch of his eyebrows that John recognises seeing on his son.
Sherlock thinks he might vomit.
He can’t quite remember why he’s wet though. Or why he’s here.
“I’ll let you get settled in then,” she smiles and passes him the keyring. “I’ll drop around tomorrow, make sure you’ve got everything you need.”
John almost chokes at that, something that Sherlock doesn't miss, of course. John doesn't want to look more closely at the t-shirt he was struggling to recover from his flatmate but his eyes are drawn to the material clutched in Sherlock’s hand. John has marl grey t-shirts himself - he assumed that Sherlock had taken one of those from his drawer, not stuffed his hand down the back of John's bed and
Sherlock rolls his head and presses his nose into John’s stomach, inhaling deeply despite the man’s ticklish squawk and protests. Sherlock ignores them – he’d been right, John’s jumper smells deliciously of them and is given new heights of delectability by being heated by the man’s skin, and being positioned over the slight softness that John is self-conscious about, but that Sherlock always makes sure to kiss first when he undresses.
When Sherlock came home from Serbia, he'd considered so many possible outcomes of their reconciliation that he'd already been looking far beyond, when he’d finally walked into the Landmark that night and noticed Mary. His and John’s relationship before he’d gone had been tumultuous, a mess of emotion and repression and mixed-up thinking, but in that whole time, Sherlock had known that he could trust John to do the right thing when it had come down to the wire. When it had counted. But he had underestimated John’s grief. Could he say the same thing now? Could he trust John again?
How does he say these heart-felt, time stopping things without any evidence of effort or embarrassment. Sherlock hopes that one day, he will be in a position to return such sentiments with the ease and everyday insouciance that John shows.
“You didn’t. You have nothing to worry about.”
John has fetched his book and read a fair few pages since he sat down in an armchair that was perfectly placed for facing the sofa yet close to the fire. Watching Sleeping Beauty over there is all very well, but he knows that he needs to explain himself, and although the kiss had been very good and (he hopes) well received, it hasn't really given them a clear understanding of where they stand now. Neither of them are great communicators when it comes to personal matters - giving orders, pointing out (obvious) clues and telling people they are idiots are all simple, but telling someone about matters of the heart, about devotion and about respect are not their style - not to each other's faces anyway.
On an impulse, John turns to press his lips against Sherlock’s forehead, breathing in the scent of his sweaty hair. And suddenly the words are there. Unleashed.
This is his fault.
He doesn't need a lecture about his girlfriends, thanks all the same. After a few disastrous attempts at dating when they first moved into Baker Street, John realised that he was actually not all that bereft when they were inevitably chased away by Sherlock's antics. It became a bit of a game in some ways after a while, which he knows isn't fair to the women who gave him the time of day in the first place. In the end, the effort of finding and placating them wasn't worth the investment. He hadn't been looking for anything serious and he didn't think his dates had either, so any women he did catch the eye of were for fun and were summarily dropped whenever Sherlock called for him.
“John,” he gasped when John lifted his chin and sucked Sherlock into his mouth. He reached down a hand to touch the hinge of John’s jaw and run his thumb against the stretch of John’s lips around him. John bobbed his head over his cock, knowing that Sherlock could feel everything – not only the sensation of John’s lips and tongue and the sweet suction, but how John’s jaw had to work to accommodate him, how John swallowed around him and sipped in shallow breaths when he could.
“Understandable given your heightened anxiety and our less than cheerful history with the hospital,” Sherlock agrees. His hands are on John’s knees, warm through his sodden jeans – the only part of him that is.
“Eugh!” Sherlock sighs. “If I agree, can we never mention him in our bed again?”
"I..." Sherlock stops and their progress around the room ceases, leaving two middle aged men, holding each other tightly in a room slowly emptying of sunlight. "I don't know when that started but within a day of meeting you I was already doubting the veracity of that particular belief. I suspect it was something I had created for myself to keep me... safe."
“So let’s be honest now, “ Sherlock says, his voice miles away from his usual smooth baritone. He doesn’t make full eye contact, just quick glances. He turns from the window, faces John and seems to come to some conclusion with a short nod and renewed focus.
“Umm, yes.”
The man is smiling, his unusual eyes sparkling as he looks around, watching the returning insects join the group and John catches himself staring at him wondering what colour such unusual eyes are up close. He’s very slim and that makes him look taller than he really is, even though it’s still five or six inches taller than John, but he's used to that.
can’t go back…” This little speech is made in a harsh, half-choked whisper. His fears are writ large across his weary, honest face.
When they get back to the house, John is swept up by Violet and put to work placing the flower arrangements on the tables in the marquee and in other strategic spots around the garden that she has drafted on a map that she presses into John’s hand before disappearing. He does his best, watching out for Sherlock as he works, trying not to let the stupid thoughts in his head take hold. He spots him once or twice, deep in conversation with his brother or attempting to interpret his mother's directions with a very poor show of grace. Sherlock doesn't spot him, or if he does, he doesn't let on, and John is quietly glad. He doesn't feel ready to have the conversation he fears is coming. Even if he's wrong, even if it's innocuous and he's got the wrong end of the stick, there's something about being here in the place that Sherlock grew up, that makes him feel as if he's trespassing on a past he wasn’t part of.
Now, of course, he thinks of it as what it was - a distraction from his purpose, from his life’s work. He has fought to believe this - he has even tried to incorporate the insights he gained into his cases; the motivations of jilted lovers and the ways in which passion might be twisted into something quite destructive given the right, or wrong circumstances. He hasn’t been entirely successful in this however hard he has tried - it appears that once tasted, love is quite difficult to forget.
They arrive at the cottage soon after three. Sherlock endures his mother's clucking but finds that he enjoys the genuine warmth with which John and his mother greet each other. Father too seems very happy to see John again and makes suitably appreciative noises when John hands over the hastily but kindly chosen birthday present. When he tells Father that Sherlock had ratted him out about not being a whiskey drinker, Father says that he has started to have a tot of the stuff on his breakfast porridge and that it warms him up no end on colder days. John seems pleased by this and smiles warmly, even at Sherlock. The relief is as ridiculous as it is welcome.
“Did you ever doubt that we could have this?” Sherlock asks aloud.
John sighs but takes the phone. His face tightens miserably as he reads, and he carries Sherlock’s mobile with him as he limps into the sitting room, clearly giving himself time to marshal another argument. Sherlock follows, words thick and cloying in his throat.
“Look, can we start again please?” John pleads, feeling increasingly out of his depth.
“I love you,” John says, unable to keep the words behind clenched teeth any longer. He’s going to let them out – all of those that he has been forced to hide all this time. Every
"It never is, but the effort will be worth the pain. Either way you will have an answer. John is too good a man to let a little thing like you being smitten by him get in the way of a friendship like yours, should he not return your sentiments, but I have a very good feeling that will not be the case. Now, John is on his way back up. Think fast. What's it to be?"
“I am. I did. We had drinkssss.” John burps quietly and begs Sherlock’s pardon.
Finally clothed, a little flushed still and smelling strongly of the deodorant he sprayed on himself and into the air to mask the scent of his activity, John is  ready for the day and he quits the bathroom. Sherlock slips in behind him immediately, as if he really had been waiting right there, and closes the door a little more forcefully than necessary. John thought he'd been quite quick despite everything, and Sherlock hadn't said anything about being desperate, so he shrugs and adds it to today's tally of Sherlock's quirks. He has to start a new one each day as any longer term list quickly becomes unwieldy.
Until John.
The madman is still lying on the sofa, long toes still curling and flexing. He opens his eyes when John stops beside him and just for a second, John swears he sees something fragile flicker behind  that direct gaze before the bland mask comes down.
"Get some rest, you great idiot," John yawns already wondering if he can be bothered to shower or if he can get away with a quick wipe down with the ruined pyjama trousers and sort the rest out in the morning.
Sherlock looked up and just for a second as he came to stand in front of him, John got a glimpse of the pain and confusion in his eyes. It was an expression he'd rarely, if ever, seen on the brilliant, assured man's face before, so it took John a few seconds to place it. But by the time he had, Sherlock had recovered his cool reserve.
John smiles to himself, tired but finally here. He tries the lightswitch that he locates with the beam from his phone’s torch and isn’t at all surprised when it does nothing. He finds his way upstairs and chooses the nearest room with a bed in it. Dropping his bag, he rummages until he finds his old service pistol hidden under the removable base and shoves it under the pillow. He lays down fully clothed on top of the quilt, asleep before he remembers he should take his tablets.
to look.
“Hmm? Long enough?” John asked, distracted.
It’s the blue of John’s eyes.
The hat stops and pauses, then slowly comes back the other way and around the corner of the bed along with a slightly irritated man. John is distracted again by the changing colour of the man’s eyes and how very high his cheekbones are. John recalls how tall and slender he is, but he’s surprisingly pale for a man who spends so much time out of doors. He’s got full lips and a distinguished nose, and while he’s not classically handsome, John defies anyone to deny that he is a striking looking man.
John laughs and relents. "Sorry, Molly. Good for you."
Not only is John having the best sex of his life, but he finds deep contentment in the minutiae of sharing his life - breakfasts while swapping pages of the paper, falling asleep on the sofa watching documentaries, waking up with morning breath and disastrous hair because, under all the genius persona, Sherlock is as human as anyone else - and being allowed to share
>>>>>>><<<<<<<
“There’s another door.” He gestures towards the kitchen and the entryway to the inexplicable appearance of his highly improbable ideas and plans for their future. “It’s… I’ve never been there. In fact, it may not even exist. It’s not part of my mind palace and I don’t fully understand how it has been able to create itself here. You must know how this works, John; I have explained it to you before. If I haven’t consciously recreated it and assigned meaning to each of the elements therein, then why is it here?
Sherlock abruptly wonders if perhaps John has a mind palace of his own. He delights in wondering what that might be like before he remembers that he's supposed to be paying some attention to John out here in the real world.
All was quiet when he entered the flat.
He takes a resigned breath before slicing into the tape and uncovering her latest scheme. He reaches in and retrieves books, but it’s not psychological claptrap this time - these are gardening books aimed at beginners and those interested in self-sufficiency. Beneath that are many packets of seeds, a trowel, a fork and some tools he doesn’t even know the name of let alone the reason for. There are tags, string, seed trays and plastic cloches, a journal to record his planting and some wicked looking secateurs.
John glances over his shoulder, smiles quizzically but doesn’t demur. “I don’t think we have any plans, love. Did you want to do something?”
So he says nothing – not even the speech therapist can persuade him to try any more. Why tempt fate now? Who knows what further damage he might do unintentionally? He has nothing but time on his hands; he will wait until these feelings recede or until he is assured that he has more control over the words he speaks even though the specialists tell him that without practice there will be limited improvement.
He wants to say more because there is so much to say if he could only say it safely, but these seem to be the only words that he can speak with any confidence. Tears prick his eyes but don’t fall as he presses the words into the air around John’s sleeping body hoping that some of them might break through into his dreams.
John’s voice, coming from through the door, is urgent, breaking a bit. He sounds like he’s lying in that doctorly, placating manner Sherlock has heard from numerous healthcare professionals through his life. He loathes it, especially when John uses it on him.
“She said you're an army doctor?”
“John! John, look at me.”
"Sherlock? Are you okay? What is it?" John asks tightly when Sherlock begins to blink uncontrollably at his mobile.
John focussed on his tea and tried to push away the wave of possessive lust that swept him every time he thought about Sherlock sitting there wearing his favourite jumper. He’d left it hung over a chair in their room a few days ago, worn once but not dirty enough to warrant washing yet. It would smell of him, he knew and the fact that Sherlock had chosen to wrap himself in something so clearly John’s and so unlike his usual choice made John want to pick him up and hug him – stick his hands up the inside of the soft wool and finish what the jumper had started, namely, scent-marking Sherlock as
“Hi! Nice to meet you,” John said, dredging up a smile from somewhere and feeling his soul die a little more in the process.
She kisses John's cheek and they all remark again on
John is hooked instantly.
“You know what this means, don’t you?”
Sherlock’s response is slow in coming and measured, but he spreads his palm across John’s heart and leaves it there as his body slowly relaxes, letting go of the thrumming of unexpressed, untried emotions.
The love of his life – now isn’t that something?
Sherlock begins to feel quite lightheaded after a few more minutes of kissing John; breathing is utterly secondary to the point of this exercise, but he has to pull away an inch or risk falling over.
“Oh, you’ve got the fire going already. Lovely. There’s nothing better to make a place feel a bit more homely, is there?”
“Learn quicker,” Sherlock whispers as John closes his mouth over the juncture of his neck and shoulder, sucking a deep wet kiss into the smooth skin there.
Sherlock thinks. Crispian may have a point. They get a lot of people assuming that they are together for some reason, but it has been over seven months since John last jumped down the throat of anyone who alluded to their sexual preferences.
And then John's hand is on his jaw, gently tipping his head, so he can get a different angle. It's even better. John is brilliant. Insightful. Smiling? He can feel John's lips stretch into a grin against his mouth (the sensation is delicious), but then he cups Sherlock's cheek and disengages, dabbing one, two, three smaller kisses as he steps back.
"Nurgh," John croaks and coughs. "Nothing, I...I  just haven't seen you in jeans before." He must look ridiculous and so plainly turned on (
But this is no place for talk of Moriarty or Mary or the time they were alone. This is their happily ever after with the dragons and the witches vanquished, this is the end to the dark days and the beginning of what they have earned for themselves. Each other. Understanding. Honesty.
John smiles quickly at Sherlock and calls to Crispian who slowly, carefully peeps out from behind the curtain and Sherlock marvels anew at the artificial  lines of tension in the man's face.
"You can ask me anything, you know. Anytime,” John offers softly.
“Look.” John’s voice is beginning to lose its patient smoothness. “This isn’t you,” he asserts. “We’re close, best friends and you’re confusing that with… I don’t know…” John can’t find the right word and gestures towards the bed in frustration. “It’s not your fault. Your injury…”
‘What if someone comes?” John croaked, unable to draw his eyes away from the long, perfect fingers wrapped around him.
"How are you?" John asks, eager and interested. He always was one for the
Sorry?
“Is he in some kind of trouble?” John asks quickly before she can gather her things and leave.
Sherlock drops the handle of the teapot, all that is left of his latest experiment with his environment. He notices that the floor is now clear of ceramic shards and a manic-edged laugh rises to his lips. Like a man in a trance, he lurches back to the door between the landing and the sitting room, and sinks down against it.
John felt like he would come in his pants with only mild encouragement having watched his boyfriend come his brains out already and his own ardour rising with each lazy pass of Sherlock’s hands on him. If he could just get him to focus his attention on his cock…or perhaps he could rub himself off against the already ruined fatigues if Sherlock would stay still for long enough.
"Curiosity," Sherlock replies, his eyes flying open and fingers instinctively grasping the fabric of his prize when John tries to snatch it back.
Sherlock, who is smiling at him with a combination of smugness and sheepishness, walks to meet him, takes his hand and leads him back to stand before Mycroft. John's heart could not be more full. He thinks of the beautiful jacket that he left up in their room and the sleeves that he has rolled up in the heat of the afternoon sun. Sherlock too is in shirtsleeves and his hair has escaped whatever alchemy he uses to tame the mad curls into neat waves.
But there's something about the way Sherlock is sitting awaiting John’s questions, about how still his hands are for once, about how alert he looks, how invested.
It takes an unimaginable amount of concentration and effort to breathe through the shuddering, and the grasping, twisting uncertainty of his ability to respond to Sherlock’s calm voice, rumbling in his ear and vibrating through his upper body. He’s exhausted by the time he feels like he isn’t about to suffocate at any moment. He lets his head fall back, feels the solidness of Sherlock’s shoulder and just rests there.
"Hmmm. Why? I'm comfy here," Sherlock responds in a lazy tone, only the smallest hint of teasing in it but John can see the tiny quirk of a smile at the edge of Sherlock's lip.
“Yep!”
Deciding it's not worth his breath to argue - Sherlock will inevitably get his way as he always does - John braces his back against the tree trunk and laces his fingers together, crouching slightly so Sherlock can fit his muddy boot into John's mercifully gloved hands.
It took him a month to coax him out of calling his cock a phallus.
things about you. I want to know the things that you
"What time did you say you would get in?"
John even smiles at her terrible joke. Sherlock sighs loudly and gets a glare from both of them.
For a man who was lying unmoving to begin with, Sherlock's stillness is so obvious it's as if he resonates with the tension of his silence.
When John has schooled himself sufficiently to look back to his fiance, Sherlock has turned toward him.
– a date before which it cannot be. The paint is his starting point and, turning a full circle, he discards anything that comes from that case or before - riding crop by his music stand, scuffs on the floorboards from the pink suitcase, London A-Z left on top of shelved books, a yellow smiley face on the wall and the lucky cat. He looks for what came later – eczema ointment tubes on top of the fridge, a business card from Janus Cars in the mirror frame, chopsticks from the place that did the good black bean sauce, tea stain on carpet from an unfortunate breakfast situation, head shots of Connie Prince on top of John’s CV pushed to the corner of the desk, bullet holes in Mrs Hudson’s wall and an astronomy journal brought back from the security guard’s flat.
Pushing Sherlock’s shoulders lower, John leaned back and was greeted by the sight of the smooth black top of the toy, shining with leaked lube from the dusky pinkness of Sherlock’s hole.
With a shout, Sherlock pulsed in John’s hand, muscles tensing in a way that John could feel course through him as he tightened rhythmically around John’s cock.
Their friends and family stop a pace or two behind them in a loose semi-circle and Sherlock doesn’t relinquish John's hand, but holds it tighter in his own and turns to face his brother who looks from one to the other.
The exhilaration of being with Sherlock with his quirks and oddities is making him more attractive to John, not less. He’s laughing, mostly because Sherlock is grinning that grin, he doesn’t even know what the joke was, but tomorrow feels like a long way off right now.
As she chatters away her hands are busy, putting things in cupboards, switching on the fridge at the socket and filling the crisper with salad, and laying the table for two. She leaves the bread, a couple of wrapped cheeses and one of the bottles of wine on the table while she hunts down some glasses.
John might well regret having said the things he’s said in the harsh light of day. That’s an uncomfortable thought.
Mrs Hudson hums in a way that tells him exactly what she thinks about his manners. “Either way, you two never got a chance to work these things out, and knowing you both, I doubt either of you had the sense to even try to talk about it.”
“What I said last night,” John begins, itching to place a finger against the bend in Sherlock’s elbow or the nape of his neck or the back of his hand, just to connect, to assure, to prove himself.  “I meant it. All of it. We can go wherever you like from here. That’s what ‘I love you’ means, to me at least. I have no expectations, but I think I’ve hidden behind my fear of losing you again for too long. It’s stopped me from being honest with you.”
when it doesn’t smell like takeaway or Sherlock’s latest experiment.
Sherlock joins them from the kitchen where he’s been depositing the empty wine glasses. Mrs Hudson goads Sherlock into a kiss with a minimum of argument, which is the strongest indicator so far of just how very mellow everyone is feeling.
Sherlock keeps his eyes averted, knowing that there’s no way that he can meet those words with anything but pain on his face. There’s not enough air in this place, not enough air in this entire city if he has to know that John Watson is out there, not only leading a life without him, but living it aware of just how much Sherlock had hoped for something else.
When he looks up from his work he finds he has lost an entire morning. He’s had no breakfast or lunch and his coffee mug is on the window ledge where he left it when he came in earlier. John looks back down to his pad to find that he has filled pages with notated plans, lists of potential plants, a shopping list for the things he will need and a to do list. He blinks at it and smiles before the ache in his back, the pressure in his bladder and the gurgle of his stomach persuade him to call it a day.
“Right,” John agrees, still licking the sweetness off his lips. “Did you make all of these?” he asks conversationally.
“Nope,” John replies instantly. He pushes away the plate but swallows from his mug with evident relief.
He shivered, glad that Sherlock was too engrossed in his hedonism to notice.
He needs to think further on this, but John’s genuine pleasure is warming to see. “And you
“How rare?”
He slips his hand below the water again and cups Sherlock's balls, carefully lifting them and tugging on them, then even lower, the pads of his fingers rubbing at the tight furl between Sherlock's cheeks, gently to start and then with more intent, pressing into him, just the slightest bit and feeling the heat of him at his core. John can't reach far enough to press his fingers deeper and find the place that makes Sherlock tremble, but he works his opening lose, taps his fingertips against the hot skin and alternates his fingers with his knuckle, pressing harder and setting off ripples through the muscles of Sherlock's thighs and arse. This works out well for John  - since Sherlock shifted, his gorgeous arse has been snugged against John's desperate cock and with each ripple of pleasure, Sherlock squirms against him.
And this is the crux of the matter. It’s taken them months and months of hesitations and misdirections and uncertainties. Unspoken words and good intentions. In some ways, John thinks, it’s fitting that they’re back here at the site of Sherlock’s greatest sacrifice to acknowledge finally that they need to get one thing established once and for all.
“Well I can see that dear. There’s nothing wrong with my eyesight.”
He’d rather stay silent than say something unwise accidentally; he’s never been good at this sort of thing and the potential for disaster here is magnified by his injury and his lack of adequate emotional control. Just the speech difficulties would be mortifying enough, but there is a further danger posed by the fact his emotions currently run unchecked just as he’d been told they might. His brain bouncing off his skull then being compressed by the resulting bleed has had effects that are only becoming more apparent each day. John takes Sherlock’s fears, furies and tears in his stride but Sherlock loathes it and cannot bear that he can’t catch his emotions before they’re already pouring out of him. He feels exposed and transparent despite the quiet protective empathy that John seeks to offer him.
John cannot help the double take when he emerges from the loo to see the wrong Holmes brother sitting in Sherlock’s chair the following morning. He knows that Sherlock has already gone. He heard him shout up a quick, “See you later,” and something about Angelo’s for dinner.
"Sorry, what party now?" You can almost hear the screech of John's mind derailing from where it was happily heading. He should be used to the sinking sensation in his stomach when he learns that Sherlock has committed them to a situation having only given him half the damn story, but it catches him every time.
The garden is coming along nicely. His hands have new calluses on the palms and his back has a pleasant ache in it in the evenings, the warmth of hard work and used muscles rather than anything problematic. Even his leg has been improving after Holmes’s quip about the therapist. He’s cleared enough of the beds to produce a good quantity of fruits and veggies this summer - he could clear more and start thinking about planting for later in the year, but that feels presumptuous and too soon. He doesn’t like to plumb the reasons for his resistance to forward planning too deeply.
John turns then and reaches out a hand so they are both grasping each other.
. John is scanning the partygoers, hoping to catch sight of his fiancé but all he spots is Molly Hooper chatting animatedly to a bookish-looking man who seems to have the same curls as Sherlock, although his are mid brown rather than black.
“I suppose it would, I’ve never thought about it before,” John agrees, finally feeling that they are having a conversation as he understands them. “Have you been doing this for a long time then?” he asks, watching the jars as the sunlight seems to make them glow. “You’re not from here, are you? Your French sounds amazing to me, but your English accent can’t be a second language…”
"There isn't... Mary lost the baby early on. She can't have been more than a couple of weeks late at the wedding."
who could out-talk the entire bloody House of Commons, are being
John is assailed on too many fronts, the smell of Sherlock, the sight of his spend, still all over his skin, and the sharp awareness behind the eyes that are watching him so intently. His own fist has never, ever felt so good. Under Sherlock’s rapt gaze, John wants to show off, show this mad, infuriating bastard just how crazy he makes him, how he has longed for him, how desired he is.
"What? Other than the fact that I wasn’t in love with her?” John smiles  mirthlessly. “ We barely knew each other really. I was lonely and still grieving. She was funny and kind and when I was with her I felt as close to whole again as I had since you’d gone. And then you were there. Right there, laughing and being a dick and I honestly thought I'd lost touch with reality - that I was hallucinating. Thought I'd finally given up the struggle and checked out to be wherever you were. I missed you so badly, some days I couldn't..." He sniffs forcefully and changes tack.
Sherlock shrugged huffily. “No, I like to remind myself that I am no longer an adolescent by wearing clothing designed for adults.”
“You’re exaggerating to make a point. I don’t wear a suit
Equally, of course, he hasn’t made any mention of wishing to stay or having had a change of heart about his marriage despite their difficulties in the aftermath of the Leinster Gardens revelations.
“What does this entail? Being the love of someone’s life?”
John tries to turn in his arms, but Sherlock tightens his hold and watches his reflection with calculating eyes. John looks askance, but Sherlock is already letting his palms glide lower, smoothing over his belly and hips before sweeping a glancing brush up the underside of his cock. It hadn't really had time to flag, but it twitches strongly at Sherlock's attention.
"Your friend, then," Mycroft allows. And although the noun can't help but be soured in Mycroft's voice, the way he offers the phrase is more gentle than Sherlock might have credited him with being capable of.
Sherlock takes the instrument back. He’s never looked so awkward with it in his hands before. “Another time, perhaps,” he murmurs.
His throat aches even as his voice becomes more shrill. His chest burns, his fingers, still pointlessly pressed to his mouth, are trembling. John knows these are symptoms of panic or PTSD, it’s the way his attention flies from point to point, never settling, the way his head spins. It’s the alarming thudding of his heart and the way he cannot seem to take a deep enough breath to stop the anoxia symptoms.
John had thought Mary was safety. After Sherlock died, John wanted nothing more to do with the life they had built together. He’d craved normality and boredom if it meant that he’d never again have to endure the heart crushing grief of losing his friend.
A bit happier with his appearance, John steps out and follows the quiet roads that take him to the front gate of the Manoir de Saint Barthélemy. Squaring his shoulders he walks through them and starts up the driveway. He feels rather exposed and a little foolish walking up to the property. The grounds are extensive and well kept and the house isn’t even visible from the road. He wonders briefly if he’s going to have hounds set upon him then smirks at his own wild imagination. It is a bit imposing though. There are stands of trees and a large pond (small lake?) in the distance. The property on this side seems to stretch away as far as the wooded hillsides and the crunch of his feet and his cane on the gravel of the drive seem very small in comparison to the size of the grounds.
John just smiles, not sure where this is going, and Sherlock takes that as a yes. There's a brief shot of the ceiling of his compartment, then static and knocking as Sherlock props his phone up, so John can see more of the layout. Sherlock reaches over to pull down the blind on the window and John takes the opportunity to have a look at Sherlock's digs for the night. There's a small double bed and a sink and John is touched to see Sherlock's Belstaff hanging from a peg on the back of a door - it’s a touch of normality that grounds him. The light changes, goes dark, then returns in a much more subtle shade; bedside lamps, John realises. It's hardly a big space and Sherlock steps back as far away from the camera as he can, then smirks at John, his hands going to his belt and doing nothing to hide that fact that he’s already hard.
They emerge into the bitter air, the wind biting at skin that had been pleasantly warm only seconds before. Sherlock didn't demur when Crispian offered to pay and he follows them out, still pocketing his wallet.
“No, wait...” Sherlock growls and bows his head to bring his lips to John’s ear. “I’m monitoring your temperature, pulse and respiration – is there anything else I should be doing?” he murmurs.
“What are you… suggesting?” Sherlock asks, avoiding the word
They begin to say their final goodnights and exchange wishes for a joyful holiday season when Mrs Hudson suddenly squawks and asks them to wait while she finds the card she has written for Sherlock’s parents and she disappears into the kitchen with a flap of hands and a muttered, “now where did I put it?”
Instead he turns his attention to Sherlock's long, needy cock. It is a dusky colour when flat against the pale cream of his stomach. There isn't much slickness under the water and his hands aren't as eloquent as they usually are as a consequence. John makes his strokes long and firm, lifting the crown of Sherlock's cock almost out of the water, his palm sweeping over the head at the top of each stroke. Sherlock shudders every time and makes tiny voiced breaths which drive John crazy. He loves to see Sherlock let go when they're intimate, loves to watch him surrender the responsibility for his satisfaction to John and, best of all, he loves to give him what he wants.
Sherlock says nothing, watching his reaction then turns to pick a new spatula and take a scoop from the second jar, a much paler offering. John breathes it in and smells floral, herbal and medicine notes. The flavour is brighter than the other two he has tried. He can still taste the herb notes, but there’s a dried fruit element that is delicious.
“So?” Sherlock repeats, having reached the end of his empathic responses to John’s Romeo delusions.
"Was about to ask you the same thing."
Sherlock straightens up and turns away to throw the used spatulas in the bin and put back the unwanted honey jar. His back is straight and forbidding.  Another of those difficult silences settles and John curses himself for making this awkward although for the life of him he doesn’t know how.
"Other than that they have my bed? Oh nothing, they're just a bit dull," Sherlock huffs. "Odelia is an artist and her husband Robert is an actor. Crispian is a musician, like my father."
A circle of wicker chairs has been set up and everyone takes a seat, talking amongst themselves. There's no need for speeches or cakes and even the flowers are in another part of the garden. Their suits are in their bedroom, still in the shrink-wrapping, and yet John cannot imagine a more perfect wedding ceremony - it's so very them. Greg and Mycroft are deep in conversation, Mycroft barely recognisable as he smiles and leans back in his seat. Mrs Hudson and Violet are trading stories about Sherlock and Mycroft, and Molly is listening to Hugh, nodding and smiling at his words. In the midst of all of this, John steals a second to squeeze his husband's hand.
John follows Sherlock's finger and sure enough, in the trees nearby there are large globes of living leaves. They look a bit like dull, green baubles hung in the dormant branches.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and blinked before a slow, darkly delighted smile broke across his face.
Sherlock’s had been more subtle – the tea with the honey aftertaste. Martha knew that Sherlock hoped to raise bees once he retired from the work and a nod toward John joining him in that future hadn’t been difficult.
Without a conscious command, Sherlock’s hips begin to rock, gently and slowly, not pushing for more, but delighting in their spiralling, mutual pleasure.
Sherlock had to have been at this for some time by then, what with the photos and John’s run back, and it didn’t take long for a flush to flood his cheeks, creep down his neck and onto his chest, rosy and uneven.
“Nope,” he popped. “Very, very real.” He squirmed a little in his seat, drawing attention to the growing distortion in his fancy pyjamas. Planting his feet, he let his knees splay open in a gesture so inviting, John had to swallow down a mouthful of saliva and a growling whimper.
"Okay, so I'm asking now. What does he play?"
“He’s not himself without you, John - without someone there to chase him out of his dark moods and to remind him to come home when he’s caught up in one of his cases. He’ll never admit it, but he’s much more content when you’re here at Baker Street, where you belong. He’s not happy when you’re not here. He wants you to stay. And so do you.”
“I understood that you appreciated our partnership, but despite what I thought, your reasons were never stated. I don’t mean to sound callous, but you would never let anyone labour under the misapprehension that we might be…more. So if I wondered, on occasion, if what you felt for me might be something other than you had admitted or even realised, I accepted that it wasn’t something you would ever want to explore in any way that might lead to…”
Sherlock didn’t even grace that with an answer, merely dripped onto the carpet, leaving a spreading patch of darker red. His suit and shoes had to be ruined they were so sodden, and his jacket was darker at the shoulders but dripping from the hem. His shirt, where it was visible, was translucent and stuck to Sherlock like a second skin. His curls, so artfully messed that morning, were plastered to his head, dribbling rivulets of water that he didn’t even bother to wipe away from his face and neck.
This is not turning out the way Sherlock had planned at all. First his parents have changed the large double bed in his old bedroom for two tiny twin beds, neither of which is large enough for two grown men to fit in, regardless of whether one of them is more diminutive than the other, so even if he did engineer some mishap that rendered one of the beds unusable, it would just mean one of them spending a night on the sofa or on the floor - neither of which coincides with Sherlock's aims. And now his dreadful, tedious cousins have commandeered John and they have him cornered by the terrace windows, probably telling lies about Sherlock's childhood.
“Why am I here?” he asks. He’s tired and the question is semi-rhetorical.
“I’ve just told you - I won’t be seeing…”
A text alert startles him and he flicks it open, reluctant to take the phone away from his ear for more than a second.
There are no answers; only endless questions. And he’s deeply, utterly exhausted by it.
“Wear the suit, wear your bathrobe, wear your most horrific cardigan, wear nothing at all, I couldn't care less,” Sherlock says, gesturing to the room at large. “But if you would be so kind, I would like to marry you, if you’ll have me - later on today if convenient.”
Of course, these days it’s quite a different matter.
Sherlock stops and looks around.
Understanding dawns in Sherlock's eyes and he gives the matter some thought. "Not for a while yet," he reports.
Mrs Hudson stirs up the fire, adds more fuel and then announces that it’s time for presents. She selects a few from under the tree and hands them out.
John's cock jerks and he swears he can feel every single cell in his body, vibrating at the same frequency as the mobile signal.
He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.
John is tired to the core and he recognises that something has changed between them tonight but he’s been here before. He was so certain that the return to their life at Baker Street would herald the beginning of a new understanding between them – an acknowledgment of the importance of their relationship. And in some ways it has, but it hasn’t shifted as far as John hoped it would. And now they are back here, after the rawness of the hospital, John can’t help but feel that another opportunity to tell Sherlock has slipped through his fingers. For a man who strives to show no emotion, Sherlock certainly does provoke them in others. John feels like Mother Nature herself has decided to teach him a lesson.
"What happened?" Sherlock knows he was supposed to express his sorrow and concern at the demise of the Watson marriage, but he doesn't quite feel up to that.
“Sit down, John. I’ll fetch you some water. And a bucket.”
With careful strokes, Sherlock shares what lube remains on his hand with John’s shaft. He explores all the differences in skin texture available to him with John’s propensity to sleeping nude – something he had been happy to be surprised by. Beneath the flannel and the vests and the cardigans, John is a true sensualist. He revels in Sherlock’s focussed attention and curious explorations. Sherlock has no idea why he ever assumed that John would be a reserved bedmate and is happy to have been proved utterly wrong in this one instance.
"What?" Sherlock demands.
Surprised and pleased, John settles into his chair and stretches his feet to the fire. They watched this film last month and John thought that Sherlock had slept through most of it, but apparently he’d been listening. John cannot stop his contented smile, as happy as he’s been in months. This might not be what he’d imagined for his life as a younger man, but it’s immeasurably more than he’d expected after his return from Afghanistan.
"Clearly," Sherlock spits, venomously. If Mummy can text him a message, calling him home, complete with a Christmas tree emoji and a smiley face, then by this time tomorrow his brother’s inbox will be bursting with cat videos and who knows what else? His cousin seems to be hell bent on ruining his life, although his campaign to win John away from Sherlock's side appears to be less successful than he had first feared.
“Hello,” John says, forcing a smile onto his face. “I’m a bit lost. Can you point me in the direction of A& E?”
“I don’t know what you want to hear, Mycroft. The only thing I am sure of is that it has nothing to do with you. So unless you want to try to intimidate me with vague threats and menaces along the lines of the ‘if you ever hurt him I will make you regret it’ variety, I suggest you piss off and focus your surveillance on people who are a real threat to your brother.”
“And I’m…”
"Can I see?" John asks quietly.
It seems to encourage his friend to greater daring, and he slowly rubs his bottom lip across John’s top one and touches the very tip of his tongue against the bottom one before pulling back a little.
…deep, deep, God, yes, but slowly. John shivers a little at the sensation and his breath hitches the tiniest bit before evening out again. Sherlock carefully wedges his thigh beneath John’s and plants his foot on the bed, holding John open to him. It means he cannot move so well, but this isn’t the goal of this morning’s activity.
). The hollow half-life he endured for two years (
Sherlock sticks his head around the door and peers at John for a moment before disappearing again. He’s aware that might have happened a few times – he’s not really processing time very well at the moment, missing slices of activity when things magically appear or disappear. In one of his more dynamic moments, John decides that the fire looks very inviting and he half walks, half crawls to the hearth and closes his eyes to soak up the radiant heat.
Sherlock is definitely not having that. He swiftly crosses the room and pastes on a smile and cheerfully addresses his cousin.
John is simply content to be kissed. And if Sherlock wants to catalogue his reactions or his mannerisms or the bits of him that Sherlock hasn’t had access to previously, then he’s fine with that too. He’s never been afraid by Sherlock’s uncanny focus, the way his head will tilt and his eyes will flit from point to point as he finds the information he needs about someone. He’s never hidden his affection for his friend – only how deeply it runs and how much of it there is, relying on Sherlock’s inexperience in such matters to keep his secret for him.
Sherlock shakes more emphatically each time John guesses and then waits while John joins up the mental dots.
The man’s voice is deep, perfectly modulated and doesn’t hold even a hint of a French accent. John instinctively moves to comply with the request before he has time to consider that he probably shouldn’t trust a man who is in his garden before breakfast, armed with sharp objects and trying to persuade a football sized clump of bees to get in a box while destroying all his hard work in the process.
“Oh, I don’t stay for too long. She’s lovely, Cathy, but she can barely boil an egg, and that husband of hers, once he’s into the sherry…” She trails off with a grimace. “But how about you boys? Sherlock tells me you’re leaving tomorrow. You haven’t been to his parent’s house before, have you?”
supposed to mean?"
"Harder," John insists.
“I have no earthly idea. Perhaps you should…”
“I said that you are, but don’t pay it any mind.”
clever,” John insists, watching as Sherlock closes and locks the front door.
And here's the really big question, the one that John has to persuade himself to even entertain. It's nuts surely? It's unlikely in the extreme, but...
His manner has changed completely and John just cannot understand what has happened. “Look,” he says, standing his ground. “I’m sorry if I’ve said the wrong thing…”
"Of course. Why wouldn't it be?" Sherlock barks his eyes flashing at John's impertinence.
“So… s...sssso so you, uh, you meant it… what you said last night,” Sherlock clarifies, having to force his voice into a lower register when it emerges high pitched, panicked and ridiculous. “It’s not a joke or a delusional episode. You really meant… mean it?”
The longer he waits, the longer he keeps chasing those words, the more the distance between them and his thoughts grows. It is a strangely familiar sensation but Sherlock cannot pin down why that should be. Even John cannot always hide his frustration when Sherlock refuses to even attempt to speak.
“And if I were to ask for your hand in marriage and for wild and wonderful sexual relations between us?”
There’s tea on the coffee table, recently made, a fire laid in the hearth but not yet put to the match, his coat drying on the hook, and the rugby’s on with the TV turned almost down to silent.  John’s laptop is on the desk, open to his blog. Sherlock’s violin and bow are lying across his chair.  It’s like a theatre scene of their life, waiting for the actors to take to the stage, anticipation, excitement and fear in balance that a breeze or a feather’s weight could throw off.
Sherlock lifts his chin and gasps. He’s not gentle in his efforts to complete anymore and John revels in it. For a wiry, slim man, he has a lot of hidden strength and solidness, and he's using every ounce of it now in an effort to bring them both off.
Right now.
. John uses... used... his blog to express things that he found hard to put into speech, but unless you lived it with him and knew where to look, you would never know his mind nor his heart from what you read.
“Sherlock…”
He doesn’t want to be her husband even if she is the mother of his child.
“My clothes are boring? Well, what do you suggest?” John grinned at him, loving the playful side of Sherlock’s personality that had come out of hiding since they became flatmates. The humour and warmth that underlay Sherlock’s crisp diction and single-minded practicality was so obvious to him now that some days it amazed John that no one else saw what he saw – a brilliant man, a man who had almost superhuman focus when required, but who also had a gentle side, a wicked, dry sense of humour and a vulnerability that he hid with insults, sharp words and withering glares.
"Sherlock!"
Sherlock steps into the embrace easily and without hesitation. For a lanky git and a skinny one, they fit together surprisingly seamlessly. Sherlock's cheek rests on John's head and John's cheek fits onto Sherlock's shoulder as if they have been doing it their whole lives. Downstairs the string quartet are tuning up and the first guests are beginning to arrive. The unmistakable burble of happy voices steals into their quiet. They must have been here longer than they thought.
Sherlock prepares to have to lie completely still all night, sure that sleep is not going to come for him this night.
“Peacocks?” Sherlock mutters, affronted and John shrugs. “No, John, no peacocks, although some of Mycroft’s waistcoats are almost as garish.”
"And now... it's your turn to share," John says with a shade too much colour in his voice.
Upstairs the light in Sherlock’s bedroom goes out too, plunging the little back garden into darkness. She hasn’t scried to see further, but the oppressive feeling of the last few weeks is gone and Martha knows that whatever critical point they were approaching has been averted, putting a new path in front of them. Who knows where that will take them? But they are safe for now and Martha is satisfied with that. Just a nudge in the right direction is all it took.
“Well tell me now because I’m starting to think that you’re regretting bringing me here.”
“Not my type,” he said with a cheeky glance at Sergeant Sahai, whose first name he couldn’t even recall now. “Too high-maintenance for me.”
Sherlock nodded and made toward the door.
“I wouldn’t want them to think that their son had been living with some ill-bred idiot,” John admits.
“The position… as the love of your life… I accept.” Sherlock smiles and watches for John’s understanding.
He pulls John into the adjoining bathroom, all old white porcelain and chrome, puts the plug in the decadently huge bathtub and turns on the taps to fill it. The tiles are cool under John's bare feet and when Sherlock pulls him into his arms, engulfing him in those deceptively strong limbs, it underlines the difference in their heights and in the temperature. Sherlock’s skin is warm and slightly blushed where they have been worshiping each other. He leans down and tips John's chin up with a long, insistent finger to kiss him, thoroughly and slowly.
John quickly went to his knees, using both hands now to straighten the fabric enough to lower the zip and expose Sherlock’s bulging boxers, the smooth, rosy crown of his cock already peeking above the waistband.
as he tastes the bitter flavour of it on his lips before it’s even said.
As she shuts her bedroom door, she thinks that maybe when she’s back from Cathy’s, she will look into some soundproofing – and she doesn’t need any skill at all to know that will be quite a good investment.
As his breathing settles, Sherlock moulds a word in his mind. He considers how it would shape the breath, how he might breathe it into John’s consciousness. He knows John won’t stay for long like this; he has often demonstrated his preference for ‘a bit of air’ when Sherlock has tried his patience too far and he predicts with ninety-six per cent certainty that it will be John’s next move.
“John?” Sherlock asks softly, a hesitance in his voice that he rarely reveals. It squeezes the breath from John’s lungs to hear his friend so uncharacteristically uncertain and he turns, forcing a rueful smile onto his face.
>>><<<
"Oh yes? Family or...?"
“Well, only…” John’s hesitation earns him a lift of the older Holmes’ eyebrows. “…one. You can’t mean…”
There's a rather telling lull in Crispain's endless prattling as they pull on their coats and boots in the hall and step out into the winter's afternoon. The clouds have completely chased away any blue in the sky now, a strange yellow tinge to them that Sherlock recognises from childhood winters. The cold air encourages them to walk faster on the way to the pub on the green, about half a mile away. It's a small place, mostly undiscovered by tourists and it's more akin to stepping into someone's sitting room than a hostelry, but it's out of the wind and there's a fire glowing in the grate. The savoury smell in the air makes John's stomach rumble audibly.
But what if he didn’t?
“… so I had to go with the tried and tested bottle of good Port and a Stilton. I don’t want them to think that I’m without social graces,” John finishes, selecting another titbit from the plate and placing it neatly in his mouth.
"I'd decided not to propose that night at the Landmark, you know. Mary had gone off to the loo and I sat there with the ring in my pocket and I knew I was asking her for all the wrong reasons."
Sherlock takes a few steps, his shoes a sharp scrape against the softer sounds of the branches. He pulls his gloves from his pocket and works them onto his fingers, smoothing the leather snugly against his wrists. Turning, he takes in John’s slumped shoulders, the way his elbows rest on his knees, the way his head hangs. John Watson is the biggest short man in London, but you wouldn’t know it now. He has taken down men more than a foot  taller than him, faced down serial killers and taken the piss out of the British government to his face. John Watson is not intimidated or diminished by anything that Afghanistan or London has thrown at him, but to look at him now it would be easy to assume that he has been defeated in most every sense of the word.
He breathes out a sigh. “He wanted to know how you were getting on, since you’ve been back.”
Sherlock’s not sure if he wants to vomit or sing, suddenly. But that could also be the liver.
His days begin to grow a pattern. He eats an early breakfast and watches the daylight creep across the property until the kitchen garden is bathed in sun when he pulls on a jumper and his jacket and boots and goes out to do battle with whichever bed has caught his attention that morning. He hoes and weeds and turns the soil, he works around things he recognises (raspberry canes, gooseberries and some kind of plum) and prunes the plants that are overgrown. He barrows what he’s cleared to the compost or to the bonfire he has begun to construct for the thicker branches and the brambles.
>>>>><<<<<
Instead of finishing his checks and saying his usual goodnight (sometimes with a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and once, when he thought he was asleep, gentle fingers slowly carded through his hair) John returns to the sitting room with two glasses and a bottle of whiskey.
"What? Oh... yeah. Yeah, maybe," he agrees absently, his eyes straying back to the countryside sliding past the window. “Good idea.”
John comes into the kitchen twenty minutes after Sherlock had staked a claim to the corner of the table closest to the range. His mother is busy sorting recipes and texting to her friends (and Sherlock will make Chrispian pay for that at some point) and Father is writing letters. He does have a study to do this in, but like Sherlock, clearly has a preference for this room. They both look up when John enters and Mummy insists on making tea.
Sherlock breathes in sharply through his nose and holds it while John settles again to see how that went down. He watches Sherlock’s face for any trace of discomfort or disgust but his eye only flicker shut and his cheeks, already pink from sleep, flush further, spreading the colour across his jaw and down his throat.
, which John doesn't recognise until he hears the melody. He hums along again, not knowing how the lyrics fit into the complicated rhythm. Both Mycroft and Sherlock seem to know it quite well and John ends up watching the Holmes brothers studiously ignoring each other while doing anything so deeply embarrassing as singing in public. John wonders if they had ever been choristers and spends an amusing couple of verses imagining Mycroft and Sherlock scowling in cassocks and cottas, all scrubbed up by Mummy on a Sunday morning. Somehow he doubts it, but it amuses him all the same.
“Right,” Steve nodded. “Well, this is Andrew, he’s head of development. Then we have Claude, David, Matt, Jo, Kitty and Josh over in the corner there, Dave, Dave, Ray, Rob, Charlie and Will,” he chanted as he turned in a tight clockwise circle, pointing out each programmer in turn. A few of them nodded or raised a hand in greeting, a couple of them avoided eye contact altogether and one or two didn’t seem to have noticed his arrival at all.
Enough.
Sherlock’s eyes slide away as dull, remembered pain flares within his ribs.
to stretch out a hand and burn with him. It’s as if Sherlock has been unmasked, the facade stripped away revealing only the most honest and quintessential expression of the man – alive, unguarded, human and surprisingly vulnerable.
There is already a group of well-bundled people standing in the gold light that pours from the pub they have already frequented once today. They seem a merry bunch and Sherlock has suspicions that some of them may have already been inside to wet their whistles, so to speak. They are handed sheets of lyrics and lanterns or candles in repurposed jam jars. It's all very 'Merrie England' and John catches Sherlock's grimace and laughs at him.
How could he have possibly thought Sherlock incapable of loving him? This collection of notes show more care and attention than John has been the recipient of in many years. To know that Sherlock was aware that John struggled as they slid back into their old lives. To know that he’d found a way – the only way he could express his concern for him that wouldn’t make it more awkward for John, to share his music with him, like love letters without a signature.
With a carefully hissed breath Sherlock exhales and John can feel him harden further. He pushes into John’s thigh in a gesture that appears to be involuntary. This movement brings Sherlock’s hip and stomach closer and John cannot help the way his body arches as they brush together. Sherlock too seems unable to ignore the sensory feedback from this gentle sway they have begun and he chases it.
John seems unconvinced by Sherlock’s weak assurances, but shifts the conversational topic elsewhere. He’s begun to test Sherlock, ensuring that no other memories of their time together have been corrupted by his head injury. Sherlock doesn’t tell him about his mind palace and the ruin he fears will greet him on his next visit. Sherlock doesn’t tell him anything, full stop.
His shoulder screams in protest as he inches his way to the door and flicks the locking mechanism. Sherlock falls inside by the light of a new volley and the roar of fresh explosions. He’s soaked through, but John grabs him and drags him back to the corner where he has  less exposure. Is it blood? His hair is plastered to his head with it and he’s lost his uniform. He drips onto John’s skin, but it’s cold and it smells clean and…
“Don’t bother,” Sherlock smiled. “I plan on wearing them quite regularly from now on. They’re quite useful for relieving boredom as it turns out.”
John had wondered if, now they were married, that things would settle down. He's heard that commitment and stability often take the place of spontaneity and variety, particularly in the bedroom. They have been together for several years and while their sex life has varied, sometimes loving and familiar, other times pushing boundaries, John is still surprised by the way Sherlock responds to him. For a man who lives so much in his own head, when Sherlock does deign to come down from that lofty tower, he's an enthusiastic and vocal advocate of the physical side of their life together. John had worried that his husband’s usual disregard for his transport might make reaching him harder; he need not have worried. John makes no attempt to hide that he finds Sherlock desirable and Sherlock has eagerly responded to John's admiration and assured John that the sentiment is mutual. This game that they play with the dressing up is only a tiny part of their relationship, but one that they both seem to gain a lot of pleasure from.
“Well, we can’t return it like that! We ought to take it back to London, see if we can get your dry-cleaner to have a crack at it.”
John rolls onto his front and tries not to groan as his cock takes an interest and swells fruitlessly against the mattress.
"Brilliant," he murmurs, grinning. "You are... that's brilliant. Amazing." His familiar face is suffused with admiration and, once again, Sherlock notes that his own breath is uneven.
not helping his search.
“And Angelo sends his regards. Says he’s looking forward to seeing you as soon as you’re up to it,” John reports, watching Sherlock carefully but not overtly.
“John, in a few years I’d very much like… when we retire, I thought....”
Sod pretending. Sod the ‘who is fooling who’ game. This feels fucking fantastic. Every time with Sherlock is different as the madman tries his latest scheme to make John lose his mind through lust, but the early morning, slow, sweet fuck when Sherlock had pounded him hard the night before is John’s favourite.
for John’s phone and send fulsome thanks to Bill. John was right all along; he really is a very wise man.
John has a terrible but familiar sinking feeling in his stomach and he can’t help scanning the bookshelves to try to spot the camera that Sherlock must have missed last time he swept the flat.
"No, that's fine," John insists. "We'd love to help out."
He tugged on Sherlock’s knees a little, moving him further back from the headboard and Sherlock instinctively dipped his upper body, presenting himself for John’s attentions.
John could feel the tension of his orgasm begin to build, tightening the muscles of his thighs and his belly, it hummed beneath his skin and spread a buzzing heat prickling up his sweaty spine, pulling him tighter and tighter before breaking over him and tumbling him into sweet release.
"What's wrong with them?
"There is a completely reasonable explanation for that," John begins, but there is a matching smile tugging at the corner of Sherlock's mouth and John straightens as he realises that he has just played straight into his flatmate's hands.
As the sun sets, the distant rumbles begin. It’s too warm to do anything, too distracting to read. The storm is far enough away that he isn't  able to see lightning but John swears he can feel the static dancing along his arms and shoulders. He paces from room to room, stopping at the windows to stare out for a few moments before resuming his patrol. He feels like he can’t get a full breath.
He does the only thing that he can think of and kisses John again. He tries to pour everything that’s been trapped on his tongue into the kiss – gratitude, reassurance and resolve. It’s not sexual, it’s not possessive or demanding. And, miraculously, John seems to understand some of that because when Sherlock straightens up and watches him warily, he nods again, just once.
Sherlock tips his head to one side, his eyes soft but inquisitive. He wets his lips and hesitates. “The thing with my sleeve the day before yesterday… when my sleeve brushed your wrist when you were playing and again, just now… you… do you know you do that all the time?”
"Why am I surprised that you're not surprised?" John asks after a few moments of uncomfortable silence.
"Sentiment?" John asks, his eyes wide, his shock only half-feigned.
“Your flat is sold - you’ll be needing a place to stay. I have a nice little place in Central London. Together we should be able to make it work.” Sherlock’s heart is hammering in his chest and his throat is drying alarmingly.
He turns his head and sees that the book is no longer there. Suddenly, there is a timeframe to all of this. With a shudder, Sherlock pulls himself away from the door, sucking in a breath he’d been delaying for too long. He crawls the few metres to the sofa and hoists himself onto the worn seat.
“Easy for you to say,” John counters weakly, cross at being so transparent yet again.
It’s been five long days since Sherlock woke to find himself in the Critical Care Unit of the Royal London with a slightly battered but reassuringly alive John Watson at his side. Bruised but not broken, John’s arm is already out of his sling although Sherlock can tell it has exacerbated the pain from his old Afghanistan injury. Other than his head injury, Sherlock has a broken rib and a broken clavicle, a torn labrum in his shoulder socket which may or may not require surgery at a later date.
Either way, Sherlock is enjoying it enormously, and as a bonus, it is making Mycroft unutterably uncomfortable, to the extent that he has taken to calling ahead when he visits, giving Sherlock ample time to either vacate the vicinity or, his personal favourite, initiate sex with John, making it inescapably apparent to Mycroft what they have just been doing. John hasn’t caught on to that yet, but for an idiot, he’s pretty damn smart, so Sherlock needs to… Oh! Or maybe he
"Sherlock, how lovely to see you. John here has just been getting me up to speed with all your exploits. I must say it all sounds rather thrilling and a tiny bit reckless," he says with an ingenuous smile.
He feels, ridiculously, like he should sign the paper even though John has his head at an angle, reading wherever he can get a line of sight. Sherlock nudges the paper around and John reaches out to tip the pad so he can see it better. He must read it through at least twice for all the time that it’s taking him and Sherlock studies his face, up close, as he does.
"Already anticipated. They are en route."
“Sherlock?”
“If Mycroft has…”
Sherlock is well aware of the course of events that have brought him to be sitting here today, listening to a sweet but deluded old lady who just wants a happy ending that doesn’t exist. He doesn’t need his failings listed - his mind shares them with him relentlessly.
He’s been playing a lot recently, although he almost always stops when he knows that John has arrived home. Sherlock’s habits haven’t really changed since they returned to Baker Street, merely intensified and many-a-night, John has woken to quiet string accompaniment – never enough to rouse him for more than a few minutes and he’s always slipped back into sweeter dreams than he’d been having. Sherlock never used to take care to play only the most restful scores before. That’s something John has been turning over and over in his mind for a few months now but he’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
,  for goodness sake!) But he’s a good boy underneath all of the bluff and bluster and he deserves to be happy – and that means John Watson.
One word at a time; each a small battle won.
Sherlock grunts and allows the praise. He doesn't comment as John comes level with him and they stand quietly watching the moon try to glow through the worsening fog. It's the kind of cold that almost hurts your nose and cheeks, pinching exposed skin with icy fingers. It feels surprisingly good after standing in a warm, stuffy room with so many strangers. The muffled noise of the partygoers sounds happy and animated, but John has no desire to rejoin them while Sherlock is out here.
… is…”
“Away you go then,” he gestures avoiding John’s gaze.
Sherlock knows that feeling. "I imagine we’ll muddle through. How are you, John? How... are things?"
Mrs Hudson must have picked up on the sudden quiet, and she changes topic, turning to John. “Did you find something for Sherlock’s parents, dear? I know you were looking.”
Someone made an off-colour joke about them at New Scotland Yard today - he only caught the end of it as he was returning with a couple of coffees –and it was nothing he hadn’t heard before, the usual insinuations and assumptions, but for some reason, today he responded.
dispensed with, Sherlock announces that he will take John upstairs to where they are sleeping and unpack. John tries to offer help with the preparations, causing a twitch in Sherlock's eyelid that cannot be terribly attractive, but he is shooed away by Mummy, so he grabs his bag from the hall and follows up to their room.
“John?” he asks quietly, his eyebrows drawing down in puzzlement.  “I find myself… Is it acceptable to want to do this again immediately?”
to keep up.”
to sound awful, he doesn’t sound as diabolical as this.
"So what does your therapist require this time?" Sherlock asks more sharply than he intended. The vulnerability and wash of unwelcome emotion makes him feel scattered and stretched thin - if he starts the offensive then it might make John think twice before laying himself bare again as he did last week. Sherlock has replayed John's intensity and his distress many times in the last days - if John isn't keeping up his half of the bargain then how can Sherlock be expected to keep his? It was one of the rules of their life together - they didn't talk about the things that happened between them. Words spoken in the heat of the moment had been just so much hot air in the new light of the following morning, no promises pledged or expected. If John wanted to change those rules now, then Sherlock would need a damn good reason why - they have kept him afloat in the typhoon that their lives have become since.
The liver slips further out of the forceps and Sherlock has to do a quick shuffle to keep it on his tools, holding it at an angle and trying not to breathe too deeply as the smell really is getting rather pungent.
"Oh yeah," John smiles reflexively, glad to have got away with his slightly voyeuristic thoughts without embarrassing himself. "We used to... Wait. How did you know it was the librarian?"
Sherlock smiles as he presses one more kiss to John’s shoulder, so he will feel it.
"But you don't have a sexual partner now?"
"No, I'm fine. You?"
Mrs Hudson just rolled her eyes at him and closed the door behind her. She still hadn’t forgiven them for the ‘unlocked door’ incident, John thought and felt the inevitable blush that accompanied his memories of
thing to say in social situations. They used to argue good naturedly about how inane small talk and rote conversational set-pieces used to irritate him. Sherlock said it was a waste of his breath. John said it was polite. And, clearly, that’s what they are now. Polite. Cordial, perhaps.
“No, he’s not. You’ve both brought a world of hurt down upon yourselves and each other but… whatever happens next… don’t doubt what you both felt. Don’t ignore what was good, no matter how things stand now. ”
John grunts. “I don’t think I can be held responsible for the convoluted workings of your psyche. It’s not my fault if you adore me so much that you need two of me to satisfy your massive ego,” he smirks, his voice loving and amused.
“Sherlock, I wasn’t…” John began gently, turning his face to hide it from the other men in the room, keeping his voice low and half an eye on Anderson.
“Then why the hell are we in Sussex?” John hissed, then smiled in his most non-threatening manner for the tiny girl who was leading an enormous bloody horse – and how was that a polo
cooking.  John has caught his eye a couple of times and given him a grin or a wink, or raised his eyebrows in question, but he seems unruffled by the attention – if anything, he seems to be pleased by Sherlock’s unsubtle regard.
before the collecting tins go round and their voices are joined by the clink of coins being donated by the pub clientele. Apparently the donkeys are a cause worth supporting.
James Horner's "Rooftop Kiss" from the Amazing Spiderman Soundtrack was playing on a loop while I wrote this - in case you want some mood music to read by.
They grab coats from the hooks by the front door, waxed jackets that are warm and thorn-proof, pull on some stout footwear and head out to retrieve the wheelbarrow and some ancient gardening tools from the shed. Returning to the house, Sherlock can see that Crispian has still not reappeared.
John won’t catch Sherlock’s eye as he passes him and heads back into the kitchen. Sherlock can feel the hundred questions he wants to ask like a mouthful of soil. His very tongue feels choking and too solid, becoming more dense with his desire to speak and not allowing him to catch enough breath to even begin. He wrestles with his choice; without his voice, he allows
Thrusting two hot paper cups into her hands and ignoring her protest, John followed.
Sherlock emits a scornful huff which would be more effective if he weren't in just his underwear and shirt.
to the man. He’d recognised his own atypical reaction to John but hadn’t understood its significance. Idiot.
With a hand between his shoulder blades, John encouraged Sherlock to lean forward onto his elbows on the desk. He put aside the little plastic bottle he found where Sherlock said it would be and took a deep, calming breath as he slid his hands up Sherlock’s body, pushing aside the crisp, white linen of his shirt to reveal his back in all its angular glory. He licked a stripe up Sherlock’s spine, watching as the skin of his flanks tightened into goose pimples.
Years from now, when they are both older than Sherlock's parents are today, it won't be the clothes or the lack of music or rings that they recall about tonight.
"Just one last thing, Sherlock.”
“Shhh,” John replies. “I’m learning you.” He sweeps a hand over Sherlock’s shoulder and down the warmth of his back, feeling bone and muscle and more of that thrumming tension that John aims to eradicate.
life?”
When his phone pings, John nearly drops it in his hurry to see the message.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and gave John an appraising once over. “Would you describe your ensemble today as
a stupid man. Nor is he, but he is, shall we say,
“Well, of course not! You have become vital to my work and the smooth running of 221B. I have become accustomed to your personality quirks and we have found a mutually acceptable way to cohabit. It would be detrimental to practically all areas of my life should you leave.”
“Not quite,” John grits.
John dipped hot, shaky fingers inside the damp cotton and pulled him out, overwhelmed for a moment by the familiar, delicious scent of Sherlock. Unable to help himself he pressed his face between Sherlock’s legs and breathed deeply. God, how he’d missed him. It was ridiculous!
By the time John’s thoughts have crystalised into something coherent, he is already in position holding a large wooden box beneath the seething mass of insects.
It’s Taylor-Coleridge;
John laughs, high and unforced. “But I’m not uncouth!”
His orgasm is a tangible impending event, he can feel it already begin to uncoil low in his belly, but there is no hurry, no urgency to it when they share like this. It’s why Sherlock loves to wake up early, like this. He hums his pleasure and…
“Please… J… John.”
“I don’t have a lot of history with… well, any of this kind of thing, but please don’t mistake my hesitance for anything but lack of experience.”
Then Sherlock’s hands were on him, turning him to face the bunks, bent from the waist while he rocked against John, his zipper and pants down and his cock snugged between the cheeks of his arse, dragging through the prickle of fresh sweat there. After a minute of desperate breathing, Sherlock pulled back and John knew from his soft noises and the steadying hand on his back that Sherlock was close. He felt him stiffen behind him and then the spatter of warmth across his arse and up his back and shirt.
Crispian tips his head, gesturing to the tree with his (weak) chin.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock!” John yelps, clearly having arrived without Sherlock becoming aware of him, once again. He  crosses the room in three strides and runs his hands over Sherlock’s unresisting frame, seeking out injuries or answers.
“Up we get then,” Sherlock interrupts, having noticed the twitching curtains at Mrs Turner’s window, probably the source of the police’s information. Reaching down to hook an arm under John’s shoulder, he hauls him to his feet. John just stands and sways gently, beaming at him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John wasn’t blind, and he saw the way he preened a little as he stood for John’s approval, tucking himself cautiously back into his jeans but leaving the buttons unfastened.
The clatter of a several hundred pound’s worth of plastic and glass landing badly is like harsh punctuation. They stand face to face, breathing hard in the cool, quiet air of their untidy sitting room. The pale light of morning feels as fragile as their friendship, right now.
This is Sherlock's room.
Now his revised domestic arrangements boast the added incentive of having John Watson in his bed, the hours seem to get away from him quite frequently.
But John can.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock agreed. “And it was a ‘her’, but I’m ninety-nine per cent certain that she is unaware that she is doing it. I need to report back to Mycroft and let him know that the instructions she is following are coming from elsewhere, disguised in a call routing protocol.”
The next thing Sherlock knows is that it is close to dawn, and he has slept well and deeply. He's surprised, and checks his watch on the bedside table. Sure enough, the sun is only the merest hint in the sky, still below the horizon but steadily pushing away at the darkness.
“No, Sherlock. Just because I want to… be intimate with you, doesn’t mean that you have to… it doesn’t work like that…”
"I'm glad too. He's the best thing that ever happened to me. I am honoured that he asked."
Clearing his throat, Sherlock steps forward a little unsteadily and accepts the envelope Mrs Hudson hands to him.
Sherlock sits up suddenly. It forces John to take a step back or get smacked in the chin; he hadn't realised quite how far he’d been bent over the prone figure of his flatmate whose eyes are suddenly intent and assessing.
Sherlock hums thoughtfully but doesn’t relinquish his hold on John. “My father. He and Mummy have been staying in town for a couple of days. They went to the theatre and he slipped on the ice on the way out. He’s being settled on the ward now – they had to operate to reset the ankle.”
But Sherlock was testy, tired after his walk and still stretching towards the fire in an effort to dispel the last of the chill from his bones. He wouldn’t want John pawing him, coming over all cave man on him just because he’d chosen to wear something his own wardrobe lacked.
"... when all the decorations and lights come down. Yeah, my family were superstitious about that too. That must have been rough. In my house everyone was grumpy for a couple of days after the house got all dull again."
) arms. Watching the world turn grey as they lifted him away (
"I said! He's nice! He lives in London and he suggested we meet up for coffee one day."
John pulls back to look at Sherlock with an expression the latter has never seen before and cannot even begin to pick apart. All that he knows is that it is not unequivocally delighted.
Sherlock turns a sharp look at their landlady, who seems to have a very good grasp of their likes and dislikes for an elderly woman with a daytime TV habit and a sweet if scatty demeanour. She seems oblivious to his scrutiny, twittering on about oven gloves and… something dull. Sherlock tunes her out. Either she is much more observant than she lets on, she snoops when he and John are out or she has coincidentally scored two direct hits on the private minutiae of Sherlock and John’s life together.
John smells the tea before the door is even fully opened grounding him back firmly in a poorly lit side room of an NHS hospital in the arms of his best friend. Surprisingly it’s Mycroft who is carrying two mugs and John briefly wonders if he has dropped off again. Mycroft requests tea and then usually forgets to even taste it – he doesn’t fetch it for people.
He sits beside Sherlock on the bed, picks up his hand and plays idly with his fingers, learning the texture of his string calluses and the shape of his knuckles. Sherlock watches and follows John when he shifts across the mattress to lie down on his side, facing him.
“That’s good, isn’t it? He certainly seems to have picked up where he left off. Back to his old self, wouldn’t you say?”
Sherlock just blinks at her - she will, eventually, go away if he doesn’t interact. It’s a tactic he has employed before. But her perspicacity has surprised him. He has immersed himself in his work, and to the outside world, that must look as it always has - he has taken great pains to make it so. What can have alerted her to his inner struggles when he has assured himself that his behaviour has not deviated superficially?
There’s a silence and the  corner of John's mouth twitches.
He doesn't know what he was expecting, but it wasn't this bone deep longing or the way his mood lifts and his heart beats more lightly beneath his ribs when he is in John's company. And he looks good, his hair is a little more grey and the bags under his eyes are a little more full, but the cycling has tanned his face and toned his muscles, the weight loss has trimmed him too, though he probably shouldn't lose more. His smiles come more easily now and his hands, so eloquent of John's state of mind, are quiet. And that's when Sherlock notices that John's wedding ring is gone.
And there they are on a Friday afternoon in Sherlock's childhood bedroom, grinning at each other like idiots as the bustle and barely suppressed chaos of the impending party swirls up from downstairs and in through the window. The sun is already on its downward path and the sunlight is thick between them. Lazy dust motes circle and it seems that time has held its breath for them, giving them a moment to consider all the unlikely happenings and tiny, everyday coincidences that have focussed down to this one point - insignificant to most everybody else on the planet but them.
"You promised her, brother mine. Do not make me have to listen to her complaints or the next time they want to see something by Andrew Lloyd Webber, I shall insist that it's something you wanted especially to see yourself." It takes Mycroft's face a few seconds to recover from having to say the popular composer's name, twisted as it was by undisguised disdain.
“If I were to say that I didn’t want a physical relationship, only your companionship and your assistance on cases, you would be content with that?”
John is the one person in the world that Sherlock might consider the possibility of being in love with. If pressed. That’s… surprising.
Sherlock slumped down across John’s, the weight of him grounding and welcome. With a contented sigh, Sherlock stood, trailing a hand down John’s back, as if unwilling to lose contact entirely. He ran his fingers through the mess, rubbing it into John’s skin in a possessive gesture that made him shiver. John loved how deliberate it was, and how he would never be able to wear this shirt again without thinking of this moment. This would always be the shirt that Sherlock had picked out for him that had a part of Sherlock forever soaked into the weave of the fabric. In other words, John’s new favourite shirt.
Where had he got that drivel from? Probably Lestrade or Molly. Or one of those dreadful daytime TV shows that Hudders watches? It’s utter rubbish anyway; John should be staying here with him, solving crimes and being his conductor of light, making him tea and forcing him to eat pea-heavy dinner dishes, giving him someone to play his violin for and laughing at his jokes.
John climbs awkwardly out of the bath, trying to ignore the insistent bob and twitch of his cock that is feeling rather unappreciated. He leaves Sherlock to wash away the evidence and walks back into their bedroom wondering if he can maybe sneak back into the bathroom when Sherlock finally gets out of the tub, and take care of his predicament. But he should have known better than to think that Sherlock of all people would have omitted to notice something like that. Before he's even reached into the wardrobe for clean underwear, his fiancé has plastered himself up against John's back, his long arms curling around John's waist and his chin propped on his shoulder, looking into John's face via the reflection in the mirror on the back of the wardrobe door.
His boyfriend, then? Can people their age even have 'boy'friends? He needs to check the nomenclature.
Sherlock grunts at the thrill of discomfort and pleasure, and John swears he is feeling the phantom of what Sherlock is experiencing - like a sympathetic reaction to the sensations he can see reflected on his husband's face. Sherlock's hand works faster and faster over his crown; John can hear the slap of his skin and the sticky slick of his palm.
Smiling against his nape, Sherlock experiences John’s orgasm as a series of intense pulses, those captured in his palm and those deep within John’s body.
Movement in the street below brings John back into the moment. A car has slid into the side of another parked further down the road. Although the crash was loud, no one seems to be injured and neither car appears to have sustained too much damage.
It's all John can do not to jump him right here , right now. God, please don't let him be wrong about this. " And you believe he is interested in return?"
Maybe this is all about Sherlock wanting to know John better but not having the social skills necessary to get the information that he wants. Maybe John, unwittingly, is behaving in the same pattern as Donovan and Anderson and countless, faceless others who have rejected Sherlock based on how he is instead of seeing past that to
One morning John is returning from his walk when he sees the person from the Manoir at the bottom of the orchard. Curious enough to make a detour, John walks around the perimeter of the garden to get a closer look. Sure enough, the figure is male although John can’t really see much of the man’s face which is shaded by the brim of a straw hat screwed down over dark curls. John lingers, watching as the man paces out areas of his grass and scribbles things in a small notebook. He kneels down and closely observes the ground, leaning back to squint up at nearby trees and the cloud-obscured sun. He picks blades of grass and rubs pinches of soil between his fingers, and John wonders if perhaps the man is a little neurodivergent - his behaviour certainly seems quite hyper-focussed.
would also have done the trick. Of course on John it would have just come over as
to shoot you – that you survived was not her intention, it was simple luck.
“And, although your argument was well constructed and had some merit, I’m still not entirely convinced that it was worthy of a place on the team,” John interrupted.
Without a suit on, Sherlock tended to look about a decade younger - all eyes and angles and messed-up curls. How odd it was that seeing him in anything but his habitual suit had the side effect of drawing John’s attention to some of his favourite features of Sherlock’s face and body. And god! His lips… his lips were just impossibly perfect.
Sherlock's eyes, when his head snaps up, are wide and bright. "All good points, John, and I am getting dressed for the party."
No. No no no no.
Sherlock turns, following the direction of John’s gaze and is a little chagrined to find that the liver slice that he forgot last night has, in fact, made it to the toast rack and is trying to ease itself over the lip even now, dried and rancid as it is. He’d assumed the smell was a byproduct of John’s excesses last night.
John’s smile is ridiculous, but Sherlock can’t help but echo it. And really, it’s all getting much too saccharine in here, so Sherlock gently untangles their fingers and goes into the kitchen, ostensibly for water.
“So… are we good to go home?” A clandestine quickie was a marvellous thing, but it didn’t hold a candle to a naked, pliant, happy-to-be-home consulting detective spread out on their bed.
Sherlock spins on his heel and regards John with something like delight. “Ahhhhh, Doctor! Of course! There’s always something,” he exclaims and turns back to the jars, diving to the opposite end of the wall. “That would explain the calluses. Surgeon?”
Guiding him down onto his bed, John lets himself be arranged, and clumsily, desperately seeks out Sherlock’s mouth again. He obliges him sweetly and John pulls at his body until it rests on top of his own. Sherlock gasps as his newly reawakened erection snugs against John’s belly and into the humid warmth between them. Almost curiously he bucks a little, settling himself more comfortably and John rests his hands on the swell of Sherlock’s arse, encouraging him to move against him.
Sherlock appreciates the way John moves at the best of times, all solid stance and marching gait, but here in their private space, he particularly enjoys watching John complete the most mundane tasks with his neat, economical movements and easy confidence. There is no pretence in John, no artifice. He is a man completely comfortable in who he is unless someone deliberately challenges his identity. Sherlock has always admired this about him and more than once he has marvelled that, despite his own superior intellect and the advantages of a more privileged childhood, it is he who dresses with such meticulous care, who swings between euphoria and boredom and finds his worth in the praise of others, not John.
John feels sick. There are things you don’t say, don’t mention even obliquely. It seems that those rules don’t apply to this man.
John recalls that Sherlock had not rated the solve of that particular episode nor relished the coverage that had come with it. He’s had cases he’d enjoyed more and some of those cases had got his name in the papers - so why has he chosen this particular press conference and this particular image?
“Then some food.”
There's a beat of silence before Sherlock speaks.
“On you? God, yes!” John panted, tipping his head so Sherlock could get a better angle.
Sherlock slunk off without another word, pausing to scowl at the Belstaff on the coat peg he had opted not to wear that day and sighing again as his shoes and socks made unpleasant squelching sounds at each step.
“I ought to check Dr Watson’s vitals,” a timid looking man is brandishing a blood pressure cuff, but already retreating in defeat at the glare that Sherlock must be levelling at him.
"That sounds like an excellent idea. We deserve a pint after all the creativity. "
"Here we are," John agrees and although he casts an unreadable gaze at Sherlock, he turns a genuine, if strained, smile towards Sherlock's cousin.
“Yeah.”
doctor," Sherlock replies.
"That's why humans invented questions," John growls. "When humans want to know things about other humans they bloody well ask questions. They don't wait until they're alone and then riffle through the other human's stuff.”
It's a bit more sheltered under the trees even though most of them are bare and John is glad of the windproof jacket now that the breeze has picked up and is piling up clouds.
Mummy offers them tea, coffee or hot chocolate at which Sherlock scoffs reminding her that he is a grown man now.
"Are you alright, John?" Violet asks, appearing silently at his shoulder - it must be another Holmes trait.
Sherlock rises and walks carefully towards the door. The sense of
John is prevented from asking anything more by Crispian, who chooses that moment to stand up and move to the front of the group. The pianist has kept her seat and waits for Crispian to pick up his instrument from the corner of the room to return and introduce his piece which he does with humour and humility and a sweet anecdote about spending time with Mr Holmes Senior when he was a child which had put him off the cello forever but opened up the world of his own instrument to him. Everyone laughs indulgently (except Sherlock who sighs none too quietly) and then listens as Crispian plays an achingly sweet and beautiful piece. John didn't even know that an oboe could sound so plaintive as that. So intense is the draw of the music that John notices even Sherlock stops fidgeting and listens.
Sherlock meanwhile returns to the contemplation of his dressing gown sleeve. " The same could be said of you."
John laughs aloud. “How do you know I haven’t just developed an interest in making preserves?”
"I'll admit I was taken aback, but having worn them today, I can honestly say that I have had trouble thinking about anything else. They are extremely... inspiring."
“I wasn’t attempting to be subtle. I was attempting to make you come back to bed and entertain me,” Sherlock drawled, confident in his charm and his ability to talk John into almost anything. And for a moment, John was so immensely proud of his unconventional, brilliant, endlessly fascinating boyfriend that he couldn’t speak. He’d come so far since their first tentative attempts to love each other, both physically and emotionally.
The blame is his, no matter the justification. John never forgave him for that, and even now, if anyone alludes to that time, John struggles to keep his composure. There is no doubt in his mind that the blame for the gulf between them now is as much his as John's.
Four minutes and one painfully long wait at a pedestrian crossing later, John burst through the door of 221 Baker Street and made Mrs Hudson squawk.
Thanking him, Sherlock takes his time stirring sugar into his coffee, embarrassingly relieved to have something constructive to do that will while away a few extra seconds, bringing him closer to the moment that he and John part ways once more. John's conscience will be salved and he’ll be able to go back to his perfectly nice life and say that he and Sherlock
Sherlock realises that his eyes are swimming with furious tears. Damned erratic emotions.
John waits for the front door to click closed before he drops his face into his hands and breathes. This is a lot to take in. Mycroft’s penchant for veiled threats and barely comprehensible parables is annoying at the best of times, and this… thing that is going on between him and Sherlock is not new; it has waxed and waned and almost flickered out a few times. It’s fragile and untested and John doesn’t know if he can gamble so much on its success. Because it’s everything he has. It’s everything he is.
Sherlock cannot fathom John's words. The sentiment behind them seems so wide and tall as to be unscalable and, even if he could, he doesn't think he should. He fixes his gaze on the path between them so he doesn't have to watch John struggle. This is so far beyond his realm of experience, he cannot even begin to parse a response. John hurt him - the first person in a long, long time to do so. Sherlock had not been equipped with either the resources to cope or the experience to put John's actions into a wider context. He tries not to think too closely on their estrangement even now; it only causes him to doubt his own actions and responses, which leads him to torturing himself with untried scenarios. 'What if' is a game that Sherlock has never wanted to play but it sometimes catches him in a low moment and torments him with an array of possible better outcomes.
Sherlock waits until John has had time to retire before he returns to the house. The lights are still spilling gold  from the windows like a ship's portholes on an ocean of white. The fog has dampened all noise and scents, and the cold is leaching through the soles of his shoes. Even the Belstaff isn't totally impervious to the creeping fingers of the chill - his suit was designed for evening attire, not winter temperatures.
“Haha, shuddup,” John replied. “You’re making it sound like I’m objectifying you. I love you for your personality and your intellect and your wit and your humanity, I’ll have you know.  It’s hardly my fault if you also look like…” He waved a hand that encompassed the length of his beloved, fluffy head to wriggling toes.
"We should be there by two. I can't imagine why we have to be there so early," Sherlock grumbles, studying John's watch with unwarranted focus.
“Well, there’s nothing wrong with my hearing either and you two can be awfully noisy.”
“When I jumped, John, it was never my intention that you would suffer. I misjudged the significance you placed upon our friendship. I considered it to be rather more one sided than it appeared to be. So when I heard that you… when you…”
It’s divine, this slow give and take, this shared exploration of cause and effect. He enjoys their post-case, too much adrenaline rutting and their need you now desperation, but this is something special.
He looks him up and down in a way that makes John’s skin prickle and get hot. “Give your therapist a call and cancel your next appointment. You clearly won’t be needing their services anymore.” He quirks half a smile at John’s blink of surprise. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes. The address is Le Manoir de Saint Barthélemy.  Good morning!” Posh and pretty winks at him… bloody
Throwing his coat and scarf at the sofa, he plucks the tiny electronic device between finger and thumb and disappears.
"Er... no. Where should I be looking?"
Gone are the smells of freshly cut grass and roses along with the background hum of bees. Instead, nonsense and static now assault him. It sounds as if it’s coming through the walls, or perhaps echoed from deep in the earth through the plumbing. Sherlock peers towards the sink, wondering if he is losing his grip on reality altogether.
John is only just out of the shower when he hears a car pull into the drive. He breathes calmly and recalls the exercises that his therapist gave him for when he felt symptoms. It helps a little and each time it does, he feels a little more in control of himself, rather than the mess of a man he was at first.
Sherlock tilts his head a little to guide John’s fingers to a neglected spot of his scalp. “When we first met, did you consider that we might never be more than flatmates or friends?”
there is no going back?
Sherlock’s brother isn’t capable of looking apologetic, but he does look resigned to whatever verbal assault he’s due as he stands on the threshold, silently asking permission to approach. When neither of them react, he enters and lets the door swing closed behind him. With no jacket, his shirtsleeves rolled up and his waistcoat unbuttoned, he looks almost human. He’s lost something of the governmental caricature and gained a bit of a personality. Just like Sherlock, underneath the intellect and the sneer Mycroft is fallible, imperfect and shockingly mortal.
It’s an exquisite sort of torture that what Sherlock craves the most compromises him the most. John’s attention. John’s proximity. John’s touch. He wants to tell the man to keep away, but he wants to tell him never to let go even more. He doesn’t know what he wants, and makes a strained noise. John smells of sleepy warmth and home and Sherlock’s shampoo where they shared a pillow, and it’s too much and not nearly enough. Sherlock turns into John’s shoulder, puts his arms around John’s body and hangs on tightly.
John had been amazed that there was enough of him left for anyone to notice, let alone claim to love. He had grasped her like a lifeline and she had listened to him explain his consulting detective and their extraordinary life together. John had thought her compassionate and supportive when all she’d been was another lie – a last line in the sand by what remained of Moriarty’s network; a sleeper cell strategically placed to intercept any scrap of information that might be of use to their dwindling number. And he’d fallen for it, and for her in a way. She’d made him feel again. He’d imagined himself to be worthy of life; if Mary thought him lovable, then perhaps he wasn’t as empty as he felt, perhaps if she believed that, then he might come to believe that too. So he’d planned to propose, like the idiot Sherlock had named him so frequently.
Mid-afternoon, and John finds himself with a glass of mulled cider, a large box of Christmas decorations and a consulting detective who is either doing long division in his head or is extremely uptight about something. His lip is getting a proper chewing and his quiet exasperated sighs are clear indications that Sherlock Holmes is not happy.
"I’ve made mistakes. I'm working through them. I'm making progress in a lot of the things that have held me back or influenced my thinking and it's not an easy process. To be frank, I bloody hate it. But I keep going because there's one thing I care about that I might be able to save out of all of this, one thing that maybe I haven't totally bollocksed up yet. And it's the most important thing. If it's over, then it's over. I won't stop going to therapy and I won't give up on life or anything so dramatic. But if I can save our friendship, then all of the bullshit and soul bearing and self analysis will be worth it."
“Sherlock,” he says softly. “I don’t think your bedroom is such a great idea for this conversation.”
John's mouth floods with saliva. Arousal hits him like a fist to the gut - he suddenly aches with the need to touch and taste and
He shakes his head and breathes. He knows the next words, but they are not easy although Sherlock thinks they should be. “You…” He breathes and works his jaw, his tongue. He swallows to relieve the tightness of his throat. He thinks of sweet smiles and ‘just because’ kisses and John’s fingers in his hair. “You. Loved. Me.”
Sherlock shakes his head, hoping John can feel it.
It’s still an utter disaster. It’s the last moment of his life with John and the first without him. It has to be.
Making it as far as the sitting room door, John forgoes taking off his coat and shoes in favour of leaning against the doorframe, relishing the warm prickle of blood slowly returning to his extremities while he lets the honey sweet, spiralling notes of Sherlock’s playing wash away the greyness and fatigue of his day and truly appreciate being home.
"Alright, we only have a few moments so here's the deal. I will carry on with my backache and take to my bed so as to clear the field for you to go and tell John that you love him."
It’s not quite the entirety of the truth, but it’s a start.
“Are we going to bed now?” John asks. “I’m knackered and it will warm you up.”
John has already drunk one... no, two mugs of tea and Sherlock isn't thirsty.
“I’m off to have a shower, then I’ll see about some dinner.” He shuffles towards the bathroom, carefully casual. “That Indian place you like, maybe?”
And so it goes for most of the afternoon - it's almost as if the man is avoiding him. John is sure he makes eye contact with his fiancé at one point but one of the catering staff crosses between them and when they pass, there's no Sherlock once again. John would quite like to hear about some of the guests here and there's no better storyteller than Sherlock. Not only does he know the history of many of these people as they are related, but he can supplement that with his deductive processes and his wicked sense of humour that often has John fighting to control himself in public when Sherlock has said something so sharp or outrageous that John cannot help but find it hilarious.
The neighbour’s garden is huge, and John vaguely recalls Mrs Hudson explaining that Harry’s house backs on to the property of the local manor house. John can’t see any sign of said house, but there is a man in the distance, striding around the grounds. John imagines that the manor employs a team of gardeners to manage the upkeep of the estate and wonders whether this is one of them. He lifts a hand to wave although it’s too far to see if the figure is looking at him, so John doesn’t feel too badly when his gesture is ignored.
John knew Sherlock was trying to scandalise him, and he obliged with his eyes going wide, trying to recall exactly when Sherlock had taken them off and what John had said in the heat of the moment when ‘Will’ had walked into his office and suggested they find somewhere more discrete to greet each other.
“This disreputable behaviour whilst wearing the Queen’s uniform is conduct unbecoming at least.”
“Fuck it,” he mutters, noting that his phone is telling him that it’s 11.36 p.m. – close enough.
“Listen…”
"I've heard that height differences can be nullified by being horizontal," John mutters against Sherlock's neck.
"That was beautiful," he tells him honestly, surprised by his reaction. He turns towards the modest, smiling man at his side. "Amazing. Just amazing."
love.
“Your phone is upside down!” he says as loudly as he dares - it’s pretty late and Mrs Hudson’s soothers are
, John thinks because Sherlock is here, under his hands, tired, but upright and alive.
He finally relented, withdrawing his fingers and giving Sherlock a healthy smack, reviewing all the tiny red marks from the nips and pinches he had distracted Sherlock with.
Sherlock tries not to react, he really does, but this is Mycroft and no one knows Sherlock's tells better than him. And he knows he has scored a direct hit, but he doesn't capitalise on that, strangely.
“I can’t forgive her,” he admits and Sherlock is surprised by the vehemence and certainty of John’s voice.
John is struck by how uncertain Sherlock seems, how deferential. This is not something John has ever had cause to think before. A sudden crazy notion flickers across his mind for the second time that day, first on the mistletoe expedition and now here. It seems impossibly unlikely, but if it were anybody else behaving this way, John would fancy his chances  and test the waters, so to speak.
The reaction is instantaneous.
He’s lost count of the number of ‘pleases’ he has asked Sherlock for over the years, some out loud and some only in his mind, but John wants to put his lips to Sherlock’s skin and speak every one of them into his flesh – layer them, overlap them until they cover him completely like bandages.
John is still feeling a little out of focus and he wonders if being naked is the kind of thing they do around each other now. Not that he’s complaining at all; Sherlock is all long limbs and white skin and tight muscle. John wonders if he should look away, but before he can decide, Sherlock is back and urging him out of his sweaty garden clothes and into fresh boxers and a tee-shirt.
With bees.
“I’m sure you have it all in hand. I’m just here to keep our clients in the loop and to smooth any snags we might come across,” John shrugged, sticking to the script he’d been given.
Sherlock takes pity on the man and gets up to boil the kettle again. Maybe with the liberal application of English Breakfast, John will be in a fit state to begin the exploration of their new arrangement sooner. He makes more tea and even recovers the slightly warmed bread that was meant to have been toast and puts it on a clean plate for John, who thanks him distractedly when Sherlock retakes his seat.
Sherlock startles; he stumbles back and into the kitchen, the present intruding on the impossibility before him.
“Oh, thank you, right. I’m John Watson - you probably already know that. Anyway, I wanted to come round and thank you for the jar of honey you left. It was delicious.”
“Oh, yes.”
nothing, she has seen that their relationship will be tested beyond its capacity to recover. There’s darkness ahead, hurt beyond that which they have known – as impossible as that sounds. They have been through so much already, each trying to do the right thing, to put the other first, inadvertently making things worse and worse. But this is the crux, this is when it happens, tonight, tomorrow, the day after, so many threads coming together, becoming fouled, knotted and ugly. Enough to ruin everything. Enough to break an honourable man. Enough to kill a fragile one.
“Are we going home now?” he slurs.
With greedy hands, John left no inch of such pale perfection untouched, stroking and petting and pinching, dipping his fingertips between his cheeks and freezing the second he felt the unmistakable texture of lube.
He’s beginning to feel the unaccustomed distance as he rounds the corner of Giltspur Street and the ugly silhouette of St. Bart’s rears up before him. He can’t help but skid to a halt and stare up at the roof, checking to make sure that there are no dark shapes there before he continues on his way.
The discovery of this drawer of delights changes things dramatically. Not only would it appear that Sherlock does have an interest in pleasuring himself, but he seems rather adventurous if the dildo is any indication. John has seen too many outliers in his career to be able to definitively predict that Sherlock is gay - he's encountered too many men who like to be penetrated who do not identify as homosexual to draw conclusions from a dildo and a bottle of lube.  If John had to choose between straight or gay, he would definitely put his money on Sherlock enjoying the company of men above women, but it would be naive to assume that Sherlock might fall into one of only two categories when he himself doesn't fall firmly into one camp or the other. He suspects that without external childhood influences, a lot more people would enjoy significantly greater flexibility in their sexual tastes and genders of choice. Or perhaps Sherlock only requires his own company and doesn't enjoy sharing such intimacy with others.
He needed this reminder, Sherlock realised, struggling to douse the frustration and stop the tears. He has to keep his emotions in check. This is why silence is his only safety.
What if, instead of living a half-life with Mary, for appearance’s sake, what if he just stayed here?
Sherlock. Suddenly it’s John who believes Christmas must have come in the night – he has that same feeling of warmth and peace and safety along with a happy champagne bubble thrill in his chest. He has no idea what is going to happen – maybe nothing, maybe something wonderful – but at this split second he is happy, perfectly happy in a way he knows he will remember long after the outcome has unfolded.
… John moans. He likes this.
“It could be.”
Sherlock isn't a fool. He’d known that it was what most would term an unhealthy relationship, but for a man who never expected to experience a relationship, unhealthy or otherwise, he had floated with the tidal ebb and spate of John's moods. He’d known that John's issues were deeply ingrained and that his sporadic cooling wasn’t a reflection on anything that Sherlock had done, per se - the problem had been John's and until he had resolved it, there had been little point in Sherlock attempting to find a better and more stable footing for any future they might have had together. Any opinions or discomfort that Sherlock might have felt when John ignored or avoided him had been irrelevant - John had never been abusive to him emotionally, physically or mentally. Sherlock had simply had to endure what he’d already been used to from many of his other social interactions - coolness and distance. For god’s sake, he’d hardly been Mr Personality - he’d been equally capable of long periods of ignoring John or being obnoxious and difficult, so he could hardly have blamed John for the labile nature of their relationship.
At midnight, Sherlock gives up on sleep. The solitude of his room feels now more oppressive than reassuring, and he’s on his feet before he’s even thought through what he’s doing. He makes his way quietly up to the bedroom above his own. John rarely closes either his blinds or the door of his room and Sherlock can make out the shape of him on his side. On silent feet he moves closer to a spot where he can see John’s face. The ambient light from outside washes across the room and outlines John’s jaw and the curve of his brow. Sleep has lifted the worry from him making him look younger. Sherlock wonders if he is overstepping some line of John’s devising by being here. He thinks it likely but cannot persuade himself to go. He sits awkwardly with his back to the wall and matches his breath to John’s.
Sherlock watches John for a few moments, notes the steadiness of his expression, the depth of his resolve and the echo of what must be his therapist's words.
He thinks about getting up, about walking to the other door where the dogs are waiting and the air carries the tang of the sea. He thinks about showing John how he loves him and the place that he has made for him in his life. Their forever. But even as the notion arises, Sherlock decides that there are years and years between now and then, time for them to grow into those people and so many adventures, big and small, to happen on the way. He doesn't want to hurry them towards happily ever after, he wants them to live it instead.
Crispian looks mildly impressed until he responds, "But John tells me that you've fallen in the Thames twice this year already."
What does this mean? Is his mind so thoroughly scrambled that he is mixing up events and people, mistaking this inverted, corrupted mess for the truth? Is he missing some fundamental common denominator in this or is it truly as it seems; an unrelated, unconnected handful of memories, idle thoughts and random deductions that disguise themselves as the present, the product of his failing mind? And if so, what are the scraps of other conversations? Who else could have access to this place?
"You up for that? Do you think your mum can spare us for an hour?" John speaks over the top of Crispian's half -formed protests, his eyes intent on Sherlock missing the disappointment on his cousin's face.
in his head, but they are not kept tethered by a banged-up motor cortex. No, what impedes them is his limbic system, suspended in horror of losing John altogether.
Sherlock breathes through the stab that provokes. As it turns out, his family had enjoyed meeting John too, more than Sherlock might have liked. He hums in a way that John can interpret as he wishes.
Singing under her breath as she checks her Oyster card and snaps her purse shut, Martha closes her front door behind her. She has shopping to do.
“I think we should talk in the morning,” Sherlock offers.
John’s head lifts slowly, eyes reddened and wary. He doesn’t speak but his gaze tracks Sherlock’s movements like a starving man with a spear watching a fish.
“I never said sorry,” he replies quietly, his eyes unfocussed now and trained on the shadows on the wall. “I asked forgiveness and explained and insisted, but I never apologised. I should have.”
It might be his imagination, but he thinks that Sherlock’s hands are slightly unsteady as he hooks the bauble onto an undressed branch. He seems to take a long time to turn around, but when he does, Sherlock's face is set.
“Oh boys, you shouldn’t have!” Mrs Hudson coos, her hands grasped together as she beams at John rearranging Sherlock’s efforts at present placement.
Sherlock is not a naturally violent man. He doesn't have any qualms with the use of physical force, but only when absolutely necessary or when he has been goaded beyond enduring. Crispian is coming dangerously close to the latter discussing him and John like this, with a sickening mix of pity and amusement in his voice.
“Yes?” Sherlock asks, incredulous disbelief making his voice sharp.
Sherlock presses in with two straight away and John has to remind himself not to groan as the cool perfection of Sherlock’s fingers only serve to remind him of his body’s already urgent need to be filled. All too soon he withdraws and leaves him feeling empty and needy, but John has done this enough times to know that he just needs to be patient and…
you big git! And when we’ve had enough of risking our lives in wildly reckless ways here, I will love our life in Sussex. I’ll grow prize-winning courgettes and you’ll… I dunno… catalogue fertilizer composition or something. I’m looking forward to it. Wherever you are is where I want to be. As long as it’s you and me. And the cat.” John raises an eyebrow and gives Sherlock a cheeky wink.
"Then please correct me, doctor,"  Sherlock invites.
“Oh! Oh god…” Sherlock breathes.
A simple word.
“So that’s it, is it?” John calls, suddenly remembering his irritation at this lanky, pompous madman.
And god! The things John wants to do to Sherlock right now. He's so open like this, so far from the untouchable consulting detective.  All his walls are tumbled for John  - and only ever for John - to reach him. Care for him. Love him.
"I'll see you in the morning, love."
He adds the list to a pile of random post that sits on the counter in the kitchen and forgets all about it.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says, clearing his throat quickly. “It’s perfect.”
“Hmmm, new model,” he mutters, sounding grudgingly impressed. He turns to John to show him. “Mrs Hudson’s dusting fixation is in league with the British Government it would seem,” he quips, but his gaze lingers longer on John’s reaction than it should.
“Dull,” he announced, his voice more controlled now. “Although it’s statistically unlikely that anyone in Greater London has missed your informative and frequent announcements on the robustness of your heterosexuality, we can ask my brother to use his considerable resources to check later. Now, in the meantime, if you would be so kind, would you please confirm for me a cause…of…death?”
"Ahhh, coffee is it?" John nudges Molly and she shoves him back harder.
okay. It's not fair to be deducing all this stuff from my possessions, Sherlock. How would you like it if I barged into your room and went through all your stuff?"
"So why did you... marry her?" Sherlock realises that he has stopped and turned to face John who looks back at him with something like guilt heavy on his brow. Sherlock’s voice has given him away, his tone like a beacon to anyone who might have heard him -
“Was that all?” Sherlock eyes the liver slice that appears to be trying to ooze its way out of the dish and make a break for the toast rack. It’s a warm night and frankly the sooner Sherlock can complete this experiment, it and its corresponding aroma can go, and the happier all the residents of 221 Baker Street will be, himself included.
“Was what all? Wha’ was I saying?”
“Is there a point to this or is senility setting in so soon?”
Mrs Hudson is an inevitability, living as she does right beneath their… his flat, but her presence seems suddenly relentless. Sherlock doesn’t even bother to try to follow her inane jabberings, but eventually she makes a point of sitting down in John’s chair, waiting for his eyes to register her presence instead of checking the latest from a pile of reports delivered earlier by one of Lestrade’s lackeys.
"I'm not trying to excuse my behaviour, but I think you probably already knew that my upbringing was challenging,” John murmurs, bringing Sherlock back from his unquiet thoughts.
He quickly snatches back the phone when John finally dries up.
for him.
“Raining out?” he asked.
“Um, I don’t speak French and don’t you think you should perhaps…”
There were small, yappy dogs on ridiculously long leads, cyclists popping on and off the pavement to avoid traffic signals and parents with strollers filled with chubby, sticky infants; so many obstacles that could conceivably send him sprawling. It was positively dangerous to continue his break-neck speed
Sherlock’s gaze warmed even further as John rolled his eyes and huffed his confession.
“Should we light the fire?” John asks eventually in one of the gaps in Sherlock’s soliloquy.
That’s not what people are supposed to say, even if it’s true. John licks his lips - a habit of his when he’s at a bit of a loss and that he can’t seem to shake.
"A bit."
"I'll come and check on you in half an hour or so," John assures the apparently pained man.
“Well, it proved more distracting than I anticipated. And you did say
“Sher-lock? Can you hear me?”
“Well, it came with a note and the Manoir’s label on it.”
twinkle in his eye, and John felt a thrill of horrified anticipation.
John doesn’t want to let nerves or worries intrude here. The hardest part is done and the best is yet to come, he hopes, but it isn’t until he hears a quick run of plucked, then bowed notes that he releases the rock of tension in his neck and shoulders.
"No, he's one of the foremost oboists in the world at the moment."
“Fucking thing!” John snarled earning him a slurred ‘Shh!’ from Sherlock.
“The staring might be unconscious, but my desire is neither latent nor very well supressed,” John admits.
The crack, when it comes, is directly overhead. It produces almost instantaneous, violet-white lightning and the noise is deafening. John flinches and tries to do his breathing exercises. There’s another resounding strike nearby, so loud it makes his jaws ache and his heart seize. The lights dim, then rise, flicker and die. The darkness seems absolute, punctuated by blinding flashes that seem to come from everywhere at once.
John’s legs have turned to some combination of lead and jelly – they don’t want to bear his weight or, indeed, move.  Logically, he knows that this is because of the temperature and the run and the shock and the panic attack and anyone would be affected, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t want to walk back into his own front door under his own steam.
“Sherlock, seriously? I’m too hungover to discuss this now.”
For the rest of the day a sense of discomfort lingers in the flat. John does his best to inject some conversation into proceedings but his efforts trail off into quiet repeatedly. Sherlock naps on the sofa and eats his soup when John brings it to him at suppertime but pointedly avoids the sliced apples and the ill-advised cheese sandwich delivered to him at lunch time.
The change of angle was a trial of stamina for them both as he complied. Sherlock huffed and writhed, and John gritted his teeth and hissed. He’d been hard for so long now, he wanted nothing more than to pound Sherlock’s glorious arse and flood him, but Sherlock was hard again too now and John would have to be sure to hit exactly the right spot to bring them off together.
John Watson is too old for Valentines - he's a grown man, for goodness sake -  a doctor, and a war veteran. The bathroom scales tell him he should not have chocolates, he has no need for overpriced roses and he's never, ever seen a heart-laden greetings card that hasn't made him feel either faintly nauseous or horribly patronised. Valentine's Day is for kids, for those married to their childhood sweethearts and those with a hopelessly romanticised view of loving relationships, and he reminds himself of these points as he shaves in the bathroom mirror on the morning of the fourteenth of February.
He decides to tidy up a bit and put a load or two of washing on. He changes the sheets for Sherlock's favourites, cleans the bathroom and even uncovers a tablecloth from the airing cupboard to cover the chemical stains that he can't get off the kitchen table. And if he also finds (after twenty minutes of dedicated searching) a candle and a candlestick, well, that will make Sherlock's return supper even more special.
"That is my contention. That has not been the case in my experience, which has led me to the conclusion that sex is a waste of time and energy and that I should only engage in partnered coitus when my own ability to satisfy my drives has not proved efficient. I believe I may have been hasty in that assumption."
Their car arrives outside Baker Street about half an hour later and Sherlock emerges from his bedroom looking like he has spent all morning getting ready, from his perfect curls to his polished shoes via his matched luggage. They climb in and settle back for the journey to Gloucestershire and John wonders when private cars and discreet, suited drivers became as normal as mental flatmates.
“Oh, it’s very unlikely,” Mycroft says with unconvincing carelessness. “Similar in style though. Possibly the work of an apprentice of the man himself. Of course, this one too has a less than impeccable history. It was allegedly made for a court composer from a minor Bavarian princedom. It disappeared in the mid 19
“Perspective. Living with you for three days was enough to find out that the sociopath thing was a load of crap and that the Sherlock Holmes persona was just a front for everything else you are; funny, generous, gentle, reflective…”
"Those things are private," he explains in a very, very quiet voice that Sherlock ought to recognise as dangerous by now, but seems to ignore every time.
A quick glance over his shoulder shows that their footprints are filling with snow again within a few seconds of them passing and they walk through the gateway to the house only a minute later stopping to turn under the wooden porch that covers the front door, and look out at the gathering snow. The porch is only as wide as the front door, so they are stood quite closely together, keeping out of the falling snow. The porch light has not been left on for some reason and the only illumination is coming from the windows where lights have been left on to welcome them home, and Sherlock's candle which had survived its brush with extinguishment.
Hearing it all the way through for the first time, John wonders at how long he has been working on it, wonders if it kept Sherlock company in the years they were apart, before he had his violin to even hear it out loud.
Either way, it’s something good.
Sherlock has the humility to shrug. His face softens. "It clearly meant a lot to you that you have been hanging on to it for so long. What was her name?"
John derailed the latest complaint with the expedient use of a tug on Sherlock’s hip and a lazy thrust upward that pushed the first inch or two of his cock into him.
“It’s not that simple,” John says with a quick sniff, drains his cup and stares into its emptiness.
The garden is beginning to show the first inkling of life and John has noticed birds and insects beginning to stir as the light lingers longer in the evenings. The beds seem to have a new crop of weeds to gift him with and the hedges around the property have a mist of fresh colour as buds begin to swell and burst. Each day it is stronger and greener.
“Do what?”
, but so is whatever is happening outside the confines of this non-existent place.
"Ah, what a shame," Mycroft says with no glimmer of sympathy or honesty. "Mummy was hoping he would be able to join us for carolling tonight."
John and Steve both turned to look at Will, who seemed to be getting more wide-eyed by the moment. He nodded, a jerky movement that conveyed his unwillingness and his agitation.
Finding it increasingly difficult to contain his low mood, Sherlock comforts himself by standing too close to John when he knocks on Mrs Hudson’s door that evening, berating himself for his weakness even as he relishes the brush of John’s shoulder against his own. The last four months have been a similar sweet torment, having John back at 221B, sharing space again without the complication of the wife to be placated or considered.
John cleared his throat and sat down in his chair, facing Sherlock. “I don’t mind. Are you warming up a bit now?”
He saws off a slice of bread and stuffs it into the toaster, fighting with the mechanism which doesn’t respond well to harsh treatment.
Do you think you can make it there?" John asks solicitously.
John’s breath hitches and his chin lifts to look at Sherlock. Relief and confusion and concern play across his face but they resolve into regret within a few seconds. He takes a breath to reply, but Sherlock gives him a tiny shake and tries one more time.
Sherlock’s gaze is penetrating. It cuts through the carefully constructed veneer of truths that John wears these days. His eyes narrow, his head tips and John feels a cool tendril of panic twine through his guts and reach for his heart.
John feels his heart shatter.
Sherlock raised a sardonic eyebrow. “They’re on your desk. We
"Who taught Mummy to text?" Sherlock hisses, his eyes turning inevitably to Crispian.
Passing the British Museum, he cuts across one of the tiny square parks that London seems to have an abundance of, past the Law School and skirts the edge of Smithfield Market. Away from the A40 there is next to no traffic and the world narrows down to the beat of his boots bringing him closer to where he needs to be, the reach of the next streetlight and his litany of prayers for the safety of his friend.
John sighs, quietly and irritatingly disappointed in himself, and also slightly concerned that Sherlock’s behaviour will deteriorate  further when he lets him get away with this one as well.
He loves to watch Sherlock play, and back at home he does so as often as he can without it becoming creepy, so to have the opportunity to sit and openly admire (adore) him was an unexpected treat. It's not creepy if everyone is watching, right? So John made the most of it - watched the way Sherlock swayed and moved with the melody, watched his eyelashes flutter when he played his highest notes and the way his long fingers were so precise and graceful when he was lost to the dynamic of harmonising with his brother's playing. John swears he hardly breathed through the whole thing (which would also explain why he felt a little lightheaded at the end.)
“Right, well, thank you for being so understanding about this, Sherlock. And I assure you that I don’t expect anything to change between us…”
"Your first and last time with your fiancé," Sherlock agrees and the world does that strange thing it sometimes does when he and Sherlock are together - time slows and grins fade, their eyes remain locked as everything else slips away for a few minutes or even hours. John believes he sees the most real incarnation of his acerbic, flawed genius at times like this. His face smooths, his eyes soften and something like gratitude and wonder settle on his expressive face. John can only imagine that his own face looks exactly the same because in moments like this he is as close to Sherlock as he can be. They have always had a good connection, conveying whole conversations with a single look and for men who find it as difficult to express themselves as they do, especially in the early days, this silent accord used to reassure John that he wasn't just an annoying follower or a mirror held up for Sherlock to reflect his brilliance in - there is give and take in these communications, questions and answers, declarations and acceptance and parity. It's an uncanny feeling but it is the most natural thing in the world to them now.
“I ought to have you up on charges, you know,” John said, low and quiet.
John hasn't spoken since the whiskey remark. Sherlock glances surreptitiously at John's wrist and sees that forty five minutes has passed. He's been in his mind palace reviewing all the pertinent possibilities, variables and opportunities available to him when they reach the cottage, listing them by duration, proximity and how much they might appeal to a man like John Watson. His guest. His plus one. His flatmate and friend. And, if he has any say in the matter, by the time they leave on Boxing Day, his partner.
Today has been a bad day. That’s not a justification but it is a reason – one of them – as to why he’s being treated to a show now. After all the times this could have happened. After all the times it didn’t. Sherlock has every right to taunt him with this, to accuse him, to confront him. And John could turn, walk away and shut the door behind him – he’s a past master at that. But he doesn’t. Not this time.
"Do you mind if I take a look?"
“Sometimes it takes them a day or so to get the supply back. I’ve brought some candles, we can light some in a minute. It’s just a storm. It’s been brewing all afternoon. The bees have been pouring back to the hive for the last few hours to avoid it. They seem to know when it’s coming. I have several theories about that - remind me to tell you about them sometime.”
In the glow of the windows, John looks especially fetching. He has a knitted hat and scarf that Sherlock recognises as being in his school house colours from decades ago - he had no idea that his mother had kept such a thing. The red and gold suit him and Sherlock watches John's breaths cloud into the air as he speaks to Father. He catches Sherlock's eye and quirks him a quick, slightly self-conscious grin. He seems relaxed and anyone who didn’t know him (and  some who did) would be convinced that he was a mild, conventional man, a doctor, a conscientious caring soul - and he is all those things. But he is also a marksman, a man with a strong sense of right and wrong and an authoritative voice when needed,  a man who doesn’t shirk responsibility and a man with an adventurous streak that needs exercising  frequently. There’s a sharp edge to his smile, if you look closely, and when his smile turns soft, that edge jumps to his eyes and makes them glint with a barely suppressed spark of recklessness.
“Oh, these old things?” Sherlock asked, running a pale hand up the length of his thigh.
,  John speaks. "Sherlock, I..." and just as Sherlock's stomach swoops, preparing for the worst, John Watson - his guest, his plus one, his flatmate and friend, blows out the candle and stretches up to put a hand on Sherlock's neck and pull him down for a kiss.
A visit from the wrong Holmes.
It takes them ten minutes just to get Crispian upstairs and the man is very clearly in distress although John can’t immediately identify the exact source of the problem in the movements he is able to make.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock agreed, slowly insinuating his thigh into the non-existent space between John’s legs and making himself comfortable. “You do have some redeeming qualities though, if only we could dispense with your distressing need for boring clothing.”
Sherlock looks on in stunned silence. Pain blooms in the frown on his face and the haunted look in his eyes. He appears to struggle for a few moments.
But if more were on offer then he’d be lying if he said he wouldn’t snatch it with both hands. He’s found himself doubting that Sherlock is even capable of love like that. He knows how important he is to Sherlock, he understands the unique place he occupies, but Sherlock isn’t like anyone else John’s ever met. That’s one of the reasons John loves him in the first place. But relationships? Romantic love? Sex? These are all things that John has seen no evidence of, and in fact has seen far more evidence to prove their absence from Sherlock’s priorities. Not many who spend time with the man can avoid his views on sentiment – even the way he says it drips with contempt.
“It’s still early. Do you mind if we doze for a bit?”
John runs his hands over Crispian's spine, then out across his lower ribs. He can't feel the spasm in the muscles of his lumbar region but he can feel the strain where Crispian is holding as still as he can to avoid incurring more pain.
And some of that must show because Sherlock lifts a hesitant hand and touches cautious fingers to his cheek and jaw and throat, then curl around his neck and bring his head down where he can pull his mouth in close enough to kiss. Not immediately though. He leaves a hair’s breadth between them, his eyes wide open, watching to see what John will do, waiting for a sign that this is what he wants.
“You could be good for him. He spends too much time alone up there.”
And John can't. Sherlock sits, all unassuming and strangely eager, and John cannot think of a single thing to ask that won't feed into his own yearning. It feels all wrong; voyeuristic and self-serving. Sherlock deserves better than to have John pawing through his sexual history. If he'd wanted to discuss his likes and dislikes he would have...
“And our pleasure,” John adds quickly. “No more than you deserve!” He sends him a long-suffering but fond glare that he breaks off quickly when Sherlock meets his gaze with a roll of his eyes and a small smile.
"Ah, well I'm...I’m glad you are finding it beneficial. After Ella, I thought you had more or less lost faith in the profession." Sherlock acknowledges, pushing away the rush of relief.
"What would you call it then, hmm? Rudeness? Lack of boundaries? Invasion of privacy? Theft?" John snarls as he makes a grab for the half-recognised t-shirt he's just noticed tucked between Sherlock's hands and chest.
, ... Oh, Sherlock."
John could not be more wrong. His logic is flawed. He hasn’t got all the data he needs. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Sherlock may not have declared his affection to John but even Mycroft had recognised his deep connection to the doctor, dispensing thinly veiled warnings of the dangers of attachment on repeated occasions. Sherlock may not have stated his devotion or attraction but it had been implied in dozens of ways every day if John had only known where to look and if Sherlock had stopped to notice.
“That’s what I said,” John agrees, not wishing to provoke another fraternal argument but not denying that it is distracting Sherlock from his own less than convincing performance.
"Birthday. Eightieth."
Pretending that he wouldn’t rather that time just stop and allow him to be with his best friend.
“…just so.”
His mug now empty, John turns back to the house, content with this morning’s discoveries such as they are. There’s only so much grey and brown a man can take under an uncompromising gunmetal sky.
“It took me a while to admit it to myself and I don’t know if I’d ever have admitted it to you had you stayed. But it wasn’t until you were gone that I understood how deeply it had run, and it wasn’t until you came back that I knew it was forever.”
"Lick your palm - get it good and wet. Good. Now wrap it around the top... further up, so just the crown... yeah," John breathes. "Just like that."
“Right, well, that’s…” Again John trails off - clearly his levels of inebriation last night have caused some significant damage to his mental faculties this morning and Sherlock can only hope that his recovery is as swift as it is complete. He wants to get to the most interesting aspects of this new arrangement as soon as possible and John’s current dullness at the moment could scupper his plans for experimentation today.
He barely had time to take in the leather upholstery or the tasteful décor before Sherlock had slammed the door behind them and was on him, crowding him, stalking him further into the vehicle.
Unfortunately, even this safest of places has been infiltrated.
It was silent in the taxi on the way home – John in a fit of self-loathing and Sherlock… well, who knew? He took himself off immediately to his own room, and despite loitering through the evening and long into the night in hopes of catching his friend, he gave John no opportunity to make things right between them. Feeling sick and pathetic, John took himself off to bed where he laid awake for another hour or more, wondering how to...
“No, not that,” he says immediately and Sherlock cannot help the swell of hope that rises up in his chest as John finally looks him in the eye, his gaze direct and unwavering. And Sherlock should be
Laughing, John brushed that off. “Is he? It’s kind of hard to see around his massive ego… sorry, I meant genius!”
"I'm not sure this is such a good idea," John begins.
Sherlock’s lips quirk the tiniest bit. Not Chopin, but Sherlock knows John already knew that. It’s an old joke.
of what lies behind it becomes stronger with every step until it is a shrieking, dragging dissonance along his every nerve and a suffocating lack of breath.
Nodding, Sherlock bites his lower lip. He sucks in a sharp breath to speak, but seems to change his mind.
John looks across to Sherlock who is scowling as if Crispian's injury is a personal affront.
His offer of tea accepted, John makes two cups, depositing one beside his uninvited guest and taking his own to his chair. He sips and licks his lips, settling his dressing gown more closely around him. He wants to wait the pompous idiot out, but John knows his own limits for games such as these. “What can I help you with?” he settles on.
Remembering he has a mobile phone, he pulls it out of his pocket, checking it for new messages and dialling Mycroft’s number as his dripping boots squeak their way down deserted hallways. Of course, there’s no answer so John leaves a terse message, hanging up as he rounds a corner and sees a nurses’ station, a beacon of subdued light and quiet conversation.
