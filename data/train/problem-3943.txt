The look that crosses Dean's face is the epitome of cockiness. "Wow. That didn't take much. Just had to get you thinking you have the upper hand."
Dean moved him to the side and opened the passenger side door. "In the car. Now."
"Oh, Cas," Dean moaned as he buried his fingers in Castiel's hair and trailed his other hand down his back, fingernails scraping along his shoulder blades. "More... please."
The vampire’s movements are speeding up incrementally, but when Castiel clenches around Benny’s dick, he shudders and momentarily stills.
He handed the stall owner a handful of the tickets Dean had given him, and picked up the gun that he would shoot the painted ducks with. Even though Castiel had never shot a gun before - real or otherwise - he was certain he would hit enough ducks to win the panda.
Dean gasped out, "I knew you were a toppy bastard the moment I met you in that barn." His breathing shuddered, and Castiel felt the car accelerate as Dean pressed his foot down on the gas pedal. "Jesus, Cas…"
One of them steps forward slightly and tilts his head, staring at Cas as if he’s trying to work out who… or what he is.
Something crosses Benny's features fleetingly, gone before Castiel can figure it out, and Benny looks him in the eyes with longing. "I'm gonna take you apart. Make you scream my name." He leans in and softly adds, "Gonna make you remember me, Cas."
Castiel doesn’t know what his thoughts about the vampire mean, but he knows he would like to hold onto him this time.
There's a goddamn rift opening at the other end of the hall. On the other side, Dean can't see anything but a mirror of the hall they're currently standing in. And it's weird – they've never been able to see through a rift before.
"I beg your pardon!" Balthazar interrupts in mock-offense.
"I've got you, sunshine. We can do this."
Castiel can feel Benny's chest rumble with the growl his gesture elicits. "You gonna let me fuck this tight hole, angel? Somehow I don't think Dean's been tappin' it," he adds with a devilish smirk.
Benny purrs against him, then starts licking at him in earnest. It's such an intimate feeling, like the vampire is kissing him there the same way he did Castiel's mouth. His tongue probes at Castiel's hole, and he moans, loving the way Benny is filling him.
Not knowing what to expect, he was nervous when Dean pulled away. But the hunter just looked at him with a perplexed look that morphed into that look when Dean saw pie, or a double bacon cheeseburger; and then there was a hand at the base of his skull, fingers tangling in his hair, and those lips Castiel had been dreaming of for so long descended on his in a kiss that was gentle but demanding.
. The dream is coming more frequently, and every time, it was like someone clawing into his heart.
And Dean did. Castiel watched as his lover fell apart under their combined ministrations, his irises darkening to a vivid forest green. The noises he was making cut off as his body shook one final time; then Dean pulled Castiel down on top of him and hugged him tightly, laughing softly. "You blew the windows out of my car. Better fix that so we can get home for round two."
“Why? Because the Men of Letters is an honorable organization?” Inias asks, entirely reasonably.
"There's only one bed," Dean said, stating the obvious. "Sonuvabitch, I'm gonna kill them."
Balthazar slaps his hand back on his chest. "Are you always so reckless in your universe? You can't just charge in and kill them. We need to know why demons are guarding an angel artefact."
Dean decides to throw him a bone, though.
The way Benny's looking at him… so much hunger. And when the vampire nuzzles even further between his legs, Castiel can't help the whimper that escapes. He feels Benny's fangs scrape against the thin flesh at the vee where his hip and leg join, and has to sink his own teeth into his lip to keep from screaming.
Castiel came back down as Dean spilled inside him, teeth sunk into his shoulder. He fell to the mattress, avoiding the pool of his ejaculate and said, "That was a dirty trick. You know I can't resist when you call me 'love'."
“Fuck, angel. Do that again.”
The look Dean gives him is… haunted? There's definitely something there, and it reminds him that maybe this isn't the right place to be discussing this. Michael alone must be difficult for him to hear about.
He needs to get in touch with them…
He let out a particularly loud cry as Dean slammed into his prostate, then leaned over him and bit his earlobe. "It's just a stuffed lion, babe. He can't actually see us."
He couldn’t even look at Dean; he just wanted to run away and hide his embarrassment.
You think you can do that?"
Charlie belts out, "No way! There's no fucking way you got demons in here. We warded for everything after we got Ketch to spill."
“I’m sorry.” Castiel isn’t really sure why he’s apologizing, but it feels appropriate. “I wonder if Sam is even here. Something feels wrong.”
“I also have groceries. In my trunk. I didn’t have time to unload my car before… before you arrived. Maybe you would help me with them once you’ve finished here?”
How is it possible that this just got hotter? Benny's skills in lovemaking are eye opening, and Castiel wants to experience all of them. "Open me up. Prepare me for your cock… please."
Castiel is confused. He senses nothing of the sort. "Are you certain? I only see the guards at the tomb's entrance."
"You're still so naive, Lucifer. It's truly a shame." Michael reaches out like he's going to try to touch his brother, and the flames leap toward him. "We could have ruled the world together."
As he glanced at Dean, he noticed a look of lust on his face. "Holy shit, that was hot. Get in the car and let's get to the bunker."
Castiel raised his eyebrow again, which earned him a sharp intake of breath from Dean. “I think you should put your seatbelt on and drive to the bunker right now,” he said, as he slid his hand over the seat and lightly brushed his fingertip along the side of Dean’s thigh.
Cas doesn't answer; he just speeds up his strokes while pulling Dean in for a filthy kiss.
“You are very fond of pleasuring yourself,” Castiel stated, never once pausing in his ministrations. “My father said he had never seen so much porn.” He ran his thumb over the head, and Dean gripped the seat so tightly his knuckles turned white.
“You’re angels,” he directs toward the men…
"I think we have to try. I don't know what's going on here with Sam, but if Lucifer's really wearing him to prom, then yeah. We've got to try."
Dean looks down at the toes of his boots. He's pretty sure he's the reason Sam said yes. Somehow.
Castiel is incredibly grateful to Benny in this moment, especially as he has to be hurting more than anyone else here. It’s evident that he and this world’s Dean meant a great deal to each other, and Castiel wishes more than ever that he could give comfort to his friend… his would-be-friend. He gives a small smile, and bows his head.
Heading to the kitchen, he's really hoping to find his friend. Needs the familiarity and comfort of someone who knows what he lost.
“We’re hoping to summon Michael
Dean moves to stand next to Sam's nightstand and picks up a picture frame that was laying face down. He peruses it, and his face transitions from slight confusion to something between sadness and resolve.
It seemed that although he had come here for some peace and quiet, he was going to have to suffer Dr. Sexy for at least one evening. “Fine. I agree to watch Dr. Sexy and Dr. Delicious with you.”
Castiel smiled and pulled as much of Dean around him as he could. As much as he loved the stuffed gifts Dean brought him, "just because", the hunter would always be his favorite teddy bear.
Cas looks a little sheepish at not realizing what was expected of him, and Dean tacks on, “I'm guessing by your lack of reaction, you don’t have a version of Cas in this world?”
Dean choked out, "If it hasn't happened by now, I think we're-" He paused as Castiel neared the head of his penis.
"I'm not buying it, dude," Dean huffed out, obviously upset. "The moment I started talking about Dr. Sexy, you got squirrely. And the implication I'm attracted to the guy made you run from the room. Just say if you aren't cool with it, man. Because I'm not going to stay here with some prejudiced-"
As he finished cooking the chicken and vegetables, adding some soy sauce for taste, Dean prepared the noodles. They worked side by side in a comfortable silence, and Castiel noticed that although Dean had been the one to complain about personal space earlier, it was he who seemed to be more prone to bumping into Castiel.
The attendant passed over the tiger without any argument, and Castiel watched as Dean lugged it over to the child he'd been looking at earlier. He knelt down in front of the boy, taking great care to keep the stuffed animal off the trash-strewn ground. "Hey, buddy. That nice man said my friend and I did such an awesome job that he wanted to give me an extra reward. But I can't really fit this guy and the panda in my car. I noticed you have a tiger on your shirt, though, and thought maybe you might like it?"
The tension leaves Dean's body, and Benny's not quite sure what triggers the change, but all of a sudden, Dean's freakishly calm in his arms.
Benny lightly kisses Dean's pouty mouth and whispers, "You're missin' the show, princess."
And who knows what else will strike us? We hope to see some (all???) of you in the comments section of whatever we put out next. 💜
The other man gave him a confused look before asking, "Did I say something wrong? Or is it the Dr. Sexy thing? Because if you were lying earlier and the idea of two dudes being together really does bother you, then this isn't going to work."
Castiel lifted one of his hands to Dean’s chest, where he caressed the skin tenderly for a moment before turning his attention to Dean’s nipple. He began rubbing his thumb over it, making him squirm underneath him. "You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen, Dean Winchester. Come for me,” he purred.
“We should look for Sam and Jack. Dean wanted us to save someone… it must be them.” Cas states dryly.
Castiel looks again, and yes… he can see the black eyes now. There must be something different about them in this world. He withdraws his angel blade and prepares to strike.
We started the fic with thanks to the people who helped us, but now we want to thank you… our readers.
He hadn’t been able to save this world’s Dean, and he couldn’t bear the thought that Benny might meet the same fate. The relief he’d felt when Benny had opened his eyes had been palpable, and he’d been happy to just sit holding Dean and Benny until they were eventually interrupted by Lucifer.
He's thoughtfully pacing the stacks when Dean and Cas come in. They both look ragged, and the coffee's a great ruse. If he didn’t know any better, he'd think they hadn't had a good night's rest. Though the angel doesn't need it.
“Twenty,” the man answered, with a too smug smile on his face.
Dean surged up and growled in his ear, "Then you're going to love this." Castiel felt his hunter's hand loosen just enough to brush his own erection against the flesh he was already holding. He encircled both as much as he could in his fist, then slowly resumed stroking.
"Shit." He can't say the sight of himself dying is anything other than unnerving as hell, and from Cas's reaction, the angel is just as messed up about it. "What do we do? He was obviously fighting someone, but I don't see anyone around."
Castiel hesitated outside for a moment, wondering what he should do. He could go back home again, but it was at least a two and a half hour drive, and he didn’t have the energy. Maybe he would head back home tomorrow…
Dean leaned his forehead against Castiel's and whispered, "Sounds like good advice. What do you say we head home, sunshine?"
Slipping his hand between their bodies, he takes hold of Benny’s impressively sized cock, and gives it a stroke. It feels wonderful in his hand, and he wonders what it might feel like if it was inside him… if Benny fucks him the way he fucked Dean. He hasn’t really thought about doing it that way before, but now… now he can’t get it out of his mind.
"You alright, Cas?" He knows he isn’t. Knows neither of them are. But he can't just ignore it.
He looked extremely confused, then Castiel watched in amazement as his head tilted back in uninhibited laughter. Dean's palm smacked the butcher block top of the island, as tears streamed down his face.
A look of shock passes across the angel’s face, and he scrubs his hand over it in obvious nervousness. “Sam… he, he’s gone. He let Lucifer in, and left the bunker.”
Benny runs his hands up the back of Castiel's thighs and hooks his legs over his shoulders. The motion causes him to brush just right against his prostate, and Castiel whines.
Dean sees him whisper something oh-so softly in their angel's ear, and he's pretty sure it's a reciprocation, but the moment is just for them, and he's so okay with that.
The song Benny sings is One, by Metallica.
And Dean can't deny him that. He steps forward to grasp his shoulder but stops, hand in mid-air. He gulps and points to the hall instead. "This way."
Castiel loves the way they’re moving together as they ride out their orgasms, gradually slowing down until they’re spent. He feels like he’s covered in sweat and come, and it’s gross, and glorious, and he’s in a happy daze.
He moves back to Benny with intent in every line of his body. "We need to go get this under wraps."
"Well, that doesn't really narrow it down much," Dean replies, full of sarcasm. "Chuck was bored as shit. He created a freakin' squirrel world, for cryin' out loud. What if this one–"
Did people enjoy this experience, and if so, why? It was all very puzzling to Castiel.
That was the first time anyone had ever told Castiel this, and he blushed furiously before replying in a voice that sounded much deeper than usual. “It has some excellent inspiration.” He didn’t know if that made any sense, but his brain wasn’t getting much blood flow at that moment.
“Not hiding… waiting for my opportunity.” Lucifer moves closer to his brother, unruffled by Michael’s taunt. “Your hatred has made you blind, and I feel sorry for you.”
Castiel considered for a moment before replying. “I wanted the bear very much, but if I had to choose between you and Inias…” he could hear the way his voice turned into a growl as he leaned forward and whispered into Dean’s ear, “I wouldn’t hesitate to leave him by the side of the road.”
Of course it isn’t possible to suffocate a vampire, but it lightens the mood and stops Dean from worrying too much about what might have happened if Cas hadn’t turned up in time.
Voices of the rest of the people surrounding the pyre join in, singing solemnly, and with feeling.
"We are aware that Dean Winchester is dead. He's currently running a gourmet burger shack in his Heaven and makes the most wonderful pies. But Michael's part in that isn't something we were aware of." Inias's brow furrows in contemplation. "Where is Sam?"
“But… that isn’t very fair,” Castiel replied, feeling belligerent. “How am I supposed to win the panda if it’s rigged?” He shot a scowl at the stall owner for good measure.
“I agree. And no more losing people.” Castiel pulls back from Dean, and gives him a hopeful smile. “It sounds like the funeral is over. Would you like to go back to the bunker?”
“Right, you beautiful people,” he starts, “we now know what we need to trap Michael, and how to kill him. We already have holy oil… that’s the easy part. But we also need one of Michael’s feathers. There are only two on earth; one in Norway, which would be very tricky because of the war, and one just outside Jerusalem.”
The stranger scoffed at him and climbed the steps to the porch. "Yeah, no. I rented this place out from my Uncle Bobby's friend a couple months ago. Definitely you in the wrong place."
They fell asleep like that, and it was a great couple hours, but now Benny's enjoying a re-energized Cas, who's rocking his hips and riding his dick like it's his saving grace.
Benny shoves his middle finger inside Dean and strokes along silky walls until he feels that swollen gland and applies a little pressure.
Dean nods, and Castiel can tell he's having trouble meeting the vampire's eyes.
bedroom.
He stepped closer, pressing Castiel back into the counter, leaving just a breath of space between them.
Inias nods, confusion coloring his features. "You're mistaken. Lucifer is the Morningstar. He's the Light Bringer. Michael…" He pauses and looks at Castiel with open hostility. "How exactly is it that an angel, unknown to our realm, came to be in the midst of this?"
He’s almost at the kitchen now, and his mouth is dry as he swallows.
"Our father doesn't care. About any of us. If he did, do you think it would have come to this, brother?"
The boy accepted the tiger and grinned up at his mother, who was thanking Dean and gazing at him with a look of admiration. It was not at all unusual for women and men to stare at the hunter in such a fashion.
Blunt… that’s what Dean would call it, but then again, Castiel wasn’t exactly expecting a tearful reunion.
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, and Castiel is immensely grateful for the flames that are stopping the hunter from jumping into the fight.
“I can assure you that I have no intention of disturbing your peace and quiet, and I’m not interested in your ‘personal space'.” Castiel was lying through his teeth, because he was extremely interested in the other man’s personal space, but this was very much not the time to be thinking of that. “I just want to sit and read quietly, and have a few days to myself. That’s all I ask for.”
Dean feels a moment of shame. He knows he has friends to support him. But a lifetime of bad habits is hard to break. He gives Cas a little nod of gratitude and looks at… "What's your name? Looks like we're gonna be here a while, so might as well get the introductions done."
Bobby grunts in response. "Yeah, I hear him. I got ears, don't I?" He shakes his head and looks at Benny. "I hope this doesn't take too long. If I gotta spend much time with this jackass-" he points a thumb over his shoulder at Rufus- "I'm liable to leave his bones there as a substitute."
He's delivering the double tap and getting ready to head toward the kitchen when he encounters Jo.
"I hope you eat meat, man, because I can only deal with one salad freak in my life, 'k?"
Dean moved back to the kitchen and reached into the fridge to pull out a beer. "You want one?"
“That’s a relief,” he chuckled. “I wouldn’t want her to hold it against me.” He pulled his clothes back on as Dean did the same, issuing an apology to Inias as he retrieved the items, before climbing out of the car and placing his hand on the hood. The splintered glass reformed, and in a matter of seconds all of the windows were whole again.
“I believe you are up to fifteen now,” Castiel said, noting how triumphant he sounded. That would teach the owner - who was looking none too pleased now - to take people’s money for a game most people couldn’t win.
Fingers circle Castiel's other nipple and then pinch at it with increasing pressure, until Castiel whimpers under his ministrations.
Rufus responds with his patented snark. "Just turn the other cheek, Bobby!" Then he lops the head off of the demon he's currently fighting and backs up so he and Bobby can cover the space.
It’s a strange thought, but it occurs to Castiel that of all the alternative worlds they’ve encountered, this is the first time they’ve met either of the Winchesters. But it’s sobering to think that Dean was dying when they stepped through, and Sam is under the influence of a demon. Something is very different about their lives here, but he can’t put his finger on what that might be.
“You do? What is it?” Castiel has watched some of Dean’s extensive collection of porn in the past, but he really has no idea what’s on Benny’s mind.
Dean gave Castiel a quick salute, before turning the key in the ignition and setting off for home. Castiel felt a warmth spread through him, at the thought of the bunker being home… and all of the activities Dean and he might indulge in, now that the nature of their relationship had changed.
Stunned at the sheer hedonism of what they’re doing, and the way Benny is breaking him into tiny pieces, he finds himself unable to form words; all he can do is stare up at the vampire with a pleading expression. It seems Benny takes pity on him because – finally – he pulls his fingers out of Castiel’s ass and painstakingly slowly replaces them with his cock.
It makes Benny growl, and he thrusts in hard again. "Look so good together. Really wanna watch you two take each other apart sometime. But for now…" The vampire reaches between Castiel's legs and traces along where his dick is plunging into Castiel's hole, then trails those fingers up until he finds a spot that makes Castiel jerk.
Castiel stares at him. "What's the point? It will just taste like molecules. We have more important matters to discuss, Balthazar."
Quietly, and with great reverence, they lay Dean’s body on the ground, then they begin collecting firewood for the pyre. As they work, more people appear; other residents of the bunker, some familiar, some not.
"Such an impatient angel." Benny chuckles as he pulls away slightly, before plunging in again.
Castiel realised that by saying this he was acknowledging to himself that he wouldn’t be going home tomorrow, but it would be okay, wouldn’t it? He and Dean might be different, but they could be civilised.
“Thank you. I look forward to it.”
Cas looks startled, like a rabbit caught in the headlights, and Benny can understand why. They don’t know he heard what he did, and Cas is hardly likely to fess up; especially not now that he’s apologized to Dean for what was said while they were having sex. “Dean, he has these nightmares,” Cas says eventually, his gaze not quite meeting Benny’s. “They’re very distressing for him… for us.”
"Guessing this Sam and Dean weren't on the best of terms." He turns the picture around so Castiel can see it. The brothers are standing side by side, arms slung around each other's shoulders, but the glass is fractured, and there is a gash torn through Dean's face.
It hurts Castiel to see the look of suspicion still on Inias's face, but his next words are slightly less hostile. "If you didn't see who was wielding the spear before it was thrown, but you," he turns to Balthazar, "have confirmed Michael's presence, did it occur to none of you to wonder whose vessel he was using?"
Dean gets up and walks out of the room, and Cas visibly shrinks in on himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're happy to disappoint you," Lucifer says, stepping through the door behind them.
The look on Dean's face was sheer sin. "Like that, angel?"
"Honestly, we don't know if
After waiting a few seconds in silence, he reaches his hand to the knob and looks to Dean for guidance on whether he should open the door or not.
Gently, he begins, "Cas, I think Balthazar's right. He's gonna need someone who's familiar with the blades. And with his affinity for… unscrupulous business practices–"
Benny thinks, looking at the both of them,
Balthazar starts to reply, but Benny just holds up a hand, halting whatever the angel's preparing to say. He instead faces Cas and Dean, who've been having a quiet conversation.
He just waffles his hand and barks out, "Yeah, I know, Cas. Just go."
Balthazar slaps a hand on his chest, and Castiel shoots him a murderous glare.
And it’s not just the physical form that looks the same. This Benny’s essence is identical, too, and that is disconcerting. But it gives Castiel an idea. If they really are that similar, maybe this is connected to why they were pulled into this world.
Gesturing between himself and Dean, Cas replies, “We came through a rift between your world and ours. And now we appear to be stuck here.”
On instinct, he wraps his hand around his own cock, and manages one stroke before Benny pulls his hand away.
“Sam was manipulated by a demon. Ruby. She persuaded him to drink demon blood, and he changed.” The angel sounds almost apologetic as he explains, “If he has returned and killed Dean, I fear he cannot come back from that.”
The guy rolled his eyes and dropped his bag on the porch. Castiel watched as his hand disappeared into the pocket of his very worn jeans. He wasn't sure what the interloper was reaching for, but was relieved when he pulled out his phone.
"So, you don't have Cas, but you have a Benny?" Dean asks.
Dean steps back, pulling him with him, then leans over and quietly whispers, "Yeah, let's let them have their privacy."
Dean had Castiel bent over the end of his bed and was thrusting into him vigorously. Castiel was moaning, absolutely loving the feel of Dean inside him.
He becomes aware that each time Benny thrusts into him, he’s grinding his hips in circles in an attempt to get him deeper.
The guy visibly shuddered, seeming to resolve himself to the situation. "Name's Dean."
Considering Benny's a vampire, his hand is warm, and feels perfect as he begins to stroke him. "I love the way you move… your muscles… wanted you to touch me for so long."
"Let's go."
Dean grabbed the remote and turned the television and satellite on. "What's the name of this show? Or here..." Dean passed the remote to him.
He's definitely begging now, but he can't help it.
"Yeah." Dean nods. "It was a changing point for us. And it became routine. I'd hit the wall, crash and burn… and Benny would be there, singing me to peace when I came back around."
Dean grabs his hand and drags them to the weapons room, leaving Kevin and some of the angels to guard Michael. Charlie’s already beat them there and is rigging up with a gun as big as she is. If he hadn't seen her in action before, he'd question her choice.
"Fuck, Cas! That's so amazing. You're driving me crazy!" He starts fucking into Castiel relentlessly, stimulating his prostate from both sides. "Come for me, sweetheart. Come for me so I can fill you up, please?"
Cas averts his eyes as Dean gets dressed, and Dean doesn’t know if he’s disappointed or relieved. He’s not sure if he wants Cas staring at him in that way of his when he’s half naked.
The angel grabs a box of matches and a bottle of water from the bench holding the holy oil. Everyone watches as Chamuel strikes flame to the head, then tosses the stick to the ground behind Lucifer.
"We need to divide and conquer."
With a sense of apprehension building inside him, Castiel leaves the room with Dean, and they walk in the direction of the library. Hopefully at least one of the angels he sensed will be there, and will fill them in on what’s happened here.
Benny gives them both gentle pats on the shoulder. "Okay, but if either of you need to cut out, I'll make it perfectly clear to the crew that they don't get to hold it against you, ya’ hear?"
“A hunter’s send off would be the appropriate thing. But shouldn’t we find Sam first? It is his brother, after all.” Cas speaks with an air of detachment, as if he’s trying to distance himself from the emotional impact of seeing Dean dead.
They set off down an overgrown path, walking briskly at first, then slowing as they get far away enough to be out of earshot. “You never got to say goodbye to Benny.” It isn’t a question, more a statement.
As calloused fingertips trace up his spine, Dean said, "This wasn't exactly what I was thinking when I came up here for the week, but it's turning into a nice surprise."
Castiel looks to Balthazar in an attempt to gauge whether he should tell Inias what they want the blade for. Unfortunately, Balthazar is busy flirting with the waiter as he places the food on the table, and pays Castiel no attention. The angel really is incorrigible.
"Wakey wakey, Sleeping Beauty."
"Feels so good, Cas. Also, no talking about parents during sex. It's a rule. If I wasn't so turned on, you would have killed my boner." Dean looked down and asked, "Mind if I try something?"
“So… arrange it.” Castiel fixes Balthazar with a glare, in the hopes that he’ll get down to business. “Please,” he adds for politeness.
Leaning in to whisper in his ear, Benny says, "Think I wanna fuck you nice and slow, sweetheart. See how long I can keep you on edge."
all night is–“ Castiel can’t finish the thought, because Benny is indeed taking him apart with his fingers. He opens his legs wide to give his lover better access, and his knee knocks into Dean. There’s no reaction, and Castiel leaves his knee there, liking the thought that when Benny fucks him Dean will be able to feel it.
It wasn’t until the sun began to set again that he shook himself out of his self-pitying stupor, and realised he was hungry. He boiled himself some rice, and added a little sir fried chicken and vegetables, then ate it with all the enthusiasm of a dead fish.
Dean places his hand on the side of Benny’s head as his lover takes what looks like might be his last breath.
One of these games in particular caught Castiel’s eye; it was a shooting game, where the participant had to hit a row of ducks. Well… not actually ducks, more like metal shapes with ducks painted on them. There were a variety of prizes on offer, but Castiel instantly fell in love with a giant stuffed panda. He knew it was a child’s toy, but he wanted it, though he couldn’t explain why.
"I love you, too, Cas."
Benny kisses the inside of his thigh, licking along the skin above the femoral artery. He inhales deeply, eyes fluttering shut. "Sin in the guise of an angel… Don't mind if I do."
“I don’t eat vegan crap,
"We were in the front seat," Dean responded, full of snark.
The distaste is evident in Lucifer's tone as he almost spits, "There is nothing about you that I aspire to. Our father commanded all of Heaven to love His new children more than Himself, and you have gone against his word."
“You’re mistaken about us tipping Michael off, Inias,” Balthazar butts in, serious for once and clearly affronted at the accusation. “We’ve told no one of our mission, outside of our group in the bunker.”
“Yes. It’s been quite difficult for everyone.” Of course, some of their experiences in this world have been the opposite of difficult, but Castiel isn’t about to tell Inias that.
Inias stares at Castiel for a long moment, before angling his chin towards him. “And how do we know we can trust him?” he asks Balthazar.
Cas is close; after the amount of sex they’ve had over the last few hours, Benny knows the signs. The angel is making these endearing whimpering sounds, and his hand is hovering near his cock, ready to give it a few tugs.
he thinks, as he hears a commotion behind him.
Dean looks at him with consideration and comes back to him. "Okay, Cas. Let's do that then."
After all the anticipation, the moment finally arrives. Charlie recites the spell, and in a flash of light, Michael is inside the ring of holy fire. And
He could see the weight lift from Dean's shoulders. Interesting… for all of the man's bravado, he seemed somewhat relieved at not being judged.
Castiel has the urge to kick something. The timing for this essential trip couldn’t have been much worse… just when he was trying to prove to Dean that he wouldn’t be going anywhere. The look on the hunter’s face when he walked away had been heartwrenching, and what was worse, Castiel hadn't even been able to go after him.
Castiel could feel his vessel getting warmer, and he was sure his face was on fire. “I, er… thank you.” He had no idea how to deal with this overly friendly behaviour from Dean.
Castiel wasn’t sure what game they were playing here, but he could see the pleading look on Dean’s face. “Turn the car on, Dean,” he growled, shooting the hunter what he hoped was a ‘don’t mess with me’ expression.
"Yeah, sure thing, man. I've got all the stuff. It's a date." He flushed slightly, and Castiel started wondering if this attraction was more than one-sided. "Um, sounds like a plan, I mean."
"Hey, what's going on in your head?" Dean brushed his thumb over Castiel's cheekbone and stepped back. "You just spaced out on me for a bit."
"Dean." Benny's voice is clipped, like he's fighting just to get that much out.
The sensation is a mixture of pain and pleasure, and Castiel loves it. "You like the taste of angel?"
Castiel needs something to push him over the precipice he’s been on for what seems like hours, and since Benny doesn’t want him to touch himself, maybe there’s another way. He takes hold of Benny’s free hand and brings it to his mouth; licking the palm and over the fingers. Benny watches him with a knowing expression, and once it’s nice and wet he allows Castiel to slip it between their bodies, to his aching cock.
Cas shakes his head sadly. “I did not. But how likely is it that this,” he points to the spear Dean’s holding, “was the work of someone else? Knowing what we know, is it possible that Dean was attacked by someone other than Lucifer?”
His hunter steps away and moves to the wall. Picking up the blade they'd left there for just this purpose, Dean smashes it into the symbol they'd rigged up specifically to allow Cas and Lucifer back in.
He could only describe Dean's reaction as melting. He went pliant under Castiel's hands, body warm and malleable. "Cas," he whined.
Benny's hesitant to leave, but it sounds like he's not really wanted here, so he just fires off a quick little salute and says, "See ya’ in a few."
So... that art piece that made me cry? Yeah, it's those pinkies. The fact that we lucked into an artist who picked up on their importance... with zero prompting? Absolute bliss for my shipper soul.
Yep, there’s the Jo Dean loves and misses.
The angel looks distraught at Dean’s words, and he feels a little bad about the way he delivered that news. “Dean’s dead? I… was it Lucifer who delivered the fatal blow?”
– then turns to Dean and says seriously, “Chuck said he created thousands of worlds. I believe this is one we haven’t been to before.”
The second POV of this chapter contains the murder husband vibes. Trigger warnings for torture, blood, gore, scarification, Dean utilizing skills he'd rather not, Benny getting turned on by it, sexual sadism, and dark headspace. Please let us know if you feel we missed anything.
Castiel smiles and falls into step beside Dean. Perhaps they can all help each other, in more ways than one.
I love you.”
“I… I saw how you fucked Dean, and I want to feel it. Want to feel all of you… inside me.” He almost feels like he’s begging Benny now, but he gets the feeling that’s something the vampire really enjoys.
*coughs at the readers* You know what to do! 💙💚💙
Then Castiel felt a broad, strong hand at the small of his back, guiding him away. "C'mon, Cas. I think we've got better things to be doing now."
He watched as Dean thunked his head back against the headrest and bit his bottom lip. His right hand reached up and turned the key. "Tell me to put my seatbelt on and drive us to the bunker."
"Well, it reached a point where I just couldn't go on anymore. I was exhausted, man. Mentally, physically, emotionally drained. I needed a break. And Benny… it was still kinda touch and go with us, but I must have been zoning the fuck out." He huffs out a small laugh. "Because I come out of it, and this cajun vampire I've been giving all kinds of hell has my head in his lap, and is humming and singing to me."
It seems like Cas isn't ready either, and they stay like that until Lucifer comes to find them.
The switch in Michael's attention is instantaneous. He steps toward the flames and spits out, "Coward. Hiding behind humanity, like the good monkey you've always been."
he begs, eyes filling with tears.
“And I would have kept it as a fantasy between Dean and I if you hadn’t been so responsive. So willing.”
For an emotionless Ken doll, the angel sure sounds upset. Maybe the angels in this world aren’t a bunch of dicks; unlike the ones they’ve encountered in their world. Cas excepted… obviously.
Benny sinks to his knees. "Damn, brother. What happened? You were just supposed to be out making the rounds."
Balthazar is brutally matter-of-fact when he recounts the details to Inias, and Castiel almost wishes he had added a few embellishments to make it sound less grim.
Benny sucks harder and pulls back to look down at the perfect impression of teeth and bruising he's left behind. Then he bends Castiel's knees toward his chest and pets over his hole.
Castiel was all for Dean’s sudden need for haste. He wanted to kiss Dean again, and more, and even though this was away from the crowd at the duck shoot, it wasn’t nearly private enough. He did as Dean commanded, and quickly climbed into the passenger seat, smiling at Dean as he appeared around the other side of the car and opened his door.
He looks up at Benny to find him staring back with a look that suggests he’s more than willing to test that theory.
Benny takes his time, caressing over Castiel's prostate while his thumb strokes at his perineum. It's overwhelming, and when Benny leans forward to kiss him, Castiel grabs him fiercely, wanting as much contact as he can get.
"You know a guy," Castiel drily responds.
. Castiel didn’t know what to think. He’d often had inappropriate thoughts of getting close to Dean, but could he stop that from becoming obvious in this situation… in public? Dean was waiting for an answer though, so he said a hesitant, "Yes.”
They walk swiftly down the halls to Sam's door, where Dean steps aside and leans against the wall, out of the immediate line of sight. He nods at Castiel and says, "You're up, sunshine."
It comes to its last notes, and Benny and Bobby both light torches and approach the pyre. They set flame to the wood, and Benny begins a eulogy.
He lets it linger for a few seconds then pulls away, dazed. "We gotta go, cher."
There was some rustling in the background, before Bobby spoke again. “What’s his name, and who’s he saying he rented it from?”
Castiel didn’t much like the sound of that; he would much prefer Dean to have a different purpose for his ass. He mentally slapped himself for his inappropriate thoughts, and turned to the two doors. “Which bedroom would you like?”
He watched as the guy opened the back door of his admittedly gorgeous car, pulled out a large duffle bag and slung it over his shoulder, then slammed the door shut.
It’s lucky that Benny is taking such care of him physically, because otherwise he might start thinking too deeply about him saying he would make Castiel remember him. The implication that they won’t stay together isn’t something he wants to think about.
Castiel had to let go of Dean’s penis to open his pants, and the hunter let out a sigh as he released his hold. He slipped them and his underwear down until he got them low enough to kick off onto the floor of the car. Once he had removed his shoes and socks he got the rest of his clothing out of the way, leaving him completely naked.
When Benny slides a finger in alongside his tongue, Castiel nearly loses his mind. His nerve endings are tingling, and he pushes back against the vampire to get him deeper.
Demon.
- and the mugs. He heated water up in the microwave and went to the fridge to get the milk.
He could hear Dean muttering under his breath about hippies and tofu, and someone named Sam, but he ignored it as he surveyed the food still on the counter.
Dean stops and turns to face Castiel. He's not trying to hide the tears anymore. "Man, what the hell is wrong with us? All of us! Always sacrificing ourselves for the greater good, making the choice that's going to leave everyone else broken. When does it stop, Cas?"
Cas holds his hand out as a glow starts to emanate from his fingers, in an obvious attempt to keep the rift open, but it doesn’t work. They’re well and truly stuck, and for a few moments they both stare at the empty space as if willing it to return.
The grin that breaks out on Benny's face hurts his cheeks, and he laughs quietly. "Hmm, guess I'm no prince. But let me try again."
Dean also looked at the man and asked, "How many ducks to win the panda?"
When they reached the car, Dean opened the back door and turned to Castiel. "Gimme the bear." Reluctant to let go, but knowing he couldn't very well carry it in the front seat, he surrendered his panda and watched as Dean placed it on the back passenger's seat and fastened the belt around it. "There. All nice and secure."
He knows those words hadn’t been meant for his ears, however, and now that he’s returned for a second time, he’s hoping that he’s able to pretend like he hadn’t heard a thing. He’s pulled up short, however, when this time he hears Dean sobbing and Cas apologizing for what he’d said earlier.
Panning left, he finds what he was really hoping to miss.
Dean moans, "I'm only letting you get away with this because I'm pretty sure we didn't get sucked into this world for the porn."
Dean’s fingers were brushing Castiel’s bare chest now, and he suddenly understood why Dean had reacted the way he did. The feeling of his lover touching his skin was like nothing he could describe, but he knew he didn’t want it to stop.
"I love how filthy your mouth gets when I'm inside you, angel. And don't think I don't know you have an exhibitionist streak. You made me scream your name in that Burger King bathroom last week, then came when you heard that guy clear his throat in the next stall."
Dean's grin was one of those special ones that could light up an entire room, and Castiel felt torn when he asked, "Think you can get the rest now?"
"Shit, this thing is lumpy. Jody needs to get something new if she's gonna be inviting people to stay here," Dean grumbled.
He suppressed a shiver as Dean moved closer and positioned his arms. "Take the gun and brace it so the butt sits firmly in the cradle of your shoulder," Dean tapped to the right of his collarbone, "then line the sight up with your target. To compensate for the misaligned sight, you need to aim about a centimeter to your left. Got it?"
"No idea what you're doin' back there, darlin', but don't you dare fucking stop."
Benny thinks, before he’s coming, fucking up into Cas as the angel comes too. As he cries out in ecstasy, and the white liquid spurts out of him, his hand stutters on Dean’s dick, but he continues to jerk him.
He wasn’t sure why sleeping on the sofa would be better because of a supposedly sexy TV show. Maybe Dean meant that he would be more comfortable in a bed afterwards because…
Castiel can’t argue with that logic. Maybe this calls for something more delicate than just smiting, and taking what they came for. He would also like to know how he didn’t realize they were demons until Balthazar pointed them out. How were they able to disguise their nature from him, but not Balthazar?
Lucifer shakes his head, and rushes at Michael without warning, knocking him to the ground.
It felt like Dean was staring into his soul. "Cas, I'm going to kiss you now. If you don't want me to, say something now."
either," he angles his chin at Dean on the ground.
Michael steps to the edge of the circle, just out of the flames' reach, eyes a cold, icy blue contrast to the fire. "Hello, son. Though, you're not really
"Cas, we could really use you and Lucifer here. Now. We've got demons in the bunker."
Following the man inside, he took in their surroundings. It was a nicely furnished cabin, with a sofa and a couple of armchairs, an adjacent kitchen area, and two doors leading off from the living room. It looked like there was enough space for the two of them, so maybe it would work out okay.
As it is, he's staring down at his feet, rubbing over his jaw, when the door opens. Cas is standing on the other side, looking like shit warmed over.
“There was a time when your sense of humour would have thrown me. But not anymore. It’s a part of you to admire, just like your freckles.” Castiel had had enough of waiting and he grabbed a handful of Dean’s shirt and yanked him forward into a bruising kiss.
“Y-yes. Fuck,” Castiel panted, finding it difficult all of a sudden to form a coherent sentence.
That was the second time Rock, Paper, Scissors had been brought up during this very strange day. “I accept that challenge.”
Castiel can feel his climax building, like a slow burn coming to the boil. Benny had promised to fuck him nice and slow, and he’s obviously a man – vampire – of his word. With every push forward, they moan in perfect harmony, and Castiel wonders just how long they can keep going like this.
Taking a swallow of beer, Dean looked at him and said, "Cas, it's nice of you, but I got this." He grinned and added, "Besides, you get the couch tomorrow night."
“Sounds like a match made in heaven,” Bobby’s voice said through the phone.
Dean and Cas exchange a look that's a mixture of confusion and concern. “This is very strange.”
The vampire pushes his wet fingers into Castiel's channel and strokes along his walls as he pumps them in and out with unfaltering rhythm. It's horrible and amazing, and the feel of that thickness spreading him open, getting him ready for Benny's cock, is the sweetest torment.
Lifting his hips, Dean pushed his jeans down as much as he could, given Castiel's position. His underwear were tented, and Castiel reached out to slowly pull the waistband down.
The ominous threat that’s emanating from the direction of the dungeon becomes stronger as they approach, and Castiel sees a boiling rage in Michael’s eyes as they walk through the door.
"Just two more." Castiel felt himself tense as Dean rested his hands on his shoulders. "Still too tight, though. Take a breath and let that tension out. This isn't the end of the world," he ended with a snicker.
"Oh…" Dean shifted, and there was a tension in the room that would require something far sharper than a knife to cut. "I'm sorry, dude. That wasn't what I was trying to imply… I mean, yeah, it's probably true, but, um…"
The thought of any version of Sam and Dean not being as close as the brothers he knows and loves is unfathomable to Castiel. What on earth has happened here, to cause such bad feelings between them?
even exist here. What if…" Dean pauses, and Castiel tilts his head. "Cas, can you sense a version of yourself, or hell, even any other angels, here?"
“Balthazar,” Inias says with a hell of a lot less enthusiasm, before staring at Castiel. “You’re an angel. Why don’t I recognize you?”
When Castiel woke up the next morning, it was with the intention of leaving. Dean could have the cabin, and he would just spend his vacation in his apartment, catching up on his reading and chores.
The indulgent smirk on Dean's face as Castiel sat in the front seat and buckled his seatbelt made him blush. Then he lifted his "dom brow", as he'd heard it referred to, and palmed Dean's thigh. "Shouldn't you be driving?"
"Hey, brother, you're back from patrolling early. When did you find time to shave?" Benny glances at Dean closer, then Cas, and something shifts in his tone as he adds, "And who's your friend?"
Benny can’t help but be impressed by Dean’s refusal to be baited by Michael. A lesser man would surely have snapped by now, but Dean… it just makes Benny admire him that little bit more.
Castiel had brought a lot of vegetables - including his favourite, kale - and he could see Dean turning his nose up at them as they put his food away. He wasn’t too surprised though, as Dean’s food shop seemed to have consisted mostly of meat and beer.
Cas slowly pulls away and a tiny smile appears at the corners of his mouth; if Dean wasn’t allergic to such things, he might even describe it as radiant.
They'd spent hours having sex on every surface of the room. After making love on the bed, Benny had pulled Cas off the mattress and carried him over for a second round against the wall. Then he'd bent him over the table and fucked him rough, and that time Cas came on nothing but his cock. He'd taken him slow and sensual, pressed face first into the door. Put him on all fours and screwed him at the foot of the bed, where they could both watch Dean sleeping contentedly.
Benny nods in agreement, before heading off down the hallway and out of sight. The red lights create an eerie atmosphere, and as Dean sets off in the other direction, he gets an uncomfortable feeling in his gut.
As the three of them instinctively press closer together, a chuckle comes from Benny, squished at the bottom of the pile. “Hey, are you guys tryin’ to suffocate me?”
"Aww, c'mon, Bobby. Don't be like that."
Dean nods in agreement, but doesn't speak a word. Castiel realizes that Dean is about to watch a version of himself be given last rites, and if he wasn't currently carrying the body of that Dean, he'd reach out to his own.
Castiel’s mortification was increasing, because he was going to have to spell it out, and then Dean wouldn’t want to look at him. “I wanted to leave because you talking about needing to sleep in the bed after watching a hot episode of Dr. Sexy made me think that you wanted to be comfortable to… to masturbate. And then I became aroused.”
Dean groans and rolls his hips into the touch. "Dammit, Cas. Do I need to go get the shackles?"
He wrapped his lips around the little bud and flicked it with his tongue. He delighted in the noises Dean made at this, and repeated the action before moving to the other nipple.
That gets a smile out of him. "Says the mighty cat interrogator."
“He was. He did.” Cas has a fond look on his face, and Dean realizes in that moment that Cas misses Benny too.
He didn’t want to ruin Jody and Donna’s knives, so he opened another drawer, and was relieved to find what he was looking for. Once he’d popped the cap off his bottle, he took a sip, feeling like he’d earned it.
Dean's groan was something he would endeavor to draw from him more frequently. "How are you still so innocent? And you have no idea how sexy it is… So dominant and naive at the same time. Like that time you pushed me against that alley wall? Just… do you have any idea how turned on I was?"
Dean laughs and moves along; these two have got this area.
"I've got groceries in my car. Don't know that it's enough for two people for a week, but it'll be easier getting it in with a second set of hands."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean nods and replies, "Okay, so we find Sam and fill him in. We'll figure out the rest after."
This isn’t the first time Castiel has had to explain his and Dean’s presence here, but it’s the first time he’s been made to feel so unwelcome. “A rift opened between our world and yours, and we stepped through it when Dean was killed… We were unable to save him, and the rift closed before we could return.”
"Balthazar, perhaps you could focus and tell me what's happened," Inias snipes.
"If I'm too loud, how will you shut me up? Will you put your hand over my mouth… or will you stick your cock in it?" Castiel smiles at the wide-eyed look Benny gives him at that suggestion.
Dean snuggles his head into Benny's neck, then his words must register because those gorgeous green eyes finally focus, and Benny nods in Cas's direction.
Chamuel shakes his head. “I don’t recognize the name.”
Inias speaks in strained Enochian. "You can't hear him?"
Benny's hand twists on his dick expertly, and he cries out so loudly, Dean stirs a little. He doesn't really know if he prefers for Dean to stay sleeping, or wake up. It would be quite a sight to awaken to.
Knowing that they are fantasizing over him as much as he is fantasizing about them… Well, he’d needed some private time after that. He’d locked himself in his room and promptly gotten himself off while Cas’s words played on a loop in his head.
Dean doesn't really know how to react, what to say. "We didn't see who did it. Just saw him get hit."
An agonizing few seconds pass when nothing happens, before Benny coughs suddenly and his eyes flicker open.
Maybe it’s time for another first; sex with Benny.
The two angels nod their assent, and he continues, "Bobby, Rufus, you think you two can handle the bone?"
That sounds like it’s going to be torture, and Castiel looks forward to every drawn out moment of it. As Benny removes his fingers from Castiel’s mouth, he breathes out a barely audible sigh. “Please. I need it… need you.”
Turning back to Dean he was about to speak again, but was distracted once again by a drop of liquid running over the man’s lip and down his chin. “I, um… would you like me to cook something?”
"Please, Dean. Can we stop just long enough to turn him around?" Castiel pleaded.
Castiel steps up to the door and knocks sharply.
"Holy shit, Cas, keep talking dirty like that and I'm not gonna last," Benny utters as he slams in harder… and deeper.
Benny dives in for a kiss, and it's full of all the things they're not saying. There's a desperation tempered by learned control, as Benny ravishes his mouth.
Dean smiles painfully, nods a little, and he doesn't know which of them he's trying to convince when he says, "You’re gonna be okay."
The indecent moan that Dean let out caused an intense reaction in Castiel, and he ground his own erection against Dean’s. They were both breathing heavily as Castiel leaned back up and moved his hands to open the fastenings on his pants, hoping that Dean would follow suit and undress with him.
Dean looks up at Castiel with a mixture of gratitude, affection, and hesitation in his eyes, then transfers that gaze to Benny. "Not gonna lie to you, I'd love nothing more than to not see my body in flames again. Hell was already one time too many. But turning away… that's not me, man. And I'm betting it wasn't
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Castiel asks, resisting the urge to wipe the tear from Dean’s face.
He bumped Castiel with his shoulder as he moved past him to get to the front door.
As much as Benny had wanted to tell the assembled group what they'd found, Balthazar had insisted on being the one to ‘give the good news’, so once Benny has everyone’s attention, he sits down in the corner and lets the angel talk.
“This song feels very appropriate, and it obviously means a lot to Benny,” Castiel observes, noticing the emotion pouring out of Benny as he sings.
Inias shoots Balthazar a seething look and turns back to Castiel. "You must have tipped Michael off somehow. He's warning all of us of what will happen to those who interfere with his plans."
“Would it-” Castiel let out a loud groan, as Dean twisted his wrist a little, in a way that made him see stars. “Ohhhhhh…”
Benny sucks his cock down until it's pushing at the back of his throat. He looks up Castiel's body then swallows around his length, the resistance lessening.
The hunter pulled away, breathing labored, and his voice was a low groan as he urged, "Need to get you home before I get us both arrested for indecent exposure."
Of course Dean would enjoy something so trashy; Castiel should have expected that. “Of course. I wouldn’t want to deprive you of something you enjoy. I will probably be reading anyway.”
A couple minutes later, he comes across Ellen as she's dispatching her own group of enemies, completely unassisted. He's not ashamed to admit, it's kinda hot watching her work.
"I know." He felt Dean's lips curl against his shoulder, then the gentlest of kisses.
“Well, that’s just great,” Dean interrupts sarcastically.
“Don’t come cryin’ to me when it doesn't work,” Dean mutters under his breath, and judging by the non-reaction in the room, only Cas and Benny heard it.
Castiel could feel himself bristling at the impertinence. “I’m not here to fix anything, except maybe your attitude.” He gestured to his smart trench coat and suit, to ask an unspoken question of this unwanted visitor. Did he look like a handyman?
Dean can feel the corners of his mouth tilting up in fondness. Stupid angel, always saying the right words... whether he knows it or not. "Thanks, Cas."
“I already have.” Balthazar grins, and Castiel could happily smack him. “He’ll be here in...” He looks up at the clock on the wall before waving to a waiter. “Five minutes. Just in time to share some food with us.”
“Like some kind of creep who gets off on thinking about you in that way. I don’t usually say things like this, I swear.”
The smile Benny offers is anything but decent. The vampire leans in and growls in his ear, "You know, with the things I've heard… the way you took Dean apart while this mouth of yours talked such glorious filth… Well, I didn't expect you to be so adorably innocent."
Realising he hadn’t spoken for a few seconds, he tried to engage his brain, and form words. “But… I rented this place through a friend of a friend. I need a vacation, and I was here first.”
"Where do you want to sit, Cas?"
Castiel found the TV guide button on the remote control, and found the show he wanted. He was feeling terrible about Dean having to sleep here now, especially after what he’d said about sleeping in such awful places. Maybe the kindest thing would be for him to stay on this lumpy sofa instead.
"Think of you like what?"
A strong palm smoothes up his inner thigh and spreads him further apart, making room for Benny's hips. Castiel feels the silky length of his cock brush against the crease of his thigh, right over where Benny had marked him, and it makes him gasp out.
Castiel knows it's a ruse, that Dean's grasping at the excuse to go, but as he doesn't really want to stay much longer, he lets him.
“Ohh, really? That’s very interesting information. I had no idea you like to be dominated…” Castiel purposefully placed emphasis on that last word. “Maybe I should tell you to pull over on the next available side road and get into the backseat? How would you respond to that?” His hand had now reached the bulge in Dean’s jeans, but he barely grazed it over the cloth.
“That’s the spirit,” Balthazar responds. “We’ll also be needing a bone from someone who encountered him.”
Quirking his brow at them, he carries on while they grumble.
Balthazar huffs under his breath, "Do I have to do everything?"
"Lopping someone's head off with a machete isn't really a Hallmark card moment, you know?" Dean throws it out with so much self-hatred in his voice.
As Dean slowly ground against him, Castiel let out a gasp, then crushed their mouths together in a kiss that quickly had them both panting.
Balthazar snorts with derision, and slaps Inias on the back. “He isn’t even able to hear angel radio. How’s he going to contact Michael? Smoke signals?”
Castiel pulled Dean’s body closer, loving how that firm body felt pressed against his. He was trapped between Dean and the counter, and it felt amazing. It had been way too long since he’d even kissed another person, let alone had such a thrilling encounter with someone he found so attractive.
At least he isn’t plagued by nightmares… unlike Dean. Castiel is well aware that Benny insisted on Dean killing him, and Dean has never forgiven himself for it. Strangely, though, these nightmares of Dean’s are not of Benny’s death as it actually happened, but of a different scenario altogether. It’s probably Dean subconsciously giving himself hell… or maybe not. Maybe it’s something they haven’t considered; a vision from this world, perhaps.
Cas looks back over his shoulder at Dean, who's still pulling on his boots. "We'll be okay. He just needs to believe that I'll always be here for him."
Looking up with a burning rage in his eyes, Benny says, "This what killed him?"
Castiel is just as surprised as Dean when, instead of lighting a flame, Benny begins to sing.
As they stride down the hall, Castiel can sense Dean's inner turmoil. His friend is hurting, and being stranded in this world where he's already seen his own death, and now knows he's estranged from his brother, is not encouraging for what they're sure to encounter here.
Castiel’s breath hitches and he’s momentarily lost for words. Nodding mutely, he shows his desire by yanking Benny in for another kiss, clashing their teeth together as he reaches back to grab the vampire’s hand and press a finger to his hole.
Benny's instincts are amazing, though, because he strokes a palm down Castiel's torso until he reaches the spot Castiel so desperately needs touched.
“It seems Michael appeared to a nun in Portugal, asking to be honored.” Balthazar rolls his eyes at this. “So, one of her bones will do nicely. And lastly, we require an archangel blade. And I just so happen to have located one in a cemetery in India.”
He and Dean both grab guns and knives and holsters, then his hunter turns to him and grasps him by the back of the neck, puts their foreheads together.
Cas gives him a look; one that Dean interprets as ‘stop being so self-deprecating’. “I also know what your list of friends looks like.”
Dean let go of the seat and reached up to draw Castiel into another kiss. It was slow and easy, as Dean trailed his hands down his back to tease at the edge of his pants. "Off, please," he whispered against Castiel's lips.
“While you were distracted by your frankly pathetic attempt at trapping me–” Michael looks down at the holy fire, but doesn’t step through. He might be calling it pathetic, but he’s not able to escape, “–my demons crept in and are currently combing this bunker for my blade. You think you can stop me? I am unstoppable!”
"Fuck, Cas, you're so goddamn sexy. Can't wait to feel you come all over me. Wanna know how you sound when you fall apart. Need to see you, please? Let me see those gorgeous fucking eyes while you spill across my hand? Please, baby?"
The first time had been about half an hour ago, and when he’d realized that Dean and Cas were having sex, he’d quickly turned to walk away. He'd suspected there was something between the two of 'em. They had that couple energy, though it felt kinda new. But what did he know? He is stopped in his tracks before he can walk away, however, when Cas says just about the hottest thing he’s ever heard.
Castiel decided to take a look around, and see if there was anything in this place that wouldn’t cause him to scream. There were stalls; some selling food, which was all incredibly unhealthy, and some that were games, which generally involved hitting a target and winning a prize.
As Dean left the kitchen, Castiel could hear him muttering under his breath, but didn't catch what he was actually saying.
Dean inhaled deeply and used his turn signal to indicate he was changing lanes. After a few minutes, he veered off at a tree-lined drive and pulled into an area concealed from the main road. Parked, his seatbelt unfastened, Dean quickly opened his door and moved to get in the back seat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure, brother.” Benny just wants to pull Cas into his arms and hold him; tell him everything’s going to be okay. But he has a feeling that might make things worse, so he pats Cas on the shoulder before the angel goes over to Balthazar and they disappear, along with Bobby and Rufus.
Castiel kept his gaze down as his cheeks burned furiously. “Please, can you just let me die of shame alone? I’m sure you don’t want to think of me like that.”
Cas squints his eyes, and tilts his head. For a few seconds, he stays like that before saying, “I sense a great disturbance in the warps.”
He watched as Dean twisted the cap off with his bare hand and swallowed some of the liquid. The sight of his cheeks hollowing out and his Adam's apple bobbing was far too enticing, so he moved to the nearest drawer to see what it contained.
"Oh, don't worry, sweetheart, I'm not done with you yet," Benny taunts as he nibbles a path to Castiel's cock. Eyes full of teasing promise look up at him, and Castiel can see a hint of fang when Benny continues, "You look absolutely delicious spread out for me like this."
Castiel looked back up at the stranger. “I don’t think Bobby is very sympathetic to your plight.”
Scoffing, Dean spits out, "That bitch got her claws into my brother here, too?" He turns to Cas, scrambling for hope. "I didn't see who threw the spear. And I'm pretty sure you didn't either. Did you sense anyone?"
Easing onto shaky legs, Dean throws on his dead guy robe and heads down the hall, gunfire still ringing in his ears.
"Cassie seems to be impervious to the rules of our world." Balthazar is almost shouting over whatever the voice in his head is telling him, and the customers at the neighboring table get up and move to the other side of the patio area.
“Well, if you’re sure.” Castiel wasn’t sure at all, but he wasn’t exactly going to get into a fight with Dean over it. He picked up the plates and brought them to the kitchen, and started to wash them, absent-mindedly, before Dean walked over and joined him.
Dean sighs, squeezes the bridge of his nose, and quietly says, "Why couldn't it have been squirrel world?"
Castiel wonders how many hunter’s funerals they’ve had to hold, for an angel to know the procedure so well. It’s a sobering thought, but one he’s not able to dwell on for long, as he finds himself helping to carry the body of their fallen comrade.
Cas gasps, and clutches at Dean’s shoulder, as if to reassure himself that he’s still there. When Dean pats Cas’s hand, he releases his grip and gives him an apologetic look. “Sorry, Dean. I… that was–” He stops talking, obviously having trouble putting his emotions into words.
"Yeah… We were on the other side of a rift, our side, and saw your Dean get pierced through by that. Didn't see who did it, though." Dean inhales, breath shuddering, and continues, "I'm truly sorry."
"I mean, if this Dean is anything like me…" He glances over at his friend. "C'mon, Cas. You know what my list of enemies looks like."
"No, but if you think I'm letting go of you anytime soon…" Dean tries to play it off like he's joking, but his words are real, and he's not ready.
. He grinned at Castiel as he handed over his money and climbed into the large circular object along with several other people, which then proceeded to spin around at an alarming speed.
Dean. He's lying dead in the hall. Got struck down by this–" He holds out the spear. "It's what we think pulled us through."
Sam the salad freak? Probably his girlfriend, because no way was this vision of sex on legs single. And there was even less chance of him being into men, wasn’t there? Strange that Dean didn’t bring his girlfriend on vacation with him though. “I do eat meat, as long as it’s accompanied by vegetables,” he said to Dean’s obvious disgust, then subtly asked, “So, Sam… she doesn’t eat meat at all?”
“Oh, baby. Look at you, taking it all in.” Benny looks awestruck as they keep pace with each other.
Benny's tongue is skillful, and he adds a finger which nails Castiel’s prostate. He jolts upwards as white hot pleasure courses through him. "Holy fucking shit," he shouts, blasphemously.
Dean reaches out and pulls Cas in for a hug. He whispers in his friend's ear, "I'm glad you came back to me, man. I don't know what I would have done with both of you gone."
Lucifer turns to Chamuel and comments, "Now, if you would."
Carrying Dean’s dead body is more than a little disconcerting. Castiel knows that it isn’t
“You miss Benny,” Cas states, matter-of-factly.
There it was - the bedroom.
The door creaks slightly as it opens, and they move into the darkened room. Dean flips on the light behind Castiel, and he takes in their surroundings. Nothing seems out of place; maybe Sam is somewhere else in the bunker.
“Lay down,” he said, voice husky from want.
Feeling emboldened, Castiel winks down at him. "Wait until you taste me," he purrs.
Dean rolled his hips up against Castiel's front, and he could feel the length of his erection brushing against his abdomen. Growling, he sank his teeth into the meat of Dean's pectoral, marking him in a way he'd only dreamed of before.
There was a snort, followed by a soft laugh. "Alright, my bad, Cas." Dean stepped toward the island and pulled one of the stools out. "Whatcha cooking, then?"
