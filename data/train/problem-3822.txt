asked me if you were feeling okay, Cas, and he is the
Dean’s eyes had never been so wide in his life. He nodded, mute, and Castiel’s head tilted, his brows furrowing dangerously.
Castiel made a sound halfway between a groan and a sob this time, and leaned away from Dean for a second, half of Dean’s body suddenly bereft, to reach for the nightstand. Dean heard a bottle cap and snickered at the obscene squirting noise that followed. He tossed the covers off with his free arm and tried to turn his head to see what Cas was doing, but Cas was holding him immobile, one arm tight around his chest. Dean had a moment of panic but he fought it down; Cas wouldn’t be so casual about taking him up the ass, he’d made that much clear.
“ - of a nature that required him to trust me completely and to step some distance out of his comfort zone.”
"He told me the night before Thanksgiving, but maybe I wasn't meant to tell you. He said he stopped believing in beauty after the towers fell, Dean, and that he stopped reading poetry then." Sam looked worried as Dean's face fell. "Don't tell him I told you, okay Dean?"
José grinned. “I wish it was MY last day. Bad day at school. I got suspended for fighting.“
Dean nodded, and the two of them fell silent for a minute, pointedly not looking at each other.
Okay?”
Slight misunderstanding, then sex and fluff. :-)
“Okay fine but could you

to finish this paper today, Dean."
Dean’s voice was still husky, but it shook a little, and Castiel shook his head firmly.
forgive me Dean?”
Castiel struggled underneath him, and Dean reluctantly shifted his weight to release Cas from the cage of his arms, instead of giving in to the sudden urge to wrap his arms around him and kiss him again.
"That's just cardio. I'll do some pushups later or something. Get out of here, wouldja?" Sam grinned and pulled on his headphones for emphasis, so Dean grabbed his jacket and the paper with the addresses and made his way out to Baby to check his map for the best way to hit all three.
Castiel peered at his house number on his door. It was black on a white door, several inches tall, and he looked puzzled as he pulled the door open, waved them inside.
Time stuttered to a stop as Castiel lost his grip on it, Dean frozen, waiting at Castiel’s pleasure, Castiel staring down at him in awe. He distinctly remembered watched
“Good,” Castiel agreed, nodding and speaking a little louder as he pressed the remote button for the garage and the door started to rattle down. “I understand. I will try to abide by your wishes, but I will likely fail and I hope you will be able to forgive me on those occasions.”  He grinned at Dean as he turned to bound up his stairs, taking them two at a time without visible effort.
he is. That big fuckin’ dick of yours, you’d split me open, Cas. You wanna split me open? You wanna pin me down, feel me screaming under you? You wanna make me beg for mercy, while you fuck me ‘til I can’t walk?”

Lonely?
Zachariah peered up at the two of them from the paper on his desk, frowning.
“Maybe.” Dean grinned smugly, then laughed, in a lilting cascade of completely uncharacteristic, joyful giggles. “No. I really didn’t mean to, Cas, I just… I told you, the second I felt your eyes on me I wanted you so bad it hurt.”
need to go with Dean then, Castiel? Couldn’t we send someone less valuable to the team with him and have them report back to you?”
Dean grinned at Castiel’s snort, a note of bashfulness creeping into his voice despite his best efforts.
Castiel’s breath whispered over the end of Dean’s cock again as he begged, leaning in close, his hand hypnotically rising and falling, and Dean lost his fight, reluctantly nodding his permission as his eyes fluttered shut in embarrassment, then flew open again in shock as the searing heat of Castiel’s mouth sank down over the head of his cock and just… kept going, swallowing him down and down, until he was fucking Castiel’s throat, everything surreal now, this impossible thing happening, Castiel’s eagerness more arousing than any level of competence Dean had ever experienced, Castiel's obvious relish utterly incendiary.
experienced, Sam.” He waggled his eyebrows in Sam’s direction, still not looking in case Sam was naked, but he looked to Dean for help, his eyes urgent.
Sam quietly extended a fist, and Dean bumped it with his own, smiling softly. Dean pushed in the cassette that was sticking halfway out of the player, and they rode the rest of the way home to Zeppelin blaring out of Baby’s warm, ancient speakers.
“Okay,” Dean accepted with relief, blowing out the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “Thank you.”
Castiel cut himself off abruptly, shaking his head again, as if to banish his thoughts.

“Yes, of
“You aren’t supposed to hang out with your boner out, either,” Dean finally managed, regretting it instantly as Castiel’s face free fell about a thousand feet and he rolled away, reaching for his towel, to wrap it self-consciously around his waist, searching the floor until he found his briefs. He lifted them to his face to sniff and grimaced, and Dean silently pulled a fresh pair out of his duffel and brought them over, his face just as crimson as Cas’s.
Castiel can fuck me whenever he feels like it, okay, Cas?”
? Why do you
“Cas, this is José. His Mom is an angel. She set me up with my entire work wardrobe from the unclaimed orders rack at her job.”
had never happened before. Dean grinned at him and Castiel grinned back, and they each took a swallow from their respective bottles. Dean had chosen a brand he’d seen Castiel buy but hadn’t tried before. It was dark and rich and Dean raised an eyebrow at Castiel in appreciation, savoring the aftertaste as it changed a little on the back of his tongue. “This is fantastic, Cas.”
"He quoted something I forget after,  that kind of sounded like he might be starting to feel better..." Sam looked worried as hell but Dean's face lit up a little.
Castiel’s voice dropped to a barely audible murmur, but Dean heard every word as if he were shouting, holding his expression perfectly blank while the inexplicable thrill tickled up and down his spine.
“Cas,
Castiel snorted, helping Dean to his feet. “Ahh, youthful vigor,” he sighed, and Dean smirked at him as he stood up.  Castiel laughed as Dean’s eyes practically crossed and he
“Deal,” Dean agreed, holding out his hand. They shook on it, and then Dean pulled out his wallet and riffled through the twenties. “I surely don’t have enough, can I give you what I have and bring the rest when I pick her up? Frank nodded, mouthing his cost, and Dean controlled his face perfectly as he emptied his wallet into Frank’s hand. Frank grinned anyway, shaking his head, so Dean went ahead and let the pain show as Frank’s grin grew wider.
Castiel accepted the remaining half-packet of lube Dean handed him, squeezing the rest of the packet into his hand and making a face at the sensation.
“It’s fine Dean, don’t worry about it. I’ll clean it up later. Three to one odds not with my mouth.” Castiel grinned, shaking his head and flushing slightly as Dean gaped at him in disbelief he would say such a thing. Castiel glanced at the label of his beer bottle suspiciously as if it might be to blame. “I
“I heard, and that did factor into our decision. Thank you in advance for your discretion.”
“No, no,” Dean assured Sam, “nothing like that, I just had a good night. Sharked some frat boys for a couple bills, they’ll be bringing me fresh meat next week, hung out with Cas -”
Dean’s hands twitched on his knees but he did not dare reach for his own cock, did not dare to break eye contact; did his damndest to keep his eyes fixed on Castiel’s face. Castiel wasn’t thrusting as deep this time, taking his time - or needing more time, he

but April just a little bit more, and he sipped his beer and wondered about that, staring blankly at the television without paying any attention until he heard the water stop, only then focusing on the television screen enough to realize he was technically watching porn.
” Dean had begged, “
Castiel was puzzled for a second until he had the horrifying realization that Dean meant “Better than last week?”
Cold beers were distributed, plates handed around, napalm was eagerly scooped onto them around Dean’s wincing that the dish was going to come apart, and three men valiantly tried not to burn their faces off, blowing on forkfuls and hissing as they scalded their tongues and quenched them with mouthfuls of beer. Soon enough the meal was edible and Dean and Castiel ate slowly, watching Sam eat as a spectator sport.
I am new to sharing *writing* though, and my experience with last week was that the more intimate and emotional the chapter, the *less* feedback I got, so from where I'm sitting the parts I poured the *most* of my humanity into and worked the *most diligently* on to get that chord of emotion just right felt like they got the highest ratio of crickets. Plus, I was traveling alone and extra needy and probably took it extra personally. So I half apologize & half double down: I am needy and petulant and my creation toiling speed is about 25 hours per 5k start to finish which huuuurts, so if I make you feel *anything* please pop by with a smiley or a keysmash or a sentence, *anything* to keep me from holing up with my beta and taking a long self-pity publishing hiatus.
“I have many shirts exactly like this one Dean,” Castiel rejoined in an affronted tone. “I happen to LIKE this shirt - “
Sam barked a laugh and reported, “José says he told his Mom we’d be ordering because you always want her food after Mrs Rodrìguez feeds you anything, and that he already told her to make extra for Cas.”
Castiel and Sam glanced up from the kitchen table as Dean joined them, his hair wet and his eyes sparkling.
They rode in relative silence for several miles, the only sound the engine polishing her bag of stones, the vents rattling hot air, and the tapestry of traffic noise around them. At the the interstate cloverleaf traffic came to a standstill and Dean risked interrupting Castiel’s concentration.
“I’m sorry I put you in that situation, Dean.”
Dean crossed to the closet and Castiel just barely averted his eyes in time before Dean was naked again, this time pulling on boxer-briefs and worn jeans and a soft grey henley.  He grabbed a pair of socks and well-worn work boots, and plopped down on the couch to pull them on, waving at Castiel impatiently to sit. Castiel sat.

Castiel turned away, a tangle of emotion playing across his face as he crossed the kitchen to collect his keys and slip on his shoes again, bouncing lightly down his front steps to press the remote and duck under the garage door as it finished loudly clattering its way up the tracks and across the ceiling of his garage. His face was perfectly composed as he turned to ask if Dean needed anything, nodded and found him a large piece of cardboard in the recycling. He watched, rapt, as Dean slipped on safety goggles from inside his toolbox, collected a flashlight and a wrench and the new hose and slid halfway under Castiel’s Old lady.
“But, uh,” Dean broke the eye contact, his eyes falling helplessly to Castiel’s mouth, before hitting the floor. “Um, that doesn’t
Castiel leapt up and answered the door, no sooner pulling it open than a child was inside, bent under a heavy plastic garment bag twice his height, carefully not dragging any part of it on the ground.
"Hello, Dean."
Castiel grinned fondly as he slipped his phone back into his coat pocket, strolled back to produce for lettuce and tomatoes to carefully place next to the apples in his cart. He collected ground beef and taco seasoning and cheese and sour cream and a couple kinds of good beer. Loathe to limit his guests’ options, he added both soft flour wraps and the crispy kind of corn chips so the guys could have their preference.
“That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
Castiel’s breath blew out in a long, body-wracking shudder, staring at the people fucking on the screen. When he tore his eyes away to look at Dean they were glazed, from lust or pain or both, Dean couldn’t tell.
Dean squared his shoulders and stepped across the distance between them, close enough that he could feel their towels touch, his body responding with a flush of embarrassing heat, as Castiel lifted his eyes to meet Dean’s
“No, it
“Cas, how many times have you saved my life? Come on. I’m not taking no for an answer.”
Castiel wasn’t following suit, his breath rasping over his tongue as he stared, and Dean lifted his glance to check on him, accidentally breaking his first cardinal rule as his eyes locked with Castiel’s wide-eyed, almost frantic stare, the
Dean didn’t feel like bolting this time, somehow. He slowly shuddered to a stop, reluctantly breaking the kiss to stare down at Castiel’s face. Castiel felt him, his eyes slowly fluttering open, wide with wonder, a slight blue glow still fading from his irises. His scent was just as intoxicating as before but now there was a hint of crisp fall leaves in it, and Dean tried really hard not to be obvious as he sucked in a deep breath and held it for a moment, trying to memorize the way Cas looked right now.
smile curving Dean’s lips.
It had hurt so much when Dean had reluctantly let go, cleaned them up, kissed him goodbye. “Just stay here,” he’d whispered. “I’ll tell Sam you fell asleep so you don’t have to come downstairs with your face on fire.” Castiel had flushed crimson anyway at the thought and Dean had laughed for joy, caressed his burning cheeks. Castiel had smiled, his heart breaking, as Dean leaned down to kiss him softly one last time and then slipped out the door.
“Yeah no, go ahead,” Dean assured him, “I absolutely did say no wait on the pie after dinner.”
Dean ducked between two hanging orchids and accidentally brushed against one of them, setting it slightly swinging. He reached up to try to steady her just as the proprietor appeared, grizzled and scowling, to scold, “Don’t touch her!”
Cas puts two fingers to Dean’s forehead and a second later, they are standing in the bathroom, dry and dressed. Cas opens the door and silently steps past Sam who is standing frozen on the spot with his mouth open. Dean follows the angel out with a cocky smile, stopping to slap Sam on the shoulder, before heading out to the car. “Where is this diner, Sammy? It better be awesome, because I am starving.”
The pang in his chest he felt at wanting someone to share the world with was coupled with the distraction of Cas’s reaction to his bacon cheeseburger. “These make me very happy,” he’d mumbled after his first bite. No one should look that adorable while eating a cheeseburger. Of course the frankly pornographic noises he made while he enjoyed his meal went straight to Dean’s dick. He had heard those same noises months ago when Cas’ mouth was on him. Apparently Cas always made the same rumbling moan when he was really passionate about something.
“First of all, Cassie, please stop with the air quotes. I’ve told you, for what seems like a million times, it's unnecessary. Not to mention weird,” Anna spat. “Second, I asked you to come with me because you need a night out. You're at that bookstore all day with no one to talk to except Gabriel. After you're done you go home, eat dinner alone, and read until you fall asleep. It’s about time you change it up a little.” “Also,” she added after a beat, “that was a very sexist remark about the pole studio being a girl’s night out activity. So, please, for just one night, relax a bit and have fun.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just wanted to go down and find some coffee and breakfast. Didn’t want to wake you.” Dean stood and grabbed his phone and a room key off the desk. He still wouldn’t look at Cas.
That’s when Castiel noticed that Lisa’s injuries had healed. She wasn’t wearing the sling over her arm like she had been when she stopped by the studio a few times to chat with Pam. Her accident was months ago, so she would probably be released to start training again soon. And that’s when it hit Cas like a punch to the gut. Once she could practice again, Dean wouldn’t need him anymore.
“Yeah she does that,” he huffed. “How do you think I ended up doing physical therapy at a pole dance studio,” Dean asked, waving his hands around the dance space.
From the front of the studio, Pam and Charlie stood at the desk, closing out the day’s schedule.
Dean looked into those blue eyes, knowing that whatever the judges thought of their performance, he was still leaving here with the best prize of all.
Dean straddled him and dribbled lube over his swollen cock, coating it liberally with a few firm strokes. Castiel groaned at the contact and pulled against the tie holding him to the bed. After assuring he was well prepped with a couple of slick fingers, he finally fit the head of Cas’s cock against his hole and began to lower himself. Barely a minute later, he was fully seated with Cas’s cock filling him perfectly. He remained still for a moment, letting himself acclimate to the stretch.
Knowing they were about to fall over the edge of what promised to be a very powerful orgasm, Dean managed to feel around and find the remote attached to the plug still nestled deep inside Cas. “Get ready baby,” Dean warned. With one last evil grin, he pushed the button to trigger the strongest vibration setting.
Bobby would probably give him shit tomorrow for offering free work, but he didn’t care. Not when Castiel stared at the card between his fingers before looking back up at Dean with a big gummy smile.
“Hi, Castiel!”
Cas continued, stepping out of his shoes and turning around to bend down and peel off his socks. Cas casually stood up again, still with his back to Dean and pulled his belt loose from his pants, letting it drop next to his crumpled shirt. Next, the only sound in the room was the recognizable clink of a zipper. Castiel seemed to be good at this strip tease game. “Cas. Have you been watching more, uh…research?”
As Dean’s consciousness slipped to that place between sleep and awake, he could feel the warm, plush softness enveloping them, holding them together. Dean felt safer than he ever had before, wrapped in the wings of his angel.
“Right here?” Dean pushed at the muscle with his thumb, causing Castiel to moan and drop his head to one side.
“There’s five months until the regional competition in Dallas. I know I’m new at this, but I’m willing to commit as much time as we need to practice. My brother is willing to cover the bookstore in the evenings so we can rehearse. If you and Pam will teach me and help me, we can at least say we tried.”
“Shh,” Dean answered softly, holding Cas in place and circling the tip of the toy over Cas’s hole. “How does that feel?”
He did it. His chest still heaving to catch his breath, he took a quick bow in the center of the stage and nodded to the judges table in front of him. He wouldn’t know the results for a few hours, but he knew he had nailed his routine.  He felt like a million bucks listening to the crowd cheer for him, easily piecing out the voices of his family.
As he pulls into the motel parking lot, his smile fades. “What do we do now? I mean, I don’t know what to tell Sammy,” he pauses, pulling the car to a stop in front of the room he’s sharing with his brother. The light is still on. Sam must be waiting up for him, likely researching their next case on his laptop. “Honestly I really don’t want to tell Sammy about this yet. I will,” he adds.  “Just not yet. I gotta figure out what to say first, okay?” Cas nods and answers, “I understand Dean. I won’t say anything to Sam until you’re ready. That being said, I probably shouldn’t come in with you right now. He might start asking questions about why I showed up in the first place.” Dean’s eyes drop to where their hands are still clasped together on the seat. He hadn’t planned on saying goodbye to his angel already. “Yeah. You’re probably right, Cas. Better this way,” Dean says with a pout. Cas brings his hand up to Dean, using two fingers to tilt his chin back up a bit. “Don’t worry Dean. I’ll see you soon,” Cas promises with a grin. “Oh and Dean? I love you too.” He leans over and places a soft kiss on Dean’s lips. Cas is already gone when Dean opens his eyes. Sitting alone in the car, Dean inhales deeply and smiles at the empty passenger seat before getting out and heading into the motel room. He wonders exactly what his angel meant by “soon”.
“Just pretty cool? Dude, you looked kinda hypnotized for a bit there. I’d hate to see your face when you really like something then,” Charlie said suggestively, tilting her head even more towards Dean’s direction.
Next to him, his giant of a brother dropped onto his butt with a thunk. Nudging his arm in silent greeting, Sam squinted toward the water, smiling at the antics of his wife and their friends.
“I’m not quite a hundred percent yet, but I’m starting back slow with training. Maybe I’ll be able to come with you guys for next year’s regionals.”
“Good. We got this.”
He was almost out the door this morning, throwing some leftovers in abag and filling his thermos with black coffee when he got a panicked text from Ben asking him to come over and drive his mom to the emergency room. Lisa had slipped in the shower and unable to catch herself correctly, landed hard on the side of the tub.
“I’ve had to watch you strut around here, swinging around on a goddamned stripper pole, nearly naked and completely perfect. It’s been torture,” he rumbled, before finally sweeping his hot flat tongue up Dean’s length from root to tip like he was licking an ice cream cone.
He walked quickly over to the corner housing the sound system and cut off the music just as the next song was beginning. “Is everything okay with Anna’s car? I saw her this afternoon when she came to pick it up. I thought maybe you’d be dropping her off to get it, but I guess n- um..,” Dean paused in his rambling. “What can I do for ya?” He asked.
He opened his messages to Cas and sent a desperate plea.
“Well, then I’m gonna need you to pedal faster Cas,” Dean urged desperately.
Dean knew Cas was still joking at his expense, but that didn’t stop the traitorous blush he could feel spreading over his cheeks. He ducked his head, rubbing the back of his neck.
It had been a long time since Dean had called in sick. Years, in fact. Yes, he felt guilty for leaving Bobby short for the day, even though he knew they didn’t have a lot on the books. But damn it he’d surely earned one day to play hooky. Bobby agreed and told him to get back to bed and enjoy his time off, and that he wanted to hear details about the weekend in Dallas when he got in the next day. Dean only grunted his thanks and rolled back over, pulling the sheets up over his head to block out the unwelcome light.
“A few minutes, actually,” Charlie replied, not looking up from her phone. “It’s okay. You seemed…distracted,” she added with a smirk. “Is it cool if I sit with you for the show? It's just about to start.”
Charlie sighed and answered, “Because they’re both stubborn and afraid of what could go wrong that they don’t see what’s right in front of their faces.”
Dean’s only response was to spread his legs to allow Cas to get even closer and to raise his hand in the three finger Scout salute. Seconds later, he lowered his index and ring finger until he was left giving Castiel the middle finger and a shit eating grin. Before he could lower his hand however, Cas grabbed his wrist. Without breaking eye contact, he ducked his head and took Dean’s middle finger into his mouth and sucked hard, slowly releasing him until his teeth grazed over the tip.
“Dean! Dean, wait,” Cas begged, out of breath, twisting his head away from Dean. “Do I still need to tell you when I’m about to come? Because I am. If you keep moving like that, I’m not going to be able to hold on for much longer,” he explained.
Castiel looked at her confused. “Did I, though?”
“Are you sure Cas? Your spot’s still open in the front seat,” Dean said with a frown.
“Dean, what are you doing here?”
“It’s good to see you happy, man,” Sam said, still not looking at him. “You deserve it. I’m proud of you. We all are. No matter what happens tomorrow, we'll still be proud.”
“Guess that’s a yes. Come on, they’re in the lobby,” Cas continued with a laugh.
“You have no idea how hot you are right now. So many things I want to do to you, Cas. All at once.” Dean paused to take another sip and bring more ice into his mouth.  He set the glass down and gripped the hem of his t-shirt to bring it up over his head in a single motion. “I want to take you apart.” He unbuttoned his jeans and slowly brought the zipper down. “Let's see if I can make you squirm. Beg.” Cas actually whimpered, pulled at his restraints and dug his feet into the mattress, his hips rocking gently against the sheets. Dean stepped out of his jeans, leaving him in only his black boxer briefs. “I want to make you melt.”
“I love you.”
“Anna, of course we can stay for a while. Take all the time you need. If I get really bored, I can just head next door for a cup of coffee and wait for you there,” Castiel offered.
“You’re doing so good angel.”
“What!?” Sam squawked from the back. “You never let me choose what we listen to,” he said, pouting.
“Okay, Cas. We don’t exactly need to know how to waltz here or anything but it’ll help later when we’re figuring out our choreography,” he said, going back to the stereo to change the song to something slower, easier to follow. “Um, come here.”
“It's so great to see so many friends here tonight to support our student dancers. Everyone has been working their asses off to get ready for tonight, so please, show them plenty of love. Our student showcase will start with our beginner level one class and continue on with our more advanced classes. As always, the showcase marks the end of an eight-week class series, allowing our students the opportunity to show off their new skills before they move forward on to the next level if they choose. Which means that a new level one class will be starting next week. So, if any of you like what you see tonight and want to give it a go, please see Charlie later tonight with any questions and to grab yourself a spot in class. But, first, please give a round of applause and welcome our Level One class.”
Castiel looked up at Dean but didn’t say a word. They had barely spoken since that morning. Whatever words they shared had been short and concise. Dean didn’t look at him. Focusing on the ground, Dean spoke quietly.
He was saved by the dramatic swoosh of the curtain. Pam stepped out to greet them with a smirk, decked out in her signature black yoga pants and cropped Motley Crue t-shirt.
“What does that mean? And I’m assuming you’re Gabriel?” Dean asked.
Somewhere in Castiel’s brain, he knew he should still be paying attention to Charlie. He felt rude for losing focus on their conversation. On the other hand, who could blame him? The small audience was cheering on and clapping for The Man With the Beautiful Smile...Dean...who walked to the center of the dance area, followed by a beautiful woman with long dark hair and olive skin. She wore a strappy red sports top, tiny black hip-huggers, and tall red platform heels. Without a doubt, she was stunning. But that wasn’t what held Castiel’s eye. Dean had removed his plain white t-shirt, leaving only well-worn jeans that were frayed at the hem and hung perfectly over his hips. His chest and back appeared well-toned but he retained a bit of softness in his belly.
Dean chuckled. “You’re so polite, Cas. Let’s see what we can do about that.”
“Um,” he stuttered. “I-I’m not sure. I do own a bookstore on south Lamar. Angel’s Books? I don’t really go anywhere else, so that kind of has to be it,” he offered with a quiet self-deprecating laugh.
“Good. Now then,” Dean said with a predatory grin as he straddled Cas’s hips and leaned forward. He brought Cas’s cuffed hands up over his head and used the tie to secure him to the heavy wooden bed. Dean lowered himself to place a soft quick kiss on Castiel’s parted lips.
Dean walked over to his night stand, opened the top drawer and pulled out the handcuffs, letting them dangle from his fingertips. “You mean these,? You’re sure about this Cas,” he asked with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.
“Chuck Shurley, the writer? He’s written novels, and all he has to say is “not bad’?”
As soon as the last of the ice cube melted inside his mouth, he grazed over Castiel’s fluttering hole with the cold tip of his tongue. Castiel immediately bucked against it, crying out in a combination of Dean’s name, a few swears, and several words in Enochian Dean didn’t recognize.
“Castiel,” he reminded him, his smile dropping a bit, probably assuming Dean had forgotten. He hadn’t.
“You do karate?” Dean asked curiously.
me Cas.”
“Gabriel, believe it or not, I don’t have to explain every detail of my life to you. I said I’ve had a good morning. If and when you need to know anything else, you will,” Castiel argued, backing away and hoping Gabriel wouldn’t comment on the blush in Castiel’s cheeks.
“What are you talking about? What shit about his ex? And how do you know all this?”
Castiel simply sat there with his head supported by his hands giving him all of his attention.
“I know it’s too late now, but I don’t think what happened was a good idea Cas. I feel like I took advantage of you. Again. You’re already doing all of this to help me, and I keep complicating it. Last night was a mistake.”
“That being said, I think it’s for the best that we not let it happen again,” Cas said with a sadness in his deep voice. “It seems to only keep complicating things between us. And we’ve both worked too hard for anything to distract us now. We only have two months until Nationals now, so I think we should just put this behind us and just focus on what’s important. The competition.”
Castiel remained quiet, but took a deep breath and closed his eyes. After counting to ten, he looked up at his brother. “And would it be so bad if I did?”
The lower he got, the more Castiel squirmed under him and the more erratic his breathing became.
Cas turned to face Dean and continued to peel his dress pants down over his hips, past his muscular thighs and finally stepped out of them. He stood still before tilting his head and asked with a shy smile, “Do you like them Dean?”
“Wha- how? I- he-“ Dean stumbled and then pouted as Charlie just laughed at him. She shooed him towards the door and Dean took the dignity he had left and walked away, cheeks flaming and mumbling under his breath about tricky redhead masterminds.
“Well, I’m glad one of us does,” Dean said. “You wanna come in for a little bit and hang out?”
Castiel had a feeling this was some kind of challenge.
“Good. You should stop being so nice to me Cas. You’re gonna make me like you too much. It’d be easy to fall for a guy like you,” Dean whispered.
Dean looked up when he felt Cas nudge the side of his leg with his bare foot. Cas stood over him, looking down with a smirk.
Castiel just grinned at him. “Okay, Dean. Talk to me.”
“Let it go, Gabriel.” Castiel said with a snarl, walking back to the front desk.
Dean opened his mouth but couldn’t find any words. Castiel didn’t want him. Even though what he was saying was reasonable, logical even, the sting of rejection hurt nonetheless. And now he felt like a fool.
“Yeah, sure,” Castiel said, casting a glance at Dean, who looked almost...disappointed?
“Um, you’re welcome,” Castiel uttered.
Castiel landed on his back next to Dean and let his breathing settle down. Next to him, Dean, still down towards the edge of the mattress, turned his head so that his face brushed against Cas’ rib cage, inhaling deeply and leaving quick kisses over Cas’ skin
The car was silent, save for the noise Cas made buckling his seat belt. When he looked up, Dean was looking back at him with a soft smile and pink cheeks.
The fucker not only swallowed again, but he did it over and over again, milking Dean’s cock until the dam burst and Dean was spilling down his throat. He tried pulling Cas off as soon as it started, but Castiel gripped his hips and kept his mouth sealed over Dean's cock, swallowing everything. His vision whited out and his entire body seized up. He could feel fireworks in his toes, and he thought for a quick second, this might be the thing that finally kills him. But what a way to go.
The shadows.
Castiel stood against the opposite wall, looking down at his phone. He peered up at Dean with a shy smile. He didn’t seem to be panicking as much as Dean was. Or maybe he was good at hiding it. They stood facing each other in a heavy silence.
“I must warn you, he doesn’t seem to be much of a morning person.” Balthazar pushed the call button for the elevator, which opened for him almost immediately.  “Although he was quite good company last night. Quite an interesting one, that Mr. Novak,” he said with a smirk. “Good luck today, Dean,” he added, stepping onto the elevator.
“Just for you, Grumpy,” Pam answered with a wink.
“Charlie, believe me, I’ve already gone over this in my head a hundred times in the last twenty-four hours. I know it was stupid. The guy is already helping me for no reason other than he’s just a good human being who took pity on me. I know we were supposed to keep it professional. That’s what we agreed on the last time; dance partners and nothing else. And I went and screwed it all up by getting drunk and taking advantage of the situation. Sex always complicates things, and now I’m sure he’s regretting signing up for this whole thing to begin with.”
“Come on Cas. Don’t make it weird. Just dance with me,” Dean said softly, his green eyes sparkling.
“Barely,” Cas answered after a ragged breath. “I’m doing what I can to keep myself from getting too overwhelmed and coming too soon, as you requested. But it’s not without difficulty.”
Castiel dared himself to look back up at Dean. For a whole minute, neither of them moved, eyes fixed on each other as if they were trying to finish the conversation without words. Dean swiped his tongue along his bottom lip, shifted on his feet, and stood up straighter. He cleared his throat and crossed his arms . “Give me twenty-four hours to think about it? I’m not saying no. I just need a day.”
“After Dean finally woke up, of course he blamed himself for the whole thing. He thinks his life is cursed or something. Every time he gets close to having something good, it gets taken away. We lost our mom when we were kids. Dean had to take care of me after that since Dad kinda checked out. So he never got to be a kid. He’s used to losing things he cares about. So, I’m begging you, Castiel. Don’t be something else he has to lose.”
Dean handed over a ten and stuffed the change into the tip jar, then went to stare out of the large front window while Alfie made his drinks. It wasn’t late by any standard, but January meant long nights; it felt like the sun barely made an appearance today. Maybe Mother Nature was sympathetic; she knew better than to offer a beautiful sunny day while he sat in the emergency room with Lisa. Dean could feel himself being pulled down into his misery again when-
“Well, that’s too bad. But as amusing as that is to imagine, I’m sure you’ll be just as lovely escorting Ms. Bradbury down the aisle.”
He wasn’t sure who moved first. He frankly couldn’t care when a minute later Cas’ tongue was teasing his own. Cas cupped his jaw and gently urged him until he was on his back and Cas was pressing him into the mattress. Dean spread his legs to let Cas settle against his body, fitting together so naturally like they’d done this a thousand times already. Dean ran his hands over Cas’ strong back down to grip his ass and pull in him closer, resulting in a delicious grind. Dean happily swallowed the noises coming from Cas, only breaking their kiss to come up for air.
“And I was informing him that we already had plans for the rest of the afternoon,” Cas interjected with a nod towards Dean.
“Really?” Dean asked tentatively.
“You are?” Cas said, just above a whisper.
“Ladies, could I please talk to Cas alone for a minute?”
Dean felt himself warm under the praise. “Thanks, man.”
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean before reluctantly looked up at his sister.
“Yeah. Okay. Agreed. It happened. We’re all good. Won’t happen again,” Dean offered.
“Are you kidding? Everyone knows how to dance!”
“Oh! Alright Cassie!" Gabriel whooped. Then, he paused and tilted his head to the side in confusion. "So then what’s wrong if it was so life altering?”
tempting enough to override his self imposed no-dating rule.
“Okay. Then, let’s say,
“Why would he blame himself if it isn’t his fault?”
Half an hour later, Castiel stood near the exit, waiting for Anna to finish up her conversation with Pamela. Most of the crowd left soon after Dean’s solo and Pamela’s closing comments of thanks and a reminder to check in with Charlie on the upcoming class schedule. Charlie herself was at the front desk, signing up a few people. Castiel had to admit, the showcase night was good for bringing in new students. There was a tiny space in the back of his mind that wondered if one of those new students should be him. It had been a long time since he started a new hobby of his own choosing. Studying aikido with his brothers had been his father's insistence since they were children and Castiel had long ago grown bored of it.
“If anyone cares about my opinion, I think it’s a good idea,” she declared with a hand on her hip. “A male duo team is pretty rare at these things, so you’ll stand out to the judges. As long as you’re both ready, willing, and able, I’m in to help. You can use the space to practice every night if you want. I’ll even give you a key to lock up when you’re done.”
“In fact, I’ve been thinking about it for a while now too. Getting my mouth on you,” Cas said in a low and ragged voice while his eyes travelled up and down Dean’s body. And with that, Cas brought his mouth down to Dean’s nipple, bit down lightly, before sucking hard.
Dean’s face relaxes again. There is a tenderness in his eyes as he responds. “Oh, we have managed to have some good times. As naïve as he is, Cas really has learned a lot about humanity, thanks to Sammy and me.” Dean smiles wide and laughs. “His face just lights up over the silliest things, like when he finds a bee hive or when he tasted his first cheeseburger. The joy he finds in little things like that reminds me that there is still some good in this world.” Pausing for a moment, he looks back down at the bar and adds quietly, “He is the good in this world.” Dean goes silent for a minute, staring into his whiskey glass. Dean laughs to himself and shakes his head as if he has just realized that he is going on and on about the fallen angel. Looking up at his new friend, he begins to stumble over his words, quick to neutralize his awkward behavior.  “Uh, anyway…what can I say? He is my best friend,” Dean offers, and swallows the rest of his liquor.
Dean also realized he was enjoying his time at the studio more than he usually did. He was sleeping well every night, falling into bed physically exhausted but feeling more and more satisfied with their progress. Even Bobby had mentioned how “chipper” he was at the shop.
As the minutes ticked by, the more he reminded himself what a selfish asshole he was being. Here he was, feeling sorry for himself when Lisa was the one who got hurt.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about Gabriel,” Castiel replied innocently. “Can’t I just be having a good morning?”
Wide eyed, Castiel lifted his head to stare at the gleaming solid piece while Dean reached around himself to twist and turn the plug in his ass, still slick with lube. “Dean. Wha-. I. Oh,” Castiel uttered.
Dean smiled and swirled the toy around Cas’ rim a few times, smearing the lube in its path. “Do you want more,” Dean asked, as he peppered Cas’s ass with feather light kisses.
“Ahhh, Dean!” Castiel shouted at the initial contact of the cold, wet silicone, squirming and pulling at the cuffs.
A few minutes later, they pulled up to the studio, which was part of an older brick building, nestled in between a vintage clothing store and a funky looking coffee shop called The Last Drop. Studying the windows of the coffee shop, he spotted signs boasting they were open until midnight. At least he had a place to escape to if necessary. Too bad he didn’t think to sneak his book into the pocket of his coat.
From where he stood, Cas could see Dean’s face fall.
Dean was the result.
Castiel wished he was brave enough to go for option two. To put everything on the line and tell Dean how he felt. What was the worst that could happen? Of course, he knew exactly what could happen. Dean could look at him with disdain and tell him he would never feel the same. Dean could tell him he’d complicated the situation beyond repair and ask him to leave and never set foot in Lazarus Rising again. Without another word, Castiel ducked his head and made his way back to the tiny office. He plopped down in his chair, rubbed his eyes, and tipped his head back to stare at the ceiling. The longer he sat there, he could feel with figments of an idea forming in his mind. A third option. One that mixed the first two.He could keep his head up and keep his mouth shut. For now. He knew it was too risky to do anything while they were still getting ready for Nationals. But this whole partnership started because he wanted to get out of his comfort zone and do something that scared him. So, he would wait. After the National competition was finally over, he would do it. He would ask Dean Winchester on a real, honest to God, date.
“Ugh, I love that part! The pining, the angst, the teenage drama! So good!” Charlie paused to put her hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “Dude. Did we just become best friends?”
Dean had been around Pam long enough now that he could tell when an idea was forming in her head.
He sat up and lifted himself until the head of Cas’s cock caught against his rim and immediately dropped down again, impaling himself and forcing a growl out of his angel. And then, they were off. Dean increased his speed, riding Cas fast and hard. He looked down through his lashes, admiring the thin sheen of sweat over Cas’s body. Feeling his orgasm creeping up on him, he gripped his cock in his hand, fucking up into his fist while squeezing Cas’s cock inside him.
“Well if that isn’t the sexiest fucking sight I’ve ever seen,” Dean said, his eyes dark with lust. “I will take care of that for you. I promise, Angel. But first, turn over” Dean ordered as he again grabbed the back of Cas’ knees and flipped him.
“Ah, fuck! Hold on, Dean, we gotta take a break,” he grumbled. “My back is killing me,” he said, hunched over and attempting to rub at a sore spot with the back of his hand while holding on to the pole for support. Without thinking, Dean immediately stepped up behind Cas and laid a gentle hand on his warm skin, about mid way down his back and to the right of his spine.
They were already four beads in at this point, and Cas had been so patient while Dean played and opened him up.
When Dean smiled at him, a wave of affection spread through Cas’ veins. “No, Cas, I’m pretty fucking fantastic. But I need you to move Angel.” To prove his point, Dean spread his legs even further apart and cupped Cas’ ass with both hands to pull him in even deeper. “I need you to
They said their goodbyes and made their way to the door. Anna was halfway to her car and Cas had just stepped out of the building when Dean stopped him.
Dean stared down at a spot in the sand and chewed on his lip. By the tone of Sam’s voice, he knew it wasn’t really a question.
“Maybe?” Teasingly, Cas looked over his shoulder with a kittenish smile and  lowered his black trousers to reveal soft dark blue lace panties hugging the curves of his ass.
It had been two weeks since that blissful morning in the shower. Two weeks of stolen kisses when Sam wasn’t looking. Two weeks of subtle touches, when Dean could brush his hand against Cas’ thigh when he rode shotgun. Two weeks that Dean had Cas in his bed every night. Two weeks that Dean had everything he had been denying himself for years.
“Well, you are in luck, my friend,” Dean said, already pulling a card out of his wallet. “Take this, call that number in the morning if she still won’t start, and we’ll come get it,” he continued, handing the business card to Castiel. “That’s my shop. Well, technically it’s Bobby Singer’s, hence the Singer Garage, but if you call in the morning and tell Bobby you’re a friend of mine, Anna will get a pretty good deal on whatever needs to be fixed. Or,” Dean swallowed loudly, “that’s my cell number at the bottom if you prefer to just text me instead and I’ll take care of it.”
“Um, I figured we were probably done with practice for tonight. I hope you don’t mind,” Cas said, looking down at his feet.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean growled against his ear. “Do you have any idea how bad I want you? Do you have any idea what you do to me? How many times I’ve laid in bed at night thinking about touching you like this? How many times I’ve come thinking about you?”
“Cassie! Oh my god, that was the funnest class ever! Pam is such a cool teacher, and I even landed a couple of tricks already! Good workout too. I know I’ll be sore tomorrow, but it’s so worth it. You ready to go? Remember we have to go get my car in the morning.”
). Dean and Lisa’s movements told a story as they orbited around each other on the floor and then as they spun together on a shared pole. It was clear that Lisa was meant to be the main focus, with Dean helping to show off his partner. Their training was apparent; they worked together beautifully.
When they stepped back from each other, Cas turned to acknowledge the man again.
“Hold still, angel.”
Dean closed his eyes and brought up a hand to rub at his temple in frustration. Not looking up, Dean opened his mouth.
Cas took a deep breath to settle himself. “Okay Dean.”
They finally looked away from each other when the officiant spoke. While Charlie recited her vows, Castiel glanced at Dean when he reached up to wipe away a rogue tear from his cheek and lay his hand back in his lap. He felt a little guilty, but he ended up paying more attention to watching Dean than to the actual ceremony in front of him.
Dean rose from his seat to walk them out, wanting to prolong his time with Castiel as much as he could.
Castiel nods and walks toward the door, waiting for Dean, who turns and gives the bar tender a big toothy smile and waves good night. “You stay safe out there, and thanks again for the drink and chat. Guess I needed that,” Dean adds as he starts for the door.
Charlie and Dorothy’s wedding was being held at a venue called Camp Lucy. It was a sprawling property nestled in the Texas Hill Country just west of Austin. The ceremony and dinner reception were being held outdoors under a canopy of oak trees that sparkled with a thousand lights. The aisle was lined with two foot tall weathered stone pillars. At the entrance, there was an easel holding a white linen scroll bordered by silver lightsabers. In bold letters the scroll read “We are all equal. Sit or sit not, there are no sides in this family.” Cas followed Sam and Jess down to the second row and took their seats, giggling when he saw the first chair was reserved for D.W., Leader of the Rebel Alliance. Of course Charlie would have a Star Wars wedding.
“Oh, uh, yeah. Sure, that's totally reasonable,” Cas said, shaking his head. “Um, just give me a call or whatever when you decide.”
He had planned to go home and wallow in his misery alone. It seemed the Impala had different plans and steered him here instead. Pam’s regular class was almost done for the day. Once empty, he could have the floor to himself. If he could just spend an hour on the pole with some loud music, he might feel better. At least, he might have a better shot of sleeping tonight if he was completely exhausted, mentally, and physically.
“Thanks. You too,” he replied.
“Cas,” Dean whispered. He ran his hands over Cas’s back and held his hips still. “It’s time for you to roll over, angel. Straighten your legs back down for me.”
“Of course,” Cas whispered. “I’d rather be over here anyway.”
“Fuck, Cas, you’re killing me here,” Dean whined. “There’s lube in my bag. In the side pocket where the condoms are. I’m gonna need us to move things along if you’re gonna keep talking like that, or else I’m gonna come in my pants,” he added with a hint of desperation.
“Ahh, fuck Cas! You’re killing me, sweetheart. I'm already kind of on the edge here and I’m gonna come right here right now if you keep that up,” Dean warned, squeezing his eyes shut, trying with everything he had to keep his body under his control.
“Well, whatever. Swayze always gets a pass. Now, move your feet asshole.
“Uh-huh,” Castiel said, rolling his eyes and turning his head back toward the window.
Dean could only hold on as Cas set a quick but hypnotizing rhythm. Their position meant Cas’ cock hit Dean’s prostate perfectly with each thrust.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about Sammy.”
“Well, I was thinking about finding out exactly what your cock tastes like.”
“You’re welcome. Anytime. And Dean? I hope you get everything you want. You sure as hell deserve it.”
“I’m sorry, dude. I don't mean to laugh. Really. That had to be hard growing up with a name like Lucifer,” Dean offered once he calmed down a bit.
It was the truth. He loved Cas. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly when it happened. More like it was such a gradual, organic thing that sprouted and grew and lived inside him now.
“Awesome, I’ll definitely take you up on that offer,” Dean smiles at her and takes the last pull off his beer bottle.  For the first time today, he lets his body relax a bit, still tense from the hunt.  “Whiskey, neat. And yeah, angels are real too.” “Very real,” Dean adds as he rolls his eyes subtly, almost undetectable if you weren’t paying attention.
“Well boys? Let’s get started, shall we?”
“Dean. You have these amazing plans for your future. You know what you want and you’re so close to making it happen. And if winning this can help you get closer to that, then I’d like to help. Plus, I just…,” Cas stopped mid-sentence, searching Dean’s eyes for any signs of judgment. He looked down at the floor and spoke again. “The thing is, I don’t have plans for the future. I used to. Or at least I think I did. But for a really long time now, all of my days are exactly the same. I’m just going through the motions, but not really living, you know? I just...I need something life-affirming. So, I’m doing this for me as much as I’m doing it for you.”
Before Castiel could follow her, Charlie stopped him.
Castiel let that sink in before, once again, letting himself be pulled in by Dean’s enchantment.
Cas slowly slides down Dean’s slick body to his knees. All Dean can do is stare as Cas takes a hold of his cock and licks from the base to the head. Cas’ tongue gives special attention to the sensitive tip before taking Dean’s full length in his mouth in one swift movement, hitting the back of his throat. “Ffffuck!” Dean gasps. “You don’t have a gag reflex do you?” Dean grasps the top of Cas’ head with both hands to keep him in place as Dean gives a few experimental thrusts, fucking himself deeper down Cas’ throat. Cas swallows around Dean and bobs his head before pulling off and asks, “Can I try something else, Dean?” Working to control his breathing, Dean pants, “Fuck, I’m yours Cas.” Cas reaches a hand up to Dean’s mouth, two fingers extended. “Suck,” he commands as he turns his attention back to Dean’s cock, mouth closing around the tip. Dean only hesitates long enough to comprehend what Cas is asking. He opens his mouth for Cas’ fingers and sucks, mirroring Cas’ rhythm on his dick. Cas pulls his fingers away from Dean and nudges at his thigh, causing Dean to space his legs further apart. Cas reaches between Dean’s thighs to tease the rim of Dean’s ass. In one unified movement, he pushes one finger past the rim and takes Dean’s full cock into his mouth again. The feeling of Cas’ mouth around him and Cas’ finger inside him are almost too much and Dean has to concentrate on staying upright. “More, Cas. Please, more,” Dean begs. Without pausing, Cas adds the second finger and continues to work Dean open. Cas sets a rhythmic pace, his mouth bobbing up and down on Dean’s cock, his fingers pushing farther inside Dean to brush past his prostate. “Oh fuck, Cas, do that again!” Cas hums and curls his fingers slightly to hit the same sensitive spot. “Oh fuck, baby, I’m gonna come,” he mumbles. Cas hums again and swallows him down further hitting the back of his throat. Dean explodes, coming hard down Cas’ throat. For an angel who doesn’t need to eat, Cas continues to swallow, milking Dean with everything he has, like a man starved. Cas fianlly lets go, his mouth making a wet popping sound Dean has only ever heard in porn. When the room stops spinning, Dean makes a mental note to ask Cas exactly which website he spent all night “researching”.
For the next three hours, the flat landscape soared past them as they cruised down I-35. Castiel watched it go by, replaying the events of the weekend in his mind. He didn’t say much and he was grateful that Charlie had picked up on his need for space, only glancing back at him a few times from the rear view mirror with a barely there sympathetic smile.
With Cas it was something else entirely. If you would ask Dean, he would answer that it felt like he was a completely different person. Cas was a year above him and was a straight-A student in his classes. He was beloved by the teachers and the girls. The boys in his class were not enthusiastic. Similar to Dean, the students assumed that Cas was involved with Meg, but this was not true here either. Meg was Cas's best friend and unlike Lisa, she knew what Cas was really like. She assured Cas again and again 'Clarence, your secret is safe with me'.
Cas shook his head and walked towards Dean. "
Cas turned around and what he saw now almost made him faint. He hadn't even noticed that they had turned on, but he was surrounded by many candles, which, on closer inspection, were arranged in the shape of a heart. And in the middle of it all, there... there was Dean. He kneeled on one leg.
Dean took Cas in his arms and pressed him against himself. He was so happy, and Cas, the way he hugged him back, he was happy too. There was another click in the background, but they didn't let it bother them.
"So you're awake, then?" murmured Dean, right by Castiel's ear. Castiel's skin crawled.
Finally he felt him press and it was so much bigger than he thought. His breath hitched ans Cas stopped.
"Well, checkmate, Clarence!" the woman giggled, but Castiel didn't respond to her. He just looked at Dean, and Dean looked back. With attempt to put all the disgust and anger he felt into that look. Eventually, the last cell in Dean's body seemed to have realized what was happening and he retched.
Cas smiled. As he moved his mouth back down the path and stopped at the bend of Dean's neck, his right hand moved down Dean's body. Dean held his breath again, but now closed his eyes. Cas gently bit into a sensitive area on Dean's neck. Dean twitched once and opened his mouth slightly to breathe better.
Arriving in the washroom he had to realize that Cas was not there yet. He paced restlessly up and down between the sink and the door. He had to wait five long minutes, then the door opened. A boy came in, whom Dean recognized as one of Cas's year and Cas himself.
„That's why I want to ask-“, he paused, „Castiel, will you marry me?“
During the last verse, Dean had started the engine and was driving off. Lost in thought, he had just driven back on the road. If he had looked over his shoulder or in the mirror, he would have seen the truck approaching from behind. But this way...
"Stop it!" he said calmly but firmly. "This isn't making it better." Castiel tried to break free of the embrace, Dean only held him tighter. "The best thing is, you-"
"I was talking to Sam. About us. I explained everything to him and found out two years ago that Sam is friends with Gabriel. I sought Gabriel out and asked about you. He couldn't tell me anything, though, and I gave up hope of ever meeting you again." Dean's voice sounded sad.
"How long?" Dean's voice had gone quiet, but he was now looking at Castiel again for the first time. His body was tense.
The questions became more permissive and the tasks more 'interesting'. Gabriel's turn had just come and he had chosen Inias.
"Mmh."But Dean didn't seem to be interested in that, wandering his lips along Castiel's jaw and muttering a 'later' when he reached his chin. Castiel clasped Dean's hand, which was still stroking along the cuff of his shorts. He could feel himself starting to get hard again. He turned his head to Dean, mumbled an 'okay' and pulled Dean down to him.
In the middle of the third week of April came the argument.
"Is it true that you're still a virgin?" Gabriel grinned.
"Inias, if that doesn't make you happy though?"
When his big brother had stopped by last week, Castiel had been very baffled. He had believed all along that no one could find him.
A short break followed, then:
Five minutes later the ambulance came, but the paramedics couldn't do anything for Dean anymore.
"I-" he swallowed and shook his head as if he wanted to escape a different world. "Just don't stop, okay?"
Once in his room, Castiel gathered everything from himself and threw it into his suitcase. He didn't want to see anyone else, he didn't want any presents, he just wanted to go home.
"Since the first time we met, I've been wanting to get my mouth on this, Dean." He looked down again, using his tongue to put pressure on the underside of Dean's cock. Dean surpressed a shudder and reached for Cas's head again.
~ Why I chose the daisy?
And yes, he was sure that Sam's and Dean's disappearance was connected to a case, but they could have said something...
“Well, not in my experience. Any time something good comes around, something else manages to come right along and fuck it all up. It's been like that all my life, so you’ll have to excuse me for being wary about you suddenly coming into my life out of the blue and offering to help make my dreams come true or whatever.”
"What was that for?" Castiel turned slightly and looked out the window.
"Oh my mmph-", was all Dean could say, then Cas's mouth was on his. Cas's tongue asked to be let in, which Dean let out a soft groan. He buried his hands in Cas hair and pulled the older boy towards him.
They got out and Dean took Cas' hand. He didn't let go of her when he led them both through some trees. All of a sudden, he stopped and turned Cas around. Cas looked at him in shock, but now he stood with his back to the place Dean had chosen for today.
Dean and Castiel were sitting in the Impala.
Everything was ready. Dinner was ready, the library cleaned up, the table was set, Sam and Jack were gone for two days and Castiel was waiting.
"There's still Apple Pie, Dean," Castiel said at one point.
Castiel had closed his suitcase after the conversation and had told Inias that he would now go to the motel at the end of town. If Inias should change his mind after all, Castiel would take him with him in the evening. There was room enough in his apartment. Inias had smiled and hugged Castiel again.
"I'm sorry, Dean! What can I do?"
That's where Dean came in. Dean wasn't his best friend, he was so much more.
Again, Dean turned towards Sam with the last sentence and Cas who was lying on a bed, giggled. This song and these looks - it was so much Dean.
He had always come when Dean had called for him. Of course Dean had done or risked something for him, but even after all these years it was always Sam who came first.
"Oh come on, that's long gone and forgotten." Castiel smiled, Inias raised his eyebrows. "You better tell me what that was about your reaction to Gabe's question!"
“Uh, yeah,” he answered, pulling himself up. They stood there, staring at each other. Of course when Cas had his dick in his mouth, he couldn’t shut up. Now, Dean had no idea what to say.
“Oh,” Dean said, suddenly switching gears. “Well, that’s awfully nice of you to wait on her. Did she have the car taken anywhere yet?”
He really was a dumbass. And an asshole. No wonder Cas couldn’t stand to ride in the same car with him last night. He wouldn’t have blamed Cas for blowing the entire competition. But he hadn’t. Even after all the hurtful shit Dean said, Cas still gave everything he had on that stage and got them the win. He was definitely a better person than Dean. The longer he sat, watching his coffee grow cold, the more convinced he became that Castiel was someone he always wanted by his side, in whatever capacity Cas would allow. Of course, that’s when that little nagging voice in his head whispered,
“Your parents didn’t help at all? How long have you been supporting him?”
The drive back to the motel is quiet, except for the sound of Led Zeppelin playing softly on Baby’s radio. When Dean looks over, Cas’ eyes are serene, looking out at the road ahead. Dean slowly moves his hand over to cover Castiel’s where it is resting on the seat between them. Cas looks quickly over to Dean and gives him a shy smile, as if caught off guard while having indecent thoughts about future possible endeavors. Dean bites his lower lip and smiles back, knowing his angel so well at this point he can almost read his mind. “We will do that again Cas. I promise. And hopefully more,” Dean offers.
Not another word was said between them. Dean propped himself up on his hands to watch Cas walk out of the hotel room, pulling the door shut behind him. Dean let himself collapse back onto the disheveled mattress as his mind processed what just happened. All of a sudden, it felt like a dam was about to break inside of him. Which felt silly and irrational. Castiel wasn’t even his, as much as he wanted him to be. And despite how much pain he had already survived in his life, he had the fleeting thought that Cas walking away from him forever might be the thing that overpowered him. He mustered up what energy he had left to roll over and bury himself in blankets, realizing too late that they still smelled like Cas. Resigning himself to his fate, he took in a deep breath, filling his lungs with the fresh earthy scent. He finally let his tears fall and waited for the darkness to take him.
Castiel knew he was blushing, and it had nothing to do with the Texas summer weather.
“Please tell me this means what I think it means,” Charlie asked with a quiet squeal.
Working for Bobby meant it wasn’t too hard to call and explain why he wouldn’t make it to the shop today. Bobby always said family came first. Even if they aren’t blood.
Dean struggled to take in a breath while watching Cas swirl his tongue around the head. Cas lifted his face to look up at Dean, leaving behind a little string of saliva on his cock.
“Of course I do!” Dean cautiously reached a hand out and swept his fingers over the soft feathers behind Castiel’s shoulder, causing the wings to puff out in response. “Don’t hide them around me anymore, okay?”
“You’re welcome, Dean, glad I could help. You boys have a good night.”
With a guttural scream, Castiel’s hips jackknifed off the mattress, nearly throwing Dean off him as his climax punched through his body. Feeling Cas coming inside him, Dean leaned back with his eyes shut tight, riding Cas as hard as he could while fucking his fist until he finally exploded, spilling over his hand onto Castiel’s chest.
“How does he look at me?”
“Oh,” Dean grunted. “Didn’t think you’d catch that,” he mumbled to himself.
Castiel recognized the song. He was pretty confident it was a part of the Fifty Shades soundtrack (
Castiel’s excitement made his blue eyes sparkle and Dean couldn’t look away. Not for the first time, he wished he could lean in and taste that smile. “Yeah. It’s pretty awesome,” he muttered, still staring at Cas’ mouth.
“Before we get into this weekend, back up a minute. What do you mean you agreed on this the last time? I thought this was the first time? What am I missing? How is it that neither of you mentioned a last time?” Charlie’s voice gradually increased in pitch until she had to stop and take a breath.
“Wait, what? It’s been six years?! But you...you’re
“Yes, Dean. I understand,” Cas replied after a deep breath. “Good boy,” Dean answered, turning the toy off again. He reached for the lube on the bed and let it drip over the toy. Holding the plug with one hand, he spread Cas apart with the other and lightly brushed the vibrator over Cas’ spit slicked rim.
Dean looked to his side and could see Cas swallowing hard before answering her, his voice low and rough. “Yes, I’m sure I could show him a few things.”
) ran his tongue over his bottom lip. It was probably only a few seconds, but it felt like time came to a halt. Castiel was afraid to move. He was sure if he did, Dean would disappear and the spell would be broken.
“Angel?” Dean replied, a bit too quickly.
Castiel smiled as he quickly sorted through the tapes in front of him before selecting Led Zeppelin IV and gently pushing it into the tape deck. He wasn’t sure if that had been a test or not, but Dean’s smile and approving nod made him feel like he got it right anyway.
Gabriel frowned at him. “Who said it was a mistake?”
Castiel swallowed hard and dropped his gaze back to Dean’s mouth. Emboldened by the alcohol running through his veins, he knocked back the whisky he’d been nursing. Keeping his voice low enough for only Dean to hear, he replied, “As much fun as I’m having here, I do think we should get to bed soon. Wouldn’t you agree?” Castiel hoped Dean picked up on the hint. Fortunately, he did. A minute later they excused themselves from the group, claiming they needed a full night’s rest for the next day.
“And Dean here is going to be my Man of Honor and give me away,” Charlie said, proudly, grinning towards him.
Dean’s life didn’t leave a lot of time for reading, but Dean knew he could get lost in here for days if he ever had the time.
“Oh, well I did as a child. Then when I was about sixteen, I started training in aikido. It’s similar to karate but different techniques in fighting styles,” Castiel answered him. “I haven’t really practiced in about two years though,” Castiel looked down at the floor, hoping no one would make him explain further. He was saved by his sister.
Castiel sat on the couch as instructed, warm and cozy in his flannel pajama pants and his favorite koala T-shirt, now soft and worn in from so much use. Their first Christmas as newlyweds was almost over. The three months since their wedding had been the happiest of his life. He smiled to himself remembering their morning and the way Dean’s face lit up in excitement when Castiel presented him their very own pole. Dean wasted no time, tearing the box open and pulling out all the pieces, before running off to the garage for the tools he needed to install it in the corner of their living room. It had been as much a gift for Castiel as it was for Dean, made even better when he got to watch Dean put it together all afternoon in nothing but faded jeans and a god damned tool belt. It was getting late and he thought they’d be heading to bed soon, but Dean was excitedly adamant that Castiel sit and wait for his last gift of the day. So he leaned back against their plush couch, enjoying the soft glow coming off the lights of the Christmas tree.
“Um…,’ Castiel paused, thinking of an appropriate answer. “It’s kind of awesome, honestly” he said with a grin, still staring ahead at the rows of shiny poles.
“Heya Dean! How’s it goin’ tonight? What can I get ya?”
Dean rolled off the bed and walked over to his dresser.  Out of the top drawer he removed a black silicone plug featuring five graduated beads. It was attached via cord to a small remote control device. “I was gonna wait to use this with you. But, I think tonight, with you like this, might be perfect.” Cas swallowed loudly and kept his eyes fixed on the toy as Dean returned to the bed. He knelt down onto the mattress between Cas’s feet and ran the nail of his index finger along Cas’s instep, up his calf and his inner thigh, causing Cas to shiver.
Cas stood over him, his face flushed and his mouth open panting as he worked Dean over. Then Cas brought one of Dean’s legs up to his mouth, and bit down on the inner side of his ankle. Dean screamed out at the sensation and Cas felt him tighten even more around his cock. He knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
“Hmm? What? Sorry, were you saying something?” Castiel looked to his left where Anna sat looking at him with wide, concerned eyes.
Castiel’s eyes went wide. Dean stepped up to him, inches from his face.
“If I could make a request?”
“Ummm,” he stammered again. “It was pretty cool. Not quite what I expected,” Castiel said, trying to sound casual.
Cas dropped to the floor with a thump and hung his head down. Dean followed him, splaying his legs on either side of Cas’ body to get closer to his back. He used both hands to knead at the tight muscle where Cas had indicated, before moving on to work at his shoulders and the knots under his shoulder blades. “Man, we’ve gotta make sure you stretch more. This isn’t good for you.”
Castiel said nothing to that, he just put his hand against Dean's and smiled. He rose as well, sat down and reached into the picnic basket. Hidden under a cloth, was the box of Apple Pie. Castiel opened it, put a piece on Dean's plate and his own, and set the box aside again. Then he handed Dean his plate and waited for the reaction.
"Then so be it. We're going to get married and we're going to have an even better life than we had before."
"Of course you can go, Dean. You look very battered. If you don't get better, please go to the nurse's office."
Contrary to what he was used to, he had not reacted to this message. He had looked at Jack and just told him that they had to go back immediately. Jack had packed up and they had left. Eventually they were on Highway 281 and they passed the same spot where Dean was killed. Sam just drove right past it and if Jack noticed something, he didn't say anything.
The brothers pushed and took a sip. Dean turned slightly in Cas direction, cheered him briefly and turned back.
When Castiel woke up for the third time this day, it was almost half past three and he was alone. He got up and went to the bathroom to take a shower. Afterwards, he got dressed and grabbed his suitcase. He looked around and noticed that Dean had 'cleaned up'. He smiled. Then he looked at his cell phone and saw that Inias had texted him. "
How much he liked his little apartment....
Castiel was stuffing the trash into bags, he had already put the dishes in the dishwasher. Dean went to the refrigerator, took out two bottles of beer and sat down at the table. One bottle he kept, the other he put down across from him. Castiel, who had been watching, looked at him. Dean silently indicated that he should join him at the table. Castiel did, and for a while they watched the drops of condensation on their bottles.
"You're just starting now?"
It was a starry, summer night, warm and clear. ...and the music playing softly in the background as they drove. Dean would tap the beat on the steering wheel while Cas watched the stars. „As if he knew every single star“, thought Dean and smiled as he watched the dreamy looking angel from the corner of his eyes.
"Mildred?"
Every time Jack could see Sam, headphones were on his head. Sam alone knew what kind of music was in them.But what Jack could say was that there was one song in this playlist that made him cry even more than the rest.
~ I searched for apartments in Lafayette, Louisiana and actually found one which I could use as inspiration. Name and location are real and if you want to take a look at it, here's the link:
„Well... For one, Swayze sings ‚she‘ all the time, so it doesn't really fit, and two, I think it's so much more personal.“ He smiled at Cas.
You never saw them together in school, at least not officially. But sometimes, when classes were unbearable, messages were sent. Then you could have seen them together in a washroom, an empty classroom, under a staircase or in Dean's car. Dean wisely did not park in the main parking lot, but nearby in a small side street.
"Um", Jack didn't quite know what to say, "this ain't Dean. I'm Jack Kline. Who are you?"
"I'm sorry!", whispered Dean. Cas squeezed him a little tighter. He didn't want to get into it now. He had mentioned to Dean once that he wished for a return of the time in Purgatory sometimes. A time when they could both be who they really were. Where they didn't need to stay in one of their rooms late at night, book rooms in motels, or make up cases just to spend time as a couple. Dean had been very distant after this conversation and had tried to explain to Cas that he wished for nothing more, but just didn't have the heart to do it.
After an hour, Dean came out of the bathroom showered but completely exhausted. The door to the bedroom was open, the windows were open, the bed was newly made and there was no sign of the woman. Dean walked towards the kitchen as noises were coming from there. He continued quietly and then stopped in the doorway.
"But? Cas what is it?" Cas didn't answer. He went to his suitcase and searched for something. Then he came back to the bed and sat before Dean. A little quieter than before he repeated his answer.
"I will never be enough, right?", he asked in a husky voice, but didn't expect an answer. He turned around and left.
He explained what had happened and she apologized for not hearing about it. Since she lived alone, those messages didn't reach her. It was also agreed that she would not go near the brothers for her own safety. But Eileen promised that she would leave immediately and the next afternoon she was there.
Dean also noticed changes. Castiel had gained a little weight, but really only a little. And it suited him well, he no longer looked as slim as before. Dark circles had formed under his eyes and he looked much older. The only thing that reminded Dean of the Castiel from before were those piercing blue eyes and the way Castiel tilted his head to the side when he was thinking. That's exactly what Castiel was doing right now, and Dean, who had often thought of that gesture, cleared his throat.
"I'll do it this way, y'know? It's me who's saying sorry." He wrapped his hand around Dean's erection and began to stroke him, matching his thrusts. Dean closed his eyes. "But I'll add this."
"Sir?" In the meantime the truck driver had arrived at the Impala.
I'm really sorry about the end of the last chapter, but I wanted to write the story like this ;)
"Okay." Castiel said no more. He remained silent.
„Why did you change the song?“
"Yeah, but how-?"
„Oh, Cas“, Dean sighed and pulled Cas back in.
Castiel captured Dean's lips once more and rolled his hips again. Still easy and slow. Dean put his arms around Castiel in a tight embrace. Yes, he had missed this. To be near a person but not only with the body.
"Dean. The main thing is you're here, the kids are here, and we stay healthy and happy. Everything else will come naturally As it has so far." He lowered his head and kissed Dean and this time the kiss was one that led more into an area that they shouldn't enter while they were in a public park with a lake where other people might pass.
Here everything looked neat and tidy again. Only on the table were a few things with post-its on them that Dean had written.
They listened to music and talked. Cas got up in between and changed the vinyl records. It was mostly the music that Dean liked listening to the most.
It wasn't just a kiss, they both knew it, it was coming home.
"No!"
He was waiting for Dean to come back. Where exactly he had gone, Cas didn't know. But he knew Dean would come back. All those years, it had always been this way.
"Dean Winchester?", she asked and nodded. It was a strange but not a bad feeling to not be reconized. "Unfortunatly we're very sorry but your room... There's something wrong. I don't wanna get into detail but you and your manager can't be in there tonight. We already changed the rooms and prepared your new ones. You only have to take your stuff out of your old room."
"I'll definitely come visit you, give me a few days first. I have to finish something here and then I can take some time off." He stopped for a moment, then said softly. "I want to be with you again." Castiel gave him a kiss on the head.
After one or two more slow thrusts and a squeezed fist, he came. He locked up, clamped down around Castiel's cock. He didn't make a sound he only pressed their lips together harder. A few seconds later, Castiel followed.
~ Liam's picture is made by me. I hope it looks like a four-year-old has drawn it.
Dean - the big brother, the loyal friend, the driving force of TFW (most of the time), the guy who saved many people. Dean, who also tried to never give up (which hadn't always worked).
The first were cards:
He had left Lawrence, his place of birth. He had left Dean, his friends and family behind, taking only his cat, Nawiri, with him. He had been without a permanent home for a while, but then had settled in Lafayette, Louisiana. He had quit all connection to home, had deleted all social media accounts, and since then also called himself Steve. He wanted to forget everything that had happened before, but even now, five years later, his broken heart had not healed.
“Remember, Cas. If you want to stop, just say it, and I’ll unlock them,’ Dean warned as he bent down to pick up Cas’s discarded tie on the floor.
He blew out a deep breath and ran his hands through his wild hair. Readying himself, he stepped back out into the main space. As expected, his brother was leaning back against the front desk, waiting to pounce.
new?"
Castiel frowned a bit in confusion. “Won’t you be working with Dean again by then?”
The petite brunette stands behind the bar, pouring Dean’s whiskey, and glances back up at her hero as she hands him the drink. Crossing her arms, she leans forward on her elbows and gives him her full attention.  At this point, Dean’s green eyes have become lost in thought, far away from the empty bar. Clearly the bar tender has stumbled upon a sensitive subject.
Dean lazily worked it out of his hole, revealing a solid plug made of clear glass swirled together with crystal blue. He held it up to better show off the color. “Your grace.”
Sam closed his laptop. “You heard anything from Cas since lunch? He said he was gonna go look for the ingredients we need for that spell. Kinda thought he’d be back by now,” he asked with a concerned look.
He and Gabriel happily accepted an invitation to the annual Winchester Fourth of July party, held on Bobby’s property on the northwest side of town. Meeting Bobby was like meeting a teddy bear wrapped in grizzly bear packaging and it was easy to see why Sam and Dean looked up to him the way they did. He’d only embarrassed himself once when he moaned obscenely as he bit into one of Dean’s famous cheeseburgers, only to look over and find Dean staring at him, fighting back a laugh.
Dean stares down at his drink, watching the way the light hits the glass. After a moment, his face changes and a sliver of a smile appears on his lips, clearly enjoying some private thought. “Yeah. There actually is a good one,” Dean confides warmly, his smile gradually increasing, causing the skin around his eyes to crinkle.
“Um, not exactly. I’m Anna Novak,” she said gesturing to herself while offering her hand. “I work for the Chronicle. I think you and I talked on the phone last week about me coming in to watch the show and get some info for the piece I’m working on.”
“Happy to help. And I’m glad you had a good class. I’ll give your review to Pam; I’m sure she’ll like to hear it.”
He knew he was rambling. Dean couldn’t believe he just gave the guy his number. He couldn’t remember the last time he wanted to give anyone his number.
“I’m gonna head down and find some food. I’ll see you in a bit and we can head over to the convention center and get checked in.”
Chapter Two
The man closed the back of the case and studied Dean for a moment with a neutral expression before his mouth pulled up into a lopsided grin.
That is until they were interrupted.
Suddenly needing to be kissed, he crawled up Cas’s naked body, stopping to place gentle kisses along his way. He hovered over Cas and lowered himself until they were finally skin to skin, save for his boxers. They traded sloppy kisses, sucking on tongues, and nibbling on bottom lips. Dean got so lost in it that soon they were rutting against each other, using the thin damp fabric between them for added friction.
“And you? What was Dean going to do with his winnings?” Cas took a sip from his mug and urged Dean to continue.
“Yeah. I hear ya,” he said nodding back at Gabriel.
Dean’s breath caught in his chest, his eyes wide as he took in Castiel’s face, warm, open, and without judgment.
“Good.” Dean reached up to run his palm over the bulge in Cas’ jeans. “I’d rather feel you. All of you,” Dean answered, his voice rougher than it was only a moment ago. He popped open the button and slowly lowered the zipper down, running his tongue over his bottom lip. He looked back up at Cas before reaching inside his boxers, pulling him out, and skimming his thumb over the head.
Despite his exhaustion, memories of that night flooded his mind before he could push them away, making his cock twitch in interest. He relaxed his head back to rinse the shampoo from his hair, enjoying the sensation of suds running over his heated skin. He took himself in hand, already half hard and filling up fast, and gave his cock a few strokes. It wasn’t the first time he’d gotten off thinking about Cas’ hands working him open, his tongue teasing his nipples, and his eyes blown open in desire as he sunk into Dean with a gentle confidence and slowly increased his intensity until Dean forgot his own name. Dean always had a few rotating fantasies he thought about when jerking off, but the rest of them had faded into the background since that night.
. You’re perfect,” Dean said, parroting his own words back to him.
“Castiel,” Dean repeated slowly, testing each syllable like he was swirling the word around in his mouth to get a taste for it. It made Castiel shiver. “Pretty unique name. How did you get that one but your sister’s just Anna?” Dean asked with a raised brow.
Gabriel’s face went neutral. He just studied Castiel for a minute before he finally spoke again.
“Thanks. I will,” Castiel answered, giving a shy wave goodbye before getting in his car and starting up the engine.
“Well. I guess we should go,” he said quietly, standing up from their little table in the corner.
Cas stood on the sidewalk, staring at the closed door, for a full minute before Anna’s car horn jolted him back to his senses.
A few minutes later, the door swung open and a gust of wind blew through the front room. Castiel walked in right on time, his dark hair a mess and bulky trench coat pulled open from the wind, making him look wild and disheveled. Dean quickly schooled his face so he wasn’t caught gawking at the guy. He couldn’t help but notice how nervous Cas looked, his movements stilted and jittery as he approached them at the front desk, slinging a duffle bag over his shoulder. He also noticed that Cas was still dressed in his work clothes. His crisp white shirt was still tucked neatly into fitted dress pants, which hugged his body just right, suggesting that Cas was all muscle underneath. The only thing out of place was the blue tie, already pulled loose from his neck and laying wrong side up. Dean ran his eyes down Cas’ body and immediately felt like a perv for imagining what he looked like without all those layers. Some part of his brain obviously wasn’t working because his fingers itched to reach up and fix Cas’ tie until it laid flat against his chest. Luckily, he kept his hands to himself.
“Wait, angels are real too? I mean, witches, vampires and werewolves, sure. I can believe that. Hell, I guess I have to now that I just saw you rip that vampire’s head off.  Thanks again, by the way. You saved my life tonight. Your drinks are on the house.”
The other man, Castiel noticed, was barefoot, and in a simple white t-shirt and jeans. Although the room was dim, it was clear that he had a strong jawline and broad shoulders that led to narrow hips and slightly bowed legs. He had shorter, dirty blonde hair and full lips. But what caught Castiel’s attention the most was his laugh. Whatever had been said caused his entire body to respond, sending his torso backward; his head was thrown back, eyes closed and ending with the most beautiful smile Castiel had ever seen.
“Cool,” Charlie said as she put her phone in her pocket and looked up. “You were zoning out pretty hard there with Pam and the guys a minute ago.” Charlie turned her head towards him and lowered her voice. “Just a heads up though, Pam is super hot, but she doesn’t really do the whole dating thing. She’s basically married to this place anyway.”
“I can’t believe you’re making me listen to this song again. In my car. After we got each other off in the back seat like teenagers,” Dean complained. Although, the fire behind that complaint was masked by the happy, satisfied sigh that followed it. Cas often compared him to a grumpy sleepy kitten and Dean couldn’t find himself to be mad about it.
“Well, you could always just strip down to your skivvies.” Dean couldn’t help his stupid mouth, but when Cas’ eyes shot up in shock, he just gave his most charming smile and hoped he hadn’t already scared the guy off. “Just kidding. Running shorts are fine for now,” he added.
“Dean. Good morning! Big day ahead, hmm? Were you coming to see Castiel?”
Castiel opened the driver’s side door, but turned toward Dean, beaming back at him.
At least he could always count on Charlie to put a smile on his face.
“Dean! You were perfect! I’m so proud of you,” Cas said before releasing him.
“Well not everything. Cas filled me in on what happened when I dropped him off last night. I didn’t ask for all the dirty details. But I know enough. And I wish I was here to celebrate my BFF finally breaking his vow of celibacy. But I’m not. I’m here because you are officially a dumbass. When you didn’t answer any of my messages, I called the shop and Bobby said you stayed home today, so I knew where to find you.”
He didn’t wait long before he heard the first notes of a familiar tune. It was the classic sultry rhythm of Santa Baby. Dean entered the room slowly, popping his hips to the music. Castiel’s eyes nearly fell out of his head and he couldn’t contain the giggle that escaped his mouth at the sight of his husband. Dean was barefoot and dressed in low slung red pants, a red velvet Santa jacket trimmed in white fur, tied with a red sash, and a classic Santa hat laying lop-sided on his head.
You'll find the link to the Spin playlist on Spotify at the end of the fic. I hope you like it.
“Okay, okay. Say we do this. We’d have to get you strong enough for the pole, teach you choreography, it’s gonna be a hell of a sprint, man,” Dean said shaking his head.
Dean had practiced in his head what he would say to Cas when he found him, but now the words escaped him. He was frozen looking back, his mouth hanging open and blinking rapidly like an idiot. He took a deep breath and hoped for the best.
Dean laughed at Gabriel’s big brother threat, but his smile quickly fell when Gabriel only looked back with not an ounce of humor in his eyes. Being a big brother himself, he knew Gabriel was serious. He was annoying and a little intrusive, but he clearly had his brother’s best interest in mind, and Dean couldn’t help but respect that.
“Of course that’s possible,” Sam replied, nodding his head. “There’s always a risk. But. On the other side of that coin is you getting everything you’ve ever wanted? And if I were a betting man, I’d take those odds.”
“Oh my god! How long have you been sitting here,” he asked laughingly, pleased to see his new friend again so soon.
“Cas. I….,” was all Dean could manage. His hungry eyes swept along every inch of Cas’ body on display in front of him. His breath caught in his throat when his green eyes met blue. As Dean continued to stare at his angel, his eyes softened and a soft smile spread across his lips. “I love them, Cas. They’re beautiful.” Dean took a deep breath to settle his pulse. Wow, Dean thought to himself. This relationship really was changing him.
They stood there, alone in the corner of the poetry section, refusing to look away. And dammit, Dean could feel it. That pull. That stupid itch that made him want to push Cas against the stack of books, tangle his hands in his hair and stick his tongue down the guy’s throat.
The hip huggers were tight and low across his belly, showing off the outline of Cas’ cock perfectly. The fabric was a stark contrast against Cas’ tan hips and Dean had to fight the urge to drop to his knees and run his tongue along the line where skin met  lace.
Of course, Gabriel followed him, casually leaning against one side of the desk. “One. My name’s not Elsa; it’s like you don’t even know me. And two, it kinda sounds like you did something new, and that not a Cassie thing to do.”  "Or maybe you did
“Oh, this is my brother, Castiel. I hope it's okay that I brought someone else,” Anna said worriedly.
Castiel stood in the middle of the room in his boxers as the door shut behind Dean, leaving him alone. He knew he was lying to Dean. And to himself. Of course things were complicated. And it wasn’t Dean’s fault. He’d been clear about not wanting any kind of a relationship with anyone. That didn’t keep memories of two years ago from flooding his mind. Ishim had called their entire relationship a mistake before he walked out. And they had been together for years. They were planning a wedding and a life. Hearing Dean repeat those words hurt just as much. That realization terrified him. This was why he had refused to get close to anyone in the last two years. He had successfully built up a wall to protect himself from getting hurt again and Dean had slowly started dismantling it. The problem was that Dean, it seemed, also hid behind his own protective stone wall. Castiel thought back to what Sam had told him the day before. Dean was always waiting for the shoe to drop, to lose the thing he cared about. He was scared.
“Okay, you win.”
“Dean,” he stuttered.
They went back to their own desserts and soon they were scraping the last crumbs off their plates. After setting them down on the side table Dean caught sight of a tiny bit of melted ice cream clinging to the corner of Cas’ mouth.
With his back to Cas, Dean’s head dropped with a loud sigh.
There were a few friendly whistles and catcalls coming from the couple he now knew were Dean’s family. Dean shook his head as he waited for the music to start, keeping his eyes cast downward, but smiling almost shyly at the attention.
Dean demonstrated, slowly sliding his hand up his cock again, gulping at how much better that felt than usual, trying to hide how turned on he was as some sort of point of pride, like if he could keep his cool this wouldn’t be weird.
“What did you DO?” Sam’s eyes flared in fear. “You assholes
“No black eye though!” observed Dean, “Did you try that move I showed you?”
Castiel still looked confused, so Sam chimed in. “Cas, this whole neighborhood is off-limits for anyone that doesn’t have Big Man’s permission to do business here. It’s complicated as hell to keep track of who is working what nights so José draws us a little cheat-sheet each week of who is doing food deliveries from their jobs when and we basically pay him allowance to keep us in the know.  I think his Mom or his brother helps but he won’t admit it and Felipe hasn’t demanded a cut, at least not that we know of.”
. Castiel fiddled the french doors open - there was definitely a problem with the latch - and they stepped out to pull their shoes on on his tiny deck, maybe five feet deep but the full width of the house, with a bannister along most of it except for where a set of stairs extended down to the ground at the leftmost edge, near the door to the house. The boys trailed Castiel down the stairs to the small fenced-in yard to gasp in delight as they took in what he had done.
Castiel raised both brows at that and answered calmly, “I have a number of skills Dean, most of which you remain completely ignorant of in terms of both scope and prowess...” Dean’s eyes flared wide as Castiel left the implication hanging in the air for a second, then he smiled wickedly and continued, “but if you need your ass handed to you, I assure you I am always prepared to deliver.”
and shut his eyes to compose himself, his recent train of thought fanning his earlier simmer to more of a dull roar. Castiel joined the conversation at his table, aware that Anna was watching him but ignoring her saucy grin; one problem at a time. They were having a lively argument about Counter-Strike and for once Castiel could add to the discussion, making several valid points and offering a couple tips and getting some surprised and impressed looks from his friends.
Castiel directed his answer to Sam, but he was talking to Dean. Dean was the one he would need to convince.
“Okay, let’s, uh, do this.”
“You aren’t ready, Dean,” Castiel protested, his voice low and laced with want.
"On the bed," Dean clarified hesitantly. On the edge of it, here, or further up by the headboard -"
“I usually do,” Cas said with a flirtatious grin.
Dean closed his eyes and counted to ten, taking in a deep breath and slowly exhaling through his nose. When he was on eight, he got an idea. It was silly, but it was worth a shot.
He was brought back to the present, and possibly given a small heart attack when a husky voice approached him from behind.
Castiel looked up at him in surprise, with that adorable head tilt he did when he didn’t understand something. “You really like them?”
enthusiastic woman named Becky, Dean took a moment to peek into the ballroom. The massive space was set up with a stage on one end and filled with rows of chairs, which began with a long table clearly meant for the judges. Dean took a deep breath as butterflies fluttered around in his stomach. They were finally here.
Thank God airplanes come equipped with tiny bottles of alcohol. That’s the main reason Dean got through the three hour flight from Austin to San Diego. Cas only teased him a little before offering to share an ear bud and tilting his laptop towards him. Dean spent the rest of the flight leaning in close to Cas and watching three classic episodes of Dr. Sexy MD that Cas had already downloaded for the trip. Before he knew it, they were touching down in southern California.
“Just so you know, I’m the youngest of five kids, so I can do this all day.”
And so Castiel took Dean’s hand in his own. He stepped forward and curled his other arm around Dean’s shoulder as their bodies met. Dean splayed his free hand over Castiel’s back and held him close. While the music played neither of them spoke a word, but it sure felt like poetry as they moved together. Castiel kept his head down and inhaled deeply as his nose brushed over Dean’s neck while fighting the urge to leave kisses along his warm skin.
A cold wave coursed through Dean’s veins like whiplash. He pulled back just enough to look Cas in the eye. “I don’t want you to go. Stay with me. Please,” Dean whispered back.
There was no one currently at the front register, but Dean’s eyes caught movement in the back when a man slid a tray of pastries onto the shelf inside a case. Making his way to the back toward the makeshift cafe, he cleared his throat, causing the shorter, sandy blonde man to jump in surprise.
“Oh really? Oh my god, that’s great, thank you so much. What a relief,” Anna said with a smile.
“Yes. I understand that, Dean.”
Even though he still had a day, Castiel’s nerves made him anxious and fidgety. Sam must’ve picked up on it when he nudged Castiel’s arm.
we win, and that’s a
“You should probably close your mouth before you actually start drooling,” she teased.
Castiel chewed on his bottom lip, and nodded at him. The coldness in his eyes melted away a little bit.
“Okay, here it is,” Dean started, shaking his head and looking down at the dark wood floors. “Cas, I’m sorry about this weekend. I acted like a dick, and you didn’t deserve that.”
With his back still turned, Dean bit down on his bottom lip to fight the smirk on his face. “Eh, you know Cas. He probably just got tied up somewhere. I’m sure he’s fine.” He turned and headed back out of the kitchen towards his room. “‘Night Sammy.”
The bar tender shrugs her shoulders and gives Dean a sympathetic look. “Yeah, that sounds like family, alright. We fight with the ones we care the most about.” Again, realizing the conversation has become serious, she eases the tension. “So Cas has been with you and Sam for years now? Has he gotten to have any fun on Earth, or is it all monsters and devastation?”
Cas’ eyes went big and round, much like a puppy. “But we’re all going to the zoo this afternoon. And I still want to make it to the beach before it gets dark.”
“Yep, that’s my place. My brother Gabriel is the coffee and pastry guy. I’m just the quiet, unassuming bookworm. All I ever do is read, so the idea of owning a bookstore just made sense to me. That’s why Anna made me come with her tonight. Apparently, re-reading Harry Potter wasn't exciting to her. To be honest, this isn’t really my thing,” he said apologetically, hoping he hadn't just lost a frequent customer. He also wondered why the hell he just explained all of that to her.
They sat watching the waves, snickering when Bobby started snoring where he and Ellen were sprawled out in lounge chairs a few feet away. When Dean looked back out to find Cas, his mouth dropped at the sight of him, now encased by the glow of the fading sun behind him. He was alone, the girls having made their way back up to dry land. Cas stood waist deep, waves splashing over him, making his sun-kissed skin shine. He dropped his head back, highlighting the muscles in his neck and chest, and brought his hands up to run his fingers through his messy hair. When he brought his head back up, he opened his eyes, and immediately found Dean, giving him a smile that left Dean breathless.
The grace of his movements as he flowed through his routine was only coupled by the sheer power of his body, as every muscle flexed when he gripped the pole to keep him in the air.
He had never seen anything like it before. Like him.
And that’s how their first practice ended. With Dean teaching Castiel how to dance. It was silly and uncoordinated. The music swirled around them while they laughed and teased each other. Castiel only stepped on Dean’s toes a few times, but Dean couldn’t find himself to mind one bit.
A few notes about the story. If you are at all familiar with pole, and the competitive aspect of it, you know how much of a stretch this all is. I took quite a few liberties with it. Especially with the prize money given to the national winner. In reality it is no where near enough to help Dean buy out Bobby's business. That's why fiction is so fun.
“Alright then boys, you have fun tonight. And good luck tomorrow, hmm,” Balthazar said, backing away to go join his people out in the hallway.
Ten minutes later, Charlie reappeared with a small stack of books, including the Carrie Fisher memoir, and plopped them onto the desk. Castiel began ringing them up, remembering his promise of a friends and family discount, and holding up a used textbook on computer programming with a questioning look.
“Uh, yeah we were all going to see some of the sights while we’re here,” he informed Balthazar. “But Cas, don’t feel like you have to stay with us if you want to go to the party.”
Castiel's eyes bounced from Dean’s eyes to his mouth and back again.
“Thanks, Sam,” Castiel replied. “I just don’t want to make a fool of myself and let Dean down. He’s got so much riding on this. I’d hate to disappoint him after he’s worked so hard.”
Luckily, Cas had been too eager to get Dean’s clothes off in the back seat, so he didn’t notice anything odd. Dean reached inside his pocket and wrapped a hand around the black velvet ring box. He couldn’t wait to give it to Cas later tonight. He hoped with everything he had, that Castiel said yes. Because he couldn’t wait to have the time of his life, for the rest of his life.
They made their way out the door without another word, Dean locking up after them.
Castiel gripped the wooden headboard above him. “Dean,” he choked out. “I don’t know how much longer I can last. I feel...I feel like...without my powers I don’t have control over my vessel.”
Castiel tilted his head and squinted at him. “Alright.” He spun on his heels and headed for the aisles, which were empty now. A moment later, Dean found themselves in a secluded corner of the store, away from any prying eyes and ears of well meaning brothers. Cas straightened his back and crossed his arms in front of him, waiting, expresion guardaded and flat.
The pretty bar tender had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time on her way to work and was almost a meal for a hungry vamp.  Luckily, Sam and Dean had been tracking the vampire and stepped in before any permanent damage could be done. Afterward, Dean insisted on accompanying her to the bar (for safety, of course). Sam opted out and went back to the motel, insisting he wasn’t feeling well and just wanted to call it a night. It only took a couple cheap beers before Dean was rambling on about ghosts and hell hounds, rock salt and the apocalypse.
Nationals were only two months away. After that, Lisa could once again take up her rightful place as Dean’s partner. After all, Cas had only been a stand in. A placeholder. He was suddenly reminded of the night he and Ishim broke up, when Ishim had called him a slightly better alternative than nothing at all. Soon, Castiel would go back to his simple but lonely life before Lazarus Rising. Before Dean.
“Cas. You are my win.”
“The stimulation is supposed to be pretty awesome. We will keep it on the lowest setting for now and work up. If it ever gets to be too much and you want to stop, just tell me,” Dean whispered. Dean switched on the plug, causing it to hum quietly, and repeated his pattern, lightly running it over Cas’ instep, up behind his knee and along his inner thigh. Cas kept his mouth shut, but whimpered quietly, his face half hidden in the pillow, eyes shut. “I need to hear you, Angel. I need to hear you say you’ll tell me if you want to stop.”
Thank you SPNFamily and DCBB
“Well, maybe it’s none of my business,” he replied softly, “but I think it does matter. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be so upset about it. I mean, it’s obvious you’ve worked really hard for a reason. How long have you been practicing anyway?”
They settled on their sides facing one another, letting their legs get tangled up and wrapping their arms around each other. As Dean’s eyes grew heavy, he felt a press against his lips and opened his eyes again to find Cas holding two fingers to his mouth while he mojo’d away their mess. He kissed Castiel’s fingertips and closed his eyes again while his fingers gently combed through the soft feathers, lulling him to sleep.
Not wanting to be caught staring, Castiel reacted quickly, looking down at the empty wine glass in his hands. He took a deep breath and settled himself. Chancing another glance, he was relieved the man had returned his attention to his phone, but Castiel noticed, there was now a hint of a smile on his unfairly attractive face. Resolving himself to quit gawking like a creep, Castiel set his glass on the floor, and nearly knocked it over, startled by the presence of the front desk redhead quietly sitting next to him, scrolling through her phone.
“Apparently I’m not everyone,” Cas replied defensively. “My sister teases me about it. She says I wasn’t born with any kind of natural rhythm.”
“Other people can see you making that face, you know,” Gabriel said, startling Dean from only a few inches away now. How long had that shifty little fucker been standing next to him?
Dean’s eyes shot up to find Cas looking back at him, his pupils blown.
“I just put together an assortment of pastries from the store that we can eat on the road. I’ve got banana nut muffins for Sam, some chocolate Danish for Jess, and of course some hand pies that you should be able to eat while driving.”
“This is Balthazar. He went on right before you did. He’s actually been doing pole dance for
“I’m sorry, you wanna what now?”
“I was hoping you’d say that. Um, I have a condom in my bag if you want it. I’m clean just so you know, though. I haven’t actually been with anyone else since the accident,” Dean said, looking down at the patterned bedspread.
“Yeah. Yeah, I remember,” Dean said softly, walking over to stand next to the little table Castiel was occupying. “What are you doing here?” he asked, attempting to hide his sudden nervousness.
“Hey, Cas...um. Thanks. Just, for...you know. For listening, I guess. Thanks,” Dean said.
“Dean?”
“No one else was available to go with you tonight were they?” Castiel asked knowingly.
), he had switched out the tiny black shorts for a pair of black knee-length yoga pants. Not much better considering he was still shirtless, but Castiel had wondered if he’d be able to present his idea and not be a bumbling mess if Dean was nearly naked while he did it.
“Okay, I’m going to stop you right there. You’re not a dumbass because you guys had sex. I think that part was inevitable.”
Dean watched them pull out of the little parking lot, turned on his heels and headed for the studio next door, his head and his heart feeling just a little lighter. An hour on the pole would make him feel even better. It felt like a Metallica night.
“I still don't understand why you are insisting I go with you to this thing. It seems more like a “girls night out” kind of activity with all of your friends. Kinda weird to take your brother to a pole dance studio.”
Why hadn't he noticed Sam before? Dean had often shown him pictures of his brother. So why hadn't he recognized him? Probably because he hadn't expected to. Castiel was annoyed. He would have left immediately if he had known Sam was here.
"Don't tell me what to do!" Castiel's voice sounded exhausted and he began to shake. "Don't fucking tell me what to do!" He sobbed.
"Louisiana, Cas? For real?"
Cas walked into the bunker.
"Heavenly you say every time. Glad you like it." Dean, feeling Pie inhale, set his nearly empty plate aside, glanced at Castiel, and scrambled toward him. He took his plate from Castiel's hand, set it aside as well, and sat on Castiel's thigh.
"Cas, what the hell was that?"
Dean, on the other hand, had lifted his head again and was watching his friend. Now they heard a voice and Cas had to notice that something was different.
"Wow, Dean, that's amazing! So does Sam know about this?"
"Yes and now... Can we go to sleep?"
The truck hit the Impala with full force and threw it into the roads ditch opposite. There the car overturned and came to a halt on the roof. The cassette continued to run.
"Cas, what is it? You're scaring me!"
~ Sam and Castiel will talk in person, too
"Cas?" Castiel turned around, relieved but still tense. Standing in the doorway was Inias.
"That your pie is heavenly is because-" Dean pushed Castiel's head back slightly and placed his lips gently on Castiel's. "It's because his baker is an angel." He kissed him gently. "But you're generally an angel, Cas." Dean kissed him again, and this time Castiel replied.
heart and I'll be by your side as long as we shall live."
When he got there, he put the flowers in a glass, since they had no vases. He left the cassette in his trouser pocket. Then he made himself breakfast. Since, as he saw, there was hardly any food left, he decided to go shopping afterwards.
"Wow, I didn't know that. A little embarrassing because bees are my favourites."
"Oh, right." Castiel laughed out, slightly hysterical if you listened closely. He took a spoonful of the noodles on his plate in front of him. "Mmmh, that's what I'm saying. Delicious!"
Cas hadn't an answer to that.
"Ah, shit," whispered Dean. Castiel chuckled but didn't stop. This felt so good, so familiar. Dean opened his eyes, his breath hitched. Castiel noticed it. He slowed down.
"No." Castiel muttered. "You?"
„Okay“, Cas whispered back and was released by Dean.
With this and the imagination of doing it with Cas whenever they wished for, he came. Harder than he ever did before. His milking hole brought Cas over the edge. He shouted incoherent words too, thrusted in now without a rythem now. Then Dean felt a hot liquid inside and Cas fell on top of him. He pushed in slowly this time, just for riding out his orgasm.
He was more excited than ever about a birthday. For four months he had been taken. Not Lisa, as everyone thought. No, his boyfriend was named Castiel. Or Cas, as he called him.
"Say hello to you, ask you how you're doing? I don't know, man. Okay?"
"For what?"
Castiel had lost track of time and he feared that Dean, who had not even interrupted him, had fallen asleep. He was about to ask if Dean was still awake, but didn't get around to it.
"No, was just startled by some of the things you said. That's why I left right away. I wanted to see you."
He walked up the stairs, opened the apartment door, put his keys on the dresser in the hallway, and headed toward the living room. It was Castiel's favorite room and whenever you wanted something from him, that's where you would find him.
Dean put his head in the back of his neck and made room for Cas. But Cas had other things on his mind. In a blink, he switched positions again.
"I'm so sorry about that. If I had known what you were going through here, I would have come back!"
Castiel headed toward the bathroom, but then changed his mind and turned around. He shuddered violently.
"What is it?"
"Gabe, you're such an ass!" Castiel's response was quiet, but angry. Gabriel winked at him, stood up and now looked Castiel in the eye. A small smile played around his mouth.
With these words Cas disappeared towards the kitchen and Dean sat down at the table. Shortly afterwards Cas came back with bowls and plates on a big tray. Dean made big eyes.
Dean Winchester - a singer, a performer and a man who is loved by so many girls and women.
Then he jumped up, his chair tipping over. He threw the bottles across the kitchen, they shattered on the tiles.
Cas was glad that he was alone in his room because he blushed furiously after this verse. Dean had sang it towards Sam again but wasn't only looking in his direction but was fully turned to him.
"Cas?" Dean asked, his hips rocking back against Cas's. Castiel let out a quiet moan.
"Mmm, Cas-" But Castiel didn't seem to want to let him go at all. Now he let himself fall backward, pulling Dean with him. At first Dean propped himself up next to Castiel's head, but then lowered himself onto him. They kissed for quite a while and actually they didn't want to stop. They only allowed themselves this kind of kiss late at night, when the children were asleep, or like now, when they were alone.
"For making me never forget it now."
The phone rang and the barkeeper answered. He talked to someone and then looked at Dean.
Dean could feel the anger building up inside him. Anger about Cas, and anger about himself for not knowing.
„Dean-“
The whole thing was hurting like hell.
"Dean, it's not that simple. I-"
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Yes."
His sister Anna, his big brother Gabriel, his little brother Inias, his mother Naomi, his father Chuck, his good friend Meg and a few more people who had to belong to Gabriel. In addition to them, however, there was also a very tall, brown-haired young man and a small, petite woman with orange hair.
"Unknown number, Cas."
"Yes but I need to blow out the candles before that. By the way this idea was so cute, Cas, thank you." Dean stood up. After half the candles, he groaned.
"That sounds really good, Dean-" The phone vibrated, and Castiel picked it up and looked at the screen. Then he smiled apologetically at Dean. "Sorry, honey, my brother." Castiel stood up and walked away from the table. Dean still heard him say 'hello' quietly and softly for a moment.
Jack was pleased to see this. Sam smiled again, sometimes he even laughed again. He had no more dark circles under his eyes, rarely woke up because of nightmares and had also regained his former strength. Sam had never said it to him, but Jack could sense that Sam was glad he had brought Eileen. Sam would probably never get over the loss of his brother completely, but with Eileen he could go back to life.
What he had planned for tonight had taken weeks of planning.
"Dean, all of this is mutual. We've known each other for fifteen years and you haven't left my side for a day. No matter how hard it's been or how unbearable I used to be. You were all in when it came to adoption and you love our kids. These are just a few reasons why I love you. I really love you a lot and I would be honored to be your husband."
Dean was all the more surprised when he realized what the thought of the couple who had disappeared in one of the somewhat out-of-the-way toilets during the break was doing to him. You didn't have to be very smart to understand what was going on in there. Dean couldn't concentrate on math anymore because the idea of him and Cas...
Castiel picked himself up, rubbed his aching arm, and shuffled to the door. If it was room service, he would ask that they not return until lunch. He opened the door.
Someone knocked on his door and opened it. Castiel prayed it wasn't Gabriel.
"You know-" Castiel purred, "I'm sorry as well." His hand began to stroke Dean's erection, his own cock slid between Dean's ass cheeks. Dean asked himself blurrely when Castiel had removed his boxer shorts. The hand moved again.
Dean tied a scarf in front of Cas's eyes and the question if he could see anything else, Cas denied. He let Dean take care of him and then he was led on by him. After a couple of minutes, they stopped. Dean let Cas go, but did not take off the scarf. Cas heard a rustle and heard a faint click. Then Dean was back with him. The scarf was taken off and Cas blinked two or three times. What he could see now took his breath away.
You are simply the best and therefore it is an honour for me to accept this proposal. Yes, I will marry you.“
„Cas, no. Please, let me finish.“ He cleared his throat again.
"Uhuh," was Castiel's response. Dean bristled, but said nothing.
"Sshht", was Cas's answer. He also had to control himself and stroked Dean with his thumb reassuringly on the forehead. He gave Dean another kiss and then stepped back. "But somehow this is not the right place. Would you like to get something to eat?"
"Well, actually, I'm not a virgin anymore." Now Inias told him the story. After that he stopped and sighed.
As it got to eleven thirty, the Led Zeppelin record that Cas had last played ended. Now he put on the vinyl record he had chosen for his 'confession'. It was one of his favourite records and he hoped that it would give him confidence.
Cas watched Dean in shock for an eternity. Dean got up and walked toward Cas.
beautiful!"
"Great, so everything is settled?"
"Are you okay, Dean?" Castiel asked in a raspy voice.
" Whoever was on the phone, it wasn't Gabriel, first of all, and secondly, that one word triggered suspicion in Dean. Who was that on the phone?
He had gone to Gabriel and, since he was still sitting, stood over him.
They stood, what you could see in the darkness between trees, on a small plateau. They could look at a lake surrounded by trees and bushes. No artificial light anywhere in sight, only the stars and the moonlight reflected in the lake. Underneath them there was a soft splashing sound, which suggested that there must be a small waterfall down there.
"What?" Castiel gave a short laugh. It sounded anything but happy, though. "That I loved you?"
"I'm sorry, what?" Dean replied, now very angry. His hand clawed at the table, knuckles white. "Where am I? You know exactly where I am. But if you want it that way.... Where are you all the time? You don't even stop by my work, you don't even call when I text you that I'm on lunch break. When I do manage to get home an hour early, you just hang out in front of the TV."
