Angelo and Mrs. Hudson have a friendly rivalry about who was the first to see that the doctor and the detective belong together.  Mike really claims that prize, but no one currently cares.  They figured it out, and that’s all that matters.
“Sherlock, love, stop worrying.  He’ll be here in a moment.  You’re acting like he’s not going to turn up.”
John smiles up at him.  “Sherlock Homes,” he says, beaming, “today I’m going to make you a married man.”
“And now, if there is anyone present who objects to the joining of these two people in holy matrimony, may they now be heard.”
“Two million pounds, to be precise,” says the uninvited guest, still dripping onto the floor. “I saw it delivered to the gallery this morning, and have not left the premises until just now: but somehow, whilst the front door and windows were closed, and we were all on site at a staff meeting, the sculpture has been taken!”
He finds John on a stone bench in the garden, so he sits, too.  They sit, and they sit, and they sit, and Sherlock will hold the pieces until -- or if -- John wants to put them back together.
“You look fantastic,” says John, eyeing him.  Maybe the whole anticipation thing was a good idea after all.   In an effort not to repeat any element of John’s wedding to Mary, Sherlock opts for his own suit, but he has distinguished himself from his ordinary work wear by wearing the waistcoat.  The dark purple shirt he used to wear and that John used to admire had long been discarded, but he paid homage to it by wearing a tie of the exact same shade, a plummy-fig that paired well with the dark wool of his jacket.  He’s tried to tame his hair, but the wind has decided to get its fingers into it.  That’s OK.  He knows John likes it better wild, anyway.
But no more running, no more leaving and returning.  It’s new territory, one to be explored side-by-side.  They’re crossing a threshold, but he certainly won’t be carrying John over one. The best he can do now is rely on symbolism and hope his spouse gets the point.  “Together?” he asks softly.
John wipes tears from his eyes.  “Stop, love,” he says softly, and then kisses Sherlock’s mouth, a soft press of lips.  Sherlock quiets, realizing everyone’s staring.  “It’s fine.  I know.  Let’s just do the vows, yeah?”
The vicar looks astounded.  Several members of the congregation -- a few of Mary’s friends, perhaps --  make noises of displeasure.    Sherlock ignores them.
The bride and groom are preparing to say their vows, and the vicar is raising his hands to conduct one of the traditional elements of a wedding.
The thick, oak door to the chapel swings open so violently that everyone in the pews jumps six inches.
Mary takes a long look at the scene in front of her.  Archie is narrating the whole thing like a football commentator, Molly has found some kitchen towels, Janine looks like she’s about to vomit herself, and someone has opened the door for some air and paper decorations and flowers are drifting aimlessly about in the breeze.  Nobody is paying her the slightest attention. There is puke splattered on her wedding dress. John has completely forgotten about the ceremony, his focus solely on Sherlock.  He’s lovingly cradling Sherlock’s head with one hand and holding a waste-paper basket with the other.
John smiles.  “I might not always want to come first, Sherlock. It depends what we’re doing with each other. But I promise to always come when convenient.’
Soon, he and John are placed behind the seats, and then they walk down the centre aisle together, arms linked.  When he gets to the front he remembers to hold John’s hands in his.  Thankfully, there is no script to follow, none of those empty ceremonial rituals that simply had to be done at John’s wedding to Mary.
“I can never seem to apologise enough for leaving you.  I honestly did not know how much it would affect you.  I was so foolish.  Stupid.  Blind.  Unable to see what was in front of my own eyes.  There are so many things I should have done, and so many things I should have done better.  I should have told you how much you meant to me, how much I depend on you to keep me right.  How much I enjoy your presence.  I should have done this immediately upon my return.  You told me the day we met that I was an idiot, and I do not deny it now.
“The thing is, we all know that isn’t really true. Yes, you’ll be available just like you always were...for a few weeks. And then it’ll be, ‘no, sorry, I can’t meet on Wednesdays because that’s the night we go to the cinema’. And Mondays will be no good because it’s the beginning of the working week. Sundays you’ll be unavailable all day at bloody John Lewis buying home furnishings, or the garden centre choosing shrubs and dwarf apple trees. And not Fridays or Saturdays because Mary likes us to ‘do things’ together..’, or worse, spend time with other couples, nice safe smug married couples, all sitting around someone’s lovely dining table talking about house prices and schools and eating something organic from the farmers’ market and there won’t be a bloodstain or a bullet anywhere because you’ll have settled down, and put all that running around with that maniac Sherlock Holmes behind you...”
John makes as if to go to Sherlock, but Mary pulls him back so forcefully that his dodgy shoulder is nearly yanked out of its socket.
John nods and sighs with something less than the expected enthusiasm, but Mary looks smug. Nothing’s going to spoil her perfect day. Especially not the absence of John’s eccentric twerp of a best friend. (Such a shame the alarm clock on his phone is faulty. Anyone would think it had been tampered with.)
“There’ve been five long years I've known this man/Killed for him, grieved for him/For nearly five years my life’s been his/If that's not love, what is?”
And then, with all the grace of a drunken teenager, Sherlock projectile vomits onto the altar.  John doesn’t quite duck in time.  It’s the stuff of horror films.
Sherlock rubs his thumb over John’s hand.  John rubs back.  Small intimacies, Sherlock thinks, small intimacies that mean so much.  Theirs is the language of small intimacies, right from the very start: raised eyebrows, the quirk of lips, a touch held a second too long.  A laugh in the dark.  Shared silence.  A drink in front of the fire.
No one notices Sherlock at all, who is frowning harder than ever. His gaze, however, isn’t on the bride and groom. Instead, he is looking intently at Archie. If his “wedding gift” is going to make an appearance, they’d better get on with it. Then, as if on cue, Sherlock notices something move inside Mary’s veil.
John’s shoulders droop.  He doesn’t deny it.  “When was it?” he finally asks.  “You told me that you two had ‘casually dated.’  That was clearly a lie.  So.  When was it?  The last time?”
Mary pauses a moment, then seems to come to a decision. She looks over at John, shrugs her shoulders, and follows her best friend out of the church door.
If this scene were from a soap opera, Mary would storm up to Sherlock and slap him round the face, then burst into tears, stamp on her bouquet and thrust the bedraggled stems at John in disgust. Janine would slap John, grab Mary, and put supportive arms around her as she led her out of the church--somehow managing to wink at Sherlock and slipping him her phone number in the process.
The vicar has posed his question and Sherlock hiccups a response, drawing Mary’s attention.  She is instantly concerned.
I also have a tumblr.  Not much is on there, but I will try to post writing updates.  Make sure to subscribe to the story so you get update notifications!
“But the rainbow letters!’ says Sherlock, ‘surely they came from a higher authority than the, er...the..King of Vicars.”
And then, there’s John himself, walking through the gate.  Even at this distance, Sherlock deduces his mood from his posture and gait: John is confident, satisfied, and profoundly happy.  As John approaches, Sherlock admires him.  He’s older now than when they first met; his hair is completely grey, and the lines on his face have deepened, a testament to John’s expressive nature.  But he’s taken to keeping fit these days, jogging several times a week and doing a basic military regime of push-ups and sit-ups every morning.  His shoulder bothers him in the cold, but he never whinges; Sherlock rubs the knots out of it with his hands in front of the fire.  Sherlock is struck again how much he adores John, not just his personality, but the package it comes in as well.  John’s body is home, John’s body is love.  Sherlock’s transport readily agrees.
Sherlock considers.  The case is barely a five.  In fact, he could likely solve it right on the spot if he hadn’t had as much to eat as he did.  He’s also a bit tipsy -- not good for deductions.  Normal people are supposed to go home and consummate the marriage, not chase thieves all over London.
As best man, he supposes it’s his job to stay and sort it out and pick up the pieces.  But the only pieces that matter are those that make up John, so he heads out the same way.
“Maybe you should have,” he replies.  “It would have saved us a hell of a lot of trouble.”  Then, “Why didn’t you?”
“Right,” Sherlock says at last, stepping back and clapping his hands together.  “Attention, everyone!” he says as he finds his coat and shrugs it on.  Thank you everyone for coming and et cetera; we’ve had a lovely time.  Angelo?  Pack up some cake with Mrs. Hudson.   Wouldn't want Mycroft eating it all, now, would we?”  He winks at his brother, who takes the barb good-naturedly; the rivalry has been suspended, for now.
“You may not,” replies John.  David is taller than John, but John’s presence, notes Sherlock, is expanding to fill the entire church.   Not too long ago, the wrath of John was turned on him.  The man can convey so much in a twitch of lips and clench of jaw.
Inside the tastefully decorated chapel (more lemon and lilac), the bride and groom stand at the altar, hands clasped. The vicar--a stern, elderly bear of a man who must be a foot taller than John--gestures none too subtly at his watch and begins to tap his foot, adding a steely, insistent touch to the increasingly ominous sound of drums.  To the right of the bride stands an attractive young woman  with dark hair.  She is looking at the bride and sniffing back happy tears.  She is Janine, the chief bridesmaid.
But now Sherlock has spotted John, deduced his imminent departure and leapt over the last pews to gather him into his arms. John shrugs him off, and Sherlock returns to the altar, and sinks to his knees, defeated.
The venom in John’s voice is nearly enough to derail him, but Sherlock presses on.  So far, he’s ignored the audience, purposefully speaking to the air in front of him, the stones on the floor, the great empty space above the pulpit.  Now, he takes a shaky breath and looks out, seeing the faces of his “friends” -- Molly, who is covering her mouth with her hand.  Lestrade, who is leaning forward, eyebrows drawn together, concerned.  Mrs. Hudson, worrying the lipstick off her lower lip with her teeth, her eyes hopeful.
Sherlock thinks much of what his brother is saying is a load of bollocks.  John is telling him as much with his eyes.
“No,” he repeats for the third time, but this time he’s firmly in the present.   “Not you, John.  For you, yes, always.  Yes.  Absolutely, yes.”  John lets out a breath and the world begins to turn again.
Sherlock does know a thing or two about sex.  He can always tell who is sleeping with who, or, in this case, who
Now, the night before what he likes to call “the real wedding,” he’s unpacked that box.  It’s time to delete those imaginings.  They are no longer useful and they remind him of his failure to connect with John intimately before he took a leap off a roof and completely compromised their friendship.  His least selfish act - letting John go, watching him exchange vows with Mary, and promising to keep the two of them safe from harm - still feels like raw, still rankles in the back of his mind, even though John has told him, again and again, to let it go.  They had each caused each other heartbreak and despair, but now they could devote themselves to each other in a way they could not have a few years ago.
“I’m terribly sorry to bother you,” says the dripping man, panting a bit.  He suddenly takes in the scene -- the guests eating cake, the music, the formal attire -- and realises he’s possibly ruined a very special affair.  “Um, is this, did you, are you…?”
For one awful minute John tries to make sense of what’s happening.  “Oh,” he says, hurt to the core of his being.  “OK.  Well.  I guess I’m just going to…”  John moves back, letting go of Sherlock’s hands, but the detective is quick to grab them back.
Sherlock is not afraid of many things.  He is not troubled by blood or guts, does not believe in anything supernatural, embraces death as a natural consequence of life, can suffer pain.  (He’s not a big fan of heights any more, however.)  Besides being called stupid, reckless, and careless, people have also called him brave.
Inside the chapel, a man and a woman stand at the altar, their hands clasped.  The man is smiling.  He is wearing a smart grey suit with tails.  Somehow, he looks more radiant than the bride, but that may be a trick of the lighting.  He is John Watson. The woman is just as short as the man whose hands she’s clasping.  Her lace dress is beautiful, her blonde hair artistically styled with flowers.  A smile plays on her lips, coquettish thing.  She is Mary Morstan.  The chapel is not entirely full of guests, but there are a number of people gathered to see this couple wed.  It is a joyful occasion for everyone.
When she was three Abigail began periodic visits to Baker Street, and Sherlock attempted, uncomfortably, to be more than “that man daddy lives with.”  Fatherhood fit him poorly at first, and he wore the role uncomfortably, until he was forced to deal with it one weekend when Mary was out of town and John was called in to cover a colleague’s shift.  There was a great deal of tantrumming from the two of them, until late in the evening when they somehow came to a truce.  John had returned home to find Sherlock looking completely exhausted and playing something soft on the violin, Abigail asleep on the sofa with her thumb in her mouth.  Now that she’s six, Sherlock finds himself actually able to engage in conversation with her, and, most of the time, he enjoys her company.  Contact is flexible, but John and Abigail usually see each other at least once a week, and Mary and John have remained civil about the whole thing.  Sometimes John berates himself for not being a better dad, and Sherlock wonders if John regrets his decision to leave life as a father behind.  John insists that he has made the right choice and gets incredibly upset if Sherlock suggests otherwise.
Sherlock would project those films one last time, for posterity, then chuck away the reels to make way for the rest of their lives together.
The breeze picks up and rain threatens, which prompts everyone to quickly head to the exit.  Sherlock takes a rose from the marquee and tucks it in the lapel of his suit jacket as Mycroft’s minions begin dismantling and picking up the chairs.  He clasps John’s hand, their fingers laced together, as they walk slowly toward the gate.
that threaten to destroy me utterly.  Ask Lestrade. His squad still has a sweepstake open, did you know that?
24hrs earlier, Sherlock was removing a specific strain of S. enterica from an incubator.  Hoping he hadn’t miscalculated their potency, he put them in solution.  He filled an empty perfume atomiser (Dior’s
He’s appalled at himself. Where did this fantasy come from--and why was it so amazingly detailed? It’s so, so wrong. He’s (a) straight; and (b) about to get married to the woman he loves, for goodness sake!
“And now, if there is anyone present who objects to the joining of these two people in holy matrimony, may they now be heard.”
Just then, the ceremony begins, the priest’s singsong fluting underscored by the relentless wheeze of the organ and the tapping of the invisible, yet insistent, drum machine. It lulls John into a trance. Until the congregation repeat their dance move.
He doesn’t get to finish.  John lashes out, a sharp left hook landing neatly across David’s nose, which promptly erupts with blood.  The punch to the face is followed by a second to the stomach, and then Lestrade is there, grabbing at David, who manages to throw a punch of retaliation himself.
Now, he’s endured the whole ceremony with intense nausea and a cramping gut.  Never one to miss an opportunity for drama, however, he’s holding back to the appropriate moment, which has now, blessedly arrived.  The contents of his stomach are determined to make their escape.  He really, really hopes that everything decides to come out his mouth and not the other end.
He meets Mary’s eyes, which are now filled with fear.  “John,” she cautions, her eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
“I don’t want that line,” Sherlock says pointedly to Mycroft.  “It’s not necessary.  Because even if there were some legal reason I couldn’t marry this man, I would find a way to circumnavigate it.  Such laws are stupid and
Sherlock makes a noise.  It’s an unpleasant sort of noise that speaks of the unpleasantness going on his belly.
Around eight, Mary arrives to pick up Abigail.  It’s actually not nearly as awkward as it could be.  She actually hugs both John and Sherlock and whispers her congratulations.  Sure, the turn of her mouth reveals she’s still bitter, but she’s also a woman well-versed in letting go of her past.  Abigail’s been dancing with Lestrade and Molly: she looks exhausted under her flushed cheeks.
If Angelo Peretti had not placed a candle on the table all those years ago, Sherlock may never seen the potential of John as a romantic partner.   John still swears that he had no ulterior motives when he asked Sherlock if the detective was attached to someone, that he just wanted to know, but Sherlock still recalls his deductions: ability to form deep, emotional relationships with men, repressed bisexuality, lost confidence, loyal, moderately clever, and desperately lonely.
“Is church always this much fun?” asks Mr Chatterjee, whose previous exposures to Christianity were limited to a rather dull Sunday service and an even duller funeral.
Sherlock’s parents, for the most part, are perfectly normal people.  Both Holmes boys inherited their mother’s brains and their father’s charm.  And although both Holmes brothers are often mistaken for landed gentry, the truth was that Mr. and Mrs. Holmes brought their boys up just like ordinary, loving parents do everywhere.  They played with them often, taught them to love learning, to enjoy nature, to tell a good joke, to read, and to make tea.   Daddy kicked footballs around and pretend-wrestled and told a horribly frightening ghost story.  Mummy was brilliant but kind, made flapjacks and cheated at card games just to make sure the boys were paying attention.  Mummy also had a horribly embarrassing love for classic musicals and a habit of banging out Rodgers & Hammerstein on the family piano whenever the mood took her..
John raises his eyebrows and nods.  He looks rather goofy, actually, silly smile on his face, cheeks flushed with mirth and wine.  “Yeah.  OK, then.  Together.”  John  links their arms together and Sherlock has never felt more complete.
John’s mouth is open in complete indignation.  He looks to Sherlock, as if he should have been warned of this.  Sherlock only shrugs.
. That is my objection,” explains Sherlock, gesturing towards the pews. “Gordon Lestrade, in the front row, is from the police, and I am telling him, as I am, indeed, telling you all. That woman, over there…” and he points dramatically at Mary, “is a liar and a thief.”
“...thrush?” continues Sherlock, his voice (unfortunately for Janine) carrying perfectly over the noise of the guests’ inebriated chatter, “vaginal warts? Chlamydia? Herpes...?”
And then, the only sound in the Mind Palace Cinema is the thup-thup, thup-thup, thup-thup of a projector that has run out of film.
, the village just too perfect, and those clouds a little too fluffy? On closer inspection, they could all be...fake. Like you might find on a film set, perhaps. Or painted into scenery at the theatre.
“Oh, I know--despite what everyone else thinks--we have never even so much as touched one another romantically. You might even have thought me incapable of it. I know my obvious reaction to the Woman confused you. And I will confess, John, that she deeply fascinated me. But only my intellect was aroused, not my libido. Adler’s undoubted beauty, soft curves and willing flesh stimulated my mind only to consider how very much more I might have preferred it, if a certain Army doctor, so ostensibly unremarkable, but so beautiful to me, and all I could ever hope for...the very epitome of my desire, were to insinuate himself beneath my duvet one lonely night.  She taught me a very important lesson, you know, that night at Battersea.  It was the first time I saw our potential as lovers: you were jealous.  Adler knew, too, saw it in your eyes, written all over your face.  You insisted you were not gay - which you’re not, for the most part, except for a few dalliances in the Army you would rather not acknowledge.”  He pauses a moment, grimacing as John blushes.  “Sorry.  Anyway,
They stand there smiling stupidly at each other for a moment before one of Mycroft’s people comes to see if they are ready to start the ceremony soon.  John says he wants to see his daughter first, and he leans up to kiss Sherlock on the cheek before moving to the seats to Abigail.  Sherlock watches him pick her up and kiss her before greeting the older Holmeses and Mrs. Hudson.
“It would also be remiss of me to fail to thank you.  Mary, I owe you my deepest gratitude for loving this man when I could not.  For helping him through the grief I caused him.  I know you think you can offer him everything he wants in a woman: humor, kindness, strength, friendship, loyalty.  You are a formidable woman.  I suppose that’s what this all boils down to.  I am decidedly
“I only have a few moments,” begins Sherlock, “before someone does the ‘right’ thing and forces me away, but I swear, John, in front of our friends, that I do object to your marriage.  I object to your domestication, what will likely be the suffocation of your spirit, and your submission to the status quo.  Your mind will grow stagnant and your heart will ache for the thrill of the chase.  You will lay awake at night wishing we were running through dark alleys.  You will long for
Late spring. A church. The exact location of the church is irrelevant, although it is the chapel of St. Mary Magdelene’s in Bristol. It’s a beautiful day. The gardens are lush and verdant, ivy clings to weathered stone walls, and the lilacs are in full bloom. It’s a perfect day for a wedding, and, indeed, a wedding is taking place inside.
“Eurovison winner,” John whispers back.  “Quite the voice.  Gorgeous lady - with a beard.  On the telly a few years back. You were quite rapt, remember?”
John may have never forgiven Sherlock had it not been for one smoky emergency and Mary’s instance that they talk.  Then there was a tense moment in a tube carriage and Sherlock had let John panic simply to force the issue of forgiveness.  They were crap at talking about the big, important stuff.  So many things always left unsaid.  Nothing like tense moments to skirt around the real issues, those lurking behind insults.
Mary was interesting, at least.  In fact, Sherlock even sort of liked her, even if there was something not quite right about her.  He couldn’t pinpoint it, but then there was something not quite right about John, too, so what did it matter.  John was still himself when he was around her, which was more than Sherlock could have ever hoped for if John found it necessary to enter the institution of marriage with a woman.  She was older than John’s usual type, and she had a decent sense of humour: quirky, a bit offbeat.
.  We both knew it, though neither of us could acknowledge it at the time.  When I met you, you ripped the veil off the world for me.  You, John.  You unassuming man, my conductor of light.
Unfortunately for him, those padlocks just don’t want to stay shut when Sherlock’s inebriated.  There’s a reason he doesn’t often get pissed.  A few days after his disastrous stag night, with the wedding looming ahead of him, he stole a couple of bottles of 1990 Chateau Latour from Mycroft’s cellar.   What his brain did with his misery was rather colourful.
Sherlock doesn’t argue.  They walk through the park hand-in-hand, in silence.  The door to 221b closes silently behind them.  They skip the squeaky eighth step without thinking about it.  The lights stay off.  No one bothers with teeth.  They leave their clothes over the chair in their bedroom before collapsing in bed.  Sherlock curls to his side; John spoons him, breath hot and moist between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.  Sherlock finds John’s arm, pulls it over him.
To the right of the bride stands an attractive young woman with dark hair.  She is sniffing back happy tears.  She is Janine.  Faces of friends smile from the audience: Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade, first name unimportant.
to me, Mary,” continues John, his voice a broken thing that echoes off the marble.  “I’m surrounded by liars!”
There were a few cases, nothing incredibly important. Sherlock took them on just for the opportunity to be Sherlock and John again, and then John had to go and ruin everything by telling Sherlock he loved him (in a purely platonic way, of course) and wanted him to be his best man.
Inside the chapel, a man and a woman stand at the altar, their hands clasped.  The man is smiling.  He is wearing a smart grey suit with tails.  Somehow, he looks more radiant than the bride, but that may be a trick of the lighting.  He is John Watson. The woman is just as short as the man whose hands she’s clasping.  Her lace dress is beautiful, her blonde hair artistically styled with flowers.  She is Mary Morstan.  The chapel is not entirely full of guests, but there are a number of people gathered to see this couple wed.  It is a joyful occasion for everyone.
One night when Sherlock had been particularly awful, Mrs. Hudson came up with tea and biscuits to try to appease the angry god of the violin.  Instead of consoling him, however, she made things much worse by explaining to Sherlock how her wedding to Mr. Hudson would have never happened if she had the courage to make her feelings known to a young man named Henry who went on to marry one of her close friends.  She had a habit of doing things like that -- going on about emotional
There is a roll of drums. Now the priest has acquired a shiny retro microphone, a spotlight, a cheesy pink dog collar emblazoned with Swarovski crystals reading “WWJD”, and a terrible cod-American drawl. “OK everyone, listen up. If there is anyone present who objects to the joining of these two people in holy matrimony, may they now be heard.”
We are in a gorgeous, chocolate-box of a village. The exact location is irrelevant, although it is meant to be St. Mary Magdalene’s, a 15th century chapel in rural Somewhereshire.  It’s a beautiful day.  The gardens are lush and verdant, ivy clings to weathered stone walls, and the lilacs are in full bloom.  It’s a perfect day for a wedding, and, indeed, a wedding is about to take place inside.
Archie cheers and launches straight back into the Wedding March (traditional version). Sherlock produces the proper rings, slips one on the fourth finger of his left hand and the other on John’s, then nods to the vicar.
“No, you don’t, Sherlock,” says John, sadly. “You love making a scene. You love attention. You love an audience. And you’ve certainly got one today. But I can’t watch any more. Maybe Mary wasn’t right for me after all, and perhaps she never was: but just now, all I want is some air.’
Thankfully, Mrs. Hudson arrives, walking down the path on Mycroft’s arm, and Sherlock goes to help her to her seat next to his parents.  Mrs. Hudson is looking very frail as of late, and her makeup, although still precisely applied, doesn’t quite cover her pallor.  As he watches her chat with his parents, Sherlock deduces.  Maximum life spans appear above their heads before he realises it.  The three of them don’t have that much longer.  He has always accepted death as an inevitable part of life, to be accepted and embraced and not fussed about. Then he died and changed his mind.  They look happy there, undoubtedly telling stories about John and himself.  Sherlock may occasionally find his parents insufferable, but he is deeply happy that they are here today, to see him marry John.  He wishes John’s parents were here as well, although John has intimated that they would not have been as enthusiastic to see their son marry another man.  (They wouldn’t have forgiven him for divorcing Mary, anyway, John insists).
Sherlock springs into action, grabbing John by the shoulders and pulling him away.  “Leave it, John,” he murmurs.
Sherlock sighs, looking at Mary, who meets his eyes from her place on the steps.  She’s hurt and very angry.  But by some miracle she lets him continue.
“Well,” says John, too loudly.  “Are you going to deny this?  Tell me you’re denying it.  Mary?  Mary?”
Everyone, that is, except the best man, who looks like he’s about to keel over.  He’s pale and sweating.  He is Sherlock Holmes, known to most in the audience as John’s unusual friend and solver of unusual crimes (and a bit of a prick).  Sherlock never looks particularly happy, except at a crime scene, so seeing him look a bit off surprises no one, except for Mary, who occasionally eyes the best man with...concern?  Suspicion?  Triumph?
“Jesus,” John muttered, backing out of the room slowly. He closed the door behind him and continued his way down the hall, finding nothing else of interest besides a library-like room full of books and a box labeled ‘pre-transition’. Against his better judgement, John opened it, only to find several thick photo albums. They were all filled with pictures of a little girl at various ages in various dresses. One was of a young Sherlock, probably aged fourteen, with long hair and a toothy smile, next to a tall man in a three piece pinstripe suit with an umbrella, looking grave. Feeling goosebumps rise on his skin, John put the photo album back where he had found it and exited the room.
“Oh shit,” says Archie’s mother under her breath, before quickly dragging the boy out, much to his dislike.
“Jilted by your best man?” smiles the vicar, in a voice that should rumble like thunder, but in fact is camper than Christmas.  “Don’t worry, loves. I’ve got spares. When he finally gets here, you can swap them for the real ones. OK?”
John pauses. He looks at Sherlock, then at the congregation, who all seem to be on one bated breath.
Unfortunately, Sherlock’s heart wasn’t nearly as mature as his mind at that moment, so it did what hearts do best when they’re broken: it turned to sarcasm, ridicule, biting humour.  He promptly ruined John’s attempt at a romantic proposal and earned several bruises, bumps, and lacerations for his trouble.
.) A centipede caught in the garden and strategically placed up the trouser leg of one stressed-out older brother earned him a thrashing from Mycroft and a week without sweets from Mummy, but the sound that came from Mycroft’s mouth - a shrill, feminine thing - had made the prank totally worth it.
Then Sherlock takes aim with his extraordinary eyes--nearly turquoise in the spotlight--and fixes Mary with a stare that says everything. Literally. Words, neatly formed in helvetica 32-point, cloud around her like literary confetti, a bridal shower of devastating truth: “marrying for money”; “serial cheater”; “uses supermarket bread mix;” “tax evader”; and “gambling debts”; mingle with “heartbreaker”; “Daily Mail reader”; and--most devastating of all-- “orgasm faker”.
“Divine patience is finite,” everyone reads laboriously. “Sherlock Loves You. You Love Him. Admit it, Get Married & Stop Wasting the Rev’s Time--He’s Got a Christening at 4pm.”
The wind chooses this time to gust through Queen Mary’s Garden and the roses on the marquee; they tremble, then go still.   If birds still sing, the clouds march on overhead, or children play on the opposite side of the garden, no one notices.  For those gathered, London comes to a complete standstill as Sherlock Holmes struggles to pull himself out of the past and back into his wedding.
“I do not doubt that you love this woman,” he appeals to John, who still won’t meet his eyes.  “Even I, for as much as I want to, cannot even bring myself to hate her, despite her poor fashion choices and bad taste in literature.  She’s been kind to me, accepting me as your friend and even allowing me the ‘privilege’ of planning most of today, a task I have earnestly tried to perform to the best of my ability even though it was more challenging than working with forensic investigators with substandard IQs.
Mycroft smirks smugly. “It’s not for you.  After all the headaches you’ve caused me the past decade?  I think not.  This is for John.”
Unable to let anything related to John go, Sherlock committed those scenarios -- from the plausible to the absolutely insane --  to memory on old-fashioned film reels stored in a sealed box in the projection room of his Mind Palace’s cinema.
John visibly pales.  Mycroft looks stricken.  Sherlock’s mother has her hand over her mouth and Abigail’s eyebrows are crunched together in confusion.  She looks to Mrs. Hudson for support, who clasps her hand.  Lestrade’s mouth has fallen open and Molly’s set her jaw.
“Seriously, Sherlock.  What kind of a man brings a gun to his own wedding?”  Has his gun?  Of course he does.
“Who the fuck organised that brat to do music?” seethes Mary quietly, knowing that to evict dear little Archie from his musical eyrie would be the ultimate in Bridezilla behaviour and therefore endear her to no-one. “That wasn’t on the spreadsheet I signed off. Wait til we see Sherlock. I’ll bloody deck him.”
The screen is almost entirely dark: the sun has not yet risen. We hear the plaintive sound of violin music, vaguely eastern European in character: definitely not English, but part of the multicultural soundscape nevertheless. As the day slowly dawns, the camera pans to the lone musician, dressed in simple peasant attire, eyes closed in rapture, teetering on the very edge of the hospital roof.
Sherlock threads the projector.  This scenario just might have worked.  But it would have only delayed the wedding, not prevented John exchanging vows with Mary.  Nevertheless, it makes him chuckle to think of causing such a scene.  Of all the ways to interrupt a wedding, this one was by far the most unpleasant - and messy.
“Because he’s an idiot,” Sherlock tells her softly, voice audibly less worried than before, before turning back to John.  Their eyes meet, lock gazes.  “I’m not going to tell you cannot marry her, but if I had had any foresight whatsoever and even the slightest bit of your courage, it would have been me opposite you now, pledging to you what I now know has always been yours: my heart.  I love you, John Hamish Watson.  I love you with every molecule of my being, and therefore I object to your marriage.”
“Don’t interfere,” Mycroft had warned as the wedding drew closer.  Sherlock had pouted at him.  “Whatever you thought could be, that time has passed.  You don’t know what he went through.  Let him go.”
John looks around at the disaster that used to be his wedding. Everyone seems to have forgotten him. Mary has let him go completely and  is now firmly focused on the embarrassed Janine, as she makes her way out of the church pursued by the sound of Sherlock’s increasingly intimate deductions. ”..vaginismus? Piles…? Pubic lice?”
and I’ll not have it at my wedding.  No one gets to object to this.”  Mycroft raises an eyebrow but remains silent.
John’s face is bathed in soft light as he slowly lifts his gaze, up from the simple oak floorboards painted to look like ancient flagstone, up past his furious fiancee to the confused clergyman, and finally, up to the handsome, familiar face of his ex-flatmate. He swallows, but still says nothing. His navy blue eyes are huge, a little boy lost on this big, grown-up day. Perhaps he is in shock. Or imagining Sherlock, dressed as Frank N Furter, slowly removing a pair of stockings.
For as logical as he is, Sherlock does have a fairly healthy imagination.  The month before John’s wedding, Sherlock was spinning utterly ridiculous scenarios of how to disrupt the nuptials that would ruin his chance of ever being more than John’s best friend.  Plotting nefarious schemes did serve a purpose in solving crime, after all.  And he does so love a good bit of drama.
Everyone, that is, except the best man, who stands to the left of the groom.  He’s been worrying his lower lip throughout most of the ceremony, and the closer the couple gets to the vows, the more his expression changes from discomfort to anguish.  It looks like he’s swallowing glass.
Full and content, Sherlock thinks that maybe this is the time he and John escape back to Baker Street and have sex until they drop of sheer exhaustion when there is a pounding on the door that cannot be ignored.  Angelo opens it, annoyed at the man’s insistence and tries to tell him that there’s a private gathering and the restaurant is closed to the public.  The man actually pushes past Angelo (no easy feat) and looks around wildly.  His hair is sticking to his head, little rivulets of rain trickle down his face and neck and into his coat.
If this scene were from a romance, it would be at this moment that the audience would erupt in cheers, John would leap from the altar into Sherlock’s arms in a turbulent moment of passion, Mary would slink away into the corner and the vicar would marry the two of them instantly and they would live happily ever after, or something to that effect.
John has spent most of the day at Mike’s place, convinced that spending the day apart was not only traditional but a way to build anticipation.  (Sherlock had told John that there was no need to build anticipation, and then showed him just how much he anticipated being legally married with a morning blow job.  John left anyway.)
Many members of the audience do the same; slowly, the church empties as the sad little drama continues up front.  The bridesmaids congregate at the side of the church where Janine is trying to figure out what to do.
man.  My best friend, warden of my well being and my heart.  I have spent the majority of my life without you, but it was only the years I spent with you that I was well and truly alive.  You are never boring.”
“Upstaged at my own wedding,” she says out loud to no one in particular.  “By Sherlock bloody Holmes.”
“People do this, I’m told.  Give up their friendships to forge deeper, more mature relationships with their spouses.  They move on, find new friends.  Perhaps this would be acceptable if what we had was only friendship, John.  But it’s more than that.  Ask them,” he says, gesticulating to the audience, “ask any of them what we were, what we are.   We’ve never been ‘just friends’.  From the moment we met, things were
“And now, if there is anyone present who objects to the joining of these two people in holy matrimony, may they now be heard.”
keep him right.  John reins him him, his fixed point.  A comet hurtles through space until a star pulls it back, and it always returns, cold ice melting and turning it into a brilliant cosmic phenomenon.  It’s how they’ve defined themselves for years.
“No, Mary, just….”  David is now acutely aware that everyone in the audience is staring him down.   He swallows and wipes sweat from his brow.  “Can we go somewhere more private?”
In his mind palace, he runs his fingers over metal film canisters, wondering where to begin. Ah, yes. This one. In Sherlock’s younger years, before he found the behavior too juvenile and discovered other ways to disturb his older brother, a certain way to wind up Mycroft Holmes was to surprise him during moments of intense concentration. About the time Mycroft was studying for his A-levels, Sherlock had taken a great interest in all things insect. He admired anything that wore a shell and had its soft parts on the inside (he’d taken an interest in Kafka that summer and ardently hoped he could wake up one day to find himself turned into a beetle. That would show
Sherlock is being hugged by Mrs Hudson and Molly, neither of whom cared much for Mary, mostly because she wasn’t Sherlock.  The remaining guests have their backs turned to the altar, Archie’s attempting a drum’n’bass version of the Wedding March on the organ, and the vicar’s trying to send a live feed to Youtube. Luckily, a higher power--possibly Mycroft, or even the vicar’s big boss Above, has blocked mobile communications for the entire village.
“I knew there was something a bit off about that girl,” Mrs Hudson insists. “She’s got hair like a nightclub bouncer.”
I conclude by taking this opportunity to inform any criminals who may be reading this blog to kindly refrain from committing any interesting crimes until the time John and I return from our sex holiday.
“Reckoned you’d be here.”  They sit in companionable silence for awhile.   Sherlock takes John’s hand.  The breeze heralds autumn.
Lestrade arrives and shakes Mycroft’s hand.  He asks what he can do to help; Mycroft suggests they wait at the gate for guests to arrive.  Sherlock hears Lestrade laugh, loudly, as he and his brother walk down the long path toward the entrance of the gardens.
when Sherlock was feeling raw and unsettled.  She ended the story nearly weeping into her tea. Apparently Henry died of stomach cancer a few years later, oblivious to the woman who had loved him so dearly.   It made Sherlock feel worse than ever.
Everyone, that is, except the best man, who stands, tense as a spring, to the left of the groom. There’s a line drawn between his brows and his lips are slightly turned down. It’s not quite a pout, but it is clear that this man is both unhappy and uncomfortable. He is Sherlock Holmes, known to most in the audience as John’s unusual friend and solver of unusual crimes (and a bit of a prick). Sherlock never looks particularly happy, except at a crime scene, so seeing him look put out surprises no one.
Abigail heartily agrees.  Sherlock’s dad always has sweets in his jacket pocket; Abigail learned quickly how to charm her way into his heart several Christmases ago.  “Don’t be nervous,” she tells her soon-to-be stepfather as they cross the lawn.  “Sometimes people get nervous on their wedding days, you know.  But dad really loves you.  He told me.  Mum said so, too.  I think you’re a great team.”  She says this with such conviction that Sherlock can’t help but smile.
Sherlock studies his father, who sits quietly, contentedly, as his mother goes on about the changes to the park since she was a child.  His father’s hands are still large, slender, and strong, though they are now spotted with age and the knuckles have swollen.  The one grasping the cane still bears the wedding ring he’s always worn, even though he married long before rings became traditional for men.  Sherlock wonders if his father has ever removed it, wonders how his own will feel.  He will wear one, too.  John had seemed genuinely surprised when Sherlock suggested they go and choose, and was even more surprised when Sherlock selected a plain gold design that would clearly mark him as a married man.
To the right of the bride stands an attractive young woman with dark hair.  She is sniffing back happy tears.  She is Janine.  She has her eyes on Sherlock and is thinking about what he looks like under that formal outfit.  Faces of friends smile from the audience: Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade, first name unimportant.
And then there were those moments they’d shared together, those moments that weren’t exactly platonic: closer proximity than necessary, a hand on a shoulder, a gaze held too long, the hitch of breath or race of pulse.  There
He cannot decide what is the braver thing to do: interrupt John’s wedding or let the man marry Mary Morstan.  It’s a problem a whole box of nicotine patches could not illuminate.
It wasn’t until he walked into that restaurant, determined to swoop back into John’s life, that he realized the chasm he’d made when he convinced John he’d died, how much he’d damaged him.  It was also in those very few seconds upon entering the restaurant and seeing John there, moustached and nervous, that Sherlock realised John was going to propose to a woman and that was simply the worst conceivable consequence of his leaving.  It was also then, at that moment, that all the
Suddenly, an image of Sherlock, performing “Sweet Transvestite”, leaps into John’s addled brain, towering over him, a panther stalking a baby rabbit, Belstaff hanging seductively open to reveal long, long legs in black stockings, pouty oh-so-kissable mouth outlined in scarlet lipstick, elegant waist, snake hips in leather briefs, and high, high heels.
our wedding night.  It’s raining.  And it could be dangerous.”  He thinks for a moment.  “Do you have your gun?” he asks quietly, eyebrow raised.
Those left in the congregation are shifting uncomfortably, not knowing how to escape from this spectacle.
Suddenly there is the sound of a thunderclap, followed by a five-harp glissando and angelic harmonies. Golden letters formed of ancient-looking script appear magically above the altar, supported by cherubim.
Sherlock clasps his hands together now, brings them to his lips a moment and looks at John, who has finally managed to meet his eyes, where Sherlock sees that his brilliant anger has dissipated into a combination of confusion, disbelief, and fatigue.
Tonight, Angelo has pulled out all the stops for the reception, closing to the public and bringing out course after course of the finest he can offer.  Sherlock actually eats.  He drinks several glasses of an excellent Barolo 2005 from Angelo’s personal cellar.  He deduces that everyone in the place is delighted for them, and while he has never before cared what other people think of him, he’s pleased that his relationship with John is met with acceptance and support.  Makes it easier for John, at least.
If this scene were a 1970s porn film, John’s moustache would suddenly reappear, Mary’s hair would get a lot blonder and a lot longer, a disco ball would drop from the ceiling and everyone would get naked and get off, in various combinations.
And so it was that young Sherlock suffered through his mother’s afternoon serenades.  It’s true that some childhood memories bury themselves straight into the Mind Palace’s hard drive, resisting all attempts at deletion.  The best Sherlock has managed is to store the music file full of showtunes - from
“You met Janine,” Sherlock supplies, “and it was love at first sight. How did you meet? Hmm. You’d been with John for what, six months by then, and he’d just proposed…” He narrows his eyes. “Janine had come into the surgery with a trivial complaint of some kind...something you fixed in your sexual health clinic...some sort of minor gynaecological trouble…?” He wrinkles  his forehead thoughtfully. “Female transport isn’t really my area…”
Inside the chapel, a man and a woman stand at the altar, their hands clasped. The man is smiling. He is wearing a smart grey suit with tails. Somehow, he looks more radiant than the bride, but that may be a trick of the lighting. He is John Watson. The woman is just as short as the man whose hands she’s clasping. Her lace dress is beautiful, her blonde hair artistically styled with flowers. She looks tearful, but very happy. She is Mary Morstan. The chapel is not entirely full of guests, but there are a number of people gathered to see this couple wed. It is a joyful occasion for everyone.
He really was (much to his older brother’s amusement - the bastard) shocked to discover that time really does wait for no man, not even for the great Sherlock Holmes.
“You are interesting, Mary Morstan, I’ll give you that, even though there’s still something off about you that gives me pause.  And I know you love John and would do everything in your power to ensure your future together.  So trust me when I say this is nothing personal.”
Mary, who has been staring at the floor, looks up at John with tears in her big blue eyes.  Sherlock deduces like mad.  What’s off?  What’s off?  Yes, she has secrets.  Big secrets.  But a pregnancy, and an affair?  How could he have missed it?
The groom’s mouth is smiling, but his eyes are darting everywhere, like he’s lost something he badly needs, or maybe like he isn’t sure exactly why he’s where he is, and has to keep checking.  He wears a smart grey morning suit,complete with tails.  Somehow, he looks more radiant than his intended, but that may just be a trick of the light.  He is John Watson.
Mary is not in shock. She is incandescent with rage. “John!” she yells, “For goodness sake! What does he mean, it should have been him? Are you going to stand there and let this...this...socially retarded drama queen ruin my wedding? He should have done us all a favour and bloody well stayed dead properly when he killed himself!”
The congregation rises as one, and Sherlock clicks his fingers. Dark-lensed glasses, as might be supplied at a 3D cinema screening, appear like magic on everyone’s faces.
The movie theatre was actually John’s idea.  Sherlock had very little use for something as tedious as watching film in an actual cinema, but he found the distance from his memories, being able to play them, take a step back and observing from a distance, frequently helpful in solving crimes.  So he built a reproduction of the Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, complete with decorative plasterwork, plush velvet seats, and thick, heavy curtains.
John and I returned earlier this afternoon after recovering the piece. Because I was feeling generous on my wedding day, I suggested that the gallery not press charges but instead require that the perpetrator make a generous donation to a charity of the gallery’s choice. Gay Switchboard should expect a substantial donation soon.   (Don’t worry -- John will likely write up all the details later.)
According to John, Mary had always believed that Sherlock had approached the Morstan-Watson wedding as a man who wanted nothing more than to get it over with, displacing his great trepidation and fear with the fervour of preparations.  Sherlock had never doubted her ability to see right through him.  She really was very clever.
I am certain that a few pictures of the event will surface online.  If I appear to be leaking about the eyes, be assured that there was a dreadful wind and that I could scarcely see because of it.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter open.  It was very dark and rather cool.  John stands before him, tapping him gently on the arm.
John walks to the altar, just as Mary did, only half an hour before. Sherlock is waiting, just as he was, head bowed, as if in prayer.
, not his and John’s.  John says that acceptance, too, will come with time.  For now, Abigail calls him “Sherlock” and they like microscopes and mud and reading.  She’s even taken up the violin, and while she’s not a prodigy, Sherlock believes that she shows developing skill for someone her age.  John’s daughter will never live at Baker Street -- when the truth is told, neither John nor Sherlock wants to be a full-time father -- but John’s old room has been designated as hers for when she occasionally sleeps over.  Molly enjoys babysitting, and indeed Mary dropped Abigail off with Molly that morning.  The relationship between them may well be cordial, but she doesn’t want to attend the wedding of her former husband on the day he marries his best friend.  (Sherlock does not blame her.  He does not want to particularly see her during the ceremony, either).
“I’m glad I’m a witness,” she says, licking her lower lip exactly the way her father does.  “It’s like proof.  Evidence.  Right?”
Next to Sherlock Holmes  is Archie, aged 8.  His face has mischief written all over it. He is the first child Sherlock has met in a long time to have anything resembling a brain in his head, but at the moment, the child’s rocking, fidgeting, and inability to stand completely still are making Sherlock feel even more woozy.
Classic images of Sherlock and John appear above the altar: John handing Sherlock his phone the very first time they met (the congregation says “aah”); John snatching cigarettes away from Sherlock (they cheer); John confronting Moriarty at the pool (a chorus of “boo”); John staring up at Sherlock on the roof just before he jumps (a few sobs); John at Sherlock’s grave, trying to be brave (everyone cries).
Inside the chapel, a man and a woman stand at the altar, their hands clasped.  The man is smiling.  He is wearing a smart grey suit with tails.  Somehow, he looks more radiant than the bride, but that may be a trick of the light.  He is John Watson. The woman is just as short as the man whose hands she’s clasping.  She is not what anyone would call classically beautiful, but she definitely has the glow of a woman very much in love.  Her lace dress is beautiful, her blonde hair artistically styled with flowers.  She looks tearful, but very happy.  She is Mary Morstan.  The chapel is not entirely full of guests, but there are a number of people gathered to see this couple wed.

.  Soon your body will lose its combat-readiness, turn flabby and be fit for nothing but lawn-mowing, IKEA, and missionary position sex.”
Sherlock ruffles his hair free of its expensively-pomaded prison and drapes himself dramatically over the altar.
Mycroft invites Molly to read some poetry by Kahlil Gibran.  This is not Sherlock’s idea, but John likes poetry and thought that it would do in place of some traditional diatribe about love and commitment.  John holds Sherlock’s hands throughout.  He steadily maintains eye contact, though he occasionally looks at his daughter, who waves at him, and smiles.  He sniffs, wrinkling his nose that Sherlock finds endearing, and licks his lips.  The muscles that control his eyebrows are particularly active today, lifting and twitching and making John look like John.
They stand for a moment in awkward silence before nodding at one another in an unspoken acknowledgement of brotherly affection.
Sherlock observes Mary, who is now sitting on the step of the altar, her face in her hands.  He cannot decide if she feels guilty for her actions or if she is just upset about getting caught.  She’s still hiding something, though Sherlock cannot pinpoint what it is.  Lestrade sends David packing and Molly and her date have taken to arguing.  A few stragglers are hanging about, probably wondering if there will still be cake (it’s vanilla cream with raspberry filling and is utterly delicious).
The bride and groom are preparing to say their vows, and the vicar is raising his hands to conduct one of the traditional elements of a wedding.
“John, I cannot condone this marriage because it will take you away from me, a thought I find absolutely intolerable.  Since I have returned from our time apart, I have realised that you are truly the only thing of value in my life.  You have taught me lessons where others have failed.  Because of you, I have learned patience.   Kindness.  Friendship.  Loyalty.  Honesty.”
John wanted to get married quickly and without much hullaballoo.  He did, however, decide to go out the night before with Lestrade, who was still pissed off that he wasn’t invited to John’s first stag night, and insisted he deserved a proper night out with his mates after the total cock-up of Sherlock’s meticulously-planned evening of debauchery.  (Sherlock maintains that had they not been interrupted, that evening would have ended very differently, and that first ill-fated marriage would not have happened at all.  John does not disagree).
John considers. He thinks of all the times Sherlock’s forgotten all about him, and only remembered again when he needs something. Tea, for example. Or an urgent email that needs sending. Is their love life going to be similar? He imagines Sherlock distracting himself, mid kiss, because he wants John to fetch the laptop. Or even worse, Sherlock getting disgruntled when John insists he can’t send texts whilst having sex. Or talk to Lestrade.
All Sherlock can think about is standing behind John at that ill-fated wedding seven years ago, when he so badly wanted to interrupt, stop time, reverse the clock, confess his love.  Part of him is still there, standing on the altar with John and Mary, mouthing along John’s vows in case he should forget them.  He remembers the flowers and the music and the tedious folding of napkins.  Sherlock was so thankful not to have had to seen John’s face as he said his vows, but Mary’s served as a mirror, reflecting joy and contentment (hateful).  Sherlock had stood there, trying his best to be
“Can you promise me that your marriage to the Work has irretrievably broken down and that you’ve come to an agreement about custody of the Cases?” he challenges.
“Pardon?” splutters the vicar, fake accent abandoned, microphone drooping in his hand like a limp, greasy penis. He is clearly unsure what to do next, and raises his eyes heavenward, as if seeking divine inspiration, or perhaps willing Archie to resume the music and give people a distraction.
Sherlock’s eyes widen.  So do John’s.  So do everyone’s in the audience.  Mary turns white, then blushes furiously.
John keeps his back to his best friend and his eyes down.  He’s still holding Mary’s hands, but he’s silent.
As the wedding grew closer, Sherlock struggled to pen the best man’s speech, realising he was writing a confession.  If he couldn’t have John, he would do everything in his power to make the man happy.  Sherlock owed it to John.  He would make a vow, the only vow he thought he would ever make. One to John, and, subsequently, the woman he had chosen to marry.  He would do his best to finally tell John how important he was, how elemental, how necessary to living.
“I promise to be gentle,” Sherlock replied, smirking against John’s neck as he wrapped his arms around John’s torso from behind. John flipped the page once more and stopped, running his hands over an amazing black and grey bundle of chrysanthemums.
“The alcohol in the fridge, too.” Sherlock murmured from his spot in his chair, and John realized that Sherlock was crying. “Take it all.” He sounded exhausted.
John tried to swallow past the cotton feel of his tongue. “Wait, Sherlock’s high? I thought he was sober…”
"You can all fuck off," Sherlock hung up the phone and set it onto the bar, cradling the bottle in his hand. The bartender gave him a pitiful look. Sherlock returned it with a glare.
“Well, can I at least return the favor?” John followed, watching Sherlock plop down onto the couch again and pick up his mug.
"Why is everyone so fucking concerned about my eye? Just give me the fucking smack, Seb, come on - "
"I'm fine," Sherlock told him, lighting a cigarette and going into the kitchen. John followed him, looking awkward.
Sherlock stood, swayed for a moment, and then darted to the bathroom, pushing the lid open just in time to vomit into the toilet bowl. He wretched again, coughing, then collapsed against the bathroom wall, flushing the toilet in defeat.
“You didn’t want it,” Sherlock mumbled into his pillow. “And I was scared if I told you I might, you wouldn’t want me.”
“Alright,” she said again, standing slowly and pulling off the gloves. “Give me a few minutes, and then we’ll get started.” She disappeared from the room.
"I fell and hit my eye on a table corner," Sherlock muttered, standing and going into the kitchen. He extracted an ice pack from the freezer, pressing it to his bruised eye.
"It's not the end of the world," she told him. "We'll get you started on a cocktail of meds, yeah? Look at your t-cell levels. This isn't a death sentence, Sherlock."
“Three times,” Sherlock nodded, crossing his legs beneath him. “The first time was when I was twelve, then again when I was fifteen, and again when I was seventeen. Mycroft took care of it each time.”
The withdrawals didn’t really start until they were both in bed. John was asleep, practically fused to the mattress, when he was woken up by a hard thrashing next to him. Jerking awake, he saw with a panic that the thrashing was Sherlock, who’s eyes had rolled to the back of his head and who’s body was rigid; forcing himself into doctor mode, John pushed Sherlock onto his side and shoved a pillow underneath Sherlock’s head, fumbling for his phone’s timer. Anything over five minutes -
He expected Sherlock to pull away, moaning the latter’s name loudly when Sherlock swallowed instead. He slumped back into his seat, spent, panting for breath. Sherlock tucked John back into his jeans and stood again, looking smug and satisfied as he turned towards the couch.
With a groan, he sat himself up and pulled his smartphone off its charger, wondering who in the hell could be calling this late. Or was it early?
“Drove our car into the tree when I was an infant,” Sherlock explained, his voice flat and emotionless. “She died, I didn’t.”
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, his nostrils flaring as he stared at John, as if realising he was there for the first time that night. “Of course not,” he sighed, then paused. “Maybe.”
Both Mycroft and John wanted to argue, but when Molly crossed her arms and gave them a stern look, they conceded, leaving the room together. It was only then that Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose, tears making their way down his sunken cheeks.
"Urine sample it is, then," Mycroft said eventually. Molly gave Sherlock an apologetic look, producing a specimen cup from a drawer. Sherlock sniffed hard as he picked it up, moving towards the door.
“Have an idea of where you want to get it?” Sherlock asked after a few minutes, not looking up from the task at hand.
"You're pushing away your problems, Sherlock. Drinking and using and staying with your shitty boyfriend isn't helping anything, now is it? Neither is pushing away John."
"Any cases?" John asked him as they sat down. Sherlock had been helping Lestrade out with tough cases lately, something Sherlock enjoyed immensely. Sherlock shook his head as he turned on the television. They dug in.
Sherlock took a moment to stare down at his arms, a twinge of desire running through him at the sight of the fading track marks. His last hit seemed like forever ago. Pushing the thought from his mind, Sherlock finished cleaning himself up and then rejoined John in the kitchen, where fresh breakfast was waiting as promised.
“I’ll be waiting for you two. I’ll see you when you get here.” He hung up. A few minutes later, he heard a car pull up outside of their Baker Street flat; the door opened, and he could hear Sherlock moving clunkily up the stairs, his footsteps uneven as Lestrade assisted him.
“Cocaine, Costwald’s whisky, heroin, speedballs, morphine, vodka, ecstasy, marijuana.” He read off, then looked up at Sherlock. “Jesus, you’ve taken all of this?”
Molly looked at him sadly. "That's not true, Sherlock. Plenty of people live with HIV, they take their meds and they have healthy, happy lives - "
Sherlock turned the water to the hottest it would go and let the water run over him, his curls clinging to his face as he thought about what had just happened. The kissing, and the sex part of it all - why was John doing this? Suddenly giving Sherlock what he wanted - and why had he said that marrying Mary was a mistake? Was Sherlock a homewrecker? He didn't want to be, even if his feelings for John insisted otherwise.
He paced the waiting room anxiously, keeping his hands shoved in his pocket to stop them from shaking. How much longer until Mycroft was going to arrive?
When he finally returned to the flat, it was to find John in the kitchen cooking, some soft jazz playing on the radio. Sherlock stepped into the kitchen carefully, the space now unfamiliar; he leaned against the doorjamb and watched John for a moment, smiling despite himself.
"Yeah, I did," he looked away again. He knew she could probably see right through it, but she said nothing more.
"I'm always a bit...off, after each...procedure," Sherlock said quietly, his face buried in John's neck. He swayed a bit on the spot. "It's a lot of pressure on the body."
“You are what you suck,” Sherlock replied in a low voice, taking a draw off his cigarette. John reached out and grabbed his other hand. Sherlock glanced at him in surprise.
Twenty minutes later, John was locking the flower shop’s front door with the ancient, silver key when he heard somebody wolf whistle behind him. His cheeks once again bright red, he swallowed audibly and turned to face his cat-caller. He was unsurprised when it turned out to be the new kid at the tattoo shop, smirking lips wrapped around a cigarette. The teen’s black jeans were torn with holes, and the ratty band tee he wore - some American band John had only vaguely heard of - had the sleeves cut off and hung like drapes on the teen’s skinny frame. John sighed as he approached him.
"Cramps," Sherlock muttered, still not looking up from the laptop. John set the Tesco bag onto the desk, taking a peek at the screen. Sherlock was still looking at potential honeymoon spots.
“You didn’t know?” Mycroft arched his eyebrows at John. John shook his head, running his hand over his mouth as he began to pace.
"Of course I do," John took Sherlock's free hand in his own. "I want to marry you now more than ever, Sherlock. If you want to."
Sherlock mentally kicked himself. He was really spilling his life story to this man he had just met not even a day ago.
“What did she mean,” John asked, staring at Sherlock. “This isn’t your first time? You’ve been here before?”
“Are you sure you don’t mind sharing your bedroom?” John asked for the upteenth time, to which Sherlock rolled his eyes in reply.
"You don't want to make things worse for him, do you, Johnny boy?" the man was snarling now. "Then get the hell out of this flat."
"Must be rough," James murmured, watching him. Sherlock shrugged, discarding the empty syringe and straddling James once more.
“I drew that piece for my mum,” Sherlock said quietly, his eyes glinting almost mischievously. “Get it? Mum, mums. I tattooed it onto myself after I drew it.”
Stepping into the bathroom, he flipped the light on and turned on the tap, splashing cold water on his face. Patting it dry with a hand towel, he made his way into the living room and searched for his shoes.
A bit short, Sherlock and John have intimate relations for the first time. Featuring John being a good boyfriend : >
"Yeah," Sherlock nodded, watching them both walk towards the door of the flat. “I’ll see you guys later.”
Sherlock shrugged. “My brain works faster than normal, for some reason. My brother has the same skill.”
"Are you okay?" John asked him after a few moments of silence. Sherlock nodded mutely, not looking at him. John couldn't help the gnawing feeling of worry in his chest; this was so unlike the Sherlock he knew from even just a few months ago.
"Losing his use to me," James smirked. "Getting older, getting sicker. Not as attractive as he used to be, not bringing in so many customers."
If Sherlock thought giving a best man's speech was hard, how will he handle his own wedding ceremony?
If this scene were a drama, John would calmly take Sherlock by the shoulders and firmly tell him that he’s got it all wrong, and that the great detective has simply misinterpreted all the physical and verbal cues.  He is, after all, a sociopath.  It’s okay, though, they can still be friends, but can you please take him back to that nice rehab clinic for help, please, Lestrade?  He’s ruining my wedding, poor deluded sod.
There is a collective gasp from the congregation, then a muttered conversation between the bride and her chief bridesmaid, in which the phrases “narcissist”; and “attention-seeking twat” can be heard. The groom, meanwhile, says not a word and moves not an inch.
“What’s so hard to believe about that?”  Mary’s shouts.  “Loving two people?”  Tears fall down her cheeks.  “You, of all people should know!”  She looks at Sherlock pointedly.  His stomach is immediately in knots.  This has suddenly taken an incredibly awkward turn.  “I’ve always had to share you!,” she continues.  “Always!  You were in love with a ghost when I met you.  And you still are.”
“Oh!” he trills, all aflutter. “Oh? Well yes--it would appear you are now married? But it won’t really count. I mean, it should, of course it should...but the boss says no.”
The day of their wedding is breezy and chilly when the sun ducks behind the clouds, but at least the rain’s held off. They’ve opted for a very informal, late-afternoon wedding in Regent’s Park;  Mycroft had little problem having Queen Mary’s Gardens designated as an official wedding venue.
The poetry portion of the ceremony dispensed with, Sherlock’s father helps Abigail with her violin.  She stays to the right of her father, takes a deep breath, nods at Sherlock, and begins playing.  The fingers of Sherlock’s left hand move on John’s hand; he wrote the piece, after all.  John has lived with him long enough to recognize an original Holmes composition, and he looks fondly at his daughter and then up at his companion.  “It’s beautiful,” he whispers, even as Abigail bows a G rather flat.  She gives a little curtsey when she’s done, eliciting a little amused clap from the audience, before giving her father and Sherlock a joint hug and returning to her spot next to her grandparents-to-be.
To the right of the bride stands an attractive young woman with dark hair. She is sniffing back happy tears. She is Janine. Faces of friends smile from the audience: Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade, first name unimportant.
John is quickly going into battle mode.  Sherlock loves to watch the stages of John’s Righteous Anger.  He’s bypassed stage one completely (breathing through his nose) and moved right on to stage two (the eyes of murder).  “Yes, please,” he says.  “If you’re going to interrupt my wedding you’d better have a damn good reason and I certainly want to hear it.”
In fact, the audience has disappeared.  The bridesmaids dissolve into the air.  Mary fades into nothingness.
Sherlock had for John finally aligned, like some rare planetary event, and he knew the truth of his existence: he loved John Watson, loved him so desperately, and that any opportunity they had to become lovers had passed.
“Ooh, that’s that sculpture of Conchita Wurst dressed like Jesus,” supplies Wiggins, who’d spent a rainy Eurovision night round at Mrs Hudson’s, and had followed the victorious Austrian’s career ever since. “Made out of diamonds, worth a bloody bomb.”
‘Yes, John, I promise. I still love the Work, but The Cases will stay in the Mind Palace during moments of intimacy. From now on, John Watson, you will always come first.’
Sherlock observes the ground.  He may have.  “Sorry,” he mutters, although he knows that his occasional indulgences don’t bother his lover as much as they used to.  Trivial, really, after all they’ve been through.
Late spring.  A church.  The exact location of the church is irrelevant, although it is the chapel of St. Mary Magdelene’s in Bristol.  It’s a beautiful day.  The gardens are lush and verdant, ivy clings to weathered stone walls, and the lilacs are in full bloom.  It’s a perfect day for a wedding, and, indeed, a wedding is taking place inside.
“Sherlock thinks Mary really loves Janine, and is only marrying John to take advantage of his credit rating,” Molly replies earnestly.
A constable walks his beat through the park.  He doesn’t even bother with the two of them any more.  No lock or fence would deter Sherlock, anyway.  “Don’t get rid of it,” says John when they are alone again.  “Tell me about it one day.  When we’re old and you’ve pissed me off.”
relationships.  No one had ever held his interest like John did, and somewhere in there, Sherlock was absolutely terrified that if one day their hands were to join just so or their mouths finally meet, the equilibrium he’d finally reached would be once again destroyed.  Not worth the risk.  He was content to carry on indefinitely and probably would, had a certain set of events not sent him off on a dangerous mission to keep the only person he cared deeply about from harm.
Too sick to care about the mess he’s made, Sherlock lies down on the floor.  Perhaps poisoning himself was a bad idea after all.  He’s sweating profusely and shaking, and he’s going to need the toilet soon.  John kneels down, completely unconcerned with the state of his suit, and brushes Sherlock’s hair from his forehead.
Sherlock is looking at John with big, sad eyes.  “I’m sorry,” he manages between bouts of vomiting, “I’m so sorry.”
John sniffs, then swallows.  He licks his lips.  His hands are clasped behind his back, jaw tight and head lifted.  But his eyes -- even those in the back of the audience can see those eyes, softened now, shining with moisture.  His heart is on display: here is a man torn in two, and everyone in the audience knows it, knows where Sherlock is heading next.  No one seems to know better than Mary, who sinks down onto the steps and wraps her arms around herself.  Sherlock feels for her, he really does, but he’s lost John once and if he stops now, he will hate himself forever.  He takes a long, shaky breath, and meets John’s eyes.  He nearly can’t finish under the intensity of it.  John’s emoting so many things at once Sherlock can’t distinguish exactly what the man is thinking.  But there’s no stopping now.
Sherlock smirks as John enters the next stage of RA: the nose pinch, which he holds only briefly before flexing his hand.  “Mary,” he says, quietly, “I think you’d better say something.  Right now.  Because this man is making implications that I really, really don’t like.”
Mrs Hudson and Molly shake hands, then get the other members of the congregation to do the same. Mr Chatterjee produces a bottle of Bollinger from under his pew, Major Sholto slashes away the cork with a swish of his regimental sword; Mrs Hudson’s voluminous handbag disgorges an ice-bucket; Lestrade hands out glasses; Angelo pours; and Molly shares out a family-sized packet of Quavers. Soon the guests are dancing and chatting like the reception has already started, leaving the wedding party to sort themselves out centre stage.
, naturally) with water, then very carefully introduced the virulent cocktail: two drops.  No, three.  Just in case.
Plus, argued John, dancing was only likely to give him a massive stiffy and if there was one thing Mycroft
“Unless someone is in grave danger, it’s not the right time.” His voice is still light.  Sherlock does shit like this.  It’s not entirely unexpected.
.  The day he met David, Sherlock had worked out that he and Mary engaged in intercourse more than once, but that it had meant something much more to him than it had to her.  He frightened David off and made a point
Studying his father is interesting.  Sherlock’s always identified more with his mother, shares her eye colour and her wit.  In his youth, Sherlock found his father incredibly boring and painfully normal, with his cardigans and his gardening and dog-walking.  It wasn’t until a few years ago that he saw the two of them, his father and John, engaged in conversation about something undoubtedly pointless, that he realized how similar the two of them were.  Would John still be there by his side, years from now, wedding ring bright on the wrinkled skin of his small hands, hands that would likely once again grasp a cane?  Would they still be here into old age, Sherlock nattering on about some experiment while John contemplated shapes in the clouds?  Or would John die early, as his own mother and father both did, and leave Sherlock sitting on the bench in Regent’s Park alone, fiddling with the latest technology with arthritic fingers?
“Lestrade go easy on you, then?”  John smells of the pub, but Sherlock doesn’t mind.  He reeks of tobacco himself.
“No...well...OK, yes,” she admits. “It was obvious from the start that you loved Sherlock, dead or alive. You didn’t admit it to yourself. I knew you’d never have looked twice at me if he’d still been around. But you thought he was dead, and there I was. Right place, right time. I did like you, I still do. And then…”
They leave, and soon Angelo brings out a wedding cake.  John had suggested Angelo’s signature tiramisu but Sherlock’s mother’s neighbour (and owner of the village bakery) insisted she do the honours.  Sherlock acquiesced, if only because her confections are so delicious they could bring about world peace.  (They did in fact bring peace to the Holmes household on more than one occasion, and that’s close enough).   Mycroft announces it’s time to cut the cake (fitting, thinks Sherlock) and people begin to gather at the back of the restaurant where there’s a buffet table set up for this type of thing.  They slice the traditional three tiers together, with a knife that looks like it belongs in an Indiana Jones film and most certainly didn’t come from the kitchen.  People return to their tables with a slice each and are served coffee and tea.
Next to Sherlock Holmes is Archie, aged 8, who looks about as interested in the proceedings as Sherlock does.
Just then the door to the church opens yet again, and in taps Mycroft, like a slightly less dapper Fred Astaire, should Fred Astaire ever be reincarnated as the British Government. He twirls the umbrella expertly, then patters up the aisle, shuffling between pews until he reaches the priest. He beckons with one elegant fingernail, produces an official-looking notebook, and they begin a whispered conversation.
Abigail wrinkles her nose, shrugs, and then remembers to say thank you.  For as much as she enjoys the designer outfits, beauty doesn’t mean much to her (for now), for which Sherlock is fiercely thankful.  He can deduce a few things about her personality even at her young age: she’s very clever, has a charming sense of humour, and will give John and Mary (John and him, he corrects) a hell of a time when she’s in her teens.  She’s already asked to go clay pigeon shooting with Mary (is that what the assassin calls target practice these days?).  Even though she can be precocious, she’s also highly empathic and is prone to bouts of quiet introspection.  She’s very much John’s daughter, despite her resemblance to her mother.  Sherlock loves her as much as he can love a child, and he’s accepted that she is part  his life now.  If being with John means learning to become a good father, it’s a price he’ll willingly pay.
For a long, long moment, all that can be heard is the ticking of the vicar’s watch, then the clomp-clomp-clomp of the drum machine cranking back up. But hang on. Is it...could it be... the sound of expensively shod footsteps on a well-tended asphalt path? It could.
The bride and groom smile at one another.  John waggles his eyebrows.  Mary laughs.  The audience giggles a little bit.  No one ever says anything.
Molly arrives next with Abigail, who is carrying her tiny violin case.  She’s dressed in an ensemble that fits her personality perfectly.  She’s not wearing some gaudy bridesmaid’s frock, but patterned trousers with frills at the bottom, a little cable-knit cardigan and a navy-blue beret, purchased by the detective himself.  That Sherlock should be interested in a young girl’s wardrobe given to his aversion to anything dealing with or made for anyone under eighteen makes John shake his head and click his tongue.  Nevertheless, Sherlock insists on buying clothes for the girl he’s come to love and accept as his stepdaughter.  If anyone asks, Sherlock says he’s saving Abigail from her mother’s poor fashion choices.  Abigail herself enjoys a trip to the shops with Sherlock, and John simply shakes his head and lets them go.
Then Mycroft is back.  It’s time for the vows.  His brother says some official sounding things, but Sherlock barely hears it.  He’s staring at John and trying very hard not to get emotional.
“Ask Molly, how it grieved me to leave you.  Ask Mrs. Hudson, who has graciously put up with me the past few weeks as I’ve caused more damage to our flat --
“Mr. Broad!” shouts Sherlock, winding his scarf around his neck, “we’ll take the case.  Come, husband.”  He offers his arm, which John glances at dubiously.  Sherlock gives him a withering look.  “Oh, just this once,” he says softly.  John studies him; Sherlock pouts a bit -- can’t John see that he is being completely genuine?  Oh, right.  He is still Sherlock Holmes.  He will still race ahead, and John?  John will still follow.  But tonight, no.  Tonight Sherlock wants John to know just how much he really means.  John
Next to Sherlock Holmes is Archie, aged 8. His face has mischief written all over it. He is the first child Sherlock has met in a long time to have anything resembling a brain in his head. Sherlock likes him.
In the evening, he’d forced himself to eat again, this time chicken vindaloo with garlic naan.  That meal got the special treatment, too.  He’s really not feeling well by the next morning, but he suffers through a Full English from Speedy’s.
“What?  I’m actually hungry.”  The corners of Sherlock’s mouth curve down the way they do when he smiles sideways at John, the smile that’s only for him.
Everyone seems to be moving. Everyone, except Sherlock, who stands still as chaos spreads around him. The frown that was once upon his lips, however, has changed. He wouldn’t be exactly smiling, but if you know what to look for, you’d see a man rather pleased with himself. He holds his hand out. Reaching behind his back, Archie’s small hand meets Sherlock’s large one in a sly but satisfying high-five.
The next twenty minutes or so are rather a blur.  People arrive: Wiggins, who has scrubbed up remarkably well except for his red Converse.  A few of John’s colleagues and his cousin Jane, with Archie, who is now nearly sixteen and still thinks Sherlock is the epitome of cool.  Harry doesn’t make it, but in a way, Sherlock is relieved that John doesn’t have to be concerned about her - it’s their day, and Sherlock does not want anything but John’s happiness.
Someone starts clinking a fork against a glass; within moments the small restaurant rings with the noise.  Sherlock swoops in and kisses John soundly to the backdrop of whistles and cheers.
John actually laughs at this, a cross between a derisive snort and a hiccup.  He must know it’s true, that Mary--like any woman--wouldn’t want him running off with Sherlock at all hours, doing something stupid, reckless, and dangerous.
“You are the only person I could possibly marry,” he continues.  “No one else would have the patience or kindness to be my friend, let alone my spouse.  I owe you a profound debt simply for allowing me to share your life with you.  I want to grow old with you, I want to…
John stands as if ready for battle, eyes on his bride, but body angling itself ever forward, towards his best man.
This last word he chokes on a bit.  They’ve lied to themselves for so long.  No more untruths.  Sherlock turns now to John, who stands still as a statue.  He has dropped Mary’s hands and his left hand is trembling.  HIs eyes are shut.
People mingle; the marriage certificate is issued.  Everyone congratulates them and there is hugging.  Sherlock finds he doesn’t mind, even when he notices a group of girls on the outskirts of the gardens with their phones.  They’ve been discovered, then.  He gives them a little wave, eliciting a few shrill screams of delight.  John can deal with the fans on the blog.  They’d just calmed down from his simple confirmation (Yeah, if you’ve seen us out together lately, it’s what you think it is) of their relationship a year ago, too.  Clients still arrived in a steady stream and someone finally collected a long-standing office bet at Scotland Yard.
“And, what, precisely, is the reason for your objection?” offers the priest, voice uncertain and a little squeaky--he’s not sure this was even in the script.
The whole wedding has disintegrated.  It’s a spectacular scandal.  The kind of thing that usually makes Sherlock look down his nose at the stupidity of sentiment.  If it were happening to anyone else, he’d be rolling his eyes or laughing.
Mary’s eyebrows draw together, and her hand flies to her head. Indeed, there’s a spider. A rather large spider. In fact, Sherlock knows, there are four of them - it never hurts to be prepared. A spindly arachnid that is certainly not native to the UK (Sherlock called in a favour from a former client who happened to work at the B.U.G.S. exhibition at London Zoo to get the buggers -- large but relatively harmless Australian hunstman spiders) works its way out of the folds of lace and runs across Mary’s collarbone. .
Late spring.  A church.  The exact location of the church is irrelevant, although it is the chapel of St. Mary Magdelene’s in Bristol.  It’s pissing down. The gardens are dripping, sodden ivy clings to weathered stone walls, and the lilacs are bowing their wet heads.  It’s a lousy day for a wedding, but a wedding is taking place inside, where the people -- most of them at any rate -- are dry and warm and generally happy.
The girl, blonde and petite, lets go of Molly’s hand and hugs Sherlock around his thighs.  He squats down to see her better, being careful not to wrinkle his trousers too badly.  “Happy wedding day,” she says.  Sherlock tucks a strand of hair behind her ear and straightens her beret.
“You’ve been out with Father.” Mycroft stated. Sherlock’s gaze flickered up to him and then down again. He looked away. John stared.
"Burnt the eggs," he managed, to which John chuckled and turned away. Sherlock straightened, knees still a little weak, feeling the come cool in his pants. He flushed, clearing his throat.
The pacing of John's thrusting quickened, fingers tangled in Sherlock's curls, the two making occasional eye contact as Sherlock worked magic with his tongue.
“Well, I’m a med student, first and foremost. My um, my mum and dad got divorced, and my sister Harry, she’s - she’s an alcoholic. And uh, my dad, well - he was an abusive piece of shit, but he died, and - and now it’s just my mom and Harry and I.”
He tugged his hood down further over his face, turning and striding away before John could stop him. Next stop: Westminster.
"John," Sherlock mumbled, returning John's hungry kisses with his own, arching when John began to trail kisses down Sherlock's body, stopping to suck along Sherlock's nipple.
"Easy there love," James chuckled, tugging on Sherlock's hair to pull Sherlock's head back from where he had it in the crook of James' neck, sucking. Sherlock gave a low whine, tilting forward.
"Sherlock, Sherlock - " John didn't bother to keep his voice down as he shouted Sherlock's name, sure that the concrete room was soundproof. "Sherlock, it's me, it's John."
"Say it, Sherlock." John nipped at Sherlock's earlobe. Sherlock flushed red again, his hips matching the rhythm of John's fingers.
They grabbed a table. Sherlock sighed. "There's nothing to talk about, Molly. You're insinuating things without knowing if they're true."
“First thing’s first,” Lestrade reemerged from the bathroom, putting his phone into his pocket. “I just called the drug squad to come confiscate all of this. That’s the first step.”
They giggled together for a moment before falling into silence, laying together comfortably. Sherlock took a drag off his cigarette.
"Sex holiday," Sherlock told him stubbornly, turning his attention back to the laptop screen. "We're a normal couple, John, normal couples go on sex holidays after they get married."
"Results are back," she muttered uselessly, avoiding Sherlock's gaze and instead speaking to John. "Cocain, heroin, ecstacy and - "
"He won't be a problem much longer," Sherlock assured him, smacking the inside of his arm and looking for a vein. James let out a chuckle.
“Ignore her,” Sherlock said in an undertone, setting up the ink before he slowly and carefully pressed the design to Victor’s arm. It was a large, intricate dragon, its slender body winding around Victor’s bicep.
On the side of the tub - which was abnormally wide - was a cloth, a spoon, a lighter, and a bundle of needles. On the counter was a razor blade and a large piece of glass, dusted with a powder residue. Several pill bottles lined the back of the counter and the back of the toilet and window sill, most of them filled with pills, some of them stuffed with powder-filled baggies. Beer and whiskey bottles littered the floor. A bong stood next to the tub.
Mycroft gave him a look. Sherlock, cheeks flushed, gave a tiny huff and stomped off to a corner of the room, unzipping his jeans and noticing out of the corner of his eye John staring pointedly at the ceiling. A minute or so later he zipped himself up again, capped the specimen cup and gave it to Molly before he went over to the sink to wash his hands.
My dearest John - Gone to work. You can meet me for lunch around two pm if you’d like. If not, I’ll be home around eight. Miss you always, SH.
“Work?” John repeated, reaching out and grabbing Sherlock by the hand. “No, you can’t work. You just had two pretty big operations, you need to rest.”
“Drinking coffee,” Sherlock said innocently, his foot finally finding the treasure it was so desperately seeking. John bit back a soft gasp, hardening almost immediately under the pressure of Sherlock’s boot. Sherlock was smirking ever so slightly, his boot maneuvering gently and expertly. John squeezed his eyes shut.
"Speaking of that," Sherlock could feel John watching him as the former fixed his cup of coffee. "How long have you been doing it? The sex work?"
“John,” Sherlock said softly, meeting John’s eyes. “You know me better than anyone else, even in the few short days we’ve been friends. Can I trust you?”
"Exactly," Sherlock murmured, gasping softly when James bit into his neck. He rocked a bit, the friction of their cocks sliding together beneath the fabric of their clothes making his eyelids flutter.
They stepped into the deli, taking a seat at the booth near the window. John got a sandwich with crisps; Sherlock got only coffee.
Mycroft and John followed her through the waiting room to a private hospital room, closing the door behind them. Sherlock was asleep on the hospital bed, an oxygen mask strapped to his face, the covers pulled to his chest. His chest rose and fell with each labored breath; his eyelids fluttered as they both took a seat at his bedside. John couldn’t tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s stomach.
“Aw, I didn’t know it was bring your boyfriend to work day,” called one of the artists from her chair, smirking.
“Please, John. We just met two months ago, you’re a med student, and I’m - “ He stopped short, a lump in his throat.
"Congratulations," Lestrade told John. "Seriously, you're good for him. This is the happiest and the healthiest I've ever seen him."
“Not joking,” Sherlock smiled. “Never done by an actual Holmes, of course, my brother and the likes don’t like to get their hands dirty.”
And in strolls Sherlock, all charisma and cheekbones, sadly not clad in leather and suspenders, but still sex on legs in his morning suit, a longer, tighter version of John’s. He stands at the back of the church, glances contemptuously at the congregation, the bridesmaid, the bride, the vicar, and lastly (considerably less contemptuously) the groom, and says, quietly, “Me. I object.”
Sherlock’s been trying to change his pronouns when he speaks of her, from “your daughter” to “our daughter,” but the words get stuck.  Abigail looks so much like Mary that it is impossible to forget that she’s
David is struggling out of the pew and heading toward the altar.  “You can’t marry him,” he pleads.  “Please, Mary.  Just let me speak.”
“Can I still call you Sherlock?” she asks the detective as she gives him a goodbye hug.  “Or should I call you dad, too?”
The music swells as the sun comes up. We see a montage of classic John and Sherlock moments: John seeing 221B’s kitchen for the first time; John shooting the cabbie; John and Sherlock laughing in a cab; John at Baskerville; John and Sherlock in handcuffs; John at Sherlock’s grave; John punching Sherlock in the restaurant; John forgiving Sherlock over the tube train bomb; the stag night .
“But you know what?” she continues as Sherlock leads her to the pavillion.  “I don’t think you need evidence.  I mean, for you and dad.  It’s pretty obvious.”
Later that night, guest list and seating arrangements set, Sherlock took a bath, where he sulked and tried not to think about his impending misery.  He closed his eyes and plotted.  The water was cold by the time he opened his eyes.
They meet Mycroft, whose familiar minions are finalising preparations.  They are clearly enjoying themselves, too; one woman is securing a flower attachment over the arch of the marquee.  It looks nice.  Sherlock had reminded Mycroft that John insisted on keeping it simple.  And it is simple, but Mycroft’s version of simple is always elegant.
“I am but a rude and recalcitrant prick who has very few redeeming qualities aside from a high-functioning brain that occasionally saves the rest of the world from the incompetence of the justice system in order to counter the oppressive ennui of existence.  Yet, despite my many, many faults, you’ve chosen me as your best man.  I have tried to fulfil my obligations in regards to your nuptials, but I realise now that I should have taken up the position on the day I met you. For you, John, have always been
There is one awful moment where the church is deadly quiet.  Molly holds her hand over her mouth.  Lestrade is eyeing John dubiously.  It’s Mrs. Hudson who moves, slowly, from the front pew where she’s sitting as John’s honorary mother.  She spends a moment regarding the young man who interrupted before she turns her attention to Mary.  She spares a glance at Sherlock, who conveys with a small look that yes, yes indeed, Ms. Morstan did have a final goodbye - a mercy fuck, really - with David, and that yes, indeed, she’s with child, and that John may or may not be the father.  “How dare you.  Both of you,” she whispers with disgust, before turning and making her way down the aisle toward the door.
“Hmmm. ‘The case of the Angry Clown’,” supplies Sherlock.  Mary, John, and David all turn to him, incredulous.  “Sorry,” he shrugs.
“I don’t know why they always ask that at weddings,” mutters Mrs Hudson to Angelo. “No-one ever says anyth…”
“I object to your marriage!”  There.  It’s out.  Sherlock is looking at the back of John’s head.  His eyes are shining and he stands there without his usual haughty demeanor, as if he’s been stripped, peeled like a lobster, the shell torn away to reveal vulnerable flesh.
Sherlock had simply raised his eyebrows and agreed.  After all, he’d planned nearly every detail of John’s first wedding.  It was only fair to let John plan his second.  John approached it with military efficiency, right down to arranging a rickshaw ride for Mrs.  Hudson, whose hip now bothered her so much that she rarely walked anywhere farther than the corner shop.
attraction there, whether John denied it or not.  Sherlock was convinced that it would take so little to tip the scales, to push their friendship into the realm of romance.  At the time, though, the idea was terrifying.  Sherlock didn’t
Away from John, he forced himself to push those memories aside, but John burned like a small, stubborn candle at the back of his mind while he relied on his intellect to dismantle Moriarty’s network.  Somewhere along the line, he’d convinced himself that John would be right there, waiting for him to return.  John would continue being John, as he always had: John who wore bad jumpers, who made good tea, whose hands never shook around a gun.
John takes stock of the ruin of his wedding before marching directly out via the side entrance and into the gardens beyond.
Sherlock had decided the first 42 guests were horribly boring specimens of homo sapiens until he met David.  Ah, David, frequent commenter on Mary’s Facebook page.  Sender of random texts.  Shoulder to cry on.  Slight upward tilt of his eyebrows whenever Mary’s name was mentioned but a downward cast to his eyes at John’s name.  Nervous.  Ex-boyfriend then.  Still had feelings for Mary.  Utterly spineless.
Janine covers her own mouth and looks revolted.  Several guests run for towels, buckets, anything.  Sherlock is perhaps making a show of it, or perhaps he really is dying, but he retches loudly and can’t seem to stop.  He’s now kneeling on the altar, making a horrible mess.  If the painted cherubim could turn away, they would.
Although he prefers casualwear to tailored clothing, John looks perfectly comfortable in his three-piece suit.  He’s got a Watson tartan hanky tucked into the breast pocket, and Sherlock deduces that he’s wearing his silly blue and green polka-dot socks that for some reason he thinks are fashionable.  What’s under those flattering trousers Sherlock cannot guess, but he’s thinking about the hair on John’s calves when John finally meets him in the garden.
Sherlock kisses his mother and Molly, shakes the appropriate hands, slaps the appropriate backs.  “Stay and amuse yourselves and...do whatever people do at these things.”  The guests chuckle.
John smiles, and locks his big blue eyes on Sherlock’s. “Yes, Sherlock. I’ve been in denial. I’ve wanted to be with you from the first moment we met.”
Hello. As many of you may already know, John and are are now married, so you can stop haranguing him for his phone number or second-guessing his sexuality.  He wanted to be the one to type this up, but as he is currently indisposed, I believe that as his husband, I have the right to hack his blog at whim.  Granted, I did that anyway before I married him, but now I shall do so more frequently just because I can.
“Thought so.” A smirk found its way to John’s face, settling there triumphantly. “Yeah, I’ll stay. Do you want take-out, Sherlock?”
“I can’t,” John shook his head adamantly. “I’d faint, on the spot. As soon as the needle touched me I’d be out.”
Sherlock did as he was told, gasping loudly when he felt John's tongue at his entrance. He let out a soft whimper, cheeks going crimson. "John!"
"There are a lot of sickos in it for the power trip, kid. People who only want to buy you and fuck you because they can beat you and hurt you in the process, make themselves feel powerful. Moriarty included. Get away from him and stay away from him, alright?" Sebastian tossed Sherlock the package of smack.
"I did used to live here," John muttered nastily, watching as Sherlock went and stood behind the man. The man only smirked wider, turning and grabbing a fistful of Sherlock's curls.
“No, no,” Sherlock shook his head, his voice pitching an octave lower as John licked it again. “John,
Sherlock nearly choked on his tea, his entire face and even the tips of his ears going red. He spluttered.
"Merry Christmas," John told him, sitting up. He reached over to the bedside table, presenting Sherlock with a black velvet box. Sherlock sat up as well, taking it with a bit of surprise. He opened it to find a diamond ring.
Tugging on his pants and shoes, he stumbled his way to the bathroom, where he splashed cold water on his face to wake himself up before driving.
“The extra room upstairs,” Sherlock murmured as he sat the last box down in their bedroom. “You can use as an office for when you do homework and whatnot.”
He went to shut the door, but John was too quick; he stepped inside before Sherlock could shut him out. "Sherlock, we need to talk."
“I don’t want anything to happen to you,” Sherlock insisted, leaning down and kissing John softly. “Promise me.”
“Detective Inspector Lestrade down at Scotland Yard. Look, I don’t have a lot of time to talk, tonight’s been hectic. Sherlock’s here, drunk and high off his tits. Normally I would just stick him in a cell and let him sober up overnight, but I don’t have the space, time or patience to do that tonight. He kept telling me to call you. Any chance you could come pick him up?”
John frankly couldn't give a damn, but instead of arguing with his mother he took a seat in his chair and watched Sherlock from afar. It was easy to the sadness now lining his fiance's shoulders, making them hard and hunched. Sherlock stared out of the window as he played, his mind on his father. Lestrade came to stand beside him.
"Friends are on their way over," James murmured to him, not that Sherlock exactly heard him. He wondered for a moment what the drug had been laced with, as his eyelids drooped and he began to nod off into unconsciousness. Things went black quickly, gathering like a curtain after a theatre performance. When Sherlock woke up again, still high - fresh track marks indicative of being drugged continuously through his sleep - it was to find himself on the mattress in the flat's spare bedroom, alone and naked, covered in mysterious new bruises and sore. He sat up, breathing heavily, and called out James' name weakly. Nothing.
The entire parlor erupted into wolf whistles. Sherlock ducked out of one of the back rooms, looking abashedly at the floor as the wolf whistles followed him to the front of the parlor.
“Thanks!” The girl chirped as she slid out of his chair and towards the front counter to pay. Sherlock nodded to her once, turning his gaze to the window and catching the flower shop boy’s own soft brown stare. He tried to swallow past the sudden lump in his throat. The other man looked away suddenly, seeming - what? Scared? Disgusted?
"What?" Molly stared at him, shaken, as Sherlock set his bottle down and stood, striding over to the coat rack and pulling on his jacket.
“Don’t go,” came Sherlock’s voice softly from the bed. John turned to see Sherlock staring at him, eyes half-lidded. “Please stay.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Shut up, you fucker.” He took a long drink from his mug. “I could say the same about you.” He shifted his eyes discreetly towards Lestrade, who was scrolling on his phone in the kitchen. Mycroft scowled.
Sherlock scrabbled at his face, ripping the oxygen mask and throwing it off to the side in what seemed to be a sort of panicked frenzy. “Am I in hospital?”
John sighed quietly, taking residence in his chair and watching the two from afar as Sherlock’s quiet crying filled the room. It eventually faded, softening the room into a gentle silence.
Sherlock deepthroated him without warning, causing John to spasm a bit and the hand in Sherlock's hair to tug hard, eliciting a moan of surprise from Sherlock himself.
John shrugged and took a bite of his sandwich, looking Sherlock over as he chewed. Sherlock was staring absently at the table, apparently lost in thought.
Sherlock bit three nurses between intake and transferement to his own private room. When they wheeled the bed into the room, Sherlock curled up on his side, staring at the wall, silent and immobile. John stood outside the room with Lestrade, staring in occasionally; Mycroft sat at Sherlock's bedside, talking, hoping to get any sort of response from his little brother. After a few hours of this, Mycroft stood, joining them outside the room and shutting the door behind him. Anthea appeared, at the ready to receive orders.
He could hear John calling for him to come back - "come back so we can talk about this" - but Sherlock just made his way stumbling down the stairs, falling eventually face-first onto the couch, where he promptly began to snore, his brain like soft buzzing. When he woke up again, with no idea how much time had passed, he knew John had gone - the flat felt distinctly empty, void of soul and warmth, sterile, just as it had been when Sherlock had moved in at the tender age of 21, just a few years ago. He laid out on the couch and stared at the ceiling, trying to get used to that feeling again. The flat now felt like a year-round winter.
