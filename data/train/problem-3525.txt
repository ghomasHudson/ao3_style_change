Cas signs his name with a flourish, all fancy handwriting that seems to be a by-product of all that Enochian, and Marie whistles approvingly, taking back her notepad and examining it.
. You were supposed to— to settle down, leave hunting, have everything you wanted. You were supposed to live a long life, Dean. You deserved a long life.”
Part of the problem is that the people in Dean’s life, right now, are wise to his tricks. No one’s fooled by the macho-man posturing, not that they ever were (although if he thinks hard enough about that, he
“Hey, come on, sleepyhead.” Urgh, god, he sounds all choked up. He swallows and it doesn’t help at all. “You’re not gonna give your— not gonna give your wife a kiss g’morning?”
coming around to the idea that they taste alright. Sure enough, Sam’s given him the anxiety one. The pussy.
Sam sighs, exhausted and weary and sounding far too old to be Dean’s baby brother. He angles himself towards Dean, phone face-down on his knee in his classic
a micro-aggression). Whatever counts as a non-weird way to put it. Dean picks up his napkin and sends him a look, like,
Dean would love to say something to that, but whatever tries to croak itself out of him gets swallowed up by the Empty as the floor starts to gurgle. Dean’s back in the bunker, Billie is right fucking outside, and Cas is gonna die and then Dean’s gonna die, because Dean’s the main character and Cas is expendable, except he isn’t, he
Dean can’t answer. There’s a horrifically tight feeling in his chest, right under his sternum, a slow and painful crush that works hard to choke him up.
Dean dishes some bacon out onto Cas’ plate alongside his scrambled eggs, because he’s managed to make Cas a fan of the cholesterol breakfast of champions. He’s in a good mood despite everything, at once holding the power to be cheerful as fuck or revert to sulking on rooftops, but he’s settled on the first. The only thing that could make this better would be if he were in an actual kitchen with
for him. He’s happy Sam gets this (and maybe a little jealous, but no, he’s not thinking about that), and when she’s finally released by his sasquatch of a brother, she turns that grin on him, and it’s kind of a miracle that there are actually people in Dean’s life happy to see him, and
He takes a perverse pleasure in the way that shuts Cas up, his jaw snapping shut and face going blank, absolutely blindsided. Dean scowls.
Cas trying to come up with an excuse, still trying his darndest to sacrifice himself for Dean. Well, tough luck, Sherlock, because that’s just not good enough. Leaving without Cas is just not fucking good enough.
It’s a pretty terrible idea, all things considered, but it’s not like there was a chance of Dean sleeping tonight anyway, not when a tiny part of him is worried he’s gonna wake up and find he’s actually been trapped in a Djinn dream, or something. He’s
“You got that right,” says Dean, returning to his own meal. He shifts a little, tucks his foot up next to Cas’ under the table, and asks the question that’s been bothering him a while, gesturing with a fry. “Why are you doing this, man?”
“But aren’t you meant to be— you know.” He gestures, vaguely, around them, in a move that’s meant to encompass everything in the entire freaking universe. “Capital-H
“No,” he says. Apparently this is as far as he ever gets, always faced with Cas and words in his throat that won’t fucking come out, but Dean
“I want to,” he says, and Cas’ eyes snap to him. “Cas, I— it’s kind of a moot point, to be honest. You’ve already got me. I
Jack looks genuinely afraid of the answer, and Dean is a lot of things, a hypocrite one of them, but he won’t be to Jack, not anymore. Not when Dean himself has traded just about everything possible to save his own family, and would do it again in a heartbeat. So what if Jack was going to break his hands-off promise? What the hell is free will, when sacrificing it can save Cas?
“You may kiss the bride,” says Cas, with a silly little smile, one corner of his mouth ticked up to high hell. It’s the best thing Dean’s ever seen.
“With the music,” says Sam. Something prickles across the back of Dean’s neck, and he grunts. Sam sighs. “I’m just saying. When you’re not trying to be him, you’re a pretty decent father.”
, of all things, and Sam’s getting all weepy, and Charlie hugs him so tight she nearly cuts off his air supply. Eileen kisses his cheek, and Jack looks between them with endearing sincerity, and it’s Dean’s
“I was under the impression we came here specifically so I could complete this without letting my ‘bad vibes’ ‘ruin your Wednesday’.”
He kills the engine, taking a shaky breath. They’re next to a field. That’s nice. Cas gives him an apprehensive look. “Dean—?”
“Cool,” she says, and now whenever he goes back they do a stupid thing where they grin at each other like they’ve got a secret, even though all he knows about her is that she’s terrible at packing his groceries and he always has to redo ‘em once he makes it back to the car, so that the bread doesn’t get squashed on the way home.
“I am mostly human, now,” says Cas, in dry amusement. Dean watches his face, grinning. “Consuming that much alcohol appears unwise.”
who’s responsible for this, easy as breathing. He’s got a horrible feelings that those exceptions Jack mentioned extend a lot further than just Cas and himself. “My kid, he— Jesus, it’s such a long story, I don’t even know…”
Cas looks smug. He helps Dean wash up, and Dean’s almost stupidly giddy over that, too, because it’s hard to be cranky when he’s got an angel of the lord up to his elbows in dish-soap, being all stupid and endearing. He pops into Charlie’s room to let her know they’re going out and to ask her to keep an eye on Jack, and she gives him a little salute.
Sam blows out a long, deep breath. “Jack can’t bring you back from your next suicide mission, Dean,” he says, with fucking brutal honesty. “Next time Cas goes, that’s it. And yeah, I hope it’s a long fucking way in the future, but stuff
“Alright,” says Dean, and stares after her. It’s weird. She’s not Cas’ kid, he gets that, she’s Jimmy’s, but for all that she acts tough, to him she always just looks really fucking
“I meant it, you know,” Dean had said, quiet-like. Cas’ chest was hot under his hand, kind of clammy from sweat, not that that was acting as a deterrent. Cas hummed. “I want you to be happy. You want me to— I dunno. Start eating veggies, lose a couple pounds, whatever. I draw the line at trading Baby in for a mom-van, but I just. You gotta know I’d— you know I’d do anything for you, man. Go to Hell, the Empty, all of that, but also—you just tell me. I can— I wanna be good to you, Cas.”
. It’s not really the answer he’s searching for, but Cas interrupts before he can figure out what to say next; “What are you and Sam doing?”
He figures out pretty quickly that Claire doesn’t really know what she’s looking for, but that’s fine. They find an outdoor yard on the first day, go poking around the old cars as Dean tells her the merits of each one, finding himself getting excited about it, because it’s not like he ever gets a chance to do this, normally, and he loves cars, actually. They’re cool as shit.
with Cas and Claire, Sam’s laptop hooked up to Bobby’s ancient TV. Jack’s still bundled up like a burrito (Dean’s starting to wonder if they should be concerned— this seems like a
. “Why you gotta be like that, man?” Dean says, and he’s whining, fucking sue him. “I didn’t do enough for you growing up?”
He gestures, vaguely, and Cas wanders in closer, Sam’s sweatpants pooling around his ankles. The t-shirt he’s wearing is one of Dean’s old ones, and he’s got a cardigan pulled over it, something Dean’s sure was left over from a case, because there’s no way either he or Sam would have owned that by choice. That, or Cas bought it while he was out with Jack. He fires up the kettle, rummaging around for one of Sam’s crappy herbal teas, and then comes to sit beside Dean, pulling one foot up onto the chair. It’s ridiculously human. Dean avoids looking at him, just focuses on getting this stupid polish off, because it is fucking
He risks a look at Cas’ face rather than his tie, which is what he made that big speech to. The look on his face is certainly emotional, and that perks Dean’s spirits up a bit, but the bastard still hasn’t actually
Angels are weird about gender. That’s normal, it’s fine, Dean doesn’t really care. He thinks it probably has something to do with not really getting that some shit’s for girls and some shit’s for guys, or maybe once they figure it out they just don’t care. That’s definitely Cas. Oh, the dude’s pitched his tent firmly in the man-camp, but he’s not really like any man Dean’s ever known. Doesn’t give a crap about how they’re supposed to be, how they’re supposed to look, not anything. If Dean were feeling sentimental he’d call it fucking inspiring, but that’s way too chick-flick, too embarrassing, too exposing.
Now, though, he’s got free will and whatever is going on in his chest, so he slips Mary’s ring back onto his finger, kind of surprised that it still fits. It feels weird as fuck. Not a bad weird, but just like his brain doesn’t know what to do with it.
“Dean,” Sam says, all gentle. Dean fixes his eyes on the point where Baby’s headlights falter and leave the world melting into inky black, thinks it’s a pretty apt description for where he’s going. At least even Sam gets that some things are too risky for daylight. “Cas was family. He deserves to be mourned.”
Sam’s face sours. “Well, we can’t. Not that it would be a bad thing if people could. But, uh. For the record. No. I didn’t know.”
shit that Cas had to give up his grace, but he knows without a doubt that he’d do it again. There’s not much he wouldn’t have given to have gotten Cas back; Sam and Jack’s lives might have been the only exception. He feels worse for that fact, because Cas’ grace is a
in time with his boots. Doesn’t know what it’s like to not be trying to prove that statement every step of the way, with women and booze and winking at waitresses. Not caring, just letting people assume whatever they like, but that can’t be— that can’t be right.
“God fucking dammit,” mutters Dean, and covers his eyes with his hand. At least he’s still got a body. He’s got no clue where he’s going, and the one and only tether in this place is the portal at his back, which he seems to have some instinctive knowledge of. It’s a small mercy that at least he doesn’t need to worry about laying breadcrumbs or getting stuck here for eternity. He clears his throat, and speaks into the void. “Cas?”
“Of course,” says Cas, and it’s fine, it’s all good, but Jesus, this is next-level stupid. Dean’s a fucking moron. Cas looks at the tape in his hands, mouth turning down at the corners. “I don’t want to wear it out, though.”
He has no idea what’s going on in Cas’ expression, right now. Lots, by the looks of it. Also, a couple doors down the hall, Sam is groaning at the fact that Dean can’t retain one single thing from their conversation.
“Yeah?” Dean hesitates. “Uh, I could give you a hand with that, if you wanted. I know a thing or two.”
Cas gives him a look so flat that Dean practically withers under it, his neck flushing hot. “Yes, Dean. It’s the gay one.”
Bobby’s done a shopping run, at some point, so there is actually food to eat. Dean cooks the biggest stack of pancakes he can, figuring the smell’ll draw everyone in like a pack of vultures, which is proven correct. Claire drags herself into the world of the living and emerges in fluffy pink slippers that don’t really match her look, and loads her pancake up with peanut butter and blueberries. Then she does the same again and pushes it towards Cas.
Cas sighs. He gives Dean a look that suggests he’s trying to parse him out. “If you wish that I had chosen a different name, I… understand,” he says, carefully, “but I thought— That is, I felt that given the nature of our relationship, that you wouldn’t— you have often referred to us as family, Dean—”
Dean shrugs, and avoids looking at him. His heart is pounding. “It was. You know. A kiss, or whatever.”
. He curls his fingers into his palm and looks away, and thinks that having a guy say he’s in love with you is freaking
pausing and starting up again until Cas looks at him with blue shadows under his eyes, and says, way too deep: “Just make it
Cas sighs in exasperation. “You obviously have some way of knowing where you’re going. Do you need to see for it?”
“I’m not sure what to do with them,” says Jack, uncertain, pushing about a set of checkers than manifested themselves when he needed something to do with his hands. Dean has to admit that the fate of reality is a lot for a three year old, and wonders why the hell he and Sam thought it’d be okay to dump this on him. “They’re not
about this fucked up thing that’s going on with them, and so he keeps going, looking out over the scrapyard. “I just, I didn’t really think about it, you know? I figured me and Cas’d just kind of, uh, stick together until we were dead. Eternal bachelordom, or something. I dunno. It’s stupid.”
. Dean feels like every single drive he’s ever taken was actually leading him to here, all his roads arriving at one point of convergence. Cas died. Cas came back.
“I’m still an angel, but yes,” says Cas, and picks up his coffee. His face wrinkles when he sips at it, apparently none the wiser to the fact that Dean’s feeling like a blushing Victorian mistress just based on some light hand brushing. It’s not a particularly good feeling, either; mostly he just feels queasy.
Dean looks around the car for approval; he gets a well-meaning shrug from Sam, a quirk of the mouth from Cas, and decides to leave it on.
Jack, still hopped up on the God juice, stops suddenly, and cocks his head to the left. Dean looks up kind of blearily; alert enough to realise that something’s going down, but still too sluggish to actually sit up and take note.
has done nothing in terms of making Ellen less protective), and so Dean actually does get half a moment to stop and regroup with just his family, collapsing in front of the TV with the subtitles on.
Proposals are probably meant to be more romantic, thinks Dean with a wince. He doubts gruff shouting is usually involved. Sam probably cried asking Eileen.
“It means that even if I had had longer to consider it, my choice would have remained the same. Prior to my deal with the Empty, I always intended, grace or no, to spend a human life with you, if I could. With all of you. My grace was a small price to pay, in comparison.”
Dean swallows, audible in the quiet. “No,” he says. “Or, I mean, maybe. I sure tried to tell myself I loved you like a brother. That was— I dunno how I did, actually. But—" his brain catches up on the last couple of seconds, "wait, you said
“Oh,” says Cas, and abandons his protests. He grins. “Well, that’s alright, then. In that case a ride would be welcome.”
Sam thinks it’s because they finally have the chance to decompress, to exist. The first thing Sam did after killing God was to go mental and trash the library, which, Jesus, Dean had kind of expected to be doing himself, but it makes a sort of sense that it was Sam, who hasn’t been allowed to be angry in a long damn time. Who hasn’t been allowed to be his own, in a long time.
, and that isn’t Sam’s fault, and Dean shouldn’t have put it on him, and Jesus, he’s such a screw up—
“Okay,” says Dean, and pulls himself together. He puts both hands on Jack’s shoulders, ducking down to catch his eyeline, steeling himself. “Here’s what we gonna do, alright? You’re gonna kick down the Empty’s door, I’m gonna go and get Cas, and then we’re gonna fix your soul-overload problem, okay? And then, after that, we’re gonna go get Sam and go to the fucking beach. Capiche?”
Jack goes with it willingly, balls his hands in the fabric of Dean’s jacket like this was, in fact, just what he needed. Dean presses his tongue hard to the roof of his mouth, tightening his jaw in the effort to ignore the lump that rises in his throat, because this is just another thing he failed, in the end. But maybe it’s one he can fix.
There is—urgh—mountains of shit Dean could be trying to unpack, if he wanted. He definitely does not. He is, in fact, trying damn hard not to think about any of it. He made his peace with his childhood and his dad by burying that shit down six feet under, and he’s not dragging it back up for closure. What’s dead should stay dead, and he’s managing just fine.
“No!’ says Dean. It sounds unconvincing even to his own ears, so he swallows again. A truck whizzes past, ruffling Cas’ coat. “No, I just. There’s usually, you know. Asking involved.”
“Yup.” Dean takes Cas’ arm again now that they’re nearing it, just in case it decides to give the human a headstart and yank him out solo. “It’s been giving me a hell of a headache. We’re nearly there, though. Almost home. Fair warning, the ride’s pretty rough.”
“You could never cramp my style, Dean,” says Cas, eventually. “You are… a life at your side is all that I want, regardless of the shape that it takes. So long as you want it, too.”
She picks up a crayon, her eyes darting up and over to Cas and then away. “I guess he came back alright, then.”
Dean blows out a breath. This is… a lot, really, and quite frankly Dean’s sick of having the world on his shoulders. If they’re dead they won’t know either way, right? Dean spent twenty eight years of life expecting to be worm food when he inevitably kicked the bucket (or, not even—he was pretty well assured he’d end up salted and burned from the get go), so eternal life as a star sounds alright, against the alternative. And if it means Jack can step down—
i really hope you enjoyed reading this! it was a pretty mammoth effort, so i'd really love to hear your thoughts! you can also come and say hi to me on tumblr,
“I think that I should release them,” finishes Jack, his eyes wide. “It isn’t fair to keep them here, not really, so I thought I could— get rid of it. Heaven, I mean. Hell, too. It isn’t fair; so many of the souls in Hell are there not because they’re truly evil, but because the system is flawed, and Heaven is… lonely. To live out eternity trapped in the same memory, no matter how happy— is that really so wonderful? Isn’t it better to put them at peace, once and for all? They should be returned to the universe.”
He kissed her or they went out and however it ended, Dean got up in the morning with black smudges on his eyelids, and he looked in the mirror and he thought: there ain’t no guys like me.
“Thanks, Charlie,” says Dean, because she’s his best friend, and it’s great. He kind of feels bad about what he’s about to spring on her. Still, he thinks it’ll be worth it. Cas catches his eye after they’ve all helped themselves to desert, Dean’s homemade apple pie sitting devoured in the centre of the table, and raises his eyebrow. Dean nods.
Sam, surprisingly, grins at him. Real fucking wide, as well. “Okay. You making stir fry? I got tofu in the fridge.”
“It’s an affront to all things good food,” says Dean, and then sighs. “But, yeah, come on. I put some aside for your weird veggie version.”
“Yes,” he says, and Dean’s pulse is loud in his ears. Dean doesn’t know what the hell they’re transmitting, only that he couldn’t look away from Cas right now if he tried. More than that, he doesn’t want to. Cas is back. Cas loves him. Jesus, Dean should’ve taken a moment to think about that.
“I wanna think that, too,” says Sam, “but it’s been weeks, Dean. We don’t even know how to get to the Empty, or pull him out. You’ve gotta face up to the fact that this might be it, else it’s just gonna hurt worse.”
“Shut the fuck up,” Dean says, one hand to his back, and hobbles through to the kitchen. Bobby has obviously done a shopping trip at some point before they got here, so at least there actually is coffee for Dean to skull. He makes himself a cup, resolutely ignoring the kitchen’s other occupant, and listening for other sounds of movement throughout the house. Sam’s already on the porch FaceTiming Eileen, Jack and Claire have yet to drag themselves out of bed, and, given the kitchen’s other occupant, that person stomping about upstairs must be Bobby. Cool.
, and there must be some contingencies to that. He must want to hold Dean’s hand or kiss him stupid or something else in those ballparks, because sure, fine, the happiness might exist in the ‘just being’ when you’re about to die and there isn’t time for anything else, but now that there
bright, and he even manages to put his nerves aside all throughout dinner, grilling Charlie about Stevie until he remembers that’ll just make her grill him right back, and then finding he doesn’t care.
“Ah,” says Dean. He thinks that’s embarrassment, that he’s feeling. His hands feel hot. He casts his mind back to Purgatory, to that prayer he sent out on his knees, and yeah. Dean was in love with him, there. He’s starting to think he always has been.
Somehow Dean, Cas and Sam are the only ones left standing, and then Sam takes the couch without fanfare or even talking about it, and Dean—
“Dean,” says Cas again, insistent, still in that quiet, pleading tone. “What have you done, to get here? What deal did you make?”
“I just,” he says, “I was gonna say that, um, sometimes it’s better if you’ve got, uh. Company. My mattress is frickin’ great, man, but it’s not— it’s not the same as being able to hear someone else’s breathing.”
When he pulls his gaze up from the page, Cas is concerned, a wrinkle between his eyebrows that Dean instinctively wants to smooth away.
“We have different definitions of simple,” says Dean. “But, seriously, you’re really okay with this? It’s not like we had a lot of time to discuss it, back in the Empty.”
Dean focuses on unpacking the second bag of groceries, laying everything out methodically on the table. If hunting vamps is a step down, then getting out has got to be the equivalent of a swan dive off a cliff. Dean clears his throat.
. Everything you do endears me. I would never ask you to change anything about yourself, would never
“I’ll sign,” says Cas, eager, apparently, to take his new legally-sound identity for a spin. Dean puts his chin in his hand and hopes valiantly that he doesn’t look like a thirteen-year-old girl gazing besottedly at her Justin Timberlake poster. Cas removes a fountain pen from his pocket and takes the bill and Dean knows that he’s failing, but he also doesn’t really care; that bright light feeling is back.
It breaks something in Dean’s brain. Like, severely. Because a couple of days later Dean wakes up in bed with Cas sprawled all over him, octopus limbs and everything, and he feels so lucky that he thinks he could probably cry. Cas is a dead weight on him, is breathing against his neck in a way which is hot and sticky and gross, and Dean’s eyes are actually burning. When Cas stirs, he noses against Dean’s skin and grumbles and tries to block out the sun with whatever piece of Dean he can find, and Dean says:
“I’m good,” he says, with the hand sign to go with it. He’s not as good as Sam, but she still lights up a little more, and that feels good. Jesus, but things feel
“Oh,” Dean says, again. He scratches behind his ear, pulls a weak smile outta his ass and even manages some jazz hands to go with it. “Well, ta da.”
affecting him more than he’s showing. He knows Jack gave him that power-up in Heaven, but last time Cas went human he was a wreck, and it must be all kinds of shitty, to change species. They should probably stop making him explain it. Give the dude time to grieve.
Cas pulls back immediately. His hands are hot on Dean’s skin, shoved up under his shirt, but they halt in their exploration, which is good, because otherwise Dean doesn’t think he’d be capable of speech. Also, uh, boundaries, or whatever. Dean says, “I forgot to—just, before we keep going, I forgot to say that there’s—one more thing. That I want, I mean.”
His eyes dart to the side and then back to Cas, and he takes a deep breath and holds it in his chest, because he can
In the end, they didn’t get around to going shopping for Cas’ own stuff, for the combined reason of Cas being pretty content to continue stealing Dean’s shit, and Dean thinking that he probably couldn’t handle going through that following this new fount of knowledge available to him. He’s not telling Cas he loves him in the middle of a
, Dean,” he says, final, and stomps into the room. He leaves the door open behind him in a passive-aggressive invitation, and Dean stares at it for half a moment, hovering, and then he goes off to sleep in Baby.
“Uh,” says Dean, feeling weirdly flustered. “What? No, it’s— it’s whatever, dude. Just. If you want to come, you can.”
“Dean’s right,” Cas says, and shoots a soft smile back his way. “We are fucking proud of you, Jack.”
Sam blinks again. “Jesus Christ,” he says, and Dean’s offended. “Look, I don’t really—I mean, I don’t really know about this stuff, but lots of people are— are neither, or both, or trans, and that’s— that’s totally fine, Dean. It’s totally fine to be like that.”
“I think we’re doing very well,” says Cas, and Dean decides the highway’s empty enough that he can lean over and kiss him, just briefly. Good thing Jack’s not in the car— Dean didn’t really wanna bust out the ‘do as I say not as I do’ this early, not when he’s trying to teach road safety to the kid on the weekend, and— yeah. Whatever. He’s too preoccupied to think about that right now.
“Yeah, well,” says Dean, and focuses on keeping his knuckles loose on the steering wheel, drumming out a beat that doesn’t quite match the music. He hasn’t thought about Cas since it happened, has switched himself off just so that he can get through the frigging day. He glances over at Sam just long enough to catch a glimpse of his expression and decide he doesn’t want to see the rest of it, and turns back to the road.
“Yeah, whatever.” Dean swings a little in his chair. “Oh, also, I found us a vamp case in New Orleans while you were busy grabbing rabbit food. Figured we could make it there by Sunday if we hustle.”
this. “I’m still— I’m still mad about it, okay? Or hurt, or whatever. I don’t know how not to be, Cas, it’s my
Cas also keeps worrying that there’s going to be some side-effect of Jack giving up his God-powers, but after two months in which absolutely nothing happens that might suggest there’s some next big nasty waiting for them, Cas has to admit that perhaps he’s actually fine, and the other shoe’s content to hang about it mid-air forever. Dean calls him a helicopter parent. Cas comments on glass houses.
His voice is extra gravelly, Dean notices, because it’s polite to notice these kind of things about his friends, probably.
. He thinks he’s still pissed at Cas, probably, but it’s not like they’ve ever handled things normally. At some point, he’s sure, Cas is going to want to argue about the recklessness that led to his rescue, and Dean’s almost certain he’s got shit bottled up to let out, but for now,
It’s a stupid choice. No doubt about it, it’s one of the worst ideas he’s ever had. It’s selfish, and it sure as hell isn't a victory. But it is, maybe, his first act of free will.
“I just,” Dean says again, later, after he’s marinated on this for a couple of hours, waving around a knife even though sharp objects and this topic probably shouldn’t mix. “Okay, you remember
Dean keeps his hold on his sanity very, very tenuously. This is fine. This is all fine, perfectly fine.
“You’re a damn idjit,” Bobby says. “You’ve built yourself a life, and you got people in it who love you. You think I ain’t gonna be happy about that?”
But, look, in Dean’s defence, it’s not like there’s a manual for this sort of thing. Dean will be the dorkiest, stupidest, dadliest dad in the world if he’s gotta be, if that’s what makes Jack happy. For the kid, sure, but he’s also aware of the number one rule for dating single parents: you expect to be their priority and you can expect to hit the damn curb. Happy wife, happy life, or whatever. Happy kid, happy wife. Something like that.
“Cas,” Dean says again, his headache receding now that he’s got something familiar to look at, to touch, to feel. He puts his hand on Cas’ neck, searching for a pulse, and shakes him by the shoulder. “Cas, buddy, wake up.”
If he was capable of thinking about this in any way resembling sane, Dean’d probably recognise that all Bobby would really be threatening, right now, would be some gruffly supportive comment. It only freaks Dean out the way it does because if he says it then
Cas squirms, and looks away from Dean for the first time all conversation, finally looking at least a little embarrassed. “Oh,” he says, “Um. I believe the simplest answer is that I was being… petty.”
Dinner goes in the oven, and then they all mess around for an hour, catching up and drinking and Dean feeling tremendously fucking sappy, his arm round Cas’ shoulder and Cas burning so,
Sam is not the person Dean wants to talk to about this, but he is, unfortunately, kind of what feels like his best bet. He grew up with Dad and in all the same places, heard all the same shit and saw more of the same stuff than anyone else did. And Sam ain’t exactly living up to the paragon of manliness himself, either, what with his smoothies and yoga and shit.
“Even it was to change,” he says, and Dean tracks the movement of his mouth, kind of blind-sided that he’s even here and talking, “Heaven would still be flawed. An eternity, no matter how peaceful, is sure to lead to apathy eventually. To become conscious of one’s Heaven would be to realise one is trapped there.”
Sam opens his mouth, closes it. Places his hands awkwardly on the table. “So, uh, you and Cas, huh? That’s—? You’re like—a thing? Like, a thing-thing?”
“Hi, Jody,” says Bobby, and they hug. Sam’s getting teary-eyed again. Dean turns his attention to Claire, who is standing in her big fuck-off boots, arms crossed and mouth surly.
“Okay,” says Sam, all careful like, but his wet eyes betray him. He’s taken the whole thing a lot better than Dean (although, Dean’s pretty sure that Sam at first thought Dean’s ramblings about Bobby were a side-effect of Dean’s inevitable psychotic breakdown), but that’s pretty much the usual, for them. “But, Jack, I mean— what about everyone else? Chuck must’ve meddled with a lot of lives. Who else did you bring back?”
must be able to hear. He curls his fingers into the fabric, eyes stuck on them, and then he finally forces himself to look up and meet Cas’ gaze, to bare his neck. He has to angle his head up, what with the stairs, but he doesn’t freaking care at all. They can figure out the details later.
The portal still looks intact— if it was put here by God, he guesses the Empty can’t mess with it, which is good. It’s still glowing like lightning, crackling and splintering out from a vaguely man-sized gap in reality, not quite as vacuum-y as the one in Purgatory, but Dean can still feel the tug that comes with it. Then, underneath it, something more friendly: Jack.
“It’s complicated,” answers Cas, and a very fucking embarrassing noise rips itself from Dean’s throat.
“Hm?” says Cas, pretending to be focused on cutting his next helping of burger, which, combined with the carefully even tone, makes Dean instantly suspicious. “Oh, that. No. I spoke to Claire, but we didn’t feel it would be right. Sam suggested Winchester.”
“Right,” Dean says, steeling himself. Cas waits. He could stand to look a little more bothered, in Dean’s opinion. He knows there’s been a lot going on, what with the rescue and everything, but if
"Sorry," he says. Dean wonders if Cas really believed he was just gonna let this all coast under the radar, if that's why he's trying to avoid it. As if.
He doesn’t put a tape in the Impala’s deck for the way back. They didn’t put one in earlier, happy to just sit in each other’s company, but with all the feelings jumping around inside Dean right now, he sure is feeling the itch for a distraction. Some heavy drums’ll do it, but he doesn’t want Cas to think he needs one. He doesn’t want Cas to— to think that he’s panicking. Because he still isn’t. Or at least not about— the thing. It might be thing-adjacent, but it’s not, ah.
Being classed as cool by the kid or snitching and getting in Cas’ good books: it’s an eternal struggle.
to, it’s just— issues. He’s working on ‘em. It becomes much easier when Cas smiles at him, resting a gentle hand on his knee as he calls for attention.
All this to say, Cas is acting normal. Dean is also acting normal, it’s just that he’s also considering what they might be doing right now if Cas had taken him up on his offer, and wondering whether Cas is the type to be grossed out by morning-breath. Dean wants to say yes, but what does he know? Maybe Cas isn’t bothered by getting a little freaky before teeth have been brushed. It’s yet another problem that could be solved by Cas just letting Dean give him what he wants, because then Dean could actually get tangible evidence, rather than the scenarios he’s cooking up in his head, but apparently life is just out for him in this, too.
Cas is looking at him, Dean can tell, and then he says; “Sam, would you ask Eileen to look at me, please?”
“Okay,” Sam says, “But that’s the demon hunting stuff, Dean. This is, like, emotions. And I’m— I’m worried about you.”
Dean forgets, a lot of the time, that the angels don’t actually live in their bodies, and occupy a whole other dimensional space. Cas had tried to explain it to him once before, begrudgingly and like it wasn’t worth the effort, as if he knew Dean’s monkey brain didn’t possess the capacity to comprehend it. At the time Dean had been kind of offended, but now he’s realising he’s going to have to give him that one, because even facing it head on is doing fuck-all in helping him to understand. He feels like he’s having a stroke.
“Guess Heaven ain’t gone after all,” he slurs out, and Cas closes his eyes like he can’t fucking believe Dean is like this.
“Holy shit,” says Sam, and then it’s just— noise. It’s squeals and hugs and a punch in the arm from Claire, and then she tries to give him the
“All,” says Cas, into his palm, and Dean grins. It’s awful, it’s obviously awful, but he’s riding the high of having Cas back, of having
all in the one day. Cas shifts his weight so his knee touches Dean’s and it’s the anchor, the tether, that lets Dean keep his sanity. He reaches over to put his hand on Jack’s shoulder, reaching for Cas instinctively with the other.
“Thanks, Jack,” says Dean, in a rare occasion of making good on what he’s thinking, even though Jack can’t hear it. He knows what he’s supposed to do, so he squares his shoulders and bangs hard on the door. “Bobby, open up!”
“There is nothing Sam or anyone else could say or do that would cause me to run out on you,” Cas says, earnest, and Dean ducks his head to grin.
“And, look, I get it, alright? I’m shit at doing what I want, and now I’ve got this whole the-world-is-my-oyster thing going on, and it’s freaking me out. I just— I’ve never thought about this stuff, man. And like— me and you. I figured we’d just… stick together, y’know? And I know, I
“I—no,” starts Dean, and then sits down in the chair opposite, his stupid holey socks strewn between them on the table. “But I just— I thought— I thought you knew that I wouldn’t do that, anymore.”
They stay at Bobby’s for four days all up. Dean manipulates Jack and Cas into splitting the upstairs double bed, on the premise that they’re the ones who are actually recovering from shit, right now, and hustles his way onto the air mattress. It’s true, so they agree, and it keeps Dean from thinking too hard about why he can’t handle being in the same bed as Cas (and also from sleeping in his car at forty, which was
“So,” he says, in a barely-calm voice, and clenches his hands into fists, digging his nails into his palms, “so what you’re saying is—what? That this is my fault, for giving you murky fucking signals, or whatever? This is on
, but he can, almost like Cas is inside his head. “You came for me, you tried, it’s okay. This is my choice.”
thing. He can just barely crane his head to look at it, all spinning rings and burning eyes, but it looks dull. Dead. Dean averts his gaze and keeps walking, passing angel after angel after angel, and all of them demand to be looked away from, for Dean to hide under the covers, and so Dean does.
Jack’d come back from town yesterday with nail polish, which Dean probably should’ve seen coming. Eileen lights up when he asks her to help him with it, sitting them both down cross-legged on the floor, getting Jack to put his hands on the coffee table. Dean watches them more than the TV, a weird feeling in his chest. He can’t have fucked Jack up that badly, he thinks, if Jack doesn’t mind this. If he feels like it’s okay. Cas pushes his knee against Dean’s on the couch, almost like he can see inside his head, and knows Dean wants to say something, wants to warn Jack that some people are going to have a problem with it. Dean wonders if he’s one of them.
Right. Fuck, Dean had forgotten that conversation. The closest he ever got to understanding that Cas has whole different way of seeing the world was by comparing it to a bad acid trip, and even then he had to substitute that for his experience with dream root. He bets Cas sees in fucking shrimp colours, too. And souls. Can’t forget that.
a shock to the system, to jolt him out of his methods, and maybe Cas finally refusing to meet him halfway is it. For once, Cas is asking Dean to reach first.
“So you’re human again, Cas?” asks Sam, with a face that vying between sympathy and relief. Dean gets it. He feels really,
in this story, the only reason he’s here is because he’s a stubborn fucking bastard who refused to just take his dues and quit.
that confession on him, and he’s furious that Cas doesn’t get that Dean literally doesn’t want a life without him. Half of him wants to drag Cas out kicking and screaming, to do something
, man,” says Dean, and sits further back in his chair like the old man he is, rubbing his brow. “I mean yeah, kinda, I guess, but it also— there might be something— you know. Better. Apparently. Cas is, like, fully in love with me, so. I dunno. I guess that he wants—that.”
If I heard right, you good as killed the bastard. You’re not a character, Dean, you’re a human being. A fucked up one, and everything, but isn’t everyone? You’re a
“Hey, Cas, fetch me some rosemary, would you?” he asks, and demonstrates to Claire what to do with the chicken. She looks up at him, defiant.
He says it like it’s a fact, which yeah, it is, but he also says it like it’s— special. Dean guesses maybe it is. Hell, Purgatory, the Empty… their big changes tend to happen off-screen from the real world, tucked away in the shadows, like they always have. Cas says it like Dean made a choice to go save him, but he hadn’t, not really. It’s never a choice.
That’s a Vonnegut line, but Dean likes it. Cas is dead. So it goes. Dean’s getting him back. So it goes.
about that). Still, Dean doesn’t know if he’s ever wanted anything long-term, and by the long pause in which Cas ponders, he thinks maybe Cas hasn’t.
“Dean.” He makes a set of quick stitches. Dean watches his fingers work and wonders when the hell he even had time to learn. “I’m just preparing for every eventuality. What happens if your mother asks for us to go?”
that passes over Cas’ face, feels some of it himself, shoulders sagging. Jack’s grin is palpable in his voice, and they turn in sync to find him beaming at them. “Hello, Castiel.”
“Yeah, I know,” he says, which is kind of a miracle. He squeezes Cas’ hand, looks over to meet his eye. “You know the same goes, right?”
“Yup,” says Bobby, and shrugs, “Well, that an’ a couple of other memories, just repeating over and over. It wasn’t too bad, at first, but things got a little… fractured, when your boy took over. Started noticing it was just a dream when I’d go from tossin’ a ball round with you and Sam to seeing Karen in the next second. Was like dying all over again.”
“Dean,” he says, and faces him. His coffee plunks when he sets it on the counter. “It’s alright. You don’t need to do this, I understand. I appreciate that you want to make me happy, I do, but I’m not trying to force you into anything, and I am content to leave things as they were.”
. God was a guy in a shitty suit with a drinking problem still trying desperately to justify killing his sister way back when. It’s not like Dean gets a kick out of taking the wind from religion’s sails. It’s mostly just kind of depressing.
“Good morning, Dean,” says Cas, calmly, the next day, when Dean eventually convinces himself to stop cowering in his room. He’s been up already, has made a risky trip to the kitchen for one of Sam’s breakfast bars, but other than that he has been doing extremely important research in his room. He’s been making sure that the world isn’t suddenly collapsing now that there’s no God, and Sam has been doing this, too, so. Dean’s normal. He definitely wasn’t hiding from anyone.
, recently, when he isn’t being a fucking dreamboat and the nicest person in the world, and all. And yeah, fine, it’s fair, because Dean broke his stupid heart or whatever, but
She points out a couple, and Dean walks her through the kind of things to look for, what questions to ask. “Most times people dump a car when they’ve just got told what the next service is gonna cost. You wanna double check the timing belt, ‘cause that’s usually the main one. And if it ain’t been replaced recently, you can use that to haggle the price a bit.”
“It’s good to see you,” she says, pulling back and holding him at arms-length, scrutinising him. “But seriously, Dean. Moisturiser exists.”
“You’re very pretty,” Cas says again, on purpose and because he knows it’ll fry Dean’s brain, he’d bet anything. He cocks his head, doing the clueless angel shtick even though Dean’s
“Well, yeah, obviously,” says Dean, again. “You— wait, were you expecting me to get uppity about that? I’m an excellent fucking ally! I fuck men!”
Jack looks between them, caught in the headlights, and Cas, unfairly evenly, says, “That’s quite a wise point, Dean. You
Sam pulls a face like the answer should be obvious. “Uh, yeah, Dean. I mean, we didn’t really get to know her, before, and I know she wasn’t— I guess that she wasn’t what either of us wanted, or hoped, or whatever, but now she’s— I mean, she’s sticking around, right? Like, I’ve got to get to know her. For the long term. It’s just. It’s weird. Don’t you feel like it’s weird?”
Dean sighs. He’s getting in his own head too much, probably. It’s just a bracelet. It’s just to make Jack happy.
“Well,” he says, and there’s a bit of bite to it, but he tries to keep it level, because how is Cas this
, thinks about all the stupid outside forces that kept tugging him away; the angels, Amara, stupid Heaven. He catches himself thinking that now it might be different, and checks his ego. He might be able to blame Chuck for laying those things at Cas’ feet, but it was Cas who stepped through the door. That’s what the two of them
His hand was on Dean’s face, and it was doing this stupid fucking thing where his thumb moved back and forth over the skin beneath Dean’s eye, and Dean’s throat hurt.
“Cool,” Claire says, and wipes at her eyes. She clears her throat at Jack. “Uh, see you, pipsqueak. Nice to meet you, or whatever.”
that it hurts. “I’m getting there. I think I can open a door to the Empty, but it’s not one I can walk through. I need— I thought—”
“Dean,” he says, eventually, in that tone of voice, and Dean knows where it’s going before he even starts, “Your daddy—”
? Sign me up. And I wanna make breakfast, for you and Sam and Jack. Help Jody and Mom out on hunts, maybe, but also, I dunno, do something else. Anything else. I want, uh. I want.”
, or whatever the fuck, but it’s not changing, so who cares. Then there’s Jack, who kind of thinks Dean’s the bees’ knees no matter what he does, and Cas has talked to Dean about
He drops Claire back at Jody’s and swings by Bobby’s to say hi, sharing a beer with him and trying to convince him to come down to the bunker. Bobby’s pretty dead set against it, for now, but Dean’ll get him.
does what Dean’s basically been begging for this entire fucking time, and shoves his tongue in Dean’s throat. Then it’s pretty great. Dean breaks away gasping, his hands clenched tight in Cas’ collar, shirt all rucked up around Cas’ neck. His brain has been severely kaputzzed.
Cas pauses, and considers. Carefully, he says, “I suppose from that perspective that I am, indeed, Han Solo-ing you.”
. He just can’t. He carried Sam out of that house when he was four years old and Sam just a baby, and he’s never let him go since. More than hunting, more than anything, that’s Dean’s
is his voice, honestly, is this a human thing? Is the alcohol messing with Dean’s perceptions? It doesn’t normally sound like this, Dean’s fucking sure of it. “For their sins. The angels descended, but Lot and his wife were spared, for having housed two angels the night before. They were urged to flee and not look back, but Edith did.”
“Hey,” he says, wincing when it comes out scratchy. Cas is sitting primly in one of the kitchen chairs, a newspaper he got from god knows where in front of him, and he’s barely looked up since Dean entered. He looks good, considering. Not like he’s suffering from a hangover, at least, and a stranger could probably barely tell that this time two days ago he’d been dead. “How’s the head?”
Cas takes the extra couple of steps down, and Dean doesn’t move. Doesn’t let him actually hit the floor, because if Cas wants to get past, well, he’s just going to damn well have to take him by the shoulders and move him. Maybe Cas' hands on him will fix that gaping wound in Dean’s chest.
“Look,” Sam says, lowly, “I get it, okay? I do. I wish he wasn’t gone, and I wish Jack coulda brought him back with everyone else, but denying it isn’t gonna fix anything, Dean. It’s not gonna bring Cas back.”
“Okay,” says Dean, and tugs on Cas’ collar. His body is stiff and unyielding under Dean’s hands, but it’d take a hell of a lot more than that to get Dean to give up. “Okay, Cas, I’m gonna bet that somewhere in there you can hear me, and I’m gonna need you to latch on to it and fucking come back to me, man. Whatever shit this thing’s got you wading through, whatever’s going on in your head right now, it isn’t real, okay? You just gotta wake up and smell the cocoa and then we can go home, okay, buddy?”
Dean shrugs. Sue him, but his voice has decided to take a hike. He forces it back into being. “Heya, Cas.”
“Come on, kiddo,” he says, and opens his arms. Dean takes the distraction to wipe at his treacherous eyes, relieved beyond measure that Jack and Cas are still down by the car. It’s not like Sam has a leg to stand on, anyway; he’s openly weeping, basically. Dean clears his throat, makes sure his voice can come out normally, and says;
, and he’s spending it here, in his home, with his family and all he’s ever wanted, and yeah, sure, they lost stuff to get here, but they found so much, too.
It’s kind of weird, actually, because on any occasion when Dean’s been asked, he’s always called Cas his best friend. But hanging out with Charlie again now really drives the point home that yeah, actually, she is. That’s not to diminish Cas, or anything, because he’s still the best
The moment lingers, but then, when don’t they? Dean breaks it by cracking another smile, since they come easier and easier these days, have done for a while, and then nods at the paperwork stacked beneath Cas’ phone, which has now switched to classical tunes. It’s marginally better than the sea shanties.
“You’re telling me,” Bobby says. “I ain’t never been doused so thoroughly. He sic’d three kids on me with water guns.”
of having no sunlight, so he sure as hell did drag Cas and Jack out here, although it probably doesn’t count as dragging when they wanted to come, to a place that actually possesses windows and a front door for the neighbours) and gather up Jack for their round of afternoon TV. Sam and Eileen are ostensibly busy helping with research for a hunt happening a couple of miles South, but Dean thinks that might be Sam trying to get out of it; he’s not a fan of
“Hell,” says Bobby, as Dean’s mouth falls open, his face doing something he’s sure he isn’t in charge of, corner of his mouth ticking up in frightened disbelief. “The years have not been kind to you.”
“Shit,” he says, and laughs, running a hand down his face. “God, hold on, I need to back up. You, uh. You heard me say I love you, right?”
of people, and he might be getting better at it in private but that doesn’t mean there isn’t an overwhelming urge to run and hide whenever he tries to do it in the presence of other people. Jody’s bringing Claire and Donna up for the day, and Charlie’s driving down, so Dean spends most of the day setting up the spare bedrooms, and then working on the food.
“Hello, Claire,” says Cas, a little awkward. Dean gave him some warning, that she didn’t take his death well, but he’s still ready to jump in if needed. Claire glowers at him.
“I should be to send you there,” Jack says, and starts to frown in concentration, the world flickering around him. “After that, the failsafe will open, and I can use its energy to sustain a portal of my own, one that Castiel can travel through, for your return.”
“I could see the web of his interferences,” continues Jack, rubbing at his eyes, and so Dean passes back a juice-box to Cas, who dutifully hands it over to Jack. “He manipulated Bobby’s death into being because he wanted you and Sam separated from the world, and isolated from all that you knew. It didn’t seem fair. None of it did.”
“Not really,” Dean says. “I just— I dunno. There’s a lot going on, I guess. Not feeling much of anything, right now, ‘cept for freaking confusion.”
Dean is terrified. He can’t even really feel it, but his hands are shaking and he’s not breathing and his face feels cold and all he can hear is the stupid fucking Empty, and all he can see is the black tar bubbling around them and all he knows is that Jack is obviously starting to lose, and Cas fucking
“Dean,” he says, reverent, and Dean gives him the poorest excuse for a hug ever, burying his face in Cas’ shoulder regardless of the fact that his fingers are still clenched in Cas’ lapels, a breathy little laugh escaping from him.
for some time now. He gestures at the built-in robe, feeling self-conscious, for some reason, and he doesn’t really get it. It’s not like he hasn’t been lending Cas clothes for a while now, but he supposes this is Cas taking them on
talk going on, since apparently making it out alive means that she’s now got the time to be mad at Jo for being all self-sacrificial. He gets the feeling this talk’s been going on the whole drive to Bobby’s, because Jo looks seconds away from tearing her own hair out. She walks up to him looking so fucking
. The word comes out a little fumbled, so he licks his lips and tries again. “You— okay. You get it, right? Like. Don't just do your thing where you pretend to be totally clueless about human stuff, 'cause— you know, right? You get it?”
in there, and if they know their lore, where both of the listener’s eyebrows hike up, and Dean feels his stomach sink. It’s his own fault, probably, for introducing Jack as Cas’ kid, but it’s not like he can
“What the hell are you looking at, then?” demands Dean, glaring down at himself, at his arms and legs that he can literally
, today. He forces himself to roll his eyes and scoff, because this damned juice can’t get the better of him
“Right,” he says, and fumbles around in his pocket til his clumsy fingers find metal. “Uh, Cas and I wanted to do something, but we’re doing it our way, so. Here you go, man.”
Sam’s mouth moving as he chews over his words, which is a sure-fire sign that Dean isn’t going to like whatever comes out. Sam fiddles with the corner of his phone case, then puts it face-down on his knee and angles himself towards Dean in his classic
“Yeah,” laughs Sam, “I think Bobby was kinda pleased, in a way. It’s gotta be weird, to be back on Earth with nothing pressing to deal with. I think he feels kind of lost.”
. He peeks out from behind his fingers, has the rare joy of seeing Sam gape like a fish and look properly wrong-footed. “Wait, you’re not this good a liar. Did you not
“Good,” says Sam, and it’s no fun when Sam won’t get embarrassed about it, so Dean just rolls his eyes and goes to make him one of his stupid teas, coming back out to the main room and sitting beside him, because he might as well keep him company. Plus, he wants to see Eileen, too. Maybe one of these days she’ll figure out she should’ve picked the handsome brother. Sam grins. “Thanks, Dean.”
Cas sends him a sharp look, and so Dean elaborates. “What, you think I just strolled in by myself? See that light over there?”
There’s nothing. His voice gets swallowed up as soon it leaves his mouth since there’s nothing for the sound to bounce off, which is a fat fucking help. He grits his teeth and keeps on staggering forward.
. He gets a message from Cas asking if he’s arrived safely in Sioux Falls, punctuated by three little emojis, and when he catches himself grinning in the mirror he thinks
Anyway, he can do this. He can tell Cas. Jesus, but it’s not like Cas deserves any less, after everything he’s done. Dean can give him what he wants. What he
Cas frown, feels the way the muscles move to make that little Meg Ryan crinkle above his nose. There’s a long moment in which Dean just breathes, and then Cas says, in his ridiculous, rumbling voice, “Is that meant to be a euphemism?”
“Right,” says Sam, hesitating. “So there’s no teleportation or healing, I get that, but if you’re still an angel, how come you need to sleep? Eat? All that, you know, human stuff?”
Still, though; it’s nice. It’s really nice, actually. Sam calls Jody and asks her to get her butt over here, and she shows up with Claire in tow, which is good, because the last time Dean saw her he was drunk and Claire was beating up one of Bobby’s old car wrecks. The aftermath of Cas’ death wasn’t a good time for anyone.
Dean gives himself a week and a half after The Diner Incident to pull himself together and have everyone over for dinner. Cas has a suggestion for what he wants to do, and it’s pretty perfect. For them, anyway. Dean double checks he doesn’t want to extend his foray into human stuff with a proper ceremony, and is relived when Cas gives him a flat look.
He mulls over it on the way back, feeling kind of ridiculous but also like he got worked up over nothing. It’s just juice. He supposes that maybe it has something to do with the fact that stuff
They then go and get burgers, and Claire has to tie up her hair to keep it out of her face, wincing when she brushes her ear and letting out a sharp hiss of pain. Dean’s raises his eyebrow, because his first thought’s always going to be a hunting injury, but then he sees the red skin surrounding a bar of metal, and only just holds back from rolling his eyes. He nods at it.
that action, going slack and letting Cas do whatever the fuck he wants. An embarrassing fucking noise gets pulled out of his throat, and Cas’s hands are roving fucking
“Thanks,” says Dean, and then loses his brief stint in coherency. “So, uh, I mean, you know, right? You know when it is that, uh— that people take each other’s last names?”
He’s been thinking, since it happened, that this probably isn’t right. He’s sure Billie would have a fit, if she knew about it, and if he’s honest, part of him doesn’t disagree. It’s not fair, really, to have dragged all these people back here just because, what, Dean missed them? Sam, Cas, Jack, they might think they’ve earned this reward, but Dean’s not so sure. He’s done a lot of fucked up shit.
Dean nearly chokes on his food. The only reason he doesn’t is because he’s used to being in dangerous situations, and tried to train himself out of the response so he didn’t end up some monster’s dinner because he was too busy getting killed by his own. He puts the burger down as he tries to absorb this new information. Castiel needed a last name. Sam suggested Winchester.
Cas is just— good. He’s so good at all of this, this parenting crap, this living his life like he wants, and Dean
Well, duh. Dean hadn’t even questioned that bit. Of course it would be him to go in. Jack says it like it’s the final blow, though.
. “Sometimes I wish he’d just landed in someone with boobs,” he says, only half joking. “It’d make this so much easier.”
“You did,” Jack says, like it’s easy. Dean has to hold onto the counter tip just to standing, because he is being hit with freaking
these things, and he needs to find his freaking filter again. It disappeared somewhere in-between the Empty and the kiss, the
“Peachy,” Dean says, and takes the drink. He gives Sam a lot of shit for believing that different leaves can do stuff like
“Won’t be here for a couple of hours, yet. Walmart’s still open, we’ve got time. At least it’ll stop you raiding my wardrobe.”
So, yeah. That’s a thing that happens. Dean’s walking around with black on his nails, and his dad’s rolling in his metaphorical grave, Dean’s sure, but it’s for his kid, so he can stomach it. It’s fine. It’s fine. It’s
Still nada. Dean’s skin is crawling again, and he clenches his hands in the material at Cas’ shoulders, something hot and angry within him.
Once they manage to get themselves back into the Impala, because the car’s good enough cover for getting a little handsy but not anything else, not now Dean’s got joints that crack and gets a stitch going up the stairs, it becomes a question of practicality. Dean can’t face a wedding. Cas doesn’t particularly
i simply have a lot of thoughts about dean constantly reacting to things but never actually thinking about his reactions or why he reacts that way. like i 100% believe he’s been in love with cas for years, i 100% believe all of his actions re: cas have been motivated by his being in love with him, and i still believe he has no fucking clue about it because he just refuses to look at it in any way shape or form beyond :-) hey :-) thats my buddy cas :-) … he is an INSANE MAN and i love him so much
Dean’s heart is beating out a staccato in his chest, and he’s hardly paying attention to whatever he’s scrolling through. He doesn’t think Cas has ever spent time in his room, not like this. It’s weird, but it’s fine. Dean’s not a teenage girl, so he’s fine. He is
“I think we should go inside,” says Sam, and, laughing, ushers them all in. The bunker fills up with noise for the first time in maybe
Cas grunts, leaning into Dean, and Dean reaches up to grab his other arm, trying to keep him on his feet while Cas goes all sack of potatoes on him. “You didn’t need to pick the chest,” he mutters.
The sun’s starting to set; soon Cas will have been back for two days. Two days, and soon enough he’ll be gone, off to his new freaking house, or whatever. Dean’ll probably have to help him with it, at the very least get him set up with some forged bank details. Although, Cas is new to the human thing, so he’ll probably want pointers in what to look for, too. Dean can do that; they can go check out a couple of places, find something that’ll keep the heat in during the winter and keep it out during the summer, to help save on electricity. Probably it’ll need some work doing to it, but that sounds pretty alright, to be honest. It’d be nice to use his hands for something good, for once. He can renovate while Cas sets up his garden.
“Uh,” says Dean, again. Jesus, but he’s turning monosyllabic. This is awful. Cas is awful. “I don’t care.”
on him, but he’s too preoccupied with letting his whiskey glass hit the map table, his hold just shy of shaky.
“So, uh,” says Dean, “this is gonna happen to everyone in heaven? They’re all just gonna dissolve, or whatever?”
He’s been stabbed before, more than once, and it hurt like hell. This doesn’t. The kindest option is to say that he makes the choice then, when it’s nothing more than a re-evaluation of circumstances, figuring out what he’s been given and what he’s going to do with it. He’s been on a greatest hits roll all day, and he
Part of that’s on Dean. He’s owning it, working on dealing with it, but that’s a long road and not really what his current predicament is about. He’s probably talking around it. He just. It’s just.
“No, I remember the movie,” says Cas, “I liked it. I meant that I don’t understand the implication.”
“Cas wants a house,” he blurts out, after a couple of minutes in which they just put things away in silence, Sam clearly trying to figure out what’s going on in Dean’s head. Good fucking luck. Dean avoids his eye by hiding his head in a cupboard, under the guise of putting away Jack’s cereal. “For him and Jack, you know. Some place with a garden.”
“Great fucking job, Dean,” says Dean, to the mirror, and drags his hand down his face. He doesn’t even know what his fucking
,” says Dean, and enthusiastically does so. He bundles his fist up in Cas’ coat, pulling him in, and laughs when he fucks up the angle out of eagerness. Cas noses at him, one hand on his jaw and one on his bicep, gripping tight, and Dean is so fucking happy that he feels like he might explode, or just melt into a puddle right here on the grass. Wouldn’t even matter if he did— Cas’d put him back together. Dean squeezes his eyes shut, focuses on the burning sensation in his chest, and kind of hopes Cas can feel it too. That he knows— just how much Dean loves him. That he’s wanted. Just, loads and loads of sappy stuff that Dean’s spent a long time denying he wanted; to love and be loved in return. And now he gets it all the time.
Dean stops, because he’s not stupid, and he knows Cas isn’t busting his way out on his own. He knows Jack’s taking his hands-off vow seriously, because he hasn’t answered a single damn one of Dean’s prayers, and Dean’s prayed
Jack fishes out a glass from drawer. “Castiel says it’s important I keep my blood sugar up now that I have it. I was merely following instructions.”
definitely didn’t buy them. He was serious about the dentist thing (although maybe Garth can hook them up with a discount). “I don’t mind.”
“The poetry wasn’t lost on me,” he slurs, one hand coming up to Dean’s bicep and clenching in it. It must help him get his balance, because he takes some of his own weight back, drawing back slowly. He takes in his surroundings, eyes roaming over the space, and that ridiculous little crinkle above his nose is back. Dean wants to see it every day for the rest of his life. Or his afterlife, if that’s what’s in the cards. He doesn’t care, so long as Cas is there. “Where are we?”
“Hey,” he says, fierce, “you’re doing great. I mean, Jesus, you’re being more productive in, like, what, a day? Than Chuck was in all of creation. I’m fucking proud of you, kid.”
but he doesn’t get the chance, because Cas is bringing his hands up, almost hesitant, to Dean’s face, and that makes his voice die in his throat. Or, no, not hesitant. Careful, maybe, in the most literal sense of the word. As if Dean's deserving of it. He lays them upon Dean’s cheeks and tilts his jaw up, brings his face skyward, and then he cranes his neck down and kisses Dean gently on the mouth.
“Hey,” he says, and puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder. Looking at him is a bit like looking through water, in that it stings Dean’s eyes, and so he’s hesitant to try at first, because if they’re in heaven that means Jack’s probably in God-form, right? That’s why he’s all shimmery? But Jack is warm and solid beneath his palm, and Christ, it really
Cas finally seems to grant Dean’s presence a modicum of interest; he looks up from the dish he’s drying and meets Dean’s eye evenly, face carefully blank, and Dean tries not to wriggle under the scrutiny. “Do you want me to come?”
“Okay, new plan,” he snaps, and tugs on Cas. “You’re gonna wake the fuck up, you hear me? You think you just get to spill all that shit and then fuck off here with no consequences? No way, José. I’m not fucking through with you yet, you bastard, and so I need you to
He can tell it’s affecting Sam, too. He, like Dean, keeps getting distracted in the middle of his sentences, reaching out to touch Bobby’s knick-knacks and books and things. It’s not like Dean even
He forces himself up the stairs, Sam slower at his heels. Dean has the sudden, coherent thought that
Dean doesn’t start these conversations, and it’s because they make his skin prickle, hairs standing to attention on his arms, because Cas is so
“Nothing,” he says, but it isn’t quite convincing enough to hide his snicker. “It’s just, you know. Soon enough you’ll be calling him ‘sport’.”
weird, is the thing. He’d been in the room with Mom for at least an hour, no matter what Sam says. They’d had a
Dean looks down at the floor, wonders why his face feels like there’s pressure behind it, a thousand tiny needles poking at the muscles in his cheeks.
s, man, I’m gonna lose it,” says Dean, but his voice is giddy because Cas is holding his hand, and soon enough he’s gonna put a ring on it. “And no way is he getting the chance to do a speech. Can’t have you running out on me ‘cause Sam thinks it’s funny to dredge up my dirty laundry.”
Jack frowns in concentration, which, crap, cannot be a good sign. “Um— Ellen, and Jo. I never met them, but Castiel liked them. Charlie— I liked her hair. Also Kevin. And— and Mary. I might've... there might've been some others. I can't remember. Also my mother.”
by people. Cas holds out the remote and, begrudgingly, Dean gives in and takes the damn thing, if only to make him stop.
A hissing white light appears between him and Jack, spluttering like bacon in a pan, and Dean takes a deep breath, salutes, and steps right on through and back to Cas.
“Yeah, Cas,” says Dean, and then does switch on the radio, because he can only take so much in one sitting. He focuses on the scenery, which is all stuff he’s seen before, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t nice to look at. Cas is content to sit in silence, too, and Dean gets the impression he’s waiting for a lot more than for them to arrive at the antique store.
If he’s honest, his life is pretty much a chick flick, at this point. It’s— god, fuck it, it’s fucking awesome. Seriously. And Dean’s been getting kind of better of letting go of that Chuck Norris fantasy he held as a kid, uses his spare change to buy silly little socks and skinny jeans and his
Making food for everyone is pretty nice, actually, and he enjoys that. It’s an easy thought to hold onto, and to visualise, that he’d be happy doing this forever, keeping his family fed. He
“I always thought you wanted to get out,” Dean says, clenching his fists to keep himself in check. “Kinda figured I, you know, dragged you back in and never let you out.”
Clocking out at the bar after two drinks, he tells the bartender he’s gotta get back home to the old ball and chain. Doesn’t even think about it, just says it, and wonders what it means that this thing apparently goes both ways.

, or whatever. He always looked a bit too much like Mom, had eyes a bit too big and lips a bit too pouty. Dean resolutely avoids the mirror, but that means looking at Cas.
“Then I will,” he says, and it’s as simple as that. They hold each other’s gaze for a moment before Dean huffs again, breathless, and there’s no way this is his life, there
Dean has seen, obviously, ghosts before. Hell, he’s even seen Bobby’s face walking around on his Apocalypse World counterpart, so it shouldn’t really be a shock. But— maybe Cas has a point, when he talks about seeing souls. Because— it’s Bobby, alright.
“Yeah, I got that.” He manages to glance over at Cas for a second, even though it hurts his eyes. “You aren’t exactly, subtle, dude.”
He’s thinks she’s pleased. Her lips kind of twitch upwards, anyway, a bit like Cas does sometimes, and she shrugs again. “Whatever. I’m gonna go talk to Jo. She’s cool.”

“It’s a Heath Ledger thing,” Dean admits, because he can say it like that, if he tries. He rolls the jacket back up, tucks it away on the bottom shelf.
“Alright,” says Cas, and turns a page in his paper. He looks like a grandad. It’s embarrassing, how much Dean wants to jump his bones. In a normal, friends helping out friends kind of way, obviously. Like Benny in Purgatory.
He touches his hand to his heart. “Faith is in all of us. In ourselves, in others, in our families. Aren’t they worth more than an absent father? It’s time for the story to end.”
“Yes, that’s right,” says Cas, dully into his phone, and Dean nudges his knee with his under the table in sympathy. Cas turns his long-suffering gaze on him, which Dean grins at, and pushes the fries over to him. He minds the paperwork strewn about as he does so, and Cas takes one. He sighs out his personal details to the service worker, the fifth time in twenty minutes, and Dean winces. This is why he lives illegally.
“How was lunch?” asks Jack while the episode loads, shifting to get comfortable. He tucks his legs up underneath him, a little human gesture that makes Dean’s heart constrict in his throat. Jesus, but this is his
, he thinks. Dean follows him for a half a step before getting with the program and pulling himself up, and now their faces are… close.  Very close.
To Sam’s credit, he does a pretty good job of looking bewildered by this whole line of questioning. “I’m not joking,” he says, not unkindly. He straightens up a little bit, rights his posture like he does when he thinks they’re having a moment, suddenly going serious. “What’s going on, Dean?”
Dean is hungry and Cas newly human, so he doesn’t really have a choice when it comes to making breakfast. He feels humiliated and also like he fucked up, but he’s not even sure
be like that, and Sam grimaces from sheer second-hand embarrassment, and Dean’s mouth just keeps on running: “His mom fucked the president, who was possessed by Lucifer at the time. It’s a thing. We dealt with it.”
“Oh,” Cas says, and smiles. It wouldn’t look like a smile on anyone else, just the barest uptick of his mouth, but Dean knows. “Alright.”
of course, is in, like, dude-on-dude love with him, but Dean guesses that’s… fine. He’s not, like, reeling with disgust, or anything. It doesn’t bother him. It
“No, man. This is up to Jack, I get it. I’m just— I dunno. I kind of liked the idea that, after I died, I’d get to see, you know— Mom again. Bobby. You, when you eventually had a death that stuck.”
They argue about this until all the groceries are put away, and then Dean snags a beer and goes to sit on the porch and do some soul searching, because he can’t handle being around Cas, right now. Sam goes to meet up with Ellen and Jo at their motel and set them up with some ID and phones, and Dean’s glad at least one of them can be useful, because he certainly can’t. He thinks about Charlie, picking at the label of his beer. He’s got no idea how to contact her, but she’s a smart cookie, so she’ll be fine. He hopes.
He risks another glance at him. Cas seems to be considering it thoroughly, and Dean realises it’s probably the first time he’s ever had the choice to. Cas wants like crazy, he always has, but usually they’re impulsive decisions, like wanting to become God. If Cas wants something he goes for it, whether that’s raw meat or free will, or anything except Dean, apparently (but he’s not thinking about that, he’s not
“Jesus,” laughs Dean, neck hot as everyone else joins in, but he’s grinning, too. Of course he is. He waggles his eyebrows at Cas, and Cas takes him by the jaw, and kisses him soft and sweet, and also a little dirty. His ring his cool against Dean’s cheek. Dean smiles into it, slings his arm round his shoulders, and holds Cas close. There’s cheers. Dean pulls away beaming.
about it. He rarely does. Those weeks after his death just bled into one another, fuelled by Dean’s single need that this
“Okay,” he says. “But I’m just saying that it’d be fine, if you wanted to shack up with him. In a way more than whatever you’ve got going on right now, I mean. Nobody’d give two craps about it, Dean.”
Cas sighs. “I don’t have time to give a lecture on quantum physics and their relationship to the zeroth dimension, Dean. I thought we were in a hurry.”
Dean had swallowed, cleared his throat, watched Cas’ eyes linger on where his fingers touched skin. “Well, geez, Cas. You sure know how to make a girl feel special.”

that the pie was too good to be true, the call-back to their first vamp case. He could let Sam take him to the hospital, bleed out on Baby’s backseat yet again, get himself stitched up and then drag himself back onto the road, follow it to the next case. He could keep following the beats.
“Just humour your dad, hon,” she says, handing over something for Dean to sign, “he’s probably just excited he’s going to look as cool as you.”
Well, that’s not true. Sam catches him by the arm as he’s following Cas from Jack’s room, face and voice solemn, and Dean feels really shit for the whole barn SNAFU, and for being such a selfish dick about it.
“Thank you,” Cas says, like they aren’t standing in front of the bathroom mirror and he couldn’t have done it himself. They’re going out on a case, which is rare as hell as of late, so Dean’s in his nice blue suit for the first time in a while and he’s pretty sure the shoulders no longer fit right.
“That’s why I didn’t— I needed you here, to get you in. The Empty can’t reach Earth unless summoned, you had to enter it through Heaven. It was the only way and that’s why I— that’s why I couldn’t move the rebar. I’m sorry.”
also i know dean said that thing ab angels and labels but um. cas is gay hes the gay angel and i love him SO fucking much. bitchy castiel my beloved
He never said he wasn’t a coward. He gets back to his feet, knees cracking as he does so, and offers his palm to Cas. There’s been a lot of moments, over the years, that have felt heavy and weighed down with meaning, moments when Dean was sure he was half a moment from doing something important, and this is one of them. This time, though, he’s got free will. And Cas is a lot more important than orange juice.
“I’m not denying anything,” Dean says, and for once it’s actually true. He’s lost Cas enough times to recognise the beats of his own grief, and he’s pretty sure that he went through all six of them on that goddamned drive the night of. It’s not
“I was thinking I’d run to the store later,” says Dean, after, while he washes and Cas dries. Considering they’re doing an activity
That’s how Bobby finds him, trudging up the porch steps in his soaked t-shirt, and grumbling a little. Dean cracks a grin.
“Yeah. About, like, what happens now, or whatever. He wants to set up this hunter network with Eileen, use the resources in the bunker to actually help people. Sounds pretty awesome.”
Admittedly, Dean probably doesn’t cut a good figure, hiding on the roof in the dark with his single LED lantern, like Batman.
, and Dean’s just waiting for Cas to drop, now. Although— angel booster-shots have to exist, right? Maybe he’s fine.
He’s saved by Ellen and Jo splitting to go stay in a motel and the rest of them trying to figure out where the hell they’re going to sleep. Claire, for all her gruff exterior, seems pretty put out at having to go home, and it turns out her and Jody have got overnight bags in the trunk; Claire colours, a little, at that, like the worst thing in the world is the rest of them realising she wants to stay in their company. Dean’s heart aches a bit, but also, he
“Hell,” says Dean, a little breathy, and feels the way his heart wants to give out in his chest. He steadies a swaying Cas, who’s looking pretty woozy, and the reality of what just happened crashes into him full-force, because if Cas is here that means it
“Yeah,” says Dean. He chances a glance at her, but she’s clenching the crayon tight in her fist, chewing on her lip. Dean sympathises. Claire is, probably, the only person who’s got a mile on him for most complicated relationship with Cas. There’s a lot of betrayal in there, a lot of love, a lot of hate. She probably outstrips him, actually; Dean’s feelings are pretty unconditional. “He’s fine, Claire.”
this, not anymore, he’s better, he can do better. “That sounds good, Cas. You— yeah. If that’s what you want.”
They do. Dean’s not sure what’ll happen tomorrow, or a week from now, but at least whatever future he’s got is of his own fucking making. They’ve got half a dozen newly revived friends to sort out, Dean’s going to have to talk to his mom at some point, and there’s that house to figure out, because Dean’s honestly not sure how the hell they’re going to get around the legal stuff that comes along with it. A presumed dead serial killer and fallen angel of the lord don’t exactly have a good joint credit score. Charlie’ll probably have to help, and Dean’s so, so glad that she’s back. It’s awesome.
“I’m the new God,” says Jack, matter of fact, and Dean takes a discreet step back. It’s not that he wants to throw Jack under the bus, or anything, but he’s just barely keeping himself together right now, and it feels easier to let Jack handle this one, because Cas is going to be
“Hmph,” says Claire. She draws a five-pointed star in black, as Dean tries to figure out how the hell to connect with this twenty year old who never learned anger management. Not that Dean has a leg to stand on.
cries Charlie, and throws her arms around him. “Did you necromancer me? I thought I was so totally done for and then I just
Dean’s fault, that Bobby died. If he hadn’t relied on him so damn much, Chuck wouldn’t have needed to cut him out to isolate them both.
does it. Cas gives her a pleased smile, ignorant entirely of the fact that Dean is about to burst into flames.
And eventually he picks up some more of those black leather bands from a hippie surfer shop and wears those too. When Jack and Cas go on a kick of making friendship bracelets by themselves, he’s the one who gets to keep all the duds, the ones that have messed up patterns and knots in the wrong places. He keeps wearing Mom’s ring, and when summer hits, he goes out in his t-shirt and a two dollar bracelet from
Dean doesn’t stop for a whole freaking week. He’s cooking chilli that first night and getting everyone settled, and then the next day Eileen’s due back from her hunt, which Dean doesn’t actually know about until he comes out into the foyer and finds Sammy waiting by the door at least fifteen minutes in advance, fidgeting with the cover of his phone, popping the corner on and off.
“The sentiment’s pretty nice,” he says, eventually. “Maybe you and I should get a couple, huh? Best friends for life. Could get some of those dorky little friendship necklaces, you know the kind with the split heart? Or BFF rings, or whatever.”
At some point, Dean realises that Cas has stopped. He’s kneeling down by the bottom shelf, and he hasn’t moved in like, a minute.
, not really, just his body responding like it would if he was in love, and this thought going through his brain that’s just
“How far along are you?” asks Dean eventually, and pushes his plate over without comment so Cas can try his burger. He cuts off a bit with his knife and fork, which is what he’s using to eat his own so he doesn’t greasy up his official new documents, and Dean would honestly be offended if it were anyone else, because cutlery and burgers shouldn’t even go in the same

He leans forward and bites on Dean’s lower lip to prove the point, and yep, that’s fucking dandy, that is, and Dean’s got no choice but to indeed shut the fuck up. It’s great. It’s awesome. He crowds Dean up against the wall, and Dean’s body is fucking
“There’s nothing wrong with how you eat,” Cas had said, and they were no longer about to drift off into an afternoon nap, because Cas was getting all righteous, and over
, and Dean nearly drops it. “Because the last thing I remember I was shot to high hell, and now I’m standing in my house that I
Dean’s spent a lot of his life on the road. His whole childhood was just one big drive to nowhere, and he's carried that over into adulthood, chasing an end he’s yet to meet. He’s had a lot of shitty nights, nights where he’s been bleeding out or Sam’s crashed in the backseat with a concussion, when he’s driven twelve hours without stopping and his eyes have started to burn in their sockets. Driving back from Stull Cemetery was high up there as one of the worst drives of his life, but this one right now? It takes the fucking cake.
The antique store is a quaint place off the side of the road, and it’s not really the kind of place that Dean would visit usually, but he does a lot of stuff he wouldn’t otherwise, for Cas.
“I warned you,” Cas says, his fingertips brushing Dean’s forehead, brow pinched like Meg Ryan. Dean feels the spark of grace and his headache eases a little, though the ringing is going to
“I can see the grief plaguing it, Dean,” continues Cas, soft. “It’s pained, and battered, more so than when I last saw you. Damage has been wrought on it.”
He feels like a teenager. He feels reckless and giddy and it weirds Claire out, but he keeps his mouth shut about it, because he doesn’t need to turn a kid into his damn therapist. He’s
“I guess,” says Dean, not really seeing how this makes a Yahtzee, “But that’s ‘cause the truck’s all the way in the distance.”
in his arms. He’s back in Heaven, which doesn’t bode well for being alive in the real-world sense, but for all intents and purposes, Dean’s alright.
“See you soon, okay?” says Dean, seriously. “Keep your eye out for what kind of car you’re lookin’ for, and we’ll see what we can do.”
He feels kind of lesser, somehow. Disappointed. Still, that’s a risky thought, so he shoves it far, far under a whole other load of crap, dredging up half a smile.
The lady behind the counter initially thinks they’re there for Claire, which is funny, because she’s literally dragging her feet along behind him, and Dean’s getting a kick out of it. She tugs her hood up over her head like he’s embarrassing her, which is about ninety percent of the reason Dean suggests she gets one too.
Dean lets him. He lets himself be kissed, by Cas, and when Cas starts to pull away, his thumbs dragging slowly across Dean’s cheekbones, Dean pushes himself up onto his toes and makes sure he goes fucking nowhere.
Dean looks back at him. “Goody for you,” he says, grinding his jaw. He’s annoyed, and he doesn’t want to be, but he is, and he doesn’t know
(Actually, he could. He did, loudly and often. But it was what Cas wanted, for Dean to take it, and for Dean to give it back. It made him happy. Dean can almost accept it, when it’s framed like that. Pretty much all he wants now is for Cas to get what he deserves).
“I wanna go to the beach,” he says. “I ain’t ever been, and I think Jack’ll love it, and Sam and I have always said, you know, that we would. We’ll bring Eileen, too, and Claire, if she wants. Mom and Bobby. I just—”
“Son of a bitch,” says Dean, and throws a sock at him. “Fucking Christ, you angels, you’re all so damn— fine, wear my holey socks, then, see if I care. Raid my whole fucking wardrobe while you’re at it, I’m going to go make dinner.”
“So,” he says. “So, when’d you realise that I meant it, like— like you do. Because I gotta be honest, I figured it out, like, yesterday.”
Dean picks Cas’s burger up with his hand, because he’s not an idiot, and takes a bite— it’s pretty good. The mayonnaise runs down his fingers so he licks it off when he’s done, and Cas makes a resigned sort of face that suggests he’s maybe reconsidering their arrangement. Relationship.
Dean chuckles, and offers Bobby the beer he was going to open after this one. Bobby takes it, settling down in the chair beside him, and it’s surreal, that they’re here together. Dean’s still getting used to seeing him alive, keeps finding his gaze catching on him every now and then, because Bobby’s a death he never really processed, not properly, and now he doesn’t have to.
“That’s right,” says Jack. “Having souls together increased the risk that they would discover they were in Heaven, and attempt to fight it. People don’t tend to be fond of being dead, regardless of how happy they are.”
