‘Where did you meet him?’ Greg asks
‘Why did you get this?’
“Mycroft was right!”
‘I still think you should talk to him. I mean...you didn’t even tell him you’re sorry Sherlock.’
‘No, John… I actually broke up with Jane.’
‘You were just showing off…’
‘Yeah..they’re quite similar..’
‘What made him change his mind?’
John is somewhat awake while lying in bed, while Mary is completely passed out.
‘A fake name.’
Victor smiles, trying to keep off that embarrassed and frozen look on his face, goes toward the kitchen, whispering in Sherlock's ear ‘This is harder than I expected’
"I do...I got the tape." She looks at him surprised.
FROM: SHERLOCK
‘That one was for you’
At the doorway  Tanaka calls out one last pleasantry ‘If you need help you know where you can find me.
Greg smiles ‘You two act like an old married couple’ shaking his head.
‘Let me see..’
My stomach hurts from laughing so hard
‘Yes.’
Mycroft attempts again, voice deepening due to his frustration, ‘When exactly’
‘and…..when I moved here.....London wasn’t like this.’ showing his hand around, turning.
"John, come on, what are you doing" Greg closes the door in front of him.
Just turn around nooow
Sherlock walks out his room, closing the door and pressing the alarm’s code. Then takes the coat and scarf in the living room and checks the program on his pc, and quickly leaves.
‘Ok..ok…just..tell me what I have to do’
‘This toast is for…’
‘Before talking about Mary, you told me that you had to say something…is it right?’
“Why you ask me if you already got everything, it’s annoying.” Sherlock turns nervously sitting on the sofa.
‘Do you want me to come with you then?’ he asks, stroking Sherlock’s cheek with one hand, and kissing him gently.
‘Oh, good Lord...’
He closes his eyes,putting his fingertips together in their typical prayer-like position while thinking.
‘KEPT THINKING I COULD NEVER LIIIIVEE WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIIIIDEEE.’
‘Give me one day, Inspector, and I’ll give you Moran’
John stands still for a few seconds, than sips ‘Sherlock, did you know about the books?’
Mycroft ‘Still remember it, actually’ commenting in the background.
(4:38 pm)
‘What?’ The man stridently demands.
‘Yes, you do!’ Greg laughs.
John cracks a sharp laugh, replying, ‘Just what I said, why do you call him Myke?’
‘Why?’ he asked.
Molly: 'We talked about many things!! He was sweet, and nice'
‘So…what do we do now?’ Greg asks
‘I wouldn’t be surprised’
Mycroft looks at him, then glances down, taking a long breath ’...When Sherlock finished college, he didn’t want to go to university, ....he preferred studying by his own, doing his experiments in his room. But father signed him up at Chemistry University....’
‘The shirt is dirty.’ Sherlock struggles to announce, voice sounding like a scratched CD.
‘The tiger, we need to find the tiger!’
Greg turns, frowning in desblief, with a hint of a smile.
‘I bet this will bring more readers to your blog, John. You’ll be happy’ Sherlock comments looking at the newspaper.
Sherlock smiles, giggling, then turns around and goes under the sheets
Silent, again. They stare at each other, then Sherlock glances down, thinking.
‘FUCK GREG! FUCK YOU FUCKING ANSWER THE FUCKING PHONE!
To : Sherlock
Sherlock, surprised “Where? we need you, we must go to Sarah’s family, you know her, you can help us!”
They both slowly walk toward Sherlock’s bedroom, Mycroft supporting his brother as he limps. Eyes half-closed, the bags under them almost black, Sherlock’s mouth dry lips tremble. Greg and John watch on silently, palms sweaty and stiff, as the Holmes boys disappear behind the door.
‘And then she walked out..’
John slowly turns toward Greg, speaking slowly in a lower creepy voice ‘are you serious?’
‘Obviously!’
John is quickly running out of breath, and huffs though sharp inhales, ‘I can’t see him anymore, Sherlock!’
Greg grabs his coat from the sofa, shrugging it over his shoulders, ‘Don’t worry. Let me do it. I’ll be back soon.’
‘What did he say?’
Then he lies down with his knees on the bed ‘Now put two fingers near your mouth….’ ‘Why do you close your eyes?’
‘What message?’ John chirps to his back.
TO : MH
One….
Takana or Tanaka?I still don’t get it.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, then starts mumbling words ‘wh…….what-‘
‘He clearly didn’t sleep! The room was perfectly made, in fact it’s cleaner than it was before he checked in.’
Sherlock continues to munch on the candy but gives her a deliberate nod. ‘Yes, why shouldn’t I be?’
‘Wait…what books?’ John asks
'John!!!'
SH 23:35
They should meet the real one.
‘The titles are A Study in Scarlet, based on A Study in Pink, then The Blind Banker, The Great Game, like the two cases about Moriarty…then A Scandal in Bohemia, not in Belgravia, and The Hound of the Baskervilles, because the Baskervilles is a family’s name, and then The Final Problem..about Reichenbach ’
Mycroft helps Sherlock to take his clothes off, tidying them up and putting them on the draw set by the sink. Holding Sherlock by his arms, Mycroft aids his brother into the bathtub. Concerned, he resignedly murmurs, ‘Be careful.’
‘Sherl-‘ suddenly Lestrade opens the bedroom’s door and stands still for few seconds, astonished, not saying a word, his mouth wide opened in shock
‘I’m not pretending I’m just saying that… why do you say I’ve changed? What are you referring to?’
‘Sherlock, I told you- you must inform me when you get this kind of information. The police can start doing a proper search if you tell us ASAP.’
‘Yes, I need chocolate biscuits please.’
‘have you read the poetry I left in your book?’
Lestrade leans against doorframe, and watches the pair leave.
Mary: ‘Just be the John Watson I used to know’
Sherlock “We need to talk"
“It’s beautiful, and I know it’s too late now. Sorry if I never read it. I know you felt bad every time I told you I didn’t read it. Sorry if I didn’t care. Sorry if I never cared as much as you cared.”
TO : JW
‘Hilarious! You normally never would have asked me to go out so late, that’s why I worried.’
John looks at Sherlock, who’s chatting on his phone, his head down
FROM: MARY
Sherlock huffs out, annoyed ‘Again?!?! Why are you asking me about John again? I already told you he’s not gay, he’s married!!!’
After dancing a bit, he sits on the sofa, and takes out his five-pound note. He starts to roll it, still singing.
‘No, Baker street is good, I’ll come tomorrow morning, about 9, okay?’
Mrs Hudson jumps and flails, going away. "Somebody is at the door, better check it..."
To: Mary
JOHN : ( smiling sarcastically and nervously)  HE!.....who knows….
Sherlock doesn’t see him as he watching John close the door behind him, and Greg starts washing his left arm, looking annoyed.
Greg races down the streets as fast as he can with one hand; the other has his phone pressed to his ear.
Mrs. Hudson comes back into the kitchen ‘So…who’s it from?’ She asks curiously.
‘I believe he’s pretty pissed.’ Greg replies.
‘Oh sure, they’re over here’ She points down the row, ‘There’s Simpsons chocolate biscuits, or Hello Kitty, Oh the Animal Bites are new, and there’s the happy hippo ones….‘
‘You know who I’m talking about, .....the guy who suddenly has become Sherlock’s center of the world, who suddenly has caught his attention, God knows where the hell does he come from...he sends Sherlock thousands of messages everyday, makes him surprises, buys him breakfast, leaves him love letters, Greg finds him in Sherlock’s bed...I see him everywhere! Every time I come at Baker Street I see his smiling face running upstairs,....and Sherlock seems to be always busy because of him,...and he was with Sherlock the night he got overdosed, and now he’s involved in the Moran case. I don’t know who’s him, Mycroft, neither what he has to do with Sherlock, ...and I’m sure you know things better than me ...’
'What was it?'
‘they’ll arrive soon’
Sherlock’s phone rings again, John looks at it on the table.
‘You don’t know anything.’ The man says, his expression and tone dulling significantly, as he calms.
A guy is waiting near the open door, workmen walking inside to bring new furniture and packed boxes.
What?????
‘I can perfectly manage the case and Moran without Secret Services stalking around my house’ He comments annoyed, raising his voice, then looks at Mary with a hint of embarrassment.
‘Why?’
‘no,…ok,..you want to take some…promotional pics? You examining some…..blood or anything with tube crash?Like h
TO : MH
John looks at the woman on the door entrance ‘yes!!!….sure’ He runs inside, following Sherlock.
John leans forward up into the front, grabs the phone, and answers it, ‘Mycroft! It’s John.’
John keeps silent, glancing down. ‘....Victor is using Sherlock, he knows he can do whatever he wants with him just because....Sherlock wants to distract himself...but I think he has to do with Sherlock’s overdose, and I think you should investigate about it.’
TO: JOHN
"What are you talking about? Is it about me??"
He steps back inside his office, and reads the note attached,
‘Yes, you did’ He keeps kissing Sherlock’s back, slowly.
Sherlock turns looking at John and smiles at him ‘Hi John’ then he quickly takes his phone and the jacket
‘But Sherlock doesn’t have friends, Mary! You know it too.’
‘Where’s this man we’re looking for?’ Greg shouts in Sherlock’s ear.
The doorbell chimes again.
Sherlock doesn’t take his coat off and sits on his chair, taking his scarf off, holding in in his hands. He looks at Mycroft nervously.
"You think Sherlock doesn't love you back?"
‘No, not yet.’
‘Did you go on with the case?’
‘What the hell are you doing here??’
‘Friends?’
Greg turns back toward Sherlock.
Sherlock and John share a nervous glance, but then simultaneous swallow their shots.  John’s eyes bulge at the sharpness of the alcohol, and shakes his head in a failed effort to clear the fog that suddenly envelopes him. Sherlock isn’t used to the burning sensation hard liquor brings, and his head begins to throb, as bile threatens to surface.
Mycroft sits on the sofa next to the fireplace, ‘Tell me…’
A man walks out Sherlock bedroom’s door, looking at his phone on his hands, not noticing John’s presence in the apartment.
‘Could you please bring the trash out?’
‘My brother was innocent! He didn’t have anything to do with Moran!’ The boy defensively rumbles at Sherlock.
‘I’ll give you another bottle, it’s a little…present, you know...do you want anything to eat?’
‘Hey!' Victor shows up in the corridor ‘I prepared a beautiful savory stuffed roll, it’s almost finished.’
Mycroft takes him by his chest and brings his right arm on his shoulder.
Sherlock follows the smaller blonde as he hails a cab, and keeps watch until it pulls away with John inside.
TO : MH
Mycroft peers at his brother, smiling ‘You put on two kilos since you acquainted with--’
‘You brought me here because you told me he was dead!! Can you hear me,Greg?’
‘Did you talk to Tanaka?’
John can’t stop himself from moaning, his mouth falls slack as he murmurs, ‘Sher…ohh...’
John turns to stare out the window, rolling Greg words around his mind.
'That was the worst surprise party someone has ever done' John comments bitterly, Greg next to him, both are sitting on the terrace with two bottles of beer.
Greg returns the kind gesture, stressing, ‘Sherlock needs rest. He has had a trying time lately.’
‘So how could John be ther-‘ he suddenly realizes, opening wide his eyes
‘Really?’ Greg looks equally surprised.
‘So it seems’ John replies, smiling and looking at him.
John looks at Sherlock and at the red spot.
John keeps silent for few seconds ‘So...it...wasn’t Victor?’
TO: JOHN
John sits again on the corner of the bed. ‘Well they had a quarrel…last night, and he called me because he needed help, you know...’
John keeps starting at Sherlock, waiting for an answer.
They walk in opposite directions.
FROM : MH
TO: Myke
John brushes a hand along Sherlock’s right cheek ‘Why did you stop?’
Greg goes toward the door, looking suspiciously at John ‘You’re not going to organize a surprise party for me, right?’
Suddenly John freezes.
‘Cake?’ Mary suggests.
Victor, from the kitchen ‘Tonight there’s the Sherlock show on tv’
The clapping ends and everyone in the ballroom, sits in pensive silence.
‘Checking….a thing’
From : Sherlock
FROM : Lestrade
The woman nods, not speaking, taking the napkin and lowering her head. Mary holds her hand “Be strong, I’ll do my best to bring Daniel home. I promise it.”
‘Nothing, I’ve already said.’
‘Why? You said I’m angry with you?’
"I didn't expect you here"
‘Yes, Adair wrote him this code to tell Tanaka he was hiding something in the hotel room, Tanaka disassembled and assembled the room but never found it, because Adair hide it outside the room, on the balcony’
‘Give me the phone, give me the damn phone!’
‘I’m not apologizing...I’m just…realizing now that maybe he did take something. I wouldn’t have considered it before, but now…’ he trailed off, looking forlornly over at Sherlock. ‘It was hard to understand him even when we lived together. And it’s even harder now that we live apart from one another.’
John turns, giving Mycroft a nasty look. 'He hasn't opened it yet, Mycroft!'
Molly is sitting on the backseat, in the center, looking straight at the street, a bit embarrassed for the silence , Greg drives tapping with his fingers on the steering wheel, and moving his head at time while listening to the music, then turns the volume up.
‘I’m in my car outside your apartment’
John takes a long breath “the map we found...in the hotel, with the tape-"
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
FROM: John
‘SHERLOCK OVERDOSED!’
‘No’ he says, shaking his head.
‘Marry Christmas’
Jeremy Brett smiles "I'm proud to portray such a genius and great human being. I'm not sure we're going to see him, tonight. He hates it!" He laughs. "But I'd be glad to meet him, one day."
"No, because every time i'm with you it happens that you start talking about Sherlock and feelings, and what I should tell him...and you drag me into this, and I don't want it to happen again."
“...because mycroft made her name?"
John takes time, breathing deeply, biting his lower lip while looking at Greg “Do you remember when this case started and we were in your office and you asked me to come back with Sherlock after he came back from death?”
‘It wasn’t working; she was always upset with me. She said that I never had time for her, and that I was always ready to help my friends, answer to all their calls, but that I didn’t do the same for her, you know. So…’
Sherlock turns to face John.
‘He died 2 years ago…. ‘
John does not agree, ‘Do you want me dead?’
Sherlock frowns, confused, then walks slowly toward him, almost whispering “You chose to love her.”
“I know, he didn't say anything cause he didn’t want to worry us...He’s got cancer. He must have surgery this week, he discovered it late that's why they decided to operate him immediately. If the operation goes well, he’ll need months of chemotherapy,...it won’t be easy.”
He does not gain an answer.
‘No no no no, I’m going to handle this’ he puts his finger on Sherlock’s mouth, hushing him, then sits on Sherlock’s knees, starting making him an hand job, slowly rubbing his dick up and down, Sherlock starts moaning ‘Ooohh—‘
Victor "Tell me what?"
“Oh, Sherlock” she cries, hugging him tightly. “Thanks for calling me, I’m glad I can be with you in this hard time, I just can’t find the words for what happened to Victor.."
FROM: JOHN
TO: JOHN
‘Are you sure?’
‘Next one?’
‘I want people to watch us.’
John nods, thinking ‘…incredible…’
John slowly opens the door, looking at Mycroft and Sherlock hugging and crying together.
‘Do you remember when somebody wanted to write a book? I remember’ Greg asks before tipping his glass back again.
‘Yes, to be honest it’s not 100% guarantee that you’ll not get diseases or infections. I mean you could still get a fever after the vaccine, but we decided to…’
‘Greg! I swear to God it’s Greg!’
‘Shhhh…relax.’
Mycroft insists “Why did you leave the case?”
‘He has a wound on his right leg. When EMS arrived he was passed out. He must’ve fainted right after the attack. Shock, most likely. It was probably the blood-loss that did it, as he had no serious head wounds, just minor lacerations. Which is amazing, as he was right in the middle of it all.’
Then his hand goes down on Sherlock’s dick, starting rubbing it fast, Sherlock stands up a little, his hands on the couch, they both moan loudly, until they reach the orgasm and come. Sherlock lies on the couch, exhausted, gasping, he’s on him, his head near Sherlock’s, whispering into his hear ‘well…that….was…….fun’ cracking a laugh
‘That’s why it’ll take few minutes, come on, get into the car’
‘Oh dear God,’ John moans and covers his face with his free hand as the opening bars to music filter through the enormous speakers.
A 40s short blonde woman opens the door. ‘Sherlock Holmes??you are….the detective??’ She asks, surprised.
‘I was right here, here is where I live…’
‘Nope!’ ‘Why? I’m useless anyway.’
‘Is this why my brother surround me of cctv?’
An opened suitcase is on the sofa, full of shirts and trousers. Mycroft is arranging his sweaters on the table. Sherlock enters in the living room, he looks gloomy. He notices the suitcase on the sofa, snapping at his brother. “You’re not going on holiday, Mycroft. it’s a hospital, you won’t wear your ties.”
‘That’s why he was here yesterday, he wanted to tell me he’s moving here’ Sherlock smiles nervously ‘And he thinks I’ll let him enter into my flat and sleep upstairs?!??!’ cracking a laugh.
‘Oh, I see, he popped up at your door.’ Mycroft grins, leering at his brother, ‘What did you tell him?’
“John, wait!”
To : John
Sherlock looks away, sadly. "John,..if only I had known-"
‘Could you pass me the mayo Greg?’ Sherlock asks loudly
Moran changes his entire identity, face, name, and stalks into London. Then two years after Adair comes back to London to meet Moran, but is afraid Moran will kill him, so he leaves a message with his friend Tanaka in his hotel room ‘Jack the Tiger’, and few hours later, Adair is found dead.’
Victor grabs her. 'Are you okay?'
‘Adair met a man the day he died named Woodley,who works at the Ku Club in Tottenham. I booked a table for this evening.’
‘What has my brother done this time?’ Sherlock asks looking at Lestrade.
‘Are you laughing at his jokes, too?’ Victor asks, rising his voice, visibly annoyed and offended.
‘Oh, it’s not worth it for Trevor, you can follow him on his Twitter.’
John turns back, and shouts ‘keep me up with the case, if you find out something.’
‘John!!!!’
JW 22:49
‘So I thought it was destiny that was gently saying to me I had to take a break with men, so I decided I’ll focus on my work and myself’
From : John
‘I...’ he turns to Sherlock, then starts talking again ‘I was called by a man, one day..he said he knew who I was and my plan to go to London. He knew I wanted to meet Sherlock again, and he started talking about business...and money. We met one day outside a café, he said he knew that I wanted to open a winery in London, and he wanted to help me. He offered me hundred thousand pounds if I had given him informations about Sherlock’
Mrs Hudson goes toward the kitchen drawer making tea “hope Mycroft will find his medicines, I put them here..”
Sherlock opens it: it’s a map. There are signs and drawings, and on the bottom left there are 4 signs:
‘John, dear, send him a message, ask him when he’ll arrive’ Mary asks pointedly.
TO : John
"What?" John suddenly jerks "Oh yes, ehm...Victor. Victor got accused to be in contact with Adair..."
‘Now?’
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,
‘The guy is getting out’ Greg comments peering through the side windows, then they see Sherlock getting out.
‘Please, guys!! Stop it!! Could you..please stop this??’ John shouts, annoyed. Mycroft turns toward John, angrily.
‘Yes’ she smiles, ‘they’re lovely, aren’t they?’
Sherlock turns, surprised.
Everyone looks at Sherlock and suddenly cracks laughing, John almost choking on his beer.
‘That Moran killed Adair, that he’s still in London, and he’s looking for me.’
‘No, it’s about something else...can we meet in your office or..at the bar?’
Victor is lying on his bed, scrolling through his phone, sending a message to Sarah Sawyer
‘Yes, I know but we sorted it all out, it wasn’t as big of a deal as I thought.’
John has his hands covering his face.
They both look at each other, smiling.
Sherlock sprints toward the bar, John follows on his heels as always, as they turn right into a hallway.
John walks inside and into the living room.
They’re in front of a door, Sherlock knocks.
‘I know it, I already know this Greg, what are you talking me about?’ John cracks a laugh, a bit surprised, not understanding Greg’s intentions.
Sherlock turns to him, still lying on the sofa with the moleskine on his knees ‘He won’t?’
“He would have done anything for me...I didn’t deserve him...I didn’t deserve his love...I was selfish, it’s my fault.”
Who’s Jane?
Sherlock smiles at him, John quickly replies cynically 'I believe that’s exactly what Sherlock thinks.’
He cracks a laugh ‘what do you want to do? Cut my thumbs and count after how many hours I bleed to death? Or….poison me just to check if it works and then takes photos of my dead body?’
“I don’t recall that...."
Everyone ‘WHAT?’
Sherlock frowns, going in the living room.
He follows the assistant toward the biscuit shelving. Upon the reveal, Lestrade laughs so much so that his abdomen throbs with pain and his voice becomes strained.
‘and Mrs Hudson was cleaning the flat! The one you used to live in! do you remember it???’ he asks, surprised
(4:33 pm)
‘Why?’
‘Sherlock’ John beats Sherlock’s back with his right hand ‘Are you alright?’
JOHN : That bloody bastard, I’ll kill him. I swear
‘That night they didn’t’
Suddenly he gets a message.
He smiles, puts the Polaroid away and goes close to Sherlock ‘Cherie’ he takes the sheet out of the bed, uncovering him ‘What’s wrong with you, today? Why are you upset? Voulez- vous dire?’
To : Mycroft
‘At all’ faking a smile.
He comes back with a red marker; John gives the needle to Mycroft, and makes a small dot on Sherlock’s indicating the center of his heart.
“I saw a missed call before, sorry, I didn’t reply cause I was coming right here...”
‘That…guy I talked you about, the one I met in the bus’
Sherlock stares at Mycroft, sulking, then jumps out the sofa closing the suitcase “I’ll take you to the hospital”
‘Yes, but you know the concept is different, the real aim of the movie is to show the concept of hope, that’s what Gatsby embodies’
‘What photos?’ Molly asks
‘Okay, can you just please check the list again?’
I think you should take a vacation, dear brother. This wedding is clearly inducing a stress response.
"You don't know anything."
"I didn't expect you here" Sherlock admits.
(4:08 pm)
‘Well that’s another topic, because from her point of view she’s constantly hurt by a man who betrays her, her husband. She’s beautiful and rich, and she incarnates the dream Gatsby wants to reach, his vision of the American dream. She’s a victim of the two men, because one betrays her and the other one just wants her like a toy, because she reminds him of the past. And it doesn’t matter what’s her life about, what Gatsby wants is a life like the old days with her and I think she’s a victim of his obsessions, too’
Greg shakes, ‘If you’re okay….say something.’
‘For what?’
Cursing, John stretches again. He attempts to call Sherlock, but there is no answer.
FROM: JOHN
John laughs and pulls Sherlock’s shoulder toward the dance floor. Sherlock balks at the suggestion, so John grabs both his hands and tries to drag him forcibly.
TO : Mycroft
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
John cracks a laugh, mocking him “So why he met Adair the day before arriving to London?”
Mary looks at him trying to understand.
'No, no! Look beyond the fingers....Now tell me, how many you see'
‘That Moran is not dead!’ Sherlock yells.
“This is not true..”
‘Okay’
‘Thank you, John, that’s so kind of you’
‘Okay, okay..’ Greg tries to turn the radio off‘How the hell this thing work?????’
Something catches Sherlock’s eyes up on the stage and John follows his gaze. ‘No!’
“No, he won’t.”
FROM : SH
"What do you mean?"
"Mary is Moran."
‘I’m going to…have lunch now! Sherlock has to make those…boring researches about Seraphita names..so..I was wondering if you’ looking at Greg 'would like to have lunch with me?’
‘Then stop making the world think you actually are’
"Yes but you put all your wardrobe in there! The best thing you’ll wear is a pyjama!”
Are you sure he was okay?
JOHN : Cle---…..clean,...yes.
Greg replies, tone of voice heightening,
Tell him I’m sorry for what happened, will you?
‘He is… fine. Sherlock will be fine.’ Mycroft certifies, hands rose to keep the boys back.
‘It is over now - don’t worry. Let us go in to the bedroom. I’ll prepare you a bath-’
Mary laughs "Fantastic. Really nice story. What a drama queen, but I'll kill you, Sherlock, like I killed the rest of useless idiots who dared to go against me. "
‘These effects will pass, don’t worry, you’ll feel better soon’
‘I’m happy you’re back.’
FROM : MYCROFT
Mycroft laughs, shaking his head with disbelief. "..the fragility of the genius..”
Sherlock hums, ‘Possibly.’ He crosses his arms, smiling at John. Sherlock queries, ‘How is lunch?’
Greg ‘And you accepted’
‘Sherlock! Sherlock! What the hell happened Sherlock!’ He sees the powder, the rolled up pounds on the table, and understands.
John smirks “I do”
“Yes”
‘These are things Sherlock never knew nothing about, he has an idea of you that is not the real one! You should be angry with yourself! How could you keep all these feelings inside for so long not telling him the truth?’
Victor “what?"
Mycroft tries to turn the call down
Silent.
“Let’s go to Sarah’s family, if we find her, we’ll find Daniel too"
'He's stupid!'
"No, I haven't."
‘Best Man, Sherlock.’
‘Now please, we’re all worried about you, so just try to follow simple rules to come back healthy’
‘It’s from the Great Gatsby!’ John yells back, putting a hand on Sherlock’s lower back.
"Oh well,.I..just dropped by..you know." Greg answers, embarrassed.
Greg gives her a confused expression, ‘Sorry?’
Victor frowns nervously “What the hell are you implying?" rising his voice, looking at John “Are you out of your mind??” Victor stands up, hitting his hand on the table.
Sherlock is still shouting after him, ‘He told you everything, didn’t he? You and that arse with a
‘I mean about Sherlock. D’you, you and Mycroft maybe? I don’t know…’

“Victor!!!” The student reaches him, grabbing him by the coat “Professor Trevor!"
‘If you need anything… you know you can call.’
‘Ages’ he whispers, smiling.
To: Greg
‘Okay.’
‘Goodnight Molly!’
03, 07, 72
Sherlock ‘Of course’
"Then tell me your story."
‘And so you’re back!
Sherlock turns toward her, arranging the scarf ‘It was the alarm Mrs Hudson, it went on because Lestrade was inside’
The alarm program starts getting going.
‘fear that there are aliens lurking around every corner, fear that some little country that doesnʼt  believe in our way of life poses a threat to us.’
John suddenly shouts, annoyed, yelling ‘So why don’t you tell me??? Is it so hard to be honest and tell me everything?? I’m doing my best to come back with Sherlock, but it’s hard for me to help him if I don’t know who the hell is this man!’
Silent, again.
John smiles back, putting his hand on Greg's shoulder: 'Happy Birthday, my friend.'
No song tooooo siing
John’s forehead is pressed solidly onto the side Sherlock’s jaw, until he pulls it back to look up at his best mates closed eyes.
‘And I don’t think he even Googled that!’ Greg laughed at his own joke as he glances back to Sherlock who’s sharing a long look with John.
‘What?’
“He said that God sees everything...that he knows everything. Do you believe that?”
Mary is still surfing through the pages of the book, expressionless. A couple next to John give him a puzzled look.
‘Why? Why are you so interested? Why do you care about what I would do with him?’
John huffs out ‘Finally!’
FROM: JOHN
‘A fan!’ Mrs. Hudson replies excitedly.
‘Do you want the truth?’
They wait for the fellows, start following them. When they pass by the pub, both look through the windows, and scan the inside.
‘Don’t tell me you think you’re the only friend he has, John’
FROM : Greg
‘Oh…okay, yes, sure’ smiling nervously ‘So, how’s the rehab going?’
‘He’s dying!’ Mycroft answers annoyed.

Before he could finish her name, he hears what he instantly knows are the kitchen tiles beginning to explode, one after the other. Sherlock jogs back to see them cracking, and flying at him. He doesn’t know where to shelter from the strange occurrence so he barrels toward the sofa. Sherlock flings his body upon it, but not before a tile explodes and hits him in the calf. He covers his face with his arms; pieces of tiles are thrown everywhere, raising a gigantic cloud of dust. The tiles reach the mirror, shattering it and sending little shards all over the flat. Mrs. Hudson runs upstairs, shouting ‘Sherlock!’ When she makes it to the doorway, she freezes, and begins to cry. The tiles continue their mini-explosions in the kitchen, splintering the chairs and shoving furniture from the walls- then it all just stops. Sherlock springs up from the couch, to the chair, then the table. He stands there shocked, heavily breathing, assessing the mess and the damage everywhere.
‘What?’ Greg is shocked by Mycrofts’ suggestion.
‘Still for you’
Greg takes a slew of photos with his phone, ‘I fuckin...can’t’ he laughs as he shoots
The priest walks slowly through the altar, looking at the people in front of him. “Sarah was a 21 years old girl...and the Lord knows that someone is behind this tremendous murder of a young girl, whose only crime was to be in love with someone who made a mistake. But we must understand that there's someone else behind their actions: a young woman was dragged in a dangerous story, and she didn’t have any fault. She is a martyr, killed to hide a truth too disturbing to be told. A mouth was closed, but not the truth. Because one day, the truth will be revealed, and Sarah’s death will turn against those who committed it. If not in this life, then in front of the Lord. And he won’t forgive a young girl’s murder, whose life was full of hopes and dreams. May she rest in peace. Stand up.”
‘I think they’ll probably make it soon’ Molly comments smiling, ‘Do you know that Conan Doyle’s books are a bestseller this week?’
John doesn't answer, still staring at the man next to Sherlock.
"Why?"
"I'm just saying that you're a killer. A born killer. You've always been, and you'll be Moran for the rest of your life. Moving on with another name, changing your face and getting married with John, that's you trying to hide in plain sight. But you're not like everyone else. You're a killer, and you can kill me right now, and impress everyone at Scotland Yard, fool Lestrade and the police, and have John back, and get on living your life as a normal human being. But it won't change your nature. You really think your life would have worked?"
‘What do you mean?’ Sherlock asks.
'Can I eat with hands?'
To : Sherlock
She keeps walking, getting closer to her, answering kindly. “..yes,..I know, but I’m looking for Tatsuya Tanaka...is she there?
‘My brother gave this to me before flying away in Berlin,’ He says, a rolled sheet tightly clasped in his hands, ‘He told me I had to give it to you Mr. Holmes.’
“You’re talented, you know so many things, you’ll find a new job in two weeks."
“Oh wow,” John breathed heavily, his cheeks red, arousal clearly written all over his face and body.
“How can you know that?”
Lestrade was making phone to instruct his people, so Molly just bid them goodbye and watched them leave the morgue together.
Sherlock snorted. “In that case, I take everything I just said back and I will say it tomorrow anew because this is a terrible cliché.”
John smiled at him: “Hi there. How are you feeling?”
“I think it could be very nice,” John looked around, “very nice indeed.”
The librarian looked at him in awe. “That… was amazing.”
John leaned over the front desk and whispered: “Listen, Molly, can you do something for me? Can you bring me a coffee from the cafeteria?”
Sherlock looked alarmed. He leaned over the table and squeezed John’s hand.
Try as he might, Sherlock couldn’t extinguish the warmth he felt every time John complimented his intelligence when they got to chat about something random.
John’s eyes involuntarily skipped to Sherlock and Molly followed the movement.
A kick. And another. Giggling. He loses his balance.
The minute they were out of sight, John pulled Sherlock into an empty room, which happened to be a storage space for chairs and tables near the lecture hall.
“I really enjoy this,” Sherlock gestured at their mouths, “too.”
Holmes rolled his eyes but obliged. John observed him on the computer.
“He made his move and they kissed,” John chuckled. “You were right, he is right in the middle of a divorce. But he thought he doesn’t have a chance with Molly. When you left, he comforted her and well, you know...”
“Morning, sunshine, the library is closed.”
The librarian’s eyebrow shot up. “Whoa, slow down, please. First, I cannot type that fast; second, can I have your library card?”
John stole a glance or two and then turned to today’s task. He postponed this long enough. He eyed the trolley stuffed with leather-bound tomes and then looked at the place where these books belonged. Up. Way way up. Like 13 feet up. BSL was an architecturally interesting place (translation: it was a bloody nightmare). For the most part, it was a regular room, but it had a big nook that reached to the second floor. Two sides were walls mounted with shelves and two were glass panels so that the people sitting in the hospital cafeteria on the second floor could have a soul-elevating view of the old books when eating their croissants.
Sherlock blinked. “Bodies. Dead. Tissue samples. Some chemicals you can’t get over the counter.”
“Yes. Goodnight, John.”
The clock kept on ticking and Molly had to stop herself from biting her nails nervously because it would just distract Sherlock from thinking. John was watching the genius move around the room between the corpse and the notes once, twice, then held back Lestrade with a single look, because it was not time to ask questions yet. Both Molly and John were familiar with Sherlock’s need for his mental space before delivering an answer and wished for the best results at this moment.
“I did and he was so sur-” Sherlock’s words died mid-sentence as a big black car with blackened windows pulled over in front of them. His mood changed abruptly and his jaw clenched.
“Why not? There is a free seat over there.”
Another. A hand yanks out his hair, hard. The pain is sharp, he has to tilt his head back.
“Lab space and access to dead bodies donated in the name of science?”
“Are you alr- Jesus, Sherlock! What are you doing here?” John knelt by the other man. “You are soaked! You’ll catch your death!”
“Possibly. Given the place, I presume a business deal had gone wrong. I would check moves on her bank account and the cash flow. I don’t have enough data, however, I guess the victim and her mistress had a deal, diamonds possibly, then something went wrong and the victim wanted to sell the other short. Her lover knew about the hidden entrance, maybe used it for the secret meetings with the victim. This time, they argued, one pushed at another, the victim fell. Her lover panicked and left through the hidden corridor.”
Sherlock was a bit embarrassed and managed just: “It will do.”
John came back to the desk with an armful of books. Sherlock caught his eyes and John frowned.
John just grinned mischievously. No way he was going to reveal that it was the displays of Sherlock’s competence that affected him so.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“I hope you’re not asking me to get drugs!”
“...you didn’t!” John giggled.
John thought,
“What?”
“Yes, you git. I definitely will.”
John made two cups of tea and set them on the table. Then he shook Sherlock’s shoulder.
John heard Sherlock’s tiny gasp of surprise and then the genius caught up. John kissed him hungrily, suddenly needing to feel he is alive. He ran his hands through Sherlock’s curls and held them firmly as he licked his way to Sherlock’s mouth. John felt the long fingers digging into his sides, almost painfully, but the pressure was welcome.
“Can I just read the books here without… that?”
John found out he liked the job. It required some moving around but not much, so he could rest his leg. The presence of books around him was calming and he also got to meet people and help them with their enquiries, which was satisfying. He liked helping people.
It's a bit short but we will make it up to you, pinky promise.
“Why doesn’t he work with police if he’s so smart?”
“And... thanks for this,” he took the cup, downing it in one gulp, and made an appropriately disgusted face of somebody who just drank a cup of cold coffee with all the sugar at the bottom.
John’s protective instinct kicked in but Sherlock didn’t seem afraid, more like extremely pissed off, so he let him go. John didn’t see the interior of the car very well as it was dark, but he thought he spotted a man and a woman sitting there.
“No problem, we will get you one. You just fill,” he rummaged under the desk and pulled out a sheet of paper, “this. Here is a pen.”
“Oh God. I’m so sorry! I must have fallen asleep. How long did I-?”
Sherlock turned to his side abruptly and peered at John.
Sherlock realized he wouldn’t go away with it and spilt the beans. John just shook his head.
They continued making out as if their life depended on it until John’s hands moved lower and he squeezed Sherlock’s round arse. A startled muffled yelp interrupted their snogging and they split up.
He felt warm and it had nothing to do with the radiator nearby. He shook his head and dived into a forensics book.
“Shut! Up!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. Doesn’t happen every day that a complete stranger reveals your past to you, does it?”
“Dinner? I still owe you for this.”
“Let me first clarify that I did enjoy this. But what brought this on?” Sherlock inquired, his own cheeks and expression matching John’s.
. Could it be that Sherlock really considered that dinner as their date? What did he see in the shabby short librarian hiding here, as he correctly pointed out, from the world outside? That brilliant, gorgeous man in posh clothes with an even more posh accent and lips to die for? When John looked in the mirror in the mornings, all he saw was wrinkles on the forehead, bags under the eyes, ugly scar on the shoulder and soft belly. His clothes rendered him practically invisible, which was exactly what he wanted.
“What have you done, Sherlock?”
Startled, John turned and found Sherlock standing right there.
Holmes frowned.
“Oh. Thank you,” Sherlock sipped from the mug.
Sherlock would hurl the phone against the nearest wall, except he didn’t have spare money for a new one. He was seething. There he was, thinking that for once Mycroft would help him without imposing his demands on him. “Never again,” he told himself firmly.
The smiled briefly and started to prepare some tea.
The doctor stood up, went to the kitchen and hugged Sherlock from behind. The detective almost dropped his experiment when he felt the sudden hug from John; he was so concentrated that he hadn't noticed that his boyfriend entered to the kitchen.
"Well, with the facts you have given me, I would say that my little brother is suffering from a broken heart."
They remained like that for several minutes until Mrs. Hudson came in with a tray full of cookies, but just as she entered the room and saw the empty ring box on one of the armchairs, she left the tray aside and headed to where the two men were standing
John stared at Sherlock in utter amazement for a moment but it wasn’t possible not to laugh at the sight of it. Soon they were both giggling. Sherlock recovered first and, wiping the tears from his eyes, said: “I have to admit that Angelo is anything but subtle.”
John nodded: “Lead the way.”
They looked at each other, smiling. It seemed that neither of them wanted to go home. Sherlock got up first.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he didn’t even move. John quickly checked his pulse and breath and, relieved, searched him for injuries, finding none. He grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him firmly. Sherlock groaned.
“Nah. You can just wait,” John peered at the alarm clock, “half an hour.”
He turned his phone off because he really wasn’t in the mood to deal with his brother anymore. He had books to lose himself in and later some experiments to conduct. They were his life’s only joys, something his brother could not understand. He crossed the landing, for once without hearing steps behind the neighbour’s door.
“This will warm you up. Are you ready to talk about it?”
“You...Are...Brilliant,” John breathed between each press of his mouth that Sherlock reciprocated enthusiastically.
He gritted his teeth. “Shut up, Mycroft!”
“You aren’t climbing up there, with your leg.”
, said the annoyingly haughty voice in his head.
“Thanks, Mike, I really owe you.”
John nodded. Sherlock dialled a number. “Mrs Hudson, I’m calling you to tell you I’ve decided to accept your proposal, in case it’s still on the table. I can come around at noon if it is convenient for you? Great. See you there.”
With a resigned sigh, John handed him the book and quickly found out that if he got in trouble, it would be definitely worth it. From his spot on the floor, he had a perfect view of Sherlock’s long legs in fitted trousers. When Sherlock climbed up and down, the muscles on his thighs moved in the most interesting way. And God, that ass! How somebody so thin could have an ass so round, was beyond John.
Today, luckily, wasn’t that day. Sherlock was the first person waltzing through the door, curls bouncing and John found that he was genuinely glad to see the mad genius, as he began to nickname Sherlock in his head.
, Sherlock thought.
“Alright, we have to get you somewhere warm. Can you stand?”
The librarian looked shocked but quickly recovered: “I would really prefer if you didn't broadcast it so loudly, please. But how on earth can you know that?”
“How could you know that?”
John nodded.
the cleaning lady was supposed to have a day off the next day, so he had to make everything presentable for morning opening. Unless he wanted to get up an hour early and drag his ass to work and then clean, which was a pretty definite no in his dictionary, with the addition of some profanities.
Sherlock looked at him questioningly because he knew John had just lied to them but he was curious what John is up to.
“John,” he gasped and moved to grasp John’s head, to cup his face in his large warm hands.
The next thing John noted was the determined and a bit intimidating expression on the stranger’s face. And the set of sharp cheekbones. And his beautiful eyes, the colour of which John couldn’t pinpoint.
Sherlock huffed. “You’ve got a psychosomatic limp –
“Wait here, please, I will get the books we have here for you.”
"Why do you think it’s diamonds?”
“Your what?”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, visibly distressed.
John inhaled sharply as the tables were turned on him. He should have known that Sherlock was seeing right through him. He suddenly found hard to breathe, as if a firm band constricted his chest. His vision swam and a wave of fear crashed over him.
Trigger warning: memories of being bullied. If it bothers you, just skip the first part of this chapter.
John’s hands moved under the coat, rubbing at Sherlock’s chest and sides.
“It was me. I thought you even thanked me, you don’t remember?”
John sat abruptly on the bed, breathing rapidly, heart hammering in his chest. He had these nightmares almost every night but it wasn’t getting any easier. It took him a moment to remember that he is not alone. Sherlock was sitting up as well. He observed John with a worried expression.
Sherlock hailed them a cab as soon as they stepped out, gesturing to John to get in. He rattled facts about his cold cases with a complete disregard for oxygen and John interspersed it with awed interjections. He had already realized that praise was what made Sherlock tick and he wanted to milk the opportunity and get to know more about the extraordinary man.
John was still blushing when he reached the Barts main gate. But he felt really good about himself. He was so deep in his thoughts that he hadn’t noticed a big black car parked at the gate until a beautiful dark haired-woman got out and held the door open.
In the morgue, Molly was busy examining a new addition to their corpse collection. She waved them in. Sherlock was shifting uncomfortably, his coat was still a bit wet and he was aware of the residues of mud that he couldn’t brush off properly. He was also feeling weird being here after the yesterday scene. John elbowed Sherlock into his side and gave him a pointed look.
“Will you accompany me to see the flat then?”
“You said I had a therapist.”
At that moment, a young pathologist walked in.
John stepped in and placed his hand on Sherlock’s forearm.
“Molly!” John exclaimed. “How are you? I have got the studies you’ve requested.”
John had already noticed that Sherlock never ate or drink anything in the library. Of course, it was forbidden to snack over the books but the library had a nice corner where you could eat your sandwich without the necessity to leave the premises. And you could have a drink at your desk if it was secured against spilling. Sherlock didn’t drink even if he was sitting in the library all day. John marked it off as another one from the lanky genius’s eccentricities, of which he had more than enough.
“Oh, you again,” Lestrade fumed but it sounded good-natured. He handed one coffee to Molly, smiling at her.
Sherlock broke the kiss gasping for breath but immediately recaptured John’s lips. This time, it was exploratory, he nipped on John’s lips carefully with his teeth, their noses touching gently. John moved to kiss Sherlock’s face, nose and the perpetual frown between his eyebrows. Then they joined their foreheads, resting, just basking in each other’s presence.
John snorted. Sherlock picked up the menu.
Eventually, Sherlock stepped away from the corpse and smiled smugly, before promptly rattling off his deduction:
With Mike, it was even easier, a good-natured chap he was. He dismissed John’s concerns about Sherlock’s personality with a wave of his hand: “John, I teach here. I can manage one more arrogant sod, trust me. Give him my number and we will make it work.”
He looked around properly and found only one free spot in the middle of a group of students. He felt sick just from the thought of working there.
“I don’t think so,” said the rich voice behind him.
John sighed with relief. In fact, it was quite convenient because he had errands to run. Also, he couldn’t get that word out of his head.
“You can get many things if you know where and how. You would be amazed.”
“Can I study them here?” he asked when the librarian returned with four books in one hand, leaning on the cane.
“Oh,” Sherlock made an utterly adorable face of sudden understanding and nodded. “I guess I was in my mind palace.”
, he thought.
That's all, folks :) thank you for reading and for leaving such lovely comments. We hope you enjoyed reading the story as much as we enjoyed writing it.
Too soon were all the books properly stacked and Sherlock climbed down. John cleared his throat.
Two hours or so later they were standing in front of the restaurant, waiting for a cab.
“I cannot work here,” Sherlock sounded distressed even to his own ears.
“Then this hero wants one more bottle of that yummy wine we had for Halloween and some nice chocolate. For starters.”
“What?”
He tossed the phone away and sprang from the bed. “Right. Time to get dressed properly.”
“What happened?”
“There is one more bedroom upstairs,” Mrs Hudson chimed in from the doorway, “but I guess you won’t be needing that.”
John pressed on Sherlock's shoulder to indicate he should sit back down. “No need. Here, I made us tea, you must be thirsty. I sure know I am.”
John didn’t think once about the madman during the day, he simply didn’t have time. Sherlock wasn’t the only one who found the exam period taxing. Only when the door closed after the last student, he remembered he hadn’t noticed Sherlock leaving. He locked the entrance and went to the back office. He found him there, just not as he imagined.
“I’d like to ask you a favour. Not for me, for a friend of mine.”
They lay back down, just holding each other. Suddenly, John began to laugh.
“Mycroft’s people, don’t talk to them, they might eat your brain, John, and then use your corpse to smuggle spies and secrets abroad,” Sherlock told John in a mock whisper. He whirled in the middle of the sitting room. “So, what do you think?”
“Not a bit.”
“That’s what you do? Recreationally saving people from going to prison?” John asked when the restaurant owner clapped Sherlock on the shoulder and left them alone with the menu.
, John thought.
“So do I.”
All of them stared at Sherlock with open mouths. John’s eyes were dark, his cheeks flushed.
“Yes, you said something you shouldn’t have but Molly told me that he was quite harsh with you. Seems that our detective saw you as a rival. I kinda don’t blame him. So, as much as you shouldn’t have said this, I understand why you did it.”
He waited till the door closed behind her and then brought the coffee to Sherlock’s desk.
The petite woman smiled at him. “That’s amazing, John! I didn’t think they come so soon.”
John performed his morning duties briskly but on autopilot. When he got dressed, he went to the window and peered to the sliver of autumn overcast sky he could see above the wall of the neighbouring building, which stood so close that covered almost all his view. He turned from the window and took in his tiny bedsit. Just a bed, a table with a chair, a worn-down sofa and a small wardrobe. His eyes fixed on the drawer of the bedside table.
, that all he wanted was to bury his nose in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and breathe.
“It seems to me you are wasting your potential,” John frowned. When Sherlock bristled, he quickly continued. “I mean, you are brilliant. Your deduction skills and all… Why don’t you work as a detective?”
Water again. The pressure on his chest is heavy, his lungs are burning. He suddenly knows with certainty that they aren’t going to let him up. Cold fear runs rapidly through his limbs, makes them rigid. He is never going to see his parents again. Mycroft. Redbeard. Do they also think he is a freak? Has he hurt them? He surely has. He sees dark spots. His body ceases obeying him.
Sherlock crossed his arms. “Alright?”
The constant movement of Sherlock’s arms caused his slim-fit shirt to stretch and ride up a bit and reveal a sliver of pale skin contrasting with the dark fabric of his trousers. John imagined what it would be like to touch it. He mentally slapped himself when he realized that he was ogling his oblivious customer who just wanted to help him.
The librarian laughed quietly and extended his hand. “I’m John, by the way.”
“Cold cases. I’m solving them and I’m writing a book about it. You see, even the years after you can pinpoint where the investigation went wrong because some witless simpleton didn’t do his work properly. I solved like half of the most famous cold cases, but it’s slow work because I need to experiment and I don’t have the right equipment and space and access to some… things. I’m thinking about renting a lab but I can do that only at the end because I have to save time and do all the experiments at once and I don’t know yet which ones will be needed.”
“I got evicted.”
“You got it.”
“I can’t. I’m sorry,” Sherlock shook his head, curls bouncing.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn't have pried,” Sherlock mumbled.
When Sherlock woke up in the morning, he found John looking at him with revering expression as if he couldn’t believe he was really there. Sherlock felt the same way. He couldn’t understand that John hadn’t kicked him out, that he wasn’t mad at him and Jesus, were they really snogging like teenagers? He blushed.
Initially, Sherlock wanted to take the books to his flat but now the prospect of warm, quiet, nice smelling library seemed more appealing to him than his cold ugly flat.
Sherlock smirked. “I guess not. Well, your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. Former soldier working at Barts, so Army doctor – obvious. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. Your limp is really bad when you walk but you can move heavy books a few steps without the cane, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan.”
“Yes,” he said in a small voice.
“Starving,” John said and his stomach confirmed it with loud rumbling.
John’s smile widened. “Do you have any plans for today? You will probably need to go home.”
They looked at each other, not moving. Then Sherlock did the most unexpected thing. He began to laugh. There was a rumble in his chest and his shoulders started to shake. He pressed his mouth into a thin line as he tried to suppress it but soon the laughter overcame his defences and bubbled out.
Mike was the person who got John his job, a welcome supplement to his military pension. After he got invalided from Afghanistan, John couldn’t work as a doctor because everything connected with it, smells mostly, triggered his PTSD. In the midst of thinking he would have to leave London, he met Mike in the park. They chatted, Mike told him about the job and later recommended John to the position.
“John. I…” he exhaled shakily.
“In that case, let’s not waste time,” he nodded.
Sherlock mumbled sleepily, then abruptly opened his eyes.
Sherlock simply looked at him and stretched out his hand. “The book, John.”
Sherlock nodded weakly.
“‘Piss off’.”
“What is it?” John found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it reassuringly. “Tell me.”
Sherlock emerged from the shower and went to search for clean clothes. He opened the wardrobe and had to chuckle. In the flat that was almost completely void of furniture but stuffed with things vital for his experiments, some of which were maybe developing their own political system already, was a wardrobe full of bespoke clothes, freshly cleaned and pressed. It was the only condition his mother managed to enforce on him when he moved to London. He had to represent the family, therefore it was not possible to dress like a vagrant. She got him an open account at one of London’s most established tailors. He would lie to himself if he denied he liked how good his slim frame looked in tailored suits. And he sure loved his Belstaff coat more than was healthy.
Then Sherlock shifted and John found himself breathing against Sherlock’s chest. He was enveloped in a warm embrace. He snuggled into it. He felt something akin to a kiss in his hair and smiled into Sherlock’s collarbone. He nosed his way up on Sherlock’s long neck, the tip of his nose hitting Sherlock’s chin as he slowly raised his head. Now would probably be the time to stare romantically into each other’s eyes but John ditched it in favour of going directly for Sherlock’s lips. The way Sherlock had been snuggling him back gave him hope that the kiss wouldn’t screw everything up between them.
The last thing he heard before the door slammed shut, was: “Why are you ruining my date, Mycroft?”
Sherlock didn’t know what he expected but he sure didn’t expect this and he felt his cheek warming. “Do you think so?”
“If it must…”
“You’re my hero, Molly.”
Sherlock became a regular at BSL. However, there was nothing regular in his habits. Sometimes, he arrived among the first readers in the morning and left only when John turned off the lights in the evening, so absorbed that he ignored everything around him. Sometimes, he came in several times a day. Sometimes, he crashed in like a madman, checked the information in one book and dashed off as if a life depended on it.
Molly considered it for a while. “John Watson, you’ll owe me so much. But I think you’d be really cute together, so I’ll figure something out. Can he work with an unconventional schedule as well? I mean, there might be visits from the police - but they usually visit during the official office hours, so if he’s a night owl, it might be possible to arrange something.”
Light. Air! He is lying on the floor again, trying to inhale but his chest is too tight.
Finally, everything was sparkling clean and it was time to go. John grabbed a spare umbrella (it is amazing how many things people leave behind at libraries), a bit wobbly and creaky but it would do and hopefully he wouldn’t be soaked to the bone before he got home. He took out the trash and made a beeline for the dustbins. Then he quickly crossed the courtyard, aiming for the side-entrance the service workers used but before he could reach it, he spotted a heap of a person by the wall. The doctor in him took charge.
“If I do, you’ll kick me out.”
He was engrossed in cataloguing the additions left from yesterday when a round head with glasses and a friendly smile popped in the doorway.
“Hello, Dr Watson. Get in the car, please.”
A hand attempted to smash the alarm-clock button, missed and tried again, successfully this time. John sat up on the bed with a groan. He rubbed his eyes and sighed. He felt like shit, as he did nearly every morning. He got his legs on the floor and, hissing, tried to loosen up his right leg that went stiff during the night. When he was certain he could manage a few steps to the loo without the cane that was propped against the bedside table, he took off his t-shirt and got up to shower off the dried sweat from another night full of nightmares.
A few readers from the neighbouring desks looked up at them.
“Yes, well, sorry for waking you. Just another bloody nightmare.”
“Sorry?”
Suddenly, he can’t breathe. There is cold water in his nose, in his mouth, in his eyes. He tries to fight but something heavy holds him down. He can’t move his hands. He is kicking his legs.
“Sherlock,” he whispered. “Try to sleep.”
“Is he by any chance tall, dark and handsome? That coffee guy from the library..?” she teased him.
John smiled. “I know, you daft man, because Molly called me and told me everything. They listened to your advice. Finally.”
Another shove in the back.
Sherlock muttered something that could be “thank you” but didn’t even raise his head. John stood there for a moment but eventually returned to the front desk. He was a bit disappointed but what had he expected? Luckily, he had to deal with a bunch of students and didn’t have much time to brood.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary, quite extraordinary.”
John laughed: “That’s as good as it gets.”
“Hello,” he boomed. Sherlock jumped visibly and bumped his head on the desk edge. He straightened up, rubbing the top of his head.
John assumed that Abby is some kind of youtube celebrity. “Nonsense! You really have to stop selling yourself short. You are a lovely lady, Molly, and any man will be lucky to have you!”
“Thank you, John. Just let me know when you’re leaving please,” Sherlock smiled timidly at John and dived into the book on vermins in London. He was interested in foxes today.
“What part of ‘I’m not moving into that posh house of yours’ didn’t you understand?! … No. … No! … Don’t bring mommy into this, Mycroft! … All right, forget I asked for anything!”
John tried to focus on Sherlock’s voice, which dropped lower than usual in an effort to calm him down. His touch grounded him and he gradually calmed enough that he was able to breathe almost normally.
“What things do you need access to?”
“You were a soldier!” Sherlock exclaimed, excited.
“Alright, Mr Holmes, can you look straight into the camera?”
“No form, no card. No card, no books,” the librarian said and pointed to the nearby table. “You can sit over there. Come to me when you are done and I’ll take your photo.”
“My photo?! Is it necessary?”
He took his cane and strode from the flat to the bus stop.
He descends into the darkness of the basement floors of his Mind Palace. He doesn’t try to turn the lights on, there aren’t any there. He walks slowly through the corridor. It isn’t visited often, the air is stale and stinks.
The librarian froze and frowned. “Excuse me?”
At five, John locked the library and went to visit Molly in the morgue. He found her investigate tissue samples of rather fascinating poisoning and they spent a while chatting about some interesting autopsies she had recently worked on. She then fluently changed topic in that adorable nervous way of hers and told John about her new hobby - youtube makeup tutorials.
Sherlock frowned at the food.
“I‘m waiting…”
The Barts Science Library was eerily quiet when John came in. He was the only staff, therefore it was up to him to come half an hour early every day and make sure everything was ready for its visitors. He opened the windows and let fresh air in. He could smell the rain in it but it hadn’t started yet. He made himself a cup of Earl Grey in the tiny kitchenette adjacent to an equally tiny back office. The computer on the front desk was humming quietly, as it started loading the Amlib system. John opened the book box, to which latecomers could return their books, and took out three books to check them in. Next, he went to prepare the interlibrary loans and ordered a courier to pick them up.
Sherlock nodded. In his head, John’s voice echoed.
“Oh! It’s for him, isn’t it?” She chuckled. “I have to say you have a good taste, he is handsome and kinda cute! Look at those curls!”
John reached out and put a curl, which fell over Sherlock’s eyes, back behind his ear. “Will you be able to sleep now?”
It wasn’t a question. Sherlock shed his jacket, moved John firmly sideways and climbed the ladder like a monkey.
Sherlock leaned forward, animated. “The police don’t consult amateurs, John! That’s why I’m writing my book. To prove myself, make myself known. I have a website and I sometimes get to solve a case through it but it’s not enough. Also, I tend to discourage potential clients, you know,” he gestured to himself. He suddenly had enough of self-probing: “And why are you hiding in the library?”
Molly narrowed her eyes. “That’s nice of you. Almost too nice. What’s up, John, spill the beans.”
“Believe me, I’m not doing it for my pleasure,” the librarian said dryly and gestured to the small queue that formed behind Sherlock.
“Do you know what day is today?”
, John thought, moving the trolley back to the front desk. He would really want to thank Sherlock but how?
Sherlock arrived at the library already annoyed because he had another phone call with Mycroft, this time about Mummy’s birthday celebration. His brother didn’t forget to remind him to get a haircut and to dress properly. “I’m not a child, Mycroft!” One day, he would actually smash the phone.
Lestrade took a minute to answer his phone and made a few confirming grunts into it.
“Shall we order? I sweat the linguini here are to die for. Well, not literally, since dying might prevent you from actually enjoying the meal, but close enough. It’s the lamb. And the seasoning. The only one who even gets close to that is Mrs Hudson, but she was married to a mafia boss from the south of Italy, as cliché as it sounds,” he went back to rattling the information at lightspeed. It seemed to John that he wanted to cover his nervousness. He wasn’t ready to address the issue further either, so he just went on with the chatter.
When the handsome stranger filled the form, John entered the data (
“Sorry, John, I have to go.”
“Is something wrong?”
“I don’t know, I kinda enjoy the sight of you in too short sweatpants and fluffy socks,” John laughed and had a towel thrown at his head for his insolence.
“But isn’t this much better? How about you move in with me? The rent will certainly be much better if we share!” he shrugged nonchalantly.
“Alright, so how do we find the other woman now? If she came from the tunnels, it could have been from bloody anywhere.”
“Well, he says he’s really bad with superiors. And I think that’s an understatement. He’s just… very unconventional. Acquired taste.”
Sherlock was sleeping on the table, a cheek on his folded arms, the coat hung loosely over his shoulders. John forgot that the back office wasn’t heated because he almost never used it.
Light. Air. He gulps it. He can’t scream.
“No, that’s fine. You didn’t know. Hell, I didn’t know either,” John said shakily. “I mean.. I know my triggers but this was so unexpected…”
John had only one duvet but luckily it was quite large, so they both managed to fit under it after some shuffling. Sherlock was lying on his back, looking at the ceiling. John lay down on his side and observed the man. His eyes were wide open and shadows accentuated his cheekbones. It was a sight for sore eyes, John would just prefer to have him here under completely different circumstances.
John raised both eyebrows. “On the spot? That had to be a serious offence. What have you done?!” he asked sternly and crossed his arms, but it was no heat in that.
“Detective Inspector,” Sherlock said primly.
“I got you a candle, it’s more romantic,” he winked at them and sauntered away.
He felt Sherlock’s hands stroking his back. Sherlock also leaned his head and was now breathing into John’s hair. John’s erratic heartbeat gradually slowed down. He hadn’t felt this safe for a very long time. One of Sherlock’s hands found a place on the back of John’s neck. John liked its reassuring heaviness.
John frowned. “Of course... what? I have my own place.”
At the elementary school, the head librarian hated him because he returned his books constantly late and damaged. In fact, that didn’t change, he was the same at the university. He may have paid more for the library fines than for his tuition. The librarians looked the same too. He could swear they were clones but so far he had no proof. And now he was about to meet another one. He shuddered but steeled himself and strode in.
Sherlock lifted the pictures and examined them closely. Then he went to the body, took a foldable magnifying glass out of his pocket and began to check the victim’s hands and face. He spent the most time observing her lips in great detail. When he started sniffing her neck, Lestrade frowned and wanted to say something but John stopped him with the hand on his arm.
Sherlock took his time with the shower so when he stepped out of the bathroom, a heap of wet clothes in his hands, the takeaway just arrived. John waved at Sherlock to put his clothes on the wall-mounted dryer in the bathroom and went to get the food. They sat on the old sofa. Sherlock was still shaking a bit and John put an offensively orange blanket over him.
“I simply observed.”
“Hey, I haven’t seen you drink anything all day. You can have a cuppa here, you know. Do you realize that the brain is a goo that works on water? Here, you must be parched. And err… thanks for earlier.”
Molly danced in with the coffee. She put it on the desk and winked at John: "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. I mean, I might tell the corpses but those won't definitely tell anyone."
“What-”
When they got to John’s, Sherlock stood in the middle of the tiny room like a bedraggled kitten. John instinctively went for simple instructions.
“What do people normally say?”
He could do this without help. He didn’t need Mycroft’s money. True, his own odd jobs only barely sufficed for this pathetic excuse for a flat but at least he didn’t have to listen to anyone.
Sherlock had to think about it a little and the answer surprised him. “Happy.”
“She was found in a locked secure room in a jewellery shop. Single fatal wound, she cracked her head on the table edge. Here’s the address and a few pictures of the crime scene,” he took them out of an ordinarily-looking manila envelope and spread them out on a table. “They’re calling it an accident, except the angle is weirdly off. There’s literally nothing she could have tripped over. So how did she die? Who killed her?”
“You were screaming.”
“The tunnels check out. One of our PCs has just filed a report about them, an architectonic marvel.” He checked his phone and continued: “And the victim was found on camera having a romantic dinner with another woman. Your story checks out. My guys have been on this for 36 hours now and you figured it out under ten minutes. How the hell did you do that?”
“...it entertains me but I think I’ll quit. It’s not like those,” she gestured to the wall of freezers, “can be bothered, can they? And I’m not Abby from NCIS anyway.”
It had been raining cats and dogs all day and while every proper Londoner was accustomed to this kind of weather, John was very annoyed by everyone dragging their wet umbrellas into the library. It meant he had to stay overtime to wipe the floor, because
“It’s Valentine’s Day.”
“It’s not like that! I just really want to help him. Because…,” John hesitated, realizing how truthful was what he was about to say, “him being my friend… it’s helping me too.”
Sherlock eyed the form in distaste. Why had it to be so complicated?
“Okay, see you later!”
“Of course we won’t need two bedrooms,” Sherlock confirmed.
Sherlock ducked his head. “You may say that…”
“Well, I really enjoy your company. Just in case it wasn’t clear,” John chuckled.
Sherlock finally managed to suck the air in. His chest was heaving. He was at Barts again. His subconscious need for John led him back here. He stumbled into the back courtyard. He could see the light in the library window, so John was still there. Sherlock’s reasoning was sluggish but he knew the sun is low so it must be long after five. He couldn’t go in. He disappointed John so terribly as he had disappointed so many people in his life. He isn’t worthy of him. He thought it would finally work but it couldn’t. It’s never going to work, with anybody. He is always saying such bad and hurtful things. He is a monster.
More giggling. More kicks. He is lying on the floor now, curled up, protecting his head. A kick in the ribs. Every breath is pure pain.
“Good morning, John! Want anything in the cafeteria?”
“In this case, yes. Or some stuff from the pharmacy in exchange for paperwork. Or cash, like when I returned a stray dog to its owner because I know every homeless person in the area and they spotted it hiding. Free pizza when I got the delivery guy out of trouble with authorities.”
“You’re pulse is sped-up. Your pupils are dilated,” Sherlock observed, his analytic self kicking back in.
Sherlock sat and the librarian handed him the books. The sleeve of his shirt moved up and there was a suntan line visible.
Without a word, Sherlock disappeared in the bathroom and soon the sound of running water could be heard. Satisfied, John went to put the kettle on. When he opened the fridge, he realized it was quite empty save for some old cheese and ordered takeaway. Then he rummaged through his small wardrobe. He found some warm socks, old sweatpants and a t-shirt, hopefully big enough for the taller man. He knocked on Sherlock, informing him that he left the clothes by the bathroom door.
, John sighed.
“No idea. But it’s 5 o’clock - the closing time,” John smiled.
“You can smile a bit.”
“Huh. And the motive? Jealousy?”
John acknowledged the point with humming. “You could be a consultant.”
“I’m going to assault you now,” was the only warning Sherlock got before John pulled him closer by the lapels of his weathered coat and kissed him with such eagerness Sherlock dropped the bag he was holding in his hand.
“Thank you, John, I would be grateful. I may have an alternative though,” Sherlock searched for his phone. “Meantime, I have to go to the morgue to pick up my bag. Would you come with me?”
“I’m clean today,” came a quiet reply.
In a few long strides, the stranger was at the front desk. John stood up. The first thing he noticed when the stranger came closer, was the curls. Because seriously, they couldn’t be overlooked. They were sticking from the man’s head in every direction and looked as if they were still wet from the shower. When the smell of soap reached John’s nostrils, his hypothesis was confirmed.
John smiled and shook his head. “I’m good, Mike, I have some leftovers in the fridge.”
“That’s okay, Sherlock,” John said softly. “You’ll tell me when you are ready. Let’s put you to bed.”
“John! You are here, with me. Breathe with me. Inhale... Exhale… Nice and slow. Everything is OK. I’m here.”
“My what?”
Sherlock stood on the pavement in front of the Barts, fists and teeth clenched, heart pounding. His vision blurred. The world was rendered to shades of black and grey. He started walking. He didn’t know where he was going. His legs carried him through the city with only enough mental presence left not to be run down by a car in heavy London traffic.
John stared at him. Sherlock had been reading about his condition? Because of him?
“I’ve upset Molly and she asked me to leave. I was frustrated from earlier and there was this detective and I said something I shouldn’t and I have disappointed you.”
“Are you drugged?”
“Tsk tsk… I see right through you!” And with that, she was gone.
Sherlock grinned. “Come on, I know a fantastic Italian restaurant.”
They barely sat down at the table by the window when Angelo rushed to welcome them. Of course, he had to tell John everything about Sherlock clearing his name from murder.
“Listen, genius, Molly told me about you. This,” he gestured to the woman body lying on the table, “is our new case. True locked room mystery. I’ll tell you what we know and you can show what’s in you, deal?”
Sherlock scoffed. “I’m not good with following orders and obeying superiors. I like my freedom too much.”
“That was… I mean, thank you,” he said but Sherlock was already engrossed in his book, completely ignoring him.
Sherlock looked so smug John had to chuckle. “But… foxes?”
“I could get fired for this,” he muttered as he moved the stacks of papers and binders from the small desk. “Here, would it be to Your Highness’s liking?”
“I know. And no, you haven’t.”
“Oh. I don’t have one.”
“Your library card. You know, that thing people bring in the library if they want to borrow some books?” He sounded amused now.
John frowned.
“Oh,” Sherlock couldn’t wrap his head around that. “But I… That wasn’t my intention, I just wanted him to shut up and I did what you told me not to, so I disappointed you.”
“I… I...”
“Well, you can stay here for a while, of course. But no experiments and no sound effects, understood?”
He entered the library, picked up his books but when he went to his seat, he found it occupied. Also, the seat opposite was occupied.
The tall man looked sheepish for a moment. John found it incredibly adorable. “I have to admit I got carried away. They are amazing. But I know they are involved in something! I just don’t know what. They shouldn’t be so widespread. I wonder if we ever get racoons, now that would cause an uproar!”
Sherlock shook it. “Nice to meet you, John. Call me Sherlock, please.”
And yet, it seemed that Sherlock liked to spend time with John. They chatted about random things, Sherlock sometimes even helped John with shelving when he needed to stretch his legs, as he put it. And was that John’s imagination or was Sherlock standing closer on these occasions than was strictly necessary? So close that John could smell his soap and something so distinctly
“It’s a- Look, John, I have to finish this but I can tell you later if you’re interested?”
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise and closed his eyes. John did so as well. They had been lying like that for about half an hour and John was slowly drifting to sleep when Sherlock spoke.
“Yeah, you owe me a pint where you will tell me everything about this new man in your life, that’s for sure.”
Sherlock inched closer and put his arms around John. At first, it was a bit awkward but then John decided that as a comforted party he could do what he had wanted to do for a long time and buried his nose in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. It felt every bit as good as he had imagined.
“Nevermind.” John snapped the photo. “All done. Just a minute till the machine prints your card. Now, what were these books you wanted to borrow? And
Holmes recited the titles again, marginally slower, and John checked them in the computer. “We have four of them here now, two I have to order from the storeroom and the rest we don’t have but can get to you through interlibrary loans in a few days. Will this be okay with you?”
) into the system and led him to the elevated part of the front desk, on which the camera stood on the tripod. It was operated remotely from the computer.
“Sure thing! Why are you whispering?”
“That shop has certification for diamond evaluation. There are only several places that do that.”
John groaned and nodded. “He’s so incredibly smart. But he’s doing research about some things… and he needs some space. Workspace. If possible, even access to not strictly available things.”
“You are not mad at me,” Sherlock stated, incredulously.
John smiled and Sherlock watched, mesmerized, the wrinkles that formed in the corners of his eyes. “I’ll let you here with your books. If you need anything, I’ll be at the front desk.”
“Oh.”
Sherlock grabbed his coat and rose. “Right. Sorry again. I’ll just go.”
“No?”
, John mused.
“So, what exactly are you researching? I thought I would get the idea eventually but your book selection is so random…”
He checked the Petri dishes on the table and, satisfied with their development, left the flat. He froze mid-step in the doorway. There was a perfectly innocently looking envelope lying on the threshold right in front of him. Sherlock knew exactly what was inside, he would recognize the envelope paper everywhere. Well, that was fast. He picked it up and tore it up to tiny pieces. The phone in his pocket started to ring. Sherlock huffed.
“Give me the coat.” Sherlock shrugged it off. It was heavy with all the water. John dug up a spare towel and handed it to Sherlock. “Go take a shower. I’ll find some dry clothes for you.”
“This house sits on the network of disused Underground tunnels used during WWII as a shelter for the government offices. The tunnels had entrances inside of the houses that were rented by the government through some intermediary. It was vital not to be seen to enter any underground facility because it could have tipped off traitors. If you take a look at the walls in the secure room, you will find out some hidden corridor, that’s for sure. She wasn’t alone in that room, she had to be on the date.”
Sherlock stilled, he didn’t seem to breathe at all. “Would you?”
this time, please.”
And sometimes, and John hated those days, he didn’t appear at all.
Sherlock knew that he shouldn’t say that but couldn’t help himself: “You’re an Army doctor who has been invalided home from Afghanistan and your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“I’ll explain later, okay? Listen, John, I really enjoyed the evening. See you in the library,” Sherlock said and got in the car.
“No! My god, Molly, no! He is solving cold cases. Murders. He wants the truth to be out there. To prove that some people are innocent and send the real killers to prison. And to prove he is clever, obviously.”
There wasn’t much time to chat with John the following week because as the autumn term was almost over, the library was full of students. The afternoons were almost impossible there. However, it was still better than his mouldy flat with windows that had been last repaired sometime in the 19th century. And there was no John in his flat. Sherlock got to like the small librarian. He was polite and listened to him and was impressed by his deductions. And it was… nice.
“Acquired taste? I bet you’ve got a taste for it already.”
John thought and went to put the kettle on. Luckily it wasn’t one of those modern supersmart beeping beasts. He didn’t want to wake Sherlock up yet. His face was calm, the perpetual frown that wrinkled his forehead gone. His lips were partly open and John could hear him snoring lightly.
“Of course. There is a nice desk under the window over there.”
