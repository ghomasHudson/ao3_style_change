Sherlock protests in a whine, struggling with John’s relentless grip to no avail.
“Do you need help?” John asks, waiting for permission before he begins to move.
Finishing my glass, I stand up and pat him on the shoulder in a stiff manner, trying to reinstate some of the friendly boundaries that once sat between us. Sherlock looks up at me, still open, and the rest of it crumbles.
My eyes slide shut as I curse myself. The bloody fucking letter. Letting out a deep breath, I turn to him. He has every right to be pissed at me.
So many tidbits in one small conversation, it was making him reel.
“Then why did you?” he asks. Sherlock’s shoulders stiffen. Instead of answering the question, he asks one of his own.
The last part! Thank you all for reading! :)
John had seen this look before. After the row with the chip-and-pin machine, as he attempted a deduction, when he was rigged to a bomb. It was a look of fear laced with adoration, soft around the eyes yet holding something back. John’s breath caught in his throat, his words dying on his tongue.
It’s clear that fists and rods and whips had been used, and he knows that Sherlock must be aching and in pain, the muscles stiff from the treatment they received. Noticing some dried blood in places, John sets to replacing each dressing with a clean one. Even with John’s gentle touches, Sherlock hisses with the slight tugging of the tape on skin, his nerves raw and frayed with the constant input of pain.
“Sit.” He gestures with his glass to my red chair. I take a swig of my own drink, cross to my seat, and plop down, unable to control my descent.
“John,” he breathes, short-winded.
"I couldn’t give that up. It was safe compared to you. To losing you again. To losing myself again. So I played house. Played normal. And then she wasn’t, she wasn't normal. But she was the devil I knew… and Rosie. For how much I want to regret everything, I can’t because I got Rosie."
Her smile smug, Mrs. Hudson flashes him a wink. “Don’t you forget it, Doctor Watson. Now,” Making shooing motions with her hands, she waves him out toward the stairs, “you best get back to your man.” They both look upwards at the sound of a thud above. “Preferably
“I’m not sure I do.”
“ ‘ts fine. Are you okay? You were making funny noises.” Her eyebrows furrow in an exact replica of her father’s. Sherlock runs a gentle finger over it and down her nose, to smooth out the concern. With a tap to the tip of her nose and a smile he says, “Now that you are here, I am perfect.” She giggles, shaking her head, and burrows into his arms.
“Just cancel the reservation, Angelo,” he snaps before forcing his voice to soften. “Please.”
It’s the saddest thing John thinks he has ever seen. He looks over her head to Sherlock to find him wide-eyed and lost for how to help. Gazing down at Rosie, John pulls her into his arms and cradles her head against his shoulder.
, then? Beat Moriarty, proved yourself the smartest, and now you can come home?” Even as the words leave his mouth, he regrets them, but Sherlock responds before he can apologize.
“Well, okay... that’s fair,” John admits. He reaches out and tugs at a loose thread on the blanket. “But…. I mean, when it was your turn, I didn’t lock myself in my room and ignore you.” He spares a glance at Sherlock, sees his face tensing. “I’m not trying to make you feel bad, Sherlock,” John hurries to add. “It just…” he swallows and wraps the thread around his finger, voice growing softer. “I don’t know. I guess… I guess I missed you.”
look back up at him.
“What?” I ask, a mouthful of toast distorting the word.
“Of course. I noticed almost immediately after you moved in. But you haven’t said. Do you want me to play?” A gruffness bleeds into Sherlock's voice as he talks, a mild annoyance at the repetition.
“Roger that, Mrs. H.” Grinning, the socks clutched in one hand, John trots up the stairs, calling, “I got you some socks. Mrs. Hudson has surprisingly large feet.” He steps into 221B to find Sherlock clinging to the wall, his legs shaky and bent, a scowl darkening his sharp features.
“The Rehab again?” he asks in a casual manner.
Sherlock pouts, looking affronted. “I
John walks in after a day at the clinic and sees them curled into each other. They both look up when he closes the door, and he gives them a tired, warm smile. Toeing off his toes, John hangs his coat in-between the long Belfast and the tiny, puffy blue one. He comes over and places a kiss on the top of each of their heads.
“If it will benefit your process, of course I’ll attend for however long you desire my presence.”
“Do you have restricted movement? Desensitization? Pain?” His voice sounds strained as if attempting to conceal anger.
With a deep sigh, Sherlock straightens his spine and lays it all out for Lestrade. John is doing his best to suppress his giggles in the background. Koalas and crime scenes and cuckholds, oh my. He already knows the title of this blog post.
Then, something clicks, and I realize why this came up after therapy.
“There are a few scenarios for each of the three events you mentioned,” he starts, “Some align with the actual events, some do not. However, Moriarty is the constant in all versions. He is the villain in the fairytale of my dreams. Perverting them, twisting them into these nightmares.” The music begins to stutter through the room, agitated and nervous, arrhythmic and staccato. “I would have assumed that seeing him kill himself would be enough for my subconscious to be rid of his torment.”
“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Hudson hums, a gleam in her eye. “Well, you’d better not tell him, but I may have waxed your floor. I hoped it might encourage you two closer together. You know... help you
“Now,” Mrs. Hudson repeats, and John follows her at a distance with a sigh.
John stares at the duster in his hand, lips pursed as he looks back up at his landlady. “What am I supposed to do with this?”
John thought.
Each spoonful of food is more forcefully plopped on the plate than the last, and I can feel Sherlock’s hot, piercing gaze scorching the back of my neck.
“The Pool, version 3,” Sherlock responds in a flat tone.
“Oh,” is all he says at first. A deep wrinkle furrows his brow. "Then... why did you go back? Why did you go after her? Why did you blame me?"
I rest a hand on his hip, fingers stiff, still unsure quite how all this is supposed to work. “Better?”
Sherlock had written responses to every question, every accusation, every bloody paragraph.
It made John want to crawl out of his skin. If he was having such trouble, John wondered how Sherlock was handling it. This kind of thing was not his forte, and they hadn’t even run into the dreaded ex yet. At least, not that John could tell. He still didn’t know who he was supposed to be… protecting? Sherlock from.
“Yeah, good, that’s perfect,” John interrupts. He shakes the stick, and the two hands make a clicking sound against one another, a tinny sound of fake applause. John grins at Sherlock’s sour expression. “No? Alright, fine.” He drops the clapping hands onto the sofa and digs back into the bag. “How about this?” His hand emerges with a package of squishy, multi-coloured
He swore he saw a twinkle pass through those piercing, pale eyes.
Sherlock uncrosses his legs and stands in one fluid movement to retrieve his case. After putting rosin on his bow, a melody begins to ring through the flat. It calms the storm brewing beneath my ribs and behind my eyes. I finish drying the glasses and end up back in my chair, in the same position I was before, filled with an altogether different emotion now. Sherlock faces the window, swaying as he plays.
to avoid you.”
Sherlock’s eyes dart away. “Why would you think that?” he asks. His tone is flat, empty, but his fingers tug at his trousers, fidgeting and flighty. John watches the unsettled movements, sorting his thoughts before replying.
“This is your zone,” John explains, waving Sherlock behind the tape. “You
“Yeah. Alright. I’ll do it.” John watched as Sherlock’s shoulders visibly unfurled, and the tension in them dissipated. “What’s the plan, then?”
Sherlock freezes in the kitchen, hand hovering over the kettle. “I don’t know, John,” he says slowly, finally recovering. “Why were you going through the garbage?”
“No. This time was Serbia,” I inform him, my tone flat, hoping to avoid expressing how much it has affected me. It has been a few weeks since my last series of nightmares.
I nod in understanding. Sherlock is not one to feel obligated by or to anyone or anything, but he values his work, and they had given him that. With a deep breath, Sherlock looks towards the window, and in an almost whisper adds, “Sometimes, I dream about being forced into that rehab again, dying day by day, minute by minute, losing everything I have come to care about.” Glancing to me, I see the unshed tears in his eyes. “I can’t lose Rosie, John,” his voice hitches and cracks, “I can’t.”
He doesn’t understand.
Knowing he won’t drop it, and not wanting him to, I hang my head between my arms, hands gripping the edge of the counter as I step away from it, body collapsing forward on itself. “St. Bart’s,” I mutter.
Sherlock has to stop John’s death, so much so he plays out one or the other of the determined fixes. One being the actual events as they occurred or two being that John survives while Sherlock doesn’t.
Rosie’s face scrunches up with all the strength of her five-year-old contemplation abilities. After a moment it relaxes, and with a small, sharp nod she says, “Yes. I understand. But I don’t like it.”
My heart drops into my stomach, and I could feel my face fall with it. Without even needing to think on the answer, the words blurt out. “No, Sherlock, not even then.”
“I went away, and you weren’t there.” The reply comes without pause, already on his tongue as if he had known it was coming. He takes a sip of his bourbon, and I follow his lead.
John?” Sherlock pouts, nuzzling against him and reluctant to part.
Craning her head to gaze up at Sherlock, she asks “Papa, how do you deal with bad dreams?”
“There was an exposure,” John says, his voice low. “At the clinic.” His brow furrows, and he glares at the floor. “I have to quarantine.”
“Well, he was the one to initiate the conversations. He told me about dreams he’s had of Afghanistan in hopes that I might open up about my own. Since then, we’ve talked through them and attempted to reassure each other amidst them.”
“But, but…” Sherlock protests fall on dead ears, and he rolls his shoulders, trying to dislodge John to no avail. “But John! The case!”
“Yeah, well, fuck you, too,” he snaps, turning away. Sherlock putters silently around the kitchen and doesn’t answer.
“Serbia? What happened in Serbia?” Again, the crinkle between his brows but with the addition of a slight frown pulling at the corners of his mouth.
Lifting his hand to cup Sherlock’s jaw, John closed the scant distance between them with a firm press of his lips to the lush full ones he had so long been aching to taste.
“Yes,” he says, voice rough. Gathering his resolve, he repeats, “Yes, to the both of you. It would be the honor of a lifetime." Sneaking another glance to John, Sherlock adds, "Of three lifetimes."
Looking through his lashes at John, a smile blooms on Sherlock’s face. “Sounds lovely.” They turn back towards the elevator to head to Scotland Yard.
The corner of John’s mouth turns up in that smile he gives when something pleases him and tries to hide it. “Alright then. I’ll let her know for the next session then.”
Sherlock’s mouth pops open, incredulous.
His chest rumbles against my cheek when he asks his next question. “Is it alright if I kiss you?”
"The more complex answer has a lot more to do with what I think about myself, the way I was raised, how I handle my anger, the things I try not to admit to myself." With a shrug of my shoulder, I concede. "That's part of the reason for all the therapy. After... after the hospital, I knew... I knew I couldn't pretend anymore. I couldn't let myself slide through the sessions. And then after Eurus? God knows I needed it after that whole debacle."
As Sherlock heads to the shower for a proper first-date pampering, the slimy sense-memory of the sticky hand John threw at him lingers on his lips. Fingertips fluttering in front of his mouth, Sherlock aches for the touch of John’s hungry kiss to replace it.
There is a beat of silence before Mycroft replies, breathless, “Can we… can we try the arsehole licking thing?”
“It stopped being a game when he threatened your life. It’s hasn’t been a game for a long time now.” Sherlock’s voice comes out barely above a whisper as if he were trying to make himself smaller, hide from John’s wrath.
“Talk!” Her voice is stern. The handle doesn’t budge when John tries to turn it. “I’m not letting you two out of there until you do!” The door muffles the sound of her heels clicking against the floor as she walks away.
. He’s taking advantage of your guilt and friendship, and selfishly getting his at your expense. Don’t let him.”
It was staggering to realize, and he deflected the need to process it completely by trying to make light of it, “You stuck an untested compound up my arse?” Sherlock found speaking easier now.
Danny had scourged him with the truth and there was nothing in the universe that could protect him from that. John was vile.
Sherlock woke in hospital. He was covered with a crocheted blanket, featuring a heavy field of brilliantly-coloured flowers that lay on top of the standard issue sheets of his cot. He recognized Mrs Hudson’s work and was comforted by it. She knew he liked to be weighed down when he slept, her blanket felt like it weighed a metric tonne. He was hooked up to an IV and he felt floaty. He knew he was on something to take the pain away, and that he was likely recovering from an overdose. With a sigh, he knew his hiatus was over, and that he’d once again be required to walk the difficult road to recovery from his fall back into addiction.
“Well, as a consulting detective, reading body language is part of my job. Rosie may be non-verbal for the most part but there are dozens of cues that I can discern that give me a precise understanding of her current state. Right now, Rosie’s lids are closing, she’s falling asleep and her hands are limp. She’s eaten so if she were unconsciously grasping her fingers, I would know that she’s still hungry but also wanting to fall asleep. It’s all fairly basic, most parents pick it up as they go along.”
Sherlock restrained him from leaping forward to attack her. He was surprised that David couldn’t smell the battle-hungry pheromones that he was emitting. There was no way he ought to be able to miss it. John began to listen intently, using all his senses to gauge where his ex-fiancée and lover were in relation to where he and Sherlock were hiding. He had his handgun, but it only had a few rounds in it. John didn’t know what they were carrying, but if they worked for someone more dangerous than Moriarty, then Mary and David were hazardous. The fog he’d been living in faded away, his instinct to protect his mate over-riding his desire to submit completely.
Sherlock looked at John for a long time, thinking over all the many moments between them that had been so lonely and miserable because of their misperceptions and circumstances, “You promise, John? I’m going to want that forever, and I am not being hyperbolic.”
John decided to wait until nightfall before returning to Baker Street, that way, no one would see him scuttle back to 221 B Baker Street, and shame Sherlock for choosing such a pathetic alpha.
“Giving and receiving, sometimes, yeah.” John was unashamed as he set a fast pace. Curious, Sherlock reached up and twisted John nipples without asking. His master groaned happily so Sherlock pinched them hard before letting go. Setting his feet flat on the mattress, he began to thrust upward with fierce determination, causing John to shout gratefully as he was pleasured. In only a few minutes, John orgasmed powerfully and even Sherlock couldn’t help but be momentarily swept away by the power of his own release.
John was nearly hyperventilating and tried to drink from his water glass to calm himself but instead ended up choking on his own spit, hacking and gasping gracelessly, attracting the attention of everyone in the restaurant. “John, are you going to be okay?”
. He was in love with John Watson just as much as John was in love with Sherlock Holmes, and that's all he would ever need to know in order to be happy, and he was.
am I wearing this ridiculous outfit?” Sherlock sounded querulous, “While it is soft and very comfortable, I don’t believe I would wear this by choice.”
was the only tool he had left. He swallowed the pastille and lay on the floor to stare at the ceiling, ignoring the chill in the air. It was warmer than how he felt inside.
parasitic presence in the lives of his friends. John realized that he was taking out his anger on those who were blameless, and even when they were culpable, he’d gone far beyond acceptable boundaries just to maintain his wroth. He was abusing everyone he knew, taking advantage of their goodwill repeatedly.
was fascinating, it wasn’t often lucrative.
Sherlock blinked several times before setting down the bug-out bag. Turning on his heel, Sherlock walked briskly to his room. John felt a bit glum but only for a moment. He heard the clear thumps and bangs of someone digging quickly through an overpacked wardrobe. One muffled curse later and Sherlock exited his room with a medium sized haversack in one hand. It was bland and inoffensive, nothing that would seem out of place almost anywhere in the world, unless wear counted against it. It was well used, soft and pliable, sturdy looking and dependable. Sherlock stood in front of John and handed it over, “I didn’t wrap it, but if anyone could make use of it, it would be you.”
Another small, bored sound.
As always when he thought his name, Sherlock felt a tremor that was half-hate and half pure fascination.
John couldn’t help but feel his inwards twist the slightest bit at the man’s possessive tone; but he resolutely ignored how it affected him to hear this voice calling him his because this was part of the problem. The man seemed to consider him as a pet, and this was an ignominy John wasn’t willing to accept.
“I have many witnesses ready to explain how you love to take a walk at a very precise hour every morning and evening, Colonel Moran, going through the kitchen to reach the forest shortly before the meals are served to the guests’ rooms. Do you confirm those are your habits?”
“I believe you’ve met Princess Adler once before, King Mycroft. Like the bird her family is named after, she doesn’t like to be restrained by anything else than her own whims. She left two days before we did, leaving us with a simple note and no means of tracking her, and told us she would meet us here – we had little choice but to believe her and hope she’d indeed be present today. When we didn’t see her as we approached the castle, her closest confident -” Here he gestured at the long-haired woman in the middle of the room “- pleaded with us to give her a little more time and persuaded us that she could imitate her mannerisms well enough to fool you. Obviously she overestimated her own acting skills.”
“Having a little fun, Melchior? I’m sure Sir Rave would be glad to hear his stable boys are efficient enough to take time off to work to rib newcomers and still finish their work on time.”
Now he had done it; his brother was sincerely surprised. It didn’t show on his large face, but Sherlock knew him enough to tell. Wanting a knight all to himself could have been another “caprice” (Mycroft’s name for it, not his); deciding to actually share his living space with the man meant this was no laughing matter. Sherlock could almost see the reasoning being pursued in his brother’s mind, so identical to his, could follow him as he brought up and discarded theories. Not a tryst; Sherlock got bored of his lovers very quickly, he certainly wouldn’t have made arrangements to share a room with one. Not a way to curry political favours with the man’s family – even if Watson had had anything to offer to the Kingdom, Sherlock’s only use of the court intrigues was to mock them and occasionally to expose them, contrarily to Mycroft who adored them. Not an enemy – no doubt Mycroft had some records of the Watson family somewhere in this huge brain of his, and anyway John’s honest nature was written all across his features.
John wondered dazedly if this getting-to-know-you thing included a bed before snapping back to his senses. And then he realised that he had beautifully lost this argument.
Her words were slightly drawled as well and he wondered whether anyone from the capital knew how to speak without elongating the syllables.
“You’re the second son of a noble, though quite poor, family, and your own wish was to become a local physician. Your father, however, wanted you to become a royal knight, and therefore you have learnt to fight, and fight well, and are now on your way to the centre of our kingdom. You’ve been travelling for five days now, but you’ve only been travelling alone for three. Even though I don’t think you’re quite bloodthirsty enough to be a knight, you possess the nobility of heart which is supposedly a condition for knighthood-” a sneer, there, indicated that the man strongly doubted that point “and though easily worried about other people’s safety, you have but little concern for yours. You also hold the conventions supposed by the social order rather lightly, although you treat everyone with respect.”
“People do little else.”
“…Troubles you when you think that those arrests will result in their deaths; John, your heart truly is a wonder of soft-hearted compassion. But I’m afraid we’ve arrived at our destination, and I must depart now. Good day, John; may your knight’s assessment go well.”
“But has he really? From what I can see, he’s managed to get injured and poisoned in the space of two weeks, taking you out of duty as well.”
“Indeed. And you have my thanks, my Lady.”
The guard – Gregson – who had fairly puffed up with importance at the man’s first words, suddenly deflated.
John didn’t know what he had been expecting when he had knocked on the door of the lady who had been the late Queen Violet’s closest confident and the nanny to both of her children, but it certainly hadn’t been the energetic little woman that had opened the door herself, clad in a rather simple and worn-out dress. The Lady didn’t look like ‘one of the most powerful women in the kingdom’, as his mother had described her to him, but it was true that she had an intelligent sparkle in her eyes that suggested that she would prove to be a worthy opponent against anyone who dared to underestimate her.
This was new to him.
“I still await you in the Throne room; be sure to come at once.”
“I’m sure I don’t know how our esteemed King dispenses justice; but probably they will be hung. This is the standard punishment for burglars and pillars, after all.”
“What happened?”
Once again, a slight show of surprise.
It worked like a charm – the strange insecurity that lingered in Sherlock’s eyes, like he expected to be mocked and shut out now that he had confided to his feelings, swiftly disappeared as he analysed John’s curious comment.
“Now come. I still have to show you our rooms, and my brother is no doubt impatiently waiting for me.”
This night, when Sherlock silently rose from his bed and left, John sat up. It was too much. He had taken too many superior or pitying looks, too many derisive remarks about him being lucky to be so highly paid for a job that didn’t seem to entail more than being stared at or talked to a few hours a day, too many blush-inducing whispers about why the Prince did keep him around. He had enough.
“A Prince’s knight, eh? Never heard of that. And I haven’t seen you much around him either – are you sure he knows you’re supposed to work for him?”
This time however, as he enquired about possible poisoners, threats or bribes seemed to have tied Smith’s tongue to the roof of his mouth, and instead of the five-minute conversation Sherlock had envisioned he found himself debating for next to an hour with the man. In the end it took him attentively studying the other man’s seedy shop and making precise threats as to what he could expose to the royal guard that would be impossible to hide before even the bumbling idiots could get there to even get one name.
Sherlock thought of sarcastically asking whether John knew many Mycrofts, but figured it was rather a bad idea to annoy someone who had his hands less than two inches away from your wounded arm.
Indeed, John, though I am glad to live in endless ignorance of your frequent dalliances.” It had torn Sherlock inside so many times when they lived together, watching John give his tenderest moments to strangers, leaving Sherlock alone and gasping for attention.
They walked along the streets in silence for two blocks before John felt Sherlock fumbling by his side.
John looked hard at him, considering the request. “You will have at least soup. It’s not heavy but you are seriously underweight, and you will use a lot of energy keeping up with your duties. Sex takes a lot of calories. However, I see your point. We will share breakfast and dinner every day, but you can opt out of lunch if you feel you really don’t need it. Understand me though, if I decide you need to eat, you will eat, or I will feed you, and you will not like that. I’m entirely prepared to treat you well if you abide by my requests. If you deliberately defy me, I will punish you, and I say deliberately because you will make many mistakes, and I understand that. I don’t punish for ignorance. I will correct you when necessary, but I will also punish you if you are being defiant or purposely difficult. I can still take you down several pegs if I feel you need it, so mark my word, pretty boy. Mind me, now.”
man. Living with the soldier had whetted an appetite he hadn’t even known he possessed and it was ravenous. John offered everything that the detective found appealing; he was dangerous, unpredictable, oddly demure about his endlessly vast array of hidden skills, and an incomparably loyal assistant in the field and elsewhere. John was a finely tuned instrument that had been tossed aside as if he were useless but he wasn’t. He was a surprise, a potentially lethal yet paradoxically nurturing surprise. The moment Sherlock met John, he knew he wanted more, so more and that the fastest way to get it was to move in together. Sherlock wanted everything, the complete package, the elusive
Danny spit on John’s shoes and John was stunned enough let him. There was shock, remorse, shame, regret, and hopelessness on the soldier’s face. Sherlock didn’t know what to make of it, Danny’s instantaneous and viperous attack stunned him.
desert, er,
giving up on John, just so you know. Danny and I really are helping one another. He’s got issues that need dealing with, and I’m going to assist him. The rest is just…mutual comfort. I need to do this, Molly, I need to…let go of some of it.”
Sherlock waited for John to continue speaking.
“That was
Sherlock’s head was heavy on John’s shoulder for a minute before he pulled away and sat back on his heels. He was rumpled looking, and a bit pensive but finally he sighed again and looked back up at John, “For a very long time I have denied certain things. I have argued that I haven’t the time for feelings or sentiment, but here I am, years into it, and I just can’t do it any longer.”
“It’s
“You were going to what?” Now Sherlock was the one to look thunderstruck.
John and Sherlock blushed equally bright and Danny laughed when Sherlock said, “That’s not funny. Rosie is still very young.”
“Best come with me, dearie.” Mrs Hudson just kept smiling gently and holding his hand. “Your brother and the Detective Inspector can come as well if you’d prefer.”
John was falling over himself to get to his sister. Harry looked a great deal like John, her features an impish and delicate replica of John. Her hair was a brighter shade than her brother’s, but their eyes were the same dark blue. People had often thought them twins, though they were not. Harry wrinkled her nose at the smell of him, her years of careful sobriety still shaky and subject to temptation if she wasn’t careful, “I ruined everything.”
He called the police, explaining that he had arrived home to discover a strange alpha had tried to assault his mate after breaking into their secured flat while his mate was entering heat. The broken lock on the exterior door was proof enough that the unconscious man had not been invited and had, in fact, forced his way. John was too far under the control of his inner alpha to realise that he’d unthinkingly publicly declared that he was Sherlock’s bond-mate. He made no effort to correct his declaration. Carefully, John carried the insensible omega to his bedroom and lay him out on his bed, checking his pulse as he pulled Sherlock’s mobile out, “Mycroft, it’s John. I came by to see Sherlock and some bloke was in the flat. He knocked Sherlock out before I could stop him. I don’t know what Sherlock’s situation is right now but I’m about to call for an ambulance. Whoever it was tried to force himself on Sherlock because he’s going into heat. I beat the bastard unconscious, so I suppose the police will be taking me away soon.”
Danny wasn’t as excited about it. In his experience, breaking into people’s homes and poking about their private offices wasn’t an especially safe hobby but Sherlock ignored his concern, “I’ll never find John if I rely solely on what information is legitimately available! Whoever has John took him for a reason, and I highly doubt it had nothing to do with me. There is something happening, and they need John to make it happen, and in order to stop it, I need to take John back from them.”
John hoped it did. He had absolutely nothing else of value left to offer.
“I’ll miss you both dreadfully.” John’s cheeks heated at the bald statement. Sherlock never said things like that.
a handsome stranger caused Mrs Hudson to break out in fancy nibbles. Danny protested but not very hard because Mrs Hudson fed them both a large and sturdy meal, made a huge pot of tea to go with it, and urged Danny to eat as much as he could. The man practically inhaled a full plate, and then went on to eat the plenty left on Sherlock’s. “Home cooked food,” groaned Danny, “It’s always amazing.
Sherlock took a deep breath before releasing it carefully, “Baskerville.” He was not happy. He was extremely
back again. When Sherlock entered the kitchen, he noticed an immediate difference. For one, there were actual cooking utensils in the drawer, and the cupboard was once again stocked with plates and bowls of various sizes. Sherlock felt a lump in his throat as he recognized the collection of familiar patterns. John didn’t own a single matching piece. He’d bought everything at second-hand stores one item at a time, getting whatever was cheap or eye-catching. Sherlock had to swallow hard as he took down a newly re-shelved mug. It had butterflies splashed around the rim, and there was a crack in the handle. He nearly kissed it but restrained himself, brewing a cup of tea to drink instead.
“Well, we’ll need to take more walks then, I’m getting slow on the chase.” Sherlock rubbed the small mound self-consciously and without thinking, John rubbed it too, his motions transmitting his opinion that Sherlock was not out-of-shape, and that John approved of his current state of fitness, and that everything was okay. He wanted to put his hand back or to keep hold of Sherlock somehow. John had missed his friend so deeply and he was fairly certain that he would never get over the need to verify that he was really there, and would remain. John worried that he’d gone too far with his touch but after his unintentional caress, Sherlock seemed to relax and made no comment about John’s intimate gesture. He simply strode down the street like it was any other moment in their friendship, and John was happy.
Sherlock had been running hot for years now. The game with Moriarty had spiralled into an insanely complicated life or death match of wits, one where the world’s only consulting detective had needed to die to win. He’d suffered so many times since then. He was covered with scars on his body and bruises on his soul. Sherlock
A huge grin split John’s face as he nodded, “Yes.” He was dragged onto the sofa where Sherlock wrapped his arms and legs about John as he cried openly, “Yes, Sherlock, yes!”
Sherlock felt awkward. He knew that he was a big man, there was nothing he could do about it. His hands were big, his head was big, he was just…big everywhere. John was better. He was just the right height and just the right weight and just the right everything else. Sherlock coveted and lusted after John’s body. He wanted to explore it everywhere and learn all he could about John’s delectable body.
Sherlock was distracted as he entered a series of numbers into a complicated form on his laptop, pausing a moment in his rapid keying to answer John, “I needed to try a few things out, just to test…”
“I never sleep for eight hours.” Eight hours solid with no nightmares that John could see. Sherlock was making the same realization and a self-satisfied smile developed, “I was right. This was what I needed.”
gentle hands on him, wanted to know what it was like to be treated as something to be treasured, someone to be enjoyed, and not a tool to be used, a weapon to be deployed, a weakness to be exploited, or a debt to be paid. Nearly everyone he cared for was angry with him or was maintaining their distance. Sherlock wanted something for himself right now, something he’d never asked for, ever. “Want to teach me how to have sex? I’ve never.”
“No, I did not know, not with certainty, and even now, I am only suspicious but there is no proof, no guarantee, not enough to move with.” Now Mycroft sounded frustrated, “I have been attempting to penetrate the site but with no luck. The exterior is impenetrable even though it is wide open. Any attempt to get within anywhere but the actual entrance would cause alarm well before the facility becomes vulnerable.”
“Good enough,” nodded Sherlock, flagging down a cab. “I’ll consider myself well-paid if you can do so in full view of at least five other members.”
It seemed to be the right thing to say because while John’s eyes were still intense, focused, they were also filled with something more, something Sherlock hadn’t quite expected to see. There was something there, something more than fondness. Love. John was looking at him with love in his eyes. It was overwhelming. “Forever it is, then, don’t forget.”
could compete with that. John made his priorities clear; Rosie first, everything else a far distant second.
Sherlock shook his head, “I allowed you to become vulnerable, and that vulnerability lead directly to where we are today, both of us shattered and nearly in ruins.” The omega pressed John’s hands between his, and looked at him imploringly, “I never meant to harm you and I never thought that the harms I took upon myself would linger so. I can offer you nothing at all but my continued selfishness because although I don’t deserve you a jot, I don’t want to let you go. There is no reason at all for you to want to stay with me.”
Sherlock Holmes wasn’t a

“John, you don’t even know for sure that there
“You can’t believe him! He’s a sociopath and a professional liar. He can’t know anything for certain.” Mary protested but she looked guilty. Everyone knew that omega scent receptors were incomparable, and being able to tell who fathered a child, or at least who hadn’t, was instinctual to omega everywhere.
Grief had caused him to cling to the first person who came onto him all those years ago when Sherlock Holmes had appeared to commit suicide in front of John. Sherlock had been his best friend, his flatmate, his partner, and John hadn’t seen it coming. In the months that followed, John was targeted by thousands of strangers online, bombarded with accusations and far too personal queries. By the time his now late wife, the mysterious Mary Morstan, had shown up, John was a wreck and it had been far too easy for her to gather up those ragged shards and put John back together in a semi-functional way.
John looked at Sherlock who was staring back at him. The omega’s gaze darted up and down John’s body, and soon enough, the conflicted scent of Sherlock’s upset increased dramatically. Sherlock and John both knew that Mycroft was right, but neither would bend enough to admit it. “We can’t be apart. I need him close to help me heal faster,” Sherlock argued contentiously.
Sherlock was silent but he immediately put the card into his own wallet. John handed him another gift. This one was more obvious, a new flashlight. It was bright yellow and oddly shaped, “Waterproof. You know we end up in tunnels or even the Thames more often than I’d like. There are pokey bits if you need to defend yourself against an attacker, it’s solid enough to be a pretty good cudgel, the lights can be set to high, low, dim, SOS, and so forth, there’s a knife at the base if you need to cut through anything, and you can leave it on for an entire year, probably, the battery really lasts.”
On the morning of the fifth day, John knew it was over. He woke before Sherlock and inspected the omega from head to toe. All his wounds had sealed over and were mostly healed, even the worst ones on his back. Sherlock no longer bore the rank stench of rotting flesh and infection but instead smelled alluringly of a combination of himself as well as his doctor. He was almost glowing. His scent was almost as dizzying an odour as the smell of Sherlock in full heat, almost as if they were a properly bonded pair, though John knew they would never be no matter how much Sherlock smelled like him right then. It was gloriously harmonious and gave him feelings he knew he should not be catering to.
John took Sherlock to Hyde Park to enjoy the Winter Wonderland. They ambled through, not really doing anything, but just enjoying knocking elbows with one another as they made their way through the crowds. Sherlock couldn’t recall being happier on Christmas. John had made his entire day fantastic. Without thinking, Sherlock put his arm around John’s shoulder, pulling him close as the walked. John didn’t protest. In fact, the doctor immediately put his hand around Sherlock’s waist, gripping his hip firmly as they continued to stroll. When they stopped to admire a display or ornaments, Sherlock allowed his arm to fall away but John caught him by the hand and held tight to it. Sherlock smiled and let him.
, the person who supports the people he loves, the man who is there when he’s needed, who gives a damn about their happiness. I don’t even recognise you anymore! If you want Sherlock to know he’s the most important thing in your life, then you have to show him. So what if he has a boyfriend? He’s
The scent was what he noticed first. All the other alphas in the room had also noticed it as well, he wasn’t the only one lifting his head to sniff at it. It was the most compelling scent he’d ever come across. There were heart-breakingly rich strains of a long-lost scent; cedar, rosewood, ocean surf, and so many other wild untamed things. It was richer, fuller, more pungent than he recalled as if someone had taken his aural memory and jacked it up from black and white into technicolour. There were other scents mixed in, something like old blood, or foetid flesh, but just a distant hint, and definitely not enough to keep the rest of the scent from being completely alluring.
You have a mission. You are going to go back to that Victorian time-capsule you revere so much, dig yourself in, and let your man see how you feel about him! Damn it, John! You are British! Giving up so easily is nearly treason! Danny is a bump in the road, that’s all. Stiff upper lip, or
“For the thousandth time, don’t push me, Mary, I’m not one of your little projects.” David’s voice was harder and more biting that John could recall ever hearing it, “If you hadn’t decided to keep a contract as a pet, we wouldn’t need to do this now. After Jim topped himself we could have gone to work somewhere warm, but you just couldn’t miss the chance to try and own someone, could you?” His voice had faded and become a bit muffled as he did as he’d been ordered. He came back to Mary and John listened as they slowly proceeded to the next alley-entrance. It was next to the bins they were still hiding behind. “We’ve been allowed to dillydally long enough, time to earn our fun money.”
. Growling softly, he clenched his fists and took one step toward Sherlock’s brother, “I am here of my own free will.”
Sherlock looked despondent still, and his voice was flat and empty, “Let’s just go, John. I don’t care who is at our wedding, I just wanted to…to be yours,
Sherlock knew he was jealous, but didn’t he have the right, now? “Someone amazing?” His voice was bitter, and he knew that too.
might want to do that you don’t let yourself do. That didn’t strike me as being very fair, I want you to keep exploring your interests. If pretty clothing is something you want to see about, then I want to support that. I think you look very lovely right now, but honestly, I think you look lovely when you wear one of your fine suits, or even when you slouch around the flat wearing your moth-eaten pyjamas.”
John felt something beginning to burn red hot inside his chest just as Sherlock stood, looming over the frightened official, “I don’t
“Not exactly.”

, John. The extra physical contact was continuing, becoming expected, anticipated, enjoyed, and it was making Sherlock’s head spin a bit.
Sherlock looked up. The unshaven man was thin inside his heavy coat, almost weedy, and his head boasted curls that were as dark as Sherlock’s but wilder still, and only a few years younger than he was. The man’s eyes were blue, full of intelligence, and more than a touch of mirth evenly mixed with sadness. There was exhaustion, grief, resolution, determination, and an easy-going, unthreatening, even engaging energy about him. He looked worn out and heartsick. He looked like someone who just needed a small break, for just a minute. Sherlock felt a pang of empathy for the person.
was lonely too, and for the first time since he was a teen, his transport and his mind were in perfect sync. Sherlock didn’t much care for endlessly pining after his friend but stopping was apparently impossible so endured it instead. The feelings he’d been forced to confront during his absence only grew stronger with each day that passed and the physical itch that was forever unsated only grew deeper and less resistable with each moment that passed.
fancy and had come to a point in his young life where he didn’t have the willpower to deny it. Certainly, it was a bit risky coming to a bar like this dressed as he was, but the kind of action he was looking for made certain demands. Sherlock knew his arse looked amazing in the worn jeans he had managed to get on, and that the dark aubergine button-down he had on made the colours of his eyes just pop, enhanced only a tiny bit with the merest smudge of smoky eyeliner.

Sherlock scrolled through the texts and they were no better than the voicemails. John swore, insulted, belittled, and acted as
“You mean a more reliable alpha?” John couldn’t help the thread of anger and the implied insult stung him far more deeply than he could have expected. Sherlock was safe with him except that he wasn’t, not if last night’s behaviour counted against John, and in his view, it ought to. Guilt made him almost snarl, “You don’t have to worry about me, Mycroft. I’m engaged to someone, and I have more than enough self-control to resist bedding an omega while he’s unconscious and unable to say yes.”

for me. I bear so many scars, and I will for the rest of my days. They are on the outside of me, no one will ever be able to view me without them being between us but your scars…they’re all on the inside now. I did that to you, and I’m so sorry John. I should have realized that you were as fragile and broken as I was and now look at you. You fixed me, like you always do, when you shared my heat, and look how I’ve repaid you.
“What,
John was incapable of keeping his omega happy. He was a source of constant disappointment to Sherlock, that was a fact. John hung his head.
It was like being pulled apart and being completed at the same time. John’s cock felt intrusive and right simultaneously. Sherlock wasn’t certain that he could process the many feelings he was experiencing right then. There was pleasure and discomfort, desire as well as apprehension. He was vulnerable right then, John could do anything to him. The doctor seemed to understand and rained kisses on Sherlock’s back and shoulders as he pressed himself deeper. Sherlock grunted, trying to control his body’s need to expel John.
Exhaling carefully, John fought to bring himself under control. It was hard though; his emotional state was currently nearly identical to how he’d felt the days after he’d watched Sherlock commit suicide. John felt out-of-control, stuck in an emotional free fall that had no apparent end in sight. He felt grief, anger, shame, regret, bitterness, and loss, all at the same time. It was too much. He needed to get out of the filthy alley and go somewhere else. There was a place nearby he’d frequented often. Walking through the door, John ordered his first drink, laying his credit card on the counter, “I need to get drunk,” he told the bartender.
Sherlock collapsed. John rushed forward just in time to keep Sherlock from falling onto their coffee table. Cursing himself again. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” John felt like an absolute heel. No matter their disagreement, he knew better than to shout at Sherlock. Now he had to watch while Sherlock shook and groaned, lost in his mind as his terrors swallowed him whole. John wrapped his arms around his too-thin friend as they knelt on the dirty carpet, and wished for the millionth time that he could endure this misery for him. “I’m here. I’m not mad. I’m here, Sherlock. I’m watching over you. I’ll protect you. I’m keeping you safe. It’s okay, Sherlock, shh, it’s all okay.”
Whatever it was that John had on her made her cease protesting instantly. Instead, she tried to brazen her way forward, “Clean him up, Watson. He doesn’t have any chances left. If he loses his competency, he’s going to end up institutionalized.”
John knew he was beaten. He’d never had much willpower when Sherlock was concerned, and now, it seemed that he had none now that he knew how the man still felt about him. “I don’t want to hurt you again,” he stated unhappily, “You know I will. I’m doing it already.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shrugged off Mrs Hudson’s hand angrily, “Let me go. I have no idea why you thought I’d be interested in this farce of a meeting.”
“He.”
bed, and it sounds like you’ve never stopped fucking him.”
They looked at each other and suddenly, all their old excuses, and all the old reasons, none of it made sense anymore. John stepped closer and pulled Sherlock into a hard embrace, holding his friend as tightly as he could as he pressed his face against Sherlock’s long neck. “You’re home. I’m never letting you go, not ever.”
“And we aren’t going to!”
“It’s okay, never mind, it was a stupid idea.” John stood up, “I’ll figure something out, don’t worry about it. Thank you for coming all this way.”
“You’re welcome?” John didn’t understand what was going on.
“You’re hurt more than from what I did!” John realized suddenly that Sherlock was trying to hide himself from John, to drive the alpha away before something more was revealed. He looked at Sherlock’s bruised face, the swelling he had caused, and then the further lacerations made by the man still unconscious on the street. Shame filled him as John understood that Sherlock had been abused by every alpha he had encountered so far, John included.

“I did in Baskerville when I
are the doctor in our great partnership, my John, how can I fix this?”
John was still smiling, “I like the disturbing bits, they’re brilliant. I like all the bits, in fact.”
“No, it’s normally during the day or occasionally, in the evening. Other friends are willing to do overnight care but so far, I haven’t needed to.” It was getting close to the end of the afternoon, Rosie would want to be at the flat soon, they needed to go. Sherlock cut his eyes at Danny and then looked away, “I live not far from here.”
Flushed and damp with nervous sweat, John finally left the shop with a small discreet bag clutched in his hand. He had no idea what he was doing any longer and went back to the flat to put the new garter set in with the skirt and stockings.
Sherlock watched from the sofa as John painstakingly tapped out a text. Every single character he sent off into the aether made him furious.
Neither man mentioned John’s past marriage nor the terrible fallout. All that seemed to matter what that he was available to bond with Sherlock, and if that bond leads to children, then that was fine with both of them. “So you’ll…” Sherlock suggestively tilted his head a bit.
best friend, don’t be an arse.
His hair was currently dyed a burnished copper, a deliberate dig at his older brother who coveted Sherlock’s naturally raven curls. He looked delicious as a ginger, too, another fact that made Mycroft’s lips purse with disapproval.
to devote himself to you, isn’t that right,
. Sherlock would verbally eviscerate whoever was trying to dominate him before physically incapacitating them. Just because he was out as an omega now didn’t cause the doctor to forget how very capable Sherlock was in hand to hand combat. He could do nearly anything John could do. His biology clearly had not prevented him from developing whichever skills he’d deemed necessary. He sighed impatiently. John wished Mary would just let up, even for just a few minutes so that he could think. She’d been like this for nearly an hour now.
. John dropped the heavy duffle by the door, “I ended it. It’s over between Mary and me.”
. I didn’t know about
. Each bout they won earned them another small hand-weapon. John now had his own cosh and a small shield that strapped to his forearm. His neighbour had earned a strange looking metal glove, something he called a cestus. It looked a lot like a pair of rather uncomfortable fingerless gloves but the metal panel across the knuckles amplified the power of his blows tenfold. Unfortunately, with each advantage they were granted, their foes were given four times over. John and the stranger he depended on battled people wearing padded armour, impervious helmets, and sharpened edges.
“What then?”
He could feel it. Somewhere inside, Sherlock had tethered himself to John’s soul. There was an invisible conduit there, something shining and brilliant, and theirs.
that John dished his way because he
John knew very well what Mycroft was asking, what he was threatening. The elder Holmes was intimating that he would find a different alpha to anonymously service his younger brother in his time of need. It would traumatise Sherlock’s mind to share himself with a stranger, but it would save his body. Toys wouldn’t be enough while the omega was so damaged. Sherlock needed to physically interact with an alpha for his body to stabilise, his injuries demanded it. Freshly produced alpha pheromones would do him more good than denying him. If Sherlock knew and cared for the alpha, it would be more effective and less debilitating in the long run. Part of an alpha’s chemical makeup was the ability to boost an omega’s self-healing capacity and Sherlock desperately needed an alpha. John couldn’t let Sherlock be hurt more than he already was, and he didn’t need to think things over, “You know I will.” Distantly, John thought of his fiancée.
“I should stop. You wouldn’t want this if we hadn’t had so much to drink. This is wrong, then.” John pulled his fingers out and tried to flounder away but Sherlock stopped him by flopping over the doctor like a drunken comfort blanket, trapping him on the carpet between their coffee table and the sofa. “Sherlock, let me leave, you’re off your head, you don’t want sex with anyone! I’m not going to have sex with you!”
“Crying is good for you. You can’t keep it inside forever, beautiful man, it’s better to let it go. You’ll see clearer now.” Danny was right. Sherlock saw that he’d been in an emotional twist for so long that parts of him were atrophying. He was rotting inside, and the festering sections needed cauterizing. He had to learn to live again, to heal, to grow. Danny kissed him, “You’re doing me no end of good, Sherlock, just know that. I hope I’m doing the same.”
, but if you were going to list everything you would be going on for days. The more you learned about Sherlock Holmes made you aware of how much there was yet to discover about his complex personality, not that anyone got that far. He didn’t have friends, so he said because honestly, who would want to befriend someone like him?
“He’s going to arrest him?” Sherlock felt miserable.
all the time? You haven’t lived there in how long now, but you’ve never once stopped calling it home. That’s pretty telling, isn’t it? Okay, no, your chances at making it up to Sherlock are dismal, but if anyone can do so, it’s you. John, buck up, find your spine, pull your testicles out from wherever you stored them and go win back your man! Sherlock has loved you for
Mycroft sighed, “Flattering as it is that you deem me omnipotent, I am merely human. I’m not the only clever man in Whitehall. There are many who have the sway, resources, and ambition to manage a black site. We could be following a false trail, the description seems correct, but the timeline isn’t. My sources report of a blond military man with blue eyes that is being held but insist that it’s been a good year or more. John hasn’t been gone that long, and the description is far too vague to assure me that it is
John looked bitterly at the sink which was blamelessly filling with hot soapy water for the dishes. “Not her, no, but this case would have never gone on as long if you’d been doing the work to begin with.
“Yes.” Sherlock had given him permission to answer her questions and John preferred to do so with words and not his eyelids. “Sherlock told me to leave but I refused. I want to be here. I don’t need to be anywhere Sherlock isn’t.”
. Serendipitous as their meeting was, Sherlock planned to take every opportunity with Danny. He’d help him solve his case, have sex, learn how to be in a relationship, and do everything that he’d never get to do with John.
6:00 am – You are likely still asleep. Text me when you wake. SH
“I shagged you bow-legged, leave off, I’m proud of myself.” Danny winked and helped Sherlock into the shower, both men serenely washing each of off. “You know, it’s so weird how easy this is. You’re the first person I’ve been with since Alex.”
my arse, Sherlock pretends to be a detective when we all know he’s just fucking clients for money. He’s a rent-boy, that’s it, that’s all he’ll ever be, he can’t help it, he’s an omega! He’s made to be fucked, all he wants is to be fucked, nothing else matters to him. No omega has the brains to be even close to clever. All they can do is make babies.”
“This help?” he gestures with his head, and my eyes follow. John had rearranged the blankets using a spare from the sitting room so that we each had one. I wouldn’t have to share my duvet. He must have pulled in an extra sheet as well.
John walks in on Sherlock bent over a microscope in the lab at St. Barts. Scratch that.
Again, when the tea is finished, Sherlock resumes his playing. But this time, after the mugs are rinsed, I grab my duvet and shuffle back downstairs and into my chair. I tuck my Union Jack pillow under my head, and settle in, ready to sleep, rocked there by the music. With all my senses filled as they were, filled with the rightness of home, I know I will sleep without nightmares for at least tonight.
Except one.
The smile drops from my face, and my eyes slide closed. Yet another conversation I'm not ready to have tonight. But this time, this time I can't
“Just… you’ve definitely been avoiding me.”
Clearing his throat and glancing away, he asks, “Do you have a preference for side?” Pointing, I indicate the side away from the door, knowing that he does better being able to see the entrance without an obstructed view. It doesn't help that I tend to sleep in the middle of the bed, removing the whole idea of a side, but I'm sure I'll manage.
” Anderson’s nostrils flare, and John put up his hands in front of him, not touching, just on guard. The glare Anderson gives John is full of enough vitriol that John is surprised he doesn’t melt under the heat of it.
With a mild nod, I hum, “Mmm. Yes. I do think I’ll try.” Stepping away, John gives me the space to stand. I grab my robe and wrap it around myself as I do. Turning back to look at John, I hold his gaze with my own, both of us recognizing that something has settled between us. With a slight smile and a nod of gratitude, I make my way back to bed knowing I would not be bothered with dreams of Serbia again, at least for tonight. As we pass each other, John pats my shoulder before trailing his fingers down to my elbow as we part. He must know what these touches do to me. Too relaxed to prevent myself, I lean into the heat left behind by his absence.
Greg grimaces. “Not sure I can do that without thinking of your brother now.”
in your life, I swear you will always have Rosie. Whatever you want. I couldn’t do that to her anymore than I could do it to you.”
A flurry of dark curls and swirling coat move past John, nothing cleaned from Sherlock’s experiment.
Regaining my breath and waiting until I trust my voice not to betray me, I gather myself enough to say, “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I can’t do this tonight. I’m going to bed.” The music stops with an ascending screech.
Closing my eyes, I focus on those sounds, drawing reassurance from them, from the proof of life they provide, and decide to take the plunge. “He takes you from me, John, he wins. I died and destroyed his network, I was tortured to prevent that. Even when the events have nothing to do with him, my subconscious makes him the puppeteer, the spider in the web, even in death. And I lose you. I always lose you. In every one, in some way, I lose you. The Rehab, The Pool, Baskerville, Norbury, Bonfire Night, Serbia, Eurus, Culverton. In every version, I lose you.” Out of breath, the last three words come out in a hush.
John rests his arm across both Rosie and Sherlock, his hand falling on Sherlock’s side. Rubbing gentle circles into Sherlock's back with his thumb, John takes a moment to appreciate the family they have made together. It was a long road getting here, and the thought brings a smile to his face.
, including me. After all, I'm the only friend he's got. He's said as much.
Before I reveal myself too much, I close back in and take another sip. No matter how much he meant—means—to me, there is still something else eating at me.
The light dances across his features, letting me memorize the planes of his face in ways I haven't been allowed before. John, asleep, or nearly so, in my bed, next to me. The thought is baffling. Never would I have believed we would end up here, like this. It's more than I had hoped for, especially after my return and his marriage to Mary. But all of that is being put behind us now.
When Sherlock flashes a look of incredulity, John realizes the answer is everywhere. “Oh, Sherlock." He pauses in consideration. "Fine. Where does it hurt the least? Where can I help support you?”
Sherlock doesn’t. “You’re right. I didn’t. Not when your life was in the balance. Though I didn’t realize how much it still would be.” I lift my head and glare at him then. Sherlock's gaze bores into me, stern, but still seeking forgiveness, still understanding he put me through more than he bargained on, still sorry for the pain he caused. I don't know how to respond to that. So I keep looking at him, staring into his eyes, searching for the question I need answered.
“Oh.” Sherlock blinks. “
"Books, computers, my phone, other people, windows, anything they could think of to take away. Without the cocaine and nothing else to stimulate my mind, I started devolving. At first, I raged, I screamed and hurled insults and deductions. But then, I shut down. Went quiet for weeks. Stopped eating. I went deep into my mind palace, much smaller than it is now, but a place I could still allow myself to be lost in. After spending two weeks completely absorbed in my mind, I started dismantling the place one brick at a time. If I was to be stuck in a life without a way to use my brain, what use was it to me anyway.
I swing the door open before me. My room is awash in the warm, fluorescent light of the lamp on the nightstand, catching the gold and silver hues of John’s hair resting atop the pillow. He looks up at me through his eyelashes. I stare down at him, and he smiles.
He angles toward me. “Unless there is anything you want to ask, I think that’s all. Wait for me?”
The look on Sherlock's face puts a chill through me. An empty look of the dead. But he soldiers on with his story.
“John, before this goes any further, you need to know something. You were right. That first night when I told you I wasn’t looking for anyone, I meant it. I don’t do relationships.” He huffs but doesn’t interrupt or pull away. “I’ve never been interested in anyone until you. I don’t know what it will be like, what I will be comfortable with. I like this, right here, right now. But I don’t know if there will be anything else.” John blinks at me. Twice. A third time.
decide you don’t want
“Sounds wonderful.”
With a nod and a hum of agreement, John falls back into me, his weight a welcome presence against my chest. He slips his hand over mine and tucks them both under his chin. As my eyes fall shut, a smile on my face, I know this will be the first of many nights like this.
Sending a calculating glance in John’s direction, he responds, “Most recently, Serbia. But to answer the question you are really asking, dismantling Moriarty’s network. I had to make sure that there was no one left to threaten your life. I…” When Sherlock leans back in his chair, he bolts straight up again, face contorting in pain.
John's arms unfurl from the space between us, and he grips me in them, pressing his face in my chest.
Entering the bedroom, I freeze. I have no idea what to do next. Without my consent, my body starts fluttering around, tidying things around me. A hand rests on my arm.
Murmured words brush against my hair, barely audible. “That’s what mine are about, too. Losing the people I love.”
Overwhelmed by his feelings, by his sudden and screaming desire to cross the room and kiss the man staring at him, John hurls one of the sticky hands with a desperate throw. It hits Sherlock on the lips with a
“Have I ever told you about my nightmares of Afghanistan?”
" That's all it can be, and I can't lose him by pushing him where he can not go.
My heart swells in a welcome ache, feeling as if it will escape from my chest altogether. That John would still want this, want me. “Ok.” I let myself be pulled back in close, relishing in the warmth, the closeness, the sentiment.
With careful fingers and gentle hands, John helps slips off the jacket and shirt, stage by stage to prevent any additional harm to Sherlock. When he finally has the clothing removed, he walks around to Sherlock’s back and takes in the sight.
A sheepish look crosses Sherlock’s face. “Right. I was supposed to meet you for dinner at Angelo’s. I’m sorry. I...I’ve been wrapped up in the case and…”
Reaching into the bag, John pulls out a stick with two plastic hands at the top. He gives it a shake. “Say something smart.”
“Sherlock, what the bloody hell?” John starts to ask as he takes in Sherlock’s pale face, the sweat forming on his forehead, the tense posture, and the askew angle to his shoulders as he favors one side. “You’re hurt. We need to get you looked at. Let’s get you to Bart’s.” John stands to help Sherlock up, and Sherlock waves him away.
“Now, now. Don’t try to hide it from me. Caring isn’t an advantage, but now that you’ve already fallen, might as well make it work.” Mycroft plucked a pale-green macaroon from Sherlock's plate and observed it as he spoke again. “It’s quite obvious how much you two have fallen for each other. Don’t ruin it.” As he popped the sugary confection into his mouth, he turned and walked to Lestrade.
Sherlock’s remaining days in isolation pass without much interaction with John, to both his dismay and relief. He shouts for Mrs. Hudson to leave his food outside the door and retreats to his nest of blankets with John’s jumper-wrapped pillow, refusing to let John in when he knocks.
“Well, that...clears it up. I think,” Lestrade says, obviously considering the storyline. “But, hold up, how did you know to check the fingerprints in the first place?”
I hadn’t realized how tense I was until my shoulders relax under his ministrations. As my breathing returns to normal and the shaking subsides, I can hear a soft shushing coming from above me, a cheek cushioned against my head.
John. His lovely John. Well not his John, but his John. Always protecting. A smirk played at the corner of Sherlock’s lips. How could he have ever doubted John for a second?
“Oh, John,” she exclaims, handing the socks over with a warm pat on his shoulder. “You two made up, then?”
Five minutes later, Sherlock licks a doorknob to identify a substance smeared on the dented metal. John struggles not to go nuclear. “Oh my
With the possibility of illness on the horizon, he can’t bring himself to make any promises to Sherlock. Not when Sherlock could lose him so quickly afterward. The flowers won’t last, and the card is dated, and now both are irrelevant.
“John,” Sherlock said from his perch in front of the microscope on the table. John halted on his way to his chair and waited for Sherlock to continue. Without taking his focus away from the slide, hands adjusting the knobs for a better visual, Sherlock made the most unusual request.
John turns toward me, leaning against the counter, ankles crossed, and speaks in a low voice, respectful of the topic. “I didn’t know that. We’ve never talked about your time away. For either of us.” He licks his lips. “When did Serbia happen?”
We stand there, like that, until my breathing returns to normal.
“John, I am sorry,” Sherlock breathes against my hair.
I bolt upright in bed, gasping for air, no longer feeling the needles in my lungs. I search out John’s eyes, his calm but concerned eyes.
John’s conscience supplied) jealous.
“That would be agreeable.”
John can’t help but roll his eyes. The stupid man would never stay in hospitals as long as he needed to. “Alright. Fine. Let me help though. Where does it hurt?”
“Hello, Little Watson. How was school today?”
I stifle a giggle as he flicks his hand through the air. "He kicked me off his scene but didn’t arrest me that night. I felt exhilarated at what I had done. I knew that this could keep my mind occupied if I let it."
When they finally part, the sound of their synchronized panting is loud, each seeking the breath fled from their aching lungs.
Smiling down at him, I give a short nod. “Of course.” After a quick rinse of the mugs, I place them in the sink and resign myself to a rough night of sleep. Hearing Sherlock’s story and bringing forth my own memories of Afghanistan makes it inevitable. I knew that from the beginning. Upstairs, I crawl into bed, being careful to not wake Rosie as she sleeps in her crib on the other side of the room. When the sounds of Sherlock’s violin waft up the stairs and wrap me in warmth and comfort, I can't help but smile at the familiar refrains. Drifting off, I hope that it won't be a bad night after all.
“The wife of the victim was clearly cheating on him with their business partner. They run a legitimate travel business allowing them the ability to travel all over the world, in this case, to Australia. However, the wife was getting bored with her lifestyle and decided a bit of black market exotic animal smuggling sounded like a good idea.” He shows something on his phone to Lestrade. “So, the three of them, husband, wife, and sexy boy toy made their way to Australia and got their hands on a koala bear. When they got back, the deal went south. She convinced the boy toy to kill the husband and then take her and the koala back to Australia to try again later. They probably left on the flight back that same day.”
John couldn’t help his grin. Sherlock was buoyant and happy, his eyes almost sparkling with joy and eagerness. If he wanted to make traditions with John then John would happily do anything at all, if it kept that look on Sherlock’s face. “Fine, how about a fancy brunch? Give us time to wake up and get a bit of an appetite? We can open presents first, and maybe have one of those poncy coffees that Mycroft keeps giving you.”
Sherlock pulled back and hauled John’s hips to the edge of the bed the moment he got his feet under him. Impatient once more, Sherlock pushed John’s thighs as wide as they would go, making John hold them in position before he used one hand to position his cock, and began to push in. John’s eyes rolled back into his head at the intensity of it all. Being pierced like this was nothing he could have imagined before. He felt his hole give way to the blunt strength of Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock was trembling and kept pressing forward relentlessly. John groaned as the mix of pain and pleasure confused him. Sherlock’s cock was splitting him apart and he loved every second of it.
“He doesn’t want to be anywhere else.” Mycroft was serious, “I wanted him to be admitted to a hospital. His bloodwork is incomplete. He won’t submit to an exam. He seems healthy enough to recover from his ordeal, but he is also a master at hiding his hurts.”
Despite that, it was only seconds before Sherlock replied.
This might have worked if John had not been an alpha who required twice as many calories in a day than any omega, even gestating ones. The dense musculature and physiology of an alpha required a high energy output, even when they were relaxing. Simply put, John needed to eat a lot, and frequently. He wasn’t. Sherlock drank a lot of tea so at least, the alpha remained hydrated, but the toll of not enough food was making itself known, and fast. The first day was troublesome, the second day a misery, and half-way through the third day, John passed out. Sherlock was alarmed and brought John in to be checked out at A&E.
Mycroft checked John again, and passively, the alpha let it happen. “If bonding were possible…”
“I know.” Danny said in an offhand way, “It’s part of the reason you keep me around, that and the phenomenal sex.”
They didn’t seem to need to speak. When Sherlock was ready to move, John provided one last glass of juice to help drink down the pain relievers and other medications that the omega would require. John knew his alpha pheromones were being inhaled, and that they were already triggering the healthful cascade of chemical effects that would encourage the omega to heal himself. Sherlock was finally drowsing, so John helped him back to his bedroom to lay down. Sherlock allowed John to treat his many wounds, falling asleep as the doctor meticulously cleaned, stitched, drained, and bandaged all that he could. Some of the tiny ones were already knitting together before John’s eyes. Omega recuperated quickly when their heat was imminent, their peculiar biology adapted to compensate for the primitive aggressiveness of alphas who frequently caused their mates physical damage from the ferocity of their passions. It took a lot of energy though, so making sure Sherlock ingested as many calories as possible was urgent. John hoped to capitalize on that trait to give Sherlock a better chance of going through it without setting himself back. If the omega didn’t recover completely the John would have no choice but to seek additional medical support via a clinic or hospital, and he knew Sherlock would hate it.
, he knew she did, and she let him do what he had every intention of continuing doing, and in exchange, he remained present and accounted for. At least they each got to spend the dark hours of the night in a restful stupor. Daylight hours trickled painfully away for both of them.
“Now?” Sherlock looked hopeful.
.” The promise sounded like a threat but John was more aroused than he’d ever felt and he knew his words were a dare, just like Sherlock’s were. He’d never felt so alive nor so brilliantly happy. His cock felt like it was about to explode, and he dragged Sherlock up for another deep searing kiss. “I love you, Sherlock. I’m going to fuck you better than anyone ever has before.”
to be you. Why can’t you since you are
Sherlock wasn’t sure how to feel.
“I accept.”
get legally married to one another, but that no court in this land will even support a civil partnership due to a possible bond with some unknown third party?”
He wasn’t wrong. An almost invisible door opened, and two cautiously moving men came through it. They were wearing body armour, and both carried stout wooden cudgels. John was still naked and was only wearing his mask. They had no weapons. All they had were their wits and no time was wasted. The moment the door closed, both men flung themselves directly at John and the man he was imprisoned with.
.” John felt tears well up and he hid his face in his hands, ashamed to be weeping noisily over a broken heart in front of his sister. All the booze he’d consumed wasn’t helping at all, he felt nearly sober already. “I’ve lost him.” From there the entire story tumbled out. John confessed the deeds that weighed so heavily on his blackened soul, telling his sister everything he’d kept inside for so long, “I don’t know what to do, Harry! He’s happy. He looks…they were…I saw…Harry, what do I do? Danny
“Papa, I’m forty-two,” sighed Sherlock.
, John Watson.” Sherlock scrambled for his mobile after kicking John in the stomach, causing the soldier to gasp for air and go to his knees. Stabbing the keys, Sherlock shouted into it, “Police? I’m being assaulted. Help! I’m on Baker Street...”
getting milk for his evening tea when Sherlock came across him again. Just as with the conference, Sherlock seemed stunned that John was right in front of him. This time, however, before John could walk off and leave him undisturbed, Sherlock grabbed his hand and wouldn’t let go, blurting, “I barely knew that man! He’d flirted with me at the conference and walked me back to my room but that is all. He presumed a great deal by kissing me in front of you. He knew who you were, that’s why he did it. John...I was serious. Please, John, just...let me make a case for myself before you decide anything.”
“John, why are you kneeling in front of me and drooling?” John was doing exactly that, and he had no words but Gingerbread Sherlock did. “John, if you wanted to look up my skirt, all you needed to do was ask.” Sherlock’s tone was naughty and inviting so John nodded, and Sherlock lifted the bit of fabric up. John stopped breathing. Sherlock’s stockings were all he had on, the sheer fabric doing nothing to hide Sherlock’s bollocks nor his cock. “I expect that I’m a present for you John, you’d best unwrap me.” His deep rumbling voice was so seductive.
John looked concerned, shifting closer to take Sherlock’s hand in his. He moved carefully, touching Sherlock with delicacy and the small motion made Sherlock’s heart feel strange. Anxiety ratcheted upward, and his sore heart beat frantically for a moment. He was simultaneously horrified and thrilled that John was so close. Sherlock had visions of himself attempting to jerk his hand away but instead, his entire body went limp with relief at the contact, his transport completely out of tune with his mind. “I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you alert again. Your eyes…” John trailed off for a moment before he continued, his gaze soft and serious at the same time, “I’ve missed seeing your eyes. I thought I’d never get to look into them again.”
problem. He hadn’t made a fuss about it, he’d just gone ahead and done it. Sherlock felt a twinge of something he couldn’t define. John made no accusation, gave no hint of disappointment. He was understanding and careful, anticipating each stage of recovery, and easing Sherlock along as gently as he could. They knew each other well, and in a crisis, John could always be counted on, he was thorough, steadfast, watchful, and professional.
but in the Chinese curse kind of way. I had problems too, fuck, I was such a mess. A complete tart, dangerously so, but that’s a whole different part of my past. With Alex, it was different than the shags at parties or bars.
7:16 am – You do still prefer your coffee black? I will find some cream and sugar just in case.
“He’s offering condolences, you big dolt. John is being
Sherlock looked as surprised as John felt as the words came out of his mouth without thought. John was equally surprised that he kept that same mouth shut instead of instantly backtracking and allowing Sherlock to leave. He didn’t deserve Sherlock but if the man was determined to be with him, then growing their intimacy was a step in the right direction. “While I would love that, John, are you certain? This is our new beginning, are you sure this isn’t too fast for you?”
“Don’t call it a little wee,” John was both embarrassed and thrilled.
Danny slapped Sherlock’s behind as he walked away, and to his credit, Sherlock didn’t even flinch, behaving as if someone touched his bum familiarly all the time. John’s jaw could not fall further but he tried, “He
sort of snapshot of how we live, that’s why I was texting so much.
Sherlock managed to look up at John for only a moment before cutting his eyes away once more, “You’re not embarrassed?”
“I want more, John, I want it all. I want to be your colleague, your friend, your lover, your mate, and I want your bond. I want the entire world to know that I’ve got an alpha worthy of any ten others, that I’ve managed to find my perfect match. That’s you, John. You are everything I’ve fought so long and so hard to protect, and if you want it too, I would have you right now. I will bare my neck for you, John, and only you.”
Sherlock was outraged but also embarrassed. They’d run through more than one dank alley and his shoes had finally become saturated with malodorous liquids. The detective had done his best to save them, since they were the pair he’d owned the longest, and had decided to ignore their ever-increasing stench in favour of keeping his sentimental favourites. John knew that he’d pay for days for pointing this out, but it would be worth it if the air in their shared living areas became non-toxic once more.
. John brought Rosie to the posh child-care facility where she spent her days. There was a newly single mother there, one who had been flirting heavily with John since they’d met. During the outdoor play part of the morning, John bought the woman a hot coffee from the kiosk nearby, smiling a bit when he got the second for free, his regular server handing over his with a sly grin that John returned. He was flirting too hard to make note of the sour aftertaste of it.
Sherlock’s words stung, fanning the flames of doubt that John knew had already been there, and the doctor had to privately admit that Sherlock had hit the mark several times over. The feeling of shame and regret filled him once more, but so did a sense of concern. John had heard of omegas entering a feral state if they were threatened for too long. Sherlock seemed on the cusp of it, and John knew that he was responsible for his share of what had frightened the man. He had to make it right somehow. “Mycroft knows I am here. He’s sending supplies. I’m just here to help you, that’s it. If anyone can bring you your alpha, it’s your brother.”
Three weeks later, John was back in London. It was the holidays now, and all the joyful cheeriness made him feel ill and disconnected from the city he’d once loved to live in. Now, he preferred being constantly on the move. He’d toured through several countries in the EU, delivering his presentation to various crowds of police and detectives. He never stayed anywhere for longer than a night, never accepted offers to go for dinner or to meet privately, or anything even remotely social. Instead, John kept his contacts with others strictly professional, only perusing his email on his tablet when he had a free moment, and never checking his mobile. No one called him these days, anyway, nor did he want them to. John spent his free time alone, and during those times, John lost himself in memories of when he became the worst person in the world.
“Hung?” John repeated.
It would have probably been better for the two of them if John had made Sherlock admit that the danger John was in was pretty minor and that he could leave their chambers without risking finding his knight a corpse when he returned – he was pretty sure that he could have convinced Sherlock, had he really tried. He had been held back, however, by the truly distressed look Sherlock sported every time he even brought up the idea; somehow John suspected that there was more to this than a need to make sure he was safe, but he couldn’t think of anything that’d make the other man feel insecure and desirous to spend all his spare time in his company.
Sherlock couldn’t help his mouth tightening a little as he thought about what Moriarty had already done.
“King Mycroft, Prince Sherlock, you honour me with your invitation.”
“You won’t be surprised to hear you’re quite right once more. Sire.”
The threat was thrown light-heartedly enough but was very clear all the same and the boy – Melchior – quickly left after a last sneer in his direction. John turned to thank his helper, finding a young woman whose well-made dress indicated as a servant of a high-enough status.
“I’m sorry that inflexible traditions will keep her from participating to the two main feasts from as close as you’d perhaps prefer, but I assure you she’ll enjoy the table she’ll be sat at. I’ve also noticed you haven’t brought any secondary taster with you, so I’ve taken the liberty of assigning you one of ours for the two evenings of the ceremony.”
And yet…As he parried a blow that certainly wasn’t a part of regular fencing – but then he had hardly expected them to play by the rules – John registered that two of their opponents were already on the ground and that a third would soon join them. The other man certainly could hold his own in a row, but it was more than that: their fighting styles simply suited each other, and John found himself marvelling that he could have found such a perfect battle partner so far from home and in such bizarre circumstances.
“Tea,” called Danny, deliberately not hearing John, instead exiting the kitchen and intercepting John’s attempt to put their visit to a close, “Sandwiches too, you’ll love them. Pro tip – you can trick Sherlock into eating his veg. Apparently, if you take a bagel and cream-cheese, he will eat the entire thing and not care about whatever else is in it. Look. Raisins and grated carrots. Who knew?”
Unable to hold back a grin, John bites his lower lip in mock thought but mostly to hide how much he loves when Sherlock looks at him like that, like they are in on a secret together. With a playful half-shrug, John says, “Why don’t I wait to find out about it? It’s not like I know what case you’re on about anyway.”
Well, that explains the past few days. The poor sod doesn't want to go to sleep for fear of what his mind will bring him in the dark depths of night. With crossed arms and a soft shuffle, I position myself out of arm's reach by the couch.
fingerprints as a third
Offended, Sherlock shoots him a glare over his shoulder. “Why would I do that? Who cares if there’s dirt on the stairs?”
John turns to look up at the ceiling. A sticky hand hangs overhead, shot up there like a rubber band by Sherlock during one of his ‘quarantine experiments.’ Hands tight against the arm of his chair, John wonders what happened to
John’s head shoots up from his position over Rosie to look at me with confusion. “Well, I think so she has a better understanding of who you are and of our relationship.” As Rosie tugs on his ear to regain his attention, he grimaces before letting his face relax, a tinge of disappointment sitting behind his eyes. “Honestly Sherlock, if you’re uncomfortable you don’t have to come.”
Without taking a chance to think, John says, the frustration slipping through his tone, “Finally, won the
His phone vibrates, an alarm labelled,
Staring out the window, John frowns as it begins to rain.
“What was it about?” His voice sounds rough with lack of use.
True to form, John’s adrenaline junkie personality has him chasing dopamine and serotonin and rushing, perfect, synaptic bliss. Since they don’t have a case, he finds his fix in Sherlock, who has no complaints. John fucks him over the counter, in the shower, on the rug, in the upstairs bedroom that is now seldom used. By the end of the week, Sherlock is a puddle of a man, draped over the sofa with loose limbs and a permanent glow over his face. He barely reacts when his phone goes off, shoving it under the couch as John rolls him over for another go.
Mycroft sniffs and replies, “Agreed.”
Sighing his relief, John closes his eyes briefly before opening them and nodding. “Good. Thank you.”
“Why are we in here?”
is this?” he demands, waving at the mess, but John is still recovering from his fumble, his face red and hot.

By the time Rosie is down again for the evening, I have completely forgotten about the conversation with Sherlock, yet again. Children seem to do that. He has remained on the couch throughout the whole evening, not moving, not responding. Settling into my chair to read for a short while, I know I should head to bed soon, especially since the crick in my neck hasn't let up. But the story absorbs me, and I startle when Sherlock speaks again.
He was still staring at the back of John’s head when he heard a voice he had been hoping to avoid.
“Yes. Thank you.” John leaves with a tired shuffle and starts his tea ritual. Solid, dependable John. I grab my dressing gown and follow him into the kitchen, my body aching from the memories and the tension binding my muscles, my scars.
Sherlock’s eyelashes flutter, and he groans,
Smiling back, I swing my head toward our bedroom and ask, “Sleep? You are going to have to pick up Rosie from Greg and Molly’s pretty early tomorrow morning.”
The words rush out of me, leaving me breathless and flayed. The air between us is wrought with the images of my nightmares, hovering, thick and sticky with blood and sweat. I can feel Sherlock's eyes on me, waiting for me to continue. Patient. Kind. With a deep breath that blows the scenes out from between us, I'm able to start again. “Having to re-live my worst days, well, I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.” With the corner of my mouth beginning to curl up and a one-armed shrug, I add, “Well, except for maybe Mycroft.”
My curls are wild, sticking up every which way. Rolling my eyes, I try to pat them down into something less crazy looking, but to no avail. With a few deep breaths to calm my nerves, I turn to the frosted door leading into my bedroom. My hand on the knob, I breathe in once more, steeling myself for what could, would be a long night. There is a minuscule chance of me sleeping. Too much new information to process. Sharing a bed. John next to me. Attending therapy. Mary. What on earth did he mean by all that?
With a final huff, Sherlock stomps off toward the bathroom, John managing to smack his arse before he is out of reach. Sherlock freezes, his eyes nearly popping from their sockets. His mind whirls with the ramifications of embarking on a relationship with an arse-smacking John Watson. After a moment of reflection, Sherlock realizes he is not against it. Not
When John comes home for his appointment, it’s clear something weighs on his mind. Babbling in her highchair, Rosie mushes her peas onto the tray, against her palm, and—thankfully—some into her mouth. After both of us glance at her, inexplicable smiles on our faces, we find one another's gazes again. John’s smile falters, and my brow knits together, trying to determine the cause. With a cough, John breaks eye contact and hangs his coat over the back of his chair. But my stare stays trained on him, unable to suss out the problem.
Sherlock drops his gaze once more. “Yes.”
John was still talking to the detective—John’s hand clapped to his shoulder, eyes crinkled from an open-mouthed laugh. That familiar ache spread through Sherlock’s chest. Could Mycroft be right?
John’s face falls.
A swell of love washes over me as I look up at him. I cup his jaw with my hands and pull him in for a final lingering kiss to the forehead.
Hanging up the phone, Sherlock drops his forehead against his knees, curled up in his chair. He remains there for a spell until he finally feels able to rise. He crosses the sitting room and into the kitchen, digging under the sink for a garbage bag. In his bedroom, Sherlock angrily snatches up the scattered rose petals, shoving them into the sack. His lips purse into a tense line, and he blinks rapidly to keep his eyes from stinging. Teeth bared, he pushes the emotion away, dismissing it as allergies to the flowers, and tosses the bag and a handful of crushed roses into the bin.
seven times last night. Yes, something bloody well happened at St. Bart’s.
Shifting my weight on the table, I place my cup to the side and lean forward on my knees. “No, he hasn’t." My brow knits together, and I put on my sternest look. “And I wouldn’t have let him if he tried. That’s your story to tell. No one else’s.”
John squints, a smirk playing at the edges of his lips. Rolling his eyes, he says, “Duh, I’m bisexual, genius.”
I push back against his arms, and they loosen around me but don’t pull away. Shrouded as his face is in the dark, I do my best to search out his gaze. “Don’t want it to change things or concerned it will change poorly?"
“Nope.” John grits his teeth, scowling as he hauls Sherlock away. “I should have known letting you leave the house was a risk. Too many chances for exposure with you around other people.”
Looking at him, John has to swallow twice around his tight throat.
“You exploded my hand!” he shouts, flustered. Sherlock leaps to his feet, rigid and activated, his arms flying over his head to express his frustration.
John appears in the sitting room doorway, and the welcoming smile falls from Sherlock’s lips at the tense expression on John’s face.
“I am intrigued to determine if we have any that overlap.” His voice betrays his benign inquiry. There is more than that, but I play along.
The words hit John.
for one another?”
Sherlock studies my face and gives one short nod. "I've... noticed a change. But that still didn't answer my questions."
It sounds so easy when he puts it like that. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep him from finding the truth about my feelings, even so, he is right. It is better for Rosie. And it does sound nice, perhaps... before I can finish my thought, the words are rolling off my tongue in a teasing whisper. “Ok, but I'm not kicking you out of your own bed. I was in the army for godssake. I can share a bed. But, can you?”
She inclines her head to John and lets him respond.
“Yes.” A stoic reply. Sherlock is no longer looking through the lens of the microscope but meets my gaze instead. A storm appears to brew behind his gaze, one of confusion, doubt, and of pain.
Mrs. Hudson shoots John a look. Keeping his expression neutral, John lifts his newspaper higher to hide his smirk.
After cleaning up, I return to my chair. It’s a safe place to rest, listening to Sherlock play and knowing he is alive and back in Baker Street. Better than in my room without this, without him, without Rosie. His music wraps around me. Like a warm, weighty blanket, it pulls me into rocking streams, warm arms, small smiles, and dark curls. I don’t fall into a deep sleep as I listen to him play through the hours, standing vigil over me, but I do rest more completely than I have in weeks. Lulled by the security, I mutter, “This is what I missed the most while you were gone.”
John’s mouth fills with questions, but something in Sherlock’s expression makes him swallow them back. “Okay,” he says roughly, folding his hands in his lap. “Alright, Sherlock.”
like a tap, John,” he snaps, irritated. “It’s clear you haven’t been to the store in a while, going by the state of your shoes, hair and—”
that Sherlock squints at.
His eyes wide and wondering, John cups Sherlock’s face in his palm, thumb smoothing over the ridge of a sharp cheekbone with something bordering on reverence. “I’ve wanted to do that for ages,” he admits, pressure lifting off his chest as the words drift between them, carried on their shared breath.
Without thinking, my feet lead me to the kitchen. Kettle, two mugs, two bags, milk for me, sugar for him, steep the bags, stir the tea. I smile down at my own hands holding the mugs, happy for it to be two again. It took me so long to unlearn that habit, and it came again so easily when I moved back to Baker Street. It was almost like my body knew what my mind did not. I belong here. With him.
“Oh my god, close the window before you say stuff like that out loud! People will hear you!”
When he shoots a glance over his shoulder, he finds John licking his lips, one pale eyebrow raised. Sherlock’s knees buckle, and he stumbles into the wall as all the blood in his body rushes southward.
“Do you want to know? Or would you like to wait until I lay it all out for Lestrade while ripping Anderson a new one?” Sherlock asks with a glint of pure mischief in his eye.
“No, stay. As I already said..." I pinch the bridge of my nose in mild irritation, "and you know how I hate repeating myself, I don’t know how to do this." Throwing my hands in the air to imply the whole situation, I clarify. "I don’t know the expectations of routine or of sleeping arrangements or of clothing choices. I just don’t know. I’ve never done this before, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want you here.”
John sits up, looking at Sherlock still lying on his side, arm cushioned under his head. He looks radiant. Sherlock sends a knowing smile in his direction before asking, “Thai?”
Sherlock takes a step, closing the distance between us. “You don’t sleep well alone.”
Silence encases us, and the bed shifts. In one swift movement, I am wrapped in strong arms, a forceful grip. The crushing weight reminds me that I am not alone, that Moriarty hasn't won. As my face presses against John’s chest, he rubs a hand up and down my back, my body shaking as the fear washes through me. This hasn’t happened since Baskerville.
The sounds coming from his violin, sharp and piercing, are in direct contrast to the sound of his deep, calm voice. I trust the violin more. Then, the sounds slow down, become legato, change to a minor key—turn morose. “In every version, I don’t make it in time. I lose. I lose everything that is important to me.” He glances over at me as if checking to see if I fault him for failing, for being human. A mournful cord cries out from beneath his fingertips, and a pressure surrounds my heart, overwhelming my chest, my breath caught with it, waiting for the tension to release. It's all too much. The trust, the glance, the swirling emotions in his eyes and through the air, the mere implication of my importance to him.
Stuffing the pillow under his head, John shifts in his chair and closes his eyes. The lingering scent of Sherlock is far more soothing than he cares to admit.
“What are—” something adhesive strikes his face and falls off to the floor. Sherlock picks it up and squints at a squishy toy shaped like a hand on a string. He raises confused eyes to John in time to narrowly avoid the second toss, which strikes the wall behind him and hangs there before skidding down to the floor. “John, what the—”
My breath hitches around this next confession. "But I wanted, want, that whole life, my whole life with you, and when I couldn’t have all of it, I ran. Then, Mary was gone, and I was angry and vicious and wanted to hurt you just as much as I decided you had hurt me."
For how chaste the kiss had stayed, it left me breathing heavy, too. “Yeah. Yeah, I know. Scratching the back of his head with blunt nails, I ask, “Alright?”
he kills himself on that floor.” In a low mutter, she adds to herself, “I may have gone a little overboard, by the sound of things.”
“It was just a nightmare, love. We wouldn’t ever do that to you. We will always, always try to listen to what you have to say. We won’t leave you, sweetheart.” He punctuates each sentence with a kiss to the top of her head. Sherlock catches on and draws up to hold both her and John. Rosie cocooned between them, they surround her with love and comfort.
happened. You kept her, and yourself, from me for months. I have no misgivings about your tenacity—it’s usually something incredibly admirable in your character—but if you so choose, you could easily do it again.” No emotion colors his voice. It’s as if he were explaining how the postal system works to someone who had never seen a stamp before. Flat and to the point.
A thought pops into my head, remembering our earlier conversation. “Only if you talk while you play.” He considers this, rises, and preps his violin.
At Rosie's name, light dances in Sherlock's eyes before he nods and pushes himself to stand, catching my hands with his own to pull me up along with him.
have the Coronavirus, then sticking me in a flat contaminated by damp is hardly beneficial for my respiratory health.”
The mirth drains from his eyes, his face. Lowering his mug, his eyes following it, Sherlock asks, “What if your worst days are your fault, and only yours? Would you deserve it then?”
Trying to comfort Sherlock Holmes with an extendable feather duster goes about as well as expected. Which is to say, it goes poorly.
He hears a sharp inhale and looks up to find Sherlock staring at him with surprise. John licks his lips, and Sherlock’s eyes drop to track the motion. John feels his face grow warm.
Looking down at me, somehow even closer than before, Sherlock quietly but sternly says, “John, sleep in my bed. I can wake you if you have any more dreams. Or you, I. Nothing more than that. It will prevent you from waking up Rosie like you have been throughout the past month. You know as well as I that's why she's been so cranky lately. Let her sleep.” As he presses his lips into a thin line, he sighs. "And if your fragile masculinity can't see to it to share my bed, I am more than willing to take the couch. It would still be better than waking Rosie, and your neck can't take another night on the furniture."
Sherlock stops me with a hand on my sleeve. “Thank you,” and his hand falls away.
My whole body stiffens. And then so does John’s.
Casting his eyes away to the falling dark outside, Sherlock begins, “As you know, I used my 7% solution to help control the data input to my mind, to help me think better. You have seen me in its control, however loathe I am to admit it."
, I correct myself, knowing full well I’ve fucked it all up. I put the plates onto the table, sliding them into place, my arms too heavy to do much else. Plopping into a chair, I decide how to make this up to him, if I can make this up to him. With how much I have hurt him, physically and emotionally over the years, he deserves so much better, deserves... not me. My stomach roiling, I push a piece of broccoli around my plate with a fork, staring at the patterns it makes in the sauce.
“Sherlock. Hey, it’s me. It’s John. Wake up.”
been needing him to need it. But he never has taken care of his “transport” well. And, honestly, he doesn’t really need as much sleep as the average human anyway. But I've been watching him these past few days, and the deep-set marks around his eyes, his lack of vibrating vivaciousness, and those biting marks that cut me to my core all point to a sore need for sleep. Hearing those shuffles, I know, I just
“John? Is...is everything alright? Is something wrong with Rosie?”
Searching his face, his posture, I tread with caution. “And you? Are you amenable?”
“But, I—” John begins, protesting weakly, only for Sherlock to speak over him. He unleashes a series of mean, biting deductions that leave John bristling. Unable to storm off, John sulks in his zone, his expression dark.
There is hunger in Sherlock’s face, darkening his eyes. John sucks in a startled inhale at the sight and opens his mouth to speak.
Love. Acceptance. Joy. Pain. Confusion. Hurt. Anger. Loss. What did all that amount to?
A calculating glare roams over my face. “John. It already
John whispers, “You know, this is your fault for teaching her to be so observant in the first place.” Rolling his eyes, John gazes down to Rosie and explains, “Rosie, your family is who you make it to be. Mrs. Hudson is a part of our family even though she isn’t related to us. Same with Uncle Greg and Auntie Molly. We have created our own family. So no, last names are not the only way to tell a family. Does that make sense?”
“It was a glove, filled with sand and water, which you threw at me!” His voice lowers as he prods at the glove shrapnel. “It’s not
, that isn’t going to happen, right? I wrote that out of anger, out of hurt. I swear... I
Speaking into the darkness, honoring the quietness of the night, the honesty it allows, I say, “No. Don’t leave. I am uncomfortable, but not because of you. Its... I just don’t want to dream when all it gives me are nightmares.”
Sherlock's eyes flash bright and cold before softening around the edges. "I can’t stand being indebted to them, but I am grateful they did.”
I need to feel that he is alive.
I turn to face away from him. I want to help, god, how I want to help, but I can’t without showing too much. He’d know. And I can’t let that happen. Then
“I do,” John retorts. A sly smirk creeps over his face, and he tilts forward to drag his lips over Sherlock’s ear, whispering, “If you do it, I’ll lick your arsehole.” Leaving the broom in Sherlock’s stunned grasp, John turns and strides back into the flat to the sound of Sherlock tumbling down the stairs, the broom clanking after him.
“Yes,” John insists, pushing him gently away. Sherlock’s bottom lip drops into a powerful pout.
, you did
lose everything.
I take a moment to process his confession. It sinks through my skin and permeates my bloodstream, making its way to and through the blockade that had formed around my heart. I was his reason for returning. I had been with him the whole time he was away. When the wall finally falls, I am left raw and vulnerable.
He steps through the door and pauses, looking up to find Sherlock standing at the other end of the room. John frowns and turns to question Mrs. Hudson, but the door closes in his face, and John’s words die in his throat. He hears the click of the lock, and his eyes widen.
So I stomp downstairs to tell him off, still being cautious enough of my sleeping Rosie. If he doesn't go to sleep on his own, I’ll drug his tea with some sleeping aids.
“I’m sure you are. I also wanted to thank you for all the help and support you’ve given him. John’s made great strides over his time here with all the work he has put into this. He tells me you’ve particularly given him a lot of help with his nightmares.” A squeeze to my hand punctuates her words with his agreement.
After the feather duster’s failure, Mrs. Hudson brings John a glove filled with water and sand. John accepts the offering with blatant confusion, and she pats him on the shoulder.
With a quick look at John, a grin twitches at the corner of my mouth, and he grins back, reaching for my hand, intertwining our fingers and resting it on his thigh.
So it was a he then. Questions rolled around John’s head, reverberating off his skull.
Finally, they were sitting in the cab on the way back to Baker Street. Exhaustion won out, and after a whispered thank you, Sherlock’s body drooped into a loose-limbed puddle in his seat. John smiled as he took in the form next to him, gentle and calm in a way Sherlock only was when sleep took him. This was his second favorite Sherlock, just after rapid-fire-deduction Sherlock.
“Yeah?” I ask as Sherlock turns to look up at me through his dark lashes.
“Jesus, Sherlock, please tell me you weren't still healing when you came to the restaurant.” When I refuse to answer, pressing my lips into a thin line, John runs a hand over his face, pulling along his jaw, before moving back to pinch the bridge of his nose. “How..." his voice attempts to break, "how badly did I hurt you that night?”
“Good.”
“It’s not mine to tell,” John responds in a quick, gruff manner.
When the pandemic begins, John predicts (correctly) that Sherlock will struggle. To absolutely no one’s surprise, Sherlock continues much as he always has, leaning over corpses and standing in people’s personal space, no matter how many times John snaps at him to keep his distance.
When John first suggests the measurement terms, Sherlock scoffs. Once John explains it will earn Sherlock something called ‘brownie points,’ which can garner sexual favour, Sherlock caves.
“I see congratulations are in order then. I was wondering when the looks would finally become reality. But a word of advice, brother mine, whatever it is that you two are hiding from each other, don’t.”
“Yeah, well, it might keep me from strangling you to death,” John shoots back, tossing pillows and blankets at Sherlock from a distance. “I think that would be much more detrimental to both of us.”
Well-educated, a focus with veterans with PTSD, living comfortably but within her means, trying to hide her smoking habit from her husband. Oh. And her mother.
“I blamed you, Sherlock. I beat you. Kicked you while you were down. Literally. And you thought you deserved it.” John's voice cracks as he repeats the last phrase. "You thought you deserved all of it." He inches around to face me and searches my eyes, the tears clinging to the rim of his lower eyelids, threatening to pour in rivers down his cheeks.
The days pass in fraught silence. When Sherlock was in quarantine, John would still sit in the same room as him, taking off the edge of isolation. During John’s, Sherlock is not quite so accommodating. In fact, John would say he is downright rude, if not avoidant. There are no more late-night tea times with violin solos. No attempts at contact with feather dusters or sticky hands.
Walking back inside, Sherlock scrubs at his face, straightens his shoulders and sets about rearranging the tape in the sitting room to accommodate John’s habitual spaces. He’s thankful John has yet to ask for the body pillow and his jumper back. He’ll be needing it tonight.
. I lost you, and somehow you came back a second time.” With a deep breath to steady myself, I continue. “I dream about that night at Magnussen’s office. Getting upstairs and not being sure if you were going to make it. In my dreams, you never do.”
“Do you want me to leave? Again, it’s fine. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable in your own space.” How does he do that, put me all aflutter and at complete ease at the same time? I am
I catch up to him just as a cab pulls to the curb. Sherlock slides into the back, crossing his arms with a sour expression on his face. Keeping my distance, I crawl into the cab before giving the cabbie the name of the restaurant. That perks Sherlock up a bit.
turned toward the center I still long to occupy.
“If it’s not drugs, then what is it?” the voice says in his ear. Greg swallows, sounding strained when he replies.
to keep my mouth occupied so I wouldn’t kiss you.” A blush works its way over his features as he grumbles, “It’s not
“Ah. Sherlock. I was hoping that was you. Wasn’t sure if you would come after last year.”
Sitting at the kitchen table two weeks after embarking on their new intimate relationship, Sherlock chews on the end of a pen and squints at his chart. He details the results of the week to John out loud.
“It’ll feel more like a real hand,” she explains while explaining absolutely nothing, and once more leaving John to fumble his way toward answers.
I turn towards him, his brow wrinkled and a frown pulling down the corners of his mouth. After clenching and unclenching my fist a few times to release some of the tension in them, I trust myself only enough to speak through gritted teeth. “Sherlock, I watched you fall at
Slamming the window shut, Sherlock tosses the dustbin on the desk and strides across the sitting room, his hands sliding over John’s front, fingers lacing behind his neck. “Don’t care about them,” he announces, leaning forward to drag his lips along the edge of John’s jaw. “Okay, I’m finished. Arse licking now, please.”
I need to make him talk about this with me even if he doesn’t think he wants or needs to. But Sherlock needs to talk to somebody,
“Why?” Sherlock demands. With a shake of my head, I walk upstairs, taking care not to wake Rosie. “John.” The quietness of his voice halts my steps. “I’m sorry, too.” I nod, knowing I can’t assuage his fears though that is all I want to do, and continue walking away. The music stops.
He tips his head down with a furrowed brow, avoiding my gaze. “For dying to save me when she should still be around for you, for Rosie. You think she made the wrong choice. I shouldn't be surprised.”
He stops, and John looks up at him. His mouth is dry, and his tongue darts out to wet his lips again, Sherlock’s eyes falling to the movement once more. One of his hands rises, curling along the curve of John’s jawline.
“Oi!” John calls after the blur heading through the door. He rushes out after him, snatching Sherlock’s sleeve just inside the hall. “You can’t just leave the slides there, you git. You have to clean it up!”
I pull out the paper inside and unfold it, the creases starting to tear with use. Familiar handwriting glares up from the page, but in different inks. Both mine and his.
As John works, he asks, hoping to find out more without scaring Sherlock into silence, “You said Serbia. Was that where this happened?”
He stops a whisper away, and I feel more than hear his question. “Can... may I kiss you?”
“Let me at least see how bad it is. Maybe I can help,” John says, already moving to grab the first-aid kit in the hall cupboard.
“Do you now?” I say when the words come to me.
I nuzzle deeper into him, inhaling the smell of his laundry detergent and sweat. It calms me and bolsters me in equal amounts. I whisper, “Alright.”
Sorry for the delay, y'all! My original Part 6 was only 550 words and worked so much better blended with Part 7 as an epilogue, so. I had to write y'all a whole new piece! It took a bit. But it also means, CHECK THE TAGS. I've updated them.
"Sherlock. As to the last question, I've already told you. I never should have. Period. As for the rest? The simple answer is that I am a bonafide arse. There is no way around it." Sherlock opens his mouth to respond, but I put up a hand to stop him. I need to get this out. He needs to understand.
“Always did have a sweet tooth,” the man called behind them as they walked away. The tension spiked through John’s shoulders. That arsehole, whoever he was, must be the reason John was here pretending in the first place.
“Afghanistan, St. Bart’s. Are there others?” Impatience seeps through his question.
Sherlock’s reply is a soft, sleepy hum, and he wraps his arms tightly around John’s torso until his breathing dies off into a snore. Eyes closing, John presses his lips to Sherlock’s collarbone and drifts.
“Yes, well. I suppose that's true. They are hard and too real and inevitably put me in a sour mood." I can feel my brow furrow and the bite of the teacup in my palm. "It’s hard. It's hard watching your friends—the people you love—die over and over again while you try to do everything you can to save them from bleeding out underneath your hands, and...and you just can’t.”
Sherlock? To
With a half chuckle, I say, "Yeah. And I am going to keep going. I don't want to hurt you. Ever again. So... I'll keep working through it. I've already learned a lot. Double sessions at the beginning. We’re now at just the once a week."
Without even opening his eyes to confirm his suspicions, John interrupts my train of thought. “You know, the whole point of this exercise was to sleep. Stop staring at me and turn off the light.”
The ticking of the clock reverberates through the room, echoing through my head, taking my mind and sanity with it.
Finally, I follow, still trying to catch my breath, shuffling after him, thankful I hadn’t woken Rosie. By the time I get to the kitchen, Sherlock has a glass of water ready for me. While I drink it down, he says, “I heard you from down here. I hadn’t gone to bed yet, but Rosie must have been in a deep sleep for her to not wake up.” He pauses, taking in my stance, my breath, my face. “You were calling for Mary.”
Shaking his head at the utterly brilliant dolt in front of him, John pulls out his phone to double-check the time. “Just gone seven. I got back a few hours ago, dropped off my stuff at Baker street, took a kip, and headed over here when you weren’t answering your phone.”
Confused at the subject change, John glances at his watch. “Fifteen minutes. Give or take.”
“You said he threatened Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, too.”
After a quick cab ride where Sherlock furiously researches who knows what on his phone, they arrive at their destination and head to Lestrade’s office, Sherlock moving with the grace and force of a billowing storm cloud. Sherlock rips open the office door, and John trails in behind him. Fortunately, or unfortunately for the man in question, Anderson is in attendance. John realizes Sherlock must have texted the DI for his impromptu meeting to be so well met.
Sherlock flinches at the mention of his sister but doesn't interrupt.
stay in your zone—No, Sherlock, no! Stay in your zone!” The forlorn look on Sherlock’s face cuts into John’s resolve as he tries to stay strong. “No, I don’t care if you want a hug… okay, fine, I do. Dammit, stay there, I’ll…” Defeated, John’s shoulders slump as he turns toward the third floor. “I’ll get the feather duster.”
That’s how badly, John. I am still hurting from that night. “I pulled a few stitches, and re-cracked a couple of ribs. Nothing major.” John’s face falls, and he curls deeper into himself. His breathing hitches, and the fingers pinching the bridge of his nose press harder to hold back the tears that threaten to fall.
Sherlock has the decency to look sheepish. “I needed
John spends the night and half of the next day in his room. When he finally emerges, it is to trot directly downstairs to the bins. He stands over them and looks at the flowers in his hands, the sentiment-filled card attached to the stems.
“Nice catching up, Victor. As always. But I do believe there are some canapés much more interesting than this conversation.” With that, he turned around and felt John’s hand slip into his own, threading their fingers together. A small squeeze of reassurance connected directly to his heart, and even as he couldn’t breathe, he felt like he could fly. Glancing at John, he squeezed back, thanking him for being there, wishing, hoping, aching that this could be real instead.
As his eyes flit back and forth between mine, John tries to ascertain my true meaning. He doesn’t seem to find it, but my brave John still responds, “Just as you keep saying that you can’t lose me, I am lost without you. I’ve tried it twice now, and I can’t do it. So yes, I am worried I am going to ruin everything and still lose you.” While he talks, a small smirk spreads across my face and into my eyes.
Sherlock glared at his brother then, hoping to end the conversation with a stare.
Sherlock can hear the downturn of Angelo’s mouth through the phone, and he clenches his teeth.
“No, not what as in I didn’t hear you, what as in what did you mean by that?”
—that you never deserve to be attacked like that. No matter if you had done something or not. But I don’t blame you for her death, for leaving, for any of it, and I never should have. I took it out on you, and that was absolutely wrong. I’m sorry. I am so sorry. I'm a monster, Sherlock. I'm such a monster.” Those last sentences come out in whispers.
I can tell he doesn’t understand because his hand drops away and it takes a moment for him to respond. “Why would you have nightmares about St. Bart’s? You’re a doctor. You see hospitals and patients all the time. You work with me. You were a soldier, so it can’t be the morgue." Sherlock pauses in consideration, and I can hear the rapid-fire whirl of his brain. "Or can it? Did something happen that I don’t know about?”
“Sherlock, it’s fine. If you want to take it back, it’s fine. It’s all fine.” I turn to look at John then, his eyes full of calm, concern, trust. I still don’t know how that happened, how I gained back any of his trust.
“What’s the purpose of my attending?”
Shaking his head, John moves to shove them in the trash and pauses, brow furrowed. He looks down at a half-open bag of petals and wilted roses. He blinks, wets his dry lips, and carefully sets his flowers on top before closing the lid.
After a moment to consider my response, I ask, “Do you remember when I told you that I had asked you for one more miracle?” He nods once and continues playing, knowing that the music will keep us both calm. “Well, I got it. Twice. And I wouldn’t take it back or exchange it for anything. Ever." Sherlock's gaze finds mine, swirling with hope and fear. The sight swells my heart, and the corner of my mouth turns up as I walk closer to him, still out of reach, knowing that right now touch would reveal more than I want. "So yes, I do think I already have. A long time ago. But that doesn’t mean it still doesn’t hurt sometimes.” He scans my face before inhaling sharply through his nose.
Standing in the doorway of 221C, he looks dubiously at the sloshy glove and back to Sherlock. The detective perches on top of his pile of blankets like a reluctant king. His curls stick up in a sweaty mess, and his once-pristine suit looks rumpled.
John waves a hand, unconcerned. “I’m sure he’s fine.” When Mrs. Hudson continues to stare at him, he looks up from his newspaper with a bemused expression. “What?”
“So do I,” I reply, matching his tone, neither of us comfortable with the conversation but knowing it needs said. “The Pool, Baskerville, Bonfire Night. To name a few.”
a love-sick school girl in some ridiculous novel.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “With the case being a four but dragging on so long, I knew I had to review the forensic work since you decided to put this pathetic excuse for a technician on the scene."
John leans down and presses a kiss to Rosie’s head. He hasn't stopped smiling since Sherlock responded. Gazing at Sherlock, John responds to the both of them, “Yes, I do think it does, love.”
He lets me.
“John,” Sherlock whispered again as he leaned forward, hot breath puffing across John’s face. “Please.” John felt the word spoken against his lips, barely there, ghosting its presence against his mouth.
John's grounding presence pulls me closer, promising protection, safety. In the same monotone, I explain, “It was when I was away. Dismantling the web. I was caught in Serbia and held. Mycroft got me out, barely. I still have the scars.” I don’t need to mention that they are not only physical. John knows, understands. Afghanistan.
ringing through the bare room. The air whooshes out of his lungs, and John rises to his feet without knowing why. It seems imperative that he stand. His wordless action pays off when Sherlock crosses the room, his long, confident stride closing the distance quickly.
With a shake of my head to clear out the reverie, I move to stand in front of him and hand over the tea. Sherlock places his bow and violin in one hand and takes the tea with the other, fingers brushing against mine. With a nod of gratitude, he raises his mug in cheers and takes a sip before folding himself into his chair as I fall into mine.
When John returns later that evening, he finds Sherlock pouting in the corner of the room, arms folded over his chest. “Alright, this isn’t working. You can come back to 221B. But!” John holds up a hand, stalling Sherlock’s words. “
don’t have the stomach to hear anything more,” Greg mutters to himself, hitting a number on speed dial. The line rings out, and he clears his throat before saying, “Well, Mycroft, it’s not drugs.”
“I didn’t ask for this!” Sherlock shouts after him, voice rising as the door slams shut behind John.
“The doctors decided to inform my brother about my condition after I had gone those several weeks without talking and little to no food. He came to visit me then, finally seeing me for what I had become. The thinning hair, translucent skin stretched taught over my too-thin frame, and—as he told me later was the scariest thing for him—my dull, disengaged eyes.”
“Shut the fuck up, Sherlock.”
with our floor!?” he demands, feet skidding on the hardwood.
you. You
“Well, perhaps. But it is likely in his list of worst days as well.” As I wait again for him to continue, I do my best to project a sense of calm, trust, understanding, knowing he would tell me if, or when, he was ready.
A few days before the end of John’s quarantine, the mood in 221B is still sour. The very air in the flat buzzes with anger and hurt feelings, and both John and Sherlock avoid each other whenever possible. The only concrete interaction between them occurs when Sherlock hurls John’s long pillow at him from the hallway. John clutches it in confused hurt until he looks down and realizes one of Sherlock’s ridiculously tight dress shirts is buttoned closed around it.
“I don’t know,” he mutters, looking away with a creased brow. “Maybe.” He catches Mrs. Hudson’s grin from the corner of his eyes.
Sherlock must already be awake then. A glance at the clock confirms my hopes. It's only seven, and Mrs. Hudson won’t expect me before eight. I can take the time to wake up properly. A smirk twitches at the corner of my mouth.
The look Sherlock shoots my direction screams, “Really, John?” and he begins to type his response.
“Come to dust me again?” he asks sourly, shooting John a glower from under his lashes. Despite his attitude, the expression is rather endearing, and John finds himself tossing the hand at Sherlock without thinking.
know it was a koala fingerprint and not human? If I remember correctly, they are actually quite easy to mistake.”
However, nothing tops John’s reaction when Sherlock strips off his gloves at a crime scene and hooks his finger into a dead man’s mouth.
Tip-toeing around, I get ready for the night and crawl into bed. As I lay down, I listen to my daughter’s soft, steady breathing. It soothes my aching heart enough to drift me off to sleep even though the nightmares will await me.
I raise an eyebrow. “You know I hate repeating myself.”
She settles into the armchair on one side of the coffee table and indicates for us to sit on the chairs or couch opposite. John turns a questioning gaze to me, letting me decide on our seats. Unsure how much or how little closeness is expected in an environment like this, I choose the couch, allowing John to fill in the gaps on this particular social nicety. He sits next to me with a small space between us but close enough for our knees to press together. As he relaxes into the back cushion, he crosses an ankle over his knee.
“Well, those would be quite the harrowing experiences. Thank you for sharing that with me. It is understandable you would want to process through them, and you’re naturally using your dreams to do that.”
John winces before hiding the duster behind himself and rubbing the back of his neck with his empty hand. “I… uh… Mrs. Hudson said…” his voice trails off, and he sighs, helplessly finishing, “Just pretend it’s my hand.” With a raise of his eyebrows, he brings the duster forward and wiggles it about in a fashion he hopes appears enticing. Judging by Sherlock’s stare, he fails. “Okay?”
“Don’t you miss him, John?” There is a slight plea in her voice, and John narrows his eyes.
Catching Sherlock’s hands, he turns him toward the hallway, ordering, “Teeth.
“Yeah, okay…” Sliding into his cruiser, he grips his nose, takes a deep breath, and says, “He’s getting his arse licked, apparently.” A heavy silence meets his words. “By John,” Greg adds, in case he wasn’t clear. More silence, and he frowns. “Mycroft? Did the call drop?”
“And if I told you that there was no reason for you to be concerned?” That adorable furrow appears between his brows.
Considering the request, I realize I only have Janine as a frame of reference. “I wouldn’t know. I don’t have much to go on.”
,” John huffs, turning on his heel. “Feather duster it is, then, you fucking sod.”
Huffing a laugh, John replies, “Sherlock keeps slipping on the hallway floor. Seems he’s forgotten how to use his legs properly.”
His sharp gaze scrutinizes me before landing on my face and softening. “What do you want to know?” Sherlock asks before taking another sip.
“Ahh. So you're the one I’ve heard so much about, Mr. Holmes. Pleasure to meet you.” Nancy smiles at us both as she offers a hand to me, and I return the gesture in brisk nature. After shooting a withering glance at John, skin itching with the discomfort of the situation, I take a moment to appraise Dr. Nancy Shao and the surroundings.
“John,” Sherlock starts again, hands twitching against each other.
“My therapist would like to meet you, if you’re amenable. She says you can come to the beginning of the next meeting.”
Startled from my reverie, I reach behind and turn off the lamp. It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust, and all I can hear is John’s steady breathing and my own heart pounding. “Sherlock, if this is stressing you out or if you can’t sleep, I promise I won’t be upset if you ask me to leave. I honestly don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
“Mrs. Hudson’s
“Thank you,” John says, “for everything. For saving us, for protecting us.” I watch as he turns and leaves the room to head to bed, his limp making a brief appearance. Concern for him blossoms across my chest, filling me with an ache I don't know how to handle. Tonight will be a bad night for him. But tonight will be the first night of true sleep I have had in years. If I’m being honest, since I jumped from the roof of St. Bart’s. This is the first time things have felt even close to right again since I left, and I can only hope that it continues. John long out of sight, I turn back to my room, comfortable and hopeful, ready to see where this new connection will lead us.
Blinking the sleepiness away, John straightens with a yawn. “Not sure. Mrs. Hudson seems to think we have something to talk about.”
“Please.”
Sherlock looks away, scowling at the cold, empty fireplace. “Preposterous,” he mutters. John forces a weak smile.
“I don’t know how to do this,” I say, returning that trust he so blatantly puts before me. He takes a half step back, that damn wrinkle beginning to make an appearance.
In a firm and slow voice, he replies, “No, you haven’t. I’ve been able to deduce the nights you do have them, even when you aren’t here at Baker Street. You always have a slight limp, a dark look, and you try to smile more, but it is never a true one on those days.”
John's face softens, the confusion melting from his features. With the hint of a smile and a straightening of his spine, he takes another half step back, this time not to distance himself but to establish even ground.
Curls bobbing as he nods, Sherlock takes a moment to collect himself, folded hands fidgeting against one another. Raising his head, he stares past me, into the tiles of the counter beyond.
Smug and chuckling, John coos, “Aw, you’re just head over heels for me, aren’t you?” Sherlock shoots him a glare, his long legs reminding John of a baby deer taking its first steps.
With a withering glare, Sherlock stares back at John before stomping back into the lab, perfunctorily wiping down the equipment, and storing the slides back into the evidence slide holder. As he does, John ventures a hesitant question.
“I won’t be. Rosie’s there,” I breathe, the space between us calling for the quiet, my feet taking root into the floor, unable to flee even if I wanted to.
Tearing my gaze away from him, I turn back to Nancy and clear my throat. “Thank you. I am as well.”
My eyebrows rise up. Feeling the question, Sherlock turns back to answer it, the soft look on his face catching me off guard.
While they were collecting macaroons and bits with chocolate on and a scone with lemon curd, Mycroft sidled up to them, Lestrade drawing John’s attention away. Rolling his eyes, Sherlock continued choosing sweets for the small plate he held in an attempt to ignore his brother.
Annoyance gone, I search his face, hoping to find the words, to tap into his bravery. And then, “You won’t lose me, John. That is, if you’ll have me.” I hear his breath catch and am enveloped once again. “John?”
Seeing that John isn’t moving in for more, Lestrade rubs a hand over his face, and Sherlock smirks, eyes only for John. When Lestrade shoots a questioning glance to Anderson, he just responds with a shake of his head, rubbing his reddened jaw. With another sigh and a dark look, Lestrade turns to John and says, “That’s never happening again, you hear? Or I will make
My lips press together into a thin line. I remember that look from the last slip into drugs Sherlock had taken. It is one of the scariest things I have seen too. Sherlock carries on, “Mycroft realized that I was ripping myself apart in that rehab. He took me out and moved me into his house. He convinced Lestrade to work with me, under the condition that I never came onto crime scenes high again. The time in the hospital brought me through the withdrawal, but Mycroft and Lestrade, they saved my life, my mind."
Rosie shrieks and dissolves into joyful giggles. “Does this mean I get to wear a pretty dress?”
Standing outside, John stares at the closed door. The click of her kitten heels announces Mrs. Hudson’s presence before she appears at the end of the hall. “Oh, John,” she tuts, taking in his furrowed brow and the mess of wet sand on his socks. “You were supposed to attach it to the end of a broom, like the feather duster. Control it from a distance.” Shaking her head, she turns away, leaving John more confused than he was before. How was he supposed to know that?
Clenching and unclenching my fist a few times, I pick up the worn envelope. God, he must have read and re-read the stupid thing. I can’t look into his face—even though so much of me wants to, hoping there might still be something left for us.
Sherlock’s eyes roll. “Pretty sure brushing my teeth isn’t going to stop the flow of time, John.”
fingerprint as
At the same time, Sherlock adds, “Watson-Holmes does have a nice ring to it.”
When he finishes the story, emotion spent, Sherlock’s body shivers and crumples, and he loses balance on his chair, starting to slide to the floor.
Turning his gaze towards me, he concedes. A small “perhaps" being his only acquiescence. A muffled wail descends the stairs.
“Are you ready to try going back to sleep now?” His voice is so quiet and low that I almost don't hear him, but the proximity of his lips to my ear makes it impossible to miss, his warm breath electrifying my skin.
“Couple hours.” Sherlock nods and folds to the ground, gracefully sinking into his pile of blankets. After a moment, he tosses one to John, who wraps it around his shoulders to ward off the chill damp of the flat.
When Lestrade has a chance to understand everything Sherlock just yelled at him, a look of utter confusion consumes his face. “Wait. Back up. Koala? Where did a koala come into all of this? What the hell are you on about, Sherlock?”
My eyes slide shut, and John takes over feeding Rosie, her delighted shriek expressing her opinion on the matter. Playing through several scenarios in my head, I can’t settle on the most probable, too many variables.
! The wife was obviously cheating on the victim with the koala kidnapper and convinced the kidnapper to abscond with her
, John,” Sherlock wails, trying to right himself. The sight of him, his long, gangly limbs flailing, sends John over the edge. Giggling, he can’t resist indulging in a little extra teasing.
Though I’m doing my best not to shut him out anymore, even with such obvious pain showing from him, in this moment, I find it difficult not to hide my own pain in efforts to comfort him. But John sees the start of the attempt anyway. “Oh god, you still do. Sherlock, you must know—you
Sherlock scowls. “I can’t just
The word struck me. This would have been a normal response. But the word was spoken in such a soft, almost nervous way that it wasn't right. My steps falter for a moment on my way to the kitchen when the realization catches up with me.
Giving John a mild look of confusion, I respond to Nancy. “Well, yes. I certainly have endeavored too. But, John is the one who began all the business with the nightmares.”
“I do, John. I always have.” An obvious swallow makes Sherlock pause. An earnest look of flashes across his face before he continues. “You have to believe me, John. There was no other way. I had to protect you. You, and Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. I couldn’t…” his eyes close for a brief moment, brows furrowing together, “I couldn’t allow anything to happen to you. I wouldn’t have survived.” A few more words are mumbled under his breath that John chooses to ignore for now.
Sherlock sniffs. “You’re in quarantine, John. I
“By God, what is wrong with you people.
The morning passes by in a whirlwind of Rosie. Pick up, change, breakfast, play, squeals, and toddles. By the time lunch rolls around, the conversation of the morning has been whisked away from my mind. I put her down for a nap and find Sherlock in his thinking position, flat out on the couch, dressing gown and all.
, I don't add aloud.
“Alright?”
“John...” Sherlock’s voice is rough, strained, and John can’t stand it. Can’t wait another second as it all clicks into place: the rose petals, the avoidance, the pillow with Sherlock’s shirt. The haze of longing in Sherlock’s eyes.
Tangled, defeated, they lie on the floor, breathing loudly. A giggle bubbles up from John’s chest, and Sherlock’s deep chuckle rumbles through John where their bodies press together.
Gathering myself, I'm able to offer a quiet response. “Ok. I won’t. For as long as you’ll have me.” Our eyes stay locked as Sherlock sits up, now hovering above me, and slides closer. His eyes search mine before they flick to my lips for a brief second. “Sherlock…” I breathe, soft and low in the space between us, his mouth drawing my attention. Looking up into his gaze once more, I find trust and affection welcoming me in. My tongue darts out to wet my lips as he draws near.
“Oh, for…” John rubs a hand over his face, shaking his head with a pained smile before looking back at Sherlock’s shocked expression. “I dated women, and I’m attracted to you… you can’t put two and two together?”
respond. He deserves to know. To know that I've changed.
“Yes! Yes, the dust-bit holder!”
Beside John, Sherlock rolls over with a snort and a blink, trying to orient himself to the world and what was happening. But John looks down and sees his daughter looking up at him with her big blue eyes and tear stains on her cheeks.
, and Sherlock recoils in shock. Before he can fully recover, John is standing, his hands flexing helplessly at his sides, his expression twisting, clearly preparing himself to say…
John interrupts me with a rushed whisper, “Yes. I... I didn’t mean to tell you, and you don’t have to respond. I swear I don’t want this to change anything. I know you don't do that sort of thing.”
John grabs his hand and gives it a small squeeze. “I figured, love. Don’t worry about it. Let’s just go rip Anderson a new one and then get some food in you. Sound good?”
They had been following the bandits they were chasing for close to an hour, and John observed, not for the first time, that the Prince followed trails like no hunter John had ever met. Certainly parts of the two processes were identical, as both included looking for footsteps and other small signs of the prey’s passage; but John was pretty sure the steady stream of muttered deductions that was barely reaching his ears was specific to Sherlock. The man seemed to employ a curious combination of physical clues, analysis of the hunted villains’ states of mind and truly fantastical leaps of logic – yet John never doubted that they were on the right track, and indeed from time to time a detail stood out that was obvious enough to indicate even to normal people a group of armed men had gone through those bushes a short time previously.
The silence that fell between them then was sudden to say the least and should probably have felt awkward, but it really didn’t – perhaps because they had both said all they needed to. Sherlock had offered his knight one of the keys necessary to understand the enigmatic man a little better and John had reciprocated by not directly acknowledging the rare gift it was; and somehow, nothing seemed to summarize their complicated relationship better than this moment.
“Hello. It seems we’ve made a habit of meeting everyday.”
John’s smile became more sincere at the query.
“Extraordinary; truly…extraordinary.”
Standing where he was, slightly in the shadows, let him observe the festivities, the complex tension that seemed to emanate from the newly-bound couple, Captain Lestrade’s apparently involuntary glances towards their King as he stood a few feet away from the table on guard duty (perhaps John had been hasty in assuming it was the weight of his duty that had preoccupied him those past days) and Sherlock’s ostensibly-bored face or, when the Prince forgot himself, inquisitive looks thrown at any element that could appear to be out-of-place.
John stared uncomprehendingly at his hand; it was hard to be certain, but it seemed to be smeared with black or dark red liquid.
He had tried to make Sherlock take interest in a game of chess; Sherlock had beaten him in five minutes and sighed a little in the way that meant he honestly pitied most of humanity for not having his brain. He had then made the Prince play without four of his main pieces; he had been checkmated in less than half-an-hour. He had finally forced Sherlock to sit with his back to the chessboard and announce aloud where his pieces should be set, which had amused him for about an afternoon as he beat John three more times.
“My Lady, I wanted to thank you most sincerely for your kindness in letting me stay here. My mother sends her warmest regards, and this letter.”
His first source of bewilderment had been the Prince’s bedchambers; although the furniture was as richly decorated as one would expect from a royal bedroom, no one had seemingly tidied anything up in the last five years; his trying to do so, if only to access the bed and writing table that occupied the smaller room he was to have, was met with grudging acceptance at best and frank annoyance at worst from Sherlock.
“Those men,” a negligent wave in direction of the five bodies on the ground “have been harassing travellers in those woods for almost a whole lunar cycle now – pillaging and killing and the like. As these woods belong to the royal grounds, the problem has been brought to my attention. I’m afraid, however, that my reputation as an able fencer has disserved me in this instance, as I was unable to ensure that they attacked me – therefore I enlisted Molly’s help.”
“Certainly they would have. Their only question would have been to know why it hadn’t happened sooner and what I was waiting for to follow in my dear big brother’s humongous footsteps.”
“I-I’m not sure he did, Sire. Certainly he could have, as I was busy looking for a basin for Princess Adler.”
Suddenly wishing to be nowhere near the vicinity of the King, Sherlock turned to leave, throwing a last, vicious parting shot at Lady Sarah.
Except for the Princess’s warning about the dangers she thought herself to be in, they hadn’t talked alone since the delegation’s arrival.
“King Mycroft.”
John had to admit he was intrigued – his heart had clenched as Sherlock had snapped out of his thoughts with a familiar look of triumph on his face only to turn to Lady Sarah, but the direction the questioning had taken was unexpected to say the least.
“There are no ‘Prince’s Knights’.”
The Princess only laughed, a clear bell of a laugh, taking off the official guard headwear with obvious relish and shaking her head a little to free her hair.
The other man’s expression went through several emotions in the space of a second before it became perfectly blank once more.
“What about Sir Moran, the regent’s manservant? An elderly man, with a high forehead and a grizzled moustache.”
“You were poisoned. Belladonna extract, if we’re to believe Physician Thompson, but not a truly dangerous amount – she didn’t administer morphine. You’ve been out for a few hours and I have a few rather urgent questions to ask you.”
Even later, as they finally roused themselves, Sherlock received a missive he immediately held out to John: impossibly, Moran had escaped from his cell. Sherlock looked at his lover and smiled a slow, dangerous smile at him; Moriarty, he whispered, and John’s heart, unaccountably, skipped a beat. But then the smile directed at him turned a bit brighter, and Sherlock, uncharacteristically, tugged slightly on both of his hands:
“Be as it may, your two months trial is getting to an end – and I must confess I’m still not convinced that this situation should be allowed to continue.”
“Please, Lord Astair.” The King’s voice immediately resonated. “I understand your panic, but please consider that on the eve of an alliance that would have strengthened both our Kingdoms, neither my brother nor I would have had any reason to harm the Princess. Please stay back, so that my Physician may examine Princess Irene.”
“Hello, John. What are you doing around here?”
“Sire! I’ve found this suspect individual roaming the royal halls and immediately made sure he could intrude no further. His story as to why he’s here was decidedly strange as well.”
John had rarely felt as exhausted. Princess Adler, still to be monitored closely, had been put to bed, the Colonel had been thrown in a cell, men had been sent out on a search for an eventual accomplice awaiting for Moran’s signal in what even John could recognize as a frankly ridiculous tentative. He had had a long and painful conversation with Lady Sarah, who explained with a firm voice but without meeting his eyes that her Mistress had wanted Sherlock to be alert  and to be aware of a Moriarty’s existence (apparently this was a name he was supposed to know so he didn’t interrupt her, carefully memorising it) and had decided a direct threat to what he held dear was the best way to make sure he felt implicated.
The guard immediately stepped away from the wall he had pushed John against.
“Lady Sarah, would you answer a few of my questions?”
“I’m sure you do.” Mycroft slowly made his way to him from where he’d been standing at the window, eyebrow raised inquisitively, and Sherlock was abruptly reminded of everything that annoyed him in his older brother. “You do seem to have formed an unusual…attachment to this knight of yours.”
The scene had painted himself in sharp colours against John’s closed lids as he listened and his heart hurt quite a bit as he almost saw the boys his land’s leaders had been and imagined them thrown much too early and much too alone in a world of power and politics. The idea of Mycroft using their late parents’ memories to get his little brother to listen to him was unpalatable, but then so was his mind’s vision of a young King who had had to change his very nature so as to conform to his parents’ wishes.
