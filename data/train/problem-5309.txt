As Peter stepped out of the doorway and into the building’s main hallway, he felt the sting of his mom’s words.  He wanted to shout back, but every time he tried, he was unable to speak.  Making his way to the end of the hallway, Peter could only think of getting into the elevator.  He knew that once he was in the lobby, it would only take minutes for Steve to get him.
“Not really, we’re generally pretty friendly.  We can adopt basically any creature into our packs.  I mean, look at the Avengers, there’s you, whatever the hell Natasha is, a bird shifter, the Hulk, and a demi-God, and you’re all still pack.  So, your snakes like me, do they?”
“Honey, we both agree that the asshole had it coming.  Please just tell us what happened, so your Pop will let me go to sleep.”  Tony ignored Steve’s glare – he’d had enough of being a united front for the evening and was ready to put this behind them.
Finally catching up to what Peter said, Steve rushed to comfort him.  “I always love you, I hope you know that.  How long have you been thinking this?” Taking only a short pause Steve began speaking again.  “Wait, no, you don’t have to answer that.  It wasn’t supposed to be an accusation.  I don’t really know what to say, so I’ll stop.”  While Steve rambled, he stroked Peter’s hair gently.
“No, there was a lot of mistaken science about actual wolves that people tried to pass off onto us werewolves.  Mostly we form mated pairs and have packs that include our kids, siblings, and close friends.  But packs also tend to end up with adopted members.  Are your snakes venomous?” Steve asked, gesturing to the snake that Tony was offering a bit of grape.
Seeing Peter like this always reminded Steve of the first few months of his marriage to Tony.  Though Pepper wanted the divorce, she wasn’t supportive of Tony’s new marriage.  Steve had never known if it was because Tony had officially come out as bisexual or because the court deemed a two-parent household as “more stable” and gave them primary custody of Peter.  Either way, Peter had been flustered and nervous when going to Pepper’s every other weekend.  At first, Tony had thought that that was because Peter didn’t get to see his mom enough, but increasing visits to every weekend had only made the problem worse.  Back on the original schedule, Peter had relaxed over the years.  It had been a long time since Peter had reacted this badly to the upcoming visit.
After a few moments of silence, Peter spoke up.  “I’m starving.  I feel like I haven’t eaten in days.”  To compliment this, he dramatically flopped across his dad’s lap.
Morgan sprinted to her brother, wrapping her small arms around his legs.  Clearly not realizing the gravity of the situation, Morgan squealed, “Papa says we’re having a movie night, Petey!  Isn’t that fun?”
Once back in Pepper’s apartment, Peter decided to make his move.  “Mom, will you call me Peter, even if you don’t understand why I want you to?”  It was a last-ditch effort, but Peter would do what he had to in order to avoid being called Maria.
“Fine, I give up.” Steve muttered, getting out of the car.  “If you don’t want to shift back, you can start school as a spider.”  Steve opened Peter’s door and gently lifted him from his seat.  “If you’re more comfortable like this, you can stay a spider, but you have to go to school.”
At this, Peter grasped a marker and paper as if to indicate that he could have fun here, as a spider.
“When they talk about things getting serious on the third date, that’s not what they usually mean.”  Despite his teasing words, Tony joined Steve on the couch and cleared space on the coffee table for the picnic.
Peter barely had the presence of mind to nod as his face flushed.  Eventually, he’d ask his dad how he knew all of these things, but for now, he just felt loved and supported.
To the contrary, Steve seemed weighed down by the situation.  He took Peters bag in one hand, and ran the other through Peters hair a few times.  “Let’s go.  Your dad will be home in a few hours.  Until then, I promised someone Frozen.”
Steve lazily blinked his eyes open to look up at his husband.  “Your kid has some news.”  He murmured softly, not wanting to disturb the still sleeping Peter.
“No, nothing like that, but…” Steve paused, trying to find the words to comfort his husband without outing his son.  “But it shouldn’t come from me,” was what Steve finally came up with.
“Of course, they have chocolate chips,” Steve said, putting the pancake on a plate.  “This one’s for Peter, and the next one’s yours.”  As soon as Steve said those words, he realized his mistake.
“It’s Peter.”  Peter paused while the hint of a smile crept onto his face.  “I like Peter.  And, you know, I said I’d come out to my parents once I had a new name, so that’s today, especially since Morgan is with Aunt May tonight.”
“Yes, I’d say so.  This is pretty good news for the two of you, for now at least.  She won’t need any care aside from what you’ve already been doing.  When you look for daycares and schools, be sure to let them know that she’s a witch.  Typically, witches start training very early, so you’ll want her to start daycare at age one.  That should help her control her powers until she can speak.  Do either of you have a witch in the family?”
“No,” came Pepper’s simple response.  “I don’t know what Tony will tell you, if you tell him, but I refuse to encourage this kind of behavior.”  Pepper’s posture belied her confidence that Tony would say the same.
“I’ll make some tea, we can talk about this, and then we’ll all go to bed.”  Steve said as he headed toward the kitchen.
Steve startled when he heard the voice behind him.  “Is that what this is?”  Looking into the crib it was now apparent that Peter was a shapeshifter and that his form was a spider.  “I never realized that spiders could be visibly upset. How am I supposed to pick him up?”  Steve was already reaching for the overgrown spider.
The two kids got up from the floor, Peter helped Morgan get up on the stool next to his, and the morning proceeded like all Saturday mornings in the penthouse.
“Fine, I give up.  This is between you and your dad.  Make sure that you have something to take your phone in.”  Steve stomped off.  “And text me if you need anything.” He called over his shoulder.
“I wouldn’t worry too much for now.  Until she can talk and walk, her powers should be limited to sparkles.  Do ask your friend for tips, though.”  The pediatrician handed Sarah back to Steve.  “Tony, any questions?”
“Yeah, I’ll be waiting in the lobby.”  Peter grabbed his suitcase, which he’d barely opened since being at his mom’s house.
Tony, who had been on the verge of tears all morning, was trying to hide his laughter – watching a grown man argue with a child-sized spider was never not funny.  But enough was enough, “Peter, I know you’re nervous, but you’ll have so much fun.”
At their mention, Steve’s ears twitched on top of his head.  “I can fully shift.  It happens automatically during the full moon, but I can also shift at will any time.  Can gorgons really kill with a look?”
It was a week later, when Peter was getting ready to go to his mom’s house, that Steve finally decided to ask Peter about Pepper.  When Steve tried to ask Tony to do it, Tony had, for the hundredth time, reminded Steve that “Peter’s relationship with Pepper is not my problem.”  To avoid the inevitable fight, Steve waited until Tony had left for the day to talk about it.
“Well, people usually don’t date creatures that are so different.  You must have some questions about werewolves.”  Steve laid out the picnic on the table and passed Tony a plate.  “I know I have some questions about gorgons, if you don’t mind me asking.”
“Oh, that’s not a big deal.”  Tony’s relief was evident on his face.  “I mean, that’s not what I meant.  Clearly, this is a very big deal to you.  This is very important information about you.  But it doesn’t change anything.”  Tony sent a worried glance to Steve.  “I mean, it changes things, obviously.  Of course, I’ll call you Peter.  What I’m trying to say, is that I’m proud to call you my son, and I still love you.  I’ll always love you.”  Finally satisfied with his answer, Tony took a breath and turned to look at Steve for approval.  Despite Tony’s endless teasing, Steve was the one who read all of those parenting books.
“Oh, you are, gorgeous,”  Tony assured him, still grinning.  “Meet you out front in ten,”  Then he ended the call before Steve’s flirting cost him any more of the precious time he was going to need to get himself cleaned up and find a shirt that didn’t look like he’d been building robots in it.
There was exactly one level surface in the whole place not buried in papers, books, and arcane, unknowable robot-clutter, and that was the seat of the recliner.  If Steve was going to be generous, about half of the small table beside it was clear too, give or take a beer bottle.  And in pride of place over the recliner...
And maybe that was why Steve -- the Steve who never quite stopped being tiny, hungry, and furious, found the lip to answer back to that silent, panicked voice,
Steve conjured up a smile and turned it toward him as he hurried up the last few steps to Tony’s side.  "Just turning my phone off," he said, though it hadn't been on since the moment he'd hung up with Tony at the subway entrance.  "Don't want to be interrupted."
The man managed to give a put-upon sigh even as he was clearly ogling Barnes, but he waved a passing hand all the same, saying “No one lets me have any fun.  In you go then.  No cover for Leatherbois and Hot Dads at this hour of night.”
She boosted her chin, squared her shoulders like she was facing a firing squad.  “Getting Rogers has already cost us more than any other op we’ve run,” she said, all defiance.  “He cost us Stark, and he cost us Carter, her entire security detail, and we’re still figuring out how many covers were burned getting him into our hands.  And for what?”  her hands broke formation, a futile, fluttering gesture that seemed to speak more of distress than rage.  “What did those losses buy us aside from a famous name we can’t let him use?  It got us a twitchy, pig headed relic of a vet with PTSD and survivor’s guilt decades deep, whom we can’t even send for counseling, in case someone leaks!  I don’t call that a good return on investment, sir!”
“Well, it seems to me,” Rogers said, taking a measuring glance at each of them, but letting it rest on Barnes just a little longer.  “Seems to me that there’s a lot of people who don’t come back from experiences like kidnapping and ransom exchanges, but there’s a lot
“Or pneumonia’s a little springtime cold,”  Barnes agreed, pure threat in his voice, which Clint worked hard not to find adorable, on account of metal elbows were sharp.
Tony had cracked open the minibar then, and sat there all night, drinking with his naked reflection until the both of them blurred into an angry, miserable sleep.  The next morning, Jarvis had come into Tony’s room to find him still there, propped up naked against the wall, and snoring over a constellation of tiny liquor bottles that owed him no favors.
A night wind rustled the cypress trees overhead, traffic distant and muffled under the sound. Jarvis realized all at once that he could hear shoes crunching on the gravel path, but after an anxious moment, relaxed.  Only one, and no play of a watchman’s torch across the grassy patch where he stood.  It would be James, then.  On time, as usual.
thing Tony needed in his life right now was a public squabble with a jealous ex lover, or a current lover who would ghost out of his life rather than ending things cleanly when the time came.
That kinda put the pin back in everyone’s grenade.  Even Barnes was thrown by the curveball, though he was probably relying on his sniperface to cover the fact.  Fury tilted his head to peer at the scribble, which Clint could just make out, along with the date and phone number, and ... “Christine Everhardt did several stories on Stark’s kid before he died, didn’t she?”  Clint recalled.  “I think she was playing up the whole Prodigal Son of the Merchant of Death angle.  Pissed Howard right the fuck off was what it did.”
It was a surprisingly effective tactic, Steve had to admit.  "Well, in my ma's defense, " he said, reaching out to work open the chair's fastenings down Tony's legs, "She always told me I was named after my grandfather."
As if hearing the thought, Steve finished the chug with a sigh, and smacked his lips as he stood upright.  “Good job,” Steve said, drawing Tony up out of the shaky half-lunge warrior two pose he’d been holding forever and five hours at least.  “Ready to do the left side now?”
She smiled back at him, declaring with her eyes that she wasn’t taken in by his act at all.  “And you’re awfully calm about a gun in your face, Captain Rogers.”
No one from Stark Industries got back to her.  Not until it was time for she and Victor as the remaining partners, to sign over ARC, its patents, its holdings, its equipment, and everything they’d built together to its new owners, and then take their consolation prize retirement packages, and go home.  She’d drunk for a week, locked herself in her apartment, and cried pretty much anytime she wasn’t asleep or raging at ghosts.  Ivan had drunk for a week, assaulted three Stark Industries shareholders, and gotten himself sent to jail for attempted murder.  And their shared dream of a clean-energy, saving-the-world, revolutionizing-medical-technology legacy had disappeared into the guts of Stark Industries, never to be seen again.
“At first, I left you alone because I know what hunted looks like on a person’s face, even when they’re smiling and being gracious to hide it,” he said.  “I didn’t want to be part of the problem that seemed like it might drive you away.”
“He’s fine,” she answered fondly as she got her coat and bag, “Coaching boxers over in Queens these days, but he still does a little security work now and then.  He asks about you too.  You should really make time to see each other, you know?”
He didn’t say that kind of thing anymore.  Not because he wasn’t a genius, of course, and definitely not because he wasn’t vain.  It was more like Life had gone out of its way to instruct Tony as to the depth of his privilege, and what kind of genius could he claim to be if he refused to learn a lesson like that one?
Tony couldn’t help smiling.  “Nothing,” he promised, watching those expressive eyes speak their silent truths.  “I just wanted to see you.”  Oh mercy, there went that pretty blush again, rosy and perfect as it brightened those chiseled cheekbones like the dawn.  Tony wanted badly to see just how far down that shy pink spread, but he found that even more, he wanted to keep Steve’s gaze on his, to hold it steady and watch the shadows clear from those bright eyes, leaving only trusting heat behind.  Until Steve could look back at him and know Tony meant every word when he breathed, “You’re so beautiful.”
Barnes turned back to shoot Clint a glare, the plates on his arm whirring in annoyance.  Clint backed away, both hands turned upward in a shrug to demonstrate his complete and utter innocence.  “Not my fault,” he said, “I was minding my own business by the pool!”
He’d done it.  He’d fucking done it!  He had mastered the Full Extension Tea Challenge at fucking last!
“Darn it,” he muttered, sticking his head into the humming transformer box in case it had fallen farther back behind the machinery.  “These stupid things are too expensive to...”
"So you lost him three hours ago,"  Nick prompted, striding over to take the carafe away and pour out a cup for himself before smacking it back down in front of the man.
“That’s all I’m after here," Tony promised, lifting a hand in invitation, leading this trusting stranger to lay himself out, naked and hard in Tony's unmade bed.  It was nothing short of a quiet miracle when Steve did just that, settling in warm and strong alongside him, asking nothing, offering everything.  Tony couldn't help smiling as he leaned low to kiss those blue eyes closed, murmuring, "That’s all I need.”
Behind him, Clint heard Barnes take a sharp breath, and a hesitant step toward the desk.  “Steve?” he asked, wary and worried.
“So instead of leaving the number with Jarvis, or putting a note in my message box, you decided you had to come out here and scout the terrain?”
“I just hadn’t gotten on the train yet,”  Steve came back, all huffy as he correctly divined that he’d been busted lingering about close while he waited for Tony to call him.  “I could maybe ride around for half an hour if that’d make you feel safer though!”
The club was still half full, though it was clear at a glance that hardly anyone was sober, and quite a few were deeply impaired.  Most of those were reeling about the postage-stamp sized dance floor though, grinding against anyone who’d grind back as the thumping bass and wailing guitars made their introductions for them.  Phil could feel Barnes close the gap between them, his mute menace radiating as warmth from two inches behind Phil’s left shoulder as they made their way through the taproom’s constellation of tables, toward the bar, where two people hunched over drinks and a cell phone at one end, and at least three people were engaged in some level of congress in the shadows behind the waiter’s station at the other end.
“Just,”  Tony gasped, arching his back to better feel that magnificent weight inside him, “like that.  Can you wait to come till I tell you?”
Tony didn’t answer, just plucked the envelope from her hands, slipped a long file under the flap and cut the top, his expression oddly intense, as though he was equal parts alarmed, and excited, and couldn’t tell which one to feel first.  Then he dropped the small card into his hand, and flipped it open to reveal two lines of text, a number, and a signature.
“And if I did ask you to do that, you’d feel bound to go along with me and make sure I didn’t touch anything dangerous too, wouldn’t you?”  Rogers’ voice held a deeply bitter note, but he still took up the plate and led the way across the lawn, as if he didn’t have a doubt in the world that Clint would fall in behind him.  Either that, or he was fed up enough to just kick his way into the garage and find the secret door to the underground workshop on his own.
Aaand the plot thickens!  In case it wasn't clear before, the Jarvis who answered the phone was indeed the Edwin Jarvis from Agent Carter.  I realize I have played fast and loose with lifespans here, but I'm handwaving that as having something mumblemumble to do with exposure to the Tesseract, okay?  And anyway, my own grandfather broke his wrist at 92 by falling off a roof, so healthy activity into old age is totally a thing!
“Yeah, well.”  Sarah gestured broadly.  “So anyway, we were at this concert and some weirdo kept hitting on Winnie.  Which was bullshit.”
“That’s… an awful long time to deal with something like this alone.”  Steve was shocked he hadn’t noticed something was going on sooner.  “Have you told your dad, yet? Are you planning to?”  Steve thought of the outsized reaction Tony would have.  He’d been discussing throwing a coming out party for a few months – this would surely encourage those plans further.
But things hadn’t been so simple.  Between Peter leaving school for the day and Steve getting home, Peter had begun to worry again.  He ended up crying on the living room couch before anyone else even got home.
“Waited for what?  And where are you?  I feel like I shouldn’t walk around too much.”  Steve had seen Tony’s workshop before, but it had never been this much of a mess.  Spare pieces of the Ironman suit littered the floor, and every available surface was covered in a combination of tools and half-drunk coffee cups.
“Just Bucky and my Ma, until the war.  Then, it was the 107th.  Now, it’s you and the Avengers.  Do you have to feed the snakes, or do they share whatever you eat?”
Stuffing two more shirts into his already over-full suitcase, Peter finally began trying to zip the thing.  “Yeah, it’ll be fine – it’s just a weekend anyway.”  Peter was grateful when Steve stood to help him zip the suitcase.  “What are your and dad’s plans for the weekend anyway?”
“Peter, you need to shift back.  It’s a lot easier to make friends in person form.”  Steve urged, not for the first time.
“You fucking stuck up bastard, hiding behind your friends. You think this is how a real alpha acts?” Rhodey snarled.
“A large iced caramel macchiato with no cane sugar and extra whip,” Tony repeated, a brow raised, “and a cheese danish.”
Not wanting to aggravate the prison guard, even though all the red flags were ringing in his head, he took of his last article of clothing quickly.
He picked his omega up in his arm, wrapping Tony’s legs around his waist and carried the omega to the bedroom.
“Stevie, you can’t be serious,” Bucky said, arms crossed, “living with your brother’s husband- the husband you have been in love with for over 17 years! This is a disaster waiting to happen.”
“Hydra rewrote the history books,” Iron man said, “when I grew up, no one talked much of Captain America’s exploits other than his role against Hydra- Hydra’s greatest nemesis and the enemy to the people. But my- Howard Stark. He kept all the memorabilia from the World War 2 era. He had a fascination with Captain America, something that bordered on obsession.”
The next couple of weeks were pure agony. Steve berated himself, constantly with a self loathing so intense, he didn’t get out of bed for days after he was freshly kicked out of the house. Tony was… everything to Steve, and just to lose him so quickly- so suddenly after tasting what it was like to live with the omega… it was a crushing blow. What would be worse was having to face Ransom after this whole debacle. Ransom would surely not take this very well, having always been very protective and guarded over what was his.
Rogers dragged Hammer by the collar to the middle of the square, saying quite calmly, “everyone listen up.”
“It’s good to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled,” Tony said quietly.
Steve’s eyes lingered on Iron man. Out of everyone here, the robot seemed the most dangerous. But also, surprisingly, the most understanding of Steve’s situation.
Tony was nervous. No, that wasn’t quite the word for what Tony was feeling. Tony was shaking, sweating profusely, holding the paper in his hands like a shield. But Tony couldn’t call it
“Why are you interviewing for an entry level job at a department store and not NASA?” The manager asked.
Rogers looked down at him with a vicious kissed bitten smile. Tony felt powerful in Roger’s arms. Powerful in a way he never felt before.
“Fuck off, Rogers hasn’t even touched the sub. No hickeys no nothing. This pretty sub is ripe for the taking,” the dom, Hammer, said, leaning over to grab Tony’s arm.
He recalled what his father told him- that the stories of the people of legend were just stupid nonsense used to scare children and the unschooled. Tony swallowed. Though he hated his father at this very moment, he couldn’t help holding onto his ideologies like a man holding onto a rope at a cliff face for dear life.
Tony shuddered, body growing rigid. Those were the exact words Obadiah said to him on their wedding night.
The guy couldn’t even act. He just fumbled his way on stage, staring at Tony, taunting him the whole damn time. The only reason he got the part was because he was an alpha.
There were no guards in sight, which was odd because Tony swore he saw someone in uniform just a second before.
“Stevie would never hurt that omega intentionally, because he has a big fat crush on him,” Bucky said.
“I’m- I’m sorry- please- I- I didn’t mean- I should- sorry- I-“ tears ran down his lover’s face, genuine tears of anguish and it hurt Steve to see Tony’s despair, “punish me- please- I-“
“Yeah,” Rogers smiled snidely, looking at Tony through long blonde lashes, “I can use you. I can use you to get me my dinner. Get up.”
Tony even thought he saw a grand portrait of himself in one of the rooms, though he was quickly ushered away.
Tony couldn’t. Tony wouldn’t. Angry tears gathered in Tony’s eyes, but Tony wouldn’t let them fall. He turned his head to wipe at them quickly, breath growing ragged.
He thought about running away. He could run away and start anew. Go into one of those omega shelters and pretend to be another person. But Obadiah would look for him, he would relentlessly search until he found Tony.
Tony sighed, waved off the projection and looked down at his phone. He already had the number typed out on the screen.
At his words, there was a rumbling of thunder and the pitter-pattering of rain down the veranda. Tony held himself in his arms, hunching over. What the hell? The sky was completely clear a minute before. The daylight sky was growing darker by the minute.
“What are you? A robot? What are all of you? And why do you wear such ridiculous costumes?” Steve asked, curiosity taking the better of him.
“Honestly,” Reed sighed, “I don’t know. Like I said, Iron man is very secretive, but Tony seems to trust him and that’s good enough for me.”
Steve stopped, voice trapped in his throat. It was him, the most beautiful omega he’d ever seen, Tony Stark. The omega, who looked like he came straight outta an movie screen, walked up to Steve, doe eyes locked onto his phone, typing away quickly, “uh, can I have a large iced caramel macchiato with no cane sugar and extra whip please?”
“Oh, oh, it is exactly like that. You are trying to seduce another man’s husband- what’s worse! Your own brother’s omega!” Bucky snapped, “you’re trying to steal your brother’s family!”
“Why? Hasn’t the Stanes done enough? Everyone knows they sell their weapons under the table“ the blonde sub, Clint, said conversationally, “they never cared about who they hurt as long as they get to line their pockets-“
At this velocity, the ocean waves would destroy the craft, him, and the bomb instantaneously. It was what he was counting on. To save his world he would do this again a thousand times over.
“It’ll just be you two at the store,” Sharon explained, “I’m going on my break, you think Tony can handle reg, James?”
Tony was quick to strike a conversation with the switch, pleased to find the switch matching him topic for topic.
“Then your holy matrimony has been sealed from the earth to the stars,” the gruff older voice stated, “you may kiss the groom.”
There were many people waiting at the gates when he arrived alone. Tony kept his head down, eyes discreetly scanning the people as he walked off into the compound.
“If you’re going to assimilate into society now, you should wear something different,” the robot said and something in his tone said he was frowning. Which was weird since he was a robot not a human.
“If you loved him, why did you tell him that you were just playing with him when you dumped him in front of the whole school.”
“You better, little brother,” Ransom said with a cheeky grin, before his smile turned serious, “thank you, Steve. Truely. I can’t trust anyone else. If anything happened to me… you’re the only one I can trust with this.”
“Get out!” Tony nearly shouted as Greg picked up his jacket to leave, laughing softly at the click of the door closing behind him.
Until one night, when he said his goodbyes, getting ready for bed, and a woman appeared out of nowhere.
Steve used one finger to circle Tony’s hole lazily, the other grabbing a packet of lube and opening it with his teeth. Tony watched him, eyes blazing with lust, “green.”
“We have the same goal. We both love the little shit even though he makes it hard,” Rhodey grouched.
Steve walked into the cell, disregarding where Tony sat completely, walking to the sink and washing up. Tony watched, feeling that familiar feeling of hopelessness and jealousy. If he was born a dom, he could do as he pleased. If he was born a dom, perhaps Howard would have loved him. If he was born a dom, he wouldn’t be here, because Obi would never have touched him.
“It’s alright, Tony,” Steve smiled sadly, “we are all broken. I’m the man out of time. I should know that.”
“A dom tried to have a go at him,” the quiet dom said, “this will only be the first. I’m sure Hammer wanted to test the waters.”
Tony felt bad that he couldn’t remember everyone’s names but he tried his best. It was hard honest work and Tony found himself enjoying it at times. The only thing he didn’t enjoy about the job were, surprisingly, his breaks.
“Steve Rogers rings any bells? Captain America?” Greg’s smile curved down, “I don’t want you to have anything to do with him.”
Tony sat up when he heard that familiar voice, tears not yet fallen down his cheeks, stomping off into the direction of the restrooms. Rhodey knew that Tony didn’t like to show his bullies that he was crying because of them, so, after Tony was out of hearing range, Rhodey took things into his own hands.
For the next couple of days, Bucky shadowed Tony, quietly telling him what to do and how things were done. He taught Tony how to man the register, how to get the food items ready, how to clean, clean, clean- everything had to be cleaned ten times over- and most difficult of all, how to make the drinks.
The man was tall, taller than Tony and well muscled in a way that made Tony blush. Tony had stared at the man occasionally through the window, watching the man work in his front yard. He was totally Tony’s type. Young, strong, fair haired. He made Ty look like a twig with limbs.
But if he knew, Tony never spoke them out loud. He continued to tinker and keep Steve’s gifts but Steve no longer gave a new one every week. Steve loved watching Tony in the nursery turned small lab, tinkering away.
“Don’t worry about it, Tony, he’s just going to go punch something and he’ll be right as rain,” Clint said with a knowing smile.
“I love you,” Steve confessed, “I know. It’s so wrong of me. You’re my brother’s husband. But I can’t- I can’t control my heart. I’ve loved you since I first laid eyes on you.”
“You can be yourself. A marriage should not mean that you stifle that part of yourself for another,” Steve said.
“He’s trouble. Like Tiberius Stone trouble,” Greg’s gaze went dark, “I don’t want anything bad happening to you, brother.”
JARVIS compiled a whole influx of data on Steve Rogers, everything from the secure secret Shield to the public forums, past, future, present. Not only that, J compiled it from most important to least, allowing Tony to look through the info.
were distant in his mind. Tony felt slightly spooked, feeling wandering eyes on him as he stepped forward on the red carpet. His wet clothes fell away as he walked towards the altar, leaving behind a rippling white dress suit made out of silk so soft it felt like wearing a dream. A long train like that of a veil covered his face. He was too entranced to notice.
“Yeah, I want you to take care of them while I’m gone,” Ransom said, “none of your playboy nonsense, Steve. If you have anyone over- and I mean anyone- if I hear from Tony that you are fucking random people at my house-“
With that fire burning in his belly, he walked into the forest, looking around. There had to be a cave or some sort of shelter with which he could weather the storm- there was a mansion in the middle of the woods. He blinked. The mansion remained.
“I know more than you think, Steve. Like the fact that Obadiah- the sleaze ball- rented out his sub to the highest bidder in the black market. And if the bidder bid even higher, he’d give Tony away while he was still in his drop. The Mandarin was one of those bidders,” Natasha explained.
Tony shook his head, no, not when he came all this way. Not when he brutally murdered his former dom. That left one option. This nameless dom.
“Oh,” Rhodey said. He went about this situation the exact wrong way. He held out his hand and helped Rogers up, “I’m James Rhodes.”
Steve waved as Tony drove away to the dealership, where he spent several grueling hours working behind cars and out of sight. During the breaks he took, he was too tired to contemplate even calling his son to check up on him.
“Please,” Tony had pleaded, “Obi had sold weapons to the public and the syndicates, my weapons! They have my name on them! They’ll skin me alive!”
“… that’s a way of saying it,” Steve laughed. Tony smiled, the captain was so natural with children.
“I thought you could use something to do while the kids were at school,” Steve scratched the back of his head, “why don’t you give this a try.”
“No, I think I will deal with this personally,” Rogers drawled, bored. Like he was taking out the trash.
“Fine, I’ll leave,” She put her knife back in it’s pouch, “but this is not the last time you’ll be seeing me.”
The next day, he felt a bit better, having slept and having food in him. Rogers wasn’t in bed when he woke up and Tony felt thankful the dom wasn’t there.
It took a little bit before Tony found the words to speak, “no… no, you have mistaken me for another guy.”
As he left the showers, dressed, and wandered into the breakfast area, he saw Banner sitting alone. He walked straight to the lone figure hunched over the food tray and smiled, “hey Bruce.”
“Ok, baby, hang onto me, I’m going to move,” Steve kissed Tony’s tear stained cheek as he pulled out slowly.
As the moon and sun moved apart, Tony realized that it would be at least another year before he was able to go back. If he’d live that long. He stood on shaky feet and explored his surroundings. There was a dark forest behind him and he shivered. He vowed to live long enough for the next eclipse. He vowed to destroy all those who sent him here to die.
“And Obadiah was in his 30s. He… was kind before our marriage. He would give me gifts. Spoil me in all the finest gifts he thought a sub would want. I didn’t want any of it, but my future was sealed. I had no choice,” Tony said quietly, “after I graduated from highschool, we wed immediately. He- sex- it was always painful. He didn’t care if I was interested or not. He just got what he wanted, whether it meant punishing me for small slights, chaining me up to the bed posts for days, naked, blindfolded, and crying. He didn’t care.”
Steve stepped up on stage, sweating profusely. He took the script and looked at it briefly. It was Hamlet.
Perhaps when Ransom returned, he would give a stern talk with his brother on how to keep his omega happy.
“Tony, I don’t want you to be a secret. I think it’ll do you some good to meet my friends, the team.”
The bastard sighed and said, “I’ll let you go to college. Not MIT but a college close to here. 4 years. 4 years and then you’ll come back to me, willingly, and be my husband.”
The first thing he saw was the blonde hair, a crown on top of a tall, impossibly well muscled man with a handsome face and bright blue eyes. Those cold eyes that sparkled with amusement as they watched Tony, his rabbit heart beating fast.
Rogers did the unthinkable. He sat down, pulling the other burlier dom onto his lap, took Hammer’s pants down and began spanking him. Rogers was spanking another dom. Right in front of everyone. For Tony. There was no mistaking it. This was for Tony.
“Tiberius- the prison guard seemed real interested in you. You could go plead to him,” The man said through a mouth full of suds.
“Good, baby, now use those colors if it gets too much,” Steve nipped against Tony’s neck, “what’s your color?”
Steve chewed his lower lip, tears glazing his eyes, but he did as Tony asked. This night wasn’t about Steve. It was all for Tony.
“Captain, there’s a reason why we decided to head into the Pacific in a sub aircraft,” Reed explained, “we were hoping to find your body to boost morale. We had no idea that you were still alive or we would have looked sooner.”
Tony would rarely join in their banter, but when he first saw Bruce, he recognized him, “you’re Bruce Banner.”
Tony smiled shyly and waved back. He didn’t get close to his neighbors; he just didn’t have the time. If he wasn’t working, he was taking care of Peter. As much as he wanted to know the hottie next door, he just didn’t have the time for pleasantries.
“There are things Greg isn’t telling us… and now Steve Rogers has taken an interest in you. Things are just not adding up,” the redhead said, “there’s something… about you.”
The customer, a well built man with sunglasses- who wore sunglasses indoors?- and bright blonde hair paused, staring at Tony, before walking over, never breaking eye contact. It was unnerving.
Tony startled out of his thoughts, blinking at the huge hulk of the Adonis. How could someone so large be so quiet?
“Hello,” a man stepped out from inside the door. The man was handsome wearing formal clothing, golden hair combed to the side. The man looked like a person right out of an old vintage photo down to his dark clothes, his hair style, and his white gloves. He looked at Tony with intense blue eyes, eyes that looked like the deep blue ocean and beyond, “I’ve been expecting you.”
“The Starks are owned by Hydra. They are Hydra’s lap dogs. They make weapons and technology for Hydra’s goons. Most of all, Anthony Stark, Howard’s son,” Reed explained.
“Why is this such a big deal, Tony, you knew that Professor Stone was never going to pick you. The bastard always favors Alphas over Omegas,” Rhodey sighed at his best friend’s antics.
He had joined the theatre club on his first day of freshman year, climbed the ranks, left a strong impression upon the theatre professor on his third year, and now, on his final year, on his last hurrah, his role was given to some alpha punk who walked into the room at the exact wrong time.
“I’ll take the utmost care of your family, Ransom,” Steve answered, holding a hand to his heart, “scouts honor.”
Steve stared at the weary grim people in the room, eyes wide and lost, “that’s- that’s not possible.”
And when Tony got back, Greg treated him no different. Greg wouldn’t listen when Tony talked about someone in the company selling weapons to terrorists. That was until Obadiah, Tony’s closest thing to a father, betrayed them. Greg became Iron Man and Tony…
“You didn’t actually punch back when you had the right to. I attacked you and your friend first and you didn’t fight me. You let me hit you. Either you are the stupidest alpha in existence- which I highly doubt, or you have strong morals. I respect that,” Rhodey said. He didn’t mention that he was kind of desperate as well to get Tony into a good relationship that could get him out of the contract with Obi. He didn’t think any Alpha would be ready for that kind of commitment before he actually fell in love with Tony. Besides, if this alpha was not what Rhodey thought of him as, he could always kick him to the curb.
“Hammer broke a cardinal rule,” Rogers said calmly, before meeting Tony’s eyes directly, “No one touches one of mine, for that, he will be punished.”
Tony could barely stand up, his legs were jelly, usual bright eyes, dull and shallow. It hurt Steve to see him like this. His bright, beautiful sub, reduced to this broken husk. Steve laid the sub down on his lap, bare ass in the air with cum still leaking out.
“Hmm,” the other dom, a man with scraggly dark long hair, said. This dom was the first to look directly at him today. It was nerve wracking.
He stood up, “that’s real cool of you, Steve Rogers. Making an omega cry. Did you get what you wanted?”
,” Tony said those famous lines in a powerful voice, and, by the gods, Steve was mesmerized. Tony looked strong, powerful in a way Steve had never seen an omega look strong or powerful. He was magnificent, magnetizing.
“Yeah… thank you,” Rogers wiped his face with his free hand but clasped Tony’s hand with his other and squeezed. Tony went beat red. He tried to hide his face in his second cup but Steve’s warm mirthful gaze told him he was not successful.
And here, Jarvis had to smile.  “James, you mustn’t look so shocked,” he said, patting the man’s elbow.  “I’m an 89 year old man.  Spry as I may be, what chance would I have had at getting the better of a brute like Obidiah Stane without some manner of chemical interference?”
There  was a certain sound that all soldiers learn by heart.  It was a jarring kind of ratcheting metal on metal sound that would put anybody with two good ears on edge, even if they hadn’t ever seen a slug of lead and copper blast a hole in a soldier and leave him bleeding in the dust.  It cut through the electric hum of the machine before him, and put every hair on Steve’s body on end.
"Old enough to know better now,"  Tony agreed, reaching up to trace callused, competent fingers through Steve's hair, from temple to nape.  "Young enough to do it anyway."  He tipped a nod at the sofa, which looked like it had probably come from Tony's college years too, and his smile went a little dirty again.  "So, you wanna make out right here, or...?"
One halfway intent Google search into the identity Howard's people had given him, and Steve knew his brief vacation would be over.  Bucky's new girlfriend and that archer fella would know for sure that Steve's airline ticket to London, train tickets to Boston and Cardiff, bus tickets to upstate, Chicago, and Florida, and car rental for Hollywood were red herrings.  (Assuming they'd been fooled by any of that in the first place -- a notion Steve was not taking for granted here.)  And then they'd be back to shadowing Steve's every damned move again, and privacy be damned.
"Wow,"  he whispered, eyes huge and shining in the gloom, arms slipping from their annoyed brace across his chest as he stepped up to the stair as if helplessly drawn by gravity.  "That's..." his hand drifted out as if he wanted to touch the candy-apple red exoskeleton, but didn't quite dare.  "So you can just... climb the stairs."
After the weekend was over, the kids were sent to elementary school. Without the children to buffer, Steve found the next couple of weekdays to be super awkward. He was a freelance artist who spent most of the time working at home, doing digital work and Tony was a stay at home omega, so they crossed paths more than once.
Alarm bells rang in Tony’s head. He heard horror stories about the going ons in prison showers. He tried to make himself small, saying, “I’m fine here.”
There was a brief moment of quiet where Tony just stood there, holding his rabbit heart, and just breathed.
When it first began, Tony nearly dropped his phone. He didn’t expect the supersoldier to call him after the disaster that was the meeting at the park (Tony knew better than to call it a date). But soon getting a call from Steve became second nature.
Steve, seeing that he had startled Tony, instantly furled his brows in concern, “Tony? You ok? Did I startle you?”
But there was one thing Tony had over Greg. Greg may be smart but Tony was an engineering genius. Gregory could see it. Howard could see it.
The next week, he scrounged up enough money to buy a Stark tablet. It wasn’t much, one of their older models, but it was as much as he could afford for the time being.
“You have to do something about your sub,” Bucky stared at Rogers with shrewd eyes, “everyone wants a taste of Stane.”
The customer, Steve, smiled, and it lit up his whole face, “gosh, I never thought I’d see you again. How have you been?”
“Anything for me,” Tony smiled softly, closing his eyes as Steve continued at a slower pace, fighting the urge to claim his lover. Tonight wasn’t about what Steve needed. That’s not what Tony needed. Tony needed him to show his love. And damn everything, Steve was going to give it to him.
It was one of the reasons Tony fell for Steve. The man was more concerned about Tony than getting what he wanted. Tony kissed Steve softly, a short kiss of gratitude, “I’m fine truly.”
“It’s me, it’s Bucky from high school, oh god it’s been a long ass time,” Bucky said smiling, and, at that handsome smile, Tony remembered instantly who it was. He felt his stomach turn inside out.
Tony pulled his chin out of the man’s grip. The man chuckled at Tony’s small act of defiance, “it’s your choice, Mr. Stane.”
Steve decided, if Greg wasn’t going to tell him, he’ll have to find this Tony on his own. It was fine, he worked better on his own anyway.
He tore through the first meal with the single minded focus that he’d usually give his machines. When he was done, he eyed the second meal forlornly.
“We have to be ten steps ahead of the Mandarin,” Natasha answered, “I was hoping to work out a plan with you…”
By the way, there were other baristas. Most of them were kind and encouraging, saying things like “you got this.” And “it’s alright, you’re doing a great job.”
He set it on the kitchen table wrapped in gaudy wrapping paper after the kids had gone to school. When Tony walked into the room, his eyes widened at the present, “what is that?”
Steve smiled and leaned forward, forgetting himself. Tony coughed, “I better put this in a safe place, away from the kids.”
“Tony,” The customer said huskily, and even though it had been years and he heard that tone from a much smaller figure, Tony instantly blushed dark.
When he felt his dom slid away from him, he was brought back to the present. Those cold eyes were watching him with an unreadable expression, “your relationship with your former dom…”
Steve smiled wolfishly, pouring the lube between his fingers and diving in. Tony tried to adjust, but he’d only known pain associated with sex, so he quickly stiffened up around the single finger inserted into his ass.
“Sorry for not introducing ourselves, you have to understand that we are in complete shock that we found you at all,” the red man stated, before laying a hand on his breast, “I’m Hank Pym.”
There were things happening behind the scenes, but Tony never paid attention to them. It wasn’t his business.
Tony hesitated, but Steve didn’t take it personally. He knew it would take time. And he was willing to wait their whole lives for it.
Steve let his hands slide lower, between Tony’s butt cheeks. Tony gasped, eyes wide as Steve touched his erect cock, pumped once, twice, before playing with his balls, then proceeding lower.
At the word, Steve’s eyes shot open. His vision was hazy, only able to discern red, gold, fluttering red, and strange grays. He blinked, quickly adjusting his sight to the strange visage before him.
After a while of baking and making pancakes for everyone including Tony, Steve excused himself to use the restroom. He didn’t really need it, he just wanted to check what was taking Tony so long. When he reached the bedroom and heard quiet sobbing, he realized why.
The dom shoved Tony into Roger’s chest. Rogers caught him with a careful grace. The dom smelled like freshly grounded coffee and safety. Tony wrinkled his face. Why?
“Careful, Steve,” a blonde short haired sub said as he joined the table, “heard he bit off the head of his last dom.”
“Really?” Peter said with much more enthusiasm than a sick child should have. When he realized, he coughed again, looking up at Tony with wide eyes, “really?”
“-I’m telling you, Rhodey bear! It’s complete bullshit! The alpha wasn’t even a part of the casting call! I checked!” Tony raised his hands to the sky.
Rogers turned around and leaned over Tony on the bed, “I like you, Tony. You are a beautiful sub, but I barely know you. I don’t bed strangers.”
Tony felt incredibly embarrassed, sitting next to Bucky in the small back room without saying anything.
It wasn’t like when he got accepted to MIT or the first time he built something for his father or when he told his brother of a new project he was making. It was a new kind of nervousness, the kind that meant trouble according to Greg.
It was an open and shut case, Tony was barely lucid through the whole thing. First degree murder. 72 years in state prison. It was a death sentence. Tony was fine with that.
After he put her to bed and read her story, he found Bucky hanging out by the balcony, and sighed, “Bucky I can-“
“This is not a game,” Greg picked up Tony’s phone from the side table and typed something into it, “here’s her number, I’ve arranged a meeting place at a nice coffee shop.”
“I’m… not a robot,” Iron man said, gesturing to his body, “There's actually a man under all this metal if you can believe it. For your other questions… We are the Avengers, the resistance against the Hydra government. There's a reason why we are dressed the way we are. It’s a distinctive choice, to show the public that we aren’t with Hydra.”
“Fucking seriously, Greg? When I agreed to be your shadow I didn’t agree to have you choose my future too!” Tony seethed.
Tony initiated a soft kiss and, when Steve reciprocated, it felt like fireworks, intoxicating, euphoric. Tony finally felt complete. He held Tony in his strong arms, pressing his tongue into Tony’s mouth. Tony closed his eyes, just relishing the feeling of Steve’s teeth on his lips, letting out a soft moan. Steve looked up at Tony through long lashes, hungry, “Tony…”
He didn’t remember much about his childhood other than the abstract feeling of neglect, but he remembered the day his father found he was an o. He was immediately sent to boarding school right after, as if the Stark elder was ashamed of keeping his omega child, his heir, in his own house.
Tony shivered, but he couldn’t look away. Rogers looked supreme, like a king carrying out his justice.
“Don’t know,” Steve mused, chin resting on Tony’s shoulder now, “Bring it here so I can check. Slowly,” he warned, even as Tony’s elbow wobbled with eager relief, “With control.  Be a shame for you to spill it and have to start over again now.”
They had spent that first night back in a New York hotel.  Anonymous and cramped, he would have called it once, but after six months of Afghanistan, he couldn't call it anything but luxury.  After Jarvis had gone to his own room to sleep off the jet lag, Tony had hauled himself out of bed, stripped his clothes off, and crawled to the full length mirror that made up the closet door.  There he’d looked at himself, thin and sallow in the unforgiving light, for a long time, and he’d told himself, over and over, that this was it.  This was how it was going to be now.
“I remember.  You were shouting at each other.”  Jarvis sighed and shook his head.  “Of course at that time Sir was shouting at just about everyone, and all the time.  He took his mother’s death rather hard, I’m afraid.”
That tore a groan out of Steve that Tony could feel in his balls, but then he sucked in a deep breath, swallowed hard, and met Tony’s eyes with a shakily determined stare.  “I’ll do my best.”
Steve drew in a trembling breath, hung on the choices spread out before him.  The rosy thrust of Tony’s cock, still gleaming from his kiss beckoned, but so did the tautly muscled abdomen, dusted with dark hair like that on his slender legs, and the spread of his chest and muscled shoulders gave testament to just how rarely Tony used the powered functions of his chair.  In the end, it was his hands that Steve reached for first, nimble and scarred, with fingernails chewed low, and tiny burns sprinkled across the knuckles like stars.
The tablet beside his lounger buzzed twice, not the gentle suggestion of a text or e mail, but the angry hornet rattle that dared you to ignore it and get stung for your neglect.  He was tempted anyway, until the second buzz came in the company of a not-so-distant car horn beeping.
It shouldn’t have been a revelation.  Tony had his own way of wrapping himself up in his genius like a suit of armor, and using it to buzz circles around anyone who wanted to get too close to the scars he'd rather the world didn't know about.  To blast holes in anybody who wouldn’t take the warning and back off.  He knew a thing or two about deflection, but... but there was something enormous about Steve doing it, some vast and secret thing Tony couldn’t, for  all his genius, get the shape of straight in his head.
There were a million savage questions in Steve's eyes, and Tony watched him sort through them all before landing on, "How long?"
something Tony expected to hear from a man who owned at least 3 custom made suits, but Tony let that slide.
“I know,”  Phil kept his tone friendly, but arid.  “It’s almost as if none of us know for sure what your remaining triggers are, and talking to you about what’s going on is the only way we have to know whether you’ve lost time again or not.”  The argument between them was so old and worn by now that neither of them could quite manage the sharply edged irritation, and now just let it slide into the realm of ‘weary fondness’.  It was easier, after all, and Phil got the sense that the occasional reality check was actually reassuring to Barnes, even after all these years.  He liked to know they weren’t being complacent with him.
"Yeah, no,"  Tony said into his ear as they both clung, panting a little at the sensation. "I've waited long enough.  You?"
But gravely earnest, Steve shook off both the compliment and the teasing tone.  “I spend all day, every damned day, around people who want me for what I have, or what I can do for them, or who are there only because they’re following orders,” he said.  “I can be as friendly to them as I know how, but at the end of the day, they’re still -- all of them are still after the dancing monkey in the expensive suit.  That’s...” he shook his head, and set his hair to rights with one swipe of his hand.  “It gets pretty lonely, living like that.”
He leaned in and dropped a kiss on her nose -- or rather he leaned in and smooched the air when she evaded him, but it had the intended effect of cutting off her threat regardless.  “It isn’t,”  he told her, “Rogers didn’t have to come back here at all.  He coulda left Flowers outside the Manhattan office with a bow on her ass, but it’s just like you called it --” and here, he boosted the plate of bagels in his hand by way of proof.  “His point’s been made.  Now you get to figure out what the fuck Flowers’ deal is, while I debrief the Raccoon Whisperer.  And when Barnes turns up, we get to finally find out what happens when those two relics actually
"I've stepped in worse overseas," Steve shrugged, tucking his hands into the pockets of his bomber jacket with a grin that hid almost enough to be taken at face value.  But now Tony knew better, and the knowing wasn't all that helpful, when taken against the mysteries of this quiet, towering man.
, and-”  He stopped abruptly, but only because Tony’s fingers were on his lips again, and if he didn’t, they were gonna be in his mouth.
“You did?” Rogers grinned as Clint clambered along an I beam so he could drop to the workshop level at the base of the stairs.  “That’s great.  Would you arrange a meeting with her for me?  Casual setting if possible.  Yes, I know she’s a journalist, that’s kind of why I want to talk to her.  Well, from what I can see Everhardt was the only one actually doing any digging at all at the time, and I think she might know some more beyond what she was allowed to put in her stories.”
Natasha turned her frozen bag to the colder side until the door shut again.  Then she fixed Nick with an unrepentant stare and said, "Yasha told you Steve would not like the protection detail."
And after that, it was all a matter of hanging on for dear life while Steve Yes-Really-Named-After-Grandpa Rogers proceeded to pound Tony like he meant to drive him through to the ground floor.  It was staggering, it was terrifying, and Tony thrilled with every second of it, adrenaline and lust singing in his veins, making him feel more whole, more vibrantly alive than he’d felt for years.  Heart racing, lungs straining, every muscle, every nerve in his body focused on meeting that strength, pacing that speed, opening himself to the potent memory of how goddamned good it could feel to let someone give him this.  Steve was a relentless force of nature above, around, inside him, keening a high, tight whine in his throat as he fought to control himself with every potent stroke.
uncover Hydra once Madame was gone.  He might have been your staunchest ally...”  He sighed then, suddenly chilled with a familiar old futility, and said, “You’re beyond regretting that now, though.”
To his own surprise, (and, he suspected, to Steve's surprise as well) he didn't even try particularly hard, beyond the offhand invitation they both seemed to expect once Karl shouted for last call, and they both realized they'd been talking all night.  Steve shrugged it off with a bashfulness that Tony found somehow more charming than the gracious retreats he'd seen the man give other would be suitors before.
They rode in silence for awhile, the radio silent as a compromise between Barnes’ love of modern pop music and his suspicious resistance to indulging Phil’s love of vintage swing.  That had caused more than one fight between agent and handler before Barnes began to believe that Phil wasn’t trying to trigger Bucky memories with his choice of music, he just genuinely liked the stuff.
“I’d forgotten how good this can feel, you know?”  Steve said, glancing up from his contemplation at last.  “Not waking up alone.  I know last night wasn’t some kind of a favor you did for me or anything, and people say it’s rude to thank someone after sex, but I’m... I’m really, really grateful, Tony.”
"Then..."  Steve licked his lips, swallowed against the sudden desert in his throat, settled his palms to his thighs, and tried again.  "Then why-"
Tony belted a laugh and pushed Steve away by his looming, leering face.  “Okay, okay, that’s enough of that, American Psycho.”  In the bedroom, Tony’s alarm began to softly beep, and Tony gave up a sigh as he disentangled himself and reached for his wheelchair.  “Welp, that’s my half hour warning.  If Jarvis doesn’t hear my shower running within the next fifteen minutes, he’s gonna come up here with a gallon of tea, a stack of dry toast, and a mustard poultice, and I guarantee neither of us wants to deal with that, so if you’ve got another question, you’d better ask it while we get dressed.”
Smart Car down there?”  Steve asked as if he hadn’t heard her.  “The teal one, with the Sanskrit on the hood?”
Phil just took out his phone, opened the gallery, and began to scroll.  He’d found the shot he wanted by the time the bartender wandered close and asked, “What’ll you have, boys?”
Steve made a quizzical sound in his throat, even as he tilted to accommodate Tony's deeper kiss.  His eyes peeked open, and Tony saw a glint of concern in the glitter of blue.  "Your hands are shaking,"  Steve whispered, lips brushing damply against Tony's own once Tony let him speak.  And yes, they were, even cupped warm and wide against the curve of Steve's belly, Tony could feel that hair-trigger quiver in the bones of every finger.
"Mr. Tony, you need anything else?  We gotta close now,” Somboon said, adding, "It's Sunday," when he saw Tony frown and check his watch.
“Do I get to finish you off this time?”  Steve dared, even as he let Tony steer him down by the hair.  The stubborn challenge in those lips made Tony’s eager cock lurch, even as his own face spread around the joy of rising to it.
The blush heightened, Steve's eyes fluttered briefly closed as he shivered and sucked in a breath past damp, soft lips. “I’m just a kid from Brooklyn,” he said
James shook his head, wiping surreptitiously at his eyes.  “I thought him kicking his Daddy’s weapon’s business to the curb would keep him out of the fight, but it almost cost him everything, because he might have been right to push his dad and Stane away.  And now... Now I can’t help thinking how
It was a culmination of the worst ideas Tony’d ever had, really.  This was worse than all the spite-blowjobs he’d performed to get thrown out of private schools (four of those, plus one hand in the pants incident with someone who’d definitely been old enough to know better,) and it was worse than that time he hotwired the headmaster’s car so he could sneak out to a party on the college campus, and gotten his first hit of cocaine off the titties of a sorority girl who definitely hadn’t believed him when he’d said he was 18, but hasn’t seemed to care at the time.  Hell, it was even worse than that time he’d insulted the math teacher’s basic algebra in front of the whole class once he’d finally washed out into public school.
Tony shook his head, but didn't stop staring at the driver's license for which Steve had neither tested, nor paid, as if he could spot the forgery.  "No, honey, no.  I just can't decide whether your parents were the biggest nerds ever, or completely sadistic, naming a kid who looked like you after Captain America."  At last he tore his gaze away, and reached out to push Steve's wallet down so he could get a hand into Steve's hair again.  "It must've been hell for you in gym class," he purred, scratching as if Steve was a giant cat, and he meant to get a purr out of him.
Fury did that thing where he stared at you and waited for you to get the jitters, but Rogers didn’t seem like he was sweating at all, and finally, it was Fury who blinked.  “The last thing I need is a loose cannon in my executive crew,”  he growled.
The pair eyed him for a long moment of silence, then Natasha stole the carafe from Barton and slugged back a long drink, while Barton leaned back in his chair and gave Nick the disingenuous stare he'd come to dread.  It meant the archer was
Steve easily fended Tony off though, and managed a shorts-snap of his own in retaliation.  “I admit no such thing.  But you’d better share pictures if you put it on when I’m not around!”  Things devolved into a gently flirty roughhousing for awhile, dying down into cuddling again once both of them were giggling too hard to continue.
“On here, I assume,” he replied, passing over a palm sized data-stick.  It had a SHIELD logo engraved into the case, which Phil supposed would turn out to be a helpful red herring just in case the shop owner did turn out to be connected.  “The laptop in the back office was on, so I just cloned the whole thing from the OS down.”
"Then this is what we'll do,"  Tony smiled, loosing his grip so he could pull himself up to sit against the headboard.  "We'll take it easy this time," and no, Tony did not miss that pleased flicker of a glance at the implication of a next time, thank you.  "I'll tell you what I want.  If you like it, then we'll do it.  If you're not sure, we'll try it, and you'll let me know, and if you don't like it, you tell me no, and we'll do something else."
Fury just let that mean smile of his.  “Howard told me he had cleaners gather up all of his belongings and photographs after Maria died and Tony moved out,” he said, continuing his climb to the garage.  “I figure most of it should still be up there now, waiting for you to get started.”
The man pretended to think, one finger tapping at his bearded chin.  “Mmm, no,” he decided.  “The drinks are for sale, and the Downstairs club memberships are for sale, and that’s it.  But you can’t blame a guy for trying to make a profit before he throws you two suspicious characters outta his bar.”
That caught Tony up a little bit, but he clamped down on the urge to deflect and really made himself look at Steve, to comb that handsome face for any sign of pity or condescension.  As if aware of his misstep, Steve chinned up to the examination and said, “I know people who’ve been through loss like yours,” he said, and Tony couldn’t help remembering last night’s stories about Steve's buddy James.  “It’s not a contest or anything, I know that.  Every survivor is different, and they do what they’ve gotta to get through the bad spots, but you... you seem happy.  Or like you want to be happy, and you’re working toward it, and that,” he shrugged.  “That gives me hope, I guess.”
Tony felt his smile tug downward a little.  “What, because I survived?” he asked, curling a hand over his bad knee.
It was almost as weird as the way the aching muscles, shaking limbs, and burning humiliation that made him utterly, ferociously useless in the Gym class he’d insisted on taking, led to him being utterly, ferociously, helplessly aroused when it was this intensely gorgeous asshole dishing it out in a private session.  Tony wasn’t going to think about that though, because the unbuttoned collar of Steve’s cheap cotton shirt was pressing tight against his naked back, and he could feel the bobbing ridge of Steve’s throat against his shoulder as the cup tilted, and the tea drained away.
Clint grimaced, trying not to imagine everything that could go wrong with letting Steve Rogers talk to a reporter about anything at all, let alone a bulldog like Everhardt.  But while that might be arguably his monkey if, say, Everhardt were to try and kill him during the interview, it definitely was NOT his circus.  The Ringmaster himself was coming down the stairs, leather coat flapping like bat wings, and hell to pay in his eye.  Barnes was three steps behind Fury, sniperface firmly in place, but cracking just a bit around the eyes to show a simmering combination of anger and relief.
Instead, he took a deep breath, and pasted on a smile that felt like it was in the neighborhood of genuine.  "Well, I might've been raised by assholes in the wild," he admitted.  "And in periods of stress, I've been known to revert a bit.  Sometimes I even bite."
Steve swallowed, and held that stare while he shifted his weight and pulled the other leg of his jeans off.  He hadn’t bought underwear when he’d stopped at the little vintage store for these clothes, and he’d known better than to assume anything at all that White Star had given him was free of trackers, so now his cock stood high and proud against his belly, defiant to the sense of nervy, defiant exposure Steve was weathering in every other inch of his skin.  But then again, the damned thing always had had a mind of its own, and no damned sense of decorum.
He let that idle notion occupy his mind as he ran -- not full out, he wasn’t as reckless as all that, after all -- but hard enough and long enough to keep his blood up and his skin warm as he put the miles and the Village behind him.  He considered, as he went, just what kind of effort it might take if he were to decide to make this trip by way of rooftops alone.  He’d certainly be able to make the jumps at most side streets, and probably at a few of the major intersections as well, if he judged his run-up right.  And too, if he tried it at night, and wore black tac gear, he might actually not be noticed while he was at it.  Not that his life held much call for that kind of rowdiness these days, but there was only so many times a fella could run around Central Park without the serum in his veins begging for a little adventure.
"What's that?"  Tony asked, voice low and furtive as he pushed back the door and let light spill out of the apartment behind it.
"Do you normally hang around with assholes, or have I somehow given you reason to think I'm one of them?"  Steve bit back, but he didn't let Tony's hand go.  "It sounds like a terrible experience, and a lot of pain, and no, I don't pity you for it, but I'm sorry you had to go through it, okay?"
"I live upstairs from the damn Center, Steve!"  Tony realized he was shouting at the phone and stopped.  "Which... you probably didn't realize."  He hadn't
Bucky paused, one knee on the bed as Natalia pushed past him and grabbed a double handful of Clint’s blanket pile.  “Why would he do that?  Steve’s hardly set foot in Stark Industries since the will was read.  I thought Arbrogast and May were handling things over there.”
Steve’s eyes shivered closed for a second, but then he pushed back, drawing his length out of Tony’s body, leaving an eager emptiness behind.  Almost pulled clear, he stopped, licked his lips and asked, “How hard?”
As he’d expected, she kicked out at him, her sharp little kitten heels dragging sharply along his inner thigh as he fended her away from his crotch.  She was on her feet in a flash, and scrambling for the fallen gun, but Steve lunged out, caught her by the ankle, and then watched with chagrin as her resulting tumble wound up with her diving headlong into the building’s heat exchanger with a clang.  This time, she didn’t get back up, and didn’t stir when he rifled her pocket for her keys, or even when he picked her up and slung her over his shoulder like an extra duffle bag.
He leaned in close, hands curled between the cool enameled steel and the warm, slightly damp skin of Tony's hips, and savored the velvety slide of that cock along his cheek as he pressed his nose to the crease of Tony's hip and just breathed the man in.  He felt the prickle of coarse, trimmed hair against his cheek, the slight burn of salt against his lips as he breathed the other man's scent deep, deep into his lungs.  The tension melted from his jaw, his neck, his shoulders as the musky, hungry smell of Tony's arousal rolled over Steve's tongue -- he could feel it bleed from his mouth on the gust of his groaning sigh as he pressed an open mouthed kiss to that smooth olive skin.
“You still have eighteen months to contest the will,” she protested, frustrated and angry, despite her intention not to be.  “I was at the reading, and it said explicitly that if Tony Stark showed up to contest within three years of Howard’s death, the entire estate would revert to-”
"Well," Tony temporized, waving at Karl to draw attention to the fact that his drink was now empty, and Mr. Thursday didn't even have one, "For one thing, the fact that he died in the 40's could lead to some conjecture as to what a wholesome boy from Brooklyn might think about a bunch of men drinking, carousing, and making time in a public house in the middle of Greenwich Village."
The man tsked, and shook his head.  “Now honey, how long d’you think I’d stay open if I tattled on my people like that?”
“So we need to go looking for Stark’s son,”  Rogers went on, nodding to Clint’s point.  “Even if he is dead, and we just recover his body, we need to be sure, because this,”  he tapped the opened folder, “is an Achilles’ heel we really can’t afford to overlook.”
"Not until I've earned it,"  Tony answered, twisting in his chair to grab his phone out of the bag hanging off the back.  "Now come on -- digits."
“So why did he leave himself a note to call her?”  Rogers summed it all up with a knowing glance around the room.
And Steve... well, he wasn't ready to throw in that towel yet.  White Star Security might need him to be their public face now that Howard was dead and Peggy's health was too shaky to do the job, and maybe Steve owed it to them, given that White Star people had saved Bucky from Hydra and Steve from the ice, but by damn, he was gonna do it on
Natalia said, leaning close again after a long minute.  James didn’t answer.  It was true, he suspected, but then again the same was probably true of all of them, together or apart.  Who but fools would take on a secret war against enemies who had proven they’d stop at nothing, flinch from no crime, scruple no cost in their agenda?  All soldiers were fools, at the core of things, but they were fools on which the world relied sometimes.
“Still unaccounted for, we’re okay.” James’ voice was all comfort, and Jarvis did not scruple to take it.  “Army CID tested the vehicle for blood spatter once they brought it back to Kabul, which as you know, they found plenty.”
Tony thought, licking open the soft seam of Steve's lips as he slid both hands into the warm welter of Steve's jacket to feel the eager breadth of muscle beneath it.
He couldn’t help the groan that rattled out of him then, couldn’t even feel embarrasment at how ragged and needy it sounded.  Steve pulled free the two fingers he’d had in his mouth, and gulped a breath of air before he could manage to nod.  This was always going to happen, needing to show Erskine’s work, hear the praise and admiration, and pretend to accept it for himself -- anyone he ever went with now saw the same thing, and nothing Steve could do would make it different.
“If you spill it, we start over.”  A warning more pointed this time. The pencil’s scratching stilled, and God, but Rogers was hot when he glared like that!
Steve wonders if this is what the real Tony Stark is like, the one who isn't in the newspapers and on the television.
"Don't be like that," Tony said, and smacked him helpfully on the ass again just to make him gasp. "There are more good things in store.
--and he was very, very surprised when two men he hadn't seen came from behind and shoved him over the railing.
It's what everyone else in this line wants; it shouldn't be a surprise. She hesitates for a fraction of a second before she passes the form over. Steve can imagine her deciding which of her friends to text with the news:
He blinked, shook his head, and realized that Carol was going to collide with him fists-first in the next three seconds, oh,
It did, actually. Steve breathed out, shakily. Sure, it still stung a little, thinking about how Tony hadn't trusted him. But he knew how easily Tony would believe the worst of himself. And it was easy to see how he'd dismiss Steve's attempts to tell him otherwise.
So Tony switched back to speakers, started ramping up the repulsors to combat-ready status, and stepped around the last of the obstacles, bringing Baron Mordo into view at last.
"I'm okay." The words sting at Steve's throat. "I'm just-- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I honestly thought you were going to-- I mean. You know. You know what I thought. I'm so sorry."
"Yeah," Steve said, despondent, desperate. "Yeah, I actually am going to tell you it's different. I know I've hurt you. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry, with all of my heart, that I've ever,
Steve carried him over a little rise and there was the Quincarrier, just sitting right there. "Just me," Steve said, "and you're in Madripoor."
"You're here at my apartment," Steve said, desperate, because if he could just find the right words, the right thing to say, the thing Tony would believe-- "You're here, and Tiberius has never been here. He doesn't know what it looks like, or-- or where it is--"
The fluorescents overhead were uniformly dim, with several of them flickering alarmingly, and several more going dark as the team passed them. Tony had the unnerving feeling of being in the cast of a horror movie, a feeling that was definitely not helped by the number of displays that were knocked over and otherwise in disarray. The evacuation had definitely not been orderly.
"And here I am in your room," Tony said, with another smile. "Different room, but still yours. It just took me a little longer than that. Got lost on the way." He reached out, fingers not quite encircling Steve's cock. "Can I...?"
He turned his head to see Tony nod, light glinting off his visor, and then Tony finally let go, got his feet on the ground, and slid off the bike. Steve reached back and grabbed the trenchcoat from one of the panniers, because he liked to believe that his neighbors didn't know he was Captain America. He hopped off the bike, pulled on the coat, and considered Tony.
"Blech ugh mmf," Tony said, and he would have spat but it probably wasn't the best idea in a cockpit.
How did it keep getting worse? It shouldn't have been possible for it to get worse. But Steve had thought that when he'd pulled Tony out of DreamVision, and it looked like the universe really enjoyed proving him wrong.
He just needed some time alone. Time to clear his head. He'd be better. He'd get better soon. He had to.
Of course, now that meant that Steve had to amuse himself until Tony was finished with talking to Tiberius. He glanced around the room as the crowd began to disperse back into their previous little knots of conversation. And it turned out he didn't have long to wait, because it wasn't more than thirty seconds after that when Hank caught sight of him and waved him over.
"No," Steve said, frowning. "Well, maybe. It's just that Happy Hogan drove both of us here, but it doesn't look like Tony's ready to leave yet."
Okay, so he's not exactly noble, but touch is a two-way street -- if no one's touched Iron Man, then Iron Man hasn't touched anyone either.
Steve was starting to get a very clear picture of how Tony's relationship with Tiberius had gone. He didn't like it at all.
Steve crouched down on his bike, weaving through the traffic at a speed that most people would have called extremely ill-advised. It wasn't one of the safer things he'd ever done. He passed a sedan on the left, swinging out into what were thankfully entirely empty parking places at this time of night, and he opened the throttle as the driver started yelling about
And that was the other thing about Steve: he didn't know. He had no idea that Tony was the man under the armor.
Quickly, he rolled off Steve, but he didn't go far -- he just pressed himself up against Steve's side and then he reached out and cradled Steve's face with both hands, as if he could impart the strength and fierceness of his opinion by touch alone.
He thought he had a good guess. A couple of good guesses. "This is going to sound terrible," Steve said, "but I honestly don't know if you mean Kathy Dare or Madame Masque."
"At last," Stone agreed, and then all at once he swept Tony up in a hug, moving too fast for Steve to catch more than a blur of blond hair and an expensive suit. "It's been so long, Antony."
"Captain," Walders said, standing up to shake his hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you. Glad you were able to join us on the program."
Steve remembered what Tiberius had said about Tony's father. Did Tony think Steve would think less of him because his father had hurt him?
He needed to figure out what to do about his little feelings problem. He needed to snap out of it. He'd figure it all out later. He was sure there was a right answer. He just hadn't found it yet.
But Mr. Stark evades the question once again. "This isn't what it looks like," he says. There's a small, enigmatic smile on his lips, and his eyes are too reflective, bright with unshed tears. He really is about to cry, and this doesn't make any sense. "None of this is what it looks like."
given Tiberius up. He was going down, and that didn't even count the murders that Tony knew about. He was definitely going down.
Tony was still looking at him, with a now-familiar focus in his gaze, the kind of look he usually gave to his engineering projects; Tony was looking at him like he could look at him for hours and never grow tired.
. I think he must have told me that. It sounds like something he might have told me. But I don't think that was what really happened." Tony was clear, self-possessed. He sounded like he was giving testimony. Witness for the prosecution. "
Before Tony could even begin to process that, an unexpected and very familiar voice from behind him made Tony startle hard.
Mr. Stark still isn't saying anything. His mouth is hanging open, his eyebrows raised; he's making abortive attempts at speech, but nothing is emerging. Eventually his lips press together and open again, shaping the silent word:
Tony was now sitting up, perched on the closer edge of the bed, next to where Steve had been sitting. His gaze went to Steve's hand, seeing the book, and he frowned. He didn't know what Steve was planning, then. Maybe that was bad, if he hadn't guessed; he needed to believe the theory of it for this to work.
Yes, that was exactly what Steve wanted to accuse him of. But he had no proof, and now he couldn't say it without sounding like a lunatic. Steve breathed out hard, his nostrils flaring, and he kept his mouth shut.
He reaches up. His fingers slide across his jawline, pressing into notches at the base of his helmet. Metal clicks and unlocks, and it's then that Steve realizes what's happening, as Iron Man lifts the helmet away.
Tony's lips were parted, still incredulous. "I thought you were humoring me and my nerdy hobbies. Being polite. I always thought you were--" He shook his head in amazement. "God, Steve, how long ago was that? Years? You've been in love with me for
Tony just grinned back, like Steve had told him the world's best secret. "I'll look forward to that, then."
"None of that matters to me," Steve told him. He knew that wasn't going to convince Tony. "You're talking about my love life like there's some objectively perfect person out there in the universe, and that's the person I deserve, the person I should want. Someone who's beloved by everyone, who never cries, who's never made mistakes. I don't think that person exists. And even if they did exist, you know what? I still wouldn't pick them, because they wouldn't be you." He rubbed his thumb over the back of Tony's hand. "I'm glad you have feelings. I don't care about the state of your public image, but I'm happy to keep telling the world you're amazing, because you are. And I don't care whose bed you were in last night. You're in mine now. And if you want to be here, that's enough for me. More than enough. That's perfect, actually. That's what's perfect."
Iron Man blinks at him, his eyes sparkling sapphire as the lamplight catches them, and he hums for a second, a startlingly clear and pure tone, like he's thinking. "So," he prompts. "Something you wanted to tell me in private, Winghead?"
