Hurt Sherlock? He mulled that over and over in his head on his walk home.
Harry--so bloody practical, he thought bitterly. More practical to avoid an overdose, Harry. What in the bloody hell were you doing?
has brought you to my door, Sherlock?" He asked, actually looking concerned.
Luckily for the university, he didn’t have anything more on his mind besides dropping off a term paper.
The party had quickly taken a down note and broke up. The flat was empty. The three of them walked carefully down the steps, Mike supported by Sherlock and John on either side.
I tell him so. He blushes and looks surprised.
John was thankful for the tea and biscuits, remembering he had no supper. He poured a cup for Sherlock but he didn't touch it, seeming to be asleep.  John followed Mrs. Hudson to the door.
Still no Sherlock.
She blushed.
The rest of Fresher's Week was a bust. The club got shut down and sighted for
The red pen the only one he could find in this messy flat, apparently not indicative of anything but expedience.
There wasn’t much between them now except for the Cludeo board and the stack of books.
That....was the most annoying git you’ll ever meet. Well, that I've ever met, anyway. That….was my brother.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Crossing the room to the window, he saw a shadow out of the corner of his eye and jumped and turned. Heart hammering in his chest, he realized that there was a small person--a kid-- in the room. John was shocked, outraged and mortified. 'Jesus Christ!' he said, "Who the hell are you and how did you get in here?"
It's easy to lose your bearings in a place like this.
John suddenly finds himself on the front stoop of the Holmes family estate in Devon. John has been here many times before.  Although, after 10 years of being made to feel just as much a part of this family as his own, there are times, right in the middle of it all, when he still has to pinch himself to make certain he is awake.
So....here is indisputable evidence that the drugs were not done."
I didn't meet Sherlock's brother until the meeting. We had a phone conversation the night before and the last thing I want is to feel like his employee, but I do. Even over the phone he sounded intimidating.
“‘’Night.” The boys said.
John interrupted. “I was worried about you. I waited all day. You didn’t even call.”
I did get a hold of myself--briefly--head clear enough to remove my own shirt. I carefully folded it and lay it over my coat, front pocket facing up.  Gravity is a friend to me and the little white envelope. John took my hand and led me over to his bed.
"It's funny," Jim remarks, as he separates the coke into four neat lines on the mirror. "How you and I have never connected before." he snorts two lines and I watch him, but I don't move at all.
Sherlock took it all in, quiet, thinking. He slouched in his uncomfortable hospital chair, staring, eyes unfocused. Periodically, he'd give me a sidelong glance, under his lashes.
"I'd like  chance to explain." He continued softly, lowering the poker.
"My God John, really..." he whipped around to look at his neck in the mirror on the wall and sighed. "I'll just button my shirt."
John Watson dragged his suitcase out of the Tube car. He negotiates several passageways, dogging commuters on his way to the stairway and out to the rainy slick street. Traffic looked terrible when John emerged from Russel Square Station. Taking a deep breath, mostly of car exhaust, he felt a flutter of hope in his chest. He was so glad to be back in London.
Everyone stared at me.
John took a step closer to Sherlock, “Will you give it to me?”
“John--your only about 1 ½ years older than me, you’re a kid too, really.”
But Sherlock was. “Git.” he said.
"To be perfectly honest, I wanted to. Jim had cocaine with him--he always does." Sherlock clenched his jaw.
Sherlock turned from the window and looking around on the floor, scooped something up and put it in his pocket, carefully using a pocket handkerchief to avoid touching it with his hands.
"I don't like curry." I said hurriedly. John glanced at me out of the corner of his eye.
Won't be here long. Have to get back to school, eventually.
From the sands of Afghanistan to the frigid UK winter, John looks upon another scene.
Sherlock kneels down to peer at the body.
“I'm taking you to your room.”
“I have no idea what you are talking about.” Sherlock stood intentionally in front of his coat, arms crossed in front of him.
he gritted through his teeth. "What's it to ya?"
“Good…. thanks.” John sighed grabbed the duvet from the floor and pulled it over both of them as he lay back down. Soon, he could hear Sherlock breathing evenly. John wondered if he was truly sleeping or just lying there, pissed off at him.
"This
More buttons.
Harry was delighted to open the package. Inside she found a new doll, the one she wanted, advertised on the telly. John knew his father had purchased it weeks before, but somehow wrapping it (or putting it under the tree) did not become a priority.
When I arrived back at school, the rumors flew. half truths. I had murdered someone, I was instrumental in an international bombing, had helped someone escape prison. I had robbed a bank. And Victor did not come back so...no one would talk to me. Not quite a burden, that.
the bloke from the A & E. What's he doing here?"
John stopped at the door, going no further, his back pressed up against it.
But his thoughts then turn sour, he knows what night this is. This is the night before he gets shot.
"Oohh no," he said shaking his head and smirking. He took a few steps closer to me. "John's much too violent for me. I just had my teeth fixed, want to see?" he was right in front of me, mouth open, pointing at his teeth.
It was the worst time to have a blow out fight, but that's just what happened.
"What's wrong with you?" John finally asked.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
John asked, noting the white shirt, dark jacket and striped tie that his companion wore, so different from the stained hoodie and trainers.
"Can you help or not? If not, please leave." Sherlock turned over on the sofa groaning and turned his back to the room.
He dreaded turning around, but as he trudged along with his head down against the rain, he realized he was fighting a losing battle against the elements.
and as I try exceedingly hard to avoid spending time with my brother--we're headed to John's first."
“….to ruin it. Because I’m happy.” Things were quiet for a minute or two. Sherlock thought John fell asleep, but he continued, “I’m happy here with you…and I love…being with you.”
And we stood there, the both of us in the middle of my bedroom, right next to my large bed, where just the night before, we had spent hours...together, duvet and sheets still rumpled.
I lay back down and fell asleep, no classes tomorrow, or today.
After that I had to head back to my school, I didn't need to get picked up again by the police.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
People walked in and out of my room all the time--Molly, Mary, Mike.  I had more traffic than the library. It didn't bother me, but it bothered him. He said it distracted him and he couldn't concentrate with them in the room.
But those thoughts disappeared as his right hand dipped to Sherlock's neck, then to open the top button of his shirt. His left hand wandered upwards and buried itself in Sherlock's hair, puling him closer. His fingers eagerly found the next button, and a small moan escaped his lips when his hand wandered inside Sherlock's button down and found a firm chest and he rubbed his warm palm over an erect nipple.
“I’m going to my room,,,” John turned and looked at Sherlock, pointedly,
John, on the phone with Lestrade, sits down on the bed, shocked look on his face. Jim Moriarty dropped all the changes against him.
I never saw Victor again.
“I’m leaving.” Sherlock announced abruptly, turning on his heel.
Which was actually a good idea, because I was still wearing John's track pants.
Sherlock gave John a good laugh--implying that he was holding onto an important piece of evidence because Scotland  Yard would 'muck up' an investigation.
“It’s ok, mum.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I had placed the envelope back in my pocket before John opened the door. Jumped anyway.
"Johnny! Thanks for finding my present!" she said, happiness back in her voice. "But what about yours?" she asked, concerned he had no present to open on Christmas day.
“Is that a promise?”
Jim patted the pocket of Sherlock’s coat, as if to settle what he had placed. And then it hit John like a bolt. The small paper envelope. Sherlock out all night, coming in at all hours. Wasted, quiet, distant—eyes glazed over.
Sherlock.
I finally snapped at him. The cream burned.
They arrived back at the flat and realized Mike was not home. John flopped on to the sofa and laid there with his eyes closed.
I can't stay though, I really have to go.
There are probably one thousand reasons not to live with Sherlock.
Holding John around the back with his left arm and kissing him deeply, the deft fingers of Sherlock's right hand made their way to the top of John's waistband, rapidly working his leather belt open and easily getting his zip undone.
I spent the next 20 minutes pulling him up to a sitting position, talking to him, shouting at him. He looked a little better, but not much. He opened his eyes and looked at me. "John? What are you doing in my dream?"
"John? Thought you were my brother."
John hung up the phone. There were too many questions and too little time. Of course he was off to hospital to find out what happened to his sister. And if she was still alive.
"Hello John, think you'll have time to make it to football practice this morning?" Mike asked cheerfully.
Sherlock walked around the office and examined the body, occasionally giving an "Oh!" under his breath.
I can't help seeing things, I see loads of things others just don't see. I hate to admit it, but alcohol helps me calm down. Alcohol and other things.
John let himself be dragged through the loud, misty party. Terrified to open his eyes, he was aware that there were people on all sides of him dancing. They ended up at the loo. Sherlock pushed him inside the tiny WC and closed the door. The lights were blinding. John could just stand there and shield his eyes.
He gently cradles Sherlock's face and kisses him gently. Sherlock turns towards him, shifting in the bed until they are chest to chest and leans in to kiss him. Sherlock reaches under the sheet and runs his hand down John's back to cup his arse. John gives a small gasp against Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock thinks that Jim is out to get me somehow and that he'll use the dropping of the charges as a distraction. I'll relax, forget about it--then out of nowhere he'll get back at me.
John, sitting on the stoop in front of their building.
Sherlock stood up, wavering on his feet eyes half closed. He had gotten most of his shirt off, but the right sleeve cuff was still buttoned and the shirt, at this point, was inside out and laying half on the floor.
John sighed and shook his head, “You know Sherlock, I never have fun. Like this….” He pointed between them.  “…with Mary.  I have fun with you.”
"Mike, you didn't have to come, you know?"" John was squinting in the sunlight, at the numbers on the row houses, some torn off and hanging.
"Ow!" Sherlock hissed.
“Yes.” Sherlock sounded awake now and more than slightly irritated.
“Well, why not me?” Mycroft tone is still soft, reassuring, trying for familiarity, John thinks.
"Now Watson!! Down the pub!!" they started to turn him around by the shoulders and usher him back to the door.
Walking round back near the bins and pushing the flat head against the strike plate, Sherlock popped the door open. Not even a squeak. So easy it was laughable. Child’s play.
Mary whispered.
Sherlock headed gracefully to the bar, dropping his empty glass at one end and asking the bartender for a new drink at the other.
John became very hot. He could feel the flush starting at the edge of his neck right under his collar. He started to sweat.
The meeting was tedious. Me, John, Lestrade, the headmaster of my school, and my favorite person in the world, Mycroft, were in attendance. I do realize that it's mostly because of Mycroft that I am afforded these concessions.
Mary was smiling and shouting something in my ear. I nodded at her but didn't know what she said. I think she went to get drinks. They were free now that we were in the place.
I couldn't remember his name, the only person who did was Molly but no one else knew who
I glanced over to him, my voice cracking now, strained.
Halfway into my pint, the pub got even more crowded, if that was possible. There were more people standing, milling about. I looked toward the door, more people coming in.
John loved to socialize, some thing he knew Sherlock was not  necessarily interested in. He met loads of people through Mary and was invited to loads of parties. John was having the time of his life. They went out to dinner in a large group, they went dancing, to pubs and clubs.
"Oh god!! My parents!!" John jumped up. "I forgot to call them!" he looked panicked.
"It's ok, John. Love sucks, innit?" he pats him on the back and laughs.
At the top of the stairwell John realized he could not continue the chase. No matter how incensed he was at this person, they were long gone.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
A small paper origami envelope, slightly bigger than a postage stamp, folded out a glossy fashion magazine. John’s heart stopped and he got a cold icy feeling in the pit of his stomach. It was shockingly familiar in his hand.  He knew exactly where he’d seen one of those before.
~~~FIN~~~
N. Gower St.
That might be one way I could help.
"If you'd hold still, I don't think it'd be as bad, Sherlock." he said calmly.
"That you
I looked over again, I couldn't help it. Sherlock looked my way, taking a sip out of his beer bottle. As I watched him, he looked right into my eyes and slipped the tip of his tongue into the the mouth of the bottle. I went red and looked away quickly.
"I'll get you a drink," Jim offered and disappeared, not asking what Sherlock wanted.
“Um…Oh…Mary?”
"I just do, John. It's like reading a book." I hoped my voice was a bit stronger than a whisper.
“I just have one paper….” John said, looking at Sherlock, voice weak.
He gently and slowly placed his empty glass on the table beside his chair. As he sat up straight, he slid forward to the edge of his chair, balancing himself there for a moment. I assumed he was going to get up and head to bed, but he stared at me, his face resolute.
I don't know where he was or who he had been with. I hadn't seen him since the day before, when he came home from the A and E. I think today was a work day for him too, but he obviously went out, after work. I imagined he was with that girl he was dating-no, they had broken up--a month ago, actually.
“Oh, and by the way, I have some great blow, if you are in the need. Unless, your new boyfriend won’t let you play with me anymore.”
I ignored the phone number part. "Why would Seb mention me to you?"
"Sorry Molly, I actually don't know a lot about Sherlock, really." I said (which was perfectly true) as we sat on the very duvet that Sherlock and I slept on the night before.
After Sherlock brushed his teeth, he climbed into the bed and lay next to John who seemed to be snoring. He reached up to turn off the bedside light.
Molly:
Laying in pile of rubble with John on top of him, he never wanted to leave. Sherlock thought it couldn't get any hotter.
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock tried again, but John had sat himself down on the kerb, head in his hands, still processing the events of the evening.
"Thanks Mary, I had fun." I said automatically, but was only partly true.
"Yes,"
Back out in the snow, John now hears a sudden roaring in his ears.  He puts his hands over his ears to try to block out the sound. The wind kicks up and he can't keep his eyes open. He moves his arms to shield his eyes.
But not this time.
“What did he say?” John asked confused and panicked.
I have a dressing gown over my all black clothes. I'm sneaking out. I have a life beyond these walls, despite what my brother wants.
I took the stairs two at a time. I needn't have.
Just in time as Mike opened the door to the flat.
John sat up to scrub his arms. With Harry for a sister and all her problems starting so young, out all night, his parents so angry at the crowds she hung with. Harry so determined to do her own thing…John often wondered if she was rebellious just to get their goat, but no, that was not it…she was who she was and he was, well ….who he was too…the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, now does it?
"I don't...drink." he shook his head.
Now there's a phrase that will stay with you. Maybe we shouldn't stay too long.
"...Sherlock--
So yeah, weeks went by without my seeing Sherlock. I called his room several times, no answer. He's not one to stay in his room, but I called at odd hours and kept hoping to catch him.
“A 'professor' at school called you? That’s funny. And funny how you jumped up there-how’s your leg? Looked like you bashed it good. You’ll have a bruise there tomorrow, I warrant.”
That's funny. Did Mary let go of me because she didn't want
John was certain there was more to this story.
John sat up. The lights in the parking lot shone brightly and the snow on the cars was sparkling. Looking down at his now wet trainers, he kicked the snow in disgust. The toe of his trainers left a divot and he could see the black parking lot under the snow. /p>
"Is there more, professor?"
But I was interrupted. In the back of my mind I could hear Sherlock yell my name. I heard him.
“Think so,” Sherlock sighed. "No matter." he said as he turned to look at John, who again had a lost and devastated look in his eyes.
"Maybe. Yeah." she said as she struggled.
"Hello, brother mine, will you introduce me to you new friend?" he said extending his hand cordially to John.
"Sure, do you have any clean glasses?" he snickered.
Up in my room, I threw myself on my bed, hot tears filling my eyes and spilling down my face, head pounding. I don't know how long I was there before I fell asleep. After all, I had been up for hours looking for wire taps in John's room.
John turns over and places his right hand on Sherlock's bare chest and leans his head on his left fist. He looks into Sherlock's eyes and places a gentle kiss on his chest.
I put my coat on.
Pockets…John dug through her jeans…money-a few bills--still there—cards---not robbed then-- the usual driver's---few white receipts from places she must’ve visited that day… what day? Today? Yesterday?
John would not be able to do anything tonight.
"Nothing,
It took me a bloody 20 minutes to drag Sherlock to the residence hall. He could stand and walk, but his gait was unsteady.  He was slow and uncoordinated, so unlike the person he was usually, with me trotting at his side.
As far as explanations go, Sherlock felt he only owed John so much. But owed he did.   It was not a long explanation, Sherlock leaving out some more incriminating details. He discussed the night he met Harry-the same night of the overdose. He left out the fact that it was his brother Mycroft's car that took Harry to hospital, rather than 999.
They spent lots of time together, just like, well--just like, no, not really...
So now I'm here-- for the night.
“Last chance--I’m happy to come in.” Sherlock laughed, “It’s fine, John really.”
I've been out every night with my floor mates. That's what your supposed to do for Fresher's Week, right?
John sighed.
Mary was not smiling.
Was such a thing possible? My marks had improved, I was no longer failing my exams. I can go down the pub!! It felt like a just reward for all the work I had done.
"Yeah."
"It's fine," Sherlock repeated as he stared into John's eyes and reached up and touched the side of John's face, so close to his own. John breathing above him, quiet, still. John looking at him. His breath smelling a little like alcohol, but Sherlock knew his did, too.  And then he took the side of his thumb and gently traced John’s lower lip. The air in the room was heavy and quiet. Sherlock realized he was holding his breath.
“It’s for shock, Sherlock. You were just in an explosion. Take it off if you like.” Lestrade said, in a gentle, fatherly manner.
I change into track pants and worn t-shirt I've had for ages.  I pour the red wine I've squirreled away into a school mug and settle in for the evening.
Take a break.
He did not expect to see John Watson.
But he couldn't.
Sheepishly John got into the back of Mike’s mum’s car and pulled his suitcase in with him.
John ran back to the hospital lobby to wait.
I just wanted to see what Jim's plan was. With me, for me.
I know it surprised John.
“No don’t worry, it’s for the best. Wasn’t working out.” John grabbed the game board and folded it up and set it aside. He scooted forward and started to remove the books one by one. Placing them to either side of their legs.
I sighed in resignation. "Cocaine.
Mary looks up and smiles. She reaches out and he hands her a small paper cup. Mary empties the paper cup out into her hand and John can see about 3 small pills there. Mary swallows them with her tea. John watches the rest of the people each get a small paper cup and do the same. A woman taps Mary on the shoulder, “Mary, I think it’s your turn for shower.” Mary nods and gets up.
John whispered, as they broke apart momentarily, looking at Sherlock's heavy lidded eyes. He reached up with both hands and pushed on Sherlock's chest, coaxing him with more kisses to lay back.
The door to his room creaked open slightly. John popped his head in. “Oh, there you are. How do you feel? I have 2 paracetamol and tea, if you’re up for it.”
Jim has his hand on my knee. "Sherlock," he whispers in my ear, voice so soft, so close to me, as I'm bent over the mirror.  The back of my shirt is wet with sweat.
I stand up and walk over to Sherlock, who is standing in front of the door to my room. He has a furrowed brow, deep in thought.  I feel like I've been chasing Sherlock all evening and he's been skittish, jumping up (twice now), unable to settle.
A little over done then, right? He chided himself. Stupid git. Why couldn’t he be more restrained? The costume, the following him, the keys he nicked form the rental office this morning. He just could not leave well enough alone. Not to mention the not sleeping--at all--last night just thinking about John coming back to uni. It always has to be some sort of theatrics with him. His brother was right.
And I see you've tried the cider!
So, I had better explain, before I create a disaster (for myself) by having John think I'm putting him off.
"It might be a good idea to get out of here before the electrocution."
Sherlock didn't answer.
"Mycroft." Sherlock was not at all surprised to see the visitor and he was not at all in awe of the packages. Not as much as John was.
What was this? His stomach gave a clench of embarrassment. He was so excited to see John in the university quad, he followed him home and wanted nothing more than to run up to him, accosting him right there on the street.
He stole a glance at Mary out of the corner of his eye. She appeared to be reading the text-but John's mind was elsewhere. Mary looked over and caught him staring. He quickly turned away.
She was smiling. Maybe the term is taking a better direction in all ways.
Sherlock stood and turned quickly to grab the coat at the same time, dodging John’s arms as he made to reach for it.
Up until now, John was just sitting there.  "Would someone like to tell me what's going on?"  he said in a small voice.
"Oh," she said. Molly looked over at Mary, who shrugged her shoulders.
He paused to let his words sink into Sherlock's brain. It was a mental tug of war and Jim thought he'd win. Sherlock was listening.   /p>
John shot him a dirty, pointed look.
This is becoming an awkward coincidence.
Sherlock found lots of people easily readable, but not Jim Moriarty. He was loathe to admit that he and Jim might be similar, despite Jim's insistence. The only thing Sherlock had to concede was that he and Jim could both travel down dark roads. Some of those roads they had traveled together.
"Right. Well John, I'm sure
This is a continuation of the previous chapter. I usually alternate between the boys, but this is Sherlock's perspective, ch 15 and 16.
Opening his eyes he sees the curtains billowing out into the room. He turns his head left and right fearful of what type of new companion will show up.
“Oh no, no, sir. They---they… completely eclipse my knowledge of the subject matter. I--I find that I am unable to grade them. They are written with such depth and breadth of understanding that I…”  he trailed off.
"Well John, we've been arrested on 1.) the count of disorderly behavior and 2.) common assault
"All of this water and the DJ and lights. Invariably setting up this entire place for an electrical disaster."
The room got quiet.
Sherlock blushed. "Um...well...no. Best be on your guard anyway."
"What is this, then?" John held the envelope in the palm of his hand and looked up at him.
"John! Welcome to my party, hope you are having
"This had better be good Sherlock." John managed when he reached him.
He froze when I recognized him. "Don't go anywhere." I said, pointing right at him.
I filled Mycroft in on what happened over the last few weeks. Turns out, he knew Sherlock and I had a row. "John, I wanted to tell you that I think you have been a good influence on my brother. Sherlock is extremely sensitive and has a difficult time accepting criticism. But whatever happens, I want to thank you."
His voice was barely audible. "Nothing," he answered, sitting back down, small quiet smile on his lips. This time he was less agitated. I kept watching him, sipping his whisky, staring into the fire. He shook his glass, ice cubes tinkling and tossed his head back, draining his drink.
"No really, when I realized that you had no food in this flat and that you not only were recovering from a concussion yourself, but also working with the investigators in order to identify the cause of the explosion, I felt I had to 'chip in', as it were."
I've gone to the pub a few times--alone-. I remember that they tell you to not go to pubs when you're in recovery. It's a gateway, they say. Mycroft accuses me of not reading the literature they give you, but I did.
We had been flat mates for about a year. John working part time at the A and E, me working with the police on occasion.
He bumped my knee again, twice, bump, bump. This time I reached out my hand to touch his knee. His knee stopped moving and he sat up in his chair. I gave his knee a squeeze. His hand found mine and he held onto me. I wanted nothing more than to jump up and to sit in his lap, but he looked so different, so fragile, I was afraid to hurt him.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows in surprise.
John looks away, "Nothing.'
“John!” Mary practically shouted, touching his cheek, turning John’s face towards her own.
he called after Sherlock, chasing him out of the room but there was no answer.
She laughed, "Don't tell me--you're not living with him?"
Sherlock looked at John with fear and apology. He looked backwards toward he door of the flat, frowning. "Mrs. Hudson-- she bursts in here all the time without asking."
Too bad John was not here to see me being so competent. Trying not to think about John. Or what John
“Precisely. There was a smaller explosion before the larger one that took out the flat. The party being so loud, no one heard it. The smaller explosion sent this piece of shrapnel through the open window, hitting Mike in the back of the head, knocking him flat.”
I have a big black hole where my memories of that night should be.
I thought about what he said, he was right. I stood up, letting my trouser leg fall over the uncomfortable dressing. "Thank you." I said quietly.
to keep me out of Her Majesty's Young Offender's Institution (HMYOI).
thought Sherlock, feeling momentarily dizzy.
They are interrupted by loud banging on Sherlock's bedroom door.
"Tell them what you know, what you saw. What you thought."
After the scare from Mike, John decided a hot bath was just the thing to help him calm down. He made his way to the loo, tuned on the hot tap and filled the bath. The hot water felt great on his sore muscles as he slowly eased himself into the bathtub. He made a mental note to try to go for a run later since there’d be no football today.
"You sound like Mycroft, now." Sherlock rolled his eyes. He walked out of the kitchen and stood in front of the fire grate warming himself.
I stood up and looked down at my shoes, cheeks hot. "Sorry, I--"  I took a step toward him and stopped, not wanting to get too close. I'm never sure of myself. He'd have to come the rest of the way.
John was about half way through dinner when the phone rang, his mother got up gracefully to get it.
This time John laughed. “Sherlock, I’ve got about 2 stone on you. Believe me, you don’t want to fight me.”
Mike retreats sheepishly.
"Well, he--he has written a few papers…” he trailed off, looking into the distance. /p>
Mary walked over to me.
"Molly, what is it? I'm happy to help if I can...but..."
John could be annoyingly considerate.
"Sherlock Holmes has deigned to come out with us tonight, Irene. And he shall be rewarded. " Jim said regally, as he pulled a tiny, gold paper envelope from his front shirt pocket.
“A piece of shrapnel. Lately of Mike Stamford’s head and your kitchen floor.” Answered Sherlock quietly, thoughtfully.
"So! This is the famous Sherlock Holmes!!" Mikes girlfriend, Liz said with am impish grin. With short dark hair and way too much makeup, Sherlock didn't think she really looked like Mike's type, but then he never paid attention before and didn't know what Mike's type was.
John opened up the matchbook. Inside someone had written:
"Alright, I'll stop." John stood up and tossed the take away cartons in the bin.
Jim took off his coat and tossed it on a another nearby chair. He turned to Irene, his voice cold. "Keep an eye on him, I'll be right back."
Molly appeared, I remember her from the riot, as well.
"Are you going to tell me what happend?"
“I'm 16.” he said reluctantly, looking again into the microscope.
instead, but you insisted on living here.”
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"If..." he broke away from the kiss, "you want to continue, we can go over there to the loo and close the door." He gestured over the the private loo for his room, that I imagine was very small, but had
There was nothing for it. Was it the early morning hour, the slight hangover nagging at my temples or my foul mood? I put on my clothes and seething with anger that came from an unknown source, left John's room.
John's phone rang and he plucked it out of this pocket. "Yeah? Oh? Alright, maybe. Just text me."
The proof. The proof that he and Sherlock….
He didn't look up from his book.
Immediately, they were outside standing on the street below the flat. John was now in a dressing gown, and trainers. He gave himself a mental pat on the back for remembering those, it was winter after all. A coat would have been a better idea, but he wasn't cold.
“Do you want to come into my room?” John asked.
"Yeah. Molly came with me." she answered, but then couldn't help but follow John's eyes across the room when she realized he wasn't looking at her. "What are you loo....?
John chuckled softly, shaking his head at Mike. No one wants their mum to kiss and fuss over them when their mates were watching. Mike was sure to take a ribbing later.
He looked like a regular uni student, almost. A regular student in 200 pound jeans.
Sherlock stood in front of John, not moving. He stared at John, his green-silver eyes were sincere and his voice was barely a whisper. "It could be for the last time, if that's what you want."
"John, can't you introduce me to your friend?" Molly was sweating too, like the rest of us. Covered in foam. Soaked from head to toe.
Still no Sherlock.
“Sherlock, I have to go.” John whispered.
I shook my head. "Mary, Molly. Next you'll be telling me that Stamford fancies, me too." I laughed.
I shouldn't go to the pubs, people
he whispered.
But I wasn't a uni student was I? I wasn't due to go to uni until next year. I was just an interloper. Still, I went along with John and his friends to the pub. I don't even like beer.
John took a big breath, turned to Mike and sighed…”Right… well, Sherlock and I had a bit of a row. And…” he left it there, waving a hand at the splintered mess.
I wish he'd tell me what was bothering him. I'd like to help if I could.
“John, get in,” Mike insisted, slightly irritated, opening the door. “You’re soaked through!!”
"Yeah ok, I guess so." Was all he could come up with
John tried  2 more times  during the afternoon to reach Mary (unsuccessfully) before he got dressed in his football jersey and headed out to the party.
"Are you leaving?" she asked whispering worriedly.
“I was not aware that you needed to be informed about where I was.” Sherlock said, voice steely and sarcastic.
“Yes.” John said. Sherlock helped him stand and started walking towards John’s room. “Where are we going?”
Everything I knew, which thankfully, was very little. I made Mycroft promise, promise that Victor would not go down. He said he'd do what he could. It was out of my hands. Caught in a sting--as it were. Too late.
Sherlock and John stood in the sitting room, facing each other.
The fabric belt of Sherlock's dressing gown had loosened as they sat there. John pulled Sherlock's shirt tails out of his trousers with both hands and slipped the dressing gown and shirt off of Sherlock's shoulders.
John lets out the smallest groan, almost a sob.
I turned it so he could see.
I was told it was the finest hashish on the streets in the last few months. I don't always believe what they say. I have my own methods. I like to do plenty of research.
The coke sits on the mirror in all it's  glory. I lean back in my seat and take a sip of my beer. News of my recreational cocaine use has gotten outside of school and the coke is seeking me out. How convenient. I watch Jim use the edge of a razor blade to cut the cocaine into a  finer powder. I can feel desire swell up in my groin in an ache.  The way I want this coke is visceral, my body aches for it. The small of my back is wet with sweat. It's not warm in here.
John almost ventured to call Mycroft twice, but what would be say? "Hi Mycroft, I'm not sure you remember me, but um..it's John Watson and...I live with your bother and…sometimes he just disappears, and well, yeah... he comes back, but um…" not sure how that’d go over.
And she tuned and left.
“Of course, John.” Sherlock’s response seemed a little robotic to John.
So, I panicked. I drained my pint. "I'm for the loo, excuse me."
John walked over to him. "Can you stop?" he asked, too firmly, maybe, taking a flask out of Sherlock's hands. "We'll be leaving for your mum's house in the morning. You're not starting something new, are you?"
“Make me.”
“That are inadequate?” Maybe his secretary should have fielded this one.
The only way out of this now is to leave the party, the mission will have to be scrapped. Sherlock did not get what he came for, nonetheless, progress was made, albeit incremental progress.  He called a taxi and loaded the still very high John in.
-Walk or run away quickly. No, they’d be too temped to run after him, he knew blokes like this back home.
Molly had to rescue John.
“Good… um…John, are you leaving? Can we walk out together?” Molly asked.
"Hello, Mr. Watson, this call is from St. Stephen's Hospital. You have been identified as the next of kin to Harriet Watson?"
John was quiet on the ride home. He just sat there, looking out the window, managing his nausea, feeling his life was all to pot.
styrofoam cup. It was much too hot.
What Sherlock was going to do with himself all summer was the least of John’s worries right now.
"It's fine John," she placed her hand affectionately on his arm and gave her son a small smile. "John, we almost lost Harry." Her voice cracked slightly. "It's fine, really. We just want you safe and if you're happy we're happy."
Sherlock snapped.
John took the offered water bottle. It was just an average sized water bottle, disposable, the kind you get at Tesco's, but it struck John as hilarious. He snorted loudly, "When did you bring this with you and
Always had a drink in my hand. Bought a round too, when it was my shout, because that's a
John peeked out of the door of Sherlock’s room. It was morning and he had to use the loo, there was nothing for it. The flat was quiet. Stamford’s door was closed, he must’ve already left for the lab. Giving a sigh of relief, John was in the hall and closing the door of Sherlock’s room just as Stamford came out of the loo.
"Code?" The supervisor repeats him, but he is not listening just now. He's lost in thought, staring off in the distance.
“I was afraid,” He heard John whisper, mostly into his shoulder.
John felt sorry for Mrs. Hudson and regretted coming over.
"I'm sorry, I just thought of something." he looked back and forth between his parents frowns.  John lowered his head, fighting to calm himself, in order to make sense to his parents. "I'ts, I--I know someone--back in London. Who may be able to help. Help us--help Harry."
I'm almost back at school. I can make it to supper if I speed up a bit. I guess I better eat something. I can't remember the last time I ate.
To be fair, I saw him first. He looked awful. I remember reading the articles about all of the injuries. There were a few choice pictures in the papers of uni kids being treated by the medics. Black eyes and lacerations, bruises and a few broken bones.
“No, no I don’t.”  Mike was smiling and shaking his head from the kitchen floor.
John watched the car pull away, realizing just now that he had no clothes or bag with him.
John jumps up.
John and Sherlock just stared at each other for a few minutes, waiting, holding a collective breath. Then the boys erupted in laughter for several minutes, faces red.
That's the way the entire night went. I tried to drink plenty of water, the club was sweltering and loud. At times the lights were blinding.
She started to speak through the crying. "I didn't know who to ask, I just thought...maybe." she pulled back and looked at me, her nose red. She tried to smile, a bit.
“Well, he sighed. “It’s really quite a long story that I’ll tell you sometime I reckon, but I can’t now, sorry. How is Harry?”
In the light of the sitting room, John could now see the black and blue area on Sherlock's left cheek bone and near his eye. It was slightly swollen.
"I thought you had something on with the
It's quiet in the room. The alarm clock ticks loudly on the bedside table, showing 3am.
"Yeah, that's it, I have to go. Sorry."
It took a few days of despair at school before I wound up on Mycroft's doorstep. It was early evening when he opened the door himself, housekeeper out, apparently. It's difficult to surprise my brother. He stood in the doorway, shirttails out of his trousers and glass of gin in hand. One arched eyebrow betrayed the shock he felt.
John called over to Sherlock, hoping somehow to prolong the exchange.
"No, everything's fine. Yes, everything's happened. Nothing's fine. Sorry Molly, I have to go. I think I've made a terrible mistake. " John got up abruptly and left the pub. The footballers called after him but he didn't hear them.
Thinking, no--
In a big pack, the footballers descended on the local pub. Dark and narrow, it was loaded with uni students--wall to wall. The team found an open area downstairs, it was cooler there, too.
Sherlock sneered, trying to sound unaffected by the veiled threat.
He could imagine his brother standing, in his impeccable Armani suit, holding a sign that read ‘Puddings Not People’ and walking up and down #10 Downing Street or Buckingham Palace.
I've never spent so long kissing someone. This is the
"But that could've been made by anything bound to the wrist?" Offers Lestrade.
I repeated.
I could see who was taking now. I hadn't seen this bloke before. He was taller than me, in all black--well, what I could see that wasn't covered in foam. Molly appeared at my elbow.
had anything to do with this.
"You don't need to take any responsibility for me, I do have a brother and Mrs. Hudson,
John suggested Sherlock lay on the large bed, but he refused. "Sofa's fine."
John kissed him and a small involuntary moan escaped his lips. With both hands John reached around to touch Sherlock's arse. This time, Sherlock let out small breathy moan.
John knew very well she did not carry a handbag or purse, she was too careful for that, preferring to keep valuables in her pockets…closer to her body, less likely to leave anything behind.
" I didn't hear anythin'," He put his book down, sighing. He got up, walked over to the lift and hit the button.
His mother ran to him first. “Oh John!” His mother’s eyes were wild when she saw him, “….How?….How did you get here? Who told you? How did you know?” She looked helplessly from John’s concerned face to his father.  “John…we didn’t tell…” and falters off, bewildered.
John’s face was on fire, his cheeks were tingly, and he was slightly nauseous.  “Thanks, Mike,” was all he could manage.
Everyone thought that John and Mary made a cute couple. Sherlock got tired of hearing about how cute and happy and 'made for each other' they were. Weeks flew by and one Friday night after their date, John didn’t come back to the flat. Mike fully expected this. Mike watched them and could tell that they got on very well and maybe things would get more serious between them.
Mike popped his head into the room. "Go'in' the pub, John. Coming?"
And then…Sherlock…John buried his face in his hands.
There was little he could do about Sherlock's pouting. John went to bed.
The pub was quiet now, all eyes turned toward their small group, right at the front door, putting on quite a show.
He's settled a bit. I take this chance to sit up and pull his jersey over his head. His father's metal tags clink and fall back against his chest.  Sitting up and facing him, I kiss him and caress his chest and nipples, working my way back up his neck. I trace my tongue just under the metal chain he wears, on the delicate skin of his neck. He gives out a small gasp. Time to take track pants off. I stand up and get rid of them, so does he. We are standing up, face to face and I reach for him. I take his face in my hands and kiss him. He reaches behind me and runs his hands over my arse. I place my hands on his shoulders and gently push him down on the bed. Neither of us has any clothes on. I pull the duvet over the both of us and lay to side of him and reach between his legs.
Teen John turned to his little sister and said, "Right, well, um...hey guess what? I think maybe Father Christmas hid something for you! How about you stand there and hide your eyes?"
John took another good look at Sherlock. He stood there with black, wrinkled, dirty track pants and the grey hooded sweat shirt. The neck of the sweat shirt was pulled out of shape. Sherlock was also wearing ancient black Converse trainers. When did he own trainers?
Of course, I was just going to let this play out because I had felt I had no other choice than to let things unravel for themselves.
Jim was now sitting on the floor, rubbing his jaw and laughing, his mouth a sneer. “No, it’s ok Mary, I’m fine. I guess chivalry is not dead.”
"I understand." I said, I got up and placed my cup on the desk.
What would his parents say?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
And that's how John found himself sitting across from Mary, ready to eat dinner--when his phone rang in his pocket.
He looked at me, quiet. "I have to go but,
Sherlock turned over, slowly, keeping the balled up fabric against his head.
I screamed at Mycroft when he arrived, looking like a proper lunatic-after all, I was still high. I'm sure his coworkers  feel sorry for him-burdened by a mad younger sibling.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“Right. Of course.” Said John, getting out. Standing on the kerb, he shoved his hands in his pockets as if looking for money for a tip.
"No, you're not sure." he says, staring down at me, eyes dark, serious. He's in my lap properly now and reaches around the small of my back to pull my shirttails out of my trousers. I'm sweating and my mind goes blank. He's rocking against me now. "All I'm sure of is that you are the most gorgeous fucking thing I've ever laid eyes on and I've never wanted anything the way I want you." By then, he had both of his hands working on the belt of my trousers.
Mary stops by my room occasionally, less now. She's mad at me. I think everyone is, a bit, after they saw me hit Jim. But Mary was there when he pushed me off the balcony. If anyone should understand, it's her.
Sherlock had just zipped his suitcase shut when the phone rang.
We walked out of the library and back to the residence hall, slowly. The two of them matching my hobbling pace.  Sherlock mentioned he spoke to the police and a said a little about the investigation. Molly nodded, she seemed satisfied.
“I was asking you a question, John. What’s got into you?” Mary crinkled her forehead in confusion.
“He’s awfully protective of you, isn’t he? And I thought you were such a big boy….
I saw, about Mary or anything else.
"He's a good person." Mrs. Watson looked at her son.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I had already made sure the window was open. Hashish can be pungently sweet.  I don't need any more trouble.
It's my intention to separate. Now. This will be it, then. We can stop this farce of 'studying'. I'm sure Lestrade will call and let me know what the next steps are. For me.
She whispered to her brother.
But John wasn't laughing, he looked serious. He looked down at Sherlock and they both got quiet. Just breathing, just looking at each other.
He wondered what woke him, it was cold in the bedroom, he had kicked the blanket off. John grabbed his track pants from where he had tossed them on the floor and pulled them on.He got out of bed and walked to the loo.  Coming back, he noticed that the bedroom curtains were moving gently in the room, as if there was a breeze. That's why it's so cold in here, Sherlock probably left the window open after the explosion. Let's close that.
Older John watched a very young Sherlock walk along the edge of the lake, sticking his tennis shoe where the water met the land, cracking the ice.
"Well, I thought we...were friends.
There was no one in the library now, everyone was at dinner. I made to get my books together, but I was struggling. Bag, books, crutches, cast, chair. I was a mess.
I know my brother has me followed. I know the school reports to him. He didn't mention my (unauthorized) trip to the club. No mention of the riot, nor my photo on the front of the local newspapers.
John crawled slowly up to the top of the bed and sat with his back against the headboard and sighed. It would be great to stay with Sherlock. Just the two of them, all day, every day. It was so hard to walk away--he was wrapped around Sherlock’s little finger.
John said, admiringly.
He gave a cursory glance inside. Harry’s coat--thick wool, blue jeans, t shirt, her boots, leather, sturdy sole with a tread even though there was no snow on the ground in Chelmsford…he started to dig inside the bag, thinking.
“And by all means, we’ll clean up the mess.” Sherlock spoke calmly from the floor, still laying  on his back, coat covering his waist and part of one leg.
at least hear what she has to say..."
My head was spinning, Molly stood close to me and put her arm around my shoulders. I wanted to cry, but I was too stunned and knackered.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
She closed the door. Sherlock heard the latch catch.
It was just not possible to see Sherlock over the summer. John's days slogged on and ran into one another, sunny days, working, dinners with family, John even saw some mates from primary school.
Sherlock abruptly changed his mind. "That's enough, I think, time to go." and pushed him self away from the table and stood up. He looked over at the elderly proprietor and nodded.
We walked to the police car, got in and rode to the station. We weren't going to the local station obviously, they're not all open at this time of night. Islington is the only one, I think on this side of London.  I made the mistake of sharing that observation with John.
Better this way, Sherlock, don’t get attached.
Sherlock took off. Don't know where he's gone to. Think he said something about the loo.
I walked along with them to the residence hall. And that's how I found out where John and Molly lived.
The train ride back to London was uneventful. When John emerged from the station, the day was bright and crisp. John doggedly trudged to the flat he shared with Mike and Sherlock and got there about noon. He dutifully unpacked, placing clean clothes in drawers.
John did not mean to take his parents by surprise, but  he did just that when he appeared in the doorway of the family waiting room.
“Yes, there’s a pretty good chance.” Sherlock's cheeks were a high pink and he was very serious.
-Confront them now. Get the beating over with. John was sure he could hold his own. Well, he hoped. Three to one, though.
Mrs. Hudson closed the door. John grabbed a kitchen chair and dragged it over to the sofa. "Are you going to tell me what happened? Not that it's any of my business, really."
"Yes sir." The professor felt very nervous, and his voice was small.
Sherlock waited until he was sure that John had ceased his infernal pacing and had gone to bed.  He waited an additional 30 minutes more until he was pretty certain John would be asleep. Sherlock got out of bed. He had something to do.
Sherlock was on the floor on top of the shattered remains of the coffee table, large wooden splinters everywhere. Their arms were tangled in the coat, each of them still having a good piece of it. John still tugging as Sherlock couldn’t hold onto it any longer and dissolved into laughter.
He didn't look fine. His eyes were red, he seemed slower, lethargic, damn--I have to find him.
“Sherlock wait.” John said as he caught the keys midair. John walked over to his best friend and caught Sherlock by the left wrist.
"Yes sir." He answered from a small, hard chair in front of the enormous desk.
She quickly wedged herself between him and I and tried to make polite conversation while shouting over the DJ.  I edged away from them to try to find a nice simple, cold pint.
“Git. Well, I was hoping…..” John began, taking one big exaggerated step toward Sherlock.
Sherlock stood in front of the door. He didn't walk over to John on purpose, but leaned against the closed door and folded his arms across his chest, keeping some distance between them.
“Relax, John. He doesn’t know anything, how could he?” Sherlock picked up the wine menu.
All I have to do is walk past the floor guard, down the back steps and out the door. I did this every weekend last term. Works like a charm.
"Come to mine." Sherlock offered, shrugging his shoulders.
John said through clenched teeth and lunged right at him.
Teen John was gone for about 10 minutes. When he got back, Harry was sitting on the floor, apparently tired of just standing there, but still had her hands over her eyes. John could hear his father snoring.
John moved in with Sherlock and Mike. Mike got out of hospital and was on the mend quickly. John slowly replaced all of his books and clothes that were destroyed in the explosion. For the first few weeks, the phone at the flat rang off the hook, much to the dismay of Sherlock, who after a very short while, refused to answer. Friends called, professors called, the football team called, girls called. Everyone wanted to talk to John and Mike about what happened.
John sighed and walked over to Sherlock. He reached up to touch his face and Sherlock jerked back away from him.
"Turn over, then. Let me look at it."
"You didn't tell her anything that wasn't already in the papers."
Back outside, in the snowy yard. John asked, "And what was the point of that?" But he got no answer from his small, silent companion.
The house that he was sharing with the rest of the football team was not far from campus. This year John was vice president of the recreation football club. It was just a side activity, no scholarships here, and he knew he wasn’t going to be a professional footballer, but John loved football.
“Mary, what are you doing here?” he asks hoarsely, knowing full well that of course, it wasn’t really Mary.
"Respite's over,"  Sherlock whispered. "Come on John, back into the fray," Sherlock reached for John's arm to guide him out of the WC.
Spring, 1984
Pausing a moment to catch his breath, he moved his lips down Sherlock's smooth strong neck.  John was almost sitting in Sherlock's lap. He was feeling desperate and didn't want to leave a mark with his mouth or teeth, so he stopped and rested his head against Sherlock's shoulder, panting.  He could feel Sherlock hands playing with the waist band of his trousers.
he whispers. He leans his forehead against Sherlock's chest. Sherlock is practically holding him up, now. The kitchen is still very dark, Sherlock is certain that Liz can't
"I would like to report that the planning meeting for the Christmas Campaign has  been a success, sir and all supplies have been, um... acquired and secured."
He said softly.
John gently shook Sherlock by the non bloody shoulder. "Can you sit up?"
He sighed. "Taps, wires, cameras, listening devices."
Sherlock was laying on his stomach just waking from sleep. His eyes were still closed, and he realized that the other side of the bed was empty due to the lack of radiated warmth.
Sherlock's group got up to leave. Thankfully, they didn't have to pass us to get to the door. Mary kept her hand on mine across the table the entire time, almost holding me in place. "Don't do anything you'll regret, John." she whispered.
John immediately felt better, "Wow, Mary--thanks for the call. You look great!"
Jim saw stars and hit the pub floor with a thud. Flat on his back, dazed but not unconscious.
"Penny for your thoughts, Sherlock,"  Jim asked out of the corner of his mouth.
he stood in the middle of my room, both hands on his head, fingers combing through his wild hair.
The professor cleared his throat. "....looks at me."
Sherlock walked a few blocks, wishing John was with him. That’s how he preferred it to be. Barring that, he wished he could be with John in Chelmsford.
He continued, it's like he couldn't stop. "You won't find Mary looking over her shoulder. Mary's not afraid of anyone."
Sherlock imagined that this was a one-time thing, heat of the moment-maybe and as nice as Sherlock thought it was, he imagined that John would not let it continue. John's romantic reputation had preceded him. Sherlock was quite aware of John’s reputation with the girls at uni; he heard what other students said.  John Watson, football player and a bit of a lady’s man,  had dated girls from all of the 3 residence halls on campus, as well as girls who lived off campus, too.
He looked forward to a quiet evening sitting beside a warm fire with his feet up and no responsibilities.
And so, as Lestrade and I were talking, they had handcuffed John. He was sitting there looking pretty pathetic, when Lestrade and I walked over to him.
“I don’t.” Sherlock's face was clouded, serious.
I had gotten so angry I felt like I lost my mind. I had weeks and months of suffering and Jim just appeared out of no where without a care in the world.
He reached over, eyes closed, to gently touch the vacant spot and found the sheets still slightly warm. John could not have left the bed more than 5 minutes ago.
I'll have to come up with a better strategy than the one I have now to get away from school for so long without being missed.
My life was easier with John.
Sherlock frowned.
I think the antibiotics are helping. Every time I look at it, it's less red. He seems to have less pain too. I'm surprised that his legs are so muscular. As I changed the dressing I was reminded of how he tackled me to the ground that night at the pub. I felt like I was hit by a lorry.
John sighed. His shoulders slumped. He tipped his head towards the doorway. "Let's go, Mike"
He asked question after question. John knew very little about me and I preferred to keep it that way. I deflected his questions about me by telling him things about his friends.
"Can't we just get this over with?" No sense in postponing the inevitable.
Sherlock sees Jim, Jim offers him cocaine in a back room and Sherlock finds the temptation too much?
Beyond my control, I felt blood rush to my face, I opened the door.
"Oh. Fine," he took off again, frowning. Searching for the server.
Where was Mike anyway? How long ago did he disappear? Could it have been an hour?
"Sherlock, you drive me fuckin' crazy. I've felt this way for along time now. and I was just not sure how to go...about... this..."
He watches a tall, older man who appears to be in charge, come over to the group with a big tray. “Ok everyone- morning meds. Mary, you first.”
"I think this is it." he gestured with a nod. The three story house looked like the others, a few broken windows, paperboard in place, to keep out the rain.
As we walked back from the curry place, we passed Sherlock's school. I looked up at the building wondering which window was his.
But, it turns out, I don't know everything. Lestrade, Mycroft
"People talk, John." she played with her wine glass, tipping it back and forth.
"How much?" Molly asked, looking warily at the wristband.
Although, I could. It'd be really easy.
"Closer, she wanted something."
John took another step and stood right in front of him. He tried to make some small talk, but the quiet tone of his voice didn't match the subject. “First match of the term is tomorrow.”
John believed him.
Sherlock got off his chair like a shot and climbed into my lap. He placed his soft lips on mine as I ran my hands up both of his thighs, making my way under his dressing gown to his waist. The dressing gown fell open. I gave a gasp out loud when I felt his sharp hip bones.
gave him cocaine?
I smoked a cigarette as I walked along, glad to be away from school for a bit.
As if the kid could read his thoughts, he said, "No it's not a dream, John, you are to come with me." John looked over at sleeping Sherlock, who had not stirred at all after his loud yelling and said, "Ok, what the hell, looks as if I have no choice, let's go."
I was outside for a few hours. It was cold, dark and snowing on and off.
of money. His brother is in government. He's
"Elbowed in the eye by a forger." John explained.
“So, I want to make it very clear that am uncomfortable with him in my class. I...I find that I’m unable to speak in front of him anymore, I’m sorry sir, I’m just not up to the task.”
We went to another of the uni pubs, there are plenty. Sherlock was quiet, looking over his shoulder at times. He wouldn't tell me why when I asked.
“Afraid?”
"Jesus," Stamford whispered behind him.
Younger John was up ahead of Sherlock by a good 50 feet. As he had walked along he was listening to the crunch of the snow under his trainers. Walking along the snowy path that lead backup to the house.
"In my room? Where we spend lots of time...with no clothes on?"
"Right you are, Harry! I'll just have to look harder for mine! Come into the kitchen now. I'll make you something to eat." And they walked into the kitchen.
What if I can help you?"
Lestrade's voice was much too gentle.
Again Sherlock looked in John’s eyes, searching, looking for ? John was not sure what. John looked at Sherlock trying and failing to guess what was going on in his head, when there was a crash in the sitting room, followed by some whooping an hollering, John's flatmates had arrived.
The trip to John's residence hall was longer than it needed to be, due to John not remembering his address.
"Name? of who?" the new employee asks earnestly, eyes wide.
He sighed. His brow was furrowed and he looked quickly both ways down the street. "No, it's alright. Can we just hurry and get to your flat? It's freezing."
"Leave John out of it." Sherlock tried not to show how nervous he was. He downed his pint, setting the glass down firmly on the bar and reaching into his pocket for his gloves. He turned away from Jim, ready to leave. He needed to just walk away and get back to the flat. New fixative had never sounded so promising.
Sherlock wasn't in the flat and he wasn't with Lestrade. John hoped like hell Sherlock was with Mike Stamford. John didn't want to panic, perhaps he innocently went to Tescos.
It was stupid, I know, to go out with the people from school, but I was getting
But the lights never went back on as John expected them to. They stayed off and the room took on a dull, foggy gleam. The music changed, too. Gone was the jumpy pop he heard from the street. The music was loud, throbbing and electronic. John looked over at Mary and her teeth were glowing bright white against her blue shiny lips in the foggy, misty room.
"I want you to know that you can come to me for anything. I mean anything." He snorts a line of the new powder and slides the mirror to me again. "You won't regret this."
"Plenty, I imagine."
Sherlock looks at the floor, doubtful… “Uh…” he moans and rolls his eyes, not wanting to commit.
"I just saw her, she looked to go shopping. She had a shopping bag and pocketbook with her." John said.
It took a few months to send Jim Moriarty and his father to jail. There was a prolonged trial, Mr. Moriarty getting the best barristers money and drugs can buy to defend him, but the evidence was overwhelming. Many witnesses came forward including the staff employed at his club to give evidence for his drugs dealing.
“I--- I was looking for—" confused, he felt a flush coming over his face.
John sighed.
"If we face it together--we can face anything." He looks up at Sherlock.
"Well, to be perfectly honest..." the bloke was backing away, holding up his hand. With the other hand, he deftly picked up a poker from the fireplace.
I put my hand up. "I don't need anything." I turned to walk away but he grabbed my arm.
"Is it yours?" she asked.
It very much brought back memories of Amsterdam, but my thoughts thankfully turned elsewhere.
"John, we can't stop you. If you think it's best, then go." his Dad shrugged. "Come back when you can." he put his hand on John's shoulder.
"I imagine so." I sighed.
And Mycroft finds himself right attached to puddings….
On the table, he spread things out for me to see. A mirror, a few plastic drinking straws wrapped in paper, small sewing scissors.
How many weeks had it been since the riot?  I spoke to him that night, right before everything went wrong. I remember him. I'd know him anywhere.
John stared at the pages, the words blurry.
"John?' Sherlock was surprised to see John at 1 am in the morning.
Three rounds in, John was wining at darts. Ian walked over to him. "Watson, that bird over there is eyeing you."
I jumped.
"What were you looking for?"
I pulled on track pants and walked through the lounge to the loo. Should've got an ensuite. Too much money, though.
my words came through gritted teeth.
So I'm stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I opened my mouth. I knew right away I was fuckin' done for. It was
John led him down the hallway and into the bedroom and he fell onto the bed face down, shirt sleeve still buttoned, shirt trailing on the floor. John reached to pick the shirt up and unbutton it from Sherlock’s wrist. He tossed it over a chair and went to get a bucket. Placing the bucket at the side of the bed near Sherlock's head, he felt his wrist to check his radial pulse. It was rapid and bounding. He made some quick mental calculations--suspicious that alcohol was not the only thing Sherlock had consumed the night before. Sure, he could be dehydrated from drinking, but John had a sneaking suspicion that Sherlock could possibly have some exotic pastimes.
Of course, there was my own charge I had to deal with, too. They let us both go home on bail, my court case a month from then, entirely dependent on how Jim fared.
"Oh,  I see," he's reading me like a fuckin' book, "Daddy wouldn't let you, would he?" he whispered.
"Well, that's a relief." I laughed.
If John got home before Sherlock, he’d pace the floor until his flat mate got home. If he was out with Mary, he kept checking his watch and would occasionally excuse himself and use the red telephone box outside to call the flat to check. Both Mary and Mike noticed. Other people noticed, too.
“Yes, they are superfluous, well, now.” Sherlock stood in the middle of the walkway, hands stuffed in the front pocket of a grey hooded sweatshirt. Just now, the sweat shirt hanging on his slim frame, he looked much younger than his 17 years.
Seeing John that night was not the worst thing that could have happened to me. In years hence, Mycroft would refer to these events as
Momentarily confused, I'm frowning. "John I..." Now I can read him. I may be a little slower than usual tonight, but he's looking at me with a predatory gaze, and touching the side of my face with his right hand. It's quieter than ever in the flat, the air heavy, as time is suspended and my head is spinning, I can hear the crackling of the fire behind him.
Jim reached down into the cushions on either side of Sherlock's thighs and pulled up two leather straps and tied his wrists.  Jim knelt down near Sherlock's feet and pulled out two leather straps to tie his ankles firmly.
Molly was all smiles at this bloke.
"Do you ever go out? Do you even have fun?"
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed pale as a sheet, eyes as big as saucers.
“Sure.” Sherlock smiled and they walked into Sherlock room, John falling in a heap into bed.  Sherlock helped him off with his shoes and John looked to be out cold, laying on his stomach. “…the rooms spinning.” He mumbled into the pillow.
John had stubbornly refused to move in with Sherlock, even though it was the thing he wanted most in all the world.
"I'd say not." Sherlock snickered into his lo mein.
I spent the night in hospital and the next day,  Mary, Mike and Molly showed up with the newspaper. The hospital called my mum and she came right away to see me. I tried to explain what happened as she cried at the side of the bed, but most of it I didn't remember. Mum was worried and angry, but I promised her that I didn't feel as bad as I looked. They let me go the day after.
“John are you there??” Mary asked.
"Please don't go." I tried to reach for him, he pulled away. "Wait, is your building even open at this hour?"
The coat and the cocaine were soon forgotten.
Because I was already in love with him. Too late to protect my heart.  I just bury my feelings, secreted away, never to see the light of day.
"I have no place to go.” John stated matter of factly, in a very small voice.
“John, I’m breaking up with you,
He didn't get a chance to finish rambling because Sherlock leaned down and kissed him. it was brief it was soft and it was quick.
Right. I'm hopeless.
Feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins, Sherlock felt calmer. He was a bit pleased that he could help John out, even if it was a very little thing like the term paper. Turning towards home, he decided that there were things he could get up to in the flat to keep busy. After walking a block, he decided maybe he’d make some new slides with a new fixative he had gotten in the mail.
So John found himself skulking around Croyden, Stamford in tow, looking for an address. When she was in hospital, he looked though her clothes, and found a crumpled piece of paper. No matter that she was an adult, he was determined to beat the shit out anyone who was 'helping' his sister get drugs.
Sherlock smiled again and drained his cup. He slid closer to me. "Of course I knew you'd be a gentleman, John." he leaned in to kiss me.
It's close to time for me to take him back to his school. We'll walk back slowly and we'll talk about all manner of things and then I'll sign him back in until about 48 hours later. I'll think about him until I see him again.
She turned and gave John a smile and walked out of the family lounge.
"And you're John." Wait, how did he know? Molly said my name, right?
I looked at her, not sure what she meant, really. I looked down into the pint glass. "He's been a great help, yeah. I have chemistry sorted. This term's not a loss."
I dropped him onto the bed in his coat, unconscious again.
I did it mostly to entertain John and to keep his knowledge about me to a minimum--overall the observations being completely useless.
He didn't move.
"What've you been doing?" he asked cheerfully.
John stood on the stoop when they both opened the front door.
This morning when he woke up his only worry was the paper he had to get in by the end of the day. Now after seeing Jim all but stalking him at the library and after that, enduring Molly’s scolding, John had other things on his mind. Lots of other things.
Devon can wait, a bit.
“Sherlock you know why. Let’s not get into this again. We spend all together too much time with each other and people…talk.”
The rest of the term flew by. John's bed became a storage area. He piled clean laundry on it. He organized his books on it. He occasionally sat on it.
As prescient as I am at times, my warnings and observations go unheeded.
Sherlock slowed down, lungs on fire. He could probably take the next block as a walk. John likely went home with Mary and they could just have it out in the morning. Or even better yet, in a few more blocks, Sherlock could take the tube to Mycroft’s. School was over for the term.
Mycroft says I'm a piss poor billiard player. He always beats me. I should have let John win, but my competitive side kicked in. I drank too fast and was already feeing the alcohol. I had to go to the loo.
"Molly, where's your phone book?" on a hunch, I looked through Molly's phone book and found Holmes M. with the street name and SW1.
‘I didn’t think, really.” John said, realizing his socks were soaked with water, his feet wet inside his trainers.
“Please continue.” He glanced at his watch. Maybe he could cancel the 1pm appointment and have a later lunch.
"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are out after curfew, isn't this a breach of the terms of your bail?"
I know full well what's going on.
And I do the two lines in rapid succession, not being vocal when the powder hits the inside of my nose, but I'd love to moan too. I can feel my face flush red. I reflexively hold the side of my nose, leaning over, elbow on the table.
Light's out is at 11 and curfew is 12 on the weekends.  I've already been counted as in my room.
John was lucky he heard the key in the lock. Luckily, it was a loud metal mechanism, that caused the wooden door to creak and stick and resist as it was opened.
John stumbles with his words, hoping the convenient lie sticks for now. "I...um Mary and I..."
"This is a victory, John. I have the ankle tag off my leg, I can go anywhere!" The owner appeared with the wine bottle.
Sherlock took a step toward John. “John…”
I stood up when I recognized Jim and everything about the night he pushed me over the railing came flooding back. I saw red. I walked away from the table without a word to anyone, ready to beat the living shit out of him.
John was having a very difficult time concentrating on Mary’s words. He was vaguely nauseated, too. He sat down at the kitchen table and rested his head on the cool table top.
"Of course, they shouldn't be used that way, as a restraint,
Sherlock nuzzled the back of John's neck as they stood there in the dim light. The fridge was still open, John standing in the cold of the open door. Sherlock reached under John's jersey and pressed his hand against John's flat stomach.
Put his hand on my shoulder. I flinched. "Sorry, too close?" he laughed.
They shouted over the din of the base.
There were few times he didn't show, but then the next time he would. He never gave me an excuse or explanation and I didn't ask. My location never changed, I was always at the same place--he knew where I'd be.
John raised his finger to his lips, in an effort to keep Sherlock quiet until he was sure that Mike wasn’t coming out again from the bedroom.
Getting into the club was easy. I had the red Fresher's Week band, as a well as the gold Queue Jumper's band. I sailed right in. Not sure why I'm here.  Nothing going on this sleepy side of London.
“Sorry—they’re your sister's, then. I’m supposed to given them to the family.”
Somehow with him on top of me, I got hold of myself and stopped swinging. He had pinned my arms above my head and shouted my name. Who knew he was so strong? It takes alot to take me down, especially after drinking, I'm like my father like that.
John sighed again, looking at Sherlock and realizing that he was just going to have to take it as it was. It was progress--kind of, he thought.
“It's fine.” Disappointment apparent in Sherlock’s tone.
Plenty to drink, but the drink of the night was the
John was about three beers in when Mary showed up, looking for him. As soon as she got there, she made a bee line for John, grabbing him by the upper arm.
I shrugged. Trying to ignore it, unsuccessfully.
Mike became quiet when asked about Sherlock. He looked down at his shoes, hesitating. But Liz jumped in before he could formulate a reply.
"Mycroft, I don't, I..."
Mary was the first to speak,
The person/ apparition that was not Mary waved an accommodating arm. “I am to take you on a journey.” Was her crisp, slightly irritated, business like statement.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
John began to feel a little tipsy but it was not at all uncomfortable. He looked over at Mary, who seemed delighted but not surprised at the change of atmosphere.
"Who?"
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
He frowned at me. "How would I know? You know her better than me."
This caused Sherlock to stir. He sat up slightly, got on his knees and lifting up John's jersey, started kissing his way up John side, with no protests from John.
"Correct, I doubt you'll find them. Likely the killer destroyed them."
I could,
So, the truth then.
"John I..." he reached in to the pocket and pulled out a small carefully folded origami envelope and handed it to John.
He had been a bit quiet all night. But after the loo, he was just staring down into his pint, serious. It worried me. "Alright?" I asked.
He was falling, falling and fast--- ready to hit the hard ground--John awoke in a panic, sitting bolt upright, covered in sweat, he glanced around the room--Sherlock’s room, he looked at the messy desk, strewn with books--piles of them all over, the papers, the periodic table on the wall, the violin in the corner. And next to him sleeping quietly, Sherlock—asleep on his stomach, head turned away from John. The cold January moonlight streaming in between the curtains, casting a few stripes along Sherlock’s hard muscled shoulders and back…the duvet kicked off and halfway on the floor.—John’s heart gave a clench. And John wanted to run. To run from this--all of this. But he couldn’t, and he wouldn’t. His heart hammering in his chest, he touched Sherlock on the shoulder. They had to talk about this, middle of the night be damned.
John choked.
The ringing phone brought me out of my reverie. Mycroft again, I'm sure. "What?" is my usual way of answering him.
“I’ve been taking martial arts for years.” Countered Sherlock.
"It's nothing." I said, but I think he knows I'm lying.
He took it from her, pried the top off and saw sewing needles and thread. He chuckled.
"Is that so?"
John bent over, hands on the tops of his knees, trying to catch his breath. “What the
"How are you John?" she asked after getting a pint. "Here with the footballers, I see." Molly and her friends were pretty done up for a trip to the pub, she was wearing makeup.
“I love being with you too.” Sherlock whispered into the darkness.
"You'll likely find her using the bank card or car of the victim.
John turned bright red and put his head down, “Well…No, no, of course not.”
"Not a name of a who, but of whom?" corrects the supervisor, dialing.
a sight for sore eyes!" A warm arm was thrown around his shoulders and a kiss was planted on his cheek.
"Pastime." added Sherlock, smacking both of the arms of the chair for emphasis and launching himself out of the chair. "I know." he said, into her ear and walking past her briskly, almost knocking her off her feet.
There was no room to move and he couldn't see anyway.
“Thank you, Mycroft.”
John closed his eyes as the room began to swirl the tiniest bit. He took a deep breath and answered, "The normal one, I reckon, I'm fine. Fun party, see you later, Mary." and walked away from them into the fog. Panicking, he wanted to get out right then, but couldn't remember where the door was.
"Yeah?" John asked, looking over at two girls on the other side of the pub.
The head of the department paused, unable to add any comments.
Finished with darts, John gets wrangled into drinking games with the lads.
They were going to do it right here, on this sofa.
“Sorry, what?” John blinked. When did Mary start talking?
I wasn't planning to share my concerns about Mary, of course.
“He said he didn’t have any, sir.” The professor shrugged.
He looked up from the desk and sighed, and placed something into his front shirt pocket. He glanced at Irene with a blank expression.  "Fine, I own you one, then."
"Mollys here," he said to Mary, gesturing with this glass of cider. John watched Molly give Sherlock a big bear hug, much to Sherlock's cringing dismay. After that, she pointed a finger at him, poking him in the chest and frowning, as if scolding him. John wished he could hear what she was saying. He thought that they must know each other, judging from the easy familiarly of their exchange.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Great, it's a date!" Mary gave him a kiss on the cheek. "I'll call you!"
Sherlock sat next to John who was wondering why he was so flippant with the detective. “You are completely wasting our time, detective, we don’t have any information about this explosion.  And why do I have this blanket on?” he said as he removed the blanket provided by the medics.
John's dark thoughts accompanied him all the way home. The long dark car smoothly pulled up to the front of Broomfield Hospital.  The driver was out and opening John’s door before he was ready to exit. He sat in the car, momentarily staring.
"I can tie a pretty tight knot too, you know." Irene continued.
“What? No, not really.” John said, shaking his head, looking a bit confused at Mike. He squirmed in the seat, hoping he wasn't getting Mike's mum's car upholstery too wet.
Sebastian Moran, a hulking footballer in a few of my lectures. I had a run in with him two years ago.
I remembered him.
"Sherlock...was this, um...fight? about ...drugs?"
"Hi Sherlock," she said.
True to form, I saw her look at my lips as I was speaking, then her eyes were drawn down my neck to the very spot I would have been smart to hide. Too late, the mark on my neck  wasn't large, but it was a stark blue and red against my notably sun starved skin. I should have kept my scarf on, but I never expected to see anyone in the far end of the university library, tucked into a corner against the back wall. I was hiding, after all.
Took me a minute to recognize the voice.
"Nah, I don't think that'd work. Molly's already been helping me. There's nothing for it. I'm hopeless."
Ian leans in and whispers in John's ear. "Walk over with me to talk to her and I'll chat up the friend."
“Can you help me get him to hospital?" John called to Sherlock over his shoulder.
His lips are soft and his tongue is warm, and he teases my lips with his until I open my mouth. His right hand wanders down my neck to the buttons of my shirt. I feel a breeze as my shirt falls open and I can't help that a small moan escapes me as he palms my chest.
Who says you have to be a uni student to go to Fresher's Week?
His eyes were closed for most of the trip. He'd open them if I spoke to him. "Sherlock, watch the kerb. Lift your leg. Good. Let's keep going, right?"
“Fine then.” Sherlock hopped up from the bed and turned toward John. “Here, catch.” Tossing John the house keys, he spun on his heel toward the bedroom door as if to leave.
John nodded. “I am.”
The rest of the week went by uneventfully, but the scrape on the side of my leg was driving me crazy.  I was pacing in John's room and constantly scratching. I couldn't  hide it anymore.
Nothing.
So, I'll scold him so he won't see how much I have been admiring him. I don't like when he looks into my eyes, I'm afraid of what he can see there.
“Give it to me John, I can give it to your professor in the morning.” Sherlock offers.
Inside the house, it was apparent it was Christmastime here too. In the corner of the room was a little spruce, decorated with paper chains.  In the middle of the room was a little girl of about 9 and an older boy of about 15 standing over a sleeping figure face down on the sofa. The little girl had been crying, her eyes puffy and her voice hoarse and the boy stood next to her frowning, looking tired.
Sherlock shrugged off his coat. He was the first to speak.
I picked it up in Camden, you can get anything there.
All the lights were on in the building. Chains rattled as the door opened. It was the elderly lady from Speedy's "Oh John, you've come! I didn't know what to do. He won't listen to me, of course. I almost called..." She whispered.
He went up the steps. He ignored Stamford behind him. "John, we should go."
I'm ready.
Jim. John had to admit, he didn’t know Jim very well. The people he hung out with were known to be the well-traveled, well-heeled posh types. People John did not know. John had heard a few rumors about drugs, but he was not certain that they weren’t just rumors, until last night.
John was not sure where exactly to begin, he reached into the pocket of his jeans and felt the paper envelope--still there.
“Thanks Mike, you're a lifesaver.” He admitted quietly.
Unexpected. Anyone who suffered such a viscous beat-down from John would definitely want to retaliate.
What was he doing out here in the fucking city park?
“Mary?”
No answer. I shook him and he stirred. His eyelids fluttered but didn't open. I lay my head on his chest, his heart beating fast, his breathing erratic.
“No really, it’s fine—I’ve known all along....really and I won’t tell anyone. But if I were you--I’d call Mary, I wanted to tell you earlier--she called yesterday, and she sounded angry, so call her and…well…the rest,  that’s none of my business. Just call her, won’t you?”
Lestrade sighed.
"Oi, Watson," Ian pressed a new football jersey into John's hands. "Put it on!! We'll wait---Pub's full of freshers tonight!! Let's go chat up some fit birds!! There's safety in numbers, mate!!"
Mycroft decided to leave for his place close to midnight, promising John he'd be in touch if he heard anything.  John would be facing an anxious, sleepless night until Sherlock got home.
“Nobody’s perfect!” John shouted to him as he left.
Her cheeks got very pink, "Oh, don't tell him I said anything dear!" she whispered hurriedly, patted him on the shoulder and scurried away from the table.
It was end of term, everyone would be going home tomorrow for break, there were parties all over the university. John was out with Mary and her crowd. It got late and they went to another late night pub, it was dark and John insisted that this was his last beer, he wanted to go, Mary didn’t seem to want to leave. They were in the back in a quiet booth sitting with Irene and Jim--whom he had taken a dislike to.
He looked up but not at me. "Yes, let's go." He drained his pint in one gulp and stood, grabbing his coat.
John's brain started to reel. He turned around to face Sherlock. Sherlock's face was illuminated in the light of the refrigerator. His skin was glowing, but the bruise was getting bigger along his cheek. Sherlock's eyes glinted in the light, he looked so young. He backed John up against the edge of kitchen counter and leaned into him.
“Wait Sherlock, where do you live?”
"Thanks." I opened it and poured some into my hand. John reached for the bottle and poured some into his own hand. I rubbed my hands together so it warmed. John followed my lead.
"It's ok, John, I understand its family you have to go."
When we got to my room, Sherlock was still quiet. Looked like I wasn't going to get him to talk--or even relax tonight.
Maybe I won't drink so much tonight.
“What?” his mom sounded confused.
it was Molly. Shit. She never bothers me. It might be important.
"You know, you really shouldn't." she started gently. She took a sip of wine for emphasis, looking at me intently over the rim of the glass.
The last thing Sherlock wanted to do was to go to any party, and most of all a football party, with all the noise and commotion. John would likely have a confrontation with Mary, it was probably in Sherlock's best interest not to be there. Why should he go? What's the worst that could happen? John sees Mary, changes his mind and leaves with her?
He stopped. "Oh." he said and looked at me blankly, as if he forgot I was there. "Um, sorry." His eyes were clouded--as if he was worried.
Not only that, I make chasing criminals and hanging out in unsavory places more than a pastime.
And why couldn’t John stay? Because if he stayed he’d never leave. Because what he wanted and what he needed were two different things.
Looking around, John sees that he is in a kitchen of a big house, 'Mary' again at his side. They both might have looked strange here, in dressing gowns in a stranger's kitchen, except for all the other people in the kitchen are wearing night clothes, too.
I woke in the middle of the night. Had to use the loo.
John went pale. "Did you take it?"
Lestrade stopped by but could not tell them how long it would take to analyse the sample. He put the sample into a plasticine bag and left as quick as he came, promising to call as soon as he knew anything.
“Who was on the phone, John?” Harry asked in a sing song voice.
"You haven't a friendly bone in your entire body." Sherlock, never a big drinker, was starting to feel the second pint. /p>
Mary stopped laughing. “I don’t know what it is between you and Sherlock,” she paused, swallowing, serious, her voice cold. “…but I see how he looks at you and…”
They sat in silence for a moment, then John tentatively said, “Actually, Happy Birthday of course, and I was hoping this could be maybe a belated birthday, um…dinner and my treat, but…um..., it looks like the food will be on the house.”
There was another awkward silence until Mary said, "John, you don't have your brace on anymore!!"
"I'm leaving before the sun comes up. It's best." he looks down at me, glint in his eyes. His hands are on my hips. He leans down to kiss me, just briefly.
The boys both laughed. Sherlock shut the door and stood in front of it.
John sat there deliberating. How was he going to get out of this? Gracefully. ‘Just say no’ and all that. He looked down into this beer, the small bubbles in the foam had disappeared and there was not much beer left in the glass. John could polish it off with one big gulp, of course, but he was stalling for time.
Mycroft turned to John. "John, I can't think why you'd need to accompany me tonight-it's best if you stayed here," he said gently."--in case Sherlock
Not that I liked that term at all, but damn it I still needed him and I was willing to do almost anything to save him from getting tossed out of school. Or tossed in jail. Or whatever they were threatening him with.
I sat up straight.
"So what--you don't care? Sherlock asks, looking down at John, shaking his head and frowning.
This caused and outright laugh from Sherlock. “Ok, John….” He chuckled.
With his long legs extended, his knees almost reached mine. I finished the whole explanation with only a few questions from him. He moved his leg and tipped his knee to make contact with mine, bumping it. I looked up at him and he was smiling at me, eyes twinkling.
I looked in the mirror, behind me, Jim Moriarty was leaning against the door of the loo, blocking any exit from the room.
He walked back with me, chatting all the way. It was very suspicious and out of character for him. He only talks to me if he needs something-- and it's usually drugs.
He turned to me with a hint of a wicked smile, he knew, I think. "Yes." he said. I didn't doubt him.
"How'd ya' know that? Spying on me?" John asked.
And there stood Sherlock in the doorway, slightly unsteady on his feet, coat just hanging around his shoulders, but not quite on his body. "Hello," he said smiling, "Well, I guess I'm at the right place. I think I recognize you two." He pointed at them, squinting.
"Yes." John answered.
“He has a girlfriend –her name is Mary.”
He smiled. I got up, I was hoping not to wake him, but this is a single bed, unfortunately or...
Sherlock is well aware that he scares John. John is scared--Sherlock can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. Sherlock alone scares John and Sherlock's drug use scares him more. Sherlock thinks this problem likely originates in John’s past and has something to do with his home life.  His ?sister or maybe his father—someone in the family is likely to have some kind of substance abuse problem, but Sherlock is uncertain who and what kind. Sherlock wonders if John's father is violent. Is that the fear that Sherlock can see behind John’s eyes?
"Yeah, more," I said, voice tight as I stared at him. My eyes drifted down to his lips, lips that were now just a few inches from mine.
She seemed to back away from Jim a little. She stood a few steps closer to me. Jim reached for her, it was more of a lurch really. She seemed to shrink from his touch.
John addressed his father.
Mike, who witnessed this exchange from the kitchen, tiptoed softly towards the door, opened it quietly and left the flat.
You're not the only person I tried to warn."
"She's very lucky. " the doctor said gently. John looked up at him to see a small smile. "They got her here just in time, really."
John got out of the hot bath and walked back into Sherlock’s bedroom, drying himself off with a flannel. Sherlock was awake. John didn’t have a change of clothes with him, he sat on the edge of the bed and started putting on his pants and socks from earlier today.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
He stared at me intently over the rim of the glass, but I couldn't quite read his thoughts.
I ventured. He shrugged and looked away, staring into the fire.   I didn't ask him where he went or who he was with, because I didn't care. He's an adult.
tomorrow? Are you joking? I have this on tomorrow:
John almost spat out his tea, he started to cough and choke. He was fine really and put his hand up to let Sherlock know he didn't need the Heimlich.
Mary sighed. John turned back to her as he pushed the button to end the call. He looked at her apologetically.
John turned to him,
“I was uncertain, so I asked him to my office after class to explain. He had done his own research sir. Of course, I was doubtful, and I couldn’t imagine where he had gotten the reagents or the equipment—or the time, even-- in order to undertake such an endeavor. He explained himself quite thoroughly, sir. And the complete statistics as well. So of course, I asked to see his notes….” he trailed off again.
It was Mike Stamford from school, shouting at him from the back seat of a car. The mid sized sedan pulled over to the kerb and the door opened. Mike's mum was driving and did not seem to mind the stop.
He still needed to think.
John kept his voice down, it wasn't a large flat. "Sherlock, what are you doing? You--
I lay down next to him and kissed him, reaching for his cock with my hot wet hand. The lube was great, and his breathing changed to hot short moans. I angled myself along with him and took us both in hand. When the friction got too much, he added his lubed hand to mine to make things easier.
"Of course, I want to continue."
Not wanting to stand out, he wore the most boring clothes he had, and tossed on an old jacket from the back of his wardrobe. He wanted to go unnoticed.
Forever is a very long time.
As John looked up to respond to this, he saw that Sherlock was handling a piece of metal the size of deck of cards. As he turned it over in his hands, he held it carefully with a handkerchief.
Bright moonlight was shining through my window. His skin glowed, his dark hair a contrast to how pale he was. His arm was over the duvet, slim neck and muscular shoulder visible. He stirred when I sat up.
During the siege, I was on the floor, flat on my stomach, a jack booted thug pointing a gun at my head-- his foot firmly planted between my shoulder blades.
Sherlock was walking determinedly and as fast as possible, but didn’t exactly know where he was going in the big, confusing house. He wanted to get away fast, find the door,  maybe just to find some air, but maybe go--get out of here. Not finding the door right away, he polished off the beer and went to look for more.
"Although women are at more risk of dying an unnatural death at the hands of a male perpetrator, not so, in this case." he continued.
Mary was right the queue jumper bands worked a charm. We got right in.
John fell face first onto the sofa as Sherlock went to fetch the duvet. He dumped the duvet and pillows onto him as he lay there. John stirred and sat up.
“Sherlock, why does that man think I’m your date?”
John made a feeble attempt at a smile.
Sherlock doubted that he'd go to the party, despite what John wanted. He found small talk with inebriated people tiresome at best. And at worst? In the past, he'd avoid most parties because it was so easy to get into arguments with the uni students. Unless Jim Moriarty was there, then Sherlock had a reason to go, to get drugs. If John wanted him to give up using, he'd best avoid parties and Jim. It was just too much temptation.
"Experiments." Sherlock frowned and gave a clipped answer as he shut the flat door locking it.
"I've been thinking about this all night--since we got the call from Lestrade." I put a hand on my forehead, I'm getting a headache.
Most of the party goers had cleared out well before the explosion and only the boys and a few passers by were still there.
If this was going to continue--
That John Watson, soldier, doctor, reliable and stable, dependable, rational--kind--had decided to take up with me, for any amount of time, was not to be believed.
Jim headed straight for the back of the club and they were ushered into a private room. It was darker still, but the music was not as loud as the front room and was less of an assault on Sherlock's ears. As Sherlock's eyes adjusted, he could make out shapes of people sitting at tables and booths.  Purple lights illuminated the four corners of the room, giving it a somewhat suspended feeling.
"Yeah.
Damn. I was staring. And got caught.
John felt like he had just gulped down a large glass of cold water.
John broke away, not wanting to. He was flushed and shaking his head above Sherlock. John looked at Sherlock pleadingly, eyes wide and then squeezed shut, then wide again,  “Oh, Sherlock, I'm sorry…I…”
Sherlock was quiet, then started to explain, voice hoarse. "John, I--it wasn't." he shook his head.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sherlock stopped. He slowed his pace and walked toward John.
“Yeah… yeah, that’s Sherlock. Excuse me, Mary. I have to see about something…..” John jumped up and started purposefully towards the front of the pub.  John disliked Jim so intensely that he was certain that this could not be good.
Bloody hell, Molly, I can't tell you, of all people.
John blinked, “Yes? Um what?”
Of course, I follow him, I'd follow him anywhere.
"Yes, Mrs. H." Sherlock swung the door open wide and took John upstairs. He followed behind to steady him and make sure John didn't fall.
Jim at my elbow. Didn't see him come in. "Nice to see you, Sherlock," he whispered in my ear.
Why? It wasn't being used at all.
As I left I caught hold of my temper, or I would have slammed the door dramatically. Glad that I didn't, because Mary Morstan sat in the study lounge adjacent to John's room, apparently awake at 5 am, feet tucked under her, book balanced on her knees. I glanced her way, darkly.
Jim and Irene stared at him, nursing their drinks.
"Weren't you going anywhere you wanted regardless of the ankle tag?" I shakily raised my glass.
“What are you talking about, Jim?”
He's a smooth driver, alert and competent, never hard on the gas or the breaks. He navigates the London streets like a professional driver, rather than the shadowy government figure he really is.
I have a meeting with Lestrade that I can't miss. I can make it to NSY from the Baker Street Underground Station in about 15 minutes. I smoked a quick cigarette and felt a tinge of guilt knowing John would disapprove.
"That said, you've certainly created a stir in London with your CCTV stunt. I'll have to come up with a suitable explanation for why it was necessary. I'm beginning to see why you and my brother are....friends."
"I like a level playing field." she said seriously. "Keeps things fair."
He stared out the dirty bus window, not able to see London speed by. Mary held on to his hand during the trip, but he wasn't aware of her warm hand at all.
"John's not my boyfriend. Never was."  So, that's why. Getting me alone. What for? Business proposition, game of cards?
"There is no such hall, John."
what ever it was.
Anytime they were together it was quick and hurried, always in fear of someone coming in. Today they could take their time, but right now no one wanted that.
John stared at the front of the hospital. The windows bright as the sun moved lower in the late April sky.
As she opened the door abruptly, right outside, standing much too close to the door--as if listening in--was Sherlock. He stood straight up.
I didn't know him at all. What I knew was that he didn't have a history of being perfectly honest and forthcoming, now did he? The room swam before me. He's off the hook with the police, he may just not come back. I may never see him again. He didn't say anything when he left.
John took a step closer to Sherlock, sliding his hand up along the underside of Sherlock's arm until he held his elbow and chuckled, “Yeah, you almost gave me a heart attack today, but I sort of liked it.”
He still didn't answer me.
John had no push back in him. He looked at Mary and sighed. When do you let friends know your secrets? Is there ever a good time to drop these bombs? Can they be scheduled for better circumstances?
His head and heart are aching. He ignores his growling stomach— no time for dinner, but thinks of his parents, keeping vigil at Harry’s bedside. Anger is a companion to his sorrow. He is angry both at Harry and himself.
"Bye, Molly."  I said. This was inevitable, one way or another. I waited about 5 minutes, stood up, put on my coat and scarf and left the library.
Walking to the loo, Sherlock realized that he was angry with the world, but most of all he was angry with himself. He wasn't entirely sure why he was here. Too late now, he'd have to continue with this charade and follow it to it's natural end.
Outside, in the cold night air, I wasn't able to keep up with his long strides. "Sherlock, slow down! Where are you going?" I asked, breathless, as I trotted beside him.
We were at an impasse.
Sherlock leaned down to kiss him and they stood there for a few minutes, against the door of John's room, with no sounds in the flat except two rapidly beating hearts, both forgetting that Stamford could come out for a glass of water or to use the loo.
I waited. When he didn't back away or punch me, I leaned down to kiss him. John responded in kind, kissing me back gently, sighing. He ran his left hand up my arm and moved forward another inch, so that he pressed against me, slightly.
"How?" No one can help me. I was doomed to be a drain on society. I was so fuckin' miserable.
The little party outside the door breaks up. It's almost lights out.
As I crawled over Sherlock
Mary was talking to me.
"You don't. It's fine, really." John continued.
“He’s upstairs dear. Go right on up, then." She then gave John a small smile and a conspiratorial whisper. "Doors unlocked.”
“Now you look less angry with me.” John said quietly, looking up at his friend.
"'Taken out'? Meaning--killed?" Ludicrous, thought John.
I wanted to memorize every inch of John- his muscles, his scars. I wanted to take my time, tracing every tan line with my tongue, but John was impatient. He's playful in bed, he tossed me on my back a few times, getting me laughing so hard my sides ached.
to see?
“Hello, Mary.” said Sherlock, now holding two beers---one in each hand. “Nice to see you.”
As soon as he was gone, Irene turned on Jim.
“...this all yours, then? It's nice.” John walked into the flat and looked around the large front room.
"I also took the liberty of calling John's parents to let them know that their son was unharmed in the explosion."
"Speaking," John looked over at Mary apologetically.
John sat on the worn lobby sofa waiting, but he was not sure what he was waiting for. He was grateful for the warmth, but his clothes were not drying fast enough. His socks were wet inside his trainers.
And whether or not you’ll remember it tomorrow. It’s over. It’s ok. I think I know what’s going on." She spoke very close to his face, looking directly into his eyes.
John's next week at school did not go well, but that was no different from the previous weeks.
In the dim light of my room, I sat up, leaning on my hand. Sherlock's sleeping face was peaceful and calm, inches from me.
"John, this is my brother Mycroft." Sherlock said rolling his eyes and reaching into a take away bag and removing a Chinese take away box.
“Day off then!” Mike said cheerfully.
The boy waved his arm toward the house. "Shall we?"
It's just sex, after all.
"Where are we going?" Sherlock stopped in the snow.
He knew he was taking a chance that he’d run into Jim Moriarty-he was often out late- and that didn’t bother him.
But once he got out onto the street, he wasn't yet clear about what he was doing, ot where he was going for that matter.
He didn’t even need his own brother.
I turned it over in my hand. It was a small white package, tiny. It was firm, but slender, folded over like a small envelope. "When?"
John was getting around well on the new brace. Half way through the pint, I decided beer wasn't so bad.
His voice is quiet, "I was afraid-- I think, for the first time in my life."
John looked at his feet and said in small voice, "Well...I'm meeting someone." he cleared his throat.
"I think you can let John out of the cuffs too, Lestrade. I think he will come along quietly to the station, won't you, John?" I put a hand on John's shoulder and nodded.
"What?" asks Ian, perplexed.
And what would Mycroft say? 'Not to get attached' to a place, to a thing, to a person….
Apparently, when Jim Moriarty dropped the charges against me, he planned to get a more
Caught again.
Sherlock laughed.
Mary looked from the tiny envelope back to John, eyes wide.
"I like him," she said. "If anyone is helping you, they're all right in my book." she had a nice soft smile. I thought back to what Sherlock said about Mary fancying me and body language. Can I figure that out, too? She
I turned and crossed my arms in front of me, leaning against the sink. "What do you want?"
Sherlock said, out of breath.
I closed the door quietly when I left and walked to the loo. I'm nervous. If I'm honest with myself, it's probably about what Mary said when we were out to get curry. Sherlock spending time with me. So what if he does?
I panted.
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” he turned to the sound of his name and saw Molly Hooper, Mike Stamford and Liz--Mike’s girlfriend waving at him from down the street.
I'm trying to answer his questions in that flirty manner that he has, but I'm abysmal at it. Do I have something else
Then laughter.
Sherlock looked up at John and smiled, “I guess we'd better get up to the house and change for dinner and the Christmas service.”
Mycroft didn’t exactly say it was a secret, but John knew better.
"Well, this must be bad-- very bad indeed. And what
"Did something happen while we were gone? John, you're not making any sense." his father asked, irritated.
If I had a pistol, I might fire it at the door, so glad I don't have a pistol.
He stood up, stepping into his pants, facing away from me. My stomach felt cold.
And now I know what this is, but I snort a line anyway.   I felt immediately warm, my legs tingling. A wave a nausea hit but I didn't retch. My head fell back and the room tipped to the side. I tried to stand. Didn't succeed.
What am I looking for? Am I hoping to run into John at the pub? What would I say if I saw him?
'This time?' John wondered, reaching himself into the take away bags.
get it out of the way.
“Well, well,
"He put it in my pocket." Was this worse than if I actually took it from him?
Can't remember when he slid into the group, can't remember how many pubs we visited. I had to admit that my powers of observation were dulled.
That fact that John thought of himself as some kind of caretaker or rescuer—well, that was his problem, not Sherlock’s. He didn’t need cared for or rescued.
John turned red.
The definition of easy is
I'm glad I have something to do.
Last year at uni was a setback for John as well as a breakthrough.
"Good-- isn't it? How was the stuff I gave you before?"
I take Sherlock's warning seriously. But what can we do about it tonight?
scolding me. Where's the door?
He was quite alarmed when he saw Sherlock and Jim leave the pub together.
Sherlock.
Mary, at John’s side, was shrill and gaping. “John! Whatever are you doing?” she crouched down and bent over Jim. “Jim, Jim are you alright? I’m so, so sorry. I have no idea what came over John--you better have a good reason for this!! Although I can’t imagine why!”
"His father's is listed."
"Still seems gutted about Mary." Ian states.
he heard shouting from upstairs , which could only be Sherlock Holmes. Then,
I'm frozen. He's holding on to the back of the chair with his left hand as he trails along my jaw with his fingertips. He gently touches my lower lip with his thumb. He has effectively pinned me to the chair. He's practically sitting in my lap. All I'd have to do is sit up and dump him off, but he leans in to kiss me before I can make up my mind.
“No sir.” Lunch was looking doubtful.
In my free time, I  wandered to Camden Market--force of habit. And as luck would have it, didn't run into any of my previous
221 Baker Street
John whispers up at Sherlock. He doesn't seem as drunk as he was before.  "It's a problem I have, have always had."
“I could ask the same of you, Jim.” Sherlock said, glancing in his cup, sounding bored.
I expressed my doubts to Mike. "That's not the John Watson I know!!" he said, slapping me on the back after knowing me for two bloody days.
“The wine? You weren’t listening. It’s fine, I'll order.” Sherlock smiled.
He leaned forward to kiss me and there was nothing fragile about it. Hospital doors don't lock, but I didn't care. I missed him.
"Mary!" John turned to see her, all deck out in a sparkly mini skirt and heels.
I knocked on the door and opened it a crack. He was standing at the bedside, packing a suitcase. He looked up.
Up the small stoop and into the front hall the boys trudged. John was certainly happy  to see Sherlock but the last thing the thought he’d do was almost punch his best friend in the face before properly saying hello.
He looked at me. It had been a few weeks. I'm sure he remembered who I was.
he drained his wine glass in one gulp.
But he had something to say about all of them. when they left, he'd look up from his notes to offer an opinion about them: Mary--
I spent a good deal of time feeling sorry for myself, but that was slowly changing.
John gives Mycroft a hard stare, suddenly, surprisingly angry. “Why you?”
"Oh no, I can't Mary. I have...Sherlock...tonight." John gestures with his thumb over his shoulder, indicating I'm somewhere behind him.
"Comes in handy." I answered quietly, looking out the window.
John was momentarily at a loss for words. Did Sherlock live here? After this morning, was he at the wrong flat? His heart sank.
Jim suddenly looked angry.
Third times a charm. He's leaning against the door and I'm stand in front of him. "Tomorrow's Saturday." I inch a little closer and tug on the lapel of his jacket.
And that's when he saw him. Jim Moriarty came snaking through the misty room and slung an arm around Mary's shoulder. He whispered in Mary's ear and she giggled. "John, this is Jim," she shouted over the base, the whites of her eyes now looking blue.
Sherlock walked back to Mike and John and they helped Mike get to his feet.
I find I cannot relax like I see others doing. Relaxing, chatting with friends, laughing. I'm always doing something. I can't sit, I pace.  My mind is always elsewhere. Take the club, for example, ceilings high, walls painted black. Loud, poorly lit, filled with soapy, watery foam and writhing bodies everywhere. I walked around to inspect the set up. Foam machines in four corners of the very large room belched foam from four directions, obscuring the floor. Hazard number one, for drunk students to slip, fall and injure themselves. Obvious.
“Yeah, but I’m meaner.” Said John, diving for the coat.
They sat at the table in the kitchen, Harry having gone to her room.
Johns eye brows went up. "Was I? sorry, deep in thought, I guess"
“Mary, Mary! Don’t be so mad! It’s nice to see you!” John was feeling a little drunker than three beers should have made him, when he realized he didn’t eat any dinner.
He sighed. "Fine. I'm sorry that I don't understand. I'll ask her to go." he shrugged and walked away. I shut the door, curled up into a ball and fell asleep with my clothes on.
Mary, though.
do you think you were doing?”
Once they got to Mycroft and he saw that Sherlock was alive and coherent, he took his leave.
"Thanks, but I'll pass." I side stepped him, but he followed.
“I…I have to ask you…something.” John said quietly, cautiously.
Sherlock left it to The Yard to actually apprehend the killer, leaving with John to get the train to his parent's house.
He pressed the answer button.
It was Friday. I took Mary back to her room, kissed her on the cheek and thanked her for all of her help.
I took the tube back to  Baker Street and walked the few blocks to the flat. I never let myself consider a relationship with John in any way but friendship--and even that was a reach. I'm not friendship material. I'm not even flat mate material. I toss my clothes on the floor, I do messy experiments on the kitchen table. I don't put the bins out.
"Sherlock--I have to tell you. I think, in my fervor...last night...that I may have given you..." I cleared my throat. "...a love bite." my face flushed.
And just like that he was gone, leaving Sherlock still wondering why it was so bloody important for John to have a flat of his own.
"Of course I'll come with you," Mary offered, although John did not ask her to join him.
“Yeah, sure.” Came Sherlock’s distracted reply, as he opened the curtains of the kitchen window and peered at the sill.
everyone talks about. My groin ached and I was so hard I thought I would pass out.
They were bloody awful. But helpful.
The pub cleared out when the police arrived. Eventually, I was sitting in a chair by myself talking to a policeman and then handcuffed.  I had just gotten myself out of a terrible academic situation, now this. I had no one to blame but myself.
Standing in the doorway of the loo, he saw Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bath, unbuttoning his shirt. John peeked in. “Oi, Sherlock?” he ventured.
John took them back into the family sitting room and gave them Harry's clothes. He hugged both his parents.  His mum had calmed down a bit, but was still tearful.
Sherlock looked down at John as he took a gulp of the beer. Then he toed off his shoes.
I dumped my books on a seat and John handed me a pint. This place was packed with uni kids. It was loud, sweaty and John and his mates appeared to be in their element.
With little money in his pocket, John reasoned that walking was his best bet to get to the university. He had no umbrella, but was hopeful that the rain would let up.
"That's probably not the reason." Sherlock interrupts him, voice cold. "I actually don't know why you like me."
I am only going to add one epilogue chapter to this to tie up some loose ends, but the story itself is pretty complete.
John's voice was cold and slow. He took a long, shaky, uneven breath.
spend the night in your bed. That
Jim's voice was loud outside the door. They both froze, looking at each other, then ran for the exit door that led to an alley between the buildings.
John was sitting at the top of the stairs of the coal cellar in the pitch black. He kept his eyes closed, watching small lights behind his lids swirl and jump, leaving little trails behind. It was blessedly cool and quiet as the party thumped along on the other side of the cellar door.
I reluctantly tore my eyes away from the page and frowned. "Erm.." John was already in the kitchen and back with two fingers of whisky. He handed me the glass. He never gave me a chance to answer.
Which made my getting to him, even more important, maybe life saving.
Sherlock knew very well that there would be no sleep for him tonight. He didn’t expect to hear from John until tomorrow at the very least. He stared at John’s paper. Best get that out of here now. The responsibility of that small sheaf was pulsating at him from the kitchen table. Drop it off at the professor’s office and move on with life.
Sherlock, on the other hand, was not quite so sure. "I wouldn't underestimate him John, you don't know what he is capable of."
"Fine," I said. I really didn't want to talk.
We sat silently for awhile in the office before Inspector Lestrade walked in. I think Sherlock and I had pretty much sobered up by then.
"Leave? "You just got here! You haven't had a chance to see Harry yet!" his mum's eyes started to well up with tears.
He was avoiding me.
The front of the pub seemed so far away. He had to go up there and make sure-- John slowed his pace---- he wasn’t sure what he was making sure about. He tried to take some deep breaths and slowed his pace even more.
she started, looking down and shaking her head. "Is he seeing someone? Do you know?" she looked at me, eyes wide and her voice just a whisper now. "Does he have a girlfriend, because... I know it's silly of me but I think I saw a
"Mycroft?" John was incredulous. He walked around to the passengers side and opened the door.
“I’m fine. You know, just knackered.”
“I’m not sure that makes any difference if you plan on self-destruction.”
He wanted to go to dinner and suggested a restaurant, no less. I wasn't even sure this was allowed. He walked right up to Mycroft and requested his card. Mycroft handed it to him and we were on our way.
At the very least--lights out at the club, party over. At the very worst, electrocution and death.
Mrs. Hudson shook her head from behind the counter, "Sorry Dear, he's always like that."
But Sherlock was smiling, pulling a metal key ring out of his pocket, keys jingling.
So I'm out, but I'm not looking.
The cold air on the walk home brought John back a bit and Sherlock was happy he didn’t have to carry him. He would have done it of course, but it would have been terribly awkward.
“I don’t know mum, maybe he’s love sick.” Harry giggled.
John reached down and touched Mike on the shoulder. “Mike, can you sit up?”
Can I make it better? Vouch for him at all? I tried to tell Lestrade how helpful Sherlock had been helping me with chemistry.  And that actually it was Sherlock that broke up the fight with me and Jim.
“I’m good,” says Sherlock, moving toward John and wrapping his hands around each side of John’s waist. John gets up on his toes and tips his head up to kiss him and places a hand on Sherlock's smooth muscular chest, feeling his heart beating wildly, like he had just run up the stairs.
"Oh, but he didn't." Sherlock smiled, shuffling hurriedly through files and folders, quite satisfied with himself.
John had a pain in his chest, as though he just got punched, but Molly didn’t cause it. “Right, it's ok.” he said, giving a sigh of relief. “Molly, how are you?”
"Sorry,
"Are you a university administrator?" John asked Mycroft.
She gave him a look back of sweet, calm confusion and put her hand over the mouth piece of the telephone. Mrs. Watson started to speak in a stage whisper.
“Sherlock, Sherlock! That’s all I hear from you, John!! You know, we shouldn’t even be having this conversation--because you’re
But John reached for me, grabbed my dressing gown, and pulled me into a rougher kiss. He pushed the dressing gown off my shoulders where it pooled on the floor.  "We can move to the bedroom." he says hoarsely, in between kisses. His warm hand palming me through my trousers.
“I sent you a post card. I didn’t hear back.” He said quietly.
“Hello.” Sherlock said calmly to his flatmates.
The beach ball went overhead again, Sherlock jumped up and smacked it and it went sailing far into the other room, “Good one, mate!” he heard someone call out.
“That's amazing! Absolutely amazing. But why are you holding on to that? It should be with Scotland Yard.” John was very worried that trouble would come from holding onto a piece of evidence, from a bombing, no less.
Endeavoring to plan ahead, Sherlock said quietly, “John, how about we head back to the flat?”
“Sherlock, I can’t, I can’t do this, at all, if you do.” It felt good, getting that off his chest.
I felt badly for him, of course. I'm not heartless, like everyone assumes. I walked over and offered to help, but he just scolded me.
“Good morning, John,” he heard Sherlock say, not looking up.
I turned it over in my hand as Jim's words turned over in my head.
Mary wanted to get Sherlock out of the way so she could go out with me. She knocked on my door one night, sat on my bed and told me the whole thing. At first silent, cheeks pink, head down, she hesitantly began her story. "I fancied you, John, from the first time I saw you." She shifted uncomfortably on my bed. "Of course, I'm embarrassed about it now. But you never did fancy me-it was always him,
About Jim mostly. John crossed streets with barely a look at traffic. His head was spinning with things to ask Sherlock. John was forced at one point to stop and wait for cars to pass. As he stood there, catching his breath, he hoped Sherlock was actually at the flat. Not only did John want to discuss Jim and maybe Molly...., he also wanted to bring up some more mundane topics, one that may make Sherlock angry. Too many things. John sighed.
Mycroft said,
"No wait, please. No, it's something good, I promise,
John, Sherlock and Mike were of no help when interviewed by police. An ambulance took Mike to hospital.
Jim laughed. “Nothing. I doubt John will be back, I’ll walk you home.” Jim got up, dusted himself off and he and Mary walked out the door into the cold December air.
Sherlock lay his clothes neatly over the chair. I could see him glance shyly at me out of the corner of his eye. I don't know who was feeling more uncomfortable, him or I.
Sherlock sighed and his shoulders slumped a bit.  He shook his head, eyes closed. “I’m not angry with you, John.”
“Your face is funny Harriet.” John stared at his dinner plate, trying to feign some interest, but he wasn’t hungry anymore.
Who tells me it just may cost him another term at uni. To add to the educational debt he's racking up here. That his family can ill afford, I reckon.
John roped me into a drinking game. It was---fun.
I didn't need his help.  I was going to handle the footballers my own way.
Sighing in resignation, Sherlock reluctantly agreed to go along with them to the pub. Just as well. They were very insistent. It was pretty apparent that they had already been to a few pubs earlier. The trio were grinning maniacally, cheeks flushed. Ok, maybe a pint--but that was all he would agree to. The new fixative could wait.
But Sherlock was positively lighthearted and in the best mood that I've seen him in, ever. He ordered a bottle of red wine.
Students had a large plastic beach ball and were hitting it from one side of the flat to the other.
John walked into the kitchen with a trace of a small smile still on his face.
John laughed and rubbed his cold, blue hands together for warmth.  "Right, I just needed to go out and get a breath of fresh air. It's just too stuffy in here." John couldn’t relax. He didn’t know why and he didn’t have anyone he could confide in.
John likes to kiss, I've gathered. He has me on my back now, He's working hard on my clothes. I could help him--sit up, take them off, but he's enjoying himself, what's the rush? His hands are everywhere, strong, firm hands, John has me pinned, I'm underneath him and my shirts off now. I'm  aching to get the rest of my clothes off. He's moving too much, I grab him and pull him close and press our lips together, he slows and breathes into the kiss, tongue searching for mine, his soft lips are open for me. I hold him still and kiss him and play with his mouth, holding his bottom lip between mine. I suck on his bottom lip a little, then let go. He lets out a little groan and whispers my name.
They don't even realize they're doing it. But, you don't always look back." He cleared his throat and looked down at the chemistry notes.
"John, that's a really bad idea."
He pulled away.
Sherlock walks away and brings back a pillow and duvet from the bedroom for John.
Otherwise I wouldn't stop--
"You can't just waltz in here, off the street, drunk off your arse and fall into bed with me."
I muttered under my breath, words unexpectedly clear in the quiet hall.
I was seething with anger when Sherlock left the pub with Jim.
He snickered. "Yeah, fine."
Sherlock took exception to the way the game was played and argued the logic of some of the rules. John spent a good portion of the game talking Sherlock out of changing the rules ad hoc.
"Wait," he whispered. "I have--" he reached down under the bed and grabbed a bottle of lube.
"What about Dad?
“Do I need to call your brother?”
John stretches out longwise on the bed stretches all his muscles. He lets out a groan. Moonlight pours through the window in the bedroom. The boys are lying on their backs, staring at the ceiling.
“My wallet was in my flat.” John shook his head sadly.
I went over my options, which were slim, I just decided to start out on the street. I walked to his school and stood in front the residence hall. I know which window is his, it was dark. I doubt he is there. Possible. but doubtful
“Right, see you at school.” The line disconnected. John looked sadly at the phone, wishing that had gone better, longer. Wished it'd been anything but a phone call.
Distracted, mooning about.
“All about you. About your eyes and your laugh and your experiments and your deductions.” By this point, John’s voice was soft and slow.
I countered.
“Defense? I wouldn’t say that I felt like I was in any
What a mess he’d got himself in with Mary and Sherlock.  John scrubbed his head with shampoo, hoping the blood would rush there to offer him new solutions. Harry’d have a good laugh at him and may still, for his delicate 'predicament'. John wanted to laugh at himself, but he knew better. The situation also wanted to make him cry at the same time. He slowly put his head back under the water to rinse the shampoo, the water was getting cold, he’d better get out soon.
"Right." he put his finger up to his lips. "Sshhh. Don't tell him I was here, Molly don't." John looked guilty. "He doesn't like pubs, really. Not his thing. Not his area. "
at him, obviously flirting.  I walked straight over there, but John gave me a task, so I went in search of the server.
I have been studying, sitting, reading and visiting doctors this whole term. Where are all of those stories people tell about all the fun they had at uni? When will the fun start?
"Pub down the street, meeting Irene. I'll make it worth your while. Promise." Jim sort of mumbled under his breath. He continued on, Sherlock followed. He had just enough alcohol that his craving for drugs was intensified, that's how it worked. Jim probably knew that. Get him a little drunk and he'd be more suggestible than he was when sober. Sherlock briefly considered backing out, but pressed onward, despite warnings from his guilty conscience.
“Yes, I know. Sometimes you have to look harder for your present.” Sherlock says, arm around John as they both fall back to sleep on a cold London morning.
Here with the chavs?” Jim asked in his smarmy tone.
It was Christmas.
"No, no I am, Sherlock, I am."
"Sure. Come in." I opened the door and ushered her in. "I just want to tell you... I was out last night...drinking and I have a hangover. So I...." I know I was squinting and holding my head. The sun in my room was too bright.
Thankfully, there was no one on the floor tonight. Maybe everyone was at the pub. We've been lucky, Sherlock and I. No one thinks, um-- no one suspects--well--
And waited.
Flattering almost, if I thought for one minute that John was going to do anything about it.
...."I worry about her all the time. Doing who knows what, hanging out with...with..." he gestured to the young man siting in front of him, who, for all the world looked like he was off to study hour, rather than a dos house. Baby-faced Sherlock in front of him looked to be about 12. John was sure there was more to this story but he didn't want to alienate this 'informant' of his.
"Well, I think Molly fancies you--." I offered, smiling.
"And you love him enough never to ask. That's why you're perfect for each other."
“Oh.” John sat down on the sofa and put his head in his hands.
I'm not stupid.
Sherlock picked it up. Luckily, John had scribbled the building name and office number in the margins. The sun was setting and Sherlock had an idea. Rolling up the paper, he tucked it into the pocket of his coat.
He was sitting now on the edge of the bed, head down. Wednesday night in the residence hall was very quiet.
“Raz, I was afraid to take them from Wiggins.”
Against my better judgement, I follow him, warning bells never stopped me before. It's just me and him in the back room. It's spacious-- sofas, card tables, mirrors on the walls. Looks like a gaming room.
"Well, we'll have to do something about that."
It's better this way. I can't take any more of his pouting. Other people have begun to notice. so...
"Very good, John."
Reflexively, John jumped up and gave a sharp turn, his right thigh getting caught on the table leg, practically taking the table with him.
p>Sherlock woke with a clanging headache. The clock on his nightstand read that it was 3:30 pm. Saturday after noon he wondered? He hoped it wasn’t Sunday.
"Sherlock, why not?  'should be fun." I put my things down on the bed. I was going.
Apparently, Lestrade and Sherlock knew each other and have know each other for some time.
“Um, John,  I…”   Sherlock began, when a long, shiny black car pulled up beside the boys.
"Mikes told me lots of stories, never thought I'd meet 'cha!!" Liz was smiling much too wide for Sherlock's comfort.
“Is that all you have?” Mike asked, looking down at John's small case.
I had changed my mind quite a few times.  Finally, I had decided firmly that it wasn't me he was trying to get drunk--it was himself.
up if I can get to supper.
Comes in handy to be thought of as crazy.
“Oh, there was an older couple here earlier….” She ventured shyly, looking around.
After the first time, I awoke in an empty bed, the other side cold, duvet thrown back.
"I don't think you're listening to me."
John met Mary Morstan the first week of uni, she was in all of his classes, anatomy, physiology, dissection. They just seemed to fall in together--along with Molly and Stamford--they formed a little study group.
He gracefully stepped from the desk to the bed and sat down next to me, legs curled up, knees under his chin. I budged over a bit to let him in. "I'm sure you have a very good reason why you were standing on my desk, feeling the wall."
She told John she wanted to take break from the relationship. That she was going to ‘think about things’ while on break and then they could see ‘how it goes’ when they got back to school.
"Sherlock, I don't know how you know that and I don't think I want to know."  Lestrade held the bag up to the light were it could just be made out, the tiniest pink feather, the size of a piece a confetti.
He saw his parents at the end of the hallway, making their way back. "John! Where are you going?" he father asked when they caught up to him.
The CCTV camera was mounted on a light pole, pointed at the parking lot. The snow was coming steadily down, starting to cover the cars. John tried to gauge just where the camera was pointing, trying to scope out where he needed to stand.
Jim walked over to the door and locked it.
“Save it, Sherlock.” Mary said as she walked away, disappearing into the party.
Jim reappeared with three drinks and slid into the booth on the other side of Sherlock. He was pinned in.
We walk back to my residence hall, just chatting. Not about school, not about trials or police, or bodily injuries.
"Allright," he said, eyes wide.
Never thought he'd show up, but he did. We met irregularly over a few weeks during the first term. Never thought it'd work, either. I had been so disappointed by my lack of progress after the accident. Tutoring with Sherlock was enormous help and my marks did improve.
“John, John! Stop! Stop it! I’ll give you the bloody cocaine!!-- if you just-- stop! Please, you’ve made your point. It’s fine.” Sherlock's cheeks were quite pink from laughing so hard.
"I can't believe he walked in the door with you." She shook her pretty head with disbelief and admiration. "You're right--he would never give me the time of day. What's your plan?"
"What is it?" asked John.
Harriet Watson was younger than her brother John, but she was no fool. John's parents may not think twice about the phone call, but his sister would listen carefully, mull over the event and note any inconsistencies in John's behavior or tone.   He looked over at his sister. She had been through a lot in her young life and John knew she still had quite a few secrets, herself.
Hash pipes are very tiny, almost cute, if I said such things, this one is white, ceramic and made in Turkey. Don't ask where I got it.
I asked to speak to the manager and tried to explain the hazard to a few of the bouncers, but no one wants to listen to a drunk uni student (that would be me). I hoped I was wrong, i did manage to mention it to a few of the students who would listen.
He backed up and thought he did a pretty good job of writing "MYCROFT HOLMES" across the parking lot in the snow.
Sherlock turns over and stares at the ceiling-- calculating. He knows he has to be careful with John not to make a wrong move that would completely scare him off. To do just what he wants, to keep him and not to lose him.
I went to class with a heavy heart that week. I missed him and I wanted to apologize. I wished he'd talk to me, so I could just say I'm sorry. My feet were lead as I dragged myself to and from each building.
Angelo’s was not far. As soon as they walked in the owner approached them.
shown up at places where Sherlock (and I, truth be told) were...coincidence? Maybe, but there were more pressing questions.
"Give me my phone back, git--and your not coming with me!"
"And why do you know which of the London police stations are open 24 hours?" John asked.
Inspector Lestrade here is trying to determine if he was wrong in granting me bail the first time 'round and wondering now if I should be taken to jail expeditiously to await my court hearing."
