There’s a space beside him on the mattress where Cas should be. Dean can feel the shape of him, the weight of him, when he wakes, and he nuzzles into the pillow like Cas is still there and will feel it. The heat is still on him, but it’s fading - his skin itches to be touched, but without its previous urgency, and now more than the constant hunger he’s mostly aware of the soreness of his overworked body, the way his muscles have fallen slack, the tenderness between his thighs and in the crack of his ass where he’s been wet for so long. He’s fucking thirsty as hell. Maybe they’ll let him have a bath once he’s got the all-clear to be unlocked, and that’s a nice thought
‘We will continue with the hypnosis treatment,’ agrees the alienist smoothly, and Castiel exhales with relief.
, they had called it, also. It means they believe he has laid with Dean again - fucked him, Dean would say; knotted him. Sodomised him.
They’re just words. They’re just words, of course, and words don’t mean much, words come cheap and don’t hold anyone to anything. But all the same, Cas is right there, and his hands are still on Dean’s shoulders, and the initial shock of fear and adrenaline is wearing off, and before Dean can think he just - he just drops his head forward, so that his forehead is resting against Cas’ shoulder, and lets him take his weight. And Cas does; right there in the middle of the road, beneath the beating sun, the two horses waiting patiently beside them.
‘Hello, Dean,’ says Castiel from behind him, and Dean jumps so sharply he bangs his elbow hard on the larder door and bites back the profanity.
The guy watches him appraisingly. ‘No. We eat ‘em, so.’ He stands for a second, and then adds, ‘You wanna stick around for a minute, I can let you in to feed ‘em. They’ll let you pick them up, most of them. Not that white one, she’s a pain in the ass, but the rest of them.’
Castiel considers which question he should ask next. Either he is especially bad at conversation around Dean, or it’s especially easy to mis-step around him, and for some reason he desperately wants to do well. Naturally, he leaves it too long before his next response. ‘Are you still in touch?’
Before he can stop himself, a low growl crawls out of Castiel’s throat. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees his mother and uncle look at him, startled.
‘That’s - Dean - you mustn’t - if you speak like that again I’ll be forced to -’ he chokes on the words, suddenly furious, suddenly scared; very much wishing he was fully dressed again. ‘That’s
In the 19th century, the postmaster was a political patronage job and their political affiliation played a role in it, which is why he might prioritise appeasing an influential political family like the Miltons. I can't find any 1890s photos of the Lawrence post office, but here's a cute one of the interior about 20 years later! https://www.kshs.org/km/items/view/219388.
He’s spent most of the day panicking about Cas, ever since he walked out of the service this morning - and it already feels much longer ago. Dean had gone straight back to the house first, obviously, but there had been no sign of him; his second thought had been one of those insane walks Cas does, up towards the lake, but he’d walked up that way for an hour and the sun had been too high, and he hadn’t even been sure of the route much after that. By the time he’d come home and started working on dinner, it had been in the hope rather than the expectation that Cas might show up halfway through. He’d even come to church for the evening service and sat through Inias’ cover, and then afterwards he’d just… stayed. As if he knew this was where Cas would come back to.
funny, and the reason it isn’t funny is that Gabriel is entirely correct. Rehoming an omega from a Refuge is - unusual, far too unusual for his family to like the idea, but at least it had been built upon good Christian values. A noble calling, even, something Castiel could tell his parishioners as he talked to them about
‘Don’t ever make me do it again,’ and it should sound like a threat, but Cas’ voice is as shaky as Dean feels, and it’s more like a plea. ‘Dean.’
There’s a dark, damp patch on the carpet in front of the altar, the sort that looks like it’s gonna stain. Dean hates his fucking body.
Dean can’t help it; he looks desperately to Michael. ‘Sir-’ no, wrong one. ‘Alpha - please- please, I did it to myself.’ He’s losing it, his voice wobbling. ‘There’s gonna be - it’s gonna be - I was in heat, please. Please don’t let him touch me,’ god, god, oh god. ‘Please-’
Dean reappears at his side - he is obviously trying hard to be light-footed, and not having a lot of success - and silently maneuvers a very small, very full glass of something into Castiel’s hand.
Dean gives him the same long, hard look he wore last night. He wants to say, ‘Yeah, I’m not gonna do that,’ and he wants to make Castiel hit him in the mouth, but maybe some ounce of self-preservation still exists in his body, because he just drops his eyes.
, Cas is fucking him with his tongue - and he hiccups a warning just before he comes that Cas ignores.
Sire children, she means. Castiel is familiar with the procedure. He struggles to imagine himself… participating in it.
‘It’s - fine.’ He watches Dean lay slabs of yesterday’s bread in the skillet, and drops his voice again. ‘It’s just - Jess and I spoke about it when you wrote, and - I know this thing with Castiel isn’t exactly traditional, but we don’t want you to think you don’t have alternatives now, alright? If you wanted me to be your legal alpha, and you wanted to come back to California when I leave, that’s - we could do that, Dean. Whatever you wanted.’
It’s a baffling state of affairs. Castiel, as far as he remembers, had been in his right mind last night - this morning - when he’d returned here; but perhaps the lack of sleep had affected him more than he’d thought. Had he somehow locked his own bedroom door, instead of Dean’s? There’s no key that he can see anywhere, which confuses things further. One of the domestic staff has made a mistake, perhaps.
They take it slow on the ride back, and they’re most of the way back to town when Cas says, ‘I need to warn you about something.’
‘Dean,’ says Cas, ‘I’m not getting rid of you. I’m not getting rid of you. I’m so sorry.’ His hands are at Dean’s shoulders, now, but Dean can barely feel them. He looks down, distantly, trying to make sense of it. ‘That’s not what I meant. It’s not what I meant.’ He turns his face to the sky for a moment, like he can’t bear to look at Dean any longer, and breathes out, ‘Oh, God,’ like a prayer.
Cas pulls away, and everything inside Dean - brain and body and soul - screams a protest. He struggles, hard, against the vice of Cas’ hands around his wrists, lets it pull against the muscles of his arms, lets his body thrash to close the gap between his own chest and Castiel’s, pants hot into the thin rift of air between them, and Cas is saying, ‘Why- why are you-’, his voice so rough and low and lost, so deep Dean could drown in it. So deep he wants to.
It’s sort of like a fairytale anyway. He wouldn’t say as much, but - well. Nobody’s fucked him like that before. Nobody’s ever - this is embarrassing - committed their full and undivided attention to fingering him open, as if they’re cracking the Vigenère Cipher.
for someone - for anything. He’s delivering the tray to Michael; he’s sent upstairs to pass two versions of a statement along to another newspaper, and Anna is on the other side of the hall watching him; he’s hot and tired and the tension in the house is a physical weight.
’ he snarls, again, fighting the way his instincts beg to submit to Michael, letting them make him angrier.
It’s deliberately intended as a dismissal, to rile him up, so Castiel ignores it. ‘I’ll leave the Bible here with you.’
?’ Dean says incredulously, when Castiel mentions this. ‘Walking? Alone? And then you have to come all the way back again afterwards?’) but there’s a lightness to the mood that is unfamiliar. Castiel has not spent much time with friends - actual friends, not family, and not Gabriel, who is a bit of both but also a colossal pest - since his years of theological study and education, and even now most of his contacts are just that, professional contacts. Balthazar had been a friend, a good one; although from what Castiel has heard in the years since, he has since left the church entirely, a concept that makes Castiel shiver. He knows Dean is not his peer - God, not by any stretch - and that if the omega tolerates Castiel’s presence, it can surely only be as a tactic to secure his own safety; but Castiel can be, if nothing else, useful to him, and if that is what Dean wants, then it is what he will provide.
Jody smacks him on the arm again, although this time it’s less plausibly an accident. ‘I was worried for you.’
He doesn’t stop walking, though, and this time as he walks away she stands still on the dusty street with her hands loose at her sides, and just stares after him.
When he tries to explain a small amount of this to Dean, sitting beside him in the carriage on the way up to the Milton House, Dean nods knowledgeably and says, ‘Oh. Your dad skipped out.’
‘There’s no point lying. They’ll inspect him later this afternoon, it’s going to be perfectly obvious what you’ve done.’
Patient admitted at 1.45pm, July 10th, in visible distress, requesting treatment for perverse sexual impulses and unnatural desire. He was escorted by a family member, who admitted to great concern for the Patient’s mental state and spoke to evidence of recent instability, with which the Patient readily agreed. The Patient was immediately admitted and escorted to a solitary room in order to calm his agitated state, under supervision of a nurse, where he spent the night following his physical examination.
means. It’s a term he’s seen in newspapers, only a handful of times, reporting lurid cases in the cities, designed to shock and appall their readership. It’s the term they used at the hospital, when they were trying to pry the truth of what had happened between him and Dean out of him: a
Wichita is the biggest city in Kansas today with a population of 389,000 people, so I used it as shorthand for a big count location. In 1890, it was only the third biggest, with a population of 23,853. POPULATIONS USED TO BE SO MUCH SMALLER. So while this whole election night is probably WILDLY inaccurate (since the only information I could find about elections in the late 19th century focused on the voters' side of things) and I don't know if they could even count it in this timeframe in 1890, telephones and telegrams aside - given how few people existed in Kansas relative to today, it felt plausible. Sorry to anyone who knows anything about American politics, could never be me, I did not expect to find myself here.
Summary for if you want to skip this part: Dean is taken from his room shortly after his heat breaks, and brought to Michael's office along with Michael, Crowley and a doctor. He's threatened and coerced as they attempt to gather evidence against Cas, and threatened with an invasive medical 'inspection' so they can prove they've had sex. Dean has another panic attack and confesses he and Cas have slept together, but he's very confused and just trying to prevent himself from being assaulted further. He admits to having sex with Cas in the church before Cas admitted himself to the asylum, but says Cas didn't know what he was doing. At the end of the chapter, the housekeeper arrives and passes on the message that Cas would like to make a deal with Michael and Crowley.
He closes his mouth around the head of Dean’s cock and bobs his head gently, slowly. Dean’s not too proud to whimper at the press of a tongue against his slit, or the way Cas’ cheeks hollow as he sucks.
who I was hoping to see,’ says Gabriel, way too brightly. ‘Just who everyone wants to see, I think, man of the hour. Heard you were out soliciting just last week, that right? Had alphas running up and down Mass Street all day long after the scent trail you left - what an advertisement! What an entrepreneur!’
Thank you to 'the Greatest Showman' for making P.T. Barnum a recognisable name again. He was, of course, the American showman who founded the Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1871 - he probably didn't actually dress especially extravagantly, but I figured the reference would land.
The luxury of making such a promise - he’s never had that before. It’s real hard-won. He thinks Sam can tell that, when he looks at him.
He lets himself into the meeting room, sliding fluidly around the table and helping himself to a chair. Unnoticed by Castiel, he’s brought a black leather briefcase with him - he sets that on the table now, unbuckling it and drawing out several sheaths of paper, a pen case, and ink bottles.
‘Dean,’ says Cas, sounding like himself for a second, like Dean’s being difficult on purpose. ‘Just do it.’
He thinks he can hear Castiel’s heartbeat. It’s proof that he is alive, that something still lives inside him, something that his mother and his doctors and the hollow heart of the Milton house itself tried to douse and darken and kick out. Cas has lost almost everything of the man he used to be, but he’s still here.
Dean doesn’t answer. Doesn’t look at him. He cracks an egg against the lip of the bowl and the whole stupid thing breaks in his too-big hands, shell and white and punctured yolk running down the outside out the bowl and down his wrist, and he only manages not to curse because he just
He glances sideways and finds Anna, seated at his left shoulder, watching his face with a curious expression. He wonders whether she is thinking what he finds himself thinking: that but for the circumstances of her birth, the family’s wealth and class, she might be standing behind them against the rosewood paneling, a decorative pet. Then again, this is Anna: perhaps she might prefer that. Perhaps she sees no difference between that, and what her role in society
When he arrives at the house, sweating inside his suit, he is led immediately to the drawing room, which is something of a relief. Anna still favours the conservatory, which he imagines must be like an oven at present. His relief lasts until the beta servant announces him at the door, and he finds three women waiting for him inside: his mother, Anna, and one he does not know.
Dean has not moved from the floor, but he is looking at Castiel as if he is completely insane, as if he has walked merrily into Hell and is now passing around sandwiches and lemonade. ‘You want me to
Cas' sermon is based upon/partially lifted from Charles Spurgeon's 1855 sermon 'The Desire of the Soul in Spiritual Darkness', as featured in the quote. The whole thing can be found here: https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs31.pdf
anything. And if they’re trying to ruin Cas like he thinks they are, that’ll do it. That’s enough to brand him a sodomite, and that’s - whatever, maybe ten years in jail or something, assuming they don’t just take him out back and pretend a gun went off by accident.
He’s kind of taken aback when both brothers fall silent, like he didn’t really expect them to take him seriously. He shrugs, defensive. ‘What? I
In the darkness, he loosens the bolt on the back door as quietly as he can, pulling it back painfully slowly, until the door swings free just a quarter inch. He is barely breathing. Still no noise from outside - he waits another few moments - and then the almost imperceptible scuff of shoes as someone shifts their weight. A slight scent, something like crisp apple. Dean waits, half-crouched, until he’s sure he can pinpoint exactly where the person is standing.
The sudden, wrenching emptiness as Cas had pulled out of him. The way Cas had stood over him, abruptly indifferent, and told him to clean up his own mess.
The sermon is lifted from 'How to Change Your Heart' by Rev. Charles G. Finney (1792-1875), as featured in the chapter quote. You can find the whole text here: http://www.gospeltruth.net/1836SOIS/02sois_how2change_hear.htm
He’s expecting to be yelled at for asking, but the men just glance at each other. The new guy has a leather briefcase, sort of like a doctor’s bag; he sets it on the table now.
‘Can you clean?’ he says to Dean. ‘Or cook? I have a woman who comes round during the week, but I- she could help you learn.’ He’s suddenly self-conscious. ‘It’s a modest rectory, where I live. You would only have to-’
It’s taken a few months, but Cas has learned to sleep more or less like a normal person: he still acts as though it’s an unnecessary inconvenience and doesn’t seem to need many hours, but since they moved out to the barn on the far end of Bobby’s property and started converting it into a proper cabin - into a proper home - Cas definitely understands the appeal better now. More often than not, it’s Dean who falls asleep first, his face buried in the alpha’s neck and their legs tangled, but he still occasionally has to kick Cas to get him to stop the weird staring business (he’s not dumb enough to think that Cas doesn’t immediately resume the weird staring once Dean is asleep, though).
There is movement around them, a ripple of anger, and he feels the Overseer step forward as if ready to hit Dean again. Castiel doesn’t react.
That’s kind of - huh. Dean knows he’s staring at Cas, and Cas must know too, cause he flushes. Balthazar certainly isn’t someone the church would consider a good man. Maybe that rulebook isn’t torn up, exactly, but it’s, you know. Looking kind of dogeared.
Castiel is tremendously pleased he noticed. ‘Yes,’ he says, proudly. He thinks for a moment and then adds, as an afterthought, ‘You really shouldn’t, though.’
‘He’s exaggerating,’ says Cas, who apparently just assumes that no one else is capable of identifying jokes either.
Lise is pretty good at reading people, too. She’s got a sort of guilty, ‘yes, okay, I was in the pantry, you got me’ smile on, dark hair falling a little loose around her face.
- pulls him physically several inches down the bed - and sets himself between them, pressing his face in close.
For just a moment - a fragment of a moment, dream-quick - Castiel lowers his face to Dean’s neck, where it is damp with whiskey and sweat, and Dean feels the brief, wet heat of an open mouth at his scent gland, tasting his skin. It sears like a brand. His mind turns white hot.
Dean lets his head fall to Castiel’s shoulder on the ride back up to the house. It’s mostly because he knows Cas will like it - god, he’s got to stop thinking this shit though, hasn’t he? Not if it makes Cas think Dean’s just enduring him - but there’s also a rare and relative safety to it: they’ve both been rained on enough that their scents are unlikely to cling. Cas turns peaceful with it, anyway, at least until they’re in sight of the house and he gets this anxious jitteriness about him, like there’s static electricity in his skin. They’re gonna get in trouble - they’re both gonna get in trouble - and Dean wishes, more than anything, that they didn’t have to go back.
He does ask to say goodbye to his nurse, Meg, before he leaves, and his request is granted. They approve of this friendship - they consider Castiel’s positive feelings towards a woman a sign of great progress, although Castiel has never had the slightest dislike for women in the first place - and it’s to his advantage. Meg is, objectively, a relatively horrible person. He is deeply charmed by that; by her prickliness, the way she wields a power she does not, by rights, possess. Castiel isn’t sure he’s ever made a friend before, not really, not all on his own. He’s proud to have done so.
Dean slouches back in the armchair, helping himself to the nearest pile of books, presumably so that he has something to criticise. ‘Sam. Sammy. He’s, uh, he’s four years younger than me.’
Castiel isn’t, but he remembers how much Gabriel likes jokes. He tries to think of one, to improve the atmosphere. ‘Which part of a fish,’ he suggests, ‘is like the end of a book?’
And a couple of visual resources for a shabby saloon-turned-eatery. Neither of these are in Kansas, but it's more or less what I had in mind: https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/09-svacina-1024x678.jpg and https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13-mueller-1024x678.jpg (pov that second one: you are castiel in a fancy suit and you have just walked into a shitty saloon with ur cute date and everyone wants to kick ur ass).

It is a hot summer morning when Castiel is next summoned to the Milton House, a thin layer of sweat coating his forehead and the back of his neck. It is too hot to wear his usual coat - he knows full well that his mother will tell him so - except he still does, because to be without it would feel almost like nakedness, or like walking into battle without armour. Naomi has sent the carriage out to collect him especially for the purpose of this visit, which strikes him as ominous; he admits to being more comfortable in Gabriel’s more modest coach, although Gabriel has been somewhat evasive as of late.
‘So. It would be very easy for me to assist in getting you reinstated, in that case, if that were what you wanted. In exchange, I’m simply asking you to pass the omega’s contract over to me a couple of months ahead of our original agreement. There’s no financial loss to you - it would actually ease your financial outgoings a little in the coming months while you readjust to ordinary life, and you could take on a replacement domestic servant once you’re settled back in.’
‘Act what way, act like what, like I can hear ‘em? Like it’s true?’ He takes a step closer, furious; Castiel stands his ground, lines of tension in every muscle in his body, jaw locked. ‘’Cause it
‘Gabe’s,’ says Dean. The realisation is like a bolt of lightning. ‘Gabriel’s parked right on the outside, he said he couldn’t find anyone to sort out his horses-’
He’s British, Dean realises, belatedly. The accent is pronounced, jarring - Dean has certainly never met enough Englishmen to be able to narrow it down any further. He must still be living in Kansas, most likely, to have gotten here so quickly, but - Dean realises he is just standing there, staring, when the guy smirks again and Castiel says, quietly, ‘Yes, he’s mine.’
For a moment, he is wildly disorientated: the light is wrong. The dormitories at St. Mary’s are West facing, slow to leak grey light in the mornings, so the first thing he is usually aware of is the Matron rapping loudly against the door at the crack of dawn, and the footsteps of other omegas as they scramble from their beds. Dean is not used to privacy, has never had any; has very rarely woken up alone with a long shaft of sunlight falling across his bed in the relative quiet, except for whoever was rattling the bolt on the other side of the door and is now shouldering their way inside. He looks, instinctively, for a weapon, but there is almost nothing to hand - a wash basin and pitcher, a vase, and, stupidly, the little fucking Bible - so he is kneeling upright on the bed with nothing but his own clenched fists when the woman enters the room.
‘Alright,’ Dean lets his head fall back against the pillow, grinning. He’s not sure he could make himself stop if he wanted to. ‘It’s not how blowjobs work, then. Speaking of which, am I ever getting one, or did you just wanna talk about horses?’
Oh, god. Cas is here. Dean’s in heat, and Cas is here, in the room with him, finally. He’s going to cry. It’s going to be so embarrassing.
‘Why do you keep making this so difficult?’ Dean bursts out. His voice is louder than he means it to be. He pulls his hands free of Castiel’s grip. ‘I did what you told me. Tell me what you want.’
); when dinner is served early in the drawing room rather than the dining room - lighter and less elaborate than usual, as the more extravagant fare will be served later in the evening, once they are confident in their position to celebrate - since the dining table has already been moved into the hall. Despite the constant movement around him - campaign staff and highborn friends of the family and domestic help darting back and forth through the hallways - Michael keeps Dean close throughout the afternoon as if he derives some strange sort of comfort from his proximity, occasionally dumping papers into his arms to carry, or making him fetch letters or colleagues or staffers (a challenge, since Dean knows no one’s name).
But Dean isn’t either of those things. An omega, yes, but not a woman. It feels like he’s breaking a rule, nonetheless; like he’s skating by on a technicality because the lawmakers never imagined someone like Dean near someone like him.
He should’ve cut Michael’s throat. He should’ve cut his throat and been hanged for it, and it would be over.
he’d come with Dean, not in so many words, and although Dean had slipped back inside to resume his duties with a hot spark of hope in his belly, now he starts to second guess himself.
Jody’s thankfully right about the dinner thing - Castiel doesn’t show up at midday, when Dean and Jody are busy stripping the sheets in the master bedroom, shaking out and turning the feather bed and airing the mattress. Dean has done this a hundred times, but never for an alpha he doesn’t know - the odd, off-putting smell of Castiel permeates the room when he first steps inside; sharp and unusual, like stepping outside after a storm. It’s not unpleasant - it smells sort of clean and sweet - but all the same Dean goes to open the windows straight away, ignoring Jody’s eyes on him. Laundry, apparently, gets sent out to town every week, much to Dean’s relief, where presumably someone even more unfortunate than him has to do it.
Still. Cas is doing this for them - inviting his extremely fallen from grace ex-friend here and tolerating a whole lot of stuff he believes is immoral - and he’s practically vibrating with tension from it, so maybe now’s not the time to mock him. Maybe Dean’s getting soft, but. He crosses over to the pantry and retrieves a jug of lemonade - not especially cold, but it’ll taste okay - and tries to look casual as he pours drinks for people, like,
Two more of the watching omegas wail aloud. The Overseer punches him again, twice, then pins the man to the floor, knee against his back, twisting his arm back too high, and the scent of rage and distress grows sharper and sharper.
It’s the wrong thing to say, anyway, he thinks. He should say, ‘I’m not going to hurt you’ - that’s what Dean wants to hear - except he can’t really say that, not honestly. He’s not sure.
By the time he’s done, it can only be a couple of hours off dawn. He tips the bucket of water out in the yard, and goes to bed.
‘Fuck Michael,’ he says. ‘Fuck destiny, and fuck true mates, and fuck God’s will. I choose you, Cas.’
Castiel is not fluent in Dean speak, but he’s pretty sure pointing this out would not be welcome. ‘I’d like you to,’ he decides on, instead. ‘It’s - it can be pleasant to have another person in the room, while one is working.’ It’s not a lie. It’s never been pleasant for Castiel, but he’s heard that it
He’s slightly less certain about this one. ‘I- believe so.’ His mind flinches over the logistics of such a thing, but if nothing else, he has been proven capable of sexual feeling. Now that the sickness inside him has been cut out, he must be able to redirect that: his body will naturally seek out pleasure. It will know what to do. It makes sense. ‘Perhaps - I would be more comfortable if - further sessions between us-’
Rainmaking was a thing, and very fashionable at the time! https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/rainmaking/12179
‘Mrs. Allen is visiting for tea this morning,’ Naomi continues. ‘We believed it might be pleasant to introduce the two of you. She is a most respected figure in the community - I believe you were familiar with her late husband?’
Dean makes a vague, wordless noise that is neither agreement nor disagreement and flops onto his back, forgetting his nakedness.
Dean didn't know what to say. Suddenly, all their usual banter slipped away and it was left with…well, nothing. Dean thought about it every night he was away -- thought of saying something, asking about it -- are we okay? But what if that ended in Castiel saying no, what if that ended in them done. So, he didn't say anything.
Castiel sinks down onto the ground, landing half in a puddle of something but can’t find the courage to move again as if doing so will make the prisoners finally notice him.
The next day went slowly until a few guards came down and entered their cell. Muttering between themselves, Castiel found out that someone had ordered them to put him in a separate cell as there were only supposed to be five prisoners to each one. He was moved to the empty cell beside the one he was just in and chained back up. The other three prisoners were even unchained as well.
Dean catches the quirk of the captain’s lips and knows he’s won. “Fine. But you won’t just take precautions. You’ll double them. Triple them. And you’ll report to me for the first few days with every single detail of what he’s been up to. Deal?”
Castiel’s chest squeezes tight as he wipes the tears from his eyes only to see the wetness of Dean’s own.
And the boy is brave. But Reyne can see the cracks every time someone strikes him with their harsh words. The worst of it, however, is when those words are of Dean.
She must see the hesitation in his eyes or in his forced smile for her own smile turns into a frown.
In the next moment, he’s ripping his head down and out of the man’s grasp and pulling his legs underneath Val and kicking him hard in the chest until he’s falling backwards and off of him. He rolls away from the still standing prisoner’s impending fist and jumps to his feet.
"Looks like the prince's birthday carnival may have to be moved inside," Nicolaus says, looking back towards the main gate where a multitude of servants are scuffling around in the snow to erect the brightly coloured tents and royal banners. Others attend the stalls, constructing them first before decorating them with rich colours and festival games.
Castiel is quiet during the ride there. They only go to where they usually train – a far way away from the castle and any guards for them to have their own conversations and even in the dark – perhaps if they’re careful – something more.
The man in question strides in, looking at least presentable and ready for their short trip, and comes to a standstill right beside his bed. He doesn’t say a word for a moment, simply staring down at Dean as Dean himself squints back up at him.
“Maybe I was trying to prove something.” Castiel spins his head back around to find Dean looking at him with the beginnings of a smirk on his lips.
Her hands are everywhere this time, trailing over and up his chest until they slowly trail down, down – Dean’s hand barely having moved from her back – and suddenly, panic rips through him and he can’t.
They have moved dining tables and chairs into the ballroom so that every night they can all dine together.
Castiel sighs, eyes slipping closed as if he’s shaken himself out of the grief that he’s reliving. “I wasn’t granted the halo right away. They wanted me to take my time getting used to the wings first. It was sensible. For it took me many years to completely take control of my physical healing ability and that of which to hide my wings. Something that clearly I have still not entirely figured out.” Castiel frowns, pausing a moment before sighing. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t for the best. Restricting the halo from me. For now, it’s been taken. By you father. Possibly by the demon.”
The voices of the men answering muffle together but the conclusion is the same for everyone. Agreed.
The food is good. God is it good and Castiel finds himself staring far too many times at the way Dean’s lips wrap around his fork or the way his tongue pokes out everyone once in a while to lick away some sauce. And at his tipsiest, he ever increasingly finds his eyes trained on those calloused hands of his that has all sorts of things running through his head.
He looks to his brother, watches as a thousand different emotions pushing and pulling flash through his eyes. But he doesn’t speak, the camp now quiet behind him.
“Our God of Light intended to free the world of all higher power once it saw how their blood was abusing it. But it could not finish what needed to be done. Thus, the prophecy was born and passed down for another to take on this great destiny. And he achieved it. Born with the blood of the fallen,” Nyree says. “Descendant and replacement of the Elo de Olapireta.”
Castiel breathes roughly against his lips, his hips jerking up into Dean’s own. Dean gasps, cock twitching beneath his trousers. He uses the grip on Castiel’s hair to tilt his head backwards as he grinds down into him, meeting his rough, jerky movements with his own.
Castiel’s jaw ticks. “Well, maybe I’m just a fucking rude person. How would you know? You’ve known me for like five fucking seconds,” he spits, before yanking his arm from Dean’s grip. He goes to walk away but Dean steps in front of him, hands raised.
Suddenly, hands are covering his own, pulling them away from himself. Dean’s eyes are soft as he says, “You okay?”
“After dealing with the angels for so long, I became good friends with the king and queen, something you might know,” she begins, nodding towards him. “So much so, that they began speaking of these things to me that at first I thought were all figments of their imagination. I was fond of them, much so, but these things were so outrageous. Powers from a fallen angel. Gods of light and dark. Demons.
The enter hall after hall, Dean pointing out where he sometimes eats lunch and dinner with Sam, where the balls are held and where his lessons are held in a library and Castiel has to pause a moment in front of it, squinting through the tiny sliver of the door that he can see through. Dean stops, turning and tells him he will see inside later this afternoon when he has a lesson. Castiel still takes a moment before he continues on. A place to start.
Dean can’t respond in time for she is already down the steps and walking back to the main area. Although, he thinks as he closes the door behind him, he’s not sure what he would have said.
The ache in his knees turns into a searing flash of hot agony and Castiel presses his forehead into the wood, gritting his teeth to keep from crying out.
Out of the corner of Dean’s eye, Castiel looks towards the arching windows at the end of the hall. It’s dark outside, the falling snow barely visible. Castiel’s mouth opens and closes a few times.
Reyne treks back now towards their makeshift camp in the trees. The battlefield is littered with dead men wearing the emblem of the Winchester’s. The stench he’s almost used to. Almost.
Dean contemplated why he even wanted Cas to be acting differently. Shouldn’t he be happy at least that Cas was ignoring it? Why did he want to push things if he was clearly too afraid of talking about what they’d been dancing around? A part of him wondered if he wanted Cas to push so that he'd have no choice but to let it out into the open.
Wanting to put Dean out of his apparent discomfort he spoke up. “I guess we’ll find out as we uncover Jack and Sam’s scheme more.” He offered. Shifting the subject back to the plan at hand.
It was definitely immature. If it were Cas on his own, he would have just asked Sam and Jack what was going on. But Dean had roped him into an elaborate plot instead, and while he still thought it was childish, he was in fact having fun. More notably Dean seemed especially excited. And that was important to him.
“Yeah, yeah. But you’ve seen them it’s-“ Dean attempted to sputter out an end to the sentence but it did not come.
“I don’t know what it’s like to be in love. But if you love Dean...” Jack seemed to be concentrating hard as he spoke; Dean could hear it in his voice; like he was solving a complex equation.
“Oh. Nora, my manager. She was uh- She told me my-” He coughed before continuing. “She told me that my friend-” He emphasised the word “-was watching me.”
He bolted up from his horizontal position, and started pacing around his darkened bedroom. He contemplated talking to Sam.
Cas looked back at him shaking his head fondly. Eventually, he sighed. “Alright, let me think.” He squinted slightly as he stood there thinking. Finally, his expression cleared, becoming soft. He smiled up at Dean knowingly. “The 18th of September.”
“It’s okay Dean. I’ve told you, I’m safe from the Empty.” When Deans pained expression didn’t falter he continued “If all works out and we can find a way to save Jack and defeat Chuck, then- Then I would have no problem becoming human.”
“Anyway. Let’s get back to this party, I want more pie.” With that, he reached for Cas’ hand and began to lead him there.
“Dean please, while I appreciate all these kind words, why aren’t we trying to find a way to help Sam right now?”
“I was still hungry. Dean made me a PB&J.” Cas smiled proudly as he took another bite out of his sandwich.
“It’s Cas, he was asking for updates. I told him this was a bust so we’re on our way back.” Dean explained as he walked back over. He scrunched the paper he’d been holding as he did so, absentmindedly dropping it before sliding into the driver’s seat of the Impala.
That seemed to snap Cas out of his trance. He blinked rapidly. Before smiling up at Dean, he was practically beaming.
He tucked whatever it was back into his one of his trench coat pockets gently, and then patted the item lightly as if to make sure it was still there.
It had been on the tip of his tongue again when he apologized to him in Purgatory. But again, it just wouldn’t come out. The words would choke him halfway out his throat and he’d swallow them down every time.
Ever since Cas had gotten the job at the Gas N Sip he’d automatically just taken up the role of driving him there and back. In fact, it was one of the few things he’d actually been happy about surrounding the whole job thing. (As much as he pretended to complain).
He’d been thinking about it for years now. Though not necessarily allowing himself to factor Cas into the equation. But he had been toying with the idea of what retirement would be like for a while. Of finding some peace eventually.
When he heard Cas’ voice pipe up from right next to him, he jumped, clenching his chest as he did so. It was not his proudest hour.
That’s what made this moment difficult. How was he supposed to explain to Cas the things he had needed a mixtape to try to express.
“I’m sorry am I bothering you?” Sam suddenly questioned, his brows raised. He blinked pointedly a few times.
He snapped himself out of it and focused back in on the conversation. Jack seemed hopeful, as did Sam, who was interjecting with his own witchy knowledge now and then.
“Dean. What is it?” The irritation in his voice was blatant. To his surprise Dean responded immediately, almost before the question was even out of his mouth. He’d clearly been trying to get words out for a while.
Cas evaluated the image. He kept his expression neutral as he looked, though something fluttered in his chest, a warmth of sorts.
For a split second Cas looked like he’d been slapped, but his face returned to its neutral state immediately.
All of Sam and Jacks scheming has been leading to this. But will Cas and Dean be able to figure out whatever it is they've got going on?
“I know. I know Cas. I just- I wish we could get you out of this deal.” He swallowed down the lump in his throat.
“Jack, I assure you Dean does not feel the same way. The love you see from him, it’s-  it’s familial. And that’s why we don’t need to worry about the deal. I do thank you for trying to make me feel better through.” Cas managed to respond.
Dean glanced sideways at Cas, widening his eyes incredulously. He gestured at Cas to stay where he was when he started to move towards the door. “Going out to dinner… like we do every Friday night,” Dean emphasised the words.
“Are you out of ideas already? I’m a little insulted Dean.” Cas deadpanned, imitating Dean’s previous gripe. At that, Dean decided to give him a taste of his own medicine from earlier.
Dean’s blush somehow worsened, but to counteract it he glared at Cas with as much venom as he could muster. It wasn’t very convincing.
Sam eyed him curiously for a moment. Dean hoped the blush he could feel heating up his face wasn’t visible. After flickering over his face for a moment Sam’s eyes suddenly widened - his face breaking out into a shocked smile. A realisation seemed to have hit him upon analysing Dean’s nerves.
“He might freak out. I think he needs to realise it on his own.” Sam sighed as if he wished that weren’t the case.
“Oh uh- Jack wasn’t feeling well- Nothing bad!” He exclaimed much too loudly when the other two looked at him with concern. “I think he might have his first cold or something. So he went to bed and I stayed in case he needed anything.” Sam quickly finished.
When the two men continued to stare at him, he added on. “Why are you back so early?” That finally took their focus off of him.
“Oh- Uh.” Dean stepped up to Cas as he clicked on his phone. Eventually, standing in front of him and holding it forward.
At first, Dean bought Cas’ pondering expression. But then he noticed the corners of his mouth tilting upwards, and shot him a glare.
“Hey you know what man- you can use Enochian words, it's fine.” He got out the words between light chuckles. He shook his head fondly at the angel, clearly deeply amused by his lost puppy antics.
“You’re jealous of Nora?” Cas asked carefully. There was something flickering behind his eyes. Something Dean couldn’t quite place, but it made him nervous.
Sorry it’s been a while since the last update! I’ve been super busy (christmas + working in retail = no spare time). Next chapters gonna be longer and move things along a lot more 👀
The animosity definitely had nothing to do with the fact that he was maybe a little jealous of Nora.
“Well. We can deal with them once they do. For now, we have bigger things to worry about, like finding this guy.” Sam responded.
“Are you done?” Cas finally muttered, heat visibly rising to his cheeks. He was finally looking in Dean’s direction, though no less crabby.
This time he finally looked up to smile directly at Dean. An all too innocent smile. Maybe it was time to rethink putting off those plans.
The drive was like any other, much to Dean’s relief. He had worried that Sam’s comments would make things awkward. Or that all the talking and- whatever was going on between him and Cas lately would make things weird.
Sam pressed his lips together in irritation but decided against arguing. He was probably right. He couldn’t even be mad at Cas ordering him about; he was very protective of Dean and that seemed to mean protective of Dean’s birthday too.
He cut that thought off. He always cut thoughts like that off. They didn’t feel, safe. It felt like prodding something dangerous.
Dean was growing increasingly uncomfortable, and he had no idea what his little brother was on about. He was opening his mouth to say as much, when all of a sudden an idea struck him.
That was part of why he cut himself off. The other reason being that it felt wrong to say it. It felt like a lie. While at this point the internal floodgates were pretty much open, he still tried not to read too much into that.
“I told you Dean. She had a date, and her usual sitter wasn’t available.” Cas rolled his eyes, clearly over the conversation.
Dean muttered under his breath at Cas at that. “Yeah we gotta talk about that shopping addiction you’ve got going on bud-“ He cut himself off at the glare he received from Cas, sheepishly looking back at Sam.
He’d tried talking some sense into Cas. Perfectly reasonable arguments like; what was the point of going legit, when credit card fraud was working perfectly well for them? Or why experience all the mundane crap that comes along with being human if he didn’t have to?
“Jeez Sammy what’s gotten into you. It’s not like they were sitting around playing Yahtzee in heaven. Right, Cas?” He offered lightheartedly.
Sam stepped forward. A hint of impatience seeped in his tone. “Dean, they’ll be back. We have other things to focus on right now.” He raised his hands placatingly at his brother.
Sam cursed internally. The one surprise party was already enough work, he wasn’t sure he and Jack could plan two simultaneously without Dean or Cas finding out.
He was still having trouble with all the- feelings- stuff. Telling Cas he loved him? Yeah sure, he’d finally been able to do that. Losing him again had drawn that out of Dean. But at any given moment he was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
At that precise moment, Cas decided to lazily stroll in. He had a day off, and as was usual, didn’t leave his room until near midday.
Cas decided he would save it as his contact picture later. It was a nice image. The hat seemed to suit Dean in a way Cas wasn’t sure it did himself.
Three days had passed. Dean hadn’t had a chance to speak to Cas yet. But not because he was avoiding him.
“I thought something was wrong- I heard a bang against the door!” Sam responded incredulously, throwing his hands up in the air. “Also gross.” He added on quickly.
“Sam’s fine he- he’s got his own life now. And I uh- I want us to have something of our own.” He smiled wistfully before continuing.
Cas suddenly opened his mouth, turning back to speak to the blonde woman presumably, but she was no longer there.
The bunker was draped in colourful streamers of every colour of the rainbow. The table was covered in food. Balloons in the same colours as the streamers were scattered over the floor. Above it all hung a very homemade-looking crayon addled ‘Happy Birthday’ banner, he assumed he had Jack to thank for that one.
The waves of concern radiating off both of them hit Sam like a brick. It was overwhelming. But at least it wasn’t as jarring as what he’d seen just moments ago.
That one time that Cas had walked into the library and Dean had immediately bolted out to grab some beer? That was just stock replenishment. They were running low. And sure, when Cas had wandered into the ‘Dean Cave’ the previous night; taking a break from his search for Amara; Dean had turned the tv off mid movie and told him he was tired. But that was because... well, he was sleepy damn it! The conversation could wait for some other time! Denial was a hell of a thing.
Jack glanced around at the ground; his face strained in concentration. He finally looked up a moment later with a puzzled expression.
“Yeah, you didn’t wake me up in the middle of the night to clam up now. What is it, let’s get this over with so I can go back to sleep.” Sam looked at him curiously... but mostly with annoyance, maybe a tinge of worry.
Jesus christ. This was going all wrong again. Dean wondered if he should pull over to the side of the road. Having a heart attack while driving and veering into oncoming traffic didn’t seem like a great way to go. He felt his throat closing up.
“So. Is this? A date?” Cas questioned again. This time, slightly softer. He knew what answer he was hoping for. He knew what answer he dared to suspect based on the past few weeks of being around Dean. However, he couldn’t know for sure until he heard it. The doubts lingered. His smile faltered to an expression more nervous as he waited.
As they drove off Jack decided it may be better to ask Sam about this. Dean may not answer properly, and he didn’t want to tell Cas about it yet. He could be wrong about the cheating thing; in which case he didn’t want to upset Cas for no reason.
With that, him and Cas made their way down the bunker stairs. Cas managed to get in a hi and goodnight to Jack before heading off - despite an impatient Dean at his heels.
Dean sighed, putting the bottle down again. He walked up to Cas. “Listen, man, I’m sure he’s fine. He went to talk to Sam, didn’t he? I’m sure whatever it is, Sam’s got a handle on it. He’ll talk to us if he wants to.” He attempted to give Cas a comforting expression.
She flashes that slightly unpleasant smile again, and Castiel feels his blood heat. ‘I understand, Mr. Novak. I would ordinarily ask whether you cared to employ an omega of particular domestic skills or personal character, but I suppose that would be rather missing the point of your crusade?’
Sam’s oddly cautious around Cas. Dean supposes it makes sense - the last time they were around each other, John Winchester was Dean’s alpha, and it’s probably strange to Sam to have a complete stranger hanging round all of a sudden, like a marker of how much time has passed and everything he’s missed. If it were a more normal employer-employee relationship - if Sam had met them both back when they were living at Cas’ house by the church, and Dean’s role had been better defined as domestic help - perhaps it might have been easier for him to understand, but given that Cas doesn’t pay him and Dean doesn’t talk about it, he gets the feeling Sam’s still kind of wary. If Dean admitted that he’s not even sure Cas is technically his legal alpha anymore - and they still don’t know where the law stands on that, or whether his debt to the Refuge is paid off, or what Michael has done in the months since their disappearance - it would only complicate things further; so he doesn’t.
‘Then answer the question.’ Michael sounds bored. ‘We know Castiel was in your room. We know your history. We simply need you to confirm aloud what happened between you.’
So is the coffee, but Dean doesn’t say anything. If this is how Castiel likes it, this is what he’s stuck with.
‘Alright,’ says Dean, trying to keep his voice soothing. ‘Okay, buddy, relax. You’re - uh, I think you’re standing close enough. I’m coming.’ He throws a quick, warning look at Lisa, hoping she realises that he really hadn’t been kidding about the rut. She is still frozen, her eyes following Castiel, like a wild deer.
The omega is probably exhausted - in as much as he’d ever considered it, Castiel assumed heats were less physically demanding on the body than a rut would be; that omegas wouldn’t have the same intense rushes of adrenaline, the consuming hunger, the sudden spikes of unrestrained energy. Now he gets to watch Dean go through it, he realises how wrong he was: every time a new wave builds, Dean practically vibrates with it. He forces himself to climax without gentleness, whimpering, merciless, all for the sake of half an hour or so of clear thought immediately afterwards, and then promptly passes out for an hour or two. The idea that Dean should have to do this by himself - four times a year, every year, for most of his life - makes Castiel want to snarl. He should have somewhere soft to lie; he should have a window; he should have someone to lift a cup of cool water to his mouth and smooth his hair from his face, and make love to him until he is soothed. He can’t stop thinking about it, throughout the next day - the little dark room, the damp mattress, no fireplace he can huddle in front of and no way to keep time but for the visits of the omega maid with food and water.
Castiel can’t let him. He understands, now. He understands why Dean gets to his knees when he is afraid; he understands why Dean offers his body when he fears Castiel might send him away; he understands why Dean begs to be beaten when he believes he has caused Castiel pain. That Dean might kiss him, that Dean might break him - and for what? In the hopes Castiel might turn against his family, might go against God’s own plans? - and feel nothing? Castiel could not bear it. He cannot become yet another thing Dean endures to ensure his own survival. It is partially for Dean’s sake, but it is mostly, selfishly, for his own.
Castiel practically swallows his tongue. If he had been drinking, he would have spat half of it into the lake. ‘I - is that - I don’t think you should call yourself that.’
They stand shoulder to shoulder for a minute, and then Cas sticks his head back into the kitchen and says, ‘That smells burned,’ and Dean chokes out, ‘Shut the fuck up,’ and Sam’s laughing and slapping him on the back as he reaches for a plate. He claps Cas on the shoulder, too, as he makes his way out into the living room with the food, and Cas gets this startled sort of look on his face like no one’s ever treated him that way before and he’s not sure how to respond.
it, the sort who kept saying they’d breed him or fuck him full of babies, that sort of thing, until Dean lost his patience and tried to give them a little sex education. If he’d had to guess, he’d probably have put Cas in the second category. Like, not the bad parts of it. Just the fairytale.
‘I know,’ he says, and then reconsiders and says, ‘Who?’, and then reconsiders again just in case Gabriel actually answers. ‘He’s at mother’s house.’
As a member of the clergy, Castiel is always asked to say grace. He takes it as a very great honour, to have this role in the family. It is a relief, to stop thinking.
-’ while Cas buttons himself back into his suit, still trying not to look at him. It feels like Cas has kicked him, while he’s belly-up and exposed. He shifts an arm to cover his soft dick, then gropes for his abandoned underwear with the other, to try and clean himself off.
He laughs, because he can’t help it, and swings himself up onto the driver’s seat next to Cas; grabs for the reins and the whip and silently sends a prayer of gratitude for Gabriel’s preference for rockaway carriages, light and fast and single-horse drawn. Cas’ thigh is warm and solid and real against his own, and he’s twisting back to watch the house as Dean spurs the black mare into action and she wheels around obligingly.
Dean’s body, his tongue hot and wet and hungry, like he’s chasing after the pulsing slick, and the whole thing is so filthy and so good that Dean’s whole brain just gives up - just abandons him to his whimpering and mewling and trying to push back onto Cas’ face. His own hand is back on his dick now, moving fast, taking him back to that edge - christ, god,
Hands reach for the blanket that’s bundled around him; Dean makes a wordless sound of injured protest as the topmost one is pulled back, clinging onto it.
Cas kneels on the end of the bed facing him, and pulls Dean to his chest very carefully, so that Dean’s face is buried in the crook of his neck; when he gasps a shaky inhale he gets a lungful of the night sky, of smoke and lightning, something wide open and endless and infinite. If he whimpers, so what, because Cas has wrapped his arms around him and it feels like safety; like he’s a kid and his mom’s still alive and he doesn’t know the world that’s waiting for him. He digs his fingers into the cotton of Cas’ shirt, presses his mouth to the hollow of his throat, sobs before he can catch himself; and Cas smoothes an awkward hand over Dean’s scarred back and makes soft noises, little indistinct attempts at comfort that he’s never needed to know how to give until now.
. His horse fidgets, picking up on the sudden tension in his body; he reaches to curl his fist into her mane automatically, mind racing, knuckles turning white. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘Please,’ Castiel interrupts. ‘Please, I can’t go back to the asylum. I can’t - Mother, please.’ He turns back to her. ‘Please, it will - I’d sooner-’
Puberty began without difficulty at age eleven; the Patient presented as an alpha at the age of fifteen, after which his biological seasons proceeded with regularity, and he was troubled thereon with nocturnal pollutions that weakened and frightened him greatly. He is no longer unable to recall the circumstances under which these occurred, or the nature of the dreams that were connected with them.
The patient is responding well to hydrotherapeutic treatment, which he appears to enjoy. Electrical stimulation and aversion therapy scheduled for twice weekly sessions, beginning tomorrow.
Michael barely reacts. ‘Of course I could,’ he says. Not like a threat, just a statement, comfortable in its own power.
‘I would like very much,’ Mrs. Allen says, once they’ve circled back around to the main street again, back to where the carriage is waiting, ‘if we could do this again sometime, perhaps, Mr. Milton? During your convalescence?’
The sound Dean makes is something between a snarl and a barking laugh. ‘Fuck off,’ he says, too-loudly, and it comes as such a shock that Castiel just stares at him. Dean pushes away from the chair, stumbling back to his feet, skittering away. He does not seem quite able to catch his balance; his swings blindly on the spot, looking at nothing. ‘Fuck off,’ he repeats, and the edge to his voice catches in the still air like a ragged thumbnail against a loose thread. ‘No he doesn’t. No he fucking doesn’t. What are you saying?’
It’s not a subtle hint, but he’s still surprised - after he’s changed for bed, and is rinsing his face in the wash basin on the dresser - when Castiel comes into his room again.
Moving out to the cabin had changed things. Maybe that’s an alpha thing - he feels like he’s got his own territory now, or something - or maybe it’s just that Cas knows fuck all about sex and doesn’t know there are certain things that alphas just don’t
The waiting photographers and journalists blockading the front of the house are all on their way inside now for Michael’s victory speech, a river of black suits, and the shape of Cas’ tan coat cuts through them in the opposite direction. Dean tightens his grip on Cas’ hand and gasps, ‘Run, fucking run,’ and then, ‘I knew - part of me always-’
Castiel takes several steps backwards, retreating to the bed and sitting on the edge of it, his body abruptly so tense it feels as if something inside him might snap. ‘What is this?’
‘We don’t need to be,’ says Crowley straight away, too smug to be genuine. ‘He’s your prodigal son, I’m the guy who makes the deals, you’re the big fish in the biggest pond. Does anyone mind if I smoke?’ He doesn’t wait for an answer, which is just as well since both Michael and Naomi ignore this. Castiel sits down, at his mother’s gesture.
‘Don’t take them down to laundry,’ the housekeeper is saying, ignoring him. ‘He’ll be clear in a few hours. They’ll want-’
There is nothing especially radical in the Milton library, of course. It was always considered wiser to limit the availability of such things - perhaps he, like Anna and her own books, might be negatively impacted by such thinking. His mother has always understood him better than anyone, has always been patient, has always made sure there is nothing that might disturb him in the content provided for his study. None of the works of John Draper or Andrew White here, at least.
He barely speaks to those accompanying him. Emery and his friend – he has not yet even learnt his name. Although, they barely speak to each other.
“Better?” Dean scoffs. “Joren trained me. You know, the guy who’s the best archer in this castle.” It’s late in the afternoon, the four guards accompanying Dean standing far away, back near the training hall. It’s a relief to Castiel. No matter how much he despises Dean, he despises them more and the way they just silently follow them around everywhere. And makes things infinitely harder for him. In his stay so far, there have been no possible time to slip away. Not that it would be easy without them anyway. He’s practically attached at the hip to the prince bar his lessons in the library.
But at least the numbness makes things easier when Dean’s hand curls over his own, thumb brushing lightly over his skin, and Castiel speaks. Because he can feel it – the heavy sorrow paired with the want to know. The want to hear it.
Dean sits up in the bath, a hand reaching up to wipe at his eyes. His head aches. It's enough for one day. He needs rest. Needs to refuel. Or else he's not sure he'll get through any of this. And perhaps in the morning, everything will be a little clearer. He somehow doubts it, but he must sleep anyway.
Louder than the quiet and the stares, however, is the pity. Castiel almost wants to turn and face them – dare them to meet his eyes and see their holy saviour for what he is. Merely a boy.
“It’s a gift for your coronation,” Castiel says, handing it over and Dean grins as Sam looks inside and his eyes widen.
They are soft and warm and more than Dean could have ever imagined. So Dean kisses back. Castiel bunches Dean’s shirt up in his hands while Dean wraps his own around Castiel’s waist. The kiss goes on and on but it's not rushed. It stays soft and slow, as if they have all the time in the world.
Before he can even begin to think to jump away, there’s strong hands behind him and he’s being shoved with great force out into the opening where he stumbles and rolls onto his hands and knees, careful of his swords as he begins to flicker into visibility.
Dean’s eyes find Castiel at the edge of the room, standing to the side of the long dining table in conversation with the young guard, Emery. Emery is still speaking with him when Castiel’s eyes meet Dean’s as if sensing him watching.
When he finally gathers the courage to look up, he sees the bags under Castiel’s eyes and the cut and bruise that mark his face. He doesn’t want to be reminded of it. He already hates himself enough for it.
He stiffens and immediately feels Cas recoil away. He’s not even paying attention when the fourth shot is taken. He sits stunned, in silence and Cas eventually clears his throat, breaking it and mumbles something along the lines of ‘it says to now collect the photos outside’.
Castiel’s fiddling with the ring on his finger when he says, “I’m not quite sure yet, I’ll have to think about it.” He raises his eyes then and it’s almost as if it’s a challenge. “What do you think, Dean?”
She reaches a hand out toward him but he turns and he runs, vision blurred until he stops on the other side of the street. He braces a hand against the wall of a pub and bends over at the knees. His throat burns. He wants to wretch. He wants to scream.
Would Leda even believe it to be true? That he would be capable of kidnapping the princes in revenge? He barely knew her and yet somehow, he feels her opinion of him matters.
“Look at it. Look at what you’ve done,” he spits, eyes gleaming with tears. “If only you’d whipped him to death when he first came through the gates.”
“But I did leave both Sam and I’s chambers looking as though they had been broken into and us both captured. And though I hate to speak it, Castiel wasn’t well liked in the castle and was known by most that he and I did not have a good relationship. At least,” Dean swallows, eyes flicking to his, “in the beginning. It would be easy for the majority to believe he would attempt to capture us in revenge. And of course, because of his fighting ability it would be easy for many to believe he could pull it off.”
He starts with his desk, rifling through every drawer as carefully as he can – making sure not to leave anything out of place but to no avail. It would help if he truly knew what he was looking for. What does the halo even look like? Surely not a giant halo filled with light or else he’d assume it would prove easier to find. He searches the trunk at the end of the bed, feels his way over the bed itself, fiddles with every book on the bookshelf, all the while a clock ticks in the back of his mind, winding down ever so quickly.
Castiel doesn’t make any notice of her approach but he must do for when Elaria slips her hand into his own, he does not flinch.
It’s exciting to finally meet the man and put a face to the name. Joren Morley, greatest bowman in the country – in the continent.
"I think it's time we discuss your travels," Orella says carefully. Dean sighs, preparing himself for whatever is to come. Sam looks anxious beside him, not too happy to be reminded of their situation.
“I know you probably wanted to kill me when you heard I’d been compromised. But…” Dean places it in Castiel’s hand. “I think it might have been worth it. Going back to the castle.”
"You had a drink too many?" one of them asks, and Nicolaus clenches his fists - that rage bubbling up inside of him. But suddenly there's another flash of lightning and as he looks out again, one of the trees skeletal branches looks strangely like a wing of an angel.
But now Castiel can barely concentrate, only being able to focus on Dean’s gentle touch. It was foolish of him to let anyone see his weakness, let alone the man who currently hates him
He waits patiently as the prince glances to the ceiling, mulling over his first question. His gaze is devoid of any emotion when he finally speaks. “How can you hide your wings?”
The movie starts playing and the girls quiet down behind them. A few minutes in, Castiel leans slightly further over into Dean's space to whisper to him, "
Castiel opens his eyes to find Dean’s back staring at him. His heart sinks in his chest and he curses himself for being so naive. So hopeful. Nothing will change.
“I’ve got you. I’ve got you. Just--” Dean’s hand is hot, curling around him and he strokes one, two, three before Castiel is coming in between them, back arching slightly off the bed as his head falls back, biting down hard so as to not let any more than a whimper sound from him.
Charlie shakes her head and places a comforting hand on his knee. "No, Dean, you haven't. None of this is your fault. And either way, Leuric - the God of Light," she corrects, to not confuse him, "is looking out for us. They are guiding all that is happening. It is fate, after all. So, if this is how it goes, then this is how it goes."
Dimarus had hand picked four men the day after he arrived at the castle. They’d all stood beside each other in Dimarus’ office and leading up to it Dean honestly did not know who to choose nor think it would matter – as long as they weren’t one of his father’s highest-ranking guards.
Missouri had given him some more of those looks - much like now, Castiel raising his eyebrows at her from where he's putting some new books on the shelves. She rolls her eyes and points behind him. Castiel turns, nearly dropping some of the books stacked high in his arms as Dean stops in front of him.
“So, how was your morning, Cas?” Sam asks, raising his voice above the noise of other men, before Castiel has barely taken his seat at the table.
And Dean can practically feel the joy springing from his chest, can feel Castiel’s lips curve against his and--
Dean's own well up, his smile small but true. And he knows he would follow him anywhere. "Yeah. I do."
Those three words land painfully and he can’t find it in himself to believe they’re true. Because, “If you miss me so much, why did you leave in the first place? I mean, I don’t care if you wanted to go study somewhere else but we made a pact. You promised me. And then you--” His throat tightens around those words.
Castiel’s eyes flicker to the floor, a small whimper falling from his lips. “But it’s unfair to you,” he mutters, knowing if his father were here right now, he’d be screaming at him for making a mess of this.
The maids are already waiting outside the chamber, ready to enter and clean his wounds to stop any more bleeding or infections. Alissande is among them and she shoots him a quick glance, her eyes scared but reassuring. At least he knows that for now he's in good hands.
As I mentioned last time, I am now updating my AO3 profile page every week or two with my progress on this story if you are ever wondering how things are coming along!
There’s nothing unordinary about it except when Emery lowers the torch slightly. Catharlo hisses beside him.
Mary nods. “That’s right. I learnt of it later – that he died. The angels told me it is most likely that as soon as the demon possessed Ferrant, it would have snuffed out his soul, sending him to the in between. That holding the demon and all it’s power would have destroyed his body as well and the demon would have left it there, off to find a new one.”
Because not only is Castiel completely and utterly gay but they didn’t just ‘know each other’ in high school, they were as close as any two friends could be.
“Either one of you wanna tell me what Castiel Novak was doing sitting across from you just now?” she says, hands on her hips.
Castiel swallows around the lump in his throat, running his hand through his hair as he feels Dean sigh. If he closes his eyes hard enough he can almost imagine that this is somewhere else. That they are something else. Something more than just friends.
He listens carefully for anything – shouts of guards, crunches of boots on the ground coming his way. But he hears nothing. He lets out a deep breath, relief flowing though him. The fall has luckily left him just above his window and he’s able to carefully kick it open and slide himself in – although his hand still screams in pain.
The relief is clear in Dean’s eyes but there’s hesitance there too. It’s too late. Castiel’s already made him question everything. And he’s not going to simply forget something like that. “And what do you believe?”
Everyone has big grins on their faces when Castiel gathers them round for the beginning of training. Dean must have told them what happened, much to everyone’s delight.
He lets his eyes slip shut, breathing through his nose to keep the panic at bay. Not only is he trying to figure out what any of this could mean, he’s also dealing with the revelation that he’s the only one who can save Castiel.
They come to a stop at their next checkpoint, the north-west tower, making their way inside and up the winding stairs to halt in front of a wooden door with grey, metal latches. A patterned knock and voice command later and the guards inside are letting them in. The towers are all about sixteen feet high and made of stone, the same as the wall. The only window is a twenty-inch-tall slit in the stone, that faces outwards towards the Ellwood Forest for the guards to easily look out and scout through. It goes halfway around the tower, wide enough for the guards to see all the way from the west to the north.
"How did you know Cas was in the dungeons?" Charlie's eyes flick to Castiel's, the question there. Castiel gives her a slight nod.
“Oh,” Leda says before smiling. “Well, that’s even more endearing.” Dean makes a pained noise at the back of his throat. “Don’t worry. I’m not going to bother him if he’s not interested. But it doesn’t hurt to look at him.” Dean’s eyes search for Castiel’s again and finds him bent over and talking to a few younger children. He spots a floppy mop of hair among them.
Castiel smiles. “Gotta make it dramatic, right?” Dean’s laugh is one of relief but he can’t get much further before Castiel’s lips are colliding with his own, hands either side of Dean’s face. His cheeks burn hot beneath his palms and Dean’s own skate over Castiel’s hips, resting under his jacket on the fabric of his shirt.
He trots beside Castiel and gazes over towards him only to find him already looking in Dean’s direction. His eyes flick away quickly and he looks down – almost embarrassed.
Dean pants hard when Castiel finally let’s go of him. His hand aches slightly but ever since Castiel did that
He’s weighed down so heavily by exhaustion and the dreams of blues eyes and warm skin that by morning, he has all but forgotten his mother’s words.
Castiel huffs an awkward laugh. “Thank you. You look very nice yourself.” And he can already feel the tips of his ears burning at even the smallest remark because he’s here. At his date. With Dean. The man who’s been making him blush since the beginning of the term.
Dean nods, pushing himself up and digging around in the dark for his clothes. He sneaks a glance at Castiel while he dresses, noting that despite the clear lack of sleep, his body is less tense. It doesn’t say much though when he finds Castiel’s face carefully blank.
“And what happens if none of us make the first move?” Dean asks, and Castiel smiles. He darts forward then, catching Dean off balance. His sword point rests touching just below Dean’s neck.
Because how does he explain something like this? How does he explain that he's never felt this way about anyone in his life? That he defied what he once knew because what he felt was so powerful? That he left his very home and everything he once he knew and loved behind to save Castiel? That he would follow him to the ends of the earth for a war between gods and demons?
Castiel is sorry to hear it but he is glad Kyra found someone to love and glad that Elaria has others she can rely on. It’s clear neither Laiba or Usman are angels but he gathers from the concern in their eyes they care much for her.
He doesn’t even need to make it there because before he knows it, two angels he doesn’t recognise are in front of him, a horse by their side, a skin with water and what he hopes is a small pack with some food in the side.
“It was fine, Prince Sam. Although, your brother certainly takes his time to get up,” Castiel responds, firmly fixing his eyes on the young prince. Sam smiles but it seems to come up short, his head inclining, hair flopping slightly in his face.
. He has to be better. He has to just suck it up and hold his tongue until he is able to get out of here – something that will now be increasingly hard with his position as Dean’s personal guard. He’ll just have to be patient.
Finally, they reach a clearing and he sees where the prince is taking him. A small lake, with a rocky outcrop as the backdrop – water falling over it and leading away down a small stream.
“What is this?” Dean points towards the pig that stands with a dagger still in its side. “What the fuck is it doing here?” The guards all look at each other but have no response. “Then get it back to the pen,” he orders. They don’t hesitate to comply.
Gabriel holds up his hands. ‘Just saying what I heard. Don’t tell me it’s not true that you went out scandalising women and children left and right after church yesterday? Oh, the tears and histrionics in town about
She makes a dubious noise, but doesn’t argue. Castiel can see his uncle now, circling around on the other side of the room.
Unrelated to anything but tangentially to libraries (although this is a public one, so WAY less fancy), but I love this picture: https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/28093/image.jpg
He’s not sure what to do with himself when Jody actually makes him up a compress, though. It’s not the first time - he spent enough time in the Refuge infirmary, had bruises and fractures and on one memorable occasion a dislocated shoulder - but that was always perfunctory, like trying to mend a broken machine or a tool, so that it could be put away and reused. Jody keeps it practical and matter of fact, but she’s gentle as she presses a wet towel against his cheekbone and makes him hold it steady.
Gabriel whoops with laughter this time. ‘One whipping and it’s all home baking and “yes sir”! You really are good, little brother. He’ll be a trophy omega by the end of summer at this rate.’
When questioned about his experiences of male love, the Patient became increasingly agitated once again, and spoke briefly of an omega male domestic servant that has most recently awoken feelings of desire within him, as if for a woman. He implied that sexual congress of some sort had taken place with this omega, but refused to clarify the nature of this interchange. The Patient appears deeply conscious of state law for morally perverse crimes against nature, and may have been attempting to protect himself or the other party. It seems probable - although cannot be proven - that the most repugnant intercourse has taken place, based upon the extreme agitation of the Patient when questioned further, and his increasingly unstable disposition. At this point, due to the Patient’s nervous excitement, the consultation ended early to allow for him to be restrained and returned to his quarters.
Balthazar shrugs. ‘No point sending a letter ahead. You said it was urgent, after all. Anyway, the opportunity for a dramatic nighttime caper? Always too exciting to pass on. And of all the people to tear up the rulebook, Cas - you were probably the one I least expected.’
Hilariously, “Can’t see a hole in a ladder,” was 19th century slang for someone who was very drunk, but I wanted to use it so badly and I think it worked to describe Cas' mental state.
Here is more about the valet role intended for Dean: http://www.avictorian.com/servants_valet.html. Like footmen, they were as much status symbols as attendants, which is why they were often chosen based on height, figure, and attractiveness.
Gabriel is at her shoulder, and that helps, because whatever Castiel’s inadvertent failings, Gabriel is always ready to eclipse them on purpose. He has brought two omega attendants, both women and both taller than him, one blonde and one brunette. When he sees Dean - looking straight past Castiel to do so - he lights up again and sing-songs, ‘Castiel’s brought his project with him!’
His brother, Michael, has Dean pinned against the wall; is standing close against him, neck slightly bent and head dipped in order to scent wolfishly at Dean’s exposed throat. His teeth are flashing white in the low light, his scent - the strong, musky one, that Castiel realises now he has never known untempered - is almost overpowering. Dean is frozen, still, wide-eyed - his pupils are blown, he looks as if he is barely holding himself up, and yet there’s something in his scent of the prey animal, and Castiel can almost hear his heart beating rabbit-fast.
The man nudges at his scent gland. Dean. ‘You gotta answer me, buddy, alright, I’m not - I’m not -’ He fidgets. He smells of - Castiel can’t think it. It smells so sweet. ‘Come on. Fuck. Can’t -
It is too late for guests, anyway. That is the main indication of who this visitor might be - Dean knows Cas sent a telegram a few days ago, the expensive sort he had to go into town to arrange - so despite the odd appearance, from Dean’s perspective this guy may as well be his best friend. He holds the front door open, trying to look like he knows what he’s doing, and the guy smirks again, steps over the threshold, and sing-songs, ‘Casti
Cas very carefully does not turn around. He is watching the Ashland telegraph boy make his wobbly way into the darkness on some sort of modern velocipede.
All at once, there is chaos: staffers and colleagues and supporters roar in celebration and approval, beginning with a rumble and swiftly becoming a wave of thunder. Someone starts banging on the table; someone else begins a round of cheering; someone throws a great armful of campaign flyers in the air so that they rain down like black and white confetti - Naomi Milton sweeps through the crowded hall triumphantly to congratulate her eldest son - and the lingering members of the press who were loitering at the front of the house are crashing inside, tripping over each other, joining the fray. Michael is lost to Dean’s eyes, swallowed up in the crowd, a triumphant messiah at the centre of his baying devotees-
Dean tries real hard not to be obvious about it these days, but sometimes it’s hard when he sees Cas first thing in the morning, all grumpy and disheveled; he turns to look at him, making an effort to keep his smile small and private. He still sometimes thinks it’s insane that anyone can look at them without realising what they mean to each other - Cas is the same, panics in crowds sometimes after one of them looks too-fondly at the other, like he thinks it must be written across his face and someone’s about to swoop. It’s why they stay out of the main town most of the time: when it’s busy Cas gets all blank-faced and shaky and out of it, and it makes Dean’s chest ache every time like someone’s stuck a knife in it.
The alpha squints at her, and nods. He’s still wearing his hat and overcoat; he follows Jody through to the parlour, and Dean stays where he is, unmoving. Is he supposed to make coffee for him, or something? Is he supposed to lower his eyes, or call him ‘sir’ the way he used to call his dad, or trail around after him?
‘It affects me if Michael gets mad and beats my ass,’ Dean points out. ‘And I can read. Have you seen Cas?’
‘Dean,’ she says, addressing the omega directly, and Dean’s shoulders tense. She says the name like there are quotation marks around it. ‘You may go and fetch your master a drink.’
Dean almost asks, but doesn’t. There’s a hot skillet on top of the range ready to have batter poured into it, but he’s kind of worried Gabriel will try to swat his burning ass again and Dean will accidentally grab it with his bare hand, or drop it, or beat the little fucker around the head with it. So he just keeps standing there.
? ‘I don’t know! I don’t - a while ago - during my - in heat, I don’t know, whatever. He fucked me, he knotted me, okay? Don’t fucking,’ he can’t look away from the doctor, he can’t control the way his breath is tearing its way out of his throat, making his chest heave, ‘let him touch me, please.’
Castiel doesn’t think before he says it, but it’s not insincere. All the same, Dean recoils. ‘Don’t fucking make fun of me.’
‘My intentions?’ She gestures down the darkly panelled hallway. Castiel has not seen any actual omegas yet. ‘They are as I outlined. I believe in,’ he ducks into a smaller, neatly decorated room, and takes the chair she indicates, ‘I believe in redemption, Miss McKellan, not only for the privileged among us, such as ourselves, but for those whom most believe lost. I believe that with God’s love,’ he straightens, feels his eyes brighten, ‘even the most corrupted can be saved.’

‘What kind of negotiation?’ he asks, just as Zachariah steps into the room and closes the door after him, giving Castiel a jovial but unexpected clap on the shoulder that makes him jump.
Cas just holds him, until Dean doesn’t feel the staircase any more, or the cold dampness of his shirt, or the tightly clenched fist of pain inside his ribcage. Cas holds him until Dean falls quiet, until the tears on his cheeks dry to starch, until the thunderstorm and smoke clear and Dean is just inhaling the cool, endless night.
Over on the other side of the table, Crowley, who has been watching this argument with every indication of great enjoyment, sets his pen down. ‘Am I holding onto this omega’s contract, or aren’t I?’
Naomi doesn’t look surprised at the question. So, okay, she’d known he was lying. All the same, she says, ‘Oh dear, then he didn’t tell you,’ presumably just to be a fucking bitch about it.
He thinks of Cas as carriages roll up in front of the house throughout the day; when Michael’s wife arrives in a dress of rustling aubergine silk and speaks to the press in glowing terms of the husband she has barely seen for months (
‘Her embroidery is marvellous,’ says Anna, who looks like she is being paid to be here, and not enough. Perhaps their mother asked her to attend, to keep Mrs. Allen from being the only omega present among alphas.
He lets himself out, turns the key in the lock just as he found it so that Dean is secured, and pads barefoot through the house back to his own bedroom.
Can’t steal what you’re given, that’s what Bobby used to say, although he sure as hell wasn’t thinking of this context. Dean would do it. He’d do it after today, after Cas took him out here, after all the awkward kindnesses. He wouldn’t even mind. He’d let Cas do whatever, and it would be the best fucking trade off Dean’s ever made, in exchange for all of this. He’d make it real good, and then Cas wouldn’t get rid of him. Cas might keep him around.
The popular story of cornflakes being invented by  Kellogg as an anti-masturbatory device is mostly false - they were never actually advertised as such - but Kellogg, among others, did endorse The World's Blandest Diet to chase away Spicy Thoughts, so you can see where Cas' oatmeal logic has come from here.
The person goes down almost immediately - too easy - and in the same heartbeat that Dean’s pinning them, he realises it’s a woman - a very slight woman, caught way off guard, which means that instead of trying so hard to be light-footed, she may, in face, just be light-footed. Even slammed to the ground, breath punched out of her lungs, she immediately bucks back against him - she didn’t come for a fight, but she’ll give him one - and then they’re both scrabbling messily against each other in the dark, still wordless - an omega, she’s another omega, he can tell for sure now - and it’s when she hisses, ‘
Dean doesn’t panic, but it’s a close call. He yanks, too hard, on the reins; the horse stops dead in the middle of the trail and Castiel reacts a couple of seconds slower, wheeling his own chestnut around awkwardly.
Chapter specific content warning: Michael's scent effectively roofies Dean, part two. No explicit sexual content, but uncomfortable power play with sexualised undertones.
The room is square, high-ceilinged, with tall arched windows that remind Castiel of a cathedral. He has spent many hours in this room over the last few months - some he remembers clearly, others less so; as if his mind has elected to fold them carefully away. like old clothes under a bed. He has watched dust motes dance in the streaming light from the windows, over and over, and stared into the calming landscape paintings that decorate the walls as if he could will himself inside them. He’s not fond of it, exactly, but there’s something safe about its familiarity: the scratch of the alienist’s pen as he writes his notes, the slow, constant tick of the carriage clock that sits on his desk.
The black mare still harnessed to Gabriel’s carriage sees them approach. She twitches on the spot as Dean grabs for her bridle, gives her a quick pat to calm her as Cas swings up onto the side of the carriage and scrambles to the front bench seat. Dean twists to follow him; jams one foot onto the step and then feels Cas pull him up with their joined hand, and for just a second he lifts effortlessly through the air before Cas catches him by the other elbow, his face just inches away, and Dean can’t help it - he can’t - he closes the gap to kiss him, hot and breathless, still half-hanging off the side of the carriage.
Despite his casual attitude, Castiel notices that Dean’s eyes are very wide as they step down from the carriage outside of the vestibule. He has perhaps never visited a mansion of this sort -
He can’t keep himself from dreaming about the man in the yard. It turns into the dark room with the rattling projector; the black and white tattoo of the man’s face, squinting into the camera, burning into the back of Castiel’s eyes, and the electricity searing through his body as if cauterising a wound. Except that other times, the man is laughing, on horseback, his face upturned to the sky and sun-bright; and other times - back in the hospital, vomiting, they’ve given him some sort of drug again - Castiel is lying back with his head against his shoulder and the man’s arms around him, and when the man talks Castiel can feel the vibrations in his chest. He feels like he’s done something terrible. He feels like he’s done something terrible, and he doesn’t remember what it was.
It is Tuesday evening, and Cas is expecting his rut to hit Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. Dean has gathered this much, although Cas still insists on euphemistically calling it his ‘season’, as if Dean’s omega honour will be sullied if he hears the word ‘rut’: he’s way,
Dean’s not even sure how he’s still hesitating, not when he feels like he’s about to fly out of his own body. He’s barely still steering it. ‘Can you,’ he says, without opening his mouth properly, ‘Will you - they didn’t make you listen to the noises or whatever, that’s still okay?’
He hadn’t thought about it, when the telegraph boy handed it over. That’s the insane part: that Dean is so anonymous now, in his pressed uniform, that no one questions him. He’s just got to walk the few yards back and forth from the front of the house to the main hall, over and over, all night. And he does: he hands Michael the results for Lenexa and El Paso - he’s never even heard of them, but based on the tiny numbers on the cards only a couple of hundred people live in either place - and nobody asks any further questions.
‘One of the bitches threw something at me,’ says an Overseer. Dean’s expression doesn’t change, but his eyes shift sideways, showing the whites. Castiel wonders if they’re friends, the omegas here. It hadn’t occurred to him that they might be.
Cas says, ‘I’m not going to hurt you,’ and Dean almost sobs. The heat of Cas’ thigh between his own is the only thing he knows; he tries to shift his hips again, tries to hold onto the moment before Cas gets up and leaves.
The Overseer pulls Dean to his feet by the back of his shirt; the omega stumbles, makes a quiet, pained whining noise, and then immediately looks absolutely furious with himself. Castiel watches them leave.
He can smell Castiel’s scent before he turns around; bitter with hurt and fury in a way that makes him want to flatten himself to the ground and bare his neck to him. He doesn’t, but it’s an effort to make himself turn around and meet those blue eyes. Castiel’s brow is creased again, like he’s confused, like Dean is trying to hurt him on purpose and he doesn’t know why; but that’s secondary to the barely contained anger and embarrassment radiating from him, the way he grabs for Dean’s arm and Dean lets him.
Michael’s lead starts to widen. It’s not enough that they can call it for the night, just yet - according to the beta guy from the Lawrence Daily News, they can usually make a firm judgement by the little hours of the morning, although what actually tends to happen is that each newspaper makes a decision a little while before that depending on which candidate they
It’s so good that it takes him way too long to realise that Cas’ face is pressed into his neck, and it’s damp, like he’s weeping.
Cas has never seen an omega in heat, Dean’s distant brain supplies, a couple of minutes late. He’s a gentleman, the closest he’s ever gotten is - well, also Dean, that first time at his house. He’s smelled it, probably heard more than he ever wanted to, but now he’s faced with Dean huddled half-naked and covered in a sheen of sweat and - yep, okay, already getting hard again - and he’s standing there on the very brink of the circle of candlelight like he’s about to face a firing squad.
‘It’s, uh,’ Castiel coughs. It’s always a dead giveaway that he’s thinking about something he doesn’t think is omega-appropriate. ‘I’m afraid I - I will have to send you away for a while, shortly.’
Balthazar waves a vague hand. ‘Come on, let me have this. A little bit of secret omega trafficking under cover of darkness. That counts.’
It’s permission enough. Castiel strips off his boots, socks - hesitates again - and then pauses with his hands at his shirt and pants. He has never owned a swimsuit - there has never been much point, in a landlocked state, so although he is familiar with the idea of bathing machines and striped costumes, he has never personally experienced such things. It would be indecent, of course, to expose himself this way if he were likely to see anyone, or to bare so much as his chest in front of a woman or anyone of his own social class.
On the other side of the table, Castiel exhales, heavily. ‘My family,’ he says. ‘We have an annual - gathering - to honour my father’s birthday. It is expected that my brothers and I will each be there, usually bringing our personal valets or attendants.’
He holds that thought in his head as the carriage sways along the road, then folds it up tightly, and puts it away.
The itch rises back up, though. It’s a time later before he realises that he’s shivering in Cas’ arms, enough to make the alpha pull back in alarm - god, it’s gratifying the way Cas’ eyes go wider every time he inhales Dean’s scent, his pupils blown - and then Cas is mumbling, ‘Aren’t you supposed to - shouldn’t you have a nest?’ into Dean’s hair.
Neither of them speak again until the carriage delivers them outside of the station, and then Castiel is busy fussing with tickets and timetables, trying to keep a tight grip on the chain between Dean’s cuffs. There is about forty minutes to wait before their train arrives, which is long enough to visit a street coffee stall for a cup of something that tastes like unsweetened gasoline, and then they find a long bench on the platform and Dean sits silently radiating hostility while Castiel tells him an assortment of interesting facts about the railroad.
; and then he realises his free arm is pulled back, tight as a bowstring, ready to strike the other man again, and when he looks down at Dean’s face there is blood at his mouth for a second time.
Male servants were more expensive than female servants in the 19th century, as they were paid higher wages and - eventually - there was indeed a luxury tax on them that made them less common but a sign of greater social prestige. I translated this to secondary gender rather than primary.
- with a male omega, and so far Michael hasn’t: has pushed and claimed and owned and thoroughly gotten off on exercising his power over Dean in every way but one. The idea of true mates is one of those dumb romanticised things, but all it really means is that Dean is meant to belong to him, as far as Dean can tell. And Benny had been pretty confident that most guys wouldn’t even want to lie with another man, an assertion totally at odds with - well, Dean’s whole life.
It’s not until he’s in bed, and a handful of gravel rattles against the pane of his window, that Dean acknowledges something is truly going on.
‘I plan to educate him.’ Castiel can feel a flush creeping up his collar. ‘Teach him the word of God, the value of hard work, I - it’s none of your business. Why are you here?’
This is set five years before Oscar Wilde's famous trial for 'gross indecency' (here used to mean homosexual acts rather than specifically sodomy, which was a separate offence), but I used elements from it: at a bail hearing for Wilde, hotel chambermaids and a housekeeper similarly testified that they saw young men in his bed and found stains on his sheets.
Chapter specific content warning: Dean tries to bait Cas into physical violence as a way of trying to punish/self-harm, as an outlet for his guilt.
Mrs. Allen flushes a little. ‘I’ll admit that I try to take an active role, as Christ calls us to. I’m sure it must seem very little to you, Mr. Milton.’
He lets Dean manoeuvre him onto his back and crawl on top of him as though Castiel is one big, breathing mattress, and then it is easy to wrap his arms tight around Dean as Dean clings back, limpet-like. It’s how they might lie if they were knotted, and that’s nice to pretend, too. Dean melts into him, lets everything go; doesn’t fight the soft rumble that rises up in his ribcage and escapes with every exhale, not even when Castiel shifts to look at him or presses a tentative hand to the flat of Dean’s back as if he’s something holy; just purrs gently with his chest pressed against Castiel’s, until he falls asleep.
Balthazar snorts. ‘The usual. Polish the chandeliers. Slide down the bannisters from time to time. Can you play piano? Doesn’t matter. Fancy house, plenty of staff around, always a job. And no one will ask questions about where you come from.’
Today, they’ll go out on the trails, and Dean will teach Cas how to shoot - it’s the wrong time of year for hunting, but they’ll get there - and how to fish. He thinks they’re going to like it, side by side in the near silence. Tomorrow, they’ll do something else. They have time; and that future lies ahead of them, as open as the road.
It takes a long time to heat himself a bath, pan of water by pan of water, and he just sits in it for an hour or so, until he doesn’t smell like Cas anymore.
Even without any background knowledge, Dean can understand a certain amount of what’s going on around him. They’ve got a big map up on the main table, divided into state districts, and each one gets marked off when a new set of numbers gets phoned in or delivered by telegraph, but he’s pretty sure it comes down to the overall number of votes in the end: someone keeps calling it a plurality vote, and he has no fucking idea what that means, but from the sound of it it’s basically just counting. It means they get real wound up when the results come in from bigger towns and cities, essentially. They’d telephoned through from Leavenworth a little while ago, and the roar of fury at the loss there had made Dean’s head spin.
The stupid thing about these heats - apart from the fact he has them, some messed up genetic mismatch and his own body’s inability to figure out that
‘I live in Missouri, technically,’ Balthazar explains. ‘The other side of Kansas City. Not so far on the railroad, but far enough to make it difficult to track you, if you’re out of state.’
He is invited to what is described as a family meeting, with Michael in attendance, at 4pm. That’s - new. Perhaps he has pleased them, with his new discipline.
‘I’ll get it dirty,’ he mumbles, without moving. Castiel ignores him. ‘Cas. I will. I’m lying in a wet patch the size of California. Don’t fuck up your blankets.’
‘It’s a sin,’ Dean echoes, shrugging. ‘And it’s fu- it’s illegal, Jesus.’ He’s scrubbing a pot clean in a basin of too-hot water; he fixes his eyes very intently on a burnt-on stain, and redoubles his efforts. He has never heard a gentleman - if Gabriel can be called that - refer so casually to the idea of- of the- of unnatural acts, although it’s impossible, half the time, to figure out what Gabriel actually believes, and what he’s saying to provoke a reaction. Even Castiel, who knows some small fraction of Dean’s history, can barely bring himself to acknowledge the things Dean has done. Dean said ‘sodomy’ like, one time, and Cas practically threw himself on his own sword on the spot.
OKAY SO. First of all, thanks to everyone who's reading this, it means a huge amount and your comments are incredible. I wanted to include a quick note with this one because of how strongly people responded to the last chapter; I obviously knew it was a big moment, but I was still startled by the extent of the reaction. I answered as many as I could, but just to reassure people: I'm very conscious when I'm writing that Dean is a lifelong abuse survivor, and that his thought processes and survival mechanisms are not healthy things, and I promise this isn't presented uncritically or going to go unexamined. I hope his readiness to forgive Cas wasn't triggering or excessively upsetting, but it got a much more visceral/emotional response than I anticipated (which is a good thing, and thank you all for being so invested), and I also hope I'm able to get across (without it being some sort of weird justification of abuse and terrible decisions) that Cas is trapped by societal expectations too, and also has fucked up views and thoughts he hasn't confronted yet. It's definitely a different reading experience going chapter-by-chapter rather than in big chunks like you'd read a novel or a finished fic, so things aren't always going to be addressed straight away, but I do intend for them to be (and I hope I can do so successfully). If you think I need to include more specific warnings in the tags or in my chapter-specific content warnings, please let me know, it's no trouble at all. But otherwise, thank you again <3
. He groans out a long, pained noise, rolling onto his front so that Cas can’t see his face, trying to keep himself from just grinding into the mattress.
his father, of course, very much so. The whole family revolves around his father, or the absence of him: their political legacy descends from him, as does Michael’s public influence. The existence of the Milton House, sprawling across perfect grounds, is owed to him. Each well-disciplined unit of direct heirs and distant relatives is his, reporting for duty on the same night annually, ever ready.
Kansas became the first state to amend its constitution to prohibit all alcoholic beverages in 1881, and made manufacturing alcohol a misdemenor in the same year. However, these laws weren't necessarily enforced as intended, and proprietors kept businesses open by paying a monthly fine of $100 - loopholes meant that some towns actually saw more saloons open. This went on until about 1888 when the temperance movement really kicked in, favouring extreme prohibition policies and electing four successive governors between 1905-1919. Kansas did not repeal prohibition until 1948. The last time Dean would've lived relatively freely/in a non-institutional setting, it would have still been pretty easy for him to get alcohol, though probably not by this point.
There’s a crush at the door, and that’s what puts Cas in arm’s reach of Dean. It honestly doesn’t register in his head until he feels Cas grab for his hand - his
Dean thinks about the strange, blank-eyed alpha who had stared down at him in the dining hall of St. Mary’s; the odd, dispassionate squint, as if Dean were something less than human and his very existence a mild curiosity; the way his fingers had dug hard into the meat of his shoulder as Dean trembled beneath him. The anger, later, had been better. That was how people were supposed to look at Dean: like they wanted to tear him apart. So it had been better.
He knows he has to go back, eventually. Now people in town are aware that he is back in the locality, they will expect to see him there - and he does

Dean’s waiting for the mouth on his dick again, so when he feels the flat of Cas’ tongue swipe over his hole, he’s not too proud to admit he yelps.
‘Not for Catholics,’ Balthazar advises. ‘That’s sort of a one-and-done situation. Otherwise,’ he shrugs, ‘more or less. Might have to fake your death and leave town to do it-’
He’s not sure how she’s doing this, but he has indeed stood up at some point in this little speech. She leans past him to smooth the blankets back down, and he stares.
and lived to tell the tale, let alone when the alpha was trying to say- might have been saying- might have wanted to-
‘Yes,’ he says. ‘I- not a great deal, I live alone. The charwoman comes in most days, but I prefer to live privately - modestly. It’s a source of contention with my family; this is… something of a compromise.’
The irony of Cas getting locked up for fucking Dean - the guy who can’t even look at Dean half the time these days without having a panic attack - after all the other men who’ve fucked Dean and gotten away with it cause no one gave a shit, and Cas being the only one he actually
As a child, the Patient was weak and of a nervous disposition, occasionally suffering sleep terrors, which he outgrew. As a result of his delicate health, he admits to a sheltered childhood, and his deep interest in the Church and quiet occupations such as reading were encouraged by his mother, who ensured unsuitable or overly stimulating materials were kept away from him. Further discussion with the Patient’s mother may be required to confirm this, but the Patient reports his understanding that he was an unusually unresponsive infant, often failing to make eye contact or respond typically to visual stimulus, and was slow and repetitive when learning to talk. These developmental delays appear to have disappeared around the time the Patient learned to read, although he admits to experiencing discomfort as an adult in unstructured conversation or unpredictable situations, which he takes pains to conceal.
In the ensuing consultation, the Patient wept and refused to respond to questioning. The session was accordingly cut short.
The man is a beta, a higher ranking servant - Castiel is aware of the servant tax on beta domestic workers than means fewer families can afford them. He is a status symbol, then. The man bows when Castiel approaches.
Dean hesitates. ‘They fucked you up,’ he suggests, tentatively. ‘At the hospital, the stuff you keep freaking out about. The - sex stuff. They, did they-’
Mrs. Allen makes polite, assenting noises; Castiel tips his head into something that might be a nod. His mother makes no movement at all.
Michael leans back against the desk, watching him appraisingly. He doesn’t seem bothered by Dean’s outrage, or that he’s spoken out of turn again.
He feels, rather than sees, Dean’s hesitation. ‘Yeah, well, they were the only two people on earth, Cas. There weren’t a lot of other options.’
There’s a slight pause while Sam clearly waits to see if Castiel is going to respond, and then says, ‘I think he’s washing,’ which - translated from Sam-speak - means he’s gone out to take a dump.
Dean babbles a handful of bullshit nonsense that even he knows isn’t remotely coherent. ‘Oh my god, Jesus, god. Come the fuck in. Please come in, you can unlock it.’
Sam is still in his nightshirt, sorting through the shelves in search of the least chipped cups available to him. When he sees his brother, he beams - a big, dumb, familiar grin, like the sun breaking across the sky.
His bad knee gives out, and Dean drops, banging his chin hard against the table top and tasting blood.
‘I get it, you’ve been reading the humour columns. I thought you were here to atone, not to irritate me.’
, transforms; suddenly his mouth is soft, his eyes unguarded; he is too beautiful to look at directly, like staring into the sun. Castiel wants to stop speaking, wants to hold onto the moment, wants to let Dean illuminate him. He cannot.  ‘It’s you. My brother, Michael. He believes you are meant for him.’
‘Dean?’ he says softly, outside the bedroom door, and then lets himself in when there is no response.
Fun coping strategies to deal with your horrible, shameful, very-bad wet dreams courtesy of 'Practical remarks on the treatment of spermatorrhoea and some forms of impotence' by John Milton (1854). These were the nice ones. After a while it just degenerates into like, 'STAB YOUR DICK WITH NEEDLES'.
‘Finally got an omega, and he's not going to use you for it?’ says Gabriel mockingly, when he’s over at the house one evening to discuss the arrangement with Cas. He’s probably phrasing it this way - ‘
Naomi is wearing a promenade dress of pale grey silk with faint pinstripes, and it fans around her as she steps down from the carriage. Dean’s hands still.
‘I didn’t want it either,’ he chokes out, and it comes out so much more honest than he means it to be that he momentarily forgets how to keep talking. ‘I- I didn’t want any of it.’
His mother turns cold eyes upon him. ‘These are the consequences of your actions, Castiel. Of your refusal to obey.’
It’s bizarre, the way she’s talking to him, like - like he’s a kid, maybe? Someone who needs to be taken care of? There’s a little mirror hanging over the dresser, but he hasn’t seen his reflection since he arrived; does he look that bad, or is this just how she thinks a male omega should be treated? It’s not how anyone has ever treated him before.
The hall he steps into is surprisingly large, a high-ceilinged room with tall, arched windows that send morning light pouring across the rows and rows of tables and benches. Someone - several someones - have clearly been set to scrubbing the wooden floors; a cluster of enamel buckets and scrubbing brushes lie abandoned underfoot, and that is because in the centre of the aisle two staff members are attempting to restrain a furiously thrashing man, fists flying, snarling in such a way that Castiel assumes he must be an alpha, must work here, until one of the Overseers hits him so hard across the face that Castiel hears the crack of fist against bone and realises - realises this is one of the would-be penitent sinners. Around the brawl, other omegas are shouting; a pretty brunette woman picks up her scrubbing brush and throws it full force at the Overseer in question in a visibly desperate effort to draw him away, and another grabs for her arm and drags her back.
He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care. He twists his shoulders away to steal another mouthful, an ugly gulp working his throat, and then Cas’ hand is fisted in the short hair at the top of Dean’s head and he’s yanking backwards, not as hard as he could. Dean can’t help it; he follows the movement, head dropping back, balance completely thrown, neck exposed - he throws out his spare hand as he stumbles, catching himself, but all he can see is Cas’ face close to his own, the blue eyes burning, all rage and hurt and betrayal. The fist in his hair pulls harder, makes his scalp burn, makes it hurt the way he wants it to.
He waits. Castiel’s hands are curled into fists, but not like he’s about to punch Dean, more like - like he’s digging his nails real hard into the palms of his hand, leaving crescent moon marks behind. He hasn’t taken his hat back off once they came indoors; on a reckless impulse Dean raises his own hand to Castiel’s brow and slides it off his head, letting it fall back down to his side. Cas’ dark hair is rumpled without it, standing up at the back. His eyes track Dean like he’s written in a language he can’t read. They’re shiny, too blue, like he wants to cry.
for Dean, like he was some tragic little omega morality tale. The only mercy there had been that Bobby had already talked Sam through the worst of it, so Dean hadn’t had to retread all that ground over again. Even so, Sam had got tearful as he looked over that first telegram Dean had managed to send to Bobby, and then Cas had gotten up to inspect it for the first time and
got weird about it and stood there for way too long, just staring, repeating the opening words, ‘Bobby, it’s Dean. Been in Hell,’ quietly to himself.
Dean makes an incoherent noise, and then scrunches his face up as Cas comes back in for another kiss. ‘You’ve gotta be joking, I know where that mouth’s been.’
Anyway. The point is, they’re able to take their time now. The point is, Dean’s alpha is dark-eyed and gravel-voiced and his scent is smoky and bright and contented as he learns how to take Dean’s cock deeper in his throat, and how to swallow around him, and how to make Dean’s mind go blank with the all-consuming heat and wetness, and how to slide a finger - and then a second - into Dean’s hole as he works, slow as he can, even though Dean’s so wet he’s gotta be soaking through the mattress at this stage.

Dean is under Michael’s eye tonight, and will be for the next few hours as further results come in, at least until the lead grows big enough to call the race for the night - and that assuming it does, and this doesn’t get dragged out for days while the final counties finish their counts. Cas hadn’t actually
‘No,’ says Castiel, and he sounds almost afraid. His pants are still unbuttoned. He looks like he doesn’t want to be in the same room as Dean for another moment, and maybe that’s fair enough, because presumably he read all those pamphlets about rehabilitating fallen omegas and still didn’t quite figure out that Dean is
He stops resisting for just a second, just enough for Cas to start loosening his grip, wide-eyed, and then bucks away. It’s an inelegant, frantic scramble more than anything else, and Dean loses his balance and pitches against the kitchen tile, spilling more whiskey across the floor and his own hand, but then he’s scrabbling for the door, for the hallway and the staircase, and Cas is on his heels - Cas is
Dean presses his nail against the burnt patch, and the whole thing lifts off like a scab, unexpectedly. ‘Maybe he’s better than most people,’ he says, without looking up.
The man crawls backwards a little, like he’s making a very great effort to do so. Castiel risks a sideways glance; his eyes are slightly unfocused, too.
Whatever: Castiel and Jody come back like ten minutes later, and Dean’s still in the same spot they left him.
He does. He’s lost a little of the hollow-cheeked gauntness that’s always been a side-effect of his irregular - and often entirely forgotten - eating habits. While he still only rarely asks Dean to prepare a main meal during the day, even just the new routine of breakfast in the morning and a supper tray at his desk in the evening has made a difference. He thinks - and now perhaps he is indulging himself - but he thinks Dean quite likes having someone to take care of; so although Castiel is mostly indifferent to food, he makes a dutiful effort to eat whatever Dean brings him.
‘Not very well. Are you staying out here, or do you need to be escorted on my arm like a debutante?’
It doesn’t take long for Dean to finish. There’s come on his fingers, on his lower belly, and he gropes for the edge of the sheet to wipe off that hand, but leaves the other one where it’s pressed inside him the same way he did the other night, the way a knot might remain. It can’t be a convincing facsimile, surely - Castiel doesn’t need to inspect himself to know that his knot is bigger, would stretch Dean further - but it seems to quiet some of the omega need. It’s a strange thing to witness. It seems like it should hurt, rather than cause pleasure.
‘I’ll come over for a couple of hours tomorrow,’ says Jody, and instead of answering Dean can feel his stupid jaw clench, like he’s trying to hold himself back from begging her not to leave him alone with Castiel. Maybe she notices, because she suddenly looks desperately sorry for him, and he doesn’t like that either.
. When he gets closer to pass Castiel the glass, he tries to slow his breathing in the hope it’ll make his scent kind of soothing or something. He knows some omegas can do that; calm an alpha down just by deliberately making their scent go soft and reassuring. He’s never had cause to figure out how to do it, though. Their fingertips brush as he hands the glass over.
‘He’s not going to be here,’ says Gabriel, unexpectedly, after Castiel has been standing there for some time.
‘I’m going to,’ Castiel says, fixing his eyes at some point over Dean’s shoulder, ‘to - I’ve prepared a room for you, upstairs. I think it would be better for you to stay there this afternoon. I have work to do, in my office. Perhaps a rest will help, I think. For you to adjust.’ His chest feels tight, like the air is grating against his lungs. ‘I can bring you some food.’
He still doesn’t go further inside. He perches on a little rickety chair next to the door, instead, by the collection box, and bows his head.
It's not late, when he wakes up - the sun is just starting to get low, ducking beneath the frame of his bedroom window and casting long shadows across the far wall - but the house is quiet. Dean twitches where he lies, face pressed deep into the flat pillow, letting himself feel the burn in his ass without trying to move or respond to it. When he finally lifts his head, the first thing he notices is the pitcher of fresh water that has been placed on the dresser by the wash basin, and the little ceramic jar of arnica. He doesn’t remember Cas putting them there, but it’s something.
They stay like that, for a while. Dean pulls his own shirt off and seems happy to nap in the sun, stretched out like a cat, until a line of sunburn starts to creep across his nose and the top of his cheeks, and more freckles begin to bloom on his exposed skin. Castiel goes in and out of the water, alternating between swimming further laps and trying to cover Dean’s face with his hat whenever he thinks the omega might be asleep, in an effort to protect him from the sun (Dean consistently wakes each time and bats his hand away). After an hour or so, Castiel retrieves the brown paper package from the saddlebags, and unwraps ham and tongue sandwiches in great slabs of crusty bread, and apples, and ginger beer. The lady in the General Store has slipped in two types of cookies: sugar and molasses, which Dean instantly descends upon, although Castiel can’t imagine the lady in the General Store expected them to be eaten in a single bite each. Castiel takes no more than a couple of bites of his own sandwich, and then passes that over to Dean as well and just watches him wolf it down, transfixed.
Castiel doesn’t say anything, but Dean squints woozily into the darkness as he presses a kiss to his temple, as soft as he can.
he’d have to, like she wanted to make him admit it. Her eyes track him, and she says, ‘Perhaps you would sit with me on the bench, then,’ as if it’s a compromise.
That doesn’t sound like them. ‘My thanks,’ he says. ‘You are - the church welcomes all-comers, of course. It would be very pleasant to see you there. Provided it isn’t too far?’
An omega servant sets down a glass of cold lemonade in front of him. Even she smells mated. He drinks down half the glass almost immediately.
He’s been casting around for the words up until this point, but the rightness of these ones fills him with an echo of his own old righteousness.
‘Yeah? He’s eternally been ignoring me for my whole life, maybe. He’s eternally turned his back on - you think there weren’t believers in the Refuge? You think no one there prayed every night, waiting to be saved? Except they weren’t, okay, so what’s it’s gotta be, how bad does it have to get, before God steps in? You got an answer for that?’
Their eyes meet, and for one moment, Castiel’s face is wide open. Raw and exposed. Not an order, but a question.
Dean doesn’t look up from the skillet, but he says, ‘I don’t need to think about it,’ and it comes out gruffer than he means it to. He flips a slice over to brown the other side. ‘I trust Cas.’
His mother is right, of course. Just as it is natural and commendable for an omega to assume their role in the domestic sphere, the angel in the house that acts as the moral heart of one’s household - he has heard a hundred times that no omega can be truly happy until they are a mate and a mother, although it is only now that he thinks of male omegas every time, only now that he has
The building swiftly becomes less pleasant as Castiel follows the Matron out of the receiving area. Beyond a set of heavy double doors the wood panelling disappears, to be replaced with starkly painted walls; enough like a hospital for the hairs on the back of his neck to prickle. Doors line one side of the corridor, and when he glances sideways through one he sees something approaching a schoolroom, cluttered with too many desks, and perhaps five or six gaunt omega women hunched over slates and bibles in silence. They must feel the weight of his eyes upon them, glancing briefly up at him before doubling down again. He wonders if they even wish to return to society, to employment, or if the institution is all they know now.
He keeps thinking about Cas’ brother, about Michael. It’s stupid - the Governor of Kansas is not standing around on Cas’ lawn, watching Dean do his evening chores - but all the same, it’s an idea he struggles to shake. Perhaps it is the thought that at any moment, his body might betray him again, even here. He bolts the back door carefully once he’s done, lets the smell of Cas, of Cas’ territory - a little stronger than usual, this close to his rut - reassure him. That’s pretty fucked up in itself.
rolls his eyes. Castiel remembers his joke, pleased by the thought, and almost wishes that he would. ‘But like, there’s dry and then there’s dry.’
‘Castiel has been training an unfortunate for rehabilitation in society,’ Anna says. ‘He is quite the Josephine Butler.’
Sure, he’d seen it, in between witnessing some weird fucking fight between Castiel and his brother, and then getting the shit beat out of him. Dean’s only been awake less than ten minutes and he’s already tired. Luckily Jody isn’t waiting for an answer; she’s already pushed her shirtsleeves halfway up her arms and heaved a large coffee pot onto the range to boil, and is retrieving a skillet, presumably for the aforementioned eggs. She’s talking the whole time, but in a business-like sort of way, kind of brusque, which sort of helps.
He hunches over himself, turning his back; there are a few moments of hesitation from Castiel behind him while Dean works himself, hot and trembling and embarrassed, and then he flinches as Cas lifts a cautious hand and runs it soothingly up and down over Dean’s shoulders. It’s the weirdest way he’s ever done this - the bizarre disconnect of Dean’s frantic movements, and the alpha petting his back - but it works, something works, because it’s only a handful of seconds before Dean spills over his hand, before his brain lights up for just a moment of relief. He’s too conscious of Cas sitting beside him to make any real sound, and it’s barely even satisfying anyway - the second it’s done he stops wanting that and starts wanting something else, starts remembering the heat of Cas inside him, and he wants
Dean has not spoken about the nightmares. Dean has, actually, spoken precious little at all since the night of the dinner party, as if something he thought was sealed away has cracked open, a whisper-thin seam running through his self-control that could easily break entirely. All the same, Castiel is aware of them now - wonders if this has been happening the whole time, beneath his notice, and Castiel had just been too scared to approach Dean’s bedroom door to realise - and he can’t stop being aware. He can’t stop replaying everything Dean has ever said about his past life, like it’s a code he can break, like he watches Dean’s face for long enough he will know whatever it is Dean keeps reliving. He thinks a lot about the rabbit-quick pulse in Dean’s throat as Michael marked him.
He’s sent on two more errands - one to the study, to fetch a file of papers and speeches, and one to bring Michael a drink - before he next gets outside.
‘Very well,’ and when she stands, Castiel does too, tense for reasons he does not quite know how to verbalise, even in his own mind. ‘If you’ll join me, Mr. Novak, I’d be quite happy to introduce you to some of our more wretched souls.’
He wipes himself off with his bunched up underwear and tugs his clothes back on and goes to the outhouse to try and clean himself out with a rag and his fingers; and then he goes to the house to heat a bucket of water and drag it back to the little church, and he gets on his hands and knees to scrub the stains out of the carpet. It takes a while, and his body doesn’t like the movement, and he’s almost done when he realises the cushion is soaked through too and he’s not sure how to fix it. Everything smells of sex, of the two of them. He opens the couple of windows at the back that open - the ones that aren’t stained glass - to try and air it out, and then he gives up on that and trudges back to the house for carbolic soap and baking soda and commits himself to scrubbing the whole floor. The harsh smell of the soap helps, and so does furniture polish once he takes it to the dark wood of the altar and the first few pews; and then he’s started so he may as well do the rest of them.
Consultation with the Patient following fourth session of electrical stimulation and aversion therapy. This is the first time the Patient has been in a suitable state for dialogue following sessions, which appear to distress him disproportionately. It has been explained to him that this is in fact a most positive outcome: it is likely that these sessions will be most effective, based upon the extreme effect such therapies appear to have upon his nervous state.
Thirdly… thirdly, Dean knows he should wake Cas and let him know there’s someone outside. But that would involve going into the bedroom of an alpha whose rut is less than 24 hours away, alone, and trying to wake him. Dean’s not stupid.
Update on treatments: Patient continues to respond well to hypnotic suggestion and sits quietly during session, as though a moral transformation has taken place. He asserts that he has not masturbated since treatment commenced and has had no desire to do so, and that he has had no dreams of men this week, but dreamed twice of women, though only platonically. He finds himself increasingly lethargic and apparently suffers for the want of mental and sensual satisfaction.
It’s better once the two women lapse into their own conversation - some artist of whom they’re both fond, who paints scenes from Greek mythology - and he has to do nothing but listen and walk.
‘I am,’ he says, ‘I am - susceptible - to the sin of wrath. At times. I remind myself of Jesus’ words; that anger is an offence to God, a sign of - a lack of faith. Our Father’s love will drive it from our hearts.’
Other than hymns, Castiel doesn’t know any songs at all. ‘I like yours,’ he says, after a second. ‘I like listening to you.’
Cas’ knee is jammed between Dean’s legs. His body is coiled over him, and the air between their bodies is so hot it’s practically bubbling, and Dean tips his head back, bares his throat, underbelly exposed. He should be afraid, but he isn’t.
Dean shrugs again, uselessly. He keeps thinking about the look on Castiel’s face, outside the church, when the nicely dressed ladies had all been staring at him in horror and Cas had looked like - betrayed, or hurt, or like he’d hoped Dean could be something and was realising all at once how wrong he’d been. However angry anyone had ever been with Dean - and plenty of people had been plenty angry - he couldn’t think of anyone who’d ever been
‘Shhhhh,’ Cas repeats, but then his lips are curving upwards against Dean’s own, and Dean’s laughing, and the kiss dissolves until their noses are just bumping together and Dean’s trying to shove Cas back down between his legs.
‘Come with me.’ Castiel’s voice is clipped. He starts walking towards the house, so fast that Dean is forced to practically jog alongside him, fingertips pressing hard into the meat of Dean’s arm. Dean’s been dragged along like this before - this is how his dad would look back when he was a kid, right when he was about to take the belt to him; how he’s been pushed around a hundred times, or pinned down, or restrained - but not here. He’s never seen Cas’ face this cold.
The Patient’s family is deeply religious, and he was raised in the religious way, with a great devotion to his duty and a strong sense of morality. He has worked as a pastor in the Church for his entire adult life, following his education in the seminary, and has been a committed and respected pillar of the community. However, he grew increasingly distressed once again as we discussed this in our consultation. He refers to scripture often as a method of calming his discomfort.
With no small effort, Castiel pushes down his rising temper. He grabs the chain between Dean’s cuffs and stalks forward towards the front door without slowing his pace, so that Gabriel is forced to dart out of the way - which he does, because for a beta who constantly forces confrontation, Gabriel really hates confrontation - and Castiel is able to finally shoulder his way back into his own house.
“Dean.” Cas replied, exasperated. The list of questions had been never ending and Castiel’s response of ‘I don’t know’ unchanging.
“Because- I-“ he swallowed “-why do you think Cas?” Dean half whispered. His voice sounded choked. He couldn’t understand why his eyes were watering in that moment. Why did he feel like he was drowning? Why was he so scared?
Dean’s hands grazed gently over the other man’s face, stubble prickling under his skin. He sighed as Cas pulled him closer by the waist, his hands unable to settle like Dean’s - wandering all over his torso as their mouths moved together. Stroking his thumb along Cas’ jaw, Dean pulled away for a moment to smile at the angel before him.
“I was thinking, what if we threw a surprise party for him?” Dean suggested hesitantly, not making eye contact as he spoke.
Dean gave him an annoyed glance before his face lit up as something suddenly hit him. “Wait does this mean you already know what he’s getting me for my birthday?”
