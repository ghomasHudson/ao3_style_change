Now: “This next round is about angels,” announces Jo from the trivia table. Dean is pretty sure both he and Sam have identical deer-in-headlights expressions right now.
“Shit,” mutters Dean, as the pain in his knees radiates upwards. It’s not serious, but it is a reminder of why he doesn’t really skate as much at his age as he used to. Castiel looks momentarily stunned from where he’s lying just below Dean, wide blue eyes gazing back up at him. Dean’s stupid, dumbass heart skips a beat.
“Apologies,” says Castiel in a tone that suggests he’s not actually that sorry. Dean briefly marvels at the apparent ability for angels to be sarcastic, but then shrugs and moves on.
Dean bites back a retort to that, turning instead to offer Castiel a refill on his onion rings. Castiel hands him his plate, and Dean takes a swig of his ever-filled beer bottle and ducks into the kitchen.
His foot catches on a tree root, causing him to stumble forward and knock Castiel down with him for the second time that day. Unfortunately, this time they’re at the top of a small hill, so the two of them tumble down the slope together until they come to a stop beneath a towering, bare oak.
“I mean, given what I know about Dean, I’d have thought the last thing he’d ever do is get caught up in a fanfiction-level romantic entanglement, but stranger things have happened.”
Dean’s had a lot of fun over the years, through his channel. He’s gone to crazy places, done some crazy stuff. But he’s never had as much fun as he is now, gliding in circles on the ice with an Angel of the Lord pulling him along.
Gabriel is mildly OOC because I might have combined him with Good Omens!Gabriel (whoops). There's some other mild references to Good Omens, too.
“Yes, Dean, you should take your friend home,” says Jo slyly, winking at him. “You’re good to drive, right?”
@S. Beckmann well, yeah, because it was his brother’s project? and even if it wasn’t his baby personally he did his best ok. dean girls can be so annoying
“I dunno; we’ll figure it out.” Dean extends his hand, and Castiel takes it, and as they move together to the music, Castiel closes his eyes and believes that Heaven is, indeed, a place on Earth.
“I can’t force you to change,” says Castiel, looking up at him simply. He slowly rises, and John takes a couple steps back. “You have to really want it. If you really want that cycle broken, you can’t wait on your sons to fix it. You need to do it yourself.”
Jo punches him lightly on the forearm. “You’re an onion ring junkie procrastinating on making up with his boyfriend. Pretty damn human, if you ask me.”
“Man, I know Dean has first dibs once you both get your acts together, but if he continues to screw the pooch, I’ll take you instead,” she declares. “You could be my beard, get my old foster mom off my back about all the nice Jewish boys I left behind in Chicago.”
done before midnight, actually.” Jo’s smile is downright wicked. “It’s tradition to kiss someone at midnight on New Year’s, after all.”
“I do so love happy endings,” says Jo as she plops down in the booth across from Castiel with a basket of onion rings and a beer, nodding towards the bar where Charlie and Stevie are in deep conversation. “I hope they can find something that works for them.”
“This is my house,” retorts Dean, choking down his ‘you get a room’ almost as quickly as he thinks it. Sam raises an eyebrow, so Dean grumbles “let’s eat” instead, and goes to get the other plates.
“And when will your work be done?” wonders Sam. “I mean, you told me and Dean you’d be here until New Year’s. What comes after that?”
ESH. I wish I could say N T A, because I know you mean well, but people need time to accept their own flaws. If you straight-up tell someone they have issues, it’s not gonna go well. I’d be a bit more subtle about it next time. Hope it works out!
“I wouldn’t know,” he says, after a moment. “But considering he doesn’t approve of what I’ve done with my life so far, it’s fair to assume he’d assume the worst.”
[PHOTO: Photo of the cute bartender with the platinum blond pixie cut leaning against Charlie Bradbury, with Sam and Dean in the booth across from them. An array of half-drunk pints and a stack of empty food baskets sit on the table between them.]
“Well,” sighs Castiel, “in all of my years, I have met very few people who can touch hearts like you do. Your love is the glue that holds so many of your friends and family together. You know how to make Heaven on Earth, Dean. You just need to let yourself through the gates once in a while.”
Jo is announcing the first question. “What’s the title of the original German film that was the basis for the 1998 film
“Considering where you come from, I’ll take that as high praise.” Dean smiles over his own forkful. The pie could do with a little warming, but even as-is it’s quite delicious. “This one’s actually my mom’s recipe.”
Sammy and I will probably continue to make videos, and Eileen might be in them, too, and… I think my dad’s warmed up a little to the channel, too? Stranger things have happened. But Sam will also have his law practice, which will be all the world-saving stuff he deserves, and I’ll be here when he wants to hang up his superhero cape and shoot the shit or something.
“Would’ve had less if someone didn’t refill my bottle every time,” remarks Dean, smiling in spite of himself. He heads to the kitchen, crosses to the fridge, and contemplates its contents. “We didn’t get to have the pies I made today,” he notes suddenly, a little disappointed.
The drive back home is the longest it’s ever been. Dean feels like he’s caught in some strange emotional purgatory, a liminal space between friendship and relationship where every move Castiel makes in the passenger seat sears itself into Dean’s consciousness.
Dean sighs at that. Honestly, none of this even remotely approaches being an angel’s business. Surely Castiel had better things to do, like spy on babies or bring dogs to heaven or something?
“Sure.” Castiel sits down at the kitchen table, loading each plate with a slice of pie as Dean fights with the ice cream tub for a couple generous scoops. “Where did you learn to make these?”
Sam calling Crowley a coward for not showing up when they tried to summon him is some Big Dick Energy omg
“I apologise for keeping you awake longer than you should be,” he says. “Angels don’t require sleep, so I can leave. Go wait in a park or something.”
that glows so faintly deep inside him, this little ember in his heart that burns every time Castiel looks at him — this is impermanent, too.
“Movie Bond and Q, then,” amends Dean, even as he feels his ears heating at how quickly the angel had poked holes in his analogy. “Look, I know I’m a dashing lady-killer of a man, but you’re probably going to meet my dad at that Christmas party, and the last thing I need is for him to have one more reason to hate me.”
So, yes, Dean Winchester is bothered. And it’s not just the missing angel that’s the problem — even though he’s had months to grasp the concept of Sam moving out of the house, something about this impending loss still makes his stomach knot and harden. This year is his and Sam’s last Christmas together like this: both (term used loosely in Dean’s case) functional adults, both under the same roof, both capable of buying each other all the random crap they never got to have as children.
Dean snorts, and wags his croissant at the angel. “Again, accidentally faking the second coming of Christ is at the bottom of my to-do list,” he says. “Now, three, all of this must be over by New Year’s Day, so let’s… keep it friendly, okay?”
“Oh, no, he’s been a polite guest,” says Bobby. “I just —” His expression scrunches, as if he’s pushing down something unpleasant. Dean has his suspicions, so he pulls Castiel in a little closer.
“Well, Charlie showed me a show about a necromancer and his righteous boyfriend, and that was pretty interesting.”
Dean snorts at that. “Life isn’t a shitty Hallmark Christmas movie,” he says, though Sam’s sidelong glance at the literal angel sitting in their booth briefly evaporates his words. “I mean — you’re coming to Bobby’s party tomorrow, aren’t you?”
“Dudley? Really? An angel named Dudley? That’s too much.” Charlie shakes her head, swatting at Castiel. The angel chuckles as well, his eyes crinkled and warm in the dim light of the bar.
“I’m sorry that I’m dragging my heels so much on this,” she admits, “but I keep worrying about what might happen if I mess it up. I mean —” she sighs, “she works for you guys, I’m sorta your friend… if something goes wrong, it’s like a domino chain of weird.”
, per se. He’s already done all of the relevant panicking during his quarter-life crisis, when his young and scruffy community college accounting professor had smiled at him after his finals and said in a sweet Texas drawl
oh you wanna talk annoying? sam girls have been harassing eileen for the past how many months now? ableist dicks
“Merry Christmas, son,” says John Winchester. He pulls back, claps Dean’s shoulders. “Heard you’d be contributing to the food tonight. Try not to kill us, huh?”
Favorite Moment: “So, on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being ‘more private than a Swiss bank account’ and 10 being ‘footage of me taking a dump might be uploaded to PornHub later’: what’s the creep factor of your stall?”
“My time here is almost done,” replies Castiel, looking at them. At these two frail, wonderful humans and all the love they have for one another. For a moment, he envies them. Envies them not only for their place in God’s heart, not only for the peace that will be granted them when they finally pass on, not only for their capacities to desire and savour — but also for their proximity to Dean Winchester. “And when it is, I might not be able to come back, ever.”
“He and Eileen ducked out already,” says Bobby. “Something about a private present exchange, or whatever the kids are calling it these days.”
“I think it’s pretty convenient that the elevator’s machinery suddenly decided to crap out when Sam went in and insulted a ghost,” replies Dean.
“It’s trivia night,” says Sam, in an obvious attempt to change the subject. He nods to where Ash and Ellen are setting up a projector by the sound system. “I think the game’s starting soon. Want me to enter us?”
“Cas?” he manages weakly. The angel’s face swims into view. His body is solid and heavy against Dean’s, and just behind his head floats a halo of a too-familiar bush.
“We all have mean streaks.” Jo sighs, squeezes his hand. “Some of us just try to minimise the collateral damage when it shows up.”
“What’s so special about him?” Gabriel, his brother, wonders as Castiel watches a video of a certain black Chevy Impala tearing down the back roads of Lawrence, Kansas. “He’s just a hairless ape. A funny one, sure, but there’s a billion other funny ones out there.”
Castiel says nothing. When Dean peeks back over his shoulder, the spot beside his bed is empty. With a sigh, he presses his hands to his eyes and tries to fall back asleep, but it doesn’t seem to return as easily as it could have just minutes before.
mixed up), a round about the Nativity (which, for some reason, the actual angel in their group knew the least about), and a round about shitty Hallmark Christmas movies. Their team was in third place, though, thanks in part to both Charlie and Sam’s incredible memories and Dean’s competitive streak. Even Castiel, after being humbled by the Nativity questions, recovered a bit in the shitty Hallmark movies category.
Dean opens his mouth to protest, to say that Castiel wouldn’t be with him come New Year’s, but somehow the words won’t come. As if part of him doesn’t want to set Castiel’s departure in stone.
He reaches for Dean, but Dean is already recoiling, stepping away from Castiel as if the increased distance will make the words hurt less. “Get out,” he says.
“Never,” he confirms. “Or at least, not in your lifetime. Upper management can’t afford us making emotional attachments. It’s like grit in a microscope.”
Castiel’s eyes narrow, as if he’s scrutinising every inch of Dean’s face. Dean feels pinned down and laid bare, despite knowing he’s definitely wearing clothes.
“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” wonders Sam, nodding towards the bar with a smirk. Charlie slumps, thudding her head onto the table.
“One thing I miss is how nice the convenience stores are over there,” Bobby is saying as Dean sidles up and presses the refilled plate of onion rings into Castiel’s hands. “You can pay your taxes at a Japanese one. That’s a level of trust with your local Gas n’ Sip that you just can’t get in America.”
This is one of their last pub nights like this. Sam may just be moving out, but with the way things are going, Dean’s pretty sure his baby brother will be taking the proverbial arrow to the knee within a year or two. And it’s not like he hates Eileen — she’s wonderful, and dedicated, and clever, and would make a fantastic sister-in-law.
He’d heard rumours, years ago, about an old colleague who’d been assigned to London and had picked up a lifestyle of culinary hedonism.
“Nice to meet you, Jimmy,” says John, extending his hand. “Can’t believe you take time out of your day to watch my son make a prat of himself on the Internet, but hey, guess it pays off.”
Jo’s eyes light up. “A Team Free Will fan?” she asks. Castiel nods. “Did you see the episodes I was in?”
Dean sighs, deflates imperceptibly. He reaches out, brushes his fingers against the back of Castiel’s hand. The very wake of his touch feels electric.
,” concedes Dean. He goes to grab the last onion ring in the basket, only to find that the entire thing has been refilled while he wasn’t looking. Immediately, he looks at Castiel, and the angel merely winks in response as he takes another onion ring.
“This vessel is human,” says Castiel simply. “Thus, it is susceptible to the wants and needs of the flesh.”
Dean blinks a little more rapidly than normal, coughs into his fist, sighs. “So — you’ll just go back to Heaven, then? And wait for the next person who needs you?”
Uncle Bobby lives in a relatively wooded part of town, where the nearest neighbours are separated by a couple hundred feet of forest and fields. When they were younger, Dean and Sam would go with him down to the little creek deep in the woods to hunt and fish.
Dean wakes for real to the sound of children laughing outside his window. He stumbles into his bathrobe and goes to the window, and is momentarily blinded by white from as far as the eye can see.
“Jimmy! You’re here!” Jo is immediately there, this time providing a flute of champagne alongside his usual basket of onion rings. “Glad you could make it. Have you met with Dean yet?”
“Easy for you to say; you’ve already got a hot girlfriend,” mutters Charlie. She takes another swig of Dean’s beer, grimaces harder, and pushes Sam out of the booth so she can stumble over towards the bar. Castiel watches all of this in clear bemusement.
“Jimmy,” says Castiel pleasantly, extending a hand for her to shake. “I’m a… friend of the channel.”
“Oh god, the Mom Squad broke out the karaoke,” mutters Jo. Sure enough, the sound of Mariah Carey drowned out under the louder cacophony of four drunken women warbles out from the living room. “I should probably go make sure they don’t set anything on fire.”
“Don’t fall in love,” replies Castiel, the corner of his lips twitching upwards in mild amusement, almost as if he thinks the rule is more than a little redundant.
Castiel does. And while he’s busy admiring the other fidget spinners that the shop has to offer, Dean finds himself perusing a rack of socks and gloves. A blue pair of gloves knitted with little angels jumps out at him in particular, and he grabs it without a second thought.
“How are you?” adds Eileen, gesturing towards the sofa. Castiel sits down, and Sam pours him a glass of cucumber mint-infused water. Castiel takes it with a nod of thanks. “How is Dean?”
It’s just tradition. He doesn’t have to do it. And even if he did, it doesn’t have to mean anything.
Dean cranes his neck towards the bar. Sure enough, a pretty girl with dark skin and a platinum blonde pixie cut is pouring a pint of Guinness. “Damn,” he says.
“I enjoyed it,” admits the angel, grinning despite the tears already trickling down his cheeks. “Dean, before I go, I just wanted to say —”
He’s been in this little town for so much of his life that the local scenery just sort of blends together. Driving down the streets is muscle memory at this point, and almost every face he sees is familiar. But there’s something about Castiel’s presence that makes the experience almost brand-new, as he tries to point out interesting buildings to the angel as they join the Christmas Eve shopping rush.
What fan raffle? He would’ve at least opened it to his patrons, and I definitely didn’t get any notifs about that.
-A couple lines: "This is heaven", "If you're wicked, then so am I", "You know how to make Heaven on Earth" are shamelessly borrowed from The Bishop's Wife.
The intersection of two human beings is already a dangerous, complicated situation. Castiel can only imagine it gets worse at the intersection of angel and human.
“And baller prizes for the winners,” adds Charlie, nodding towards the table where Ellen and Ash are now opening up the first set of questions. “I heard one of them is a twenty-five dollar gift card to the comics store.”
(He’d always pay Sam back by letting him lick the spoon and take the lion’s share of the finished goods, so it was win-win for both of them.)
[VIDEO: Phone camera footage of a fluffy white dog wagging his tail in the snow. The camera tilts up from the dog to show a decent-sized ice rink filled with skaters. At one point, Dean and Castiel skate into view, Dean clutching onto Castiel’s arm for dear life.]
“I’ve been dreaming about Harvelle’s beer-battered onion rings,” says Dean as he gets the door for them. Sam immediately shuffles off to find them an empty booth, while Castiel lingers a bit longer, staring between Dean and the bar as if unsure what to do next.
.” Charlie’s tone is sardonic as she puts air quotes around ‘Christmas magic’ with a roll of her eyes. “You know, that thing where you try desperately not to be lonely for Christmas so you’ll ask anyone out with a pretty face and a pulse? And it all falls apart by January because once the champagne’s popped you realise you’ve got nothing in common after all?”
“Errands,” says Dean, opening the garage door upon a mostly-cleared and de-iced driveway. Sam’s car is already gone — he and Eileen had their own Christmas shopping to do. “Come on, before the snow piles up again.”
When Jo finally leaves with their orders, Castiel turns to Dean with a raised eyebrow. “You two have history,” he remarks.
“You say that like Dean isn’t going to be pre-gaming for the party,” teases Charlie. “Plus, Rufus and I had plans to get Chinese food and watch
-"He hasn’t danced since the fall of Constantinople, and the weird pin-headed jives so popular in Heaven aren’t exactly his style." is a direct reference to the age-old question "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"
“Here,” he says to Castiel, handing him the gloves and tossing his card at the cashier. “Your hands are cold; put these on.”
“What is this?” wonders the angel, pulling the chain on a salmon plaque next to their table. He jumps in alarm when it bursts into life with a cackle, causing Dean to snort.
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice breaks through his thoughts, jerks him back to the present. They’re already back in his garage, and the angel’s concern makes him look more adorable than he should. “We’re home.”
“That statue of Buddy Christ in my kitchen is from the movie,” continues Dean. “Alan Rickman Metatron is from the movie.”
Dean would’ve retorted something to that, but the words die in his throat when he hears the back door open to admit someone else into their moment.
Castiel falls in love on a Thursday, in a pristine white cubicle in Heaven, smiling over a video of a dirty-blond, salt-of-the-earth, All-American man running around his hometown asking people about their opinions of the local public restrooms.
“I could help with that, you know,” says Castiel’s voice, somewhere to the right of his pillow. Dean curses again.
“They dangle it in front of me like a carrot.” Eileen’s shoulders slump. Sam puts an arm around her briefly and kisses the top of her head before returning to his cooking. Dean looks over at Castiel, who seems to be deep in thought.
“Yeah, likely story.” Jo snorts. “You were staring at him like a lost puppy all night. The rest of us have eyes, you know.”
“Like… Canada?” wonders Deputy Hanscum. “Canada’s a wonderful place. I was just up in Vancouver this summer. Gorgeous city. Best Chinese food I’ve ever had.”
Castiel looks over at Eileen, who is now pouring them all coffee. “Convincing her workplace to give her tenure and hire additional disabled academicians to lessen her workload as the sole accessibility representative on campus? Would take a miracle, and you said no miracles.”
(Gabriel does not, in fact, take care of it. Castiel never got the full story, but his brother makes it a point to Never Mention the Incident in London ever again, and Castiel knows better than to pry.)
“You mean, this pie?” wonders Castiel, producing a tupperware container out of seemingly nowhere. Dean opens it to see one of the carefully-latticed apple pies he and Mrs Singer had made this afternoon, already sliced up for their convenience.
“Dean,” he breathes, gestures to the seat opposite him. Dean slides in, places the trenchcoat on the table, and slides it across to Castiel.
“Hm.” The archangel contemplates the items and the video, and then examines Castiel’s request again. “Standard procedure guarantees that time will cure you of whatever emotions that hairless ape called Dean Winchester has stuck into your mind.”
“You left this at my place,” he explains, the low husk of his voice tugging at Castiel’s vessel’s gut. It’s overwhelming in the best way possible. “Thought I should return it before you left.”
Rule three was there for a reason. Rule three was supposed to protect both of them, insure that their common interests weren’t completely fucked over by emotional entanglements. Castiel was meant to be his friend for the holidays, nothing more.
“I had a lot of half-baked ideas about love when I was younger,” continues Jo. “And I’d thought for a very long time that maybe he was my soulmate or something. That maybe he’d been brought into my life as a long-time friend because we were meant to take it slow, that he was meant to wake up one morning after we’d long since moved in together and realise he loved me. It was a story that made sense to me, you know? Beauty and the Beast, and all of that.”
It’s a confession, like that of a penitent sinner before God. Castiel is not God, but something in John must have recognised the grace in him. Castiel kneels down, touches the two fish lying in the cooler, and causes them to multiply.
“Scoot over,” replies Jo, moving to sit down on the steps beside him. Dean acquiesces, letting her lean her head on his shoulder from force of habit.
“Don’t look down.” Castiel grabs his chin and tilts his face back up, which is entirely the wrong move for someone who’s supposed to be pretending to be just a friend. Dean’s knees go weak again, which causes Castiel’s arms to swoop out to steady him.
Charlie, quench your thirst,” says Dean, pushing his beer towards her. She takes a sip and grimaces.
“He won a fan raffle to spend the holidays with us,” says Sam, clapping Castiel on the shoulder. “He’s coming to Bobby’s party tomorrow. You’ll be there, too, right?”
“Do you want that specific bartender, or do you just want to enter the new year a little less lonely?”
Dean huffs. “Of course.” The music suddenly changes, causing Dean to perk up and leap to his feet. “Dance with me, Cas.”
Dean barely remembers what happened last night. He’d poured himself a whiskey after posting the update video, and he remembers refilling his glass after getting a text from Uncle Bobby about the upcoming Christmas party that he’s hosting. Someone — probably Sam — had volunteered Dean’s cooking skills for the shindig, and there’s rumours that even their dad might show up.
“All the more reason to blow his hairless ape mind,” says Gabriel, rolling his eyes. “These two fools don’t realise it’s our efforts down there that keep them safe from all the stuff they talk about in their Ghostbusters videos. Honestly, Muggles will believe anything we tell them.”
I’m just like Dean in that I believe there’s something else beyond our perception but it doesn’t always want to make itself known. Whether that’s ghosts or demons or angels or whatever, I think that something else doesn’t necessarily have to be 100% good or 100% evil. They’re as neutral as human beings are.
“It tickles,” he remarks drily. Castiel shrugs. He then produces the fidget spinner he’d gotten from his first night, and hands it over, too. “How many things from Earth did you get?”
And with that, she pads away to bed, and Castiel is left perched on a bright yellow suede sofa with only the memory of Dean’s kisses to keep him company.
“Dean doesn’t believe in angels,” says Castiel, pulling up the relevant video. “He thinks Anna was just a crazy woman.”
“That makes it worse,” says Charlie. “I don’t want to make it look like I’m… you know, taking advantage. And I don’t want to make any major moves right
“Good for her,” replies Dean. He hates that it’s half-hearted. Jo’s a good girl, really, and despite what happened before she has since readily volunteered her time for his and Sam’s videos. She wants the best for him, and likewise he only wants the best for her.
It takes Dean a couple minutes to catch his breath. His legs are aching, his head is spinning, but nothing can beat the thunderous pounding of his heart. The entire thing is pounding against his ribcage so hard that he fears it might burst out of him like the alien in that one movie, and Castiel’s proximity isn’t doing it any favours.
It’d been cold these past few weeks, with only piddling droplets of snow once in a while. But today, on Christmas Eve, there’s more than an inch of snow on the ground and the neighbourhood children are going nuts about it.
So that’s it. That’s Sam, moving out. Moving on. And it’s gonna be a little weird for a little while, I know, but that’s just how it is. At some point in our lives I gotta give my baby brother up. Gotta let him spread his wings and fly the nest. It was already a miracle that I got all these extra years with him after the accident with Jess. He was in a really dark place for a while, and I like to think our stupid little channel helped him get out of it a bit.
The angel has added a blue flannel scarf to his trench coat ensemble. Dean is tickled at the way the scarf doesn’t hide the mild red flush seeping into his cheeks.
“So, how long are you here as my backup?” he wonders. “Just for the party? Or is this an on-call sort of thing?”
But in the meantime, he sits on yet another couch in yet another apartment, and soaks in the last dredges of human life for as long as he can.
“You apologise to Jimmy,” he hisses, just as Castiel pulls him back and Bobby puts himself in between the two of them. Dean can vaguely hear the other guests, but all of his anger is focused in sharp clarity at his father’s beer-soaked visage and alcohol-reddened smirk.
Dean is all too happy to throw himself into the hands-on work ahead of him. By the time the other guests for the evening begin pouring into the house, he’s gotten the pies baking, the potatoes mashed, and the gravy mixed.
The Mom Squad is singing “Auld Lang Syne”. The screens are filled with footage of fireworks and parties and the Times Square ball drop. Dean wishes he could take Castiel there, wishes he could see Castiel’s reaction to a big human city like New York.
“How have you been?” wonders Dean after a moment. His fingers twitch towards the onion rings, so Castiel gestures for him to help himself.
Favorite Moment: “The dog’s name is Miracle, and if anything happens to her I will kill everyone in this haunted house and then myself.”
Rule three was a wall constructed to freeze them apart, and right now it’s melting just as fast as the ice cream had. Castiel bites his lip — are angels even
imagine winning a raffle to spend christmas with dean winchester. there’s gotta be a fic on wattpad with that exact premise
“University admin is offering her tenure and a commitment to lessen her workload by hiring more disabled faculty,” explains Sam.
Dean just doesn’t like to be left behind, and that truth fills him like smoke in the lungs, tangles with his throat until it’s hard to breathe. He downs another swig of his beer, before Charlie’s laughter knocks him out of his stupor completely.
“And it involves Dean, doesn’t it?” asks Charlie. She clucks her tongue in sympathy. “Knew this would happen sooner rather than later. Bobby owes me five bucks.”
Dean nearly drops the ornament in his hands when he pulls away from the tree to see Castiel now standing in his living room. The so-called angel is wearing a dirty beige trench coat, a messy blue tie, and a quizzical expression.
“Yes,” agrees Castiel. “For one, I’m not actually called Jimmy.” Charlie raises an eyebrow, so he continues, “I’m actually an angel. Named Castiel.”
“Not yet,” she says. “But he should be showing up sometime soon. I heard he was making a move-out video with Sam and his dad today.”
Castiel quickly files that into his ‘delightfully human excuses to kiss people’ folder alongside mistletoe, with memories of a certain snowy walk flashing back in his mind’s eye.
“Yeah, coffee and a croissant. It’s a free country,” he adds, when Sam arches a disapproving eyebrow at him. “Saving up my cooking juju for tomorrow.”
The compliment is supposed to be fake, but the sentiment behind it hits Dean in the gut nonetheless. He looks at Castiel, and the angel winks at him as he follows John into the foyer. Dean brings up the rear, carrying the bag with the ham and roast beef.
“We’ve got sweet potatoes in one oven and green bean casserole in the other,” says Mrs Singer as she unpacks the ham and roast beef. “And I’m guessing this just needs a bit of a reheat before serving?”
Can you help me pick up the honey-glazed ham and the roast beef? I already placed the order but I can’t pick it up because I’ll be supervising the oven. Bobby’s on a booze and present run and I didn’t want to add to his workload.
“Certain beliefs,” repeats John. He reels in another fish. “By the time the doctors found the cancer inside her it was too late. It was her idea to walk away. She didn’t want the boys seeing her dying.”
“It looks like there’s an ice rink at the park,” he remarks, before looking at Castiel. “The city said they probably wouldn’t have the weather for skating this year.”
“You know, if you show up in one of their videos you might have a chance to break the Internet,” remarks Gabriel.
-The Incident in London and Castiel's almost-victory gavotte are references to Aziraphale from Good Omens. fantastic book and show, please watch it!!
Dean suddenly notices that he has been clutching the edge of his chair. Quickly standing up, he takes his plate and mug with him to the sink to tidy up instead. He can still feel Castiel’s gaze boring into the back of his head, though, as he starts chasing the crumbs off his plate into the garbage disposal.
“Never had reason to leave,” admits Dean. “Mom left me the house when she passed; I had a decent job with Bobby at his garage before I started Team Free Will; my channel pays for all of my adventures. Sammy’s the one who keeps trying to run away.”
They get the cameras up and rolling again, to catch footage of them heading to the central crypt. But along the way, a flash of light behind a headstone catches Dean’s eye.
“You said, and I quote: ‘oh god, I need backup for a goddamn Christmas party’,” Castiel supplies helpfully.
“The scores are back!” announces Jo suddenly. “Team Free Will scored the highest of this batch, with all 10 questions correct!”
“Nice try,” says Jo, rolling her eyes as she puts the slip of paper back into the pocket of his flannel shirt. “It activates in January.”
“Glad to have you here,” says Dean, as Sam waves Jo back to get Charlie a drink as well. “We’re gonna kick this thing in the ass.”
This emotional purgatory is uncharted territory for Dean. While he’s acknowledged a long while ago that it was entirely possible for him to be attracted to men, knowing that in theory isn’t quite the same as experiencing it in practice. Nothing ever came of his thing for his professor, after all, and he’s just generally more comfortable remaining in familiar courtship cycles with reasonably attractive women.
Sam and Eileen jump apart the moment Dean enters. “Oh, don’t mind me,” says Dean as he heads to the leftover food trays piled on the kitchen island. “Carry on.”
Dean laughs, and then goes to fetch plates, forks, and a tub of vanilla ice cream. “Midnight pies it is, then. You want some?”
(“You’re the one who’s been watching over my sons,” she’d said, before her Reaper came to usher her along to the more habitable part of Heaven. “Thank you!” she’d called back, just before vanishing through the door.)
“I’ll text her if I don’t see her here already,” promises Sam, clambering out of the booth. That leaves Dean and Castiel alone together, again, and Dean is more aware than ever of how fascinated Castiel seems to be with the eclectic decorations all over the walls.
“He’s a bit of a prankster,” replies Castiel. “Technically he’s more powerful than me, being an Archangel and all, but… he’s young at heart.”
Dean nods. “Right. We’re getting off track. Christmas party is tomorrow. You’re here until New Year’s, so you could just stay in the guest room, and I’ll tell Sam you’re…” he trails off, unsure. What exactly is their cover story? Maybe not a colleague, since people would ask to follow Castiel’s channel and social media, and he certainly wouldn’t have any of that —
“Never say never,” remarks Dean, before tugging Castiel in by his tie for another kiss. He pulls further, unravelling the tie and throwing it aside before moving to the buttons of Castiel’s shirt, undoing them with only a little bit of fumbling. He’s more used to blouses, after all.
“What was that for?” wonders Castiel as he clambers to his feet and helps Dean up. Dean points above him to the branches covered in mistletoe, and claps him on the shoulder.
“Here.” Castiel holds out a hand. When Charlie shakes it, he reaches out with his grace and performs a little miracle. The way her eyes light up makes his own exhaustion worth it.
“Best bar food in the state,” declares Dean, flashing her a thumbs-up. Jo shoots him a set of finger guns on her way to take another table’s order, almost bumping into Sam on the way. Dean raises an eyebrow as his brother reclaims his side of the booth.
Easier said than done. Angel of the Lord he might claim to be, but Castiel’s scruffy discount Nathan Fillion look is, in fact, precision-engineered to tempt Dean off the straight and narrow. If he’d been the first schmuck in the Garden of Eden, all Lucifer would need to do was look like this, and bam, original sin for humanity.
And when he goes downstairs, the only things that suggest the angel had ever been there are the two empty plates in the sink, and the beige trench coat next to his own jacket.
Castiel opens his mouth, as if to shoot off some comment dredging back Dean’s earlier remark about therapists, but then seems to think better of it and closes his mouth. “Let me reiterate, then,” he says instead, as Dean tries to busy his hands with finishing up his coffee and croissant, “rule one: don’t perform miracles. Rule two: don’t divert from the backstory.”
“Okay, okay, Red Pepper has better Crab Rangoon, I’ll give them that,” admits Deputy Hanscum. “But Vancouver’s got a bigger Chinese population, haven’t they? And if there’s a lot of people there with the palate to judge your cooking, you end up making it more authentic. There’s this one shop Doug and I found that serves just the
Castiel reaches out with his grace, and something in the water tugs at John’s fishing line. The man’s eyes widen, and he scrambles to reel out a little fish. After packing the fish in the cooler, John turns to scrutinise Castiel for a moment before casting his line again.
“You’re the one causing drama right now, Dean,” warns John. He seems to take Dean’s angered speechlessness as an invitation to continue, because then he adds, “this night could’ve just been friends and family, you know, people we
“No!” say both Dean and Castiel at the same time. Bobby, Jo, and Charlie all raise their eyebrows at that.
Dean laughs. “Look, the last thing we need is you going viral and half of the planet convinced Jesus is back or something, okay? Nothing freaky in public.” Castiel nods at that, so he continues. “Two, we’re going to come up with some sort of backstory for you. You have to stick to that backstory, okay?”
Castiel pulls up another video. Dean Winchester’s beaming face greets them, followed by a long spiel about how he and his brother were planning to communicate with a crossroads demon named Crowley under a haunted freeway overpass. The video ends with Sam Winchester calling Crowley a coward for not showing up, and Dean Winchester laughing with his brother but keeping one hand on a water pistol full of holy water the entire time. Castiel smiles, in spite of himself.
The afternoon light is dipping into gold by the time Dean and Castiel show up at Uncle Bobby’s. At the Holiday Extravaganza, Castiel had bought presents for his coworkers-slash-family (Dean wasn’t quite sure what the distinctions were), and Dean had started his pre-gaming via the mulled wine and mead stands. So when they ring the doorbell and are greeted with the salt-and-pepper visage of John Winchester, Dean is amiable enough to fold him into a hug.
“How did you find this place?” asks Eileen as Sam lets Castiel into the apartment. Castiel flaps his hands at shoulder height and winks at her. Eileen raises an eyebrow.

Castiel finds John Winchester fishing by the little creek behind Bobby’s place. “I know you’re here,” the other man says, idly reeling in his line as Castiel approaches. “You might as well show yourself. There’s no fish to scare.”
“Oh, you mean that time you, uh, took advantage of my idiotic crush and broke my heart afterwards?” wonders Jo sweetly, turning to smile daggers up at him. “Because, you know, that kinda entitles me to one free kick in your nuts.”
His phone had stopped sending notifications sometime around 3AM last night due to the sheer volume. The video he’d dropped on his channel (
“Wouldn’t dream of it, sir,” replies Dean. He can feel Castiel tensing beside him. “Dad, this is Jimmy. He’s a fan of my channel. Jimmy, this is my father, John.”
Dean shakes his head, but leads Castiel out of Uncle Bobby’s house back to his car. The cold night air wakes him back up, and off in the distance a church bell is ringing.
Thankfully for his sanity, Jo choses that moment to arrive at their table with their drinks and a basket of onion rings, which Dean happily dives into with a mouth-stuffed ‘thanks’. Jo cuffs him lightly about the head with the tray.
“Mom serving him a holiday divorce?” wonders Sam drily. “Just because he had a shit Christmas decades ago doesn’t give him permission to be a grinch every year afterwards. Especially when his
“We’ve got errands to do, and Mrs Singer is expecting us.” Dean shakes his head. “We really shouldn’t.”
“This feels wicked, somehow,” he breathes, as Castiel slams him against the wall and mouths a line of kisses down his neck to his collar. “Like, theoretically I’m sure tempting an angel is wrong, but in practice I can’t see what’s wrong with it.”
“Protesting a bit too much, but okay,” says Sam, rolling his eyes. “Sure, he’s an angel. But he’s also your date to Bobby’s party.”
“All these years, and you never found the time to tell your sons the truth,” remarks Castiel. “Or to break yourself from your old rituals and habits.”
“You said you had a problem last night.” Castiel stuffs his hands into his coat. “I thought maybe I could help.”
shit you’re right i’ll never get his permission for your hand in marriage if i punch his lights out 👊😤💢
“Sometimes you still are,” remarks John, who’d just emerged from the basement with another beer. “Still, I have to thank you. My boys would’ve turned out worse without you.”
“Cas,” he says, that one syllable sounding more like a prayer than anything else Castiel has ever heard.
Castiel stares at her like a deer in headlights. Dean swoops to his rescue. “He’s from very far away,” he says. “Had to fly in and everything.”
“Sometimes the people closest to us are the most willfully blind about our true selves,” replies Charlie, rising to her feet with a yawn. “Good night, Cas. Help yourself to my Netflix, but keep the sound down.”
The ham and roast beef are obtained without incident, but as soon as they’re safely sequestered in the trunk of the Impala, Castiel breaks off to admire some nearby shop windows.
“Yeah, Ash is holding down the fort here tomorrow,” says Jo, shrugging. “What can I get for you boys?”
He supposes that’s fitting, considering that he’s the Angel of Thursdays, but when he’d originally been assigned to watch over this patch of the Earth he hadn’t anticipated such an occurrence. To angels, love had always been one of those abstract, godly concepts: God is love, but all of that love was reserved more for humanity than angelkind.
Dean shrugs. “Why not? Let’s call Charlie, see if she’s down. She did promise to be on our  trivia team last time we played Fibbage.”
Dean Winchester is immediately ashamed of how much he wants to hear Castiel say that again, forever.
“Now that’s just unfair, you son of a bitch,” he declares. Castiel shrugs, skipping away from his next volley. “Come back here, Cas —”
Castiel is still gripping Dean by the arm, calm emanating from his touch. Part of Dean wants to lean in, but as he watches Bobby escort his father out the door to his car, the anger boils back up and he throws Castiel’s hand off him before storming towards the back door.
Dean wakes to a pair of blue eyes inches from his own. Cursing, he immediately bolts up, causing the angel said eyes are attached to to duck away at the last minute.
“I’ve heard worse names,” he says. Sam laughs, before handing their answer sheet to Charlie so she can go turn it in.
“Ah.” Castiel stuffs the packaging into the pocket of his coat as he stuffs the gloves onto his hands. “Thank you, Dean.”
They’d gone over this story all afternoon. Dean watches Castiel’s expression falter, his own heartbeat echoing so loudly in his ears that he fears Jo can hear it. After a moment, Castiel smiles and shrugs. “Luck,” he says.
“You’re making me look bad,” he protests, after almost running into Castiel for the umpteenth time that hour. Hockey skates are a little bit more built for speed than stopping, after all. “Like I said, I haven’t skated in ages.”
“I apologise for his lack of manners, Jimmy,” she says, rolling her eyes. Castiel takes an onion ring and sniffs it. “Try it! It’s Harvelle’s specialty.”
The silence between them is filled only with the Christmas music filtering out of the radio. Castiel leans his head against the window, the golden streetlights bathing his face in a deep golden glow. Each passing shadow of a tree or building seems to linger behind him like wings.
“There’s something so quiet about winter,” remarks Castiel after a moment. “It feels like the world is just holding its breath.”
how did you know about his ex if you’d only met him that day? YTA, at LEAST for getting way too invested in his personal life during a make out sesh.
Castiel blinks rapidly, takes a shuddering breath. “Are… are you doing this because you want to be with me, or because you don’t want to be lonely this Christmas?”
He doesn’t check the notifications, though. What matters more is finding the angel, because of all the changes that he’s being forced to deal with, that much is manageable at least. He has to find the angel, because it’s an heirloom from their mother, because it has presided over all thirty-some-odd Christmases he’s experienced on this godforsaken planet, because —
“Well, I can talk to Mom about giving her the night off to enjoy the party,” says Jo, winking. Charlie playfully shoves her shoulder.
“The offer comes from the university,” replies Castiel. “I just had some enlightening conversations with the right people. Miracles last longer when they come from humans.”
Basically I've thrown out like most of SPN and remade the world to my taste, and my taste is Good Omens-esque Angel bureaucracy. Whoops.
[PHOTOS: Various shots of satisfied holiday shoppers at the Heavenly Honey booth either drinking mead or sampling tiny toasts smudged with honey. One of the photos is of Dean and Castiel examining some beeswax candles. Dean is holding a cup of mead in one hand.]
“Yes. I leave on New Year’s,” says Castiel, his hands idly fiddling with one of the onion rings on his plate.
“That would be breaking rule one,” points out Castiel, nodding towards the crowds of skaters around them. “And then I’d lose my excuse to hold your hand.”
“I can get videos up in heaven,” says Castiel, already starting to get fuzzy around the edges of Dean’s hands. He holds on tighter, hoping it’ll buy him just a millisecond more. “I knew about Team Free Will long before I came here.”
“That’s his loss.” Sam shrugs, and turns around to head upstairs to drop off his bag. Dean follows, hoping to forestall any surprise about Castiel before the angel shows up.
“He was more than welcome to watch it here,” grumbles Bobby. “We’d have made some of those potato pancakes for him if he wanted.”
“You give it time. In the end, you’ll heal, but it won’t be him who heals you, and you’ll have to accept that. For a man who hates being alone as much as he does, he’s really good at driving people away.”
“Yeah, well, I sure know how to choose ‘em.” Jo starts to fiddle with her scarf now, winding the tassels over and over in her fingers. “Morning after notwithstanding, you were one of my better bad decisions.”
“It’s a ritual,” replies John simply, looking out at the wintry landscape. The snow is thawing a little in some parts, and the creek still flows with shards of ice. Castiel finds the gloves Dean had bought him in the pockets of his trousers and puts them on, feeling no discernible difference. “During the week, I work. During the weekends, I fish. Or hunt. Something to keep my hands busy. A task that needs to be finished.”
“I don’t want to give her the wrong idea,” protests Charlie. “You know, with her being my fan and all.”
Castiel is back in an instant, scruff and all. Dean vaguely thinks about the angel that had appeared to the virgin Mary, and wonders if that one had looked at all angelic, or if all angels were supposed to look like discount Nathan Fillion.
“So, Jimmy, you new to Lawrence?” asks Sheriff Mills. Castiel looks up from his plate of onion rings with a look of mild surprise. “I don’t think I’ve seen you around before, is all.”
Mrs Singer comes out to grab the bag from him, effusively showering him with thanks and hugs. He follows her into her kitchen, and it’s like stepping back in time to when he was thirteen, spending weeknights there rolling out pie crust and mixing brownie batter while Sam did their homework.
a thing,” says Charlie, “and I wouldn’t really know better, considering that for a good part of my life, shitty Hallmark movies are all the exposure I had to the holiday.”
“I dunno, given how movies keep portraying them, I’d be nothing short of disappointed if they didn’t show up in blasts of hellfire,” declares Sam. “It’s probably your eyes playing tricks on you, man, or —”
“Isn’t your dad supposed to be there?” wonders Charlie. “Me punching him in the face on behalf of your childhoods might dampen the holiday spirit a little.”
Castiel resists the urge to sink into his seat, busying himself with the basket of onion rings instead. A set of familiar footsteps ring through the bar, drowning out everything else until Dean Winchester is standing by his booth, a carefully-folded beige trenchcoat in his hands.
Dinner passes without incident. Castiel introduces himself as Jimmy. Every time Dean finishes his beer, the bottle seems to refill itself.
“Yeah, just drawing that on a bunch of demons. Pew pew!” Sam mimes the shooting, while Dean pulls out a map of the area.
“If you’re wicked, then so am I,” replies Castiel seriously, his voice muffled against Dean’s flannel shirt, “and
“It’s nothing,” says Castiel. The lie burns at him. He suppresses a wince by taking a sip of the infused water.
“I have until midnight of New Year’s Day,” replies Castiel, crossing his arms and leaning against Dean’s sink as if he’s already making himself at home. “Consider it a Christmas present of sorts.”
“I don’t know who he’s trying to impress,” scoffs John. “Seems like to me he’s just inflicting his ego on the rest of us.”
“Only a matter of time,” agrees Sam, before taking out their answer sheet and handing each of them a golf pencil. “Charlie said she’d be here in ten minutes about a minute ago, so —”
“He hasn’t? Stupid boy. He has every right. I know I wasn’t very involved with him or Sam at all. It was always work, work, work. You gotta make money. Gotta pay the mortgage. Gotta pay the bills. Give the missus some extra for groceries and treats for the boys. She went to Dean’s wrestling matches, Sammy’s violin recitals. They always loved her more than they loved me, and after a while I guess I just took that for granted.”
Dean shakes his head, amused nonetheless. Yet, as he watches the dim pub light and the crooning country music wash over Castiel’s face, he can’t help but feel that telltale spark of warmth light in the pit of his stomach.
We like how Winchesters Play is split between video games and board games. In this board game episode, their friend Charlie Bradbury DMs a one-off campaign for them. It was…
“Yes, rule three.” The angel drops his hands and starts to skate away. Dean curses and speeds up to catch up with him. He miscalculates, of course, and ends up barrelling into Castiel, knocking them both down onto the ice.
Dean suspects it’s more of Castiel breaking rule one on the sly, but he doesn’t comment further. “I haven’t skated in a long time,” he says instead.
“Fascinating,” mutters Castiel, gingerly rubbing the spot where Dean had kissed him. “Shall — shall we return to the party?”
“Cas,” he says, and the angel looks up at him, blue eyes soft in the kitchen light, and — “you’ve got a bit of vanilla right —” he licks his thumb, wiping the offending smudge from the corner of Castiel’s mouth, “
“We’re in this to win this, Cas — Jimmy,” adds Dean, elbowing the angel. “Free drinks for full points on each round.”
“Hm.” Bobby scrutinises Castiel thoughtfully. “Forgive my old man’s memory, but you’re just in town for the holidays, right?”
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” remarks Castiel as Dean unlocks the Impala’s doors. Dean pauses, looking up at the tapestry of stars in the night sky.
“You do know God is omnipresent and omnipotent and thus could take any form that God so chooses?” wonders Castiel.
“You’re just as bad as he is,” she says, shaking her head. Castiel sits down in his booth and drags the basket of rings back.
“Dean, what —” begins Castiel, turning only to get smacked in the face with Dean’s second snowball. The angel splutters for a moment, before quickly summoning a barrage of snowballs in retaliation.
Dean’s not sure if it’s just the inevitable, or the alcohol, or the disdain obvious in the way his father said ‘fan’, but one minute he’s standing beside Castiel and the next he’s all but lunging for his father, beer spilling out of their bottles as he slams him against the wall.
Sam’s serious about Eileen huh? That’s so sweet; I’m glad to hear he’s been able to move on from Jess.
“Yeah, that’d be everything dead or dormant under the snow,” says Dean. “In the summer you can’t hear yourself think over the frogs and the crickets.”
Castiel thinks about his own plans, about his own half-baked excuse to come down to Earth and insert himself in the life of his favourite YouTuber. “And how did you move on?”
They power through several more questions. Castiel makes a couple cryptic remarks about how some of the films are surprisingly true-to-life. Dean doesn’t know what to make of it, so he focuses instead on the happy buzz of alcohol and the heady smell of smoke.
you volunteered me for Bobby’s party tomorrow.” Dean rolls his eyes, shoves his hands into his jeans. “Dad’s gonna think we’re trying to poison him.”
“Well, it’s worked out for me so far.” Dean extends his arms, shrugging. “Wouldn’t have found Charlie without my channel, for one.”
Castiel doesn’t need telling twice. Silently, swiftly, the angel re-buttons his shirt and picks up his tie. At the threshold, he turns back to look at Dean, his eyes a little bit shinier than usual.
“You really believe this guy’s an angel?” wonders Sam. “Did you order him off Angels ‘R Us or something?”
“Yes,” agrees Castiel, in a tone that suggests he actually has no idea what Bobby is talking about. “I, too, found that… very convenient.”
“Look, if this is about your lord and saviour Jesus Christ or whoever,” he begins as he opens the door, but the rest of his canned tirade fizzles out on his tongue as he takes in the scruffy, very-much-not-Jehovah’s Witness-looking man on his doorstep. “Ship’s long sailed,” he finishes, eyes narrowing. “Who are you?”
For a moment, Dean looks as if he’s going to argue with Jo about it. Then he deflates, takes the coat, and stomps back out the door. Castiel finally exhales, startling Jo when she turns around to see him again.
“Forget that, you can wait on my couch,” declares Charlie. “Until you figure out your shit with Dean, you can stay here instead. I promise I won’t inflict too much of my taste in movies on you.”
One of those surprisingly sweet YBD episodes. Dean and Sam declutter each other’s rooms as a test to see who knows the most about the other. Spoiler alert: it’s a tie.
“Cas?” he demands, as his wonderful, scruffy Angel of the Lord squints into the beam of his flashlight and then straight at Adam’s camera.
“Dean, I do not understand this ‘carry-oakey’,” Castiel’s voice begs. Dean turns back to see the angel looking mildly distressed, an empty plate still clutched in his hands. “How do people know what to sing if it’s just the words on the screen?”
“Yeah, that’s… how internet friends work. You find them, you invite them to your hometown, they show up.”
“You… and Dean,” he begins, hesitatingly. Jo raises an eyebrow, but doesn’t seem to want to shut down the conversation, so he takes that as encouragement to continue. “Why him?”
I’m really gonna miss the frequent updates! TFW has helped me out of some really bad places and I’ve gotten used to my subscriptions every morning to see if they’ve posted something new. But it’s good to see Sam’s career taking priority.
The only consolation he has after that is that everyone else at the party was too busy kissing and hugging to notice anything else at all.
Dean blinks. Perhaps it’s a trick of the light, but Castiel’s cheeks are oddly flushed. And his own voice is a bit too hoarse when he points out, “rule three, Cas,” with some degree of regret.
“Dean did mention you abruptly left after the party,” says Sam. “Is — are you okay? Did something happen between you two?”
“Holy shit,” says Jo, looking at Castiel with something between awe and respect. “Dean’s a fucking moron for letting you leave.”
Castiel immediately wishes he’d been there to help, but he knows it’s for the best that he didn’t. As long as John took their creekside conversation seriously, and the move-out didn’t make the evening news for having a shockingly high body count or something, everything will be fine.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “You’re the only one here capable of it,” he points out. The memory of Castiel’s fingers are fuzzy like the half-dream it had been, but he still remembers the softness, the gentleness. The warmth inside him flares right up to his cheeks. “I know it breaks rule one, but — it’s
“You know him,” says Charlie, popping open a bottle of beer and settling in next to Jo on the sofa in the living room. The Mom Squad have drifted into the dining room for a game of poker, but when Dean pokes his head in he can see Ellen passed out with her head in Deputy Hanscum’s lap.
“Do you know how long I’ve been alive, Dean? Millennia, easily. I watched the first fish crawl out of the primordial soup onto land. I’ve seen empires rise and fall and turn to dust. I’ve seen stars go supernova, and galaxies collapse. And
“I’d say about the exact opposite, yeah.” Jo nods back towards the house. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, your dad’s not winning any Dad of the Year awards, ever. But just because he turned you into a ticking time bomb of bad emotions doesn’t mean you’re allowed to explode all over everyone else.”
, he reminds himself furiously, clambering back onto his feet and extending a hand to Castiel. The angel takes it, and they glide together in relative silence for a couple minutes more.
“And yet this town’s weather forecast had not predicted snow for today,” Dean remarks, nodding towards the window where additional snow flurries are dropping. “Seems
“So, not as Twitch streamer MoonQueen and her adoring fan,” supplies Jo helpfully, “but as Charlie and Stevie, fellow human beings.”
“He made my dreams come true for one night and one night only,” agrees Jo. “And it took me several years to realise the story in my head wasn’t always the same as the one being written in real life.”
“Yeah, no wonder we failed the Nativity questions last night,” scoffs Dean. “Come on. You gonna get him a present or what?”
As the clock inches closer to midnight, Dean’s heartbeat gets more and more erratic. Ten minutes until Castiel goes to Heaven.
“I can make things easier,” says Castiel, and snaps his fingers. The decorations in Ash’s box immediately fly out and position themselves all around. A couple additional garlands of gold tinsel appear out of nowhere to festoon the top shelf behind the bar.
“Why?” wonders Dean. “I’m just… I’m just me. Fucked up kid turned into a fucked up adult, who doesn’t believe he deserves anything that lasts. Why me?”
“Apologies,” says Castiel, folding his hands behind his back. Dean rolls over to check his phone and groans louder, glowering up at the angel.
“Anytime,” says Castiel, offering her a thumbs up. Dean yawns, in spite of himself, and the angel is back at his side almost immediately, taking his arm. “Dean, perhaps it’s time we went back to your place.”
“There’s many things I’ve never had the opportunity to tell my boys,” says John after another moment of silence. “And many things I deliberately withheld. At the time I thought I was doing the right thing, hiding the truth, letting them hold onto certain… certain beliefs.”
There’s a ghost of Dean in the cut of John’s jaw, in the stoniness of his silence. “Yes, sir,” he says, stiff salute and all.
“I came to check on you,” replies Castiel. “And to invite you to the New Year’s Eve party at Harvelle’s Bar tomorrow.”
“Wow.” Sam looks at Eileen, who shakes a splayed hand in agreement. “Thanks, Cas. I — how can we possibly repay you?”
Ordinarily, such an observation might not have particularly bothered Dean Winchester, since he’d have assumed that his brother Sam had hidden it for their annual angel hunt. But this isn’t ordinary.
“So, here’s the game plan,” says Dean moments later, nursing a mug of coffee and a croissant from the big pack that Sam had picked up from Costco the other day. “The Christmas party is tomorrow, and I’ve been drafted to help Mrs Singer cook.”
