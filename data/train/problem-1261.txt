And John wasn't allowing it!
Mycroft sticks his meddling fingers back deep into the entire unfolding mess, and four days after his admittance, Sherlock is very carefully bundled into a nest of blankets, sedated heavier and strapped to a gurney, and transferred to a new hospital.
" Sherlock hissed. "Not
"That'll be five quid." The barista hesitates, green, styrofoam cup in hand and her nervous little finger tapping against it. She's fifteen minutes away from a smoke break. "Are you sure I can't get you a water, too, sir? You sound a bit peaky."
"I shouted at him to get a girlfriend," he finished, scratching his jeans into his fist. "Then we went out and got cake and I went home, and I haven't seen him since."
"Sherlock was fifteen when he enrolled in Cambridge. He was more than academically capable, but emotionally, he was not ready to be on his own." Mycroft paused, observing him flatly over the rim of his cup. "Sherlock spent all of primary school antagonising his instructors by being more intelligent than they could ever dream to be, and by being unable to be anything but disruptive with that fact. He had never had a friend, our parents, well-meaning though they were, did not understand either of us, and he wanted nothing to do with me even back then. I think he hated me, for not being like him. When he went to interview at Cambridge, and met Dr. Wilson, he was desperate for acknowledgement. But... I believe he was even more desperate for a friend."
He is also, currently: a volunteer dog-walker.
Sherlock remained dead to the world the entire time.
He grinds his teeth until he can feel it in his skull.
He moved silently to his own chair, and swept up his tea without so much as a single look at John.
But fucking hell, he
"Sherlock," John says quietly. "Look at me, please."
He practises speaking.
He plays violin to himself in the mornings, because that's another thing he can do, now. He can play violin.
"I'm not saying this as an excuse, by the way. I haven't lived at home in almost twenty years; at some point you have to stop blaming your mistakes on your parents. I'm also not saying this to make you feel obligated to tell me things in return. I'll listen to whatever you have to say but I don't want you to feel like you
This time, Sherlock's blood literally had been spilled over his hands.
Sherlock would be in pain when balled upon the sofa, made no comment either.
He's not. He's not doing well at all. He's hyperventilating on the floor of a morgue after triggering
Two minutes.
His plans just often wind up awry, and- what's he supposed to do? It's only
he would ask.
"That's. All right, Sherlock. You were--"
He turns around on the spot, Lestrade's badge tossed to skid south on the patch of ice. Then, on a throbbing ankle and with his pride bruised much, much worse than his face, he limps down the street, straight away from where Graham is still blathering about calling an interpreter.
and he can't stand it. "An ultimatum? You'll move back out if I don't
a go. Because we haven't until now, and it's really not worked out very well at all."
Yes. Obviously.
Jesus
Sherlock shakes his head against his knee, his eyes shut tight.
Sherlock had agreed to see this man again because he'd thought it would make John happy. That was it. Because it had never once even entered the genius' mind that John loving him back could be possible.
At last, the final straw.
"It's- ah." Sherlock gulped, forcing out twisted, dreadful approximation of a smile. It probably came out looking like he'd swallowed a lemon. "I require a leaf for one of my experiments."
"Hi," John says, turning towards the kitchen. He's already decided to subsist himself off of toast and tea, this morning. "You want anything?"
But that wasn't what Sherlock needed from him.
And Mycroft's pointed comments about the matter are not
And--
"No, no. Of course not," she murmured, hardly paying him any mind. "But Sherlock is a very... unique person, isn't he? Unique name, unique face. And that personality-- well. Let's just say he got a lot of attention, even back then. But that's enough of that, isn't it?" She smiled back at him, just as strained and professional as John. "What was it you wanted to ask me?"
This... this had
Just the one!
Sherlock finally unmelted from his block of ice, the tight grip of his fist starting to loosen. "You had another flatmate that walked around in a sheet?"
"For the news... the reporter. So his wife'd see. Not. Gah...
Sherlock groaned, and dropped his head back into his hands.
of attention. It meant a spotlight being put on him but he didn't know what he was supposed to perform.
"That... uh. Really doesn't sound health-"
How the hell did you do that? And why? And how do we get it back?
"Good," he says, matter of fact, and kisses him again anyway, for good measure.
Understanding swooped over him with a feeling a bit similar to a brick to the head.
Yes. It was probably just the heroin.
Sherlock has scratched and disfigured those particular scars many, many months ago, rendering the messages illegible with his own nails and cigarettes almost immediately upon escaping from hospital. He is no stranger to pain, and the minor burn of his own cigarettes had barely even registered at all.
But he can carry these boxes out, one by one, and rebuild the wing he and they have so willfully destroyed. He can properly refile them, in insulated, locked rooms. He can bury them,
Sherlock doesn't leave, and John doesn't need to wait.
His mouth moves a lot. His lips forming words, throat jumping as he breathes in, spelling out a silent monologue to whoever is there to listen. And when John had first seen that, months ago--
Yes. He does. Obviously.
Sherlock. It wasn't! How could... how could you ever think that?!""
Sherlock swallows harshly, wrenching that train off the tracks. He will not lose John. He's here, isn't he? He's sitting in a bloody therapist's office, not-talking about his
John is staring at him from his chair, gone pale and tight-fisted again, his each breath jerking in and out of his chest like it's forced. "You said-" He blinks, stricken. "You said it was for a case!"
He takes a deep breath. Then he does.
The seconds pass in that same suffocating, horrible silence. Sherlock can't stop gasping again, and he can't look at John either, and this on top of never bloody eating or sleeping-- he might well be on his way towards proving Mycroft right, and passing out right there on the floor. Not on John's watch. "Sherlock," he entreats again. He buries his face to his chest, listening to the frantic racing of his heart. "I know I'm probably the last person you want to listen to right now, but love, you're going to faint. Just-- take a breath, Sherlock, with me, just one, there you go. There you go. And another. That's it. Just like that. Brilliant, Sherlock."
He kisses John in front of red Buckingham Palace guards.
They wouldn't fucking
He kisses John surrounded by serviettes and teaching him how to waltz.
go back upstairs."
"However, I think I can agree with you on one point, John. And that is that you should not have struck Sherlock. He did not deserve it, and you should not have done it. That was not merely unacceptable, that was abusive behavior that likely rises to the level of a crime." She paused, watching him still and entirely unreadable. "Have you spoken to Sherlock about what happened? I can see that you feel genuine regret. Have you apologised to him?"
Because he doesn't condone this. He will never condone this.
Not just a relationship; he'd once had something with this man, specifically. This well-respected college professor, back when Sherlock had been a grad student.
John groans.
I want it more than anything. I love you. But if we're going to do this-- and we don't have to! Forget all that fucking
There was still definitely something to be worried about here, something that he was missing, but... it wasn't that. No. There had to be another piece he was missing.
to him, then why does he care, if Francis knows it? What reason does he have not to write it down?
The first punch is lovely, and Sherlock just about preens with delight. The second punch is twice as lovely as the first. He truly loves how

person would likely be able to give him exactly what he wants.
Across from him, Mycroft nods again, looking pale and lost in thought. He finishes doing up the buttons for his jacket, not quite meeting John's eyes. "I will take that into consideration."
"Oh. Happy experimenting, then." John brushed by his shoulder and gave the plant a mock, affectionate nudge. "Sorry, Milgram. Hopefully you'll survive the amputation procedure."

And it takes a little while, for him to stop freezing. But he
And this was going to work.
"Do I make a habit of lying, Giles?"
"Um," John said. "All right." He set two plates down, wiping his hands off with a flannel. "That doesn't surprise me, to tell you the truth. But. Thank you for confirming it?"
A short moment passed in silence. He did not go on. No elaboration, no explanation. Just that short, cryptic
A date. Sherlock was perfectly within his rights to go on a date with whomever he liked. In fact, it was a
Maybe Sherlock hears him, maybe he doesn't. Maybe Sherlock's in there because he needs to recall some tiny, insignificant factoid about Picasso, maybe he's in there because there's no longer anywhere else that he can feel safe. He has no idea, and Sherlock is neither willing or able to explain it to him.
The twitching and tapping stopped, at least. So did everything else. He sat there in the chair that John had pulled out for him, and he stared at John like he'd just been offered a glass full of rat poison. He made no move to take the glass, and in fact looked like had no plans to, either. For one horrible,
It's probably a bit mean-spirited. But John is more than a little bit past caring, at this point.
"Will you open your eyes and just
He gently nudges Sherlock to turn around, and Sherlock lets him, fumbling on shaking legs and his face still turned desperately away. But he lets John move him, and when his legs give out, John goes down with him.
They both were.
Well. He spends an hour every week sulking in a therapist's office.
He went for his own phone next, because if they were going out on a case, then they might be back an hour or two later than expected. He needed to tell Molly. Or-- no, he needed to make sure Molly was okay with it, and... and if not, he'd head home early himself, and ask Greg to keep an eye on Sherlock. He'd promised to do better by Rosie, too, and that couldn't just be about not drinking himself stupid and sick at night. That meant cases, too, didn't it? That meant not dropping her at the most convenient babysitter to go have fun with Sherlock. He had to take care of Rosie. He couldn't keep just pushing her off onto somebody else whenever he wanted a bit of excitement.
It's quite obvious you're smitten :)
Perhaps if he hid himself in the corner and made himself down as small as possible and pretended to not exist...
It takes John a few moments, his hands slowly repeating the last sign on his own. "Work... a case? He had a case for you?"
"...What?"
John nodded once, forcing himself not to look away. Okay. He could pour out every bloody drink in the flat. If Sherlock could stay clean for him, then he could do this for him.
"Home, then?" Lestrade asks, tilting his head back towards the entrance. "I can you two lads a lift back to Baker Street. It's on my way back to the Yard, anyway."
John's whiskey had not helped.
His phone went off, and that was it. The moment ended.
He's tired, too.
(See the end of the chapter for
because that's not actually what you said."
Sherlock swallowed again, his throat suddenly bone dry, and sat numbly back down on the couch.
"I think you give it a go. With--"
apologetic that she had been caught up so violently in the case, though he wasn't quite sure how to say it- but she was quite all right, in the end. Also certainly never wanting to go on a date with John again, but quite all right.
John swallowed a hard mouthful of whiskey, clutching the glass tightly to his stomach, and stared at the waiting black screen of his phone.
I promise, the "all this conflict would be resolved with a single straight conversation" won't drag out for too long! John will get there soon. He just needs one or two more nudges to go!
He doesn't make John watch. He doesn't destroy John inside and out, he doesn't give him a funeral with an empty casket, he doesn't give him a body broken on the sidewalk and it's all his fault. This time he falls and he says goodbye and he hugs John before he leaves and John hugs him back and it's all okay. It's okay. It is.
And besides. He is Sherlock Holmes. He sees
He can not miss the iron hand that tightens around his arm, and swivels John back to face him more securely than any words could.
Sherlock nodded back, saying nothing. The tight grip of his fingers into his jumper was words enough.
"Yes! Of course!" He stepped even closer, so close that the hard edge of the table dug into Sherlock's back, and one hand patted his hair, like he was a fragile, precious thing. "Surely you know that, Sherlock. I think you're the most special student I've ever had."
character. To which John seemed relatively indifferent towards, but Sherlock could not have been more grateful. The press had called him everything, at one time or another-- from a freak to a genius to a murderer. He was nearly forty years old. He could live with a few photoshopped headlines of him snogging another man.
Nothing else fits. Sherlock simply can not talk.
I hope he is, will be the main act."
Because what the hell, but Ella had been right again. She had been
He set the paper back down on his lap, picking through his words very, very carefully. "Not the prize, I suppose," he said, and it wasn't until then, looking at Sherlock, that he realised how accurate it really was. Sherlock was
John made an awkward, small sounding cough. It was unmistakably the noise of someone that was trying very hard not to laugh.
"Sherlock?"
The day came to a close with Sherlock set up in an empty conference room at Scotland Yard, joined by Lestrade and surrounded by a sea of diagrams and maps and list, pouring over it all for that one detail that would just make it
in any way whatsoever.
John doesn't know what the fuck is going on here, but he's going to sock Mycroft in the face.
But Sherlock shakes his head again and now he even manages to look impatient.
Lestrade grins faintly, nodding once. He looks exasperated but still fond, the absolute disaster of a detective still causing him no end of trouble but he's still willing to deal with it, if it's what it takes to help Sherlock right now. When he so clearly needs it so much, while at the same time despising every attempt any makes to try and make things easier for him. Any other DI probably would've tossed a mute Sherlock off their crime scene ten minutes ago, and John is grateful that Lestrade hasn't.
This entire Plan had been a dreadful idea straight from the start.
It's going to be fine, it's
He snaps his mouth shut, and just shakes his head instead.
Enough beating around the bloody bush.
This whole time.
He will not lose John.
"Every chapter," Sherlock repeated, still just a little numb. "You're... writing a
And his proof is right there, in the offer to sit here and play
Whatever horrible things they did to him, whatever frustrations he has with John, whatever feelings he's had-- because Sherlock
Sherlock looked down at him, very pale and his face still unreadable. He said nothing at all, instead stepping away after a few more moments of silence, crossing the room to linger by his own chair.
"What I mean is," he finally said, "you stressed earlier how important you thought it was that we not keep secrets. That we be honest with each other. And I want you to... know what exactly you are getting into, before you commit. Because I. You. I would much prefer it, if. If you thought that I could change, there is actually a limit to how much I am capable of it, and I suspect that limit is rather low, and... if you decided this was insurmountable, then... then I would prefer you know it now, and not--"
What?
and then suddenly it was as if a piece in him had crumbled. "I want
There were no cases. Lestrade had threatened to block his number if he kept asking; Sherlock threatened to get a new one. The point was, there were no cases at Scotland Yard, and the ones that the masses were filling his inbox with were so mind-numbingly dull he wanted to kill himself.
But John does hesitate, just on his way out the door.
The pen Sherlock had hurled in his fit of rage and fear is still on the floor. Lonely, discarded, and sad.
John, I don't- how much misery have you endured on my account?"
stop running off to try and get yourself killed?! Don't you ever get tired of it, Sherlock?! No, of course you don't, you
that is
it's enough.
He grins back instead, forcing the insecurity in his chest down, and kisses John's hand back.
The bundle of blankets next to him suddenly and violently shifts. Sherlock wrenches away, the look on his face transformed from placid to livid. His eyes are wide and ablaze, burned alive with the sudden fury of it, and he yanks himself away from the brush of John's shoulder to pick up the pen.
Well, perhaps that was the answer.
"Then at the nearest safest opportunity," Sherlock snapped. He'd turned almost feral, growling like a wild and angry street dog, every last trace of humour gone. "I'll take a cab home."
"Sherlock," he called again, a little more demanding this time. He touched his arm, tugging on a fistful of Belstaff. "You okay?"
"Hang on a second. I'm almost-"
"You were married. The biggest and most important day of your life, you said. That life was... supposed to be what you wanted."
But there are no perfect words, and the harder he tries to say them, the more he understands he's setting himself up for certain failure. He wants a perfect ending, one of the transparently 'witty' sign-offs to one of John's long case write-ups, but there is no perfect ending because this is not a blog post. The borings bits have not been edited out, and Sherlock's words or lack thereof will not be proofread, pruned, and purified to be at their best. It is raw, real, and so
What did you
One of Sherlock's shaking hands lunges to clutch over his. It's ice cold and clammy but it hangs on for dear life. He can't say anything, and John can't make him. This will have to be enough.
He wouldn't have been able to forgive himself for John being treated the same way.
It was something that he'd had to say. He remained firm on that. No matter how much Sherlock didn't want to hear it, and no matter how unhappy he was now.
A big part of him now wanted to tell Sherlock to call the date off. A little bit of nerves was okay, but here Sherlock was a full two hours early, dressed to the nines, unable to sit still, and so anxious he thought he was going to throw up.
he begs silently.
"And you just let this carry on, then. You knew your little brother was being sexually abused and manipulated and you just let it happen," John snapped. "Because-- what? You didn't want to sully your reputation? You--"
I'll take a look downstairs. But if I don't find anything I'm dropping your theory and going with mine, okay?"
"...Ah." The researcher paused, looking back up at him. She was quiet for a moment, just watching him, perfectly polite, the very picture of professionalism. "Well, I'm afraid I don't know him very well. But I'd never speak ill of a colleague, Doctor."
Had Sherlock ever said no to anyone or anything that actually mattered?
really what he'd meant?
Something about this... wasn't right.
, your responsibility, Sherlock-" he stopped, staring across the room in ever increasing bemusement. "When did you even get this?
He wishes Jim Moriarty and Mary Not-Morstan had never existed at all.
John wanted nothing more than to tell him to just call this entire date off, try again another day, and then, pull the bloody idiot into a hug.
"Oh, so I see you learned the sign for
" Sherlock spun once with spread apart arms, dressing gown swirling almost like a ballet dancer, and in that moment he honestly did look fine. Wonderful, even.
"And brush your teeth!" John shouts back, already out the door, and is then jogging down to the street without another look back.
He keeps going because he knows if Sherlock
John keeps it up, his fingers stroking along Sherlock's, holding them still every time he tries to sign something. The pressure still presses in all around him like a thick blanket but when he breathes next it's easier, because John is
He doesn't remember. He was a little busy at the time, having his heart restarted. He doesn't want to remember.
then he will not be responsible for what happens next.
Then he actually sits down and
. This wasn't normal. Nothing about this and how he'd felt was normal, why hadn't he realised that? Why hadn't he listened to what Sherlock was trying to say?
"No," Sherlock said again. He inhaled, long and slow, vibrant eyes just barely opened to slits. He stared at the floor through his lashes as if it held the answer to all of life's mysteries, his legs long and stretched, his thin hands interlaced together over his stomach. "The offer is much appreciated, John, but I actually think I'm going to go have a lie down. Catch up on some sleep, like you're always telling me to do. Good luck on the interviews."
The only break in the silence is the sound of chewing and chopsticks. John scrapes at the styrofoam, picking at rice with a single-minded intensity and staring at it like it's the most interesting thing in the world. He doesn't look at Sherlock, now, and Sherlock may not understand much, but after years of living with John (and living without him), he does know it's best to let him be.
that he knows how to do.
Besides, this was what people did, wasn't it? He'd never had so much as a friend, before, never mind a relationship, but he'd observed it in others, and this was something people did. This was something that made people happy. It wasn't Oscar's fault that he couldn't be normal about it, but Sherlock was a good student, wasn't he? He could learn. Oscar said he was brilliant and special and that he loved him-- the least Sherlock could do was try to properly reciprocate.
And then, a moment later:
He could tell John meant it, though, and in any case, he was right about Rosie. Of course. John of a few years ago would've blown it off, because Rosie was too young to remember, what was the harm of one night with a sitter-- but that was John of a few years ago, and this was John now, and they weren't the same. Sherlock didn't want them to be the same.
Before his eyes, John stood in the kitchen, filling a glass of water. He rolled his sore shoulders and shifted his weight, clearly worn out enough to just lie straight back down and not get back up for the next week. He tilted it back for a mouthful, his back to Sherlock and tense enough to make a chiropractor cry.
always disregard your own safety. You go out and get yourself nearly killed whenever you get the opportunity, always
"And I'd feel a lot better if you agreed to... if you at least tried to keep talking to me about it. Or Ella, or another--"
John again thinks about Sherlock's chart that he has spent so
with his violin. Nobody understands the words, but it's still speech. It's still words that he wants to say aloud and can't.
Sherlock drops his head back against the filthy wall, and sits there in the rubbish and the cold, and sucks in the deepest breath that he can.
"Turned my phone back on to some texts, then," he said. "Seventy-three. And counting."
At Sherlock!
Sherlock stowed his phone back into his dressing gown in a surge of almost-panic, the switch in his head flipped rom purpose-driven to post-success-afterglow, and immediately reverted to feigning sleep. Which probably wasn't the smartest move, considered he had been texting John approximately five seconds prior, but- people were idiots. Anything was worth a shot.
"I don't want to hear it. Get up. Get up,
In 2010, John asks Sherlock if he has a boyfriend. Sherlock tells him no.
Sherlock forced a smile, inch by inch. This one felt like pulling teeth. God, how
He wasn't worth it.
Sherlock leaned down, and in very full view of the entire restaurant, but very especially the two reporters from the Sun, kissed him.
This isn't normal. This isn't typical behavior, for a flashback. This isn't just a panic attack. Sherlock is completely unresponsive, and has been so now for several minutes.
make sense, and piece by puzzle piece, only made John even more apprehensive than before.
"End of discussion, Sherlock."
didn't like that?
He is so tired of this. He is so tired of being made to spell out what he wants, each and every sentence reduced into something as slow as dripping and congealed syrup, his mind already skipped ten sentences ahead while he fumbles on translating just one like a child. He is so tired of the painstaking effort it all takes only to look up and realise there's nobody in the room that can understand what he's so worked so hard to say. He is so tired of having all of this madness building and locked inside his head and no matter how desperately he wants to let it out, there is no door. It pounds against the walls like a storm of bats and scratches and howls and he wants to
And it is in this dreadful, pathetic state, that Mycroft finds him.
John wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but he also didn't think he'd get an answer if he pressed. He rubbed Sherlock's shoulders again, very gently.
But it was only a matter of time until John realised Sherlock is not those things anymore.
He'd done it all for John.
) Sometimes he did need to be nagged into it just to get off the sofa, but he really did think this would be good for him. Something to keep his brain occupied, and prove to the tabloids that the game was back on, to get the private clients trickling in again. Hell, something to be between him and John that wasn't Mary and the morgue and Sherlock's relapse.
"I hope you know what you're doing, little brother."
is tired,
he's thought, it will be dramaticism and glory only worthy of Sherlock Holmes.
There's a loud thump from upstairs. John can only imagine whatever the hell Sherlock's doing up there. Not something that someone who is still meant to be
"Yeah. Something like that."
Sherlock?"
to me, I thought then--" Sherlock shook his head back and forth over his knees, his voice stumbling, and John's heart nearly cracked. "He got angry at me plenty of times. But he never made any advances, no matter how opportunities I gave him. Once I pretended to pass out into his bed while wearing a disgusting amount of leather, and he just dropped me in the shower. He listened when I said no. Even about silly things. He listened."
This really would go so much easier if he could yell for help.

did he care about what Mycroft thought, because Mycroft would probably look down his nose at this, but Mycroft was annoying and a spy, Mycroft was--
John can at least give him that.
He ran a vigorous hand over his face, trying to bat away the sleep and jealousy and everything else that he already knew was a waste of time, because Sherlock would deduce it on him at a first glance.
"I'm not going to go away. Come on, Sherlock. You can do this! You know you can..."
Mycroft set the book in his hands down on the shelf with a loud
But Sherlock was already gone. Just like that-- stalked back off down the hallway to start stabbing the button for the lift again. And that was that. They'd barely been at Cambridge for ten minutes, after the bloody hour it had taken to get out here, and that was the end of the case.
, but he abandoned me for it." No, no,
"I am never leaving again."
"You don't know, do you."
"My best friend relapsed on a drug addiction, for the third time since I've known him. I'm pretty sure at least the first was my fault. But there's no question about this one. He relapsed so badly it almost killed him, and he did it for me. He did it because he knew I wouldn't listen to him any other way.
You asked for more protective!John, and I listened! Well, this chapter actually didn't have much room for editing beyond what was already there to begin with. But future chapters hopefully will let me do even more! Meanwhile I guess I'm not as no longer sick as I thought, endometriosis is a fucking bitch and a half, so I'll just be over here on the floor with more crackers if you need me. Yay for sad Sherlock giving me something to occupy myself <3
"You understand the condition he was in," Mycroft says finally. "I didn't see the sense in bringing you here merely to see you pace holes into the waiting room floor for the next ten hours, John."
Sherlock is jealous of it, somedays. How much easier his life would've been, if he could just switch so many overactive sects of his brain
What positive stride is there left for him to take besides this final step?
He's still bleeding at the bottom of the stairs, and is shaking too badly to climb up them to get out.
He opens his mouth, searching for the best words that won't set Sherlock off, while at the same time sending Mycroft away. But it's a tall order, and in the second it takes him to get ready to start, Sherlock has already sat up, and reached for the folders himself.
any more! From the outside, he and John look exactly what two ordinary people engaged in a sexual and romantic relationship ought to look. He has tried as hard as he can to give him as much
but there's nothing at all that's appropriate to say.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow. "You ought to be learning American, Sherlock. It's much more pragmatic."
Nothing comes out, when he tries to say it.
It is plain and normal. It is ugly, and the roughest of a rough start that he can possibly imagine.
"Well, someone's eager again," John murmured, trying to share a grin with Greg. It wasn't all that easy to smile. He jogged to follow after Sherlock's long stride, barely catching up just in time to trail him into the building. "Guess you decided it was worth your time after all?"
John doesn't bother trying to draw him out. Instead, he simply searches through the fridge, throwing together a dinner as quick as what he has the energy for, and he doesn't bother trying to be quiet, either; Sherlock can't hear him. The only time he needs to careful is when he gently makes an approach to where Sherlock still sits in his tight ball, a bowl of biscuits cradled under his right arm.
and shook his hand back. "That's right." Smile,
Every last bit of John's hopes disintegrate to ash.
The case ended up being not quite as good as Lestrade's text had promised- it hadn't ended up being a locked room after all- but it still promised to be a decent enough puzzle. It was the theft of a counterfeit painting, after all. Why steal a counterfeit painting? Why go to such lengths for a painting that one could not sell?
The memory hits him all at once and he moans, sagging right there in the middle of the corridor. It's still in his exam room, at the surgery. He'd taken it out of his pocket to text Sherlock, to remind him to get on Skype, and he'd left it there. It's still there, with his laptop and all of his things. Shit.
"Oh, Sherlock? He was terribly inconsistent back then; I hope it's easier for you to work with him now. He skipped out on meetings and labwork all the time. Well, he said he was sick, but really. Who's sick that often, at that age--?"
The seconds roll by. A cold sweat breaks out on the back of his neck and his tongue feels swollen to twice its size.
Mind palace John can never compare.
actually means, Sherlock."
Then, he looms silently to his feet, and stalks out of their room with a flourish of silk dressing gown.
Because John is handing him an iPad.
Sherlock hummed again. "It was always a very situational partnership. I left school and started working with Lestrade, and he wound up getting a Nobel Prize. Our paths didn't exactly cross often at that point, and we grew apart."
"I'm a detective, Molly, not a psychic. Which don't exist, by the way." He breathes in through his nose, the sharp scent of antiseptic and alcohol and blood and medicine. "Everybody likes cake."

like words, never mind intelligible ones. But John turns his grin on him, and he laughs, looking light as air, lighter than this morning, lighter than the bloody wedding. "Yes, mu shu pork. For me. You don't want something that heavy, right now."
"That's right," John said evenly back. "It's been how many years, since he was a student here? Fifteen years? And yet when you heard we'd be on campus today, your first instinct was still to run off up here to try and mock him."
John, I don't want to
He might not be vocal about it, but oh, he is still
One of Sherlock's only friends had died, taking a bullet that was meant for him. Said friend had then left him a bloody message from beyond the grave, telling him he'd best kill himself to fix it, or die trying. And meanwhile, his best friend had excised him entirely out of his life, taking his goddaughter with him, and left him with nothing more than a letter spelling out in very explicit detail that all of it was his fault, and said best friend wished he'd stayed dead.
Greg, obviously; what is it?"
"No," Francis agrees, "you don't. That doesn't mean you can't share some of the same struggles. And my point is that it's still progress, Scott. Something that looks like nothing to you is still incredible to someone else." He pauses for a moment, giving him a pointed look over his glasses. "Something tells me John would think so, if you'd tell him."
And for weeks, weeks and weeks and weeks, it was.
He'd never have believed it until he'd seen it, just how good of a godfather Sherlock was. How
"I know that you have been struggling to find research collaborations for years, in no small part because you are a second-rate scientist that attaches yourself to the hard work of others, and that reputation has finally spread.

than he is protecting him from any future threat. He'd already protected John in 2012, and this was how it all ended up. He doesn't have it in him to do that again.
He just knew he had to open the door. Because if he didn't, and they started this with secrets and trauma still kept silent between them, then it was putting that many more obstacles in their path to making this work.
He signs his name. Just that.
"No," he said shortly. He clenched his fingers together in his lap, forcing himself to breathe deeply again. "If she wants to actually apologise, then maybe. But I have a daughter now. I can't have someone like that in her life."
Sherlock plucks up an English muffin from Mrs. Hudson's last visit and offers it across the room.
It wasn't just having Sherlock be so excited and alive for the first time in weeks, though the brightness in his eyes was certainly good to see. It had been weeks since the Culverton Smith case, and months since anything before it. It had been
John's clenched jaw twitched, annoyance of his own breaking through at last that damnable patience. He worked his fingers into his chair, three days of silence and tension taking their toll.
There's just one thing, that stops him.
John doesn't hear him, of course. John is not telepathic. Though it would be incredibly convenient if he were.
"But you have... elected to not do that. Which is not something that I predicted. But you have. Meaning my need for Milgram has expired, and my interest in the results of the experiment have waned. I- that is. ...Thank you, John."
and he's not
loud groan. He creaked to his feet audibly enough that John could hear him all the way from the sitting room, and he looked up from his laptop just in time to see Sherlock stagger, step by step, into the space of his door. He was draped still in a blanket and an untucked blue shirt, and looked like he wanted to fall flat on his face.
"Milgram."
But he can't make it come out. He tries, and it doesn't happen, and all he can do is gesture furiously between the two of them again, then to his own throat. It. Doesn't.
John closed his eyes, swishing the last remnants of his glass, and forced himself to stay calm.

He'd checked three emails, and started to reply to another, when Sherlock finally jerked back to life.

He tried to tell John the truth.

The case is, indeed, incredible. The sort of case that is enough to get Lestrade to be called in on the weekends is also exactly the sort of case that Sherlock loves. It's probably a bit not good, that the crime rate in London is the biggest part of what gets John through the day, but he's a long ways past caring.
This is-- normal. This is what people do, isn't it? He is taking a dog for a walk in the park. That is all this is. This is
Ella, as it turned out, had been right.
His legs still felt a bit numb, and rather than embarrass himself shortly Sherlock caved himself to sit down, leaning against the arm of his chair. It was like being hit in the face with something he'd never conceptualised to even exist before and now he had no idea what to do with it.
Well, look at that.
It's all right there, in the way John's face falls, and the easiest smile he's ever seen from him flags into nothing.

"Thank you," he said again, and that was that.
John had thought he should see a
"It wasn't," he snapped finally, his voice rough. "Okay? It was horrible. We probably hated each other, by the end. And we probably should never have gotten married in the first place."
The right thing for John to do would've been to take a few days, get his thoughts in order, and only let himself head back to Baker Street when he knew exactly what he was going to say.
John moved carefully closer, just close enough to close his fingers over his. He didn't realise how tightly he was clenching the paper until John's fingers brushed his knuckles, softly loosening the fist he'd formed around the letter. "Like I said, I didn't think you'd want one for yourself." His voice was low, again, almost gentle. "If I was wrong, Cambridge is willing to talk with you, too, but-- I didn't want to get your hopes up about Victor's. Not until I was sure they'd come through."
John gritted his teeth, and kept silent.
not abide by being marked in such a way that John can see it.
Sherlock settles back down at the kitchen table, a hand on his microscope. His wonderful, familiar, chemical-scarred table. The pattern of acid stains on one corner, paling the wood; the little furrow he uses to space his test tube rack from his notes. The chemical smell. The claw marks from when he'd needed to examine the exact appearance of glass shards scratched against wood.
he'd just be able to speak on top of it. And no matter what else happened after it, Sherlock would always remember this, and he'd remember the role John had, unwittingly or not, played in it. He'd have being dragged off and locked away stamped back in his mind as an ever-present threat, should he ever slip again. Should he ever fail. Should he ever not be

"Sod the labels," he said. "Sod all of it. I don't care what you call it. It was a bloody awful marriage. Mary was in love with the idea of Mrs. Dr Mary Watson and what I could do for her more than she'd ever loved me. She only cared if I was happy so much as it affected her. And I knew I was married to someone who didn't actually care about
"Impossible," Sherlock scoffed, and tossed John a look of sheer derision. "Lestrade is not sexually attracted to teenagers. I'd have noticed."
Sherlock sucks his lip between his teeth.
He also had no idea what he was going to say to Sherlock, and could use the night to at least attempt to get his thoughts together.
John whines suddenly, all but ripping a tuft of his hair out. "Sherlock, I'm-- I'm gonna--"
It was over as soon as it had started. Just a quick, light hug between old friends, and then Oscar stepped back, giving the both of them a parting, perfectly smile. "Lovely to see you again," he said again, and then he was off-- hurrying off on his way just as quickly as Sherlock had left John with Dr. Andrews.

So he draws the line before that can ever get off the ground.
It's no loss. Mrs. Hudson is right: he doesn't much care for flowers.
John inhales sharply, his fist white-knuckled and his spine coiled. There's a storm on his face and in his eyes, and for a moment Sherlock is terrified he's going to cry.
Sherlock loves John. For the record.
A short moment of silence followed. Sherlock's breaths continued to stutter over the line, and from behind him, John could just feel Mycroft's level gaze, staring at his back.
play is like all his Christmases have come at once, and... Sherlock can't exactly say no to that, can he? He lives for praise, and
John squeezed his eyes shut, covering his mouth with one hand.
John doesn't move.
"Can you write? Do you think?" John tries to press his phone into Sherlock's shaking hand, but the detective lets it drop to the floor, too upset to listen. "Come on, Sherlock, take another breath... we don't understand what you want--"
that John promising an easy out if he needed it made him feel this much better. First date of his life or no.
"Water? No, Sherlock, you can't yet. You're... no?"
he signs, still sideways.
But Oscar told him it was all right, that he was special, and he was right, wasn't he? Sherlock
"Oh, is it, Sherlock? Is it obvious? Then, do tell. What motivated you to trade in your violin for the chemical rotting of your brain and heart?"
"I think it prudent to explain- I was not actually experimenting to determine your obedience, John. Rather, I was relying on it. You see. I wished to... provide you with a proper incentive. So as to not leave. You used to do that quite a lot, if you remember. That is what people, in general, tend to do. I simply presumed I might be able to increase the proportion of your time spent at home if I provided a reason for you to be here. Something that required your attentions, so to speak.
Sherlock. I'll take it as slowly as you want."
He went back to the kitchen, going after the stock of ginger ale while deciding what to say. Sherlock had probably already consumed copious amounts of it, but there was no harm in trying-- or, John considered, perhaps he'd not had any at all. For Mrs. Hudson to give him some, he'd have had to do more than grumble at her. Instead, there was only an almost entirely untouched cup of cold tea by his side.
Or, it was.
And when it is done--
It was a diploma.
Sherlock leans his head back, sucking in his cheek, and is alive once again.
It's even got the cup of tea and bowl of snacks at his feet. Neither has been touched. Neither had been asked for.
Sherlock shrugged. "You said I never had. And it's true that I haven't in a while, but I have. Had relationships, I mean. And sex." He paused for a moment, stroking his long fingers along the table. "Not that there is anything wrong with asexuality. But I'm not asexual, John. I just don't shag idiots."
And when has he
And it's just-- the silence is too much. He can't do this. He can't.
He breaks off again, swallowing heavily and shivering. John takes another breath, closing his eyes to visibly steel himself, regaining whatever composure has been lost and his footing underneath with it.
And apparently, Sherlock had disagreed.

She had lied to him since the day they'd met, tried to kill his best friend when she knew better than anybody else that Sherlock's death was John's
Then she is out the room and down the stairs, and John is left with a silent Sherlock over his shoulder, who looks considerably better than he has all day.
John kissed him. For one second, two, three. John kissed him for three straight seconds, his hands holding him in place and his mouth soft and hot against his, moving in a way that Sherlock had never experienced before.

Can be anything at all. Really. Just about any sentence will do. All right, doesn't even have to be a sentence-- could even just be Lestrade's name. That's a statement enough.
He'd fix it.
"Please," he scoffed. He slipped another scrape back over the pavement, just far enough to be out of reach. He touched his lip gently, eying the blood on his fingertip rather than John. "And ruin Sherlock's reputation as well? My name wouldn't be the only one to be dragged through the mud. And I daresay those

Not in a worrisome way to bring cause for alarm. Not at all. And John, he could tell, was not worried himself. John, in fact, was as perfectly relaxed as could be. He'd come over to Baker Street that evening without Rosie in tow, though Sherlock wasn't sure what the point of the pretense was-- he slept better the nights he stayed over, and 76% of his possessions were already in the flat. Perhaps it was part of what

what Sherlock is doing, but he's just smart enough to admit that it's necessary. "All right, all right. I'm sure Mrs. Hudson will be thrilled, at any rate." He hesitates again, watching Sherlock with just a tinge of worry. "You'll text me, if you want me to come back. For any reason."
John grits his teeth again, his hand fisting in Sherlock's sleeve. He starts to turn on Donovan to order her to
"Okay," he says. "Okay."
Why was he here?!
Why doesn't he?
"Arrest the husband."

"What?"
The seconds tick by. The noises of the hospital fill the silence, footsteps and files and the distant clicks and beeps of monitors, but between him and Mycroft there is nothing but a dead, sickening quiet. Mycroft sits there, looking down the corridor after his brother, and John waits, hot anger building in his chest and the urge to scream along with it.
Sherlock sits firmly down in the space of the door, his own cup of tea cradled in hand and one eyebrow raised defiantly. He sips.
It's tragic and touching and
Because John had told him to go.
"He didn'... John. He's-- I never-- said no."
He still won't look at him, his face turned severely away and now about as open as a brick wall. He's ice cold and angry, his lips pressed together and his shoulders gone heartbreakingly tense; he's furious again, as furious as he was at the terrible neuropsychologist, but now he's not furious at anyone but himself. It's right there on his face-- Sherlock isn't mad at John. Or maybe he is, a little, but that's not the bulk of it. He's frustrated and upset and above all else, he's mad at himself.
He squeezed his eyes shut, and tried very, very hard not to picture Sherlock, in Dr. Slug in a Suit's flat. Sharing a drink or two, perhaps, a glass of whiskey of their own, or fucking Christ,
John looks at him from across the room, his arms full of prescriptions and a new medical kit. Even with his hands busy with sterile alcohol solution and latex gloves, he still can't help but look the slightest bit amused. "Happy to be home?"
to mean every word of it, and in fact, he probably thinks he does. John is probably sincere in everything that he has just said. And there is certainly a very big part of Sherlock that wants to embrace it all at face value, let John kiss him again like he so clearly wants to do, and then
John shared another look with Mycroft. They were both, he could tell, thinking the same thing-- that

one of the team responsible. In the intervening months since, it appear the only assistance I have been able to provide is in keeping as far from you as possible. Preventing you from injecting trash into your veins, at least while John is unavailable, is..." He pauses, pressing his fist gently against his mouth. "This is perhaps the very least that I can do for you, little brother."
Sherlock hammers a fist on the desk just as the girl starts to step turn away, not to hurt or threaten anyone but instead just trying to pull her attention back. She does stop what she's doing, at least, returning her attention to him in wary apprehension, and security pauses as well, even tenser than her.

He didn't laugh, no. But it was a very near thing.

did not leave him there alone, with any idea as to what was going to happen. You never would have left him there like that if you had known."
"Did you just." He stops, swallowing wetly, and suddenly is back on the bed with Sherlock. "Was that--" And now the smile is back after all, small and tentative, dawning over him like he can barely believe it's true. But it is true. It
Sherlock, to Mary, had always been expendable.
He never wants to see Mycroft in this flat again, and the next time he shows his face here is not going to be pretty.
Never mind stabbing him.
Then he double backed to swing back around the open doorway, and looked down at him in wide-eyed shock.
John is still
John rolled his eyes, and hailed the cab on his own.
He comes up the stairs like a soldier into a warzone, his each and every step radiating tension that they can both hear even from all the way upstairs. "Mycroft," John starts, standing stock still in the doorway and staring between the two of the them with a wariness that suggests he worries a bomb might go off in the flat. He looks ready to throw a punch.
Sometimes he refused to.
The first thing the evidence suggests is probably that both Sherlock and John need to work on their measures of self-esteem and self-worth, but that's neither here nor there.
"Mycroft?" John drops the bags to the floor right there by the door, and he wastes no time at all in rushing to join Sherlock. He doesn't risk touching Sherlock, not yet, but he comes to stand right next to him and he knows both Holmes brothers will read it for what it means.
John can do to fix it.
Normal people could not possibly enjoy this. Could they?
The little shuffle he got from the loosening ball was answer enough.
If Wilson had been a proper partner instead of an abusive fuckwit, John fumed, he would've noticed the symptoms too.
and when John kisses him back it's as if he goes from swimming to drowning. He shrinks underneath his hands, gasping into his mouth and kissing him like this is his last chance and if he doesn't do it now, he'll never be able to do it again.
When his attending tries to schedule him next for a lumbar puncture to search for another possible culprit, a very painful procedure that carries a small but genuine risk of paralysis, John reverses course, and puts his foot down.
"I know, you berk." There was no doubt in his mind what Sherlock would've done. There was no doubt because there was no end to what Sherlock would do to keep him safe, and there was no end at all to what he would do for Rosie.
(See the end of the chapter for
John is gone.
"I wouldn't be of much assistance. I don't feel well."
"And this is Dr. Wilson's lab, but I think I overheard him mention he wasn't looking for any new students, this coming term... we can just--"
Today, he is taking Bosco out for a walk.
His face hurt. The centrifuge whirred over his head, ticking away the seconds with each rhythmic turn, establishing a pattern against the thunk of the old air conditioner. The door swinging open and shut down the hall. The footsteps on the floor above him, the steady pacing that guaranteed it to be a late night class.
"Take a shower and maybe you can snag some of my breakfast before I leave for work."
There isn't one. They both know it.
"Sherlock," he repeated. "
"Well, you can't starve yourself, Sherlock." Nevertheless, John was now glad that the takeaway he'd gotten was sandwiches. Something that would keep in Sherlock's fridge for at least a day or two, and that Mrs. Hudson could get out for him when he felt a bit better.
His face soured and he picked up his fork again, looking almost disgusted. "You're just the same as Victor."
"I don't revisit the past," Sherlock snapped, still without looking at John. "Which is one of the reasons I don't take cases at Cambridge."
Sherlock knows he disapproves, obviously. It just so happens that he also really doesn't care.
Sherlock ducked his face back into his tea, taking a particularly loud sip. He'd gone back to not quite looking at John, stretched back in his armchair and little finger stroking a very quick rhythm along the cup. It wasn't the tremors, this time, but just a habit he'd noticed from Sherlock many years ago. A fidgeting that, ironically, seemed to help him keep still.
Sherlock continues cultivating his words, and points to a line on the menu for Angelo instead.
Greg filled them in on the details on the way down the stairs and then out to the police car on the kerb. Sherlock normally abhorred and refused police cars, but John tugged him inside without allowing protests; there'd be no cab back to catch in the middle of campus, and Sherlock was in no state to go walking it back to a main street. Greg, meanwhile, talked over the grumbles, explaining the details of a professor who'd been found in her office that afternoon, a bullet in her head that their medical team said hadn't been fired until she was already dead. It was right up Sherlock's alley, and John couldn't deny that already felt a bit better, too.
He's pretty sure
"Your brain's still going a mile a minute, isn't it? I can see it." He moved even closer, his voice dropped to a low husk and his moist lips moving against his ear. "What are you thinking about?"
"God, no, he was a horrible student. I never had him myself, to be honest, but I heard the rumors. His brother had to try to pull some strings, to get him to pass, but even that wasn't enough. Nobody liked him back then, he was always a bit odd, you know..."
This was right. He could feel it.
Sherlock says nothing, and he's shaking harder, now. He's so fucking
"Mycroft got in contact with me last night."

A silence settled in the flat, Sherlock cold and perfectly motionless, his face tilted up just enough to look at John. He looked up at him with those wide, vulnerable eyes, his arms still clutched around him and his white face drained, but beat by beat, John saw his walls start to come. He sat there
"I was clever, of course," Sherlock went on. Casually again, like he wasn't bothered at all. "More than clever enough for him. But also-- stupid. Very, very stupid."
So he's drawn him a map instead.
It takes him until the fourth gulp to realise he can't even hear the words in his head.
Bosco comes bounding back over after a time, tongue lolling and each breath a hot pant. He seems to have decided he wants some more human interaction, and Sherlock slides off the bench just in time to get licked in the face.

Oscar laughed. He laughed out loud, so suddenly and so loudly that Sherlock flinched back. Usually, when people laughed, it was at him, and it was only the beginning of something much worse. But all Oscar did was finally,
He remembers, later, trying to stagger away. He'd barely been in control of his own body but the one thing he'd still known, then, was that he wanted to be alone. He
So, a bundle of files under each arm and a pen in Sherlock's teeth, they head home.
"You're doing really well, actually," John says carefully, when he has decided they have evidently been sitting here long enough. "I know you're getting impatient, but I've been keeping an eye on your charts, Sherlock. Everything looks good and is looking better by the day. You'll be home in a couple days."
There was one positive, however, about Sherlock refusing to come along during the interviews.
"I'm not just talking about cutting yourself or whatever you're picturing that you've never done. I'm talking about the drugs. I'm talking about jumping off bloody rooftops and planning suicide missions. I'm talking about all these harebrained

Sherlock opened and shut his mouth, the muscles in his jaw jumping. Once again clearly disliking the spotlight, he broke gazes with John, rubbing the heel of his hand over his chest. "What exactly-- is the point of this?" He rubbed the scar again, twisting a fistful of dressing gown into his fingers and over his chest. "Mary is dead. Which, by the way, is much worse off than me. I'm fairly sure you're not meant to speak ill of the dead."
John waved his mobile at him as he strode inside, kicking the door back shut. "Told them I had an emergency with Milgram. Got lots of well-wishes that my son would be all right and promises to see me next time."
On a date.
John thumbed his thin wrist, previously folded underneath his side, and felt his breaths. His heartbeat was steady, albeit underneath admittedly cool skin, and his breaths were even and deep.
John's eyes are warm and bright, and as much as Sherlock's stomach is a knot, he looks like this is the easiest thing in the world. "You are... the singularly most amazing person I have ever or will ever meet. You make me happier than Mary ever could. I really don't know why you're so determined to not get that, why you're so determined that my happiness has to come at the expense of your own, but this, right here? This is all that I want." His throat jumps and suddenly he's splintering apart, almost desperate as he clutches his hands tighter, like he can't bear to let go. "I'm probably going to want to hit you the next time you lie to me, and we'll probably have a shouting match by this time next week, and whenever you next get hurt, I'm warning you now, it's not going to be pretty, but- I don't

He's sitting in A&E now. Grumpy, his already apparently ugly shirt now ruined with dots of blood and exchanged for a borrowed scrub top instead, and every single bit of him sore as a wrung out flannel. It's exhausting--
Mycroft does love Sherlock. That much is clear, purely from the quietly distressed look on his face alone. He may have absolutely no idea how to show it, and he may drive John up the wall with his mere existence, and Sherlock might spit fire and vitriol at him from the moment that he wakes up, but Mycroft does love Sherlock. Being here, and seeing him like this, is no easier for him than it is for John.
The last bit was said as a joke, to help him relax. But there was more. He could feel it, in how John's fingers moved against his.
John bit his tongue hard. He made himself keep perfectly still, and especially his hand, still folded around Sherlock's. He knew it was important to let him tell this in his own way, in his own time, without someone sitting by to speak up and tell him that what he felt was
"Sherlock? Sherlock
They are memories.
that you're always fussing over? Always ordering me all about the city, calling me home from across the country to water the damn thing?"

His mouth moves soundlessly, cracked lips drifting through motions that are too slow and sluggish for him to ever translate.

he misses how it sounds when he's excited and railing through a series of deductions at light speed. He misses how it sounds when Sherlock is bellowing his name from across the bloody flat to demand tea.
Sherlock bullied his way straight into the office without another word, leaving Dr. Andrews, looking particularly insulted, behind. And John probably should've followed him. Sherlock could look after himself, after all, and certainly didn't need John to tell people off behind his back, people that he didn't even care about in the slightest, for comments that Sherlock had brushed off without the faintest pause. What Sherlock actually needed from him now was to head into the crime scene himself, so he could take a look at the body, and give a proper medical consult.
Fuck them. Fuck the two that are still out there and fuck the four that are already dead. How

It was all Sherlock needed to realise that this was less about John and Mary than he'd thought, and about Oscar instead.
In the mornings-- long after John has headed off to work, and Mrs. Hudson has brought up tea, and there is no case, so when it is only Sherlock, and just Sherlock, and will only and just be him for the foreseeable future--
He doesn't dare move, can't dare to do anything at all beyond watch him with bated breath and wait. He's doing it. He's writing. He can't speak but he can write. Damn it, Mycroft was right, Mycroft was
And there was more to that, more guilt and horror and shame, but John didn't have the words for it. If he kept trying to find them he was probably going to end up breaking into tears, and the one thing he'd already sworn to not do today was
Thank you so much for all the kudos/comments!!! I hope you're somewhere warm and comfortable and you've got your snacks and beverage of your choice, because now it's time for a /really goddamn long chapter/. We've got 50k words and two seasons worth of miscommunication to talk through, so settle in!
It's for the best anyway, he thinks. Still curled up there and looking pathetic. His violin, while under the influence of drugs, sounds absolutely disastrous. It's the screeching of a cat beat against the walls and it's out of tune screeching at that. He's recorded it once, for the sake of science, and never again.
It hardly matters how. What matters is that he dies, he dies, he
Someday, he will.
No one was worth him becoming this.
And then, there was John.
He would also stand as a testament to the day that Sherlock Holmes was chased out of Scotland Yard by one extremely irate John Watson, whacked about the shoulders with a snapping case file, all to the irresistible screeching tune of,
"No, Sherlock," John said, almost teasing, now. He smiled faintly, looking at him with the sort of patience one might treat a small child with. "
Another moment of silence.
Useless platitudes, all of it. It doesn't matter what it's called. The fact of the matter is, he still can't speak, John is still miserable, and Sherlock doesn't know how to fix it.
He thinks about Sherlock's slack, all but unrecognisable face.
John stared back down at his hands, this time in no small effort to stop himself from looking at Sherlock's lips instead. This wasn't exactly something he wanted to ever discuss with Sherlock, and for reasons that he could never tell him.
Yes. Sherlock knows. He'd gotten the truth from Mycroft months ago.
They shouldn't have come here.
"Or... not?"
But letting that topic continue opened up the possibility for it to turn down some very dangerous avenues, such as
Like Moriarty's cell, in the deepest basement, he can not delete it. But he can do everything in his power to sequester all that these rooms are, and keep them that way.
Sherlock shakes his head. The threads of the blanket stretch and bunch between his knees, one in particular that is long and fraying.
John, even worse, is of no help at all.
Not-Mary-Morstan shoots Sherlock, and he dies on the floor of Magnussen's penthouse.
The paper deserves to be crumpled up and binned at the soonest opportunity.
"He never hit me. Not once. He never forced me, either. I always said yes." His voice was edging higher-pitched, with a note of barely discernible aggression-- he sounded almost defensive. "It wasn't at all like your parents. It... it wasn't
he sees it, now, of course. John doesn't realise it was all a plan, that he was never in any genuine danger, of course. John thinks he was actually in danger. Sherlock starts to sign his intentions, trying to explain it as simply as he can--
"Know
He strums an out of tune minor third, plucking the two strings together with sore fingertips. It resonates just next to his ear, like the chime of a clock bell.
"I think she knew if she hit Rosie I would leave her, and there was nothing to be gained by hitting me. Maybe she knew you'd kill her if she did, I don't know. She--"
He frowned down at the letter again.
John does not take it well.
if he tries to touch him, but all the bastard does is gesture with enough smugness to choke on it. "He barely sleeps; he certainly didn't last night-- I can see it from here--"
And right now, Sherlock is content to curl himself up and around his tea, nudged into John's side, and let John stroke his hair.
And then, when Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister's, and Mycroft is out of the country, and John is going to be home late today because he's got his first meeting scheduled with a BSL tutor, and Sherlock is
It's all very mundane and pedestrian. Sherlock lets it happen without anything more than token protestations, and once they are both sufficiently thawed out and defrosted, gets John to make good on his promise to snog the living daylights out of him, Mycroft or no.
He has always found it easier to express sentiment and emotion acceptably through his violin. It's hateful, to try and put it to words-- he already knows what he wants to say will always come out wrong. He's passionate about creepy, freakish things, his limits are all wrong, the things he actually wants to say are always inappropriately timed or make someone cry or a bit not good. He can't do things
"There it is, love."
He brokers his own release exceedingly quickly, because the goal is expediency, not pleasure. Orgasm comes with his own slick knuckle and his sleeve sucked between his teeth, where he bites into his own hand so hard there's blood now and will be bruises in the morning. It's awkward, exhausting, and utterly soundless, but he keeps his mouth shut through all of it and only gasps, and in the wake of it he shivers on his side with his own face hot and his heart pounding. John's presence is behind him, a constant and steady weight, his fingers still curled on his back, and it's as addictive as heroin.
Sherlock again waited for John to step back to shrug for a second time. "Technically." He worked his jaw, splaying his fingers out in his lap. "You met him, the other day. Oscar. Dr. Oscar Wilson, at Cambridge."
Thank you so much for all the comments/kudos!!!
John is able to tell immediately he is not waking up. He's not ready to yet, and the drugs they have him on reflect that fact. He shifts in bed, his face settling into a pained, worried grimace, and hands twitch, but he is not awake. A nightmare, then.
Sherlock has never in his life wanted to be coddled. Sherlock has never, in all the years that he has known him, responded well to kindness, and gentleness, and care. Not like that.
John stiffened. His hands suddenly ached and the angry knot in his stomach started to morph into something even more awful instead.
That's why he's here, and it's still not helping.
No matter how nervous Dr. Slug in a Suit had made Sherlock earlier today, whatever it was about him or this that had worried Sherlock, if it even was anything he'd
Sherlock rolls his eyes again, scratching a second check mark into the nearest limb, and drops down between John's legs.
Sherlock suddenly reeled upright, halfway through toeing off his borderline rotten trainers, held together by duct-tape and more mud. He swung around to stare at Lestrade with furious eyes, gleaming in the dark on something even more potent than heroin. "I can be whatever I want," he snarled, and suddenly advanced. "Yes? I'm
This was how things were meant to be.
John frowned. "Hey, Sherlock?" He prodded at his arm a little, just a gentle tug at his sleeve to try and draw him out of it. "We're here?"
sighed again. He looked down at him for a moment, his smile faded again, this time... displeased. Displeased? At him. Yes. He'd done something wrong, again.
Sherlock, that's--
She hadn't shot anybody else and then had the gall to sit there and claim she'd done nothing wrong, so he should count his blessings?
"...you do realise that I'm not going to take care of- Cana-"
and they are clumsy, ineloquent, and as lacking in dramatic flair as is possible. Precisely no part of this morning has gone as it was supposed to.
stayed away! I was waiting, Sherlock-" He rubs his face again with a shaking hand, starting to pace back and forth. "You used to text me ten time a day, you texted me to meet you at Bart's once when I was in
Sherlock's reeling voice shuddered to a stop.
John stayed still in the doorway, watching him in a way that was entirely uncomfortable. Probably would've been uncomfortable, if Sherlock had unfolded enough to see it. He just looked at him for several long moments, then footsteps came again, crossing across the carpet with soft thuds and away from him, traversing to the kitchen.
me. Besides, John is with me. I'll be fine."
There are footsteps on the stairs behind them. John, for one moment, Sherlock still shivering in his arms and whiter than his shirt, is more than ready to shout at whoever the fuck it is to get the hell out.
the look on Mycroft's smug face. But right now, all this is about is getting Mycroft the fuck out of this flat. Everything else will wait.
His collar is stiff and sticky from where it's stuck to his neck, and he tugs it lose, grinning at John.
He wants so
"I have a surgery shift today. Not important, though. Someone wants their vaccine jabs. Another need a physical for work. Here would be more interesting. Especially after last night."
It was John's turn to flinch.
weren't they. Never could sit through and wait an expectant silence out. Always had to keep on running their mouths and giving him exactly what he wanted. "You know who I am. And I know who you are, too-- I've seen the news about you. You think I could honestly be seen associating with someone like you? A drug addict? A
"Sixteen, when the sex started."
"I'd ask you to use your magical taxi hailing abilities to call me a ride," John started, squeezing his fingers. "But something tells me you'd refuse to, just for the excuse to drag me back in there."
And--
I want him and I'm scared of what it'd be because I don't know what worse is. But I can't do worse. I can't anymore. I'm so
" John sighed, "for you. Yes? Christ, it's like getting a child a puppy- you have to take care of him. It. You can't be texting me to come home from work just because you can't be arsed to get up to water it, or, or-
"Hey, I really am sorry about this. I didn't--"
He swipes his scarf off the bathroom counter, and emerges back into the flat with his hair still drying and a grin of his face.
There it was. The first time he had ever said that word aloud. Sherlock was gay, and very much a man, and here John was, another man, telling him that he loved him. He was
John nods, rubbing his back. "Okay. Okay."
"I was drunk. I was--" Sherlock pulled back just enough to look up at him but still clung to him, his long fingers suddenly digging into his back, grasping him close as a lifeline. "I was drunk, you heard me, I had no idea what I was--"
and hadn't gotten up. Just like a certain consulting detective genius on the pavement outside Barts, so many years later.
And because he hoped that if he turned this into less of an interrogation, if he took the expectation of a monologue off of Sherlock, this would be easier. It was one thing, to sit here and demand answers out of Sherlock, out of what had quite clearly been a very painful period in his life, and one that he clearly still didn't quite understand. It was, John hoped, quite another, to establish a give and take.
He can't do it. It's been too long after all; he's let it lie for too many months, he's failed, and now he
"She told him to do it," he forced out, like he was dragging the words through a minefield of broken glass with his bare hands. The words felt distant and tiny, foreign, each one sick in his stomach that made him grind his teeth. He felt defeated. "For me."
And all of that has culminated in the very worst way in what Mycroft had tried to do here today.
Another second passed. Two. Three.
"...Sherlock, are you trying to tell me you killed our house plant for an experiment and replaced it with a plastic one instead?"
And John's not making much sense, either, but Sherlock isn't a genius for nothing, and he grins back. "Yep." It feels like he's floating and he pulls John back down on top of him; the only words he wants to say now are ones into John's mouth. "Had to be sure."
Oh. Well. All right, then.
Sherlock turned slowly back to him, hanger in hand. The shirt on it was, indeed, blue. A faded and worn blue, that looked like a pilfered uniform shirt for a factory worker, and a name tag that said
is from his throat. He looks at John beside him and suddenly is nothing but helpless. "I don't want to
He lapsed into another silence, his mouth tightly shut. A frown creased across his face, his eyes distant, and John gripped his hand even tighter.
Sherlock blinks.
"But we can't risk him getting rid of the evidence, so-- Sherlock? What are you... oh, fine--" Lestrade sighs, even going so far as to lift his arm as to allow him better access to the cigarettes in his pocket. "And we don't even know for sure he's home at all, I don't think that's a good idea..."
But the wide-eyed vacant look of sheer
"Sherlock was fifteen."
John isn't left behind and Sherlock isn't gone away and what more could he ever ask for? What else could ever make this right?
done is spy on him from your office. Not exactly brother of the year. And I didn't do anything but encourage Sherlock to give this a shot!"
was. Lestrade had given in sometime ago to pillow his head in his arms, half-empty cup of coffee cradled in his hand, to try not to fall asleep at the table.
He can feel the pressure in his throat, a dam that allows air but swells to suffocate him whenever he tries for anything else.
"...John?"
Sherlock's arms instantly lower to squeeze around him, his head of wild curls burying down into his shoulder. He can't see Sherlock's face anymore, he can't tell what he's thinking or what he feels, but he doesn't have to to know to hug Sherlock back.
And this time, Sherlock had more than just Mycroft on his side.
"Alci- aclo...
And then, just like that, he let him go.
"I. Want. To. Go. Home."
He even knows what he wants to say-- he's not repeating the mistake he made with Lestrade. He is going to say,
Sherlock shrugged, still avoiding John's gaze. He folded his arms to glower across the room, both as if something over in the kitchen had personally offended him and John did not even exist. "A few days."
One more chapter... and I think we can all guess the last step there is to take! :D
"Oh, yes, I'm quite sure it'll be just one. Until you want another one. And then another after that. Because that how it goes, isn't it, Sherlock?" Mycroft glances at the ashtray in passing disgust, his glare sliding off of Sherlock like rain slicking the streets outside. "This, Sherlock. This is why I worry about you,
"I wanted to--" Sherlock hiccuped, his voice cracked, "I wanted... I wanted to so
Then, he turned back around, and crossed the room over to Milgram.
That night, he picks up his violin.
But whatever it is that has him so upset, he just can't communicate it. John worries that that's exactly the problem. This all happened because some sodding bastard took him by surprise, he wasn't able to communicate, and got assaulted because of it. The fact that he can't communicate
he cries, pushing the phone back into Lestrade's face.
He wavers suddenly, hitching downward and jerked back up again on wavering legs. He stares at John like he's having to fight very hard to keep his eyes open.
His heart skipped.
"Please don't-- look like that. It's okay, I promise. But can you just... can you give me something, here?"
and have him admitted, whether it's under his own power or kicking and screaming.
Next chapter is an important one! *spraybottles Mycroft in preparation* Chapters 2 and 3 are more fillery, which is why I posted this on early, so I can try and post the next one soon!
Mycroft sits calmly in
Sherlock sighs deeply, flipping the case back shut. John is right, of course. John is ever and always right. He strokes the heavy case one last time before pushing up to his feet again, swiveling back around to face him. John is watching him, still, warm and smiling and just a little smug, and oh, how Sherlock
"I still don't know if I was angry at Sherlock, for having what I didn't, or..."
As if he could read his mind, Sherlock slumped just a little more in his seat, still frowning out the window and his mouth slipping into even more of a pout. "All right," he muttered, almost outright sulking. "I'll give the scene a look."
He pulled back to press his face against John's hair, his frown deepening severely. "Nobody asked him."
But John won't find him here, and that's rather the point.
John is angry at him. It is everything that Sherlock has wanted to prevent, and it is everything that he has always been powerless to stop. John has tried, so very hard, to be patient. He has taken care of Sherlock for months, and months, and
John squeezed his hand, one last time, and then let go. "Okay. Okay, Sherlock. We don't have to do anymore today." He watched the hard line of his jaw for a moment, how there was no relief there at all, and moved closer to kiss him again instead of pressing the point.
Thanks so much for all the comments/kudos!!! One more chapter after this! :D
Maybe things were better before, but John is still okay with how things are
He took his notes, and with each interview, his sense of apprehension grew.
He tilts his head back and spits out a silent laugh, his throat sore in the cold and his teeth chattering, and texts the damn reply.
The frantic gasps for air dwindle, now that Sherlock's arm is no longer stressed behind his back. The tiny, hoarse whines from his throat do not. And John may've spent three months desperately wishing for nothing more than for Sherlock to speak, but screaming on the floor of a crime scene is not ever what he had meant, and that is what this is, no matter how little his rough, disused voice sounds like it. This is not healthy. This is not
do was support him trying to find that happy ending with someone else.
He refuses to talk about Mary, the baby, the divorce, or anything at all remotely relating to his pending ex-wife. He doesn't even seem pleased that Sherlock is working on the case at all. He refuses, and ordinarily, Sherlock doesn't really care what John
First, he attempted to remove Milgram from public view. It would be simple enough, surely. He would tell John the experiment had concluded, and he had given Milgram to Molly or Lestrade or Stamford or anybody at all who didn't live within the vicinity of Baker Street, and that would be that.
Then, he pushed to his feet, and walked to the kitchen without another word.
He does not want to talk about this.
"No, it's about bullet wound, actually." She paused, her mouth twitching a little. "And it maybe is about the heroin too, a little."
. "You don't have to say it back. Especially if you don't... feel the same way. But I--"
Sherlock glared.
But. Yes. Needs must, after all. After all other options had been exhausted, there was nothing else for it but to tell the truth.
for a stakeout.
He blew out a frustrated sigh, his fingers locked together under his chin. "I am saying that-- who I am is not simply a choice to be difficult. Sometimes it is, because I agree with Mycroft, most of the niceties that I can emulate are a waste of time, but... I am still only capable of emulating them. I don't understand most of them, John, and I will never be... normal."
The picture clicked, and John couldn't help it. He sank deeper into his chair, and he laughed. He listened to Sherlock on the verge of tears or throwing up or both on the phone, and he laughed. "Good," he coughed, his heart heavy. "Take some deep breaths, Sherlock. It's fine if you get sick. You'll feel better after."
Today, John can only hope, is a good day.
But if playing the violin is akin to speaking, then it only makes logical sense, that composing would be akin to writing.
he wants this. Sherlock opens his mouth, trying to respond properly, to make some sort of noise,
John was going to his conference, then. And Sherlock's standard methods of persuasion were not going to be enough to block it, this time.
Oscar's business card, he noted, was slipped silently into Sherlock's deep pockets.
Sod Mycroft. Sod all of this.
This time, there was no part of him that even tried to argue back that it actually hadn't been his fault.
"You'll leave Sherlock alone, then?" He grinned back, a bitter taste in his mouth. "Because he really didn't want to come here today, and at first I didn't know why. But now, I'm going to hazard a guess it was you."
He looked bloody gorgeous.
He spun back about to face John, his chin lifted and his eyes ablaze, and said, "I loved Victor."
Who had been there on Skype, possibly overhearing the shouting, watching John vanish off screen with little more than a goodbye.
"What's he saying?" Greg presses, coming closer himself. "John?"
Suddenly, the words are
Because there's nothing physically
Molly is his next stop.
John thinks helplessly, crumbling back. He clenches his hands in his lap and feels like nothing more than a useless, ineffectual lump.
John collides into him, and he doesn't know anything at all beyond the slam of his fist into his jaw. He punches him in the face once, and then again, and he just goes
John cocked his fist back, and punched the man in the face for the fourth time that night.
"He's also allowing a temporary reprieve, due to the pregnancy," he continues carefully, when John makes it apparent that he is not going to say anything. "Mary will remain in protective custody until the baby is born." It's protection for Sherlock and John- not for her. "At that point, you will be given full custody, pending the successful completion of her mission. Beyond that, Mary appears most focused on retaining her freedom before anything else."
"Then--"
Sherlock seemed to want, very much, to lay down on the sofa after this, whether John was there or not. Perhaps specifically if John
"Sherlock," he ventures, reaching a hand for him, then stops. Rather than touching Sherlock's arm, his hands curl together in his lap instead, and his voice is very, very quiet. "I... need to apologise."

Thank you all so much for all the comments/kudos!!! Look, I can actually write quickly when it's not 8k long angst chapters :D
Francis nods again, his eyes contemplative. Sherlock has to still his hand from showing off, to ask about the third anniversary dinner he has planned for tonight.
"No, I didn't."
"Well, Sherlock, that does tend to be what happens, when one takes a baseball bat to the head. Perhaps you'll remember that for next time."
He turns to the suite's attached bathroom. The door is shut. John had left it open.
Another minute.
Sherlock scoffs again-- silent, always silent-- and resists the urge to toss his fucking phone across the room.
But it's also the most fond, the look of resignation on his face that is exquisitely familiar, and Sherlock beams.
Now that he's opened his mouth, he never wants to shut it again.
He skypes Molly on day...
"Yes."
There is nothing that Sherlock has ever wanted more than this.
"There we go," Dr. Wilson said again, squeezing the flannel of ice. "How'd this happen? You look as if you had a bad run-in with a door."
He cleared his throat, and broached it himself.
It's probably a bad idea. Sherlock is not stupid, and just because he doesn't announce his deductions for the world to hear them nowadays does not mean he isn't making them. Sherlock will know he's staying home because he's worried about him. Sherlock will also not appreciate it one bit.
If John had a teenage patient that fit Sherlock's case, his first question would've been how the hell his parents hadn't noticed or brought their child in for a check-up until now. Sherlock's parents, it seemed, hadn't been involved here, so John's next question would be how such a brilliant student had gotten so sick without noticing it, and why an eighteen year old was under so much stress in the first place.
John calls in sick, and goes to Tesco's instead.
"You'd best move back in with Mary."
Bargaining chip. A
Mycroft looked away with a scowl, a stiff, an especially unhappy scowl. "Sherlock has never told me what happened, but yes. It is exactly the same. He went in for his final committee hearing, just a few weeks before graduation, and right before the meeting Dr. Wilson told him that his progress on his main project wasn't satisfactory, and he wouldn't be allowed to present. Dr. Wilson gave him some of his own data to present instead, but it wasn't a project Sherlock knew anything about, and half an hour wasn't enough time for even him to learn it well enough for a presentation where he was meant to be showcasing years of experience and expertise. The committee all but laughed him out of the room, and Dr. Wilson announced in front of the entire panel how disappointed he was in Sherlock. How much of a failure he was, and how badly he had let him down." He paused again, glancing at John, as if unsure if he should go on and explain what happened next.
He does not mention enough, how much he both loves and hates his brother. He also definitely does not mention enough how much he absolutely
is home.
He sends mind palace John away, and Redbeard with him. He gets the vague feeling that he sends the real John away, too, shooing him off to bed with a vague hand wave and the impression that he has a case that needs thinking about. In some ways, it's not even a lie. This is one of the most important cases of his life.
John nearly keeled all the way back into his chair in sheer relief.
"...can I get back to you on that, Mycroft?"
John's amusement faded as quickly as it had come. He kept his mouth shut, but privately, all he could think was that, once again, Sherlock was being extremely unfair to himself. Mycroft had read the situation better than Sherlock because he had been an adult, with life experience, and had had the opportunity to observe relationships in others and recognise when one was healthy and one was not. Sherlock had been
"Yeah?" He sounded angry again, somehow, his voice warped to be low and threatening, but more than that, Sherlock almost heard an element of hurt. "So, what, then? I'd be left sitting up here knitting a tea cozy, and meanwhile Lestrade is on his way over to tell me you got blown up by a sociopath and I'm never going to see you again?"
But Sherlock wasn't listening to him, because he'd called Mycroft. Because John was the reason he was out there drunk out of his mind in the first place.
He spends a few minutes alternating between searching through the pictures, building up what he wants to says in his head, and keeping an eye on Lestrade. Ordinarily he'd be pacing, speaking it through aloud, but his chest hurts and his tongue is dry and the longer he sits down here, the more he really just wants to lie down.
There are two men in suits on the street, standing silently just outside the door to the flat. On the kerb idles the long, black car that is symptomatic of a spontaneous appearance of Mycroft Holmes, and both men have the unmistakeable appearance of being his government agents.
John nodded, chewing on the inside of his cheek. "That's normal," he told him, keeping his voice patient. "Stay sitting up. With all you've had to drink--"
It was one of John's
He has stayed by Sherlock's side despite signing up for precisely none of this, and permitted him to be silent despite there being nothing at all that is wrong with him.

And it's selfish, but Sherlock finds he's much more committed to just keeping John

Sherlock still stood just inside the restaurant, surrounded by gentle piano music and waiters in tuxedos and London's idiotic upper class, and felt just a little bit like he was going to throw up.
John swallows again, and forces himself to keep his mouth shut.

John was honestly started to get a little unsettled, now. Sherlock was still just staring at him, his eyes pale and wide, like the day John had asked him to be his best man. Except now it was over a suit and the right color of dress shirt. "I don't know, whatever matches, Sherlock." He once again grabbed an item from the closet, adding it to the cotton draped over his arm. "Come on, I know you're not really this thick, you'd said you'd been on dates before--"
They sit there like that, Sherlock on the floor and John's trembling hands in his hair. Sherlock desperately doesn't want to see the devastated look on his face, so he doesn't look up. He just breathes in John's shirt and shakes his head.
Bosco is a well-behaved, eager dog, so much so that it's safe enough to just let his leash go when they get to the park. He bounds off in an instant, tearing over the grass to the nearest other dogs he can find, and Sherlock simply settles himself on the bench to wait.
Sherlock pauses. Considers.

"I don't know," he says, still frowning at the ceiling. "He doesn't talk to me, either. I'm guessing I'll get a paragraph long text from him in a few and he'll expect me to translate it for you."
Right then, in that instant-
This, John determines, squeezing him even tighter, will be good enough.

had said that.
It strikes Sherlock then, as they stumble down the pavement together, his arm fallen lazily around John's shoulders and John's wrapped in equal parts affection and fake drunk around his back. They trip over their own feet and John laughs into his shoulder, holding him close, and it may all be an act, but John is draped all over him right there in the middle of the street and all Sherlock can feel is how much John

this was a step too far, now. Ordered back home to look after their supposedly fragile house plant, he could take, but now insulting his detective work?! Even if it was, perhaps, technically true, that John knew what they were looking for better than Sherlock himself-
Sherlock thinks he does not mention enough, how much he both loves and hates his brother.
But Sherlock breathed deeply next, his voice muffled, as if he'd buried his face into his hands or knees. "You can't tell John," he said, and there was a loud scrape, like a clumsy footstep. "'ll never forgive you, Mycroft, 'll set your favorite bakery on

Sherlock shoos him off with an absentminded wave of his good hand. He doesn't even come close to looking up from the book.

He'd never met this one. He wasn't sure John had ever so much as told him the new one's name. So he pictured Jeanette, instead. He pictured the boring teacher, with her polite mannerisms and inoffensive smiles, the way she told jokes that didn't make the room go dead silent and had never once made anyone at that get-together cry. He pictured John going with her to the movies, to watch something boring and dull and mind-numbing, with a shared mundane popcorn in his lap and his arm worked carefully around her small shoulders. It was dull, dull,
Sherlock showed up here, upset, bewilderingly, about a newspaper article, talking all about a Cambridge professor's grounding achievement of the decade. Sherlock claimed to know the scientist responsible for the work, and said he was dead of a heroin overdose. Not exactly a common habit, among hugely successful scientists.
There'd been a little ember of hope, catching fire right in his chest. Sherlock
That wasn't it at all.
this was going to not go well. He measured his breaths for another moment, keeping himself calm, listening to the warmth and comfort that was Sherlock, pressed so close to him."I don't think that you're ready for a relationship right now, Sherlock."
For the second time, John was glad to have already put his porcelain cup down.
Not like this, and definitely not
John doesn't know how long they sit there on the floor, Sherlock gasping his breaths back underneath control, his wet, miserable face still tilted away. He's embarrassed of it, ashamed, and there's nothing John can do to fix that without calling attention to it in the first place. So he sits there and lets Sherlock hide his face, and he rubs circles into his back and kissed the exposed skin, occasionally, whenever the moment is presented. Warm, chaste kisses pressed to the slope of his neck, the curve of his shoulder. Slowly, bit by bit, Sherlock calms down.
Sherlock deigned not to answer, instead letting his gaze just linger on the ceiling, and John, of course- John gave in right away. It hadn't been long at all, but John had already learned to pick his battles, and that the invasion of an extraordinary species of plant into the flat wasn't one worth fighting.
It is well past midnight, when they finally manage to spill back into 221B.
John's not the only one who loves it.
Two hours was long enough for dinner. Wasn't it? It wasn't as if they were going to catch a movie afterwards or stop by a pub for a drink. Not Sherlock. Two hours was long enough for dinner. They'd be getting the check right now, and soon, they'd be hailing taxis, separate taxis, and Sherlock would be on his way back home. Of course.
and John Watson is better off every time.
"Well," Sherlock said, with a very slight, tentative smile. "I
is it not? And this is not the first time that you've expressed how worried you are about how John sees you. Your difficulties and anxiety about recovering your voice are not something you can separate that easily from your anxiety concerning John. The two are inextricably linked." He tilts his head, watching Sherlock in a way that is coming to remind him of John. "You need to trust him, Scott."
Sherlock grins wryly at John, when the next shove is turned into John shouldering the second idiot straight off the pavement.
Of course it's not okay. Why is John saying that it's okay?
you were serious. That you wanted to--"
"I am Sherlock Holmes."
"Will not," he muttered, impudently, almost like a child. Then, "never do,", and John's amusement collapsed in on itself.
No precarious happiness Sherlock has to offer will ever have a measure against that.
John, thankfully, had been left out of it. A more sympathetic character could not be painted than the single father to a baby girl and a widower, a widower who had only just survived the tragic loss and brutal murder of his wife. Nobody wanted a headline smearing the name and reputation of
Have dinner with me?
What an absolute disgrace.
Never once does he find what he expects to. There is no more of the anger and chastisement from earlier today at all. John does not demand that he answer him, get inside, explain his actions earlier today, or anything else.
It's worse.
but the facts were that Sherlock had stepped off a rooftop and John was his best friend. John should've known. He should've--
He would never in his life want to have that. He didn't understand why John wanted it, either, because John did not like boring or mundane things and there was no other word to describe it. But John went on dates anyway and Sherlock hated it, because Sherlock could never do it.
He'll make that cup of tea after all.
-- I could step outside and get hit by a car tomorrow! I want-- I..."
He's careful, as he removes the handcuffs. Careful to hold Sherlock's still recuperating arm in place, careful not to throw the fucking things to clatter noisily against the floor, careful to talk him through it, keeping his voice confident, reassuring, and calm. Above all, John is careful to watch Sherlock's wet face, searching for some sign that this is too much for him, or that what John is doing is scaring him, but there is nothing there. There is
John, do you see? I absolutely could not risk you... going away. Which is, again, what people tend to do. I... John. I am interesting company, and exciting company. But one thing I am not is
Sherlock has no idea what he's supposed to say.
"Humor me, brother dear. It is your first time on your own. She only wants to know that you are adjusting."
He is sick and tired of this.
Which makes Lestrade the absolutely perfect test case.
"I. Don't.
The heart attack is instantaneous, and John steels himself against the swoop of nausea. His first instinct is to be alarmed, because it's
Ah. So the awkward apology is going to come now, is it?
There was a very small waver there, underneath the words. Minuscule, but present.
Because this made John happy. Because John wanted him to be normal, and this was what normal people did. Dates. Relationships.
John," he snaps, "it's not even that! It's just
Francis hands back the collection of sheets he's gathered over the session, when the hour is up-- it was one of the conditions Sherlock had had, upon agreeing to therapy in the first place. "I'll see you next week, then?" Francis holds his hand out for Sherlock to shake, as he readjusts his scarf and tugs his coat down and his suit jacket straight. There's something curious on his face, for just one moment. And then:
"Upstairs?" John murmurs, one hand slid between his sticky collar and his throat. The other curls possessively in Sherlock's hair, his strong fingers tugging him closer, close enough to feel the steady pattern of his heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
he rasped again. He made a slow, quickly aborted reach for his hand, and he even sounded a little sad. "You can't really think-"
If this is what John wants, can't he simply give it to him?
No sound comes out.
He sits forward, and kisses John. He kisses John with all the force and desperation of a dying man, his hands tangling into his hair and face with a possessiveness that is hungry, that
But he can't tell him this, and that is precisely the problem.
"Sixth date didn't work out?"
"..."
John!
All feedback is welcome and appreciated!!! Thank you so much for reading, and stay healthy! <3
This, with John's arms around him, and the heat of his kiss still lingering on his throat, and the look on his face quite possibly the happiest thing that Sherlock will ever see in his entire life, is enough.
Sherlock scratches a check mark into his neck, and John's grin fills him up from the inside out.
Frustration swells inside him, frustration and

"Yes."

That was decidedly
Being ambushed and drugged on the street, just when they thought the case was ending. Waking up in the cold pool with the explosives already wired, and Moriarty in his ear. Moriarty's warm, cheerful accent, explaining and promising in very exact detail how he would do to all the pieces of John's body, and what precisely he would do to Sherlock, if John was to disobey.
Another few moments passed in complete quiet, uncomfortable enough to hear a pin drop on the street below.
Please.
He doesn't mind himself, like this. He could do without the pain, but... he can live with the scars.
to communicate, but could not, then he would still be trying. He would be furious and frightened and frustrated, and it would be coming out. It's
He quickly exchanges a few details with Lestrade, setting up a time when he'll give his statement for the assault case that's currently pending, thanking him for helping Sherlock out, assuring him that he really is fine, he just wants to go home. Sherlock, of course, takes no part in the conversation whatsoever. He seems to be quite content pretending Lestrade does not exist, actually, no attempt made whatsoever to involve himself-- but--
as if he needed that assurance from
"John," Lestrade says softly, voice kept low to ensure they don't attract Sherlock's attention. He sounds uncomfortable at best, and is clearly unsure of what to say. "If you want me to hold off on the cases for a while--"
"Bee," Rosie parroted. She blinked up at Sherlock with big, bright eyes, almost as blue as Sherlock's, and thrust her bee into his lap.
"Went a lot quicker than I thought, with the movers," John goes on, conversational and casual. He plucks another bite of pork swimming in grains of rice. "Though I think some of the tabloids caught a few pictures and are now running headlines that Mary kicked me out because I was sleeping with you. Sorry about that." He's smiling, still, he's smiling and digging into Chinese takeaway, and he hands over a packet of sugar for Sherlock's tea. "I'd also apologise for leaving the flat a wreck, but you'd already took care of that all by yourself, so. More sugar?"
Also, he really likes the cake.
within my earshot."
But John at least did not seem worried, and that helped. It meant he did not think there was something to be worried about. "Well, why don't you open it and see?" He looked away under the pretense of sweeping up another armful of toys, but it really was a waste of time-- Sherlock could see him watching him out of the corner of his eye with every turn. "It's nothing bad, I promise."
He did look less distressed than before, but only just. And John still couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was
let your boys defile the scene, Gavin. There may be traces of evidence that will be impossible to restore..."
Francis smiles slightly. Perhaps something about this situation is
John fidgeted uncomfortably again, and said nothing.
So boring that I can only conclude they were unsolved because the original officers keeled over from lack of stimulation and died on the spot,
But Victor, after several long, utterly tedious moments, did not go away. He just stood there. He just stood right there in the doorway, undeterred by the rudest dismissal that Sherlock had been able to think up, and watched him with a look that he had never quite seen before. He did not care to categorise or define it.
"This is your scheduled dose. If you want to talk about skipping that dose, we can have that conversation in a few days. Right now, you're taking it."
Once again, Mycroft glances at him in that very Holmesian way, the way that makes it clear he thinks John is very, very stupid. "There are two dead bodies in a morgue, four others that my office is handling, and no answers between them, because my brother refuses to provide them. This case is not
And, if John allowed himself to be totally honest, Sherlock didn't have much reason to think that a relationship with him would go any better.
