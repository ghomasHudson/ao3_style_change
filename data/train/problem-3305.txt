"oh, my good boy... you feel so, so good..." Dean said to him, pushing his hips forward even harder, causing Cas to choke out. he slowly pulled out of Cas's mouth and let his cock rest on Cas's bottom lip. "D-Dean..." Cas' muttered out, sounding raspy and tired. "hmn..? what? speak up, baby boy." Dean said with a smirk, slowly sliding the tip of his cock along Cas's lip. "you can.. could make me bleed too, Dean.. I can just heal myself after so... please be as rough as you like... I promise I can handle it." Cas said, touching all over Dean's thighs in a desperate sort of way. "Jesus Cas.." Dean leaned down to grab Cas by the waist, pulling him up to his feet. "a-and you can kick me too... and punch me..." Cas said with a giddy little smile, he had obviously been thinking about this for a while. "is this what gets angels off?" Dean asked with a smirk, teasing him a bit. "sex is still new to me so.. I guess-" before Cas could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by a hard knee to the stomach, making him quickly wrap his arms around Dean as he hunched over in pain.
Sam and Eileen made their way to the garage, taking one of their spare cars since Baby was with Dean. "Are there any hunters around us? maybe we should ask for help." Sam nodded weakly. "Donna's around I think. please text her." Sam signed before pulling out of the garage, taking a right down the main road, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. all he could think was that they'd find Dean, dead on the side of the road. Sam fought back the horrible thoughts, he needed to keep himself together. Eileen took a deep breathe, also trying to keep it all together as she pulled out her phone to text Donna.
Dean kept his face close to Cas's, watching his face and every cute little scrunch of his nose he made, and every time his eyes rolled back in pleasure. Dean really did think he was beautiful. "you're doing so good.. you can do it, I've got you.." Dean whispered to him, thrusting deep inside of him to hit his prostate. Cas was sent way over the edge with that final thrust, with a reach of his arm around to grab at Dean's shoulder, spurts of cum shot out of him, covering his stomach and bedsheets. "A-Ahghhh! Dean.. Dean..!" Cas almost screamed out, his voice echoing through the bunker. Dean continued to thrust, his arms tightly wrapped around the angel, he pulled Cas into his lap, holding his hips down hard.
"Is this better Dean?" Castiel casually asked, his ass pressed close on Dean's lap after he had mojo-ed off his pants. "much better." Dean's hand didn't waste any time before grabbing onto Castiel's thigh, pulling him up a little. "you're really gorgeous Cas.." Dean pressed his lips against Cas' neck and began leaving light kisses all over. "you think I'm gorgeous?" Castiel began to relax against Dean's touch, his eyes falling closed. "course I do, I've just never-" he bit down a little on Castiel's neck, hearing a little gasp in return. "-been able to tell you before."
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas's wings flapped harder, sending cool air over Dean's face. "C-Cas just.. please.." Dean didn't know what he was really asking for, he just needed more. more of his angel, his gorgeous, angry, and lust-filled angel. "goodness Dean.. you enrage me.." Cas muttered before pushing his knee down even harder. "fuck C-Cas..!"
"Cas, tell me about your wings," Dean said in an almost demanding tone. "like what?"-"like why they keep popping up out of nowhere, and why I haven't gotten to see em before." Castiel's eyes shifted nervously, he didn't want Dean to think his angel habits were weird. "angels use their wings to attract or impress mates.. I just couldn't control it around you." Dean reached out and ran his fingers through his right wing, tugging lightly to see what would happen. arching his back slightly the angel moaned. "D-Dean ahhn..."
Castiel avoided eye contact and looked back at his eggs. "guess I'm just relaxed, sorry." Dean stood beside Castiel with an unamused face, feeling like he was being fucked with. little did the two know, Sam had been woken up from a combination of egg smell and yelling. he stood watching them, this just further proving his theory. before one of them could notice his stalking, Sam went back into his room to do some more research.
Dean pressed the knife up a bit harder, the blade pushing dangerously hard against Cas’ skin. “Don’t move. if you move, or moan, or make any sound.. I’ll push it harder. You got it..?” Dean whispered to him, using his other hand to reach down and unzip Cas’s pants. “Yes... I-I understand..” Cas uttered back, biting his lip to keep himself quiet as Dean began to slowly pump Cas's hard dick, Cas's hips bucked and twitched involuntarily. Dean pressed the blade more into Cas when he noticed his squirming. "what did I say...?" Dean said, his tone was taunting. Cas stayed quiet, trying to just focus on keeping his moans down, while Dean sped up his pumping. "D-Dean ugh.." Cas could barely keep himself quiet, Dean's thumb rubbing ever so slowly over his tip caused all his little moans and gasps to let loose. "pl-please Dean- U-Ughhh...!" Cas groaned out in pain as he felt the knife slide across his skin, leaving a shallow cut under his chin where blood slowly started to trickle down. "
"gotta be patient Cas, I don't wanna hurt you." Castiel groaned obviously getting irritated. "I'm an Ethereal being Dean, I doubt you could hurt me in this way." he gripped onto Dean's hair and wrapped his legs tightly around Dea's waist. "please..?" Dean couldn't say no to him even if he wanted to. "fine, fine you win, blackbird." Castiel ignored the nickname, too distracted by lust. Dean positioned his body with Castiel's, one hand on his hip and the other beside Castiel's head. "ready?" Castiel nodded, hands dug into his person's hair, Dean pushed into him. "D-Dean..!"
"fuck, fuck, fuck Cas!" Dean moaned out loudly as Castiel was on top of him, riding him as if he had done this before. "geez, how are you so good at this." Castiel had his hands on Dean's chest to keep himself steady, he was staring down at Dean, Clearly coming to the edge. "I-'m good at everything, Dean..." he mumbled, Dean giggling in return. "Dean I'm... I'm gonna cum..." his hands had begun to shake slightly against Dean's chest. "hmmm good." Dean lifted Castiel off of him and made him lie on his stomach, Castiel groaned at the sudden emptiness. "Dean what are yo-" suddenly Dean slammed back into him, grabbing him by the large wings that took over the room.
It was a moment before Dean could force the words out.
"Wait-"
But was he ready for that?
"I'm investigating the bar where the victim was last seen-"
"Looks like we've actually got decent digs for once." He remarked appreciatively, wasting no time in getting comfortable on the leather couch in front of a flat screen television.
"Hey, Cas. Look at me," The angel raised his head to meet Dean's gaze. "It's not a big deal. Shit happens, and this is new to you. No one is upset with you, or thinks that you're fragile."
But Dean wasn't so sure of himself as his eyes locked into Cas's bright blue ones, which had darkened with desire. The feel of his angel's warm skin beneath his fingertips was a sensation he didn't want to end.
"Yes Dean," Cas beckoned him over. "Come feel it."
"Not at all."
Dean didn't know why he got a weird feeling in his gut when picturing Cas using cheesy pickup lines on other people, but it wasn't pleasant.
"god I sound like I'm in a stupid chick-flick.." Castiel let his hands fall to Dean's waist, pressing his body into Dean's. "you love chick-flicks." Dean let out a little laugh before pressing his lips to Castiel's. all of Castiel's worries washed away as he kissed him, it was so soft and gentle. they moved their lips together, none of the heated passion from before, now it was just slow, and careful. full of love. Dean pulled away from the kiss, a small smile on his lips. "lets Finnish the pancakes, I'm hungry." Castiel went back to work with his batter while Dean started to heat up the pan.
after finally managing to wiggle out of Dean's sleeping grip, Castiel rummaged around in Dean's clothing drawers to find something to wear. he ended up picking out a pair of boxers and a black t-shirt. Once dressed he quietly walked out of the room to go to the kitchen. "once you're all done down there you should definitely come here and work a case with us, we all miss you." Sam was still on the phone with Charlie, having tuned out Dean and Cas, he didn't notice it stopped."uh, hi Sam. " Castiel said, taking Sam out of his conversation. Sam looked him up and down, seeing he was wearing Dean's clothes, and seeing his clearly messy after sex hair.
Cas kept his one hand on the back of Dean's head, making sure he stayed in place while he fucked into him. the other hand made its way down to Dean's cheek, Cas's thumb gently stroking over Dean's cheekbone as he moaned out little words of praise. "you're so beautiful, Dean.. everything about you.. I wish you could see just how perfect you were.." Cas's moaning got a little messier as he got closer to the edge, accidentally sprinkling a few words of Enochian in. Dean thought it was adorable, he did want to know what he was saying though. Cas's wings spread out wide, the tips of his wings seemed to shake and twitch frantically as his moaning grew louder. "
Cas smiled through the happy tears that stained his cheeks, watching Dean as he choked through his words. "Dean, it's okay now.. you're safe.." Cas cooed down to him, only earning more cries. The angel wrapped his wings around Dean's body, pulling him into a comftable embrace. once Dean was able to steady his breathing, he spoke up. "what are we suposed to do now, Cas.. not like we can really go home.." Cas frowned softly, holding Dean's head to his chest. "Jack is still building our heaven, we didnt expect you to arive so early." Dean laughed a bit, wiping his eyes of tears to relax into Cas's body. "but.. we can do anything we want, if you want me to stay with you-" "-yes.." Dean answered fairly quickly. "fair enough, well, we could just.. go home. Jack is building the bunker for us and.. if you want, we can stay there." Dean nodded, letting out a soft exhale. "can we do that.. i think i need to kiss you some more, think a bed would be more comftable.." a smile formed on Cas's face, his body curling around the human soul.
Sam gave him a smile, he could tell Castiel was serious about this. "don't worry man, I won't tell him." Sam paused for a moment before speaking again. "can I ask why? I mean I love Dean but he can be an ass. and How do angel relationships even work?" Castiel smiled a bit at the ass part. "its hard to explain my feelings for Dean. when I pulled him from Hell and saw his soul it was strange, I felt this intense emotion for him that wouldn't make any sense to humans, but the closest comparison I can make would be love." Sam nodded to himself. "sounds about right." he was a bit more hesitant to ask the next part.
"using your mouth can feel good right? its called oral if I remember correctly." Dean could feel his face heating up, Cas was about to give him a blowjob?? oh god, this was too much. "go ahead and try whatever you want Cas." he said, trying to sound calm. Castiel gave him a quick smile before moving down further, he put one hand on either of Dean's thighs and spread them apart gently. "tell me if I'm doing it right." Dean nodded, his hand found its way to Castiel's hair. He ran his fingers through the dark hair and watched carefully as his angel leaned down and took the head of his cock into his mouth. 'shit this is really happening' he thought to himself.
He started going on about how much I've changed him, he told me that because of me, he cared about you, and Jack, and the whole fucking world. Cas told me he made a deal (of fucking course he did) a deal to save Jack, it was for his life. apparently the empty would take him when he experienced a "moment of true happiness" Dude the way he looked at me, I was fuckin scared. Sammy, Cas told me that he loved me. man, he loved me. Cas's true moment of fucking happiness was saying that he loved me. I didn't even get to say shit back to him, the empty came and took him and Billie right after.
"the opposite actually, just didn't wanna cum yet."  Castiel nodded, his wings gently wrapping around the two of them. "are we gonna do the real thing now? I still don't quite grasp how to have intercourse. especially with two males." Dean placed a small kiss on Castiel's cheek. "I'll help you. But, to be honest, its gonna be a learning experience for us both since I've only been with women." Dean held on to Castiel's wings and rubbed the soft feathers that surrounded them. "but it can't be that complicated, we'll be fine." Castiel's wings flapped a little, blowing cool air over them. "what's first?"
"Dean, am I your boyfriend now? I not entirely sure how relationship labels work." Dean put some butter in the pan and let it melt, smiling up at Castiel. "yeah, you're my boyfriend. man, that's weird, an angel is my boyfriend." he grabbed the batter from Castiel and gave it some more mixing, making sure there were no clumps. "never thought this would be my life." Castiel leaned his head on Dean's shoulder and closed his eyes relaxing a little. "I could say the same thing, and I'm sure my brothers in heaven won't be too happy if they find out." Castiel is no way had plans to tell any of heaven's residence about him and Dean, but they would probably find out somehow.
"I don't care what those asshats think, and you shouldn't either. you aren't tied to heaven anymore so don't worry." Castiel watched as Dean began to pour the batter onto the hot pan, a hand gently holding onto Dean's arm. "you're right, but I still worry." he kissed the top of Cas' head. "I know." the two stayed there, finishing up the pancakes as the talked. And for the first time in a while, both of them felt calm. no monsters to fight, no end of the world to fix.
"oooh, what is it?" Dean was intrigued now, moving his lips off of Cas's neck to look up at him, face to face. "could you.. could you hurt me..?" Cas averted his gaze, placing his hands on Dean's chest to steady himself. "hurt you...? like, in a sexy way?" Dean said, a little grin forming on his lips. "yes I suppose.. i-it just seems enjoyable." he glanced back to see Dean's face, feeling a little relieved at his grin. "I could definitely do that for you, you're gonna have to be a lot more specific though." Dean rubbed Cas' hips gently, sensing Cas' nervousness. "like.. hitting me, slapping me.. just sort of being harsh in general.." he lowered his head down onto Dean's chest and closed his eyes. "you can just.. hurt me.. however you like." Dean ran a hand up Cas's back slowly, moving his hand up to grab a handful of Cas's hair and pulling hard, making him look at him. "like this baby boy...?" Cas gripped onto Dean's shirt and nodded, wincing slightly. "y-yes Dean.."
his heart skipped for a second, Dean was reminded of the mixtape he gave to Cas. 'wonder if it's still with him.. somehow.' he thought, staring out blankly at the road ahead as the music filled the car. the songs seemed to pass by slower than all the other times he'd listened to them, almost like his body knew it was the last music he'd hear. the gravity of Dean's situation started to hit, glancing down at the bag he had in the passengers' seat, Dean began to think of what he would do.
"Don't lie to make me feel better, lying doesn't help.." Cas mumbled against him, moving a little closer so he was sitting in Dean's lap. "I'm not lying you dumbass, it's true. all your cute cluelessness, your glowy eyes, your wings I can't exactly see, but know are there. I love it all. it's all perfect. everything about you is perfect." Dean said truthfully, watching down at Cas as he moved his head back to look up at him again, the blue glow now covering his eyes completely. "really...?" Dean nodded with a small smile, wrapping his arms around Cas's waist to pull him up into a kiss. the angel quickly kissed back, a wave of relief washing over him. "D-Dean..." Cas muttered against his lips. "would you please continue.." grinning softly, Dean pulled Cas down again, laying side by side. "course I will.."
y'know cuz I thought you were a demon or something.. but that's not the point. what I'm trying to say is I've sorta had eyes for you since day one, and when you opened your mouth and started talking I mean geez, you were adorable." Castiel smiled, remembering what it was like to meet Dean for the first time. "And just Cas... how could I not love you?" Dean stepped a little closer to his angel, Castiel put aside the pancake batter and moved in close as well.
I loved him too, Sammy. he said it was the one thing he knew he couldn't have, but he was wrong. what am I supposed to do? Cas is gone, but this time the last shit he said to me was that he loved me. I can't do it.
"um and Cas, so why have your wings been poofing up lately?" he asked. "you keep hitting him so obviously your not doing it on purpose." Castiel shifted a bit nervously in his seat. "when angels feel this kind of bond with another, we use our wings as a way to impress the other person. in this case Dean.."   Sam nodded. "kinda like birds?"-"no Sam not like birds, we were around before birds, birds are kinda like us." Castiel stated defensively. "but that's not the point since I'm not in Heaven where I can just have my wings out whenever I please, I've been suppressing the urge to-to show them to Dean." Castiel felt strange talking to Sam about these things
they had left for the case and arrived back to the bunker a few days later. suitably tired out, Dean went straight to his room to sleep for a year or so. Castiel went off to do some reading in his room, leaving Sam all alone in the bunker's library. alone with his thoughts, Sam got curious about the incident involving Cas' wings. What did happen? why did they just flare up like that? so he did what he did best. Research.
once the coat was off, Dean found it much easier to touch and grab at Cas's body, pulling him closer by the waist. A warm smile grew on Cas's face as he watched down at Dean. "you're so childlike.." he said, a bit of teasing in his voice. Dean responded by closing his eyes and pushing his head farther, taking in more of Cas with ease. "A-Ahh fuck..." Cas moaned out in a shaky sigh, quickly going back to thrusting in and out of his throat. under normal circumstances, Cas would never be this rough. but this was heaven, nothing could hurt either one of them here, especially not like this. grabbing more firmly at the back of Dean's head, Cas began to thrust harder, hitting the back of Dean's throat, and eventually going all the way down. Dean gagged and choked around Cas, though it didn't hurt at all, to his surprise.
"D-Dean!" Cas cried out, burying his face into Dean's shoulder. "you like that...?" Dean asked, worried that he may have actually hurt the angel. "yes.. g-ghhnn yes D-Dean please more..." Cas sounded absolutely in love, holding tightly to the fabric of Dean's shirt. "damn, alright then.." Dean held onto Cas' shoulders, sending another hard knee to his stomach, earning a loud moan from Cas in return. 'fuck Cas, you're really liking this shit?" Cas nodded quickly, shaking slightly in a mixture of pain and pleasure. "yes Dean.. I-I really am.. please keep going.." Dean felt himself getting harder and harder the more Cas spoke, even though he felt a bit guilty for being turned on by Cas' pain, he figured if Cas liked it, he could too. Dean reached down to pick up Cas by his waist, holding him up against the wall. "We're gonna need a safe word alright? I don't wanna accidentally break you." Dean said, half-joking and half being serious.
Dean got a little more confident when he heard Cas's praise, speeding up and sucking down a bit harder. Cas closed his eyes, his whole being felt like pure bliss. "Dean.. oh Dean.." he moaned out through soft whispers as his head slowly fell back. Cas's wings twitched and flapped as Dean continues, moving almost in sync with Dean's head bobbing. "D-Dean I'm close.. ahh-a-ahhh.." his moans were music to Dean's ears, his hands traveled up the sides of Cas's torso, pushing his shirt and coat up. Cas's wings flapped faster, harder, causing the blankets on the bed to get messy and misplaced. Dean shut his eyes tighter, knowing he was about to get a mouthful. "Dean.. Dean.. Dean..! o-oh Dean!" Cas's voice was deep and throaty, it made Dean shiver.
moaning and panting from both men filled the room, Dean's hands on Castiels wings, and Castiel's hot mouth swallowing up Dean's cock. "shit... Cas dont.. don't go too fast.." he could feel himself coming closer to the edge, and Castiel could tell. he started to move his head faster, taking in more of Dean to purposely overwhelm him. Dean had his eyes tightly shut, trying his hardest to hold back. as good as this felt, he knew he had to stay strong. "Mmngh..?" Castiel looked up to Dean after feeling a hard tug on his wings. "C'mere Cas." he pulled his mouth off of Dean and moved up to sit back on Dean's lap. "is something wrong with my technique?" he asked, wondering why Dean suddenly made him stop.
Dean's muffled moans just fueled Cas, his Wings flapping hard and heavy as he pushed his hips slightly more forward. Dean's hands found their way up to Cas's sides, slipping his fingers past his coat to hold his waist while Cas slowly thrust in and out of Dean's mouth. He would have thought something like this would hurt, but it didn't, not even a little. Dean felt butterflies in his stomach, the man he had been so hopelessly in love with was literally fucking into his mouth, this was Dean's greatest fantasy come true.
Eileen had already woken up by the time Sam got back, looking up to greet him, she stopped however when she saw the nervous look on his face. "you okay?" she signed, Sam shrugged and sat back down beside her, holding the note up for her to see. Eileen tilted her head, slowly taking it from his hand. "what is this?" Eileen signed, needing to know if it was alright for her to open. "I think Dean left it, he isn't in his room. it was at our door." Eileen could tell Sam was on edge, and in turn, she was too. "read it with me." Sam nodded and watched closely as she opened it up.
hehe finally real sex ;) kinda catfished yall with last chapters title but oh well
the two walked back inside of the bunker, Dean was sat on the couch watching whatever tv was on at the moment. "hey Sammy, Cas. how was your case?" Dean turned to look at them as they took their jackets off. "turned out to be a bust, at least we got some nice driving in." Sam said, lying through his teeth. "yes it was unsuccessful." Castiel walked over and sat down beside Dean on the couch without saying anything else. Dean gave Sam a little look but Sam didn't pay attention. "well I'm off to do some reading, have fun with your show." Sam walked off to his room, he knew Castiel was gonna try and talk to Dean, so he knew to give them some space.
Castiel stayed there with Dean. Since he was unable to sleep, he had some time to think. 'Dean said he loved me, was it true or was he just caught up in the moment?' it wasn't a nice thought, but the sleeping body in his arms grounded his mind. Dean was asleep, head resting on Castiel's chest and face looking completely relaxed. none of his usual Dean tension was present on his face, he seemed calm. Castiel could feel the calm radiating off of Dean's body, and it made him feel better. "Beautiful." Castiel said quietly, hoping he wouldn't wake him.
"Such a good boy.." Dean watched carefully as Cas pulled out his cock, already hard from the horrible thoughts he had been thinking. "perfect." he grabbed hold of Cas's hair again, forcing his head back against the wall. "now you just enjoy.." Dean thrust his hips forward, forcing his cock into Cas's mouth and down his throat. "Mnnhggh! nngh!" Cas struggled against Dean, holding tightly to his thighs as his throat was filled. "god you look so pretty like this.." Dean pulled out and thrust right back in, giving Cas almost no time to breathe. not that he needed to breathe anyway. Cas let his eyes roll back, loving the suffocating and burning feeling Dean caused him. Dean put a hand against the wall, steadying himself properly before starting to thrust into Cas's mouth at a steady pace, hitting the back of his throat each time. "mghhn... n-nghh mnn.." Cas let out small moans and whines at each of Dean's thrusts, choking on him every now and then.
"good Cas, good." Castiel met eyes with Dean briefly before closing them, he tightened his grip on Dean's thighs and bobbed his head down making Dean gasp. "oh w-wow Cas.." He pulled his mouth off of Dean's cock and licked up his shaft, stopping at the head and starting to gently suck. Dean was certainly impressed, for someone who hadn't ever done this before, it was going very well. "how is this feeling Dean?" Castiel said, his lips resting lightly against Dean's tip. "you're doing a great job that's for sure."  Dean sat up a bit and rubbed Castiel's cheek, giving him a non-verbal queue to continue. Castiel took it quickly and got back to work.
"Fuck Dean!" Castiel didn't normally swear, but this was a special occasion. Dean had a firm hold on Cas' wings, digging his fingers into the black feathers, he thrust in and out of the angel aggressively. Castiel was, if even possible, more in love. "Oh, please Dean m-more Dean I-I" He stuttered out as he came, cum staining his stomach and the blankets underneath him. Dean was close, he rested his head on Castiel's shoulder, his thrusts becoming a bit lazier and less constant. "why haven't we done this before.." he said in almost a whisper. "I love you, Cas.." Dean kissed Castiel's shoulder and thrust one last time before cumming, deep inside of his angel.
"y-yes Dean please continue.." Dean complied and pushed his finger in deeper, all the way to his knuckle. Castiel's wings involuntarily flapped hard at the strange feeling, accidentally knocking over some books on Dean's nightstand. "sorry..." Dean placed a kiss to his neck and hummed in a little happy tune. "don't worry about it Cas, just tell me if it hurts at all." he nodded, bracing himself for more. "D-Dean oh..." He moaned when he felt another finger being inserted. Castiel's normally deep and raspy voice had been reduced down to softer, quieter moans and pleads. "Dean I.. I think I see why humans are so consumed by sex it's.. so far at least it's wonderful."
“It’s okay, Dean.. I know you’d say that..” Cas said in a soft tone, his teeth lightly grazing across Dean’s neck, causing him to shiver slightly. “Y-yeah whatever..” Dean tugged a little on the back of Cas’s coat, making him pull away and look up face to face. “Can I uh.. Cas can I blow you..?” He asked, nervousness and embarrassment covering his face. “I just.. wanna make you feel good alright?” Cas felt his heart swell seeing Dean like this, hearing the words come out of his mouth. It really was heaven, wasn’t it? “Course you can, we have all the time we could ever want so.. let’s make use of it.” Dean felt a blush creep up in his cheeks, ‘all the time we could ever want, so let’s make use of it’ that went straight to his crotch. Dean nodded quickly and crawled down off of his lap, kneeling down in between Cas’s legs.
with a little flutter of his wings, Castiel's hips began to move on their own. the kissing and biting were too much for him and he needed more. more of this feeling that built up in his stomach and gradually moved upward making him feel dizzy. "Dean, shouldn't you take off something as well.." he spoke through heavy breath. "hmm pervert~" Dean teased, getting a somewhat confused look in return. "uh- never mind. would you be so kind as to help me out of my shirt?" Castiel nodded and in an instant, the shirt was gone. Castiel stared hard, stared at the devil's trap tattoo, and the hand mark he had left back when he saved Dean from Hell.
after Castiel clumsily confesses to Dean, the two are taken over by good old fashioned lust. the only problem being, Castiel isn't exactly sure what sex really is, luckily Dean is there to teach him.
"that sounds good.. i'll stay with you as long as you want.. I love you, Dean.." he spoke in a gentle voice, slowly touching a hand up and down Dean's back. "I love you too, Cas.. thank you.."
"of course I'll kiss you... I want nothing more in the world." he pulled Dean in, connecting their lips ever so gently. Dean immediately melted into the kiss, keeping one hand on Cas’s wing, and the other on his shoulder. “Dean.. do you know how.. how beautiful you are..?” Cas mumbled out against his lips, his hands found their way down to Dean’s lower back, holding him in place. “I.. I’m not sure about that.. Cas I..” - “you are.." Cas interrupted. "Absolutely the most beautiful human being..” Cas’s wings flapped lightly against the bed, holding him steady as he kissed from Dean’s lips down to his neck. “C-Cas I.. you really think so..? I-I don’t know, man..” he let his eyes close comfortably while he was kissed, continuing to touch all around Cas’s wings in a sort Of nervous fidgety way.
just now did it hit dean. 'Sammy is in the bunker, oh shit.' he leaned down and captured Castiel's lips in a kiss, trying to keep him a least a bit quieter. now that Castiels moans were being swallowed up by Dean's mouth, he went hard. slamming in and out of Castiel at a steady pace, he had the angel unraveling beneath him. feathers started to scatter around them as the bed shook, Dean really hoped Sam couldn't hear them. Castiel moaned out nonsense against Dean's lips, barely making out any proper words as he felt himself coming closer to the edge. since this was his first time, it's not very surprising he wouldn't be able to last.
"oh my God..." Sam sat at the table in the bunker, holding his head in his hands. Dean's attempt to shut Castiel up didn't work, not one bit, and Sam suffered for it. "I gotta tell someone, I mean this is just cruel." he said to himself as he reached for his phone, he dialed Charlie's number and waited for her to answer. "hey bitch." Charlie said casually. "Hey Charlie, how's it going in texas?" Sam asked, trying to tune out the Sex in the other room. "eh, kinda boring to be honest, there were a few vamps but I got them all so now I'm just hanging out at my hotel. how's your life going?" Sam groaned dramatically. "well Cas and Dean are fucking in Dean's room at the moment, and it's really loud."
'Eileen, we found Dean. he's in a barn not too far up the road, to the right. I don't know if Sam can see this, it's bad.'
"This feels wonderful.. please Dean I want more of it.." Dean got a giddy smile, he gripped tightly to Castiel's hip and slowly started to thrust in and out of his angel, drowning in the feeling of finally being with the person he's loved all this time. Castiel was certainly enjoying it as well, his wings were flapping along to each one of Dean's thrusts, again knocking over a few of Dean's things around the room. "Dean.. oh Dean I love you.. please more I can handle all of it just, please more.." Dean complied happily, sitting back up and propping himself on his knees he held both of Cas' legs up. "Dean! oh please!" Castiel moaned and out loudly as Dean began to thrust into him harder.
"Okay look, I'm no master chef but I can make eggs. now watch." Castiel watched carefully as Dean cracked the eggs into the pan, making sure to take mental notes on all the steps. when the eggs were done, Dean put them on a plate and smiled wide. "boom sunny side up eggs."  Castiel nodded his head and looked at  Dean with determination. "ill try now, is that alright?" Dean smiled and sat down at the table. "go right ahead, ill be right here so if you need help or set a fire or something, ill save ya."  Castiel smiled lightly at Dean's sarcasm and went to work.
"This is perfect, Cas. we can just like.. relax for once." Dean said, going to sit on the couch. Cas just nodded and followed him over, sitting down beside him. "what are we gonna do? we have so much free time." Dean wrapped an arm around him and pulled him into a half hug, keeping him close. "mmnhh.. anything I guess, we could watch movies, make food, just hang out... or..." he smirked and pressed a kiss to Cas' cheek. "have sexxxx~" Cas rolled his eyes and lightly smacked the arm around him. "of course you'd say that." Cas said with a small smile. "not my fault you're so hot, man. I can't help myself." Dean lay his back down on the couch and pulled Cas on top of him, holding onto his hips. "m-mmn Dean Uhm.." Cas muttered out as Dean began to kiss at his neck. "yeah...? what's up?" - "There is actually something I have in mind.. uh.. it may sound odd." he said, feeling quite nervous about Dean's reaction.
you're eyes got a little shine to em.. is that grace?" Cas nodded against the blankets, little gasps and whimpers leaving his lips. "yes.. y-yeah.." Cas's voice quieted down a little like he was embarrassed. "you just.. it feels very good.." he said, sounded ashamed. human things didn't often embarrass him, like being naked in front of people, dirty talk, and sex. Cas enjoyed it of course, but it didn't have as strong of an effect on him. Angel things, however, were one of the few topics that could make him feel truly vulnerable. especially around Dean. "oi, don't feel bad about that." Dean pulled the knife out of Cas's back and pressed the blade flat against his spine, leaning u to kiss at his shoulder. "I can tell you feel a little weird about your angel crap.. you know it doesn't bother me right?"
“Fucking hell.. C-Cas..” Dean stuffed his face into Cas’ back, blood getting onto his own chest. After a few more deep thrusts into his angel, Dean came as well, letting out a low groan, muffled by Cas’s back. The two stayed silent for a few minutes, just catching their breathes. “O-okay Cas.. you should probably fix yourself up.. Now..” he panted out, getting a little nod from Cas. he lifted himself off of Dean’s lap, laying down on his stomach with a small groan. “You good?” Dean asked him, looking around at all the blood that covered the sheets. It looked like a crime scene. “Yes, Dean.. I’m alright..” in an instant, all of Cas’s wounds were gone, the blood staining their bed disappearing too. Dean grinned. “Cmon pretty boy, lets go take a shower, I smell like a bloody porn star.” he laughed a bit, hoping out of bed to grab Cas’s hand.
"you wanna have sex? you sure Cas?" he nodded his head, now that he finally had Dean, Castiel wasn't gonna waste any time. "teach me how to do it, I'd like to learn." Dean couldn't believe how adorable this man was being. I mean 'teach me how to have sex?' was he trying to act like he was in a porno? Dean loved it. "if you really wanna learn then sure, I'll teach you Cas." Dean smirked a bit before capturing Castiel's lips in another quick kiss, lifting the angel off of him so he could stand up. "let's go into my room, I don't want Sammy seeing this." he gently took Dean's hand and followed him back to his room. once he door was locked, Dean moved closer to the angel.
finally, he woke himself up from his thoughts and stood up. gently tapping Castiel on the shoulder. "dude your wings." Cas turned around having been a little startled, he again smacked Dean with his wings, not as hard but still hitting him. "oh! Dean I-I'm sorry!" he instantly brought his wings back to himself, pressing them tightly against his back to keep them safe. "oh come on man not again...!" Dean said pressing a hand to his face where he got hit. "Cas what is with them?  is something wrong are you okay?" Castiel felt extremely embarrassed and nodded. "yes I'm fine Dean, really"
Castiel let out a shaky sigh as he felt Dean filling him up, the feeling was oddly calming to him. "Woah Cas..." Dean collapsed on top of Castiel and wrapped his arms around him. "how was that? did I do it correctly?" Castiel asked, turning around so he could face Dean. "you did better than correctly, that was amazing." Castiel smiled to himself, feeling very accomplished. his wings tucked away again, giving Castiel more room to lie properly on the bed. "are you tired, Dean? you can sleep if you'd like." Dean nodded, clearly very worn out. "yeah that'd be nice.." Castiel just stared down at Dean, observing his face as he slowly fell asleep.
while Castiel mixed the batter together, Dean leaned against the counter and watched. making sure he didn't mess it up or anything. "Dean, can I ask you something." Castiel turned his head to look at him for a moment. "yeah what's up?" he was silent for a moment, not wanting to ruin anything. "you said you loved me, is that true?" Dean was known for being terrible with emotions, and lovey-dovey stuff was definitely not his strong point. he glanced down at the floor briefly before meeting his eyes with Castiel's. he could see the worry building in Cas' eyes with every second Dean didn't respond.
-back to the horndogs-
"bye, guys! we'll be back in a few days so have fun!" Sam yelled down from the top of the stairs, leaving with Eileen for their little trip.
------------------
you should go follow us on tumblr cuz were funny and cool
Eileen slowly turned to Sam, signing with shaky hands. "Donna and Claire found him, Sam. a barn, farther up the road." Eileen set her hands back down in her lap, tears starting to roll down her face. Sam watched Eileen's face fall for a moment, speeding up the car. he didn't believe it, not until he saw Dean himself. Sam finally stopped the Barn up ahead, driving dangerously fast. He and Eileen watched with wide eyes as they drove past baby, a sick feeling began to build in Sam's gut. Sam drove a little further til he saw Donna's car, pulling up beside it and parking.
last chapter :) I really liked writing this though so ill probably start another story soon.
Dean let his head hang down, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. he loosened his grip on Cas's shoulder and hesitantly moved his hand upwards to cup the side of his cheek. Dean took a step closer and moved his head back up to look at Cas. "I love you, Cas.. c'mere.." Dean leaned in, pulling Cas into a gentle kiss. He tensed up slightly but was quick to kiss back. it was slow and lovely, just as he had imagined it to be for years. after a moment Cas pulled back, grabbing Dean's hand. "follow me..." he pulled Dean with him inside the barn, the sigils he and bobby spray painted were still there, covering all the walls. it was different though, it felt much more comforting than it had when they first stepped foot inside, a large bed was in the middle of it. the whole barn was absolutely beautiful, and Cas had made it specifically for him.
"Dean! uh hey.." was all sam came up with. leaving Dean to stare daggers into the two of them. "I'll ask again. Tell Dean what?" he was not amused.
-meanwhile-
placed in a bit of an awkward situation, Castiel and Dean find themselves alone, on the couch, wings out and all. Castiel fears he has ruined any chance he has with Dean. what will Dean think when he finds out the truth
"so Cas, I just wanted to ask you about your wings." Castiel became visibly uncomfortable at the mention of them, he knew Sam was smart and that he'd eventually figure it out. "I did a little research on angel wings and behavior. You know what it said?" Castiel avoided looking him in the eye. "...what..." he said, acting like a child that knew they were about to be in trouble. "it said angels use their wings to impress their mates. as in who they are interested in, as in De-" Castiel stopped him not wanting to hear what was about to come.
'Hey Sammy, I'm sure you're reading this early since you go for runs and shit, so I'm sorry this is how you'll be waking up. Tell Eileen I say sorry too. I should start off by telling you I wasn't completely truthful about what happened with Cas. y'know, when he and Billie were taken by the empty. There's no way I woulda been able to tell you this in person, so I guess this makes it a little easier. We were trapped man, Billie had us cornered and I thought we were toast, but then Cas got this fuck'in look on his face like he had an epiphany or something.
Dean held onto Cas's arms for stability, leaning his head gently against his lover's shoulder. "oh yeah...? what else do you wanna do with me, feathers?" Dean said with a small smirk, letting his hands find their way around to Cas's back, pulling up his shirt a little. "you know, Dean.." Cas started, pulling dean closer by his waist. "I can manipulate my form here in heaven, I could be anything I want, look however I'd like." Dean turned his head to the side, looking up at Cas's face curiously. "which is why I can do this..." Cas held onto Dean tighter, his wings stretching out wide behind him as they somehow grew larger. "W-Woah Cas what-" Dean was suddenly lifted off his feet, the hard flaps of Cas's wings took over the barn as they were flown up.
after Sam's suspicions were confirmed, he wants to know more about Cas' interest in Dean. a good long car ride seems to be a good place to talk.
dean reached over to put his and sams coffees down on the table, leaning more into Castiel's personal space. "u-um, so Sam when should we leave? it's still early so maybe we could get out now." Castiel was trying desperately to ignore the fact that Dean was now leaning an arm on him, but it was very much too close for comfort. "yeah, let's just leave after breakf-" Dean was interrupted by a hard smack to the face, sending him right on his ass. Castiels wings had manifested by themselves, being as large as they were, the raven-black wings had knocked right into Dean.
"don't tell Dean what?!" Dean yelled. "don't just stare at me like a couple of idiots what is it?" Castiel felt like he was going to die, how would Dean react if he knew? he'd probably be uncomfortable and it would ruin everything it was over it was all gonna be ruined. "er- me and Cas were just gonna check out a case by ourselves." Sam quickly said, filling the gap of awkward staring. "Cas?" Dean looked to him with a raised eyebrow. "yes Dean, sorry to keep it from you, we just thought you could use some rest." he lied. "well alright then, have fun on your 'case' " Dean walked away from them, obviously knowing something was up.
"Sam I-I'm sorry.." She looked back to him, her own tears starting up again when she heard Sam's sobs. She pulled Sam in closer, hugging onto him desperately to try and offer any amount of comfort she could bring. "I know baby... I know..." Donna spoke softly to him like a mother, letting Sam cry into her shoulder for as long as he needed. they stayed there, arm in arm, Sam wasn't sure if he could handle this.
Dean's eyelids felt heavy, his mind starting to fog up as the blood left his body. Dean leaned his temple into the barrel of the gun, moving his finger to hover over the trigger. "Ca-Cas, man.." tears rushed down his face. "I love you..." with those words leaving his mouth, Dean pulled the trigger. the gun slipped from his hand as his body went limp against the post, blood spatter covered the floor of the barn. it was dark, and quiet now, nothing but the gentle sound of blood dripping to the floor from the hole in Dean's head.
Castiel's wings flapped in a bit of a panic, he didn't know what to do. 'Damn' was all he could think, what did Dean mean by that? was he disgusted by him? did he hate him? he didn't know. But oh my was it nice to hear Dean talk about his wings like that, calling them big and strong. saying his wings were 'huge' made Castiel's mind go places he never thought his mind would go. "Dean I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to let them out." just as he was about to tuck his wings away again, Dean stopped him. "no wait, Cas stop it. be straight with me here man, what's wrong?" Castiel brought his eyes up to meet with Deans. the two were now close on the couch.
Sam got out of the car quickly, Eileen grabbed his hand as they walked up to the barn. Claire was outside, doubled over against the wall of the barn with her hands on her stomach. she was bawling uncontrollably, gasping for air. Eileen let go of Sam's hand and rushed up to her, wrapping her arms around the smaller girl. "D-Don't go inside- please, ju-just don't," Claire said out through sobs, clinging tightly to Eileen. Sam scrunched his nose up, looking to Eileen with absolute fear in his eyes. She just nodded softly, knowing nothing would stop Sam from going in.
"I smell burning Cas, what are you doing?" Dean walked up to Castiel and peeked over his shoulder at the mess of what looked to be burnt scrambled eggs. "hello Dean, I'm sorry I was just trying to make you and Sam food."  he said, sounding defeated. "at one in the morning?" Dean sat himself up on the counter beside Castiel.
"Oh come on, you and Sam obviously lied about going on that case, and that thing with your wings randomly appearing it's all weird. just tell me what going on." Castiel kept his eyes on the ground, he knew Dean was gonna get the info out of him at some point. "Dean it's really no-" Dean grabbed his arm lightly and made Castiel look him in the face. "Cas just tell me." he was too close, Dean was so close to him and he had a tight grip on his arm, this was a dangerous situation. "I-I uhm- Dean what do you think of my wings?" Castiel stuttered out, this being the only thing he could think to say "your wings?”
"you like what you see, angel?" Dean said in a joking tone. "yes." Castiel quickly responded, his hands ran up Dean's side. "Dean you are very beautiful, your soul as well." he cocked his head slightly. "my soul? what do you mean Cas?" Castiel softly placed a hand on Dean's cheek, looking him in the eye. "when I took you from Hell, and I saw your soul it was just.." he trailed off a bit leaning in closer. "beautiful.." this time it was Cas' turn to be a bit forceful, crashing their lips together in a heated kiss, wings raised and big. Dean had a firm hold on Castiel's hips, he pulled Castiel down on top of him as their kiss heated up even more.
"D-Deeper, Dean please!" Cas cried out, moving his hips back and forth to match Dean's thrusts. "my dick, or the knife?" - "F-Fucking both!" Dean grinned at the aggression in Cas's voice, doing as he was told and pushing his hips further to get deep inside of him. "T-Thank.. Thank you..." Cas felt pleasure wash over him as the knife was pushed in deeper, causing blood to pour out all over his back and the bedsheets. he'd have to miracle that away after. "you know..." Dean grunted out, keeping the knife still inside of Cas's wound. "as fucked up as this is, you look really hot.." Cas turned to look back at Dean, his eyes had a thin cover of his angelic grace covering the normal human blue. "I'm glad you find me hot.." he said, fairly matter-of-factly. Dean smirked, pushing the knife in deep along with his thrust, Cas's immediately stuffed his face back into the bed with a loud moan."
when the two are finally in bed together Castiel is eager to get to the good part, but can he take it?
"I love you."
slowly, Castiel shed the coat, letting it fall to the floor behind him. "done. what else?" Dean reached out and unbuttoned the first button on Cas' shirt. "were gonna take it slow since this is your first time, so let's just lose the shirt." Castiel nodded and finished unbuttoning the rest of his shirt, he let that fall as well. once Castiel was shirtless Dean grabbed him by the waist and pulled him in so that their chests were close.

Dean stayed there for the entire night, sat up against the wall with his knees to his chest. eventually falling asleep after hours of crying and begging for Cas to come back, obviously to no avail. he awoke late into the next day, around three pm, but it didn't matter. Dean lifted himself off the ground, looking around the room to confirm that what he remembered from last night indeed did happen. He stayed there, lingering for a few minutes just to think of what he could possibly do next. "Sammy.." he muttered to himself, looking back down at his phone that had stayed untouched the whole night. 'he's probably worried..' Dean thought. He glanced over at his arm where Cas had grabbed him, the bloody handprint still there, mimicking their first touch.
"That was pretty close. sorry, Cas." Castiel let out a sigh, relaxing his tensed up shoulders. "now we have a fake case to work on, why don't we just go for a ride in the car and say we found nothing." Castiel nodded and followed Sam out of the bunker.  Castiel was quiet for a while, Sam thought it would be nice to give him at least an hour of driving before he'd ask about the obvious. so an hour into their pointless drive, Sam turned to look at Castiel. "so Cas, you're into Dean?" Castiel reluctantly met his eyes with Sam. "yes, please don't tell him."
it had been a good long while since Castiel fully moved into the bunker with Sam and Dean. he was liking it a lot, being closer with the two hunters was what made him happy and finally living with them felt like a huge sigh of relief. he felt safe and grateful and all the good emotions he longed for. but these weren't the only things he was feeling, Castiel knew good and well he had more intense emotions toward the older Winchester, and they were sort of starting to show.
'wise words from someone who was currently holding on to Dean for dear life as he felt himself being penetrated. "D-Dean..!" Castiel's wings stiffened at the unusual feeling. "you okay Cas? we can go slower if you need." Castiel shook his head, refusing to believe this might be something he needs to take slow. "I'm fine Dean.. please keep going..." Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's cheek, keeping him close as he thrust in further. Castiel was taken over by this new feeling, being this close to Dean was strange, but wonderful. he wanted more of it, so he tightened his legs around Dean's waist and moved his hips into him. "shit Cas.. you alright?" Dea asked, now buried deep inside the angel.
Dean leaned in and gently kissed Castiel's jaw, squirting a small amount of lube on his fingers he reached down and pressed his slicked up fingers to Castiel's entrance. Castiel flinched slightly, his wings going stiff. "s-sorry, it's just cold.." he muttered. "yeah, sorry about that." Dean slowly pushed his middle finger inside of his angel, being very aware that Castiel was new to this stuff. Castiel let out a faint gasp, he wrapped his arms tightly around Dean's head and let his wings engulf them.  "you alright Cas?" Dean said, his face pressed into the crook of Cas' neck from the strong hug Castiel had released on him.
"I certainly want." instead of Castiel getting up to take off his pants like what Dean expected, Castiel decided that would take too long. so without any warning, Castiel's pants were gone. still sitting snugly on Dean's lap he was almost completely naked.
"First, we need lube." Dean gently lifted Castiel off of his lap so he could stand up, he walked over to his drawer and got out a little bottle of lube. "here we go~" Dean walked back over and sat on the bed. "lie down on your back for me Cas, and spread your legs." Castiel did as he was told and lay himself comfortably on the bed, legs spread wide. "perfect, now this next part is gonna feel weird. You good to continue?" Dean crawled over to Castiel and got in between his legs, chest to chest. "yes Dean, I trust you know what you're doing."
”Ca-Cas what-“ There wasn’t a second more for him to even try and hug back before he was pushed down, hitting the wall of the bunker with a thud. A black oozing mess spilled out of the wall from nothingness, Dean’s panicked eyes darted from the ooze, to Cas, then to the door where Billie finally broke through. the empty grabbed Billie, pulling her apart in an instant, and taking her away. Cas was next, and all Dean could do was sit against the cold stone wall and watch. as the empty reached out for Cas, his face was soft. He was calm, for once in his millions of years of life Cas was happy. A deep exhale left his lungs, glancing down at Dean one last time before he was taken away.
Dean stuffed his face into the pillow he held onto, his legs tensing and un-tensing as Cas bobbed his head up and down, kissing and sucking at Dean's tip every time he moved his head back up. Cas was way too good at this, Dean felt like he could cum just from his kisses alone, and really, he could. this was his heaven, he didn't have to worry about lasting long or impressing anyone, this was Cas. everything was safe and perfect, and oh God did it feel amazing when Cas pushed his head all the way down till his nose touched Dean's belly. "Ah-Ahh-Cas! Cas!" Dean arched his back out beautifully as he came, filling Cas's throat with his hot cum. Cas kept his head still for a moment, slowly pulling off with a wet pop as Dean calmed himself from his orgasm. "J-Jesus fucking Christ.. shit.. Cas why... why're you so good at that..."
the two drove around for a while, Donna agreed to help look, Claire was with her as well. they driving down every exit they came across in case Dean had taken any turns, Sam needed to be thorough. Donna texted again, Eileen's heart stopped.
"Dean what should I do now? should I kiss you more?" Castiel's wings were now resting behind him, slightly wrapped around the two of them in a protective way. "I wouldn't mind that." Dean's one hand slid up Cas' back to find the base of his wing, while the other stayed and hovered around Castiel's lower half. the two began to kiss again, this time Dean decided to be a bit more aggressive, pushing his tongue into the angel's mouth with light force. without breaking the kiss, Dean moved them over to his bed. letting Castiel sit back on his lap like before. he could feel himself getting hard under his jeans, but Dean wanted to take this slow.
"What's that...?" Cas asked, holding onto Dean's shoulders for support, his legs tightly wrapped around Dean's waist. "just.. a word, that if you say it ill stop. as soon as you say it, anything I'm doing will stop. that way you're always in control." Cas nodded, pressing his cheek into Dean's shoulder. "okay... how about uh.. honey bee..?" Dean smiled wide, thinking it was very cute. "that sounds perfect." Dean moved off the wall with Cas still in his arms, placing him down on the edge of the bed. "I also gotta know exactly how far you wanna go, even though we have a safe word I don't want you to have to use it, alright?" Cas thought for a moment, glancing down in a bit of a nervous way. he was debating on whether or not he should really tell Dean, not wanting him to get freaked out. eventually, he just chose to go for it. "I mean.. really you could slit my throat and it wouldn't kill me.. as long as you don't use an angel blade.." Cas said in a low voice, a heavy blush covering his face. "I wouldn't mind that sort of stuff.."
Sam put a hand on Castel's shoulder before standing up. "I'm gonna go take a shower." he smiled down at him. "you two will be fine." Castiel nodded. maybe Sam was right, he could feel the good calm emotions radiating off of Dean when they were in bed together, it felt real and it felt warm. a small smiled formed on Castiel's, remembering their time in the kitchen when Dean helped him make eggs. it was a good little memory. maybe they would be okay. "feathery bastard, you left me." Castiel turned his head to see Dean walking up to him with a smile. "uh, sorry Dean. just wanted to let you sleep." he wrapped an arm around the angel from behind, giving him a little hug of sorts.
Dean got into his car, he gripped the steering wheel tightly, his head slowly sinking down until his forehead rested against his hands. "m'sorry man... really.." he muttered out in a low whisper, eventually he managed to pull himself together again, pulling out of their driveway. the drive was quiet at first, Dean's hands never leaving the steering wheel. soon enough, he eased up. Realizing this was his last drive in Baby, he decided some music was in order. with a somewhat shaky hand, Dean reached over to grab out some music.
He hung his head down, a nervous and sad laugh leaving his lips. Dean knew what he had to do, or more so what he needed to do, it was disgusting and selfish and it would disappoint his Angel more than anything he had ever done before in his life. but he didn't care. Dean shook the thoughts from his head, he needed to first find Sam and Jack, and deal with God. he had to finish this, one more mission.
Dean's mouth hung open against his angel's shoulder, he gasped and moaned and whined while he was fucked senseless into the barn wall. "that's it.. let it all out.." Cas cooed, his words gentle despite his hard thrusts. "Cas! fuck, I lo-love you.. N-Nghh! please Cas, pl-ease!" Dean's moans were strained, desperate, and pathetic. Cas thought he couldn't be more beautiful than he was at the moment. He already understood what Dean was begging for, Cas didn't need it to be explicitly said. "come here.." Cas spoke softly as he leaned in to kiss and bite on dean's neck, earning more and more moans from his hunter. "Cas I-I'm sorry I never.. A-Ahgh! N-Never said anything before... I should have told you how-how much I loved you.."
Cas watched with soft eyes as Dean placed small kisses all over, it was so cute. So gentle and sweet, Cas adored this. “Does this.. does it feel any good, man..?” Dean asked, glancing up at him for a moment. Cas gave him a little nod, resting back on one hand. “It does.. but.. why don’t you try this..” Cas gently gripped Dean’s hair, reaching his other hand down to hold his chin. “Open your mouth..” he said in a soft tone. Dean was quick to do as told. Opening his mouth up for Cas, his head was slowly guided down onto Cas’s dick. “Just like that..” Cas didn’t put any force on Dean’s head, only soft gentle guidance. Dean slowly closed his eyes as he moved his head further down, eventually bobbing his head in a slow but steady rhythm. "Dean.. y-you feel absolutely wonderful.." Cas spoke softly to him, sprinkling small compliments over him as he worked.
"firstly, id like this off." Dean gently pulled at the coat that always covered Castiel. seriously 'why does he never take this thing off?' Dean thought, but that's beside the point.
"m-mmnh... Dean.." Castiel mumbled against Dean's lips. Castiel's hands were tightly wrapped around Dean's body holding him impossibly close. Dean pulled away from the kiss slowly, terrified of what he just did. "sorry..." Dean said. he really didn't know what to expect, but Castiel had kissed back which gave him some hope. "please do that again Dean." Dean bit his lip, excitement taking over his body he put a hand to the back of Castiel's head and pulled him back in. Castiel leaned his body closer to Dean making him fall a bit into him. without really thinking, dean brought a hand up Cas' back and grabbed onto the base of his left wing.
"Cas.." Dean began to pray. "..I don't know if you can hear me, man.. but if you can just... I'm sorry. Cas, I'm sorry for what happened, I'm sorry I didn't say it back, a-and I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.." he said, voice beginning to get unsure and shaky. "I know you would be disappointed.. I know it. I just can't do it alright...? it's too much.. fuck, Cas I can't do this without you..." Dean felt hot tears stream down his face, it was the first time being able to cry since Cas had left him weeks before. "Man I should've protected you back there.. I-I should've been able to keep you safe.." Dean reached his hand into the bag he brought, grabbing whatever he touched first, he pulled out one of the hunting knives.
Cas ignored him, instead just hugging on tighter as he cried quietly. "C-Cas, man can you hear me?" Dean spoke shakily, reaching a hand up to grab at the angel's arm as he turned himself around to face Cas. "Dean, why would you do this..." Cas finally spoke, his voice laced with disappointment. "Cas I-" - "you shouldn't have done this, Dean.. it wasn't worth it..." Cas interrupted him, clearly very upset, Dean looked over his face for a moment, not knowing what to say. "Am I in heaven...? a-are we in heaven?" Dean moved his eyes from Cas's face to the space around them, it was nothing but hazy light for as far as he could see. "Yes.. we are." Cas finally made eye contact with Dean, bringing a hand up to hold the side of his face.
He grabbed the remote from the coffee table and began flipping through channels.
He headed for the liquor cabinet.
"I think I'd like to give it a try sometime." Cas remarked thoughtfully. Dean was startled.
from heaven, Dean. I leapt towards you."
There was a click, and Sam was gone.
The next morning, Dean was preoccupied with his cereal when he felt hands rest on his shoulders from behind. Cas brought his head close to Dean's ear, so he could feel his angel's breath on his face.
"You lonely, handsome?" She asked flirtatiously, batting her eyelashes. Dean offered her a tight smile.
At least, not when it came to Dean.
Dean offered him a smirk, trying to conceal his worry.
"There are twenty six letters in the alphabet, but I only need six of them; U, R, A, Q, T." Dean told Cas with a grin.
She grinned, leaning forward across the table, no doubt to show off more of her cleavage beneath the tight black minidress she was wearing.
There was doubt in his tone now, and Dean knew that Cas had caved.
Before he could change his mind, Dean grabbed Cas by his trench coat, leaned down, and pressed his lips to his.
"Then you're in luck, honey. I've got a lot of things to do tonight, and you've just made my list." The girl winked, placing her hand over his.
In that moment, it suddenly made sense. Cas wanted to heal his heart, and was doing it in the way Dean had taught him.
He watched as a slow smile stretched across his angel's face.
Cas sucked in a breath as Dean's hands came into contact with his bare skin and his fingers hooked themselves on the hem of his slacks.
"I'd also pull off your tie."
"But that's not it," Dean interrupted him. "At least, not all of it."
"Are you alright?"
"You think it's easy?" Came a voice. Dean spun around to find Cas standing by the window of the motel room, gazing out into the storm that had begun to swirl outside.
Cas seemed to be at a loss for words for a moment, before finally clearing his throat.
That afternoon, Dean emerged from his room with a plan and the determination to carry it out. As expected, Cas was standing by the door, having just returned from the store.
Hey guys, welcome to the story! This is a two-part piece inspired by a tumblr prompt, where in part one Dean introduces Cas to the concept of kissing it better as the angel adjusts to being human. In part two, Cas uses his newfound knowledge to help Dean with his own wounds.
"Dean, I've been thinking about something."
Dean raised his head slowly.
Then he leaned down and pressed a kiss to Dean's chest… right over his heart.
"You think I don't want to run to you?" The angel turned to face him, and Dean was struck by the sorrow and desperation on his face. Cas was hardly one for displaying emotion, so this level of expression was rare. "There are mountains, Dean. Doors that we can't walk through."
"Cas, I-"
to you."
"Last time I checked, the ones I was supplying him with were less cheesy and more… well, I'm sure you know."
Dean collapsed in the driver's seat, barely mustering the strength to slam the Impala door shut behind him. The job had been tough, but they'd made it. All he wanted right now was some sleep… and maybe some pie. He didn't open his eyes as he heard the passenger door open and close.
"Yes, I get the idea. Is it one you're willing to turn into a reality?" Cas asked him in a low voice, moving his hands from his sides to Dean's hips, fingers curling around the belt loops of Dean's jeans and pulling him forward until there was practically no space between them.
"You know, Dean, 75% of the human body is water… and I'm
But Dean loved it.
"So let me fly with you," Dean cut him off, slipping his hands onto the angel's waist and pulling him close. "Or you can fall with me."
But Dean had frozen. Her hands on his skin felt so wrong. At the moment, he could only think of one thing;
Dean stared at his empty glass. He'd needed a distraction from his mixed feelings, but beer just wasn't doing it for him.
Cas placed a hand on his shoulder, lowering his head to meet the dejected hunter's gaze. Dean found himself unable to look away as green eyes met beautiful blue ones, filled with compassion.
Dean brought his free hand up to his face, cupping it gently as he leaned in for a kiss… only for the angel to vanish from his arms.
Hey, welcome back! As promised, here's part two of Kiss It Better! Cas will use the knowledge he gained last chapter to help Dean with a wound of his own.
He stood from his chair, crossing the room in a few quick strides. Before he had stopped to consider his actions, he was standing in right in front of Cas.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm good," Dean assured him quickly, brushing off the angel's concerns. He felt a bit of disappointment when Cas's hand dropped from his shoulder. "How about you? Any injuries?"
The hunter smiled.
He could practically feel Sammy grinning on the other end.
Of course, Dean had no intention of letting go.
Cas hesitated a moment before lifting up a singular finger. Dean could just make out a thin line of blood trailing from a cut. Dean snorted.
"So," The hunter prompted him. "What's stopping you?"
"So what?" Dean scoffed. He took another step closer. "You think that it's fate that makes things keep going to pieces? That fate is keeping you from me?"
Shutting the door to his room, Dean leaned back against it. He found that his heart was pounding in his chest and there were butterflies in his stomach.
"Come on, man, that's not-"
But today, Dean found himself willing to be a bit more vulnerable than before.
There was a moment of quiet before Castiel spoke again, voice soft.
"There, all done."
"Hello, Dean." Cas greeted him.
"Dean."
"Huh," Was all he said. Now that Cas had mentioned it, Dean could feel the weight of his own tongue in his mouth. "And how did you come to this world-altering realization, exactly?"
"Cas?" Dean prompted him. The angel looked up, meeting Dean's gaze with his own.
His eyes scanned the room, falling on a pretty young blonde sitting alone at the bar.
Cas paused a moment, staring at Dean's outstretched hand long enough to make the hunter begin to feel like an idiot. Then, he slowly slipped his hand into Dean's, fingers carefully intertwining with his own in a way that had him inhaling sharply. Pure blue eyes met his, and Dean had to tear his gaze away, clearing his throat.
"Care to elaborate?" Dean asked impatiently.
Dean spared him a quick glance. His angel's expression was dead serious.
Dean crossed the room in a few quick strides.
Dean was beginning to get frustrated.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Cas prompted him gently.
His attention snapped back to the present as Cas began removing his trench coat.
Cas glanced up as Dean barged into the room. He was lying on the couch, feet propped up on the coffee table. It was still so strange for Dean to see his angel in such a casual position, but that wasn't really his focus right now.
Dean raised an eyebrow.
"Boyfriend material, of course."
"...He asked me if it hurt when I fell from heaven." Cas mumbled.
. It was so much harder to concentrate now that Cas was right in front of him. He took a deep breath, stepping forward until he was mere inches from Cas. He forced himself to lock eyes with his angel.
you were. Say that you made meant to be mine. Then nothing could keep us apart." Dean gently took one of the angel's hands in his own, bringing it up to where they both knew his handprint was imprinted on the hunter beneath his clothes. "I'm the one you were meant to find, Cas."
"Dean…" Cas sounded tired as he turned back towards him, and the reluctance was evident in his features. But the hunter had his attention, and that's what he had wanted.
"It doesn't feel like anything special," Dean said gruffly. "What's it made of?"
For Dean, that was the final straw. He grabbed Cas by the trench coat, yanking him away from the door and pushing him against the wall. He tilted his angel's chin up with a finger, forcing him to meet his gaze.
He pushed his head down as much as he could manage as his throat was filled, tightening his grip on Cas's waist. After a moment, Dean pulled his mouth off with a little pop, his cheeks flushed as he looked up at Cas's flustered face. "was.. was that good Cas...?" he asked, eyelids heavy as he rested his chin in Cas's knee. "you were perfect.." the hard flaps of his wings had come to a gentle stop, only for a moment, however. Cas soon grabbed Dean by his shoulders, pulling him up back into his lap with what could only be described as angelic strength. Dean tensed up for a moment at the sudden movement "mmn- Cas what- Ooh..." Dean relaxed as soon as he felt the lips on his neck, letting his arms loosely hang around Cas's neck.
this is only the first chapter, the next one is gonna get really kinky and smutty and nasty so get ready >;)
Dean clung to him, his face buried against Cas's shoulder. "Dean it's alright.. I never expected you to say anything. you don't have to worry about that" - "Cas stop! o-of course I love you, man. how could I not?" Dean pulled back to hold Cas's shoulders, looking at him with a frustrated and sad expression. "I.. I didn't know what to do when you told me all that stuff back at the bunker.. I didn't even think you could have loved me like that.. man why'd you have to wait so long to tell me...?" Cas just frowned, watching over Dean's face. "Dean I.. I was certain you would never think of me that way, I thought that if I told you.. you'd have hated me. I was much more content with just being quiet about it, that way I could still have you in some way.."
this chapter is gonna be a bit longer than the others, also sorry it took kinda long to post. schoolwork flooded in all at once so I had to focus on that.
Cas felt tears well up in the corners of his eyes as Dean began to really thrust, all the way out, and all the way back in. with no prep, this was basically torture, but that's exactly what Cas wanted. "C-Cas, you want me to cut you or something?" Dean asked, leaning his head down to kiss at his angel's back. "Y-Yes Dean p-please... please..." Cas practically begged, squeezing his eyes shut tight. Dean smiled against his exposed skin a little, reaching over to grab one of the knives while thrusting particularly deep inside of Cas. "A-Ahhhgh Dean... D-Dean- Dean!!" Cas's eyes shot back open when he felt the cold knife slice into his lower back, cutting slowly at his skin. "Fuck- Fuck! Dean Ahghh!!" the Angel's moans echoed through the bunker, he sounded like he was being tortured, which wasn't entirely inaccurate.
Dean hadn't even noticed the little spurts of cum shooting out of him, covering his and Cas's stomachs. His mind was too cloudy, too much pleasure and emotion flowing through him to even try and begin to think straight. Cas pushed off of the barn wall with the hand he had been using to steady himself, keeping him and Dean in mid-air for a moment before landing back on the bed with a little thud. Cas didn't give Dean even a second to adjust before pushing him down on the bed, face pressed into the pillows, Cas was slamming inside of him again. "Ca-Caaas!! ughhh-Aah-Ahggh!!" his moans beginning to sound like strained cries, a sound Dean never thought he would ever make. his stomach felt hot, almost burning as Cas filled him with cum, more grace than before completely overcome his body and mind.
She had one hand on the right side of Dean's face, the other was covered in blood and brain matter, he was barely recognizable from the left. "I'm sorry, Sam..." Donna whispered, her voice sounded like she could break at any moment, this was the absolute worst outcome Sam could think of. He eventually pushed himself to walk closer, kneeling down on the floor beside Donna as he looked over Dean, the tears finally slipping. "Dean...." Sam's breath quickly sped up, becoming erratic when he noticed the slit wrists. "D-Dean oh god, Dean!" Donna took his hand in hers, squeezing tight.
Dean kneeled down in front of Cas, putting his hands on his knees. "you really wanna go that far huh...? are you sure?" Dean asked, giving Cas's thigh a gentle caress. "I'm very sure, I-I just find pain very.... pleasurable.. I know it's strange uhm.. sorry.." Cas stared down at his lap, the embarrassment taking over him. "oh you cute bastard.." Dean laughed a little and put a hand to Cas's chest, pushing him down onto his back and moving on top of him. "don't apologize dumbass, if you like it, then I'll do it." Dean moved his knee in between cas' legs, pressing into Cas's crotch hard. "D-Dean oh.." Cas moaned out nervously, squeezing his thighs together against Dean's knee. "now.. what I need you to do, is go get me some things I can use on you, okay? any knives, ropes, or tools you want. got it?" Cas nodded, sitting up when Dean lifted his knee and let him go. "I'll be back in a moment." Cas gave Dean one more glance before hurrying out of their room, going to their weapons collection.
the angel didn't speak for some moments, his wings falling to eithre side of the two in the vast plane of light. soon, Cas moved one hand behind Dean's head, brushing a thumb across his hair. "Dean.. please look at me." Cas spoke, two green glossy eyes finally looking up to meet Cas's. before Dean could start crying he was pulled in close, head being craddled as his angel kissed him. Dean immediatly burst into tears, wrapping both arms tightly around Cas's body so he could never slip away. the two stayed like that for what felt like years, neither one needed to breathe anymore, so it might as well have been actual years. when Dean finally pulled away he pressed his forehead into Cas's, never wanting to let him go. "I love you, cas.. I love you so so much its stupid.."
Cas's wings flapped harder, sending cool air over Dean's face. "C-Cas just.. please.." Dean didn't know what he was really asking for, he just needed more. more of his angel, his gorgeous, angry, and lust-filled angel. "goodness Dean.. you enrage me.." Cas muttered before pushing his knee down even harder. "fuck C-Cas..!"
"I'm gonna make pancakes, and you're gonna help." Dean walked off to the kitchen, Castiel following close behind. "Dean I don't know how to make pancakes." Dean ignored him. instead, Dean grabbed onto Castiel's arm and pulled him to his side. "I'll teach you, you learned to make eggs, and pancakes aren't that much harder." Castiel walked with him into the kitchen. "alright Dean." he leaned against the counter, watching Dean get out the pancake mix and eggs and such.
"hmm, good boy." Dean let go of Cas's hair and pushed him off of himself, standing up and holding his hand out. "c'mon, let's go to our room." Cas quickly grabbed his hand and walked with him, nervously thinking of all the things Dean might do. as soon as they got into their room, Dean shut the door, turning to grab Cas by the neck and swiftly slamming him into the wall. "n-Ngh...! De-ean.." Cas held onto Dean's wrist, arching his back a little against the wall. "this is what you want right? you want me to be mean.." Cas nodded, struggling to breathe slightly as Dean's grip tightened. "yes.. y-you can be as mean a-and as violent as you want.." Dean got a bit excited when he heard that, biting his lip a little as he thought of what to do. "alright, let's see how much you can take then." he kept hold of Cas by his throat, forcing him down to his knees. "unzip my pants for me, would you? and open your mouth." Cas did as he was told, reaching to unzip Dean's pants.
Dean's cheeks started to get a little red. his mind wandered back to when they were alone in the kitchen."your wings are uh.. big I guess, and pretty strong since they were able to knock me on my ass." he laughed a bit. "you think they're big?" Castiel couldn't even try to hide the look on his face. a mixture of embarrassment and lust covered his eyes. "yeah Cas they're huge." that was it before either of them could say anything else Castiel's wings manifested themselves once again. "shit Cas!" Dean was taken a bit back by this, he stared up at the gorgeous wings in front of him. "Damn.."
after sam makes a discovery about angels and their mating habits, he confronts Castiel. meanwhile, the chaos of Cas' wings continues.
Sam was the first to wake up, as usual. he placed a gentle kiss on Eileen's sleeping face before getting himself out of bed, putting on a pair of his sweatpants and a shirt. Sam was halfway out the door when he noticed the note Dean had left. he immediately felt something might be wrong, picking up the note and walking over to Dean's room before opening it. Sam walked up to Dean's door, knocking a few times. when there was no answer he grabbed the handle and opened it, staring into the empty room. Dean's bed was made. he knew something was wrong now. Sam grasped the note tight and walked back to his room, he needed Eileen to be with him for whatever this was.
------------------
"Cas... C-Cas oh God I lo-love you..." Dean slumped down into the bed, silent sobs escaping his lips while Cas eventually slowed his thrusts. "do you feel it, Dean...? do you feel me...?" Cas whispered to him, keeping his thrusts at a gentle and slow pace, letting Dean take a moment to gather himself. "Yeah, I... I do.." he mumbled back to him, shifting his hips slightly when he felt the hot cum trickle down his inner thigh. "Mh- Cas, y-you.. so much.." Dean whined out lazily, earning a little chuckle from Cas. "Yes, I am 'so much' but I think you're enjoying me.." Cas pressed his chest against Dean's back, staying close to him as he thrust particularly deep, pushing on Dean's prostate again. "ha-ahhh... Caaas..." Dean arched his back out, feeling a little lightheaded from all the stimulation.
"I uh, I'm not sure Dean. sorry." he quickly made his wings tuck away into nothingness when he realized they were still out. "let's just- let's just eat." Castiel changed the subject and sat back down. dean was definitely weirded out, but he wasn't gonna push it.
the next morning when Dean woke up, he walked out to the kitchen to find Castiel making eggs again, except this time it smelled like eggs and not burning. "smells like you know what you're doing Cas."  Castiel turned around with a smile. "yes your lesson last night was very helpful. I think I've mastered them." Castiel was very proud of himself, he made Dean sit and served him the eggs. "please tell me what you think Dean."  Castiel sat down across from him and watched him eat, which was a bit unnerving but Dean didn't want to ruin Cas' good mood.
Dean felt a little stab at his heart, an angel that had sacraficed his own beautiful life was apologizing, again. the former hunter reached a hand down, holding the side of Cas's face to look into the tear filled eyes infront of him. "please dont tell me you're sorry, man.. you just.. you're always just doing your angel shit.. you're way smarter than me and I guess my stupid human brain couldn't understand.." Cas ever so slightly tilted his head into dean's touch, not sure of how to respond. lucky for him, Dean wasnt finished. "a-and Cas.. uh.. I do understand some things, you told me you loved me.. fuck, Cas i've been wanting to kiss you since i first met you.." Dean stuttered out, even in the afterlife he was terrified of this. 'I love you' it was so hard, so imposible to just speak. "Cas I-I.." Deans's eyes fell to his lap, one hand on Cas's face and the other grasping onto his coat. "I'm.. in love with you, Cas..." Dean finnaly said, not daring to look up to Cas's face.
away. So stop pushing
"And I know you want me," He took a step closer as the angel's face went red, no doubt thinking the same thing that Dean was. "So don't you give me that "our hands are tied" shit because we both know that isn't true."
"Alright, alright, I'll back off," Sam conceded. "But can I say one more thing?"
"All I know is that something - fate, God, something - is constantly pulling at me," Cas sounded as broken as Dean did, voice desperate and pleading. "It feels like I'm being dragged miles away from you, completely out of reach. And I can't stop it, no matter how hard I try."
"Find anything yet?"
A slow smile began to spread across the angel's features. If there's one thing Dean knew, it was that Cas loved learning little things about humans, the tiny nuances that he couldn't pick up when watching from afar.
"Cas," He started, doing his best to keep his voice steady as his angel began to massage his shoulders. "You remember what I told you about these lines, right? That you use them on people you want to… you know."
"Cas… it's not like that. He doesn't know, trust me." Dean managed to get out between laughs. "It's just a pickup line."
With their chests pressed together, Dean could feel just how fast Cas's heart was racing. He had no doubt that his was running at a similar speed.
He waited until he heard the door shut before he let out a frustrated groan, placing his head in his hands.
Seems like he wasn't the only one enjoying this.
"I didn't think so. I'll talk to you later."
"Cas, you're a freaking angel, okay? If you think our fate is written in the stars, then let's rewrite the goddamn stars!"
"Yeah? What's that?"
Cas shuffled around Dean to the sink, arm brushing briefly against his. That shouldn't have been enough to send shivers up his spine, and yet…
"Cas-" Dean started, but the angel wasn't done.
When he turned around, he found Cas far closer than he remembered. He brushed it off; after all, the hallway bathroom was fairly small. And Cas had never really had a good concept of personal space.
making fun of Sam for this later.
"Why am I alive, Cas?"
Lifting his head, Dean's eyes met Cas's. In them, he could see the same fire, the same heat that he was feeling. There was no doubt.
He still didn't know how the hell Cas did that.
he thought bitterly.
"I have a cut on my lip." He informed Dean.
"Dammit, Cas, don't you know that I want you?"
"Well, I'll save the D for later." Dean replied with a wink, before turning on his heel and walking away.
Before Dean could even think to make a move, the girl was up and moving towards him. Without a word, she slid into the booth across from him.
"But I don't deserve to live, Cas! I should be dead! I should-"
As always, please leave a review with your thoughts and suggestions, and thank you for reading my story!
"You know, something people say. It's like, a comment used to start a conversation with someone you're interested in, I guess," Dean was having trouble explaining. Which was surprising, because pickup lines were a concept he was very familiar with.
"Dean, what-"
This couldn't be more of a chick-flick moment, but Dean didn't care. How could he, when Cas was giving him
"The gay bar?" Dean interrupted him, raising an eyebrow. "You're at the gay bar?"
And when their lips finally meet, he swears to heaven and hell alike that he'll rewrite those goddamn stars.
Dean froze as Cas slowly slid his hands from his shoulders and walked away.
Dean's head snapped up, but Cas had already returned his attention to the papers in front of him, expression unreadable.
"Mine too."
"Sam, why are you supplying my angel with cheesy-ass pickup lines?" Dean demanded over the phone.
So the hunter took another step closer.
, he thought to himself. He was Dean Winchester. No feeling was too unpleasant to be forgotten with unhealthy amounts of alcohol and porn.
"I'm making it better." He whispered, before repeating the action, lips pressed against the fabric of Dean's shirt.
"Thank you, Dean. You have always been kind," Dean was tempted to argue. He had been an asshole to Cas on more than one occasion. "I apologize for being so… fragile."
"Have you realized that we're always tasting our own tongues?"
"Someone knows, Dean." Cas whispered urgently.
There was something else in the angel's expression too, something he couldn't quite make out. But for now, this was enough.
Dean glanced up from his computer, where he had been searching for cases for the past hour. He was just about ready to blow his brains out from boredom.

Dean reached a hand up to Cas's tie, deftly loosening it before allowing his hands to trail down his angel's chest. Cas was breathing heavily now, eyes locked on Dean's hands.
~ Elizabeth (FanOfDeliciousFlavour)
"But Cas-" Dean stopped short as the angel brought a hand to his face, cupping it gently.
"It's just… you
Dean paused. Something was off. His angel's voice was weary, almost hurt.
Because the second option was to stay where he was, to wait and see what Cas would do… and maybe initiate something himself.
"I don't understand," Cas said. Dean almost laughed at how confused his angel sounded. "What is the ultimate goal of this?"
As always, please leave a review with your thoughts, suggestions, and predictions and I'll see you in the next chapter!
"Dean.. you have no idea.. how long I've waited.." Cas muttered in between the little kisses he left along Dean's neck, his tone was almost angry, it made Dean melt even more. "i-i can imagine.." Dean responded, trying to push at Cas's buttons slightly. "no, you Can't.." Cas's wings lifted up, covering them both in a dark shadow. "for so long Dean.. just like I said before-" Cas grabbed onto Dean's waist and put him down on the bed a little roughly, crawling on top of him to stare down with stern eyes. "-ever since I pulled you from Hell, Dean.. you've had me." Dean just watched him, feeling so small underneath Cas's ethereal form. it made him go quiet to see just how beautiful he really was. "I didn't even understand what I wanted when I wanted it.."
Dean hopped into his car, taking a moment to feel the steering wheel. "thanks Jack.." he muttered to himself, turning the car on and leaving. he didn't know where he was going, he just figured he'd end up in the right place by chance. lucky for him, he was right. after a bit of driving down seemingly endless and beautiful roads, he saw the barn. his barn. the one that brought him and Cas together years ago. 'Cas..." he sped up, excitement and anxiety took over his stomach as he pulled into the dirt parking lot in front. quickly getting out of the car. Dean stopped, staring at the beautiful pair of black wings in front of the barn entrance.  “Cas.. Cas holy shit!” Dean quickly made his way over to him, grabbing him and pulling him into a tight bone-crushing hug. “Hello, Dean..” Cas replied, his wings flapping lightly as they came to a gentle rest. "fuck Cas I'm so sorry.. i-i should have said something before. god, I'm so fucking sorry Cas.."
"yeah.." Castiel sounded unsure, Sam tilted his head a bit. "what's wrong? you guys are together now right? this isn't just a one-time thing like most of his hookups." Castiel looked up to Sam and shrugged. "not to overshare to you Sam, but he told me he loved me. What if he doesn't and it was just spur of the moment kind of thing?" Sam smiled, Dean said he loved Cas, there was no doubt in Sam's mind that the two would be okay. "Cas, you think he throws that around lightly? when was the last time he said that to me?" Castiel fumbled his fingers around. "guess you're right... I'm just making myself more worried than I should be."
Took a right down the road, I don't really know where I'm going so I'm sorry if it takes a while to find me. and the keys to Baby are in my right pocket, she's all yours. I love you, Sammy. I love everyone. I'm sorry, I'm really really fucking sorry.'
"Cas.. Cas, fuck.." he covered his face with his hands as he cried out, as if to hide his emotions from the empty room he sat in. "Cas c-come back.. Fuck, Cas! come back! Cas!" Dean's scream crying echoed through the room and around the bunker, he was lucky nobody else was inside to hear him. Dean pulled at his hair, knees up to his chest like a scared child. all the other times Cas had died, there was a struggle, a fight. he had tried to stop it, or at least looked like he wanted to live, not this time. it was like he was waiting for this, Cas looked like he was glad to finally be dying. that thought tore Dean apart, the look on Cas's face was burnt into the back of his eyes.
"don't stop Cas, keep telling me." Castiel held on tight to Dean, focusing back on his speech. "u-ummn angels wings are very sensitive, and we all have different colours. arch angels have two sets of wings while my class only has on-" he was cut off by a hard tug of his feathers. "Nnggh...! Dean.."-"wanna know about you specifically Cas." Dean loosened his grip on Cas' wings, stroking them up and down now. "alright.." Castiel said, catching his breath. "I guess... I really enjoyed it when you called them strong and big. it feels really good to hear that.." Dean let a hand run down Castiels back, sliding his fingers slightly into Cas' pants. "I can take them off if you want."
"don't tell Dean what?" Dean popped up behind them in the doorway to Sam's room. both Cas and Sam's hearts nearly stopped at the sudden intrusion.
it was late into the night when the next incident occurred. Cas found himself alone in the kitchen with Dean one night, Sam had gone to bed and Cas had been trying to learn how to make food when Dean came out to help.
"Dean.. Aah-Ahhh Dean oh-" the little twitches of his wings turned to frantic flaps above Dean, Cas's back arching out as his whole body tensed. "Mggh-Ghhhm!!" Dean gripped tighter onto his angel as cum filled his throat all over again, much more this time, however. Cas eventually let Dean pull his mouth off, cum dripping down both corners of his lips. "oh you feel lovely dean..." Cas slowly lowered his wings down to his side, hunching over lazily. "J-Jesus Cas.. that..' Dean took a moment to catch his breath, swallowing as much of Cas's cum as he could manage. "that was so fucking hot.." Cas lifted himself off of Dean's chest, wrapping an arm around his body to pull him up off the bed. "good, I'm sure you'll enjoy the rest of our time in here."
Led Zeplin
Cas came back a few minutes later, carrying a box full of things. he walked back into their room and emptied out the box onto the end of the bed. "there.. these should do.." Cas looked to Dean, who was sitting on the bed with his shirt already gone. "geez..." on the bed, Cas had picked out three different sized hunting knives, a roll of thick rope, and a pair of Enochian handcuffs. "are these okay, Dean...?" he asked, going to sit down beside him. "these are perfect, Cas..." Dean said, pulling him into his lap, Cas' back pressed against Dean's chest. "you ready to start, hot stuff?" Cas just nodded in response, resting his head on Dean. he wrapped an arm tightly around Cas's chest, holding him as he leaned forward to grab one of the hunting knives. "hold still." Cas watched closely as Dean took the knife, moving it up to Cas’s chest, then sliding it to his neck, pressing right under his chin. “How’s that feel..?” Dean asked quietly, resting his head on Cas’s shoulder to watch his face. “I-it feels nice, Dean..”
they just had each other, and their pancakes.
"I hope wherever I go, I can see you.." he muttered quietly. Dean set his phone down on the barn floor with his flashlight still on so he could see what he was doing. "m'sorry..." He slowly brought the hunting knife up to his wrist, pressing the tip of the blade down on his upper forearm. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to watch. "cr-crap..." He fought the urge to pull his arm away, pushing the blade into his skin and dragging it all the way down his arm. blood began to spill out of the deep cut, dripping down onto the barn floor and onto Dean's pants. "okay.. o-one down.."
clearly all this was really starting to get to Dean, his grip tightened around Cas's neck, holding onto him like he might slip away at any moment. "Really, Cas I'm so-sorry...!" Cas flapped his wings harder this time, making his thrusts all the stronger. "I wish you had..." he groaned out, the anger from before beginning to build back up inside of him as he aggressively fucked into his hunter, the whole barn seemed to shake. Dean held desperately close to him, a few tears rolled down his warm face."C-Cas Ahhggh!" Dean's prostate was hit over and over again, every time sending shivers of pleasure through his whole body, it almost felt like warm electricity shooting through his nerves. He was right to feel like that, as Cas had been pushing small bits of his grace into Dean's soul with each thrust. he needed Dean to really feel him.
There’s a legend about the guardians of this place. They’re said to wander the meadow aimlessly, sitting amongst the flowers and chatting aimlessly about the day. They’re often holding hands. They’ve been known to strike up conversation with those passing through, and on occasion, help people cross to the wooded side of the bridge.
“You knew me,” Dean said, “you knew me. And I knew you. That’s all there is, right? All there ever was.”
It didn’t make a sound when he pulled Cas’ heart out. He’d expected it to. He’d anticipated the grisly sound of flesh ripping away from flesh, the sickening sound of blood breaking free from its veins; a lifetime of senseless murder and irrevocable violence preparing him for something that never came. The heart stopped oozing as Dean pulled it free of its confines. In an instant, all the blood that’d entrenched it a moment before had dried and cleared, leaving behind the soft pink exterior unmarred.
Unimaginable. There wasn’t a single ancient text or archaic spell that could instruct them on this in such a way that would ensure a safe return on either Dean or Cas’ part; but it was
Nothing but silence answered him. His feet made no noise as he continued to move forward. He felt as though he were walking through mud.
It would’ve been silly, two grown men sitting like this, the taller one curled on the ground and needy like an unloved child, had the circumstances been different. It probably would’ve even been embarrassing. In this moment, they both inexplicably found themselves suspended in time, taking on their old roles of brother and brother, mother and child, mentor to mentee, and open palm and hand that needed to be held. Dean had never felt so old or so young before than he did now.
More silence. It went on for so long that Dean was almost convinced they were going to sit like that until the sun came up. He wouldn’t’ve minded.
“I know you’re there, Cas. I know it. I’d know it blind. C-cause Cas…….
Then, as fast as it’d come, that moment was over.
This is where Castiel differed. It was a careful dance they’d crafted- Cas assuming and Dean refuting, over and over again like clockwork- and while he didn’t want to fall into any new traps, there was a time when he needed to decide to swipe the cards to the floor entirely and jump across the poker table.
“Would it matter?” Castiel responded. “If I meant it, would it matter?”
He heard Sam walk up and stop in the doorway but gave no indication that he was going to greet him. He didn’t even look up. Why would he?
big, maybe. All of time and space and mortal matter resided inside Castiel’s brain, and he still found it in himself to be afraid when something felt
Dean was overtaken with a far off, mournful feeling he couldn’t quite describe. He took his eyes away from their fixed point on the fridge down to Sam’s head. He couldn’t see his face. Sam’s ridiculous mop of hair covered it. He was reminded of a time when they were young, and Sam was too small to understand much of anything at all, when they’d huddle together for comfort and warmth when John was gone. Sammy would cry sometimes. He didn’t understand where Dad went. Dean would coddle him and let him cry in his lap and reassure him that Dad would be home soon.
Dean told himself,
Cas was raw, but Dean couldn’t quite see it. Not yet, anyway. The cool night air on the angel’s skin was grounding, and he desperately needed it. He felt the enormity of it all sitting on his chest. His mind wandered to an old folk tale, where one would wake up in the night to find their chest weighed down by a demon, or an angel of death, sitting atop them while they slept. He wished it could be something so simple. At least he could grab
“It’s a fucking curse, man. To me. To
More silence stretched between them. Dean continued to pet his head like it was his duty to.
Dean looked up and tried to look off into the distance. It was like he was looking with his eyes closed. They could gain no purchase on any beam of light or anything real. The magnitude of this
How could Dean be angry over something so quiet? Castiel floated away, bit by bit, and Dean couldn’t feel despair. He felt content to watch Castiel float away for the rest of time, and all that remained after that. He didn’t know if it should’ve been this way all along, or if Castiel had only recently needed to go, but he decided it didn’t matter. The being he’d loved so deeply was departing, and Dean was not so selfish as to take something so precious away from him.
familiar. He didn’t remember feeling quite in control of his body, as if restrained inside of some pre-determined scene in this dream state. Regardless, he’d felt his hands reach out towards this being, as if trying to grab it.
Castiel repeated, his voice even softer than before, yet more firm. He moved the second of his right arms up and cupped Dean’s face in his hands. Castiel wiped away the tears that Dean hadn’t realized were still coming.
Neither had ever really known such a word. Tasted it, maybe, but only in the same way one samples food in a foreign market or feels the rush of adrenaline after the big drop of a rollercoaster. It was always fleeting. A touch, a punch, and then gone.
When Dean opened his eyes, he looked not at Cas’ face, but at his torso, where the pumping heart resided. It’s red and purple incandescence stood out so starkly against the swirling white blue of the rest of Cas’ form. It pumped resolutely and strong but bled with each pump. Tendrils of sopping, blue-black blood dripped from the quivering muscle and onto the floor. It didn’t look as complete as it might have been a long time ago. Dean had no real way of knowing.
Finally, Dean Winchester let himself fall away.
Here he was. He’d reaped what he’d sown, and here he was, watching it flutter in his hands as if it wasn’t going to be taken away with the wind like the rest. It shrunk down to something dim and small, moving erratically, like the wings of a butterfly trying to gain enough wind to fly. Dean was struck with the fragility of it all. Maybe Cas’ heart had always been this way, underneath the scar tissue of being alive. Maybe he’d always been something small.
They were staring at one another again. Deans hand lingered on Cas shoulder, unwilling to let go.
“I know,” Sam soothed, placing a hand on his knee. “I know. It’s okay. It’s okay.”
would’ve died too. I wish we both c-could’ve stayed dead! Maybe then some of this would make fucking sense—t-then I wouldn’t have to feel this, goddamnit! I wouldn’t have to be here, begging for you to be here, to be
at him. There was no escape for him, even if he wanted there to be. He felt Cas’ eyes on him everywhere, even in this vacuum, and it made something inside of him break.
“Cas,” he breathed. The scent of his relief exhaled with the ice-cold breath from his lungs.
The being in his dream had moved closer, a bit more in focus, but Dean had still not been able to comprehend what he saw. He
It was like talking without saying, in a sense. This time, however, was different. You see, the world had started anew on this night. Things were starting over. The throne was passed down, the lineage of the Creator transferred down, and the two men had been thrust into the real definition of
Dean Winchester breathed in again, and the heart was gone. Nothing remained. He was staring down at empty hands.
The other man, Dean Winchester, was not the first to look away. This simple, seemingly innocuous fact had been the amalgamation of every single thing that had happened to them, good and bad, and landed them here. Dean Winchester had always been the first to look away. He’d always been the one to pull the reins. He’d always been the one to duck his head. He’d always been the one to be
“You were wrong,” He breathed out into the dark. He took another step forward and set his jaw. “You were
When Dean came back to himself and opened his eyes, he saw something. Out of the darkness of the Empty, a light- blue, flickering, swirling itself into existence like a fine mist slowly coagulating- sprung forth from the chaos of Nothing. Slowly, other colors and lights began to appear and join the first, rearranging itself into something more palpable than a thinly spread apparition. It gained two legs and four arms, then attached themselves to a torso of swirling, incalculable proportions. A heart, visceral and as living and palpable as he’d ever seen one, grotesquely formed itself in the middle of the being’s torso, right where its stomach should’ve been. Wispy lines of spider-silk veins sprouted from the heart and wrapped around the rest of the body in elegant brambles of pure energy. Behind the being sprung an unknowable number of wings, all feathered and incorporeal and undulating with a sort of restless power he’d never known. He couldn’t tell their color, for they weren’t a color at all, but rather, a mass of stars and raindrops and every quaking moment before a lightning storm. Lastly, from the brambles of energy sprouted a head, and a face grew forth from which Dean could not fully comprehend. He imagined that there may have been a time where setting eyes upon this face would’ve wiped his existence off the map, and he would’ve looked away before he had the chance; he didn’t do that now. Dean gazed upon this face like he’d been hungering for it for eternity. Maybe he had.
to stop remembering him. He remembered when Cas first rode beside him in the Impala. He looked like he couldn’t decide to put his hands. He remembered when Cas sent him to the wrong building when trying to help him on a hunt; he’d apologized like he’d just killed Dean’s mother. He remembered when Cas, his mind high-jacked by Naomi, beat him bloody and blue, each hit a merciless jab, and he remembered the way his eyes cleared when Dean finally got through to him. He’d never looked more calm.
All of that ugly melancholy that Dean had spent his whole life guarding to his chest like a rabid dog on its last desperate leg finally gave way.
angry with you, Castiel. I know you’re here. I know it. You’re crazy if you think I couldn’t find you, even here, even—even after you’re gone. You’re fucking crazy, man. So just—just come on out, okay, and we can go home. You can come home, damnit. You never even…. you didn’t even say…..
It was that time.
Maybe the world wasn’t as big as Castiel felt. Maybe the world, when stripped down to its bones, was made up this; two souls, love, alienated under the washed-out streetlights and forced out from under the rock it hid. Maybe it was as small and as simple as their feet on the ground and their
The being’s face looked like a thousand holy words all mashed into one single instance. It looked like the face of a child he’d seen playing at the park alongside of him when he was young. It looked like the writhing, pulsing bowels of every living thing he’d ever had the misfortune of bleeding dry. It looked like the smell of his bedsheets when the winter was particularly cold, and Dean had to hide under the blankets to stay warm; it looked like the bludgeoned visage of every single moment he’d ever laid eyes on the man he loved. Before him was a being so unearthly beautiful and so invoking of an absolute eldritch terror, something that cut straight into his bone marrow and tore him to pieces, and all Dean could do was
Dean Winchester took a deep breath, and Castiel was gone.
Cas, stuck inside of me, and I can’t put it anywhere. It’s suffocating. It’s so fucking painful, man, and you- you……you talk about it like it’s the biggest blessing someone can have.”
Castiel seemed to consider this for a moment, then smiled. “I’m sure. I like the air. The energy…it’s palpable. I’m sure you can feel it, too.”
There was only one thing Dean wanted.
“Would it matter…” Dean echoed. There was no upturn in his voice to indicate a question. He made this sound deep in his throat, as if he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and shook his head. “I don’t know, Cas. You tell me. Does it matter? Do you know what you even said?”
Cas furrowed his eyebrows together. “What is that supposed to mean?”
Not tonight. On the night the world had started anew, Dean Winchester decided that he would, too. Castiel was the one to look away and continue walking. Dean simply followed.
Off to the far East, there resides a bridge over a clear blue river. The water flows lazily underneath it. Its wood is of tarnished chestnut Oak. Ancient spikes hold the old planks in place. The bridge is well worn from an eternity of wandering feet crossing its length, yet it still holds strong as ever. On the other side resides a forest; deep and dark and clean. One could only look so far into its depths before the rest is shrouded in mist. To find out what lies beyond, you’d have to cross over.
Dean couldn’t get his mouth to work at first. He slowly shook his head. He couldn’t look away from Castiel’s face. He couldn’t possibly deprive himself of beholding something so sacred for even a moment.
Dean opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again, and repeated the process a few more times. He’d always found himself tongue tied at the most inopportune times, and this time was no exception. He wished he could cut his tongue out and kick it into the ground. Maybe then it’d learn its lesson.
Dean tried to scream, but it always came out so much harsher. In his head, his words were rotting and soaked with sorrow. They sounded more like sobs than screams.
Dean repeated. “I dunno, Cas, you hold weight in your words sometimes that I doubt you mean. If we’re going to do this, I want to be sure you’re not just talking out of ass. Gotta…..I want you to….talk with…” Dean made a hesitant little circular gesture with his hand, then circled it forward and thumped the back of his middle finger against Cas’ chest, “with your ticker. You know.”
That was a long time ago. Dean had barely known Cas back then. It’d made him so confused, to watch the angel stand so still and look out towards the sea. It was something so human, but looked so wrong when done by something who didn’t sway and dance with the sea breeze in the way only a human could. It’d made him angry.
“I can’t, Cas,” Dean heaved. His mouth felt so dry. He knew exactly what Cas wanted him to take, and he was scared. He didn’t feel strong enough. “You need it. I don’t want to. I need you to come home. I can’t touch it. You…. You need to understand. Not with……. N-not…” Dean trailed off. He looked down at his own hands, and the one Cas held.
Dean remembered a dream he’d had many years ago. There’d been this light surrounding him—enveloping him more like, as it was as if he was being embraced—and something moving towards him that he couldn’t quite see. It was as if his vision warped and blurred the figure before him as to keep him from seeing it clearly. It’d been blue and yellow and white and vaguely human-shaped, and it had moved unlike anything he’d ever seen before. It was Creation walking. Perhaps its humanoid figure had taken form by chance, or perhaps it was a learned state of being from prowling the Earth constrained, but regardless, it’d struck Dean as something familiar, even if he didn’t know what it was.
him, a man with just the same. The moment they’d connected, their raw souls had become irreversibly intertwined, if only for a fraction of a millisecond. Dean had seen the whole of Creation, funneled down into one speck of energy and one shaped of an angel.
“Cas, about….about what you said….” Dean started again, then trailed off, as if he expected the angel to interject.
In order to save Cas, Sam had to let Dean go.
“You don’t have to say goodbye,” Dean supplied automatically, surprised that his own voice came out just as soft as Sam’s.
Sam was at peace.
Dean thought, but didn’t say. He could feel wetness on his leg where Sam rested, and Dean fought to swallow down a bit of his own tears. Dean wanted to both thank and curse whatever it was that made Sam change his mind.
“No, Cas. I know you……I know you love me,” He responded, his words slow, “but I don’t……I want you to love me in a way that I’m not sure you completely understand.”
When they’d first discovered it, Sam wouldn’t accept it. He wouldn’t agree to help. Dean didn’t know why he’d expected anything different, but
Dean closed his eyes painfully, leaning into the hand on his cheek. Cas’ touch felt like pure
Dean thought of the sea. He’d met Cas on the Pacific shore once, on a day where the sun was dim, and the gray clouds blotted the sky. Cas had told him it was the only place they wouldn’t be overheard. He’d found the angel beside the sea-rotten wood of a fallen tree, watching a baby sea turtle scramble helplessly towards the sea. He hadn’t helped. Simply observed.
At least here, Dean had no one to tell him he wasn’t worth being saved.
with both hands. Castiel’s palms were unnervingly empty, yet the feeling still stayed.
The man with the veteran edge and year-worn soldiers, Castiel, had made some concessions to get here. Hell, he’d made them all. He’d given everything for this, and now that it was here…...well. It felt big.
------------------
Dean wished he’d never learned how to use his hands.
Two figures stood on the corner of First and Cherry Street, under the flickering fluorescent streetlight. One was rigid and resolute; he stood with the air of a retired veteran on the verge of a memory. The other was rigid as well, but in a much less dignified manor; his hands twitched insatiably, walking the line between reaching out and recoiling indefinitely. Neither of them spoke. Both stared at one another, paused momentarily from a walk under the night sky.
Castiel used to look at Dean so gently. Even when he was angry. Even when he cried. He wouldn’t stop
I’m tired of thinking about it, Cas. We’ve been through this before. Haven’t we?”
threatened to overwhelm him. Slowly, he closed his eyes.
-----------------
You never gave fuck about yourself, or what you did, or what you said. Especially not to me. You selfish bastard.”
They’d fought about it, like they always did. Dean had been getting better at controlling his temper, but damn it if they didn’t scream their lungs out at each other over this. Dean just felt so out of control. He felt that there was no way to get anyone to hear him besides yelling until he couldn’t anymore.
Dean dropped to his hands and knees, taking some heaving breaths and staring down blankly. He wasn’t meant to be here. His soul couldn’t handle it. The ground felt wet and unstable under his hands, and that same dampness started to invade his lungs. He started to panic, but he quickly forced himself to stay calm. He had a feeling that he wouldn’t come back from losing his cool in a place like this. The very atmosphere seemed out to eradicate him as fast as possible.
Dean just wanted Cas to come home. He didn’t want this. He didn’t come here to commit some final act of violence. He didn’t want to be the one to rip out the heart of Cas’ soul completely. He didn’t want to turn him to dust. Why did it have to be him? Was this some sort of punishment? Maybe the universe outside of God’s influence was crueler than God had ever been. Maybe it was some divine justice; take the life that’d resurrected him in the beginning. Rebalance the scales.
Dean still couldn’t quite understand it.
He turned his eyes back up to Cas’ intolerable face and grabbed ahold of it, his thumb resting opposite of the rest of his fingers, cupping the part of his face he assumed to be his jaw. He couldn’t see his facial construction clearly, as the vision of him was ever-changing, but he got the impression in his mind of where to touch. He simply knew.
Maybe it’d made Cas angry, too. What Dean had failed to realize back then, and many moments afterwards, was that Castiel was a living tangle of the threads of anger and desire and love, unable and forbidden from lamenting what could and couldn’t be. On that beach, they’d both been the same.
“We don’t have to walk, if you don’t want to,” Dean started. His hands still twitched. “I could call Sam around, have him bring the car.”
“It was never supposed to be like this.” His voice shook. He sucked in violently. No one responded. “None of this was. None of it. I--  I know. I know that I can’t change what was. What
Cas, an angel with a duty and a borrowed, heavy heart, and Cas
The story resides in the back of every living thing’s consciousness, unnoticed but still thriving. In one single event, not unlike the Big Bang, it’d been encoded into the cosmic DNA of every thing created, and everything that ever had been. In this instance, all of Creation had been set free.
What’d been Castiel’s true form was fading away. Specs of his previous radiance floated off like the seeds of a dandelion in a soft wind. His wings started to go first, and from there it slowly crept over the rest of him.
he’d thought,
he wanted to say,
“Cas,” Dean called out. His voice echoed into the inky black. It was suffocating. It felt as though the air itself fought to cancel out any noise, wrestling the air from Dean’s throat when he tried to talk and pushing insistently at his chest. It was cold enough that he was certain there’d be ice crystalizing onto his eyelashes if he could see them.
Dean looked up at Castiel. For a moment, everything was still. Castiel and Dean Winchester stared at each other with a love that was something much more than love, and saw every instance of each other that ever was and ever could have been unravelling before them.
“I can’t remember a time that I didn’t have you around,” Sam started again, “not actually, anyway. You were always somewhere, Dean. I’ve always known my brother was
The size of it was bigger than anything I’d ever known, and I……I was afraid. I hid from it. I shrunk it down and put it in a box somewhere deep inside me that I promised to never open, but you…...you fucked that all up. You have such a way with fucking everything up, man. No box I made could keep the size of it from pushing through. Deep, nauseating love that I had nowhere to place. I didn’t think you could hold something so intense for me.”
If Dean Winchester looked back over his life, he wouldn’t see many things he liked. Hell, he wouldn’t be able to watch most of it without feeling sicker than a dog. Every step he’d taken since the moment he was born had felt like a never-ending fight to take his last. Walking here, in the Empty, with an actual supernatural force weighing him down, felt no different than every morning he’d woken up and stared at whatever godforsaken ceiling had been over his head; but he couldn’t do it this time. Dean had found a way to live for the little things in the spaces in between, but he’d been lying to himself in a way he simply couldn’t comprehend. To finally let go- to finally understand the previously incomprehensible feeling in his heart, to come to terms with his life as it was when it came down to the bare bones of things- was simply too much. He’d seceded his will to go on countless times before this, in life and in death, but this was different. This was more personal than that. This wasn’t him forfeiting his will to live, but his right and duty to live as a whole. His essence, as it were, could wither no further.
“You spineless bastard,”  Dean breathed to the ground, his voice crackling around the edges, “I hate you. I hate you so much. You never cared, Castiel. You never once cared about yourself.
was useless. So I…...I went back to what I was before I realized what I had. I tried to pretend like I had nothing. Like I couldn’t feel, but
Cas’ hands never left Dean’s face. He anchored him there, encapsulating Dean in a sort of loving touch that felt more vital than breathing. There was something different about Cas’ face as he broke apart. The essence of joy—of peaceful, accepting serenity—had never been so clearly expressed than in that moment. Castiel was the freest he’d ever been.
After the last time the fought, Sam didn’t speak for him for two weeks. The halls of the bunker had grown even more quiet than they had been before. Sam wouldn’t even look at him. They ate separately; they worked separately. They coexisted like two ghosts caught in their own defunct endings. Dean had never felt so forsaken.
The heart still rested in his hands. It began to beat slower. With every beat, it changed color—the pinkish, fleshy hue it had once taken on began to fade away, overtaken by the effervescent blue light that Cas’ ethereal body had given off. Dean watched its transformation with calm acceptance. He held it so gently that he felt he might drop it.
How something so mortal had ended up at the center of Cas’ being was a question Dean didn’t want to know the answer to, but implicitly knew anyway.
Castiel very gingerly reached over to the hand on his shoulder and removed it, instead resting it against his own hand and aligning their fingers. He didn’t entangle them. Palm to palm, he remained still.
He didn’t. Castiel simply continued to walk, chin forward, albeit trembling.
Dean slid his hand up his face, cupping his cheek, then his jaw, then his ear and head, then whatever else he could touch, like he was trying to claw at every part of him he could remember seeing. Every part of his face he’d always been able to see yet had never seen before. This was
“Cas,” Dean said, his tone a bit more forceful. If he’d never gotten the angels attention in the past, he prayed he’d be able to capture it now. When Castiel didn’t respond, Dean grabbed his shoulder and forced him around, bringing them both to a halt. “Goddamnit, Cas, are you listening?”
Dean visibly softened. His own heart and brain had been disconnected for as long as he could remember, but something in Castiel’s eyes coaxed out a yearning to understand in a way he hadn’t quite felt before.
Dean cleared his throat. “Is Cas no longer around, Sam? Is that what the Empty is?”
Dean reached out and took Cas’ heart in his hands. Reaching into Cas’ body felt no different than plunging his hands into a fiery inferno; it was nothing he hadn’t done before. Cas’ heart felt warm and alive. It started to beat a little faster under his touch, the muscle pulsating against Dean’s own pulse. The sight of it was heartbreakingly
Dean had been wrong, too. About many things. They’d both been so wrong about each other that it was almost laughable. Dean wasn’t laughing now, though. He simply knelt, the dark liquid on the floor soaking into his pant legs, and let his sorrow overtake him.
Hadn’t they been through this enough? They’d nearly lost each other more times they could count, and in the scope of things, they were living a whole new life. Things had never been calmer or more normal for them. Dean thought that, with this new stability, maybe they could go after what they wanted.
He’d always be familiar to Dean and so unbearably estranged in his mind at the same time. Dean couldn’t ever forget him, and he also couldn’t stop forgetting him, day in and day out. The paradox of it all threatened to tear him apart. He accepted this eventuality with open arms.
Silence enveloped them again. Dean found himself curling a little close to Sam, as if he’d be able to coddle his head and encase him like a mother over her crying child. Wasn’t that it, after all? What they’d been forced to become? It was familiar. It smelled of home.
Dean looked up into the darkness. Still, nothing responded. Dean shook his head jerkily and swallowed with saliva he didn’t have. “
"No one can rewrite the stars, Dean," He spoke softly, as if afraid the words were too much for either of them to hear. "How… how can you say you'll be mine when it's not up to you, or to me? I'm an angel-"
"But why?" Dean demanded. He took a step in the angel's direction, but Cas backed away. "We always have been free to be… you and me, whatever the hell we were before today, within these walls. What's different about this?"
"So many… so many people have died. People I knew, people I cared about. They didn't deserve it. Not one." By the time he was done, his voice had practically become a whisper.
He'd never felt more ridiculous, but the angel was listening carefully. He always did.
The angel froze in his grip, eyes going wide as the hunter drew even closer. For once, Cas seemed to be speechless. Dean took the opportunity, lowering his voice to near a whisper as he struggled to get the words out.
"What the hell… how?" He demanded. "What happened, exactly?"
And just like that, he walked away.
"You're still an angel to me." He whispered. And it was true. He'd never stopped thinking of Cas as an angel, and doubted he ever would.
"And I'd pull off your shirt."
"This body is so fragile. It… it bleeds so easily."
Sam just chuckled.
"But Dean," Cas began quietly. "The only room with a view is a room with you in it."
All too soon, Cas was turning off the water, turning to face Dean.
Dean made his decision.
"It hurts." He murmured. Dean was tempted to roll his eyes; after all, it should only have stung a little bit. But he reminded himself that Cas wasn't used to this.
He watched with satisfaction as a slow smile spread across his angel's face, as Cas realized what had just happened.
It scared him.
It's a few days later when Cas makes use of his newfound knowledge.
understand, Dean?” Castiel asked simply, flicking his gaze to meet Dean’s once again. “Your love. Your heart. I can give you everything you want, but if you don’t understand, I’ll be screaming myself bloody. I’ll always bleed for you, but that on its own won’t make you happy.”
“Right. Okay,” he answered, then simply fell into pace with Cas as they walked.
It was as if Dean was the only soul in this stretch of forever.
softness that I couldn’t use for anyone. It was useless.
its energy thrumming through him, but he couldn’t see. He hadn’t been allowed.
even if somewhere I couldn’t reach. And….and I don’t know how to deal with the idea of you not being……. well.
“Yeah,” Sam echoed. There was no real conviction behind his voice. He was repeating the same empty words he always had. Dean didn’t try to convince him into believing it, this time. He didn’t want to lie anymore.
“He’s part of me, Sammy,” Dean shook, his voice watery and sweet and full of something awful, “and I can’t walk around without it. Not this time. Not this hole. It’s going to hollow me out for good.”
A new memory formed behind his eyes this time; a memory forgotten by time and pain and the influence of something holy. He was in Hell again. Scenes of incomprehensible torment and pain flared around him with unbarred verocity, and he’d been in the thick of it, drowning under oceans of blood and flesh and an infinite amount of everything sharp and pain shaped. He’d
He didn’t. Instead, he sunk down to the floor beside Dean’s chair, folding his legs underneath him, and he laid his head gently in Dean’s lap.
Cas…….Cas, I don’t hate you. I’m so fucking angry, and I don’t hate you. I don’t. I never could. I want to tell you……yuh-you were wrong about everything, Cas, but I’ll give you t-this; you weren’t wrong about me. I have too much….all this
Dean didn’t remember the events leading up to his descent into the Empty. He knew he’d forget, as it was just another price to pay, but that didn’t stop him from feeling sad about it. He opened his eyes to the dark void of the Empty, already on his own two feet, and all he could really do was hope that Sammy was going to be okay. Nothing came without a price, after all. Dean didn’t believe he’d see him again.
he’d been corrected.
Dean reached forward and patted Sam’s hair. Sam sniffled but didn’t look at him. This type of affection had been barren between them since Dean turned old enough to feel anger, so it was a bit too much for either of them to confront face to face.
Cas. And I’m— I’m so
Silence. Dean still stared. The clock on the wall ticked quietly.
for you to
Dean finally got ahold of his breathing. He opened his eyes again, but still couldn’t see a thing.
For a moment, there was a feeling in the air that felt disastrous; Castiel felt as thought Dean would either punch his lights out or kiss him.
“Did you mean it?” He asked. His voice wavered under the weight of projected heartbreak. “An’- an’ I don’t want any bullshit. I don’t want you to lie, and I don’t want you to leave it be. I…. did you mean it?”
If Dean Winchester were an honest man, he would’ve noted the way his heart squeezed painfully in his chest at his words. He wasn’t an honest man in any way except for when it counted, however, so he cleared his throat and closed his eyes.
Cas stood on his toes to press another soft kiss to Dean's lips.
He could sense the angel's surprise without even looking at him.
"I'm going to do us both a favor and ignore what you're trying to imply, Sam," Dean informed him, voice tight. "Just… stop giving my angel goddamn lines to use on me."
On these days, he would lock himself away, hide in his room in the bunker. Sam had learned to leave him alone… but Cas was a different story, as it turned out.
"When you fell from heaven."
"Not now, Sammy," He called gruffly as he heard the door begin to creak open.
Blue eyes meet green, and each finds themselves overwhelmed by the amount of feeling in the other's gaze. Dean knows that neither of them have felt this way before.
"I heard that line on the television," Cas informed him. "And as you utilize bathroom fixtures far more than I do, I'll take the other room."
"You make that offer tempting," Cas admitted.
"...Oh."
"My clothes are made from a special type of material, Dean." Cas informed him. Dean raised an eyebrow.
Dean tightened his grip around his angel's waist, unwilling to risk having Cas slip from his grasp. He was so close to coming around.
"Sammy," Dean growled. "You lost the right to screw with me when you left to be a Sasquatch version of Elle Woods at law school, so tell me what exactly are you trying to do here?"
Cas seemed to read his mind, tilting his head slightly to the side.
"This is… a curious tradition." He finally said.
"No, I'm not."
look? The look that Sammy used to give him, the kind that showed both admiration and gratitude, making Dean feel like a hero.
Taking hold of Cas, he gently guided his finger under the steady stream of water. As the he tensed up, Dean carefully rubbed his thumb over the wound, brushing away the dirt. He placed his free hand around the angel's waist, keeping him close.
