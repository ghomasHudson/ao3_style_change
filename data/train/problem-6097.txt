“Sokovia,” he says slowly, “we can head to Sokovia.” There’s a stunned silence that reigns, although Wanda might feel like it’s just a personal feeling. “What?” Scott asks, looking at everyone. “Look, although there have been efforts to rebuild, you can’t rebuild a
“Yeah, yeah, I know that the shoulder plate is melted and the armor was breached by some sort of chemical agent.” Tony reiterates, rolling the injured shoulder, satisfied with the wet crack it gives as it shifts back into place.
Tony can’t finish his thought because the next thing he knows is darkness, and the muffled, warbled sound of Jarvis sounding the alarm.
A memory springs from the growing darkness, followed by another, like a strobe light, in a constant flickering pattern of inverting darkness.
But, then those eyes are climbing back up Tony’s body, to his face and Tony remembers why he asked for darkness.
“Nothing is truly ever lost, Steven, and what was once lost will come back to you,” Frigga whispers and Steve’s eyes close, and it’s strange, how this woman that he never met, never knew can make him feel so at ease and tense at the same time.
Steve doesn't even remember so it'd be fruitless to ask what they fight about. All he wants is to see that hard glint, those cheeks barely flushed with frustration because Tony may be stubborn but Steve jumped out of a plane against the government's orders with no prior training--so he's more stubborn than Stark.
The elevator has stopped for the last part of Pepper’s request. Pepper has stepped out, not looking at Fury. “The world will need everyone, but it will need people who truly care about them, and not just their mission. If something that cataclysmic happens again, we’re going to need police. We’re going to need the general population to hear us and
“Ay, Thor,” he grunts, shoving the Asgardian onto his back. Enchantress’ hand shakes, rattling the gun as she shoves her second shard into the weapon.
,” Rhodey starts and Ross rolls his eyes, “his daughter is what, how old is she, Ross, isn’t nine a little too young, even for you?” Tony grinds his teeth, tries to unclench his jaw.
“Its no problem,” Aaron smiles and he pauses for a moment. “I know you travel a lot, and that it would probably be hard, but if you hear anything or want a new destination, well, I mean. I know some people. But, say if you hear anything and you think there
“Natasha is MIA,” Clint said with a frown. He handed Steve back the burner phone. Gave no comment or outward inclination to know anything about it, “we can’t be sure if Ross has her or if Tony is keeping her locked in the Compound.”
“Are you really seeing the tapestry? The fabric of events, the motion of reality?” Idonae whispers, as if trying to not destroy the meadow’s tranquility. Her hair is flowing in the warm wind, golden curls sparkling in the sunlight. She is seated in the emerald pastures, surrounded by bloody red apples, jade green apples and a single golden apple that rests on her lap. The previous shawl she had wrapped around her bare form is gone and she sits in her nude beauty, flashing violet-navy eyes shining with mirth. The lavender ruffs of the amaranths rub against her creamy skin, like kittens trying to garner attention.
There's something in the phrase that stirs Steve's memory, like a vague dream he can't remember. Tony grins and returns to the kitchen to finish his breakfast and it takes Steve a few seconds to realize that he's smiling back.
Tony holds himself together until the cold recedes, thinking that maybe Rhodey was wrong. He’d chosen a way, this way, and maybe it wasn’t the right path in the end. Sitting alone in his workshop, trying to will himself to breath. The nanites in his chest would swarm out and back in according to his heartbeats. There was no control here.
With Enchantress gone, the city seems to have calmed down a bit. Tony smiles a little at the news and flips over to another tab, another city broadcasting supernatural activity about.
It’s late already, an unholy hour between too late and too early, when he slips into the bed, and closes his eyes.
, who’s always there with his sarcasm and dry wit, the person that made Steve want to embrace the 21
Hope wants to say and bites her inner-cheek to stop herself. They had relocated three times in the two and a half weeks since Scott was seen growing obscenely and smashing things in a foreign country. She had been keeping tabs with cameras across the street from their house when the first van showed up, and although the design changed routinely (every three to four days), the driver seemed to stay the same.
“I believe Loki Lauffeyson is attempting to breach my security; he claims he knows how to find Enchantress, thus finding Thor and Tony.” Jarvis pulls up a video feed of Stark Tower and sure enough there is Loki, though in civilian clothing, standing idly by the gate. “Any orders?”
patience, and had it in spades for certain situations. The Hank Pym facing down a plain-clothed law enforcement official—because he couldn’t be anything else, not with that kind of posture—on his own porch is not that man. This Hank Pym is
"Wanda!" Clint says, and Wanda groans as she sits up, rubbing the ache in her temples with two fingers. She sits up to take up a single seat and keeps her eyes closed as she waits for the nausea to recede. Clint takes her movement as some sort of sign, maybe, and continues. "We're going on auto for a few, we're gonna hash out a game plan. Thought you might want to be up for this."
If push came to shove, he definitely knew he would be able to subdue her and leave. It seemed like Stark's AI wasn't even installed in the building yet. Something told him, still, whispering behind his reasonings, that he was playing a poker game with only three cards in his hand.
Also, why did the whole Missouri thing not crop up in any movie? Did it get covered in Agents of Shield? 'Cause I'm barely catching up on that so I wouldn't know.
Loki looks up, coughing as Amora encroaches on his prone form. She’s a bundle of aggressive, irrational energy and the power of the Cosmic Cube to back it. Loki knows, logically, that he has a minimal chance of escaping alive or unharmed but damned if he won’t get Thor the hell out of here. He hasn’t caught sight of Captain America with his captive friend and knows, somehow, that things are starting to unravel fast here.
“With each death there is a beginning and end; the powerful cube does portend. The symbols of conclusion and start will reveal the answers that we did conceal.”
“S.H.I.E.L.D. say they want us to come in and give a full report on what happened; Natasha and Peter can handle that, though.” Steve pauses for a moment, waiting for Tony to look at him but the man doesn’t; his petulant gaze remains elsewhere and Steve resists the urge to turn Tony around and force him to see Steve, see the worry and anxiety that eats away at his sanity because Tony just suddenly came into his life, seventy years into the future, and became this-this big, colossal part of Steve’s life, one he thought he could never get back but with Tony it’s easy to be himself; losing Tony would be like losing Bucky again, like losing
"Cameo of a man who has just lost his most valuable possession. He doesn't know about the loss yet. In fact, he doesn't even know about the possession... [b]ut he's going to be thinking a great deal about it from now on, because that is what he's lost. And his search for it is going to take him into the darkest corners..." - Rod Serling, 'Person or Persons Unknown'
But I wouldn’t burn the world to find you. I would deft the military, I would defy the powers that be, but I would never put others in danger because
Steve shrugs and leans further back, fatigue and sleepiness weighing him down. Tony’s back to his tablet but his attention’s already divided so he kicks his feet up on the coffee table, leans back and settles for this; the warmth of Captain America on his side, Peter trying to stick onto the couch comfortably, ‘Tasha’s sudden appearance on the one-seater, Thor banging around in the kitchen and Jarvis’ soft voice announcing the arrival of the rest of the team.
Steve doesn’t look back at Loki as he storms through to the other room. The Sorcerer is busy murmuring to Thor, pressing a hand against the leather straps holding up the blonde. Steve hears the sound of burning and knows that Loki is getting hurt, is getting burned by the magic as he unwinds the spells.
No, no there’s something wrong. The once lulling sense of warmth and comfort is fading fast. He’s flinching at the biting cold that’s warping through his senses and the tinges of black sprouting at the edges of his vision. The images that flashed, bright and effervescent bleed a harsh pigmented and stagnant darkness.
And so Steve remains, shifting his weight from foot to foot, wondering if he should speak up or do something but there's no words coming to him, like the ability to formulate syllables into words has fled. The two continue to chatter and chuckle and have fun and Steve watches with the sickening dawning of an epiphany on his features, wide blue eyes and gaping mouth because--
“We will leave that for tomorrow. As it is, we are very exhausted, and you all look the way you smell.” T’Challa throws one last grin before turning, expecting them to all follow. “Tomorrow will come, everyone. Please, rest at least for now.”
it shouldn’t be possible to cover all of it. She will find a way. She needs to. Maybe someone on her travels will be able to help with this, to see if this was something that would return.
“You’re tilting at windmills,” Tony says with a shrug, sitting slightly forward, “but it’s quite a distance to travel, so why don’t you skip your posturing and get to your point. Assuming, of course, you have one.”
“Anything, just let me save them,” Tony shoves at the prickling, cold sensation that spreads through his body.
He’s tired. He’d like nothing more than to get into bed and sleep for the next century and a half and never look at another goddamn politician’s face again. Vision doesn’t turn to face him as they go down the elevator, but he does speak.
“The building is going to collapse, Captain, we need to leave,” Loki starts, hefting Thor slightly higher with a proprietary arm around the god’s waist. He moves forward, free hand extending, when Steve finally reacts.
On the days where the sun feels too bright, too much like an undeserved prize, and he doesn’t want to leave the bed, he’s grateful when FRIDAY allows Steve entrance to his room.
Tony pulls his mouth away from Steve’s, the need to breathe making it impossible to keep their lips pressed together for one more second.
His hands are performing strange and erratic movements that Tony’s not entirely controlling but it feels good to be moving again, to be uncontrollable like so many people have accused him of being before: uncontrollably arrogant, uncontrollably selfish, uncontrollably reckless.
Like now, Tony in front of the TV waiting for the song that he and Bucky have picked on the karaoke for a duet to start loading, Steve making his way to the kitchen to get Clint, Rhodey and Scott more beers. Their gazes lock and it’s like everything around them slows down, not quite stopping but definitely moving in slow motion. It’s like they’re inside an invisible bubble that only includes them, where their air is different from any one else’s air, where only they are experiencing the world in the same wavelength.
Maybe that’s another one of those little things that Tony’s grown to love so much. It’s the patience and the commitment to getting it right. The desire to do the best they can because what they’re building is worth the effort.
“No, I think you were right,” Tony concedes. “I wasn’t in my right mind and I realize now that you weren’t either. We needed our space.”
“Yeah,” she agrees and stands up, folding the blanket she had been using to cover herself with and resting it on the back of the couch.
“I know,” Steve concedes closing his eyes and exhaling strongly through his nose. “I just don’t understand what is so bad about this.”
Steve’s eyes focus on Tony’s chest and a smirk appears on his lips, “Well, the shirt does look good on you.”
He positions himself with his legs to the side and his upper body turned towards Steve completely. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders and he puts his head down on the right one, his nose touching the skin on Steve’s neck. Steve’s own arms wrap around Tony’s waist, bring his upper body even closer to Steve’s.
Tony takes a seat next to him, to Steve’s left, leaving some space between their bodies but close enough that their knees touch where Steve’s legs are widely spread so he can put his head between them and breathe.
Steve comes to Tony’s room as Tony finishes getting into one of his under-suits. He technically doesn’t need them anymore for the nanites to fit over his skin, but he feels more comfortable getting back into them.
Once upon a time Tony’s first stop after a nightmare -dream?- as unsettling as this one would have been anywhere in his vicinity that could provide him with the strongest alcohol possible. He would have hugged a bottle, a glass, a flask or a pitcher just to numb any sort of feeling. He found, with practice, that alcohol is also a great teacher in the art of denial.
His voice is nothing more than a whisper. His face is dry but the redness and puffiness of his eyes is a telltale sign of his previous crying. He isn’t smiling but his face presents a softness that wasn't there before in the kitchen.
Thor, for the first time in months, brights up during conversations. He gleefully asks Steve and Tony to recount their getting together story time and time again, like he’s absorbing joy through them. He feels so much more like the Thor Tony used to see, the one that lived for other people, the one whose entire personality expanded when he was faced with other people.
“Ready?” Steve asks him and Tony starts walking towards the living room doors that lead to the outside as a response.
Maybe it’s the fact that it’s the perfect reminder that he gets to share his entire life with Tony, maybe it’s the obligatory realization of all the things that have had to happen for them to be celebrating these days together. Maybe it’s simply that every single special day is made even more special when it’s spent with Tony.
And if Tony thinks about it, it probably hadn’t been the best movie pick for times like they were facing.
Tony’s leaving his room one morning when he sees Thor laid down on the couch. His feet are hanging comically from it, the length and width of it obviously too short and small for Thor’s long and big body.
This is the first time Tony hears her voice in person after so long, but before he can look at her and catch a glimpse of her expression the lights turn off and they’re plunged into complete darkness.
She signals to the chair across from where she was sitting and he sits down as she does so too. It leaves them one in front of the other but before they can start talking again a waiter comes by to ask them for their drink order.
Pepper releases all the air she was holding in her lungs and the vibrations of her body are what give away the little laugh she lets out.
He feels dizzy but it’s almost an afterthought, having grown used to it the past couple days. It almost reminds him of the days he would spend locked up in his workshop so absorbed in one of his projects he would forget to eat for hours at a time. The sensation is not exactly the same but that memory is better than remembering how dizzy he’d be after getting waterboarded those first few days in Afghanistan.
Tony hadn’t noticed before but there’s very few sounds around them compared to what they’re normally able to hear on their roams. Only an owl is hooting in the distance and the breeze creates a certain melody from the tussle of the leaves in the trees but the rest of the animals that could be heard when the weather was warmer and more inviting have gone silent, most likely having left the premises by now.
Tony takes her left hand and brings it over to his mouth slowly, kissing the ring on her finger as she smiles down at him.
Steve stays silent as he looks to the side and bites his lip. Tony tracks with his eyes the path of a lone tear that stars rolling down Steve’s chiseled cheekbone.
Tony thinks Steve will plaster his body against his once again but now that they’re both down to their underwear Steve chooses to do something else.
“I said I will take my rematch tomorrow and that’s what I will do,” Tony says. “We’re going to sleep now and tomorrow I’ll win and the day after that… Well, we’ll see what happens the day after that.”
Tony doesn’t speak as he stops in front of Steve, just extends his arm, offering Steve his shield back after more than two years.
Pepper nods and when she moves her head to the right the light reflects on her eyes, letting Tony see the tears gathering in them.
Standing straight again Tony’s back cracks and he groans pleasurably at the feeling while using his own hands to rub the knots and kinks away.
The Avengers are nothing but a mismatch of people brought together out of necessity and this sets Steve off-balance because the team he used to have -the team he lost only a few months ago according to his own living experiences- was more like a family than a simple work group.
Their love, so big and at times so blinding, brings forth so many problems and challenges that maybe, in another world, would only make them stronger but in this one only serve to push them further apart.
“There’s no need for all that,” Steve says. “I just… I needed some time but I’ll call Pepper and Rhodey soon to let them know they don’t have to worry.”
“Alright. We land in Sokovia,” Sam raises both hands to stop Scott and Clint from protesting, “and we lay low. Give it a week, guys, you were both going up against a
She feels a buzz on her skin before she realizes the other presence nearby. Like eyes watching her, following the slow rise and fall of her supposedly sleeping form. Natasha tries to catalog the information she can gleam from the figure while not actively observing.
“I think,” Clint finally speaks up, and Wanda feels like his voice sounds like nails scratching across a chalk board –
excused by the Accords Committee. You’ll find that the United States government is not quite as lenient and more than weary. Without the proof of what happened in Siberia, and with Stark here going AWOL for a bit, well. Call us paranoid—”
"Calm down, Captain Rogers, just lay down and take a few breaths. Everything is okay, they're just checking your health." The man says and his lips curl up into a little smile, pleased. Steve feels inclined to believe him, even for the moment. A voice that's further away says something and The man makes to leave but Steve's hand catches his wrist.
, either. Something inside of his chest wanted to claw out, was effectively suffocating him in the ruins of the house they were hunkered in.
Sometimes it’s easier to think of Steve as this; as this pseudo-modern, old-school young man with scruples when allowing a dame to enter a building first but no qualms when listening to Jan rant about the pros and cons of using a strap on versus a vibrator.
“Ok, give me all the gory details when I arrive back at the tower.” Tony dismisses, flapping a hand up and down in front of Steve’s troubled expression, as if to wave off any and all worries.
!” Tony spits each curse into the whirling messages and sighs as he commands the top-sliding roof to open. He starts up his boots and starts up into the air, sending new commands into the armor.
“I can do that,” Fury agrees, turning around. He looks at the limbs, the headless mannequins. Even without heads, he feels ominously watched. Judged. “Anything else I should keep my eye on?”
He’s too early for this shit. His tailbone is throbbing and his back is stiff and there’s this nagging at the back of Tony’s skull, like a warning or something he’s forgotten but he can’t be expected to think at all when Steve is flirting with him in his bed, half naked.
The air is charged with silence and darkness now, the rich smell of the rain, undertones of ozone and amaranths and earth.
Hm. For a device meant to ping out Asgardian presences, that didn’t bode well. “Yeah,” Jane says, sticking the post it among the pile on the table, “that can’t be right. I guess we’ll try again later.” In the kitchen, next to a leaning tower of dirty bowls, her phone began to chime and vibrate around the counter.
without the bells and whistles of someone official. Hope felt like there was something there, you know, something she couldn’t see but could sense.
isn’t being tired, Tony!” Steve shouts, more exasperated than angry. “You’ve been getting progressively worse; don’t you dare deny it. You don’t sleep, you don’t
Barnes had been digging his hand into the arc reactor, other hand grinding his face into the wall and all Tony could see was—
, Ross?” Rhodey sits up, tilts his head. “Because, historically, Avengers and threats don’t end well.”
what but it’s been a week already and you’re not getting better.” Steve heaves a heavy sigh, pulling off the cowl and looks at Tony with resignation. “I know it’s getting worse, Tony.”
"It is reasonable to believe that the same person responsible for Loki's attack, the Sponsor, so to speak, will arrive to pick up his weapons himself. When the middle man becomes too much of a hassle, well," Fury shrugs, "sometimes a man has to get his hands dirty himself to finish the job."
When Ross is gone, it is Rhodes that speaks first now that they’ve gathered in the only available lounge area that isn’t within the construction zone. “If you’d
Just leaves you wishing a little like it could. Like something in your life will be merciful, for once. He sighs as He pulls the nap sack they’d found full of metal gadgets and small tools that he had emptied for this venture. He starts packing the sack with bottles of water, kicking around wrappers and rubble to see what else he can find.
"I mean...Howard was...no. No, this is fucking stupid. I know that what I did was right." Tony affirms.
It starts now, this bitter grudging camaraderie that is really, really much less than that, even. It's more like tolerating each other's presence for the sake of the team, for the Avengers because Steve is like a soldier mom: he helps make up the tactics, he takes care of the team, makes sure they're taken care of whereas Tony is like that groovy dad that helps you blow shit up, pulls you out of tight spaces, is always there (even when you don't need him, like he knows that something may go wrong) and still manages to seem aloof and unguarded, like he doesn't know he's doing it.
She’s doing her third circle around the perimeter of the mass when she notices that she’s starting to attract second glances. She crosses the next street and then turns into a small Mexican food restaurant. She decides to order something—it is early evening, and although the restaurant is mostly full she’s able to order and find herself a seat at the corner bar to wait for her order.
“I hope you know just how much I love you. And I swear, you’ll know, and I’ll remind you every day because
There are some things that are harder to shake than others, and after enough time running with people that could fly, that transcended time had burned this into her bones. These people had sat down for a late morning at a diner, just like this, and thirteen people had been absorbed into the rolling mass of… whatever it was that spilled over the city and devoured buildings like a massive wave.
Tony reads up on all the history he can as he ratchets up his repulsers to get there faster. He tried to calculate the amount of time he had readily available to spend meandering through the street, interrogating people and maybe paying a visit to the residential psychic. He’d have about three to four hours at most, especially if anything started to happen in the immediate area or if the Avengers would be needed.
Steve rolls his eyes and rips off the shirt, ignoring Tony’s protest in order to wrap the shreds on Tony’s upper arm, pressing another torn fragment into the burnt skin just above the makeshift bandage. Tony pointedly ignored the Super soldier, choosing, rather, to look at the broken and rotting theater seats. Peter’s still babbling about the fight to an eager Thor, Natasha is just slinking down the aisle, eying everything in sight. They’re a bit off towards the other end of the front screening area, their words incomprehensible from where the two are.
“Antony! The night with the armor made of iron, what possesses you to speak through the invisible receiver directly to my own person?”
“Yeah, Amora, she got away when she struck you in the shoulder with god knows what kind of acid, when we came in she threw it, it popped, you just kind of stood there and hen Peter tried to attack back she disappeared into the wall.”
“FRIDAY says that rendering will take a minute,” Rhodey says at last, “because you have her mostly… looking at old SHIELD dump files you pulled?”
“You go for your comrade. Leave the rest to me. She has a relic that is beyond her control, beyond the control of any being. Do not try to fight her.”
He gives Pepper a curious glance. She's sitting next to him, any uncomfortableness masked by the amount of annoyed tapping she's doing on her StarkTablet. She looks bothered, stressed, and a little undone, if he is to be reasonable, but she had herded him into the inconspicuous Honda around the corner. He tries to wrap his head around the idea that, still recovering from the horrors of extremis, this one woman still went out of her comfort to help. To save others, whether she approved of Stark’s own heroics.
Steve doesn’t sleep at all tonight. He thinks of Tony, captured by a mad woman in love and shudders.
She has only one destination she is currently trying to reach: St. Charles, Missouri. She had picked up whispers about something happening, and although her sense told her to
“Not… precisely. Maybe Vision did send Wanda the message.” Steve glances towards the hanger, “in which case, I think I’m more worried about… about the fact that he felt he had to tell Ross our location. How did he even know? Why are their hands tied?”
Steve only grunts and nods, still facing down. Sam sighs, turns and sits across from Steve as Scott shrugs and finds a seat to curl up on. Clint trudges by to the cockpit. Sam tilts his head back and closes his eyes.
The first time Steve finds Tony in his workshop, he was simply following the blaring, raunchy music that seemed to be exploding from every pore of the mansion. He took the steps two at a time, the glass doors slid across seamlessly and stared at the figure at the workbench a few meters ahead. Tony was bobbing his head, wearing an oil-stained white muscle shirt, his chest partially lit blue and his eyes glued to the bauble in his hands like it might just explode (which was an actual possibility, sadly).
Wanda dreams. The team plans now that they're out of the Raft and into the frying pan. Natasha gets some answers and finds something to do. Maybe it's an excuse or maybe it isn't--maybe something big happened in St. Charles, Missouri. She just... she needs to know before she continues forward.
“Twice I have found myself lost in thought, and both times… I imagined the Rogue Avengers, through one of their eyes.” Vision says airily. “I have spoken to Colonel Rhodes on this, and he believes my solutions may lie in London.”
He had written it all out, neatly and nicely in a post-mission report. Increased anxiety, returned trauma. Something about a species made to be weapons, which is how they were defeated: not meant to think individually, each alien was bred as a weapon. Who had been at the other end of the barrel?
But when it came time, when he pulled off Rhodey’s faceplate, after he’d hit Falcon with a repulsor blast—
“The wind and the trees call me their own;  I am the apples, and the tree. I am youth, rejuvenation, beauty. Iðunn, they whisper, Idonae they say.” The woman smiles and she’s just so out of place in this warped reality.
: the concoction of man in order to control nature, tame it, yet it is nature itself that dictates the rise and fall, the ebb and flow of humanity and the universe in and of itself.
The first cup goes down without notice, as does the second and third. Tony’s leaning against the counter, working on his fourth cup when Jarvis’ voice pipes up from the silence, shattering any peace and tranquility.
“I believe that I may be of assistance in this manner.” Jarvis pipes up and wow, if Steve didn’t know any better than he’d think that Jarvis was
"You forgot about that," Pepper says, weary. "The others, they forgot about that. Maria Hill didn't. The SHIELD agents working security and in the private sector with all new identities didn't, either. Somehow, everyone's moral compass went out of whack and began to point 'Steve Rogers', and everything else outside was forgotten." Pepper looks less angry and simply world-worn. She deflates, just a bit, before taking those last few steps forward. Fury follows, silent.
I hope I tagged this as canon divergence 'cause. Well. Okay, I think Wanda was handled horribly, there was so much more they could have done with even JUST the Tesseract, and when I hear Infinity Wars, I want a whole lot more than like... three or four four-man squads as being the "focal" groups alright. Also, this is a shorter chapter than what I usually write. Just gonna throw that out there.
, for all that matters to you. What was it that I told you the first time, Iron Man Yes, Tony Stark—"
here is going to catch us all up on the rundown since we’ve been in the Raft. Because, Steve, I get you, but we need to know what has happened with Barnes and we need more than just ‘Wakanda is off limits because T’Challa says so’ as a reason because we fought by your side to protect your friend and we want to know why he ain’t here anymore.”
He wonders now, and surprisingly for the first time, if he should have forced a full report out of Romanov. Something about the entire situation felt... oddly edged. He heard about Zemo, a bit, about the framing of the bombing in Vienna.
“I need your help,” Tony thinks savagely, feels the ground begin to rumble beneath his body. “I want to save everyone.” Amora’s hand claws at Tony’s arm, but he doesn’t pay her any heed. The shaking slows, and Tony feels it. Feels this presence, and he knows it’s the cube, the energy reaching out; he knows by Clint’s explanation of how it felt to be under the cube’s power, its influence.
and he has no need to lie to himself or anyone else for that matter, Tony might have sulked in his room for the hour that Steve remained in his lab. Maybe. Just a little. Besides, there’s no proof (because he got JARVIS to erase the video feed) and for all he cares no one even bothered to try to find out what was going on.
“—it needs to be soon, though, because you guys need to be leaving in the morning, and someone needs to give Foster a heads up or Darcy is going to have some fun tazing people, and I need to catch up with the Spiderling before Queens gets under attack by another weird animal, like a python princess or a porcupine or something. And that’s by tonight,” Tony says, low and rushed. “So meet me in the lab maybe... twenty minutes?”
Tony seemed to let off this arrogant front and in all brutal honesty he was just snarky, rude and flagrant in what it was he wanted; it was almost impossible to get any other words besides “egotistical” and “genius” (except from Fury, who seemed to have every word available to man synonymous to “narcissistic” and a broad study of psychology that he seamlessly attached to Stark without batting his eye) from anyone else.
. You are the beauty of mortality; you have been tainted with violence yet you search for peace, fight for the common wealth, for redemption. You’re impulsive perfection, beautifully flawed, disastrously perfect. You are fiendish in your vain ambitions, heavenly in your wiles, but you fear and regret so heartily; so impeccably
When Tony opens his eyes a second time, a few hours later, he is still in the emergency medical lab he was the first time. At least this time he’s saved the tube down the throat. He lets his gaze drift before it lands on Vision.
any sense of his true self it's with a low grouse, a drawn out complaint that's lost to the darkness of the night. Steve is leaning under the windowsill, sketchbook over his criss-crossed legs, a soft charcoal pencil tucked in his ear, a kneaded eraser beside his foot, a compressed charcoal stick resting on the heavy pages. He can't tell if he dozed off at some point or if he's been too immersed in thought but suddenly there is no moonlight in the window and Tony Stark is leaning back against the door frame between the living room and the dining room, in a sleek black suit, jacket tossed on a chair in the foreground and white dress shirt untucked and partially unbuttoned from the collar, his tie loose around his exposed throat and collar bone, all washed in the dim blue light of his arc reactor.
“Captain Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes have broken into and taken the fugitives remaining in the Raft. During his escape, whichever technological hack they used to get in also fried FRIDAY’s bug in the system.”
“These, great Antony, are the Landvættir, kind and gently spirits of the land that promote thriving of the land that they guard.”
“Alright.” All attention flies to Steve. Steve's rubbing the edge of his Shield that's slung across his back; he looks at each of them before speaking, tone completely serious and commanding. “Black Widow, Spiderman: I want you two to go and report to Fury; Thor, try and get any information from Asgard if you can; I’m taking Ironman to the medical wing and then we’re supposed to meet with S.H.I.E.L.D to get any more information. Understood?” Steve looks around for any comments but the team simply remains silent.
. Both brothers perished, hand in hand, together in the carefully executed void she died to create, for if she could not have him then
“Captain, there’s been a breach in the building. Security code: 2704; all R&D Floors to be locked and closed for 48 hours. The main entrance shall now be locked; Amora the Enchantress has been located within the building and both Master Stark and Odinson are missing.”
“I don’t—there’s his voice that’s talking to me, some woman and she- she shows me these things and, god, they’re disgusting, they’re absolutely horrible and I can’t tell if it’s real or a nightmare or what the hell is going on but I can’t do it. There’s a savior that’s supposed to arise from all of this and I don’t know what the hell I am doing.” Tony snorts but the sound is shallow. “So there. You heard it from the horse’s mouth and all.” Tony grins and Steve turns, his eyes so full of emotion. It’s his paparazzi smile, Steve thinks, and well if that isn’t fucked up.
Steve looks weary. His hair if ruffled from the flight, his eyes are a little dull and glazed over as he spaces out and his hands move slowly to gently put down Tony’s limp body. The sigh he lets out is tired in a decidedly different way and the look he gives Tony is different than the furtive little glances he catches on the outskirts of his peripheral vision, different than the worried stares, annoyed eye-rolls and the braver looks Steve has ever given him.
“You didn’t show me for nothing, Miss Potts,” He says at last, mind wrapping around her last sentence. Not extremis, then, but something along the lines. Something that would make him a danger to outside forces, to the Accords, perhaps. “What do you want, in return?”
Steve looks equally shattered and at peace. Like the words at the tip of his tongue are burning to be muttered but are impossible to articulate. His eyes slide close as his hands brush down from Tony’s shoulders to his collar bone, arc up to his neck and cradle the base of his skull. He’s moved in the process from sitting beside Tony to almost completely covering the unconscious man with his body and his head tips forward, the two resting forehead to forehead.
“Tony!”, Steve cries out but it’s too late, the building is collapsing and the wooden beams all creak and groan as they fall to pieces, shatter into small splinters that  seem to freeze in midair. “Tony!”
feel a goddamn tube in my throat for the rest of my life. I need to make sure Ross didn’t rustle enough feathers with the UN, or the Accords Council, I need to check on the Spiderling, and we still have those drafted amendments… I have to change the timeline now that we don’t have evidence for the Raft—”
as Tony berates himself then rebuilds his confidence only to shatter it once more. Steve almost misses the way Tony's fingers absentmindedly brush the glass cover of the arc reactor and the almost whisper that follows.
I’m a fucking mess, you’re, you… look, I’m not saying that Rogers had a point, but I will say that… maybe if it had been flipped, if it had been you we were looking for… I would have razed everything to the ground and damn anyone that tried to get in my way.”
"Perhaps this is no longer the moment for snark and vagueness," Fury says softly, "I'm here to check in on Stark, to see what kind of dirt Romanov was implying that could be important enough to cause Stark to get into bed with the likes of Ross."
Tony shrugs. “I like to know my wildcards. I hadn’t expected them to go fugitive instead of just… leaving Scott out to hang. I didn’t do my research well enough, I guess.”
to complain or fight back. By the time he has the will to ask where they’re heading, Thor had turned a giant grin to him and simply answered, as if they were heading to the corner market, “Asgard!”
“So I moved to NY and changed my name. My friend Rhodey is the only person who knows where I am because he helped me rent the house I’m in. I’m afraid of what would happen if my legal guardian found me, so that’s why I changed my last name. Now, if you don’t mind”, Tony said, getting up and putting on his jacket, “I’d like to go home. Nice meeting you all”.
Agent Coulson got up, buttoning his suit, and walked towards the wall, where a map suddenly appeared.
inside the building had to have heard it too. He ran as far as he could, but his body was still weak from the paralysis, still not quite responding to Tony’s commands the way it should.
Steve had fought alongside many different people throughout his career as a SHIELD agent. There were men who hesitated at the sight of danger, no matter how many times missions they’d been in. There were men who forgot all reason, who ran towards the danger, all guns blazing, without much of a care about their own wellbeing. Bucky had told Steve, more than once, that he was exactly like that.
A very loud, mechanical noise was coming from the next clearing. They couldn’t quite see what it was exactly, but they could tell it was big. They exchanged a worried look, thinking back on what Dr. Strange had said about some beast they were suppose to defeat, and started down the pathway, looking apprehensive. Upon reaching the end of the path, they finally saw it. A gigantic machine in the form of a beetle was standing in the middle of the clearing, blocking their way to what appeared to be the edge of the forest. The beetle turned around every so often, smoke coming out of its head, stomping its big foots on the floor.
“They don’t control our actions, only the environment. We have these dices, you see”, Peter replied, showing him the very colorful dices on the table, “we roll them to see who goes first, if a spell or an attack works or not, and how much damage we’re inflicting”.
“Whoever this girl is, I’m guessing she really wants us to read some files”, he said, looking for answers.
“Steve”, Bucky said on the other side of the line, “I’m in the bathroom closer to the entrance. Get your ass in here, we have a problem”.
Eventually, the waitress came to bring their water and take their orders. Tony chose the salmon while Steve ordered the steak. When she left, they returned to their conversation.
Meanwhile, Director Carter had brought Tony up to speed with the whole investigation. They had locked themselves in her office and talked for hours while Steve and Bucky waited outside. In the end, the genius had taken less than ten minutes to come up with a device that would allow Natasha to successfully hack Stane’s computer and get all the evidence they needed. He assured his aunt Peggy that the device – and the program – would be ready by the end of the day and left, throwing Steve a longing look and a smile on his way out.
Tony took Morgan from the floor and sat her in his lap, smiling, “You know, Moguna, I once ate cookie dough with a stranger in the middle of a supermarket”.
There was a knock on the door. Tony frowned, putting the glasses and the wine on the coffee table, before going to the door. It couldn’t be the delivery man; he always rang the doorbell downstairs and waited until someone let him in.
as he strode towards him. Tony lifted his head, meeting Steve’s eyes as the blond sat down on the chair in front of him with a determined look.
“It says here she started showing signs of telepathic and telekinetic powers at age seven, so they tested her to see how far the powers went. They talk about range and strength and possible ways to counter the power, discussing the validity of using some rare alloy, same as the one Magneto used on his helmet, and… drugs. Shit”.
“I’m not here about your electronic security shit and you know that”, she said forcefully, stepping in front of him as to not let him escape, “You can talk to me now and be free to live your life, or you can tell your story in court. Your choice”.
“You don’t get to tell me that, Rogers”, Tony replied, getting up and looking into Steve’s eyes as he softly caressed his face, “You died, Steve. You died and I just…”
He turned to his right, watching as the elevator doors suddenly opened and laughed upon seeing a very sheepish Steve walking out of it with one bag on each hand.
. He put his head back, completely hidden behind the cabinet, and closed his eyes, trying to visualize the whole building in his mind. The elevator was too far away and he would probably run into ‘crazy man with a gun’ if he tried to get there. The stairs were a closer and safer option. He could run down a few floors and then take the elevator all the way down. He could do this. He just needed to run down the hallway, pass his godfather’s dead body, turn right, run a bit more and he’d get to the stairs.
The moment they arrived at school, Tony knew something was wrong. He walked in with his friends right behind him and noticed how everybody kept glancing at him.
The trickster god, however, merely raised an eyebrow once more. And then, a smile slowly appeared on his lips.
GREETINGS, MY FRIENDS. I SEE THE GOOD CAPTAIN HAS DECIDED TO WED THE MAN OF IRON. A MUCH JOYOUS OCCASION. I HAVE ALREADY BESTOWED MY CONGRATULATIONS UPON THE SON OF STARK OVER THIS HAPPY NEWS.
“I do not understand. I thought the Midgardian custom was to present your beloved with a ring, not a watch”.
Tony didn’t answer, merely turning his head towards the window once more, watching the clouds go by. Steve got up then and sat beside Tony, pulling his whole body towards himself and resting his head on the engineer’s. He felt the younger man tense under his touch for a moment and then suddenly relaxing, as if finally giving up. They exchanged no more words about the matter, but stayed like that for the rest of the trip, simply holding hands and feeling each other’s warmth.
Wanda dreams restlessly. She can feel the spit of the seats pressing into her side from where she lays over two of them in a fetal position, of sorts, with her knees tucked into her chest and one arm bent to pillow her head as the other holds onto the next seat over. She can hear everyone's voice in the cockpit and the low hum of the Quinjet beneath it all.
“Well, nothing, really; though my people do have prophesies of the Ragnarök, in which many of us will fall in battle with strong foes. It will be an end to our era of rulers and the start of a new era. It is prophesized that my father will meet defeat to Fenrir, who will swallow him whole.” Thor doesn’t look a smidgeon bothered.
“Raining cats and dogs? Who even says that?” the other man laughed, cleaning his hands on a dirty rag before throwing it at a nearby table, “So, what happened?” he asked, nodding his head in the direction of the car.
“So… We can do this, right?” he asked with a worried look, “I mean, we could just call off the whole thing”.
“In my entire career as a SHIELD agent and then Director, I’ve killed five men. I do not approve of senseless killing. I believe all men deserve a fair trial. Well… Not
Steve’s eyes meet Tony’s and they simply sat there for what seemed like several minutes, just staring into each other’s eyes. Before they knew it, their foreheads were touching, noses bumping, lips so close to one another they could smell each other’s mint breath. Tony closed his eyes, starting to move forward, his lips slightly touching Steve’s for just a second before the captain’s voice filled the plane, making both men jump in surprise.
“You know what’s insane?”, Tony suddenly said, raising his head to look at Bucky, “The fact that you don’t seem to realize how insane it is that you ran a background check on someone your friend has been seeing for less than two weeks! It was a complete invasion of privacy and, honestly? It’s creepy as fuck.”
Pain. That was all Tony knew in that moment. A kind of pain that he’d never experienced before in his life, the kind that burned his insides, twisted his guts and pressed on his bones, as if wanting to break them into tiny pieces. He trashed around the small cot, or at least he tried to. He turned his head to look at his hands and found both were bound by metal chains. His breathing became even more erratic and he felt the tears streaming down his face as he tried to scream through the rag stuffed in his mouth.
“I know. Sam chewed me out for that. So did Coulson. They want to apologize to you as well, by the way. They were pretty pissed at me after what happened”.
“And then you told Thor and T’Challa and Natasha and everybody else to, what, flirt with me in front of Steve?”
Before Agent Hill could answer, the doors on the far side of the corridor opened to reveal a very dirty Anthony on a wheelchair, followed closely by his Lieutenant friend and the Captain himself. Margaret quickly walked towards her godson, kissing his bandaged forehead carefully.
“TONY?” He exclaimed, opening the stalls. The men yelped and screamed, telling Steve to fuck off, but he paid them no mind.
“Well, this was… Not fun at all and I need a drink. Or four”, Bucky said, taking of his tie and grabbing his girlfriend’s hand, “Anyone up for some champagne? I feel like celebrating the fact that I didn’t in fact marry down”.
“Damn, man. It was literally killing me inside to stay here and wait around. But, you know, I figured you had everything under control and it’s best if he doesn’t know there’s a third spy, right?”
Hey guys, I'm so sorry this took so long! My grandmother had to move to a new house and she had an infection and my grandpa spent the week at that hospital and I've been running back and forth these past two weeks helping my grandparents and my mom with everything. It was a nightmare!!
It took Natasha a good fifteen minutes to land the helicopter near the exploded area. She waited inside as the others fought through the dark smoke, covering their mouths and noses as they walked inside what seemed to be a former war camp. There were bodies everywhere, melted faces and body parts scattered around as if it was some gruesome horror movie. The smell of burned flesh was unbearable.
… Tony seized the moment and entered one of the offices, hiding himself between the wall and a big filing cabinet.
Steve blinked, utterly confused at Bucky’s behavior. He opened his mouth to answer, but closed it again when he noticed everyone was looking at them.
“What else was in that will, Tony?” Matthew called their attention to the subject at hand once more.
Wasn't that exactly what she thought whenever the memories of Yasha filled her mind? She'd most likely never have closure, never have peace, where Yasha was concerned... But maybe Stark could.
The table was covered with boxes of food and beverages. There were dumplings mixed with Kung Pao Chicken, slices of pizza, buckets of fried chicken and sushi. Tony watched, fascinated, from the kitchen as Steve and the rest of the gang dug in, eating a bit of this and a bit of that.
Coulson huffed, shaking his head. “One more kiss only in the corridor, Stark, Rogers. And keep it PG-13. This is not some teen movie High School. This isn’t Hannah Montana”.
He zoomed in on one of the corridors, showing two small figures. “Meet Jack Rollins and Brock Rumlow. Stane hired them a week ago and they’re not in SI’s payroll. And it gets worst…” Tony looked at Steve with an apprehensive look. “They work for HYDRA Corp”.
“They need to have at least one copy, otherwise the will becomes null. As the deceased’s son, Tony has a right to view the will. Once we get our hands on a copy, we’ll file for suspicion of undue influence or forgery”, Matthew explained, “I believe we have enough to get a judge’s attention, at least. And, about your parent’s accident and the lawyer’s murder, I can try and request the reports on the investigation. I have a friend on the force, he owns me a favor”.
“If Murdock says she can be trusted then she can be trusted. He’s even more of a paranoid freak than Fury”, Bucky replied.
They all jumped when a sudden, very loud clap of thunder filled the clearing. Smoke appeared out of nowhere and the gang covered their eyes, coughing. Finally, the white smoke dissipated and they noticed a tall figure in the middle of it.
Ross turned back to the doctor, looking livid. “This is a secret facility, Dr. Connely. Do you really expect me to bring them here? To show them what we’ve done? Do you think Bruce Banner will agree with what was done here? Do you think Steve Rogers will?”
“When you expose Stane, Stark Industries is going to take a pretty big hit. We’ll lose credibility, investors, buyers… I have to be there. I can’t let the company fall under because of that sick asshole”.
Steve walked over to Tony and stopped close to him, slightly bending over to get his head closer to his stomach.
It took Steve a moment to remember what he was supposed to say. “Yes, but I always carry an umbrella?”
Bucky shook his head with a smile, “Dude, we go together and I’m gonna flirt with her. I’m gonna throw the full Bucky charm on her”.
Also, if you liked it, leave a comment and follow me on tumblr! I'm thinking of doing a series of drabbles and I'd love to have some readers over there ;D
“We’re more of the take names, kick ass variety, if you know what I mean”, Bucky replied, taking a sip from his water bottle.
Jessica nodded. “Stane probably paid them off. Who’s the he in this story? The guy who scared you into doing this?”
“The restaurant is all yours tonight”, the hostess replied with a smile, “Mr. Rogers called ahead and asked us to book the whole place”.
“I’m sorry, Stevie. But Greg checked their database for an Anthony Carbonell and the only one he found was some Italian rich type who died before this kid was even born. So, forgive us for being overprotective of you, but this piece of shit is lying to you about who he is”.
The man was running. He looked behind him, trying to see if the shadow was still following him. He could see nothing. His glasses had fallen off somewhere. He tripped and fell, his face hitting the pavement first with such force his nose immediately broke.
Everything looked exactly the same, from the furniture to the big vase full of cherry blossoms, his mother’s favorite flower, on the nearby table. He half expected to see his mother coming out of the kitchen, Jarvis right behind her, as they discussed flower arrangements and drinks and canapes for whatever party she was throwing that week. He felt his eyes filling with tears and smiled softly at the memory.
“I just… I know it’s a lot to ask, but… Can we try again? I’ll be better this time, I promise. I just… I love you. And I miss you so much. Please”, he whispered, looking at Tony with a pained look.
“… and I recently graduated MIT Summa Cum Laude. I was about to start my second PhD, but my parents died so I had to quit”.
And with that, Steve shoved the last piece of waffle in his mouth while putting his plate inside the dishwasher and left with a final wave.
“If I may interrupt, sirs… The others have an interesting theory about that. They think perhaps the spell did more than just erase the Captain’s memories, but also blocked something in his mind, making him incapable of falling in love with you again, boss”.
bad. Tony, in particular, looked like someone had stabbed him in the stomach. He excused himself and quickly left the room.
“It wasn’t your fault. And Bucky and I talked so we’ll be fine eventually”, the mechanic replied, shrugging, and then sighed, “I’m sorry I didn’t answer your calls. Or your texts”.
“That’s… Wow. You must be some kind of genius or something”, Steve teased, putting his hands in his pockets.
“Savages, all of them”, Natasha whispered as she walked behind him towards the fridge to get a beer.
They followed the Lieutenant inside one of the barracks and into a small room. There was a table in the middle of it, with four plates of food lying around. Clint quickly sat down and took one, stuffing his mouth with whatever it was the plate contained, looking quite happy.
Natasha simply rolled her eyes and took Clint by the collar of his suit, “We’ll go check the Rooms. You two check the Labs and we’ll meet back here. Got it?”
As always, if you like this, leave kudos and a comment! I'm in dire need of good things cause life has been awful these past weeks, and comments always make me happy! ❤️
Life has not been easy, my friends. I had to write this chapter between sessions and during the late night, so forgive any mistakes. Don't forget to leave some comments, so I can read them and feel that the work I put into it wasn't in vain lol
“Ok, just… JARVIS, please scan the very real human skull on my table and run the facial reconstruction program. Hack the PD database and try to match the results with any missing person pictures in the area”.
Steve looked confused. “Uh, yeah. I thought you would appreciate it, you know, being a mechanic and well”.
Iron Man and Captain America exchanged a worried look. Tony dropped the faceplate just as Steve grabbed his shield from his back.
thing, he couldn’t exactly tell people what he did or who he really was, which made dating so very hard. Not to mention the shared life experiences. The only other person who could ever understand what he had gone through was Bucky and he was very straight. But now, now, here he was, with a very handsome man not much younger than him asking him out with a smile. He had given up so much of his life already. He didn’t think he could do it anymore.
“I’ve been around you long enough to know that you’re about to come up with a really bad plan”, she replied with a suffering sigh.
. It should be operational within a few weeks”, Stane said, gesturing to what seemed to be a simple missile.
Tony stood there for a moment, staring at the closed elevator. He felt a hand on his shoulder and jumped a bit, turning.
“It’s fine. Here”. It was only when he pulled the chain with Steve’s dog tags over his head that the soldier finally noticed something different in it. A ring, a simple golden band shining amidst the silver. Bucky took them for Tony, feeling his hand shake a little as he stared at it.
“It’s good to see you again, Steve”, Richard Reed said, shaking Steve’s hand with gusto. Sue did the same.
And as Tony continued to cry, hugging the blonde tightly, face buried on his neck, Steve kept on stroking his hair, whispering in his ear…
“Right. Dude, that day was wild. I mean, can you believe you guys have been together for a year, and happily together, all thanks to an accident?”
It was like fight club, but with more fellatio. Steve was grateful for it, in a way, because talking about what’d happened would mean telling Tony how he felt, ruining their friendship in the process, and Steve just couldn’t afford that. He didn’t’ think he was strong enough to lose Tony… Hell, he couldn’t even picture his life without the man in it anymore. Or Morgan, for that matter. Every plan he made for the future had them in it somehow. He knew he couldn’t get what he really wanted, but he was resigned to his fate. He would be happy just being Morgan’s uncle Steve and Tony’s friend for the rest of his life. That was fine. He was fine.
“How I lost it? I was cutting up some carrots and just got a bit carried away”, Bucky said in a deadpan tone, making Steve snort so loud in laughter that the scientists nearby stopped to glare at them.
She nodded, raising an eyebrow. “Maybe I do. Why exactly would you like that most valuable piece of information, Barnes?”
Steve opened his mouth to talk, but suddenly remembered Tony’s request for him to play along. With a roll of his eyes, he turned to his friends.
The gang looked at him, completely baffled, before whooping and clapping, while Harvey took a bow. However, they were interrupted by an arrow that missed Ned’s head by an inch. Michele immediately turned to the source and raised her hand in said direction. The air around them suddenly became heavy and a smell of what they assumed was sulfur filled their noses. A red ball of light shot from Michele’s hand, hitting the goblin who had just attacked them right on the head. Everyone groaned and turned away as his head exploded in a thousand pieces.
“Yes. He said some SI worker gave him some pictures. We were just about to call you and Director Carter to tell you, actually”.
amused”, he said, smiling when he heard Steve laugh. The blonde pulled him closer and they both walked to the kitchen, taking plates and glasses and bringing them to the living room.
“I really think they would rather celebrate alone, Clint”, Natasha informed her friend while hugging and congratulating Tony.
On Sunday, nothing came. No phone call, no gift, no note, nothing. Maybe Steve had finally given up, realized Tony wasn’t worth the hassle and it was better to just take this opportunity to get out of the relationship he never even wanted in the first place. Tony was fine with that. He was
“I’m dead, make space, losers”, a voice suddenly appeared. Bucky sat between Nat and Pepper, quickly stealing his girlfriend’s cake and shoving it in his mouth.
, he would show up unannounced, already taking his clothes off as soon as the blond opened the door, and he would forget all of this troubles as Steve tore him apart, kissing every inch of his body and pressing him roughly against the mattress as he slammed his cock inside Tony again and again and again until the brunette was covered in cum, murmuring nonsense as he came back from his high, completely and utterly satisfied.
She ran for the elevator before it could close, making herself almost invisible on the back. Thinking about her past would bring nothing but bad memories and anger, so it was best to leave it locked in a little box inside her mind.
“I overheard a conversation. You were right. Afghanistan was a trap. He wanted the boy dead. I didn’t hear the other end of the conversation, unfortunately, but I’m betting the Ten Rings are now very interested in Tony and what he can do”.
It was Tony’s turn to shake his head with a sigh. “Aunt Peggy is always worried. Look, I’m not gonna make your job difficult, okay? And I’m not gonna tell her I know either”.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Come on, let’s get the hell out of here. We have a lot to discuss”, he said, glancing at the little girl.
Tony throws a party, is tricked by a beautiful spy and decides to trust someone unexpected, if only just a bit.
Throughout the years, Margaret kept her promise. She was there for every birthday, every Christmas and every Easter. She taught her little boy how to behave like a proper gentleman and how to make proper tea.
Clint snorted. “Okay, but that complicates things, right? How are we going to make Steve fall in love with Tony if there’s something blocking it or whatever?”
They found Tony sitting in the waiting area, hands on his head, crying softly. Wanda was sitting beside him. She looked up when she noticed the others approaching and threw them a very sad look, pursing her lips.
Tony drank the coffee slowly, moaning when the delicious liquid finally touched his tongue, burning his throat as it went down. Steve adjusted his legs, clearly uncomfortable as his dick sprung to life again.
. They rode in silence, holding hands as the elevator went up. The blonde kept sneaking glances at Tony, frowning when he noticed how sad his partner looked. He didn’t say anything, though. Just exited the elevator, still holding Tony’s hand, and they both walked to their room in silence.
“Actually, Tony took care of that too. He hired this awesome chef to make all the food and the cake and the sweets”.
tell you how the company is doing these days… You’re losing clients left and right. You had to make deals with losers like Justin Hammer because you’re desperate. Because you may be a good ‘money man’, Obie, but, without me, you have nothing. Without me, you don’t have state of the art weapons, you don’t have technological marvels that change the world… You’re losing all your contracts because you can’t show them anything new. You’re falling behind and you’re desperate and your last chance to pull one over is to tell the military that the Jericho works”.
“I feel like I’m dying, everything hurts.” He rubs his eyes with his fists and blinks a couple of times to clear his vision and he swears he caught a glimpse of a fond smile painting Natasha’s lips. “Don’t even think of making a joke about my age.”
“Do you want to…?” Tony doesn’t finish formulating the question but the way he presses his ass into Steve’s lap, rocking back and forth on his dick, is more eloquent than a thousand words could be.
Steve, with his presence and his question and his not allowing Tony the chance to run away or deflect, is telling him he wants to help, that he will help.
“Well,” she says as she moves a couple of steps away from Steve now that he’s no longer coughing. “The hand holding. The intense looks. The smiles. You’ve been doing it all night.”
Tony’s eyes fill with tears and he thinks about reaching forward and putting a hand on Steve’s back but he doesn't do it.
The first day of August does hit the Compound like a summer storm, even when the weather outside is sunny and clear all around.
He takes the sweatshirt first and pulls it over his head. His nose catches the familiar scent in a second -a little earthy and a little deep- and it confirms Tony’s suspicions about the sweatshirts’s ownership. If that wasn’t enough, the fact that the item of clothing hangs from Tony’s body and the sleeves go way past his hands is also more than enough hint.
The work Steve is doing with his mouth is quickening the pace of Tony’s breathing, his stomach rising and falling quickly while Steve sucks marks into it. When Steve makes it to Tony’s belly-button he sneaks his tongue in quickly and then pulls it away to smack a loud and silly kiss to it, making Tony giggle ridiculously at him.
“Oh my god, I am going to invest in getting you a bell that you’ll have to wear all day, every day. This cannot be healthy for me. Heart condition, remember?”
Rhodey says Steve’s one of the funniest people he has ever met. Steve doesn't think this is one of the things most people would comment on about him but his and Rhodey’s sense of humor match almost perfectly. They’re both sarcastic but it’s a little dry, almost too serious to be understood as real humor some times.
Steve moves his head so he can look at Tony through his eyelashes and the picture he paints should be illegal in all states, Tony thinks. He looks debauched and angelic all at once, his blue eyes bright and his wet smile joyous. Tony brings his fingers to Steve’s lips and he traces the outline of them delicately. Steve captures two of Tony’s fingers with his mouth and he sucks thoroughly on them, his cheeks hollowing as his tongue works around the digits.
Special thanks to Jaime -once again- for his support and his beta work. This story wouldn't be possible without you! All remaining mistakes are mine and mine alone.
Natasha goes to the bathroom twice and Tony laments out-loud still having to depend on a catheter, and when she stands up for a third time she brings him a plate with a few apple slices to cheer him up.
It’s getting harder to breathe with his nose pressed completely to Pepper’s neck so Tony moves to rest his chin upon Pepper’s shoulder. His face is now facing forwards but his eyes are still closed until a the clearing of a throat captures his attention.
He can feel it strongly now, the pull towards oblivion and rest. He knows he should be fighting it and he wants to, he want to so much, but he knows he can’t. He’s not powerful enough to resist the siren call and… What would he be fighting for, anyway? The opportunity to live another day in this goddamn awful space ship?
Valkyrie huffs and rolls her eyes -obviously not pleased with the sentimentality of it all- but she doesn't raise any objections.
“I should have been the one giving the epic, romantic speech, right?” Tony says, sniffing a little bit and raising one shoulder and then the other to dry his cheeks.
When Steve looked around he noticed that his friends had moved a couple of feet away, giving him and Tony a little bit of privacy.
Not everything they talk about during their walks is revealing or significant, it’s not even always serious. They’ve had more than one conversation about Steve’s loves for YA novels, Steve narrating the entire plot of them back to Tony. They’ve laughed way too many times at stupid jokes and puns by the lake. Other times they’ve reminisced together about some of the happy memories they share, reminding themselves that their acquaintanceship and friendship hasn’t constantly been marked by jabs and blows.
It becomes unavoidable during dinner when Natasha is telling them of the contracts Stark Industries signed with one of her charities to provide them with free hospital machinery for one of their locations in Europe.
His speech is slurred but his voice is just as commanding as Tony has always remembered it. It fills the entire room even when his posture makes him look small somehow. It’s obvious that he has gained weight, his body no longer the perfect specimen Tony always wondered if magic kept. This image of him makes him look so much more human that Tony has ever thought him to be.
“Remember that time at a charity event when Tony spent more than an hour flying kids around on the suit?” Rhodey asks, his voice sounding heavier than before. “He wouldn’t go higher than a couple inches from the ground but the kids went crazy.”
But while the drawing Dummy has created might not be an iconic piece of art it still makes Steve feel proud and delighted. Only two weeks ago Dummy dropped any crayon he tried to hold for longer than three seconds and now, he’s refining his movements and his traces. It’s such a silly little thing but Steve knows Dummy views it as an accomplishment by the way he twirls around twice every time he finishes a picture and that makes Steve all the more happy.
Instead the talk has opened Steve up in a way Tony couldn’t have predicated. It’s like Steve’s ribcage has been forced open and Tony can see inside him without Steve’s consent.
(It’s finally feeling like he’s not a tourist visiting a new century that will never belong to him but a true local once again. It’s making the 21st century his own and fitting into it in a way he hadn’t before.
That is why once Natasha plants the seed, Tony can’t stop thinking about his apparent obsession with wearing Steve’s clothes.
“The Tower is being renovated of the damage it suffered in the battle but we could… We could arrange it so you’d have rooms there, a floor for each of you. For the whole team,” she explains. “We could make it a headquarters of sorts. I don’t know… Something like an Avengers Tower?”
During the course of the night, Steve’s t-shirt is forgotten in its place on the floor and neither of them care much about it
For a second Tony thinks of pressing the button again and not doing it. It seems like resignation and giving up and admitting to himself that this it it, the end, no more coming back from it. But his fear trumps his pride for once and he takes a deep breath before he starts to speak.
Carol, Bruce, Rhodey, Steve, Natasha. Even Clint, sat in the corner nursing a beer, his eyes showing what seems to be the first trace of amusement in months. Clint who has lost so much more than is possible to conceive. They’re all so much more.
“I really just don’t know how,” Steve repeats, putting emphasis on the last word of the sentence. “I know I should, I sometimes even want to but… There’s so many things I would have done differently, so many things I would have changed where Bucky’s concerned…”
Steve deflects and he turns his face to look at Tony again, his features so soft it pains Tony how close sometimes he can get to losing this tentative lifeline he’s built for himself.
“But Tony,” Steve turns his body so that it isn’t facing forwards anymore but instead it’s now turned towards Tony, leaving their knees almost but not quite grazing each other. “I do know that I am sorry,
Steve leans into the touch for a second and he chuckles as his eyes close. His laugh is short but it sounds real and free, like such a simple moment is making him truly happy.
Having Tony back has shifted a lot Steve’s perspectives and priorities, including the way he wants the Avengers to work now.
And it is the truth, it isn’t about him. Maybe it is another item in the long list of things Steve and Tony need to discuss and come to terms with, but right now it’s not what the conversation should be about. This conversation is all about Steve, because Steve deserves conversations to be about him and his feelings and his experiences.
Tony tries to make his presence -or his consciousness, better said- known to Steve but when he tries to pronounce a “Cap” no sound leaves his throat.
Tony’s known it for weeks now, maybe months. Maybe he knew it years ago and then unlearnt it. Now there is no more ignoring it, no more pretending or pushing it away. It’s here to stay. It’s here to make itself known.
He hadn’t realized he had closed his eyes and when he opens them the Iron Man helmet is staring back at him from its position in front of the opposite wall. It takes him maybe an entire minute to will his limbs to move enough to place himself closer to it, his hands now at grabbing distance.
There’s a certain amount of intimacy in it, as well. It’s learning a complete new side of Steve, one so raw and honest. Seeing it doesn't necessarily surprise Tony but it humbles him. Steve is such a good leader and Tony has never really forgotten about that but to see it in action when they’re not in a battlefield or handling Avengers business is mesmerizing.
She’s crying and although he doesn’t feel ready Tony opens his eyes because if there is even a small chance he can make this easier on Pepper he will take it.
As they finish eating, Steve and Tony start clearing the table, leaving Natasha and Pepper with their wine glasses in hand, just talking.
JARVIS doesn't wait for the go ahead and he directly starts projecting the images Pepper and Rhodey had been describing before.
There’s one person, though, truly isolated from all of them. Only one person who still seems capable to hide from Tony’s gaze, still capable to hide himself away.
It takes Steve about 5 seconds to find the perfect angle for the picture he’s about to take. The sun looks to be propped on his left shoulder and its glow is soft enough that it doesn't create a glare in the picture but still potent enough to almost cast him in an ethereal light.
“Wow. It’s like his brain just vacated the premises”, Bucky said, shaking his head, “Steve, are you seriously thinking of asking Tony Stark out on your WEDDING REHEARSAL, you muppet?”
“Damn”, Tony laughed, fishing his phone from his pocket and giving it to Steve, “You’re really having a bad day, uh”.
“Yeah”, Tony replied, his eyes losing focus for a second as he touched his own chest where, Steve had just noticed, a faint blue light was coming through the shirt. His eyes met Tony’s for a moment before the young man looked away, closing his eyes with a long sigh. He would tell Rhodey about the arc reactor later. Right now, all he wanted to do was to close his eyes and think of home.
Tony only realized he had been staring at Christine Everhart when the screen disappeared from his eyes. Rhodey and Bucky looked at him apprehensively, both aware of how much this whole story affected him. He took a deep breath and smiled at his friends, reassuring them. Thankfully, Peter had been so focused on his sandwiches that he hadn’t even noticed anything wrong.
“Just… Leave me alone, please”, Tony replied, sounding more tired and defeated than he had ever done in his entire life, “Just looking at you makes me feel like someone’s ripping my heart in pieces. We’re done, Steve. Leave me alone”.
After five minutes, the longest five minutes of all his life, a doctor walked in, dismissing the soldier with a polite
At that exact same moment, a blond man on the other side of the world heard a bleep sound. He took his phone out of his pocket and read the message with a frown.
They made plans to meet at Pop’s at seven, as Tony told Natasha as soon as he walked through the door, throwing himself on the couch and right into her lap. She merely looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Hell if I know. He kept shouting that Stark needs to know, that it's gonna be too late. Maybe he's crazy".
“You remember this one, right?” Stane said, crouching in front of Tony and showing him a small device.
“Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I was just passing by and I gotta… I gotta go now, so… Yeah, sorry to bother you, Steve, I guess I’ll see you around”, as he said the words, Tony was very aware that he sounded like a kicked puppy, but he couldn’t help it. Without waiting for a reply, he just turned his back to Steve and his friend and got the hell out of there.
And so, that day, Margaret and Howard’s friendship had ended. The Director of SHIELD knew she stood no chance. The world wasn’t yet ready to embrace the love between two women and should word of her love life get out, Margaret would lose everything she had fought for her entire life, including access to her darling Anthony. That day, Howard promised to never again lay a hand on the boy, but she knew that wasn’t enough. She could see the man her friend had become; his cold eyes said it all. She knew there would be other forms of abuse and she would have to watch, helpless, as this shell of a once great man destroyed her darling boy’s spirits, unable to protect him from it. That day, Margaret’s heart broke in a thousand pieces, never to be fixed again.
Vice-Principle Coulson had what seemed to be the ghost of a smile on his lips. “No kissing in the corridors”.
“He told me the name of my daughter’s school, told me what route she made every day when she went home. He said someone powerful wanted the Starks dead and that, if I didn’t help, he could make my family pay for it”.
“They found a way to harvest her power. It says here they drugged her and took her blood, every single day. Then they gave her blood to other subjects, I’m guessing the soldiers we just read about before, hoping they’d have similar powers. They called it Project FEAR: First Enhanced Army Reserve”.
undercover shit. And she insisted on putting us here anyway. I’m not good with this hiding shit. I’m more of a break down walls kind of guy”.
Steve, who had his head bent forward, shaking his hair his hands in an attempt to dry his hair, quickly looked up, a very rude answer already on the tip of his tongue when he stopped in his tracks. He stared at the beautiful man in front of him, his mouth agape, looking like a complete idiot.
Tony hid behind one of the pillars, his heart beating so fast it felt like it was going to come out of his body. With his back against it, he slowly turned his head, trying to see what was happening, assessing the situation to come up with a plan. The man was standing over a body. Tony bit his lip, relieved when he saw it was a middle aged man and not the familiar red headed woman, and then feeling like an asshole immediately after. This wasn’t Natasha, but it was a person; someone who didn’t deserve to get caught on the crossfire. Someone with a family, with dreams and goals; someone who was just doing their job.
"They're called Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans and you know it, you nerd", Clint shouted just as the door closed, making Natasha smile.
Steve and Tony checked each room, one by one, and found nothing but blood, bodies and broken equipment. There was glass on the floor, from the destroyed windows and flasks, and in some rooms the mixture of chemicals on the floor produced such a bad, strong smell that Steve had to wait outside while Tony checked the room for anything important. There were burnt marks on the walls and floor and even on some of the corpses. It was a gruesome scene.
Steve shrugged. “I thought you might appreciate some company… and a nice cup of hot chocolate, of course”.
And then, before Tony could even try to lick the frosting from the corner of his lips, T’Challa cleaned it with his thumb, licking it right after. Tony stood there, dumbfounded, staring at the king.
“Hey”, Tony replied in a whisper, gesturing for Steve to come with one hand while holding the tiny baby with the other, “I can’t believe you waited all this time”.
Tony, against his better judgment, followed the man back to the balcony where he and Steve had been dancing just a few minutes earlier.
Tony could feel his eyes watering once more. He smiled softly, nodding. “I never… I never really had that. I mean, I had Jarvis, but…”, he sighed, biting his lip, “Thank you. For everything you’re doing for me. I hope one day I’ll be able to repay you”.
Steve smiled and sat down next to the mechanic, offering him the cup, “But on the bright side, I made coffee”.
Natasha did not move, didn't even blink, but the mere mention of Stark's name was enough to make her pay attention to the conversation happening in front of her.
, he thought to himself and quickly shook his head, scolding himself for even thinking it because the last thing he needed was the universe to take it as a dare.
I really hope you guys enjoy reading this as much as I did writing it. Don't forget to leave a comment and kudos! (;
Obadiah turned around and smiled, shaking his head. He started talking again, but Tony was no longer listening. He was looking at his feet and, although he couldn’t exactly see his toes, he knew they were moving. He was regaining movement. He tried not to let his face show the relief he felt in that moment.
“Tony”, Natasha’s voice suddenly filled the room. She sounded desperate, worried. “The mission went south. Steve… He’s… It’s bad, Tony. Get Cho and the medical team ready, we’ll be at the compound soon”.
“That’s what the guy meant when he said they didn’t know, I guess. She’s killed the people who knew what was going on, the people who hurt her”.
The song mentioned is called "It's Been a Long Long Time" and it played during CA:TWS and Avengers Endgame! Even though I didn't like that Steve went back in time to be with Peggy, I absolutely loved the song and couldn't resist using it for the fic!
Tony looked down at their joined hands with a pained expression before taking his own hands back in a slow movement.
“Sure, ‘cause that worked so well the last time”, Steve replied, shaking his head with a sigh, “Bucky, forget it”.
Soon, the elevator doors opened. Tony looked around, eyes wide and mouth hanging open. The entire floor was covered in flowers. White, red, pink roses. Everywhere he looked. And right in the center of the room was Steve, wearing a suit and looking more nervous than Tony had ever seen him look.
So, on a Monday, he got up, got dressed, and left the apartment, somewhat ready to face the day. And found Steve sitting on the ground, just outside his building, with a bouquet of flowers on his hand.
When he finally arrived, he saw Clint and Natasha sitting on the sofa, Vision and Wanda on the ground, talking in whispers, and Bruce just standing behind the couch, walking from one end to the other, a thoughtful expression on his face. Nat was the first one to spot the Winter Soldier and nodded at him.
“Breathtaking, isn’t it? I’m glad you decided to move the wedding here”, Tony said when he noticed Steve approaching.
“So, I was thinking… Since Steve liked to coconut one so much and you liked the strawberry one better, we should have two cakes! So there’s no need to fight anymore, I already ordered them both!”
“Wonderful”, Loki replied with a wicked smile, “Well, then, are you ready to embark on a new adventure?”
“Tony was legally an adult when the second will was drafted. Man like Howard Stark would have a personal lawyer to take care of it. It seems a bit unusual to me that his lawyer, upon drafting a new version of the will, would leave a clause that could no longer be enforced”.
“Ok, what the hell is going on?”, Michele asked angrily and, by god, she looked even more terrifying now than she did in her human form.
Steve felt his heart skip a beat and he smiled at his husband just as Morgan turned around and looked at her father, excited, “Really? Were they nice?”
A ship. Natasha did her best to make sure her expression did not change, even though her mind was in a turmoil. A ship; she remembered something about a ship, but couldn't recall why exactly it was important.
, Tony asked, all polite, just how Jarvis had thought him. The little girl shook her head and walked towards the tree, sitting down on the shadow. Once more, Tony shrugged and continued playing, completely ignoring the little girl as she stared at him in awe.
“It’s hard work, I won’t lie, but I believe all the sleepless nights will be worth it in the end. Oh, here, you have something in your mouth”.
“You mean the girl who iced you out and keeps giving you weird looks?” Steve asked, arching an eyebrow.
The bear looked up and around, apparently searching for the origin of the voice, and finally set his big eyes on Peter, “Hello, little one. You should run before they catch you too”.
and the lack of warmth in his greeting still hurt Tony, but he forced a smile and tried to ignore it.
“Yeah, he hates lemon”, he replied, already taking another bite of said lemon cake, moaning as he chewed, “this is absolutely delicious”.
“We need the documents”, Natasha confirmed, putting down her beer, “They’ll have dates, timetables, names… That’s what we need”.
“Ok, mechanic, so what’s your deal?” Bucky asked as soon as Steve was out of earshot, his eyes darkening all of a sudden, losing all the playfulness that had been there before.
“I was IN the army, Shellhead. I know about army regulations and they’re definitely breaking at least a dozen of them”.
“He was. Apparently, his brother, Loki, did something and now they’re not talking, so he decided to stay here”.
After that, they would meet regularly. Sometimes, when Steve had a bad day at work or had had a particularly difficult assignment, he would call Tony and they would watch a movie, eat Chinese food and fuck on every available surface in the small apartment. Other times, when Tony was frustrated with some new invention that just wouldn’t work the way he wanted or angry at the fact that every single person in MIT was
She slid her finger on the screen, checking the photos she had taken of the police report. Breaking into the Police Station had been fairly easy. All she had to do was create a small distraction outside and slip, undetected, into the Records Room. She re-read the file: automobile accident, happened at approximately eight o’clock in the evening, both victims died on the scene, no witnesses, road was wet from the recent rain, toxicology report showed that Stark senior had had a few drinks before taking the car for a spin. The whole story was completely believable. Dude drinks his expensive scotch before taking his wife for a ride, loses control after driving through a deep puddle, hits a tree, dies instantly along with said wife. Again, totally believable, except for one little detail: the missing footage.
Steve couldn’t believe how young the target looked, how vulnerable. He couldn’t be more than twenty years old. How could a man so young survive something so horrible? Better yet, how could some this young escape from one of the most feared terrorist groups in the world? He carefully put the young man inside the helicopter, stepping aside so Natasha could insert an IV bag on his arm.
“This is Sam”, Steve said, gesturing to the dark skinned man, who promptly raised his beer in reply, “And these are Bucky and Natasha”.
They tried everything. Still, Steve wouldn’t budge. Every time someone as much as mentioned Tony, he would grow quiet, defensive, and would change the subject as soon as possible. It was very frustrating, but they refused to give up. Tony and Steve deserved to be together, they belong to each other, and the team would fight to their last breath to unite the two soulmates again.
Steve was about to reply when his phone went off. He ignored his friends and turned his attention to it.
Bucky got up, a very noticeable stain of oil on his ass. “Look, I can’t make you call him, but… just think about it before you make any decisions, okay? Also, I promise we’ll behave from now on”.
“Yes, during breakfast when I passed you the coffee. Now go take a shower and get ready. We have a relationship to break up”.
“Yeah. Her name’s Bonnie, she’s a real swell girl. We went to this little Italian restaurant down the block…”
“Mr. Rogers? We’ve been expecting you. Follow me, please”, a woman welcomed him. She took Steve through the corridors to a big room on the back. The room was filled with all sort of technological equipments, with people in white coats walking up and down with clipboards, talking in what Steve could only assume was an alien language.
“Oh… Uh, I’m… Yeah, I’m single”, Steve stammered, nervously tapping his pencil on the notebook he had on his lap, “Yeah, single, I’m single”.
“Into mashed potatoes, yeah, we got it. We’re sorry, okay? We feel bad about it, but we had to do something!”
He opened his eyes slowly and found himself gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles were white. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. Would it be too weird if he called Tony and asked to come over? They had talked about meeting on Friday because of Steve’s busy schedule, but… he honestly didn’t think he could wait until then. Maybe he shouldn’t. They’d been on one date so far and maybe calling today, just to sleep over, would give Tony the wrong impression and he certainly didn’t want that. The mechanic was special and Steve wanted to make sure he knew just how special he was to him. So, with a heavy sigh, he decided to just send him a text saying goodnight. He didn’t expect, however, to find an unread text from Tony on his cell phone. The message brought a huge smile on his face.
“Yes! He was angry because someone didn’t do their jobs and he told whoever it was that he was going to take matters into his own hands. I don’t know who screwed what up, but someone is definitely getting fired. I hope it’s Cindy, she’s always stealing my yogurts, that bitch”, she finished with a roll of her eyes.
Anthony later learned that Natasha had just been adopted by his mother’s friends. She’d come from Russia and had been abandoned in a very bad orphanage by her parents.
Bucky looked like a deer caught in headlights. He looked at his girlfriend, as if searching for support, but she just glared at him. Defeated, he answered the question.
Everything so far was going according to plan. The people Sam and Clint had invited to pretend they were Steve’s and Bucky’s friends and family had all arrived and were sitting down in their respective seats, all quietly waiting for the ceremony. Both Steve and Bucky were already dressed and waiting to walk down the aisle. Everything was going fine. And that’s, of course, when everything went wrong.
That seemed to bring the mechanic back from whatever thoughts were going through his head and he smiled, blushing. “Thanks. You too”.
“Well, we are”, Ned said, looking confused, “We’re just waiting for Shuri. She’s our Dungeon Master”.
“Hey… Are you going on a business trip again?” He asked, confused. He knew Ty’s schedule and he was pretty sure he hadn’t seen any trips scheduled any time soon. Especially a trip that would require that many clothes.
“HOLD IT”, Bucky exclaimed, turning his whole body on the couch to look at Steve, “Natasha Romanov? Red head, tall, looks like she could murder you with her pinky?”
“You’re so funny. No, really, I’m laughing on the inside”, he replied, his head on her legs, closing his eyes as she softly ran her fingers through his hair, “He asked me, actually, and he’s bringing
“No problem at all. Now, a toast to the soon to be husbands!” Tony replied, smiling and raising his glass.
. She took him to zoos, and picnics, and parks. She told him stories about secret spies who fought for a better world and fell in love with sassy waitresses. She spent hours on the phone, listening as the young boy recounted his day and shared with her everything that had happened. They were inseparable, even when separated by thousands of miles, and Margaret loved the boy more than she’d ever loved anything or anyone in her entire life, including her darling Angie, which was why, when that fateful call came, she dropped everything (including a very important meeting with the Minister of Defense) and went straight to Malibu, a whole new level of anger burning inside her chest all the way there.
But he doesn’t say anything, he just gives Steve a couple of minutes so he can breathe deeply, sort his thoughts out and then speak.
Tony wasn’t lying when he said Steve has as much claim to this place in his head as he does and if Steve isn't ready for Tony to be here yet he’ll leave, no matter how important he thinks tackling these issues together at the moment is.
Tony himself is engrossed in the movie playing in front of him right until the moment he realizes how close to Steve he’s actually sitting.
Tony reaches over to grab his glass of water and take a long gulp from it. Steve mirrors him and then picks up his cloth napkin to dab at his mouth with it, his plate now empty for the second time during the evening.
Steve breaks his gaze away from Tony’s and looks around the room, his eyes seemingly analyzing little details here and there.
Natasha grows restless by the beginning of the second film and goes to find her computer so she can type away on it as the movie plays. The clicking of her fingers against the keyboard is a little distracting at first but it soon becomes soothing and Tony assimilates it as background noise.
“I still feel guilty every time I think about Bucky for letting him fall,” Steve whispers in the dead of the night.
It’s been two weeks since the break up with Pepper and every day it gets easier for Tony, it really does, but Rhodey had expressed his need to check for himself, too used to Tony telling him he was fine when in fact he wasn’t.
“Alright, then I have two questions: first, were you two making out? And second, who the fuck is that talking through the celling?”
“I believe you. But a guy with a criminal record? You’ll be an easy target. Listen, I don’t want you, you’re small fish. I want the big guy. So put me in the right path and I’ll help you out”.
