Warning: Sherlock discusses Victor's assault, which includes drugging her. Mind your triggers, and if you need to, go ahead and search for "They sat in silence for a long moment" and you'll be past her discussion of his drugging her into a stupor.
“Mycroft has nothing to do with this, Victor.” John interrupted, “Sherlock and I covered for you, and there’s nothing Mycroft has ever done but open his home to you.”
“No, darling.” Mummy replied, “John is my guest. You are, and shall ever remain, my only beloved daughter. As such, you carry your own luggage whilst you are under my roof.”
“John…” Greg’s voice held something like empathy. John absolved him of his concern, because these memories weren’t as painful as they had once been. He had long ago accepted his wounding and discharge as part of his fate. It couldn’t be changed.
“That’s what you think.” Sherlock hopped down from her stool, “I’ve decided your plan is adequate. Mrs. Hudson’s flat is vacant. 221B Baker Street. 7 o’clock.”
John started at her happy manner. They were fucking British. He was supposed to be nice to the waitress, who was doing him a favor, not the other way round. “I didn’t order—”
John didn’t know if it was something he’d deleted or something he was forgetting due to blood loss. Sherlock had stood by his post and explained his process of deletion to him. Rather to John it sounded like a way to repress and ignore painful memories. “John Wayne isn’t your forte, then?”
John said nothing, sipping his tea, and noted that Sherlock had allowed MacPherson to ramble into the garden just beyond the wide picture window that dominated this sitting room. When she spotted her brother imperiously taking tea with him and Mummy, John pointed with his eyes, and mouthed, “Traitor.”
“When he returns to London, he will be in need of a new profession.” Mycroft broke this news in his cold, impersonal way. Sherlock did not blame him personally. She blamed so many others that the only person to which she could affix her rage was herself.
This, however, was not to say that he did not where he ranked in his own household. The shaggy beast was utterly devoted to Sherlock, following her about the flat and trotting along by her side no matter what else might be ongoing. Sherlock fed him, and brushed him, and attended to his socio-educational needs, because the world was full of idiots and MacPherson was far too intelligent a canine to be saddled with an ineffective and inefficient carer. She even let him sleep in her bed, which was not something he supposed he should have found shocking, as she herself hardly used it.
John rushed to shove the frozen food in the freezer, hiding his frozen cookie dough behind a bag of carrots. For someone who didn’t eat, she did have a penchant for ice lollies, biscuits, cakes, and anything with no nutritive value whatsoever. Sherlock would never look there. He put away the milk, tossed the eggs in the bowl, and shoved the bags under the sink. The non-perishables could wait.
But, medication doing its work, MacPherson had fallen asleep. Somehow, John suspected being stuck on the sofa with a dog the size of a small pony would be his lot in life. There were, he decided as he reached for the paper, entirely worse things to establish as tradition.
“He has my notes, all of my notes, from University. It was a period of great innovation in my life.” Sherlock revealed, “I am close to discovering their whereabouts.”
Chaplain Parker had obviously flicked through John’s file, because he knew enough about John to use that information to talk to Sherlock. “Captain Watson is a hero, ma’am, and we’re glad to have him here with us as long as he should need us.”
“Mrs. McGowan and I follow it with interest.” Hugh encompassed Sherlock in his gaze with a single glance, “I don’t suppose you ride?”
“Read you like a book.” John agreed, flashing a grin, one that was small and had been the last sight of too many people to count. He failed to mention that he had also looked the man up, and could recite his family back at least six generations, knew every detail of his daily coffee run, and knew that he preferred dark-haired sex workers.
Sherlock ran through her projections very quickly. Every single outcome was laden with risk she was not prepared to take. But no. John needed her. He needed her. She needed to know that he was safe.
Sherlock continued speaking, “The date was October 14th. I had received a report earlier that day, about a mission John had led, information I had been awaiting for some weeks.”
‘Nice’ was far too pale a word to describe anything relating to one Sherlock Holmes. She had a depth of empathy and kindness, but nothing about her was so banal as to be phrased nice. Still, everything he loved and needed in and about his life was nothing that his Nan wanted for him.
“It’s very kind of you to do a good deed for someone else.” The girl told her, “I won’t say a word.”
John watched the crowd dissipate. His guide here held up a hand. John did the sensible thing. He waved back curtly. The Lady was safe, and the boy’s mission was complete. The sky looked terribly like rain as electricity clapped in the sky above them.
Sherlock swallowed and continued petting MacPherson, who growled low in his throat at the sound of Victor’s smooth, plummy, voice. He was protecting his mummy, it seemed, though her concern was for him more than anything.
John glanced at the clock, and cursed under his breath. He had to get to the surgery. He peeked out the window, and noted the press hanging about their door, hoping for a quote. MacPherson would be back any moment, and John did not want Molly to find their clothes all over the flat and neon signs that pointed to impassioned lovemaking everywhere she looked. He wasn't being circumspect for himself, but he knew Sherlock to be a very private person. She would want time to catalog things in her Mind Palace before discussing anything with Molly.
Satisfied, Sherringford Arthur Vernet Holmes went back to work, but not before sparing a thought for the money in his desk drawer. He figured a little renovation at one of the country homes, maybe one in Sussex, wouldn’t be amiss. The old pile was going to need a lab.
John pretended not see it until there were a slew of random comments, some ranging from remarks that he could have done without.
John made no bones about hiding a yawn in his elbow, shifting his weapon to do so. Victor was keen, it seemed, to make friends, even though they had been following the system for pheasant hunting that provided little room for discussion, as John had drawn the short straw of driving the birds down to the guns with Greg and the dog that had taken to Greg years ago. “Don’t you shoot, Dr. Watson?”
He had never quite seen Sherlock so social without the aid of a case to push her along, and he wasn’t sure as to her deductions, but he knew they would be plentiful. Was she holding them back, still processing, or trying to make an impression on Nan? He had himself noted a thousand details that would be of interest to Sherlock as she entered a this place. He did not linger on thoughts of what she might deduce about his Nan, nor did he allow himself to consider what new depths of himself was now bare to her soul.
“Told me to send a fucking plane.” Greg recalled, “I don’t know that she recalls what she said, because she was rattling off medical facts, statistics, started talking in three different languages. Her Mind Palace was in disarray for a minute or so.”
John knew that Sherlock and Molly had made friends largely because Sherlock had found companionship within the graduate students in her various subjects, though he had only ever  known Molly to be a lasting relationship from those days. “Molly?”
“He came to my flat the following weekend. He expressed to me that he regretted his behavior in the past and wished to make amends. Though I did not believe him, he…” Sherlock shook once, and then found the steel within herself, and continued, as though she was talking about the difference between lavender and mauve. “He…compelled me to share tea with him. The tea was dosed with what I later determined to be a oral dose of midazolam.”
“Damn. I wanted to introduce you.” Mike admitted, “She’s odd. But lonely, misunderstood. She knew my sister Bianca at Uni. You remember Binky?”
Sherlock scrambled easily over the barrier, and only rolled her eyes when Mycroft strolled easily under the taped off entrance near the wall. John was not surprised to see them one-upping one another, even in this.
As they were finishing the visit, Mr. Frank noted, “I guess I’ll head home and tell my wife all her fussing was for nothing.”
Sherlock sighed, and looked at her mussed curls in the mirror. “Oh, there’s no hope for it after that shower this morning, never mind your fascination with my hair. MacPherson and I are going to have my hair attended.”
Sherlock did not budge from the waiting area, not even as they drip dried onto the floor, her hair wild and curly around her in a frizzy nimbus. He wondered if he should tell her she looked like a lion.
“He is a lovely boy.” Nan returned, ordering Chowley to stay in his basket, “He changed lightbulbs all through the house and moved the sofas before rolling back the carpet in Spring.”
John paused, and realized that this order was something she was glad to be doing. He was glad, if suspicious, to have the scent of real tea filling his nostrils, cutting above the myriad of scents around him.
Sherlock Holmes hadn’t seen John Watson since his deployment date. It burned into her mind. She had read military briefings, received occasional images, watched a great deal of news. That was, until October, wherein she had stopped that arm of her research as abruptly as possible. It was an issue of safety.
“I will remind you that you have said as much.” Violet replied, her gaze never wavering. “I do hope it brings you comfort then, as it seems to do so now.”
Sherlock wandered off when it pleased her, and they met up back in the car. “Are you ever going to carry the shopping?”
“Yes.” It was nothing more or less than the truth. He’d caused a few of those deaths, and he’d never been an innocent bystander no matter his role.
“Hello.” Sarah greeted Sherlock, her navy skirt and prim blouse a stark contrast to Sherlock’s denim encased legs and black top, which showed her slim figure to its best advantage. Objectively, of course.
Flatfooted, John realized that they were roughly the same height. Sherlock routinely wore heels of varying styles, saying that she had no interest in apologizing for being tall. John fully supported this, if for no other reason than she was sticking it to the patriarchy and being herself in one fell swoop. But as her violinist’s hands went to her tiny buttons on her blouse, John was stuck by the intimacy of this moment, and how much he wanted to press his lips to hers, just to see if that
She refused to continue down that train of thought. Giving Mycroft credit for anything in her life was unthinkable and disgusting.
John did not sleep, even though Sherlock fell asleep fairly quickly with her hand placed gently in MacPherson’s hair. The dog wedged himself closer to her, and Sherlock rolled, almost knocking the poor dog in the face with her braid as she turned.John himself was kept awake by the sound of Sherlock’s breathing, the warmth of her skin, just beyond his fingertips, and the memory of the truth ringing in her voice when she declared him the most virtuous person she knew.
Mike entered the lab first, only to have Sherlock stick out her hand at the portly man and demand, “Phone.”
“John, do be serious.” The woman in question looked up from her magazine as she sat on a chair, one she claimed to read for research purposes, though John knew better, “I am minding MacPherson. I do not intend to debate gender dynamics at this time. You should stop considering masculine coded work as more challenging.”
“I have no need to play Sir Galahad.” John replied, “Nor am I in the business of judging her relationships. She’s my friend, after all.”
Mycroft sipped his very obviously not supermarket tea, and returned, “Oh, I’m sure you have quite a few more secrets, John.”
Sherlock’s hand slid into his own as Nan turned to fix the tea. John wondered if he was shaking. The last time he had come here, stood in this house was before he’d met Sherlock. Upon his release from rehab, Clara and Harry had hauled him up here for a long weekend of feeding up. It had gone just spectacularly.
John sincerely hoped he saw no such thing, or anything like it. After all, the baby had a due date for a reason, and he was facing possible health complications owning to Laura’s lifestyle factors before her awareness of her pregnancy, on top of the gestational diabetes. “Well, then, in that case we’d better review plans for his arrival.”
John swallowed. He’d seen worse, but he didn’t need Greg to know that. Worse or better never really applied in these situations anyway. They were mere platitudes that helped him to understand that he had to survive the scenes playing out in his head, even now. “He’s been behind all those crimes in the States, Canada, and Norway.”
John forced his jaw not to drop. He wasn’t stupid. He knew well the depth of Sherlock’s devotion, and if he hadn’t known it last week, he sure as hell knew it after this week. He knew. He knew it in the way she accepted him, loved him, pushed him, irritated him, filed every broken spot inside of him. John knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was deeply and profoundly loved and valued, and had known it from the second she had emerged from the shadows in Buckingham. Victor had nothing to do with it, though he did know now how much the man’s taunts had hurt Sherlock. When she loved, she loved fully and deeply, and Victor had attempted to use her vulnerability and her strength for his own gain.
Dr. Norwood blanched, clearly having been working under the assumption that he had headed John off at the pass frequently. The possibility of being outfoxed had not occurred to the man, for which Sherlock cursed him mentally. She was not a trained psychologist, and yet even she could take one look at John and know that psychoanalysis was the last thing he needed. His mind was sacred to him, and he did not appreciate anyone toying with it. His mind was not someone’s play yard.
“She’s going to get stuck in a drainage pipe, but she won’t leave!” The boy cried, “She won’t leave, and she’s going to get hurt. Creaky Pete said it’s gonna rain but good and nobody won’t go and help her. And I told her to push off…”
“You buy that horrible cover story about outsourcing?” Sherlock looked at him, aghast, “How can you be so gullible, John? It’s hardly to your credit.”
Murray still called her Mrs. Watson. John still denied him chocolate at in retaliation. Still, with every interaction, John began to wonder if being able to see all of the things he saw in people, in the margins of pages, in the way she packed a box, was actually a gift. For the first time, in a long time, his ability to see as he did filled him with wonder and joy rather than reminding him of obligation, expectation, and duty.
Before John could splutter, he was abandoned in a cocktail party, like some kind of circle of Hell. Champagne was flowing, and waiters moved around with trays amongst impeccably dressed people. Their gaiety was a front, John realized. It was like the time he’d had to drop out of a chopper to perform an emergency surgery in the field, and a fast extraction.
Carefully, Sherlock shepherded MacPherson into the car, so as provide him with a safe place to rest, see his people, and be out of the range of nosey parkers snapping pictures. So began the hard work of shoving, stuffing, and pushing. Between the two of them, they got the boot to close. Primly, Sherlock placed her hatbox and train case on the bench seat beside a wagging MacPherson. John took a scant second to check Twitter, and noted that his blog account, which had been blue checked in the last few months, was blowing up with speculation as to their destination. People were split 50/50 on their reasons for leaving Baker Street, with neither the work or play winning out in the debate.
Mycroft nodded, and began to text on that horrible iPhone that never left his hand. “You are a man of principle, John. Do not forget that you have given me your word.”
Sherlock looked wondrous, like she’d just been kissed, properly and truly kissed. Her eyes glittered, their blue rims filling with light. John had to look away before he made a fool of himself. Instead, he cleared his throat, “It’s just the truth.”
Mycroft had clearly been anticipating this conversation, though he had perhaps expected it from his sister more than John. “You are aware, John, that what you are demanding will come with a counterbalance.”
"I didn’t know what to do, what I should do.” Sherlock was factually describing the confusion and the lack of anxiety that midazolam produced,  “My brain was functional, but nothing…” Sherlock drew in a breath, and it was broken, ragged. “Could be expressed. Can you imagine, even for a second, what it was to be trapped in my brain, with no hope of escape, no hope of expression?”
MacPherson trotted out from where he had been sniffing around the barn, and nudged his hand for petting. John complied, and the dog sat down by his feet, his craggy head tilting and his eyes wide at all of the sights and smells that surrounded him. John resolved to keep him close, for he had crime scene training, not barn safety training.
Maybe they weren’t ready to talk. He knew they’d have to talk this week. There was time enough to figure out if she’d asked him for a relationship or something, because God knew he could never just have sex with Sherlock Holmes. The idea of a no-strings sort of sex holiday, at her parent’s estate, for God’s sake, was untenable and made dread build in his heart.
Mycroft came into the room. He deduced her, and Sherlock hid nothing. Everything was laid bare before him. She felt a strange sort of strength suffuse her. It came from the depth of her being, somewhere that knew and accepted that she loved John Hamish Watson, of Inverness, lately of Helmand Province. She loved him, and there was only strength in that truth.
“You are the most virtuous person I know, John.” Sherlock replied, turning over onto her side, and shoving her pillow down to make it comfortable, her face towards the dog, and thus, John. “I make a study of people. It is simple fact and I shall not hear otherwise, especially not from you.”
“Do you intend to take up the mantle of a charitable socialite, Sherlock?” Mycroft passed the box to his driver as they approached his governmental vehicle.
“No please this time?” John asked, shifting the bag he carried on his arm, “What would your mummy say, Mycroft?”
“Be nice to your brother.” John admonished, pushing dark curls away from an ashen face, “Doctor’s orders.”
“I thought we talked about the smoking, Sherlock.” John pulled out his toothpaste and his razor and set them on the edge of the sink. He took up his toothbrush from the UV case Sherlock insisted cleaned the toothbrushes properly.  “You’re already a walking risk factor for...”
Mycroft, despite Sherlock’s continual assertions, was not a stupid man. He knew his team wouldn’t make it across the threshold. He knew the dog was going exactly nowhere. “I merely wished to present the idea for your consideration.”
“And if we know he’s here for the night…” John ventured. “We can simply head to London, get them back—”
Within a minute of hello, John was way in over his head. “Are you shopping?” John asked, clearly and hopefully meaning to ask why in the hell he’d been called away from work, making money they actually did need, in order to spend money at Selfridges’ looking at dresses.
Sarah frowned gently, before understanding dawned in her eyes and she laughed, “Yes, John, with the dog. I’ll see you at work next week.”
Adopting the ideal persona for her mission, she addressed the waitress. She blunted parts of her accents so as to slide from public school to utterly forgettable, and asked, “That man in the corner. He asked me to flag you, said you looked terribly busy, and if it wasn’t too much trouble, could he have some PG Tips?”
She was at least halfway down the hallway when she yelled back, “John! I could be accosted in the hallway whilst you fraternize with the enemy!”
“You do realize,” John pointed out, having a sister of his own and coming to see what this was with a sort of shocked clarity, “That your sister and I, that we, have only met once. Don’t you think you’re being absurd here?”
Finishing her water, Sherlock breathed out, and declared, “I manipulated a very pretty woman to dispose of MacPherson’s refuse.”
“My name isn’t—” Greg paused, shocked, when he realized that Sherlock had used his name correctly. Greg understood what it was that she did not say, and nodded gamely. “I’ll ring, Sherlock.”
Sherlock recoiled as though she had been slapped. John reached over and grasped her shoulder gently. “His name is MacPherson.”
“Despite your assertions, I am a grown woman.” Sherlock snapped, her ire clear even through her door and the space between them. It was almost enough to make John wince. “I will be back around ten. Please do attempt to clear out by then. I have to correlate data relating to cigarette ash.”
Naturally, MacPherson was willing to go to the ends of the earth for one of the biscuits that only Mummy Holmes seemed to possess. John had long ago discerned that her housekeeper made them especially for MacPherson, and that Mummy was the only Holmes who doled them out, though Father had been known to sneak one or two MacPherson’s way under the dining table.
By the next morning, Sherlock had baked a batch of biscuits for Nan. He’d earned himself a gentle reprimand when he’d tried to eat one, clipped MacPherson’s nails, binned everything in the fridge, and packed his bag. Sherlock packed her cases, readied MacPherson, and gathered her version of the basics for what she called the bare bones of a lab for her stay in Scotland.
“That is unacceptable.” Sherlock declared, MacPherson flying after the ball that was arcing through the air, “You will grow increasingly depressed and angry, and our discourses will devolve into arguments, biting silences, and angry sex. None of this is permissible.”
Mycroft grumbled, looking away from where he was conferring with his father over grouse John had intentionally scared off to better observe Victor under the stress of not getting what he wanted, not that they knew why the poor things had startled and bolted. “Gregory, don’t encourage him.”
“And I tried to remember if I had been working an op, but I couldn’t remember anything.” John searched his memory, “She told me that Sarah had a lovely voice.”
She had to trust her brain, now. No more notes. Her notes had made John vulnerable. Nothing about that was acceptable. The rage and the pain she had felt as Victor had drugged her, held her captive, and mocked her were nothing to the fear and the hell she experienced knowing that he posed a risk to John, that he thought it acceptable for John’s name to pass his lips.
John bit into a biscuit to avoid thinking of his piece of shit father, who had wasted no time in remarrying after the divorce and living a perfectly dull life somewhere, with no thought to the twins or his first wife, even as she was in the throes of fucking cancer. Last John had heard, Hamish Watson was living rather comfortably. Mum was doing alright, she got by, but Hamish had never done right by her, and Mum refused to touch his pay.
Such was the case today. Mickey was wearing his bright white trainers, and his designer t-shirt with faded jeans. John thought that Mickey stood a good chance of making something big of himself, and knew him to have a mum he loved devotedly, “Morning Doc. Got a busy day today, yeah?”
He stepped back into the lab, his old credentials still far outranking even the ones Sherlock had pilfered from Greg.
John was not a romantic man. He had never had a relationship beyond a few dates, beyond a few months at the most. It had never seemed right. He’d had a sick mother, a family to help support when his father had fucked off, and a sister to protect who had enough romantic drama to put him off the whole of it. Then he’d had patients to treat, wars to fight, intelligence to gather, and an injury to overcome. But now, he knew. He’d been waiting his entire life for Sherlock Holmes.
John said nothing. He wasn’t going to spout off to Greg about the inner workings of their relationship. It wasn’t the type of thing you talked about like two idiots in University. In the first place, Greg was as good as a father to Sherlock, and in the second place, their emotions were private. The world was interested in their private affairs, and that alone made John even more protective of their privacy.
He glanced at Chaplain Parker, who looked faintly embarrassed. “I make lists of whatever’s on my mind before I pray. It's almost meditative.”
John’s stomach lurched. He’d never been on the other side of this conversation. MI-6? Really? There was never a chance in hell. It was only after the vet got to assessing the poor dog that John recalled Sherlock’s words, and noted the way she seemed to be focused on the dog.
He only knew Sherlock from his deductions, and standing nearby and deducing the tourists did not count as a date, “Get blood on my greatcoat, and I will end you.” John ordered, knowing that the faint expression on Sherlock’s face was more smile than grimace as John pushed down more, trying to slow the bleeding and improve circulation, “Ah, here comes the calvary.”
Mycroft rose to pour himself more tea, possibly to avoid the chocolate biscuits, and Sherlock darted behind a tree to avoid being seen by her brother, and John determined her quest to have been successful. As Mycroft poured his tea, Sherlock pulled a face, and it was all John could do to swallow laughter and snort into his cup.
He also made a note to have his assistant arrange to secure his retired nanny some fire insurance  in the interim.
He tore Sherlock’s shirt. The buttons went flying as Sherlock’s eyes went wide. John had to use something to stabilize the entry point. John had heard Sherlock go on about not taking fees, so he assumed that he had the money for another 50 custom shirts.
“I need an address for the eldest Holmes son.” John had spent ages thinking about who that money had come from. It hadn’t been Mycroft. He had money, but he wasn’t the sort to give money without first getting what a promise of what he wanted.
Sherlock studied him, and John knew that he’d just turned this discussion into something of an experiment. Adoration and desire sparked low in John’s belly as Sherlock smiled. Confusion joined them, though, when she simply sipped her tea, and revealed, “My middle name is Sarah, John. I have been known to use it as an alias.”
“You must stop the psychoanalysis.” Of this Sherlock was entirely certain, “John is easily twice your measure in raw intelligence, and he is five steps ahead of you at all times. Psychoanalysis is a game of strategy for John, and while it helps him to feel like a warrior once more, it does you no therapeutic good to look like his enemy and an idiot besides. Though really, I suppose you cannot help it.”
“The former.” John admitted, knowing that he had just requested and would receive a bit more pain medication. In truth, he would probably use a scalpel to remove his whole arm for how bad it hurt. “Thanks.”
“Doc’ll be with you in a tic, Laura.” Mickey assured her as he flipped the kettle on, and sipped his horribly overpriced Starbucks. He was finishing his internship in a few days, and John would miss him. However, he could not afford to pay him a respectable wage, and so he gave Mickey a glowing letter and wished him the best in his new post. He certainly added life to the office.
Greg’s voice dropped, grew thicker, “And then, she stopped. She stopped. It was like a wall had come down, and she was a tower of steel, a laser beam of purpose.”
Pipes entered into the drain creating areas of standing water where the water had not yet moved on in the sluggish slope. As it grew darker, he had to rely on his other senses. This drain sucked and he swore to God there were spiders crawling everywhere over him. The water was up to the middle of his calves, and there were likely toxins in the water, because that was his luck.
John must have made some sound that clarified his thoughts, because she was rushing to tell him that he had been shot, that according to what she had been told, his actions had saved lives. John didn’t know if he believed her. People always said that, and so he tried to breathe through panic.
Her face cleared, and she quickly smoothed the whole thing over, mentioning a few people that John did indeed know well enough to claim as connections and even friends. The conversations and conclusion of his duty here moved along and John was led through security by Miss Birch. Soon John was moving through New York back to his accommodations.
There was, however, an electric kettle plugged in on a small table, complete with a small basket of tea, sugars, and any other thing she might want for tea in the middle of the night. John could see her, as she had been at fourteen, developing an addiction to tea and unwilling to wander down to the kitchens for a cuppa.
“After this,” John proposed as they worked to examine the body, “I think MacPherson could do with a snack.”
“I never waste my time with irrelevancies.” Sherlock declared, her blue eyes flashing, “John merely deduced you.”
“Did I say something?” Lestrade’s undertone was full of something John could not name, “Or interrupt something, rather?”
“Oh, dearheart, not quite.” Victor began to speak, his voice beneath MacPherson’s warnings, “There’s a personal matter requiring my attention. I require you to deduce James Armitage within an inch of his very life. This is a case, nothing less.  You will take it when I offer it to you, as a gesture of mercy, and you will deduce for hire, as you were once happy to deduce for attention.”
“You make better tea.” Sherlock whispered, and John realized that she had spent so many years being self-sufficient that that soft statement was a plea not to abandon her. Her parents had demanded it, her classmates had expected nothing else, and Sherlock had learned to be the smartest person in the room by needing nothing and asking for nothing.
“How did you know I was ready?” John asked, throwing the idea of pretense between them out of the window.
Sherlock was not so foolish to imagine that his final wave as he approached security had anything to do with her. She knew his eyes never even fell upon her, slouched in the row of chairs as she remained. Still, that gesture emboldened her. Sherlock gathered up her things, and wrote a note on the scrap of paper that had come with her disgusting Costa tea.
“Oh yes, thank you for reminding me that he’s probably in abject terror, John!” Shelock then began to rattle on about kidnapping statistics.
The idea that she hadn’t lost her heart to him almost instantly made something clench in John’s middle. After months of talking about MacPherson’s wellbeing and keeping her updated when he went to visit him daily, John had assumed that Sarah was similarly invested in the dog and wanted to be a part of his life.
“That’s remarkably forward thinking.” John commended her, “In that case, I’m happy to accept. Do you have a clinic space?”
John slid his hand up Sherlock’s hip, feeling the gentle swell of her unabashedly feminine form under his fingertips with  great reverence. “Well, actually I wasn’t, but I’m glad to know that wasn’t left to Greg and Mycroft.”
Quickly, John looked to Sherlock, whose face had gone a particularly alarming shade of grey. “Where’s MacPherson?”
“Uhm. Sure.” He didn’t quite know what to say when she kept studying him, but felt compelled to ask, “Is there something on my face? I had a salad for lunch.”
Janet nodded. John thought she suspected that he, too, had been around the block a few times. “We deal with a frustrating lack of supplies, a continual lack of communal support, long hours, low pay, and frustratingly little to show for our efforts.” Janet confirmed, “So, are you in for a two week trial?”
, John thought. Mycroft knew just what he was telling John. Sherlock had come to him, reached out to him.
John knew what she meant. There didn’t need to be words, not really, but he said them anyway. “You’ve only got one twin. Luckily, he’s the pretty one.”
John knew his reply before the offer left Sherlock’s father’s mouth. He thought maybe this was normal for them, but he wouldn’t violate her like this. “No.”
Sherlock had expanded her Mind Palace since October. She had left Cambridge for New York in December, and had been here since, Ph.D. in hand. Molly was due to land this afternoon for what she called a ‘girls weekend.’ She had not dissuaded Molly from the notion that she had gone through a breakup after getting something Molly called a reverse ‘Dear John’ letter.
Just as he was about to reach for the door, it was yanked open and John heard happy barks over Sherlock’s indignant declaration, “Thirty-seven minutes and forty-two seconds.”
Very red in the face, the girl rambled out some instructions. As they were walking away, she hollered out, “But how did you know his name was Gerber?”
They arrived at the dirt track that led back to the farm shortly after dusk. There was a way by road, but he’d always come home this way, and tradition ran strong here on this land. He also wanted to avoid going through the village, and setting the gossip lines ablaze.
The next day, John’s phone buzzed, pulling him from his racing thoughts. His bank account had a deposit, a sum far greater than he understood.
That done, Sherlock marched right out the front door. She was not ashamed of what she had done. She was not ashamed.
Mummy and Father were contented to maintain their own lives, though they all gathered for dinner. Mycroft had been called urgently back to London over some issue in some undisclosed locale, and Greg had gone along with him, leaving John to ponder the ghosts of Holmes Hall alone. Of course, the house wasn’t named that, but he did like the sound of it in his head.
Still, John hashed another tally in his head, and the scales balanced a millionth of an increment more, which was some consolation.
Moving through the store, Sherlock sailed right into the personal shopping area, and John knew that she had booked the appointment not for the help, which clearly she did not need, but for the dressing room space. God forbid she be cramped into a badly lit stall with the proles.
“I’m quite aware.” Lucy said, cooly, dragging up her hair into a bun on the top of her head, “And you are?”
“I am hiring members of my network, who enjoy smoking, to test the cigarettes. I will record the process.” She replied, as John cleaned his teeth,“It is not as good as first hand data, I’ll have you know.”
He was off on a rant, and looked to John, giving Sherlock the time she needed out from under scrutiny to begin to extricate herself, “You know, it was easy enough to befriend The Freak. It was easy enough to peek at her notes, only to find that they had nothing to do with the work in the lab, and everything to do with her activities. It was easy enough to set her up to lose everything, not once, but twice—”
“Sherlock, the glasses are meant for you, not the dog.” John sighed. It was too bloody early in the morning for this drama. He was of half a mind to put something on the blog just to shut people up, but everyone who needed to know they were together had known for some time.
Before he could express surprise she noted, “I went to boarding school, John. My roommates were horribly attached to a sleep schedule. I can do everything in the dark except my hair.”
John stayed silent, leaning against the counter. She didn’t seem the sort to be fussed up by two men together. Clearly, she had no issue with it. He’d know. He’d observed it so many times, as Harry Watson’s twin.
“That’s fine.” John stressed. It wasn’t ideal, but he hadn’t worked A&E in years, at least not civilian.
She was not depressed. She was terrified. John was on the verge of suicide, and he was hiding it behind stoicism and a carefully crafted mask. Not another soul in this hospital saw it, not even the physiologist who thought he had John’s care well in hand. He had been hiding for months, and now, today, his plans had the capacity to come to fruition. She did not know how, but she could read it in the lines of his body. It terrified her.
His gaze sharpened for a moment, though Sherlock knew his powers of observation were not honed after years of comfortable assumptions and easy conclusions. “Are you known personally to Captain Watson, Doctor?”
“Where is she?” John demanded, calm, cool, and for the first time tonight, feeling in control. He’d been right. He still had it, not that he relished his battle instincts in this moment. He would have rather been wrong, been mad, just to spare her the fear in this world weary young man’s voice. He knew he should have been with Sherlock.
He had built up something of a practice, and more than that, he had begun to serve as a community nexus for people who were most in need of support. On Tuesdays, the nutritionist volunteered, often bringing along the diabetes educator. He had a psychologist donating her time, a domestic violence centre providing support, and was in the process of finding a dental student to come and lend their expertise in the final parts of their training.
John shook his head as they walked outside, having already done all the paperwork and said goodbye to everyone that had mattered, even some of the dicks in the administration who had treated him like a leper over the last few months, “You know I can’t go back to Chelmsford, Harry.”
John did not have one, except to say that MacPherson could not decide where he felt safer. John moved quickly and silently across the room, and moved beyond the pocket door, and slid it shut behind them. MacPherson leaped upon Sherlock’s large bed from where he had been panting and crying, and settled his great head on her pillow.
Sherlock found she could not muster up anger towards John. Anger would be rational. And yet, she could not be angry. He was happy. There was a lightness to his bearing that told Sherlock he felt that he was on top of the world, and there was nothing she could deduce to detract from that finding. John was being sensible.
Within an hour, she was settled in a room on a base of about fifty thousand people, at least for the night, but her mind was centered on one life that was even now, hanging by a thread under a surgeon’s scalpel.
Sarah sighed, and John knew that the stressors of trying to balance facets of his life were not helped by the nosey parkers showing up at the clinic for non-medical reasons. “You know, we’re going to have to figure out a way to weed out people who are coming to see Dr. Watson and people who are making appointments to see Dr. Watson.”
Anderson, who was not entirely a bad sort despite his propensity to insult John’s dog within his hearing, looked to John, “Watson, come on, mate. She’s not Paris Hilton.”
John’s mind was filled as he unpacked the luggage and moved the car. Sherlock’s room was entirely her, from the books jammed onto shelves on the walls, to the various bits of lab equipment. There was a shelf of moleskins that no doubt held decades of data collection. It amazed John to see that she had replicated her bedding at Baker Street. It was clear that Sherlock liked what she liked, and hang what anyone might say or think about it.
John watched as the waitress finally approached him. She had a shy look on her face and was already carrying a tray for another table, but made a point to stop here first. She was eyeing him speculatively, and John found that it had been a long time since he’d seen a woman who wasn’t either a patient or a fellow solider or doctor. John wasn’t interested in a good time with a student on gap year from Manchester, though she had a penchant for older men who were mysterious due to commitment issues. Hence, John concluded, the gap year, when she couldn’t take the plunge on going to her final year Uni. In the first place, he hardly had the time or inclination for a girlfriend, and in the second, he didn’t have the energy for a shag.
John knew he had to fight this flight of sentimentality with the reality of caring for this animal, who would need round the clock care for months if he pulled through, and would likely have worse behavior patterns than Sherlock herself. “Do you mean to tell me that you will do as something as boring as keep a schedule for a helpless creature?”
Nothing could shake John’s sense of rightness, not the media swarm, not the kid who’d vomited on him at the clinic, not the spilled coffee on the tube. Sherlock had once again told him that he was still experiencing the chemical highs of a new relationship, but as she’d said this in the midst of boiling entrails and an ensuing argument about health codes and basic human behaviors, John quite doubted her explanation.
Lucy caught up to John, just as she made it to the crime scene. He’d almost ditched her, but Lucy was nothing if not observant and good at following people. The crime scene was close, and the speeding cars were enough of a clue to find the scene once she got off at the same tube stop as John had done. Lucy hung back and watched as he expertly made his way under the tape, nodding at techs, being a generally nice guy and pausing to notice people.
John struggled to internalize her words. He cracked an eyelid, and saw double. John forced himself to breathe, to take stock of things around him. “‘afe?”
It felt like hours out here. It was worse than sleeping in his battle position. It was worse than working A&E on a slow night. And yet, this was the only way he could feel connected to people who weren’t Army, oddly enough, since he’d been back from Helmand. John was off in his own world, blindly focused, when he heard a silky voice to his right.
John patted MacPherson, and trudged off to work. He’d barely made it down the stairs when his phone began to blow up. There were countless tags, pings, and notifications on his phone. John steeled himself and opened up the news apps.
“I’ll see if I’m free.” Sarah replied, and it didn’t take Sherlock’s deductive powers to know that she would not be joining them.
John shoved to his feet, and realized that he had never felt so much regret at the leaving of someone else’s bed. He had never before quite looked into unblinking, sleep-filled violet eyes, and known in the pit of what was left of his soul, that he would spend the rest of his life wishing he was back in her arms. John did not know what to do with that self-awareness. He broke their shared gaze, knowing full well that the truth was blindingly apparent between them.
Still, John looked, and did, in fact, see black mold. Jesus. She needed a full workup and psychical, which he was not, not, not, not, not going to be overseeing. When he was leaning over the eyepiece Sherlock whispered, “I found it under the sink in the loo.”
Lucy held her own, cradling it against her breasts, and fending off Dr. Grabby with her splayed elbows. He was terrified of breasts, had been since she’d come into her own, and he wouldn’t dare risk grabbing the phone and ending up making contact.
“I trust we’re done, here.” Sherlock continued petting MacPherson. He was no doubt trembling beneath his wavy hair. John could see his eyes, wide with determination that the monster that scared him so would not hurt Sherlock. He was a brave lad, he really was.
John had to step away, do his 15 paces, and come back. When he turned on his heel, he observed the man still standing there, staring at him intently. When John returned to his post, the man’s mouth ran as though his words couldn’t keep up with his brain. Possibly manic, John decided.
John ventured, “Hello.” His Mum had raised him with manners. When creepy men came up to you, you at least said hello before discerning their purposes. Unless, of course, you were in a war zone.
“At eighteen, she went to New York to get away from everything here. She became a debutante when she realized she had not developed the capacity to talk to anyone socially, because she stood frozen in a lift, two feet from you, and couldn’t bring herself to speak your name.”
He’d known from the moment he’d met John Watson their first week together at Sandhurst's brush-up, very low-key, course for officers that John mind was uniquely perceptive and empathetic in a way that matched Willa's own depth, and, well, what was manipulating his brother a little bit in the face of her happiness? So, he’d dropped a few hints, and laid some tracks, thinking that, perhaps, for once, he’d been wrong. Given time, he’d known that he hadn’t been wrong about John Watson. Five years ago, he’d begun to test a theory. Predictably, Mycroft had followed the trail he’d begun.
John knew that now was not the time to discuss the massive amount of privilege in that statement. Though Sherlock spent a lot of time with impoverished people, she did not understand what it was to need to work so as to have food on the table. “What you’re saying is that anywhere that hires me is lucky to have me.”
Counting to thirty in his head, John bit out, “Vatican Cameos!” and in a flash, Sherlock threw her weight backwards, sending the chair flying, knocking Victor into the pot of boiling acid as the gun John kept as backup in his jacket put a bullet in his heart.
The car wasn’t even locked. He could jump out, but he really wanted toad in the hole and his leg would bitch for days if he jumped from a moving vehicle.
“It’s pinned up all over the flat.” John assured him, “And I heard discussion of an autopsy tomorrow morning.”
“The location is need to know.” Sherlock replied, pulling the door open. “As I have made every effort to excuse myself for your needless social interactions, I fail to understand your continued interest. I can waste no further time on your injuries.”
John stood, just as Sherlock marched across the room, took up the plate, and dumped the plate into her messenger bag.
There will be more, but this ending is for those who would prefer to get off the train at this juncture.
John forced himself not to roll his eyes, “When are you going to tell me something I don’t know, Victor?”
As he made his way to the marina with John, Greg shook his head, “Just when I think I’ve seen it all, I meet an animal trafficker.”
John filed that away for later consideration. In turn, he offered up something she neither knew nor had deduced about him over the course of years, “My cadaver in Uni was a lorry driver by the name of Ross White. I kept a notebook of things I learned about him during the term. When I figured out that he had a Nan in care, I went to see her a few times when I was out that way.”
Sherlock sniffed the air once, and shoved herself to her feet again, leaping over items with her general gracefulness, “I stated natural and scent-free cleaners only! Bleach I consented to most begrudgingly, but there will be no artificial lemons in my flat!”
John closed down the computer’s records, and advised his patient, “I wouldn’t say that, Mr. Frank, not if you don’t want to find yourself out in the cold.” John did not add that the man had very much required medical intervention, but Mr. Frank wasn’t the sort to be told that the missus had been bang on the money. Mr. and Mrs. Frank loved to bicker, after all.
“You’re a gem, Doc.” Hawker replied, holding a hot rag to his swollen and angry round face, “Thank you.”
Mycroft would be happy. She had just saved him several thousand pounds on a new wardrobe. With the wedding coming up, surely he would consider her lack of spending as an ideal wedding gift. After all, she wasn’t buying them a toaster.
She simply thrusted the mug in his direction, “Are you looking for a job? If so, I’m looking for a doctor.”
“Sherlock.” There was a soothing note in the elder brother’s voice that made John pause. For all of his haughtiness, Mycroft did care for his sister. John realized this with a sudden but unshakable clarity. Clearly, Mrs. Holmes had been warning him of this fact, as though it was not totally and fully evident. “I did not steal your DI. You know that I’d sooner...”
“Eight.” Sherlock snapped, hissing as the board was lifted onto a transport. John supported his left side as the count ended. “Did you forget to insert you cake today?”
Instead, he spoke anew, his voice soft. The boxes of notes found in Victor’s flat had become central in his plot to seek his revenge, though he had not made good on his plan to murder either of them. “Sherlock, I need to know.”
Sherlock thought that utter tripe. She was Sherlock Holmes. When would Mummy learn that nothing, especially something as critical as an international summit relating to war and peace, escaped her notice? Mummy was an excellent spy, and stateswoman, but all things told, she knew very little practical information about her youngest child.
“Is he exposing himself?” John asked. Disgustingly, that was rather common. There was a protocol in place for that, which typically ended in someone being carted off and arrested, after having a gun pointed at their dick.
She knew clearly what it meant, because slowly, John slid his phone in his pocket. Just as he did, his notepad clattered to the floor, resounding in this hellhole of a lecture hall.
When his foot hit a creaking board, MacPherson barked. He was tired, scared, and deeply unsettled. John wished he understood that, although they were not in London, that he would not be left here. He seemed to need to have them both in his sights at all times. John understood that impulse, but he’d taken MacPherson along to check the windows and the doors and sweep for bugs while Sherlock was in the shower. He’d found two audio transmitters in his room, and destroyed them. He also had a jammer set up, not that dear Mycroft needed to know anything about that little piece of kit he kept with his straight razor.
He stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, earning himself a colorful telling off, as he stared at the pictures that were above the virtual fold. Somebody had gotten shots of them from last month, after the Christmas party Lestrade threw for his team. They all had a great time, and it had been a welcome period of joviality after a couple of rough cases.
“It’s not a big bloody deal, Sherlock.” John told her, “Mycroft’s a mallet-swinging, file-shuffling, bureaucrat, but if his machinations meant you were thinking of me while I was over there, I don’t mind it. I do wish you’d been encouraged to explore other—”
John’s breath froze in his aching lungs. He searched his memory. There was nothing. Nothing. He didn’t believe any of this, but he knew he was in way over his head. He needed information. “Tell me about her, please.”
John felt her reading his medals like Harry would read the proof on a gin bottle. He replied, “Hello.”
He met Sherlock in the park, to let MacPherson blow off some steam and burn off some excess energy that came with being a consulting canine without an active case. John threw the ball, and told Sherlock that he had resigned his post. “I’m not sure what I’ll do next. I just hope it doesn’t make the fucking papers.”
He’d spent months on the ward at QEHB and now he was leaving. The late spring sun was high in the sky when Harriet Watson came to collect her brother. She was currently four years sober, and settled into a job as an addictions counselor, finally making use of those degrees she’d earned while deep in the bottle. How she’d managed some of the best schools and hardest courses on offer more than half-drunk was a nod to the intelligence she shared with her brother.
“Right.” She began to tap away on her computer with spanking clean and clipped nails, “Well, this is a commercial port, held to the highest of international standards. Were there anything of that nature here—”
“Mrs. Watson…” There was sympathy in the woman’s tone. Sherlock wanted nothing to do with her emotions. She wanted her to do her job, her bloody fucking job.
“John, would you like to go for a walk?” Sarah pointedly phrased the question that made it clear the invitation was not a request. John didn’t know if he had passed or failed the test that was implicit in her expression. Her change of the subject gave him little information. “We could get some waffles, down the road?”
John felt Molly’s hand trembling in his own, and he knew that Sherlock had been so desperate to prove that she was able to hold her own at school that she would have sooner died than ever admit to needing help. She couldn’t have gone to her parents for support, as their dynamic would have seen anything other than self-sufficiency as a weakness. “What’s he doing here?”
“A religious farce.” Sherlock said, and John knew that she had in fact, removed every bit of Anglicanism from her mind palace. He thought it was odd, consider that, on a global scale, people used religion as an excuse to hate and murder almost more than anything else.
“I surely won’t.” Nan agreed, clasping his hands one final time, “I’m going to sun myself until I come back as brown as your Grampy’s old saddle.”
“What else must I do?” Dr. Norwood asked, clearly none too pleased with being told what to do, but somewhat intrigued by her appearance at his door. Briefly, Sherlock wished herself older-looking in appearance. She was frequently dismissed due to her age and her appearance, “Have you any thoughts regarding treatment, then?”
He knew Molly well enough to know that she would talk when she was ready. John fully intended to be within arm’s reach of Sherlock and earshot of Molly when that happened. He offered the invitation, “Would you care to dance?”
“She’s not.” John blurted, totally uncomfortable with the idea that someone who would read Dawkins and Heyer and made biscuits would ever be a passing fancy for Murray. John quickly amended that statement, before Murray could spread such news about, “There is no woman, and I’m certainly not married.”
Sherlock opened the pocket door on the wall opposite her bed, and slid it fully back to reveal a second bedroom. It was clearly a former extension of Sherlock’s space, but had been redone as a sitting room with a pullout. John hefted his duffle and set it easily on the plush bed. He looked to the nearby door, “That’s the loo?”
There, sitting at the table, MacPherson underneath it, John took a moment to study Sherlock. Something wasn’t right. He felt it.  The increasing threat against MacPherson was no doubt wearing on her. They, however, had no reason to believe that this threat was anything more than the general issues that came with the territory of their lives.
John counted to three in his head as his eyes adjusted to the darkness around Greg’s torch. There were rare and exotic animals shoved in a cargo hold. It was swealtering down here, for the ship was meant to hold timber and other goods and was instead a jail to several suffering creatures. They were in abject terror and misery, and it made his gut clench to shine his torch in their direction.
“Gregory.” Mycroft returned, “Is not the topic of our discussion. Neither need we discuss our recent nuptials. You have been in six hostage situations in half as many months. You have been stabbed, assaulted, shot at, beaten...” Mycroft listed them, and each one was made John’s adrenaline surge, “God knows what else has happened that you’ve hidden.”
“I’ve a gun to her head!” Victor screamed, “I’ve killed and I’ll kill again. I killed Gloria, and I did it in cold blood, she knew and she had to die! Be careful whom you denigrate, Watson! You won’t be so quick to defend her when you know that she used her political pull to keep tabs on you for years, that she—”
John nearly dropped the paperback book he was holding, books that had almost instantly grabbed his attention. These few books were clearly well loved books covering several genres, science fiction, technology, classic literature. John was dying for some escapist literature. These had clearly been taken care of, though there were no names inscribed in the front, much to John’s disappointment. “What?”
“I am the world’s only consulting detective.” Sherlock announced, her bright eyes flitting over him, “You are from Scotland originally, extended family near Inverness. You were in the Army, your captaincy was a cover for something. Much of your work is classified. You hide behind jumpers and charm. Sometimes you wonder if you’re gay, but you lean towards women. There is something called bisexuality, John. You’re a doctor. Sexuality is not rigid. You’re left handed, but you can use weapons with your right. You favor football, and cricket, but you play rugby. You want a dog, and two, no, three children.”
John scowled, and debating taking the whole load of copies off the shelf and binning them. The bloody paper would see that as fucking interest in their lives. Knowing full well people were watching him, holding a basket of personal care items, as he stared at his own image. John turned away, and he and MacPherson went to the check. He added a Mars bar to their order, because really, he needed the sugar.
John let his spinning head loll back against the bed. The nurse came back in a minute to collect his refuse and asked him, “How’s your pain level, Captain?”
John picked up the brush, and looked at MacPherson's curly hair. “Well, we should probably find you a different comb. You’ll frizz, mate.”
“Wilhelmina,” Said she, who was supposedly the leader of a country, though Sherlock could never remember which one, only because there were more important things to deduce. The woman was on personal terms with Mummy, and had known Sherlock long enough that Sherlock considered it unless to inform her that she did not use that hateful forename. “I would simply say hello.”
“MacPherson would like it.” John replied, near the doorway to the room in question, “If Sherlock wants to go, it might be nice.”
It was bloody well freezing out here. He made a mental note of the weather conditions so as to inform Molly. They were running out of time. If Victor had any sense, he was getting ready to bolt, taking Sherlock’s work with him.
On his way downstairs, Greg was there, clearly waiting for him. His easy, jocular manner was tempered by concern. “I remember the first time I came here. I about had a panic attack in the shower. Myc and Sherlock…they…”
Likely not. At least it was better than the foreign tourists who asked him questions. He sometimes wanted to answer. He sometimes wanted to scream that hey weren’t fucking experts because they’d seen
It was only after the whispered invective left her mouth that she she was standing in the aisle, right next to Dr. 1980s floral dress. Lucy gave her a bright smile, as she
“I should tell you that love is a chemical deficit.” Sherlock relaxed in some minute but profound way, “And that you may change your mind when the newness has worn off and you are…more aware. I will not hold such an occurrence against you.”
John studied the handwriting. It was female, feminine, but not feminine in a way that spoke of a woman desperate to prove her gender performance to the world. The paper, though clearly high street, was thick enough to hold the weight of a fountain pen’s ink. It was as though she had found it, considered it nondescript, and decided it would do.
centered around a woman who had loved a Captain from afar, carefully considering the match after rejecting it. John thought again that Sherlock was more of a closet romantic than she let on, but he had no intention of taking advantage of her tender heart to meet his own burning desires. He had to be fair to her, treat her with consideration so few people in the world had ever looked beyond their noses to offer her.
She had checked in at the desk, as was the way of this process, and stuck the awful name tag onto her dress. She headed into the buffet spread, hoping for at least a bagel to spike her blood sugar before listening to some old, puffed up, self-important upper-class, white guy, pontificate about STI prevention when she knew damn well he’d not had a good shag in at least 75 years, not because he was old, but because he was married to his work.
They passed the meal in silence, which John knew would be just lovely for the blind gossip sites. He could see it now.
John let a barrage of feeling wash over him. He wasn’t sure what to do with it all. It had been a long time. Too long. He could see the wash on the line and the chicken house shut up for the night. Emotions rioted within him. He sat at the top of the track until MacPherson barked in anticipation and Sherlock roused. John began to drive before she might ask about his dallying.
Sherlock spoke then, “An international criminal is docked here. He has my dog, not to mention a quantity of illegally obtained animals and animal artifacts.”
“Shut up, Sherlock.” John ordered, as the paramedics took over. John provided what little information he had. Sherlock was awake, but that didn’t say much about his condition internally, not really. Sherlock was amazing, and if he wanted to stay awake, he would.  “He’s packed and ready for transport. Internal bleed, though. I’d run a line.”
Almost instantly, Sherlock declared her mind in need of diversion, and synced her phone with the stereo system. Momentarily, Sherlock retreated into her Mind Palace, and seemingly took no notice of Mahler that was streaming with gusto out of the speakers. John would have found The Clash better driving music, but he wasn’t about to quibble.
“I am not prepared to discuss my patients with practitioners who are not involved in their care, without their express consent.” Dr. Norwood studied Sherlock, “What is your role in this unit Ms…”
Sherlock was in the middle of suggesting that she would have to give his theory due diligence and research it when the door opened and Father Holmes began greeting them exuberantly, “Oh, you’re here! You’re here!”
John reached into his rucksack, and tore open a package he’d put in there this morning after a pitstop at the tuck shop. He wasn’t particularly hungry, but he knew most people would have been, and figured Harry could do with something. His depression manifested as a lack of interest in food, but that didn’t mean Harry had to notice it.
John didn’t have to wait long. The car pulled to a stop in front of a white building just as the last of his Tim Tam disappeared into his mouth. A discreet doorman popped out of nowhere. John hefted his groceries, felt his gun shift in the band of his jeans as he slid from the seat, and went inside. He knew that the driver wouldn’t be any help. He hadn’t even batted an eyelash when John fiddled with his wrapper and stuffed it in the door handle. It was never a bad idea to leave behind a bit of DNA.
“I have an MD and a PhD, Sherlock. They don’t mean I can fix the dog.” John snapped, really looking at her for the first time since Sarah had left them here in Mycroft’s black car, never mind the fact that Mycroft was no doubt using this to gather intel on Sarah. John was totally unable to leave Sherlock to sign forms and wait alone. If MacPherson died, he wasn’t going to let her face that loss alone. And frankly, he did not trust her not to totally berate the staff if he did pull through. “It means I can tell you’ve got a cut on your leg and banged up your hip.”
John’s expression shifted, and he knew his thoughts were easily read. He could not just flee to go romp around the garden. Sherlock had lost her shoes at some point, and her stockinged feet were bare in the grass. Clearly, they both knew she had the better end of the stick, though it jarred John a little bit to see her quite so free so soon after their arrival.
He hated to crush whatever hopes she might have harbored. Still, it was kinder than allowing her to harbor hopes that he was going to become a country doctor with seven children, three dogs, and a cantankerous cat. She had never left behind the hopes he’d find a nice girl.
He refused to admit it to himself, but he liked to think that if there had been a mass hallucination in the ICU at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, that it had been she of the care packages. Of course, that was utter insanity. John chose to believe that whatever was coming his way, that he would know it when he saw it. Whether or not he’d be able to face it was another question entirely.
“I don’t know what you mean.” Sherlock twirled her stool, and nudged John with her knee. He stepped out of her way. She held out her hand, “Slide.”
Once back on Baker Street, John reflected over the cult of Sherlock that had grown up around them. Speedy’s now had case memorabilia on the walls and the shops had cashed in on their location. John ignored the owl-eyed stare of the new shop assistant. Heather had the good sense to pretend he was a brick wall, and Randeep joked and laughed with everyone.
Greg called out as John leapt into the back of the cab, ditching the cuffs he’d worked his way out of in seclusion that Greg had insisted upon, “You’re still under arrest, John!”
John was a bit bemused by her reaction to a simple database combing. She hadn’t really seen the gamut of what he could have done, and intended to do, to bring Victor down,
She pulled an iPhone from her clutch, sighed, and stuck it back. “What you must know is that I do not intend to alter my career objectives in any way just because you’ve deigned to show your face in London.”
“He’s not boring.” Sherlock recoiled from him in time with the first flash of lightening, as though the truth hurt her. “I’ll show him London, and he’ll add to my range of data points.”
John did not tell her that he had had quite enough of observing soldiers melting in the heat. They could hear the guns and the noise from here, and that was quite enough of a reminder of his soldiering days.
Despite John’s best efforts and considerable resources, he was never able to find solve the puzzle of his mystery benefactor. He traced every chain of thought he could, but hit dead ends over and over and over. He even attempted to pull a ‘return to sender’ but the box merely appeared on his desk, this time with a note on top that read, For Dr. Watson in flourishing, masculine script that was very ornate and seemed quite like a warning.
“It’s a scent issue.” Sherlock pushed some of the blanket over the dog, making it clear that he was settled where he would remain for the night, so confident was she in her theory, “He is used to Baker Street, which has a pleasing scent that has come to affirm to MacPherson that he is home, and safe.” Sherlock explained, “My room is solely mine, and your belongings are in the next room. He does not understand the circumstances here.”
John returned the greeting. John tried to keep his past under wraps, and was glad when a few of the men saw just John. He wasn’t the soldier he used to be, not anymore.
John wanted to scream that it was a little late for sorry. He did not offer his sister a hug, nor did she ask for one. He couldn’t reply. He couldn’t absolve her, because to absolve her would be to absolve himself. He wasn’t ready. John looked at her, a face that mirrored his in only the smallest and most significant ways.
John followed Pete down a hallway that was glutted with people, as they walked through a wide room decked with tables facing a canteen line.
John would have liked to give him several tips. Instead, he simply nodded, and strode away, satisfied that he had not given Tom the respect of a farewell. The old guy had been bothering since the day after Gramps had died, and she had vowed then she’d burn the place to the ground before selling to him.
“Would I be putting you in a tough spot if I finished my shift today and went on my way?” John asked the question, and read the truth in the relief Sarah tried quickly to hide, “I’ve heard of a few openings, and this might be a good thing for everyone involved.”
John sobered, unable to focus on anything but Sherlock. He saw someone covering Victor’s body, and told her for only her to hear. “I love you.”
John’s eyes narrowed. He was certain he hadn’t been followed. Before he could ask anything, the waitress was putting a folded note on the table and swaying off to deliver the glass of water and allergen list that remained on her tray.
“You can count on a splendid reference, John.” Sarah agreed, quickly enough to tell John that she did not want him to back out of this decision, “You are really a good doctor.”
She clasped the stainless steel inner bowl tightly in her hand, “I begin to question MacPherson’s ability to appreciate a trip to the country. It appears that he is contented anywhere.”
“You daft fucker,” Harry declared, driving one handed to reach over and slap at him ineffectually, “You hid the fucking Tunnock’s!”
Murray took a glance into the box, and waggled his own bushy eyebrows in a way that was supposed to be sexual but simply came across as absurdly comical. “I don’t think Gina’s mum also manages proper chocolates, now does she?”
From behind a few canisters, Sherlock retrieved the pilfered laptop. John powered it on as usual, and tapped a few key sequences at the login screen, enabling a hidden authentication portal to appear. Really, this was child’s play, but if it allowed him to eventually plant a facer on Mr. Trevor, he would do almost anything.
“I can’t apologize for it.” Sarah replied, “I never wanted pets or the trappings of a family life, and it’s clear you aren’t as closed off to the idea of them as I had assumed.”
Sherlock paused, and set aside her pen and pad on the nightstand before replying, “Yes. I was at Landsthul.”
“Don’t be absurd. Mycroft has had you in mind for years, not that he ever thinks. If he had, he would have covered his tracks.” The woman spoke as though he knew everything she was talking about, “Vienna confirmed it. It’s not my fault they sought to hide the truth behind gilt and purchased gentility.”
Sherlock huffed and headed down the stairs. John, after shoving all of the suitcases into something resembling a stack, clipped MacPherson's lead onto his collar of the week, and headed to Boots. Sherlock had used the last few heating pads on some thermogenerator experiment. They were also out of soap, for much the same reason, and John was sure that he was going to need sun protectants this week. Thankfully they sold La Roche-Posay at Boots, and Sherlock declared the scent and texture of any other high street brand untenable.
She took it, and ignored the comment about her father. John saw it for what it was. They were going to have to talk.
John did not dignify him with a response. They were there, anyway. John looked at the yacht before them, a stylish craft called
Sherlock slanted at glance at John, and he made his excuses as Sherlock rose from the table, “I should really see to MacPherson’s dinner. Won’t you excuse me?”
Fury raced through John. He wanted to punch that perfect mouth. He wasn’t a fucking tin solider. He had bled, and left parts of him in the desert so that this posh bloke could stand here and declare himself superior to some other man with a freaky sounding name. He had buried far better men than Sherlock would ever know.
John strode quickly through the crowds, and found Sherlock and MacPherson making their way quickly. He fell into step beside her, “Look, that wasn’t okay.”
John hummed noncommittally. It seemed he, in addition to having expert marksmanship and some other classified skills, also had killer fashion sense. After all, he knew he’d picked that dress. John Watson, blogger, doctor, soldier, personal shopper. Also, evidently, garment bag schlepper.
John studied Sherlock. She was being carefully to the point and direct. Had she had so much as a sniffle, though, he would have heard about it after the first instance, no matter what he was doing or where he happened to be at the moment. “I’m glad you’ve decided to see to your routine care.”
John knew there was only one thing to do when he got to the photos of people coming up to Sherlock, largely because she likely refused to go around to the various round tables in the blue carpeted chandelier-ed room. Sally had been there, and so had Harry, looking sober and happy for once. His cousin Lucy had sent a gift. A swirl of Holmes relations filled the rest of the room, along with several young women that he supposed Sherlock found tolerable enough.
They talked about strategies for tooth care while homeless, and John gave away his extra toothbrush. John scribbled off a prescription for both an oral rinse and antibiotics. Hawker might not take them, but John gave him a sound lecture on their importance, and told him to get word to Sherlock if he had any trouble. He arranged for the shelter to pack him up some extra food to take with his pills today, and knew that would continue.
John wanted to groan. Mike Stamford from his uni days had grown up and grown out, but he hadn’t changed a bit. John was in no mood for good cheer, “Hey, Mike. How’ve you been?”
John wasn’t sure what to make of Sherlock’s behavior. MacPherson was still in the veterinary hospital, and Sherlock had hacked their security cameras to observe his living space. She watched the feed continually, making notes and bringing up various concerns on her daily visit. John glanced down at her notebook, a moleskin that was plum, and had spidery writing on the cover: MWH. John pondered the monogram for a long second, wondering what middle name she had given the dog. Something like Wisteria, surely, given her family history of floral names.
John had the strangest feeling that this was an audition of sorts, that he was being watched. He trusted that feeling. The Taliban had followed him once. Those men hadn’t survived their venture, not that John took any joy in doing what he had to do for the safety of his men and his own skin.
John was buttoning up a clean shirt when there came a knock at the door. He hastened to pull on one of his shoes, but it was too late. He had not made it to his post by the door in time to forestall what he heard. Sherlock was huffing and crossing the flat before the second knock had finished.
“We’ve got a bit of one.” Janet informed him as he finished cleaning up and closing his depleted bag, “We’ll do what we can to help you outfit the place, but this isn’t NHS, Dr. Watson, and we haven’t its funding or backing. The people who seek us out are often without leave to remain or are people who massively distrust authority figures for heartbreaking reasons.”
He hurried away, back into the hive of people. Sherlock looked at the desk at the front of the ward, and back at the locked doors that she had come through mere seconds ago. Swallowing, she approached the desk. The nurse looked up. She deduced, however badly, that she had not been expecting a young woman wearing workout kit, flats, and a horribly tatty Barbour, who was mumbling to herself unless spoken to in direct tones.
A text buzzed in John’s pocket, the results of some contact with a few people in the know, at the highest and lowest positions in this society. By the time he read it an hour later, Sherlock was gone and he was grappling with the knowledge that there was no James Armitage anywhere in London or in Europe, save a boy who had died years ago. Seconds later, as he was processing that information and composing a text to Sherlock, a text came in from her number that sent him flying across the pavement towards a black car that had pulled up five minutes ago.
Americans overused that word, as a general cultural trend. However, she could not find fault with his statement. “John would want me to tell you that he was doing his job. However, I…” Sherlock struggled for a long moment, “I have never known him to be anything less in my eyes. Objectively.”
“No, he just talks.” Pete allowed, “Tells you about yourself. Every scathing detail. He knew my mum had an affair. He knew my Gran…" Pete summarized, "He talks and then he never comes back.”
Things did proceed swimmingly, if one could describe finding themselves in the middle of a possible murder investigation as something positive. Within twenty-four hours, they had made vague excuses to Sherlock’s parents, let Lestrade know that they had a case, and trotted off to London like good little crime solvers under Victor’s watchful eye. It was thrilling to know that they were two steps ahead of Victor, and the anything he really wanted to know was nothing John hadn’t already looked up, no deductive reasoning required. The deduction told them, however, that there was more to this than the data suggested.
John felt warmth and closeness suffuse him. For a single second, true hope bloomed with him, and he knew that he’d worked hard to find that feeling again. “I’m thinking about leading a support group when I get settled. Got any advice?”
He shared a look with the older lady who’d tried to engage Sherlock in conversation, only to be told in no uncertain terms that urgent matters required her full attention. Oddly, 98.67% of her brain capacity seemed to be focused on asking him questions he didn’t know the answer to, and subsequently looking up the answers on questionable websites and cross-checking them on both their phones.
“I was not Jolly Hockey Sticks, if that is what you mean to ask.” Sherlock admitted, “I have always been a cerebral person, John. It is my nature. As I aged, however, I found that sports were a good way to focus my mind.” She swallowed, “It was preferable to other methods and was required by the institutions my parents selected for me to attend.”
“Oh, it’s fun sometimes.” John replied, off-handedly, thinking of clay pigeon shooting as a child, one of the skills Gramps had picked up from the Yanks and passed onto him. John let light and truth bleed into his eyes, and knew that Victor had come face to face with the solider, the fighter.
John had never needed to tell her that the farm was one place that made him vulnerable. She knew that, in some way, they were going back to the nucleus of who he was, in seeing the place that had shaped him from earliest childhood. “Nan’s expecting us tomorrow. That’s not too soon, is it?”
John did not reply. He had nothing to say. His last name and rank were hot in his mouth until he remembered that the Army wasn’t behind him on this one.
They worked together like a finely oiled team, and Sherlock’s cases somehow seemed to flow differently, now that she simply had to stop to feed the dog, to run the dog, to see that the dog got his requisite sleeping and playing time for proper wellness. If John used these periods as reasons to feed Sherlock without her actual awareness of the orange slices placed by her side or the pasta in the bowl in front of her, he felt no guilt.
MacPherson trotted off, darting to scurry after some shadow or scent John’s human eyes could not discern. “MacPherson, stay close.”
“I tried to get Sherlock to go to her father. Mycroft. Anybody.” Molly licked her lips, taking some of the sheen of the gloss with her, and John learned quite a bit from that gesture, knowledge that had him keeping his eyes on Sherlock over Molly’s petite shoulder, “I am her friend, but I was also an adult. I should have forced the issue, but she swore he never touched her.”
Right. It only looked like they were thirty seconds from having sex on their doorstep, and that was a generous estimation.
Sherlock looked around, and cursed her stupid Nanny. Nanny had never told her what the sensible thing to do was in moments wherein she was seconds from meeting the man with whom she had every intention of incorporating into her future plans. Nanny had always said that he would speak to her, not the other way around, but then again, Nanny was forever believing fairy stories.
John hadn’t used the lemon flavor since Mum was dying of cancer. He shoved away those thoughts, and used his free arm to raise the head of the bed a bit more, ignoring the rush of pain from the bruising and the broken leg. John had no memory of anything that had happened, but he was a trauma surgeon, and he could extrapolate from his own injuries very quickly.
“Dr. Sawyer, Dr. Lee just called off...” The nurse revealed, “Of all the days for her son to need to be picked up from school early.”
Sherlock was not a total stranger to military installations. Still, landing at Rammstein was something that required careful concentration. Even at this hour, planes were queuing and depositing people and cargo at rapid paces. Sherlock was quickly and efficiently checked and ushered into a waiting car, which moved speedily on private motorways that were closed to the public.
“They’ll be delivered, John.” Violet assured him, “In the meantime…” Violet glanced over at the logbook, and seemed to take away something from it that John could not, “I find myself wanting assurance that you are committed to this venture. It may be a bit intense for you.”
John saw the thick tome in Sherlock’s grasp, clutched to her chest from where she was tied to a kitchen chair. There were countless other notebooks on the table, each and every one flipped open and rifled through or shoved aside to find the one she was clutching protectively. Thick piles of findings and reports had been shoved to the floor around their kitchen table to find the correct book, and he could see Sherlock in his mind’s eye almost falling upon the table to make sure that one book end safe in her grasp. It was that gesture that told John everything he needed to know.
“It’s your fault, or were you so busy inserting cake into your face that your forgot?” Sherlock hefted her bag, and pulled out her phone. She had banking arrangements to put into place, and she did not need meddling getting in the way of her plans.
“You know I hate dentists, Doc.” Hawker eyed him speculatively, “You wouldn’t happen to know what you were on about in there, would you?”
The facade did not slip, not for a single second, as she reminded him. “I suppose you’ll make a nuisance of yourself in the afternoon, Greg.”
John hefted his own rucksack. It had seen him to war and back and he could carry his own things. “I’m ready, Harry.”
“It’s only sensible, given the probabilities of future occurrences.” Sherlock replied, “I have done my research, and I think the Paraguard best for my body. I am uncomfortable with hormones I have not synthesized myself, and the manufacture of a pill each month is tedious and something I am likely to disregard in the midst of cases. The consequences of such an action would be unpleasant.”
“Dr. Holmes…” The review board’s chair glared at Sherlock, “We have no choice but to let you go. You are a brilliant scientist, but are perhaps not suited to the interpersonal boundaries that must be maintained in a hospital setting.”
“With the dog?” Sarah pressed for information, and John felt his enthusiasm dip. Not only did she not like dogs, she had no interest in getting to know MacPherson or even using his name. That was one question answered, then.
The man’s laugh was alien to John’s ears. “Soon enough, that will come to light soon enough. Why should I spoil the surprise on a day like today?”
“That sounds about right. Mycroft went and stuck his umbrella in the whole mess, but she was remarkably happy about getting canned after weeks of an inquest.” Greg replied. “After that, she came down to London and focused on her caseload. Mycroft…”
John grinned. John doled one out, even removing the foil before passing it over to her, and bit into one himself. “Consider yourself lucky I didn’t eat you in the womb and shut it.”
“I do apologize, Felmour. My sister will be leaving.” He glanced at the woman as John removed his foot and reached out a hand to the doorman that was ignored, “Won’t you, Sherlock?”
“You were so sick, at Christmas.” Greg clearly was putting things together in a way he never had done before, and it was enough to profoundly shake him. He looked to John, “We were beside ourselves.”
“You’ve gone soft.” John blustered, wondering how on earth being a father himself could allow Mike to make such pronouncements.
John understood, then, that Mycroft would see things through in that time. Sherlock, he decided, was going to murder him for outsourcing this as he was. She would insist on seeing to it herself.
“Are you kidding?” Greg blurted as they headed for the door, out into the wintery night, “She’d just glare and put salt in your coffee.”
Greg looked at him. It was a warning, then. Stay away from my sister. It was as loud and clear as Mycroft’s insistence had been not an hour ago. John did not look away.
Sherlock’s eyes were bright. There were patches of colors on her cheeks as she chatted with Nan. Her pulse hammered in her blueish veins. John found not dispassion in her countenance, but interest, wonder, and when her gaze fell upon him, compassion. Her deductions were swift and sure. He had never expected coming back to be this much, to be this intense, to be this bad.
He doesn’t seem all that bad, John thought.  He just seems… Lonely, John wanted to say, desperate for someone to hear him.
John called out from where he was washing his hands in the tiny sink in the exam room. “You’re welcome to come on back, if you like.”
Before he fell asleep, John considered the changes in his life that the last week had brought about in the most mundane ways. He now had a side of the bed, the dog snoring on top of his feet, and Sherlock within centimeters of him. Poor MacPherson put the breaks on anything amorous, which was just as well because they hadn’t actually slept in a few days.
John took his measure in an instant and knew him to be a snake. He was sorry to insult the species with the comparison, in truth. His pale grip on Sherlock’s waist and hand, though decorous, made John want to rip off his hands. Someone so without honor, without basic human decency, shouldn't even be allowed within miles of her. It was, however, not his choice to make.
“What’s he got now?” Lucy tried to peer down onto John’s horrible, old, mobile phone. It was Harry’s cast-off. Good God, would she ever stop? It appeared Lucy would need to have words with Nana again about this phone thing. They needed to get the man an iPhone for Christmas.
The line went dead. Sherlock’s phone buzzed with an incoming text. Her hands shook as she passed it over to John, Evie reading over his shoulder.
He turned to her, “So help me God, Sherlock, you are going to be the one to explain this to Mrs. Hudson.”
Greg was in attendance at dinner, and though it was a very Holmesian affair, nothing particularly notable happened. Sherlock ate little, MacPherson huddled under the table, Father Holmes offered him too many treats, and Mycroft brushed at his place setting for imaginary dog hair, after which Sherlock began to pontificate on the amount of dander in the air. Greg and John discussed cases, and the blog, and Mummy watched, sharp-eyed, for data.
He knew she would likely be back before the dog could eat, as he could not eat for four hours. It simply was important to issue any instructions she felt pertinent, though he felt it something a vote of confidence that she didn’t tell him how to pack the dog’s suitcase.
Lucy still thought she should have done some more to get him therapy after the Fall. She should have taken a sabbatical and taken him home to Scotland to recover. Maybe she should have arranged to go to Africa on humanitarian trip and taken him along. Who decided after the love of your life died to start going on with some woman who was not suited, in that she was too perfect? A very grief stricken man, that’s who. She had failed him, and seeing him go through that farce was almost too much to even reflect upon. It counted as one of Lucy’s failures in life.
“I had nothing to do with your wandering into the shelter.” Sherlock replied, and John believed her. “Though I will admit I encouraged your interview this morning despite the fact that I knew it would end badly.”
“My aim!” He screamed, “James Armitage is the alter-ego I developed as a nom de plume for work, actual work, that was mine to be published. But no!” John saw that his alter-ego had been his murdering guise, never used to create, but to destroy. James, and thus Victor, was wanted on several major drug charges, and was wanted in the assault of several sex workers. “Professor Barten gave you authorship, her pet, a woman boosting  up a woman on the basis of gender and not merit. Now, just as I’m off to Australia, I find that my identity has been frozen. It seems big brother is still watching you!”
“I sat on the sofa.” Sherlock then recounted various medical responses, the rate of her breathing, how many times she blinked, her pulse rate, the way she began to sweat and feel increasing nausea as her blood pressure slowly dropped as the drug took effect. She then continued on, “Victor ransacked my room, my things, until he found my shelf of notes. He didn’t chiefly want my chemistry notes, though he took them in a box when he left and made significant use of them, which led to his dismissal.”
He still had no idea how he was going to fit all of this in the boot of the 4WD that had shown up in front of Baker Street this morning. The keys had been included in John’s morning paper, just atop an article about the Girl with the Deerstalker Hat’s fashion. “You could help load the boot, Sherlock.”
John’s phone buzzed. He didn’t have to pull it out to know he was being called to come at once. John ignored his phone, largely because he didn’t need confirmation, nor did he particularly want to grapple with the direct contradiction of Mummy’s statement.
“Seen a lot of injuries, then?” She asked, and John saw something behind her eyes. “A lot of violent, deaths?”
Sarah made a noncommittal sound. If Sarah didn’t care, as she clearly did not, why did she persist in treating Sherlock as though they were friends to her face? He didn’t know much about interpersonal dynamics between women, but he knew from observing Harry that the practice politeness was often about attempting to be friendly when in someone’s presence when you really didn’t give a shit was increased amongst women. It set his teeth on edge because he knew Sherlock saw through it.
“Don’t ‘sir’ me, Captain.” The man allowed, “I retired decades ago.” Still he did not offer his name. “If you are looking for suitable housing, I’d advise you to check in with dear Mrs. Hudson. Her flat is for let on Baker Street, not far from Mummy and me. It would be an ideal locale, close to shops, the tube, all manner of parks, museums, you see.”
However, when Lestrade called her from Mycroft’s personal cell number, something told her to excuse herself from the rehearsal and take the call. It was not as if she needed all of these rehearsals and refreshers for their own sake, and there was only so much data one could collect about young women in social settings in one evening at a dinner amidst their obligatory rehearsals.
“I call that predatory, not simple.” John was fixated on the fact that Victor had been pursuing her for years without her consent, “You’re not required to put up with that, ever.”
Within two days, they had determined that Victor was indeed unhinged. Sherlock had found a real case underneath the veneer of the assignment, just as they had expected. Not only was Victor blackmailing her, he was desperate to keep the disappearance of his boss under wraps. He was setting himself up as her successor at the bank, and was in debt up to his eyeballs, and was intent on blackmailing the aforementioned client to pay him off.
“And in his eyes, I will forever be a twelve year old girl with knocking knees and a collection of bunsen burners.” Sherlock surmised as the rounded the corridor and came to a cluster of doors, “You’re in the room next to mine. I felt it best for MacPherson.”
Having got the part of the appointment that Laura most valued, they spent another hour discussing her test results, checking into progress Laura was making with various social service agencies that were helping Laura during her pregnancy, and so on. By the time she left, John was badly in need of five minutes to himself.
“What was your GPS guided sniper routine, then?” Mycroft was far too to the point for John’s liking, “If not you doing your duty?”
John couldn’t help it. He pulled back, blinked at Sherlock, who tilted her head in her brother’s direction, and returned, “In a decade it is likely that John would have foresworn romance after divorcing an American spy, gone grey, and developed distressing vascular issues owing to poor diet and stress.”
“And your pedestrian lover will never leave his wife for you.” Lucy blandly noted, “So now we both know the score, huh?”
Two weeks later, another box arrived for John. Like the first one that had arrived shortly after he’d gotten here, it was largely unmarked, save for his details, and seemed to have arrived through diplomatic channels. It came jumbled up with the mail, but it was clearly in better shape, and the stamps didn’t match international postage. It was clearly a governmental box.
Everywhere he looked, he saw people for who they were, could read in an instant their emotions, their perceptions, as though it was written clearly across their face. It felt like a bone-deep knowing he couldn’t shake or ignore, though he couldn’t always say why he knew something. Sometimes, he simply wanted to be able to see a person at face value, happily accept the masks they presented to the world. It was painful to know that he was the odd man out, never able to fit in quite as easily as the others, always having to be two steps ahead simply because he had been five steps ahead and taught himself to backtrack, to blend.
Was that him, or this Lestrade fellow? John wanted to know. He’d never been called a stickler before.
They smiled at the security and made sure to mention that Walter had sent them. John still couldn’t believe that the walrus’s name was Walter. He’d called him Vernon in his head. The security staff escorted them right to the door of Michael’s on-ship dining room.
By midmorning, Sherlock had tugged on her cherished wellies and begun to make notes on the various animals. There wasn’t that much work to be done these days as the small farm was bare bones in that the only animals left were the ones Nan couldn’t bear to sell off, but John manufactured excuses to stay in the barn and outside to avoid going into the house.
He’d written his speech, but knew he would end up delivering something extemporaneously. With his memory, he hardly needed notes or preparation, though he had made some out of respect for the august body he was addressing. It never was a good idea to tell people just how intelligent he was, not when it was often it was something he often needed to get out of sticky situations.
“She’s brilliant.” Sherlock declared, and that, John knew, was that. Something warm bloomed in his belly that had nothing to do with the fact that he ate half a cake before bed.
There were whisperings of a promotion. John wasn’t sure how he felt about it, but he knew he was in a good place for his career. He was balancing his more clandestine work with boots on the ground efforts in Afghanistan. He knew he was doing good there, and it was there that he hoped to stay. If they were still in Afghanistan when he had the choice, he would elect to remain there.
John hated being on the other side of the interrogation table. And yet, here he was, again, being poked and prodded to share every moment of his actions and his day, like a debriefing. It sent a chill up his spine. Additionally, these long, drawn out regurgitations with Greg felt like a reminder that for every time he had sat on the other side of the table, he would be sitting here.
Sherlock streamlined the whirling of her brain to focus on the important details. She had long ago determined that scope was not always as important as depth of awareness on a minute matter. In this moment, she wanted nothing more than to deduce depth, depth that would enable her to logically and carefully alter her projections. After all, charlatans made predictions. She had science on her side, and Sherlock Holmes made projections on the basis of data.
“It is not quantity, but quality. John puts his degrees to use.” Sherlock peered at her, and it was all Lucy could do not to laugh at how adorable they were, “In any case, you will settle this dispute quite nicely.”
John caught snippets of their conversation, fleeting words about this and that, topics he wasn’t able to follow as he went up and down the stairs in multiple trips. Sherlock’s voice lilted crisply over Nan’s comfortable tones, but John heard joy in their voices that was genuine and unrestrained. He wished he’d thought to linger in the doorway, because conversation died when he came into the room.
“That’s what he was, don’t you see?” Weston swigged his brandy, and John itched to shoot him, to watch the glass shatter as Michael hit the ground in a pool of his own blood, “He was bred for it. You lot fixed him. The damages are because of that, and winnings lost. They’ve been looking for Hector for ages.”
John wished he had half of her certitude, her confidence. He wished he could simply not give a shit about anything other than the truth. “It’s been a shit day.”
John rolled his eyes, omitting the truth that he had borrowed the damn novels from her, though she called them research. “I assume there’s more to your interactions with Mr. Trevor.”
It took John but a minute to generate a report on Mr. Trevor. He worked in a bank, with a boss by the name of Gloria Scott. He was a security and risk management officer, among other things at this high-end bank in London. He apparently had a proclivity for Westwood suits and paying for sex. He had never had a long-term partner and was a lackluster student.
“You’ll never hear me say such a horrible thing.” Sherlock retorted, horror in her voice as she studied her brother.
“Look. I was going to take the cash in the morning.” Weston began, “Take the fucking dog. I don’t give a shit. I got my money. I don’t need their business anyway.”
“Well…” John looked to Sherlock for her assent, which she gave with the roll of her expressive eyes, “MacPherson has hydrotherapy on Monday after work. It’s quite a lot of fun.” They played games, and John got to participate from the edge of the pool. It was amazing to see MacPherson enjoy himself without the pain of his joint problems. After a puppyhood of pain and abuse, the freedom had to be exhilarating. “You’re more than welcome to come with me.”
Sherlock heard footsteps, and exhaled. Her stomach jumped, though of course that was simply because she had been subjected to the coffee here, and had drank two cups out of sheer boredom. She made her way slowly, ever so slowly, back to her escort as she heard a voice say, “Captain, we certainly welcome you to New York…”
Greg began to speak, “Sherlock made a habit of observing you. I only know of the events that made it back to Mycroft. At fifteen, she observed in a cafe in Brussels. At sixteen, she watched you ship off and didn’t speak to anyone for a week. She became an expert on the war in Afghanistan and Iraq within days, and made a fucking olympic sport of snatching Mycroft’s briefings until he simply had copies forwarded to her.”
“Brother, this behavior simply must stop.” Umbrella man said, as a backboard was slid under Sherlock by a bevy of paramedics, one who was probably a trauma doctor, “I offered to...”
Happy Holidays! This will be posted while I'm on Christmas break, so between now and early January. Expect an update within a day or two.
John rolled his eyes, and resisted the urge to straighten his desk. He had finger prints now, if he needed them, and he wasn’t about to defile them. “What is it, then, that I haven’t questioned?”
Sherlock gave him a dirty look and bustled off into her domain. It was not what he expected her apartment might look like. In his head, he’d seen some swanky place, sleek and shining, quite unlike this hovel. John figured if he really was hired to be her security, well, then, this would be the first change he’d work towards making.
John easily surmised that James had, out of concern, stuck his nose in her personal affairs. When James’s assistant headed out of the bar, John took the final gulp of his beer, “I’ve warned off a girl or two from Harry in my time.”
John watched as an man in his late fifties approached them. He was a sparse man, one born to the saddle, with close-cropped greying hair and a confident, quiet, air. “I suppose now he’s met the horses, you might introduce us, Sherlock.”
“Oh, I’m sorry!” Greg allowed, “My honeymoon was not planned with your idea of fun in mind. Not that we saw much of the beach.”
Sherlock did not let on that she knew that someone was dying, somewhere in this vast complex. John was functionally atheistic, but he believed in things like goodness, like meaning, like hope and kindness, mercy and compassion. She thought about what she should say in this moment, and tried her best to smile, “Take as long as you need, please.”
He lifted the creaky, rusty gate and vowed that the second he found her he was going to shout until he was hoarse and hold her until he stopped feeling so sick inside…
“John did not budget his time well.” Sherlock returned, “I suppose he finds value in fastidiously cleaning his dentition before spending time in your company.”
“I warned you, did I not, on several occasions?” Mycroft asked, standing as he was, right outside the doors.
John knew something that the rest of the Holmes’ didn’t know. Sherlock could be trusted. She was someone he trusted to have his back in a dark alley, and she could be trusted to tell her own story. “Sherlock will tell me what I need to know to keep her safe.”
Then, he shouldered the rucksack marked Watson, and headed for the security line. Once in the doorway, he swore he heard someone call out, “John…” in a broken, shocked, sort of voice that felt like a plea. Instantly, he turned around to look for Harry.
John swallowed his tea. She was involved with this somehow, she of the blue dress and the bluer eyes.
And yet, something in John could not envision that future. Instead, he found himself thinking about being here more. He found himself thinking of MacPherson spending his days by the fire with his stuffed moose. He hated himself for it.
Sherlock was on the edge of a grand sulk after a biting rant that would begin with Newton and end with ripping the cleaner to absolute shreds. Thinking quickly, John looked around for a suitably heavy item, and grabbed it blindly.
Sherlock replied, “I do like to clean out the mind palace from time to time. You know how I abhor clutter and detritus.” She pulled her phone from her pocket, “I am going now.”
“Jesus Christ.” Anderson blurted, knowing full well what that meant, “I hope that beast is obedient.”
Within minutes, Mrs. Hudson popped her head round their door, declaring that breakfast was ready with a very knowing look on her face. Sherlock clearly chose to ignore it, though John did make special note of the faint tinge of blush that painted her collarbone as she ignored Mrs. Hudson to make an emergency hair appointment.
John had the sense the Fritz had been Sherlock’s friend and confidante for many years, and so it was no shock to John that he felt as though the horse was telling him he had tarried quite long enough. There was nothing flash or fancy about Fritz, but to dismiss him would be a fool’s venture. There was a bond between woman and horse such that John knew he would never understand it, though he did respect it.
Halfway to opening his mouth to decline, he realized that he needed to get out of the lab to think. The dead body and Sherlock’s enthusiasm were crowding his mind. “Molly?”
“It is Doctor.” Sherlock snapped, very aware of her Ph.D. in this moment. She was the John Watson expert in the room, indeed she was the only one in the world, “John is in agony, in deepest despair, you have done nothing to ease his burdens in the months you have been overseeing his psychological care. Perhaps you are more interested in your grant work. Perhaps patients with TBIs hold more of your interest. Perhaps you are concerned about the professorship opening up at your old college at Oxford? I care not.” Sherlock deduced the man in front of her quickly, “Your duty is to John, and you will do your duty.”
Gossip John overheard said Trevor’s mother lived most of the year in Italy. No one blamed her. John would have fled the Western hemisphere to avoid Victor, had he been his parent. As breakfast concluded and Molly’s bargaining chatter had eventually relented to hand over the fingers, Victor came to them. He pulled out the empty chair next to Sherlock and sank down, taking ownership of the space in the way that spoke to his very fragile masculinity.
“Meaning she helped Harry get sober, arranged for various governmental inquests during the war…” John reached for his gloves where they were stuffed in his pockets, unwilling to reveal more private interventions. “I should thank her.”
John looked at him over the top of his spectacles from where he was packing his bag. Carefully, he tapped an app on his phone. It glowed in the side pocket for a second as the governmental system flared to life. “I’m afraid I have nothing to say.”
“I…” She seemed to be considering it for a moment, but eventually Sherlock replied, shaking her head, “It is important not to disrupt MacPherson’s routine.” That stated, she addressed the animal in question, “Please eat your dinner carefully, MacPherson. No one is going to take the bowl, and if you don’t wait 2.5 seconds between bites, you run a 96% of vomiting.”
Greg inhaled, “No, Sherlock. There will be making my detectives play hide and find, and there will be no...just, just...No.”  He grimaced, “I’m not ready for this. I should have stayed in Mustique.”
More at ease, John smiled at Sarah. This date was not a wrong thing, it was just that the timing was wrong. How could he have possibly given anyone else, even Sarah, his full attention when he knew that Sherlock was out there somewhere? It was completely sensible.
As Greg’s car moved off towards his home, John took special care to wave at a CCTV camera or two that tracked him home and around the park. After all, bedeviling Mycroft was a noble occupation.
John placed his copy in the rubbish bin not far from the door to 221B, and watched with some satisfaction as six cameras swiveled to read the headline. Once inside the flat, he asked, “Not bad for an afternoon’s work, huh, MacPherson?”
“Oh, don’t be an agony aunt, John.” Sherlock demanded, her voice low and for his ears only as she moved slightly closer to facilitate conversation, “Victor’s motives are simple. He hates women, hates that I am his better in every possible way, and he thinks that a sexual relationship would assert his dominance.”
If it wasn’t the Army weighing on him, it was knowing that he had friends like Mike back home who were slowly establishing themselves in civilian careers as consultants. Mike’s wife was having their second baby, for fuck’s sake. John was career Army. He’d probably end up married to a fellow officer in his forties, though why the hell he was even thinking about marriage irritated him. The only functional marriage he’d ever seen was Nan and Gramps, and they were the exception to the rule, insofar as John could tell.
“How would you know what my nanny did, Geoff?” Sherlock queried, genuine confusion on her face. “She was hateful.”
“Soldiers really do make the worst patients, as do doctors. Lucky you're not a farmer or you'd be three for three on the challenging patient lottery.” She replied, and John read her name tag and saw that her name was Jessica. Jessica from New Jersey, John thought blearily. “Try to get some rest. We’ll have your transport orders as soon as you’re stable enough, and we’ll have you home to your wife.”
“We have a mutual interest, you might say.” The man ignored John’s refusal, “Sit, and drink your tea. I assure you, it’s the finest Earl Grey.”
After he’d consumed a large slice of cake and half the sandwiches, John washed them down with his own cooled and tepid cup of tea. He had long ago decided to keep personal things off of the blog, because his life with Sherlock wasn’t some commodity, but he did post a few nondescript pictures. It seemed a good mystery for the average reader, and would give those who knew him a space to comment.
“The fact remains that you did not. So you lose.” Lucy announced,  “Also, I have three postgraduate degrees. More than John.”
John simply shook his head, and slid his hand under hers. “Support his hindquarters. I’ll take the head.”
As John made his way towards the kitchen, he was stopped another five times. One person wanted him to look at a scrape, another had a rash, and so on and so forth. John answered what he could then and there, and told the others that as soon as he saw to the people who had asked for a moment of his time first.
As Sherlock had known she would do, the girl brightened and nodded. “I’d be happy to. My cousin joined up after 9/11. He’s in the Marines.”
He felt disgusting. Suddenly, he hated himself. She had the world at her feet, and all he really wanted, all he could think about, was how good it felt to be the center of her focus when her gaze fell upon him.
“We won’t kill him.” John replied, “However, he’s going to tell us everything about our Mr. Weston. The more he says, the less likely he’ll find himself serving at Her Majesty’s pleasure.”
“They’re four seasons old!” Sherlock bit out, turning against the chair, “At least you should make yourself useful and monitor their progress. A body is a body is a body, be it canine or homo sapien.”
It was an impossibility for John to send her a letter. Only a fool would fantasize of such a thing. Only an idiot would hypothesize that there was somewhere, inside of him, that knew Sherlock Holmes as Sherlock Holmes knew John Watson. He did not have enough data to reach that conclusion.
“Let’s not and say we did.” John suggested, rocking back on his heels, and saw a pale vivid dress hanging on the rack beside the offending Cornflower dress. It was Sherlock. It screamed her name. He forbade himself from thinking about the specks of purple around the rim of her irises. That was just so not done. However, it did seem to check a lot of her typical boxes when it came to clothing.
The question was answered within moments, as he heard shouting from Mycroft’s study. “You will leave John entirely out of your deranged thoughts!” Sherlock yelled, her tones clipped and forceful, “The only reason you should bring this up to him is if you want him to evaluate you for insanity brought on by gluttony!”
“Oh, do shut up.” Sherlock retorted, “Your feeble attempts towards manipulating me into self-care are asinine. Appreciated, but entirely asinine.”
Feeling like a wrung out flannel but somehow invigorated when he was finished, John was expected to hang around for any further remarks. He noted April lingering in the back of the room, though she seemed to be telling him to stay put. John obeyed this directive, though it was not hard to do with many people wanting to speak to him about points of his speech.
When John expressed surprise at her talents with fabric and fibers, Sherlock snapped, “How many times do I have to ask you not to express shock at some evidence of my gender when it is stereotypically expressed?”
John berated himself for not seeing the dried blood on her trouser leg before now. Inwardly, he knew a tetanus booster was the first order of the day. By now, it was after eleven, and he wasn’t about to haul her to the A&E.
John let his gaze clear, as though genuinely confused. He let his resolve flicker across his face, “I know enough.”
“I don’t do what’s right for money.” John cut him off, “Consider the fact that I have specialized training I’d theoretically put to use if I deem necessary one of the quirks of my personality, and we’ll get along.”
John barely resisted the urge to snap the man’s arm in three places, rip it off, and shove it down his throat as he pocketed the silver frame that held the aforementioned photo. John knew this was a long game, and so he asked, “Would you care for an autograph?”
John arrived and was met by a Miss April Birch, the assistant that would be escorting him to where he was meant to give the speech.
“I’ve got your order here, sir.” She set the tray down on the vacant table next to him and unloaded a plate of lemon biscuits and a huge pot of tea.
John knew he wouldn’t eat, so he tried to force himself to eat bland foods he could pack with calories. He couldn’t jump out and carry a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, his gun, and his Tim Tam. Damn if he was leaving his one treat behind. Oddly, all of these counter surveillance efforts made him hungry.
“No, John, I’m conducting an experiment.” Sherlock snapped, “Yes, I’m shopping. As this involves MacPherson, I felt it only equitable that you come along.”
John figured that there had been a calculated amount of the drug in the tea, just enough to pull a needle out and insert it into Sherlock without protest. She likely had no memory of it, and he wasn’t about to tell her something she hadn’t asked about her own trauma and assault. Sexually based or not, Trevor had violated Sherlock, violated her safety, her trust, her mind.
Anyway, she wasn’t serious about consulting with them. It was just fun to rile John. And, on the upside, she could start planting surrogacy ideas. Good providers went fast, and nobody got the drop on a Woodbine.
Glancing at his watch, John knew that he had to get home, too, if he was to be seated on his lumpy, bumpy, secondhand sofa in time for the phone to ring with Nan on the line. John reached for his cane and came to his feet before they settled their tab and headed out onto the pavement. James offered him a ride, but John didn’t really want anyone seeing his drab bedsit building.
“I’m sorry, ma’am, I can’t place her.” John replied, hoping very much that he hadn’t shagged her a few years ago. Of course, that was patently absurd. The fucking chancellor of Germany was unlikely to know any women John would ever be interested in dating, much less talk about him with a woman who wanted to or had been his bed partner.
He closed the door behind him, deciding that he had not been scared or aroused by a little bit of cleavage revealed between a demure blouse. He was a bloody doctor, he saw more out in public. And so what if it had been Sherlock in stockinged feet and her blouse rumpled with deduction in her eyes? So what. So what. So. What.
“No. Not that.” Sherlock shook her head, “It was just enough to render me aware of my surroundings, but to keep me silent, compliant. It was the worst experience of my life, barring that night in Ger—” Sherlock blew out a breath, finished the word, “Germany. Just before I felt the drug take effect, I tried to scream, knowing that it was pointless. I hadn’t tasted anything in the tea.”
The room was dizzying in its detail. He had long ago been trained to walk into someone’s room, someone’s space, and read in it a single second. And yet, he could pick out few things that stood out to him as he returned to her room that stood out as particularly telling. Everything seemed to point back to the woman she was, rather than highlighting some facet about her.
He had tourists out his bearskin, and he couldn’t do a thing about it, so thinking about the thinly veiled comments he might make about them on his blog was his way. Some Grenadiers thought about women, some counted sheep in their head. Some just fucking stared at point until their eyes crossed and they could take 15 steps again.
He informed Sherlock of every detail he could recall as he tore into the biscuits. Sherlock had already begun to scribble on the fresh butcher paper on the wall. After quick discussion, Sherlock declared the man a journalist with some American tabloid. They accepted that conclusion on the basis of nearly weekly requests to learn more about MacPherson, who had been papped yet again at his agility class, leading to the aforementioned alliterative headline.
Sherlock studied him for a long, breathless second like he was a microscope slide of malaria or the bubonic plague. Then, and then, before John knew what she was on about, her lips were pressed in an untutored fashion to his own. John’s fate was sealed, and before the thought had crossed his mind, he was kissing her back.
John watched Mr. McGowan study them both for a single second. He stepped forward and took the horse from Sherlock after nodding once, leading the horse away, muttering to himself about dinner for the horses.
“Skulking about the barracks?” John asked, throwing his voice behind a hunch that was unfurling in his belly, “Oh, wait. Wrong Holmes, wasn’t it?”
“You’re safe, John.” John saw the nurse leaning over him. She was…American. From…New Jersey. Fuck, his brain didn’t work. He couldn’t even place a fucking American accent with more accuracy than the fucking state. His fucking head was stuffed with goddamned fucking cotton wool. His mouth was dry, and he was pretty sure his face was nearly swollen shut.
And there wasn’t any need, not that John had noticed anything beyond Sherlock. A huge black SUV had peeled to a stop just as few pandas pulled up, followed up by an ambulance, lights spinning and sirens blaring. John could not believe that he hadn’t heard, but he had been tearing yet more of Sherlock’s shirt to pad the wound as the expensive cotton soaked with blood.
They chatted some, flirted over his bad school clarinet playing, and John knew that Dr. Sawyer would be a great date. He resolved to take her out, as soon as he could. She was smart, not brilliant, but smart, kind but
“Files full of them.” John agreed breezily, biting into a chocolate biscuit. He did not have to elaborate. Mycroft knew full well what he meant, in both contexts. Much of his background was classified, and so John would leave Mycroft to what he could glean. It was both a reminder and a warning. Mycroft could go on thinking he had the upper hand, or John would simply and easily prove that he had only that in his mind.
Within a few minutes, he heard splashing above the occasional rumble of thunder, saw lamps, and heard a female voice call out, upon seeing them, “Is there a dog down here?”
John lifted it, wondering how the hell Nan had managed something like this, because her church group had only just sent them a package with a few board games and hard candy. He had no idea who would send him something, and wondered if was supplies he’d requested upon multiple occasions. Seeing as how they had trouble even getting shampoo, John wasn’t so hopeful. John carted the box to his desk, and sliced it open with a pair of shears there amid paperwork.
Just then, an email flashed across John’s screen. Mr. Macon had been identified. His name was Michael Westin. He was involved in the import and export of animals to the US. He didn’t, however, specialize in helping Fido hop the pond with papers to avoid quarantine. No, he focused on the slightly illegal, the exotic, and the downright endangered. Why, then, was MacPherson of interest to him? Even with clients that had the stones to demand $5.5USD and steal their dog besides, something did not wash.
Sherlock put the phone on speaker, and John scanned the screen carefully, waiting for the connection to register in his programming.
“And what did I find your work to be? Not paper after paper on fiber forensics, no, but a tawdry, grasping, plot to get a man who wouldn’t have looked your way had not your brother—”
He needed to scope out the room. It was wide, rectangular, with two side doors wallpapered over to look like the wall, several windows, and one main door. His back was never to the doors as he observed the people. Something was not right, here. They socialized, chatting about this and that. John heard bits about someone’s children, and worse, grandchildren. Snippets hit John’s ears, and he exchanged smiles when people met his gaze. It looked normal, but that was the trick. Things that looked normal never really were normal.
Sherlock rattled along, “You need to better understand positive psychology, and humanistic approaches. John fundamentally believes in the goodness of humanity, and a limitless capacity for humanity to rise above its mundane interest in division and hatred. He’s simply forgotten that he, too, plays a significant role in this quest, and that he has his own goodness.” She paused, “You are, I trust, at least passingly aware of Carl Rogers? I would start there, and should you fail to at least appear to be genuine in your attempt at empathy, look at more existential modalities. On second thought, perhaps he would be better suited to working with Dr. Phillips. She seems at least competent.”
She had a postgraduate diploma in creative writing, too, but that hardly signified. She’d gotten that after a wretched breakup before getting a postdoc with WHO. That had been rough, and writing crap poetry had been her savior. Why not parlay her pain into professional expertise? That was the way of the Woodbines, after all.
John couldn’t help but kiss the fine indentations on Sherlock’s freshly realigned shoulder. There was only the faintest bruising and swelling to indicate her pain or the trauma of the last day. “I just want to make sure you—”
John followed Sherlock up the stairs, watching as she unlocked the door and passed the keys over her shoulder to him, for she never bothered with something as pedestrian as keys when picking a lock or banging on the door was more efficient. They walked inside, and John gaped.
John unfolded himself just before MacPherson’s eager licks made contact with his face, “He’s a psychopath, Sherlock.”
“I am trying to secure you a security detail, Sherlock, that you will not maim, poison, attempt to murder, reduce to tears, or evade.” Mycroft snapped, “It appears, after much deliberation, that Dr. Watson is the only living soul for the job.”
The dog lumbered away to his bed in the living room, and stared forlornly at the objects of his affection as John replied, “Whatever you think I need to know is what I need to know, Sherlock.”
John didn’t dare say that Sarah wouldn’t still be in the room if Sherlock didn’t at least consider Sarah less hateful than the majority of people. He knew well that Sherlock’s acceptance, if not approval, of his need for pointless social interaction was important to him. They’d been through a lot of shit together over the last six months as flatmates. It was only normal to value her insights and opinions.
MacPherson was family. She did what she felt she had to do for family. Did Mummy have to force the issue? Likely, but it was Sherlock who had purchased a dress and shoes and hauled out her jewelry cases, Sherlock who had said a few words when prompted by the hostess, Sherlock who ordered extra stationary for him to write thank you notes she would sign, Sherlock who had endured banal socialization. It was blindingly clear in a single moment.
“I’m still not clear what you’re talking about.” John switched off the car as he pulled to a stop behind Gram’s comfortable Ford and next to Carter’s beater. John made a mental note to talk to Carter about not parking in wet grass, “I’ll be the first to admit I’m not getting it, but I don’t have a whole lot to go on, Sherlock.”
John blinked. Had he been flirting? He didn’t think so. He’d only ever flirted during his ops.  “I wasn’t aware that I was flirting.”
John turned and began to walk away with MacPherson as he heard Mycroft exhale. John desperately wanted to turn around and see if he was turning pale or going puce. He did nothing of the sort, and instead continued onward towards Baker Street. He did smile jauntily at the CCTV cameras that were following him home, knowing that if nothing else, they’d succeeded in riling up Mycroft.
Things, the nurse’s eyes told her, were different in this case. There was something different. Sherlock preemptively decided that the difference rested in the fact that they were British, and had nothing to do with John’s prognosis.
John dug into his peas. He didn’t think he had changed all that much. Sure, the nightmares were better and the limp was gone, and he no longer thought about eating his gun, but he was still John Hamish Watson. He still was addicted to danger, was at the top of his game, was still a bloody good doctor and soldier.
“None of that sass, sir.” Charge nurse declared, pausing to see the bald honesty in his face, “You really don’t remember Sarah?”
John shifted a bag against his cane. He could fight them off, but damn if he’d break an egg. His pension didn’t allow for breakage, even in the name of self-defense. John took a left turn in between the cars, just as the car got over to take a right.
“Fragment 31 was recited in the original Greek.” The other man shared, something like hope and thankfulness on his face, “There was more, but I left. I didn’t want to eavesdrop. Somebody really loves you.”
Getting involved with the peer support program was tough emotionally, sometimes, but that didn’t mean he hid from it. One evening as he was packing up and returning the meeting room to rights, there came a knock on the closed door. John called out, “It’s open!”
“Aye, Doc.” Hawker spoke slowly and carefully around his compress, likely in a massive amount of pain. John thought the flannel he was using to be very similar to the ones at 221B, but he wasn’t going to ask. He wasn’t sure how much Hawker cared to make their connection via Sherlock known, and that was entirely Hawker’s choice. “I’m out of the antibiotics you gave me last.”
“You’re reading a bloody magazine and petting the dog!” John returned, picking up the case that had skittered down the stairs, “Do you want your hatboxes on the bottom? I’m just going to stuff the boot and hope it closes.”
They sat in silence for a long moment. Greg, John knew, had been instrumental in raising Sherlock. John could not imagine the thoughts in his mind, as he gasped for air and fought valiantly to push away the urge to punch something, scream, or cry.
Sherlock neither moved nor spoke, but when he brought her the steaming cup, heavily scented with tannins and sugar, she sat up and took it without response. She sipped it as it cooled, and declared, “It was hateful, absolutely hateful.”
Something John knew to be triumph bloomed behind Victor’s eyes. He chuckled, “My, my. You really don’t know, do you, Dr. Watson?”
Mummy was watching them with interest, and John knew in an instant that she had set both he and Mycroft up, and she was killing two birds with one stone via this exchange. John hoped the information would serve her well, because as a guest in her home, he would play the game to a respectable extent. It was, in a way, a hostess gift.
“Semper fi.” Sherlock replied, knowing full well that the girl’s cousin was from somewhere in the American Southwest, likely Texas or Arizona. Sherlock spent a moment arranging with the waitress to take care of John’s bill, handing over cash she had withdrawn from her own account. John would object entirely to Mycroft’s funds footing his bill, and part of friendship was accepting his personal wishes, however illogical. “Please give him this note, and whatever you do, please don’t mention me.”
As an aside, Father Holmes offered, “We were always very clear that whilst Mummy and I had household assistance, that no such perks were extended to the children.”
The doorman greeted, “Welcome to the The Diogenes Club. Would you care to refrigerate your foodstuffs for the duration of your visit?”
John did not expect her to wrap her arms around herself, but she did just that, drawing her body in around itself as though she could protect herself from the onslaught of the memories time had not dulled. John understood then that she was panicking, on some level, trying to get away from memories she kept locked away in the Mind Palace’s dungeons. Rather than draw attention to a reaction she would never want Greg to understand or internalize, John wrapped his jacket around her. Around them, the heat in the interrogation room kicked on and began blowing gently.
Once again, Sherlock hissed,  “John, surely you know more than these people. They’ve pictures of poodles on the wall. Dancing poodles.”
“Sherlock, just because I want something doesn’t mean that now is the best time for us to consider—” John cleared his throat, as yet another person entered earshot, carrying a combat bag with a dog on it.
Lucy froze as John stilled, and slid her foot forward, to step lightly on the notebook. She picked  it up, and tucked it in her bag. John was already out of the door, by then, stealthy and far too quick, but Lucy had meant what she’d said when she’d asserted she was faster. It was no lie.
When Sherlock ended the call, John blathered on about the shops. He waited approximately until they were back at the turn-off to the farm to get to the heart of the matter. “Sherlock, what’s going on?”
“Sherlock…” John sought her gaze, and found it vulnerable beneath the steel in her eyes, “I hardly knew him when I made that suggestion. I was wrong. He’s a consulting canine, just as you are consulting detective.”
“Looks it.” John noted that people from all walks of life were queuing up in British fashion for the line to continue on through so that everyone could have a hot meal and a place to eat it on a cold morning in late February, “I’m really alright. Thanks, though.”
Blessedly, the nurse was quiet until he’d finished for now. She took the base and returned in seconds with a bit of supplies, “I can’t give you water yet, but I can at least give you a lemon swab.”
Chaplain Parker did reveal something of note to John, something that stayed in his brain despite the drugs, pain, and exhaustion. “I came back to check on her, but when I heard her speaking so softly to you…I didn’t want to intrude.”
She simply sat down on the chair and reached for John’s hand. She had never touched him before, and their first touch was marred by medical tape, needles in his hand, and swelling. His other arm was immobilized. Sherlock did not remove her gaze from his face, marred by yet more tape and tubes, except when she watched his chest and fall.
“They infantilize you, because that’s what parents do.” John offered, reaching around her to pull the heaviest suitcase to the ground, whereupon he grabbed the handle and lifted it, easily reaching for another. “It also served to get you some time alone, didn’t it?”
“There’s a situation in the middle east that is uniquely suited to your skills.” Mycroft mentioned, offering up a bargain. “You are, naturally, willing to lend your services to your government and your nation.”
Sherlock merely watched the animal ambulance doors swing shut. As if on cue, a black SUV pulled up. In this case, John was glad to get out of the rain and only cursed Mycroft once.
With that, John began to reply to comments on the post. With thoughts of Sherlock and MacPherson, he agreed to meet his sister for lunch next week. When she texted to confirm it, he actually replied. Lunch with his sister wasn’t something he had done for months, but if they were making changes for MacPherson, John knew that this was the right step to take.
“I would have done that for anyone.” John asserted, “I plan to keep up my half of Baker Street. I cannot be your employee. It isn’t right.”
It was kind of her, but why? What could she see? Had she served herself? No, he would know. Her eyes had seen war, but not the kind fought on a front far from home.
He found Sherlock staring into her microscope, and MacPherson sleeping on the sofa. Before he had so much taken off his coat and hung it up, Sherlock was deducing him, “You’ve a job, not at the private clinic. Somewhere else. You saw Skinny Pete, and treated several injuries, enough to deplete your kit and lead to significant creasing in your clothing.”
The Army had made fine use of that, John knew, fast tracking him and pushing him through his training in hospital, at Broomfield, UCHL, and Bart’s. He’d not broken, not even when they’d expected it, warned him that this sort of clandestine roles had decimated lesser people. He’d risen above and excelled, ignored anyone who said they were expecting too much to ask him to be both soldier and doctor. Fuck them all. He’d proven himself, and he was going to do everything he knew he could do. People were counting on him.
John tried his best to take Sherlock’s advice to heart over the coming weeks, and tried to keep a handle on his perspective. He interviewed at a lot places. The hospitals rightly demanded a set schedule he could not offer, and struggled with the awareness that the private clinics that were so eager to have Dr. Watson on staff wanted more of the minor celebrity and less of the doctor on staff than he was comfortable providing. Last week, he’d nearly walked out on an interview that had the gall to mention Sherlock as though she were some kind of arm candy to boost the awareness of the practice. Presently, he was itchy in the suit he’d had to wear, never mind the bloody tie.
“I don’t talk about your parents on the blog.” John replied, knowing that Nan was making something of a point to them both. “Or Mycroft all that frequently.”
“Of course not.” He knew that it had been more, just from her defensive tone. John reached for her messenger bag, and pulled out a biscuit. He bit into one. Lemon. Glorious. “So, debutante, scientist?”
“Oh, wasn’t it?” Sherlock noted, reaching for her mug of tea in a very telling fashion, “Though I should remind you that the Universe is rarely so lazy.”
John figured out who it was without a doubt. “M--” John paused. What was Sherlock’s father called? John had googled, but he’d only found Sherlock’s blog. Everything else seemed vacant in a way that John knew meant it had been scrubbed from the web. He’d once been a ghost, too, which is why he had a blog now. Hell, he might even make a Facebook.
Greg shook his head, “Thanks, but I’d rather not freeze. Did you get a chance to look at the file I sent?”
His interactions with people today had thrown him through a bit of a loop. He wasn’t sure how he fared, interpersonally. He didn’t know any of these people personally, and he wondered what they would think if he’d told them that his main objective had been to give his speech on behalf of his patients, answered their questions with as much honesty and frankness as he could provide, and hastened away, not to continue on with his clandestine work, but to go back to his tiny room and escape to Bag End.
John tried to excise the ghosts rioting within him. He didn’t like being in a place where Hamish John Watson had been at one time. He didn’t like thinking that his father could find him. It shook him until he remembered that he was a trained solider, that he had been a spy. Hamish was afraid of him. He would not come. He had never once come, not even when Mum was dying within the confines of the stone walls of Nan’s house. He heard her laugher on the breeze, and heard her sobs and wheezing when the wind picked up and whipped around him.
“His face is bothering him again?” Hawker was another member of the Network who occasionally popped round for medical care, alarmingly distrusting of both clinics and anyone in authority. Hawker had never had his wisdom teeth out, and his dental care was nonexistent. Though John was not a dentist, he knew an oral infection when he saw one.  “You know, Pete, I’ll take you up on that cup of coffee.”
