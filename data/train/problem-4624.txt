Castiel didn’t deserve anything from anyone, much less that beautiful soul. That was truly impossible—it always had been and always would be. Castiel would ruin him.
“What?” Castiel bit out.
"I beg to differ," Dean replied, smiling at him.
His boyfriend...he'd been calling Dean that for over a month now, and it was actually going really well, almost too well. Cas kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it hadn't yet. Instead, there'd been nothing but smiles and kisses. Sure, there'd been a couple disagreements between them, and there were still a few assholes who didn't know how to shut the hell up. But for the most part, everyone seemed to have accepted their relationship fairly well, which Cas had not been expecting.
“Hey,” Dean whispered, unsure if Cas would even hear or respond.
Whatever the fuck Winchester had said to him, it had obviously worked.
“I thought you were still getting over Michael.”
“What, and I’m the weird kid from next door? I’m not just some random outside contact; I’m his boyfriend!” Dean argued and tried to reach for the phone.
“But...”
Dean’s smile matched Cas’s as he asked, “Will you marry me?” Before Cas could even answer, he was rambling on. “Not now, of course...but in a couple of years, maybe? Like, after we’re settled and ready and—”
Castiel nodded, and in that moment, his eyes were so afraid but so determined.
He lifted a hand, grabbed the phone out of the air and slipped it back into his pocket. His cheeks ruddied, but he could provide no answer.
“And I’ll invite Dean,” Cas announced as he whipped out his phone, missing the fond smile that Jess and Sam shared.
“Um…” Jessica blushed at her unintentional confession. “It’s just...Dean is so happy now, and that makes Sam happy, and that makes me happy, and I can see it makes you happy too. Like, Dean would come home in a super good mood, and then the next day, you’d come into class in a super good mood, too.”
“What kind of celebration are you thinking of?” Castiel teased.
Dean frowned. "That sucks. I'm sorry."
"You were the one who texted me, asshole. You were the one who wanted an easy lay. So either shut up and fuck me, or get the hell out."
Castiel glared at him. "Why didn't you just ask me? Huh? Why did you assume? It was a joke! But obviously, Castiel can’t joke about stuff like that. Nooooo." He shook his head sadly
Sam paled. “No...”
The mates now stood in the center of the circle, but none of the other witches paid any attention to that. They kept their focus on the orb of light as it floated over Kazimir’s body, then dropped down, disappearing into its prison.
The next morning came far too early as the screech of his alarm pulled Castiel from his dreams. He turned it off and forced himself from his warm bed. He dressed quickly and slipped out the door before his mother or Michael could stop him.
Castiel did not seem surprised, and in fact yelled over him. “Your host will be held to answer for what he’s brought into this world, you parasite.”
"Me!" Castiel replied teasingly, but inside he felt his heart flutter at the thought that the new boy had remembered him from their brief interaction at lunch. He reached and took the boy by the hand to tug him inside.
“You saw it used?” Sam asked, and Castiel nodded.
Charlie dropped her head into her hands. "I don't know! I told her I'd think about it, and that I'd get back to her by this weekend."
“What?” Dean looked back to her. “You just said it was rejected.”
“He was trying to keep you out.”
Castiel nodded. He didn't try to contradict her again. "Thank you, Mother."
He thought for a long moment before finally shaking his head in defeat. “I don’t know.”
Cas nodded.
Suddenly, he wasn’t quite so upset to be here. He waved, and Dean waved back, but neither moved forward. Cas would sneak away once Anna and Balth were busy watching the game. That seemed to be the norm for him and Dean now, anyways, sneaking moments of hungry kisses and playful banter into their busy lives.
He didn’t really need to be in there in the party; he’d just wait until Gabe texted him the plan for that night. He climbed onto the hood of the small blue car and leaned back against the windshield, staring up at the empty night sky that was so unlike the star-filled skies of his hometown.
“Someone robbed a gentleman’s home. And would you believe, they lifted the house.” Cas shot a dark look at Dean as he enunciated each word. “The whole
“Why?” He finally asked the question that had been plaguing him since the nightmare. “Why would he go through that?”
Brady rolled his eyes. “I just meant that he doesn’t seem the type to be in a long-term relationship.”
“I believe you’re the one feeding him? Your home is nearest to mine.”
“Why does it even matter?” Cas questioned when he could speak again. “It’s not like M. Winchester would ever want me, no matter if he knows the truth or not.”
“Castiel,” she greeted, not surprised in the least.
“Looks like someone’s trying to make a run for it, huh?” He teased. The baby lunged forward and pressed a wet kiss to Castiel’s cheek. “Thank you!”
“And you’re just gonna let us use it?” I checked.
Shouts arose in the distant forest, loud and angry.
“No!” the gargled voice cried. The cry continued, even as the body burst open in a shower of blood and viscera, and the creature within broke free. It was huge, grotesque, all sharp angles and blood-thirsty eyes.
“Me? I thought you were dead! Gordon told me he’d killed you,” Cas sobbed against him.
Now that Dean had seen Castiel fight, he realized that he’d never actually needed his protection. In fact, Dean would classify his part as more of a hindrance than a help, which just led to bigger questions that loomed in the back of his mind. Mainly: why had Castiel let him help at all?
"Surprise me," Castiel offered with a small smile.
Cas saw Brady on Monday, and the sight of that pretentious asswipe reminded him of another face, another smile. He blushed as he thought of Dean. God, he really hoped that the guy had meant what he said about seeing Cas around.
“Well, that job was a bust!” Kevin groused as he threw his duffel down onto the bed.
Dean had never been one to worry. Since childhood, he’d been fortunate enough to hold the innate conviction that no matter what happened, he’d figure it out. People with a past like his didn’t know any other way. Either figure it out, or...well, Dean wasn’t quite sure what the other option was, because he always fucking figured it out.
“Hello, Castiel.”
"And maybe I'm the king of hell," Crowley retorted.
Cas’s blue eyes fluttered open and he smiled so gently, so openly, as he leaned forward to press a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. “I’ll take care of you, Dean,” and then he was moving, panting as he bounced up and down on Dean’s cock, his hands on Dean’s chest, his fingernails digging into his firm skin.
“Your eyes...” Castiel murmured.
When Benny looked back at Dean, a single eyebrow arched, Dean met his gaze levelly.
“What the hell was that?” his older brother seethed.
Castiel heaved out a heavy sigh. "Because I know that it'll get him so pissed when he realizes that it all is true."
“So I moved stateside. I worked for Henriksen for four years before I had to go back into hiding with my coven. I stayed there until...until Chuck.”
Dean couldn't respond past a strangled moan. His eyes greedily devoured the sight of the dark-haired boy riding him, his head tossed back as he took Dean all the way to the hilt with every roll of his hips. His mouth dropped open as Dean gave a particularly enthusiastic thrust, and a high-pitched whine escaped.
“And just what am I supposed to wear?” I mumbled against his lips.
“Please don’t worry yourself about me,” Cas pleaded. He gestured toward the crowd, to the cluster of young hopefuls eyeing each other warily, but all glaring at Amara with her tall, willowy posture that spoke of disdain and conceit. “You have a contest to commence.”
“Who?”
Dick showed him the stats. “I think we need to do another interview about it, push the message that you’re not—”
With his bland tone, Castiel realized that Lucifer had already worked that part out on his own. “So why not just give up the drive?” he asked.
But he saw immediately that it was no use...of course it wouldn’t be, this was Meg. Of all the family he’d met, there was no one more protective of Cas...or more vindictive.
"You didn't answer my texts last night," the older boy commented, taking a drag of the cigarette he held. Castiel reached of it and he handed it over.
“Uh…” she glanced at Sam, who shrugged. “Yeah, he’s in my AP lit class. Really sarcastic, but in a funny way.”
Dean turned back toward the village, already forming a plan in his mind, but paused. A lone figure now crossed the plain, walking slowly towards him.
Castiel meandered down the boardwalk, pausing at one stand to peruse the merchandise, at the next to grab some candy. He’d smile from time to time as the vendors chatted at him, even occasionally nod along, but beneath it all lay a deep sadness that painted his eyes a dark blue.
Dean’s smile returned. “What in the world gave you that idea?” He chuckled. “I’m not courting anyone, although I do have my eye on a particular gentleman.”
Castiel didn’t know where Dean disappeared to after the race; all he knew was that the omega wasn’t with Sam and the royal family when they arrived back at the palace. He heard through the grapevine that Dean had gone to Ketch’s estate for dinner, and dammit if that didn’t work up his alpha even more.
Castiel typed out
“Step away, Castiel. That key is mine!”
Dean usually pretended to be upset by these interruptions, but Cas would catch glimpses of his fond smile as Cas and Sam nerded out about something. Almost as if he could read Cas's mind, Dean pulled away from the kiss and smiled.
Dean was waiting, leaning against Baby's bumper. The sunlight made him look like a god. Castiel could stare at him forever. He stopped in front of him and Dean stood up straight.
He didn’t let himself overthink it, didn’t let himself worry about what would happen that weekend with Dean and his family, didn’t let himself wonder if this was too much too soon. Instead, he let himself revel in the blankness of his mind, the heaviness of his limbs, the feeling of Dean pressed against him.
"I gotta drop Sammy off at school first," Dean announced, somewhat unnecessarily.
Cas shrugged. “You’ll find someone, if you really want.”
"Hi, Gilda!" Charlie squeaked as she hastily stood up, almost knocking her chair over in the process.
Alfie stood there with a new guest, his posture stiff and uncertain. Castiel froze for a split second, surprise flitting across his expression, before his genuine smile slipped out.
The silent tears that had been pouring down Castiel’s cheeks, the tears that he’d been struggling to hide from the alpha, finally wrenched a hoarse sob from his throat.
He dropped to his knees and retched into the toilet bowl, tears streaming down his cheeks as the puke burned its way up his throat. He tossed the water bottle aside as he clutched onto the cool, glass bowl for dear life, his stomach offering another heave and then another.
do monogamy. Hell, the fact that he was even contemplating it showed that something was screwy with his head.
She also felt Kazimir in there, his power dark and frantic as ever, but that was it. There was no one else in that orb.
“He wasn’t asking for shit, not from you,” Dean seethed. He leaned in close, just enough for Gordon to hear him whisper. “I oughta throw you outside the walls right now.”
to feel something for the woman. It had infuriated Amara to no end, until that day she’d walked in on Cas and Hannah. And now she understood Cas more perfectly than anyone else ever had or ever could, just as Cas understood her.
Dean stiffened. Cas’s words from their conversation in the library flooded back in.
“No, I’ve got everything I want from there. Tonight is the Hall of records,” Dean smirked and wiggled his brows. “The receptionist promised to sneak me in.”
“Hey,” he murmured as he came to stand next to Castiel. The man glanced down at him, and it almost seemed like that smile, the one that quirked the corner of his mouth just so, slipped back into place. He flew down to stand beside Dean.
But still, at least he'd feel less guilty about the whole thing. And even if Dean never texted him back or tried to talk to him ever again, he'd have a (somewhat) clear conscience.
"It was."
“Then what?” Sam prodded. “You’re just…gonna spend the rest of your life following Dad’s orders?”
“No harmful radiation or anything,” the tech—whose name was very possibly Kevin, if Dean was remembering right—announced. Dean could see Castiel’s frame stiffen.
At lunch, Cas was walking with her toward the cafeteria when his phone dinged. He glanced at the screen, and immediately that soft smile slipped into place. He suddenly shot a suspicious glare her way.
He opened his eyes to look toward the doorway and gasped out a sob. Castiel was there, his eyes red and vibrant as he stepped through and shut the door behind him.
He handed the gun back to Benny, then slowly crouched down in front of Castiel.
“The rainbow, love.”
The demon spun to face him, ready to fight with its sharp grin stretching wider. “Oh young witch, her sacrifice matters not. You’re no match for me, not for the demons in your own mind.“
Uriel arched a brow. “Oh, no. Please don’t misunderstand, Dean. I wasn’t disparaging your work ethic or abilities; I was talking about your predisposition towards men.”
The bell rang then, forcing their conversation to end, but Castiel wasn't paying attention to the morning announcements. His mind kept replaying her words, and he couldn't quite ignore the logic of them.
“He’s a grade-A asshole. He broke the Number One Rule, sold us out to Bartholomew. All because he overheard someone saying that my crew was the best in the business, and his ego took a hit.”
They all exchanged a look.
Castiel shuffled forward to examine the wall more closely, his eyes squinting, head tilting to the side. Grabbing a pencil from his breast pocket, he began to poke at the wall, carving out a piece of plaster that had obviously been applied very recently. As the plaster broke loose from its mold, a subtle flash scent rose up with it. Cas froze, allowing the scent to invade his senses. His eyes slid shut as the memories began to wash over him.
Nodding somberly, Castiel ushered Brian back into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. The other children, all roused by the noise outside, were sitting up in their beds.
“Where’s their ambassador?” Queen Hester murmured to her husband.
It didn’t matter. He’d obviously been wrong.
“I can feel you...” Hannah murmured, her voice tinged with awe. “I can feel your—your mind, your soul.”
"Like a fucking museum," the boy muttered, and Castiel giggled.
Suddenly, the loudspeaker blared to life. “We have a new driver for the practice run! Prince Dean Winchester, honored guest of King Charles, will be joining the fray in Arthur Ketch’s P4.”
“You’ll be the first to know,” Dean promised. He hesitated, waiting for Zachariah to continue. When he didn’t, Dean arched an eyebrow. “Was there something else you needed?”
I knew I was in love with Cas, I’d told him so as we cuddled in my car during that surprise lunch date, and he'd told me at Christmas. But sitting in the Impala with him, listening to him sing along with the radio, watching him laugh at my stories, feeling his hand in mine...I knew I wanted this forever.
“What’s on the schedule for today?” Sam asked as he downed what seemed to be an entire pig.
“This is Cassie,” Cas replied. “Who’s this?”
“So sorry I’m late!” Meg drawled as she threw herself into the chair Pierre was suddenly pulling out for her. Castiel’s gaze flew to meet hers, as did Hester’s, and the tenuous moment ended. The distraction was (gratefully) all but forgotten as Hester zeroed in on her new target.
Cas jumped to his feet, leaving his basket and goods there in the road as he fled toward the narrow walking trail that would lead him back to his property.
But Dean… Oh god,
“You made me nervous!” Cas admitted. “You were...are so perf—”
As Cas hurried up to him, Dean threw his arms around his boyfriend and lifted him in the air, pulling a giggle from Cas.
Crowley hummed pensively. "No, I can practically hear the wheels turning in there. What's going on? Why did you text me?"
Castiel felt flutters in his stomach. He'd spent so long doing it wrong, he didn't think he could do it right ever again.
“I’m coming,” Dean groaned, and then his hips shoved up one final time and he was spilling inside Cas. His hips moved once more, twice, three times as he rode out his orgasm. And then his hands fell back to the carpet as Cas pulled off of him and toppled on the floor next to him.
“I’d say you’re doing a pretty good job.” She winked at Castiel. “Now, I don’t want to take up any more of your time, I know you have to mingle.”
“But still—”
“What?” Sam asked.
A rush of blood surged through Castiel at that one word. He could feel himself growing hard as his eyes locked on the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder. And his omega was practically
“Naomi and Michael are going to help out at the soup kitchen tonight…” Castiel informed, his smile turning lascivious.
Ruby nodded, obviously intrigued, but silent.
“Who?” he muttered, unwilling to play along.
There was no hesitation now. Cas moaned, a hungry, desperate noise, and tugged the other man in tighter. It felt like he was melding his very soul to Dean’s as he grabbed that soft hair and took control of the kiss. But even as Cas finally gave in to his desire, one question still remained in his scattered mind.
When Castiel arrived home, he found Naomi at the kitchen table reading her daily devotional. Not wanting to interrupt her quiet time, he didn't sit, instead opting to stand awkwardly to the side, just in her peripheral vision.
Castiel searched Dean's face, making sure that he really meant what he was saying.
“No,” he ground out, fighting against that inexplicable urge. He yanked his hand back. “Something’s not right here.”
"Naomi's okay. Kind of oblivious, honestly. She's always so busy with church stuff. Doesn't even notice her beloved youngest son is the school slut."
Castiel huffed out a laugh, his mouth falling open as Dean snapped the elastic waistband of the panties.
Meg nodded. “A lot of pain in a lot of lives...including his own.”
“Um, you’d better!” Dean scolded. “You’re a mated alpha now. You have duties!”
“So Marcus,” Dean continued, “still in deep with Ivan, goes to his stepfather Joshua for help, but Joshua won’t do anything about it because he is an honest man. Yet Pete, who makes a percentage off of all those illegal transactions that he turns a blind eye to, has a stake in whether or not Marcus can pay Ivan the debt.”
Still seated, he turned to look behind him and found a large, dark forest spread out across the distant horizon. Something about those trees...
“Castiel—“ Anna called, her tone urgent, springing up from her desk, but he was already opening his door.
. He’d drive to the mall with them from time to time or even sit in on a movie night, sure, but otherwise he let them do their “gross couply thing” (as he put it).
says,” Michael countered. “Dean asked for a driver to escort and bring him back, and he was never out of Benny’s sight. He didn’t do anything untoward with Ketch. Even for dinner, they ate out on the patio in clear view of Benny at his post.”
“Yeah,” Dean answered, and his voice was steady enough to fool Sam, but Castiel knew better. Maybe because his biology was already so in sync with his mate’s, or maybe because Castiel knew instinctively that his own pain wouldn’t get any better if Dean left. If he had to guess, he’d say it was only going to get worse.
"Yes?" Castiel whispered back.
“What? No!” Luci barked. “I need that now more than ever.”
Dean frowned at the realization that it might not be so simple. “So what do you suggest we do?” He turned to glare at Castiel. “I mean, since you’re the expert here.”
“Oh, that’s just a little thing he had with Crowley—or actually, their families. Bad blood, and all that. So Crowley is going to pay him back in full to earn the right to invest in our mines, because to him, the trade off is worth it. It’s only a few million for Raphael, but I figure that’ll give him a bit of an edge with Anael, as far as your father is concerned.”
Around the edges of the circle, Dean could see shadowy figures standing with hands clasped between them. They were the ones chanting, but the incantation obviously brought them pain, if the sobbing was any indication.
As Castiel began flipping through the pages, Dean went back to picking up random sheets, glancing over them, then moving them, or sticking them in a small pile at his side.
“Awesome,” he breathed, then paused. “What about my clothes?”
“Hey, Cas,” he murmured against his ear.
But now, it wasn't just about a bed. Now, it felt like there was so much more happening. In the few weeks they'd spent together, Cas had learned so much about Dean, and Dean about Cas. Now, Castiel felt like it was so much bigger, this thing between them.
“I asked for
Brady’s eyes widened. “Of course! I should’ve known you were on a job.”
Dean turned back to the bar and quietly sipped his drink, waiting for Castiel to come find him.
The alpha nodded, and Cas released his hold on Ana. Standing slowly, he turned to face the council.
While he strode from the room, Castiel stepped over to a stool and sat, still keeping his eyes on the machine.
He gestured toward the empty chair at Cas’s table. “May I?”
Castiel pondered what she'd said, but found he couldn't fault her logic. He had been happier since he started seeing Dean, which apparently made him more approachable.
Brady said something, but I didn’t care anymore, just gave a final warning: “If you’re not there at 3:17 on the
A sniffle, then, “My name is Castiel.”
His thumb froze over the call button. He hesitated. It was late; Victor wouldn’t even be there this late. He didn’t absolutely have to check in right away...
His gaze narrowed. “Since when?”
! And who cares about that age gap? He’s an adult. You’re an adult. You’re supposed to be together, everyone in that room saw it.” He calmed enough to run a hand through his hair. “Cassie,
“My uncle left it to me,” he explained. “It’s good for doing that communion with nature shit, but it’s still pretty fancy. Electricity, back-up generator, plumbing.”
Mere moments of bated breath passed before the boy responded, this time with a picture of his own,
“Nah.” I winked. “I wanna stay right here with you.”
Castiel nodded but didn’t speak, probably
"Cas, where the hell did you go?"
Yeah, that wouldn't be a dead giveaway that he was actually experiencing
“Well, his head was hurt when he passed out,” Garth recalled.
“Thank god!” Dean breathed as he brought his mouth against Cas’s.
“Who?”
Cas had looked all week, it was heartbreaking. A whole week he’d walked around thinking that what we had wasn’t real. A whole week that could’ve been avoided if I’d just done what Sam said and been open with him.
"Cas, Sweetheart, unlock the door!" Dean pleaded, pointing toward the unlock button. Castiel pointed at the button, and Dean nodded. "Just press it once."
"I want to do this again," He murmured.
Dean glanced over at Sam, his red cheeks growing darker. "Back seat, Sammy."
The boy grinned, his tongue swiping to play with a loose tooth.
As he crashed onto his back, a dizzying sense of deja vu washed over him. His own face grinned down at him, but this one was dark and menacing with blood red eyes.
“There you are!” a voice called out, and at first Cas thought he’d been spotted, but then Sam walked into view.
“Yes, of course,” Gia agreed. “But now that you have risen, we must get you back to safety. You’ll move into Ana’s—”
For three days he watched from the upper windows as the cat paced in circles around his house again and again, stopping every few minutes to yell in complaint. Still, he did not open the door. It would understand eventually.
that united their kingdoms.
Gordon sneered at the young man then shot one final heavy look toward Castiel. “We’ll finish this later, omega.” Then he spun and walked away.
“Your supreme and his alpha; it will fall on you and your team.”
Castiel's grin broadened, his teeth sinking down into his lower lip as he nibbled at it. The number wasn't saved to his contacts, and the area code wasn't local… meaning that whoever the number belonged to, that person had only just recently moved to the area.
And that was the simple truth of it. Amara was cruel, even to her lovers—as Cas had first-hand knowledge. He couldn’t allow Dean to be pulled in by her beautiful smile and charming words, because once those were gone...Dean’s life would be nothing but pain and misery, a farce.
Dean waited for the palace guard to open his door before stepping from the sedan they’d ridden in from the airport. He fiddled with the buttons on his blazer as Sam stepped around beside him.
Cas smiled and nodded. “Sure. I’m pretty full for this week, but I have a few mornings free next.”
“Aw,” Ash chuckled. “they went to do some romantic shit for the weekend.”
“Why?” Castiel asked. “You’re my True Mate, and I can see how much pain you’re in.” He was practically begging. “I was
“And your parents were okay with that? Just sending you away?”
Ana smiled. “I should hope so, I am your Sup—“
Castiel looked surprised. "Nice?"
“We need to destroy it,” Dean declared, already with his gun in hand.
him. “I’m yours,” he whispered. “And you’re mine.”
“Well, if you must know—“ Dean started, but Castiel clapped a hand over his mouth.
Dean looked smug. "Nope! Besides, it was English. Who the hell actually needs to take a class for English?"
He stepped from the doorway, back out onto cracked streets. New fissures stretched across the surface with each explosion from the mountain above.
“He’s so good...he must be. Only a good person could make those flowers grow like that.” He sighed softly. “And he is beautiful, isn’t he?”
“Hell yeah!” He winked. “Just make sure you change the bedding after.”
It started out a daylike any other...but then again, that’s always how those days start out: no warning, no anticipation. Just a regular day.
I leaned down and nipped his ear. “Sam’s spending the day at Jess’s, so it’ll be just us...
“I did,” Dean confirmed. “Even received an offer for his job.”
Castiel couldn't quite stop his blush. "Dean Winchester."
“Then what part did he pick up on?”
“Like I’m scared of any of these pricks. I have enough dirt on them to keep them underground for a very, very long time.”
, but you never said
Cas shook his head. “No.”
They all turned back to Sam again, and the alpha seemed to shrink under their gaze. “He figured it might be better, given the…” his eyes flickered to Castiel, “situation.”
“A room,” she continued, “too short to stand up in, but too small to lie down in.”
He reached over to grab a couple paper towels and dampened them with warm water and soap. Before he could even begin to comprehend why, he was stumbling back into the stall, toward those hated words.
Castiel checked his phone for the time, pulling another swig from the nearly-empty water bottle as he did. It was almost time for lunch. If he left now, he could miss the lunchtime rush, both in the hallway and in traffic, and be back home by noon. He could crash once he made it home. He'd just have to drive super carefully.
That night, she had a family thing, and the next she had to study for a big test, so the next time she was able to go over to Sam’s was Thursday. As soon as she walked in the door, she sensed the tension.
A white beam shot down from the portal, hitting the orb of light that held Kazimir and his parasite. Dean could see the way that light crackled through the orb then flew up the beam Cas had held steady for days now.
“I’ll see you tomorrow.”
"But you still have your mom?" Dean confirmed. Castiel rolled his eyes as he took a sip of soda.
“Have you ever heard of the old gods?” The figure asked the bundle. “Don’t worry, young Castiel...you will. You will know them all someday.” And then, a whisper: “You must learn, because if
The skies darkened and a sonorous explosion shook the very ground beneath him as lightning crackled across the sky. It was done: Hannah had completed the spell.
The cat meowed plaintively, and Cas smiled. “You saw him today! His eyes were so green, just like his plants.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “A 1077 form requisitions more support from…”
As Dean's lips met his, Castiel sighed into the kiss, his fingers tangling into the hair at the back of Dean's neck. Dean's hands moved to Castiel's waist, holding him steady as he kissed him hungrily. He leaned against Castiel, his weight pushing him against the cool metal of the car, and Castiel moaned at the growing erection he felt against his stomach. It felt so right, so...perfect to be here in a dark parking lot, making out with Dean.
She stared across at him, holding her hands up in clear view. “I am going to take something out of my purse. Please don’t shoot me when I do.” When Dean nodded, she slowly reached into the giant bag and pulled out a small plastic case. She held it up for him to inspect. “I am delivering this to you, and you are going to deliver it to whoever assigned you this mission.” She set it down on the table between them. “Please tell whoever it is that Lucifer’s given up the chip freely. His ledger is clear.”
“Yeah,” Dean smiled and leaned back in, bringing his lips so close to Cas’s again but not quite meeting them. “So when she came over and caught me moping around the house on Thursday, after you’d brushed me off
Cas gasped when Dean shifted closer, out from under the steering wheel, and pulled Cas onto his lap. With a giggle, Cas rolled his hips, thrilled by the promising bulge he felt under him. The giggle was followed with an immediate “OW!” as he banged his head on the rearview mirror.
Castiel stood behind his chair as the others filed into the dining room. Again, more dignitaries and guests were in attendance, but he ignored all of them. His eyes watched the door as Sam entered, already used to seeing Dean right behind him, but no one was there. Sam reached his seat, and Dean still wasn’t there.
Dean felt the guilt swirling in his gut at the realization that he was going to have to push Cas back into a world he was so desperately trying to escape. It was the only way Dean would ever get to Lucifer. And yet, seeing Cas now, seeing the stress and fear in his eyes after merely discussing his past... It was enough to make Dean want to abandon the entire mission and drag Cas far, far away. Far enough away that no one could ever reach them, not Cas's family, not Dean's boss. But that wasn't really an option here, so instead Dean decided to do what he did best. He might not be able to take Cas away from all this, but he could sure as hell help him forget all of it.
Dean finally pulled his fingers back, watching with pride as Castiel's red hole fluttered around the sudden emptiness.
He wanted Dean to notice him, but he wasn't ready to face him, get. He was still hurting from the betrayal.
Hannah nodded. “Back when Ana went through her descent, she not only traveled to hell.” She gulped. “She traveled through time.”
The silent thanks he sent Victor's way definitely wasn't the first since that day in the bathroom stall, but it was definitely the most enthusiastic.
The clothes stayed on, of course. No matter how handsome and funny and captivating Dean was, Cas wouldn’t want to go too far, not when they’d just barely met. But it was like Dean could sense this. He didn’t push, didn’t move any further than desperate kisses that invaded Cas’s hungry mouth and emptied his overactive mind.
Dean’s gaze darkened, his hopeful smile slipping. “I know. And I feel terrible about that.” For the first time he looked away, licked his lips, but then his gaze returned to Cas’s, sure and steady.
“Within the month, I hope. You’ll need to bring the whole team, of course,” he explained, and Dean nodded. “I’ll send along the logistics, once I am absolutely certain that my plan will work.”
Dean took a step forward, meeting him straight on. "Get the hell away from us."
Jess smirked. “No, but I did hear him talking about tagging along with his cousin Gabe to some college party.”
Cas shrugged. “I tried, but you ran away on me.” He leaned back against the table and stretched his long legs out, waiting for Dean to figure out what he meant. He could see when it clicked with him, when he remembered that last night when he’d jumped out the bathroom window, never to return.
“I think,” he finally answered, “that she has her heart set on someone else as well.”
“What's so funny?” Cas asked as he hopped a couple times to pull the pants up that last little bit.
“So not in your lap this time?” Cas teased. He dropped into the offered chair and reached for the pack of Oreos, completely ignoring Dean’s thunderstruck expression with his casual, “I always miss these when I’m away.”
So he threw himself into his work that day. First he visited a couple shops on the main strip and spoke to the owners, then he swung down by the waterfront. He took a few side streets that went past some warehouses, a couple more that led him past housing developments. Then, once he was sure about his plan of action, he returned to the palace to dress for that evening.
“Fuck,” Dean gasped out once he’d caught his breath again. “Holy fuck.”
Cas smiled blandly, his grip on Dean’s hand as tight as ever.
Like every other trip, he found himself wondering why he’d bothered. He should just stay home, wither away, let himself be lost to the ignominy of time. That would be easier for everyone; the townspeople would be happy to have him gone, and he’d never again have to experience their derision and hatred.
Castiel smiled a little and brushed his fingers over Crowley’s tattoos.
“How did he seem?” Dean asked, causing everyone to stare at him in confusion.
Cas tried to smile again, but it felt so tight and false. “What do you mean?”
Castiel stared at her, uncertain. He knew that he didn’t need help; he was only four-and-a-half months along. But he dreaded the silence of an empty shower.
A flush rose on Dean’s cheeks, even as his grin turned suggestive. “And you’ll be judging this for yourself...how?”
Castiel looked out to the pool, studied the gently lapping chlorinated water, then finally murmured so quietly that the others barely heard him, “I’ll go.”
"I'm glad."
“Hey, Cas,” Dean murmured, stopping mere inches away.
Before Dean could dissect Cas’s voice or the shadow that flitted through his eyes, a door opened down the hall. Immediately, the blue shimmer passed over Cas’s face again, and he wore the blonde mask with the glowing golden eyes. What Dean found the most disconcerting, though, was his expression. It had gone blank, but in a pleasantly absent way.
“No,” Luci admitted. “We were supposed to leave the bodies for the FBI to clean up, but the jacket had ripped, and I saw the thing on the floor, and I figured...maybe it would be useful. A little collateral, you know?”
"So...what's the verdict?" She whispered.
“So they’re pretty casual about it,” he observed, and Dean nodded, already running to his bedroom.
His words clicked in Cas’s brain. No...no, no, no! This had to be a joke, a cruel joke orchestrated by Amara. She must have realized Cas’s desires for Dean and orchestrated this prank.
“Besides,” Dean continued, “all this roundabout backwards stuff is what will get you off the hook. If all goes to plan, we’ll be able to create our alliance through trade agreements and commerce, not marriage.”
"Have you been wearing those all day?" Dean wondered, and Castiel nodded happily. He climbed back up over Dean, dropping down on top of him to kiss him again.
Dean excused himself to the restroom and took off toward the back of the apartment. But instead of going down the hall, he walked through the kitchen, out to the fire escape. The same spot he’d first met Cas, the same spot he’d first felt that fire in his gut and that need in his heart.
“Oh man, I hope I get a peek at those cars.” Dean rubbed his hands together, already scheming.
“Because Dick had to think that we were in jail, otherwise he wouldn’t have shown his hand. But he did, and now we’ve won.”
Castiel forced his gaze back to his aunt. Two and a half seconds, that was all he could be allowed. Any less, he wouldn’t really be looking; any more, Hester would grow suspicious. Castiel smiled reassuringly, inclining his head to indicate his attention. He knew how these conversations worked; he wouldn’t be required to provide input for another five minutes, at least. He listened to her disparage over pork cutlets for another minute, humming in agreement, before he let his attention wander back to that table.
His phone dinged on the nightstand, and he grabbed it to check. It was from Castiel, saying that he'd been...in church.
Mom died in a fire when he was a baby, so Dad turned to the bottle, and we were left to fend for ourselves. And by fend for ourselves, I mean leave me to raise Sammy and take care of the bills. Luckily the house had been in our family for years, but that only meant I didn’t have to worry about paying a mortgage.
I didn’t ask about Naomi, just let him decide on his own if he wanted to talk about it.
Castiel carefully stepped between the flowers, pausing to inspect one here or another there. All of the flowers thrived, despite the fact that some of them should never have been able to grow together in the same space.
“Anything you bring will be wonderful!” She enthused, distracting M. Winchester just long enough for Cas to extract his arm and hurry for the door.
“It’s Gordon...”
. Actually, the wanting probably came from his damn heat, because it seemed his body was ready to go again. He could see the exact moment Cas scented it on him by the way his eyes dilated with red bleeding through again.
“Now where are you going?” Castiel muttered as he reluctantly followed.
Meg interrupted him with a wave of her hand. “Just take your shit and go.”
Ellen turned away, and Cas followed. But at the very last moment, almost like he couldn’t help himself, his eyes locked onto Dean’s. For that split moment, their eyes held between them, and Dean couldn’t stop his small, hopeful smile. And then, almost of its own volition it seemed, Cas’s face lit a bright red, and Dean felt his heart swell.
to make things better for him, because if he wasn’t good, then I sure as hell wasn’t either.
Dean chuckled. “You’re
He looked back up at them, “We should get going. Jacob has an early start tomorrow.”
Suddenly the cat was there, nosing into the basket. It bit into one of the fish and trotted back into the house, dragging its breakfast with it.
They’d just barely made it through the front door before Cas was back on Dean, crowding him against the wall and attacking his neck with nips and licks.
“Yes?” Castiel’s tone was eager, but in a reserved way, like he was holding himself in check.
Dean took Cas’s face in his hands and wiped the tears away with his thumbs. “Of course I mean it,” he whispered, his expression earnest as he leaned back in. “I’ve never meant anything more in my entire life.”
here?”
“How someone like
As the door shut behind them, Sam sighed. “We’re never gonna get him back.”
The four of them sat around the kitchen table as Dean told Sam their plans.
----------------
.” He stepped closer to Castiel again. “I’d give anything to go back and have that.”
Here, as promised in the notes last time, I have Jess's POV to the story. What's funny is...even though it's the same story with the same basic plot and events...there's no mention of Brady. So for any of you that were just done with his idiotic bullshit, he's never even mentioned here.
Castiel glared at him, half in anger, half in disbelief. Why the hell was some gorgeous asshole so concerned about this anyway? He didn't even know Castiel.
Dean smirked. “Really?”
But then the food began to run low again, with Cas skimping more and more on his own servings to keep the cat fed. The cat somehow seemed annoyed by this. Cas ignored its glares.
Castiel offered Gilda his hand once she and Charlie finally parted, and she shook each of their hands and blushed and stuttered her way through a greeting, but her eyes kept returning to Charlie the whole time. Castiel could tell that they weren't going to get another ounce of attention out of either girl, so he and Dean left shortly after.
"Such a good kisser," Castiel breathed. Dean smirked.
Castiel groaned. Dean stepped back and yanked him off the counter. He spun him around and bent him over so that the dark-haired boy's hands splayed flat on the counter while his ass stuck out perfectly.
It wasn't hesitant or teasing like the previous texts had been. It was direct, demanding. Castiel felt his skin flush in anticipation, his half-hard cock stiffening even further. He leaped up from his bed and ran over to his closet, shoving his way to the very back where he kept the little set of plastic drawers hidden. His little secret stash was safe back here, safe from Naomi's prying eyes.
“You’re going to get yourself in a seriously bad situation one of these days.”
“But you’re better than them,” Castiel reasoned.
He barely passed his finals, but the third donation from his dad had finally sealed the deal on Stanford.
"You don't know what you're saying," Castiel muttered, dropping his gaze down to study his hands. He could feel Dean staring at him, could feel the blush rising up to tint his cheeks under that warm gaze.
“Then we’ll get to know each other very well...maybe rebuild your home.”
As he kept walking, he greeted the few patrons who were here at this quiet hour. He smiled kindly at a young couple who’d wandered in off the street, hands clasped gently between them as they shuffled from piece to piece. They were obviously not here to buy anything; each piece probably equaled a year’s worth of paychecks. But they were studying the pieces, enjoying them, discussing them quietly between themselves. Castiel never begrudged the people who came in to appreciate the art; that was, after all, its purpose.
The cat rushed forward and rubbed against his legs, purring happily. With a shake of his head, Cas turned and continued on to the house, the cat right on his heels.
“What?” Dean wheezed. “I can…?” He looked to Hester, almost as if for permission, but she only chuckled and waved him off with a “Have fun, Dear.”
Cas pushed away from the table, hurrying across the room toward the door. “You should go,” he announced, opening the door and holding it for Dean.
“And were you supposed to take the drive?”
The realization crackled through Castiel like ice, coating his heart and soul, leaving him numb: Amara had told him.
“You had more of my men at your disposal than I did, and all of those extra funds… And for nothing! Not a single arrest!” Cas’s eyes slid shut. “I can’t have another fiasco like that. I’m sorry, but I’m denying your request.”
Dean looked pained. “Cas . . .”
Castiel reached down to rub gentle hands up his torso, nothing more than feather-light touches designed to drive Dean insane. His hands were so soft and and sweet as they traced nonsensical patterns over his abs, his chest, up to his throat and neck; it was so at odds with the rough thrusts of his hips.
He often wondered if Castiel was even alive. Some part of him knew that the witch was fine, but given how much Dean had fought the bond, he didn’t like that. He didn’t like that he kept thinking about Castiel, or rather worrying about him.
Castiel’s phone buzzed again.
“M’ close, Sweetheart,” Dean gasped out, and Cas nodded. Dean pumped Cas’s cock until his boyfriend seized up, crying out Dean’s name as he came. He almost collapsed onto Dean’s chest, but caught himself on his hands.
“I’m sorry,” the alpha blurted. “I should not have been rude to you just now. You have shown nothing but civility to me and my family, despite the difficult circumstances I have left you in, and I’m humbled by that.”
“You know them, don’t you?” Castiel whispered.
Castiel shook his head. “The only way to truly defeat this monster is to find his body in the physical realm. Find Kazimir’s corpse...That’s why I can’t kill him; his soul maintains a thread of connection to the body. You must find the body and perform the spell that will recall and trap it, and then...and then the Council will send him back to hell and seal the gate.”
Meg vehemently shook her head, even as Lucifer stood to match his nephew. “You mean it?”
Over the next few days, Castiel noticed little changes here and there. People who he didn't even know would say hi to him or actually stop to chat with him about class, about life, about Dean.
what’s got you so occupied?”
“A personal protest,” Dean supplied.
“Thank you,” Cas breathed as he reached up for another kiss. “For everything, Alpha.”
They led Cas through the house to the keypad, still lit, still in secure mode. “What happened?” Cas asked.
Cas scanned the area, wondering where Ketch might be, but his one-time schoolmate was nowhere to be found. Even so, there was still a flush to Dean’s skin, a shininess in his eyes. Castiel almost growled at the thought of Ketch being the one to tease those changes from Dean.
“How?” Cas whispered.
“Why have you given years of service in the military?” Dean countered.
“He’s kind of avoiding me right now, Sammy.” Dean sighed. “Even if I did go over, there’s no way he’d come out to see me. I’d have to talk to his parents, which can’t happen because—” He dropped his head into his hands.
Dean chased after his mouth, but Cas dodged away.
Cas could feel Inaias shuffling around behind him, could sense his urgency. Whatever it was, it could wait. “This criminal, known only as The Leviathan, is our number one priority, and we cannot allow ourselves to become distracted by…”
Castiel blushed. "Oh, uh...yeah. I guess."
“Come again?” Victor asked.
I texted.
“Why?”
"Yeah. I was thinking we could meet for burgers or something?"
in danger!”
Dean shook his head, “Nah, I’m not even sure if these are valid anymore. I need to find…” he trailed off, mumbling as he reached for the giant tome at the edge of the stacks. He heaved it at Castiel. “Can you see how long the old Missives of Intent last? Like, would those papers even interfere with anything going on today?”
After, as they dressed again, Dean watched Castiel shimmy back into his skintight jeans with a smirk.
Cas sighed and shook his head. Of course Dean had managed to get free. Cas had given up everything, fucking
Dean smiled. “I love you too, Cas.” He dipped for another kiss, only breaking it once more to say, “And I will spend the rest of my life, if that’s what it takes, to earn your trust back.”
“I took him back.” He met her gaze, and she could see the fresh pain clearly etched on his features, the red that now ringed his green eyes.
Castiel smirked. “And I know the perfect place…”
She did eventually meet Dean, of course. Yeah, he was a bit of a flirt, and it seemed he had a different girl passing to-and-from his bedroom each week. But she also saw how proud he was of Sam, how much hope he held for his future. Sam told her that every bit of money that didn’t go to essentials or bills, Dean set aside for Sam’s college fund.
“Wait.” Dean’s brow furrowed. “Henriksen didn’t send you?”
“Let me know if you hear from him,” Anna requested.
And then Cas’s voice was there, surrounding him, coursing through him. He was babbling in a foreign language, yet Dean somehow understood every word.
“Who is Castiel,” Dean finished. “We’re made for each other, Cas. The alpha gene came from my family. The omega gene came from your temple.” He shook his head. “You and I, we never stood a chance. Even without that stupid machine, we would’ve ended up here together.”
A moment later, Cas mumbled a sleepy “I’m so glad you’re home.” He pressed a quick kiss to Dean’s chest then drifted away again.
Dean shot him a bitch look, but Ketch only chuckled.
Dean spun and started running toward the house, away from the shed. Benny could take care of those omegas. Dean had his own to take care of.
The interaction in the bakery, brief as it may have been, was enough to leave a flustered, unsettled feeling roiling in the pit of Cas’s stomach. He hastened back into the crowd, toward the town square, which would lead him to the trail that—
"You bought them for me?" Dean wondered, and Castiel nodded.
“Hit me and I'll scream bloody murder. I'll scream so fucking loud and hard. And I'll tell them everything.”
“Fine, meet me at the parking lot in fifteen,” I barked at Brady. I spotted my boxers over by the dresser and pointed at them. “Hand me my boxers, Sweetheart.”
Castiel stared at the words, made blurry by the alcohol and pain shooting through his head. Suddenly, it was the funniest thing he'd ever read. Victor had left it there so he would be taken care of, and now look. He was being taken care of, all right.
"Do I think you're compensating for your lack of domestic affection by fucking anything with a cock?" Crowley offered.
“To me?”
“How dare you!” His voice reverberated through the air, shook the ground, quivered with anger. “How dare you attack the mate of your supreme!”
“Ketch?” Dean repeated. “Is that what...do you think that I want Ketch?”
Dean’s shoulders slumped. “Dammit…”
Now that Anna was joining them for dinner, Cas knew that Cassie would find some way to fight back, to push her way in with Dean again. It was only a few nights later, as Castiel guided his six toward the bathroom so they could wash up before bedtime, that Castiel learned her plan.
A wizard who shot bolts of purple and raised armies of the dead invaded London, and the team was headed across the Atlantic. For days they researched the magic, chased the wizard, fought hordes of the dead, but none of it mattered. The minute the team managed to defeat the current army, another rose in its place as the wizard watched from the safety of a floating cloud perched high in the sky.
The few times their eyes met, Dean’s eyes always crinkled at the corners with a beautiful smile, leaving Castiel feeling slightly flushed and breathless, and he couldn't help but smile back. Which was so conflicting, because he liked seeing Dean smile, but he hated the emotional turmoil that erupted in his belly when he realized how
So, I hope you enjoy this update! I'm kind of thinking I might do a couple more, like from Jessica's POV or even Dean's.
“You need to talk to him, make nice,” Sam said. He pointed at Dean as he walked down the ramp. “That’s an order.”
Dean, who’d finally managed to gather everything he needed, ran to the door. He paused at the last moment to turn. “Tell them Father called me home for an emergency or something. I honestly don’t care.”
Castiel swallowed and nodded.
“This is the village where I spent my childhood,” he explained softly. “Brief as it was.”
Pain sliced through him, but before he could spiral any further, Cas continued.
Cas didn’t even feel angry, like he had before meeting Dean. He didn’t feel unworthy just cause his mom wanted to forget about her previous disaster of marriage. No, now he had Dean. Dean had shown him the truth in so many ways: he was absolutely worth every bit of love poured into him.
“Thank you,” Dean mouthed to the server who’d brought the cake to the table. The girl blushed clear up to her roots and hurried away. She was cute, sure. Once, Dean might have tried to get her number, set up a late-night date before he left town again on the next leg of his tour.
Dean blushed heavily, mumbling a soft “thank you.”
“Hello?” He called out as he stepped into the room. “Who’s in here?”
“Was this your plan all along?” she whispered.
“Holy shit…” he breathed, his eyes skimming over the letter. He slowly brought his gaze back up to Dean’s with a repeated “holy shit!”
Afterwards, Castiel straddled Dean’s lap, panting prettily into his neck as Dean stroked his back soothingly.
Castiel froze, his heart picking up its pace, his palms turning clammy.
“To protect my family.” Castiel said this like it should be obvious. “Plus I happen to be a pretty good strategist.”
Dean untangled his hand from the sheet, ignoring the rush of feeling that flooded his hand as he reached down to wrap a hand around Castiel's cock. He began to jerk him in time with their thrusts.
Only then did Cas catch sight of the flowers wrapped neatly in M. Winchester's basket. They were red, with spiked petals that grew atop a long, thin stem.
“Ready for another round, Alpha?” Dean teased.
“You know, when I heard you were back in town, I was so sad that I hadn’t heard from you,” Cas admitted, only lying the tiniest bit.
Sam returned home to marry Eileen, as he’d wanted to all along. John wasn’t happy about it at first, but Dean managed to convince him.
“Gordon? What’s that about?” Frank muttered. “Can I get in on that?”
Castiel felt him stiffen and glanced up at him. "Dean?"
Hannah nodded and began running again, but after a few steps she leaped and let her power carry her through the air.
“Exactly,” Cas hissed. “Because she may be an overbearing, controlling bitch,” he spit the word out, “but she doesn’t make me do anything illegal to prove my loyalty. She doesn’t try to sell me off to some disgusting thug.”
Dean turned to look at the elderly woman, who simply smiled at him.
So New York it would be, and Cas could hardly wait. The only downside was his distance from Dean, but they'd already talked about it and agreed to just roll with the punches. No promises, no demands, just themselves and what they could give. And, as Cas kept reminding himself, if he and Dean were truly supposed to be together (they were) then these years would fly by like nothing.
“Thank you, Estelle. So glad you could make it.” He enfolded one of her hands between his own. “How are you enjoying the Davis piece?”
“I can’t believe how well you’re handling the goddess thing,” Cas admitted. His bright golden eyes studied Dean. “I mean, I wouldn’t be hurt if you had questions or, um...needed some time to…”
“Of course!” Dean murmured, smiling warmly. “I would've asked you sooner, but I didn't know if you'd want that because of...you know…”
“Did you really just lick his hand?” Meg asked, her eyes narrowing. Dean’s smile was smug as he shrugged. At a glare from Cas, though, he pulled Cas’s hand back to press an apologetic kiss to the palm.
The stairs were roped off with a burly security guard manning them, but he didn’t give their group so much as a glance before lifting the rope and waving them up. Both of the girls smiled and giggled at the tall imposing man, while Cas simply clapped a hand to his shoulder as they passed.
Dean's eyes widened at the unexpected attack. Castiel couldn't help his smug pride. Good. Dean had no right, judging Castiel for something he himself had started. Castiel leaned up until his lips were right against Dean's, brushing against them with every word.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I was just being stupid. I assumed everyone knew I was being an idiot, but Brady doesn’t quite catch on to things like sarcasm.”
He did draw up short when they actually got inside the club itself. From the outside, it had looked like a plain brick building; inside, it was a mass of people shouting and music thrumming. A throng of people mobbed the open dance floor, jumping and grinding and laughing.
“You’re practically grown now, Sammy. Between your scholarships and the money already in the college fund, you’ll be pretty set.” He looked over to Cas, who beamed back at him. “Cas and I are going to Arizona for his college. I’ll be looking for a job nearby so we can save up money for whenever we decide to get married.”
Castiel watched the omega slip into the darkness of the shelves, beating himself mentally.
Dean’s heart hurt for the alpha, but he couldn’t resist his jab: “Wow, I wish I knew how that feels.”
Cas finally halted, spun to face him completely, and flung an accusing finger in his face. “Do you,
Dean shut the screen off with a twitch of his finger and shoved the device in his back pocket as he spun to face her. That was enough social media for right now.
“I do,” Sam countered.
“Of course,” Castiel murmured, desperately trying to ignore the blush staining his cheeks. “I just...I understand.”
"Did you have a nice time?"
Dean shouldn’t have told him about Joshua or Pete. He should’ve just shut the hell up and feigned ignorance. He’d learned time and again that people couldn’t trust him for that scheming mind of his, and alphas didn’t want an omega that could outfox them. Plus the age difference, which Dean had never once considered before, was apparently a big deal to Cas.
“Initial contact successful,” Dean reported coolly, a smirk settling on his handsome mouth. “Next contact already scheduled.”
“He got caught up at the base of the mountain, fighting...himself.”
Once Castiel had reached the other edge of the clearing, where he could be safe from crushing any flowers, he settled down on the grass and pulled out his sketchbook. There were so many flowers that begged for his attention, but Castiel ignored them in favor of the Castilleja.
Better Cas endure that miserable end now than Dean find it later at Amara’s hands.
“Do you want to stay for a while? There’s plenty to watch on TV.”
Despite all of the boys he'd had since Victor, none of them had quite met up to a certain standard in Castiel's mind. Even when they were a little rougher, just like Castiel liked it, they still lacked that quality that Castiel so loved. They lacked the power to control Castiel and his bright blue eyes and his pouty lips and his insatiable need to be touched and lov— no. No, he didn't need that other part. Castiel just wanted to be touched. Nothing more.
“I am pretty,” Cas confirmed after a moment. “Or so I’ve been told.”
“No.”
Castiel huffed and leaned away from her.
seen a guy in the mix.
“If you had any decency,” the woman continued to screech, drawing attention from all sides, “you’d disappear just like your worthless mother and sister!”
Still, Castiel obliged him and answered, "Because I never liked any of them enough to date them."
“Is that so?”
Dean smiled as he watched them, happy that Castiel had someone he was so comfortable with.
“I didn’t know we were playing a game.”
The pain finally withered away, leaving Dean drained. He dropped to his knees, then fell flat on the dead grass.
Dean had enough on his plate with running the sanctuary, keeping everyone safe and fed. He didn’t need some sappy omega who’d caught feelings pining after him, especially an omega who was pregnant with another alpha’s pup.
“Well, that part doesn’t matter so much.” She grimaced. “Before she’s named, the Supreme must descend into hell and then return to her body.”
Every step we’ve taken forward, every time we’ve ended up on a new path, we’ve stuck together. Yeah there were tense moments, and more than once I wondered (and I know he sometimes wondered too) if we’d made the right choice about moving in together so young. But those times passed and left us stronger.
He grabbed the plate from Dean and began to shove food into his mouth.
“Look, we’re not unreasonable,” Ellen assured her. “If you testify against the others, the Italian charges will be dropped; you and the others will be extradited back to the U.S. this afternoon. Plead and you’ll walk, with parole, of course.”
As the children started to walk toward the table at the far end of the room, Castiel slowly pushed himself to his feet and meandered toward the door. Dean smiled at the way Cas threw one final glance over his shoulder before slipping out into the hall to join the alpha.
“Are you sure?” Sam asked.
Cas groaned, “Oh my god, just tell me what you dragged me away from my gorgeous boyfriend for, asswipe.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Sam asked for the tenth time since they’d plopped down on the couch. They were alone now in the shared space of their suite, wasting time before dinner.
