Dean tries so hard to sound strong, yelling the words to supply the power he lacks. If he believes he's strong enough to win a fight against his Dad, then who's to say he won't? Who's to say he isn't?
But only so an hour.
Cas dumbly sits up, blinking at Dean as he returns to the present. He isn’t one for daydreaming, but it’s been more common lately, now that he has nicer things to daydream about. “Of course. Sorry, I was... thinking.”
The silence on John's side of the line speaks more volumes than any word he could reply with. Dean had him hook, line, and sinker.
Dean shakes his head, but he's fighting a smile. He thinks of Castiel. "Maybe."
When John finally sat him down a week later and told Dean what happened to Mary, and why she wasn't coming back, Dean didn't speak for weeks. Nights were instead spent staring at the air in silence, and he stopped saying anything to Sam before he fell asleep. While staring at the white cracking pattern of the bedroom ceiling, it was quite likely that Dean was still waiting for Mary to show up and kiss him on the forehead and say it herself. But she didn't.)
"Okay."
"Okay."
Andy snorts and then nods his thanks, disappearing down the sidewalk, most likely to the convenience store.

"Jokes on you," Dean unzips the duffel. "I don't even know what that word means."
Castiel did not bother him, instead choosing to sit very still and very quiet as to not bother him and his rest. But he was curious, of course, as to why Dean didn’t even make a poor attempt to reach the easily accessible blankets.
"Dean," John says darkly. "Step away from your bedroom door."
"Goodnight, Jess."
"Oh," Dean settles back down and smiles at her, drinking from the bottle. The beer is bitter on his tongue. "Charlie, right?"
"Yeah. Pretty," Dean says with a slow nod. "You should get some sleep. You were gone for what? A month?"
(In the early 60s, a young, engaged Mary Campbell convinced her fiancé to move down to the busy beachfront. In the end, he negotiated they would move to the smaller town beside it that shares the same sands. They got married, Mary had her first son, she gave birth to the second, during which complications left the woman in an early grave. But she loved that house. So John never left. Even still, the house remains a home.)
"You carry the world on your shoulders," Castiel frowns sincerely at him. "And for what?"
The honey halo that sits over Castiel's head when the light frames his figure just right. The Ferris wheel; the fair.
"What is it?" Sam asks. Dean stays quiet, waiting for the other shoe to be dropped. He doesn't look away from Bobby, keeping his eyes stuck on him like he'll disappear if he doesn't.
Castiel doesn't say anything for a moment, but then shrugs Dean's hand off of his shoulder. He's about to ask what the problem is when he sees Cas easily pull off the trenchcoat and hold it over his arm.
Sam nods seriously. "Of course." He hesitates before cautiously saying, "We have enough food to spare. If you want to invite him over."
"Sounds great."
The sun was glittering off of the rolling assortment of foaming waves. Sitting in their little riptide, hidden from everyone else, or so Castiel likes to believe. The crabs and the critters like to wander around here the most often, and Dean has grown to believe it's just because Castiel is that special.
Rationally, he has to know that he isn't angry at Cas. He's angry that he finally let himself have something, that he thought he was growing, he thought he might even find a way out of the life he had been carved out to have; stuck taking care of a ghost's house and working his ass off to get this kid to school.
Dean raises an eyebrow at John, challenging him to argue. The suspense finally drops when John throws himself forward to throw a punch behind Dean.
Dean reaches into his pocket and pulls out three dollars. He hands them to Andy. "Go buy yourself a beer or something, alright? The corner store a couple blocks down sells it cheap. And, word of advice?"
"Because, Sam. I'm tired. I don't want to talk about Dad. Just—Talk about something else. Literally anything else. Talk about shitty cartoons or something."
A gentle knocking wakes Dean up from his sleep. He yawns and pulls away from where Cas was linked to him and sits up.
"I'm sorry that I suck at skeeball," Dean comments as they walk away from the stall. He's wearing a grin, nonetheless. "Maybe I could've gotten you one of those fake rings or something. That's a cool tourist thing, right?"
Today felt like every step was taken in a jar of molasses, like his life was counted on a clock where each tick was delayed at varying amounts of seconds. Grief feels weird and heavy in his head. An hour has passed. Maybe three.
Charlie hesitates, the smile on her face faltering into something more of an awkward grimace. "You could say we had a falling out, or something. It's cool though, we're still friends and all that."
"Dean," Cas picks Dean's hands up like they're delicate things, like they haven't done as much damage as John has done to him. It kills him. "Your hands are all scraped up. They're bleeding. Did you cut them on the windowsill by accident?"
Sunny California—The city of angels. Known for its beautiful beaches; with golden brown sand stretching out from here to there and getting in between the toes of anybody who crosses. On this particular beach, foodstands line the pier to trap any vacationers that wander through.
Firstly, Dean needs another drink. He goes to the kitchen in a haze of movement, and he’s drunk before he even knows it.
'Went on business trip. Don't break anything'
It's eleven in the morning when a Charcoal Black 1967 Chevrolet Impala finds its way back home, parking trustingly outside the Winchester house. The keys turn off the ignition, a shadow looming over the pebble pathway leading to the front door. The man who gets out of the car has heavy pockets and his previously clean car was now full of the stench of beer, broken bottles, and ticket stubs.
“Please...”
Dean smiles slightly, huffing a laugh under his breath. "That's probably because I never told you my address, Cas."
Castiel almost smiles at this, the corners of his mouth softly tilting upwards. "If it's no trouble?"
Eli glares at him and shoves the dark-haired man onto the floor before sprinting off. The man falls onto the pavement, which is sprinkled with sand because the damn stuff is inescapable.
"All good things I hope," Dean smiles easily. "He told me about you too. Jody, right?"
Time stills as every word dies on Dean's lips. Every thought in his head is replaced with choked gasps and painful silence. He bites his tongue hard enough to taste iron, bile rises in his throat. He wasn't supposed to say he, he wasn't supposed to say he, he wasn't supposed to say--.
Dean shakes his head, his mouth agape as nothing comes to mind to respond with.
"I was thinking about going to Stanford to practice law," he had said. And with those words, everything hushed into silence.
Dean watches as Castiel considers this, and then he finally nods with understanding and continues walking. "Of course. Do you have any suggestions on a better place, then?"
The waves crashed against the sand in response, but Castiel was no where to be found.
Dean climbs into the ATV and Jody starts driving around, scanning the sands. The sun was shining in his eyes now, dancing on the reflection of brilliant green irises. He squints again at the light, looking among some of the people that decided to show up today.
"Great question."
"No, nothing like that," Dean shakes his head. "I was just..."
Sam leaves the room, and the crumpled paper is returned properly into the trash can. He keeps an eye on both of the other two for the next few days, hopefully trying to notice any positive developments in their dynamic.
Hopefully Sam's scholarships would take a couple of the numbers off the bill, but that would still leave a ridiculous amount of funds for Dean to pay. Realistically he knows that one summer job won't cover it. He'll have to call Bobby, ask him if he can help cover some of the cost...
He scribbles some equations down on the paper, messing around with things that he would unfortunately have to pay for due to the fact John wasn't around; groceries, rent, electrical, plumbing, gas... The number sits pitifully at the bottom of the page.
The clock has ticked its last minute, and these are the last, familiar words on the page.
"We may," Castiel says with a nod.
He imagines the sight that Castiel implies. The blue-eyed dumbass sitting alone, eating a pizza slice in a dark motel room, probably wearing his full suit and trenchcoat get up, and for some reason Dean imagines that it's completely silent. He probably wouldn't even turn on a television, or a radio, or even a cassette. The thought makes him unbelievably depressed, and he isn't even the one in the daydream.
The words sit heavy on his tongue, and a weight of finality falls on his shoulders, because this feels real for the first time. He's going to do this. He needs to; even if it'll take the entire summer of slaving away and damn near killing himself to do it.
Yes, that is what it was. It was a whimper, which with no doubt belonged to the blond haired man in the front seat. A whimper that sounded much like a mewl; a weak and desperate cry from a man that was barely a man, and that was much closer to a boy.
He passes an alleyway, and like a broken record, he hears the beginning of a world of hell as the trouble stirs in the shadows.
They're just smiling at each other now, letting the peace settle in between their words and soak into their skin. Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel. "Do you think Sam and Jess are still at the darts stall?"
"Well—" Dean pictures Castiel in his mind. His deep voice, his dark hair, his fond expressions. His angel eyes. "—They've got a nice soul. Which sounds really cheesy, but that's really the best way to describe them."
Dean steps onto the sand and drops the sodas next to a foldout table someone had set up. "Hey, Sammy. What'd I miss?"
Then, it’s a sped up movie of him doing something or other, the alcohol really is making things fuzzy, his limbs feel loose and warm and his only goal is to reciprocate Cas’s heartfelt declaration.
Dean raises his eyebrows. "Do tell."
They take their shoes off as they walk along the beach, Castiel walking with purpose beside him and staying in complete silence. It's nice, though. There's nothing but the sound of the deep blue tide (I love you) washing up on the sand and the gentle whirring of wind through the air, and Dean feels comfortable and calm, not feeling any need to fill the space with hollow words or conversation.
•Inside Out, Zedd and Griff
As the sun was fading into a smear of dark indigo hues, a bonfire could be seen on a pile of wood at the sand, crackling and licking at the air with its flames. People gathered around it, already laughing as they passed around cheap alcoholic beverages.
He must look so human, hunched over a library desk and furiously scratching a pen over a postit note with furrowed eyebrows and a deep glare. Although, he definitely wasn’t human, and the intense emotion and speed of which he acted made him resort to writing in hasty Enochian.
Dean huffs. "It doesn't really matter, alright? Everyone knew Cas wasn't sticking around anyways. You shouldn't be sticking around either. I'm still going to try and work for more cash. I'll work weekends if I have to, I'll spend nights hustling pool for the rest of the summer. But you have to promise to look for scholarships every second you're not doing work, okay? I'm not doing this crap alone now that it isn't some big surprise."
"I like the Roman Candles," Jess says excitedly, standing up and pulling Sam up with her. "Do you think we can find some?"
"Have you ever considered using aloe vera?" Castiel asks, tilting his head at Dean.
“Yeah, no kidding,” Sam scoffs. He looks at the thrown out note on the table. He was almost fearful; until he sees an Enochian translation book as well as several papers spread out of the table.
It certainly nurtures peace when he likes to show up without notice, which is exactly what he did this morning.
The day continues slowly after that, but he's thankful because he's still dealing with the adrenaline high of saving somebody for the first time—at least on this job.
Bisexual, for one. Dean is starting to have the word cycle in his brain like a bicycle marathon. It felt right; an invisible medal shown over his heart that he didn't quite know how to be proud of yet. It was something to work on, especially because Dean needs to be proud of Castiel. He knows that he's at the very least attracted to Cas, if not men in general, and he wants so badly to be proud of dating Castiel.
After Jody telling stories of what her daughters have been up to, Bobby talking about lifeguards on other shifts being goofy, Sam talking about school, promoting Castiel to light up and explain the intricacies of ancient irrigation systems, they finally decide to call it a night. Jody heads home; she tells Dean to keep the stoneware that the casserole was in, that she didn't like it anyways. She tells him how proud she is before she goes.
The words circle his brain like vultures, and suddenly he can't move, and it isn't Monroe punching him, but John. His muscles tense but make no move to punch back, to push away. He just sits, letting himself get hit mindlessly.
"Well, the brother who abandoned me in a different state would be Gabriel, but I come from a very large... dysfunctional family," Castiel says carefully. "I have several older siblings, many cousins, and an Aunt who I've never met."
With the passage of time, Dean learned to believe that the right person wasn't worth finding, if they had the chance to leave. His inner thoughts would scold him occasionally, for sounding so much like John. And sometimes, they sounded an awful lot like Mom.
Sam gives Dean a pitiful glare. "Dude," he whines. "I told you not to embarrass me."
"Do you look like somebody who gets to tell me what to do?" John sneers, stumbling towards Dean, his arms swinging at his sides with his drunken stupor. "You think you're a man now? I remember when we brought you home. You're no smaller than you were then."
But, while the snow grows thick over the air, Dean is shivering in the driver’s seat of the impala. He does not have a blanket, despite there being a supply of heavy wool ones in the backseat for this intended purpose. Instead, he wears nothing over him but his clothes and leather jacket.
"Dean, you're getting water all over the carpet," Sam points out. "And you look like hell. Jess was about to go home anyways. We can do this another day, alright?"
"Well, I don't like sunburns."
•Would That I, Hozier
The place is just how Dean had remembered it to be as a kid. He hadn't been there since Mary passed, admittedly. Never had the time or emotional energy to do so. But things felt different now, and he felt safe to do this with Cas at his side.
If anybody had asked Dean whether or not coming out would be important to him a year ago, he would tell them that they were crazy and that he didn't know what that even was. But growth has stretched over Dean this summer, and he feels happier; taller with pride. He feels his smile get brighter and he knocks on the door of the room.
Five dimes. (That's the same amount sitting in the mason jar on his desk.)
He puts the bags down on the table and looks over at Dean, and that's when he pauses and his face switches to concern in an instant. Dean would have laughed if he didn't feel so empty.
I love you.
As he walks to the front door, even the sunflowers seem to droop in a sense of dreadful self-preservation, despite the sun shining a hazy glow over everything—including the window of Dean's bedroom.
Dean has this unshakeable feeling that he isn't saying the entire story; concealing certain truths with a blackout marker before speaking. It occurs to him that Castiel has spoken like this for the majority of time that they've met. It was like he was holding his breath, needing to encode everything that he says so that his feelings are hidden.
It stung to rap his knuckles on Cas's hotel room door, but as soon as he does he regrets it, as his chest suddenly tightens with nerves. Which is weird, for Dean. He knows surely that there is one thing he could pride himself on about girls, and that was the way he was never nervous.
"You can't prove anything." Castiel's voice thrums deep from his chest, and he sounds as though he's speaking through a smile. "But if I'm making you soft, then you make me strong. Maybe you'll let me hold you up. It seems as though you only have experience doing the holding."
"You came prepared," Dean huffs in amusement, and begins writing his number down on the woman's arm. He winks at her when he gives the pen back.
If things aren't safe, if they still are walking on broken seashells when the sun rises tomorrow, and John is still pissed off even after making blood spill from his first son's punches, then maybe he'll consider going to live with Cas.
Castiel doesn't even twitch, instead looking very concentrated and serious at the sparkler in his hands. "I didn't think it was, Dean."
"So," Sam speaks up, looking at Dean as if he's the most fragile China plate in the cupboard. "What happened, Dean?"
"Are you crazy? No! You're going first."
Dean watches him go with a tired sigh and then continues walking down his original path. His fist aches from where it hit the other man's face, and no doubt his knuckles will be bruised by the time he gets back home.
Dean finally looks up from the steering wheel, and looks at Cas with an expression that could not be discerned. It brushes away quickly, like one of the snowflakes melting on the windshield.
"Screw 'em," Dean says firmly. "Put out what you believe in the world, Cas. I can tell you have a lot of good thoughts in there. Real good ones, nicer than anything the Bible has to say, I'm sure."
She looks back at Charlie and squeezes her hand again. "We never have to go surfing again, okay? Never again."
•Last Kiss, Taylor Swift
They wait outside the City Center for minutes until Sam comes walking down the steps with a backpack slung over his shoulder. Dean watches the confusion pass over his face as he spots them in the crowd.
"It's a nickname," Dean says carefully. "Do you hate it?"
Except in this particular case, the sunglasses would be—Well, what would they be? It should all trace back to that funny little word that Charlie said the other night; and yet that didn't seem quite right. It didn't fit correctly into Dean's head, and he knows himself well enough to know that if it doesn't seem to fit in his head, it isn't meant to be for now.
It seems like such an odd quirk, to not warm yourself up while it’s freezing cold. Castiel doesn’t necessarily mind either temperature, but he knows from observation that people usually sleep with blankets to permit themselves from suffering such an annoying fate.
"No," Dean says, feeling his heart race. This is what it feels like to fight a fire, he realizes. And suddenly it becomes clear to him that the flames in his chest were never his own. They were always John, they were always Dad, like a parasite that stuck itself under his skin. Now he's battling back on them with all the power in his will. "It's my room."
"A new hotel?"
Dean pauses. He's grown up in California his entire life. Not once has he heard about any secret spot on the beach. More so, Mary loved the beach more than anything, and he's sure that she would have turned that into a lesson if she knew about it. ("The best things are the ones hidden from the eye, Dean," she would have said. "Look closely and think deeply. That's how you find what's truly golden, however long those things will last.")
“It is.”
He looks hot, too, relieved with the breath of air against a thinner layer of clothes. Dean looks at him for a long while, probably too long, but the sun is shining on Castiel's skin now and Dean can't stop thinking about if he would tan or burn.
He hands Castiel the beer bottle in a clumsy movement and grins crookedly. "Great. This is—" (He hiccups, laughs, and continues. His brain feels fuzzy. His hands are really warm. Is Castiel's face warmer, or is that just the lighting?) "—really great great. We gotta get you drunk, man. You—You look—"
He raises his eyebrows once he realizes that the note is written in Enochian, but furrows them with confusion once he realizes that the writing is all... backwards?
Dean, now exhausted from everything that just transpired, then falls asleep. He’s still sitting in the middle of the hallway, but he’s too drunk and tired to care.
He thinks of John, he thinks of Eli, he thinks of Monroe. Things slow. He walks to a house that he's only ever heard of before, wearing shorts and a tank top and feeling the soft plastic of his shoes hit the pavement. It's too hot this morning, with the nearing middle end of the summer heating everything up a great deal as it's own little warning.
With that out of the way, Dean feels like he's in a reasonably good mood. He realizes, as he was walking to Castiel's motel room, that the conversation he had with Sam was his first time officially "coming out". Sam telling him to be proud is a sentence that rings in his head again, and he smiles slightly. What a stupid thing to be happy about, Dean thought. What a dorky thing to be so important to a person— to him.
The seagulls fly overhead to their nests, and as the waves crash, Dean can see them in his head. The blue overlapping the green, dancing together in harmony with the seashells and the kelp—and like the melody, Dean can hear that same whispering voice in his head.
Dean nods, avoiding his eyes.
"I believe the word I used was beautiful," Castiel says slowly. "You have very artistic features, I would say particularly but definitely not limited to your green eyes. They're actually quite rare."
The assumption is correct enough, because the expression that is on Castiel's face is something he couldn't have guessed, and was furthest from flames. Forgiveness. Castiel has forgiveness in his eyes, stronger and more potent than any fire.
Before?
There's a tense silence at the table for just a few seconds, with nobody wanting to say anything that would escalate the situation into further awkwardness or conflict. Finally, Jess, who Dean is starting to believe when Sam describes her as an angel, speaks up with a polite question.
"Dean." A smile. A blue ocean of tears in his eyes. "I love you too."
"Thank you, Dean."
Castiel looks up at him in surprise. "I don't think it's something worth expressing gratitude. I was only doing what I needed to, Dean."
Dean doesn't respond, moving around peas with a plastic fork. He keeps his jaw clenched and just sort of nods.
Dean frowns and leans his forehead on the other man's. He couldn't explain anything being said in his head. It was like all of his thoughts were stuck in time and mixed and matched and upside down and backwards, and all of the other contradictory phrases that make a brain hurt.
Was John reaching for the stereo drunkenly? Did the car crash into him or did he crash into it? Did he gasp? Was he afraid, or was it over before he could even think? Was he in Heaven now? Did John even deserve to go to Heaven at all?
Castiel half-smiles. "That's very sacrilegious, Dean."
•Angel Eyes, ABBA
CHAPTER 6 1/2
"I didn't know you were big on wildlife protection," Dean comments. But it does make sense, when Dean really thinks about it. Castiel seems the type to protect anybody who needed it, even if it were a bird that was a feather flight away from death. Dean is reminded of the first time that he had seen Castiel at all, when he was talking to Eli about how he had been wrong about the Bible's use of homosexuals, or something to that effect. "It's cool," Dean says quickly afterwards.
Castiel looks at him carefully, and Dean once again has to shift under his gaze. To him, it felt like Castiel looked at him with the intention of staring right into his soul, learning about every atom in Dean's body just because he could. Considering they weren't even on a last name basis, this made Dean uneasy to say the least. But there's something in his head telling him that, maybe he wouldn't mind being on a last name basis.
"What, you know that guy?" Sam looks at him. "He doesn't look like your crowd."
"Aw, don't say that," Sam nudges his shoulder. "You don't have to be so humble. Take the praise, you deserve it."
Dean guffaws and chokes on his laughter. He picks up a beer. "Alright. Fair enough. You can't blame me, though. He does have the damndest eyes."
Sam doesn’t say a word in response, but he thinks back to many of the conversations he’s had with Dean himself. The man was obviously just as in love with Cas, even if he had a funny way of showing it. He was defensive about that sort of thing, or at least, with Cas specifically, and Sam couldn’t ever understand why so he just left it alone.
"Me? Pfff—" Dean shakes his head. "I'm great. I'm so—so good. Listen."
"Very," Castiel says with a pleased nod. "What do we do first?"
“ass, yur eys lik ocean see with blur, yoe eat burger like me, salad without Sam, love yu, pleas giv me kitsgh -sined Dean”
"Oh," Castiel looks down. "I was hoping you'd be able to assist me in finding a new hotel."
"Well, I like both."
“Okay.”
Castiel doesn't shout, he doesn't snap or push Dean around. He doesn't force Dean forward into a bruising kiss behind closed doors. He doesn't curl his lip in disgust or disappointment and lower his tone when Dean shows up with gnarled hands. He never looked angry, which is essentially what began and ended Dean's dislike of him at first.
"From—From biting into your—?" Dean blinks at him and then shakes his head. "You're freakin' weird, Cas. Never change."
"I got beat up," Dean repeats. Something in the back of his head nags at him to say something about Castiel, but for some reason he wants to conceal it, like it's a dirty secret. He frowns slightly. "The same assholes from a few days ago."
He brings a hand up to Dean's face, wiping away a tear that had fallen onto his cheek. "I love you like the tide loves the sand, Dean. I'll never be too far away."
So here he is.
He hesitates, staring back at him, and then sighs. "Nothing. There are a lot of things I'm thinking about, Cas. Things I've... never thought about before."
Dean picks the mason jar up and is about to destroy it, almost needing to watch the quarters spin uncontrollably on the floor of his bedroom, to hear the glass shatter and watch it spiral in different directions. But the glass of the jar causes the moonlight outside to reflect in his eyes.
"Did you ever know?"
The anger in Bobby's eyes quickly is replaced with a roughly created worry. "How are you not dead, boy? You should have shown up after it happened, I would have driven you to the hospital."
“It did help me in the long haul though, I guess. I would’ve died all over again last year if I hadn’t listened to him.” Dean says this with a joking tone, supposedly fed up with the ‘chick-flick moment’ as he calls it. “Then you would’ve had to pull me out again.”
Sam smiles, looking as if he just won a small victory. Dean doesn't think about why, and leaves the kitchen to go wash up. Not to impress Cas, but because he really did smell like sweat and blood, and that wasn't very attractive. Not that he wanted to seem attractive to Cas, he just—
The pretty pink blush that blooms on Castiel's cheeks tells him that it was exactly the right thing to say. Castiel quirks a bashful smile and looks down. Then, he sets the mug of coffee down with a clink on the table and sighs. "I've been thinking."
Choose one, Dean thinks in the back of his head. The corner of his mouth drags up into a bitter smile as he thinks of a list. The fact that he gets hit whenever his dad is home, the fact that he only just turned twenty one and he's paying for the house himself, the fact that he misses his mom sometimes, but only when the house has settled for the night and Sam is asleep. The fact that, deep down, he isn't jealous Sam is going to leave to somewhere better, he's just terrified of being alone.
He figures that if he had lost the love of his life, he would keep something around like the ocean to remember them by, too.
When Castiel doesn't say anything to argue, Dean nods awkwardly and walks down to the stands. The thing he isn't expecting to see when he turns around with a map in hand is not only Eli, but Eli's father as well.
Dean gives him a side-glance, which usually means that Castiel should not have asked that question, and that the topic should be moved on quickly with a rough grace. But this time, he sighs and looks back in front of him.
Somewhere, as simple as the crash of the waves or the ringing of bells, something tells him that this was going to be the start of something very special. Very, very special.
The corner of Dean's mouth quirks up in his first smile of the day. "That's nice to hear, Cas Shurley— 'cuz you're all I need."
"You excited?" Dean looks over at Castiel.
"I did something stupid," Dean answers. Embarrassment and shame seem to chop his words shorter.
-castiel saying that seagulls are cute and dean looking at him like he is absolutely batshit insane
Dean clicks open the soda bottle and hands it to Castiel, who opens his eyes and takes it with a grateful nod.
Dean laughs, tossing his head back. "You got a pen, sweet thing?"
When he was a kid, his Mom used to say how much she loved the ocean. That she loved it so much, she had to move right next to it just so she could tell it that she loved it every day. She told him that, you should appreciate what you have, you should never hesitate to say "I love you" to the things that bring you joy.
Sam has a multitude of questions, of course. The date of it being written, for one. Castiel has been acting normal lately, so has he been hiding the fact that he‘s been so upset all this time?
Before Bobby or Castiel can defend themselves, the phone rings on the coffee table beside Dean. He reaches over and picks it up immediately when he recognizes the number.
Dean is still awkward about this, still clumsy while sweet, so he goes to put his hand on Castiel's cheek and pulls it away. "Can— May I—?"
It isn't a question. Dean pulls his hand back, trying to ignore the flush that's making him look cherry red. Something in his eyes darkens as he remembers Eli again, with his nose bent in an unnatural direction and his blood-stained teeth, his sweat-matted hair and his sobs—
Dean swiftly turns his head from where Cas was walking towards him. He looks at Sam, who is waving at the side of his face and giving him an incredulous expression.
"You did not offend me," Castiel says eventually. "As for the unfinished statement from before... It isn't of import."
Sam has left the kitchen, Dean notices, as he forces himself off the floor with shaking legs. "I'll be right back."
"Hey, Charlie," he greets. "Long time no see. How have you been?"
Castiel shakes his head lightly. "No, I'll be alright. Your name was?"
"Dad came home," Dean says shortly. He finds his fingers are too numb to open the bottle he's holding, so he resorts to staring at it instead. It suddenly occurs to him that in order to explain what events took place, he's going to have to tell Bobby what pissed John off.
Dean clears his throat awkwardly. "Anyways. I heard there was a bonfire going on tonight at the beach. You got plans?"
Dean felt empty with a gaping hole rested in his chest, holding a pillow in his arms and shutting his eyes, trying so hard to imagine it was something else. A phantom warmth had him almost smile; but the smile faded when reality hit like a train. He was alone. Truly alone.
He stands up with faltering footsteps and grabs a beer, walking over to Castiel, and hands him the bottle. "Listen. Listen, Cas. Listen."
Dean almost laughs, because damn, this guy really does talk like he smoked a dictionary, but he somehow manages to pull through with a simple smirk. "Who says?"
"Just take the compliment, Cas," Dean all but pleads, silently begging for the conversation to be over.
He grows to understand why humans care oh-so much about the way that their hair is styled. (Sam explained to him while he was brushing his lengthening hair that it was because it makes someone confident, and confident is nice.)
"Because," Dean says shortly. "You need to go to Stanford. You need to become the best lawyer you can be, and you're gonna help people. And when you have that diploma, that degree, that stupid hat—" Dean scoffs. "If there's one person Mom is gonna be proud of, it's you. You're not a lost cause. You're gonna be something someday, Sam, and it's gonna be great."
"I think it's incredibly righteous of you to raise money for Sam," Castiel says. "I've been thinking of it a lot since you told me. I think you may just be the kindest soul I've ever met, in all of California and of Illinois."
Dean forces his eyes to the tile table of the kitchen. He feels a burning white tear slowly fall down his cheek. He wonders if this is what heartbreak is.
"You hear me? You fuckin' weirdo." Malicious laughter followed by another familiar sound that had to be a punch to the face. "You're just like the rest of them, aren't you?"
Dean shakes his head. "You don't need any of this crap, Sammy. Aren't there scholarships?
"You were right," Castiel says with a nod. "This place has excellent clam chowder."
Sam was already sliding out of the booth and walking up to Castiel, and Dean is trying to hide his face and look away. The next moments happen without hearing the dialogue. Dean sees them talking out of the corner of his eye, and then he sees Sam gesture to the table. It's painstakingly clear he's trying to convince him to come over and sit down, and Castiel looks reluctant as he finally nods and walks over with him.
The lamplight from down the street faintly illuminated the scene, the scene being some tall shadowed guy holding a much smaller kid, maybe a highschool junior if Dean had to guess, by the jacket collar and punching him with his other hand.
This isn't because he didn't like her. No, not at all. He just was busy. He has other things to focus on. He can't just sleep around like he did in highschool—he learned pretty fast that girls expected more from him than a quick lay, what was to him just something to distract his head. Everyone expects more. (One woman in particular had thunked him hard in the head and yelled at him that he was selfish and would die alone, but Dean knew that already.)
Castiel frowns deeply. "You've had worse than... almost dying?"
Dean flinches for the first time that morning, knowing with a sick feeling that John was talking about Mary. He feels a hand on the small of his back, strong and comforting. Cas. He wonders how Cas looks right now; if he's looking at John with the same intimidating judgement, the one he gave Eli, where he tilts his head and squints and makes whoever is on the receiving side of the stare become caught up in their own head. Maybe Cas was looking at Dean himself, giving him a soft expression full of deep worry and stern protection. Either way, it gives him the strength to stand back up straight. He would not cower now.
•Mr Loverman, Ricky Montgomery
"Eli. My dad is Monroe Styne."
The whisper seemed to settle his confusion enough, but Dean still felt a burning in the back of his throat that even alcohol wouldn't soothe. He knows what he wants. He wants Castiel, if for nothing else than to demand answers to the questions the man put in his head.
It doesn't take long before his brain is nothing but mush, with his words slurred and his thoughts more or less just shapes of colour in his head—which describes his vision just as well. And there's Castiel, sitting in the same place, in the same posture, with the same expression, looking so damn boring.
John narrows his eyes. "So you do. Good for you, boy. Is she pretty? I was about your age when I met..."
So he just whispers the only thing that he can say.
Jess starts the conversation back up after introducing herself, and she's smiling and laughing as she and Sam exchange jokes. But Dean—Dean can't keep his eyes away from Castiel for too long.
"Fuck," he says harshly, tearing off a paper towel and wiping the water off his hands. He tosses the towel in the trash and starts pulling at his hair. "I left the money. It's still in my room. How could I be so stupid? Shit. Cas, I—"
"Cool." Dean sits down with a sigh. "Hey, Jess."
So, he can't take that chance. He'll wait until morning to make a decision.
It’s a rush of information that Cas has never been given before. He’s been kissed before, sure, but nothing was as perfect and blissful as this. Dean’s lips weren’t chapped, they were smooth and warm, tasting sour like the alcohol he had drunken the night before.
"Dean," Cas speaks up. He stops walking in front of a diner and points at a sign. "It says that this place has the best clam chowder."
It wasn't what he meant. If he said what he meant, the words would have come out as: "Please don't leave me with Dad. I don't know if I would survive it."
•Rivers And Roads, The Head and the Heart
"What? No." Dean frowns and puts the fork down. "No, it's fine. Really, it is."
The sun is shining through the kitchen window, illuminating the white tiles of the floor and the dust in the air. They're folding clothes together quietly, no sound except for the seagulls outside and the occasional sound of fabric being smoothed over with a hand. It's domestic and sweet, and Dean breathes in deeply, trying to remember this moment in its blissful simplicity.
But here, Dean sees Castiel, someone pure and holy and good, and he looks over the view as though it's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. The fair, the ocean, the low buildings and stores that sit on the ground, the flatness of this silly little town by the water looks so much more alive through Castiel's excitement.
“I’m sure there is one,” Dean yawns, sitting up to stretch. He squints against the lights. “I think I blacked out last night, though, so your guess is as good as mine.”
"You know, you're allowed in here anytime. You don't have to knock," Dean says with amusement. He sits on the kitchen floor, setting the laundry basket down beside him.
"Sure, Dean."
Castiel brightens up at the request. "Are you certain?"
There's a very pressing silence now, with Bobby staring off into space as he thinks to himself. Meanwhile, Dean is waiting for something, anything that will give him a definitive answer. He's admittedly not liking the fact that he has to ask for these kinds of things more often, these kinds of things meaning help in general.
Dean feels Castiel lean against him, taking him out of his thoughts. He looks over to hear Castiel murmur something about being cold. Dean swallows his pride to put an arm over him, because if there's one thing he can do for Cas, it's to give him warmth. Castiel leans further into his side, and Dean doesn't fight the smile it brings him.
"I definitely did not do that. You need your eyes checked, Sammy. You'd think with you eating nothing but rabbit food, you'd have great eyesight," Dean quips.
"What do you think of Cas?" Dean asks quietly. It was the best segue he could think of, and Castiel was a topic to him that he could think about with ease, now. He hopes lamely that it will soothe his current rapidly beating heart.
•Sunflower, Vol. 6, Harry Styles
If Dean Winchester had a dime for every time he was called beautiful, he would have four dimes.
Dean nods slowly, breathing in the words and letting them stack themselves as armour underneath his rib bones. He wonders what his weakest link really is, if not everything Cas just mentioned.
Cas catches his wrist as it moves through the air, causing Dean to choke on silence instantaneously. Cas carefully looks at Dean's hand with a frown, rubbing his thumb lightly over the nasty bruises that messily lined his knuckles. "You got in a fight."
Listening to Cas talk to himself was like watching a puzzle build itself. Piece by piece, it knit itself together from nothing but a mental picture. Every word he says sounds practiced and well-thought out, which Dean finds exceptionally strange because Cas has this selfless quality that makes him seem like the type to never think about himself even in passing.
(I love you.)
"You are awkward," Dean says bluntly, walking towards the medicine aisle with Castiel trailing after him. "But it suits you, I'll admit. Your brothers sound like dicks."
If Dean knew one thing for sure about his childhood, it was that his parents truly loved each other. With a mind untainted by reality, it was easy to see it this way.
Dean pauses, his smile not feigning but instead he's looking at Castiel in disbelief. "Sorry?"
Castiel's face lights up. "Yes, I was. Do you want to go now?"
The plate of food sits ignored as he goes over to the desk and takes out a sheet of paper and a pencil. Now, Dean was never one to really work with numbers, but he knew the bare minimum and he had to figure out if this goal was even going to be possible.
"Sam, no." John shut him down with such amusement, as if the notion had been ridiculous. He shook his head loosely. "We need you here to look after the house and shit."
Castiel still looks dazed, a mix of dumbfounded and lovestruck
John isn't paying him any attention, instead staring at Castiel with a look of disgust. He was just staring, a flicker of red in his eyes. And like a tea kettle getting ready to scream, slowly building up the high-pitched ringing, John takes another step closer.
Dean suddenly stops in his spot, his hands freezing under the faucet. He left the money at the house. Thousands of dollars were left in his room, no doubt in a spot where John could take it and leave. Everything Dean has worked for, gone in an instant because he forgot to grab it when he was leaving in such a hurry.
"Dean," Castiel says with a worried frown, the kind that furrows his eyebrows. He follows Dean anyway. "Parties are not what you would call 'my scene.'"
The silence that follows his question is uncharacteristic enough for Dean to look over at Castiel from where he sat beside him in the sand. He has an expression on his face that speaks the volumes he didn't say. He looks as bitter as a lemon, like he's holding back a tsunami of thoughts in his head for no other reason than for Dean's sake. Slowly, he furrows his eyebrows. "Dean, do you believe in a Heaven or Hell?"
A blush blooms on the girl's cheeks, and she giggles even more. She blinks with soft eyes and a bright grin, moving to delicately twirl a strand of her hair around her finger. "My friend dared me to get your phone number. Do you have a phone?"
—This is his breaking point.
"They're fascinating creatures," Castiel continues, talking with such openness and honesty. "They're so small, and yet they arguably have the most important job on Earth. We would die without them buzzing around being bees, and that's all that they're doing, really, being themselves and going from flower to flower. You remind me of bees."
"Dad," Dean says tentatively, not stepping any closer to him. "I didn't know you were coming home today."
Castiel doesn't say anything, but he has this look on his face. Something in his eyes that isn't judging, it isn't even curious. It takes Dean a moment to realize that he's simply listening. Cas is sitting there, listening and paying attention to Dean like he's the most important thing in the world. And for some reason, it makes Dean want to talk more, so he does.
The bottle is empty.
Dean blinks, taking the information in. His dad wouldn't be able to tell anyone who asked the colour of Dean's eyes, but of course he remembers Sam's age when it was convenient for him.
Castiel hesitates and debates whether or not he should put Dean’s note back in his pocket at this information, forgetting everything all together, but he knows at this point he’s too far gone to go back to the way things were before.
"The—" Dean clears his throat awkwardly. "You know. The boy thing."
Dean's expression grows heavy. "...We've got to talk."
Dean's stupid grin falls right off his face. He gives a quiet sigh and looks back ahead of him. "No. I get it. You got any updates on that?"
Castiel shakes his head at Dean and drinks from the bottle. Dean watches as the smile doesn't leave his face. It doesn't leave his face when Dean holds his hand out, motioning to the group of people dancing to music. It doesn't leave his face when he takes Dean's hand.
"It's no biggie."
Rough hands that hold his gently, thumbs that grace his bruised knuckles. Black eyes, blood in his teeth.
Dean scoffs, feeling his face heat up. "No I'm not. What the hell do you mean again?"
"That's the least of my worries," Sam widens his eyes and puts his glass of water down on the table. "What the hell happened to you? You look half dead."
"Give you CPR? Yes. We should get you to a hospital. Is there anybody I should call?"
It wasn't a total lie, as John hasn't been around for Sam's birthday since he was three or four. That part of the cake was true, too. The only lie was that Sam was seventeen— just one important year shy of what Dean had told him.
It's the most difficult fight he's ever fought. He will be working on it now, and he will be working on it forever. But it's worth it, he thinks, to know who he really is rather than what he was supposed to be.
"Nah, it's no problem. Just let me get a map, okay? They've got some over by the first aid stands," Dean gestures over to a series of first aid tents that remain set up from the day.
•Cruel Summer, Bananarama
Now his thoughts were all out of tune. What was wrong no longer has malignant residence in his head, and what was right seems grey. Everything in between is balanced on a tightrope, and Dean suddenly needs to be much more drunk. He grabs another beer and guzzles it down.
"Don't you fucking move," Dean says immediately, putting an arm out in front of Castiel. "You don't get to touch him. You don't even get to look at him. Not like you do to me. You're not allowed to hate him."
•I Will Wait, Mumford & Sons
Castiel will promise this until his dying breath. And that, is a promise only a human could make, which he learned from his lover one quiet night driving through the snow.
Dean looks over and gives a pretty lady a brilliant grin. "Hey, sweetheart."
Dean imagines for a second what would happen if he did get kicked out. He was twenty-one, and he already knew that he could handle living on his own when it comes to financials. Plus, Bobby is always an option if he needs an emergency place to crash. He also knows that John's gambling addiction wouldn't just suddenly halt if Dean was kicked out, and that the only person really living in the house would be Sam. Sam isn't even out of highschool, and the thought of forcing Sam to suddenly and all at once be responsible for himself and all of John's shit just because Dean got himself kicked out is something he knows isn't viable.
-Scene with a photo booth!!! Dean holds his hand—dean has a photo of cas to remember him by. Add in chapter 6
Sam raises an eyebrow. "I think he's a good guy. A nice friend, even if he's a little awkward at times. Why?"
When she pulled away, she looked up at him with worry in her big eyes. This is when Dean decided the interaction was too boring to watch, so he turned back to his crayon drawing.
"Meet anybody?" Jess smiles politely. "Sam tells me you have a lot of luck with the ladies."
"No," Sam smiles. "I haven't. I'll tell you if I see him, though."
"Cruel Summer by Bananarama," Castiel says in a monotone voice.
And he wants to go to college. He wants to help people. He wants to do good in the world, and he wants to use his brains in an environment to help him really go far in life, farther than Dean ever will or ever had the chance to go—and Dean can't raise enough funds for him to do it.
And with that, Castiel walks into the hotel. The door closes behind him, and Dean starts the walk back home with a very particular feeling bubbling in the pit of his stomach.
Castiel feels like everything he has ever lost, born anew into something more good than he could ever fashion together in his own mind. And maybe that's the secret between the two of them. The driving force that attracts them together. Maybe that's why time slows for the two of them to stare at eachother and count the freckles on the other's cheeks for just a few quiet moments. Destiny, the wind whispers.
"Yeah?"
The confusion on Sam's face is obvious. It's clear that whatever he had been thinking this was before is gone from his head and replaced with puzzlement. "Sorry, I'm not following. What does Castiel have to do with burgers?"
And Castiel— He's looking all over the place. Dean watches his eyes as they dance back and forth from all sorts of things on the pier, from the ocean, to the people, to the rides. His gaze lingers on the Ferris Wheel, which was a little ways away in blazing white and red colour. The sun gleams a bright yellow over it.
It was an ugly noise, no doubt built upon and held in for so long—And now it had bubbled past lips in a mess of salt tears and strangled noises. This was Dean Winchester. Vulnerable, messy, and broken. Just like his father.
Dean, even now, can clearly recall sitting next to the crib that night and looking at Sam, who was fast asleep with his button nose and long eyelashes. Dean remembers looking at the door and then back at Sam, taking the courage to whisper to wherever his mother was.
Castiel visibly brightens. "Yes."
Until the paper, crumpled and hidden under beer bottles in the bin, somehow finds its way back onto the floor. Dean was only trying to take out the trash, really, but he was a bit tipsy and accidentally stumbled on one of the steps, causing the bin to go flying across the room.
So he does.
Dean volunteers to do the dishes that night, and as he scrubs each plate, he looks out the window. The ocean was midnight black, rolling over itself and flowing easily onto the shore. Low tide.
"Oh," Castiel says with a soft smile. Dean can see the excitement coming off of him in waves.
Human, from the light bursting in Castiel’s chest, on his tongue, in his brain. Human, from the push and the pull of Dean’s lips. Human, from the pure love radiating from every fiber of both of their beings, just for the moment, as notes were discarded on the floor for something better to explore.
Dean huffs, letting himself smile. He then remembers a previous promise that Castiel had made the night before and turns to him. "Hey, Cas, didn't you promise to show me your secret beach spot tonight?"
"That sounds lovely," Castiel smiles back at him.
I tried to make this as in depth as possible, but please tell me if I miss any!
John was putting his coat in the open closet next to the front door. He didn't look drunk, but he had also gotten better at masking his drunkenness over years and years of not wanting to be pulled over by police while he drove. (Dean learned that from a classmate who's dad was the sheriff. He was in sixth grade at the time. The kid said that his dad knew John was drunk, but passed all the tests, so he had to send him on his way. Dean's only response to this had been to pull his sleeve further down to mask the bruises on his arms where John had held him in an iron grip.)
Human.
"I don't know what to believe," Dean speaks up after a long stretch of silence. "Just that my Mom is in Heaven. That's all that matters to me."
Castiel, calm as always, turns his head and looks at Dean with the softest of looks, as if his hard expressions were melted over time by the California sun. His eyes were searching Dean like it was the last thing he would ever see, and he wanted to commit it perfectly to memory.
When he was a kid, he was shorter than the tables and had to stand on the very tips of his toes to read the menu on the front countertop. He remembers how his Mom would pick him up and balance him on her waist so he could see everything. On some occasions, Dean was allowed to go into the back of the kitchen to watch people make the food. The chefs and waitresses were all very nice to him, and gave him apple pie when Mary was waiting tables.
"No," Dean admits. "You?"
"Thank you so much," Charlie's not-quite-a-friend says, looking at Dean tearfully. "Thank you."
The next morning, Dean was at Bobby's doorstep asking if he could join the lifeguarding team and earn a little money. Now he was here, sun beaming in his eyes as he looked on over the beach.
"Stay safe?" She asked him.
"Scared," Castiel finishes for him. Dean nods. "Your feelings are valid, Dean. Your fear--It's okay. Normal. You aren't alone."
Dean stood and the two of them walked, finding the package of sparklers. Castiel goes over to a more empty space on the beach, while Dean takes a lighter out of his pocket. "Do you know how to do this, Cas?"
"Something happened," Dean finally stutters. Bobby must recognize something in his eyes, something haunted and hollowed with nothing left but fear and shock, because he steps aside like he's been waiting years for Dean to show up.
Dean stares at him, blinking with perplexity as he debates whether or not to be offended. Before he can say anything coherent, Sam walks back to the group. Dean scoffs and follows him.
Cas does look like he belongs here. Breathing in the salt, feeling the water gently sway against his skin. Dean wonders distantly if to John, Mary looked the same way.
"'Course, but--"
Despite all the heaviness in his heart, Dean nods; and a part of him believes it. "Yeah... I'll be alright."
"Business trip. He left a note."
This wasn't supposed to be a night of self reflection. This was supposed to be a night of drinking, dancing, maybe a clumsy hookup with some beach girl, and more drinking.
• Lonesome Town, Ricky Nelson
"Stop getting beat up in alleyways."
"You wanted this," Dean says firmly. "Please. Let me do this one good thing. And make me proud by getting that damned degree. Okay? You bitch."
The air is chilly this morning. Dean's fingers freeze as he raps his knuckles against the door to Bobby's house. The old man was surely awake, although he may not be the happiest with visitors this early in the morning. But this was important.
"She asked for me to point out all of the colours in the sea," Dean answers. It isn't a very good response, but Sam seems satisfied nonetheless, so he stands up. "I'm going to bed early. There's a few dollars in the bread cabinet if you want to order takeout for dinner."
As they walk down the street, Dean feels the sudden urge to show the deep appreciation burning in his chest for Castiel's patience, he ducks into an alleyway between the diner and a gas station and tugs Castiel in by his hand.
He had never understood the butterflies-in-the-stomach sort of feeling that came with asking some pretty girl out for a date. But then again, Castiel isn't some pretty girl that tosses his hair around and giggles at all of his jokes.
Dean's smile, feeble as it was, fades in an instant. With all of the pain in his ribs, there's the kickstart lighter of fear, and he feels how fast it grows. He's about to get angry. He can't control being angry, and he knows right now that his anger is because he's terrified of being alone so fast, and he knows that it's because he's broken and jagged pieces of a person who thought they would be loved without a timer.
Eli cracks open the door slowly, a permanent grieving line creasing his eyebrows. It seems to Dean that he's already gotten the news, if the red puffy eyes were anything to go off of. He almost has an innocence to him now, a vulnerability sheltered by a falsehood of protectiveness that he kept over himself.
It sits uncomfortably in his throat. He hasn't prepared to talk to Bobby yet. A cold sweat sticks in his hair. "...Cas slept over."
Jody narrows her eyes at a spot in the water and points at it. "Alright, tell me what's wrong there."
"Five days," Castiel murmurs. "That's when my flight has been booked. I... Dean, I don't want to go."
•Little Lion Man, Mumford & Sons
"Yeah, I do." Sam raises his backpack in his left hand. He was taking free classes at the city center over the summer to count as extra credit, hopefully even a scholarship. Dean isn't surprised that his little brother was more prepared to bolt out of the house than he was. "Also, don't embarrass me. I'm serious, I really like this girl. She's smarter than both of us combined."
•Salt And The Sea, The Lumineers
"Two," Dean replies gruffly.
Dean pauses. A complete stranger wanted to check up on him to see how he was faring after a fight. It isn't the craziest thing he's ever heard for somebody else, anybody else, but the idea that somebody would think about him like this makes him suspicious.
Castiel frowns, his eyes set in a deep practiced confusion at this new variable. Dean was not awake, this was a fact. Why was he making noises, especially in the uncharacteristic variety of weakness, in his sleep?
"Right."
Castiel stares at him with such guilt, such hurt. Dean felt a twinge of regret seeing the offense cross his face. He's finally done it. He's hurt the one person who never deserved it. He feels his silver heart crack in the hands of the man in front of him.
He keeps his eyes trained on the jar, and then begins to speak.
"Of course he doesn't hate you." Castiel's eyes crinkle at the edges— Cas is happy for him. He's giving Dean a small smile, but one that fits beautifully on his face. He just looks so damn fond. "I'm proud of you too."
"Anything. I just like to hear your voice."
Dean gets up immediately, Jody hasn't arrived yet, considering that Dean got here early. "Where is she?"
"Oh," Dean chokes. "Oh, shit. Sam, I'm so sorry. I forgot."
"We should talk," Bobby says resignedly. As they walk down the hall, Dean sends a silent prayer that John wouldn't be sitting in the living room. He isn't, but Sam is, also looking confused and concerned. He must have been woken up for whatever this is, too.
"A note?" Dean presses, more out of curiosity than anything else.
𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦.
He felt strange. His world was as if looking through good quality sunglasses, in the way that everything is shaded darker for better or for worse, and with every step the perception made everything feel more off-kilter. But it's supposed to be good, so the sunglasses stay on.
Dean stood frozen in his place. He didn't dare move. He didn't dare speak. He breathed, in and out, his food going cold on the plate in front of him. His stomach had turned and squeezed, and his chest had been strung tight like a brand new guitar that hadn't been broken in yet.
Dean shrugs. “I guess. Yeah. Whatever, though. It’s fine, Cas. Don’t worry about it. That son of a bitch is dead now anyways, isn’t he? You don’t need to get your revenge or whatever you’re planning in those eyes of yours.”
Above them, loud whistles continue, beams of light streaking across the sky to disappear in bright explosions and smoke. They glitter and dazzle with the stars, fading and being replaced with new fireworks every moment. The loudness mixed with the serenity of the moment, each cacophony of bombblast stars in the sky resonating in his chest and screaming gratuity—grateful that he didn't give up before, grateful that he kept fighting to have this moment, grateful that he was the one with an arm around Cas, grateful that he can have a night as golden as the large sun bursts of light in the sky. As Dean watches the previous batch of fireworks fizzle out, he gets an idea.
The memories of that night blend and blur together like the speckled tongues of the bonfire. They had surely danced, both of them getting progressively more and more tipsy, and they had surely danced together, hand in hand and cheeks in a bloomed rose red.
Dean turns to look at Castiel, who holds out a gallon sized plastic bag, inside holding all of the cash. "Do you mean this money, Dean? Because I made sure to take it when you were climbing out the window. I figured you would want it in your sights. I hope that wasn't overstepping—"
The second is guilt, turning as quickly as a stone in the river. Dean swallows it down. "How did it happen?"
“It was a nightmare.” Dean grits the explanation out. His eyes are still wider than normal, which Castiel chalks up to him not being completely in the present yet.
"Where are you headed to?" Dean asks, beginning to walk next to his side. "Anywhere in particular?"
When life is a repeat of tragedy— a long line of fear after fear becoming true; there are things that come easily into light. Mason jars. Blue eyes. Bottles of Coca Cola. The smaller things in life, piecing together to make everything else, to make you realize that it was all for a reason.
•Dead Sea, The Lumineers
"Well, that was lucky," Bobby scoffs. "Too damn close if you ask me. Do I get to thank him for saving your dumb ass?"
“If that’s really what you want.”
Sam looks up quickly, like a deer caught guiltily in the headlights. He puts a pamphlet down and almost looks as though he's about to be defensive, but he must recognize how exhausted Dean is and frowns. "Are you okay?"
The sun has now risen to a point where it illuminates the sidewalk just behind where Dean is sitting. As he zones back into focus of his surroundings, he hears the annoying voice of the same asshole he hit a few nights before, as well as a leveler voice arguing back firmly.
They leave the tower and she tells him again that he did a good job for the day. Dean thanks her and turns to leave the beach, but sees the familiar trenchcoat of a certain man at the entrance.
He had told her with a weak laugh that he wouldn't, and went home for the night.)
"Take your best guess."
Dean rolls his eyes. "Yeah, yeah. Ready to go, Cas?"
"So, not to be rude," Sam starts with an easy laugh. "But it's pretty clear you're not a local. Why'd you choose to come down here?"
"They're heinous little spazzes. Stole my sandwich one time. I totally freaked. Never liked them since."
Charlie looks over at Dean and wiggles her eyebrows, and Dean only sort of nods, ignoring the embarrassment that was eating at his skull. It was the easiest way to tell her, as well as the cheapest way, as he wasn't saying any certain terms, but it's getting the information across. Charlie lights up immediately, so she must have gotten the message. "You should come get drinks with me, Dean. That's not a request."
"I know. Thank you." Dean runs a hand over his face tiredly, the exhaustion sinking into his pores. The coffee did not give its desired effect, it seems, because he feels even more drained of energy than before.
Dean raises an eyebrow and swallows his food. "Because I've dated half the girls in this town. They all dig it there. Trust me."
John, on the other hand, inhaled deeply. He had a controlled rage now, which was almost worse than his drunken rages. He knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what he said.
Sam is at the door with two armfuls of fast food, some fried chicken place that had opened last year. He pushes his way through the doorway and around Dean. "Thanks for answering the door, I forgot my key. Anyways, I got lunch."
The clock, currently reading 6:15 AM, was early enough. Dean takes his coffee mug and heads out the door. He can see Sam way down the street already, getting onto the bus. One year and that weird guy would be graduating highschool, hopefully going up to college. Dean shakes his head. That kid was growing too damn fast.
Together they walk into the grocery store. Castiel frowns at the comment. "As I've been told. My brothers like to remind me whenever they can that I'm too awkward for my own good."
"We aren't exactly dating," Dean corrects, but the defense is weak and he knows it. Counting the carnival, the laundry--does folding laundry count as a date?-- the coffee shop, and now the July Fourth celebration, they've been on more than enough dates to be considered dating. "I also haven't seen you."
“And it made me... very happy.” The corner of his mouth can’t help but quick into a smile, and he looks down from Dean’s gaze. His eyes crinkle at the edges with glee.
Dean shifts uncomfortably, in doing so moving a few inches away from Castiel. Dean realizes this as it's happening, causing the guilt to increase. He swallows a lump in his throat and tries to ignore the paranoia that Sam is causing by being in the room with him and Castiel. Even just by doing something as simple as folding clothes together, Dean feels a pressure building in his neck. They weren't doing anything dirty. They weren't doing anything telling of a relationship, he shouldn't be feeling this nervous, and yet he is.
Don't fight back. Then he'll go after Sammy. Don't fight back. He'll get angrier. Don't fight back. Please don't let him have his pocket knife this time.
He must remember all of these things, he feels if he won't then he might die. His heart wreaks real grief now, and Castiel is still in his arms. He's still holding Dean's hand.
Dean can't help but agree, forcing his heavy head into a nod. "Okay. Yeah, let's do that."
Dean frowns and pokes his head through the alleyway, more curious than anything else. Though, he'd be lying if he said that something protective didn't swell in his chest at the thought of some random guy who didn't deserve to be beat up.
But Castiel was here, and if Dean was being friendly, he knew he had to apologize if he had accidentally said something he shouldn't. Dean isn't purposefully an asshole. He'd like to think that should count for something.
There's an ugly silence for a few seconds, with Dean staring at his cold food, no longer hungry. The fork hits the plate with a clang as his hands go up to thread through his hair.
“My dad buried me alive once,” Dean says. It is not said in any particular way, because it is such an unusual yet important phrase that the only thing that matters is that it was said at all. “Said it would help me in the future, if it ever happened for real.”
Needless to say, he was reasonably concerned for his older brother.
Dean stands his ground, laughing humourlessly. "You don't want to do this."
He ducks his head down, his eyes still burning with the red heat of tears. He's exhausted, and he's guilty, so he pulls his hand back despite the itching to keep it over Castiel's hummingbird heart. "I'm sorry, Cas."
"If you are a youth in the plan or process of running away, these phone lines will help you get to a safe place. For only a quarter, these phones can be found in train stations, outside of bus stops," the voice on the television calls, the PSA interrupting the Sunday cartoons that Dean had been watching.
"I don't see why that matters, but sure, yeah." Dean shrugs it off casually. Charlie is a good friend, nicer than any friends Dean picked up in high school, but he isn't used to just telling his entire life to anybody.
"I think they'd be dumb not to hire you," Dean says with kind honestly. It makes Charlie smile a little brighter, so Dean counts it as a win. "Sorry about the girl."
Dean doesn't say anything.
Dean reaches his hand and pulls him up. "You okay? Sorry about that. Don't let him scare you."
"Did I miss anything? I saw an ambulance."

•Sugar, Sugar, The Archies
"When you fall in love, Dean, I have a feeling you're gonna fall hard and fast. So... don't lose your wings for someone shitty, okay?"
Three times. Dean had counted them on the VHS tape that it had been recorded on.
Dean gets dressed and pulls on his shoes, and then walks outside his house. Like some sort of foreign routine, contradictory in of itself and yet somehow fitting nicely, Castiel happened to be passing by his house the moment he left the door.
“These eyes are not mine,” Cas replies simply.
mason jar with "Sam's getaway" on it—dean should add his allowance in every time he gets paid (every 2 weeks)
"Cas," Dean says casually. "Have you seen him around?"
"I had more stuff I wanted to forget, then."
The statement is in bitter taste; Dean can tell. He inwardly cringes with the guilt that follows after the words leave his mouth. In all honesty, he was happy to see the man. He had after all saved his life, the least he could provide was a proclamation of gratitude.
The ring of the front door is what causes Dean to force himself up, wiping away tears and keeping his jaw clenched tightly. His hands are shaking miserably, so he keeps his fists in balls. He hates to imagine how weak he must look right now, how dreadful it must seem from an outsider's perspective, so he doesn't think about it.
Mary had sighed quietly under her breath, something private as she was about to repeat a question that was scripted in her brain. Her voice lowered in an attempt to keep Dean from hearing, but he could still hear enough syllables and consonants that Dean understood the gist.
Dean doesn't respond. He isn't used to it; verbally going against the notion that John is, or more accurately, had been, a bad person. Of course John had been a bad person, and an even worse father, but it doesn't seem natural for Dean to voice that after a lifetime of silencing. Even now. Even when John is dead, Sam and Dean are better off for it.
"Me too."
Sam throws him a thumbs up as he walks away, calling out his goodnight as he goes. Dean sees his arm slide over Jess's shoulders in the dim shadows that pass over them as they get farther away.
"You're staring at Cas again."
He was still asleep. His eyes were forced shut, and his eyebrows were drawn with stress. “Dad, please—Le’mme out...”
"Dean?" Castiel asks, causing him to blink back into reality. "Are you alright?"
Dean sits in silence. His head is a blank slate, and he debates getting a drink before going to work. But alas, the clock signals that five minutes have already passed, and he's about to be late, so he stands up and walks down to the beach.
(He continued to make sure they were doing alright after it happened. John was a shell of a man, just a walking corpse. Some days it seemed he was more dead than Mary was.)
"So, where's your friend?"
"I'm okay," Castiel nods. He shifts on his feet. "Can--May I come in?"
"It's currently smashed on my bedroom floor. So yeah. Had."
Sam shoves him away lightly. "Shut up, jerk."
"Uh." Dean shifts on his feet, putting on a fake smile. "Can I help you?"
The backdoor opens with its usual shudder, and Dean already knows it's Sam by the way the footsteps sound. Dean stops folding for a second, holding one of his shirts and staring at it in his hands while Sam walks in. He feels shame make his face hot, so he quickly licks his lips and then continues to fold the clothes in the basket, though a touch faster than before.
He had told Castiel, yesterday when they were talking about it, that the main reason he doesn't want to tell Sam is because he didn't want Sam to look at him like John did. He didn't want Sam to look down on him, instead of up, like he's done since he was just a baby. He didn't want to see disappointment and disgust in Sam's eyes.
Dean smiles at him, deciding not to bring up the fact that he's lived here his entire life, and that the seasalt mochas are better and that the pumpkin spice lattes aren't as good as what everyone cracks them up to be, but the black coffee is good and cheap enough to have in the early morning. "You're adorable, Cas."
The fourth time was now, and it caught Dean so off guard that he stopped walking completely. He gapes at Castiel. "What'd you just call me?"
Castiel had succumbed finally to the heat of the California summer, stripped of the familiar tan overcoat to be replaced with tan skin under a white tank top. He looked beautiful, Dean thought.
Not that Castiel thought that the time mattered too much. After all, it wasn’t such an unreasonably early time, and this has been playing in his thoughts for the past few hours since he got the note.
"I am," Castiel says with an iron tone. "And for good reason."
Sam had spoken up halfway through his pepperoni slice in the way that somebody does when they're about to start a serious conversation. A tone laced with professionalism, carefully placed words, because of how often they had been replayed and thought about in the mind beforehand.
"I know."
Castiel's face lights up. "People say it never rains in California, and it doesn't rain often but there is the rare occasional mist or raindrops. I suppose it's expected, living so close to the ocean. In Illinois it's either freezing blizzards or blazing suns, dependent on the season of course. Here it's either... luke warm or hot. But the air— the air always smells like the salt from the sea. I suppose it's almost calming," he admits. "Only in this town, it seems."
Dean straightens up. "Right. Cas, do you wanna come with?"
Dean gestures to her in support, grinning. "Exactly. Jess, you're a genius. Take my brother's place any time."
Castiel smiles slightly and shakes his head. "Thank you, Dean. Have a good night."
So dawn goes down to day.
"No," Castiel says indecisively, "I was really just going to go back to my motel room and eat dinner."
"Who was that?"
"Ok, wipe off the grin," Jody nudges him. "We've got work to do, kid."
Castiel chooses to get a slice of pizza with some influence from Dean, and they check out. Dean mutters something about the cost being "too damn expensive for just some sunscreen."
“Yes.”
Bobby shakes his head. "Hell. What then?"
But as he stares back into eyes that are the same shade of green as the earth he fell in love with, and not finding anything else more important than Dean, he understands even more about what it means to be human.
(That's what it was like, with the waves crashing against the rocks and the sun shining through the palm leaves. He was just trying to hold on to the seconds, when he left. There were only so many moments he could have. Blue eyes. Eyes as blue as the sea.)
“Please what?” Castiel responds, his face still drawn in a strained confusion. “Dean, what’s wrong?”
But, like the tide, the waves in life shifted and tumbled into oblivion. Dean, aged 5, brought home a friend, and gave John a nervous smile and told him, not for the first time, that he had brought home his person. He thought it would make him smile, to bring up an inside joke, but John instead grew red in the face and sent the kid home with several expletives. Dean wasn't allowed in for dinner that night; and he never brought people over after that.
Castiel nods quietly.
Dean motions to his face. "Take a wild freakin' guess, Sam. Just—Whatever. forget I said anything."
Castiel glances at him from the side and tilts his head, urging him to continue.
"Remember, Jess is coming over tonight for dinner," Sam reminds through a mouthful of cereal.
"Why did I expect him to stay?" Dean mumbles. "I knew he was leaving. I told myself every night that he was going get on that freaking plane."
•Arms Unfolding, dodie
Castiel does not laugh. His heart is as cold as the white powder blanketing the outside earth.
"Does the sun sting?"
Dean looks away at the sound of a familiar voice, and turns around to see Charlie from across the beach. Charlie meets his eyes and grins wildly, waving at him with her usual exuberant energy. Dean notices that she has given herself bangs in the past few days that he hadn't seen her.
On the other hand, it's just as possible that this is just a painter's mess of extra paint on a canvas. Spills of a plan smeared without thought or reason, subjective to look like art or not. This could just as easily be nothing, or a hallucination in Dean's head, which he realizes as well.
Then the memories of last night roll through his brain, some muddled, some clear and distinct, and each one painted with a wave of exhilarating danger.
Something in Dean's head clicks then, and he quickly looks over at Castiel. A wave of guilt washes over him, because he knows that he got Cas into this danger. John was a skeleton in Dean's closet, and while Castiel was nearly locked inside it he still saw all of the mess; John Winchester in all his blazing ugliness, with his harsh hands that shoved Dean into the jagged edges and angry eyes.
It was addicting. Even the gentle clash of teeth made Cas feel alive, like he was just as buzzed as the bees pollinating the flowers outside. Kissing Dean was everything he imagined it to be, like electricity and warmth, like blood and bone, Spring and Winter, sun and rain.
Dean feels Sam staring at him and he drags his eyes away from Cas. "Anyways. We should go do sparklers or some shit."
"Are you alright, Dean?" Castiel frowns at him with a deep concern. "We should get you to a hospital. You nearly drowned, I had to resuscitate you."
"Kiss me, please," Dean murmurs. "I don't want to forget you."
They’re okay.
"What's on your mind?" Castiel murmurs. Dean turns to find him looking with a tilted head.
"I'll think about it," Dean says finally. "I'll... We'll see in the morning how things fall into place, alright?"
Dean shakes his head. "You look fucked up, kid. What's your name?"
As soon as he comes into view, Castiel stops looking and stands up with a straighter posture, turning to him. His eyes carry across Dean's body, and though he must have been evaluating Dean's healing injuries, he still can't help but flush. "Hello, Dean."
"Right, Sir." Dean cleared his throat and avoided Sam's eyes. "To be honest—Sammy, I don't want you to go. I mean—Come on, a lawyer? That's lame, dude."
John was about to leave on a business trip. His leather suitcase was packed, brilliantly expensive-quality because John had saved good money to pay for a good travel case.
Dean finds it sadistically funny that the universe decided to knock out both known abusive dads in this small shitty town, like in this very moment of life is exactly when it needed to happen. Not when Dean was younger, or before Eli got angry, but now. What was so significant about now?
Hey Editor Grace why don't you chill with the "blue eyes" business? We get it, Dean is in love with cas. Tone it down a little, goodness gracious
His biggest mistake then was expecting a response, and when he didn't get one, he was heartbroken and didn't do it again after that.
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints his eyes again. Dean is about to make a joke about this, probably saying something along the lines of how he looks like a robotic puppy, but he holds his tongue in sport of not wanting to come off offensive for yet another instance.
•The Only Exception, Paramore
“Cas.” Dean snaps his fingers in front of his face. “You with me?”
Dean stares at Sam, not saying a word and having his jaw clenched tightly. He watches Sam process the statement, watches the gears turn and shift in his head, watches as Sam mentally applies the metaphor to the situation-- It's too late to turn back now. Realization crosses and Sam's eyes become lighter, the focused lines on his forehead relaxing as he looks at Dean with a growing smile. "Are you--Is this what I think it is?"
Freakin' weird, and yet Dean can't look away. He pays close attention as Cas almost lets himself smile. The sun melts away at the 'ice' bit of the treat, causing vanilla to drip down his fingers.
"How about I walk you?" Dean speaks up. "You asked for a new hotel place right? I can walk you to one, it's not far."
"I haven't," Dean says slowly. "I didn't know there was one."
Before Dean can put his seatbelt back on, Castiel puts his hand gently on Dean’s arm. (It’s an interesting gesture, as it mirrors the hand print on his other arm frighteningly well, but the context between both actions are so overwhelmingly different that it makes Cas’s head spin.)
Dean smiles a bit and steps to the side, allowing Castiel to walk into the house. He follows Dean to the kitchen.
Jody rolls her eyes and shrugs him off. "Oh, hush. You're totally fine, Dean. I'm glad you took the day off; I would have sent you right home."
Castiel had assured him that it would be fine, and Dean had felt comforted by it, but he also knew then that Castiel didn't really know. Because you never do, until it happens and the coin either falls to one side or the other, or just rolls off the table and disappears from view. And sure, the possibility of Sam hating him or treating him like it didn't exist was low, but even that 1% is something to be afraid of when the person is so important to you. Dean understands that now. He didn't before, but he does now.
Dean halts the words, letting them screech back on his tongue like a car going too fast. It leaves a burning rubber taste in his mouth, which he passes off with the shake of his head and a grin. "What about you, Cas? What's waiting back for you in Pontiac?"
Sam is also one of those people, which Dean got to see as he grew up. He always assumed that the reason for this was because of John, and how John has never let them speak out or voice their opinions. The product of this was Sam having imaginary friends and concerned counselors that would call home. (Luckily Dean was able to answer the phone before John did, to tell the counselors to shove it where the sun don't shine and never to call again because they "got the wrong number.")
Dean is okay.
He slides into a booth and Castiel sits across from him. They each order a coffee and Dean watches as Castiel sips his greedily. Castiel's eyes light up as they reach Dean's. "This is really good. You should try it."
"Excuse me?"
"Your mother sounds very wise," Castiel says gently.
For a while after Sam was born, his small body bundled up beside little four year old Dean while he slept, when John was nowhere to be found, Dean would yawn and wipe his sleepy eyes and whisper that angels were watching over both of them, now.
Dean gets up and throws it into the recycling, and then retreats to his room. While the moon casts over the waves, he stares at how they reflect blue.
"C'mon," Dean smiles weakly. "You know I don't have as big of a vocabulary as you do, Cas."
And again, Castiel doesn't speak. He does look back, though, tilting his head to the side in that same way he has since they met. His expression urges Dean to continue.
The interaction, bizarre as it was, ended there. Castiel left and Dean returned to his lifeguard chair, and the day continued like usual while people of all shapes, sizes, and colours stepped onto the sands of the beach.
"I don't see the connection."
For once, Dean watches as Castiel falters, blinking back at him with wide eyes and nearly stopping completely while he walks. He catches himself just as fast, looking back in front of him. "Nobody, I suppose."
Dinner feels comfortable. Dean feels like he can trust every person at the table, which is a much more meaningful thing to feel when there's more than one other person at a meal. He wishes vaguely that it could always be like this. He yearns for the permanence of safety and comfort.
The mason jar finally disappears, and Dean falls into a peaceful rest. He hears the waves in his dreams. He sees the ocean.
"No, no, really."
"Alright, I'll bite," Bobby puts the beer bottle down on the desk in front of him. "What's the favour?"
Dean rolls his eyes and throws a swift punch to his nose. It wasn't anything that couldn't be fixed with an adjustment and some ice. It was just teaching the kid a lesson. ("I'm just teaching you a lesson, Dean! Fucking learn it!")
