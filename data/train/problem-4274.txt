When Dean laughed, he melted the other man's heart further because the decision to include humor had slightly dulled the tension between them.
"I didn't get to say it back," Dean rushed out, his hands trembling and heart racing, "Cas, I didn't get to…I didn't…" not now, not when he was so willing to think it and feel it but he couldn't form the words. "You're not the only one," he tried with tears trailing down his cheeks. "You're not alone and…we're
By the time Charlie found him again, he discovered that the older man left to return to dinner within the hour and so the two of them walked out side by side to her Harley.
"He's like what? Fifty now?" Alex joked, jumping down from the arm of the sofa and standing back to admire her work on positioning the pinata perfectly in midair.
"In the famous words of Taylor Swift," Cas breath hitched a little and the water splashing around his shoulders, "are you ready for it?"
But he had to admit one thing. Over the years whenever he was hospitalized or was ever sick, Adam and Sam always pooled their allowances to buy him anything that would make him happy again.
Dean nodded and squeezed her hand in an affectionate gesture. “If you asked me that same question like two months ago, I would probably be telling you that it’s stupid and love’s just some fancy word that makes no sense. But I’ve seen what it’s like for other people besides me. Look at Jody and Donna for instance. You’ve seen how they lasted for so many years and they just keep going. And they wouldn’t stay together if they don’t love each other.”
The older man immediately froze up by the fireplace and he turned his stare onto someone who intentionally used his first name fully to deliver a message. Seldom did Dean ever choose sarcasm so when he did, the effect was grand and delivered with a blow that slapped Castiel. "Yes please, and not too hot to scald my tongue."
Tossing his cellphone on the bed closer to the window, Dean shrugged off his jacket and draped it over the arm of a chair. He was so close to losing his mind, being so weak scared the shit out of him. Because his mind felt so fragile, and since he had collapsed after Cas walked out on him weeks ago, maybe he had been pretending that he was okay all the time. Maybe he had been skating on thin ice. Far from accepting the truth. Miles away from believing that he could get better, that he could push through this and survive.
"Why its heart?" he stupidly asked, eyes flicking up to meet blue ones and then returning to his boots. "Why not some other alternative?"
Obviously taken aback by the statement, Dean laughed. “Smitten by who? Taylor Swift?”
It happened right after church, as the congregation dispersed and a light, cold rain began to fall. The problem therein began with the availability of two umbrellas; John of course snatched one to share with Donna to discuss recent break-ins since she was the Sheriff. Dean willingly took the other and presented the situation in clear words to Ellen.
The words exchanged between them left him so bruised, especially the slight on his inability to reveal things easily that he couldn’t believe someone who claimed to know him would react so quickly. So…unfairly after voicing the acceptance the night prior to allow him room enough to battle his own demons before bringing them to the surface. Now? Before everyone? Why was Castiel behaving so insensitive especially in terms of his consumption of alcohol? Was it because of New York?
"Hey!" Dean offered a look of surprise. "I was a pain in the ass?"
All the while, he scrolled on his mobile, legs splayed out in the front seat and evidently tired from his drooping eyes. And I kept glancing at him. Don’t judge me. Don’t you dare sit there and laugh either because if you had the sexiest man on earth sitting next to you
“Being a Deacon sucks, and it’s not all peachy.”
Dean scrutinized Castiel's wide smile and he immediately froze up from fear because there could only be
“You two are so soft for each other.”
“Oh nothing,” Alex tried to bite in her laughter whilst Claire clung to her, doubling over. Sam swayed on the spot even more, gazing up at the moon as if it was the most beautiful thing that he ever saw.
Cas immediately felt the weight of the other man's doubts. "I'll become human, Dean," he said quietly, the stuffed animal tucked in between his arms. "That's the choice I'll make. And like always, I'll do it all for you."
"I'm not even going to ask how far you two have gone because that's private but just don't become a sex addict."
Charlie sighed and smiled dreamily. “He’s so perfect, like he really loves you, Cas.”
Cass and Dean fight and break up.
"Anything?" Dean rested their foreheads together gently, and after he wound his arms around Castiel’s waist, the older man gazed back at him with nothing but openness and love and admiration.
“It’s like bobbing my goddamn head into a barrel for an apple. You’re going to pay for this, Dean Winchester. I swear, you better make sure you’re a mile away when I get out of your restraint.”
There I am going through some books on how to defeat Chuck because I like to swallow all the info I can get, and he appears like right in front of me. Funny part is, and this is where it gets interesting, Cass’ trench coat was missing. So there I was wondering what was wrong with him and why his damn cheeks were flushed.
Firstly, if Castiel was indeed of the impression that he was misconstrued, then all of this would be brushed under the mat. There would be no further reason to worry or to reassess their friendship and everything would return to the way they were. They would try to erase the hurt from their last conversation and try to move past the moment one day at a time.
“Man, are you even listening to me?” Sam nudged his shoulder and finally managed to glance at the screen. “Dude, you get to spend less time with me compared to Cas. You’re going to see him in less than three hours. At least let’s catch up like old times. Does dad ever talk about me?”
Therefore, both of them suffered immensely the day afterwards when the jolting feeling kicked in like being drenched with buckets of ice water because Dean was suddenly invited by his grandfather to Scotland to discuss his future duties as the next King. And Castiel endlessly perused any material and source he could find to locate the Prince’s mobile number.
"Stop playing games with me, man," Dean ignored his father's interruption and could only focus on Castiel who was displaying that he was angered when he was the cause of so much discomfort between them. "Stop making me feel like crap. Stop baiting me and then dropping me hard on my ass because it's not okay. You know, the second I decide to make this go away, without thinking it through, I hope you're happy—"
“I’m tired,” the older Winchester said halfheartedly, then after he peeled off his black leather jacket, he collapsed onto the bed and closed his eyes. Listening though…listening for the door to open. And when the lock turned and there was the rustle of plastic bags, Dean barely opened his eyes enough to spy Cas coming in, his trench coat spotted from drops of rain.
“Is it your life mission to harass me or something?”
"Dean!"
What was he trying to do?
“What did you bring?” Castiel spied the red plastic bowl and tugged open the door wide enough as the wind gushed in and sprinkled snow onto the dark maroon colored carpet. “Please don’t let it be anything containing high cholesterol because I’m actually a high critique of my weight these days. Can’t let this…” he patted his midsection whilst smiling, “…extend at all.”
"Great," Sam quickly closed the book, rose up from the chair and collected his phone. He shot Dean a reassuring smile. "I'll meet you two by the car. Um, take your time."
“What will you say to him,” Ruby asked after a while, “when you see him. Have you thought about it?”
“Bottoms up!” my brother interrupts, bringing three beers in and spreading them around with a wide grin. “Cheers to us for not giving up even though the world is kicking us plenty.”
Her enthusiasm was so catchy, Castiel thoroughly was enjoying it. “Very underrated,” he contributed with a smile.
Giving in to the terrible sight of his friend collapsing under immense mental strain, Dean returned to the seat. Although their hands still remained connected, the feeling was assuring to offer Castiel the support he needed in any way that he could. Dean wanted to understand everything; the sadness, the irritation, the terrible pain and he couldn’t selfishly place his own bruised ego over the wellbeing of his friend.
“Not gay,” he said smiling as they descended the stairs, “not straight either.”
“Did I do well enough then?”
A loud guffaw from John was followed by a hearty laugh from Bobby and Castiel's small smile presented nothing but enthusiasm on a certain someone who spoke immediately after.
Mala took a hold of Sam’s right arm, tugged on it and jerked her chin at the door. “We’ve got to fix this now. People are waiting, remember?”
Castiel couldn’t conceal his astonishment though and therefore stepped back as if severely bruised. “Yes, in fact I
It was like old times. Five years ago, she was nothing short of a maneater and lo and behold, not much had changed.
“Because he kept telling everyone that Sam had a nutcase for a brother,” Ruby said angrily. “He was ranting on and on about how you were fucked up in the head. And I just had to beat the shit out of him. Because I have honestly felt your struggle for so many years.”
The embrace was a bit of a struggle for a few seconds though, because their legs tangled and still the younger man fought to continue rolling their hips together. But gradually he relaxed, flattening himself onto a firm and warm body which felt very much like home.
"You're not. You're simply gratifying disbelief in my admiration for your character. And it's not boding well with me."
“Shit,” I gathered myself up and hugged back tightly. Our embrace contained so much heartfelt love after missing him for so long. “I’m sorry. I was lost in thought there for a moment,” I pulled him into the room and stared back in awe. “What are you doing here though? Aren’t you supposed to be in Texas with your boyfriend Tony?”
The sudden decision to depart for the night, at least one hour earlier than any other occasion was quite unusual. Considering though that a day’s events of frustrating duties could initiate a headache, the older man’s woes were more than enough. And after he bid John a good night, Castiel collected his trench coat and followed Dean out the front door.
type which means that if I want something done, I get it done. I don’t fucking play around…”
“Well,” the younger man tilted his head and never diverted the scrutiny, “I kind asked Sam about it a couple years ago because he’s always spending a shitload of money on his colognes and that’s when he told me that the one you wear is on the list of the most expensive colognes in the world. Which pissed me off by the way because I couldn’t ever buy you one that would live up to that kind of reputation.”
The likes of Jo could perhaps
For half an hour, Castiel pawed through his luggage, trying to find something close enough to a formal attire.
He sank onto the chair.
Winter was coming but holding back her flakes whilst the rest of Littleton held their breaths and amidst the bitter cold weather, something quite unbelievable was happening.
He sighed, blinking profusely as he dipped a spoon into the mix and placed the lump in the pan. "I wonder if Sam wants pancakes? Maybe I'll make two for him. Just to be on the safe side."
"Heartbreak can really damage ya," Donna shook her head, feet curled under her butt.
"I'm not politically affiliated," the dark disheveled hair man reminded the other man.
"I mean, yeah I'm feisty and I want my own way most times," she continued, obviously wounded by the memories. "But he is the only guy who stayed after I showed him how broken I was inside. I could tell him anything about me. Even the bad parts. And he still loved me. It's like you. You get me. You really do and I don't have to hide anything from you."
"Only the best for the King of my heart," the other man provided, leading Cas to the rear of the car. The wind swept up their hair and Dean couldn't stop staring. He really couldn't. Not when Cas looked so damn hot and completely adorable wrapped in his coat. Not when his hair permanently appeared as if he had quite a busy afternoon when truthfully, Dean's mind was swirling with mischievous ideas on how to contribute.
Then suddenly, Sam returned with great news, a bright smile plastered on his face. “Success! The little girl over there lives on a farm not too far from here and her father doesn’t mind if she could have the litter of kittens. I gave him the directions that you gave me,” he nodded at Cas, “so he’ll collect them as soon as they leave here.” Sitting down slowly though, he carefully scrutinized his brother’s lowered stare onto his coffee mug and Cas’ uncomfortable demeanor.
"I mean…for being so gentle with me," Cas said hoarsely, "you held me until I was calm and then you fucked my voice away."
"Cas, I'm going to be out in five minutes tops…"
When the words rested between them for a while, Dean still understood that it wasn’t the right time to confess his feelings because his gut decided that patience was necessary. However, the fearful part of losing Castiel to Hanna was too terrible to carry and although he understood that certain matters needed to be addressed immediately in order to prevent further damage, this wasn’t the time to jump out and admit that he was experiencing jealousy for the third time.
Dean carded his fingers into Castiel’s hair and pressed their cheeks together tenderly. “I know. Believe me I know what that feels like but we can’t go fast, darling. We really can’t and you’ll need to trust me on that because I’ve been there before and I know that the rush is all exciting and gets things going but the feelings die down too fast. Remember when I was chasing you like there was no tomorrow?” When Castiel nodded slowly, Dean wrapped his arms around the other man tighter. “Well, I kept wanting you until it was driving me crazy and then I began to realize that I needed to work on so many other things first before getting there.”
"Well, considering what we've accomplished in less than twenty four hours," the older man chuckled and pressed his cheek onto the glass, entwining their fingers and legs tangled together under a thick blanket, "I suppose if it was possible, then in no time your wish would be granted."
“Not that I’m with him because of his money,” Dean admitted openly and received only a deepened stare, “come on, man. Believe it or not, I’m actually
Now when he thought about how many years passed by without sleeping with a woman, Castiel wasn’t entirely embarrassed. There were women who showed genuine interests, who varied from cultural to wealthy to bland. But he never was the kind of guy who slept with someone after the first date and because he was always bored by their inability to connect with literature and poetry, nothing ever stretched past date one.
"If you weren't so ravished by the terrible wounds of today," Castiel said in his gravelly tone that deepened whenever their lips danced nearer, "then I would kiss you all over."
"Dean, what the heck are you even talking about?" Charlie's eyes were wild. "This isn't a trial period for either of you. It's the
There was nothing that could unsettle him anymore like the days when he used to envy his brother’s happiness with Jess and his children and wish for the same thing. Now, he was entangled in love and experiencing quite a modern definition of what building a future with another man could present. And after picking up the shovel, he dragged it towards the back gate before jabbing away at the ice gathered between the wood. The pieces fell away so easily from receiving the warm glow of the sun throughout the morning thus far, so he was actually savoring the little job being completed.
Slowly, Dean released one of his hands from the cocoon and he reached for his phone. Then unlocking it, he handed it over to Cas who instantly cast his attention on to the screen.
How else could he explain the racing heart and the butterflies awakened inside his chest when Dean sought him out? When the Prince came towards him in a steady pace, a spring in his step and those damn gorgeous green eyes alight with fascination as always? Or maybe his fascination was merely reserved for one man now. Because that was the intent; to pick a prize and constantly try to tease the living hell out of it.
After three rings, because he simply could not allow the stretch of time to become so ridiculous, the line was picked up.
Dean softly pressed a kiss onto the other man’s left temple. “Of course, I will, love. And we will make love in all of them.” The last bit he whispered as the looming castle came into view in the distance.
“I understand what you mean. The support system is essential especially when we’re coming to terms with certain things.”
"You are unbelievable!" snatching the gift from his brother, Dean checked the tag and read his name as clear as day.
Why was this happening to them?
“I had nothing to do with it!” Castiel remarked in disbelief, and their eyes met. “Absolutely nothing to do with your outburst. But it was well enough managed and I admired the passion behind your words.”
Slowly but surely, I emptied out the details with caution because he had a tendency of being a blabbermouth. He’d run to my parents with the information and I didn’t want them to know that I took Dean’s hand and guided him towards my…
He still could have sworn that the world around them became brighter all of a sudden. The moon’s rays illuminated the lawns and the bustle of traffic somehow reached his ears for the first time since coming into the yard. Then the crickets were chirping as if responding to the conversation and somewhere in the other yard, someone was playing Paul Anka.
Dean hadn’t the faintest idea that his
"You could always talk to me, Dean," Sam provided in an assuring tone. "I don't know why you didn't. Maybe yeah we didn't have the time out to get things out in the open. But hey, you could have dropped a line to let me know what was going on. Instead, I had to sit on the sidelines and guess my way pretty much through ten years tops. And I know, Dean," he said when his brother gave him a frightened look. "I know how you feel about Cas. I've known for a long time. Maybe even before you realized it."
Instantly Dean buried his face into his hands, clearly ashamed, and Claire smiled from ear to ear like the Cheshire cat. It was a little too much to tolerate because of the inclusion of a stranger now into the midst of their gossip. Claire, evidently needed to prove a point and her inability to respect boundaries flustered Dean so much. He felt somewhat wrongfully pinpointed as the highlight of the conversation and wished that she would simply shut up.
Ah, it was such a compelling topic. "Go on," Dean smiled.
"Have you ever realized that the first letters of our names fall right next to each other on the alphabet? C and D? Coincidental?"
Then the worst part of her life ended up happening in quick failures of digging into the discovery of who her parents could be. Her mother turned out to be deranged inmate serving a life sentence in a prison in the USA. And her father wanted nothing to do with her.
"Dean," Cas answered after the first ring, his voice husky and underlined by slight worry.
Could he ever find a woman who would match the things these two special people spoiled him with? Thus far, there was only so much that he was ever exposed to that tarnished his belief in ever discovering someone else who would care for him in all the ways he desired. And because he was never exposed to anyone who extended their love enough to prove that he was worthy of going the extra mile for, Dean was left with a best friend who would pluck a star from the sky if he asked.
"We were talking about Charlie—"
"Then let me love you, you know? Let me…" Dean squeezed the older man's hand and tried a smile despite worry eating away at him, "…let me kind of chase the stress away by reminding you that you're amazing and my superhero and you're everything I want. You're my supernova…" their table was quickly approached and his words faltered.
Dean smiled after Sam's confession. "Good to know you just admitted you love her to me."
"And I love you too, Cas, I…" Dean shook his head as tears clouded his vision and he drowned in pools of blue, "I…can't live without you."
"Might come in handy when Cas comes back," Sam shrugged, avoiding eye contact as he smiled. "The reunion between you two will be epic."
"I'm here! Dammit," Dean hopped out from the doorway leading into the depths of the bunker. Decked out in a crisp green short sleeved shirt, the exact color of his eyes, he had also tugged on a pair of jet-black jeans.
“Badly done, Dean!” Castiel delivered his most famous line only used in extreme cases. “There
“Don’t mention it,” Sam shook his head. “But they got our IDs.”
"Really?" Cas' eyes glistened with tears.
"Then tell him that it's not. Tell him that you're going to wait on him for as long as it takes and that you love him. And you're having fun with the baby…let him know that you're okay. Go on…" she nudged his arm and offered a lopsided grin, her pink beanie twisted sideways. "Dean, I'm not pressuring you to do what I want you to do. If you want him over here, then go for it. But just think a little more about how it would appear to him if you let him do his work, and give him space and then when he's done working, he can come over and be with you…"
"Go ahead then," Sam gestured, providing the other man with the opportunity to speak. "Tell me what on earth could force you to blatantly lie about still being an angel to Dean when he's been thinking all along that you've lost your grace. Do you know how this looks on your side, Cas? It looks bad. The moment he wakes up, he's going to start questioning how the hell he was healed and what happened. And when fits everything together after he figures it out because he will, believe me he will," Sam licked his lips, "he's going to realize that you have been keeping secrets –"
I sighed, shrugged off my jacket and bunched it up before angrily pelting it onto the other chair. “Another horrible day at the office because he keeps confusing me.”
"Is it considered normal if I broach the topic of sex whilst we're eating?" Cas suddenly asked, sitting forward with his arms resting on the top of the seat.
Then…
Like he deserved what had occurred. And over and over again, he kept reliving these small slices of pain and awakening to day after day of the same memories. The same space of time. Twenty-four hours of trying to bring to life Dean’s face inside his mind. Of trying to hold onto his kisses that tasted like whisky and beer and chocolate or beef jerky most times. The way Dean would tilt his head and rub their noses together before kissing him. Biting his bottom lip and tugging playfully. Trying to ruffle Cas’ hair all the time and annoying the hell out of the angel.
“No. Your time is up for now. You’ll get to see them some more later on. But for now, I can literally feel how exhausted you are. It’s late and I’d like you to sleep.”
The words stretching endlessly and going back to the days when he would part the blinds and notice Dean wandering around on the moor by himself, trying to catch butterflies at the age of twenty with a wide grin on his face. He was never like other boys, was never like any other man and now he was too young to suffer, to have to be on the receiving end of violence that Castiel pulled him into. Because he was the one who changed everything between them, admitted he loved him, wished for them to be in a relationship, flaunted them holding hands in public for people to see. He was the one who listened to the gossip and ignored the severity of those words, never believing that anyone would want to hurt Dean because he was in love with
"Dean," the other man said into the hunter's shoulder, his teeth grazing soft skin.
Why had he been questioning every single thing about the Prince's encounter with him in the washroom? And why the hell was he feeling like his heart was about to explode because of the magnitude of the headlines. When in fact, he should have felt angry and deceived?
"Dean, please don't say such things to me," Castiel said weakly, "you are very important to me and this you are sure of. It might not seem like the truth at the moment, but believe me, it is. I would be lost without you."
Charlie frowned, tilting her head to consider his worried countenance. "What's up?"
His words literally tore Dean apart afterwards because Castiel's jealousy towards Anna was always considered but never voiced by the angel himself. Now, those blue eyes were stormy and displayed terrible hurt. So much hurt as Cas pressed a shaky hand to his lips and he inhaled deeply, tears slipping down his cheeks and staining the arm of his trench coat. And Dean…Dean wanted to hold him so much. He wanted to kiss him so much. All he felt was so much pain.
" Sam said smiling. "And don't tell me that he's a great guy and you have so much in common. Because you don't even know who he is. Not really. I've never seen you get so distracted by someone."
"Dean…" the older man croaked, leaning over the stove a little before his left hand found the handle to the oven, gripping it tightly, and those blue eyes fluttered close.
everyone talked about. The evil side that reared up like a volcano and made lots of people cry over the years.
Are you asking me if I brought any other dates here? Because you’re beginning to sound a little jealous or a little too concerned. “My two best friends and I hang out around the bar every other Friday. Can’t remember the last time we got a chance to come out here though. With classes and all; our schedules have been pretty hectic.”
I just sat there staring at the blinds fluttering by my window, my feet had gone cold and my hands numb.
“Then why are you…” Dean extended his hands and wrapped Cas in a hug at first, forming an X in front of the angel’s chest.
"Look, I see us getting married, okay?" Dean jumped the gun and braved it all. "And stop looking at me like that, Cas. I swear, you're making me feel like a teenage girl."
“Too much to ask for?” Dean rolled his eyes to the ceiling and glanced away, “call me old-fashioned but sex isn’t first priority for me. I mean, he’s good looking but my mind doesn’t go there as yet.”
“Dean, don’t,” Castiel sounded as if he was crying, the composure in his gravelly tone weakening, “I need you to be sober when you talk to me because at least your—”
"Hey," he greeted with a small smile, his eyes briefly meeting blue ones. "Cas."
"A story for later," the hunter pressed a soft kiss onto Cas' forehead and brought forward the flowers that smelled fresh and wonderful. "These are for you."
“I wouldn’t say that I’m perfect,” shrugging, the younger man scratched the back of his neck.
"Promise?"
him, but it couldn’t be. It couldn’t be possible that there would be memories…And so, he turned around and faced the owner of intense green eyes that stared back at him in awe and confusion and disbelief.
“What about your obsession with Hello Kitty?”
He tasted like champagne, cheese scones and mint and every single time they kissed, the beautiful connection of honesty and pureness succeeded in drawing both of them in. If possible, it was like kissing each other for the first time. Castiel always managed to lace Dean’s mind with a kind of feeling that covered his entire body in a warm sensation that curled his toes. And no matter how many times they came together in the most intimate way, Castiel tasted tantalizing and beautiful.
Those blue eyes welled up with tears. Tenderly, the angel linked their fingers and in that moment, Dean understood and he hated himself even more for focusing on his desires instead of the rest of people who mattered. Jack had become like a son, one that he shared with Castiel, the two of them coparenting and maybe the guilty notion of their bond shared with the Nephilim was just that…guilty. But Dean loved the little guy.
"Hand job," Dean cleared his throat and listened for the sound of the Impala returning. "Blow job too. I feel so violated. Dammit."
“I am trying here—”
“We don’t…flaunt,” the older man said with barely a trace of a smile, obviously displeased by the appearance and likes of the ghost from the past that should have stayed away. “It’s a surprise to see you returned. I must admit that your departure seemed most definite.”
of us stay dead? There's always another way and we'll find it."
"Amanda?" he awkwardly stood up and hugged the flouncy woman, now a brunette, awkwardly. "Damn, what are you doing here?" She was decked out in a short red dress, enough cleavage to cushion anyone's aching heart and the brightest shade of lipstick to match her clutch purse.
"The fuck I will be held back…by
“And that is fine. Give yourself time to settle enough. Love will come easily when it is most needed.”
She tried hard to avoid smiling because his evident love and adoration for her friend upstairs was very admirable. “Dude, relax before you strain your heart too much,” punching him on the arm playfully, Charlie chuckled. “He’s got a fever, headache and mild cold with sore throat. But you know that Dean’s a fighter.”
"Well that was awkward," Dean said softly, his chest swelling as he turned back to the one person who had changed his life and smiled. "Are you still jittery? Because I'm still shaking. Look at my…hands."
"Yeah, sorry about that. You knew some of what happened already," Dean shrugged and finally sipped the concoction before humming in satisfaction. "Damn, this is so good. I might start liking your brother now. Hey!"
“Dude, I’m not going to talk about my sex life with you,” Dean sighed and checked his phone.
“Since we cannot say the words face to face, I want you to send me a text. And I’ll send you one as well with one thing that I’m most afraid of in terms of you. Are you willing to try that?”
Cas blinked, then glanced away, obviously conflicted after the mention of the connection. They had many connections, didn't they? Over and over again.
“I wish I was,” he said with a sigh, lolling his head back onto the wall. The elevator hummed like the thoughts inside of my head. “Then I could get my years back that I lost.
“Hi, love,” he came in smiling and holding up two brown paper bags whilst the entire setting inside The Hub was transformed into complete chaos. “I brought you some lunch.”
"You're not," Dean said softly as they reached the top of the stairs and faced another work of art. This time, it was a beautiful sunrise between mountains. "Ian didn't do this one. I bought it from a street artist in Rome. He didn't want money for it although I begged."
Their second kiss was even better than the first since he held the upper hand and because he did, Castiel usurped his power. He took his time though, rubbing their lips together and tasting Dean. He kept savoring the way the senior slackened into his grasp, and after deepening their kiss, he settled on Dean’s lap. By then, the two of them could feel each other through the fabric of their pants, but whilst one was clearly hesitant to explore out of weakening under such domination, the other unbuttoned and unzipped as if he was experienced enough to go further.
It was like having a painful epiphany. The kind that managed to sneak up suddenly and dangerously. Because all the signs had been visible for a long time. He was quite aware that Dean had been struggling with a lot of things. His major suicidal decision to lock himself inside a box for eternity. The loss of their mother that still tampered with his mind. And above all of that, there was one other part of Dean's life that seemed to be killing him slowly.
JANE AUSTEN,
Blue eyes, like pools of ocean that he could dip his toes into and drown inside… "Huh?" Dean blinked and tried to clear his thoughts.
A table on the right provided a resting place for a very lovely lamp and after he switched it on, the older man awaited the appearance of Dean, hands behind his back and a look of absolute adoration on his face after soft laughter followed from somewhere in the middle of the room.
"Where on earth did you find
“Well, he uh,” Dean scratched the back of his neck and appeared bashful, “he kind of does this thing where he keeps lending me books and never takes them back. So, they’re not really mine. But I heard that he has a huge library.”
“My brother, it’s been too damn long.”
Dean, however, was in dire need to prove that he still had some amount of control. So, he tilted Cas’ head to the side gently and sucked on the softest spot on the other man’s neck, willing to leave a mark.
“The Cutest Couple with the best chemistry goes to…” the silence that followed only contained a few whispers, “oh wow. This is amazing. I never saw this coming! Dean and Castiel!”
“Don’t be, love. Just hold on to me like you never want to let me go. Ever,” Dean eased Nessie into a slow trot and he could feel Castiel’s heart hammering away. “That should be easy for you to do, right?”
realize that he practically just asked you to marry him and you turned it down?"
“My boy, everyone knows that you’ve been pining over the angel,” she said with pitiful smile. “What I don’t understand is why you’re filling yourself up with so much hate to replace love. Castiel isn’t such a bad thing, is he? He’s adorable and sweet and feisty and a warrior. And he would perfectly match you in bed if you give him the chance.”
"About you and Cas? Well enough to know you're meant for each other. Cause to be honest, Dean, he's the only one who manages to keep you in check apart from Sam," Jody said with a shrug. "And damn the two of you would make a cute couple."
“How can you still care about me even though I’m being so mean?” Dean’s voice cracked. He rolled over onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. “Dammit, Cas, I hate myself for trying to push you away because you keep coming back.”
Castiel stiffly slipped into the Bentley, wearing the same navy-blue graphic tee with the words imprinted in white. Then when the car drove away from the curb, he spied Ruby lingering by the corner, eating a hotdog and chatting up the vendor. And he wondered how a creature such as herself could maintain a relationship or if there was even a relationship between her and Meg.
have always been gay and that's okay."
Cas was never normal. Nothing about him screamed normal.
On the third day, on the 30
as he likes to put it."
Dean could cling to those scents forever and because he was craving the older man like a drug whilst still awakening from sleep, he began to peel off his clothes in a haste. In that moment, he understood what loving someone mentally and physically felt like, why Charlie lamented on latching onto sex and dipping yourself fully into it consistently. He was intoxicated by Castiel, so in love with him that after entering the bathroom naked, Dean boldly parted the plastic curtain that crackled and he presented himself.
“You boys hungry?” Ellen’s light footsteps sounded on the polished floor as she joined them, dressed as usual in faded blue jeans and a light orange floral shirt. “What are you two looking at so intently? Cas looks like he’s watching the lawns get wrecked by…oh.” Immediately, her attention rested on Jessica tumbling onto the wet grass and a tall, lanky Sam tickling her middle. “Ain’t that the sweetest sight.”
For a long time, the two of them gazed at each other, until John discarded the intense moment and focused on the television clearing up the static to display Judge Judy in all her glory. Even though the room wasn't silent though, the space between them was so serene for a few minutes whilst drowning in each other's eyes.
"Guess you had bad timing," Dean scowled.
I breathed out a sigh of relief. “Thanks. That means a lot to me.”
The angel blade sliced the distance between him and the shifter and in less than a second, found the back of the shifter's neck. But nothing happened. And feeling the penetration on his person, the creature cocked the gun, aimed it at Dean but before he could fire, Sam pumped four bullets into his skull, blowing the shifter's mind literally. And Dean, obviously shaken from the scene that had unfolded, crumpled to the floor and couldn't quite catch his breath.
"Okay, do you wish to order anything else?" Castiel's voice hoarsened, his eyes brimming with tears. "I'm going to try the tuna salad. Would you like one too?"
He automatically thought that perhaps Dean had been wounded. Or he had discovered that Cas was prying and ultimately made the decision to block him out completely.
memories of your vanilla scented teddy bear shaped vibrator."
“A generous amount of reading? Perhaps continuing your adventures at Hogwarts?” Castiel poured himself some more non-alcoholic wine quite gracefully and then returned the bottle to the aluminum cooler containing ice cubes. “Lingering in the Chamber of Secrets? Clawing the Basilisk’s eyes out?”
“Yeah.”
. And just the thought of him listening to that song, brought tears to Castiel’s eyes because it was one of the songs that never unearthed a reaction from him. Never. One of those songs that someone could listen to and enjoy the pain behind the words but never become consumed by it.
trust me enough to talk openly about things that are bothering him. You’ve done this before, several times in the past whereby you chose to withhold the truth but now that we’re…now that I’m
Dean was on fire by the time the horse slowed to a pace beside a stream tumbling over rocks and surrounded by an abundance of trees. He could feel how intimately they fitted together perfectly and the depth of that thirst inside of him to discover more.
"Talk to me," Dean said softly, grimacing from the river of torture coursing through his left arm.
He was so handsome, dressed in a royal blue short-sleeved shirt with black pants. And whilst there was the absence of a tie because he only wore those on formal occasions, Dean was extensively good looking in any attire. Coupled with his youthful features and the soft strands of hair that side swept onto his right temple; he was wildly attractive enough to capture anyone’s attention.
Castiel was opening up like he never did before because no one ever touched him the way Dean did, kissed him in places that felt so tender. Those spots were so sensitive, he wondered how on earth Dean knew where to go with his mouth and how to hold him so close in just the most perfect and blissful way.
When Dean’s mind became consumed by thoughts of their bodies entwined beneath the soft blue blankets, he couldn’t breathe and after leaning into the wall, feeling for the frame of the door, what he instead discovered was warm hands slowly entwining with his own. Hands that could burn his bare skin if they chose to roam freely, fingers that would drive pathways through his hair as Castiel rocked with him, building up a slow rhythm whilst they made love to each other. And he could really feel the hoarse cry trapped inside of his throat already, the way his pants tightened and as those same warm arms wound around his waist.
One night, many years ago, he was walking home with a group of boys and there she was, shoveling dirt into an already dug out hole in the ground. It was a simple joke they supplied back then, ‘you burying a dead body, miss?’ to which she responded by turning black eyes onto them. Her last words were ‘go home before you’re next’. And slowly but surely, she commenced dragging the shovel in their direction, the four of them lingering by the old picket fence quite wide eyed until…
Inhaling deeply, he simply rested the folded bit of paper next to Sam. Eyes squeezed shut as tears threatened to burst forth, Dean did the one thing that had been breaking him for days since. He thought of that one simple name that meant the world to him, and he said it.
"Dean, you're making me cry," Castiel said through soft sobs, his voice weakening to a hoarse quality.
"You have needs," Cas tried in a softer tone. "And so do I."
and really wondered if so far, he really was living his best life. Because judging from the untouched apartment, that was possibly vacant for months, I couldn’t even imagine what kind of man my boss was. In terms of his lifestyle, I hadn’t the faintest idea whether he was a neat freak, or liked to toss his clothes around. Did he sleep all over the bed or stayed on one side? Was he into sports or played any? Did he have a hobby?
His heart beat wildly in his chest from that request but nevertheless, Dean was hesitant. "Are you sure?"
In the process of tasting each other’s souls, Castiel captured the younger man’s thighs into his grasp and hoisted him up, then he rolled their hips together until Dean broke apart from the kiss and hoarsely moaned through parted lips. Staring, and trying to search blue eyes, Dean could only gather his arms around the older man’s neck when he was captured in that position. He gave in completely when they moved, their cocks slotted together and growing harder and just when he could feel himself hanging on the edge, Dean tightened his legs around Castiel’s waist. And he could feel his body unravelling in ways he never thought possible when their lips brushed.
“I’m peachy, you know how it goes,” Dean turned around and walked tentatively up to Cas and they looked at each other silently, blue eyes searching green ones for any kind of emotions. And the scrutiny became so intense gradually, that both of them blinked slowly as if trying to see through the haze.
"Talked about what?" Castiel's mind kept drifting to a wounded Dean after a fight which he wished not to elaborate on;
“No, we’re not.”
“Because when you left London three months ago, you didn’t take half of my heart with you. You took the entire thing, and that’s why I was lost without you. I couldn’t think or breathe. I couldn’t eat or sleep. Now you come back to me and you honestly believe that there is anyone out there who is worthy of my love? Who will make me feel the way I feel about you?”
“Shut your face,” Dean swallowed hard and he locked eyes with Cas. The two of them could still feel the moment when their lips brushed softly like two flickering flames. And they were still living through it.
Sam returns to the library to collect his used coffee cups from the day, then goes on a quick sweep of the bunker to retrieve any other wayward dishes.  A water glass or two from his room, a plate from the study, a mug from the archives.  In Dean’s room, he finds two plates and four empty beer bottles.
There’s no incantations to be said for this spell; instead, according to Sam, it’s a
At first, Castiel doesn’t register the sound, but then Wally taps his own cup in unison.  Then Asa joins, stomping his foot against the deck, and is followed by Rufus.
Castiel clears his throat.  “Uh, no,” he says.  “I’ve just been with them a few days.  They saved me when my ship went down.”
is able to anchor close to the island’s edge.  Castiel shimmies back down to the deck.
“What in Heaven’s name…” says Ishim, their empty water skins all but forgotten in the sight of this phenomenon.
“I know this won’t be the same,” Sam says as Cas tucks the USB into his shirt pocket, “but I hope it helps.”
“I think I’ve earned the right to be excited about whatever holiday I want,” Dean counters.
“Cas!” Dean shouts,
His arms and knees are covered in dirt, grass stains embedded in his jeans.  Cas crosses the distance down the hill quickly with a smile bright enough to rival the sunlight washing down the mountainside.
“That’s okay,” Cas replies, his voice only slightly above a whisper.  “I knew it was a long shot anyway.”
Claire lights a match.
Sam wasn’t shocked, so why should Dean be?
He knows Cas definitely doesn’t have Spotify or Apple Music, and he doubts Cas even has a CD player at the bunker.  Dean’s resistance to new technologies was one of the many characteristics Cas had adopted as his own as he slowly began to prefer the company of humans to angels, all those years ago, and he’s never quite grown out of it.  Hell, it’s a miracle he has an up-to-date smartphone.
“Aw, come on—” Dean starts, but Cas seizes him solidly by the shoulders and turns him, giving him a gentle shove toward the bed.
He thinks it might be peace.
Frank sweeps the torch to and fro, seeing nothing.
At this, Sam does look surprised.  “You didn’t?”
He opens one eye and sees that the mermaid has ceased its attack, and a blade protrudes straight out through its chest.  Dean is standing just behind it, grasping the sword’s hilt, panting and spattered with what must be mermaid blood.  With a snarl, he wrenches the sword back and the mermaid falls limply to the deck, its skin still sizzling around its fatal wound.
Sam and Eileen each give Cas long hugs, and then they leave carrying Dean and the last of their belongings.  Miracle trots up the stairs after them.  Once the door closes, Cas stands alone in the library for a long time, listening to the quiet.  He knows he will still see them frequently, since their new home is only a few hours’ drive.  But he also knows that everything has changed, and it will be a big adjustment.
“Huh?”
So he gets a bowl of water and a cloth from the kitchen and brings them out to the bunker’s garage, where the Impala has sat undriven since the funeral.  When he opens the door and sees the dried blood on the seat, he has to take a minute to compose himself, one hand braced on the Impala's roof.  He takes a few breaths to steel his nerves, then leans in and balances on his knees in order to scrub the blood out of each seam.
of homeless here,” Sam remarks with a frown, earning a dry retort from Dean.
“To have survived what you did,” Missouri continues, her voice soothing as she shakes her head in sympathy.  “You have a strong spirit.”
“I’m sorry about your ship,” Dean says.  “Truly.  But I can also tell you that I’ve seen this thing kill dozens of people — good people, unsuspecting people, who just dropped anchor and thought nothing of it — and I’ve never seen a single survivor.  So you must be some kind of blessed.”
“Can I help you?” they ask.
“Sure I do, but it ain’t exactly a date night kinda movie.”
“Where you find her?” her mother asks, accent thick and lilting.  Castiel has to suppress a shudder; the douen had mimicked the woman's voice perfectly, and now it was eerie hearing it come from a person.
Eileen makes a face, teasing.  “It’s not like I could hear you.”  She pushes the covers back and stands, shivering slightly.
Cas squeezes his shoulders, craning his neck to plant a kiss on Dean’s temple.  “Of course I blew it,” he says softly, and Dean can barely hear him, rapidly sinking into sleep.  “She wasn’t my type.”
As Tallie walks out onto the path atop the breakwater, the wind buffets her hair and nearly pulls her tight wool cap from her head.  Whitecaps froth on the open side of the ledge, spitting salt.  The horizon is broken up by land, dark amorphous masses atop the water that overlap and make it impossible to tell where the mainland ends and the islands begin.  Cushing Island is the only one that sits apart, fully in shadow as the sun rises from directly behind it.
It’s a sunny afternoon in mid-June when Sam gets the call.
Cas shakes his head again, tears dripping from his chin.  “That’s easy for you to say, you’re the only thing that
“Would this be different?” Dean blurts out suddenly, the moment the thought occurs to him.  “If you still had your grace?”  His heart is fucking pounding; he can barely hear his own voice.
, but he also can’t deny that she is a
A horizontal spar attached to the mast, from which a sail is hung.  The yard refers to the entire length of it, while the yardarm is only the outermost portion on either end.
Without thinking, he stands up and walks out, heading up the stairs and out of the bunker, and ignores Sam calling his name.
“They’ll be okay too,” Jack says, leaning against the fence behind where Cas is standing.
“Because you always leave dirty dishes in your room,” Sam retorts flatly.  “Forgive me for keeping the mold at bay.”
Dean rolls his eyes.  “If now
“Well, don’t get too sucked in,” Dean says.  “It’s movie night.  Eileen’s gonna be here in like an hour.”
Cas shakes his head, desperate to get Jack out of here before the Empty claims him too.  “No!  No, I didn’t.  I went with you willingly.  I was prepared for forever.  I didn’t ask to be rescued.”
Cas laughs, eyes crinkling at the corners.  “Don’t worry,” he says, and kisses Dean on the temple.  “I’m sure you’re still a mystery to some people.”
.  And what I saw…”  He trails off, a shudder coursing through him.  “I want to know.  I need to know.  And if you won’t tell me, then you may as well have left me to drown.”
But they still win.
Spring Point Light is a far cry from the classic calendar-shot of a Maine lighthouse.  Black and white, it sits short and squat like a grouchy Boston terrier at the end of a long rocky breakwater, ocean on all sides.  During the summer months both the park and the breakwater are crowded with people enjoying the sun, flying kites and fishing.  At this time of year it’s desolate.
He can’t answer it.  If he answers, he’ll have to tell Sam what just happened and that will make it all real.  And it’s not real – it can’t be.  Nothing is real right now, not even the concrete underneath him.  Dean lets the phone clatter to the floor and cradles his head in his hands and he
’s mast and the splintering of her hull, his friends and crewmembers dying.  He wants to kill the thing that killed them.
“We’re here looking into any possible leads, seeing if there was anyone here at the clinic he didn’t get along with,” Dean adds.
“Hello,” Cas whispers, daring to reach up and lightly touch the baby’s chest with two fingers.  He can feel the small, short breaths that are still unfamiliar and unpracticed.
“Thank you,” says Cas, pouring himself a mug.  “Remind me to thank Sam for lending me these sleep clothes.”
Halfway down the hall to Cas’s room, Dean stops short and backtracks to his own bedroom.  They’d gone to Cas’s because it was further away from the TV room and there was less of a chance of being heard, and Dean’s only just realized that Cas’s room doesn’t have everything they need.  It’s not like they require a lot of bells and whistles, but there is one thing, and Dean rummages through his bedside table to find it.  He tucks the small bottle of lube into his robe pocket, his heart skipping in his chest as it fully sinks in that he really is about to do this.
“Just thought that maybe I screwed up in the pool.”
"So get this," Sam decided to jump straight to the point, "I have a proposition. And it's kind of a deal. Nothing too dangerous. But hear me out…"
"It's not what you want, I know that," he said whilst his chest still felt light and heavy at the same time, whilst his head became dizzied and steady. "But it's what you're meant to become. This is where you suck it up, believe in yourself that you can do this and take the challenge because it ain't ever going to be easy, Jack. It's just going to keep being this way until you learn to embrace it. And if it's one thing…Cas…taught me…" his eyes tore up and he reached for the door of the Impala because they were still on the road, "it's uh…" Dean reached up to slide a tear away, "…to embrace our fears. So…you…this is for you."
I’m not going to have this conversation with someone like you because it’s too suggestive and can be used against me in a court of law. Instead, my thoughts were forced to drift elsewhere. “How long will you be in New York?”
He couldn’t believe how the younger man’s body trembled from their embrace, and because they were coming together for the first time with the knowledge of how love could overflow from a friendship into so much more, the world disappeared around them.
"Is that the Game of Thrones chick you're sexting?" Dean asked, chewing on a triangle of ham he had stolen from Cas' sandwich.
"Cas, I'm not the kind of guy who would ever push you into a situation just because I want what's best for me, okay?" Dean's voice was broken. "We're just starting out. I keep remembering your fear of me treating you like a one-night stand and I don't want us to jump into this without going slow first. We've been through so much crap recently, whatever the hell was going on with me physically was embarrassing to say the least."
“I love you,” he whispered with the full intent to deliver all the meaning between those three words.
“So, if my father didn’t die,” Dean searched those blue eyes he loved. “You wouldn’t have returned.”
The instrumental music that drifted through the phone during their first phone call was replaced by the sound of Helen Shapiro’s
“Don’t wait too long,” she said, taking up a seat on Benny’s right.
I thought, hey, this is just two ships passing through. Tomorrow morning or down the line, I’ll be transferred to another department and wouldn’t have to see him anymore. I’d waltz into work, pull out my chair, drink my coffee and not worry about being called into the CEO’s office. I’d get a girlfriend too, heaven knows how I’d get one being the kind of guy I was. But I’d manage. And all of these things consumed my mind as I unlocked my door and went into my cozy apartment.
"No, look, okay," Sam suddenly hated himself for cracking a joke in the most awkward time of their conversation, "fine. I'm sorry that I assumed that. Geez, why the hell would I even joke about that. I know that you're not taking this lightly."
But Castiel said nothing.
Dean scrutinized the other man from his disheveled hair to his polished shoes and sighed, chest falling slowly. And even though his intentions were obvious as his answer would be, he still prolonged the words from escaping. He continued to drink in every inch clad with clothes and just imagined what his world would be like if they pushed just a little until there was nothing else left. “Let’s just say you’re like a gift that I can’t wait to unwrap.”
“Well, that didn’t last, did it? Because you thought he was too young and too poor for you, right?” Dean folded his arms and provided a stolid countenance. “Got to tell you, Balth, if I only knew back then that you treated Benny like a castaway, I would have punched your lights out. Not cool, man.”
He could have been biting into the nape of his neck and feeling Castiel writhe underneath him, gingerly grinding their cocks together that were so hard and waiting to be relieved. And he could have been tenderly trailing kisses along the older man's jawline all these years, feeling the light stubble tickle his lips and understanding that he never wanted anything else.
Everything Cass says, Dean joins in and rambles on about a whole bunch of crap that he laughs at but Cass doesn’t.
Ellen, Jess, Jody and Donna entertained a loud conversation from the kitchen about various topics, and John went out onto the back porch with Bobby to knock back a few beers. By the time Dean showed himself, cheeks colored immensely and very much relieved of his prior burdens, he slid onto a chair next to his brother by the table and beamed at them whilst biting his lips.
“Hey, you! Good night, Castiel, I haven't seen you in such a long time!” She said in her usual cheerful spirit and gave him a quick hug. The scent of rosewater and makeup clung to the air along with cheap whiskey and beers.
There was a long pause with measured breathing. Muffled traffic in the background then…
“Please can I sit up front with you?” Cas’ very innocent face peeped through the other window. Those blue eyes were warm like the sunlight hitting the ocean on a lovely day. “I love you so much, Dean. So, so much. I’ll hold your hand whilst you drive.”
Chuckling, the younger man tried to bat back through the day and remembered nothing had changed. "Cas, I'm wearing the same clothes you last saw me in. Blue jeans, leggings underneath, a white vest, black long sleeved sweater, red and blue long sleeved plaid shirt. Brown belt…which is yours by the way. Uh, black socks, brown boots…and dark blue boxers…"
"Wait, what videos, Cas?" Dean's eyes were wide as saucers. By then, his taco was already devoured and the red and white checkered container was resting on the table and quite forgotten of.
“Nothing for now, thanks,” Castiel slowly pulled off his trench coat and draped it over the back of a black leather chair in the corner.
He was hard in his pants, that much Cas could feel evidently. Hard, and straining inside his jeans and beneath Cas' fingers, Dean felt hot and alive and so tempting, that even though the ground was dimly lit and the Ferris Wheel was shadowed, he still wanted to dip his hand inside of Dean's pants. He wanted to feel him beneath his fingers. He wanted to become familiar again with how thick Dean was between his fingers. How his cock would twitch and react to every single stroke and although they were above the ground, Cas felt like they were flying.
I decide to observe.
Dean rolled his eyes though and wondered why his chest ached so much from a heavy feeling that would not disappear. “Obviously. Because Cas looked like Clarke Kent in his huge glasses. Go figure.”
Collecting a heavy blue coat, Dean slipped through one hand and the older man collected the other sleeve to help him. "Guess I am." He winced from the movement of his arm and immediately stepped in further to simplify the process, almost as if he was dressing a child. They gazed fondly at each other, understanding that this wasn't suggestive of usurping a dominant role in any fashion but rather much assistance fueled by love. "Cas, you done doing whatever you were doing over at your place?"
“Oh, right,” his laugh trembled inside of his chest. “When you covered me with the softest blanket and I woke up wondering where it came from. Dean…” capturing the other man’s face between his palms, Castiel rested their foreheads together. “I love you so much. I just want you to know that you’ve changed me in the best ways possible. And I’ll love you forever. You’ll always be my number one priority.”
How was it fair to feel so conflicted about his true self in the eyes of his lover?
When the rain lightened, he quietly unlatched the window and pushed it open enough to let some fresh air into the room. Then at some point after three in the morning, Castiel tucked himself into the nearest chair by Dean’s bed and he fell into a deep slumber.
"That's not love!" Chuck said distastefully. "That's lust. When you were losing your grace, you had physical needs. Dean can't even accept your physical form. He can't even welcome the idea of having sex…with you –"
The silence that followed was painful between them, and filled with angst and a sufficient amount of uncertainty.
Not because he was choking on anger. But he was suddenly washed over with a cold, nervous kind of feeling that weakened his knees and forced him feel like a teenager all over again, gazing into the eyes of someone that everyone had a crush on. And because he was so ridiculously captivated in the moment, Castiel had to fight to push through the haze of his undoubtfully tremendous attraction towards the Prince.
Sam had Eileen back, he was happy but sympathetic and everyone else had everyone. They were complete and beautiful and he was still ripped into shreds and bleeding and didn't want to live anymore because he couldn't. He couldn't spend the rest of his life without Castiel by his side. He just didn't want to do it.
Still sparing himself from the likes of becoming entangled in a crowd of gossiping people, he retreated to leaning against a lamppost. One of those very antique ones. The kind with a shade and a rather intricate looking box attached to the stem. That was set to ignite within the hour of 6 and that it did in just under two minutes.
Charlie, entertaining a cute crush on his best friend…it was a bit prickly to consider but honest and innocent and adorable. However, as he sat there and mulled over things whilst his companion disappeared into the kitchen to poke around in the fridge for a can of Pepsi, Dean wondered if the feelings were mutual. Could it be possible that Castiel viewed Charlie in the same light?
"I'm sorry," Castiel inclined his head and appeared terribly confused. "Are you really and truly asking me to…go out there and dance with you? As your partner?"
Sometimes Castiel would simply astound him with the depth of his experiences in life. He couldn’t wait to know more, thirsty for what was to come and everything else between them. And the more he thought about it, Dean couldn’t find anything else worth living for than to learn everything about Castiel in due time because he was amazing and soft and caring and beautiful.
“We’re getting breakfast,” Cas says, already up and rummaging through his duffel for pants and a shirt.  “I’m hungry, and I need eggs.”
“Sounds good,” agrees Cas, then calls the waitress back over for a coffee refill.
“We keep our ears open,” Dean says.  “Anytime we hear other sailors talking about a new island, we go.  Usually we’re too late and the thing is already gone.”
Criticisms of his taste in cinema aside, Dean’s happy Sam is doing something lazy and unhealthy just because he
,” Dean sings, still drumming his fists against the crate beneath him.  He’s smiling.  “
“Don’t you want to go for your run first?”
“I wasn’t expecting you to die so soon,” says a voice to his left.
“Fine,” Sam relents with a falsely light smile.  “But you’re keeping the car.”
Tonight might be a step in the right direction, though.
Squinting in the newly blinding sunlight, Sam yawns and sets another pot of coffee to brew, then begins to prepare breakfast for his family.
Dean grumbles indignantly, shouldering off his jacket.  “Fine.  But only ‘cause I like it when you take charge.”
Castiel, a weather-hardened boy of twenty-three, climbs the rigging to watch the island draw closer.  He’s been at home aboard the
“I mean, four hunters to a case is kind of overkill, isn’t it?” he says.  “Practically no sport in it.”
Dean yanks him back in, already sick of not having Cas’s mouth on him.  He drags Cas’s lower lip in between his teeth, tasting static.  Cas grinds up on him again and Dean groans into the back of Cas’s throat, the muscles in his shoulders going slack.
A wall within the hull of a ship, typically load-bearing, that acts as a divider between sections.
Cas can’t help dissolving into chuckles as he picks up his book from where it landed.  He’s not sure yet if getting pulled into a Winchester prank war will be a blessing or a curse, but supposes it’s the rent he’ll pay for living with them.  It must come with the territory.
Missouri glances at Marie Helene, then nods.
“Shut the hell up!”  Dean lets the door slam shut behind him before Sam can shout anything else.
” says the TV.
Cas winces, his fingers still tingling as he flexes his hand.  “That really hurt,” he says, more irritated than anything else.  He huffs and finishes putting on his shirt.  The inconvenience is both minor and temporary, and there’s no reason to get so upset over it.  He doesn’t wait for Dean to finish getting dressed and instead stalks to the kitchen in search of caffeine.
Dean steps back, turning away from the sight of Castiel in a pool of quickly-drying blood.  Fury surges in his veins.  Another battle lost.  He seizes a chair from the library table and throws it against the wall, where it splits and hits the ground with a deafening clatter.
Her hands withdraw, leaving him dizzy.
“That sounds delicious, but since when do you like cheesecake?”
The captain’s jaw twitches, still glaring at Castiel, but he sheathes his knife and nods in agreement.  “Back to town, then,” he orders.  “Quickly, now.”
Eileen raises her eyebrows expectantly as he ends the call.
Sam draws a long breath, sways slightly on his feet, and braces a hand against the wall.  Practicality sets in, the still-familiar logistics of a hunter’s funeral arranging themselves as tasks one after the other in his head.  Meet up with Donna and Claire.  Buy gasoline.  Find a secluded area.  Build a pyre.  Salt.  Burn.
, and somehow still considers Dean worth his time.
Dean grins, a smile that’s bright even in the dead of night.  “Well, all right then.”
Her father, confused, lets her back down on the ground, and Feliciana turns and runs back to Castiel, wrapping her arms around his legs.
“We’ve got thirty-five on tap and plenty more by the bottle.”  She jerks a thumb over her shoulder to the far wall, where there’s a truly staggering list of beer names written in multicolored chalk.
Castiel is coughing, eyes searing with salt, gulping in desperate bursts of air.  He can feel solid wood underneath him.  He spits up another mouthful of seawater and sits back, unable to think of anything other than drawing breath.
He looks at the Impala, and she almost seems like she’s looking right back at him, saying
” Dean shouts, jumping up and down in excitement.
Dean doesn’t answer, leaning forward and peering past the bowsprit to the lapping water below.
“I’m starting to see where the piracy comes in,” Castiel remarks.
Fred Sargent’s mugshot jumps out from the pages in the folio.  Scraggly hair and beard, yellowed teeth, dirty skin.  Ultimately, he doesn’t look much better in the photo than he did lying in the cadaver drawer.  The only major difference is the presence of all his body parts.
Sam nods and turns to approach the back of Donna’s truck.  When Eileen moves to accompany him, he gestures for her to give him a moment.
Dean cuts him off sharply.  “Sam, I’m not going to talk about this with you.”
“All right, then.  Occasional pirates.”  Castiel supposes that’s better than pirating
Cas and Sam look at each other again, this time in shock.  Eileen is the only one who isn’t surprised at the sudden arrival, and Cas realizes that Eileen must have been the one to call them.
Sam scratches the back of his neck.  “It’s supposed to open up his mind, I guess.”
“Whoa, whoa,” interrupts Dean quickly.  “Hey.  No.  I just drove like twenty hours straight, okay?  It’s lunch time.  I need food.
Jack reaches out, grabs Cas’s hand.  “You know we couldn’t leave you here.”
The driveway winds upward until it stops just below an alpine cabin with a gabled roof and a large porch.  Dean brakes and the engine rumbles to a stop.  Sam slides out of the car, gazing up at the cabin and the snow-capped mountains in the distance beyond.
Patience stands suddenly, frowning toward the kitchen window before Dean can say goodbye to her as well.  “Someone’s coming.”
.  On the beach, they build a pyre using wood harvested from the tree line, then set the corpses of their dead brethren aflame.
Dean – leans out of the driver’s window.  “Need a ride?”
Cas lets out a long exhale, the first easy breath he’s taken since Akron.  There are now eleven people in the meadow, and all he can feel is gratitude.
Sam presses the call button on his phone, and after a few rings Eileen’s face appears on the screen.  He angles the phone so that she can see both of them.
“What’s happening?” Castiel whispers to Garth, but Garth only grins at him and tells him to wait and see, stomping in time with the rest of them.
“Well, I am
They drive to the bunker, afterwards, and park at the front door beneath the stars.  Inside is an unearthly quiet so heavy and thick that it fills Sam’s lungs, rings in his ears, presses into every corner of the library.  The lights clank on as he flips the switch, and their steps echo on the staircase as he and Eileen descend to the war room.
Cas draws a deep breath, though he feels no air in his lungs.  “I’d like to see my family.  Just for a minute.”
That throws him off guard, and he’s sure it shows in his face.
“Sam knows about us,” Dean relents, not quite able to meet Cas’s eye when he says it.
Cas’s thumb leaves a gentle streak beneath Dean’s eye, and he smiles.  Maybe it’s not as quick or reliable as the angelic power of knocking someone out, but this he can get used to.  A moment later, Dean is snoring.
“Why?”
is tied, and scale the gangplank up onto the deck.
“Nothing to apologize for,” Castiel says, rinsing the cloth in the barrel.  “I’m glad I could help.”
Dean huffs out a breath of relief, pointedly avoiding the remains of the douen’s most recent meal, and begins to cut Jean-Luc’s bindings with his knife.  Castiel braces his hands on his knees, dizzy with the odor clogging his nose, the horrific tableau of scattered children’s skeletons, and the relief of finding two children still breathing.
They hadn’t taken any cases since then.  With Dean completely unwilling to leave Cas alone in the bunker in his condition, and Sam and Eileen both stepping in to help when Dean actually needed to sleep, nothing outside the bunker seemed important enough to leave.
Eventually, Sam and Jack return and find Dean, and the onslaught of questions begins.  Questions that Dean can’t even begin to answer, that choke him from the deepest recesses of his chest.  Jack is distraught – “What do you
Dean blinks at him, eyebrows snapping together.  “What?”
“Really, Dean?” Sam sighs.  “You really think now is the time?”
“I don’t know, to – to explain, or…” Dean trails off.  He has no idea what he’s saying.
Cas’s chest shakes slightly in a laugh.  “You were trying to get me laid at a strip joint.”
The journey back is much slower.  Though it’s mostly downhill, the terrain is more difficult to navigate, especially with two small children.  They leave the den in early evening and it’s not long before the sun begins to set somewhere above the forest canopy.  The light quickly fades to something thick and green, like they’ve sunk underwater.
Cas tilts his head slightly to the side, studying.  “I didn’t have to,” he replies gently.
Dean grumbles something about wanting to see an anaconda, but accepts Sam’s logic.
And most jarring, its legs are backwards — the knees bend in reverse and the feet are turned toward its back, almost giving it the appearance of some kind of mutated bird.
“Six,” says Cas.
Castiel convulses on the floor, gasping for air with a hoarse yell.  The three of them jump as Cas is wracked by coughs, turning over onto his side and hacking onto the floor.
Dean’s head jerks up, his hand stilling.  “Come again?”
“Uh-huh,” Sam says through a self-satisfied grin.
The lights on the garage ceiling flicker to life, blinding in comparison to the soft lamps inside the bunker.  Cas swallows, pausing on the top step with his hand on the rail.  The Impala sits in her usual parking spot, still gleaming through the thin layer of dust.  Nobody’s driven her since they brought Dean’s corpse home from Ohio.  Eileen and Sam have been driving the Valiant exclusively, and Cas, on the rare occasions he’s left the bunker, has been using his old beater of a truck with its squealing fan belt and the air conditioning that coughs out sawdust whenever he turns it on.  He likes the truck fine, but mostly he can still hear Dean’s voice in the back of his head:
Dean turns to face him, his mouth grimly set and sweat already beading on his temple despite the night air.  He draws a deep breath, then gives Castiel an order.
since the age of thirteen, and he’s never tired of the view.
Practically leaping into the fight, Dean slaughters a mermaid just before it can rip Garth’s throat out.  Castiel manages to stab another through the neck as it looks up from eating one of the crewmembers, little tendrils of meat still hanging from its fangs as it dies with an alien shriek.
“Then I’m no good to them on an empty stomach!” Dean retorts.
“Huh?”
, Dean,” Sam retorts.
“I know.  I’m just saying.”
they had had their fair share of pirate encounters, and had survived most of them thanks to being well-armed, but he still has a few nasty memories of the ship being overrun and their cargo hold emptied.
Eileen leans into his side and cinches an arm around his waist.  “We do this together,” she says, and a breath punches out from Sam’s chest.
“Is it good?” asks Sam, because he doesn’t know what else to say.
In practiced unison, Sam and Dean draw their badges from the inner pockets of their jackets and hold them open so Lilah can read them.
“You good?” Dean asks, eyeing Castiel’s bleeding shoulder.
A wry smile tugs at Cas’s mouth, and Dean wants to swallow it whole.  “Well, if I’d known this was happening I wouldn’t have gotten dressed at all.”
“Do you want to watch TV?” Cas suggests, grasping at straws for something — anything — to bring Dean back to a place of calm.
They perform the Enochian ritual first.  Sam takes a spare cauldron that Rowena gave him as a joke for his last birthday and, over a fire outside the bunker entrance, melts down an angel blade
“So you only show up when I’m about to kill myself?” Cas can’t stop himself from muttering, and the words are bitter on his tongue.
.  And even then, throughout the decade he’d lived on the
Eileen’s eyebrows shoot toward her hairline.  “You need some time alone with that?”
,” Gagnon says as he drags open a cadaver drawer, “that this is all we got.”  He yanks back the sheet, and Dean winces.
expect.  It’s not huge, but it’s not small either, mainly consisting of one large room that combines a den, kitchen, and dining area.  A fireplace is fitted into the far wall, a guitar sits on a stand next to a long comfortable-looking couch.  Books line the shelves along one wall and a door to the right leads to what Sam assumes is a bedroom.
deserve it.  You deserve everything you want — more, even — and not because you’ve earned it.  You don’t need to earn anything.  You deserve it just because you’re you.”
Rather than snarking back, Dean only rolls his eyes and goes to follow Cas up to the entrance.
A short rope used to tie down a stowed sail to its yard, tied with a quick-release knot to let the sails fly immediately when necessary.
Something about Dean’s expression must tip Sam off that his unease is deeper than mere embarrassment, because the self-satisfied smirk finally vanishes.  He opens his mouth again, but whether he’s about to apologize for pressing or attempt to backtrack, he’s interrupted by Cas striding into the kitchen from the other door, dressed but yawning and already heading for the coffee pot.
“I’m fairly certain that what we were just doing explains most of it,” Cas replies evenly.  He presses his lips together, not quite hiding a grin.
There are only two eateries open at this hour.  The first is Denny’s, which — ew.  Even Dean’s standards aren’t quite that low.  The second is a small diner on the waterfront, and they have to drive back over the bridge onto the peninsula in order to reach it.  The stars are out, the winter dawn still a long way off, and Commercial Street is dark.  Becky’s Diner shines like a beacon, a blinking neon sign and a handful of cars already gathered like animals at a watering hole.
Eileen’s hand brushes Sam’s arm.  “You okay?” she signs.
The smile splitting Sam’s face in two goes absolutely nowhere.  “Yeah?  You spend the night?”
Inside the barn, there’s blood everywhere and beheaded corpses strewn across the straw-covered dusty floor.  They’ve taken out the entire vampire nest, leaving no survivors.  Dean is over to the right against a large wooden post.
Dean leans back against a post, his mouth tightening.  He digs his thumbnail into the orange and begins tearing the rind away.  “What did you see?”
Later, in the pitch black of midnight, Castiel wakes in his hammock below deck.  It’s quiet, the only noises snores from a few of the other hammocks and waves lapping against the hull.  A single lantern is still lit at the bulkhead, creaking slightly as it swings with the ship and casting long shadows along the floor.
When he’s reassembled, he half expects his body parts to have been reattached in all the wrong places — knees for elbows, head in his groin, whatever the demons find particularly funny at the moment — but instead he’s whole and complete.  He doesn’t trust it.  He’s on his knees, shins sticking to the gore on the ground, hooks hanging nearby, dripping.
into the dimple on his cheek for Donna’s name sign.
“How far are we from town?” asks Dean.  Castiel can hear the exhaustion weighing in his voice, and wonders at how Dean’s even managing to stand upright.
of them are reliable,” amends Sam.  “One of them told me her boyfriend was eaten by Wessie.”
“Keep ‘em coming!”  Turning back to Cas and Eileen, Dean emphatically takes another gulp, leaving a line of foam across his upper lip.  “We might have to move here.”
“Have they looked?”
It’s a moment without fanfare or revelation, perfectly ordinary.  And Dean doesn’t shift uncomfortably or glance at Sam, worried about how his brother might react.  He smiles into the kiss, for all its brevity, and when Cas pulls back Dean’s eyes linger on Cas’s face.
Over her shoulder, he can see Claire and Donna at last sawing the head off the smaller female.  The Nachzehrer who’s holding him at gunpoint doesn’t change, doesn’t transform back into a human, which means she’s the alpha of the nest.  She advances again, making him back up further, until the heel of his boot hits the lower concrete barrier along the very edge of the roof.
They don’t tell Dean, that day, that Cas is gone.
Patience nods.  “I’ll send the cavalry.”
Strangely, Cas barely looks like himself any more.  The trenchcoat is gone, as is the tie.  Instead he’s wearing a white button-down and he looks even more human than the last time he’d lost his grace.  Dean supposes maybe it’s because they both know it’s permanent this time around.
Dean shakes his head.  Frank turns in place, his knife glinting in the torchlight.
He opens his eyes on a bridge over a rocky river bracketed by steep, blindingly green mountains.  An impossibly blue sky and rippling clouds above, fresh air laden with pine.  The Rockies, maybe, he thinks, but he’s not sure.  He’s shocked so deeply by the beauty of it that it takes him a long time to realize that he’s not alone.
Dean nods.  “Yeah, I don’t think the hunter’s life was meant for Sammy.  But, y’know, he was born into it, so when he left my father was—  Well.  He wasn’t happy.  Any case, Sam and I keep in touch through Missouri.  Every time one of us is in Tortuga, the first thing we do is stop in and see her.”
Dean coughs and rubs his fist on his chest in an apology before he repeats the question more clearly.
“And the douen?”
“What was that back there?” Castiel demands.
,” Dean says, wincing.
“Is three men enough to take care of this creature?” asks Missouri.
The door to the captain’s cabin flings open and he marches out, sword already unsheathed.  Castiel doesn’t stop ringing the bell.  There’s barely any wind, and he knows whatever danger is circling the ship, they will not be able to outrun it.
Frank huffs, clearly wanting to ask Castiel more questions instead, but stands to retrieve a knife from the counter behind him.
"Nope," agrees Eileen.  "That was a werewolf."
Finally, Sam speaks.  He rubs his palms on his jeans nervously, not knowing how to talk about
They oblige, and Robin scrutinizes the badges for a minute before handing them back.
—” He gestures to the empty space between the two of them.  “—wasn’t a thing.  And now, I… I don’t know.”
Somewhere in his twisting stomach, Castiel feels a tugging, pulling him back to the sea.  But not to Havana.  No, he wants to go north, back along the route he’d taken with the
And Dean says yes.  And it’s the easiest thing in the world.
Sam wordlessly gestures to the barn.  He can’t speak.
“It seems like you’re picking and choosing who to save.”
He’s not sure if that scares or excites him.
A pair of headlights appears from around the bend, the familiar rumbling of the engine drawing closer as Cas’s heart begins to beat more quickly.  He’d know this car anywhere.
Sam blinks and stands up in surprise; Dean follows suit.
Tallie vomits onto the path and then fumbles her phone out of its armband, nearly dropping it into the ocean as she tries to call 9-1-1.
Sam leans back in his chair, not even trying to hide his grin anymore.  “Oh, is that what kids are calling it these days?”
Bobby clears his throat, stepping in before the captain can speak further.  “John, I think it’d be best to get the kids home.  It’s been a long day.”
It’s halfway filled out already, with Dean’s information.  Some of it is in Dean’s handwriting, other parts are in Cas’s.  Dean’s even used his real name and his real social security number.  It’s for a construction company, some small operation out of Beloit.  On the desktop is a second application for a mechanic shop in Cawker City.
Castiel swallows, and pulls Dean behind him by the scruff of his waistcoat.  Instead, Castiel takes his own knife and lunges for the douen before he has a moment to second-guess himself.
He doesn’t have to ask for clarification to know what Cas means.  “Don’t you have to finish?” Dean asks stupidly, gesturing to the sink.
Cas watches the trees streak by in a blur.  “Fine.”
The fight is a close call – very close.  By the end of it, Eileen has a big cut on her cheek and bleeding scratches down her arm, while Cas is nursing a laceration on his shoulder.  Both of them are out of breath and absolutely filthy, covered in dirt, gravel, and werewolf body fluids.
They meet in the middle, Marie Helene sinking to her knees on the ground with Jean-Luc clutched in her arms, rocking him and weeping prayers and thanks.  Behind them, Missouri and Patience step out from the house.
, he wants to say.  He has to be at work first thing in the morning.
” Donna says on the other end.
“Maryann,” says Robin, beckoning her to the desk as she unbuttons her jacket.  “These men are here from the FBI.”
By the time Dean is present enough for Sam to explain that
The sound that Cas makes when he bottoms out is almost too much for Dean, and he has to clamp his teeth on the inside of his cheek to keep from coming on the spot.  For a long moment, Cas stays like that, buried in Dean as deep as he’ll go and shaking with the effort of holding still, as though he thinks he’ll break some kind of spell if he moves.
– but whatever the unspoken ending, Dean knows the answer is
“It wasn’t a guaranteed thing, Sammy.  I got almost no documented work history, and at my age there’s not going to be a whole lot of jobs available.”
.  Dean rolls his eyes.  Cas would have just agreed with him.
Dean’s voice echoes in the back of Cas’s head.
By their end of their fight, Lucifer, Michael, and some poor Reaper named Betty have all been killed quickly enough to give Dean whiplash.  Jack brutally strips Chuck of his power and leaves him begging, screaming by the side of some remote lake.  He’s nothing more than one of his least favorite apes, bound to the dirt under his feet, and that suits them just fine.
“Where… where’s the island?” Castiel asks.
Sam snorts, grabbing his bag from the car.  “Hey, buddy, how about we fire up the sprinkler in the back yard?” he calls.
Left and right, respectively, if one is looking toward the bow.
Inside Maryann’s office, it’s cramped and disorganized and
for this chapter.
He drinks his coffee in slow, consciously measured gulps.  If he’s being obviously awkward, Cas doesn’t acknowledge it.  Dean almost wishes he would, because then at least they’d be talking about it without Dean having to be the one to start the conversation with no idea what to say.  He pours himself a second cup from the pot.
When Cas explains that they have to stick a penny in the alpha’s mouth before beheading it, both Claire and Donna think he’s joking.
that blasts through the room.  Unearthly howls of pain pour out of the wound as the Empty screams from the deepest recess of the cosmos.  The bunker shakes, dust falling from the ceiling.
“I suppose,” Castiel replies, though the odor clogging his nose and mouth seems to hold his appetite at bay.
“Then you should have let him ask!” the captain bellows.  “Let him ask until he’s blue in the face for all I care!”
“Oh, are you Cas?” she asks.
“Now.”  Dean nods, their noses bumping.  No more waiting.  No more saying
He presses two fingers to Cas’s forehead, and the fabric of this world rolls away.
for this chapter, if you want it.
“All right, thanks,” Sam says, tucking the mugshot back into the police file along with the Post-It.  He stands, hunched in order to avoid hitting his head on the rafters, and pulls a card from his coat pocket to give to Maryann.  “If you think of anything — anything at all — let us know.”
, wiping the blood onto the leg of his breeches.
Dean shakes his head, his eyes darting in circles around the ship.
Maryann gazes at the mugshot fondly for a moment.  “Of course I do.  Fred’s a gem.  Or was, anyway.  Always a pleasant guy to have around — when he was sober.”  She shakes her head and returns the photo to Sam.  “But, you know, substance abuse does terrible things to a person.  He didn’t deserve what happened.”
“It’s working, then?” is all he says.
“So what’s his story?” prompts Eileen.
Reassured, at least somewhat, Castiel finds the strength to straighten and remove his hand from the railing.  His breathing slows, though his fist still shakes.  His wounded shoulder is stinging.  “Um.  Two, I think.”
, Dean hasn’t moved a muscle.  He stands like a sentry, watching vehicles trickle past on the road outside the motel.
Sam shakes his head, picking up Eileen’s car keys from the dresser.  “Nah, I’m not really feeling it.  I’ll get the car warmed up.”
Castiel has had this feeling only once before in his life, watching a master bladesmith in Port Royal years ago hammering delicacy into an ornate sword.  He’s shocked with the privilege of watching someone performing the task they were clearly meant for, designed for by God.  Sitting here under the stars, watching Dean sing with the beat thrumming through the boards of the deck, Castiel is blessed.
He smiles and waves back.
.  The handwriting is still a bit faded, but the tape is whole and functioning.
He does, and together they carry Dean’s body out of the barn, back to the Impala.  Sam is already on his feet, and the three of them struggle to get him into the back seat.  Cas gets into the car and pulls from inside, and ends up sitting behind the driver’s seat with Dean’s head and shoulders in his arms.  Cas is pinned under Dean’s weight, but he doesn’t want to move and refuses Sam’s suggestion to sit in the front seat.
anchored in a safe harbor that she’d been destroyed.
Dean chuckles and nudges Cas with his elbow.  “That tape was the only thing Cas insisted on adding to this place,” he says, then amends his statement.  “Well, that and the apiary.  What
“Is this the Axis Mundi?”
, huh?” he says, sinking onto the cushioned arm of the chair to the right of the couch.  Cas’s head lifts, and Sam tries his best not to react outwardly to the scene in front of him.
Dean cuts him off swiftly.  “I’m
Jack is quiet, his brow knitted in worry.  When he speaks again, his voice cracks.  He sounds like a little boy.  He sounds like their son.  “It hurts to see you like this.”
Dean taught him well, it occurs to Cas, and he suddenly feels like crying again.
He gives her a genuine smile, feeling secure in the fact that she loves and cares for him.  “I know.  Thank you, Jody.  I’ll take you up on it someday, I promise.”  But today is not that day, and Cas bids Jody goodbye with a hug before beckoning Miracle back to the car.
, where Kaia, Claire, Alex, and Patience are forced to sprawl on cushions on the floor.  And when Cas sits on the couch with his arm around Dean’s shoulders, relaxed and comfortable and stealing handfuls of popcorn from the bowl in Dean’s lap, Claire gives him a knowing smile that nobody else sees.
Castiel swallows, feeling stripped of his skin, but can’t quite look away.
“Find anything you like?” he asks.
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas says with just a hint of a growl, trailing kisses across Dean’s shoulders, the nape of his neck.  “You have no idea.”
“I — I don’t know, I mean…” Dean stammers, struggling to find the words.  “Would you even want to do this, if you weren’t human?”
His brain still hazy with static, Dean can’t quite believe that they’ve made it here, to this moment.  He wraps an arm around Cas’s shoulders, enjoying the weight of Cas on top of him and intentionally delaying the inevitable separation.
Once Chuck is gone, the world is brighter and bigger around them.  The bunker is full of life – movie nights and loud dinners and card games.  Eileen is around almost constantly, practically living at the bunker most days.  While she’s spending her time with Sam, it gives Dean and Cas plenty of room to be on their own.  The four of them go on a few hunts here and there, but for the most part they sit and enjoy their freedom.
Dean glances down at the blade for an instant, then back up to Castiel.  He frowns.  “Far as I’m concerned, that’s yours, Cas.”
,” he says, his voice remaining breathy and hushed.
Sam clears his throat.  “I’m sure you saw the news about the body found at Spring Point.”
“After I got here, I started building this place, and Cas turned up the same day I finished,” Dean says, the memories of other good days skipping across his features.
Dean glares at him, but finally his shoulders fall and he throws up his hands.  “Cas and I had a talk,” he confesses, looking off toward some vendors’ booths over Sam’s shoulder.
Dean clears his throat, fingertips tingling, and manages a hoarse, “Um.  Yeah, I’ll get something started.”
Somewhere in the recesses of Dean’s mind, he instinctively wants to protest, but instead Cas adds a second finger and Dean sees white as Cas works him open.
By now, the sun is up outside the bunker.  Cas’s circadian rhythm is whining that he should be beginning his day, getting coffee, getting breakfast.  But his eyelids are heavy and he didn’t sleep a wink during the drive back from Texas, and he needs to get used to doing what his body tells him to do.  That’s the human way, isn’t it?  To need things?
When they reach Cas’s room, Dean feels again like he’s not bracing for a fast-approaching impact.  But now, he knows he doesn’t want to.  He’s not going to waste any more time.
As he drives the Valiant down the winding driveway toward the road, Sam glances in the rearview mirror for just long enough to see Dean and Cas wave before they go back inside the house.  The engine rumbles underneath him as he makes it back to the road, bouncing slightly onto the pavement.
He’s sucked rapidly into the pages, finding himself transported almost immediately to London in the After Ford era.  He’s several pages in and completely engrossed, the bunker faded from his peripheral vision, and so doesn’t notice Dean coming in until he plops down on the couch beside him.
Maryann pauses, glancing between them, then breaks into a blindingly white smile.  “Well, then, we’d better step into my office,” she says, all too cheerful, and leads Sam and Dean over to the nearest door.  “Come on, gentlemen, I’ve got the space heater on.”
The curve of a gigantic fin, sweeping through the water below.
It’s not the first time they’ve kissed like this, with their surroundings fading to grey.  But something’s shifted, and they both know it.
“Anyways,” Dean continues, “I just wanted to see if you guys are hungry.”
, and Castiel can feel the skin on his forehead and the back of his neck cooking.  Sweat is already pouring down to the small of his back, and his shirt is clinging.
“And that aren’t covered in blood,” Cas adds, scrubbing scrambled egg residue out of a frying pan.
Without stopping to think, Castiel throws his sword through the air, hilt first.  It spins and lodges itself like a hatchet in the mermaid’s back, at the base of the dorsal fin.  The mermaid flips and thrashes with a screaming howl.  Garth seizes the hilt, yanks the cutlass out of the mermaid’s spine and drives it cleanly through the abdomen.
He’s not a hundred percent certain why exactly he’s so hell-bent on hiding this from Sam and Eileen.  For fuck’s sake, they already
Alastair’s voice is there suddenly, cutting through the screams, filling him to the point of bursting.  Pressing into every nook and cranny of Dean’s soul.  Shocking through him, sharp as anything.
It’s that statement that makes the tears finally spill, and Cas is
for this chapter.
He opens his mouth to answer, but quickly realizes he’s got no idea what to say or how to explain the events of the day.  Dean saves him, however, and says, “I’m sure she’ll tell you all about it.”
Sam frowns, his gut twisting abruptly.  Cas’s eyes are reddened slightly, and past his shoulder the Impala sits crookedly at the end of the driveway behind Eileen’s sedan.
” Jean-Luc asks.  “
Cas lays his free hand across the small of Dean’s back, abruptly cool against the searing heat of Dean’s skin.  And just like that, his fingers are gone and Dean groans, left empty and yearning.
Cas rakes his fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck, looking at the floor.  “I shouldn’t have—” he starts, but Dean cuts him off again.
In the kitchen, Dean finds Cas doing the dishes, and damn, if it isn’t one of the weirdest things he’s ever seen.  Cas is still not in his own clothes, instead wearing one of Sam’s blue flannel shirts with a hole in the elbow.  It’s too big for him and hangs off his frame like it’s melting around him.  He’s had to roll up the sleeves to keep them from getting wet in the sink.  A former angel doing the dishes.  Dean’s pretty sure there’s a punchline in there somewhere.
“Hiya, Frank,” he says brightly.
Sam gives him a sympathetic smile and jerks his head in the direction of the bunker door.  “How about you come inside, and we can get started on some breakfast?”
Jack says it evenly and without hesitation, and it feels like a punch to the throat.  Cas shakes his head and glowers out the window.
Going to the window, she pushes the curtains aside to let more light in.  Tendrils of ice creep along the corners of the pane, feathering in ornate patterns across the glass.  Their room is on the first floor and looking straight out into the parking lot, where the pavement glitters and the cars — including the Valiant — are all encased in a layer of frost.
Last Monday was cooking, but he’d burnt the shit out of what was supposed to be lasagna and Dean had sighed and said
He gasps what he’s sure will be his final breath and squeezes his eyes shut
Cas had, without any demands, given him the opportunity to maintain the lie, and Dean chose to be open, and he’d chosen on his own.
You haven’t seen them?”
Dean nods, standing up straight again.  “Sounds like a plan.”
“I think so,” says Sam, peering over the edge of the desk at the secretary’s nametag, “Robin.  Agents Frantz and Byrne.  We’re hoping to speak to whoever’s in charge.”
Cas waits for a moment to see if Dean will add anything else, then gently states, “We should talk, Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“A douen?” echoes Castiel.
“I don’t know that I do,” Dean is quick to say.  He still needs an out.  “But I don’t know that I don’t, either.”
Tallie stands on the rocks and breathes as deeply as she can manage in the freezing wind, her lungs fighting to keep the cold air out.  She watches the fishing trawlers and lobster boats motor through the harbor, seamlessly navigating the shipping channels around Spring Point and between the islands out to the open ocean.  This view is the only thing that makes jogging in November worth it.
“I’m not expecting anything from you, Dean,” Cas interjects.
“You really miss Earth that much after only two days?” Dean asks as he unlocks the car and gets in.
By the time Garth gives Castiel his blade back and reclaims his own, there’s only one more mermaid still alive on the deck.  If any others managed to survive, they’ve already slithered back into the water in retreat.
The door bursts open and Dean storms out, making Castiel leap backwards like he’s been branded by hot iron.  Dean spots him immediately, the light from inside the cabin highlighting the hard lines of his face for just a moment before the door swings closed and they plunge back into darkness.
Cas forces himself to give a smile, though he knows it’s a weak one.  “It’s alright.  As you said.  Statistically.”
Dean eats another piece of orange.  “Do I look like I’m lying?”
“I know.”  Cas watches as Sam tumbles into the grass and Dean, already impossibly tall for his age, jumps on him.  “I just wanted a memory to bring with me.”
“You mean there’s nothing you
“Maybe the guy who killed him had a pet snake,” Dean dismisses.
Sam waits, and without looking at him Dean has no idea if Sam feels guilty for pressing.  After a few minutes, Sam asks again, “What happened?”  The question is gentler this time.  It hurts more.
.  The tape snaps.
“I am not part of your crew, and we are not on your ship,” Castiel replies evenly, surprising himself as he draws on some previously undiscovered well of courage.  “I can speak to you how I please.”
The driver’s door creaks as Jack closes it, circling around the Impala’s front with a comforting pat to her hood.  “It’s time for me to go,” he says.
“Maybe something died nearby,” Castiel suggests, though he doubts there are any animals on the island.
Dean swallows, his lungs hitching on his next inhale.  Leave it to Cas to strike at the heart of the issue.  Fucking bull’s eye.
to be used by Cas, because Cas isn’t going to use him like a weapon, to hurt or to break, or as a means to an end.  Cas will use him like a potter uses a wheel, taking something raw and ugly and unrefined and molding it into something better.  Dean shakes the thought from his head — he’s getting dangerously close to a
Once they’ve disposed of the bodies in the car compactor, they head back to the Valiant to get cleaned up.  Eileen, much more of a plan-ahead personality than Dean or Sam, has not just a stash of weapons in the trunk, but also plenty of water and wipes alongside the first aid kit.  Cas is wrapping a bandage around Eileen’s scratched-up forearm when his phone rings in his back pocket.
Cas clenches his jaw, but follows suit.  The gravel bites into his bare feet, and he shivers in the breeze, suddenly self-conscious of what he’s wearing.  He hopes there’ll be no other cars driving by.
Dean abruptly realizes he’s staring, and flushes.  “Right.  Sorry.”  He gives it to Cas, then opens his own.  “You look different.”
“I’m on my way to Denver,” she says, tugging on a strand of hair by her ear.  “Some reports of bodies turning up with their blood drained.  Think it might be vampires.”
“Four.”
Dean’s heart is galloping in his chest again, a shaky breath working its way out of his lungs.  He can feel every cell in his body, every atom, thrumming with electricity.  But Sam was home and only a few rooms away now, and they are in the
There is another behind Castiel, coming up over the bulward like some kind of leopard scaling a tree.  He swings round, sword sweeping, and manages to clip the mermaid on the shoulder.  The wound is small and far from lethal, but it sizzles audibly upon contact.  The mermaid screeches, its maw opening as wide as it will go, gills flaring.
He can almost hear Dean shouting at him from the passenger seat.
“Well, it has been a while since you had to do that.”
Sam refocuses his gaze on the mess in front of him.  “You don’t have to talk about it,” he amends.
Shoulder to shoulder, Dean and Castiel fight for their lives.
There is an island where there shouldn’t be.
Claire rushes to Sam and throws her arms around his torso, crying into his shirt.  “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, it was all my fault—”  She’s babbling and shows no signs of stopping, so Sam grips her shoulders and pushes her back to look her in the eyes.
” Dean inquires.
“Hi, Sam,” he answers, holding the phone between his ear and his non-injured shoulder as he finishes tying the bandage.
“I guess we split up?” she suggests.  “Talk to as many as we can?”
“That’s something,” Sam comments, and requests that Paradis pull up the footage of the truck that usually does the trash collection so that he can write down the license plate number.
At last, Castiel sprints after Dean as he runs into a tavern and through, ignoring the startled shouts of the thirsty patrons, and bursts through the rear.  Dean finally slows to a stop in the alleyway, panting and chuckling as he leans back against a wall.
Without breaking the kiss, Cas reaches up and tangles his fingers with Dean’s, pinning his wrist to the bed for a moment before working the robe off his shoulders, arms out of the sleeves.  Dean nips at Cas’s jaw, relishing in the graze of stubble and the flush beneath Cas’s skin.
Throughout Dean’s life, silence only ever brought something nasty lurking in the shadows, or came on the heels of a bloodbath.  He filled the spaces in between hunts with loud music and classic movies and chatter, jokes — forced or genuine, it didn’t matter — and anything else to occupy his mind when he couldn’t bear to be alone with himself.  Here and now, this quiet, this perfect silence is nothing but safety, calm and comfort, and Dean isn’t ready to give it up quite yet.
A soft smile crosses Cas’s face, and his hand dips low, brushing the hair between Dean’s legs.  “I’m sure the experience would be different in many ways,” he says, wrapping his fingers around the shaft of Dean’s erection.  Dean sucks in a breath, his head falling back at the flash of pleasure that rockets through him when Cas moves his grip up to the head and down again.  “But I can’t imagine not wanting to do this.”
“And it wasn’t a kraken,” Dean continues.  “That was an aspidochelone.”
Dean stops humming, meeting Castiel’s eye for only a moment.
Cas blinks in confusion, instantly picking up on the tension, and frowns over his coffee mug as Sam disappears down the corridor.  The moment he’s out of sight, Cas turns his attention to Dean.  “What’s the matter?”
Eileen’s out for the night, spending it at her apartment to pack up some more of her things to bring back to the bunker in the morning, and Sam pores over the texts and lore and piles of creaking books as he painstakingly uploads them to his database.  He’s pretty sure he’s giving himself asthma from the sheer volume of dust he’s inhaling, and at this point his eyes are swimming, so he takes a break and leaves the library for the first time all day.
The mermaid charges forward, coming at Castiel with wild precision.  He’s far from an experienced swordsman, and it’s pure reflex that makes him swing the cutlass up just as the mermaid’s teeth are half an arm’s length away.  There’s an unearthly howl and the thing recoils, writhing on the deck before he realizes that he actually managed to hit it.  A wound bubbles in its fleshy abdomen like he struck it with acid.
They leave the den smoking, the smell of burning meat heavy in the air.
“You should eat,” Dean urges gently.
Sam grins over his shoulder, remaining still so as not to disturb Eileen.  “What, you don’t like
Castiel stares down at the douen’s corpse, barely able to believe that he’s just killed it.  He pulls his knife from its chest with a disgusting
Sam huffs a soft chuckle and steps into the room.  “
Dean heaves himself to his feet again, swaying under the weight of Jean-Luc.  “Cas, you gotta take her,” he says, holding up Feliciana’s hand.  “I need both my arms.”
Inside Marie Helene’s house, there’s a girl no older than nine sweeping the kitchen floor, a toddler playing in the dust and a baby strapped to the older girl’s back.  “
Castiel feels the pit of his stomach go ice cold.
Castiel’s stomach churns.  He’d thought the aspidochelone and the mermaids were terrifying enough; somehow, a creature that passes through crowded towns and steals children in broad daylight is so much worse.
Castiel huffs a breath and sits up, snatching his boots from Dean’s grip.  “Did I sleep late?” he asks, noticing for the first time that the rest of the hammocks are already empty.  His boots clunk on the floor as he shoves his feet into them.
Before Cas has the opportunity to say goodbye and head back to the Impala, Sam invites him to stay for breakfast.  “I’ll make pancakes,” he promises, “and Dean would love it if you drove him to school later.”
But Dean’s family has just been made significantly smaller, and it will be a hard conversation, and Sam is so
Castiel doesn’t quite know what to say to that, but maybe Dean isn’t looking for anything in return.
Dean is quiet for a moment, and Castiel thinks he hears him clear his throat.  “Not so good,” he answers.  “We killed the thing, but we… we were too late.  By the time we got to the den, there was nothing but bones.”
By the way, Wessie was actually a real thing.  She was seen twice in 2016, once eating a beaver.  A shed skin was in fact found in the woods in Westbrook (roughly 4 miles outside of Portland) and snake experts confirmed that it was a 12-foot long green anaconda only native to the Amazon.  Wessie has never been found, but I like to believe she’s still out there, happily devouring beavers along the Presumpscot River and occasionally scaring the shit out of hikers.
“You okay?” Dean asks, praying to anything other than God that this doesn’t kill Jack.
“So they must be using the rest of the body,” Sam reasons, though confusion clouds his features even in the dark.  “I can’t think of why, though.”
While Paradis speaks, Cas feels his stomach growing tighter and tighter with every word, bile rising in his throat.  Human bodily reactions are still somewhat unfamiliar to him but he doesn’t have to stop and ponder why he’s feeling this way.  He’s angry.  Angry and disgusted.
Eventually, though, the feeling of his skin still sticking to Cas’s creeps in, and his mouth is clammy with morning breath.  Dean draws a deep, slow inhale and turns his head to kiss Cas on the cheek before gently untangling himself from Cas’s embrace.
Sam’s smile only grows into an ear-to-ear grin that can only be described as
Losing his grace this time around was nothing like what Metatron did years ago.  Rather than slitting Cas’s throat and drawing it out like a thread from a seam, the Empty had torn Cas’s grace out of him in a single horrible instant.  It was ripped from every atom in his body and left Cas barely able to breathe, let alone function.  The weeks following his return mostly consisted of sleeping, vomiting, fighting off fevers, and eating like a linebacker as he slowly gained back his strength.
Dean bullies him down the hall to his own room, bullies him into changing into a clean shirt to sleep in, bullies him into bed.  Cas has been human for a few months now but he still hasn’t quite made his bedroom his own, so they spend most of their nights in Dean’s room where it’s more welcoming, more lived-in.  In Dean’s bed, it’s warmer than it would be in Cas’s.  Certainly warmer than sleeping alone.
— they’d walked in on Cas and Dean kissing in the kitchen weeks ago.  But Dean’s just stuck on this track, this
As soon as they’re back outside in the sun, away from prying non-hunter ears and heading back to the car, Cas speaks up.  “I think I know what it is.”
Eileen, as it turns out, is a bit of a reckless driver, and they reach West Virginia in record time.  Cas is not familiar with the sensation of being carsick, and by the time they arrive he’s just grateful that they never got pulled over for speeding.  He asks her once outside of St. Louis to
Something darkens in Dean’s eyes, and Cas feels the tips of Dean’s fingers go cold in his palm.  For a moment, Cas expects him to rip his hand out of Cas’s grip, to snap something like
Before Castiel can think of something to say — some expression of sympathy, or maybe encouragement — Frank crunches back through the vegetation and fixes them both with an irritated scowl.
Sighing, Dean nods, knowing there’s no point in ignoring it.  “Yeah.  Yeah, we should.”
The back of Dean’s head is buzzing so badly that it takes him a minute to realize that his cell phone is vibrating in his pocket.  He fumbles to pull it out with numb fingers and sees Sam’s name on the screen.
So he grips Dean by the arm and forces him to a stop.
“Relax, boy,” Mr. Singer says.  “We ain’t gonna kill ya.”
Castiel is newly human, and entirely unused to the sensation of being bored.  In the occasional hours when he has nothing to do, he’s taken to exploring, trying on new hobbies and activities to see if they’ll fit.
Cas and Eileen stand at the fence, staring after the stranger as they catch their breath, until a few seconds later when Sam and Dean reach them.
“Thinking is not your strong suit, boy,” snarls the captain’s voice.  It’s vicious enough to make even Castiel flinch where he stands in the dark.  “There is a reason we do not go blabbing about these things to every man in every port!”
Dean would
, we’ll fill you in at the restaurant.”
This time, Castiel remembers himself enough to join in, singing along with the rest of the crew for the refrain.  Somehow, as strange as this is, he thinks he understands it.  The rhythm, the song… this keeps the darkness at bay, keeps the nightmares in the water where they belong.  It celebrates the fact that they’re still alive.
“She’s got the smell of a monster about her.”
“I’m sorry, Cas.  I mean, cassettes were outdated thirty years before Dean even made this for you.  I—”  Sam pauses, swallows.  “I don’t think we can replicate it.”
Cas dumps a comically large armful of clothing into the cart in response.
“Please,” Cas begs, stepping forward to put himself between the Empty and Jack.  “I’ll tell them to leave me here.  I’ll hold up my end of the deal, I swear.”
“Eileen’s not cooking?” Cas asks, because for the first few weeks after Dean’s death Eileen had taken over the kitchen while Sam and Cas were both in no shape to be feeding themselves.
, Dean’s voice ghosts in the back of his head.  It’s not real, but Cas doesn’t care.
“I don’t understand,” says Castiel.  He was pulled down, lost to the ocean.  He remembers that.  The screams of his crewmates echo in his ears, Ishim’s vanishing face lurking behind his eyelids.
of giving up hunting, of moving out of the bunker, of creating a life in a place where if his child was afraid of the dark, he could plug in a night light instead of handing his child a gun.
“Dean?” Cas says, as gently as he can through his own terror.  He’s seen Dean startled awake for every possible reason; jerked out of a deep sleep by Jack shaking his shoulder, by Cas hovering hesitantly over him, by the noise of traffic pulling him out of a nap in the Impala’s front seat.  He’s seen Dean wake from nightmares countless times.
“Heard something,” Sam signs to Eileen, and she nearly misses it in the dark.
Castiel hits the ground with a shout as he’s yanked off his feet.  Feliciana vanishes, instantly swallowed up by the dark.  Her screams fill the air.
After a much-too-long silence, Jack tugs his hands through his hair, tears leaving tracks down his face.  “I’m sorry,” he says, his voice breaking.  “The Empty got him before I could—”  He chokes, unable to finish the sentence.
Dean gives him a strange look.  “What are you doing?”
Jody puts her burger down on the paper plate, then leans on her elbows with her hands clasped on the wooden tabletop.  “How are you doing, Cas?”
“Cas,” Dean says.  “C’mere.”
.  Had it been Dean pulled into the Empty, he knows Cas would tear through whole dimensions to get Dean back.  Billie is gone, which means that Death isn’t coming after them.  And God is already after them, so what’s one more cosmic battle added to the pile?
— Dean should have known that he would.  He braces his hands on the counter and lets out a long breath, chastising himself for being so worked up over nothing.  It
“Alrighty, then,” says Donna eagerly.  She’s wearing a savage grin as she flips her machete threateningly.  “One for each of us.  Nice and easy.”
There’s five more werewolves, and they live up to their pack hunter nature, coming at Cas and Eileen from all sides.  Cas manages to shoot a female through the stomach just before she can sink her teeth into his neck.  Eileen swings her bowie knife into the chest of a hulking male, and suddenly the pack has gone from six to three.
He can’t quite believe that he ever wanted Cas to back out of his personal space.  He can’t believe that even just a few
identical to Dean's
Dean swallows, shifting Jean-Luc onto his hip, his mouth in a firm line.  “There wasn’t time to get help.  And it wasn’t just me.”  He glances pointedly at Frank and Castiel.
Cas takes him into his mouth one more time, swallows around him, making Dean groan and his fingers flex at his sides, before pulling off with an obscene sound.
warm.  Case files sit in stacks on whatever surface is available, binders crammed into shelves too small, and the computer is practically an antique.  Maryann wedges herself behind the desk, draping her coat over the back of her seat, and fluffs her hair once before offering the only other available chair to Sam.
The statement comes out of nowhere, but Cas still is not surprised.  He takes a sip of coffee from the to-go cup in his hand.
Cas wipes his mouth with a napkin.  He’s nearly finished with his food already, since Jody’s been doing almost all the talking.  “And Claire?  She’s happy in Omaha?”
“It’s been pure luck,” comes the gruff answer from behind him.
“Is Fred in trouble?” she asks, and Sam blinks in surprise.
Castiel runs a palm over his face, still groggy.  He feels like he’s been asleep for a hundred years, and could sleep for a hundred more.  “Wha?” is the only sound he can articulate.
,” Dean chokes out, and Cas loops an arm around Dean’s back, slipping underneath the bathrobe, and yanks him down into a messy sliding kiss of tongue and teeth.
The first thing Castiel sees when he wakes is a pair of glowing yellow eyes, and he jumps when he realizes that Jack is standing in front of him.  “I wasn’t aware I could dream in the Empty,” Cas says to himself, more shocked that he’s experiencing some semblance of consciousness rather than at the sight of Jack being here with him.
As Dean manages to get through the tunnel after him, Castiel’s eyes have adjusted to the dark enough for him to see that the interior structure of the den spirals upward, criss-crossed with handholds and pocketed with plenty of nooks and crannies for a creature to hide in.
Dean’s head and shoulders appear as he scrapes forward on his belly.  He’s broader than Castiel and it’s even harder for him to fit through the tunnel, so Castiel grabs him by the wrists and attempts to drag him out.
“You did good,” Dean says as he approaches Castiel, wiping his hands on his breeches.  His sword hangs at his side.  It’s still bloody and dripping.
Something in Garth’s tone makes Castiel think he might be speaking from personal experience.
with laughter.
“Kid won’t still be at the market,” Dean says, peering curiously at what’s left of the garden.  “Odd time of year for a harvest, isn’t it?”
” a woman screams, quickly followed by a frantic pounding on the front door.  “
The officer nods, taking the lie at face value.  “I’m Jake Paradis,” he says.  “Come on, this way.”
Castiel gasps, jerking backwards and nearly knocking Dean over.  “
five, eight, ten.  The attack is coordinated, calculated, raptorial.
“I don’t know.  Could be.  Sam’s not in the seminary any more.”  Dean shakes his head, sighs.  “He enlisted in the Army.  Last time Missouri saw him was two months ago; he could’ve been stationed anywhere by now.”
“Cas, Frank,” he says, jerking his head away from what’s left of the den.  “We should go.”
Dean groans.  His head drops in embarrassment.  “Yeah, fuck, I did.  I — I gotta—”
