Tony grunted in agreement, still peeved at Steve’s insistence that he shouldn’t fight. How could the Alpha have thought that Tony would stay here for even one second while he let others fight?
“I’ll get the midwife and Bruce,” Steve told him. They’d brought a midwife and their most trusted doctor along, just in case something went wrong or the war lasted until the full nine months of Tony’s pregnancy. Of course, no one was foreseeing the child being born a whole month early.
Steve made a speech, thoughtful and heartfelt, but succinct and to the point. The Lord had a gift with words, and all the people seemed to be in awe of him. Tony felt drawn in as well. He was so glad to have found this man. For once, a decision that Howard had made for him had turned out in his favor.
Tony, despite Natasha’s comforting words, shook like a leaf. “I can’t help it. I’m worried that he won’t want me suddenly. Or that the council will oppose and ruin it,” he spoke truthfully. Tony could tell that Obadiah and many of the traditional Alphas of their tribe disapproved with Steve’s politics. Tony marrying a liberal Alpha hardly counted as him marrying an Alpha at all, in some of their minds.
He was jittery with nervousness. This had to be a good sign, right? Especially since both men were smiling back at him. “Hey…I take it things went well?” Tony asked as he took a few more steps toward them. Steve nodded, blushing a little as he looked at them.
“Son?” He asked his husband, a little upturn of his mouth indicating the beginnings of a smile. Steve smiled back at him, blue eyes glittering in the moonlight that filtered in through the windows.
Getting up for the day was a slow affair. They got distracted and had another wonderful round of sex, which ended with Tony snoozing in Steve’s lap as they waited for the knot to go down. Eventually, though, they managed to crawl out of bed, wash, and dress. Clean clothes had been laid out for them the night before, and Tony slipped on a soft salmon-colored fabric, wrapping it around one shoulder. Steve donned soft leathers, trimmed with a white fur. Tony wondered what his clothes would look like, once he got to the Northern lands.
“Don’t look so shocked. He has an Omega at the head of his military, Pepper! He’s my best bet. Anyone else my father finds will have me practically in chains.” He knew this to be true. Finding an Alpha like Steve was like a needle in a haystack. The Alpha wanted him too, so Tony needed to jump on this now. “I don’t care if I have to have his children. If he lets me use my mind, it’ll be a victory for me.”
“I…this talk was supposed to be about you,” Tony tried to deflect, glancing away to the city buildings below them. Steve huffed and tugged Tony closer, taking the genius into his arms almost protectively it seemed. He put one hand on Tony’s waist, the other coming up to cup Tony’s face, his thumb trailing gently over the apple of his cheek.
The lab was actually a very welcome place after tonight. Bucky often spent a lot of time down here with Tony, fascinated with the technology, and fascinated with the man that had created all of it.
Steve turned toward him, a quick movement. “We? Tony, there is no way you’re joining us in battle!” Steve protested, looking immediately worried. Tony frowned at him and shifted in his seat.
“No. Steve Rogers is the bravest man you know. I…I’m not Captain America. I have…red on my ledger,” Bucky sighed. He’d probably picked that phrase up from Natasha. Tony went a little still at the mention of Steve. Bucky must know. He was a trained spy, he wasn’t an idiot. He must have noticed how Tony had looked at Steve in those first couple of months before he started to fall for Bucky more.
His father actually looked mildly approving for once, something that Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to. It would, no doubt, not last long. “Ah, Tony. Lord Rogers and I were just discussing your impending marriage,” Howard said, as he crossed his arms over his chest. “He’s told me you agreed to it?” He looked hopeful for a confirmation.
He stood on the step below Steve, like an Omega should during this ceremony. Steve reached out with careful hands, taking Tony’s own in them. He tugged slightly, making Tony step up onto the same step as him. Tony could hardly believe the gesture. His eyes were wide with disbelief and he felt love course through him right then and there.
Please be aware that there is smut in this chapter. If you're not old enough to read sexual themes, do not. Enjoy!
“He killed them. You want me to let him stay here? Recover using money from the company my dad built? How could you ask that of me?” Tony turned his angry, red-rimmed eyes to Steve. He wouldn’t cry, couldn’t cry in front of Steve, so he clamped down hard on the sorrow, and focused on the rage.
The Vision waited a moment for the crowd’s quiet talk to settle, before moving on. If he knew that Tony was on the same step as Steve, he didn’t mention it. Sacred blessings and prayers to the gods were made, all of them bowing their heads before the ceremony started.
“Thought I might find you here.” A voice spoke up from behind him. Steve almost thought it was part of his reverie, like it was Bucky from before the war, talking to him as he got back from a job at the docks.
When they rounded through the crowd and got closer to the dais, Tony finally caught sight of Steve. He was waiting there, along with their High Priest. The Vision, they called him. Ironically so, since he was blind, but he is said to be able to commune with the gods in exchange.
“Don’t worry, he’ll come around,” Bucky said. “He just has a hard time with, well, anything vaguely romantic.” Bucky hoped it was only that. Steve didn’t have homophobic tendencies from their time, did he? No, Natasha was openly bisexual, didn’t care to hide it. Steve had never minded that.
The same was asked of Steve next, and the whole time, through the whole ceremony, Steve never let go of Tony’s hands. Steve’s thumbs brushed softly over the tops of Tony’s hands as he answered the priest.
A week into the training period, Steve found him in his workshop as he was fully suited. The Alpha’s eyes widened as he saw the invention and he walked in with some trepidation. “What in the god's names is that?” Steve asked with a soft voice, in awe of Tony’s work.
There was a celebration when they arrived back at camp, and Tony allowed it easily. They could afford to have a couple days of merriment and rest before making the travel back up to the north. Tony supposed these southern lands were theirs too now.
Steve shrugged. “I can’t tell you what it looks like now, obviously.” One hundred years, he reminded himself mentally. “But…you have a sharp mind, and you’re clearly one of the top thinkers on your own planet. I’m sure you’d thrive,” he answered with a soft look in his eyes.
“What? You’re my mate, I’m in heat. There isn’t any question to it,” Tony said with a frown. Steve’s helping hands stilled and shook for a moment. His blue eyes got intensely serious.
“It doesn’t change our plans, though,” Brock told him, keeping his voice low so the real supporters of Stark didn’t hear. “We track their tactics, memorize the guard shifts. Then we strike. The war will be over before anyone lifts a blade.”
Tony actually did feel a little better about that. Kind rumors were a good thing. And the Alpha was young, at least. Howard could be marrying him off to some ancient Alpha who wanted a pretty young thing.
Steve was gone before Bucky could get a word out. He hummed, a bit of a frown replacing his happy and teasing smile. He turned back to Tony, who was reaching for a mug of coffee but looked a little worried too.
Tony managed to stop his work at 6. He shut the lab up and grabbed a quick shower, before meticulously picking out what to wear. He was nervous; this was all so sudden after thinking he had absolutely no chance with Bucky, just like he’d had no chance with Steve.  Shit, Steve. They should probably tell him that this was happening, along with the rest of the team. Whatever this was.
Steve’s hand reached out and touched his, and Tony looked up sharply to meet his husband’s gaze. There was sadness there, a knowing look that spoke volumes. “You need to eat, my love. Starving yourself won’t fix what happened,” Steve spoke quietly. Steve’s hand went to Tony’s stomach and stroked there lovingly. Tony sniffed and looked away, not wanting to cry. His emotions were haywire, being pregnant, and this very real, heavy grief was certainly not helping.
The man beside him scoffs. “Why don’t we just do it right off? Tonight.” Brock shook his head at the other man’s impatience. It really is too bad that many of the smarter warriors defected.
Months went on, as both sides prepared, and one morning a large group of people came on horses, carriages and on foot to their clan. Tony’s heart clenched in his chest when he saw familiar faces, some people in southern clothes. Was this it? Did they come to fight?
It was two solid hours before he heard the elevator ding and two sets of steps behind him. Thor was off-world, Natasha and Clint had gone in for some SHIELD work, Vision and Wanda were on a date (which, honestly, he was still trying to wrap his head around that), and Sam was visiting the VA. So it had to be the two super soldiers. He quickly turned around to look at them, and he almost breathed a sigh of relief as he saw them holding hands, fingers laced together. He smiled, tentative but hopeful as he stood up and put his StarkPad aside.
Steve smiled wider once he heard it and he nodded, not even once thinking of questioning it. “It’s perfect,” he told Tony resolutely. He turned to Tony’s stomach and kissed it gently. “Little Peter, give your mother an easy time,” he asked of the unborn child. Tony couldn’t help but smile fondly at the gesture.
“Wow,” Tony breathed out, and then he flushed because that was so not suave. Bucky laughed and gave him a long once over, obviously appreciating his view too, which only made Tony’s blush worse.
Steve had been right, of course. Bucky hadn’t been the same. He’d been changed, a shell of a man. And Steve found himself at a horrible impasse.
They’d known Bucky was out there, of course. After the fall of Shield, Steve had hunted for Bucky relentlessly, with Sam’s help. His lost friend hadn’t wanted to be found. He wouldn’t give up, he’d decided, but his heart had to move on. He couldn’t wait for Bucky to find him again; especially since what was left of his friend wasn’t the same man he’d known all those years ago.
Word spread of the Rogers clan’s intent. They sent the young brave messenger to tell Obadiah to expect war. He’d gone with a grim look on his face, knowing there was a chance the tyrannical man would strike him down just for uttering it. Tony felt extremely bad for him and kept looking to the southern horizon to see any word of him or other supporters.
The golden hair was the first thing he noticed. Then, he noticed the pale skin of those in the North. The young Alpha was taking to his father politely, a patient smile on his face. He hadn’t noticed Tony yet as the Omega got ever closer.
Steve had managed to convince Tony that he should travel on a carriage or horse the whole way, at the very least. Tony had begrudgingly agreed to that much. He got on his horse and looked at his new home. He hoped to be back here before winter fully settled in, though if they won, maybe it would be smarter to be in the southern lands. The child would have a better chance at survival there.
“Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare give me that look. I’m your father. You can’t even be an Omega correctly, can you? You have to be the most ostentatious, ornery Omega there ever was,” Howard continued, spitting his words in his rage.
The midwife made quick work of the chord that attached them. Tony’s heart melted as he saw the boy’s face. He was instantly in love. Bruce swaddled him after cleaning him the best he could. He handed the boy to Tony and the omega let out a soft sob.
“Congratulations to you and Lord Steven,” Brock said as he looked up to the other Alpha and bowed at him as well. The Rogers clan immediately moved to help the supporters, housing them and their horses. They had space, that’s for sure. The plague that wiped out a large number of their population left houses and barns uninhabited.
“So I’ve heard.” The elevator stopped at their destination and Bucky easily followed Tony out. “But you know me,” Tony answered, meant to be a gentle tease in return, but it struck something in Bucky. A nice, warm feeling that bloomed through his chest. He did know him. And he wanted to know even more of him.
Bucky stirred and smiled softly as he felt the morning sun filter in through the window, a warm body beside him. Friday’s voice spoke softly, announcing that it was 8 in the morning and 64 degrees outside on a Wednesday. He heard a soft grumble beside him and his smile widened.
Howard shifted, posturing slightly, but Tony didn’t back down. He didn’t care what an Alpha did or said, he wouldn’t be some demure, barefooted Omega. Not that he thought anything less of soft-spoken mothers who cherished their life at home. But that wasn’t him. He was a thinker, an inventor. He didn’t want a mate or children, at least not right now.
He’d just finished getting the armor on when he heard the alert. He quickly stepped out of his tent and saw some of Obadiah’s men in the camp. They were slashing with swords from their horses, and some were trying to burn tents and food stores. Tony gritted his teeth.
Steve shook his head as they walked back into the elevator. Tony was getting a little worried about how serious Steve suddenly looked. Although, he figured that the reaction was warranted, considering the current situation.
“Is it done? I hear a lot of celebrating outside,” Steve asked him, looking hopeful, while at the same time admiring the peaceful scene of Tony feeding their pup. Tony smiled brightly and nodded.
Bucky’s eyebrows knitted together in concern, and Steve made himself keep going if only to get rid of that horrible look on his best friend’s face. “I love you, Buck. Not like a brother, not as a friend. Something more…and I always have.” The admission wasn’t a weight off his shoulders. It terrified him. He looked up, his heart heavy, hoping he wasn't about to lose Bucky again.
“It’s done. We can relax and be free,” Tony said. He looked down at the sleeping child in his arms. “Our beautiful son is finally safe.”
Howard hadn’t denounced Tony’s right to rule the clan, surprisingly, but had searched endlessly for a deserving Alpha to look over him. Of course, Tony’s attitude had chased most prospects away.
Howard and Maria greeted them, and Tony allowed himself to hug his mother, though he largely ignored his father beyond the usual pleasantries. Plans for their departure were already underway. Many people were packing, and Tony could see that his own tent was in a state of slight disarray as Pepper and other Omegas in waiting worked to pack Tony’s things.
Rumlow chuckled darkly and spat at Tony’s feet. Tony didn’t recoil at all as he stood his ground. “You aren’t fit. Look at you, barefoot and pregnant and useless. You think you could fight a battle, or lead your people with a clear head in your condition?” Rumlow spat out.
He felt close to these people already. It was going to be very hard to resist this marriage, and honestly, as the night went on Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to resist it. Steve’s clan sounded freeing, and if Tony could escape his father’s watchful eye, it would be a blessing.
The night they planned to make their first attack, Tony was arranging his armor. He was even bigger now, but he ignored the concerned looks of the people. He wouldn’t let a pregnancy stop him from hurting those who had hurt his family. He was eight months along, and he’d had to constantly work on his armor throughout their travel.
His mother had never trusted Obadiah. He was one of father’s closest advisors. He’d been around all Tony’s life, and he’d never thought anything malicious about him. Though once it was clear Tony was an Omega, there had been obvious changes. Obadiah was obviously hoping for the crown to be passed to him.
“Okay,” Tony agreed softly, trying to calm himself down. They went to Steve’s floor, getting off the elevator wordlessly. Tony followed Steve to the living room, sitting down when Steve prompted him to. His hands were sweating a little, Steve’s behavior making him beyond nervous.
It had been four years since he’d presented, and Tony had been just starting to gain hope that his father would let him be a ‘spinster’, as it were, and pass on the clan to him anyway. Not that he wanted it, but still.
Steve couldn’t help but watch. He could enjoy the sight now that he knew he hadn’t lost them both to each other. They were so beautiful together, and Steve knew he would never tire of watching them. Bucky turned to him next, and he caught Bucky’s lips in a kiss easily, like it was the most natural thing in the world to do. He heard Tony’s quiet, interested hum from beside them.
“Do you want me here, love? I can leave you be, or you can have me,” Steve said softly as he led Tony up the stairs. It wasn’t until Tony was sitting in the furs that he gave thought to question that Steve had asked.
Anyway, enjoy much fluff for Steve and Bucky, with Steve and Tony's resolution right around the corner.
Tony ducked his head a bit, something he never does, as he feels a pull toward the Alpha. Is this how nature intended it? He’d never felt such a connection. Maybe this was what wanting to mate felt like. “I suppose you’re right. I have a few furs, but not many. Even the winter doesn’t make the lands here very cold,” Tony admitted, finally able to bring his gaze back up to Steve’s blue eyes.
Bucky laughed, completely unaware of the hurt Steve was feeling. He figured the discomfort was the same as it always had been. Steve wasn’t very good with mentions of romance or sex, let alone seeing displays in public.
Tony should be used to the words by now. He’s heard them every day since he presented at the young age of just sixteen. Undeserving. Useless. Meek. Omega.
The council meeting took a long time. They went after dinner when most people were either still grieving or starting to get ready for bed.
“Do you, Anthony Edward Stark, take this Alpha as your mate, to cherish and love and serve until your dying breath, the gods as witness?” The priest’s voice came through with clarity then. There was such a quiet hush, as the whole clan watched for his answer.
“He’s coming soon, isn’t he? That’s why you won’t strike me,” Tony said with a quiet, but accusatory tone. Howard glowered at him, and didn’t deny it. Tony was highly observant. He knew it wasn’t because his father changed his mind at the last second, realizing he would hurt his son. The Alpha would be here soon, and Howard didn’t want Tony to look like damaged goods.
They took one more moment to look around their old place, silently remembering another lifetime, before Bucky gave a little tug on his hand and they left. The receptionist gave them a smile as they walked out, but Steve was too preoccupied with the fact that Bucky was still holding his hand to notice.
Tony cursed loudly and punched his table, his breathing wavering as he tried to get a hold of himself. It took a long time until he could click on the next one. He didn’t want to see it, but he needed to understand.
“What?” Steve managed to croak out, finally feeling brave enough to look into Bucky’s eyes. Bucky let out an impatient huff, and he smirked. Steve wanted to know just what in the hell the jerk thought was so damn funny, but he was still in too much shock to ask.
Navigation went offline as well, and he had to act quickly. They were in the middle of nowhere, and there wasn’t a federation planet nearby that they could hail.
Pepper looked relieved. She smiled shakily and leaned into his touch. “I wasn’t sure…” she said softly. Tony tutted and stood, taking off his own robes and giving Pepper a break from it all.
“There are some I suspect for being the traitorous ones. Alphas I know to be particularly old-fashioned. I do not want to make accusations outright, however. It could hurt the image I’m trying to uphold to my real supporters,” Tony said to his husband in the quiet of the night.
Tony shifted a little, his expression going a serious again. “The Federation contacted us. They should be here within the week to pick you up…along with your crew.”
“Hey, Tones!” That had become a nickname that Bucky was sticking to. Rhodes called him that too sometimes, so he hadn’t minded in the least. Tony wandered over to Bucky, sitting next to him as he took another long sip of coffee before answering.
He met with his father halfway to Steve and shared a look as he took Howard’s arm. For the first time in a long, long while, his father’s gaze looked genuinely soft. He had to look away, not wanting to be emotional on top of the nerves that he felt. He’d suffered so much growing up. A caring look on his wedding day wouldn’t change that.
“Rhodey,” Tony whined the nickname of his best friend. “Please, don’t make me go. Tell them I’m unwell,” he tried on last desperate attempt to somehow get out of all of this. James Rhodes looked at him with a look that was half-stern and half-amused. Rhodey was a beta and one of the higher-ranked warriors in his father’s army. If he’d been an Alpha, there might have been a chance that Howard would’ve married them, despite the fact that Rhodes didn’t have a royal or privileged background.
The union also promised more lands for their future generations, among many other benefits that were hard to ignore. It was no surprise that a large majority were in favor of this marriage.
He’d had a long time to grieve his parent’s death, a long time to heal. It had been one thing when he’d thought it was just an accident, with alcohol on Howard’s breath. But now? This was another thing entirely. He’d grown up listening to tales of Sargent Barnes. His dad hadn’t been as fond of him as Steve, but he was up there.
Soon, most of his thoughts were lost, as Steve finally joined him on the bed and bent over to kiss him. The Alpha’s body slotted above Tony’s, and the Omega immediately reacted, spreading his legs so Steve could fit between his thighs. Their hands wandered, as their kissing got more eager, more fervent.
The door to his and Bucky’s old place was propped open and he noticed that it actually was the same door. He walked up to it and reverently put his hand on the dim iron wrought number nailed to the door. He was distantly aware of someone snapping a picture. He didn’t care. Most people wouldn’t dare mock Captain America for visiting his old home, and if they did, they didn’t much matter to Steve.
Following the announcement, people devolved into celebrations. Though there was some trepidation over the fact that some would have to relocate, it was largely pleasant news. Tony felt relief when he was finally off of the dais and back at the fire with Steve and his people.
He didn’t care how devastatingly handsome Steven was. Or that he had the loveliest laugh Tony had ever heard. Or that he had shoulders that had, seemingly, been shaped by the gods themselves.
The two redheads began to talk and Tony eventually went to sit by Clint to get to know the archer better and to let the two Omegas have some time together. The interest there was clear, and Tony did hope for their happiness. The morning bled into the afternoon like this. Sam, Wanda, and Pietro joined them later, and Tony found himself enjoying their company again just like he had last night.
The three of them left the lab silently, Steve following the two of them, kind of reminiscent of a lost puppy. Tony showed Bucky the floor he’d let him stay on if he chose to stay beyond a few hours. Bucky hesitated at the elevator doors. Then he reached out and gave Tony a hug, shocking both Tony and Steve quite a bit.
It was more than ready for tomorrow though. He’d done a number of upgrades on it. Now he had miniaturized crossbows in the arms as well. He could shoot small arrows from internal triggers in his gauntlets.
A frantic messenger, one that Tony noticed from his childhood lands, searched the crowd until he found Tony. The boy messenger was young, a Beta who had obviously traveled far, and very quickly.
“No mercy! And leave Obadiah for me!” Tony called to them as he readied one of his gauntlets. He’d fixed the armor to fit him again, despite Bruce’s protests that he should be in bed. Here he was, an omega, three days after giving birth, leading an army into war.
“Ah…yes. Steven, this is my son, Anthony,” Howard’s terse voice floated through the air as Tony got close enough to stand in their circle. Their people were looking on with excitement. Some looked disapproving that Tony hadn’t looked away from Steven’s gaze; some were too swept up in the drama to care.
“What? What’s wrong?” Tony asked, as he got up and threw some clothes on in a hurry. In their line of work, they needed to be ready for just about anything, and Tony was reacting on impulse.
Tony was shocked for a long moment before he reached down and touched Brock’s shoulder. “Rise,” he told the Alpha gently. “I have to confess, I did not expect you to be among my supporters,” Tony said with some trepidation in his eyes.
The announcement for the mass funeral was made for later that day. People all paused their usual work to help for the preparations. Plots were decided upon by the families and temples. Candles were gathered and set along the walkways. The sun was just setting when the official procession started.
Tony squared his shoulders a bit and nodded. “I did,” he answered succinctly. He didn’t want to seem too eager. It would be out of character for him, and perhaps Howard would start questioning a match that Tony was actually amenable to. “I believe our tribes have the most to offer each other. Though the final decision is of course up to you, father.”
He almost felt sick as he made his way through the tower. He couldn’t get the image of Tony and Bucky out of his mind. They were beautiful together, everything Steve could’ve hoped for, yet it tore at him. His heart feeling like it was in pieces with every step he took as he retreated.
“Don’t,” Tony said sharply in response. “Don’t say that. You deserve to heal. You didn’t deserve what those assholes did to you.” Tony was adamant about it, face more serious than Bucky had seen it yet. Bucky didn’t give that a response; just let quiet wash over them for an instant.
Tony worked as quickly as he could while still being careful. An hour went by, silence filling the room before Tony finally fixed the last of the mess and the arm whirred, as healthily as it could. Bucky sighed, obviously in relief as most of the pain left him. Tony looked at his face for a moment. Bucky was still handsome, but his face was different than the WWII photographs and footage. It was haunted, dark. Older. Tony made quick work of closing the arm back up.
“Okay, not the best choice of words. But I saw his reaction to you. He likes your…certain temperament. I can’t think of too many Alphas who wouldn’t have been offended just by you looking them in eye without permission,” Rhodes said, and Tony knew it was true. Damn it all, but he knew Rhodes had a point.
He got even closer to Steve’s entourage, too. It was beyond easy to talk with them, and they seemed to like Tony in turn. Tony didn’t even have to think before asking Natasha to join him in getting ready in his tent before the wedding. He’d ask the rest of them, but Betas were not permitted. Even Rhodes had to stand guard outside.
“Don’t worry, my darling. Our son is strong,” Steve said quietly as if reading his mind. Tony looked up at him, raising an eyebrow. He was temporarily distracted by the panic and adrenaline in his veins.
Steve stepped up behind him, kissing his neck. “I’m sorry I ever doubted you. I was scared. I am still scared,” Steve admitted softly. Tony leaned back into his Alpha’s touch and sighed. They’d been having a bit of a fight this past week, Steve wanting him to stay behind, and Tony wanting to join the fight.
“Thank you,” Steve said to him before Tony could get much of anything out. “Tonight was good, and I’m glad we cleared the air between us.” He looked extremely genuine in that thought, his bright blue eyes conveying so much honesty that Tony almost looked away.
“You were going to leave, huh?” Steve asked like it was a casual question. Like he was asking how Bucky’s morning had been. Bucky was silent for a long moment before he could answer.
They’d spend hours talking to each other; Tony exchanging his latest invention plans for stories of the Howling Commandos. Bucky was surprised he remembered a lot of the stories he told. His memory was getting better with every day, and he could see that it made Tony happy. It made the whole team happy, which was a surprise. They’d really taken Bucky under their wing and even though Bucky felt like he didn’t deserve their affections, he was grateful.
The meeting went on for another hour, as they hammered out details about the quickened schedule. All would be announced tomorrow, and it would be hopefully quick work from there. Steve and Tony left the council room and headed back to their quarters. A silence hung between them until they got inside.
He settled in the furs next to his husband and smiled when Steve turned and immediately enveloped him in an embrace. Steve’s hand came to rest on Tony’s stomach, and he muttered sleepily into Tony’s shoulder, “He will live long and sound.” Tony blinked and turned to look at his Alpha. It turned out the other man was fast asleep.
“My father fought the elders on it endlessly. When the plague hit, the elders and a large majority of the council died. So, the laws were up to me,” Steve explained. Tony had judged this Alpha too quickly, it seemed.
Steve was going to need to sit down soon. “This has to be a dream,” Steve muttered to himself, but again with the super hearing, Bucky caught every word. The jerk laughed, and Steve felt a slight blush form on his cheeks and the tips of his ears.
Bucky had gone a little pale and had asked Tony if he could go alone. It had torn at Tony to agree, but he knew that this was something that Steve and Bucky needed to do by themselves. He’d nodded and snagged a quick kiss before letting Bucky go. All attempts at trying to distract himself with research and designs for the team had been futile. He could only think about what must be going on if Bucky had found Steve at the little museum that they’d figured he’d be at. If he had, what were they talking about? He hoped that Steve didn’t hate them now.
The army moved on, Steve and Tony in the midst of it all. Their numbers were impressive, considering their population. Almost all able-bodied people had volunteered for the training and for the war. They’d left Fury in charge of the clan, Maria electing to come with them as well. Her premonitions would be useful during the trip and during the battle.
Tony felt sick. He didn’t want to marry some random Alpha. He didn’t want to leave the clan or be some random young Lord’s plaything. He just wanted to stay here and keep inventing, keep thinking. His mind was too full of ideas for him to just settle down and be a mother.
“You’re not what this clan needs. You’re a disgrace. Why have the gods punished me so, by giving me a son like you?”
“Hydra…who or what is Hydra?” Tony asked Steve quietly, close enough that the Alpha could hear him through the chaos of the streets. They’d have to rein this in eventually, but Tony was trying to center himself, and it was good to let the people get their anger out for a little while.
Of course, those worries all seemed silly a few weeks later. He was going to the horse stalls to feed them in the morning when the smell of horse and hay hit him hard. The smell had never bothered him at all, not in his whole life, but now…now he was quickly ducking to the side and emptying the contents of his breakfast into a feed bucket.
“No, Tony. You’d be proving them wrong, even from here. I’m leaving the clan in your hands. You will lead our people alone in my absence. I’m trusting you with the stability of our home, of what our liberated people will return to,” Steve tried to explain further, but that just got Tony angrier.
“We shall see,” Tony said quietly, and the rest of their meal was spent in companionable silence. They set their bowls aside and walked out to join the fray of the clan. Most were up and doing their chores and duties by now. He quickly scanned the crowd but did not see Steve among the many people. He was more than likely with Howard, discussing the agreement.
Once the ceremony was over, the people left the loved ones of the victims to grieve in more privacy. Tony could barely touch his food at dinner before the council meeting. He couldn’t stop thinking of all the death, of Hydra. He eventually had to push his plate away.
He felt a warm hand on his face and it lifted his gaze back up. “Don’t be nervous, Tony. If you aren’t ready, we can wait. We barely know each other, I know it can’t be easy for you,” Steve said quietly. The sentiment was so sweet, that Tony could’ve cried for the second time that night. Would he wait? What other Alpha would allow their Omega to choose something like that?
Tony retracted the faceplate, eyes glaring with a violent gaze. Obadiah’s countenance immediately went shocked, and then angry. The Alpha let out a bark of horrid laughter.
Bucky had been spending a lot of time with Tony in his lab. He was fascinated by science, as it turned out, and Tony was all too eager to try and explain his ideas to someone who actually looked interested. Steve always did too, but Tony knew it was because he had a friendly fondness for Tony’s antics, not because he was genuinely interested in Tony’s inventions. But that was fine in Tony’s book.
Labor wasn’t anything like how it was dramatized. Tony spent long hours just staring at the walls and sighing in boredom, wishing he could be in his armor and preparing for the fight. Then, a contraction would hit, and he’d have to bite down a scream and breathe through it.
Tony realized he was just staring. He made himself move forward, sandaled feet padding along the evened floor of their dwelling. His heart was pounding by the time he got close to his new Alpha. He stood in front of him again and Steve reached out carefully as he took off Tony’s jewelry. It was not at all rushed, a quiet process that Tony could definitely get used to.
Rhodes stepped forward and gave his account. “I was guarding the front doors of the Lords’ dwelling when I heard a shout from their bedroom. I made with haste up the stairs once I’d unlocked the door. I saw him grappling with Lord Steven, knife in hand, his intent clearly to harm or kill,” Rhodes said. The people looked on angrily at this news.
Petals were thrown in their path as they walked by the people, the trail of small fires leading to the tent that had been prepared for them tonight. Suddenly, Tony was gripped with nervousness again.
This time though, his heat came with the prospect of a family. He felt the first harsh cramp and wave of want as he was on his way back from the library. He let out a shuttered gasp, and a passing villager stopped, looking at him with concern.
“You mean which one is ours?” He answered by leading him to the structure. It was only slightly bigger than most. The door, a heavy cherry wood that was adorned with iron hinges, swung open with a soft creak.
“Steve? I…he just showed up. He was in pain, I fixed his arm,” Tony tried to explain. He felt his heart hammering in his chest. He had these stupid feelings for the other man, and it had gotten worse since he and Pepper had split about six months ago. Steve had never seemed interested, though. Painfully straight, Tony figured. So, he hadn’t pressed, hadn’t even given an indication.
“Father, no. Please don’t marry me off to some random Alpha. You know that isn’t what I want,” Tony pleaded, even though he knew it was useless. He couldn’t spend his days tinkering and inventing in his tent, even if the tribe used a number of his inventions widely. He didn’t get credit for them of course, because how could an Omega mind come up with such things?
Steve let out a quiet laugh, and Tony felt the butterflies stir deep in his belly. It truly was a delightful sound. “You’re sharp-minded. Strong-willed. Beautiful. I don’t think I could find a better match. I don’t want my Omega to be demure. I want someone who will lead beside me. It seems to me, you have the capability despite your upbringing. That is very telling, that you keep your ground despite it all.”
In the three days that followed, Steve stayed asleep. No matter how much time Tony spent by his side, the damn Alpha would not wake up. He tried putting Peter on Steve’s chest, hopeful that the feel and scent of their son would rouse him from the coma. It was of no use.
Tony’s blood boiled. “You. You’re the one that wounded him?” Tony raised a gauntlet, pointed it right at Obadiah’s head. It would be so easy. He should just fire now. “He’s alive, you failed. Just like your attempt at a takeover is failing now. You’re being bested by an Omega who just gave birth three days ago,” Tony said with an air of confidence, a smirk on his face.
“I’m fine, seriously, Bucky,” Steve tried again with a small, hesitant smile. He tried his best to fake contentment, but he knew it was a lost cause.
“No, there’s nothing we can do about the wedding. It’s happening. Though, there might be something we can do afterward. Let them get married, let Tony take the few he trusts to the barbaric North,” Rumlow said quietly. “If we can’t get Howard to see reason once the Rogers’ influence is gone…we take matters into our own hands. We cannot let the clan fall into Rogers’ hands when Howard passes.”
“You deserve it just as much as us, Tony,” Steve said softly, and they were even closer now. Steve let his eyes flit over Tony’s features. Taking in everything at once, as much as he could. The other man’s long dark eyelashes, the slight crows feet that got more prominent when Tony smiled. Tony snorted derisively.
“Whoa there, tiger. Take it easy.” There was a voice to his left and Steve quickly whipped around to see who was speaking. The accent was strange, but some sort of universal translator was making it possible for him to understand.
But a quick look around made him realize that no one was dressed in the official ceremonial garb and that there were many children among them. Tony was glad to see the messenger among them too. He was surprised to see Brock Rumlow leading them. The alpha had power in the Stark clan, and his father was a well-known and well-respected member of the council.
“Excuse me?” He asked, his voice a little small for once. She gave him a thoughtful look and hummed. She didn’t look impressed for some reason and Tony really hoped he hadn’t offended her with his shock. He, of course, knew Omegas were capable of it, but Alphas never gave them the chance.
“He wasn’t pulling your leg about what? That I’ve been in love with you for years? That every time you came down to my lab, I would fantasize that it would be the time that you’d finally ask me for coffee?” Tony asked, a small private smirk on his lips as he watched Steve’s blue eyes widen.
Tony huffed and took Bucky’s flesh hand in both of his. “James Buchanan Barnes. Even before tonight, you had to have known I didn’t blame you. You’re a hero, a veteran who was victimized, and a prisoner of war. You’re the bravest man I know,” Tony said softly and that got Bucky to look back into Tony’s eyes.
When he and Pepper finally settled down and curled next to each other on the furs, Tony let his mind wander a little. Steve, his bright blond hair, and blue eyes. His kind smile and beautiful laugh. Tony never thought he’d feel this way for an Alpha, and it was so sudden as well. The gods seemed to be giving him an out, here.
Steve’s gaze immediately went to him, worry evident on his face. He walked over to his Omega and looked him over. “Tony?” Came his concerned voice, though he kept it quiet so most of the people wouldn’t notice. “Were you injured during the battle?” That was his most likely conclusion. That Tony had been slightly injured and had been hiding the pain in front of their prisoners.
It almost didn’t feel like a march toward war and Tony held out hope that their plan was working. They were going to surprise Obadiah and beat him in the dead of night. It wasn’t as honorable of a win as Tony would hope for, but the truth of the matter was that if they did try for an honorable face-to-face battle, they’d lose.
“I’d like to get some rest now, mother. If that’s okay?” He felt so tired all of a sudden. She nodded and stood, before planting a soft kiss on Tony’s forehead and leaving his tent. He watched her go before sinking into his furs. He could cry some more, but he refused. He let his eyes slip closed, and prayed to the gods for the best, for something good to come out of all of this.
Tony felt a rush of pride to elicit such a reaction. “It’s my suit. I invented it. It’ll help keep me and the child safe.” He’d made sure to put extra thick protection around his midsection. No blade was cutting him there. He’d tested it. It all bounced away, and there were no structural weak points anywhere near his stomach.
He quickly darted into his tent, trying to get himself under control. The kiss, though brief, had been absolutely amazing. He wanted so much more, and it honestly terrified him and thrilled him at the same time.
Tony would die, Steve would die, and their child would die. He’d spit in honor’s face to prevent that. Besides, Obadiah certainly had no honor. Murdering his parents in their bed. Sending his men to murder innocent children in Steve and Tony’s streets. No, this group did not deserve any graciousness.
It was useless though, and despite Steve trying his best with his orders, the asteroid sped towards them as they sat helplessly in space. There was a resounding, crashing noise and…darkness.
He looked up to his Alpha, whose serious blue eyes looked right back. He nodded, seeming to be in agreement with Tony’s statement. The slaughter of Tony’s parents could not go unanswered.
He wanted to scream back at his father when he heard those sour words. He knew it wouldn’t get him anywhere, though. Any kind of outward resistance would only lead to more disappointment and possible punishment.
“Tony! Goodness!” She exclaimed. The topic of Omegas and Alphas finding mates with their own genders, or even Betas, was still an intense political debate. Alpha/Alpha pairs were seen as truly barbaric in some traditionalist’s eyes. Omega/Omega pairs weren’t much better, but they were turned a blind eye to sometimes. Betas being with Alphas or Omegas were more accepted, though traditionalists mostly liked Betas to stick with their own.
A lot went through Tony’s mind in that moment. The grip was gentle, first of all; obviously not meant to incapacitate Tony, just stop the wrench from meeting its goal. The goal being the intruder’s face. The second thing he noticed was, well, the shining metal hand that had actually caught him. There weren’t too many people with metal hands. Tony let his eyes flicker up, and yep, that’s what he’d thought.
“All right, buttercup. I’m gonna open these access panels. Promise not to get jumpy?” Tony asked him as he scooted closer. Bucky nodded firmly, looking straight ahead. Tony let his hands go to work, pressing and unscrewing tiny pieces to the arm to get it to open. It was a tangled mess. All jammed and split wires. Tony tutted. “What the hell did you do to this thing?” He asked, not expecting an answer. There wasn’t one.
He conceded, nodding with a frown. “Okay. But try to capture Obadiah alive?” He wanted to watch that man die. If he couldn’t be part of the raid itself, he wanted at least that. Steve gave him a serious look and nodded.
“Do you…do you mind if I stay down here with you?” Bucky found himself asking. He wanted a little company, but he didn’t want to talk to Steve right now. He had a feeling Tony felt the same way, hence why he had locked down his lab from visitors.
“He’s almost here, come on Tony,” Bruce told him with encouragement. Tony let out one last pained scream and pushed with everything he had. Then the air was filled with a newborn’s cries. Tony ignored the pain down his back and between his legs as he sat up quickly to see his son.
Steve wasn’t sure how that was possible, considering the ship had just been on fire and in pieces moments ago, burning and falling apart all around him and his crew.
Tony gave her a confused look before his eyes widened in realization. “What? You think…? No, perhaps it was just bad milk.” His mind tried to reason with it. It could be so many things. He could just be sick, though he had no other flu symptoms and he felt a lot better now.
His mother, a beta whose calming scent was known throughout the entire tribe, would do her best to meet up with Tony after the fight and calm him down. She tried every single time this happened. She’d make excuses for her husband, of course. He was raised in that mindset. Just let him simmer down, he’ll be fine in the morning.
“G’ back t’ bed. It’s ungodly,” Tony muttered into the pillow, trying to shield the light as Friday pulled back the automatic curtains. Bucky just kissed Tony’s temple and stretched as he got up.
The asteroid was hurtling closer at a rate far too rapid to avoid it, especially with all of their systems down. They were going to crash; rather it was going to crash into them. It got larger and larger as it neared them; their only visual of it was through the glass.
“Tony…” Steve started as they got to their bedroom. Tony took off the outer layers of his clothing, back turned to his Alpha. He kicked off his boots and heard the other man as he sighed in exasperation.
Tony spoke up, not wanting to wait another moment to affirm. “I do,” he said and the relief in Steve’s eyes was obvious. He had no idea what the Alpha was expecting. Though, he supposed that the Alpha must have had worries of his own before tonight, just like Tony had in his tent.
Before Steve left for battle, he came into the tent one final time. He knelt by Tony’s bedside and took his hand in his. “I’m leaving with Natasha, Clint, Sam, and Wanda,” Steve told Tony, a determined look in his eyes. Tony wished so desperately in that moment that he could go with them.
His voice was rough with disuse, and it surprised even him as it came out gravely. He coughed a little, hand moving up to massage his own throat.
Steve’s gaze found him as he walked closer. The people’s chattering got more excited when they noticed him, which caused all who were sat at the head table to look at him. Tony did not break their gaze. His brown eyes were fierce, challenging, as he looked into Steve’s blue.
It was nothing to shrug about, but he couldn’t do anything about it now. He wanted to move on, he was ready. “Besides, just because I was with her, that doesn’t mean I didn’t notice you. I would have never cheated on her or ended the relationship because of someone else, but…yeah. I did think about us sometimes,” Tony admitted openly, big brown eyes looking into Steve’s blue intently.
“Might want to be careful for the next fifteen minutes or so,” came the Alphas warm timbre. Tony hummed and settled his leg over Steve’s hip. He felt drowsy now, but he didn’t want to fall asleep. He wanted to enjoy this. He let his hands roam along muscled arms and shoulders, Steve letting out a deep, contented Alpha rumble at the contact.
“I’m just saying! I thought I saw the redhead staring at you tonight. Natasha was her name,” Tony teased further, laughing as Pepper chased him around the room with a broom.
There was a small gasping murmur among some. Many Omegas were watching with reverent gazes from the crowd. Tony somehow made his shaking hands still as he looked his Alpha in the eye, standing on the same ground.
The young man turned his face away from her, remaining silent for a long moment, before finally speaking up. “I don’t want to marry, mother. Please. You know I’m meant for more than this…for more than just being a breeding mare for the good of father’s…legacy,” he spat the last word like it was acid on his tongue.
“Friday, lockdown protocol, please. No one has access.” He didn’t even want Rhodes in here at this point. He didn’t think he could have a decent conversation with anyone, and he didn’t want to try.
“Father will be glad to hear that I’ve agreed. I’ve chased away every other prospect. He wants an Alpha to watch over me so badly, though I don’t need it. Regardless, it’ll be good on all accounts. I will be free of him and he will think you have me on a leash,” Tony spat out the last part a bit. He still felt so much resentment toward his father, for all he’d endured growing up, especially after presenting.
Tony sighed and grabbed a cup of coffee, trying to force the thoughts of being romantically interested in Barnes away. It was bad enough with Steve, now he had to go and fall for another super soldier? Figures the men he likes are always as straight as the gods make them.
Surprisingly, the Alpha didn’t look offended. He looked…captivated, honestly. Tony knew it was probably because of how he looked. He wasn’t an idiot; he knew very well how good he looked, all preened like this.
Tony was just starting to show, his stomach rounded some and the skin of it firm. He could still cover it up though, with the large furs and some of the new pants that had been made for him. He fought off the instinct to put a hand on his belly, not wanting to give the group the knowledge if they were indeed here to attack.
Steve, however, was staring at the other man. “Thank you,” Steve offered him, even if he didn’t agree with the sentiment Tony gave him. He took another rattling breath as he looked around the room again.
It was late when Steve and Tony finally went to bed. Rhodey stood personal guard outside their doors, which made the Omega feel safer. Sam and Natasha were on night rounds as well, which made it even better. Tony kept a dagger on the end table and Steve had his shield propped against the nearby wall.
Steve gave him a long look, calculating. He was still grieving, yes, but being alone in this strange room right now didn’t seem like a good option. He shook his head and spoke, his voice raw again, though this time it was from crying.
“I only meant…well, our proposed marriage wasn’t all that was discussed. Despite our dwindled numbers, our land has many resources. Even if an agreement was not to be made of our mating, it was proposed that your clan move some of your people under my regime in exchange for free trade. Your numbers have taken a great toll on your fields, so I’ve heard,” Steve explained easily. It all made sense of course, but Tony was shocked that the Alpha was talking such politics with him. Surely this wasn’t meant for Omega ears? This was the kind of thing the Alpha council and his father saw too.
“Oh, fishing for compliments are we?” Tony teased back, again feeling the rush of being able to speak to an Alpha so casually. Tony hummed, inwardly calming himself down. “I suppose you aren’t half-bad to look at,” he said with a smirk. That got another tingling laugh from Steve and Tony realized at that moment that he was not going to be able to stop this.
He turned slowly and saw Bucky standing there, hands shoved in his pockets. “Think we made a scene of sorts, Stevie. The people downright scattered, the museum’s closed up shop,” He tried to joke, but his smile was a little watery. No doubt he was having a hard time too, seeing this place.
The thought of children came unbidden in his mind. He had to stop himself from lowering a hand to his stomach. It could very well be possible in the next few days, though his scent wouldn’t change for a good few weeks, even if it did stick right away. He knew his chances were much higher during a heat, but it was still possible.
Across the way, where Tony’s childhood clan was still getting settled in, Brock Rumlow watched them with a cool, calculated gaze.
Obadiah hummed in agreement. “We have to wait, for the perfect moment to strike. Anything else would invoke chaos.” He turned to Rumlow, looking stern. “We have to make sure our followers are everywhere. We have to infiltrate in every imperative aspect of both clans. That way when Howard and Steven’s untimely demises are met…there is no question of who leads,” he said authoritatively.
Tony gritted his teeth. “Not exactly,” he admitted, just as quiet. He was only eight months along. It wasn’t time yet. The pup was early. Perhaps not dangerously so, under normal circumstances, but they were in the midst of war. Any little deficiency could mean death.
Obadiah howled in pain and sunk down in front of Tony. He let out a growl of agony and frustration. Tony leaned in a little closer. “Look around you, old man. Your plan is failing,” Tony told him with a quiet severity to his tone.
“This whole time…” Steve said softly, his voice a bit of a wreck because, wow would you look at that, he was crying too. There were things Steve missed so desperately from their old time. But this was one of the things he hated the past for. The laws of their time had kept them scared, kept them unhappy and apart.
It was beautiful. There were small fires burning in little, decorated circles along the ground, making a clear pathway to the dais. All of the people were dressed in their formal best and stood around, waiting patiently and eagerly. There was a quiet murmur as he stepped out, people vying to catch a glimpse of him.
The skirmish lasted a couple of hours before most of Obadiah’s men were dead. They kept two alive, bound and on their knees. Steve and Tony made their way to the captured Alphas, who looked stupidly full of pride despite their loss.
When the usual spiel of weddings started, Tony couldn’t help but drown most of it out. He stared at Steve with almost disbelief. Disbelief that an Alpha like this could exist, and that he was marrying him.
“Lord Stark. It’s your parents! They’ve been slaughtered, my Lord. Obadiah refuses to recognize the land and clan as yours!” The news makes all the gathered people gasp in shock.
He paused as he walked in, and his heart froze as he saw the state of the place. There were broken punching bags everywhere, the gym in a complete state of disarray. Bucky immediately turned and ran toward the elevator. “Friday, where’s Steve?” He demanded, panic surging through him. Had it really been that bad? Was Steve that angry? How had he missed this?
People gave their congratulations when the royal couple reemerged. Many were giving them hopeful looks as well.  Tony knew what they wanted, of course, and he wanted the same. He still had the same worry, though. Maybe he couldn’t get pregnant. Maybe he was a failure of an Omega, and these wonderful people deserved better in a Lord’s mate.
“I’m afraid so, My Lord. Servants found them in their tent, bloodied and cold,” Brock answered. Tony shut his eyes tightly and willed himself not to sob. He had to look strong. He had to prove himself a capable ruler, to show all that had ever turned their nose up at his behavior for being an Omega; he was just as capable as any Alpha.
Pepper blushed a bit and wrung her hands in her lap. “You may call me Pepper. I am Tony’s handmaiden,” she introduced. Natasha hummed and regarded her for another moment, clearly interested. Tony couldn’t help his grin, though he tried to hide it by ducking his head a bit.
“Volunteers will be taken first and foremost, and afterward, a random draft. Now, to more pleasant aspects. The wedding is to take place in two days time. I will need a helping communal hand from everyone who is able, to prepare for the event and a grand feast!” This, of course, received favor. They didn’t have too many clan-wide feasts these days, with their farmlands depleted as they were. Two in a week was a very rare treat.
Tony’s eyes searched Bucky’s as the ex-assassin made his way carefully over to the genius. “I know Steve told you,” Bucky said simply, gaze unwavering. Tony took a sharp intake of breath, looking visibly shaken. The genius broke their eye contact and looked back to his worktable, his arms crossed over his chest.
“Is there a way you could get Tony’s attention for me?” He tried that approach since he was sure access into the lab was barred. However, a simple message to turn around? Surely Tony hadn’t thought to disallow that.
“Then we strike now, quick and by surprise, on his ground. He won’t be expecting it,” Maria offered, looking between the other leaders. Tony hummed in agreement, considering their possible options.
He still loved Bucky, his impossible first love. Yet he loved Tony, the man who had given him a new home.
“You’ve been through quite the ordeal. It might be smart for you to lie back,” the man continued, raising an eyebrow at Steve’s attempts.
As a few months passed, Bucky made very good steps in his recovery. The team was supportive, including him during movie nights and making time to try and get to know him individually. He was particularly close with Natasha. Tony never even tried to interrupt their quiet talks in Russian, huddled together on the rug or the couch in the common room. He was just glad to see Barnes making progress.
Bucky sighed, looking a little fondly exasperated. “Okay, I think maybe you deserve the title of idiot more than I do,” He teased and Steve frowned, purely confused and not at all offended. He was used to their soft teasing. “He’s got it for you, too, you know. We talked about it, how we both had…have, feelings for you,” Bucky explained further.
He turned in his Alpha’s arms. “I know. It’s okay. But I can take care of myself. I won’t let anything happen to our son, I promise you,” Tony said quietly in return. He kissed his Alpha, feeling relief that they’d finally made up. He hadn’t wanted to go into battle angry. It was best if they felt unified, as usual.
Thanks so much for all the support I've gotten with this story! I hope you'll all continue to enjoy future updates!! :)
Another chapter! I skipped a weekend, but I also started a new spideypool fic so...equals out in my eyes haha.
Steve seemed to think on this before nodding. “We’ll meet tonight with the council. For now, I think we should gain control of our people and organize a funeral for the dead,” Steve said before moving to raise his hands and calm their people down.
He felt so light, so full of hope. It seemed almost too good to be true, to be able to take the few people he cared for here, and move to another clan where Omegas could be free to think and do whatever an Alpha could.
Bucky nodded, turning it back around so he could keep reading. “It’s great. I…never even got the chance to celebrate. That part of my identity was wiped away too, it was irrelevant,” Bucky said with a frown.
Tony tried his hardest to contain his excitement as they got down from their horses and put them in their freshly hayed stalls. He took the harness off of his own horse, whom he’d nicknamed Dummy, affectionately of course. He hung the tack in its rightful place and then immediately went out to explore. Steve was behind him, a knowing smile on his face as he watched his mate.
This wasn’t medical on the USS Commando. The equipment in and around him wasn’t even Star Fleet issued.
“Alpha,” Tony breathed as their eager kiss broke for a moment. He raised his legs up a little more, spreading wider for his new mate, presenting on his back. That seemed to have an immediate effect on the Alpha. Steve dove down to kiss along Tony’s throat, dangerously close to his bonding gland. Tony had no problem craning his neck, inviting Steve to bite.
Tony looked at his new husband with admiration as he said this. “You have no idea how glad I am that I’ve found an Alpha who thinks like you do. The sooner we leave this place, the better.”
Despite being in a crash and frozen in deep space for nearly one hundred years, Steve was in peak physical condition.
Steve looked a little lost at that, sad blue eyes meeting Tony’s enraged stare. “Tony…” Steve took a step towards Tony, and somehow the genius managed to stay his ground, he didn’t waver. “He…he’s a victim. If you saw the videos…he’s broken, Tony. He’s been brainwashed, used as a weapon for seventy years,” Steve pleaded with him again.
Rumlow laughed. It was a deeply unsettling sound that gave Tony some nerves. “That I do,” he chuckled darkly. Then, there was sudden movement in the crowd, uproar.
He found himself in Brooklyn, of course, just as the sun’s rays were starting to peek over the horizon. He spent a while riding around, and slowly people started to fill the streets as the day started.
“Yes, Stevie, but that’s okay. We’ll forgive you if you have coffee?” Bucky helped his friend out and took a step back from Tony. That got a whine out of the shorter brunet.
“Tony, please. You need to stay in bed. And I need space. He’s losing blood, I need to be quick,” Bruce pleaded with him, but Tony isn’t really listening. He moves closer, next to Steve’s face. The sound of their son crying seemed to stir Steve slightly.
The rest of the night passed well enough. There was a lot of eating and drinking, as well as entertainment from the actors and singers. Tony met a few more of Steve’s main entourage as the night went on as well.
One thing became apparent as the weeks went on. He wasn’t pregnant. His scent was static, though it smelled more like Steve now. He knew it was probably the stress of the trip. Despite how hard Tony worked to gain Steve’s respect, he wasn’t used to this life. The time for his heat came and went. His body skipped it, too concerned for survival to bother with it.
Tony worked more in his workshop. He had an idea that had been prodding at his brain for a long while now, and he was even more determined to finish it. It was a mechanical suit of armor that snapped around him in a way that fit his body perfectly. Of course, he’d have to bring extra metal and his tools. His belly would grow and he’d need to make constant improvements.
Bucky nodded and showed him what he was reading. Tony’s eyebrows rose, surprised, as he saw what it was about. Kind of old news by now, but it still was surprising. “Gay marriage?” Tony asked, before taking yet another sip of his blessed caffeine.
“You, Brock Rumlow, have been accused of the attempted murder of Lord Steven and Lord Anthony, which occurred the seventh of January. How do you plead?” The High Priestess presided over the trial. Wanda was her name, and she was said to have gifts from the gods as well, though hers were more physical than having visions.
“As for the stuffy council, they’ll deal with it. Howard wants this marriage, so does most of the clan. It would be absolutely foolish for them to oppose,” Pepper piped in as she reached up to place Tony’s formal diadem on his head. It was gold, to match the golden leaf pattern that trailed over the white silk of his dress. A single opal, cut into a pear shape, hung down to rest between his eyebrows. Other opals studded the golden band of the diadem, which was now nestled in Tony’s short dark brown curls.
Tony, for his part, read every single book he could get his hands on. He’d reluctantly return a large majority of them once he’d had them for too long, but the book master had let him keep a few that were particularly helpful for his work.
Tony smiled slightly, and Steve could actually see the gears turning in his brilliant mind as he thought it through. “Hmm. Maybe you’re right.”
“Tony. If you don’t mind,” Tony corrected, brown eyes searching the Alpha’s blue ones. Steven was handsome, almost devastatingly so. It was unfortunate. Some of Tony's more embarrassing, baser Omega instincts were inwardly purring at the sight of the other man.
He hooked another punching bag up and rubbed his hands together before he started to punch, trying so desperately to let all his emotions leave him through the violent movements.
Suddenly, the warmth of his Alpha was gone and Tony opened his eyes. He saw Steve step back further into the tent, toward the bed and furs. He started to take off pieces of his ceremonial garb. His crown, silver and beautifully simple, was lifted off blond hair by large hands. Steve set it aside and then shrugged off his white fur, folding it over a chair. He looked back at Tony and raised an eyebrow while smiling softly.
When they finally stepped out, they were greeted with many congratulations as they walked among the communal spaces. Tony was glad they hadn’t waited. The mark of their mating was clear on his neck, and he was sure both their scents were changed evidently as well. There was no doubt in the people’s minds that the union was complete, which is just as Tony wanted it.
The two days passed very quickly. Tony’s decision to marry this foreign Alpha was only solidified in that time. Steve was kind, considerate, and very liberal for the age. It was obvious that Steve held a candle for Tony and his brashness, as well. Tony was certainly not going to find another Alpha like Steve. This young Lord and his clan was Tony’s best chance at happiness in a world that limited everything an Omega could do.
“How many times I wanted to kiss you. Some of those nights over there in that corner…sometimes I thought I was losing you and I wondered if I should,” Bucky kept explaining, and now the room was spinning a bit. If Bucky hadn’t been there holding him in place, Steve might’ve stumbled.
The crowd cheered as justice was fulfilled, but the words that the Alphas had all said were still ringing in Tony’s ears as he stepped over to Steve. Some attendants took the bodies away, the angry mob of people throwing rotten fruit at and spitting on the corpses. Tony didn’t even think to stop them. He looked out to see his people still picking up their dead loved ones from the street, and decided wholeheartedly that the criminals didn’t deserve proper burials or proper treatment.
The creamy colored fabric was soft, hanging around him in loose folds. Even he had to admit, the color looked striking against his olive skin. His eyes betrayed his true feelings though. There wasn’t excitement shining in them, just numbness, maybe even dread.
“Thank you.” Came Bucky’s rough voice after a long moment of silence. Tony was surprised by it. He stilled and then nodded. Bucky’s eyes were trained on him, searching. “You don’t know,” Bucky croaked out, ominous. Tony felt a bit of a shiver go through him.
“Please. You know this isn’t about you being an Omega. I know you’re capable. I’ve seen it in your training with Natasha, I saw it on your journey here with me. I just…the travel isn’t easy. You know this. I worry about our son,” Steve said honestly.
(Side note, the timeline is a little messed up, I realized. I'll have to go back to other chapters and edit them. For example, Rumlow's execution should have happened in Mayish, according to my time skips. I shall fix all the discrepancies soon!)
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony bided before slipping into his tent. Pepper was waiting for him. He heard Steve and Rhodes talk in quiet voices, eventually getting too far away for Tony to distinguish anything. Pepper looked at him, an eyebrow raised in curiosity.
He got out and dressed, packing up his things quickly. He stepped out of the bedroom; his destination was the kitchen for a few things to eat before he traveled to wherever. Maybe Romania, see where his family came from. He paused, however, when he saw Steve standing by the stove, cooking breakfast. Eggs and bacon, he quickly realized, and more than a few pieces of toast set on a plate and buttered.
Steve felt his breath falter a little bit, with this admission. He really couldn’t believe after all this time of wanting Tony that this might finally be happening. Bucky was waiting for them up in Tony’s room. The three of them? Could it really work like that? “You and Bucky. You both had feelings for me, but didn’t think I’d return them?” Steve felt like the world’s biggest idiot. How could he have possibly given off all the wrong signals? Was he so concerned for their happiness and well being that he’d acted disinterested altogether?
Just as Tony had started to heal, about six months after the fact, Steve’s world came crashing down again. He’d been so close to asking Tony out, as he noticed the signs of Tony’s happiness coming back to him slowly but surely.
They did not go back to sleep that night, too wound up from the night's occurrences. Tony couldn’t sleep even if he wanted to. The baby kicked and jumped on his bladder all night after that as if he was doing a circus act in Tony’s womb. Tony could feel that this one was going to be energetic.
“Yeah, okay. I don’t agree with that, but sure,” Tony said with a slight self-deprecating laugh. Steve’s heart hurt so terribly for the genius. He reached out and put his hands on Tony’s shoulders, feeling along the material of Tony’s collared shirt. He wanted to feel skin, but that was for later.
Tony took a step back when they were finished getting him ready. He took a long look at himself. He had to admit that he looked striking. He turned around and appreciated the draped fabric. The dress dipped down slightly to show some of his back, but not as much as some of his other silks did.
The laugh surprised him so much, his brown eyes widened and his mouth went slightly agape. Howard seemed surprised too but again was cut off before he could utter a single thing.
The Alpha laughed as their clothes came off in pieces, and Tony swallowed up the amazing sound with a kiss as they tumbled into the furs that had been waiting for months.
There were large stone stairs tucked against the front of the building. They led up to a second floor that held two more rooms, each with their own small hearth. Steve swung open one of the doors and Tony immediately knew this was where Steve lived. Furs on the floor again, and a wooden bed that looked so soft that Tony wanted to jump in immediately.
He found that he didn’t want to stay down here, though. He liked the northern areas, where he’d made a home for himself. Where he’d been freed.
The two religious leaders led the ceremony. Quiet sobs filtered through the air as the caskets were lowered into the ground and the Priest and Priestess spent a time over each one. Candles flickered and somber music played, a soft flute that seemed to capture the people’s sorrow in song.
When they finally arrived, there was a big celebration. Tony was secretly taken back by how little the numbers were in this tribe. It truly was a cause for concern, and Tony can see clearly why Steve had been so eager to merge his people with Tony’s. The people of the tribe that had stayed behind, elders, children and people of weak constitution, came up to them with smiles on their faces.
“It’s Steve. Tony, he’s gone and the gym… the gym is a wreck; I’ve never seen it like that. Even if he breaks a couple, he always cleans it up. God, Tony…” Bucky felt terrible dread go through him. Steve had been so withdrawn lately. Bucky had been so wrapped up in Tony that he had brushed it off, disregarded all the signs.
