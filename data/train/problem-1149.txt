“You do as you are told or I'll start breaking your fingers one by one. See how you'll play the violin with that.”
John has time to think about what he'll do to Sherlock when they'll arrive home during the train journey. As Sherlock's arse will still be off limits for some time, penetration is not an option. Yet, Sherlock's bruises are getting paler, the cuts and burns are healing and his face is almost back to normal.
“You look knackered.” John remarks as Sherlock pulls his coat tightly around himself. It's chilly out here. John takes the bags out of the boot and looks around, obviously impressed by his surroundings.
Eventually, however, the awkward angle takes its toll. John's arm and shoulder start to hurt. He carefully pulls out, but makes sure that the plug stays inside Sherlock's hole. His arse feels positively wrecked by now. Sherlock swoons, almost collapsing onto the floor.
Sherlock's cock feels like a rod of steel wrapped in silk, hot and pulsing. He presses and strains against John's palm, starting to rub himself against John's knuckles. Suddenly, the small room smells of sex, heady and musky.
Kate smiles as best as she can with a mouth full of come before sitting up and leaning over Sherlock's face. He has no idea what's happening until John sharply tells him: “Open your fucking mouth!”
“Watch.” Acri says to John. Then, addressing his kneeling pet: "Get to work, pig. Show our guests what your filthy hole can take."
“Oh, fuck, this is good, so good...,” John sighs before he falls over the edge, spilling deep inside Sherlock's abused, worn hole. He continues to move until he's fully spent, his fingers inside Sherlock smeared with his own come, while Sherlock sobs into his mask in blissful agony. His arse feels on fire, sore, stretched and abused, and he registers with shock that he can't clench his hole. Lube and come ooze out of him, with John's cock still inside him, and he's unable to clench or stop it.
When they reach ten, Sherlock's arse is decorated with a crimson zick-zack pattern. John is completely in his element.
“Is that Sherlock's mobile?” She asks as her eyes follow her clothes. There's a phone lying beneath the gurney.
“More?” John asks, and Sherlock opens wide to welcome all John has to offer. “Look at me.” Sherlock does, and moans as John drips thick beads of saliva into his mouth, gulping it down when told to, licking his lips afterwards.
“This has gone too far.” He says. “We should start over again. Tomorrow.” He kneads Sherlock's lower back with his warm hands and Sherlock sighs but he still shivers a little. John doesn't even undress before sneaking under the covers, holding Sherlock tight as they fall asleep together, exhausted both physically and mentally.
“I think you need some rest now. You'll be allowed to sleep in your bed tonight, but I'll tie you up and plug you. Before that, however, you need some food. Yes, Sherlock, you do. But I'll make you lick it from a bowl on the floor like a dog with your hands cuffed to the radiator.” John pets Sherlock's head while looking directly into his eyes.
He's not sure if he's actually screamed in pain or voiced his revulsion at some point, but suddenly, gaffer tape is pressed over his split lips, before being wrapped tightly around his head a few times Sherlock has to concentrate hard to keep breathing through his nose.
“Good.” Sherlock sighs. “Big. So big. Open. Oh god, John... I'm so open. I can't...” He's clenching, spasming around the toy that invades him, this alien object, unfamiliar, so large that John will be able to fit his whole hand inside Sherlock's body. Soon.
Oh god, Sherlock thinks. He's grateful for getting rid of the cage, but another tube up his penis makes him uneasy. At least, John is a doctor. He knows what he's doing.
When the sandwiches and cold meats have been consumed, Mycroft puts his napkin down and turns towards his brother.
“So?” He asks, and Sherlock turns his head and looks at him before sitting up, decidedly planting his bare feet on the living room rug.
“Of course I'm crying. You were dead. And now I'm holding you again. What else am I supposed to do?” He chokes out, grinning, tears running down his face.
“Sherlock.” Just the one word, his name, but it pins him to the spot. “No secrets. Tell me, what are you up to?”
“I'm sure you'll find anything you might need here. As you explicitly requested corporal punishment, Doctor Watson, I thought the study quite fitting.” Irene makes a gesture with her slender hand that encompasses the whole room and smiles over to John, who nods in appreciation. “The room is soundproof, even the windows have special glazing, so no one will hear the screams should your pet be allowed to make some noise.”
“Come on, now play with it.” Mycroft orders as John is finished, and both men watch as Sherlock cups his hands to gather as much piss as possible from the tiles, sipping, wiping it over his face, pouring it over his heaving torso. He knows that he's moaning like a slut but he can't help it, he just loves getting drenched in piss.
“Don't indulge this habit, John. You don't know what a little encouragement can do to my brother. Could you open your bedside cabinet? There should be a cock cage in it.”
“John, please, I'm already so wet...” The deep baritone washes over him like a wave of pure need, making his skin tingle with desire. “Please, come all over me. I want you to...”
When he comes into the living room John is standing by the window and indicates for Sherlock to sit down on one of the hard chairs at the table, not on the soft couch. Sherlock can feel the plug inside him more intense this way.
The agony is delicious. Sherlock can feel his head start swimming as his mind is clouded over by a soothing fog. It’s a bit like shooting heroin. It’s hot inside the bag and Sherlock has his eyes closed but he still senses unconsciousness approaching. He hopes John will choke him until he passes out. This will show John what he’s able to take, how far he'll go for him.
“Yes.” Sherlock rubs one long, white finger over the rim of his tumbler while keeping his eyes fixed on John.
“We? I didn't fuck around with this creature. There's nothing I have to blame myself for. You, on the other hand...” John doesn't finish the sentence. The unspoken accusation hangs between them like a rotten smell.
He lightly brushes his fingertips over the ends of the clothes pins biting down on Sherlock's lower abdomen before moving to the ones attached to his inner thighs. Sherlock shivers at the waves of pain rolling over him. The skin trapped between the clamps has gone numb over the last hour or so that Sherlock has been kneeling on the floor. Now, every motion triggers shocking agony rippling through his abused body.
“Relax your throat.” John strokes Sherlock's hair back as he fucks his mouth. He has put Sherlock on the bed, turned on his back, and kneels above his body, pushing his cock deep into Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's hands are still cuffed and tied to the headboard, arms stretched above his head. His legs are tied together at the ankles and bound to the the end of the bed.
The silence of the evening is broken by the sound of splintering wood, echoing uncharacteristically loud in the still, warm air. It takes a moment before Sherlock figures out that John must have broken into the small house he'd seen through the hedges. What is it? A gardener's lodge? Some sort of shed?
“God, you are so utterly responsive.” John whispers as he twists the rubber device inside Sherlock's anus and starts to pull at it. Sherlock gasps and moans unashamedly at the delicious stretch. It's not painful anymore.
“What's his name?” John asks as Sherlock pulls the man's face up by his sparse brown hair to take a good long look. He seems vaguely familiar.
Finally seated around the table, they all eat in frosty silence. It might be the most awkward meal John has ever had. He's almost glad when Sherlock announces that he needs a cigarette, stands up brusquely and exits out of the kitchen door barely five minutes after they came downstairs. John shrugs and tries to follow him, but is held back by Sherlock's father.
“Lean forward, on all four again.” John tells him, and he does. He watches John from under his lashes as he fills the small bucket about one third with water, ties the string around its handle and then attaches each end of the string to one of his nipple rings. As the string is pulled taught, the bucket lifts off the linoleum and swings freely a few inches above the floor. It's heavy, tearing at Sherlock's nipples. He sharply inhales as the bucket sways in front of his chest.
Sally slowly turns as Sherlock sinks onto his knees, licking his lips. He is genuinely thirsty after all.
Fifteen minutes later John steps back and admires his work. Sherlock's hands are bound behind his back, the hemp wound tightly in an intricate fashion around his forearms from elbows to wrists. Sherlock's nipples are each wedged between two chopsticks, hold together by rubber bands, making them into bamboo nipple clamps. In the same fashion, another pair of chopsticks is fixed to Sherlock's scrotum above his testicles. A fourth pair John has attached to Sherlock's tongue that is hanging out of his mouth. As the chopsticks prevent him from pulling his tongue back, Sherlock is already drooling copiously.
“He interrogated me. Quite thoroughly. For weeks.” Moriarty's tone is soft again, yet his eyes burn with hatred. “He's very good at it, I have to admit that. It's always a pleasure to deal with a professional.” The grin he shoots Sherlock is full of menace. “What do you think your Mummy and Daddy would think if they'd come to know that Mycroft wants to bone his little brother?” Sherlock makes some undignified sounds at this as he tries to protest.
John has already pulled on blue nitrile gloves. In his gloved left hand he holds a thin red rubber hose, about one inch in diameter and ten inches long, with a funnel on one end; in his right hand is what looks like a black rubber gag, only with a hole in the middle to which a filler neck is attached on one side.
John gives Sherlock time to heal over the next few days, to process what happened and readjust to their reality. He sees to it that Sherlock eats and sleeps, that he drinks his tea and doesn't smoke too much. At first, he'd wanted to deny Sherlock working cases, but soon John had to reconsider. Sherlock needs the cases; he has to proof to himself that nothing has changed, that he can still outsmart London's criminals.
“See? That's what I mean. This wasn't a question, Sherlock. When I want you to speak I'll tell you.” John really starts to get angry by now.
When Sherlock doesn't catch on immediately, she gives his buttocks some forceful strokes until he grabs his arse cheeks and pulls them apart, face and chest now flush with the table top.
“Why would you do that? Why should I trust you?” He sounds way more confident than he feels right now, almost snobbish.
“I estimate Molly might have five minutes left. If you don't ejaculate by then, she'll either suffocate or freeze to death.” Moriarty has put the phone down and is now standing next to Sherlock, pulling his head up again by his curls, his fingers tracing the tears staining Sherlock's face.
As the first spurt of hot piss darkens the light-blue fabric between Sherlock's legs, John lets out a soft moan and cups him harder. Sherlock relaxes a little more, pushes into the touch and lets it flow. He knows what John likes, so he drank three bottles of water over the whole day and numerous mugs of tea, never relieving himself. His bladder is full to bursting and finally letting go feels so good he sighs with pleasure.
“Yes, it's his.” John slides it into the back pocket of his jeans before taking a closer look at Sherlock. He is pale and shivering, his eyes closed, his mouth and cheeks smeared with blood. John carefully parts his jacket, barely covering Sherlock's torso, to look for injuries. There's a small cut to his throat above his Adam's apple and another shallow wound to his abdomen.
“Come on, help you new friend.” He gestures over to the two men, one grunting above the other as he shoves his cock deep down a tight throat. The Asian is chocking and gagging, but his hands hold tight to the taller man's thighs as if to pull him even deeper into his body.
His hand wanders along Sherlock's torso, slipping under the cool satin again, caressing one nipple. Sherlock arches into the touch as the flimsy kimono parts. The thin satin flutters open over Sherlock's pectorals, revealing more flushed skin and the suspender belt around his waist. Sherlock's belly is almost concave, and the glistening head of his cock peaks out of the small knickers. There's a dark damp spot on their front, and John makes a disapproving sound.
John retires at about half past eleven. When he's sure that John is asleep Sherlock powers up the laptop again and opens the browser history. He blinks a few times as the last page John has accessed opens. “Now when you are beaten” the site tells him and Sherlock feels a surprised tingle down his spine. Is that what John wants? Giving or receiving?
It's late afternoon when a sleep-rumpled Sherlock returns downstairs. John brews him a strong espresso while Sherlock takes another shower, scrubbing himself immaculately clean. John watches him drowning the strong coffee in one shot, leaning against the kitchen counter, arms folded over his chest.
“God, kiss him,” John gasps and Kate presses her shiny wet lips against Sherlock's and pushes her tongue into his mouth, licking and sucking while almost climbing into his lap as well. Sherlock does neither resist nor participate, he has no idea what to do with his hands or his mouth, what is expected of him or what he is allowed to do. He can taste John on his tongue but it's watered down and just very messy.
“You understand that you need this, right, after your disgusting behaviour in the bathroom? Getting off from being used as a piss-pot.”
Sherlock clambers onto the mattress and does as he's told, his stiff cock bobbing between his shaky legs. John has taken the dildo from the kitchen chair and now attaches it to the wooden headboard with its suction cup, the black rubber almost poking Sherlock in the eye.
John's a doctor after all. He used to be an army surgeon. He's able to perform the necessary operations himself if he'd be able to obtain a theatre...
“Don’t lie to me, Sherlock. Look at your cock. Hard and leaking. So don’t tell me this is too much.”
After three days, however, John has enough. When Sherlock emerges from the bedroom, hair mussed, still wearing the same clothes he's slept in over the past few days, John blocks his way.
Mark tentatively rubs the blunt head of the dildo over his hole, brushing back and forth as if to tease himself until John passes him the bottle of lube. Mark takes his time to slick up the dildo, making eye contact with John while he works the gooey substance onto the hard, black rubber until it's glistening wet.
“Get up, then, and bend over the kitchen table. I don't suppose I have to tie you up.” John can already feel his trousers tighten at his groin. Elegantly, Sherlock rises to his feet, walks into the kitchen, and drapes himself over the table most enticingly.
When John has to pause for a moment to give his arm some rest, he entertains himself by grazing his short fingernails over Sherlock's raw backside, making him moan and shiver in futile attempts to escape the torture.
John is sitting at a small table outside a cafe on Prinsengracht, overlooking the Westerkerk at the opposite side of the waterway. The bells are chiming, the sun is warm on his face, and the idyllic setting suddenly almost overwhelms him, especially after the events of the last twenty-four hours. He'd love to have a beer to relax, but he's drunken way too much over the past few weeks. Besides, it might be better to have a clear head for whatever revelation he's about to be confronted with. Therefore, he's just nursing a surprisingly good coffee as he sits and waits.
“Do you, by any chance, remember the name of the person who vouched for Lord Saint Clair to have him admitted.”
He wakes again in the early hours of the afternoon. John has cleaned up a bit before he also crawled back into bed, watching Sherlock sleep while pretending to read some mindless novel.
Sherlock is drooling around John's fingers. He can't even suck due to the spider gag. All he can do is take it. John tries to insert his whole hand after a while, stuffing Sherlock’s mouth. His fingers massage Sherlock's tongue as they push deeper and deeper, massaging the roof of his mouth. Sherlock chokes as John's knuckles brush past his lips, and gags as fingertips touch the back of his throat, his body spasming as he tries not to retch. John hums in appreciation.
His heartbeat slows. His breathing calms. “You can do that. For me. For John. You'll look beautiful, stunning. I want to see you like that. I'm sure you'll like the experience. It'll be quite intense.”
But instead of satisfying John, it raises his hackles. Because Sherlock shouldn't just be a thing to be used – even if he John tells him so in a scene. He's a human being with feelings, needs and predilections, if he likes it or not. True, it can be complicated and messy, being aware of one's emotional demands and chasing them. Their current dynamics give Sherlock an easy out by providing a way to ignore his emotional requirements even more than he usually does in favour of morphing into a soulless fucktoy, always ready, never complaining, but also totally devoid of any personality. His soul is fading.
“Let’s clean you out.” John pushes the brush back inside him and sets to work. “That's what dirty whores get when they defy their superiors.”
Sherlock blushes all the way down to his chest as he kneels in the tub. John can see the burn mark high on his right arse cheek. He'll have to see to that after the enema and a shower. For now, he has to remove the glass plug first. Despite Sherlock's by now nicely loose sphincter, John still applies some lube onto the nuzzle out of courtesy before pushing it up Sherlock's rectum. When the device sits deep inside Sherlock, John hooks the bag onto a ring of their shower curtain and opens the tab. Warm water starts to flow inside Sherlock's body.
“How long do you think you can hold it?” John asks and Sherlock just shakes his head and whispers “It doesn't matter.”
“I have to dash, Sherlock, if I want to catch my train.” John smiles ruefully as the naked man in front of him lies back on the bed and stretches out on rumpled sheets. His pale skin is glowing in the gloomy afternoon light, the silver cock cage heavy between his lean thighs, nicely matching the glittering rings piercing his nipples.
“I'd really like to fuck you.” John strokes Sherlock's sweaty hair from his grubby forehead, staring down at him. Spit, tears and come have agglutinated into an obscene patina on those unusually beautiful features.
The man is holding Sherlock's phone, obviously filming or taking pictures, a sly smile on his face that only gets wider when Sherlock starts to fight his restraints again with as much force as his drugged body and fuzzy brain can muster.
We are still in the hotel room in Amsterdam, the morning after John has met Sherlock who he'd presumed dead.
Sherlock is sitting on the chair in his room after finishing his morning routine, his skin flushed a rosy pink from the shower. John has just administered his shot of glucose. Now, he steps back and admires Sherlock's new jewellery. He looks ravishing with his long, graceful limbs, his pale skin, damp black curls falling over his forehead, an uneven seam sealing his mouth, the black twine disfiguring his strangely alluring alien features. He seems almost unreal, like a spectre from a nightmare or a fiendish demon.
Suddenly, the hand from Sherlock’s hair, holding him in place, is removed, presumably to wrap around Mark's erection. Sherlock can't see it but Mark’s balls hit his chin with every thrust as he hears slapping noises, flesh rubbing flesh.
“Oh, I think we'll leave that in.” Sherlock's eyes go wide. “Might be an incentive for you to quickly solve the case.” John winks as he makes for the bathroom.
Sherlock moans and almost sobs, red lips parted and body bucking up, completely undone. John can't wait any longer.
Sherlock is ordered to undress first Mycroft and then John. It’s not easy for him to stand, as no one has yet detached the rope from the chain. The clamps bite painfully at Sherlock’s skin if he doesn't stand slightly bent forward. Every motion tears at the chain, further tormenting Sherlock's already raw nipples.
“I want to see you gag for it.” John had whispered and Sherlock had willingly parted his lips to let John deepthroat him with the longer part of the dildo. And Sherlock had gagged. And spluttered. And coughed. And had begged for more, his lips closing around the black rubber, suckling the head, swallowing it all down while John had played with his nipples until he was half-hard again. Only then had John fastened a cockring around Sherlock's root and balls before he'd dressed him up in flimsy white knickers that barely covered his groin, his balls and shiny cockhead peaking out.
John grins. “As I said, insatiable.” But to ease Sherlock's need John takes another ice cube from the glass and pushes it inside, watching as it slips past Sherlock's soft pink rim. Sherlock sighs with pleasure and rubs his cock against the bedding, his movements becoming more urgent and insistent.
“Oh, John, but he does.” Mycroft’s voice is very soft, soothing. “Only, I had him. In every conceivable way I'm interested in. You know I'm more of a voyeur anyway. I promise that I will be watching, very closely.”
Eventually, John turns Sherlock’s pliant body over to check for damages. His hole is still open and leaking lube, but not gaping anymore. There’s no blood or fissures. John’s sure Sherlock's rectum will be back to normal in a few hours.
Sherlock swipes his tongue over John's testicles, sucks at the sensitive sac and rolls the nuts in his mouth while John fists his cock above his face. It doesn't take long for him to come, decorating Sherlock's dark curls with thick white stripes.
“You naughty, naughty boy. Look what a mess you made. Now Doctor Watson will have to punish you in earnest.” Irene sounds rather satisfied.
John's hands swiftly open his fly and shove his trousers down, allowing Sherlock to step out of them. Now he's just in his snug grey boxer briefs, a wet spot already blooming on its front. The outline of his hard cock is clearly visible beneath the thin fabric.
Sherlock's smile doesn't falter, just becomes a bit acerbic. “Ah, my parents talked to you. No, not my parents. Just my father.” Sherlock states, sounding detached, aloof. “If I truly had wanted to kill myself back then, I’d be dead. I just got high and stupid. It didn’t happen again.”
“Now, isn't that lovely. Did you actually become attached to your new sub? You, of all people? Three continents Watson, one of the most proficient and firmest doms I've ever encountered?” Mycroft's voice is dripping with irony. “What a match. Are we supposed to get a happy announcement soon? I'm rather curious how our parents would react to that if someone told them how you two met and what you've been up to lately.”
Eventually, John gets up and stands on shaky legs, pulling Sherlock into a sitting position by tugging at the leash. Sherlock's face is red, blotchy, wet with saliva, sweat and John's fluids; his eyes droop beneath heavy lids, his hair is a riot, streaked with precome.
Sherlock's head is spinning. This sounds rigid, tough, all-encompassing. It will turn his life around completely. Does he really want this? Is he ready for such a step? Then he remembers the rings through his nipples and the tattoo above his arse. Of course, he wants this. He has wanted it from the day he started all this, when he sank to his knees in front of John in their Baker Street kitchen and begged him to hurt him.
John remembers how strange Sherlock's eyes had looked at Leinster Gardens. Back then, he'd attributed it to the low light and Sherlock’s agitation.
John slowly unbuttons his fly. As his cock springs free, Sherlock's head jerks greedily forward but the leash holds him back, just out of reach.
“You are so open and wet for me...,” John whispers as he starts to push the toy inside Sherlock. This time it takes only about a minute before it sits in position, stretching Sherlock beautifully.
Sherlock shakes his head. He’s not in the mood to respond. But John forces him to when asking: “Why?”
“Please...” Sherlock whines, turning his head to find John, who watches him with his hands buried in the pockets of his jeans. His eyes are glazed over, however, and there's a prominent bulge forming in his trousers, so he definitely likes what he sees.
“Wow, you are sensitive...” Greg mumbles as he continues to play with the toy, pushing it back inside before pulling it nearly out again. He starts to fuck Sherlock with the massive black plug without remorse, enjoying the spasming of the red hole in front of him. Sherlock can feel the stretch and burn and splutters incoherent profanities like “Fuck! God, yes! Shit, fuck... Oh my god! Fuck me!” to spurn Greg on to give it to him properly.
He has to lie on his belly because his lower back hurts too much, despite John treating the wound with antiseptic ointment and some bandages. He's always hurting these days. Emotions are a complicated, raw, messy thing.
“Don't know yet.” John sits next to him and powers the computer up. The screen flickers as it comes alive.
“You shut it, fucktoy. Who comes inside you is none of your business. You are just a hole. Repeat it: I am just a hole.”
“Can you walk?” He asks. Sherlock takes a few steps towards the door and nods. “Fine. Let's go then.”
“Yes.” He doesn't hesitate as he opens the dressing gown and lets it slide from his shoulders before sinking onto his knees, his eyes never leaving John's.
Sherlock can taste her sweet juices as well as John's more earthy musk as he stiffens his tongue and pushes in. She's tight but yielding, squirming back on his tongue to get it inside her. Sherlock is aware that he is making wet, slurpy, undignified noises as he sucks at her rim, finally pushing his tongue past her sphincter. She cries out in total bliss, chanting “Yes, yes, yes.”
“Well, not today. I just want to play with your hole a little while longer.” John continues to finger Sherlock until he gets thirsty and takes a beer from the fridge. “Try to hold it inside.” John asks as he gets up, and Sherlock does, clenching his sphincter to not let any of John's come escape. After John has sat down again onto his chair he only teases Sherlock's hole with the tip of his forefinger while he sips his beer.
As John starts to push the ribbed device inside him, Sherlock remembers inspecting the toy in the morning – black, made of thick, smooth rubber, about 9 inches in circumference, the tunnel being 2 inches in diameter.
“Well, then, turn around, kneel before the bed, place your chest face-down onto the mattress and hold yourself open.”
As Sherlock is crouching on his hands and knees in the tub John makes him beg again. "What do you want, Sherlock, tell me?"
“I'll be thinking about you every day. My cock rendered useless, any attempt at release futile. It'll be torture. I can see its appeal. For both of us.” Sherlock mumbles, kissing down John's neck until he pulls away. “We shouldn't contact each other if it's not absolutely necessary. It should look like as if we met by chance.”
“You look so fucking hot Sherlock, so open, vulnerable, broken like this.” John bows down and kisses him very softly, stroking his tear-stained face. “Just one more go, then it's over.”
Now, John sets a sensuous pace, the needle sliding in and out of Sherlock's erect penis. It doesn't outright hurt but is still odd. The needle is not as big as the catheter had been, but as it moves back and forth, the friction provides an unfamiliar yet rather thrilling sensation.
The cramps increase. His stomach is starting to make strange, gurgling sounds. Sherlock fears he might have to belch. What might happen then? He knows they won't let him choke to death. Yet at the moment it almost seems like a pleasant alternative to starting the gavage all over again, as John had promised they would. Sherlock doesn't doubt him.
And as if on cue, Mycroft offers, while his come starts to ooze out of Sherlock's still twitching, sore hole: “Now it's your turn, John.”
“I really do. I'll try. I'll do everything...” Sherlock doesn't care if the cabbie can listen to him pleading with John, not now when he has eventually gained John's attention.
John reaches out and tenderly touches Sherlock's face, stroking his thumb over Sherlock's bottom lip until Sherlock parts his lips and sucks the finger into his mouth. He suckles and licks while humping his fist, and his eyes flutter shut as his tongue caresses John's calloused thumb.
“Only that the third person wore a mask and a long coat. She wasn't even sure if it was a man or a woman.”
After wiping Sherlock down with a hot flannel John admires his work. There are no cuts. Sherlock's skin feels soft and smooth. The exposure to air is unfamiliar. Sherlock feels rather vulnerable.
Sherlock sheds the coat and sinks down onto his knees in front of John. He's still touching himself, just a light tug, but it's enough to keep him rock hard.
Somehow, his reassuring words haven't the calming effect he's hoped for, because John's frown only deepens. “You are not going down there anymore.” He states eventually.
Sherlock just gives a curt nod. In the cab, he doesn't let go of John's hand, clamping down on it so hard that John's knuckles hurt. But John doesn't mind.
Sherlock is usually not squeamish. He keeps severed heads and cut-off thumbs in his fridge and cooks eyeballs in the microwave. Nevertheless, being forced upon a dead body is something different. Especially as he's naked – as is the body beneath him, who's also stiff and cold. The faint smell of disinfectant is only partly disguising the sickly-sweet odour of decomposition. Sherlock stares into clouded blue eyes and feels a limp cock pressing against his own groin. When he tries to shift, it is only to discover that his ankles have been cuffed to the legs of the stretcher.
“Now, for me wanting to orgasm...,” Sherlock continues. “I figured out by now that you won't allow me to finish tonight. Instead, you might want to inflict some pain onto my penis. I thought about putting some cloth pins onto my shaft and testicles before dripping hot wax all over it. Would that suit your tastes?”
“You don't get it, do you, Mycroft?” John replies, smiling while putting a hand on Sherlock's nape. “This is not about you. This is about Sherlock. I don't give a toss what you'll do to me. But I won't leave Sherlock to you and your twisted little games.”
Sherlock doesn't close his eyes when the first drops of John's warm piss hit his face. He swallows as much as he can and even tries to push up into the pale warm stream. John lets it flow over Sherlock's heaving chest, quivering abdomen and half-hard groin, and the act is so utterly depraved and dirty that Sherlock brain almost short-circuits as he gives himself over to the sensation of bathing in John's hot piss. He's just there for John's pleasure, his body to be used as John sees fit. And as he accepts this attitude something shifts inside Sherlock. This is suddenly all he wants and needs.
Sherlock waits a moment before answering, taking stock of the state of his body. “My anus still hurts, as do my legs and my stomach. I also have a massive headache.” He squints while looking up at John.
“John, stay where you are. He's got us, don't you see? There's no way out. God, the humiliation, the shame... think about my brother, my parents...” Sherlock flicks back the safety. John slowly turns, extending his hands to placate Sherlock, to calm him down. Behind him, Magnussen makes a strangled noise.
John swallows before very gently easing Sherlock onto his stomach, carefully taking him into his arms, trying to cause as little discomfort as possible.
“Oh, Doctor Watson. Sherlock. Thank god you came! Have you seen the mess downstairs?” Irene's arm just stops halfway into another stroke.
“I think you forgot something. Didn't you say you'll keep me plugged all the time?” Sherlock has his eyes cast down onto the floor as he utters his request.
And despite the searing pain in his crotch Sherlock can feel himself getting hard again. Of course John notices as well and smiles.
Eventually, the two boys remove their hands. Their hard cocks jut out in front of them, leaking. They jerk in excitement as the pig on the floor pulls his cheeks apart and shows off his gaping hole. Thick dollops of lube drip out of the reddened rim and onto the tiled floor.
But Sherlock being Sherlock, he wants more. In his view, John is unnecessarily overcautious in demanding safety procedures and basic supervision. Sherlock explains again and again that he knows what he can handle and firmly declares that he can cope with much more extreme situations; that he actually has to take a risk to be able to let go.
But John can't listen anymore. He screws his eyes shut, shaking his head. “You are not real! I've finally snapped. You’re just a figment of my imagination.”
“Get dressed. Then we'll root for some breakfast.” John hums against Sherlock's inviting, yielding mouth.
“Hold you breath for me, Sherlock.” John says instead. And Sherlock does, clamping his mouth shut, pressing his lips tightly together. John counts to thirty, then allows him to breath again. The next time, he counts to forty-five, fifty, fifty-five. Sherlock's face turns red; a vein on his forehead protrudes and throbs. When permitted, he fervently sucks in air. His head must be swimming.
More come trickles from Sherlock's hole and John lazily starts to push it back in with two fingers, playing with it. He smears it over Sherlock’s violated buttocks until they are glistening with a mixture of blood and come. Sherlock’s load has mostly landed on the carpet, but some has hit his belly and now drips down his balls. John squeezes them gently, and Sherlock roles his hips in response as best he can.
John has to twist it a little to fit all of it in Sherlock’s open mouth. Sherlock can taste Harpic, lube and blood as he starts to suck, moaning around the bristles. It's awful and burns down his throat but he knows that he deserves this. He doesn't dare to imagine what might happen if he accidentally throws up.
As he starts to rock in his bounds, the thorny branches around his body seem to contract, slicing his skin open. He gasps in pain, but John doesn't stop. He only removes his hand when Sherlock's buttocks start to quiver. The chestnuts fall to the ground.
“Someone might have nicked it?” Sherlock mumbles. “Paris is a dangerous place, full of pick-pockets...”
The house is actually a Georgian manor, built in 1743 by one of Sherlock's and Mycroft's wealthy ancestors. Sherlock had curled himself up on the backseat for the duration of the journey, napping, and is only waking as they pull up on the driveway in the early evening. It had all been a bit much. The neurotransmitters searing through his body had made him twitchy. He'd needed to shut down.
To give him something to occupy his gaping mouth with, John remembers the double-dildo he brought with him downstairs yesterday; he gets it, dribbles some honey he's just bought on it, and fucks Sherlock's mouth with it for almost an hour, pushing in deep. There's no resistance as Sherlock's mouth is held open by the braces of the spider gag. He drools even more, his eyes pleading John to stop. But John shushes him and reminds him of his training back in Sussex: “I know that you can take bigger toys, Sherlock. Just relax.” John watches him with dark eyes, a tight smile on his face. This is not so much about getting off but about domination and submission. Sherlock surrenders.
“Believe me, Sherlock, you want to be very clean when meeting Miss Adler. Otherwise she might get angry with you. And it will reflect badly on me if you don't meet her expectations. Everything you lack is my fault. Don't forget that.”
John keeps him like this while preparing dinner, turning to watch him from time to time while chopping vegetables and cooking pasta. He even puts his feet up on Sherlock's back when finally eating.
Down there is a corridor that formerly led towards the kitchen, scullery, coal cellar and pantry. Now, there are half a dozen closed mahogany doors. It is utterly silent.
John is gone for hours. Sherlock watches the hands of the kitchen clock move round and round as he crouches down onto the hard, cold floor. His whole body hurts while his arms and legs fall asleep. Sherlock tries to jiggle his limbs but his movements are restricted by the tight cuffs. He only succeeds in scraping the skin on his wrists, so he ends up just resting his cheek against the iron radiator, falling into some kind of pain-induced trance. The blood dries on his face and his injured eye starts to swell shut. John had hit him in the vicinity of his kidneys, a rib might be broken, and just sitting up and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
“You are making quite a mess down here, you dirty pisswhore.” John tells him, his voice dangerously low. “Look at you, all wet and drenched in smelly piss. You love that, don't you, getting peed on and then fisted hard?”
“Speaking of...” Greg says, his voice hard and unforgiving, “now that the linen are soaked anyway, piss yourself like the dirty slut you are.” As encouragement, John gives Sherlock another hard kick, and this time, he falls onto his side; a long streak of piss squirts out of his arse. Sherlock spreads his legs so that John and Greg get a good look and - quite naturally by now, due to John's training –  urine starts to flow from his soft cock until he's lying in a pool of piss that slowly soaks the sheets. The sensation of piss streaming out front and behind, mingled with the humiliation of being forced to do this in front of other people, makes Sherlock's head spin in a mixture of mortification and arousal.
“Ah, yes, he knows what he needs. Before I plug him again, there'll be a bit of spanking. As a reward. The only form of caress I'll give him.”
To his utter enjoyment, this seems to be exactly what John wants. “Your wish is my command.” He grins, taking his cock in hand and fiercely pumping it while opening his mouth to let saliva drip from his lips onto Sherlock's upturned face.
The evening could have ended with Sherlock on his back on the coffee table, his head dangling from one side while John holds onto his calves, pulled up almost to Sherlock's shoulders to spread him open and reveal his still gaping hole. The spider gag forces his mouth open, and he drools copiously, spit running down his cheeks and into his open eyes as John fucks his face, pushing his cock deep down Sherlock's throat, who is humming in pleasure beneath him.
“Now, let's see about that semen sample.” One of John's gloved hands wraps around Sherlock's soft cock that is hanging from the the table's edge. Two fingers of his other hand push inside Sherlock's gaping rectum and start searching for his prostate. It's rather easy to find as Sherlock is wide open and the small nub very easily accessible. Sherlock's body convulses as John's fingers press against his delicate spot, but gradually his sobs change into lewd moans and gasps. It's nearly too intense as Sherlock proves to be very sensitive but at least this new experience keeps the pain at bay. It's not long before Sherlock's cock fills and stiffens and starts to leak pre-come. John jerks him off efficiently until he removes his hand from Sherlock's shaft to get the second jar.
Sherlock is dimly aware that Moriarty is again filming him on his phone, capturing him violating a dead body.
He returns about two hours later, after a stroll through Regent's Park and a pint down the pub. The flat's dark except for a fire burning in the fireplace. In front of it, John can make out Sherlock's slim silhouette. The flames behind him seem to lick his pale skin, dipping him in flickering orange light. He's naked, kneeling on the hearth rug, holding up his riding crop like an offering.
“Why am I doing all the work, I wonder. Come on, get some of this onto your fingers and fist your cock for me.” Sherlock can't. He violently shakes his head, but suddenly John is standing above him and steps onto his left hand that is scrambling on the floor for purchase. Sherlock jerks up and tries to pull his palm away as John grinds down his heel. He can feel his metacarpal bones being crushed brutally.
Sherlock tries to detach himself from the situation as Moriarty's dry fingers wrap around his cock. He has to escape this ordeal, otherwise he might simply vomit. Suffocating on your own sick does make for a very unattractive corpse, Sherlock reminds himself. Therefore, he retreats.
After a few minutes, however, they stop in front of another metal door, not rusty or derelict, but painted a shiny crimson. A bouncer, dressed all in black with a thick neck and an earpiece, stands guard but after a brief once-over nods at John and Sherlock as if they've passed a silent assessment.
Upon his arrival in the German capital, Sherlock quickly made friends with a group of three girls he met in a cafe in Prenzlauer Berg. They instantly took to the shy, slightly geeky guy with the funny Norwegian accent who seemed nice, a little naïve – and utterly lost. They were all sharing a large flat in Kreuzberg, and it didn't take Sherlock much persuasion to get himself invited over to their place for as long as it took him to find something permanent. He told them that he had graduated last summer and was now on some sort of gap year, trying to find himself while travelling. They nodded in understanding, listening with serious faces, and agreed that this was a very mindful idea before ordering another round of Chai tea with honey.
“Budge up a it.” John goes down on his knees and smears more foam around Sherlock's testicles. He pulls tender skin taught to remove the sparse hair behind Sherlock's ball.
When John empties the first cup into the bucket, Sherlock suddenly registers what's going to happen. He whines both in shock and agony and starts to suck faster, deeper. Gradually, with every cup, the weight of the bucket increases, until its almost half full. Sherlock is sobbing by now, his chest burning. It feels like his nipples are on fire or about to be ripped off his body. His mind is consumed with bright hot pain. His pectorals are pulled taught, stretched almost past endurance, two lobes of pale flesh. He fears the rings might get torn out while he can only whimper around John's fat cock.
“I said, put it down.” John walks over to the bed as Sherlock raises his eyes to his face. He looks almost pleading as he stretches out the hand and offers the gun to John.
“I deserved it... I'm such a pain slut... Thank you, John... You are so kind, so generous... so good to me.” His breathing is ragged, his eyes red-rimmed, yet his cock is rock-hard again as he looks up at John from below heavy lids.
Sherlock lays his head against John's collarbone. John’s arms wrap around him, not sure if he'll ever be able to let go again.
The physical exercise is leaving its mark on the elder Holmes: his dishevelled ginger hair falls into his face, sweat runs down his temples, and a pink flush has spread right down all over his chest. His scarcely freckled shoulders glisten damp as his well-developed thighs muscles drive his cock relentlessly up his little brother's arse.
Sherlock stays very still and only turns to face the opaque glass front while John puts on latex gloves. He can see his reflection clearly, his pale limbs a stark contrast to the black rubber, his mouth forced obscenely open. He shivers a little as John peels the cling film away from the small of his back. It doesn't hurt, but his legs do shake nevertheless. John carefully applies ointment to the skin, then steppes back and admires the sight.
“You know, mother nature is rather generous in providing interesting stimulants. Well, of course you know that. But do you have first hand experience, I wonder? Let's see. I'll be right back.”
It just takes John a minute to get the box from the bedroom. He sets it down next to the table so that Sherlock can see its contents.
John suddenly knows that there is nothing he won't do for Sherlock. Shooting that cabbie had just been the beginning.
“Clean it. Thoroughly.” There's a dark gleam in John's eyes as Sherlock opens his mouth again to get the dildo stuffed back in, this time with its used side.
“You never were just an assignment. I refused initially because I feared that we might end up like this.”
“But Mycroft wouldn't be so easily fooled, would he?” John mouths a kiss just behind Sherlock’s right ear.
“I bet your Daddy would love to bend you over his desk sometimes and just sink his cock into your pink arsehole. To fuck all your disobedience right out of you. Hard and fast, as you deserve it. Did he beat you with his belt when you were younger? No? I bet he wanted to, though. I bet he wanted to grope you and hold you down, shut you up and just take you. The family way, you know.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock is lying across Lestrade's desk in his office at NYS, trousers around his ankles, his shirt shoved up his back, as Greg gives him a good hard spanking with a wooden ruler. Sherlock's flushed dripping cock is trapped between his abdomen and the table top, and as he writhes and squirms he is able to achieve some much needed friction. The big plug John had ordered him to shove up his still red hole this morning sits still firmly in place, grazing his prostate with every stroke to his already bright red arse.
Sally leads them up to the first floor, knocking sharply on a door before pushing it open. It's some kind of morning room, furnished with sofas and chairs, all pushed to the walls, leaving a wide space in the middle. There, on a fluffy white carpet, kneels Kate, naked. In front of her – furious, hair loose, barefoot (with surprisingly tiny stockinged feet), otherwise dressed in a dark red evening gown – is Irene Adler, riding crop in hand.
“You told my colleague what you did at Acri’s party. To be honest, I don’t give a fuck if one poof killed the other. Acri was a dirty faggot as far as I’m concerned, and the world is better off without his lot. But as you don’t mind to engage in certain activities, maybe offering those to me could distract me from performing my duty.” The man grins as he winks and rubs his groin in full view of Sherlock.
Thanks to the drug, Sherlock only feels slight discomfort as a cock enters his anus without proper preparation or lube. Someone starts to fuck him but it doesn't really matter.
“Yes. I went for the more old-fashioned equipment. We should start with that. We can change over to modern appliances later, when he'll be able to properly appreciate their merits. Shall we do it here?”
“Inspector Dimmock, if you'd taken just one close look at those knots even you would have seen that they are slip-knots. He first tied up his ankles, then his hands, using his mouth to pull the knot tight. That's why his hands are bound in front of him. If a second party had been involved, they surely would have bound the hands behind the back. Then he fumbled a bit with the connecting cord, but still managed to fasten it with his mouth. Afterwards, he started to suck the dildo, which he had fixed to the side of his bedside cabinet. Look, it has a sucker on its base. And here, on the furniture, you can still see the round mark where the dildo was attached. But, as he got excited, the cords got entangled, so he couldn't free himself. And he seems to have swallowed the toy too deep. It blocked his windpipe, he panicked – and good night Vienna.”
“This hurts rather badly, I imagine.” John grins wickedly as Sherlock nods weakly. John massages the balm onto Sherlock's cock and the cooling-burning sensation makes Sherlock almost faint. When John eventually removes his hand Sherlock is so grateful he wants to lie down at John's feet and thank him for having mercy.
“Imagine you had tits, too. I could fondle them now. Really big, hard boobs with large nipples I could suck. Tell me you want that. Tell me you want to be my good little girl.”
“Ah, of course, that makes a difference.” Mycroft's smile is cutting, bordering on acerbic. “You know, it's been really insightful talking to you, John, thank you for your input. But I think our guests are waiting; and, I'm afraid, they are not very patient men. They’re probably drunk already, too. Therefore, I'd suggest you get Sherlock down immediately, so we can get the party started. I'm afraid their mood won't be improved if their gratification is delayed any further.”
John's not sure if Sherlock is already healed enough to take his cock, though. He doesn't want to risk tearing him apart again. The doctor in him tells him to wait for a few more days. Yet, he needs friction. He's at least as hard as Sherlock. But he doesn't desire another blow job.
Until Mycroft gets up and circles the rack, pulling Sherlock's head up by his damp hair. Upon encountering his brother's dazed expression Mycroft knows that he's finally got Sherlock exactly where he wanted him.
“Just because I won't beat and fuck you doesn't mean I can't show you your place, Sherlock. There are many other ways to give you what you need.”
The dark-skinned boy reacts quickly. He gathers the come on the tiles up with his hand and pushes it back inside the pig's arse, pushing the prolapsing bowel back. The pig yelps, going very still. His arse must hurt like hell but he also seems excited to get his own come put back inside him like this.
The policeman rounds the table between them and comes to stand in front of Sherlock. Up close, he still smells of the pastrami panini he had for lunch, beer, and sweat. There are dark patches forming under his arms.
Eventually, John returns. He walks slower, which means he's carrying something. Sherlock can hear him put his load down onto the ground next to him. Another item he leans against the tree.
John kisses him gently, standing beneath a thick, solid branch of the chestnut, before he takes Sherlock's left wrist and wraps the smooth hemp rope around it several times. With a skilful toss, John throws the rope over the branch afterwards, pulls it tight and ties its other end around Sherlock's right wrist. Sherlock still has both feet firmly on the ground, approximately twenty inches away from the tree trunk.
“There's Gatorade in the bar over there, and some fruit. I run him a bath.” Mycroft puts his robe back on, but returns to the bed before walking over to the bathroom. “Look after him, John. He needs you.”
“It wasn't that bad, was it?” John chuckles, sounding slightly amused despite still not looking back at Sherlock.
As they leave, Sherlock is trembling both from the cold water and the endorphins rushing through his blood stream. Somehow he knows that the night isn't over yet.
“I knew there was only one chance to escape my brother. I had to die. He can be very persistent, as you might have noticed.” Sherlock smiles a wry smile. John snorts. “But it had to be convincing, in the presence of an independent eyewitness. Well, the easiest way is to stage a suicide. Not too many people involved. I would be in control. But, of course, I needed a motive.”
Sally Donovan is standing behind one door, grinning, her skirt held up, flashing her black knickers. Sherlock remembers sucking her cunt, drinking her warm piss while John watched.
When the boy finally shuffles back, empty and exhausted, Sherlock can't stop to smear his sick all over his skin, massage it in. People tell him he's a filthy whore, a comeslut, a comedump, and he nods and pants. He is. He has debased himself to a degree unfathomable to him before tonight.
Sherlock literally howls when the broad blade hits his left arse cheeks. John alternates, decking each cheek in turns. The spatula leaves delicious marks. It's a bit like pounding raw meat, John thinks.
“Apropos, would you like Doctor Watson to give you a hand?” Mycroft asks in a low voice and Sherlock slowly raises his head. Their pale eyes lock in the mirror before Sherlock's gaze darts back to John, who watches them impassively.
“You want me to go on?” He asks Mycroft, who admires John's work with the knowing look of a true connoisseur. He by now only palming his erection, fondling his balls form time to time. The whisky is long gone.
“I put effort in things worth it.” John says, glancing over at Sherlock. “I know your resources, Mycroft. It's useless to try to run and hide from you.”
“Okay, listen. There are two options for you here. First, you can make me and some others very happy, and then we might let you go and give you and your friend a 24 hour headstart. Or, you continue to be difficult, and I'll see to it that an Interpol warrant asking for two men fitting your and Mr Sacker's description gets processed quickly. What do you think about that?”
This is not a fluffy happy go lucky story.  If you expect just some hot smut, this might not be the fic to deliver this. There are many stories around, however, that do. I kindly refer you over to them if this gets too dark and unhealthy for you.
“That's... well, what can I say, Charles? If, hypothetically, maybe some aspects of those stories might be accurate... could you help me? I'd be very grateful.” Sherlock tilts his head and cants his hips enticingly.
Sherlock pulls the Belstaff tighter around himself in the cab. He didn't dare to take a bus or the tube, as he's still wearing his shirt soaked in Greg's piss. Despite the session in the office at NSY, Sherlock is already hard again. The idea of the cabbie smelling the piss on him, the sheer humiliation of being forced to keep that wet shirt on, is enough to spark hot arousal between his legs. He wants to palm himself but doesn't dare to, hence the driver sees what he's up to on the back seat. Sherlock doesn't trust his coat to hide the evidence of his erection.
“I think I need to examine you thoroughly before we start, to make sure you are up for what I have in mind. Therefore I'll need urine, blood and semen samples: You'll also undergo anal examination. That's an Alan Parks rectal retractor, if you've been wondering. I'll use that to spread you open. Now, take that towel off and let's begin.”
“I bet you are dying to come.” John's smile is almost cruel. Sherlock makes a consenting sound around his cock that has John twitch in his mouth. “Well, tough luck, slut. Not for a while, I'm afraid.”
“Don't come again before you are allowed to.” John reminds him. His gaze moves between the telly and Sherlock wanking himself for his entertainment. He let's Sherlock stir for almost half an hour, until he's sobbing again because his misused cock is by now burning.
“Pour it down my crack.” Sherlock pleads in a soft voice, and John dips the candle and watches mesmerised as white wax runs down Sherlock's cleft, held up only by his tight balls. Sherlock's pink hole twitches as the hot tallow hits it. The sutures have dissolved, leaving his anus tight and almost virginal again. It's so beautiful that John can’t suppress a moan, kneading Sherlock's arse cheek with his right hand, listening to Sherlock humming with arousal, his hips bucking forward into thin air as his wax-coated cock seeks some friction.
“No, don't...” The man gasps, and for a split second, John thinks he's afraid of him. But those grey eyes linger on a spot above John's shoulder. It might be a cheap trick, but John looks around anyway. What he sees lets him freeze in shock.
“What happened to you? You look like you got run over by a bus.” Dimmock asks as Sherlock sweeps inside a luxurious flat in Westminster barely half an hour later.
Before he lies down into the shallow ditch, John rips his soaked t-shirt off his upper body. The bright light catches on his nipple piercings, making them sparkle and shine. John shoves the soiled fabric into Sherlock's mouth before he makes a small gesture with his head, indicating for Sherlock to get into position. Sherlock is so grateful he feels he might start crying.
“When you wake up, you can tell me about this.” He gestures vaguely at the writing on the walls. Now that he’s taking a closer look, it seems to be one sentence repeated over and over again.
John watches his bulbous cock move beneath the thin sheath of tissue and muscles that forms Sherlock's long, white throat while he fucks that willing mouth. Sherlock makes the most delicious noises, moaning around the hot flesh, the sounds vibrating through the tender nerve endings in John's shaft, going straight to his balls already preparing a huge load of come to flood Sherlock's body with.
Sherlock inhales sharply. “You drowned him and made me watch. To teach me that caring was not an advantage.”
The door is slightly ajar, allowing John to enter silently. He can hear voices and tries to keep quiet as not to attract attention.
John has the presence of mind to look for his underwear and puts it back on. As Sherlock still retches John finally has mercy with him and gets him a glass of water from the kitchen. Sherlock takes it with trembling fingers and gulps it down almost too fast.
As it's already afternoon, John opens the wine, sloshes half of it into a pan and throws the chicken leftover into it as well before heating it. From what's left in the bottle, he pours himself a generous glass that he empties while stirring the meat. On his empty stomach he soon starts to feel a little tipsy. He takes it as his reward for dragging his body out of their warm bend. When the alcohol in the pan has been reduced to a thick gravy, he cuts the strawberries in half, puts them in a bowl and pours the yoghurt over it.
The Inspector looks not the slightest bit taken aback by Sherlock's frankness. “I think we should talk to you separately.” She states before leaving the room.
“Mycroft wants to destroy you and presumably me as well.” Sherlock begins. “Therefore, we have to beat him to it.”
He knows that Sherlock needs effective pain relieve, but he has to stay barely functioning as well. So he can't be given anything that would make him drowsy. No opiates, just ibuprofen. The hardest part comes when Sherlock kneels on the tiled floor, arse in the air, his head braced on his forearms. As John spreads his cheeks, he can't stop cursing under his breath. Those fucking bastards! At least he injects a local anaesthetic before stitching Sherlock up.
John grabs a fistful of damp curls and brutally jerks Sherlock's head up, slapping his face again and again while hissing: “It's your own fault, you know that, don't you, Sherlock? Your own damn fault. Only your fault.”
When John eventually goes to bed that night, Sherlock has rolled up on the rug on his side and is breathing evenly. His pale body is bruised and covered in bandages, his hole stuffed and his face dirty. He looks used and squalid but still ethereal and beautiful. John can't wait to continue to break him. Such a challenge; such a reward.
“Tell me what's happening, Sherlock.” John asks from behind the small camera. His own cock is throbbing, in desperate need to be touched.
Mycroft doesn't slow down as he climaxes, but rides it out, shooting his thick load up Sherlock's arse, who follows suit, not caring if he's allowed to. His come hits the Persian carpet, mixing with his other bodily fluids that have already stained the expensive rug. No punishment his brother could come up with could have stopped Sherlock, but he's willing to accept whatever Mycroft has in store for him to make up for his offence. Because he's sure that his ordeal has just begun.
“Shush, it's ok.” John is suddenly back, squatting down next to Sherlock's face, brushing his damp hair from his brow. “Here, this will help.”
John is still hugging Sherlock tight when he can hear Molly finally get up and move around. She takes a strange look at the corpse lying upon the gurney Sherlock is still shackled to before pulling the sheet back over the body.
Sherlock, spread open, immobilised, strapped to the gynaecological chair, looks like a perfect rubber doll, his arms, legs and torso wrapped in shiny black latex, his full lips moaning around the large black rubber ball in his mouth. He loves to be taken like this, his body used and modified to comply with every demand of his brother.
When he's got his breath back, John quickly gets up and takes the bowl from Sherlock's clenched fingers.
His humiliation develops into a panic when he hears Mrs Hudson shuffle around downstairs. Tears of despair dwell up in his eyes as the doorbell rings – but it’s just a delivery for their landlady, not for them. And thank god it’s not a client either.
“You wouldn't...” Mycroft begins but then falls silence as he becomes aware of the look on John's face.
John pulls the heavy door open and motions for Sherlock to step inside. The room is bright, square, about a hundred feet long and nearly as wide. Floor, walls and ceiling are tiled white, as are some concrete benches in the middle. At one side, a trough runs the whole length of the wall, with a drain at the far end. The other side is partially lined with white china urinals. At the back, there are a few larger than usual cubicles, some with doors, some without. It smells of sweat, piss and disinfectant.
John sighs. “He said nothing, Mycroft. He wasn't...”, John crosses his arms and looks away. “He was in severe shock, I'd say. He had shut down. Completely.”
John looks in to him when he returns from the shops. Sherlock is staring up at him hungrily, spit covering half his face, the obscenely glistening coating making him appear even more debauched and helpless. Sherlock is moaning softly, gyrating his hips, his leaking, angry red cock head protruding from the filthy sheets. John has succeeded to reduce Sherlock to a wanton mess, and it's just beautiful.
It takes about five minutes until Sherlock is able to gulp down some water. The colour of his face is slowly returning to normal.
Sherlock tries to stay very still and not to twitch a muscle as John twines the spiked metal ribbon around him, from his ankles up to his neck. John doesn't wrap him too tightly, but the small thorns sting his abused body nonetheless. Some spikes pierce his skin and blood starts to trickle down his limbs in thin rivulets.
Soon, Sherlock looks like carnage: blood is running down his arm, his neck, over his ribcage and his hips; his mouth and cock are smeared a vivid crimson. A copper tang fills the room. And suddenly, it's too much. John is back in the dim, dilapidated corridor at Leinster Gardens and can actually smell the gunpowder as he remembers staring into Sherlock's unblinking, dead eyes. The iron tastes in his mouth makes John retch as the heady scent fills his nostrils. He stills, lowering the knife, and shakes his head as he tries to focus on the warm, breathing body beneath him. Sherlock's gaze isn't dead and broken, just dazed as John's name falls from his bloodied lips.
Sherlock quickly undoes his belt and toes his shoes off, setting his stockinged feet into the cooling puddle of piss on the floor. As his jeans slide down they get thoroughly drenched as well. Sherlock steps out of the pile of wet fabric, now just in socks, a tight with t-shirt and the silver cock cage he's been forced to wear for two weeks.
“Jesus, Sherlock...” John trails off, his voice hoarse, his throat tight. He cards his left hand through his silver-blond hair. “Ginger? Seriously?”
Eventually, they both come all over his face, coating him in thick white goo. It gets in his hair and burns in his eyes but of course he's not allowed to wipe it off.
“John, please, I need it, please, just take another one!” Sherlock doesn't care he's begging like a whore, he desperately needs to be filled up again.
The story turns rather dark as Sherlock is taken hostage by Moriarty and subjected to his twisted fantasies.
“So you found what I wanted you to get. Wow, this looks huge. Must have been fun pushing that up your slutty hole.” John admires Sherlock's dedication. It would have taken him a while to get used to such a massive toy. Sherlock is still tight like the virgin he was until a few months back, and two weeks of forced abstinence surely have done nothing to help prepare his body for such a gigantic intrusion. John simply has to reach out and brush his fingers over the broad rubber rim protruding form Sherlock's arse hole.
Again, very interesting. But promising as well? Worth of Mycroft's precious time? Or was he chasing ghosts as Greg had dared to imply only a few days ago?
Sherlock – glad to have been told what to do but still wondering what might be in John's bag – sets to work with shaking hands and nearly drops an Erlenmeyer flask in the process. John stands by and watches patiently until the table is cleared.
The man grabs the dog's collar and pulls him back. The big animal is stubborn and tries to resist the effort, slobbering all over Sherlock's back, paws scratching abused skin, the stiff tail upright in the air. Its owner has to haul quite forcibly. Sherlock's shrill groan rings loud in the otherwise silent room and tells John more than he's wanted to know. Apparently, the dog had already entered Sherlock. Time to get him away from here as fast as possible.
Sherlock's hole is completely wrecked and bleeding. The prolapse is bright red and looks raw and sore. The rectal mucosa is torn by the look of it. John assumes deep lacerations to the muscles around Sherlock's sphincter but he has to check under better light to be sure.
As they part, Sherlock throws back his head, opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue. John catches on swiftly and pours hot wax over Sherlock's twitching, wet tongue. He grunts and gurgles as the scalding liquid makes contact with his tender organ.
John gets to his feet vigorously. “I understand that you are a bit worried by Sherlock's current state. But I'm not discussing our relationship with you. He's an adult. That's between him and me. It's none of your business. I'm sorry. We wanted to breach the subject to you a bit more delicately. Now, excuse me, please. I have to look after Sherlock.”
In another room, a man has been tied down onto one of the velvety upholstered benches and is being flogged with a cane, groaning into his ball gag. His arse and back are already covered in bright red welts, and Sherlock feels his rebellious cock jerk again. Another man has been suspended from one of the huge crystal chandeliers dangling from the stucco ceiling. His feet don't reach the floor as he's viciously whipped with a bull leash. Blood is already dripping form his abused body, yet his cock is hard and leaking. As he wasn't offered the courtesy of a gag his screams fill the room, echoing from the painted walls. This, however, seems to do a lot for his spectators who've gathered around the display on previously arranged chairs, either bouncing someone in their lap or having a willing participant crouch between their legs, setting their mouths to good work.
Sherlock had begun. Rather circumspect, as if to test the waters, he'd told John that he found the idea of piss play extremely arousing. As a chemist, he could ensure John that urine usually was mostly sterile, and, especially if the person emanating it had been drinking a lot, almost tasteless.
“Yes.” John nods in response, holding the bloodied knife in front of Sherlock's pale face, the blade dripping with his blood. Sherlock's eyes are glazed over, but he smiles despite the pain distorting his features.
“You know what's coming for you now, don't you?” John asks after a while, and Sherlock blinks as an answer. Oh, yes.
John does as he's told and positions himself a little to the left behind Sherlock, arranging an expensive digital camera on a tripod, pulling the scene in front of him into focus.
Now it's Sherlock's turn to sigh in exasperation. “We don't have time, John.” He raises his head in defiance. “We have to stand united against my brother, or we won't stand a chance.”
When black dots start to dance before Sherlock's eyes, the hand is eventually removed. Sherlock sucks in oxygen, but as Moriarty is apparently still waiting for an answer, he hurries to say while still spluttering: “Yes.”
Sherlock tries to concentrate on the task, but the vibrator is still buzzing inside his rectum, distractingly, making his cock leak copiously. Too much sensory input he can't block out; he's totally helpless. He admits defeat, tilts his head back and lets Mycroft shovel porridge down his aching throat.
Ninety minutes after being left alone, Sherlock gives up. He's not even crying anymore. The ache is making him dizzy. His head is pounding. His bowels feel like they are about to explode. He doesn't care. He just wants this to end. Sitting in a pool of his own shit actually sounds like heaven right now. As does the procedure starting all over again, because it would give him a few minutes of rest, of freedom from pain. Sherlock silently begs for something, anything, to end this torture.
John pulled out the wooden chair and spun it around so its back was against the desk and then sat down in it, facing away from Sherlock. "Hand me a pillow, would you?" Sherlock did, and John put it on the desk so he could rest his forehead on it, letting his arms fall loosely to the sides of his body. "How's this?"
Dad pulled the blanket off his chair and tossed it to Sherlock, then pushed the chair out of the way so there would be more space on the floor. "Go on, Rosie," he said, and nodded towards the fire, then crossed the room to retrieve the tray of drinks.
“Relax.” There was nothing relaxed about the way Mycroft said the word, and Sherlock wasn’t about to follow his command. Instead he got his coat and put it on, then opened the front door so he would hear the helicopter as it approached.
The routine of making the tea helped John collect himself, and as they sat together at the kitchen table with the plate of biscuits and teapot between them, he could see that the mere act of eating and drinking was helping Sherlock cope, as well.
"What are you—" John stopped himself. It was clear what Sherlock was doing, and they would need a place for the baby to sleep.
I combined two prompts for this ficlet both because I anticipate not having a lot of time to write this coming week and may have to skip a day, and also because I had an idea to use the next two prompts: Shepherd (um, that's Rosie) and Joy (Sherlock, for a moment, at least).
Sherlock let himself be manhandled until John could move his arms enough to push them both away from the building. Mycroft joined them at the edge of the police cordon, directing the officers to set up their barriers further down the street, so none of the onlookers could get too close to them. Leon fetched more chairs and a table from in front of Speedy's, then led Mrs. Hudson and Stone off in search of cleaner air to breathe while they waited for a report from the fire brigade.
Sherlock raised his head, hoping no more than a few seconds had passed. John was on his feet now, in front of him, and still smiling. John was smiling at him, with his shirt off and his shoulders slightly glistening with oil as he stood in the middle of their flat. He was smiling at him, and waiting for an answer.
A small smile played at Sherlock's lips, and John counted it as a win—he'd successfully distracted him from worrying for a least a little while. John wasn't especially concerned about keeping his toe muscles limber, but if it gave Sherlock something to do and let John have a chance to decompress, he wasn't going to stop it. Except after only a minute or two, Sherlock began to talk again.
"Blend into all grey, these days." John pushed a stray lock off his forehead before returning his attention to his food.
"Because I would really appreciate the sex right now," John continued. "It's been a very rough few days and I know it's only going to get worse and I thought this little bit of fun would be a good release. But if you don't want to—"
He'd done plenty of things that weren't right, but he didn't need Eurus to hear his confession about any of that. God knew he'd already told her enough while she was pretending to be his therapist.
Mycroft wasn't paying much attention to the video coming out of Sherrinford. His parents were viewing it, of course, from the comfort of their living room, but Mycroft was at work and didn't actually care about Sherlock and Eurus's little musical bonding sessions, as long as Eurus was secure in her cell. He was only watching because he planned to be too busy to visit Mummy and Daddy for Christmas and Mummy would be less angry with him if he pointed out that he had just seen them a few weeks earlier, albeit virtually.
"Yeah. I didn't mean to—" John exhaled, then pressed his lips thin. Next to him, Stone gave a single, sharp bark that stretched into a whine. John fumbled the dog's lead from his wrist and held it out to Sherlock. "Here. Take him."
"Yes, it is." Sherlock stood up from the sofa and began to pace. "Have your team check the woman's make-up. I'll wager that Eurus took enough that she'll be able to change her appearance significantly. You might have passed her on the street on your way here without even noticing. She's too good for you to catch her, brother dear."
"Letting us?" Sherlock stood up, but before he could step around or over the coffee table, John's hand clamped down on his wrist. Sherlock curled his hand into a fist but didn't try to pull away.
"Mm. That's a good question." Sherlock looked over at John, and for a moment John thought he was trying to pass the question off to him, but then he continued. "I suppose we use hearts because when you love someone, it makes a warm feeling inside your chest." He dropped his gaze from John. "And that's where your heart is," he added, and poked Rosie in the chest with one finger.
Sherlock stopped pacing long enough to look at Mycroft, who returned his gaze but didn't say anything. After a moment, Sherlock cleared his throat. "Mummy, I hope I speak for all of us when I say I'm sorry for everything you've suffered because of us. I think we're all trying to do better now."
"Staying?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose and John sighed. At least he knew Sherlock's parents wouldn't be expecting to stay at Baker Street—Mycroft had much more space to host them. But John knew it would be up to him to make plans to entertain them and Rosie over the coming weekend.
"Yes, oh fuck yes," John said, and finally there was a tone to his voice he hadn't heard in weeks - the smallest hint of happiness.
Sherlock looked at him and there was a softness in his eyes that John had rarely seen. "I won't change my mind," he said, and he seemed completely sober now as he pushed himself out of his chair.
Sherlock passed the bottle to John and resumed his gentle cleaning. John tried to will himself not to react because he didn't want to seem insatiable, desperate, or anything else for that matter. He took a deep breath and squirted some soap into his palm. With his other hand he touched Sherlock's shoulder, wanting confirmation that it was ok to touch him back.
When they were alone again, when Sherlock had made tea and John felt a little calmer, he knew they had to talk about it. But he still didn't want to.
"Mm-hmm." Sherlock let the vocalisation rumble through closed lips, barely audible. John leaned forward again and ghosted his lips along his cock before taking him fully into his mouth. Sherlock let his eyes fall shut. Maybe he should have sat in Lestrade's chair, so he'd be able to lean back more.
Rosie danced on the stoop with Mr. Bear in her arms as John unlocked the door to the building, and Mrs. Hudson emerged from her flat before they were both all the way inside. Rosie dropped the stuffed bear and ran to give her a hug.
"Then I thought, perhaps Greg and Molly would be willing to take him for the two weeks—they like him, but I don't know if their cats would appreciate it. Though I doubt Stone would know enough to chase a cat. He would also love it if we sent him to the country and he got to spend the time at Mummy and Daddy's, but again, how do we be sure he's not carrying germs to them? I don't want my dog to accidentally kill my parents, John."
"Yes, you are. You're not even—" John dropped his head to give him a quick swirl of his tongue and then exchanged his mouth for his hand once more.
Sherlock tensed at the memory and John threaded his left hand into his hair, the tips of his fingers coming to rest on his temple. "No, I understand why you'd want a cigarette today. It's been a rough week. I'm not sticking my tongue in your mouth right now or anything, but I understand. And I'm glad you're not trying to hide it from me."
Sherlock took two running strides across the room, catching himself on the back of the chair at the desk, his own mobile clattering to the floor. He leaned forward towards the phone. "Moriarty."
It wasn't the first time that Sherlock had silently held and comforted him. Wasn't the second time either. There'd been a small handful of other occasions in the past two years when he'd found himself overwhelmed by grief and the difficulty of raising Rosie on his own, and Sherlock had been there for him each time.
"Do you?" Eurus placed her violin on the floor of her cell and put both hands on the glass, reaching towards him. The glass stayed firmly in place between them. "Something has changed, hasn't it? It's changed for you, and you've seen it in him, but you're still afraid to act on it."
He hadn't realised John didn't have a full memory of what had happened. They'd never talked about it in detail, and he didn't particularly want to have that conversation now. "Let's go home."
When John had finished cleaning them both up, he crossed the room to toss the used tissues into the bin and then picked up his clothes and started to get dressed.
"Hey." John's hand was on the back of his neck, a few degrees cooler than his own skin. Sherlock leaned automatically into the touch, then glanced around the flat. Enough time had passed that Mrs. Hudson was gone and Stone was asleep on the sofa. "How's it going?"
Rosie had to agree. She kissed and hugged both him and Sherlock and headed upstairs to her room, hoping that everything would be all worked out by the morning.
Sherlock was once more sitting calmly in his armchair, all traces of the panic he'd exhibited a few moments ago seemingly gone. He'd pulled the cot up close next to him, and Eve lay on her back in it, quiet at the moment but waving her arms and legs erratically in the air.
"To make you stop worrying. You know how you always say 'there's always something' that you overlook and get wrong? That's what this is." He leaned back on the sofa and draped an arm around Sherlock's shoulders. "And anyway, even if you had thought about the bedrooms being upstairs, I still would've refused to let you bring my braces and crutches and we'd still be sleeping here on this sofa."
“Oh, he can’t hear you, not now. I’m not sure when he’ll wake up. I think he will, though. At least, I’m pretty sure he will. He doesn’t look dead.”
Mrs. Hudson's brow furrowed. "You were napping upstairs? Usually you just pass out on the sofa down here."
"Not a lot, really. I just kept an eye on the two of you and gave a weekly report, but almost everything you did was in the papers already anyway."
All three of them stared at Eve, and her cry of distress trailed off into a low whimper. "How could she do this?" Mycroft asked.
Eurus pushed her hair back behind her ears and gave him a smile he had no idea how to interpret. "I'm all for you wearing gloves, Dr. Watson. It's very professional of you. But I am clean, you should know. Well, I'm a bit filthy at the moment, but you know what I mean."
"I don't know," Sherlock said. "And I can't check because I'm not allowed to put weight on my ankle."
The reporter must have believed that the police were more likely to answer her questions, because she turned her attention to them. Sherlock hoped Lestrade and Donovan arrived soon—they deserved to have to put up with her inane questions after interrupting him and John yesterday at the Yard.
“My, such protest. It won’t hurt but a bit. Or, actually, it won’t hurt at all, will it?” Moriarty sprang forward and plunged the syringe into John’s thigh, depressing the plunger and leaping back immediately.
John decided he didn't have time for a lesson on colours, especially given that she didn't actually own any green socks, as far as he recalled. He pulled two complete outfit changes and a nightgown from her drawers and added them to her overnight bag, then squatted on the floor to help her put on the socks. "Where are your shoes?"
For a brief moment Sherlock thought John meant their dalliance in Lestrade's office had made his arms sore, then he remembered what else they'd done that day. "Oh, from the crutches this morning?"
"You did no such thing." John slid off the bed and crouched down to look beneath the bed—the box had fallen against the wall at some point in the last few years. "You've never tidied anything up here in your life."
"No. You stay here," John commanded. "We are going to help you, just give us a minute. Sherlock." John pointed to one of the chairs at the desk.
"Oh." Sherlock straightened up and turned towards John. "Erm. Rosie, do you know which basket they went in?"
"Yeah, that is a good question." John felt the tension he'd been carrying all day return to his shoulders. "Maybe—"
"No. The guard outside will try to stop me. I'll tell him I'm just going down to the café. He'll let me go, because he was ordered to watch this room, not me. Then I'll call the guard and tell him I think I've spotted Moriarty lurking around downstairs and he'll come running to help me. Mycroft has three more guards by the entrances to the building. Most likely they'll be dispatched to assist, but it won't matter, because we aren't leaving through the main entrances."
"You—" Sherlock paused. It wasn't really John's fault he'd stopped the meds so suddenly last year, nor was it his fault he'd needed to take them in the first place, though he'd never admitted it to anyone else before. He cleared his throat. "John. There is a not-insignificant possibility that I have needed to be on antidepressants since long before I met you."
Moriarty threw his head back and laughed at that, then jumped forward, off the ledge, landing lightly on his feet in front of Sherlock. He moved closer, sliding more than walking. Sherlock stepped to the side, away from the door, and they turned as a unit, mirroring one another, until they stood a double body's length apart, with the door roughly six metres to Sherlock's left and the edge of the roof yawning into open sky on his right.
"Of course," Sherlock said. "I'm not—" Before he could finish, he was interrupted by his phone once again, the sound doubled this time, as Mycroft's phone went off at the same time.
"Oh, hang on. Her water bottle." Molly left the kitchen and returned a moment later, holding a metal bottle decorated with anatomically impossible puppies in one hand. "Oh, and take this, too, Sherlock. Hopefully John won't mind the scent." She held out another, smaller bottle, made of translucent brown plastic, just slightly larger than her hand.
As he reached 221, the door opened and Sherlock stepped outside. "John! Just in time. Give me the keys to the car so I don't need to take a cab."
"Mummy!" the girl shouted, the word clearer than anything else she'd said, and waved one arm in the general direction of the house, nearly swatting Sherlock in the face with the motion.
"Oh, Sherlock. I do hope you know what you're doing," she said as he ushered her out of the flat and closed the door behind her.
Sherlock's hand stuttered for a split-second, and John stroked slowly across the tight flesh beneath his cock. He stretched to kiss his mouth once more, and Sherlock's head rocked back into the pillow, letting out a long, slow groan. Beneath him, Sherlock's hand stilled, and John whispered, "Yes," as Sherlock bit off a small cry. A moment later, his whole body stiffened as his cock spilled over his hand, hitting John's stomach and covering Sherlock's own.
As if on cue, they heard a squeal come from down the hall. John would have to remember to dig out Rosie's old baby monitor, unless Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Holmes came back from the shops with a new one.
She waved a hand. "Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. Well, unless I need to get revenge on you again." She laughed, but Sherlock could see that she didn't have any ill intent behind her words, which was something of a relief, at least. "So, this must John and Mary's little one?"
She kept up her smile, but he caught a glimpse of fear beneath it. She was a good actress—the smile looked real.
Sherlock abandoned his previous tactic and stretched out on the sofa, putting his back to the room and to John and to everything he didn't want to talk about.
"We'll need to get a different duvet cover, though." Sherlock lifted himself up enough so he could straddle John and shed his dressing gown. "This beige is terrible and we'll have it stained inside of a week."
"No." The tip of John's tongue darted out from between his lips, but he didn't otherwise move, just stared at Sherlock, waiting.
Sherlock thought it unlikely, but didn't know what else they could do besides sit and wait for Moriarty's next move. Which was infuriating. He motioned to John that they were leaving, and John followed him out of the office. At least this time he didn't stop to talk to every person he saw on the way.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, then whistled to call Stone and the dog came immediately to his side. He grabbed his lead from its hook in the living room and coaxed him into the hall and down the stairs. Stone was used to taking the lift, since John normally was the one to walk him, but once he realised that Sherlock wanted to take him out, he ran to follow him.
"Nope. This is it. I hope Rosie doesn't mind, but I wanted her to know she has a whole family who supports her."
Sherlock settled back on the sofa, turning once more to the beginning of the paper so he could read some of the more lurid articles. No interesting murders, but that was fine, since he had no intention of appearing at any crime scenes until his ankle healed.
John closed the door behind Molly and turned back to Sherlock and the glider. "How did Eurus order this, anyway? Did she steal your bank card? Or mine?" He reached for his wallet, which was safely tucked in his back pocket—she couldn't have taken his card without him noticing, as she had with his phone. Could she have?
"I did wake you up. You told me you would never go gluten-free and then you tried to take off your socks."
He put his tea back down and plucked the paper from her hands, deducing that the quickest way to get her to stop bothering him would be to humor her. "What am I looking for?"
John pushed the dog out of the way so he could get into the flat, then glanced at his watch. "Er, I really need to take him out. He's been waiting a couple of hours. You want to come with us?"
Once he was sure John was following him, Sherlock led everyone out of the building, into the smoky haze of the street outside. The girl in his arms immediately began to cough. He hurried past their own front door and the next one, stopping at the edge of the pavement, where the crowd of onlookers had grown. He set the girl down on the ground and she immediately raced around him to grab at her mother's legs. The mother started to say something to him—
"It's a Nerf gun, John. It didn't occur to me that you might be the type to object to your child shooting foam bullets."
"No! There's no way." He didn't have to think too hard about it, even if she had disguised herself. "I haven't slept with a woman since Mary!"
Sherlock listened to him phone in an order, expecting the lecture to begin as soon as he was done, but instead John made another phone call, this time to one of the other players on his basketball team. "Hey, Alex. I'm not going to be at practice tonight. Not sure if I'll be at the next game, either, but I'll let you know before then."
The kitchen was worse than the living room. He'd left some empty test tubes lying on his chemistry bench and they'd all rolled onto the floor, leaving shards of glass that crunched beneath his feet. He tried to step around the worst of the mess, and saw that the tomato plant was also upended on the floor. Mycroft must have moved it from the table to the worktop again, and the force of the smoke grenade exploding had knocked it over. He set the laptops on the table and bent to pick up the pot, trying to scoop the loose dirt back into it, but the main stalk of the plant had broken and seemed beyond repair. He set the pot in the sink and ran a bit of cool water into it, just in case it was still capable of recovering. Perhaps the fresh air coming in through the window would help.
“Any shirt will do. Just grab one.” John lifted the baby and held her close to his chest, stepping towards Sherlock as he rummaged through a stack of shirts. “Hey, since when are you a U2 fan?”
He had just finished manoeuvring the fridge back into its spot against the wall when Mycroft barged into the kitchen, his phone still pressed to his ear. “Get out here, Sherlock! Now!”
John sighed and stepped around the bed to the bathroom door. The frosted glass was steamed, making it even harder to see through than it normally was, but he could still hear the water running. He rapped on the door, loud enough to be heard over the water, but she didn't reply. "Eurus?" he called, after a second knock also produced no answer. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was still sitting with Eve but now held himself tense, as if ready to spring to his feet. John swallowed and turned back to the door. "Eurus, are you all right? I'm opening the door now, please answer me."
"I would get the hang of it after two or three times. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube, I'm sure."
"Yes, of course." Sherlock could feel laughter bubbling in his own chest. He looked at Moriarty's corpse one more time.
"It was the least I could do," Mrs. Hudson said. "You'll let me know if you need anything else, won't you?"
He dropped the last box of clothes in the corner of the bedroom with a grunt of relief. The boxes hadn't seemed that heavy when he'd packed them up. He shook out his arms and walked into the living room just as Sherlock came back downstairs into the flat.
John glanced at Sherlock, tongue pushing out hesitantly between his lips. "How long do you think we'll be up here?
Sherlock sighed and hopped off the desk. His trousers slid lower as he moved and he bent to pull them up before turning to face Lestrade and Donovan. Neither of them had backed away or turned around; he was quite certain Donovan had been eyeing him up. He met her gaze. "Like what you saw?"
John ran his finger along the mustard knife and then licked it off, staring at him, but Sherlock didn't let himself be distracted.
John watched him go, appreciating both the view as Sherlock walked away and how easily he had fallen into the role of tending to Eve. He was going to be a good father, as long as he could keep himself clean, and John would do everything he could to help him with that. He finished off his tea, took one more small biscuit and then got up to clear the dishes they had used. He'd make sure they ate something better for dinner, at least.
"Hm." Sherlock sniffed. "I can't imagine why Mrs. Hudson would have installed such a light in her building." He went back out into the living room while John fussed over the plant some more. Stone followed him and Sherlock bent to scratch his head with one hand while he shuffled through the post that John had brought in. Most of it could go straight into the recycling pile, but he pulled out a few pieces for John to deal with: some bills, a cheque from a case they'd had last month, a couple of letters from potential clients that probably weren't worth his time. He could always tell how interesting a case was by the envelope in which it arrived. Like this one at the bottom of the stack. He lifted it from the table. High-quality, heavyweight paper addressed by a left-handed male who was younger than the usual sort who preferred using the post to sending email. But this letter had no postmark; it had been hand-delivered.
"Sorry." John wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, prompting Sherlock to dig in his pocket for a handkerchief, which John accepted with another apology.
"Maybe I'll wait down here while you go up. Might be something you can solve quickly, and it won't be worth it to—" John waved his hand towards the braces, quirking his lip.
"Sorry." John glanced back out into the office, then shut the door behind him and came closer to the desk. "Anything I can do to help?"
"She will be found and taken into custody again, Sherlock. With or without your assistance." Mycroft let out a small sigh. "And while I have yet to be convinced of the wisdom of leaving an infant here in this flat, I do admit that it is the easiest option for the present time. Do not take this to mean that I approve of anything you have done in the last 24 hours."
Mycroft blinked once at him. "You said I could borrow it. Anthea and I received word that our offices were clear of any recording devices, so we elected to go back to work there. Our computers are still being swept for bugs, so I felt it prudent to continue to use yours. You should be happy that I rescued it from your flat."
"You might want to get underneath the covers. And, I don't know, brush your teeth or something." John flicked his fingers at one of Sherlock's bare feet and then gave his ankle a squeeze.
"Yeah, but it's fun. And we don't always have enough players to practice with two full teams, especially on Friday nights."
John followed him out into the living room, then had to fight off a sudden, ridiculous urge to lean over and kiss him goodbye before he left. Instead, he grabbed his coat from the chair by the door and hurried out of the flat.
Sherlock's right hand went to his flies briefly before he pulled it back, folding his hands together at his waist.
Sherlock lingered for a moment longer, giving John time to get downstairs without him. When he finally judged it safe to follow, he couldn't stop himself from glancing into John's bedroom as he passed it by on his way to the staircase. They'd separated the space up here over a year ago, when Rosie had moved from a cot to a regular bed. At the time, Sherlock had entertained an elaborate fantasy of confessing that his feelings for John went far beyond friendship and suggesting that John did not need to continue to sleep alone upstairs. He could sense that fantasy trying to make a resurgence now, prompted of course by that brief, brilliant kiss, but he squashed it down. There was no sense in having a dream that couldn't come true.
"Mm-hmm." The memory of the plug the tail was attached to was strong enough that John could practically feel it right now. He squirmed against his chair. "Let's go. Bedroom. Right now."
"Yeah, yeah." John cut him off. "I helped out with a few deliveries. But if you have someone in your flat who's about to give birth, you need to get them to hospital."
As he followed John to the lift, Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket again. Maybe it was time to let Mycroft play his favourite role of protective big brother and implement a few new security measures. He and John could handle themselves, but if the game had changed, then Mrs. Hudson, his parents, Molly, anyone he knew could be a target now.
"Tragic," Sherlock said, and made a mental note to have Mycroft check on the safety of any reporters who had covered the Moriarty story in the past week.
Sherlock couldn't resist any longer. He put his right hand out, touching John's bare shoulder, and pretended he was testing the position. John's skin was cool and smooth, the muscles beneath it knotted with palpable tension. He cleared his throat. "Ah, it's fine. You're at a good height for me. If you're comfortable."
"Missed me?" John repeated, keeping his voice low. "How could you miss what we've never had before?"
"Light a fire? I thought that was your job?" Sherlock said with a grin. "I left Mrs Hudson dealing with the engineers, I have no idea what happened after the pipe exploded in the bathroom."
John shook his head. "No, no, I promised myself I would do this... us. This stuff, I would do it sober. I need you to know I'm serious. Completely serious about you. About us."
, he'd said. And yet, he knew - he knew he was lying to them all. John walked back home slowly, avoiding the short cuts, reliving all the times he had denied his affection for his friend, needing as much rehearsal time as he could get before this conversation that he knew needed to happen.
Sherlock nodded, but he seemed nervous, wholly unlike himself. Even so, he grinned down at John and slowly lowered onto his knees in front of John's chair. John slipped off until they were on a level again, one hand still holding to Sherlock's waist as they knelt there together, his other reaching for Sherlock's face, cupping his jaw, letting his thumb brush Sherlock's lower lip. He was transfixed, being this close to his fantasy, touching, feeling Sherlock's warm body beneath the sheet, the light stubble on his cheek.
Sherlock didn't look entirely convinced. "So, we'll stick to a drink at home? I think that's best, don't you?"
"Oh, years," she agreed with a wave of her hand. "And he has never once been affected by anything like he has by you."
John frowned, lifted up on an elbow and studied him more closely. "You did," he said. "I didn't move."
John finally drew back and Sherlock was the one to stare now, they were in public and John had never done anything so brazen before. Mind you, Sherlock was the one who had kissed him first, he should have expected it really. He smiled as John seemed to come to his senses and apologised.
"It's already too much," John gasped, but he did want more... so much more because he was greedy, he was ungrateful. "Please-"
"Sherlock, what the-" John began in tired frustration. "Why?" he asked, flopping his hands by his sides.
John squirmed a little so he could lay his head on Sherlock's shoulder and he wrapped his arm over his naked chest. He was fairly sure they should probably get cleaned up and be less naked in case anyone did arrive to spoil their fun. But for now, he didn't have any plans to move until Sherlock did.
John blinked, thrown for a moment by both Sherlock's soft tone, as much as by his use of John's title. He clinked his glass to his friend's, careful to avoid the candle between them and didn't take his eyes from Sherlock's as he took a sip.
"Oh yeah, that - that's charming," John said, and he pushed his chair back, intending to go to the bar for the next half hour at least. Mike was looking between them both with a confused expression, when John asked if he'd like another drink. He didn't offer one to Sherlock.
John ran his hands through his hair and held them there while he gaped at Sherlock. "Is this going to be a regular thing? Because I'm sure between us we can find something else for you to do."
"This is it now - come off the drink," he told her quietly. "I'll help you through rehab, but I'm not funding anything else, not anymore." He felt the emotion in his throat before the tears came and Harry took his hand, passed him a tissue.
He ordered garlic bread and made sure Sherlock ate some too. Sherlock seemed less able to relax the longer they sat there and spent most of the time looking out of the window, only looking at John to answer a question. Instead of feeling irritated though, John could only admire his friend. He was putting himself through these awkward experiences and although John didn't fully understand why, he appreciated it. Trying to get him to talk about something other than work proved to be tricky. John decided to give up on trying to engage him and talked randomly about his day instead, laughing to himself about how many times his receptionist had needed to stop an elderly man from barging straight into the surgery, ending up more stressed than John by the end of the morning. Eventually, John realised that Sherlock was watching him, just looking at him, arms folded, slight smile on his lips. John smiled back, pleased that he had managed to get his friend to relax a little. Angelo brought out their food and they each had pasta in a pesto cream sauce. It was delicious.
He worked solidly for the next hour and a half, forgot the time, missed any opportunity for food and huffed and sighed a little as he packed up and set off for the tube at a fast walk.
"I trust you," Sherlock told him, eyes so soft and endlessly open to interpretation, but this time John needed to see that his words had sunk in.
Sherlock relaxed his hold slightly and John squeezed his arse again, running his hands around to his hips, before taking Sherlock's hand and pulling him in the direction of the stairs. They weren't quiet, there was stumbling, they stopped for more kissing on the first landing, Sherlock pressing John in to the wall this time and looming over him before capturing his lips. He remembered the feeling when Sherlock had first manhandled him and he wanted more of that.
John's breath began to come in shallow huffs as he pulled at his cock, toes curling, legs stretched out as he found his rhythm, hips giving erratic thrusts into his fist, other hand clutching the sheets as his orgasm hit and he came with a gasp, his pent-up tension released along with his cum.
"I've wanted to ask you for some time, if we could try this. It means a lot to me that you're so patient, John."
So he pulled the door closed, grabbed the blanket from his chair and lay down on the sofa. He felt even worse now than he did waking in a police cell. More sleep would definitely help.
"I thought this was something out of reach..." Sherlock said, when he could take a breath. "Being naked, having an orgasm with someone else," he added. "It was beautiful John."
"I have a late surgery, won't be back before eight," John called out again, but there was no response this time. He pulled a yellow sticky off the pad by the fridge and wrote out a quick note:
"No, no, don't apologise, Sherlock, I'm not expecting anything from you, there's no pressure here, ok?"
John pulled away the collar of Sherlock's shirt but he already knew he would need to get it off. "Um, do you mind?" he asked carefully. "I need to see the joint."
"You can't even send a text to let me know where you are? Or how about damn-well asking me for help once in a while? We're meant to have each other's backs, isn't that the point? We're a partnership." But even as the words came out he knew, it was a futile argument. They had never declared it to be anything other than a working thing. John had no hold over this man. He knew it, even as Sherlock looked at him in a way that made John want to cry. John took a breath, no idea what more to add.
John heard himself chuckle and Mrs Hudson pushed the plate of biscuits further towards him. "Thank you, Mrs Hudson."
Sherlock hummed and turned back to go into the kitchen. John needed to put his sister from his mind. He had an hour before his surgery but when he wandered into the kitchen to see what Sherlock was doing, he stood wide-eyed for a moment before deciding he would rather go into work early than deal with whatever it was the man was doing on that table. He backed out of the room with a plea for Sherlock to at least clean the table afterwards this time, and went to collect up his medical bag and coat.
It took less than three seconds for Sherlock to let John know just how he was feeling about the previous night. Grumpy. He stomped into the kitchen and huffed about the place while John watched him over his coffee mug. When he finally came to a stop in the middle of the room, tea in hand, he glared at John.
"Uh, no... he's not here?" John asked, deflating yet again as he realised he would have to wait now for Sherlock to get home.
"Just let her look after us a little," John replied. The thought of food right now was not pleasant to him either.
"You like that?" Sherlock asked, face close to John's, eyes wide and curious as their breathing came frantically together and John nodded,
"Absolutely," John said, with complete conviction. "What we have has no correlation to anything I've had before. I promise you," John said, leaning on his elbows, as close to Sherlock as he could manage with this barrier still between them.
He could do this. He had to, he'd been through so much worse than this, surely? But maybe the pain of rejection, of loss - even though you couldn't lose something that had never really been yours... maybe those things were the worst of all?
"You have feelings? Sorry, not the time, go on." John rested his chin on his hand, the other clutching his drink and wrapped loosely around his waist as he listened.
"Not after... I turned someone down once, at University," Sherlock told him softly. "Since then I've stayed away. He wasn't someone I could ever have considered a friend, and certainly nothing more than that."
John looked. He saw a man he would never have dreamed of. Someone he admired and respected beyond measure. A man whose actions, whose company caused John both joy and pain and he wouldn't change anything - not one thing about Sherlock. He was so grateful to have him at all. John wiped at his eyes.
"What is the point of a relationship? Why can't two people just be friends, spend time together in the same place, what more does there need to be?"
John was so turned on he could only attempt to join in, blindly meeting Sherlock's every move, trying to ensure Sherlock would come back for more.
It was still open though and John allowed his gaze to drift over his friend's chest. He swallowed hard. "Tell me where you're going next time?" he asked in a whisper, nearly shaking with the need to touch.
John wanted to kick himself. What the actual fuck was he thinking, doing this to Sherlock? "God, no, no not at all. Shit, I'm so sorry." He hung his head, he felt terrible. "Nothing is going to change, Sherlock, I just needed to get this out there... but, with hindsight, I definitely should have kept it to myself."
"When I left, when I was away... I thought of you. Often. When it was time to return my only hope was to find you at Baker Street, waiting for me." He looked away to the dying embers in the fireplace. "Stupid," he laughed softly. "Why should you have waited for me?"
