"Baby, what are you scared of?" Dean asked, looking around for anything which was a danger to their peace.
In this universe, they are around 40 - well at least Dean is. Here they are a hunter and an angel, fighting side by side. They do tell each other their feelings, but they are too late. A hunt gone wrong leaves the Winchester bleeding and struggling to breathe. They know that this is it, that this is the end. The angel holds his dying hunter in his arms and asks him if the love was one-sided; the answer is simply 'no'. This is their last conversation.
As Dean let go of the final note, Cas was thankful that the lights were down to conceal his tears. He was just replaying what had just happened in his head, when Dean's voice caught his attention.
“Gabe, relax he’ll be here in about 20 minutes,” Said Cas, from where he was wrapped up in the older Winchester’s arms.
"I know it's stupid." Whispered Cas, " I know it can't hurt me but-" Another crack of thunder cut the smaller man off.
On this particular Sunday, the boys were simply laying in bed and enjoying each others company. Suddenly, Cas turned his head to look at Dean.
“Sam! Dean! I was waiting for you guys! We all were. We all wondered how long it would be before we saw you again. I’m glad we could all be here.” She says, arms still wrapped around both of them.
Though Dean was basking in his newfound acceptance of himself it was hard to miss Crowley’s latest sullen temper tantrum as he hastily gulped down the last of his drink. This combined with Crowley’s tendency to enjoy screwing with him and his brother was what made Dean brace for Crowley to go marching into the roadhouse announcing ‘I know what you did last summer’ secrets.
“Ah yes avoidance, you thought ‘works so well in life, why not try it in heaven as well. Ha. Take it from me, squirrel, this is the big leagues. It didn't work then and it won’t work now.”
The scene he had just witnessed of Dean and Cass’s declaration of love played over in his mind and was hard-pressed to admit that the two blithering idiots had taken a long time to accept what was glaringly obvious. Crowley didn’t believe in all the mushy bullshit of love.
“No, uh actually my kid was there with me.” He replies, giving a tiny smile and fidgeting with his hands.
“Sam?” He hears from across the room. They all turn around to see Eileen standing there, a tray of glasses smashed all over the floor.
“What-how are you here? I thought you could only share heaven with your soulmates?” Sam wipes his tears away once he’s let go of Bobby.
“Hello, Dean.” That was all it took. Dean threw himself at the man-pulling him into what he was sure was the tightest and most desperate hug he’s ever given.
“Well, that’s what you always wanted, right?” A thought crosses Deans mind and he has to ask “You weren’t alone, were you? Tell me you had somebody there with you.” He couldn’t stand the thought of his baby brother dying all alone. Cause while his death had been painful, at least Sammy had been there with him. At least his brother had been there until the very end.
“No-it’s okay. I’m just sorry you guys had to die for me.” He mutters, looking down quietly, a wave of self-loathing and guilt washing over him.
The two men sat in silence gazing out at heaven, each thinking of all that had been said and all that still wasn't. Though both had to admit it was funny how heaven had a way of working things out for the pair. Dean once again was leaning back with the crook of his ankle resting in his knee looking more relaxed then he had in years. And the only demon with the exception into heaven had finally settled back as well examining the sun drenched place with a bemused expression. An air of acceptance emanated from the former king.
Cas, who was an angel. Cas, who he didn’t think had loved him back until that fateful moment. Cas who was staring at him in this moment, looking more shocked then he had ever in his life.
“Yes, finally!” He heard from behind them, and whipped around to see the rest of the family there, Charlie having been the one that spoke.
“So, what got you?” He asks, not wanting to dance around the question any longer. Sam shifts a little, giving a chuckle in response.
“What about you, Rowena? I thought you were queen of hell?” Sam looks into the face of the woman he killed.
“Who do you think you’re talking to? Hello, I was king of the crossroads, unlike you, I didn’t get to the top with just my good looks. Brains
Crowley would never admit it, even to himself, buried somewhere behind his brooding cynicism was the real reason he was bothered. And it wasn’t because of heaven or his witch of a mother.
“Good! Heaven just got a lot safer.” Apparently even in heaven something’s never change and Dean had to make a sarcastic comment when the opportunity arose.
The silence stretched once again, leaving their words to hang in the haze of the summer air. Dean would have preferred this as he usually found conversations with Crowley to be a pain in the ass. This was heaven and if Dean was allowed any consolation it would have been to just sit and enjoy Crowley’s company without him being annoying enough to make Dean want to strangle him.
They were next led over to the table were Kevin and his mom were sitting, the chess board left abandoned as they greeted them.
“Relax squirrel.” Crowley cut over Dean again. “I don’t intend on releasing our greatest hits. To your boy toy angel or anyone else. I might bend them.. for enjoyment.. but I keep my promises.”
Crowley huffed “You gonna start a line to tell that to the rest of your fan club in there. Appreciation is
The comment was followed by an eye-roll. It was just like Crowley to overshare and then blame others for his decisions. Dean couldn’t count the number of times he had done this. Even going back to when he had met the fiend, Dean remembered the tantrum Crowley pulled after giving them the colt. Something about his tailor, blah blah blah, lots of yelling, dramatic street light exploding. It had all become very Crowley. Expected. This is what made working with the demon so frustrating. And by the end, though Crowley had proved his worth to him and Sammy, Dean couldn’t bring himself to see Crowley as anything more collateral damage despite their complicated relationship.
“When I got my ticket punched they were still kicking. Claire and Kaia had just celebrated their 20th anniversary actually.” Jody says a fondness creeping into her voice. They congratulated them on that, the words making Dean’s heart swell.
For Dean’s part, a wave of anger flashed in him that often accompanied his memories as a demon. He was ashamed of himself for giving in to the mark so easily and even more so for the things he had done during that time. He hurt people and spiraled more and more out of control. All the while Crowley watched. And it was this out-of-control feeling he often associated with the demon. That feeling also dovetailed with the one of freedom he felt in being able to be the person shoved down by years of repressed homophobia. Only once he was cured of being a demon did that taste of freedom turn bitter, becoming a reminder of something that was always just out of reach for Dean.
sincere when mixed with bitterness.-” The fiend paused contemplating on the turn of events before facing dean, smirking and with a mimicking voice quipped “-...but thank you.”
Crowley on the other hand felt the silence as stifling as the holiness. Well, his general rule-along with always say yes to being tied up and spanked- was to never let others know your thoughts, looking at Dean now Crowley felt he had so much to say. The last he saw of the boy band reject was when he sacrificed himself so they could stop Lucifer. The circumstances alone left little room for witty conversation much less the spill your guts goodbye kind that Crowley so despised. In addition to yelling at them for somehow being moronic enough to fuck up, he found himself wishing he could say all the things he hadn’t when he died. Yet he discovered even coming to a coherent thought on the matter to be much like slicing one's abdomen open to have a look around.
“Let’s give them some space, c’mon,” he could hear Bobby saying, as everyone started shuffling outside.
“What’s up bitches?!” Charlie’s loud and peppy voice breaks him from his thoughts, and he’d never been happier to hear it. She launches herself at them with the ferocity he’d come to expect from her. She gets Sam first, draping her arms around his neck, and Dean sees him reach down and whisper something in her ear that makes her smile. When she’s done with Sam, she gets him next, hugging him so tight that he thought he might break.
But for once Dean was too happy to care. Crowley could blabber trying to sound like a quick-witted douche all he wanted. Nothing was going to take his happiness away and this thought made him smile.
“Yes. I decided that heaven would be better this way. You guys deserve it. You’ve saved the world, yet you lost so much. Plus you’re my family, I want you guys to be happy. I didn’t do it alone, though. Actually-speaking of that..” Jack was interrupted by the sound of glass breaking.
“Sonofabitch!” Suddenly there was a loud smash as Dean’s beer bottle hit the dusty ground, exploding into a million amber pieces. Started by the sudden action Crowley observed Dean though shocked but narrowed eyes.
But instead of getting up and storming off, Crowley snapped his fingers, a drink with a little umbrella appearing in his hands. He took a gulp and leaned back in the chair.
. He had just gotten together with Cass, had finally admitted his feelings, and finally opened himself up to love. But He wasn’t ready to open up about his parents though and he especially didn’t want to have to deal with the storm of hate and disappointment that was John and Mary Winchester.
“It wasn’t your guys’s fault. It was Chucks. All that matters is that I’m here now, with my mom.” Kevin replies, wrapping an arm around his mom’s waist. She pulls him close and kisses him on top of his head. Dean watches the exchange with a mixture of joy and jealousy. He wishes he could’ve had that kind of relationship with his mom-but it was too late for that now. Speaking of his mom-his parents are looking at him and Sam, smiling expectantly. But Dean doesn’t go over and greet them. He doesn’t talk to them. He can’t right now. They didn’t treat him or Sam the best when they were alive, and Dean wasn’t ready to face them yet. It still hurts too much to look at them and think about what they had done. Maybe one day he’ll be ready to talk, but today is not that day.
Turning to Rowena who was still standing at the door studying him, his majesty gave a devilish smirk.
as he often cursed was a fire only pillock’s played with. His own experience of getting burned all too fresh in Crowley’s mind. But with god involved he wouldn’t put it past that Dean and Cass were somehow cosmically meant to be and the thought of that perhaps irritated him most of all.
“Have you?” Dean asked, turning to look at the only demon he gave a slight crap about. He knew he was deflecting, but this wasn’t a conversation he was ready to have, especially with
“We’re so sorry we got you killed, Kevin. And that it took you so long to get up here.” Dean pats the kid on the shoulder, so, so thankful that he was finally up here.
“You got this brother,” he barely registered Benny’s words as he patted him on the shoulder and left with Charlie, who gave him a conspiratorial wink. As everyone was leaving, Sam passed with Eileen, arms around each other. He gave Dean a smile that said everything. Soon, everyone was gone, and it was just the two of them.
They sat there in silence for a few minutes while Dean composed himself. Once he had, he looked over at Sam, and smiled. “Let’s go, Sammy.” He patted him on the shoulder and turned to walk to the car.
“Your boy Jack changed the rules here. Now you can see anyone you want. In fact, while you were gone I gathered the troops. There are some people who want to see you.” Dean and Sam exchanged looks, wondering what Bobby could be talking about. “Follow me,” he chuckled, seeing their confused faces. He gestured to them and they dutifully followed Bobby inside the roadhouse. What greeted them as they entered shocked Dean to the very core.
“Better check on Sammy and make sure the witch bitch here hasn’t lured him to go dark side.” Smirking at the affront look on Rowena's face Dean patted his demon counterpart on the shoulder and made to get up.
“You take her with you-you hear or I will make Cass come for your ass! Damnit Crowley don’t look at me like that, you know what I mean!”
But Crowley’s gaze lingered. There was something behind the demon’s eyes that Dean couldn’t quite read and if he had cared at all he would have asked about it. but he didn’t so he just took another swig and laughed, looking back out at heaven.
“Made up with mommy and daddy dearest yet?” Crowley finally looked back at Dean who was now leaned back and had his ankle resting on his knee.
“God I missed you,Charlie.” He says, holding the little sister he never wanted yet discovered he needed close.
But Dean paused at the frame. It seemed to be the in-between of the peaceful outside of heaven and the rowdy inside of the roadhouse. And though he had enjoyed the peacefulness, hearing his friends and newly minted boyfriend inside made Dean long to join them.
“She hasn't tried to sell me for any more pigs if that's what you’re asking.” Crowley scoffed “But if I’m not mistaken, you avoided the question. Trouble in paradise?”
“Because I was scared, Cas! You’re an angel! A freaking cosmic being! I didn’t think or know you could feel the same way- that you did feel the same way! I didn’t want to ruin what we had. I didn’t think it was an option for us.” He now leans in closer to Cas, cupping his face with his hand “But now that I know there is, I want you to know that this is something you can have. And you know that I don’t say that lightly, that I mean it. I’ve never handled emotions well, that’s something I’ve always struggled with, and I regretted it the moment you admitted you loved me. I regretted that I couldn’t find the courage to say it back, or even say it before. So know that I mean it with all my heart and soul when I say that I love you, angel.” With that, he pulls Cas close and kisses him, strong and fierce, but also gentle and desperate at the same time. He kisses Cas like he’s never kissed anyone before. He’s never been one for cheesy romantic movies, but this felt like one. He hated to think it, but this kiss felt magical. When they let go, Dean leans his forehead against Cas’s, his breath hot against Dean’s face.
Downing the last of the cheap amber in his glass, Crowley was just about to get up to yank Rowena away from Moose in the means of leaving, when he felt a presence behind him.
“Yeah, we really bonded over being friends of Dean Winchester’s who ended up dying for him” Charlie turned cheekily to Dean, face dropping at his expression “Oh gosh Dean I was just joking. Was that too soon? That was probably too soon.”
His voice was deep and full of something that almost sounded like pain. Taking another large gulp of his drink so that it was almost emptied, Crowley bitterly hoped that it would go away. But even as he assured Dean, he could feel the familiar sensation of those months spent with him creeping in. Back then Crowley in no way owned Dean. He was too, some would say wild, Crowley preferred reckless. and the demon wasn’t emotionally compromised enough to think that cherub in a trenchcoat had a full grasp on dean no matter how many dangly bits he gripped tight and raised from perdition. But Crowley could not help feeling that Dean shut him out especially.
Crowley narrowed his eyes wondering if anyone would notice Dean spontaneously bursting into flame. It would have been so easy. One snap of the finger. But something nagged at Crowley. It was the thing that had kept him in his seat when he had so wanted to leave and it was the thing now that stopped Crowley from turning Dean into a man candle. Taking a more bobby-sized swig of his drink than a gentlemanly one, Crowley let the alcohol numb him. If he believed in taking criticism the former king of hell would have examined not only his feelings at the moment but also the truth behind Dean's comment, but Crowley didn’t come to his rise and fall without his knack for arrogance and instead did what he did best.
“I still am, Samuel. Just visiting at the moment. Jack lent me the ability to cross between heaven and hell, and when Fergus here said to come up, I knew I had to.”
of caring. Tell or don’t But I’m done running from who I am, of being angry. At myself, at you, I’m just done.”
“I do believe that’s my cue to leave.” Dean cut over Crowley's latest tantrum. He had seen it all before and no way was Dean going to waste his time in heaven watching the king and queen of rotten go at it.
“No shit? You died of old age? You?” Dean replies, hardly being able to believe it. Out of all the things, he never thought a Winchester could live to die of old age.
Dean on his end was at a loss for words. The Crowley he knew was like a dog to a bone and if anything Dean just tossed him a steak. But the demon in front of him now didn’t smirk with glee while making a sarcastic comment, instead he hung his head looking tired. Crowley was well, beat and broken. Once a regal king able to out smart the brothers at every turn, the demon got kidnapped and addicted to human blood, (that might have been Dean’s fault, oops) overthrown twice, (once by Abaddon then by Lucifer who made Crowley his pet) dealt with his mother (begrudgingly Dean had to sympathize as he was pretty much the expert on deadbeat parents) and then sacrificed himself to save the world (though Dean still believe that no one asked Crowley to, given it didn’t end up helping anyways.)
“I am! You have no idea how happy I am to see you! But you died, Cas! You told me you loved me and then you left me you asshole!” He shouts, letting his emotions fly out. Cas stares at him in shock, but Dean doesn’t stop his tirade “You can’t just do that! You can’t tell someone you love them, totally turn their world upside down, and then leave!”
“She gets to remain the queen of hell, and in turn, I get to do what I want when I want. Being the prince of hell does have its perks. I was in Barbados till, that puppy of yours, jack, bloody well zapped me here. Impeccable timing, pornstar orgies don’t happen very often ya know.”
“According to red here, I need to be up to date with pop culture ” Benny’s thick Cajun accent sounded like music to Dean’s ears. He had come up behind Charlie while they were talking, fangs popping out when he smiled.
“Benny.” Sam greets happily, having taken a liking to Benny after hearing about what he did. And Dean was so, so happy in this moment-standing between his brother and two of his best friends.
Dean had finally got what he had wanted since he first sat down with the demon. A silent Crowley that he could actually enjoy. The demon and the hunter sat still, the sounds of summer enveloped the empty space absent of conversion and was only interrupted by the creek of the roadhouse door opening, spilling out the ambience of dive bar chatter that Dean knew well. Both men turned, finding Rowena smirking at them dramatically, with her hip against the frame.
Now sitting on the porch of heaven’s shittest watering hole though, Crowley had to fight with regret. Perhaps it was the human feelings from his blood addiction that never quite left or the fuzzy lovey-doveyness of heaven but Crowley allowed himself to ponder what his life would have been like had things been different. If he had a mother who cared, direction when he was alive, or even chose not to sell his soul.
“Crowley.” Dean snarled his voice full of warning. “I was a demon ok, off my mind from the mark-thanks to you. And we agreed remember-“
But the hype of this admiration and thanks from Dean Winchester was just that it seemed, hype. At this realization Crowely unexpectedly felt a weight lift off of him. All this chasing of Dean, trying to be good and for what? Just to be rejected, lose his kingdom and die for a world that is damned anyway. Crowley knew he was better than that and it was this that made him smile. He suddenly could have given a shit about squirrel or his angel, history be damned.
Crowley had never had much in the way of a family and as much as the demon was reluctant to admit it, the Winchesters and their lot had become his family.
“Even I knew! Although I can’t say much for your taste in men, I would’ve been a much better choice.” Crowley boasts, giving his signature smirk. Even though he was already dead, Dean wanted to die at that very moment.
“Such a tease, that hardened soul of yours is a turn-on for me. And now that your full-on gay parade, well better for me, isn’t it.”
But instead of looking angry as Crowley would have thought, Dean was taking deep breaths. Pushing away his anger, Dean suddenly came to a realization. He didn’t have to hide who he was here. He didn’t have to feel guilty or angry or gross, he felt enough of that upon the earth.
Though Crowley knew he had no right to judge his mother’s favoritism toward the mooseyer of the two Winchesters, he had never cared much in the way of hypocrisy and allowed the resentful feelings to linger in him like the taste of the roadhouse liquor on the tongue.
“Don’t look to me for help. I spent 11 years watching you pine over him. Some days I really just wanted to lock you two in a room and force you to admit it.” That makes everyone laugh, even Cas. Dean turns to him affronted, but Cas just smirks.
“It really shouldn’t have taken us this long.” Dean mutters and reaches out his hand. Cas grasped it tightly in his own, glancing down at their conjoined hands and smiling softly. Dean doesn’t know what him and Cas are, if they are going to or even should define it. But for now, that’s not important. They love each other, and that’s all that matters. They have all the time in the world to figure it out. For now they just hold each other close and rejoin the rest of their family, reveling in their perfect little slice of heaven.
“I’m sure you’ll be back for drinks and to generally be a pain in my ass and there’s probably no way to stop you so-so I’m not going to try. See you around Crowley.” Dean gave a half hearted wave to Crowley and a somewhat playful glare at Rowena before turning on his heel and walking through the threshold of the roadhouse. Immersing Dean in a place that felt like home, the door swung shut behind the hunter closing out the peaceful summer evening and leaving the pair of evil incarnate alone. Taking a deep breath of stale beer Dean smiled as he spotted his angel. With the whole Crowley thing over with all Dean wanted to do was go to him but as he did so the Winchester had to admit, it was Crowley out of all people that showed him what acceptance really was.
He should have known it was wrong for him and mother to come up here and despite the air of civility they both played he had no problem calling his mother a damn fool.
“You boys better come over and hug me!” He hears Jody’s voice from behind them and laughs, turning around. Jody hugs them both fiercely, coming up to cup their faces. “It’s so good to look at you.”
“Did it occur to you that I avoided the question for a reason?” Though Dean's voice was sharp his face stayed impressively passive. “You of all people know what crappy parents are like.” Another gulp of beer.
“You guys were taking a while, so we decided to check in and see if you got your heads out of your asses yet.” She shrugs.
“There you go, you’re catching on Winchester! I’m so proud.” She holds her hand over her heart and gives a fake sniff. And god he forgot how much he missed her. “And Sam can join us well. Oh and Benny! He needs to see some movies-he’s been dead way too long.”
“Cas,” he choked out, pulling the angel in even tighter until he felt Cas’s arms wrap around him “You’re here, you’re actually here.”
He looked a little further to the left to see two people he never thought he would see in heaven of all places- Crowley and Rowena. And they were sitting together, acting civil, even having fun?
“I love you too, you idiot!” He blurts out, not wanting to hold back any longer, not wanting to waste anymore time. And he can’t believe he’s actually saying it. He had never told anyone he loved them before-except for Sam-but that was different because it was his brother. This was
“We definitely told him a lot of stories, he should know about the person he was named for after all.” That made Dean stop in his tracks.
“Right, but do all a favor and save us the Winchester man pain. You liked the waters at motel 6, and at that Deplorable dive- what was it called, el rodeo-in fact you practically begged-“
Of course, no liquor in the world could make Crowley forget where he was, and the itch of saintly goodness that heaven provided was starting to grate on him. Fergus even as a motherless child knew he would most likely never get to heaven and by the time he remade himself as the mighty Crowley he was too power-hungry to care. Hell was his playground and it gave him a taste of everything he had been denied in life.
“Rowena? Crowley?” Sam manages to choke out in shock. He clearly hadn’t noticed them before like Dean had.
“Hey, everyone, look who finally decided to show up!” Bobby exclaimed, causing everyone to look towards them. It took a minute to register, but soon the room filled with smiles and loud exclamations. Dean was so overwhelmed by people he didn’t know who to go to first. Luckily he was stopped from having to make that choice by Jo rushing over and latching herself onto them.
Crowley stared at the door where Dean had just been, watching it swing in his absence. The demon hadn’t a chance to respond to Dean’s last statement and he was sure that Dean had wanted it that way. It didn’t matter much though because if Crowley knew Dean, and he did, that was the closest the lumberjack look alike was going to get to a heartfelt goodbye. This made Crowley smirk to himself, realizing he was okay with that. Dean had all but given Crowley a spot at the bar, his figurative family table, and the fiend knew better than to look past that as acceptance. As Crowley stood up from the rocker to look around heaven one last time, the words of Dean rang in his head.
“Calling the winged annoyance your boyfriend doesn't ring the same now that it’s true.” Crowley drawled, filling the peacefulness with the annoying comment.
“What the hell? Were you guys watching us or something?” He hissed out, pissed at having the moment interrupted.
Dean thinks, but doesn’t say it. He gets into his baby and starts it, the car purring the life, glad to have both of its inhabitants home. And then they drive. They drive back across the bridge, and through the woods, Dean sliding in one of his cassette tapes while Sam rolls his eyes fondly. He then throws Sam a cheeky smile and starts singing along very loudly and very off-key. It’s just like old times. When the cassette tape is out of songs, he sees it in front of him. “The roadhouse,” Sam mutters and Dean can hear the fondness in his voice. They pull up the dirt road and park in front of it. When they step out of the car, Bobby is still sitting right where Dean left him.
Dean leaned against the front door frame of the roadhouse taking a deep breath of the warm thick air of heaven. He felt truly at peace. A feeling he never thought he’d be able to feel. Not only was he reunited with Sammy, who got to live a long and happy life but he could live out the rest of his, well death, with the ones he loved. He had never dreamed in life that he and Cass could be anything more than friends and even when Cass finally admitted his feelings it was too late. But here in heaven time meant nothing, the constraint of human life meant nothing and Dean could finally be the person he always wanted to. Dean went to his grave sure he hated chick flick moments but now he wondered if that was just because he could never love the person he wanted to. If telling Cass how he felt lifted such a weight off his chest, the thought of them finally being able to be together made it swell with happiness. Something he likened to that stupid Christmas movie he used to put on for Sammy when he was little.
“Not bloody likely.” Crowley laughed. As If the vision of himself with a pair of fluffy wings was particularly amusing. “Darling, I don’t have the bone structure for all that angelic grace.” The sentence ended with the usual smirk that made Dean want to smack him with an angel blade.
“Yes. Jack raised me from the empty, and he and I fixed heaven.” Dean releases himself from Cas’s embrace, placing his hands on Cas’s shoulders. But, standing there, looking into his eyes, Dean can’t help but get angry.
“If there’s a club for people who died for the Winchester’s- I think we should be invited, should we not?” A female voice pipes up. Rowena and Crowley had come up behind Benny and Charlie in between all the hugs.
“Ay, one big happy family now aren't we Fergus?” The queen cooed and leaning over, cupped Crowley’s face in her hand much like a loving mother would do to a child. Though seeing as Rowena was just the opposite of loving and Crowley was a grown ass man the sight was certainly strange.
Crowley turned, looking at Dean for the first time since he had walked up to the door. “Why bother, you're smiling like a stripper with daddy’s credit card. Nothing I’d say will change that.”
Everyone was there. Every person that had died that he cared for was there. Jo was sitting at the bar talking excitedly with the man Dean could only assume was her father, while Ellen stood behind the bar making drinks. Ash was laying on the pool table, sleeping. Jody and Donna sat there as well, laughing, as Bobby went over and gave Jody a kiss on the cheek. Kevin and his mom were sitting at a table having what looked like an intense game of chess. Charlie was in a group with a girl that Dean assumed was her girlfriend, Pamela, and
“What? The king of hell doesn’t deserve to make it up here? I did die for you, you know.” Dean fixes him with a knowing stare and Crowley sighs “Apparently this new god decided that I deserved to be up here for helping you. Can’t complain.” He goes back to nursing his fruity beverage with the little umbrella.
“You-you named your kid after me?” He asks, fighting back the tears in his voice. Sam nodded and it took everything in Dean to not start bawling like a baby right then and there. He slid his arm off of Sam’s shoulders and clasped his hands together in front of him on the railing.
“Eileen!” Sam strides across the room, his long legs making him faster. When he reaches Eileen, he leans down and kisses her, sweeping her up into the air. Dean beams with pride, delighted to see his brother so happy. But a little spark of jealousy burns within him, as he thinks about what he could’ve had. What he would’ve had-if he hadn’t been so dumb. If he had just told- Dean couldn’t even say his name. It hurt too much to even think about him. He shook the thoughts out of him and focused on the happy reunion. He was so focused he almost didn’t hear the familiar swoosh. He didn’t even notice until the room went very quiet, everyone turning to stare at something. He followed their eyes and landed on a very familiar sight. Long tan trench coat, dark blue tie, messy black hair, and deep blue eyes that bore into his very soul. They didn’t say anything, just stared at each other. Dean could barely breathe, he said wasn’t sure he could say anything.
They have made sure to calculate as many of the risks as possible. Jack should be powered up enough right now to stay awake in the empty, should be protected enough to not get harmed on the way in. And they have talked about how to make sure that Jack’s chances of actually finding Cas on the other side are as high as they can be.
Until he sees Cas’ blue eyes blink at him, his hair disheveled as if he just got spit out by a tornado.
He has disappointed and left Cas behind too many times already. He will not let that stupid son of a bitch just leave like that. Cas can’t just drop the L-bomb on him and then fuck off to super-mega-hell and leave him behind, eternally wondering about “what-ifs”.
The concrete of the wall stops feeling cold on his hand, getting warmer and warmer by the second. Feeling less like concrete. Feeling more like.. a curtain.
Dean nods, appreciating that his brother doesn’t fill Jack in that Dean is responsible for Cas’ death.
Jack and Sam exchange a look and it’s Sam who clears his throat now and furrows his brow. “No offense, Dean, but I think Jack should do it. You don’t belong in the Empty, and the risk that it would eject you on impact is too high. Besides,” the corners of his mouth turn up in a small, sad smile. “You’re probably the strongest connection he has to earth, and we might be able to use that. It’s our best shot.”
Dean never thought he’d see him cry and smile again, but it is what’s happening right now. And Dean, miraculously, is smiling, too.
Jack and Cas making it out of the empty alive, if they manage to follow Cas’ connection to earth out of the pit, remains their biggest concern. Sam has found one powerful healing spell that he thinks he can pull off, but they have never tried something like this and Sam is not yet sure about the consequences it might bring.
“I’ll do it.” Dean says, not missing a beat. His skin tingles with anticipation and the familiar and very welcome feeling to be able to do something. The old longing for that big win.
The dungeon, which has always felt like one of their greatest weapons against any supernatural being, suddenly doesn’t feel empowering to Dean anymore. He feels like its cold walls are mocking him, closing in on him, suffocating him.
If  years ago anyone had told Dean that he would one day shuffle out of his bed, willingly, at three in the fucking morning to browse through a bunch of books that are so ancient that a good percentage of them are probably written on paper made from human skin, he would have told them to seek out professional help. But here he is, stained pyjama pants, ratty t-shirt, barefoot on the stinging cold stone tiles of the bunker’s library.
Instead, Sam is stuck in an underground bunker founded by some weirdo cult with Dean, CEO of Being A Dick, who makes everything he touches implode in itself.
As he fights his body to stay awake, he hears Sam rushing down to the dungeon again, a bowl full of spell ingredients stuffed under one arm, a book in the other.
One after the other, they cut their palms, each dripping a bit of blood into the bowl - Jack and Dean had a whole discussion before about whose blood to use, as the spell stated it needs that of the “most beloved one”, Dean continually insisting that the paternal love Cas holds for Jack is his strongest bound to earth, while Jack was convinced they’d have to use Dean’s blood. At some point, Sam broke up the fight by telling them they should just both do it, and he would as well, because third time’s a charm and all that.
“Because, it requires both dimensions to have something reaching out to one another. Desperately. Something that is.. profoundly bonded, if you want to call it that.”
“You know, after losing Jess, I didn’t think I’d find anyone like her again, alright?” Sam says and Dean looks at him now, his little brother, who has gotten so old all of a sudden, who has crinkles on his forehead from all the heavy lifting his mind does.
“Cas, buddy,” he sobs, desperately trying to get his breathing under control, “please, please just pull through, alright? I-” he clutches his hand around Cas’ handprint on his shoulder.
Reluctantly, he puts on what he hopes to be a cheerful mask, announcing his arrival with an overly enthusiastic “room service!”.
He pours them all some cups of coffee and pushes Sam’s and Jack’s over to where they’re still wrapping their heads around the new information on the other side of the kitchen table.
“An ANGEL exorcism.” Dean corrects. “A permanent, irrevocable, painless - well, hopefully - extraction of his grace.”
Dean gapes at him, shutting his mouth with a click of his teeth. How is he supposed to tell Sam that he hasn’t even thought about this? This, again, is just another proof of how emotions cloud people’s judgement, and he should be the first to know that, because after all it was him who literally sold his soul to save his little brother and-
Sam sketches the sigil against the wall - that fucking wall, as soon as this whole deal is over, Dean is probably gonna tear it down - and instructs Dean to trace it with his blood.
Jack nods and holds his hand out to where Dean is rolling up the sleeve of his T-Shirt, revealing the handprint Cas left on his shoulder more than a decade ago. Jack lays his hand on it as Sam begins to recite the spell, and after a few moments Dean can feel his shoulder burning, more painfully and insistently than it did after he dug himself out of his own grave.
He thought he didn’t have it in him to feel sorry for anything he did anymore, but the guilt hits him instantly. Sam is all he’s got left. The one thing in his life that hasn’t really left him - not yet - and he wouldn’t even be here in the first place if Dean hadn’t been so selfish all those years ago. He would probably have graduated from Stanford top of his class. He’d be a big-shot lawyer. He would occasionally think about his deadbeat Dad and idiotic, narcistic brother while spending the weekend at his in-laws with his wife and kids.
“Never. Ever. Do that again, you stupid, selfless, ignorant son of a bitch.” he demands and man, what is it with his watery eyes and choked up voice lately?
“What do you want me to tell you, Sam?” he asks and intends it to come out sharp, but even to his own ears he just sounds exhausted, defeated. “Cas was being a stupid dick. Again. He made a deal, another knee-jerk decision, after all of us specifically agreed not to do something like this again. He saved me, and the empty took him, the end.”
“Cas made a deal with the Empty. It focused on him allowing himself to be happy. He fulfilled the deal.”
Sam clears his throat and it’s loud enough in the relative silence of the bunker to almost make Dean jump. “What has got you pouting?”
Dean’s head is throbbing. They have been running on leftovers and the bunkers (not quite sanitary) tap water for the past days and although he doesn’t want to admit it, he is beaten.
“It’s a sigil,” he explains to Dean and although he can tell that his brother is keeping his voice carefully neutral, Dean catches him licking his lips nervously. “I found it in one of Rowena’s books. It’s said to open up a door, build a bridge between dimensions of some sorts.”
Sam’s shot at a good life, far from all this shit. Mary’s second chance. The whole world, for crying out loud.
He can’t fucking do this. He can’t lose Cas. He can’t lose Jack. He can’t put Sam, who has also lost his best friend and is currently maybe losing his son as well, through all of this pain, all because of his own selfishness.
He also remembers Cas picking up those tiny habits that made him look so human. Crossing his arms. Leaning on a table. Rolling his eyes, mostly at him.
He is granted a very appreciated moment of the sweet sound of Sam shutting the hell up, which makes him hope, albeit briefly, that Sam will just drop it. He doesn’t, of course.
Until the wall turns solid again, and he clutches Cas’ shoulders, sinking into him, silently sobbing against his neck.
Walking down the hallway, he can hear Sam murmur what must be the twentieth protective spell over Jack. It’s hard not to think about everything that could go wrong, because Sam is right - how many times have they screwed themselves over out of despair? How many people have already been left bleeding, suffering, dieing, because they felt the need to act quickly and rescue those they love?
“I need you here. Jack needs you. Sam needs you. Fuck if the world needs you, Cas, we are a family and that’s enough. You said you cared about the whole world, well, I don’t give a rat’s ass about it, because all of this doesn’t mean shit to me if me, you, Sam and Jack aren’t together. We will kick Chuck’s ass, but we can only do it, if you’re here. So please, Cas, please - just come back to me.”
Dean was not lying about the simplicity of the ingredients needed for the actual spell. Book in hand, he moves around the bunker’s supply room, gathering some simple herbs and liquids in a bowl, as well as tossing in his old trusted knife that he keeps in the back pockets of his jeans at all times.
Sam looks equal parts unconvinced and about to roll his eyes as he gestures for Dean to put the supplies on one of the carts he has pulled there, finishing off the spell he is currently performing.
“Even if I had known then what I know now, I could never get her back. And after fourteen years, it still hurts like a bitch. All the ‘what-if’s’, you know, that shit haunts you.”
Sam lets out a heavy, exasperated breath. “Dean, I’ve seen that look on you before, you know. Back when Cas dropped through the rift, and Lucifer-”
“One of the spells Sam used”, Cas explains, sounding out of breath, but still so much like himself, and fucking alive, that Dean could cry all over again. “It was an extremely powerful one. The closest thing you can find to resurrection. It urges the body to protect itself, build itself up again if necessary. Jack, the way his body was - he wouldn’t have been able to hold it up without his grace, but now..”
Dean looks at the staring-match Sam and Jack are having, Jack’s all too familiar blue eyes piercing Sam’s, which are quickly twitching between the two other men. Something in his gaze shifts, and his shoulders slump in defeat. “Fine” Sam relents, looking, in fact, anything but fine, “let me grab all the ingredients we need. But you will let me cast every protection spell on you we can find.”
He can see it in Jack’s and Sam’s faces too, the heavy bags under their eyes, their dried out lips and reddened cheeks. They need a break. He is not one to admit defeat easily, but they won’t be of use to anybody in their current conditions.
Jack tilts his head, makes Dean’s heart sink with the gesture, before he finally looks up at him and nods.
“Extracting Cas’ grace is one thing. But Jack? Dean, he almost died on us before without his grace. You can’t possibly think this is worth it.”
They have been sitting in this kitchen for what feels like hours by now. The tiles have stopped feeling cold under Dean’s ass ages ago.
The talking has calmed his breathing enough for him to stop shaking and for the panic to receed. Strangely enough, he feels extremely exhausted and tired, the lack of sleep obviously catching up to him as his mind tries to stay awake and figure out what to do to make Cas and Jack find their way back.
Sighing, Dean drops his hand just slightly, angling his head to give Sam the ever so famous don’t-try-to-make-me-talk-about-it-because-you-already-know-I-won’t-look. He finds his brother's eyes dropping down to his phone, too quickly for Dean to guiltily cover up what he’s been looking at this whole time.
“Look Cas, I know you probably don’t want this, this human life - no, let me finish.” Dean insists, holding up a hand to Cas’ face as he opens up his mouth.
He sobs, closing his fists so tightly that fresh blood spills out of the wound where he cut himself with the knife for the spell.
Worried, Dean lets go of Cas, grabs him by the shoulders and holds him at arm’s length. In the back of his mind, he registers that Cas’ hands have sunk down to his waist.
He is about to open his mouth, because if he wants to deny any of this, he better be quick, the silence has already stretched too long to -
“I’m not sure I do” Cas replies honestly after a beat, his gaze switching from Dean’s left eye to his right one and back.
After telling his brother he is fine for what feels like five hundred times but is probably closer to fifteen, Dean is left alone in the dungeon again while Sam is roaming the bunker searching for some more supplies he might need to nurse Jack and Cas back to life once - IF they return from the empty.
Dean wants to deny, almost cruelly laughs about the implication, but all he manages is a furrowed brow as he scrambles his thoughts together.
Excitedly, Dean slaps the table in front of him, causing Jack to jump in his chair. “That’s the best part,” he adds, “the downside isn’t actually a downside!”
Dean lets out a relieved breath and doesn’t protest when Sam goes to grab Jack, wraps him up in his arms and tells him and Cas that he’ll take care of him.
“What-” he starts, as he sees the bundle squirm and move, and familiar blue eyes blink up at him from where a small Jack is bundled into his old jacket.
“Guys, I want to get Cas back as much as everyone. He is my friend, too. But this, this is exactly how we screw up every time. We jump at what we think is the best shot, and then it blows up in our faces.”
When the two other men frown at him in confusion, he explains: “The only downside is that the spell draws its energy from the caster’s OWN grace.”
Dean is about to wave him off, dismiss him, call him “Samantha” or just storm out of the room altogether. But when he breaks his gaze away from Sam’s and it lands on his phone, where the profile picture of Cas in that cowboy hat squints at him, head tilted, from the upper left side of the screen, he clenches his fist and lets out one sharp exhale.
Dean takes a deep breath. Man up, Winchester. He hears Sammy’s voice in his head: ‘Don’t let him be your ‘what if’, Dean’.
“Look,” Sam says and Dean really, really doesn’t want to do this right now, or ever for that matter, “We should really talk about this. We can’t keep up the fight like this. I mean, you’re beat, Dean. You don’t sleep, you don’t eat, the Impala has been collecting dust in the garage for days now. This isn’t you.”
“Hey, sunshine. You got your ears on?” he grumbles to the ceiling, his hand absentmindedly clutching the sheets on the newly unoccupied side of the bed.
“An exorcism?” Sam blurts out over the gurgling sound of the coffee machine. Jack is still rubbing his eyes with the arms of his shirt.
“I.. knew that we needed him. And I could feel you longing and reaching for him, and he was reaching back. I don’t know exactly how or why, but I was able to tap into that energy, that connection and he did the rest of the work.”
Dean’s head is spinning as he throws all caution and reasoning aside and uses his other hand to pull with all the strength he has left.
Dean feels him, though. Feels him the same way you’d feel a missing arm, a painful tingling and throbbing sensation where there once was something that has been ripped away. He feels him more acutely now than all those other times he lost him. These nights he feels the empty space next to him so painfully that it keeps him awake until the nightmares take over. Dean suspects that Sam knows Cas has stayed in his bed multiple times throughout the years, leaning back against the headrest, his legs crossed over the covers, his hands folded in his lap, while Dean fell asleep listening to his deep, soothing voice telling him about the wonders of creation, the twists and turns of the universe and human history. “Watching over him”, as he used to say.
It feels selfish to admit, but he can’t shake the excitement buzzing under his skin either, every nerve in his body screaming at him to do something, longing, aching to get his best friend back, one of the only people in the universe that he ever trusted himself to be vulnerable and honest with. He huffs at himself. Right, honesty. If he had been fully honest with Cas from the get-go, maybe he would still be around, because that stupid, sacrificial deal of Cas’? That is on Dean and Dean alone, on him and his idiotic self-denial, more focused on how others could perceive him, and so scared of all the ways he could have been rejected by the other man, that he continuidly deprived Cas of the feeling of being appreciated and loved, too.
“And you didn’t manage to say it back.” It comes out as a conclusion, not a question and not an accusation. Matter-of-factly, and if Dean registers correctly, empathetically.
As Sam raises his voice, “Surgas ex abysso, in lumine existas!” Dean hears the awful creeping and gurgling coming from that very wall as it did that night. Bile rises in his throat, tears flood his vision, and he wonders for one second if his knees will give in and he will sink to the ground and pass out, before the thick, black goo envelops Jack, whose eyes are closed and who gives his shoulder a reassuring squeeze before the touch vanishes.
Dean shivers as the black mass grazes his skin, but then Jack is gone, the wall is back to normal and Sam’s arms are there to hold him up.
Reluctantly, they call it a night. They shuffle to their bedrooms, Dean accepting a shoulder pat from Sam and gripping Jack’s shoulder in return.
His ears are ringing from all the things Sam is not saying. When he does speak (fucking finally), Dean glances over to find that he has his hands woven together on his knees, his gaze fixed intently on them for lack of anywhere else to look.
It must be close to sunrise when he tumbles through the hall’s, skids to a halt in front of Sam’s door, not even bothering to knock before he barges in with an equally excited and shocked “Sammy!” that has his little brother sitting upright in an instant, his sleep-sunken eyes covered by his messed up hair.
Jack shakes his head forcefully, effectively interrupting him and talking over Sam who doesn’t look pleased at all. “No, Dean. This is our best chance. It might actually work. And you are right. We are not letting him rot there for all eternity. And we have to do something quickly.”
“Because I love you, too, you stupid, ignorant, self-sacrificing son of a bitch. And I will say that to your face soon, so you better watch out, alright?”
Until they disappear out of the dungeon’s door, Dean looks after them, stunned, as Sam whispers encouraging and soothing words to little Jack.
When Jack nods, Dean swears he can see the golden of his eyes blazing up quickly as the smallest smile curls around the boy’s lips, and he can’t help but wonder when he was obviously left out of the discussion.
“So, why have we never heard of it before? If it’s easy enough to perform for you to suggest using it, it might have come in handy a couple’a times before, you know.” Dean raises his eyebrows. The day has left him exhausted to his bones, and while his body is restless with anticipation and fear about everything that could go wrong, and maybe already is, with their plan, he doesn’t know how long he can keep going.
Jack looks more determined than ever, his face set and his shoulders square, as he nods at Sam thankfully before the three of them gather around the cart to go over the details of their plan one more time.
“You good?” his brother asks worriedly. Dean barely manages a nod, staring at the wall as if hoping that Cas and Jack will just walk out of it like nothing ever happened, Cas with that stupid dorky trenchcoat and backwards tie and Jack holding up his hand in his signature salute.
“Uhm” Sam rasps out, downing the rest of his coffee with one swift motion of his hands and a scrunched up face. “Can we talk for a minute?”
That voice. Those two words. He never thought he’d get to hear any of them again, aside from the old voice messages on his phone he kept playing to himself over and over these past few days.
“No, Jack..” Dean sighs, rubbing his face with one hand. “Sam’s right. We can’t risk it. We have to find a better way..”
Dean nods confusedly, but still walks out behind his brother, a bounce in his step. Oh, he could get used to this emotional high, he loves knowing that they have a plan, loves the excitement blooming in his chest that comes with the anticipation of a big showdown, can’t wait to have Cas back and kick his stupid ass for -
“Getting you into the Empty is the least of my concerns, Jack, as is you finding Cas”, he remembers Sam saying when they were discussing their plan. “I’m more concerned about the two of you making it out of there once you have performed the spell. Without your grace, you both don’t belong there any more, that much is true, but if there even is a chance that the Empty lets you go, now that you’re no longer a threat to it, I don’t know if you will find your way back to us.” He had pointedly looked at Dean, then. “You are their strongest connection to earth, Dean. You have to do anything to keep that up.”
Dean, still rendered speechless, lets Jack wrap his tiny hand around his thumb. “So, he will be okay?” he asks eventually.
He is about to jank his hand back, when the other one grips it tight, holds on, pulls, and Dean pulls right back.
“I think so. Besides, he completed the deal. I don’t think the Empty would let him go, even if he tried. And I wouldn’t know how to reach him in the first place.” Still not looking at Sam or Dean, he says, more quietly now: “It’s just different this time around. I can’t even feel him anymore.”
Dean clears his throat, takes a breath in. “Let’s find that idiot and bring him home again, where he belongs. And then we will have a nice and very thorough family meeting about stupid decisions.”
Around 5 minutes to 7, a short, golden haired boy flopped down into the seat next him. This was the infamous Gabriel Novak, the local Trickster. Sam would be lying if he said Gabriel wasn't beautiful. Gabriel placed a coffee on the table, produced a can of Red Bull from his pocket and poured the entire thing into the caffeined drink, before turning and looking Sam straight in the eye.
Honey - this one was Cas' soft nickname for Dean, although he didn't necessarily use it privately (causing a lot of snide comments from Sam). He mostly used it whenever he was sleepy or simply exhausted.
By the time they got to the Bunker, Dean was dead to the world. Carefully, Cas slipped out the car carrying Dean; careful not to jostle him.
The golden-haired man turned around and Sam meet the guy's whiskey coloured eyes, this was Gabriel Milton; the other guy in charge of the law firm.
Gabriel has missed Sam so much. For the last month, Sam had been in Europe for his work and, don’t get Gabriel wrong he’s very happy and proud of Sam, but Gabe had really fucking missed his boyfriend.
“You’re back,” Gabe exclaimed, “sorry I wasn’t waiting for you; I just thought that you’d appreciate a coffee.”
"I'm sorry, he's had a lot to drink." Sam said to the guy, who simply raised his eyebrows and chuckled before carrying on through the bar.
Being human was hard for Cas, Dean could see that. Everything was completely new to the (ex) angel, but Dean was going to help Cas in any way that he could. This mostly came in the form of just lying in bed together, while Cas listened to his heart beat. He loved his angel, Cas was the best thing to ever happen to him.
“It’s all good, Gorgeous. Now how about we get the coffees, get Cas and Dean to take us home and just lay in bed together.”
"Are those bullies bothering you again? Gabe you need to tell-" Started Cas, turning to face his brother.
Dean's voice made Cas melt. Dean was perfect, he always looked after Cas and actually seeked his approval when choosing which songs to sing on tour. He missed his boyfriend so much and couldn't wait to meet up with him as soon as school was finished.
Dean smacks his hand against the back of Cas’s thigh hard enough to make the flesh quiver. His omega turns to the audience. Cas bites his lip as he eye-fucks one of the men. He must’ve winked at the guy because the man on the right end of the front row actually jizzes his pants and trips over his feet on his way out and down the hallway. Dean almost rolls his eyes when he sees the wet spot on the cushion. The alpha sitting next to the soiled chair loosens his tie and shifts a little to put some pressure on his full-blown hard-on. His eyes barely leave Cas’s toned legs as he croaks out an incoherent follow-up question.
At the mention of Ma and Pa, his lip quivered and he shook his head. "They kick me out fer bein' naughty. They says I's a bad kitty. Real bad." He didn't know if he was hallucinating but he swore he could see the man fighting an urge to cry. Dean couldn't look at his face. He stifled a flinch as the man called
"How do you feel?" Cas asked as he massaged the insides of Dean’s thighs. Legs open, his breaths uneven, the omega rolled his eyes.
"Alexa, play my Led Zeppelin playlist." The machine pings, and then music floods the kitchen. Dean hums along as he sways his hips to the beat. There's a stack of dirty dishes in the sink. Dean scrubs them clean before wiping down the counter and the stove. He cleans out the microwave, sweeps the floor, and takes out the trash. Suddenly, he feels the urge to reorganize the whole pantry. He clears it out, all the snacks and canned foods (gross!), medication bottles, bags of grains, and tea bags, and hot cocoa powder. He wipes down all the shelves of the pantry and starts replacing everything. He considers ordering mason jars, shelves, and drawers from Target or Marshall's, or TJ Maxx. He cringes at the thought; he's turning into one of those basic Pinterest moms who wear yoga pants from Lulemon, bake gluten-free cookies and muffins, attend all the PTA meetings, and make his kid eat nothing but organic non-GMO foods.
"Alright. How far apart are they?" He asked as he stretched an arm out and tried to help Dean off the bed. Dean draped his legs over the edge of the mattress and slid into his arms.
"Traffic, Dean. You know it exists, right?" Dean groans as he hops onto the counter and starts in on his nuggets.
Dean shook his head. The man chewed on his lip as if he were thinking. Anxiety seized Dean once again. He sat stiffly, tail stiff, afraid of the possibility of being thrown in a shelter. Instead, the man said,
“U-um, w-w-well...M-mister W-w-winchester,” he coughs and then says, “We will t-take your project into considerashhhh..” He trails off as he catches a whiff of Cas reentering the room with a glass of scotch. He turns and watches omega handing the drink to the man he was flirting with earlier.
It takes a while before someone in the back row clears his throat and struggles through his question. Dean gives him a vague and elaborate answer as some of the other men keep looking towards the door and fidgeting in their seats, waiting for Cas to return. The two alphas who had previously stumbled into the bathroom re-enter the room with dried stains on their crotches, waving and grimacing sheepishly as they shuffle to their seats. Dean pretends he doesn’t see their eyes sweeping the room in search for his sexy mate.
“You want me to get you a drink, handsome?” Cas leans into him,  his fingers running up and down the back of the man’s neck. The man shifts to put some pressure on his dick and lets out a shaky breath, nodding fervently. Cas winks at him and lightly drags his fingers across man’s shoulders as he saunters past him. The man shudders again and turns his head to watch his ass, licking his lips and moaning. The alpha who had started jerking himself off reenters the room and turns his head to stare at Cas’s ass as the omega turns a corner, sucking in a sharp breath and biting his lip hard. He stumbles over one of his colleagues’ feet and barely catches himself. Dean bites back laughter.
"Feet off the table!" Dean snaps. Jimmy blushes and quickly sits up. "Dinner's ready. Can you help set the table?" Jimmy sighs heavily.
“Cas, baby?” Cas turns to Dean, pulling the lollipop out of his mouth slowly enough for it to drag down his lower lip.
“Yes, baby. Daddy will take care of his pretty little baby. Now go shower.” He slaps his omega’s soaked ass. “Get that alpha stink off of you.”
When evening came, the sound of the front door opening wasn't enough to appease Dean's mood. Darren, who was just on the floor playing with his transformers, and Jessie, who was just scribbling in one of her notebooks, dropped what they were doing and barreled over to latch themselves around Cas's legs. Cas looked down and smiled.
"Babe, are you alright? What's going on?" His voice was deep and rough with sleep. Clenching his jaw, the omega tried to push himself upright, barely suppressing a whimper.
Cas stood at the bedside, encouraging Dean to do the breathing exercises again. The contractions were growing closer to each other. The nurses had checked his vitals and temperature before placing the fetal heart rate monitor on his belly. He was six centimeters dilated.
"Dean," he held his hand up, "it's no trouble. We have plenty of room and lots of food, and..." He trailed off, as though words were hanging off of his tongue, a fraying rope wrapped around them. Dean frowned as he contemplated his options. On the one hand, he couldn't trouble this beautiful man; on the other hand, he hadn't eaten in forever. Besides, it'd only be a matter of time before someone else found him and took him to one of those shelters.
He proceeds to describe the model of the project when Cas returns, carrying a silver tray of ice-cold glasses of water and a pitcher at the center. Like the good little omega he is, he had changed his outfit. Now he’s donning a sheer lace robe draped over a see-through lavender chemise. Underneath, he wore an expensive black bustier and a matching pair of thongs.
"Well..." Cas lightly punched his arm. Dean snickered and snuggled closer to Cas. "But seriously, though. If it weren't for you, I don't know what would happen. At this point, I thought you'd go mad and run away or something."
The contractions came faster, and he squirmed, a whimper escaping his throat. Castiel wrapped a hand around his wrist, suggesting that he call in a nurse. Despite Dean weakly waving him off, telling him between sharp gasps and grunts that he didn't need to trouble the staff complaining about some contractions, Cas pressed the call button. The nurse entered the room and lifted his gown to check his cervix.
"I-I-I don't wanna t-trouble you, Mister Cas. Yer nice and all but I'm real bad an' stinky an' loud an' I'on think you'd want me an'—"
"I heard you and Papa talking, kind of. And...I just want you to know that..." Dean watched as she twisted her mouth, making that face she'd make whenever she's contemplating something. She reminded Dean so much of himself in that sense. Like him, she was emotionally constipated, but Dean guessed that was what ran in the family. Dean had never been good at expressing his emotions, neither was Sam or Dad, even before Mom's death. Dean ran his fingers through her soft blonde hair.
The hospital was about forty minutes away. Cas drove as fast as he could, weaving around cars, going lane to lane, pressing on the gas pedal like his life depended on it.
"I need help with this question." He pulled a seat next to her. "Okay, what is the question?" As she read the question off to him and asked him, he found himself almost dozing off. He rubbed at his eyes and asked her to read the question again. He tried to help her work through the math problem, but whenever she got something wrong, she threw her pencil down and started crying. Dean rubbed at the temples of his forehead before getting up to grab himself an aspirin and a bottle of water. Next thing he knew, there was a loud thud from the playroom, followed by wailing. He jogged into the playroom, leaving Jessie in the dining room, crying hysterically over a mess of crumpled leaflets.
“Evening,” the investors mumble back as they leaf through the pages of their notebooks. Studious green eyes fixed on their worn faces, Dean undoes the lower buttons of his jacket and takes his seat.
The claws of his forelimbs buried in the tree bark, its rough skin pressing into the balls of his human feet, Dean climbed towards the thick branch. Though the squirrel was concealed by leaves, he could smell the warm sweet blood rushing through her veins. Her guard was down. She was vulnerable.
Dean didn’t even know he started to cry until his eyes felt wet and his shoulders shook. He turned to look at Cas through his tears.
Dean scoffed and fondly rolled his eyes, trying to pretend he wasn't blushing. “Dear God, Cas, you’ve always been one sappy motherfu—” he cut off with a pained cry as he was hit with another contraction. A nurse who was jotting down notes immediately paged the obstetrician, notifying him that he was ready to push again. The obstetrician arrived in record time as the nurse guided Dean back onto the bed. The OB lifted his gown and looked up at Dean.
He starts handing out glasses of water, making a point to brush his fingers across a few biceps. Dean wanted to laugh at the way they all looked like a bunch of twelve-year-old alpha boys watching porn for the first time. Pathetic mewls and gasps fill the room as they squirm and try desperately to catch a glimpse of his panties from behind.
"Welcome to the world, Emma Marie Novak-Winchester." He pulled her close to him and nuzzled her head. He cooed at her, Cas by his side. Emma slowly started to blink and looked at him with beady green eyes. His breasts started to feel tender. He brought his nipple to her mouth and watched as she latched and suckled.
he tried to tell himself as his breathing became shallow. The contractions were starting to get sharper, harder. He let out a shaky cry.  Cas came back in with a cup of ice chips. Scenting the stench of a distressed omega, the alpha rushed to his side, taking his hand into his own.
"I fawwed dowwnnn!  I was gon' go pwayin' wif my toys an-an-an' I fawwed doooowwwwwwn!" Dean gathered his boy into his arms and took him into the kitchen to get an ice pack.
He pushes himself off the edge of his desk to shake their hands and make some tedious small talk. Cas is tucked away in some corner right outside, ready to execute his portion of the plan. His omega is willing, of course, for more reasons than Dean is comfortable with. He gestures towards their seats politely before going over to lean against his desk, one leg crossed over the other. He watches the other alphas take their seats, drinking in their appearance. All of them were pathetic looking in their late thirties, mid-forties. Three of them were moderately fit and handsome, but the other five were fat in the stomach and balding.
"D-dean." He finally answered. His voice was rough from both exhaustion and dehydration. The man's eyes surveyed his body, concern, anger and sadness flickering in his eyes. He swallowed hard before speaking again,
At that comment, Cas smirks and sways his ass teasingly, slightly curving his back as he stretches out to pick up one last piece of paper far away from him. One man seated at the far left of the back row unzips his pants with shaking hands and pulls his dick out. He leans back and parts his legs slightly to stroke himself.
"I said in a minute!" He set Darren on the counter and went to the freezer to grab an ice pack. Thankfully his boy didn't hit his head or anything. He wrapped it in a paper towel and asked him where it hurt. As he started to patch Darren up, he heard Jessie in the dining room hopping off the chair and running off into another room. He pouted.
They continued to eat in silence. Dean wondered if Cas had someone. He didn't smell mated. But Cas was a human, a pure human; wondering such things about him was inappropriate. Dean was grateful the man took it upon himself to feed him, even though he didn't have to. Still he wondered. As handsome Cas was, he had anyone falling at his feet, tripping over their feet to impress him. He couldn't possibly be single. The thought inspired a pang of jealousy in his chest. He couldn't understand why.
Dean's breath started to pick up. He could feel his cheek throbbing, tasting iron against the tip of his tongue. Suddenly, his heart is fucking racing and buzzing. His head spins. Everything around him becomes too dark, too light, to loud! It didn't help when Darren came running to the bathroom to bang on the door because he wanted to play with Dean's phone again. After fifteen minutes, he finally managed to collect himself and head out of the bathroom. He tried to help Jessie with her homework again but then she just tore the worksheets and leaflets up in a fit of frustration and ran out of the room. Dean had to clean up the mess and make a mental note to himself to contact the school.
A few minutes later, they both had large burgers sitting in front of them. Dean had seen hamburgers before. Ma and Pa would sometimes bring home bags from a fast food restaurant. When they were feeling generous enough, they tossed him a few fries, maybe a piece of the patty. It wasn't enough, but he was thankful he at least got food. Dean reached for his burger, tentative at first, unsure as to rather it'd be polite to start eating or not. But the man nodded, giving him the go-ahead. Dean just grabbed the burger and tore into it. The meat was warm and moist and tasty. It wasn't as bloody as he was used to, but the flavor was almost addictive. He didn't realize how sloppy and ungraceful he was being until he saw how Cas was watching him with a strange look on his face.
Darren wailed from all the way in the living room as Dean tried to clean up the spilled gummy bears. Cas and Dean's two-and-a-half-year-old son had decided to rip open a bag of gummy bears and dump it all over the floor after asking for—no,
“Okay, it looks like the head’s fully out!" a nurse called. He pushed again until the baby practically slithered out of him. Dean could hear a shrill wail as the nurse positioned his hands under the baby and guided her out. The omega pushed a heavy sigh of relief as he sagged against the pillow, only to feel more contractions. That strong impulse to push returned. He worried he would shit the bed right there.
"Hey, Dean. You looked awfully upset when I came home. What's wrong?" Dean pressed his tongue between his teeth. He couldn't be a burden to Cas. Not anymore. It wasn't until he felt Cas brushing a thumb against his cheek that he realized he was crying. Sobs broke out, punctuated with hiccups, and then bubbled out until they came pouring like a waterfall. Cas encircled Dean and pulled him to his shoulder. Dean turned to press his nose to Cas's scenting gland, trying to inhale Alpha's scent.
“I like to play hide and go seek, but I ain’t got friends and my ma and pa ain’t like me much, so I always play by myself. I heard about when I was watching the TV one night while my masters was sleepin' and saw some human kids playin’ it on the TV. It was a funny show.”
"It's just the placenta," the OB reassured him. He could barely see it between his legs, but he saw part of the heavy and bloody mass that had spilled out of him. When Dean got a closer look, he could see that there was a long cord attaching the placenta to the baby. "Am I done now..or is something else gonna come out of me?" He could feel some blood leaking out from between his legs. He watched as the OB used a clamp to cut the umbilical cord. Their daughter continued to howl as one of the nurses took her away to weigh her.
"Alright, alright. Come on.” Dean allowed himself to be guided to the bathroom, sagging against Cas’s hard body. His clammy palms clung to the fabric of Cas’s t-shirt as he gripped his shoulder. His knees felt as though they were going to fold under the pressure of his stomach.
“Sorry,” Cas starts, “but this,” Dean, along with the other alphas, chokes as the cellulite ripple under the skin when he claps the investor’s hands over himself, “is for investors only.” He leaves another lingering kiss on the man’s lips before pushing the man’s hands off of him and getting up slowly to strut back to Dean. Dean nods approvingly at his omega and fondles his backside. The man his mate had just kissed sits there, slack-jawed, lips swollen and the front of his pants completely soaked and plastered to his lap. The poor bastard looks like he’s about to cry or pass out.
"Thank you, Alpha. You always know what to say." Cas smiled and turned to bury his nose in his hair.
Cas takes a younger alpha to the side and flirts with him. The alpha trips over his words trying to flirt back as the sexy little twink bats those big blue eyes at him and unbuttons his shirt to play his fingers over his chest hairs. The man stutters, breath hitching between words, and eventually gets flustered. Cas takes pity on him and saunters off after pressing a chaste kiss to his cheek, leaving the man rooted to the spot with his jaw open and face flushed. Benny has to guide all of the dazed and horny alphas out of the mansion. The office, the halls, and the foyer reek of lust, sweat, drool and alpha spunk. Cas inches towards Dean and pulls him in for a deep and languid kiss. The alpha grabs his angel’s hips and pulls him closer to deepen the kiss. When they finally pull away, Dean mumbles, “You did good today, baby,” as hooks his hands under his mate’s ass and squeezes. Cas drags his tongue over the alpha’s bottom lip.
Suddenly, he felt the small of his back crashing into the rocks and ridges on the ground. The pain jerked him back into the real world. The dulling fog around him, the chill, the sounds of all the critters scurrying in the brush, disturbing the leaves. He sat up gingerly, wincing in pain. Once he was on his feet, he limped away from the tree as he heard the squirrel scurry away.
"Alright, hun,” she spoke softly, releasing his gown, "looks like you're fully dilated and effaced. The baby's not visible, so it's not time to start pushing yet." Dean nodded, tears blurring his eyes, as the nurses swarmed around him. His head pounded so Cas left to get him another cup of water.
"Come on, you little shit! Get. Out!" he grit out. The contractions stopped. He lied there limply, legs wide open, gasping for air as a beta nurse tried to help him shift into a different position again. At some point, Cas had to help him out of the bed and had guided him to walk around. Dean held his mate's arm in a crushing grip, leaning heavily against his alpha’s side, because his legs still felt wobbly. More liquid started to trickle down the inside of his leg. Cas turned to him.
“Oh, Daddy,” the omega moans against his lips, “you get me so wet when you talk like that.” The alpha growls again as he slips his hand under Cas’s panties and presses his fingers into the dripping wet hole. He groans as Cas arches into his touch, moaning.
"Why did you push him?" he asked Jessie, who was sitting on the couch, pouting. She didn't even bother looking at him. Dean had set Darren in the playroom with all of his toys. Dean didn't have time for this; he needed to study for his test. He huffed.
he wanted to say. But he knew he couldn't say that. It'd remind the kind man of what an abomination he really was. Instead he answered, shrugging as he looked down at his feet and, fisting his tail, "I'on know. They ain't fed me much."
"Alpha, I'm not good enough!" Dean choked out. "I'm fucking horrible. I yelled at Darren today and I...and Jessie got into a fight at school and..." Dean's shoulders shook as he babbled. Cas turned to press a kiss to the side of his forehead. Part of Dean wanted to push him away. Yell at him and tell him to run. But he couldn't find it in himself to do so. He just laid there, shaking uncontrollably in his husband's arms. He wanted to be selfish, for one minute. Cas was too pure. Too fucking pure.
"Do you know how hard it is to pull yourself from a panic attack? Believe me, I've had them. And they're draining. Emotionally, physically. It's dehydrating, and it's hard....and yet you pull yourself out of it, and you continue to love and care for our kids. Your heart is strong, and our kids, they love you so much."
“Probably Sweetheart, but when it does you come and find me okay?” He replied, striking Cas’ back with one of his hands. “Do you know what might’ve caused this?”
Dean was exhausted. This hunt had drained him of all his energy. As he slowly trudged towards the car, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder, halting him in his tracks.
"Yes Angel?" Dean used this nickname to constantly remind Cas that he was his saviour and would always be his Angel; whether it was literal or not.
He was dead. Dean couldn't believe it, he failed. He was always meant to look after his younger brother, but it hadn't been enough. As Sam had laid there barely breathing, he made Dean promise not to danger his life to bring him back. Dean had agreed, he didn't know why, but Sam had pleaded with him and he had to make his brother feel relaxed.
Gabriel was drunk, extremely drunk. Sam watched as his husband drunkenly attempted to make his way back to their table, after singing karaoke for the last 45 minutes. Gabriel eventually made his way over and draped himself over the tallest Winchester.
Dean has been the best. Waking up and being held by or holding him was probably his favourite part of the day. The elder Winchester always tries to make him feel better or distract him by watching a documentary about something Cas knows Dean finds boring, but he knows it makes Cas happy so he does it. Dean's great but...
I re-wrote this about 10 times. How is everyone? I just found out that my countries going into lockdown again, but we still have to go to school anyway. And I wrote this with puppy trying to climb all over me so sorry if there are any mistakes.
"Yeah that and the fact that they gave us a class at this ungodly hour," smirked the Trickster. "You're Sam Winchester, right?"
Angel - Cas never really understood why Dean called him this; I mean Cas was well aware of what he is, but Dean always had this soft smile whenever he called him this. More commonly it was used as 'you're an angel' or 'you're my angel' but he counted it as a nickname anyway.
"I'm going to die," was all the golden-haired boy said before downing the entire drink. Sam raised his eyebrows at the smaller boy, before asking,
“It’s fine Sweetie, I’ll always help you. Love you so much.” Sam said as he pulled Gabe into his chest.
Basically closeted musician Dean whose dating Cas (a teacher) and Dean sings a song for Cas. Disclaimer I do not own this song, it is Secret Love Song Part 2 by Little Mix but I can't write songs and this is a really beautiful song.
Wow me writing two fics in one day. Also Cas’ panic attack is inspired by my own. My breathing often becomes short and I don’t like small spaces or people near me.
Did this mean Dean didn't want to hide anymore? Cas' heart was practically leaping out his chest, he loved this man so fucking much.
Sam was also missing Gabriel, the archangel had been in Heaven a lot recently and the younger Winchester had not seen him for a week.
And with that Dean moved onto the next song. Cas smiled, he couldn't fucking wait to see his boyfriend.
"No you don't need to apologise; just tell me when you're scared or upset. Now how about we watch some films with headphones and cuddle until it's over."
Cas rolled his eyes at Gabriel, before turning back towards Dean and smiling and then leaning forward and whispering something in Dean's ear who laughed and passed a small piece of paper with what looked like a phone number. Which reminded Sam.
“Pl-please l-l-leave me alone,” stuttered the archangel. “No please, don’t hurt me I’m sorry I won’t do it again.”
Castiel and Dean both loved using nicknames, it was one of their ways in which to show their love for each other in one simple word.
The sunlight slowly made it way into the room accompanied by a light breeze from a forgotten open window. Dean was contently warm and could feel something solid leaning against his back. Rolling over, he felt soft hair tickling his chin and couldn't help the big smile that captured his lips when he saw who was lying next to him. Instinctively, he wrapped his arms around the former angel (this was the first time they had woken up in the same bed) he could get used to this.
"So, this is a new song I wrote recently," he said with a charming smile."It was written about someone very special to me and I would like to perform it for you guys."
"That's even better!" Sobbed Gabriel. "Hey, Sir. This beautiful Moose is my husband!" Shouted the smaller man, as he grabbed onto a stranger's jacket as they walked past.
As Cas pulled up to school, Gabe's stomach began to fizz nervously. He could see them standing at the entrance, Azazel, Alistair, Lilith and the rest of them. They'd wait until his brother was gone and then they'd start with the words and occasionally the punches.
Dean's face became quietly shocked; Cas got up and pressed a small kiss to his cheek before walking out to go find Sam.
Sam meets Gabe, who is crying, in a bathroom. Today hasn't been a very productive day today, the only thing I did was watch an Oasis Documentary; I didn't sleep last night, so sorry if there are any mistakes in this. And I fucked up painting my nails, future note for myself, don't paint your nails red.
In this universe, they are happy. They have each other and a family. They are deeply in love with each other and every night Dean thanks his lucky stars that this amazing man is his husband. He never imagines that there could be universe where he isn't.
"I'm going to come in Sweetheart." Dean opened the door to the bedroom and spotted his boyfriend on the floor curled up; his heart broke. He hated seeing his boyfriend upset because Cas didn't deserve it, he was the kindest soul Dean had ever met. Carefully, he approached the raven-haired man and crouched down in front him.
Sam was never for arguing and happily pulled his adorable boyfriend into his arms with a smile. This was his happy ending.
Wearily, he made his way over to the car door and carefully got in, mindful of any bruises or scraps he may have.
"C'mon Babe, let's get you to bed." Smiled Sam, wrapping his arm around the golden-eyed man's waist; who seemed to be humming a Rick Astley song.
Castiel was scared. Yes an ex-almighty Angel, scared. But he didn't know how to handle being human, it was difficult. So many bodily functions to take care of. Oh, and don't get him started on the emotions. Some days were great, some were alright and some were completely shit. However, there were certain things he enjoyed about being human. Like having in depth and interesting discussions with Sam about the human world or learning how to bake with Jack (that didn't always go well) and, his personal favourite, going out on dates with Dean.
Cas’ eyes seemed to grow bigger at Dean he approached and he moved back from the approaching hunter.
The line was fairly long, which was kind of a good thing; hopefully by the time he got back Sam would be landing.
"Orphic," said Cas softly, " it means mysterious and entrancing; beyond ordinary understanding - it reminds me of you."
"Dean get up, we're going to be late!" Sam shouted up to his brother. Again, he was at a new school and to be honest he didn't really care about making a good impression; I mean they'd be gone in the next couple of months, but still didn't want to be too late.
The angel then slid into bed next to the hunter and pulled him to his chest. Dean broke down and began to cry, clutching at Cas' shirt.
"I knew there was no way you could've been here all the time, I wouldn't be able to forget a face like yours," smirked Gabe, "oh and I'm Gabriel Novak."
Sam was dying, he knew he was. He'd been stabbed all the way down his spine, he knew this was it. As he collapsed to the floor, he could see Dean shouting in Cas' arms. Sam could feel the pain shooting up and down his entire body. Then he felt someone pulling him onto their lap and looked up to see Gabriel with his eyes full of tears. Slowly and weakly he reached out and brushed a piece of hair from Gabe's forehead.
"You're never an inconvenience Bee and you can tell us anything. I know me and Sam don't show our emotions much, but that's just what Dad taught us. I want you to show how you're feeling as much as you can and I promise to try and do the same. You'll never walk alone Cas, you've got me, Sam and Jack. Hell, even Rowena will probably help you if you need it."
Dean turned round at his presence. He could tell something was wrong with ex-angel, he was shaking and breathing quite quickly, his eyes were darting around the room and his hands gripped the kitchen counter quite tightly.
"Well Sam, I don't know about you but I'm a bit exhausted; you wanna come and get some food with me Samwhich?"
All 3 of the men turned round at the sound of the voice. Sam immediately recognised the figure as being Gabriel and smiled. Cas also obviously knew the guy, as when he saw who it was, he give a slight roll of his eyes, before leaning over and placing his forehead on Dean's shoulder (who totally didn't blush).
"Yeah, of course Samwhich. Why'd you ask?" Said Gabriel, as he gave a soft giggle at the nickname he'd given Sam.
As Dean powered through the next verse and chorus, Cas could see and hear the emotion Dean was feeling. He knew the latter was singing for him; sure Dean had written songs about Cas in the past but he doesn't think he's seen Dean sing about him with such vulnerability.
It must've been 3AM when Sam woke up. Gabriel was wide awake, curled in on himself, shivering and quietly muttering.
Why couldn’t he breathe? Was he dying? His breaths where getting shorter and shorter. Everything felt small and tight. He needed to tell someone but he couldn’t speak.
Bumblebee or Bee - this one was mostly for teasing but also a cute one Dean used privately (away from comments from Sam). Cas slightly reminded him of a bee - you know extremely underrated. Cas always tried not to smile whenever Dean used it (cause usually he was teasing the angel about something) but couldn't help let out a small smile.
And here is a sad Sabriel story. Not related to the previous story, but I have been mean to Sam again, I'm sorry.
However, this is one of days when he has to cry. Everything has been boiling in him for so long and it's reached it's climax; he has to let it out. Currently, he is sat in his and Dean's room, curled up in the blankets. To be honest, he has no idea as to why he is crying, which makes him pathetic cause only babies do that, right?
Sweetheart - this was used whenever Cas was upset or scared. Often after a bad hunt, nightmare or panic attack. Dean used it as a gentle word and calmed Cas down with it.
“Yeah Gabe, why don’t you go and get him a coffee for when he lands; I’m sure he’d appreciate that.” Dean agreed.
"I'm bisexual and have been in love with this man for 3 years; I'm not going to tell you his name yet because he didn't know I was going to do this." Dean laughed, "but I don't want to hide who I am because every time somebody steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better place."
"No you're not, I'm officially banning you from any more research and command you to come and cuddle with me." And before the taller man could reply, Gabriel was dragging them back to their room.
"Mr Novak, can we please watch it; it's nearly Summer and we aren't really doing anything." This student was Jo Harvelle who actually knew about Dean and Cas, due to being a family friends; she knew he'd say yes.
Astraphobia - the fear of thunder and lightning, I used to have this, but we go camping every year, so I got pretty used to them. Now I'm just scared of fish, clowns and small spaces.
"Cas?" A calm voice floated into the room. Great now his boyfriend was going to laugh at him. Castiel loved Dean, the latter always looked after him. He could always calm Cas down and make him feel safe.
Sighing, Cas decided he would go out for a walk and after he got dressed, he pulled on his trench coat, he put his hand in the pocket and pulled out a black box with a post  - it note stuck on it. It read 'Sarang - the feeling of wanting to be with someone until death.' Cas opened the box and inside was a ring; a simple band with the word 'Angel' engraved into it.
"Sam!" Called his brother once he saw him. "Come and meet Cas!" As Sam got closer he noticed that the two boy's pinkies were curled around each other.
Baby - this one Dean used a lot more possessively. If he thought someone was getting too comfortable with Cas, he'd slip the nickname in there. Cas didn't care much for this nickname - sometimes it annoyed him because Dean should know that he ain't leaving him and that Cas can handle himself (but sometimes he did find it cute how protective Dean got).
And with that Azazel slapped Gabe across the face, before Alastair kicked him in the knees causing him to fall.
There are days when not even Dean can improve his mood. Days when he doesn't even want to get out of bed. Those are the worst days ever, he tries to disguise these feelings; he doesn't wish to inconvenience anyone. He tries and says he's fine and tries not to cry in front of others, cause that's what humans do, right?
Truth be told Gabriel didn't want to go to school. He didn't want to have to listen to the bullies stupid chants as walked through the school halls.
