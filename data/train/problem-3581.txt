“Then pull it out, it’s okay, Dean.”
He really didn’t want to mess this up. Dean wanted to be good for them, to be what Castiel deserved. But since he had never done suspension, he felt inexperienced and was afraid that he wouldn’t be as good as the Subs Cas had had before him. Which was a problem that Dean had never had before when it came to things like sex. It felt odd.
Even though Jimmy didn’t know how this ring should make Dean feel good, he walked back towards his previous spot in front of Dean and knelt down. Before he put it on, he spread a few drops of lube around the inside of the ring and then gently grasped Dean’s slightly erected cock with his hand to slide down the cockring without resistance. Once the ring was in place, Jimmy couldn’t help but trace the steel with a finger, his hand going down between Dean’s thighs to touch where it sat snugly around his testicles. Then he grabbed the glans ring and put a bit of lube to the inside as well, before taking hold of Dean’s cock again and stopping. While he thought about how this thing should be put on, he could feel Dean’s eyes on him the entire time and when he started to realize that he had no fucking idea how this ring was applied, he lifted his head to meet Dean’s gaze. There was an amused smile tugging at the corners of Dean’s lips and Jimmy began to feel embarrassed when the blonde held out his hand with his palm up. He didn’t even have to ask what he wanted, just placed the ring into his palm and watched Dean put it on himself. “Just make sure this thingy here goes to the frenulum ‘cause that feels good, and you’re all done.” Jimmy nodded and watched as Dean slowly pulled the ring back off and gave it back to him, and before he could ask why, Dean explained, “I can’t keep it on for too long and it not only stays on better but also feels best when I’m fully hard.”
Turning to his brother, Dean said, “What?! Is it my fault that the walls are this thin? Believe me, after that, I practically ran outta here. Grabbed some cheap breakfast and walked around town a bit.” Sam and Dean sat down on the couch then and Jessica followed with a slight blush on her cheeks. “You guys, it’s your place, do whatever you wanna, I don’t care. I’m just glad you’ll have me at all.”
“What do you have in mind?”
“Mmhh…” the blonde hummed with an amused smile and even tapped his chin with a finger to pretend he was pondering about it. “How about I give you a spanking for such ungodly behavior?”
“I get that. But if you’d want to have someone professional do the job, you could come by at the shop I work at. You’ll find a lot of talented people there.”
Grasping Dean’s face with both of his hands, Castiel assured, “We love it, Dean. It’s so beautiful and thought-through. It means so much to us.”
What if he fucked it up? What if he screwed up the only nice thing that had ever happened in his life?
“Then tell him!” It came out louder and harsher than he had wanted – Castiel was at the brink of losing his patience and control over his emotions. It must have intimidated Dean because, suddenly, he went stiff in his arms and didn’t answer. So, he tried again, his voice more patient and calmer now when he said, “I apologize, Dean. It’s just– this is very important. Communication is everything in a scene. Tell him to use the color system with you. Green go, yellow slow down and red stop. And I know I don’t have a say in that, but if he doesn’t change, he could seriously endanger your health, physically and mentally. You should consider looking out for a partner that suits you better.” Castiel felt like overstepping his boundaries, but he needed to make Dean understand. It was one thing to let him go at the end of this night again, but knowing that he would give Dean into incapable hands was another thing entirely.
They all shared a moment of silence, merely their harsh breathing breaking it, until they heard the door of the exit opening and closing again. Dean took a step back at that but still kept his hand on Castiel’s shoulder to keep the contact between them, and when Cas felt him tense, he lifted his head and looked forward. Michael was slumped against the wall next to them, pressing a piece of cloth underneath his broken nose to stop the blood flow. He looked like shit but Cas’ imagination still came up with more satisfying conditions for his brother, especially when he saw the amused smile with which he was staring at their group.
Speaking softly, Cas said, “I wish there was something we could do to ease your mind, Sam. I’m truly sorry this has bothered you the entire time but I can assure you that I’m not one of the extreme Doms. I don’t do life-threatening stuff, I even struggle to try things with Subs that they marked as soft limit. I don’t like beating, I don’t like whipping, and so I don’t do it. I am completely against total power exchange because my submissive is still my equal, and Master and Slave dynamics give me the creeps.”
Nodding, Cas took a step back towards the bed and directed his next words at Dean, “I want you to ride me.” When he looked at Dean to watch his response, the blonde was frowning slightly, his eyes slowly drifting down to his chest before locking on Cas’ once more, now confused.
There was sarcasm but also teasing in his voice and Jimmy chuckled. “You could say so. I very much enjoy what I’m seeing right now.”
At the sound of his voice, Dean seemed to lose all control of his body, green eyes blinking open to catch Cas’ gaze. He smirked while his teeth still clenched the pillow and let out a longer and needy moan as his hips began to stutter, giving a particularly hard thrust. And even as he moaned, Dean’s eyes sparked with humor and desire, a feral edge to the grin as he thrust his fingers deep inside and came, desperately riding through the waves of his orgasm with another throaty moan.
They’ve planned this all out before, every oh so little detail, so Jimmy knew exactly how this scene would progress. That didn’t change the fact that he was still very much nervous now with a few dozen people watching their every move, and it also didn’t change the fact that Jimmy was very much turned on, arousal had been spiking inside of him and waking his nerves and senses since the beginning of the scene. Watching Cas insert a sound into Dean’s beautiful slit and pulling open his hole with a speculum never ceased to increase his desire for Dean or make him
Leaning back against the counter, Dean shook his head slightly. “Nah, I was going to but I kinda didn’t find it in me to change clothes and be around other people yet.”
“I get it,” Dean said with a fond look on his face, “but I dunno about the whole giving thing… It’s not like I have anything to offer that no one else could.”
“Well, you laughing at my side like a jerk didn’t make that situation any better,” Sam complained, trying to hide his amusement by faking anger.
in place?” His smile widened mischievously and Dean nodded, looking almost sheepish now. “Try me,” Cas rasped, towering over Dean with his body, propped up on his elbows, and pressed his mouth down to Dean’s in a harsh kiss, licking inside as soon as Dean opened up to him and welcomed his tongue with a moan and dominating the kiss as he claimed his boyfriend, showing Dean who had the upper hand right now. His tongue was thorough and insistent as it slid against Dean’s, mapping out his mouth and cherishing it,
“Okay, wait. You don’t have to start with something big. Is there something like basics in BDSM? Like, I don’t know, typical stuff that’s cool with everyone? Doing the kneeling, presenting, not speaking stuff? That should be alright, shouldn’t it?”
After they had slept for about an hour, Dean had woken them up, telling them that he was planning on going to Sugar Pine Point Beach when the sun set to enjoy the view and go swimming, and they had ordered their dinner to the room. Not long after that, the sun had started to set already and Dean had practically dragged them to the Beach, constantly telling them that they couldn’t miss this.
He’s loved the younger, energetic, sarcastic and cocky – if not self-confident – man for quite some time now.
as his flat and open palm rained down on him, making him gasp. Castiel didn’t give Dean a lot of time to adjust before spanking him again and again, alternating between cheeks and putting a lot of strength behind it this time.
Again, Castiel had to calm himself down in order to keep his voice from trembling. “Please, tell me you safeword out of those situations?”
After he was fully dressed, he set his mind on getting to California to keep his thoughts away from what had happened and got the fuck out of that hospital.
The answer wasn’t at all what Jimmy wanted to know and when he stood and saw that Cas was still going, though gradually getting slower as if knowing he was approaching Dean’s limit, he couldn’t be in the room any longer or he was afraid his heart might get torn out of his thorax. He couldn’t stand Dean being in pain, let alone watch his brother cause the pain, so he turned his back to them and walked up the stairs, shutting the bedroom door behind him and throwing himself into their bed.
“You’ve been so honest and patient with me. You do everything for me and I’ve never felt so good and–and welcomed. And what can I give you that others can’t? I can’t even be honest with you…” Dean sat up between Cas’ legs and cast his eyes down on the couch.
And here they were, opening the trunk to retrieve the exact same bag Dean had packed in the morning along with Jess and Sam’s bags and a few things to eat and drink.
While he calmed down from the high, his heartbeat going back to normal, Cas let his hands roam all over Dean’s clammy skin, asking if he was still okay with his weight on top. Dean nodded and tried to meet his eyes from where his face was smashed into the sheets but gave up with a huff once he realized he would have to lift his head in order to do that, making Cas smile.
The slick, wet sound of their hips colliding with abandon filled the room thereafter, and Jimmy grew dizzy from merely watching Cas fall apart as he took his pleasure from Dean while also making the blonde feel good.
“I’m not sure… every time I think about it, my body tells me it’s wrong to pull out.” He couldn’t possibly explain it right. It was like every cell of his body protested the thought alone and pulling out was nearly impossible. But then he thought of Dean and his eyes widened as he asked, “Should I do so?” It hadn’t even come to his mind that this could be uncomfortable for Dean. He felt bad for it and averted his eyes, about to shift and pull out.
Castiel went silent then, his expression changing from anger to one of sympathy and understanding. His eyes were fond and Jimmy knew Castiel felt the same as he did.
cross my limits and it also wasn’t too much for me, so don’t start making up new excuses to call yourself a bad Dom ‘cause you’re not. And you have no reason at all to beat yourself up over something that isn’t even real, Cas. You dropped, that’s it. Sure, my ass is still hurting like a bitch but I knew what I was getting into and as exhausted as I felt last night, it had been freaking incredible. Quite possibly the best sex of my life. And I’m sure the extra swagger I put to my bow-legs now doesn’t turn you off the slightest.”
“Cas, you’re a great guy. All caring and loving and honest. And you’re a Dom, which is fucking awesome. And you were the sweetest guy I’ve ever met and I… I’m just some beat-up jerk, incapable of giving that back. I’m no relationship material and that’s not what you deserve.” He changed the side of the ear and pressed the cell against his left one.
It’s the last chapter and we’ve got some very,
Chuckling at their boyfriend’s antics, Castiel teased, “You’re a real smooth man, sweetheart,” and leaned in to kiss Dean’s lips again before holding him close against his chest and pushing in to bottom out in one effortless glide. At least, that was what Jimmy thought happened, judging by the way Dean threw his head back and moaned into the open space of the empty beach.
“Beautiful,” Cas whispered, his eyes sweeping over his face and then further down his body appreciatively, “as always.” He was completely naked just like Dean and from what he caught out of his peripheral vision as he noticed someone shifting next to him, Jimmy seemed to be bared as well. When he tried to peek at his boyfriend from the corner of his eyes, Castiel’s hand tightened around his chin marginally and his eyes snapped back to his Dom’s instantly. They were hard but not unfriendly and Dean was reminded of the power he had over him right at this moment, and he shivered slightly, his lips parting to let out a quiet breath. “You’re mine, Dean. And when I talk to you, I want you to look me in the eyes and nowhere else.”
And that couldn’t be right, could it?
It was at that moment when Dean realized that a small crowd of people had gathered around them, not yet seeming to want to interfere but looking out for the moment they should, and Dean was unbelievably relieved when he saw them track every movement of Michael as the man got up on his feet again, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth before chuckling and saying, “You know, I should’ve been more insistent that day, kept you from leaving. I guess I just felt sorry for treating you like that, but then you went away and every other Sub I’ve had after you couldn’t compare. They all sucked. And I want you back, nothing’s gonna stop me today.”
Once they reached it, they got rid of all their clothes and jumped into the shower. It turned out to be more of a making out session than a real shower, as Jimmy backed Dean up against the wall to ravish him with his mouth while water streamed down on them, but they came out clean anyway.
“Well, how could I not after what you did for me? I never felt so good and relaxed – I still feel it deep in my bones… that deep-rooted satisfaction and relaxation. And I just wanted to do something nice for you in return, so I thought about what I could do to surprise you that we
Chuckling, Jimmy withdrew his lips from Dean and he barely kept himself from whining at the loss, but then those lips trailed a line of kisses up his pubic to his bellybutton, pressing a kiss into it. “Well, for now, you’ll have to do with only me while Cas watches. Is that okay for you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
because two were still in his palm. “I, uhh…” he rubbed the back of his neck with his other hand, looking down at his gifts as if too afraid to look at Jimmy and Cas, “I thought about getting you something else first, like a book and new vinyl or something, but I, eh, thought that would be too lame, so I got you these.”
Penetrating Dean hadn’t been an easy task and he had been as careful as never before as he sunk in an inch at a time, slowly but steadily, feeling Dean stretch and yield to him. The sight of his hole stretching to accommodate the width of him and the black dildo was so filthy and astounding at the same time, that Cas had almost blown his load before he was even all the way inside.
“Even though it was designed to conflict discomfort while wearing it close to your skin, a cilice is not meant to cause pain and damage to the wearer.”
Groaning in frustration, Dean turned onto his back and kicked away the sheets like a petulant child, but he was hot and annoyed. He stared at the white ceiling and willed it to come down on him but it didn’t – just stayed there and mocked him. His hands were clenched into fists as he tried to remember why he wasn’t able to sleep but he came up with nothing.
“Dean…” His lips were pressed against the back of Dean’s neck and he could feel the blonde shudder against his body, his hair standing where Cas’s breath fell to. He was thumbing at his slit once more and Dean was rocking his hips into it as best as he could with Cas holding him back. “Get on your hands and knees.”
Humming, Jimmy said, “You have very nice hands, I thought it was something less practical and dirty, like an artist yourself, or a freelancer.” After a short pause, he added, “Or– I dunno… a professional Submissive… something like that.” Jimmy had to admit that he had been thinking about this a lot and was ashamed to have done it.
“Don’t you remember?”
God, Cas was right…
Gulping loudly, Dean had to fight his voice from trembling as he started to tear up like some freaking wimp. “Stop fucking apologizing, Michael. Just tell me one thing,” he swallowed down a whole new kind of nausea as the thought crossed his mind, lowering his hand to hide it was shaking, “Did you do it?” His voice was oddly void of any emotion, just low and rough.
In front of him, Castiel snuggled closer to him and kissed his forehead as his hands simultaneously sought out Dean’s cock underneath the sheets and started stroking him to completion as soon as they found it.
Dean smiled weakly and gave a tiny nod.
Squeezing his eyes shut as a new wave of pleasure hit his system, Jimmy asked himself if he had said that thought out loud, but then he opened his eyes and locked them on Dean’s and he chuckled breathlessly, still more amazed by him than amused. “You’re something else…”
“All grown up now, huh?” Benny stepped forward and smiled at them brightly, making a ‘come hither’ motion with his hands and starting to laugh when Dean groaned quietly but stepped into his embrace nonetheless. “Happy birthday, cher. You look sharp tonight.”
Dean’s smile was almost audible when he assured, “Despite the fact that the waitress probably hates me, it was freaking awesome, Cas. Sure, that boner had been a pain in the ass but the sex and everything else made up for the unpleasant walk to that spot.”
“Mmm, quite a lot,” Castiel growled, dropping his mouth to the bruise and sucking lightly on the flesh before standing up all the way and handing Dean his, presumably, intentionally dropped towel. At their boyfriend’s smug smirk, Cas said, “You’re a tease, Dean.”
Cas nodded his head and said, “It looks longer than it is, believe me. I have longer ones in the drawer for prostate stimulation. This one here is just a typical one. I also have a few with a smooth texture, but I’ve learned that it feels better if it isn’t smooth.”
Grinning slyly, Dean put his mouth against Jimmy’s ear and whispered, “Humor me.”
Not leaving his spot behind Dean, Castiel straightened his back and started to peel off his clothes, nodding at Jimmy to indicate he do the same, and they soon found each other very much naked and aroused, roaming their eyes over Dean’s pliant and inviting body.
But then he remembered that Cas hadn’t allowed him to come yet and he was astounded by the sheer amount of control Dean held over his own body to be a good boy for him and comply. It was so hot, that Jimmy felt his cock twitch once more, spitting the last of his release into Dean and he sighed, stroking his lover’s sides and carefully pulling out.
Castiel found his place.
Or sometimes, Cas would excuse himself and take a walk outside alone since they lived close to a nice park when no one decided to join him, or he’d take a book and read it on the chaise lounge in the living room or on one of the sunbeds on their roof deck while Jimmy and Dean minded their own business downstairs. Sometimes, he’d just take a moment for himself and tend to all the plants they have in their apartment and see if new fruits and vegetables have grown in their little garden on the patio. He loved doing that and just take off his mind for a bit while sitting outside and checking the plants. But he also very much enjoyed the times when Dean would find him crouched down between greens and join him. The blonde would ask questions and watch Cas watch the bees with that adorable and fond smile that always graced his lips whenever he thought Jimmy or Cas did something cute.
Sitting here at this beach alone without any other people – which was a miracle in itself – and enjoying the view now, Jimmy had to admit that Dean had been right. It was absolutely stunning. The water was still, the glow of the sun painting the entire scenery in shades of red and orange, its colors dancing across the surface like liquid glitter. Trees surrounded them and made this spot feel a little bit secluded and a little more secure.
“I don’t think that’s a bad thing, Jimmy, I mean, you love Cas and that’s all that matters, isn’t it? That you have family, someone that loves and cares for you?”
“I’m not asking because I think you’re stupid, I’m asking to make sure you’re truly okay.”
They were giving him time to process, he realized, and he sniffled once, trying to get a hold of his emotions.
It was pink and had the shape of a tentacle, and the sight made his smile widen even more. He remembered how Dean had seen it in Gabriel’s shop and said that it looked as if it would feel pretty amazing with its texture and curve. Well, now came his opportunity to check if it really felt as nice as he guessed and Cas slowly pushed the dildo as deep inside of Dean as it went, watching as his jaw dropped open at feeling the coldness in his hole. His vocal reaction followed after the sensation had truly registered and the Sub arched his back as he pressed out a stifled yell, his hands clenched into fists and toes curled. It was a truly breathtaking sight and Castiel took it all in greedily.
Castiel smiled as their Sub visibly struggled to keep from making a sound while he squeezed lube into his beautiful hole. He reached out for the ice-cold glass dildo that Jimmy had prepared while he had used the crop on Dean and took a moment to stare at the piece.
And okay, Jimmy did
“No,” Cas grinned, leaning forward a bit to lock his eyes on Dean’s, “I just wanted to wait until I have your undivided attention and didn’t have to share it with the food.”
Keeping a neutral expression even though he felt like rolling his eyes, Dean assured, “Green, I’m sure, Castiel,” and watched as a small and pleased smile graced Castiel’s pale and plush lips.
“You don’t have to be sorry, Jimmy. It’s okay. I know this isn’t easy for you and you have the right to express your feelings, but I just want to let you know that I’m fine.”
There was a moment of complete stillness as Dean began to wake up, feeling oddly free of any pain or all the other things that usually bugged him 24/7. It was weird. And when he opened his eyes and blinked at the pale walls of the room, he wondered if he was dreaming. But then it all came crushing back like a damn freight train, nearly knocking Dean out again. The pain, his thoughts, memories of what happened, just
When the shaking of his hands lessened and his pulse got back to normal, Dean swallowed down the nausea and thought about all the things left to do to keep his mind off that trail of thought and the voice subsided.
And just like that, they spent the first five days of their two weeks together; waking up to Dean getting ready for work in the morning and enjoying the breakfast the blonde prepared for them, waiting for him to come back to surprise Dean with lunch and doing whatever they pleased the rest of the day.
Castiel had one rule, though, and that was not to come until he had used all four toys and Jimmy had had his first orgasm, so his whole concentration was focused on not coming too soon.
marks.” Dean averted his eyes as if ashamed at that and Jessica felt bad about that. She tried to soothe him by caressing his hand.
And then he pressed down a bit firmer into Dean’s bladder and made him moan, his cock twitching, and suddenly, there were soft lips caressing the skin of his sac and strong hands gripping his thighs for leverage as Dean enjoyed having Cas’ balls in his face. Even though heated pleasure coursed through his entire body while Dean’s mouth made him want to fuck his face, Castiel kept massaging Dean’s belly with loving and worshipping hands and watched as Jimmy started tapping his fingers into Dean’s pubic area and pressing and massaging the regions surrounding Dean’s leaking cock.
Jimmy hated to interrupt such a peaceful moment but he informed, “We can’t stay like that for long. Our table is booked for five and until then, we still have to get cleaned up and dressed.”
He listened to the sound of Dean’s calmed breathing, not sure when they came that close to each other. Even if the question hurt to ask, Castiel had to know. “When do you leave again?”
Dean smiled at the use of the emoticon and pictured Cas typing it as he hurried to give a reply as fast as possible. He sent it before he could change his mind.
Once he assured Cas that he was fine, Jimmy sat down and watched as Dean’s knees pulled up again and dropped to each side, opening up to his Dom. The sight was absolutely stunning and he already felt his body trying to get aroused again.
Chuckling, Dean breathed out, “Yeah… thanks… I’ve never seen it as anything I give my partners, rather than something they give me.”
“You two fill all those tiny spaces inside me and fuck new ones open for yourselves, creating space inside of me that no one else’ll ever be able to fill. I love how you praise me like a god but fuck me like the devil, and you fit inside me like you were made to… like you were made to fuck me senseless and if it were up to me, I’d keep you inside all the time. I want your hands all over me, want you to ravish me, do whatever you want with my body ‘cause it’s yours as much as it’s mine.”
Castiel wants to say something like
“Just so I know that we’re on the same page,” he started, his hand still stroking Dean tenderly, “are we talking about sex?” His answer to the question was a hesitant nod and Dean biting his lip, so, with his thumb, Jimmy pulled back the pink flesh and slid his digit across to spread the saliva and make it glisten before taking it between his own lips and slightly tugging it away from Dean with a smile. When he could see his boyfriend struggle to keep from grinning, Jimmy let go of his bottom lip and kissed him once more, licking into his mouth with a barely contained smirk. Pulling apart, he teased, “Why so shy all the sudden?”
“You had your tricks, I had mine, jerk,” Sam countered and made his brother laugh out loud once more.
Barely above a breath, Dean whispered, “I’m just a stranger, how can you say that?” His eyes were glassy and Jimmy was glad he had an excuse to look away because he didn’t want to see Dean like this.
Shaking his head, the blonde explained, “Had one again with the Dom right before Michael came along.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s no need, Jimmy. We won’t be on a stage tomorrow or anything like that. I just wanted to let you know that I was thinking about it so that, if you two were interested, we could start planning together.”
Jimmy smiled sympathetically and squeezed his knee before withdrawing his hand and saying, “He’ll be happy about it, I know.”
Actually, they’ve never really loved any of them like they should’ve been able to, which was the reason why cutting them completely out of their lives three months ago hadn’t been hard at all. Soon after what had happened with Michael, Cas and Jimmy had figured out that Naomi had known all along that Michael’s last fiancé had left him because of domestic violence. In fact, Michael had had a reputation for sexually harassing about everyone he found attractive and their mother had never done anything about it, so they’d decided then and there to cut all ties with their ‘family’.
Castiel was calmed down enough that the only sound leaving him was the occasional snivel as Dean took his hand and guided him into the bathtub, placing him so that they were facing each other when he lowered himself into the water as well, Jimmy sitting down on the edge of the tub to watch them silently.
Now Dean’s expression changed into a furious one and Jessica hated the way those two were just too stubborn to communicate properly with one another without ending up in a shouting fight, while all they wanted was to look out for each other.
Nodding sharply, the blonde whispered, “Yes, Castiel,” and then looked at Jimmy once more to repeat, “Yes, I’ll be good.”
“Believe us, you’re not inexperienced just because you haven’t tried this yet, Dean,” Jimmy assured, squeezing Dean’s shoulder once, reassuringly. “And there’s nothing wrong with being inexperienced in the first place. No one should ever feel insecure about that.”
“It’s weird, y’know…” Dean whispered in a soft and fond voice and followed Cas’ hands with his eyes. When Castiel asked him what he thought was weird, Dean peered at him out of a young, freckled face, its lines smoothed out by deep relaxation and bliss. He admired Dean’s long lashes fringing seaweed-green eyes in their dimly lit bedroom from this angle for a moment until Dean explained, “You have this cute fixation with my tummy– it’s just… weird, I guess, but adorable.”
When he finished explaining, Cas met Jimmy’s eyes and saw him nod in agreement. While this topic was a truly hard one and they understood that not everyone shared their opinion, – because it was still sex without consent, which was understandable, and it might go against their morals – Jimmy, Dean, and Cas still shared the same one. And as long as they kept it between them, only did it with Dean, who was more than just enthusiastic about this ‘kink’, and didn’t hurt anyone with it, acting on this desire to a healthy and mindful degree while always considering Dean’s well-being was just fine with them.
. “He died four weeks and two days ago.”
dragged me here, remember?” and snatched Dean’s bottom lip with his teeth to tug on it playfully, making Dean moan once more. He let go of his boyfriend’s dark pink and glistening lip and was about to say something more when suddenly, holding his gaze, Dean started to sink to his knees in front of him, his big hands sliding down Jimmy’s thighs as he continued to look up at him, his pants getting wrinkled in the process.
They chuckled and Castiel leaned over Dean’s shoulder, his hands gently tracing a line along the skin right underneath his collar, and brushed his lips across his cheek in a feather-light tease. Dean leaned into the touch instinctively. “Will you be good for us?”
Nodding in understanding, Sam asked, “Do you think he’d still react the same if he found out today?”
And then the car stopped – Castiel hadn’t even realized that they’ve arrived at the underground car park of their residential complex – and the silence that fell upon them once the motor was turned off was almost deafening and suffocating in its heaviness. None of them made a move to get out of the car and when Castiel turned his head, he saw that Dean was staring out of the window with a clenched jaw. One quick glance had him confirming that Jimmy was just as worried as him when he met his twin’s eyes in the rear-view mirror.
“I was worried about you.”
“Yeah, you’re not.” And Cas was back to thinking about the condom… There was a moment of silence where they merely stared at each other with a special heat in their eyes. Then, Dean shifted in his chair and said, “About Jimmy, he probably told you already, but… I confused him with you, too, and practically attacked him with a kiss because I was so happy to see you. I thought I’d never get the chance. And, ‘course, he didn’t know me so I thought you’d forgotten all about me until he told me he was your twin.”
“You mean his doll-eyes?” Charlie asked seriously, her gaze landing on Dean, who stared at her with a frown looking almost confused under the scrutiny. “With those apple-green orbs…”
“Yeah.”
Jimmy wrapped his arms around his middle, placed his hands on each of Dean’s asscheeks, and bumped their noses together as he leaned in to rest their foreheads against each other. “I can’t help it.”
Castiel smiled fondly, his eyes turning soft as he leaned in to press a kiss into Dean’s temple. “Of course, you can.”
“Is there a place that serves coffee and burgers? I’d really like to have one right now.”

He closed his eyes, and for a moment, the room went completely still except for the rustling of sheets as Castiel got into a comfortable position at Dean’s other side until Cas stilled and kissed a spot on Dean’s chest – probably right above his nipple – and sighed, “You smell good.”
It was just a sigil, nothing too challenging, so Jimmy went to prepare the machine and ink while trying not to dwell too much on the fact that he was about to really do this now.
Here's part two of our little vacation! And I should probably let you know that this chapter is a very dirty and smutty one (the dirtiest of all, if I might add), so beware of the warnings at the end. 😉
“But–”
“Stay with me, Dean. I don’t mean here in this bed or California in general, just…” He took a long breath and collected himself. This was important, he needed Dean to know how much he wanted this. “When you get back home, please don’t delete my number or change yours. I feel like I need you and I couldn’t bear not having you in my life after having had the privilege of meeting you, Dean.”
“Yes, Dean?”
While Jessica looked just as excited as Dean, Jimmy could see that Sam was turning worried eyes at his brother, seeming rather nervous. “Uhh…” Sam rasped, clearing his throat once and lowering his gaze as he muttered, “Yeah. We are. I asked her two days ago but I didn’t want to make it a big topic today ‘cause it’s your birthday…”
Grinning mischievously, Jimmy reminded, “
He was the single most beautiful thing Cas had ever seen and the rest of creation paled in the light of Dean’s elation. It was as if the blonde had breathed new life into Castiel as well as Jimmy and Cas had never been this excited about anything – had never been in love with someone this much. But it was more than how he made them feel; it was Dean. It was the sound of his voice when he sang his favorite songs – not always just classic rock – underneath the shower spray, thinking no one could hear him. It was the fuzzy, flustered looks he sported in the mornings and how he snuggled up to them in bed to make them stay a little longer. It was his unabashed love for food and the way he smiled at his own jokes.
Walking towards the drawer in which they kept their toys and equipment, Castiel listened to Jimmy repeat what he had said in the kitchen this morning, speaking in a low and rough voice that made it easy for everyone to hear just how affected he was by Dean’s display just then, and he smiled, pulling out shiny, black silk rope, an anal hook, a bullet vibrator, and a riding crop.
“I wouldn’t know,” Castiel replied honestly, “though I have to admit that you have a few feminine features in your face that I’ve come to love and appreciate.”
It was quite the opposite, honestly. Sometimes, Dean fantasized about being woken by his beautifully big cock pushing into him, his sleep getting disturbed as Jimmy fucked him lazily from behind under the covers. Yes, he knew, he was a kinky jerk but they were only fantasies anyway and he had never harmed anyone with them before…
Probably feeling his gaze on him, Dean turned his head again, hazy green eyes peeking out from underneath heavy lids, and grinned at him happily. He couldn’t help but return the smile and combed a hand through his blonde hair. “You like sunbathing, huh?” Jimmy asked softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not in the literal sense, of course, but thank you so much, Dean. It means a lot to us,” Cas breathed out happily, wrapping his arms around Dean and kissing him deeply.
“Well, we were all named after our great-grandfather so all Novaks have the middle name James. I call myself Jimmy because I don’t want it to be James and Emmanuel sounds just lame… I don’t know, it has always been Jimmy – it’s who I am. Cas was the first to call me that because Emmanuel was too complicated to say as a small child and everyone always called him Cassie so he wanted to give me a pet name as well.”
Stroking a hand down Dean’s side lovingly, Cas flicked his eyes up at his twin resting behind Dean and gave a nod once he met his eyes, indicating that he was allowed to take off the blindfold. The Sub let out a content sigh when he felt that someone was untying the knot at the back of his head and Cas leaned in to kiss his lips softly, and when their mouths parted again, he met Dean’s open and bright eyes, shining with unshed tears.
“You’re right,” Cas smiled sadly, “I’m feeling the same way about Dean as you do. There is this inexplicable pull that I feel towards Dean and I know that I have a problem sharing my partners. It has never been a true problem before, but I am very much aware of my possessiveness and I’m sorry that I let it out on you.”
“I want you inside me, Cas. Make love to me…”
Everything about this was breathtaking and amazing and Castiel had never felt more at home than locked inside of Dean, no matter how cheesy that sounded.
When they withdrew from each other this time, they didn’t start kissing again but kept standing the way they were. Dean’s chest was pressed against his and they could feel each other’s breaths fall onto their spit-slick lips. Especially Dean’s were shining beautifully and Cas couldn’t stop himself from letting his right hand wander up his body until it cupped the side of Dean’s face, his thumb sliding over the heated skin of his pink bottom lip in a feather-soft touch. His hot breath danced across Castiel’s thumb in a soundless moan as he pulled his lip down with his thumb just as lightly. Cas watched as Dean’s eyes fluttered closed and the sight stirred something inside of him. That something turned out to be arousal as Dean took Castiel’s wrist in his own hand and brushed his lips against Cas’ thumb in a whisper. It was so enticing, that Castiel let his hand slip down and he blinked a few times.
Quieter, Dean asked, “You don’t like torture devices right?” as if knowing the answer, which, really, wasn’t at all hard to guess.
After he brought back the cloth into the bathroom, Cas walked into his bedroom to grab two pairs of boxer shorts and went back to Dean, reaching out a pair and smiling at him. While he took on his own, Castiel watched as Dean slowly sat up straight with a hiss and placed his feet on the floor to stand next to Castiel, who was feeling a primal part of himself being satisfied at seeing Dean in his own underwear and knowing the blonde would still feel him for a while.
Distractedly, he rubbed his hands gently across Dean’s chest and stomach, watching the water slosh with the motion, and had to tear his eyes off to meet Jimmy’s gaze. “Hm?”
“She was raging and threw us out after dinner, which Cas and I were truly thankful for.” Dean breathed out a ‘yeah’ after that and Jimmy asked, “Did you? …have a rebellious phase or your brother?”
Though, Dean’s deep and slow breathing was what lulled him to a feeling of love and protection, combined with their current position, which, after all, managed to lull him to sleep.
He had no idea which one of them it was but he was pretty sure that Jimmy was currently driving him crazy while he traveled down his torso to let his breath fan out across his skin and heighten all of Dean’s senses. He traveled further down Dean’s body to turn every inch of his skin into goosebumps as he huffed his hot breath against the dip of his hip, then against his belly button and further down.
“Will do. Bye, Charlie,” Jimmy said, ending the call, and at the same time, there was a knock again. So he closed the space between himself and the door and unlocked it before opening it. As soon as it was open enough to reveal whoever wanted to see him, Jimmy suddenly felt very ratty in his loose sweats, bare feet, and grey tee.
they were two lucky guys to have found Dean.
, there you'll find every art piece of this story!
“It doesn’t sound as much, but it is as high as I’ll go for the first time in case something happens. And once you’re up, you’ll see that it seems higher.” Dean merely nodded and Castiel continued to sort the rope. “I’ll start with your legs, the rope will be bound right above your knees, then I will move on to your beautiful butt and secure rope just underneath your cheeks before the most important rope will be tied around the small of your back. Butt and back will be joined later to give you more stability. The last part is going to be your arms, which will be angled so that they’re almost crossed underneath your head to give it something to rest on, your hands bound together so that they’re resting between your shoulder blades.”
“Hey, sleepyhead,” Jimmy greeted, still smiling, and even Cas felt the corners of his mouth twitch at Dean’s answering groan. The blonde was
“‘kay, we’re here.”
This earned them a big, happy grin, and Dean closed his eyes with a contented smile, letting out a soft sigh before mumbling, “I’d like that.”
Afterward, they snuggled down on the couch together and watched a movie called ‘Double Jeopardy’, which, Cas had to admit, was pretty captivating. And since they weren’t tiered once it ended, they played the next one on the list called ‘Glass House’ during which they fell asleep on the couch like “old married people”, as Dean had put it during the night when they went into bed to resume sleeping.
Dean just shrugged, flicking his eyes from Jimmy’s to Castiel’s and back to Jimmy’s again. “It does?” Cas asked, perplexed, and leaned in to explain, “Everything is a first time at some point in everyone’s life, Dean.”
Dean smiled softly and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s knuckles. “Then put the collar back around my neck and show me.” Castiel shot up and out of the water like a mad man, surprising both Dean and Jimmy, and Dean chuckled, placing his hands on Cas’ arms to stop him. “But not before you assure me that you’re fine and this topic is over with now.”
It takes some time for Dean to understand what Castiel is trying to say, and when he gets it, the younger man just smiles a shy smile and reassures: “You’re not going to hurt me. And I don’t care about protection with you; I trust you.”
“Tired,” the blonde answered, lowering his eyes and fidgeting with his wristband. “And you two?”
Nodding, Dean said, “Yeah, I wanted to show him the area a bit.”
Then Cas withdrew from him and Dean felt him leave the bed, hearing footsteps. So he turned back around to watch his Dom walk towards their toy-supply and pull open the drawer, taking out the dildo he’d been talking about when they had planned the scene. It was a black silicon cock attached to a cockring, about seven inches long and five inches thick. Combined with Cas’ length and girth, it made for a super tight fit inside Dean, he already knew, and he swallowed thickly – if not hungrily – as the Dom walked back towards him only to stop in front of the bed and wrap his hand around the base of his cock, slowly sliding the cockring over his length and fitting it snugly around his shaft and balls. With the cockring in place, the silicon cock lay right above Cas’ own one and rested on his shaft, and when he stepped forward to get back into bed, both the real and the rubber cock bounced with each step.
Smiling softly, Dean nodded and stepped aside to let them in, saying, “I can’t believe you two did this for me…” He shook his head and closed the door behind Jimmy, turning around to face them. “If I’d known you were coming, I’d cleaned this place up. It’s a mess.”
When he straightened up and looked at Dean again, the blonde had a smirk and hungry eyes meeting his gaze. “Why?”
“Okay, think about this: Dean meets with Michael at an arranged time in a private room. There are lots of different ways to go about this now, there’d probably be some sort of foreplay, it could be teasing, edging, or anything. Let’s just go with teasing; Dean’d be teased by, say, barely-there touches or toys, whatever, until the Dom thinks he’s been ‘tortured’ enough and if he was good and did exactly as he was told, then they’d continue and, I don’t know– start having sex. And afterward, the Dom would take care of Dean and ensure that he’s alright.”
As if that hadn’t been enough already, Dean gave them a mischievous – and almost shy – smile before reaching his hand down between his thighs and sliding his fingers through Jimmy’s cum dripping back out of his hole and down his legs, only to gather some of it onto his digits and bring it up to his mouth to lick it off, moaning like it was the most delicious thing in the world.
“I’m fine,” was all they got as an answer and Cas saw Jimmy shrug his shoulders, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
At that, Dean made a humming noise and shrugged his shoulders, the corners of his lips tilting down in a little shrug as well, and Jimmy grinned at their boyfriend. Then he finished off his breakfast and licked his fingers, sucking at the tips a bit too long to not be teasing, and rasped, “Well, I’m all yours now.”
Turning his head to Jimmy, Dean said, “This guy must be rich, man.”
Cas seemed to like the food too since he was smiling and digging in like a man starving, which only made Dean smile brighter. And like that, their Turkish eggs were gone in no time and it also didn’t take long until the bacon was taken care of. When their plates were emptied, they exchanged them for the bowls and cuddled together even closer because the food couldn’t get any colder than it already was and they always took their time enjoying the yogurt after such greasy stuff.
Reducing them to babbling messes, making them sweat with pleasure and desire, and writhe underneath him. He could feel how greatly they wanted to touch him like they were usually always allowed to during sex, how much Cas wanted to fuck his face as he pleased, and how much Jimmy wanted to meet his thrusts. And just the fact that Dean was keeping them from doing so just because he had told them to, made him feel fucking powerful and desired.
“Should I walk you back…?” His thumb stroked a line down the side of Dean’s face and back up and he noticed just then that they were standing in the dark.
And he was so
A sly smile spread across Michael’s lips as he took another step forward, tilting his head to the side as if Dean ought to know the answer already, and with a deep and calm voice, he said, “My name is Michael James Novak. Seems like you’re the family whore–”
Dean would go out for a drink most of the night and if he was lucky, he would go home with someone else. Two to three times a week, he would spend at
Stuffing his hands into the back pockets of his jeans, Sam fixed them with a suspicious look and raised his shoulders. “I know this must be some new kind of experience for you two and I understand that it seems like a great opportunity to strengthen your bond by dating the same guy, but I swear… if you don’t mean this or if this is some kind of game to you, I’ll need you to leave, now.”
The three of them remained like that, hugging each other close and reveling in the moment, until Jimmy asked, “What about the food, though?” as if just realizing now that Dean had used this to keep them from coming home too soon and that he didn’t truly need them to make dinner tonight, and they burst into laughter.
After a moment, at the same time as the platter in the background stopped, Dean withdrew his head and slowly pulled off of Jimmy’s cock. The movement caused cum to leak out of the corner of his mouth, dripping down his face and along his jawline, and the sight was enough to get another spurt of cum out of Jimmy and he gripped his dick with another moan, leaking onto his boyfriend’s waiting tongue.
It was as endearing as it was sloppy and wet because Dean was already so far gone, but Jimmy knew how much Dean loved to have them in his mouth and he, in return, loved the feel of it, so he smiled and let himself enjoy it for a moment before leaning down to pleasure Dean with his mouth as well. Since Dean was already being stimulated by the prostate massager, which had him leaking into Jimmy’s mouth like a tap, he took it slow with his tongue, only lapping at his cockhead tenderly before pressing the tip of his tongue against his frenulum. He also took him into his mouth as far as Jimmy was able to a few times but otherwise held back with the stimulation on his cock to avoid overwhelming Dean.
When they stopped to take a break, Cas could feel Dean’s grin against his own lips and he leaned back to look at his lover, watching him bite his bottom lip. “What?”
“You really did, Dean,” Jimmy said, smiling brightly.
Jimmy slapped Dean’s chest playfully at his amused chuckle and warned, “Don’t tempt me, Winchester.” His breathing was still harsh and loud, though.
“I think I’m gonna let you two decide that and tell you afterwards what I’d be interested in participating, since I don’t have any experience or knowledge about that.”
“Nah, Jimmy and I took a shower together and I wanted to take a nap with him until you’re home.”
He walked out of the kitchen and went into his bedroom to search for his laundry while also watching out for his missing sweats, which were his favorite ones.
Shaking his head, Dean breathed out, “I need to tell you,” and Jimmy placed his hand back on his knee to continue stroking him and listening to his story. “One day, when I was 17, it… it happened. I remember being glad not to have Alastair looming around the entire time and when I went to the restroom to take a piss, I even let out a relieved sigh like the clueless idiot I was. So, imagine my shock when I went back to wash my hands and was grabbed by the neck and slammed into the wall opposite the basins with my back. Thinking about it now, it was just like the incident with Michael… Well, and of course, there he was in front of me with his face so close that I could feel his warmth, leering at me like a predator and pressing his body against mine to pin me there and I felt his hard dick poking my hip and barely held back the disgusted gag.
“It takes so long, Castiel,” Dean said weakly, trying not to divert his eyes. At Cas’ questioning look, he added, “My orgasm… it-it took so long the last time and I think I need another break so that I can collect a bit of strength for the last one.”
“Come on! It’s not that cold…” Dean said, laughing heartily.
“Hell yeah.”
Smiling softly, Cas picked up all the bottles and sticks, and soon everything they had brought here was being carried back into the house again, merely leaving behind the burnt wood in the fireplace.
Castiel has no idea how long they remain like this; it feels like ages. So when Sam finally gets to his feet again – Jessica rubbing his back and arm – he looks at Castiel, devastated, and asks: “di-did you know him?”
Cas made sure to capture Dean’s eyes with his own when he promised, “We’ll work this out together, okay? We’ll show you just how much love and beyond you are deserving of and that we want to give this to you… if you’ll let us.” Dean was breathing slowly, his lips slightly parted, and Jimmy found himself engrossed with his beautiful eyelashes again. From where he was standing, they looked impossibly soft and long. Then Castiel took both of Dean’s hands in his own and cradled them, pressing them into his chest and leaning forward to brush a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “Will you let us? Give this try?”
There was a soft smile on Cas’ face, the one he always wore when he thought Jimmy’s worry about Dean’s well-being was particularly heartwarming, and he nodded. “I can assure you that it is very much safe if you do it right, of course. It’s important to find the right size, even if you want to stretch it. You have to start small and work up to larger ones, logically. The toys have to be sterilized before using them and you have to be very gentle and slow.”
Laughing slightly, Dean whispered, “Flirt,” and went back to stuffing yogurt into his mouth. So, Jimmy and Cas dug back in as well and they ate the rest of their breakfast in companionable silence while they focused their attention on the TV in front of them.
“Dean–” Cas began to say but was immediately interrupted by his boyfriend, who was getting really agitated in his speech. “That’s why I slept on the couch. I didn’t want to be close to you because I felt like filth and like I didn’t deserve it. And I couldn’t sleep at all because I was mentally preparing myself for being thrown out of your lives, and that voice said it was your damn right. And y’know… it is.”
“Nah, he’s good. It’s just Sam. My sex life has never been his favorite topic, but don’t worry. He’s fine with us, he’s fine with me being bi and a Sub, and he’s fine with you two.” Then, Dean looked down at his crotch to where the crackers were resting and seemed to be deep in thought. A frown formed on his face and he mumbled, “Maybe he got that from dad…” scratching his eyebrow before asking out loud, “Anyone thirsty?” It had Jimmy realizing that he wasn’t meant to hear what Dean had said and that it had only been a thought spoken out louder than intended.
Since Cas’ hands were otherwise occupied, Jimmy had key-duty and opened the door for them, letting his twin inside first and following after once again. Though, when he wanted to step inside, he bumped into Cas from behind and frowned, giving him a questioning look and silently asking what made him stop in his tracks.
Before today, Jimmy hadn’t ever been able to imagine what a Dom drop would feel like, even after Castiel had explained his experiences to him. By now, Castiel had dropped only once ever since they started this relationship with Dean, though he had had an almost drop a few weeks ago. While the first real drop had been more like a mystery to Jimmy because he hadn’t known why Cas had been struggling afterward since Dean had been alright, the almost drop had made more sense to him.
After another moment of silence, Castiel realized, “You’ve been home early…” and cocked his head at Dean questioningly. He typically came home about 30 minutes later than they would and Dean had to have been here even before they would have come home if he needed an excuse for them to stay away even longer and asked them to buy the food. This only, truly, registered now.
“Yeah…”
He didn’t know what he thought might greet him, what he thought he’d see, but finding Dean in the bathtub, motionless and hunched over, head resting on his knees, and visibly trembling, was not it and it caught him so off guard, that he stopped in his tracks, practically freezing with worry, and took in his boyfriend’s form. His heart was now threatening to break free and it felt like it was in his throat, making it hard for him to swallow with the lump forming. Jimmy still tried, though, and managed to croak out, “Dean?” as he pushed the door closed behind him and took a tentative step forward.
Dean, though, started to shake his head with a soft smile and said, “I’ll be fine. You three can drink if you wanna, I’ll stick to soda.”
– not because it was a surprise that he was so possessive of him, but because Dean thought he’d never think about something like this simply
. He looked up at Dean with sad eyes and the blonde said, “Okay, you know what, I’ve tried it your way. I see talking it out isn’t gonna work here so I’m doing it my way.”
The kiss caught Dean off-guard even though it shouldn’t have, what with his boyfriends acting like they haven’t been intimate with him in years the entire drive here. But Dean was very strict when it came to driving and he couldn’t concentrate with his boyfriends’ hands all over him, so he’d told them to stick their fingers to themselves because he didn’t wanna die in a car accident due to a hand sliding into his pants. This had let the twins to act like they hadn’t touched Dean in forever and right now, they were like feral animals.
The punishment must have gone on for another ten minutes before the cries finally stopped and he could hear a muffled voice, probably Cas whispering praises to Dean.
God, hearing Cas and Jimmy curse and beg like this made him feel powerful in an utterly different way than he usually felt empowered during sex. And yeah, Dean may have gotten off a little on the knowledge that
Jimmy had never been the teasing type. He’d never much had the patience to wind someone up so thoroughly, which was why he had always been assisting Cas throughout scenes like this but never actually done all of it alone. Now, though, Dean found it unbelievably arousing to see he was very much enjoying how the smallest of his efforts was causing Dean so much pleasure and how just the right punishment could make Dean feel such good pain, that he was already starting to float just slightly. The soft but very much affected expression on Jimmy’s face was enough to convince Dean to let go and stop trying to fight the sensation as his Dom slid the popsicle up his flushed shaft and down again to circle his balls with the ice and leave wet trails in its wake. On the next glide upwards, Jimmy made sure to cover Dean’s entire length with ice and Dean didn’t even have the mind to wonder why. He didn’t have to, after all, because Jimmy carefully loosened the cockring and used the water as lube to slowly take it off.
And then there was Dean’s collar. They’ve bought it a few weeks back for occasions just like this and it was so mesmerizing on Dean, that Jimmy couldn’t help but feel his heart melt at the sight of it around his soft neck  – which was covered in deep red marks from Castiel’s bite earlier. It was a beaded collar and custom-made entirely for Dean with gold, a few blue and purple but mostly emerald green glass seed beads, and sturdy metal, bronze O-rings on each end that were clasped together by a padlock. In the front was another bronze, floating O-ring attached to the body of the collar. It was heavier than Dean’s standard traditional leather collar but sat just as tightly around his neck and the beautiful and shiny green beads matched the vibrant color of Dean’s eyes, which made them seem even brighter than usual.
The praise made him moan and he closed his eyes, trying not to think about how uncomfortable and self-conscious looking at himself made him, and instead, he tried his best to concentrate only on how amazing Castiel was making him feel and how close to his orgasm he already was.
Smiling, he encouraged, “You know you’re allowed to touch, my love,” before focusing on his task at hand again.
“Yeah,” he agreed, nodding, “thank you, Dee.” A moment of silence passed before Sam’s curiosity – and brotherly concern – got the better of him and he asked, “Is that what you want, too?” When Dean opened his mouth to speak, Sam could practically see the witty comment on the tip of his tongue and he warned, “Tell the truth or I’ll smack your head.”
Dean shrugged one shoulder at him and said, “I like kids but that doesn’t qualify me as a dad, you know.”
And then he felt a warm, wet mouth on his dick and dropped his chin to his chest to stare at Dean, who was looking up at him seductively through his eyelashes, right before licking the flat of his tongue up the side of Jimmy’s length, circling his head and sliding over the slit, then going down the other side. Jimmy tried his damnedest not to squirm and groan under Dean's mouth as that teasing tongue traveled back up, this time along the underside of his by-now fully hard cock, wriggling the tip teasingly at the sensitive frenulum under the head.
Chuckling darkly, Cas leaned in and sucked at a spot on his neck above his collar, and Dean could feel his smile against his skin when he assured, “We know. And that was a truly hot fantasy. Do you want to know what’s mine?”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes?”
to be touched, I felt like I needed it. I wanted to stop feeling so lonely and cold, and so I longed to go to Alastair again and this thought just creeped me out so much, that I spent a whole afternoon with the rest of the booze we still had left at home and got drunk again.”
He has his hands on Dean’s thighs and hovers above him on his knees, eyes raking the Winchester’s stunning frame – naked and still beneath him; only for him. Castiel notices that Dean tries to not squirm under his scrutiny and he is astounded by the sight. Dean’s most intimate, sensitive and vulnerable parts – everything – is laid bare before Castiel’s eyes. “God… you’re beautiful.”
Even with the lust swirling in his stomach at Dean’s hungry gaze, this time Cas’ voice was honest and steady as he confessed, “I need you.”
That made Dean’s smile widen and he took the offered hand, rasping, “Well then… show me,” and just like that, Jimmy tugged their boyfriend off of the bed as well and scooped him up in his arms, guiding them towards a free space of the room. Once they found a spot, Jimmy took Dean’s hands and placed them on his shoulders so that he could cross his hands behind his neck, then placed his own hands on Dean’s hips, almost possessively, before starting to slow dance with him. Even though Cas knew Dean was good at this, the blonde let Jimmy lead the entire time and just let himself be guided by the man, keeping his eyes locked with Jimmy’s.
“Really? I don’t want to hurt anyone.” Dean played with the tablecloth again, signaling Cas that he was nervous once more, so he reached across the table like he did before and placed it above Dean’s, caressing his skin. It was warm and soft and Castiel smiled as Dean turned his hand around so that his palm was open and he grabbed Cas’ carefully.
As Jimmy put back the machine and took care of the needle and ink cups, Dean sat up straight on the chair and stretched his arms out above his head, arching his back and craning his neck as he let out a satisfied sigh at letting go of the soreness. He grabbed his shirt and put his feet on the ground to stand upright.
With a frown, Jessica sat down on the bed next to him and wrapped her left arm around his frame. She didn’t like where this was going and hated seeing Dean that way – self-destructive and sad. “You know that’s not true, Dean.”
“Yes.”
“Thanks, you don’t look so bad yourself. It’s my usual attire sans the button-up.” He took the chair and placed it so that he could sit down and shifted until he was in the right position. Cas did so, too, watching Dean move with smiling eyes.
Dean snorted once and met Jimmy’s eyes from where his head rested in his lap, smiling. “Like your fetish for fucking me while I’m asleep?”
“At least I had when I was younger, I haven’t been out like this in years and it is possible that my skills have gotten a little rusty,” Cas said, sounding slightly timid about it, which would have been all kinds of cute if Dean wasn’t still so aroused by his previous threat.
Sam chuckled at that and Dean met his eyes when he said, “Can’t believe he’s the guy that owns that place at the beach…”
To assure himself that everything was just fine, Sam turned to look at Dean’s resting frame and face, where his eyes were closed, and let go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding. His brother looked in shape. He wasn’t too thin, which was good, and his cheeks weren’t hollow and sunken. Even if he was a bit pale, it wasn’t ashen and lifeless. Dean seemed healthy and as long as his ribs didn’t show, Sam didn’t have a reason to be worried. Sure, Dean wasn’t burly, neither was he skinny. He had gained some weight again, which Sam thought was great, and he was back to being broad and muscled just enough to look sturdy and fit. It’s the healthiest he’s ever seen him.
Chuckling, Jimmy assured, “I promise, it won’t get awkward or uncomfortable. We’re three grownups mature enough to have a conversation about this relationship. Whatever it’s turning out to be. And I’m certain that if you wouldn’t have been this freaked out about sleeping with Cas behind my back, he would have suggested this to you as well.”
“What are you thinking about?”
The only thing he knew, was that letting Dean go felt like a big mistake and Castiel cursed himself as he realized that he should’ve followed him, after all.
Letting his thumb stroke over the back of his boyfriend’s hand, Cas nodded and locked his eyes onto Dean’s to give him an honest and sincere smile. “You don’t have any idea just
Listening to the ringback tone had Castiel thinking he made a mistake and was about to hang up and stop annoying Dean when he heard the familiar beep that indicated his call was being picked up and his heart nearly jumped out of his thorax. The next thing he knew was that deep voice rumbling through the connection, calling out his name in a rasp that had him shivering with excitement.
Out of the corner of his eye, Jimmy could see Dean’s right hand grip his thigh. He didn’t want to ask but he had to know, “Is he one of those guys that only do it to get off? Does he hurt you?”
of the crop on his buttocks. He made sure to alternate the side of his ass to pay attention to both his perfectly round and fleshy cheeks, bringing the end of the crop slowly up and down the curve of his lover’s butt as he tapped his skin, still not the actual punishment but closer now. He was just warming Dean up to it.
Throughout their days together in their new home, Dean had gotten to learn a lot about the twins that he hadn’t known before. It was great because he now knew things like the fact that Cas had a slight kink for taking him whenever, wherever – to Dean’s delight – and during this rather short time, they had already covered more than half of every surface in their apartment during sex. Jimmy, on the other hand, liked sex the most when they were still in bed, freshly woken up. Maybe it had something to do with that thing of his – this getting aroused while Dean was asleep. But he didn’t mind at all.
When Jimmy lifted his head to look at his twin, Castiel nodded with a sympathetic smile on his lips and said, “Yes, I understand completely what you’re saying, Jimmy.” He was playing with a strand of dark, sandy blonde hair, gazing down at Dean with fond and admiring eyes. “That’s what I need, to be exact. As a Dom, I don’t need sex, it’s merely a nice bonus. What I need is for my Subs to need me. Sure, during a scene, they rely on me and trust me to do whatever we talked about beforehand to make them feel good, but the part of being a Dom that really satiates
After the last drop of Dean’s cum had been swallowed down, Cas carefully pulled off of his cock and searched for  Dean’s face to make sure he was fine. He found it blissed-out with a giddy smile and closed eyes, smashed into the side of Jimmy’s face.
It was a fight, obviously, and a small group of people was surrounding the scene, looking angry and worried. He couldn’t see exactly what was going on or who was engaged in it but he also knew that he was not in the mood for something like this tonight and was just about to ask Jimmy if they should go out and look for Dean when the man’s face suddenly turned into one of horror and he started running. Whipping his head back to see what had Jimmy this alert, Cas was shocked to find Benny in a fight with another man. And as Jimmy made his way through the crowd, people parting to give him space, Cas was able to see Dean standing near, looking all too pale and shocked and
The room was filled with shaky and harsh breathing, Dean’s body still trembled, and Jimmy didn’t know how to freaking help him. It was the worst feeling in the world, feeling this helpless, and he started to feel choked-off with worry and sympathy. He was sure that tears were running down his face as he desperately tried to find the right words, but he couldn’t have cared less. “Dean, baby, please,” his voice broke at the end, eyes filling to the brim with tears, and he reached one hand out to start stroking Dean’s arm gently, and hopefully reassuringly. “Please, tell me what’s wrong. Tell me what happened.”
No one knows, though, and those who do, don’t care that much about it. Not that they don’t care about them in general, it’s just that they don’t care that Dean and he are both men. Which he’s extremely thankful for – not everyone is lucky enough to have such tolerant people around, even if those people are fellow soldiers.
Lifting his head with a cheeky smile gracing his lips, Dean whispered, “Very much,” before giving him a kiss to the mouth and standing up, kissing Jimmy as well and straightening in front of them. He tugged at his sweats, musing, “Better change these…” and managed to lift the mood to a celebratory one once more, turning around and walking into the bedroom to leave his two stunned boyfriends behind, chuckling.
At the first contact with his pucker, Dean closed his eyes and sighed softly, feeling as Cas rested a hand on top of his and Jimmy eased a digit inside to push it in and out a few times, moving and tapping it against his hot walls before starting to stretch him open. A second finger joined the first soon after, and at the beginning, it was a bit tight but a few seconds and a relaxing breath later, Jimmy was able to move them smoothly without any resistance. He started to scissor his fingers, spreading them inside Dean and moving them around to be able to add a third one, fucking them in and out of Dean until he was prepped enough and asking Jimmy to move on.
Dean scoffed, “Well, yeah. Dunno if it’s still fitting, but I did bring one. Last time I wore it, what, was at your first year here?”
With his mouth stuffed full of food, Dean argued, “That’s not true!” He barely managed to keep the sandwich in his mouth and the two laughed at him, making him smile sheepishly as his face turned red. After that, he kept his mouth shut and ate, feeling his boyfriends’ gazes on the sides of his face.
Dean just hummed into the kiss, his eyes fluttering shut and taking a long time to reopen once the kiss was over and Cas was leaning back, cradling Dean’s face in his hand. “Do you have any plans for the time we’ll be at work? Perhaps do something with Benny?”
Listening to Cas threatening someone with physical violence made Dean aware of the arousal that had been there earlier and was still lingering within him, and he started to feel odd. All he wanted was to spit his repugnance into this guy’s face and make out with Castiel, but in reality, he was still unable to move.
“It’s fine,” Cas assured, taking a few sips of cold and refreshing water. When he put the cap back on and placed it on the counter, he couldn’t help but notice how tired Dean looked. There were dark circles underneath his vibrant eyes that only now caught Castiel’s attention and his posture was somewhat stiff and exhausted. Trying to hide his concern, Cas asked, “Have you been out already?”
He would have been lying if he said that seeing Dean kiss his twin left him completely cold. It riled up his jealousy pretty hard and his possessiveness flared with fierce in the pit of his stomach. But Cas tried to keep it under control. This was neither a competition nor something he hadn’t just done a moment ago himself.
“Hey, are you busy right now? I’d need you here.” Jimmy truly hoped that Cas didn’t have anything else planned. Dean was his first priority right now.
Ever since Sam had told them about Dean’s depression, Castiel had been extra careful to listen to everything Dean said, to pay attention to little details or even things the blonde found amusing although it wasn’t. This could all be useful information to understand what happened and how it came to it. Breakdowns like the one Dean had experienced didn't just happen because someone had one bad day, or a bad week even. Something so big and dramatic wasn’t the result of one incident, most of the time. Certain things, however small they might have seemed, often mount together until the person affected either snaps or breaks, and it’s especially hard to heal again if the person had endured living like this for years, and thus sees no way to change or escape it.
Even though he knew Dean was fine, the scene was still very fresh and his lover’s cries and grunts kept on replaying in his mind, making him feel miserable. Dipping his head down, Jimmy latched his lips on to the crook of Dean’s neck underneath the collar and kissed him there, trying to calm down before he started to sob or hiccup.
with his thumb for a moment, considering if he should really do this… Controlling himself with Dean around got harder every time they saw each other and that would have only been the third time. Castiel didn’t want to do anything he would regret afterward and he especially didn’t want Dean to regret it. But he was weak and wanted to see Dean again, so he pressed
“You always come when I call… well, both of you do. But you’re the one who’s always extra eager to make me feel good,” Dean explained with a big grin, “And you’ve sexually submitted before… so, you know the drill.”
Castiel’s shoulders shook slightly with his sobs when he said, “You were gone for so long last night. I thought you wouldn’t come back. And you didn’t answer my calls and I… and I thought you were going to leave us, that you’re afraid of me because I h-hurt you…”
Dean moaned several times, his mouth dropping open as Cas started to snap his hips into him again and again, and he nodded once, twice. “Yours,” he breathed out through moans and gasps, trying to keep up with Castiel’s pace. After a while, Dean stopped and just let Cas help hold him up, let him hold him steady while he used his core to roll through the thrusts to bounce over Cas, and instead of making Cas move against him, Dean let him move with him.
Yes, Cas just loved Dean’s cock as much as he loved his belly and nipples and hole, his eyes and lips and nose and hands…
“Sorry, what?”
That made her smile brightly and she winked at him teasingly, replying, “Thank you, handsome.”
Running a hand down his face to hide his sigh, Dean met his brother’s eyes and asked, “Would it be so bad? Does it make me a jerk that I wanna get to know them both because they both make me feel special? Am I a bad person for not choosing one?” His eyes welled up and he hated himself. “Tell me I'm selfish, tell me I’m the worst! Please, yell at me! Anything!” His breathing got faster as the first tears fell and Dean didn’t even know why he was breaking apart right now. He ought to be happy, he had met two men that turned his life upside down in a good way. He should’ve been excited to meet them again and he should’ve been thankful for meeting them in the first place. People like him didn’t get to be happy… So, why was he crying? Why did he always have to be such a coward?
After a while of twisting his red head, Jimmy surrounded his entire cock with both of his hands and gripped him firmly, one hand right underneath the head, the other one down at the base, brushing his balls when he started to twist them in opposite directions to make Dean writhe and curse. The sight had Cas leaking with desire and lust, heat pooling low in his stomach. And because Jimmy, too, was enjoying this way too much to stop now, he crossed his fingers and cupped Dean’s cock, surrounding it between them, and opened his thumbs to smear pre-cum along his head while sliding them along his shaft, up and down, at varying speeds. He occasionally circled the tips of his thumbs in both directions just underneath his head to massage his frenulum, then alternated the way of teasing his glans and sliding his short nail into his slit or applying pressure just underneath before teasing his frenulum once more.
As if the guy wasn’t able to let go.” Hearing all this made Castiel fidgety and uneasy in a way he had only felt once before, and he had to swallow down his hatred for the man they were talking about to be able to even still concentrate on what was being said. “When he seemed to finally understand that you weren’t coming back, he searched for a new Sub and found one. And lemme tell you something; he looks suspiciously similar to you.”
Castiel’s and Jimmy’s cocks were perfect, long and thick, and they always stretched Dean better than anything he’d ever experienced before, no matter if it was his mouth or ass. And he fucking loved when his two holes were stuffed at the same time, split open by them, and kept him on the brink of pleasure. It was what he lived for.
Which, to his delight, seemed to happen faster than the first time they took this road – maybe, it was just because they already knew it. But in what felt like only a quarter of an hour, they pulled up at the parking space of their hotel and got out of the car, taking the bag with them and finally checking back into their room.
Chuckling softly, Jimmy pressed a lingering kiss to Dean’s forehead and said, “Come on, why don’t you go take a shower while Castiel brushes his teeth,” Dean snorted at that and Castiel gave him an amused expression, “and then we’ll put back on the cilice on you and pick out your clothes for tonight. How does that sound?”
, Cas was sure he would’ve been convinced it was a fever were they not spurring Dean on like that.
Without another word or further ado, Cas loosened one hand from Dean’s cheek and grabbed his wrist, using the grip to pull Dean through the shower and stopping him in front of the full-length mirror at the wall opposite. Dean’s eyes were wide and confused, and all Jimmy could do was follow and watch silently from the side as Castiel took matters into his own hand.
If Dean weren’t looking at him with those honest eyes and thoughtful expression, Jimmy would have thought that it had been an accusation. But it was truly only curiosity. “Well, as a tattoo artist, I make good money, so that’s really not what I pay attention to. Of course, I wouldn’t go out to eat expensive sushi every night, but a burger here and casserole there is okay with me.”
After that, they joined Cas in the kitchen and helped him prepare dinner. The three of them spent the rest of the day talking, eating the lasagna Castiel managed to find ingredients for, and watching a movie until they started falling asleep on the sofa and turned off the TV after deciding to go to bed.
“You thought I was a sex worker?” He held his breath at that, waiting for the litany of insults and a burst of anger to come but it didn’t. Dean just chuckled in amusement and said, “You wouldn’t be the first one to think that, Jimmy. It’s alright. I got asked if I was a stripper once because I had the looks… the guy was cute.”
“So… no separate dating? Would that mean you two would date as well and… you know, do other stuff together? I mean… you’re twins, that’d be incest… it’s just– I think that would go too far for my liking.” He was nervous again and scratched the back of his head while meeting Cas’ gaze with big, uncertain eyes.
They all took a nap like that, hands still roaming Dean’s body absentmindedly while their bodies were still covered with sweat and cum, and when they woke up again, they jumped into the shower together and went downstairs to have a nice breakfast after they cleaned themselves up, going about their Sunday as they usually would have.
ge I’ve… nngh… ever had!
So they had finished it, professionally gave their signatures at the end like Dean had done with a few Doms before, since it had always been in Clubs, and put the final results in the drawer of one nightstand.
A slight blush crept upon his cheeks when he admitted, “Yeah, me too.”
“Of course, Dean,” he assured, giving their boyfriend a small smile, “as long as you’ll come join me afterward…”
He wondered how Dean spent Christmas, and then he wondered why he was asking himself that.
“But you were okay with the crop…”
Dean would like to have known that himself.
“Haha, you ass.”
“All this helped me get back into a healthy mindset and helped me heal. Not completely, of course. Wounds are either always there as memory or never truly healed, they could always rip back open. But I started to feel good enough with myself and began frequenting the club and scening with a few femme Doms. I was still a bit afraid to try it with a man ‘cause I was sure it would trigger me during a scene and bring back memories of Alastair, who I haven’t seen ever since that night… also because I dropped out of school entirely to start anew.
“Both,” Dean managed to admit quietly.
Once his hips started to stutter, his movements getting uncontrollable and desperate, and he felt that his orgasm was right there underneath the surface and so close, Jimmy held on to Dean for dear life. His nails dug into the meat of his hips and he did everything in his power not to use Dean’s body as he pleased to rock him back and forth, trying to be mindful of the fact that he was still sucking Cas down and such a move would certainly choke him and hurt Cas. And then he came, hurrying to bury his cock as deep inside of his boyfriend as possible to let go of his release and pump him full of his sperm with a choked-off cry. As he emptied inside of him, Jimmy saw how Dean’s arms and legs were trembling, his entire body flushed, and he felt him clamp down around his pulsing shaft but he didn’t come. Which was odd because by now, the Sub would have already orgasmed.
Dean met their eyes with a smirk and winked at them, and Castiel and Jimmy burst into laughter, making the blonde smile happily.
I am, not what. When you look at me, I feel like you see me as a person and not just a label. I don’t feel like a demisexual having to explain myself, or someone who’s gay. I don’t have the feeling you look at me and only see a Dom, either. You don’t see a label, you see me. And that makes me feel so good around you, Dean. There’s real interest in your eyes and your smile is real. You don’t hide from me, at least not if I ask you to and that makes you real and amiable.”
Dean lifted his head and looked at Castiel without hesitation, for which he received a smile from Cas. “Second, if I ask you a question, you’ll answer verbally.”
Dean looked absolutely mesmerizing in this collar and Jimmy felt a strong wave of love and possessiveness at seeing him like this – wearing
feel like this again. I cannot regret this or feel bad about us, ever. And I never want to let you go again, so long as you want to stay, Dean.”
“I like you…” He couldn't stop himself from kissing that soft spot behind Dean’s ear, this one spot that he knew already was the blonde’s weakness because he always shuddered when being kissed there. “But cats are cute, yes.”
And as if knowing that Castiel wasn’t satisfied with that answer, Dean added, “I’ll try, ‘kay?”
. Afterward, the twins left the room to get into bed and let Dean take on some clothes without having hungry eyes watching every move that he made and waited for Dean to join them.
“What about you, Jimmy?”
The blonde huffed a small laugh and said, “I didn’t do much of anything.” He sounded sleepy and Castiel could not only see the smile, but also hear it.
“But something that I did must have reminded him of Michael or Alastair or someone else that hurt him before and that is what still worries me.” His hands were still washing the skin that he could reach absentmindedly while he let the scene play revue before his eyes.
“Nothing important, truly. Mother just talked about the only thing she ever talks about – food and money. Because, apparently, she’s not interested in her children's lives.”
When Jimmy pulled back out, it was with a moan, and then Dean could only
With a slight shrug, Sammy said, “Well, yeah. Sometimes.”
“Green,” was all Dean managed to croak out.
Dean was the first to walk towards the couch with two plates in his hands, Jimmy had grabbed the third one as well as a bowl from Cas so that his twin was also carrying two bowls, and they followed right after, sitting down on their usual spots and grabbing the blanket that was thrown over the chaise lounge. But before Dean could cover them with it, Jimmy noticed that they didn’t have cutlery for the eggs and stood up, saying, “We forgot forks and knives,” over his shoulder as he hurried back into the kitchen and opened the drawer with their cutlery to grab three forks and three knives, before closing it again and returning to the couch.
Chuckling, Dean said, “It’s part of my charm,” and startled the two of them, who turned to look at Dean standing in the doorway with only a towel hung lowly around his hips.
for steam…
Jimmy tracing a line of a bead of sweat on his chest down to his navel had Dean watching him as if in trance while Cas resumed sucking on his collarbone and probably licking off the salt of his skin. “You’re radiating heat,” Jimmy stated, grinning softly. “Is it because of Cas’ fantasy? Or the weather?”
Still laughing slightly, Cas turned to face his twin and said in an amused tone, “Smooth, and I thought I was the awkward one when it comes to socializing.”
“Sure, it’s what I do professionally. I can show you some of my works first, of course, so you’d know for sure if you’d want this or not. And you wouldn’t have to spend a few hours with some stranger half-naked.”
Cas’ forehead creased in confusion, his mind running a mile a minute to make sense of what he just heard, but he couldn’t come up with an explanation for those words, so he asked, “What?
With that, he left the room, hopefully giving Dean the space he needed, and walked into the kitchen first to throw away the three items he had been holding in his hand where cum had begun to dry and cool. When he entered the bathroom and closed the door, Jimmy took a quick glance at himself in the mirror. He had some wild sex hair going on and his shoulders weren’t as stiff as they usually were. After that, he stepped into the shower and turned on the water, waiting for it to get from ice cold to at least lukewarm before jumping underneath the spray and washing off all the sweat and other bodily fluids. He used some shampoo for his hair to make it smell nice and rinsed it out afterward, shutting down the water and grabbing a towel while stepping out of the shower again. His bathroom wasn’t very big so he was almost able to reach everything from out of his shower. He’d even bet that he could take a piss from there and still aim, but Dean didn’t have to know that he was this immature sometimes. Though, the thought made him smile to himself as he dried himself off with the towel, wondering if Dean was more like Cas or him when it came to things like that.
“Right,” came the quiet answer, and Cas smiled, watching Dean return to his rather confident self and prop himself up on his elbow. He brushed his lips along the edge of Castiel’s jaw, tracing them down and underneath his chin, and hummed contentedly while the raven-haired enjoyed this new kind of attention. Against his skin, Dean whispered, “I’d kiss you properly, but I think we’ve both got some kinda morning breath going on and I don’t know if you think that’d be gross–”
It had taken a few minutes longer to pack up the rest of their stuff than they had wanted, and once they were all done with that, Jimmy and Cas hurried to get out of the private room and follow Dean to their car.
He held his breath while letting his eyes drift across the room and listening to all the sounds around them intently to hear if Dean was perhaps just in the bathroom until his gaze landed on the half-opened patio window leading to the roof deck. Only then did he realize that a slight breeze was carried inside the room through the small gap and Cas sat up straight, sending a worried look to Jimmy as he caught slight motion from the roof deck. His twin mirrored Castiel’s expression and they got out of the bed to slowly walk towards the window front.
“If you say they’re amazing and you wanna get to know them both and they’re fine with it, which I think they are – unless they wouldn’t have asked you out in the first place… – then why do you think you have done something wrong? Why do you think we should yell at you? If they make you feel good, why would wanting to date them both make you selfish even though they both agree to it?” Dean couldn’t see his brother’s face since his eyes were way too misty, but he didn’t need to. He knew Sam had big, concerned eyes and a crease between his brows.
“Oh, are you afraid I’ll laugh at you?” Dean teased in a playful voice, pressing his side into Cas’ body and leaning in to stare directly into his eyes.
“But was that okay? I mean, you’ve been keeping to the background all day and I just want to make sure you get attention as well.”
“I know what you’re thinking, you dirty little man…” Dean teased, suddenly hooking his leg around Jimmy’s waist to flip them over as if he weighed nothing. It left Jimmy breathless and when Dean rocked his hips to remind him that they were still connected, he groaned, staring up at his boyfriend with wide, awe-struck eyes. “Just because I’m the sleepy one doesn’t mean I can’t be toppy,” Dean whispered into his ear as he bent down, clenching around him, and licked along the shell of his ear playfully. God, this man was so indescribably sexy and Jimmy let out a strangled moan at the feeling and this show of power.
And so Jimmy did; he pushed the metal inside all the way to let it stay this way and grasped Dean’s now slowly erecting cock with his hands to start pressing the tips of his fingers and thumbs into the shaft. When the noises coming from their boyfriend got louder, Jimmy traced his pointer finger along the length of the underside of his shaft and hummed in delight as he felt the metal rod inside. His cock gave a twitch at the feel and Dean moaned, a long and low, rumbling sound.
“But why?”
“A few months, because there were a lot of sessions and healing in between those. I got it done two years ago.”
With glazed and lust-blown eyes, Jimmy watched as the hand disappeared between his boyfriend’s legs and a moment later, Dean’s jaw dropped open in a silent moan and his dick gave a twitch in his pants at the sight, already fully hard. And as much as Jimmy wanted to see Dean’s beautiful face and how his cock filled with blood at the stimulation he was giving himself, he wanted even more to see what his fingers did. So he placed his hands on each of Dean’s thighs and curled his fingers around them, meeting those green eyes and whispering, “Turn around.”
Flashing him a triumphant smirk, Sam said, “I always am,” and Dean rolled his eyes at him, giving Sammy’s shoulder another shove and laughing when his long hair bounced funnily at the abrupt motion.
Sometimes, on days like this one, Dean really didn’t think he was, but Castiel was pressing his fingers against every rib on his way down his torso and further to Dean’s twitching hips, making him forget about these kinds of thoughts as he watched those deft fingers dance across his body. Looking up and meeting Dean’s eyes in the mirror, Cas clarified, “I mean it, Dean. I love every part of you, inside and out. There’s not a single hair on you that I’d want to change because you’re perfect for us.”
A low moan slipped past his lips this time and Dean grinned triumphantly, guiding Jimmy’s hand back out from underneath his panties and rocking his hips a few more times to the song before standing and slowly dancing his way back into the center of the chairs, leaving Jimmy with the information. And he had no idea what to make of this now, except to hope that he got to be buried inside of it later on.
This plug, they’ve used before as well, so Dean knew exactly why his Doms had chosen this particular one. It was longer than most for extra prostate stimulation and just big enough to keep Dean open and not waste their preparation but not big enough that they wouldn’t get to enjoy a little burn when their cocks slipped inside of him and he knew how much they loved that.
“He was a Dom as well and told me that I could only be a good Rigger if I knew how it felt, how a Submissive would feel. So, he showed me specific knots and ways to suspend people on myself first and I experienced it like a Sub would before doing the tying and knotting. It was truly helpful because I could judge if the rope was too tight or sat uncomfortably and how long the Submissive could stay in a certain position,” Castiel explained as Dean and Jimmy listened intently.
