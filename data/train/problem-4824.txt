“Michael, as a favour to me, just promise me.  Don’t talk to Raphael about this.  I… I need time to think.  Please, promise me.”
“Need the money.”
He had yet to speak to Lafitte himself, seeing only the images of his injuries taken as evidence. If it had been Alastair reporting it to him, he would not have believed it, assuming it to be some attempt at revenge against Benny.  But the rookie Bass had witnessed it, and he was almost painfully honest.  His brief explanation that he had come round a corner on the exercise yard to see Lafitte and Winchester engaged in a fist fight.  He had shouted a warning, Lafitte had stopped, but Winchester was like a thing possessed.  Dangerous and damn near unstoppable.  So… no option really...taser deployed to disable the threat.
Charlie’s bright red head nodded on the screen. “Uhuh.” She confirmed unnecessarily. “But that last connect and the one before narrowed us down on options to track the car. It seemed logical that as they were heading North, and they had no reason to suspect that we were tracking them we could assume…”
Bela shook her head. 'My reticule has all I require for now.' Castiel nodded and spurred Grace into a gallop, while Dean followed quickly behind. Once they had made sufficient distance from the carriage, they slowed the pace to a trot, and Bela spoke again. 'I did not wish to say anything in front of them, but I do have a place to go if you will take me there. A good friend of mine is a novice at the nunnery outside ---. She will help me.'
Dick Roman stared at Raphael. “So, she told you she was just a nurse, eh?” He flexed his arms a little tighter where they pinned Meg’s elbows behind her, as she struggled to free herself from his grip. She felt woozy and a little bit sick, but she still managed to stamp back angrily and he grunted as her heels hit his shins. It was Raphael who smacked her neatly with the back of his hand, the implosion of pain in her cheek did nothing to quiet the fight in her though. She raised her leg and caught him tight in the thigh with the toes of her thick soled combats.
“Dean,” Castiel gasped, his grip on Dean’s arm was weak and his eyes were fluttering closed.
“Man, you are tighter wound than a Brumby on a short rein. Relax. You OK with this?” Soft kisses press to the back of his neck, and heaven help him he doesn’t want this to stop, he grumbles permission, nodding his head and stretching to give better access. Gasping as soft lips give way to sharp nipping teeth. Behind him, a hard cock slides between his sweat-slick cheeks and nudges the back of his balls. He lets out a moan and ruts shamelessly into the hand that swipes lazily over his head, collecting precome and gripping him just a little shy of tight enough. Even, so he isn’t going to last long.
By the time the main course arrived the bare-bones of  the next day were decided upon. Kali would spend the morning drafting a statement with Cas and they would present it to the DA in the afternoon’s meeting. The legal team were confident that with Cas refusing to support the prosecution’s case, effectively corroborating Dean’s story the only action the DA could take would be to drop the charges. Dean should be eligible for instant release. The only complication was the business with the fight during recreation time.
He also prided himself on his cold-reading and his ability to unpick the psyche, motivations and mental state of anyone within a few minutes in their company. And, generally, he could manipulate all but the most difficult of subjects with just a few minutes more.
Dean and Castiel had been born on neighbouring estates in the south of England, but when Castiel's family had been carried off by a fever when he was but a child, the Winchesters had taken him in and raised him alongside their sons, Dean and Samuel. Often bedfellows, Dean and Castiel had spent many nights finding release together, a practice they had both assumed would one day end with their marriages to worthy ladies of the gentry. However, when the time came for Castiel to meet that destiny, he was stolen away by the infamous highwayman, The Riteous Man. The land pirate had been prowling the roads of ---shire for many months, robbing the greedy and cruel among the wealthy, and finding more worthy recipients with whom to share the riches.
“Michael, we have a friend she’s a genius for tech, we’ll get her to look at the hard drive. But, among Anna’s things Is there a memory stick? A small silver one, it might be on her key chain.”
Cas nodded.  “Typical Gabe. Do you think he realises I'm six foot now? It’s a treehouse, Meg. He helped me build it when I was a kid. It’s only a couple of feet off the ground, probably half fallen down by now. But the coppice should be dense enough to hide in. There’s a lane that runs down towards the lake.  It cuts along the back of the estate, there's a low rail fence runs along against the trees down there. We need to go now before it gets light, or we’ll be seen crossing the lawns. And we need to turn off the automatic security lights. The switches are in the utility room behind the kitchen.”
Garth alt tabbed and scrolled through the statement lists.  He frowned and then rolled over in his office chair. “Pull up her statement.”
“Uhuh, that’s what I said until Jo kicked me under the table. It’s been good to see them and show them some of the sights. We missed you, of course, but we’ll see you at Christmas right?”
Yesterday she had finally surfaced from the coma to a round of tests and assessments.  Bess had listened with anxiety at first, gradually lifting to amusement, as the exchanges between Marcy and her doctors revealed that she was barely dented.
'Of course,' Gabriel assured him. 'I can also tell you the precise route they will take.'
“Oh, no, some other guy.  Called himself Allen, Rick Allen.  There was a fight outside the bar.  Your brother came driving to the rescue in a big old muscle car, like the lone ranger. Obviously, the local police don’t know who their suspect is, but Carter got an ID on Castiel from one of the guy’s friends.  He was last seen driving off with ‘Rick’.  It appears they spent the previous week holed up in a motel in Wausau, Wisconsin.”
“Sure,” Cas’ voice was laced with humour and sarcasm, “
“WHERE IS HE, SAM?”
It had been easy enough earlier on that evening to follow him from his flat, slipping onto the tube a carriage down, the hustle and bustle of London affording him some cover. Catching glimpses of the dirty blonde head through the connecting door, picking up the body language that indicated he was leaving.  He’d briefly lost him in Tottenham Court Road station, but soon picked him up again rounding the corner into Soho Square, after all, Dean was relatively easy to tail, his tall figure and distinctive gait made him easy to spot in a crowd. He had watched from a discrete distance as Dean greeted the auburn-haired woman, standing on the corner of Greek Street, trying not to look anxious.
Castiel could quite cheerfully kick himself. It’s a wonderful surprise to find Dean is in town. The fact that he didn’t know spells out in exquisite detail just how little they are talking lately, but there are reasons for that, excellent reasons, he tells himself. But Dean is nothing if not forgiving and they’d dropped into an easy banter, just like the old days. Then, as ever, he fucked it up. Why the hell did he mention Dean’s fear of flying? His stunned reaction is further proof, if he ever needed it, of just how far removed they are from the easy companionship of their late teens and early twenties. And he just has to go and mention one of Dean’s greatest vulnerabilities, as if it were nothing.
“I’m your brother Dean.  The last time you kept something secret from me… it nearly killed us both.”  He kept his voice light, but Dean could hear the anger… and the hurt, just beneath the surface.”
Sam looked momentarily shocked, then broke the tension with a deep belly laugh. “Dude, he so has the measure of you.” He patted a puzzled Cas on the arm and said quietly. “Dean doesn’t do feelings, Cas. You’ll find it easier if you just drop down to his pubescent level of articulation.”
“For breakfast?”  Cas said incredulously, wiping the last of the foam off his face and stuck his head around the bathroom door.
Somewhere in the darkness, he heard a muffled noise and then a more determined bumping sound. Carefully, he moved in that direction, arms extended in front of him. His palms hit a solid wooden surface, and he let his arms slide down until his fingertips dipped into a vertical slotted recess. With a little bit of fumbling investigation, he managed to slide a door sideways.
“I could make you a cosplay toga,” Dean grinned, “Cas has plenty of dust sheets lying around.”
“Yeah, she said her bruvver normally ‘elped, but he weren’t around, so she was moving stuff on her own.”
The sweet scent of hot chocolate drifts up from the counter. Claire abandoned him almost instantly, dumping her bag on the table Dean has managed to snag, she darted towards the restrooms. Cas nods his thanks to the server, taps his phone to the pay sensor, and drops it back into an inner pocket so he has his hands free to wrangle the three steaming mugs.
“What? It’s not like I’m telling him a trade secret. He’s just watched you at work… Oh right… it’s the deviancy you’re objecting too… it’s not like he won’t find out soon enough… I’m sure he’s intending on hosting you and Deano at some point.”
sedated.”
Night had fallen some time ago, the last motel had looked so disgusting they had jointly decided to press on further and stop at the next one, that had been two hours ago, and the empty road had stretched on with nothing but occasional dirt tracks marked with homestead names, and fields of straggly looking crops reflecting back in the periphery of the headlights.
Dean nodded, wiping the little damp patch from his own chin with the back of his sleeve.  Baby suddenly gave an awkward cough, and then began to splutter.  He glared at Cas accusingly, his first thought that maybe he had left it a little late to say anything about the gas tank, but the gauge was still showing just under a quarter full.
The routine of prison life was simple.  Boredom was the biggest factor.  As a remand prisoner, Dean had no work duties to fall back on, and following Benny’s advice, he tried to keep his head down and avoid the politics and dramas of the populace.  He was fairly certain that Benny was protecting him, or that at least being Benny’s cellmate gave him protection.  The big Cajun had some sort of special status, he seemed to be respected by guards and inmates alike.  And he was a peacemaker.  No-one messed with him and having watched him quietly and softly defuse fights and altercations before they started, Dean was beginning to understand why he was so respected.
“There’s only one witness statement here.  Jenna Hughes.”
Finally, rolling the paper into a neat little ball, and giving a satisfied little belch, Dean looked back at the charismatic, enigmatic man who had made the coffee of his dreams.
the little voice was soft in its appraisal,  self
Cas gave him a weak smile, worry etched deep on his handsome features, anxiously checking the mobile phone for the umpteenth time, before he returned to his conversation.
He heard a door creaking open.  A normal door, not a cell door, where was he?  It smelt of prison, but this bed was softer than his bunk.  He closed his fingers round a metal rail, but that didn’t make sense, the bars were in the wrong place.  They ran the wrong way, or was he upright? He threw arms and legs in an effort to stop himself lurch to the floor, only to kick against bedding and rails. Dean tried to squint his eyes into seeing something that didn’t resemble an overexposed art print.  “Mr Crowley,” this voice was different, clipped and professional, but still kinder.  “Can this not wait.  He’s still concussed.”
And then there had been the intervention of Dr Dick Roman, arriving at the hospital and taking over Castiel Angel’s care. Insistent that he was too traumatised to be interviewed. Not entirely unusual in a case like this, given that he had supposedly been showing signs of mental distress prior to disappearing.  Roman was so eminently respected that there was little point fighting it, but Henrikson was not convinced.  It was all falling too damned conveniently.  Dean Winchester was going to be staying in custody, the DA arguing that he posed a serious threat to Castiel Angel.  And all hope of talking to him or Angel was gone for the moment.
The man huffed, it might have been a laugh, it was hard to tell with his face shadowed as it was.  Cas squinted through the rain and against the light.
"We'll set Garth on it.  It's just background, besides tomorrow, we start on the CCTV footage."
“Yeah?” Dean answered, with a sleepy voice. It was late, and it’d been a long day.
“I did this?”  Bright blue eyes scanned his face, as Cas pulled at his lip, exposing the split, wincing in sympathy.  “I’m so sorry.”
Benny scanned the compound, one of the men pointed straight towards his friend. A few seconds later just as the exterior lights extinguished with a pop, when Bobby and Ash cut the power to the sector, Dean scrambled over the gates and embarked on his one man ambush.
“Honestly?  You wanna know what I think?”  Newton’s eyes wrinkled as he smiled.
They’d always wanted a dog, but it never seemed like the right time for it between keeping their cover, and their jobs, and their amenities intact.
The man stared at the extended hand for a moment, and then took it.  “Steve.”  It was a lie.  Dean knew instantly.  It had taken the man time to think of it.  Not that it mattered. Dean had used enough aliases in his own life.  Dammit, sometimes even he forgot what he was supposed to be called.  They shook hands and ‘Steve’ hissed quietly through his teeth, his hand freezing mid-shake.
She slapped him. The sting was nothing amongst the other sensations raging through his abused body, but he still made a play of pulling up sharp.
Dean's route back was normally a pleasant 15-minute walk through the dunes, the sand underfoot gradually firming up as the dune grass diminished until it was solid enough to bear the weight of vehicles. And then a sedate drive along the winding strip of flat top through the marshy hinterland, another even shorter drive along the coast road into the little coastal town he called home. Normally, he wasn't half hanging like a drunk date over someone's shoulder, while they carried his bag and his board.
“That song you’re humming, nurse.  What is it?”  A voice Dean recognises, one of the many guards from the wing.
Dean held the door, and with a quick glance up and down the street had followed her in.  Castiel had muttered a vague curse when he saw them head downstairs, momentarily wondering whether it was worth the risk of going in.  He shook his head the venue was far too small.  He had found himself a doorway with a clear view of 68 and Boston’s entrance, and settled his back against the wall to wait.
She was efficient and businesslike, placing a blood pressure cuff about his arm and pressing the button to inflate it while she fussed about taking measurements and scribbling down notes, before turning her attention to finally address him directly.
Cas’ eyes focused on the ceiling.
“I’m sorry, man.  I didn’t see you, with the rain and the dark clothing…”
“When the moon is in the seventh house”
She had laughed at him as he spluttered, “Meg!” all the while feeling the blush rising through his cheeks.
Dean jumped slightly as the monk gripped his arm, just above his elbow, “Mr Winchester,” he glanced up into the cold ice blue eyes of his nightmares, “tell Prince Castiel what day it is, as he seems either insensible of it, or determined to be obtuse.”
That was over two hours ago.
Sighing, Dean lowered himself slowly, gripping his side as an excuse for the time to compose himself. “Well, this is dandy,” he said, faking it for all he was worth, “When does the hair braiding start?”

The night is quieter than usual and there’s not a single cab in sight, so he starts walking, knowing that the next street, much busier and lined with shops will be a better hunting ground for bright yellow.
“When you say Dean’s house, I can assume your registered address is somewhere else?”
“Don’t worry,” Spengler said softly, “I stopped that in its tracks, anyway. With the photos as proof that there’s no way Dean was involved I think the whole damn thing will just get filed away and ignored. Crowley’s no fool and I think he kinda likes Benny too. He has him running library carts and looking after the newbies like a surrogate mother."
The flowers are an impulse buy. He is strolling down the street, towards where he knows there is a cab rank, when he sees the blousy poppies in the window of the boutique flower shop on the opposite corner. The sky is already darkening and light spills onto the street, throwing a reverse shadow of the frosted name arced across the sidewalk. He hesitates minutely, they are not the traditional red, but a deep salmon bleeding into the softest cream each petal. They look so delicate that he just knows Bal will love them.

Castiel Novak has been topping the sexiest man on snow list for so long the only thing stopping him from being that fantasy DILF we’d all like to dream of was the absence of any offspring, but maybe our prayers have been answered.
He cleared his throat.  “I could have a look at the register for you.  I’m … I’m quite handy… with anything mechanical, I mean.  I could maybe stop it sticking.  You could consider it payment for breakfast?”
“But gradually I began to realise there was something… off.  I didn’t know what it was,but I knew Dean was hiding something. He changed.  Started getting snappy with me.  Sending me to our room straight after dinner to study.  He started running me to school, collecting me straight after.  He was working so hard, I just figured he was tired, but when I tried to talk to him, he shut me down. The only other time I ever saw him this way before was when Dad went through a spell of coming home really, really drunk.  Dean got so hard on me, rode my ass over chores, made me go to bed early every night… so that when Dad came home, I was out of the way, so that it was Dean who bore his frustration and not me… that’s when I figured it out.  He was protecting me from something again.”
Concussion.  That explained it.  So he’d hit his head.  When had he hit his head?  Or had someone punched him?  Would hardly be the first time he’d been punched.  But he’d listened so carefully to Benny.  He’d stayed out of trouble.  Followed every instruction.  He'd been so good.  If he was good and kept his head down, he would get out of here. He was only here for a few weeks, while they saved Cas. He was here to save Cas. Where was Cas?  Stupid boy. Cas wasn’t in jail with him. Benny was in jail with him, Cas was… Cas was… Jesus, he had to get out of here and find Cas.  He would be having nightmares without Dean to comfort him and quiet him back to sleep.  He started to struggle to sit up, to roll out of the bed, but his arms wouldn’t work.  Every time he tried to move them they got stuck. He tried to shake his head free of the confusion that seemed to be addling his brain, but only succeeded in making his head scream in pain, bright circles of light sparkled in his eyes and the super-bright world faded to black.
Her indecision and confusion must have shown on her face because he suddenly reached out and rested his hand briefly on her lower arm.  She flinched instinctively, and his eyes flew wide, his hand recoiling.
“So we
Dean sighed long and deep and closed his own fingers over Charlie’s. “Fake it til you make it, bitch,” he said softly. “Damn it Charlie, is it stupid to miss someone you hardly knew? Maybe I spend so much time in a fairy tale world I just expected my own happy ever after,” he sighed again and rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Maybe I’m just tired. I’m a grown ass man, fairy tale endings are for little girls in pink tiaras.”
The image of Dean’s face, dimpled with disapproval, swam into his mind unbidden and with a deeply reluctant sigh, he pushed the phone under the edge of the bed before he could succumb to the temptation to use the number emblazoned in his memory. He stared at his feet, it was no good. The temptation was too strong, he retrieved it swiftly, let his fingers fly over the keys and pressed send. He didn't have time to dither like some parody of a teen rom-com. The available light dipped and he turned to see a dark silhouette casting its long shadow toward him across the disgusting motel carpet. Using the twist of his body as a shield he let the phone drop to the floor, the flick of his heel kicking it under the bed.
“Proceed, Clifford,” the disembodied voice is accompanied by the buzz of the electric door locks.
He becomes accustomed to the routine far too quickly. There is no outside light in Quarantine. So he has to rely on the rhythm of meals and punishments to work out the passing of time. He starts counting each breakfast, as soon as he is aware enough to do so. Once he stopped fighting at every opportunity, the use of the tazer and the fastening of his wrists behind his back with zip ties whenever he was left alone stopped, but he is still linked by a steel cuff and chain to an o ring riveted deep into the floor.
“No, I have not been disobedient, so there should be no punishment.” Why couldn’t the stupid Prince just do as he was told for once? The punishment had just doubled, maybe even trebled.
Dean ignored his cheap jibe. “One mention, a case in New Hampshire. He’s not specifically named, but it sure as hell sounds like him.”
kind of asshole.”
He slowed as he approached the corner, gulping air into his lungs as quietly as he could. It wasn’t worth the risk of running blind into the main corridor, no corners, just a straight line of sight.
Bess stood for a moment, rubbing her arm, a set of finger-shaped striped red blotches appearing on her pale slender arm in the soft flesh just above her elbow.  Then her chin began to crinkle, and she gave a little sob, as the shock hit her.
It had taken him only minutes to convince Cas that he should head down to The Venue, which in itself was cause for worry.  Cas was not a clubber, especially on a work night.  He loathed the loud music and the ‘pretentious’ crowd that hung there.  Whatever his trouble was, it was big.
The diner on the outskirts of town was only ever really busy during tourist season and at weekends, but it still did a steady trade off-peak, mainly because the food was not only reasonably priced but exceptionally good. Dean was enough of a regular that he only needed to order if he wanted something different from his usual, but he normally ate alone, so they had barely sat down in his favourite booth before Jo appeared at his table, her expression a study in nonchalance.
“How’d she know they weren’t us?”
“That’s only a few days, Lance. This case was… it’s had teams… poring over it, for months...this is…to make this kind of progress... it's exceptional...”
“...fan-fricking-tastic,”  Dean finished for him, voice dry and unenthusiastic.
“But all that aside. I had to come. Who else was gonna come save your sorry ass?”
“Meg?”  he managed to croak, eyes flying open.  She winked at him and pressed her fingers to his lips, as he stared at her wide-eyed and reeling.  She cupped her hand behind his neck and lifted his head.  “Nurse Masters,”  she informed him, indicating the neat tunic, emblazoned with her sister's jewel based logo, tapping her name badge.  “Luckily for you those fools your brothers hired don’t know the difference between a sedative and a vitamin shot.  We don’t have long, it’s taken me two weeks to earn enough trust to be allowed to administer your meds without supervision.  They won’t leave me alone with you for long.”
“I don’t think that was your opinion earlier this morning.” Dean was gonna argue back, but Cas didn’t let him. “Now hush, I wanna know what happens next.”
“What if we lose them? That bastard is our only real lead on Cas...” Dean had appeared at the diner door, his phone, retrieved from wherever he had placed it pressed to his ear. His other fist clenched at his side, his body language screaming pent up aggression as he glared in the direction of Roman and Michael’s retreating figures..
“I must insist that this conversation ends now.  I need to discuss options with and provide advice to my client, so that he can add his own statement to the evidence,”  Spengler protested.
She smiled to herself, and carefully set the tea tray down on his antique desk.  He glanced up at her, and catching her smile he returned it.  “One minute to go,” she nodded at the egg timer, “and it will be perfectly brewed.”  She looked meaningfully at the clock, as he raised his eyebrows in question.  “11 am, English Breakfast, two scoops, boiling water, to the bottom of the spout, 6 minutes to steep.”
Dean was flustered. He hid his own feelings so deep, Castiel’s open, simple statements threw him miles outside his own comfort zone, especially when the echoes and reflections of his own psyche were so clear. He was saved by Crowley, his phone suddenly belting out his ringtone.
They ate in companionable silence until Dean realised with a sigh that he had finished his coffee.  Cas replenished it without comment, and removed their plates to the deep butler sink, before returning to his perch at the table.
“Dumbass is right.” Gabe snapped. “We’re all busting a gut to get him out and he’s throwing it away because he ‘likes’ some bloke he barely knows. ” He sensed Sam and Cas both stiffen. Jess had gripped Sam’s hand gently. “Sorry,” he murmured.
“He stole your phone?” Jo’s voice was indignant as she gently picked grit from the scrapes on his hands. “Asshole.”
“I promised Meg, Dean, when she first asked me to help her that I would keep her secret, and I blew that...but she forgave me, Dean. Meg forgave me and she let me stay in their lives, asked me to be Claire’s godfather.”
“No… aw…go to hell, Crowley, you son of a bitch.” Dean looked up, gulping a huge mouthful of coke, before grinning back ruefully.
“Who you calling a pet, bitch?” Dean groused, earning himself nothing but a tightening of her grip, he yelped sharply as the bones of his wrist began to crunch together.
OK, check the end notes for trigger warnings.  There's nothing too heavy, but safety first peeps.
He looked up at the bug-eye of the security system. It felt like it was staring back. Glassy and uncaring, but the lack of green shine meant that his instincts were lying. To hell with it. He was pissed with all this game playing. He shoved the book away frustrated and stood suddenly. Intent on hammering on the door and demanding answers. He actually froze mid stride, like a cartoon cliche, when he heard the buzz and click of one of the controlled doors somewhere outside of his cell. It was heavily muffled, but he could hear the sounds of movement. The cell doors here opened outwards, it made sure that prisoners had no door to hide behind, no blind spot to give advantage over the guards entering the room, but he pressed himself against the wall, close to the corner alongside the door anyway. He had no weapon, no means to defend himself beside his bare hands and his wits, but back to the corner, nothing in his way until the low modesty wall in front of the toilet pan, he was buying himself a precious few seconds and a little space.
Crowley pursed his lips, thinking.  He’d read the brief little report from the medic.  The concussion had revealed a previous trauma, the exact nature and extent unrevealed.
The half-smile returned, this time shining with gratitude and Dean felt his heart swell a little… Jesus, he needed to get a grip.  He withdrew his hand a little self-consciously as his phone started to ring.  The familiar swelling intro for the Black Sabbath track denoting a call from Crowley.
“It’s as simple as that.”
He waited patiently. This would be annoying the control freak into a frenzy, but he would be expecting it, surely. Afterall, as Raphael would see it, this was Michael’s only logical move. How else would Michael be sure that Raph even had his prisoners ready to be let go?
"None of that plays to your advantage CJ. It just looks as though Mick Davies was coming between you and you were jealous. Look, I know this is tough on you, but we have to go over the physical evidence. We don’t have much time to settle your defence.” Spengler sighs. "The knife was bad enough, but now they have found..."
Spengler sits beside him as they bombard him with questions. What were his movements on the days leading up to Mr Roche’s death? Did they argue in the apartment? Was he aware that Mr Roche had employed a private detective to investigate his own past? Was that what had provoked him?
He watches Dean pretending he hasn’t seen Claire swiftly snatch a fry away from his plate, where only moments before he gently slapped the back of her wrist with the flat of his fingers to prevent her marauding hands.
“Ah. That is the million dollar question, we all want the answer to, Kansas.”
Gabe just grinned and waggled his eyebrows.
The station was arranged in three blocks around a central courtyard car-park. In common with most of the partially pre-fabbed structures of the UK's 50's and 60's post war building boom, it was constructed of concrete and glass, with metal sash windows along both of the long sides of each block, internal partitions breaking the huge floor space into smaller offices and rooms. It was freezing in winter, but roasted its occupants alive on days when the sun shone. The British obsession with the weather became entirely understandable if you spent any amount of time here, it was utterly erratic. This CID office was on the fourth floor of the block directly opposite the low building that housed the reception.
A third voice begins calling back up the hill. “Leader! Father! We are blessed, Castiel is alive. You were mistook. He cannot have been at home when the blaze took hold.”
Sam shook his head. “He was… his victim.”  He dropped his eyes, it still hurt.  Even after nearly a decade.  “He used me to make Dean go with him, he had no choice, we both knew he would kill the other if we didn’t do as we were told.  That’s why they gave us both immunity.”
She leant forward, peering through the driver’s window, at them both.  “You drive careful now boys.” She blinked and straightened herself up, her hand resting briefly on Dean’s arm as it lay along the window. “Together or not,” she muttered softly so that only Dean heard her. “It’s all the same to me.”  Dean sighed, raising his hand to wave, before flexing his fingers into the drainage rail above the driver’s door.  She stood at the edge of her tiny forecourt, sending them off with a cheery smile, three homemade pies and a pot-roast.  Cas turning round in his seat, waving through the rear window, as the roadside dust swirled up and she disappeared into the distance behind them.
Bal laughed, it sounded a little hollow, but it was a laugh. He paused again in his pacing as Gabe provided his own answer. “I arrive at the most refined kindergarten in town expecting to collect my demure, sensible, quiet little baby bro and there he is, four years old hand in hand with this little boy, blonde as he is dark. Cas caked in mud, clothes torn and you sporting a black eye. And that hairy lipped matron, what was her name?...”
“I had it with me.  The day I… erm… left, it was in the car.  When I sold it for cash, I found that in the trunk along with a couple of other bits and pieces.  You must have left it in there at the end of term, I took it with me.”  He glanced in his rear view mirror again and indicated to change lanes.  “You, Squirt,” he confessed quietly, “were one of the few things I missed.”
“I am not the one in a hospital bed, trying… and failing… not to scratch at his stitches,”  his breath was warm on Dean’s face.
They charged him altogether, this was not going to be a fair fight, by any interpretation.  Dean struggled as his left arm was grabbed and twisted awkwardly behind him.  He managed to get one strike in with his right before that too was pinned behind him.  He writhed in their grip as hick number one prowled towards him.
Cas had long suspected that Luci had been in love with his mother.  Gabe hinted at it more than once, but now they were all gone from his life.  One in an asylum, one dead and the other Lord knew where.
“He has to be lying,” Alastair snapped. “Why would they have pulled that stunt with the taser, if they weren’t on to me?”
“So you think it was a woman?”
He glanced up to the ceiling, a long expanse of concreted dotted with surveillance points, the same dark bug eyes as in the ISO cells. No handy suspended ceiling, just strong enough to take his weight. Er, hello, PRISON! He needed a place to hide until morning. He was too preoccupied with his own sarcastic little inner voice, to take in what was incongruous about those familiar bug eyes.
'Thank you, Cas. I shall go get the horses shod.' He clapped Castiel on the shoulder as he went past, leaving him alone with Dean.
He grabbed a notepad and began scribbling down the details.  He allowed himself a small smug moment.  It was he who had suggested that Angel might try to reach the other brother and it was he who decided that The Grand Basin Highway would be the most likely route in to Vegas from Wyoming, and it was he who was sat in a motel room, 60 miles south of where they had been spotted, and more crucially 40 miles north of the rapidly deploying police roadblock.
A gentle hand cupped the back of his head and he slurped a little greedily at the proffered water bottle, sucking at the water gratefully.  “I’m afraid that in order to make sure they let me stay, I had to slightly exaggerate the depth and scope of our relationship to the medics.”  Cas confided in a low voice.  Dean decided to deceive himself that the brief shimmering shiver of pleasure he felt was just a reaction to the drugs, and had nothing to do with the feel of Cas’ warm breath on his ear.
bruises?  If I had been in the mother of all fist fights like Scitz and Bass described, my face would look like Benny’s, and more importantly still.  To inflict that kind of damage to his face… My hands would be a mess.  Trust me.  I’ve been in enough fist fights to know.”  He held his hands up to Spengler, and the young lawyer gave him a smile of genuine triumph.
It was Bal who broke the silence which was building in intensity like an approaching storm. “Gimme the phone, Cas. I’ll go unlock it, while you grab a shower and get ready to meet everyone for dinner.”
for a day for the first time in a long time, and he does feel
“The God’s are not only against us, they are determined to keep us in Lusk forever.”
The enamel mugs clinking loosely in his hand, Cas headed back towards the back of the building.  He knocked politely on the screen door, before gently pushing it open.  The old lady was nowhere to be seen, the kitchen was bright.  A blue and white gingham cloth on the table.  The sink was cluttered with a small pile of dishes and pans in soak.  A radio played soft easy songs in the background.  The room was full of peace and sunshine and Cas let it seep into him.
He dropped his head back, understanding suddenly.  “If Raph thought he knew anything he might try to have him killed…and if he suddenly got a real good lawyer Raph would smell a rat… oh God. Are you sure he’s safe?”
They treated him carefully, but there was no roughness or cruelty in their demeanour, so Dean found himself relaxing a little.  So far he had been treated well at every stage.  The only time he had been manhandled was when he struggled to stay with Cas.  He felt the pain of leaving him lying in the dirt afresh every time he thought of it.  There was no doubt in his mind that ‘the passing motorist’ who had started to drag Cas from the car was the horror from his nightmares, the scars on his cheeks, the way Cas had fought him.  He had given up dragging Cas towards the jeep, when it became clear that the police were too close.  He dropped him to the ground, with no pretence of care, and Dean had dropped to his knees cradling Cas in his lap, talking to him quietly, hoping he could hear his mumbled reassurances.
Ambulances, medics, doctors, test after test and the gentle explanation from a quiet, softly spoken Doctor followed. And worse: Sam, impossibly, even slightly taller and looking pale and pensive and tearful, with a small dark-haired girl firmly gripping his hand, appearing at his bedside.
He nodded. And relaxed back into the chair, as each rune was painted deep in his skin. It had taken much negotiation and a great deal of convincing, but the elders had finally relinquished the secret. And the demonstration of his powers at the house, far from a beacon call had served as a warning.
'I beg you, take me with you!' she cried.
They walked into the main ‘office’, Cas completely oblivious to Dean’s fear.
Bass had strolled quietly in the direction of the Isolation Wing. Collecting his radio and his equipment at each stage, listening to the claustrophobia inducing clangs and clunks of locks as he passed through each detector and level of security, the feeling of descending ever deeper into hell occurring to him yet again. He'd waited until Eli had gone for one of his ever frequent toilet breaks before quietly letting himself into Dean’s cell. “Hello Dean. How are you today?” The look of surprise flashed quickly over Winchester’s features before settling into a pursed lip appraisal.
“Yes,  I’m fine,”  he managed, and taking another deep breath, he forced his fingers to close around the towel and began the painful task of drying and dressing.
And he slips slightly on the wet floor, as he tries to get to his feet, the grip they have of each others biceps, where their forearms overlap is the only point of contact and it’s not enough and he uses the imbalance to pull Cas back into his lap and kisses him through their combined laughter.
“Thanks. For all of this. For everything that you’ve done.”
“Ok, Steve,” the tone of Dean’s voice made it evident he knew the name was fake.  “You’ve got no kit, no dry clothes, no money and you don’t even know where you are.  I’m not judging here, shit I’ve been in some scrapes, done my fair share of running, but you’ll catch your death if you don’t get out of those wet clothes.  When did you last eat?”  The lack of response spoke volumes.
Driving on autopilot, he’d silenced the radio long ago.  Unable to bear to listen to any music as the roads and junctions became increasingly familiar.  Familiar, yet holding that hint of alien that passing years bestow.  Small differences making every twist and turn appear to be just a little off key.  The odd missing tree, or altered road sign jarring against his memory of the route home.  A fresh stretch of a barrier, or a new building where once had been open ground.  The sense of otherworldliness exacerbated by the decolourisation of high beams picking out each highlight only briefly.
After they’d closed the inn, Dean finally confronted his brother. And, as expected, it didn’t go well.
“Yes.”  She nodded miserably.
More snake like and menacing than the real man.
He loads the groceries into Baby’s trunk alongside the bucket of nails and wood glue he actually came out for. It took considerable willpower to climb into Baby and head into town this afternoon. There is something irresistible about Castiel when he is absorbed in his carpentry. Dean covers it with all sorts of cheap comments about being good with his hands and offering alternative ‘wood’ for him to work on when Cas looks up and catches him staring. But in truth, there is nothing he loves more than just watching Castiel working. Focussed and calm. His strength and grace of movement never more obvious than when he is completely at peace with himself, skilled hands making magic out of timber.
“Am I wrong?” Sam asks flatly.
“What’s your name?”  Bright lights in his eyes.  He tried to push them away, but his hands wouldn’t come.
He grabbed the book from where it had fallen to the floor during his manly tussle with the torch bookmark and opened it carefully. He flicked through the pages, held it by the spine and gently fanned it open, checked the frontispiece, the back pages, along the edges of the cover and even rechecked the spine. If this was meant to be a message it was a bit fucking obscure.
Carter was smiling smugly.  He handed Adler a dossier as he slid into the passenger seat of the nondescript saloon they were currently using.  Adler opened it impatiently.   “Well, well,”  he said,  “I guess a well done is in order.”
Only Benny remained silent on the subject.
Self-hatred boiled in his gut. Trusting, docile, plodding Michael. Able ally, poised in his brilliant older brothers dark shadow, always soothing the ruffled feathers and easing the way. Pop to Seattle Michael, work your magic, Michael. Michael, the family patsy!
his unwanted inner voice sneers, and he focuses on the scattered trail of delicate freckles, dappled over the skin of Dean’s left shoulder like tree shade on the floor of a glade, to silence it.
Castiel jolts awake as Dean coasts baby to a halt. Sand sparkles grey amongst dark tufts of seagrass in the beam of the headlights. They have been driving for hours and Castiel fell asleep somewhere south of Atlanta. He turns to Dean, eyes wide with uncertainty, in the reflected gloom. Through the window beyond him he can see the wooden fairings of a building.
“Don’t call him that!” She sounded angry and Castiel shuddered, clamping his jaw against the chattering of his teeth, lest he bite his own tongue. He let the whimpers of pain he had been suppressing develop into low moans, vocal chords, scratching with the unfamiliar sensation. If he could cause discord between the siblings, maybe he could use it to his advantage at some point. “Undo it,” she snapped.
Dean stared at his colleague as if he had suddenly developed another set of arms and was about to speak when the desk phone rang. "Tomorrow afternoon at 3 pm, by the way. Just so you can creep down the corridor and lech at him from the fire exit." Crowley snatched up the phone with a twisted grin before Dean could respond, listening intently for several seconds before asking, "Where?” He pulled a pen from his pocket and scribbled on the pad on the desk. “Well, well,” he said to Dean. "We got another body, and this time it's the same MO, right down to the abstract on the wall."
“We aren’t all raised with maids to teach us to count fork tines.”
Adler had been adamant that he should make no move without him, but this was urgent and Adler was still at 36,000 feet somewhere over the desert.  He considered his options.  He needed to think and act fast.
There was no way he could taint her with beach sand, salt air and surfboards, so he kept her safe and wrapped up, like his old life. If by chance, he was seen approaching the area, his truck was a giveaway. The woman who had taken Cas, must have been watching them, she would have seen his truck. Baby, distinctive as she was, was the perfect vehicle. The fact that her trunk was already full equipped was an added bonus.
“How?” he whispered, voice ringing with alarm for all it’s quietness. “Th… that is not possible… my house is warded… you…”
“Look, there’s Dean!” Castiel snaps around sharply to see Claire pointing with glee at a sparkling blue package tucked under the arm of a snowman. Idiot! He admonishes himself when he realises how disappointed he is that Dean is not inexplicably exploring the same glitter-filled nightmare as them. But he dutifully snaps a picture of Claire and the lopsided snowman holding a present and sends it to his friend with a winking emoji. He knows Dean will reply later when he has a few moments and the fact that he looks forward all day to the ping when Dean’s replies appear in his notifications? Well, that’s a secret between him and his smartphone.
Cas tilted his head, a squint pushing crinkles into the skin between his eyebrows. “The coat, it’s… well… it’s like a fancy dress costume of a flasher or something. Or Columbo, maybe. You don’t have a clue what I’m talking about do you…”
With the obvious rudeness that only a very polite Brit can carry off, Crowley had dismissed the oily Dr Roman. Missy personally took him all the way out to his car, carrying his briefcase as he clumped along on his crutches. She’d returned fifteen minutes later with the tea tray, setting it down to softly close the window Crowley had opened to clear the air. And thus they sat quietly, the scent of Bergamot replacing the choke of aftershave, sipping at the aromatic, delicate tea sweetened with a dash of clover honey. “Well,” she commented quietly, “he was more smarm than charm.”
Angel notices. Of course, he does. “You did not seem so shy this morning,” he comments, “... or last night from what I remember.”
“You made more this afternoon than I’ve cleared in the last month, cher, you gotta let me give you commission at least.”
He rolled off his bunk and stretched his shoulders.  Benny was still on his work detail, and Dean was surprised to see Aaron Bass hovering on the landing just outside his cell. In his hands he held a book, which he thrust at Dean, who stared at it dumbly, and glanced at Bass, puzzled.  He shrugged.  “It’s a sunny day.  Figured you might wanna sit around the back in the sunshine and read.”
“I think it is not a secret, amongst the brethren that I regard you as my son, Castiel,”
Cas watched him go.  “Your brother is surprisingly awkward sometimes,”  he observed softly, “considering his chosen profession.”
“It’s OK,” Castiel nodded. “I should go, please take your lunch, enjoy. I can get the flask back next time.” He stood and with a curious little nod, he turned and walked away.
“I ‘missed’ my bus because I was rescuing your sorry ass, from Hillbillybob and his equally inbred cousins,”  he grumbled, taking a bite of his pastry.
Sam bit back his response. “How’s Cas doing?” he asked, changing the subject completely.
“Care to share how you managed to do that.” Dean jumps slightly at the sound of a familiar gravel worn voice and glances up at the tall dark-haired man leaning casually, arms crossed, shoulder braced into the wooden archway that separates footwear from clothes. Benny really needs to either close off one of the doors or get an extra bell. Dean didn’t even hear him come in through the front door. “I’m still recovering from the tongue lashing I received this morning when I tried to ask her what colour salopettes she wanted,” the rumbling voice continues, the soft hint of a barely-there accent which combined with his stunning looks and impossibly blue eyes have made it so easy for him to seduce just about anyone he chooses. Powers the tabloid stories would have everyone believe he abused regularly. Dean knows better. At least he thought he did.
An echoing chime announced the arrival of a customer.  Mrs Kunsberger wiped her hands on a hand towel and turned from the stove with an air of mild irritation.   “I’ll go,”  Cas said, standing quickly.  They both stared at him for a moment, Dean’s eyebrows raised in surprise.  “I worked a gas n sip while I was at college,” he explained. “I know my way around a gas station.”
Sam shook his head sadly.  “No, I’m sorry Cas, I don’t think he did.  And there’s something else you should know.”  Dean’s face twitched with the realisation of what was coming, he moved his arm, and Sam realised he was getting ready to drop it around Cas.  He swallowed, “I’m so sorry Cas, but Lucifer Angel was declared dead just over a year ago.”
He released her face and stepped back calmly pulling his kerchief from his top pocket to wipe his cheek. Roman smiled, Raphael Angel’s control of his own emotions was utterly terrifying, even if you were fortunate enough not to be on the receiving end. The entire Angel family was practically its own psychiatric study. “Really, ‘Nurse’ Masters.” Raphael’s voice had regained its urbane tone. “Tsk. Tsk. Using your own name, my dear? How long did you think it would take for us to discover your association with my little brother? A classic rookie mistake, and I’m afraid to say. It will cost you. You and Castiel.”
“What?” he snapped, suddenly becoming aware that Crowley was scrutinising his face with an odd little smirk twisting his bearded little face.
“Praise to The Leader,” Elder Raphael begins the closing address, “Our link to the Lord and Guide in faith…”
“Yeah, you don’t like that I call them wets,” he said, turning to put a gentle hand on Dean’s bare shoulder blade.
Dammit.  Another quick volley of shots rang out and he ducked for cover instinctively.  He heard the return of fire from the other side of the car.  The two men were darting between the parking lots.  Henrikson levelled his weapon and took aim, but the first of the two had already flung himself into a sedan.  In the distance, Henrikson could hear the steady crescendo of sirens, easier to pinpoint in this open architecture.  The cavalry was on its way.  Without really thinking he stepped clear of his own vehicle and fired two shots into the back of the departing sedan, as it squealed away from him down the highway.
He was the halfling Prince. She hid his coat to protect him from himself so that he wouldn’t be tempted to return to the water, his mother’s kind might not wish him harm, but they did not really trust the Prince of the daemon realm in their midst. They did not want him, She was the only one who wanted him.
A woman’s voice overlayed his, unfamiliar, but clear and authoritative, “You should still have made sure he ate something, Gabe. For heaven’s sake. If all he’s eaten all day is a couple of your manky sandwiches you can’t wonder he's fainted. When did he last even have a drink of water?”
“Castiel, come. Walk with me. I would converse with you.” It may sound like a request, but no-one in The Collective would even think to openly reject the Leader’s requests.
“Start at the beginning Benny...and don’t even think about lying to me.”
They arrest him as he steps out of the hospital lobby.
“You should eat something.”
Reluctantly he opened his eyes, glancing sideways at Novak, his heart catching as he realised that Castiel had been watching him the whole time.
“It can just be for a few days…” Dean begins, his tone placatory, “...but if you like it, we can stay longer.” They have been travelling together for nearly five months, now, moving from town to town. Castiel has tried many times to insist that Dean should let him pick up some work to earn some cash to put towards their food and lodgings, but they have never stayed anywhere long enough for him to really contribute much. He doesn’t like it, but he does like Dean, so he has pushed his own disquiet down. He opens his mouth to protest, but Dean beats him to it.
,” OK, he was paying attention, “but I have checked my tray for anything important that might be missing from the file.” Bless whichever deities had sent him Missy. He’d stake his life on the notes on the skirmish between Dean and Benny not sitting in that file.
“You earned it fair and square, brother. Besides. I kinda have a favour to ask myself. I know you’re probably all booked up already and if you say no, honestly, it won’t matter, but…”
He's so lost in thought it's only when he realises his old friend is looking at him questioningly, that he realised he zoned out.
Castiel remembers the look on the upturned face. Eyes, wide, blue, innocent and pleading. He would have crawled through toxic waste before he let her down. A lifelong aversion to glittery mice was a small price to pay for a few moments of happiness for this precious child. He had much to make up for, after all, he knew he carried a share of the blame for her father’s death. The buzz of his phone drags him back from his maudlin thoughts.
“How…?”
Gabe winced, but his soft eyes showed hints of amusement.  He and Sam exchanged a look, but neither said another word even when the elevator car broke the icy silence with a warm melodic ding.
“Many of the older children look to you, Castiel, as an example. They see you, as my favoured son, and they model their behaviour on you. And it’s important work. I sometimes find it hard to reach them once they begin to leave behind their fledgling status and especially as they near adulthood. I am a parent to many and like any good parent, sometimes I have to do things for my children’s own good, that they may not like, or may seem harsh to them, that is my service to this community. My boy, they like you, and they trust you. You are my tool, just as I am the Lord’s.”
He jumped as Raphael’s deep voice cut through the conversation.  “I’m what, little brother?”
The office was humming with quiet activity. The team worked on the footage in groups, occasionally one or other would draw Crowley’s attention from his position by the whiteboard where he was creating a timeline for Drew. Dean had retreated into the corner office, sitting quietly with Charlie as she filled him in about Drew’s online activities. He was prolific, sometimes hooking up with three or four people in one week. There were weeks and weeks of work in following up and interviewing his connections.
Bal made his excuses. Now that he was sure that Cassie was occupied, he wanted to check in with the staff at his club. He knew he didn’t really need to: his staff were more than capable. His main role these days was to schmooze and flatter egos.  He looked across at his friend. He was sat with Sam, Jess and Marcy. All of them so busy looking after each other, they weren’t aware how much care was being taken of them in return. Without awareness of the irony, Bal thought, Cas finally had the family he deserved.
“Hm, lemme think… no way.  Number 1: your hands.”  He paused turning them back and forth in his own.  “They’re healing well, but you can’t do this yourself every day and without regular treatment, they’ll get infected.  Number 2: no-one knows you’re here, hell
“Just before 9. I heard the front door slam downstairs, just as the news bulletin started on Radio 4." News was news after all, and the ITV showbiz roundup started at 9, too.
“Me?” Dean’s voice does not squeak. It does not. He clears his throat.
Charlie was pretty convinced that the heaven-sent or at the very least Angel provided Kasia was almost as interested as she herself was. At least if the amount of eye contact and the number of oh, so delicate splashes of shy smiles were anything to go by. But they had work to do and she returned her impressive intellect back to it. As Amy returned, the late May sunshine dwindled towards dusk and they sat and discussed the mammoth task ahead.
“In the dark? Baby’s a Chevy Impala, Cas, not a Humvee.  Even if she could cope with the terrain we’d probably end up driving into rock pile or over a canyon edge.”
The pony shake was instinctive to fix his swimming vision and clear his nostrils. He winced at the pain in his head. Would he ever learn not to do that? It always seemed to be such a good idea, until a couple of shakes in. But then he told himself that everytime... and he still did it. He swallowed to clear his mouth and managed to just about wipe the drool from his chin on his shoulder, wincing as cold metal bit into his wrists where they were fastened behind him.
Finally, finally, Dean’s eyes settle on Castiel’s face, focussing on him, trying to get a read as they stare at each other.. “You done?” Castiel asks softly, lips twitching slightly.
Back and forth they had battled. Much to his chagrin, Crowley could think of no reason to delay handing over the files. He’d called Missy. “I’m a little behind with my filing,
“The last of the crates have arrived, CJ,” Hannah sounds excited as she dashes into the huge exhibition room. She almost trips over Castiel, on his hands and knees testing one of the wax rubbing kits on the replica hieroglyphic tablets set up to enable children to make their own pictures to take home. “Wow,” she says, “CJ, that looks amazing.”
Sam served them their drinks, grabbing a beer for himself.
There was a tap at the door. Crowley lifted his head from his notes. “Yes,” he snapped. Gavin recoiled slightly, and Crowley sighed impatiently. “What is it, Fitzgerald?”
“You’re not still too sore?”
“Oh, only I thought as Bass was covering extra nights, there might be… opportunities…”
He is so lost in admiration and awe at the sleeping man next to him, he misses the change in his breathing and it’s far too late to try and pretend he wasn’t doing the creepy sleep watching thing when he realises Cas is staring back at him. Irises flooding with an ocean as pupils recede to pinpricks when Dean moves to fake a yawn and his shadow shifts.
“Get in,”  Dean nodded towards the car.
Mark laughed. “Poor Robbie, it wasn’t really a reality show, it was a documentary, series about music. Jimmy gave him so much shit over it…’Gonna be some hot shot tv staurn, eh?’” he said in a passable imitation of his partner’s accent.
“On the contrary, Mr Angel,”  she said calmly holding his gaze.  “I’m informed it’s a record.” Michael felt his mouth twitch, as she continued earnestly, “Mr Adler has a tendency not to keep his administrators for long.”
The nurse raises his eyebrows, but he’s smiling. “Nuhuh.  Sorry buddy, you’re still not out of the woods quite yet, can’t have you choking on your own vomit.  But the drugs’ll make up for it. Promise.”  He chuckles and Dean can’t help but chuckle back.  Dean allows him to take his pulse, and answers the predictable questions, resisting the urge to snark.
Cas could not bear to look any longer at the condescending pitying look on Michael’s face.  He tried one last time, his final gambit.  It was stupid, he needed the evidence to back it up, but he was getting desperate.
Garth flicked back through his notes, no self-respecting thief would take a phone that old. “It’s not listed amongst his personal effects.”
Dean scoffed. “I can’t believe that Benny would do anything to me… I just … I thought he was my friend.”
Dean grins at the memory and realises, he wants nothing more than to listen to the gravel laden voice telling him with enthusiasm all about bees and the honour of tasting 3,000 year old Egyptian honey, or explaining why the monetary worth of antiquities is not always in sync with their educational or academic value. He is in the middle of recognising that he is, in fact, crushing a little, when the angelic illusion before him is shattered by a giant belch. Angel’s hand shoots to cover his mouth and he gives Dean an abashed look and then straight out giggles.
“You were damned lucky that guy just happened along. Damned lucky he was smart enough to work out what your insulin pack was and to find me under your ICE contact, damned lucky he was willing to try and help you rather than just ring an ambulance and damned lucky he happened to have an energy drink on him."
He dried up mid-sentence when the look of relief that ran across Castiel’s face hurt him to his core. “I’ve been a cop a long time, Cas, and one thing I do is read people.  There is something you’re not being honest about, but it’s not this.”
The man moved closer, but Dean dared do nothing just yet. Once he was in strike range, could he risk the headbutt trick again? Not if this man had already watched him do it once.
“Son of a bitch,” he muttered under his breath, shaking his head and smirking.  He turned on the shower and started to strip.
Michael shook his head, lips pursed and thinking, but he murmured quietly.  “OK, Cas, I promise.  Now you go rest.  You look exhausted little brother, and I promised Dad I would look out for you.”  The reassuring smile was anything but.
A few lyrics nag at the back of his mind and he realises what he is humming. Damn Dean and his love of rock and metal. He half sings, half hums as he soaps his hair,
Sam stopped.  He needed them to know, needed them to understand. “That’s why Cas is so special.  He broke through it, Gabe.”  He blew his nose a final time and squared his shoulders, the echoes of a frightened lonely teenager dropping away.  “Despite all this shit,  I never heard my brother so happy and so relaxed as he was with Cas these past few weeks.  Not since before all this happened.  We have to get them back together.  Cas is Dean’s Jess, whether he’s admitted to himself or not yet;  He needs him.”
He was one of only two people who knew their secret, the other being the town blacksmith and barber-surgeon, Benjamin Lafitte. The Frenchman's unusual combination of two essential skills, as well as his jovial demeanour and comely appearance, made him a popular man. He came to know the truth after patching up a few too many thrown shoes and scrapes than could be explained by a quiet life on less than a dozen acres of croft land.
Dean rolled his neck and stretched his shoulders without ever once relinquishing his relaxed grip on the wheel.  He yawned and glanced across at the roadmap.  Another couple of hours and he could look for a place to stay, maybe find himself a roadhouse and some easy company, either from a bottle or not, as the case may be. He rubbed at the bruise on his stubbled chin.
So clever of Raph, knowing that Michael would not trust Dr. Roman, once he found out about Luci, to then go and find someone who had known Cas at college, someone who would know all about the family and would know just enough about Cas to play Michael. Someone he would never suspect of being part of the conspiracy if he should finally wake up and smell it. Raphael gently discouraging him from inviting her to dinner, subtly pushing him to do the exact opposite. God, was he really so easy to manipulate.
“OK, but one of the SOCO’s will need to come with you to take samples and preserve evidence.”
“What? It’s a play on words. The biggest lover of all time and it was my
“YOU are the only poison here,”  Cas ground out between his teeth, turning towards Raphael with his temper barely in check.  His cheeks flushed and burned with impotent rage.  “I’ll go to the board,  I’ll tell them the truth about you.  At least they might listen.”
“Nothing? You honestly expect me to believe that you’ve been here all these weeks and you’ve told them nothing.”
"I'm not hitting on him," Dean protested.
“I know who she is hot stuff, she’s been making moon eyes at you since you started.”  O’Brien, that was it…not O’Malley.
Jess and Marcy had finally been convinced to go and get some sleep just after midnight. Sam had been trying for at least an hour to convince them, it had taken Cas five minutes, speaking to each of them separately. Gently confiding first in Jess, then a short while later talking to Marcy.
Someone is humming.  Softly, barely audible as they move.  The steady swish of fabric against fabric, and occasional incidental noises.
His face swam into his mind, blue eyes soft with affection. Lips parted, poised ready to kiss him again.
“You don’t even think he looked, do you Sam?” Cas said slowly.
She swallowed and grinned at him, knowing he was pushing his own fears down to reassure her. “No-one knows where Adler is, Cas.  If it was him, he was in Wyoming just after lunchtime yesterday… he could get back here today.  Michael told me last night that there was some problem with the Seattle deal, he’s going into the office today and likely to be heading up there this evening, straight from work.  He was apologising for abandoning me to dinner with Raph.”
“You really like that, huh?”
“That will be a matter for the wing supervisor, Alastair.  Not something you need worry yourself about.”
Dean finally felt some air getting to his lungs. He pulled his wallet out and grabbed a bill. “Give us-”
“You talking ‘bout me or the car, boy?”
“We don’t have time for the whole story Cas.  There’s a lot happening.  We’re all working on it in different ways, but in short, Bal called me.  We were lucky they used Ruby’s agency to employ a couple of extra nursing staff.  If she ever finds out that the bout of stomach flu that hit nearly every goddamn member of her nursing team was down to a doped batch of cupcakes and not some freak occurrence she’ll disown me…  Either that or she’ll get me struck off.  I feel like a total shit, she was so glad that I would take a nursing job on my incredibly convenient holiday.  I am officially the best sister in the world.”
“Cas?”
Meg struggled even harder. Feeling the iron grip crunching her wrist bones together. “You leave him alone, you bastards.” Good luck, opening to door without the key!
He kicked off his boots and jeans and dragging his t-shirt, shirt and jacket over his head in one crumpled skin of clothing.  He pushed back the covers, rolling sideways onto the other half of the bed and lay staring at the ceiling.  “I’m an Uncle,” he told the chandelier.  Cas laughed and tried to push himself up to get off the bed.  Dean grabbed his arm, pulling him back, and then as Cas flopped back onto the pillow he reached out. His touch was hesitant, gentle.  Skin on skin contact so light, the briefest haze of fingertips, barely there, leaving a tingling trail of nerve endings down the side of Cas’ cheek and the curve of his neck under his ear over the soft fabric of his shirt and along the length of his lower arm. Cas shivered, suddenly heady with need, he turned his head and brushed his lips against the curved warmth of Dean’s shoulder, their fingers tangling together.  As Dean rolled back into the contact a spring deep in the mattress shifted, surprisingly loud against the quiet percussion of their breathing.  The gap between them closed painfully slowly.
Shrewd brown eyes flicked across Bess’ face as she squeezed the hand in hers a little tighter, digging a neat line of nails into the side of the crisp old palm.  Marcy showed no reaction as Bess, keeping her face carefully hidden by her long blonde hair, widened her own eyes and flicked them in the direction of the alarm button.
so much I didn’t tell her. Not just about the custody case, but about Meg and Mike... I was waiting for the right time, for things to settle so I could explain it all to her but now she must think… oh God, I don’t know what she must think…and she doesn’t have anywhere to go, no money, no transport, if she hasn’t come to find you, I’ve got no idea where she might be.”
He wasn’t sure how close to the ocean they needed to be before could remove the loathsome collar, but as they rounded the last corner of the dunes. Standing in the very spot where he had first laid eyes on Cas, the man stirred in his arms. He glanced down and a pair of blue eyes, gazed back at him. Gently he lowered his legs, and shakily, leaning heavily on Dean for support Castiel stood on his own two feet.
Dean chuckled, enjoying the other man's smile. "Yes, I would be really grateful if you would drive me back to town and I do need to eat. I think, all in all, buying you dinner is the least I can do. That is if you'd do me the honour of joining me..." He could be smooth. He could.
He hears a sob and his face is wet and he realises it’s his own tears …
“Ok,” Bal says softly, “I’ll make your excuses, sweetheart. Go and get some rest and I’ll tell you my news when I get home.”
Dean sighs, “I might have kinda spat hot chocolate all over him, but it was on accident.”
He listened again, but there really was nothing to hear. He sat back down on the thin rubber of his bunk and rolled sideways slightly to fish the book out from under his thigh. It snagged on the fabric of his jumpsuit as he pulled it clear. The rectangular shape didn’t look right, something was off about the spine. He moved his fingertips over the book and caught a distinct lip. He played at it with his fingernails and felt it give, something was pulling loose. He fiddled some more until the object slid free, it felt for all the worlds like a ruler. A plastic ruler, why the hell would someone put a ruler in the spine of a book? He turned it over his hand, squinting, but all he could make out was the shape, a half inch wide, about six inches long but barely a 16th deep. It was mostly smooth, besides a small hard bump at one end. He felt along the length, his index finger dipping into an oval hollow… there was a click like someone popping bubble wrap and the vision of his left eye exploded with colour. “Son of a bitch!” He slammed his eyes shut and almost dropped the damn thing. The book did fall from his lap and hit the ground with a slam. He blinked hard and stared down at the object still in his hands. It took a few seconds for the negative afterimage to disappear. The LED that had popped his retina was now shining harmlessly on the orange of his jump-suited leg.
A hand closing on to Crowley’s arm. Soft eyes boring into him. “This boy has been through a lot.”
“So, when I spoke to you last Friday morning you sounded like the cat that got the cream and this week you sound like a kicked puppy and the only difference is that you are not seeing Cas as much, despite not ‘seeing’ Cas in the first place?”
“Don’t bother,” Castiel says, ungraciously, “I really don’t want to hear it.”
The key ring was shaped like an anchor.  Dean just knew even before he opened this door, they were going to be in a themed room hell.
Dean grinned. 'How convenient.'
“I need to check your dilation response, Dean.”
Blue eyes blinked under the onslaught. “I…”
“Gabe? Gabe! What is it?”
“Of course he’s been arrested.  He’s been charged with kidnapping.  He’s not hurt, but they have him on remand in some goddamn hole.  Gabe has some hotshot lawyer surreptitiously backing up the state-appointed newbie.  Dean is maintaining the line that he picked you up as a hitchhiker and you were paying him to take you to Mexico.  There was an almighty scrap for jurisdiction, at the moment the US Marshalls are using the facilities in Nevada.”
Angel - Castiel - stands over him like a naked Adonis, a slightly scrawny naked Adonis, but hey, a few more cronuts will soon fix that. There are still traces of blood on his skin, and he hasn’t quite finished shaving and his hair is spiking in all directions where it has dried while Dean has been mussing with it. He is holding out his hand to help Dean up and Dean isn’t entirely sure that isn’t going to fall over when he stands, he wasn’t kidding about his numb ass and the lack of feeling in his feet. The pins and needles are starting sharp and hot, but he couldn’t care less, because Cas is laughing. A deep rumbling chuckle, that fills the tiny bathroom - and Dean - with it’s joyful sound.
She leant towards him, and Crowley was suddenly very grateful that he had chosen the arm chair, he had a feeling he’d have been fending her off with the sugar tongs if he’d chosen to sit on the chaise. He made a mental note to push Winchester under the next available bus. No wonder he had let Crowley take this one after his conflab with young Jo Harvelle.
“The hostel. Benny offered to pay for the hostel… Oh…” Blue eyes widen with realisation. “You know. I have more than enough room in the cabin. You’d be welcome to stay.”
Dean swallowed and turned slowly, fists clenched, arms back. "Don't sell yourself short," he said softly, "You're plenty sweaty, I can smell you from here."
Agent Lomax was amazed.  He had been searching for incidents using the description of Castiel Angel, not really expecting any of them to bear fruit.  Having spent the last three days proving his own thesis by gradually excluding each report, he had found one that was both intriguing and worrying.
“Kid working on the car knew his stuff, too.  It was good to see Donald’s old workshop up and running.  And Marcy was obviously enjoying having him there.”
“You sent her tickets?” Cas said slowly. Something fluttered in his mind. Unsettled, a sense of wrongness.
Crowley was surprised at just how distraught the young man looked.  “If I admitted it was all down to me…”
“I’m sorry,” her voice breaks around an aborted sob. Great, now he’s made her cry. Angry as he is at the moment, he isn’t an asshole. That’s why he left. He can’t keep bumping into her and causing them both fresh pain if he’s not in the same town. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just thought it would be easier… to give you time to get used to the idea first…”
“Nah,” Dean shook his head, “for once, I am actually going to go and get some sleep. When does Drew's sister return from her holiday?”
Dean gave him a stern look, “I’m not driving my Baby off a cliff.”  The corners of his mouth quirked, and he took Cas by the hand, giving it a little squeeze.  “Even for you.”
“On her own?”
He closed his eyes, and within moments had drifted to sleep.
He wandered through the heavy oak door into the hallway, heading for the weirdly plumbed downstairs toilet. His footsteps echoed on the ancient tiles as he let his hand slide along the warm curve of the bannister rail at the foot of the stairs. The walls were panelled to half height, painted a soft, dark, chalky blue contrasting with the white of the delicately carved coving and ceiling rose. Portraits hung on the walls, each neatly labelled with both subject and artist. Even Dean, with his limited interest in painters, recognised some of the names. He let his fingers ghost over the ornate gold frames until one portrait caught his eye. A man dressed in Regency garb, that hung above the dogleg landing. The echoes of Castiel’s likeness undeniable in the handsome face and wide sensitive eyes. Lord Montague, Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1772.
'Dean wrote to me of his plans and begged me to come if I could.' He held up a hand at Castiel's horrified expression. 'Do not be concerned, our letters are all in code. Should anyone have come upon it, they would find only an invitation from a friend to visit his estate for the lambing.'
“How did you hear about us?”
She couldn’t imagine it; hearing what had happened was hard enough.
Sam dismissed this with a wave of his hand. 'How could I do any other? I have always felt Cas to be a brother of my bosom, this will simply make it official in my eyes.' He embraced them again, squeezing tightly. 'I love you both, and I am glad you have found happiness together.' He finally stepped back, and Benny motioned to them to step up to the anvil.
Spengler stared at the woman who had been escorted into the interview room.  “Mr Spengler?” She wasn’t young, but she was attractive. And very definitely not Dean Winchester.  He nodded, and then suddenly conscious that his mouth was agape, he snapped his jaw upwards and then found his voice.  “Who are you and where is my client?”
“I think this would be better explained in person.” The voice sounded even more gravelly over the crackling phone line. “Would it be inappropriate to suggest lunch?” He did not wait for an answer. “I could meet you in Fielding Square gardens if you are available now.”
It’s clearly an attempt for levity, but Dean sees straight through it. Cas looks weary suddenly and Dean can’t help but feel for him. “What’s not to like,” he says, giving Cas his smirkiest smirk.
He dreamt of his life before Her. He had always been an outsider. He assumed it was because he was an orphan, that his mother had done some terrible deed. The Selkie elders let him live amongst them, clearly meant him no harm, protected him even, but no-one seemed to wish to associate with him.
hurt. Y-------------------------- touch with
“Good, my Queen,” he replied automatically.  His smile was weary.
They found a neat little corner to themselves.  “Ladies choice,” he smiled pleasantly.
Castiel's heart thrilled to learn there was a place where such acceptance could be found and allowed himself to revel in Dean's love. That he had planned this beautiful surprize for him, to bind their hearts and souls together among friends, made his love grow to heights even he had not thought possible.
“I see.” He pushed the drawer he had open shut.
“But Drew was no snob, he never made me feel like pygmalion, he could be so charming when he chose. I’ve never met anyone who made me feel like Drew did when we were first together, and now…I’m more interested in my amateur dramatics and community work. He loved me in his way.”
“No.” Cas says firmly. “Dean, I saw someone on the beach. I thought they were watching us. I thought you were in danger and I couldn’t… I had to find out. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you, I thought it was happening again and I couldn’t bear it. I can’t lose you. Not like that. I just can’t. I love you, Dean. And I’m not expecting you to love me back, and I know we’ve more of less finished the renovations and it’s way past time for you to carry on down to Cali, to Sam, like you originally intended, but I was hoping...”
“And our first question is from Anna, aged 7.”
Cas bit his lip, and extended one arm, slowly, reluctantly, wincing as Dean unfurled his fingers to reveal skin raw and bloody from the rope burns.  He cleaned the burns with swift efficiency, wrapping them in clean soft bandages, wordlessly moving from one hand to the other.
The man in overall straightens and Castiel realises it is the owner of the fitting firm he met yesterday. He was momentarily thrown by the overalls, yesterday Yatin Banerjee had been wearing a sharply cut suit. “Did Balthazar send you to open up?” he says abruptly, as he recognises Castiel. “He only booked us for the half day today, and I got another job lined up for the afternoon and I’m two men down.” That explains the overalls, Castiel supposes, “I know we are nearly done, but you know Balthazar, he always wants perfect and often changes his mind last minute…”
Castiel couldn't help but smile at that. 'You know me so well.'
He rolled his eyes as a familiar rhythm rapped loudly at his door. He padded softly in his stockinged feet and smiled at his dark-haired friend, hair still wet from the shower, wet enough that it was soaking and darkening the collar of his t-shirt. “Patience is a virtue, Castiel,” he smirked, adding as he was firmly pushed aside so that Cas could walk in, “not one you currently possess, granted. You know I really am going to have to have words with your new boy toy when we finally meet, although if he’s half the man his baby brother is I can hardly blame…”
“And I yours, even the dumb ones,” her voice lilted with a little tinge of humour.
Mrs Andrea Nicholls was calm, the only indication of distress, her slightly bloodshot eyes, and the redness of the end of her nose. She stared at the detective, waiting patiently for him to speak.
“You’ll always be my baby, CJ,” Bart leans in and Castiel has to grip the bar rail to stop himself overbalancing as he leans away. “Admit it, you’re here because you hoped to run into me. Why else would you come?”
“Saw what?” Dean could sense the impatience in Crowley’s voice.
Henrikson made a gesture with his hands that indicated Lomax had the floor.
“What was his rig like? Sounds a bit like Carl…nice boy, runs the coast to coast around four time a year...”
“Your car likes me, huh?”
He was initially met with three wtf expressions, he pressed on and watched with some satisfaction as they began to catch the drift of his thoughts. “...it would appear, Gentlemen, that you have inadvertently foiled an escape attempt and poor Missy here was the victim of a fall out between the conspirators… once she had served her purpose in disabling the CCTV one of them decided to silence her. We may never know exactly who betrayed whom, without that CCTV, it will take quite some time to follow the trail of evidence to unpick exactly what CO Cooper was intending to do when Alastair shot him.”
Dean rolled his eyes. "You," he paused, "...are nowhere near as funny as you think you are." He cleared his throat, feeling suddenly flushed. “Shit, Crowley, I owe you an apology. I’ve put you in an awkward position, compromised the case. Maybe I should just resign now and save them the trouble of firing…”
His hands slipped down, and he felt the texture of rope as it burned into his palms.  He swung away from the bank, his feet and lower legs sucked along the gully by the pressure of the water.  Ignoring the pain in his hands, he used his upper body strength to haul himself up, and managed to brace his legs against the bank, wrapping the rope around his back and leaning into it.  He paused, breathing heavily.
His boss, Adler, a soulless man, more interested in his spreadsheets and bottom lines than educating and entertaining the public, is grudgingly impressed, although Castiel suspects this is mainly because of the positive response of their benefactors during their sneak peek visit.
“Is there anything else I could give you?” Her eyes were on the move again and Sam wasn’t sure whether it worse to track their movements or look away so he didn’t feel quite so much like a slab of prime sirloin. He decided it was better to keep his eye on her, lest she try to wrangle him to the ground or scale him like an exuberant chimp. She had continued to talk and he wasn’t sure what she had offered to do, but the sentence finished with, “...you know to help you relax and get to sleep?” Her voice was so casual. Sam could scarce believe it. The minute this crazy woman left he was going to lock the door and jam the key in it just in case she decided to add somnophilia to her repertoire of stalker behaviour. He shook his head, again.
“That’s not really the beginning…” Cas interjects, but Officer Mooney’s glare dismisses his demur.
Sam handed Dean the coat, and with one last nod to his brother, he walked back out of sight behind the dunes. Dean reached for the collar, but Castiel closed his hand over Dean’s fingers and shook his head. He pointed towards the sea, and together they made their way over the sand. The light of the dawn sky, reflected off the waves bathing everything in gold. They stood together, gripping each other a little tighter than necessary, with the onshore breeze blowing gently through their hair.
“Dammit.” Bal’s voice growled. “They’ve both left their phones behind.”
“No, I don’t gotta tell you, anything… just like you don’t gotta tell me your real name, or who Anna is or what - or who - you’re running from or why they want to kill you.”  Cas stared at him, mouth open in horror, and Dean shrugged.  “I’m sorry man, you talk in your sleep.”
The torch flashed over them both again.  “Good morning, Officer,”  Cas said, concentrating on slurring his words.  He squinted against the brilliance of the light and kept his face tilted, hoping that the scruff of two days growth was different enough from the clean-cut publicity image that had been running on every news channel for the last two days.
'Will you be returning with us, Samuel?' Castiel asked as they dressed their cloaks and hats.
Castiel is on the floor, partially leant against the wall, chest covered in blood, which is soaking into the towel around his waist. A coil of it runs from his chin, down his neck, and with a flush of relief Dean realises it is just a shaving cut. But that is not the worrying part. Angel’s whole body is wracked with deep tremors, making his limbs jerk, and his eyes are beginning to roll back into his head. He is shaking so fiercely that his feet scrape over the tiles and his fingers flutter against his legs like butterflies fighting glass, his teeth coming together over and over. For a second Dean wonders whether he is having a fit, but then Angel takes a gulping, frantic breath and Dean knows a panic attack when he sees one. Sam had enough of these in his early teens, once they settled back in Lawrence and his father’s alcoholism had truly taken hold. The pressures of school and the awareness of just how
