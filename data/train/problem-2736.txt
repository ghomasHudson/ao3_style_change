While Lestrade generally trusts Sherlock, this is a dangerous situation. John never explicitly gave consent and he can’t in this state, on top of being injured and kidnapped. He needs to be somewhere safe.
~~~~~
Reluctantly Sherlock runs up the stairs ahead of him and Lestrade half drags John into the atrium.
“Oh you
Richie, the one with the mustache, grunts and manhandles John onto his front. After securing John’s feet tightly, painfully, together, he gestures at Scotty to help him with John’s hands. The minute they cut the cord around his wrists, John tries to lash out but a strong painful grip to the back of his neck disorients him. A flush of instinctual submission seizes his body and the choking hold makes him lightheaded. With his body trussed up like this, John’s got little mobility.
John Watson’s cloudy gunmetal eyes are pointed downwards, towards the expensive Italian leather shoes of Mycroft Holmes, sitting across from him in his sleek town car. His face is ashen, eyes wide but unseeing. It’s obvious he’s in shock, and Mycroft doubts if John can actually hear or see him. His brother always did love a show, regardless of the aftermath when he left the stage.
-----
Sherlock knew this wasn’t right. John should be furious. He should be yelling and hitting him for his stupidity. He expected at least cursing and name calling. He wasn’t sure what to do with this.
“No. No, of course not.”
“I love you, Sherlock” John’s voice was pleading.
If you want to have an affair, there is no one better to do it with than Sherlock Holmes.
He didn’t deserve it.
You’re thinking too
Growling low in his throat, Sherlock pushes the blond onto his back. He’s able to deepen the kiss, rough and strong. John is scrambling at the smooth chest in front of him; trying to pull him closer in a desperate attempt at more contact all while he sucks at the detective’s bottom lip.
Mycroft offered a tight smile at the exchange before checking his watch imperiously, “Well it appears I’m needed elsewhere. Please put that software to good use, I hope to see a new post soon. Always a pleasure John. Sherlock.” John smiles at the politician and offers more thanks and accepting an invitation out to lunch.
John voice is quiet and raw. He stares at his hands, covered in blood and gravel, “Where…where are we?”
Sherlock Holmes did not want to open his eyes.
Even though it’s anything but okay.
John just nods and hangs up his coat. He didn’t take a shower at Baker Street, he thought it would look too suspicious and once he’d slept a couple of hours the full weight of the situation slammed into him.  He’d slept with his best friend, the man who betrayed his trust, regularly insults his intelligence, puts him in dangerous situations, and experiments on him for fun. There was a slight crush before the  whole Moriarty debacle, John will be honest. It was small and constantly beating in the back of his mind but a relationship with him…it wouldn’t work.  They complement each other  perfectly but John’s always needed more.
Sherlock releases the battered skin with a sneer a mumbled “Of course” exhaled into the heated air between them. There’s a split second John is worried the moment is ruined but then Sherlock presses the palm of his hand teasingly against the bulge in John’s pants, pushing his trousers down further as he does, and John is relieved he still wants to do this(and god isn’t that
They’re the actions of a selfish man but Sherlock’s never pretended to be anything else. Lestrade and John will move past this and Sherlock would get the hit of a lifetime.
“I’ll go start the water then.” And Greg enjoys the view as John struts into the loo, naked and flushed.
They stand in front of the bathroom mirror because it’s habit for John. It’s preferable for Sherlock because he can see the weary face relax, there in the reflection, underneath his gentle touch.
Sherlock’s nature telling him to push away the other Alpha and find somewhere private for him to care for and bond his omega but he’s fighting to stay in control.
. It’s tempting.
It’s a bad move because now those voices are getting closer and they don’t sound friendly. There are four of these men and they’re pretty big, the smallest one standing at six foot, easy. One of them is sucking on a cigarette and studying him. John tries to suppress the uncomfortable shiver that crawls up his spine.
There isn’t a white-hot passion gripping them, they’re both aroused but it’s secondary to the moment they’re having. They’ve laid bare their bodies to each other because it’s easier than laying bare their hearts. Eventually, John slides his body down Sherlock, taking the searing heat of his erection into his mouth. His tongue leaves languid trails of saliva down the warmth, kissing and nipping at his inner thighs, leaving sucking kisses at the head of his penis. It’s slow, it’s decadent, and John is trying to memorize every second because this is the last time this can happen. When Sherlock wrap his warm violinist hands around John, it’s overwhelmingly satisfying.
“What exactly are you playing at, Mycroft” He spits the name out like it has a bad taste. It’s a ploy, for something. The gifts, the visits, and the phone calls (yes Sherlock checks John’s phone but he can’t help it)…Mycroft does nothing without an ulterior motive. Seeing the smaller man smiling at his older brother in a way he rarely smiles at Sherlock anymore makes an unpleasant sensation grab at him.
“I don’t want to talk about it. You don’t want to talk about it either, not really.” It’s strange to see this man of science in this state. Quite possibly it’s the first time Sherlock Holmes can remember being willing to just believe in something, instead of analyzing every factor, variable, and possible outcome.
“Obviously not.”
The one on the floor is glaring at John through the blood streaming down his face. John’s about to start firing off warning shots when the blond alpha starts chuckling around his cigarette. He’s laughing at John, the man pointing a gun at him, and he’s confused. Before he can focus Scotty is tackling him, hard, onto the cement ground. The gun goes off, firing a bullet uselessly into a pile of boxes in the corner. The guy drives his fist into his face hard and John tastes blood. The gun skitters away but John doesn’t see where.
“Mrs. Hudson was worried about you, she implied you be in some amount of…discomfort when you awake. I assumed you’d want to retain some modesty between you and our landlady so I volunteered to assist you.” Sherlock’s shifting a bit nervously in his seat on the edge of John’s bed as he returns to washcloth to the water, “I worked out that you’d prefer me than her to see you like this.” After gesturing vaguely and John’s person, he suddenly becomes very aware of the state he’s in.
“I am not– “, but he can’t finish. Is that what this is? Like anger, but more helpless and melancholy, with a touch of fear?
“Sherlock…” There’s an audible gulp as John tries to steady his voice, “There’s a mass-murderer on the loose.” A particularly wicked nip to the sensitive patch on his neck makes his knees buckles. Sherlock’s strong arms around his waist pull him in closer and tighter and he can barely breathe through the pheromones in the air. “This- ah, this is not the best time.”
He found a Good Samaritan (who has been embezzling money from his naïve boss and was easy to blackmail into babysitting a criminal) to watch and wait for the police while he sprinted back.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s still trembling beneath the detective’s fingers. Sherlock ducks his head down, running his nose along John’s hairline and neck.
“They have to work around the scarring in your right eye from a previous injury obtained in Afghanistan. That’s what caused the first surgery to be so ineffective. It also explains why you started experiencing symptoms of re-detachment in that eye two hours before the other eye. Silicone will be used instead of gas to repair the left eye which initially failed due to the incompetence of the first medical professional we sought.” John tries to give Sherlock a reproaching look. The poor ophthalmologist on call at the A&E had no idea what he was getting into; he did the best he could. And part of it was John’s fault too, he was on so many painkillers he was hardly aware, barely able to tell anyone what he was seeing, or not seeing.
“Despite what Mycroft has implied: I am no stranger to sexual relations. The overdressed cow is just embarrassingly old fashioned. He doesn’t consider someone a true Alpha until they’ve penetrated an omega.” John’s never really liked Sherlock’s ability to read him like one of his textbooks, and he’s never been less appreciative of it than he is now.
Sherlock wondered.
Sherlock’s body is telling him to stake his claim, give a clear sign to others that this man was spoken for and to remind the omega that he can keep him safe from harm. When he hears John cry out he halts his ministrations. Letting go of the flesh between his teeth, he begins desperately pushing at the doctor’s clothing, manhandling him out of his jacket. He growls at all the layers of clothing the man insisted on wearing and ignores John’s protests when he throws the brick colored cardigan onto the ground behind him. As he peels off more layers from his blogger the scents become stronger and he can smell traces of even more people on him.
He’s a complete utter fool because this entire time he hasn’t been able to see past John’s condition. He’s missed the how he’s been hurting him by treating him this way. He saw but did not observe.
Arriving on Baker Street always filled John’s gut with a homesickness since Sherlock died – or didn’t die as it was. Outside the building, staring up the windows that opened the main room of 221B to the world, John realizes he hasn’t felt at home someplace in so long.
“No, god, no. But when it gets bad I won’t be able to control myself. I know I won’t, and if I drop and present in the middle of a bonding heat….well, how many alpha’s do you know could say no to that?” Lestrade’s blushing at the mental image, but he understands the concern. Bonding and consent laws get sticky and John is making his stand very clear as long as he’s still lucid: He doesn’t want to bond. He’s withholding consent. “He doesn’t want this, Greg. I mean, you could imagine Sherlock Holmes having to be domestic? The chemicals coming from my body are manipulating him, forcing him. He’ll resent me if this happens. I don’t want it to happen like this.”
“This phone call – it’s, uhm… it’s my note.” This can’t be happening
-----
“No, Sherlock, you don’t.” He’s exhausted and he wonders how often Sherlock’s actually been exposed to omegas,  “You’re smelling pain markers and residual heat pheromones. It’s my body; it’s just tricking you into thinking those things.” Painful, god, it hurts to say it out loud, “It’s not real.”
brushing it off as residual hormones.  Sherlock has his own study in self-control as he tries to ignore the soft body barely concealed by the thin cloth of his dressing gown.
“You don’t actually think he’d..?.” Lestrade knows things can get violent between alpha’s and omegas during bonding, especially when the omega shows reluctance but these men are best friends. Yet here is John more shaken then he’s ever seen the stoic army doctor at the idea of Sherlock getting to him during his heat.
-----
There’s nothing but the sparks of electricity where Sherlock touches him and it’s all John can feel. The nonsense muttering and litany of So Good’s and God’s falling from those cupid bow lips is all he can hear. Tobacco, coffee, and expensive soap are all he can smell. Nothing matters in those moments while he’s tilting and tipping over and spilling all over those clever hands and sweaty stomachs. He’s drowning now he knows it because he can’t pull air into his body.
John had to hear it from a
“I’m-“
“Nooo.” John sings out before pulling the door closed tightly behind him.
This chapter was supposed to be a lot shorter I swear I'm so sorry
, but look at us both.” Honestly, males of all secondary genders can be so absolutely oblivious.
He loves Sherlock, so much, and so carelessly that he would let the man break his heart in a moment. It’s a blind trust that surprises him because he’s never been open with anyone, never even felt the desire to be, but he’d let Sherlock cut him apart over and over and over again if that’s what he wanted. It’s a very real possibility if he chose to have an affair with Sherlock Holmes. He’s already betrayed his trust and shattered his world in the most public way possible and still here he is scrubbing the man’s dried semen off his thighs.
“I can do it myself.”
One night he hit John during a fit of thrashing and whimpering, waking to a frantic calling of his name and before Sherlock could say anything he heard a panicked “I’m sorry” from the other side of the bed.
But they’re still not talking, not quite like they used to. Sherlock is in the flat more than he usually is. In fact, John can’t think of a time when Sherlock left without him. Even when the moody detective leaves for the morgue or for some other science related jaunt, he comes up with an excuse for why he needs John with him. He isn’t stupid; the man is a doctor for god’s sake. It’s obvious to the two of them that Sherlock is keen on keeping the smaller man within ear shot. That still doesn’t mean they are on good terms, though.
“No, uhm, that’s what I came to talk about.” John is shifting uncomfortably as he drops himself onto the sofa, “Yesterday, what happened. Sherlock I’ve,” he gulps, “What we did yesterday we… shouldn’t have done”
“Just stop it– ”He’s dying, he knows it, he has to be. “ –
Sherlock took a quick look at John, his stubble, slightly wrinkled shirt, the puffiness of his bottom lip where he’d been chewing. The right side of his hair was mussed, from running his hand through it repeatedly. John’s skin looked very clean, soft, and he smelled minty.
Then there’s Irene Adler, with strong shoulders, long legs and a sinful mouth, but she’d dismissed John the minute he walked in on her covering his detective with her naked body. It didn’t matter that she was an alpha, John saw her as competition and a small omega growl rumbled from his chest before he could control it. Luckily, John never had to explain the slip up to his flatmate but he’d noticed a definite increase in casual touches and lingering hands. He tried not to dwell on the physical contact, and put his energy into working out his sexual frustration. Maybe he’d be able to find someone to get his mind off the lovesick jealousy of watching Sherlock obsess over the mysterious woman with the camera phone.
Coming back from his high, occasional stars still floating in his peripherals, John can feel Sherlock rutting and rubbing against his hip. He’s almost sorry he can’t touch and help but his muscles are still jelly, shaking and recovering from what might have been one of the best orgasms of his life. There's a demanding kiss and John can taste himself on Sherlock tongue and Christ if that isn't the hottest fucking thing.
John’s head snaps up. “Do what?”
All these useless thoughts bogging down his hard drive and distracting him-
John can no longer be a part of the work.
“Shit you stole him from his alpha? Our job is to make sure the powder gets to the dealers and take care of the rats, not go taking omegas.”
“We’re in my town car and on the way to my home.”
The pounding in his head is horrible; no one can feel like this and be alive, surely? “
It's you, John Watson
He’s snarling at the strong reek of strange alphas on his omega. He’ll definitely have to burn this outfit later. What he sees when he final gets down to John’s vest makes the snarl die in his throat.  Those tanned arms are mottled with a disgusting collection of violet and yellow marks. His faculties have returned enough for him to easily identify the marks. They’re handprints. Finger marks from wear Moriarty’s men grabbed John. The severity of the bruising shows that John tried to fight back and get away (and a small spark of pride flares in his chest at how brave his blogger can be) and he remembers why they’re both here.
tonight, and that’s as close to playful as he gets.
“Ah, Sherlock!” John stared at the man who wore a dressing robe over slacks and hair looked impossibly messier than ever.
John Watson: a study in unrequited love.
John came to terms with his feelings for his flatmate a while ago. He’s also come to terms with the harsh reality of his situation: Sherlock doesn’t want him. He knows it’s not entirely personal, from what he can suss out Sherlock doesn’t really want anyone.  That first night, at Angelo’s, John had been honest: he wasn’t interested in Sherlock. As far as he could figure out, Sherlock was just another self-obsessed arrogant dickhead Alpha and John wasn’t looking for an Alpha to control him.  It didn’t take long for him to learn that the detective treated everyone like that, man, woman, alpha, beta, omega…it didn’t matter. John’s has no doubt that he’s gotten closer to the detective than most others, from Mycroft’s cryptic conversations it’s probably a good assumption that he’s the man’s only friend…and John is absolutely in love with him.
The six murders are the only ones they can definitively link to the same person, but Sherlock suspects there are more. That many hits over the course of only forty-eight hours? Someone’s been busy. Hits? Yes, hits, whoever is doing this is purposefully cleaning out a stock of dealers, pimps, and loan sharks. Snitches most likely, but also people taking skimming the profits.  Before their assault, John and him had reduced the possible rendezvous points to two different locations and it appears they were close by. Their thug got nervous and struck out when he saw them getting to close to their hideaway.
Of course,
Sherlock was like a passing cloud in summer, offering temporary relief from the sun and heat but Greg is the breeze, the warm grass, the blue sky. He’s the sun so warm after a cold winter and mushy spring. Things with Sherlock, he can’t let them change anything. He doesn’t want anything else. When he gets up, carefully, and gives his partner a deep but chaste kiss.
John rolls his eyes. Sherlock really is infuriating, but John can’t help himself from one more kiss before heading out the door, running to catch a cab and call Greg to tell him he’ll be home soon.
“Erm, thanks John. I’ll try to see what we can do with that. From the look of it, that’s the first confirmed connection we’ve got between Moriarty and the hits.” Lestrade is trying to focus on the case, not the omega in heat sitting in the backseat or the instinctual response curling deep in his stomach.
hurts, but he wants it.
Shaking himself, John mumbles out, “Oh uh um yes no thanks I think I can make it to the shower downstairs if you could, I mean if you don’t mind…” John looks over at his dressing gown draped over the top of his bureau. Sherlock nods enthusiastically as he rushes to retrieve the item for his friend.  Handing it to the battered omega, he turns to give him some privacy. Sure that Sherlock was facing the other way; John rose slowly from his bed, clutching the sheets to himself. He keeps a moan of pain to himself as straightens up and slips on the gown. When he takes a step forward, a gasp escapes him and Sherlock turns to rush back to his side.
How could the smartest man of alive have been so
He will figure out how to fix him and John. He will figure out how to get the old John back. John will be happy again.
“You look like shit. What the hell did his majesty do to you?” Greg’s tone is so light but John freezes, dropping his keys on the coffee table and pauses. He fears for a moment that Greg can see right through him, see everything he’s done in the last eight hours written on his face. He doesn’t straighten up until he hears Greg laughing, “It’s like he never left, you know? Christ I still don’t know what to think.”
“For the record – I’m an
Female alpha's have dicks, male omega's have wombs. Female alpha's can't bear children and male omega's can't sire children. Dubious biology at best but this is fanfiction not science class.
“The Look…?” John huffs to himself. He’s tired. He doesn’t want to do this.
Was the night at the pool his own actions? No, the alpha felt his omega, a potential mate, had been threatened and he was driven to stake his claim. Then there was his fierce protectiveness last night. Of course he’d been concerned, John had been taken by idiotic drug smugglers but the spicy scent of John’s heat had flipped a switch in his brain and all he could feel was the overwhelming urge to sink himself into that delicious wet heat-
Greg gives a bashful chuckle and looks down apologetically before dropping a tender peck to the abused spot. “Sorry.” Although it was perfectly clear he wasn’t. Greg pulls out slowly from John, who shudders at the sudden cold. He reaches over to the tissues and wipes meticulously at John’s stomach and thighs. Spending just a moment too long appreciating the filthy image of his semen dripping sluggishly from John’s pink swollen hole.
-----
Sherlock strides over to the sofa and flops like a big cat, assuming his Mind Palace pose, “Mmmm no most likely not”. He’s got so much new information about Moriarty to process and sleep is the furthest thing from his mind.
Those dark blue eyes are wide and stormy, watery with uncertainty. Seeing the shaken man pulls Sherlock back from his feral state. He stalks towards the doctor who is suddenly the only thing he can focus on. The Alpha yelling
He spends the night hoarding memories into his mind palace. He memorizes John scent, the rhythm of his heart, soft golden glow to his skin, the way his sandy eyelashes rest against his cheeks…he trace the spider-web pattern of John’s wound, the very injury that brought the brilliant army doctor into his life. He tries to enjoy the moment he has here because tomorrow will come and with it will come a problem. A final problem.
Mycroft was playing games, being cryptic, leaving riddles. Sherlock detests riddles.
Eventually they left, Greg giving John a lift back to his flat.
Of course, it wasn’t the last time. It didn’t stop. Sherlock wasn’t a passing cloud in summer, he’d turned into a rainstorm, to a cold front, to a natural disaster. John tried to justify it, every blowjob in an alleyway, every fuck at Baker Street, every hand-job at NSY. All the time was intoxicating, it never felt like enough. John wished the feeling of being the sole subject of Sherlock’s attention would last forever so he wouldn’t come back for another taste, but he couldn’t stop himself. Every time he ended it with a “This stays between us. Really, Sherlock. We have to be careful”.
There’s not much foreplay or teasing, it’s been too long since they were last together and Greg would go crazy if he can’t have the feast in front of him. John can’t believe the gentleness of his touch and it’s one of his favorite aspect of the grey-haired officer. His job is horrible, his world is dark, and yet he’s still so compassionate. John’s a soldier, strong and brave, and Greg never belittles him or underestimates him but still he treats him as a precious, fragile thing. Like John is his most valuable possessions. If anyone else were to treat John Watson this way, he’d be irate and quick to prove his durability, but with Greg it’s different.
"Damn..." John swore under his breath, but regrouped quickly. "Fine, it was worth a try anyway. A compromise then... how about that Hopkins? I think he and I could agree on terms... he doesn't mind turning a blind eye to smaller infractions - it's only when it comes to murder that he takes things seriously."
, but that was generally an extremely unreliable proposition as well. It was much better when one had the proper means at one's disposal to guarantee a certain consistency in others.
"Yes."
The word '
"… because you're you," John whispered softly, his lips touching Sherlock's skin. "And now stop thinking so much," he added a little more sternly before his voice turned gentle again: "… and just let go."
Jacques cried in horror as he finally seemed to receive the message. “You cannot do that! Monsieur Watson...”
It surprised him every time how much reverence Sherlock held for him. It wasn't as if he did anything very special; he wasn't very special at all, and someone like Sherlock could have had their pick of... all of London. The fact that he'd chosen John above all others was a mystery to him, but one that he preferred not to examine or question too closely. At any rate... his plan to cure Sherlock of smoking once and for all seemed to be progressing nicely.
“Im-pressive,” John stammered, slightly taken aback, but he gathered himself quickly. “Then I can change my diagnosis from

lately. Your mood improved a lot after the first time you saw him. You were even whistling, John! Whistling! The last time I heard you whistle..."
Greg shook his head. "You don't need to recite a campaign speech to me." He plucked his jacket up from one of the chairs and went to the door. "And another thing... I don't need to be protected! Especially not by you! I can take care of myself quite well, thank you very much. I've done pretty well on my own for years now."
Yes: he wanted it too. And just like Sherlock, he wanted it now. He wanted to see it right away. Wanted to see the warm gold set off against Sherlock's fair skin. Wanted to see Sherlock glow and tremble beneath his hands. Wanted to see his initials in Sherlock's most intimate place... wanted to mark him... stake a claim... a claim that was that much sweeter because it was secret, something only the two of them knew about...
happy, Irene summoned him to one of the smaller lounges.
John continued to stand there, motionless, worrying his lower lip.
?" He looked beseechingly over at the mob boss standing beside him. "John!"
A fun-loving woman, once so full of life, she had finally been beaten by cancer. The hospital staff had already moved her to a private room, so that she could say good-bye to her loved ones in peace.
John skimmed the message under Sherlock's mistrustful gaze.
You can find cover-art and fan-art
"That was incredibly reckless of me..." John decided with amused despair. "Sherlock - my balls are as dry as the Sahara. Have mercy."
"No... I..." Sherlock stammered with difficulty. His tongue was no longer fully under his control, unable to form the simplest words. "That belongs to..." He paused and gasped for breath along with the words. That infernal finger was making it almost impossible for him to think. John, on the other hand, was enjoying seeing Sherlock struggle and didn't even consider for a moment making things any easier for him.
"... need to fix," John said almost at the same time, annoyed at how close Mike had come to the reality of the situation with his guess. There really wasn't anything that Mike would be
"All right, Charlie. Last chance," John said, his voice cold and his grin at its widest and most dangerous. He now held the rod with both hands.
"There's no reason to turn religious," Sherlock muttered, but Irene ignored it.
"Bloody sadist," Sherlock rasped, spreading his legs just a little more.
"Sherlock?!" Mike blurted out in horror. "SHERLOCK?! Oh my God... what happened? No, don't say anything... doesn't matter. Are you all right?"
John plunged his fingers harder and deeper than before into the willing body, which sucked him in immediately, like hot, wet silk. He gave in to the suction and didn't pull his fingers out, instead leaving them where they were. His fingertips felt once more for the slight swelling in Sherlock's most intimate place, and then tapped out a light, quick staccato pattern on the overwrought nerve endings of Sherlock's prostate, causing him to cry out with lust and pain. Even more pre-come dripped out of Sherlock's neglected and stiffly upright erection, further staining his otherwise flawless skin.
After several moments of silence, John pointed at the bed and said gruffly, "Lie down."
John - who said he needed
"No, John. Sorry. Those letters have to go out today," Mike answered. "Go on ahead - I have to use the loo."
me, in the middle of the night," he corrected himself quickly. After everything that John had told him both verbally and nonverbally today, John didn't
"You can also eat the quiche cold... I put in ham and mushrooms. Just the way you like it." Her smile now took on a decidedly motherly air, and Sherlock had no idea how he was supposed to react to that. How did she even know what his favourite foods were? John must be more attentive than he'd thought and gone gossiping. Or did she know based on the amount of food that was sent back to the kitchen when the table was cleared?
"He certainly would have, if I'd asked," Sherlock stated with pointed emphasis.
Victor's head jerked around in the direction of the two girls, and John was hit with a suspicion that was confirmed by Victor's next words.
"That's better ... Oh yeah ... you're good at that, you ruddy tramp ..." Rough hands grabbed his hair.
It was a sight for the gods, and John paused for a moment to bear proper witness to this...
John immediately pulled the crop away, directing it now toward Sherlock's bare chest. He tapped the leather tongue at the end – also called the tress – against Sherlock's nipple several times, causing Sherlock to gasp breathlessly for air, before moving on to his actual goal, allowing the tress to rest against Sherlock's cheek in a parody of a gentle, loving caress.
"Sherlock... you know what your safeword is for?"
"Tonight..." He licked lightly over the tantalising earlobe and heard Sherlock's faint gasp. "Your mouth..." He ghosted a kiss onto the spot behind Sherlock's ear. "My dick..." He felt Sherlock emit a small sound. "As long as you want - as often as you want - any way you want," John growled into his ear. "And you can swallow as much as you want." He released Sherlock, who tottered a bit as he moved away. "I've withheld it from you for long enough."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sniffed in dismay and walked into the designated direction with his head held high. Three officers followed him. When the door was shut behind the four men, John took a deep breath. He straightened his shirt, ran his fingers through his hair, looked at his watch without really seeing the time, searched the walls for a flight plan display, found them and stared at them without looking.
had been tossed out there, this would still be consensual... Sherlock was going into the lion's den of his own free will. Therefore, it wasn't rape - for Sherlock, at any rate. One more point of the
Sherlock looked up, hardly able to tell up from down in his state of unfulfilled desire, understanding only that John held the cigar in one hand and his stiff cock in the other.
"Well done," he said to him in a low voice, and Sherlock glowed at the unexpected praise.
Whatever it was, Sherlock's words echoed in John's breast, awakening feelings in him that he was certain he wouldn't like one bit, once examined in the light of day and with a clear head.
. You even
An awkward silence filled the room, broken only by the continued blare of the television. After a shock-filled moment, all eyes turned to John as if on cue.
?!” Irene blurted out, only to bite her lips a second later. How could she have reacted so rashly? Although it was a rather surprising announcement. She'd realised long ago that Doc Watson was head over heels for Sherlock and wasn't about to give him up. She was almost counting on a happy end with a proposal of some sort... but for it to be a business proposal instead of marriage ... that was unexpected. No matter – she was the last person to stand in the way of Sherlock's happiness.
John found it impossible to say how long he had spent crouching between Sherlock’s legs to deal with the piercing. He didn’t know how often he’d sucked on it, teased it with the tip of his tongue or just licked it – but he had never thought that he would enjoy it that much. If Sherlock’s never-ending sighs and moans were anything to go by, he seemed to find more than a little pleasure in John’s ministrations, and when the indefinite sounds that had escaped his throat so far turned into obvious begging, John knew that it wouldn’t take much longer.
Greg shrugged his shoulders lightly. "I stopped ten years ago."
Irene wondered sometimes what he would do if – God forbid – a fire ever broke out.
"Too bad," John said in a low voice, gazing at him intently. "By the way, I don't appear to be your only admirer."
"Sherlock," John replied tersely. "Yes, I was there a second time."
Sherlock stared at her, baffled, but hurriedly left her realm in order to continue smoking out in the garden. John would never forgive him for angering Mrs Turner.
," sounded through the material of his coat. Only then did John breathe a sigh of relief. No one had ever spoken his name with so much tenderness, and no one had ever looked up at him with so much relief and faith as Sherlock was right now.
... I..." he pleaded with a trace of supplication in his eyes, even as he feverishly sought for words. "Come back!"
He was met with a look of surprise. "The … glasses?"
Several seconds ticked by while John stared off into space. "FUCK!" he finally swore heartily.
He dropped hot kisses into Sherlock's curls and held his trembling body as tight as he could... withstood the feverish movements... felt the initial, telltale twitching of his hips... the tension in his muscles... the panting breaths against his neck... the fingers digging into his back... the brief pause... and then... the warm wetness spreading on his shirt.
There was silence for a moment, and then the call ended abruptly.
"Oh, God," Sherlock gasped. "Oh... my... God..." The ropes creaked again, and John's eyes tore themselves away from Sherlock's penis to wander up to his face.
They went up the stairs together. It was obvious how disturbing it was for John that Sherlock still had to rely on a crutch. Sherlock tried not to let the pain show that struck him from time to time, but one glance at the look of concern on John's face made it clear that he wasn't being very successful.
Doris stood up and turned away. Tears were running down her face, and she didn't want the others to see them. When everything was over, she would have to comfort Sherlock; she would have to be strong. But she couldn't do that if she allowed him to see her pain now.
The trip didn't take very long. Naresh was driving the car in place of Bridges, and Dave sat on the front passenger seat - his hands never far from his shoulder holster and the gun it held. The back seat was silent, with both men either looking straight ahead or out the window with deliberately bored expressions. But that was all part of the game, and they both knew it.
Before you tar and feather me... read to the end of the chapter. I've written an additional explanation there as to the whys and wherefores. Thanks.
“So?” John echoed disbelievingly. “That’s…” He shook his head. “I’d be pissed if someone made fun of my cock and I can’t… I just can’t… your prick
Jim didn't say anything; instead, he continued to watch as Moran put away the rest of the pieces of the gun and closed the case.
That very same day, John confiscated all the keys to his office from his employees and had someone come by to install a new lock in his office door. There were only three keys to the new lock, and they could be found in the possession of John, Mike and Sherlock.
Why did Sherlock never listen to him? Now he was going to complain of neck pains. Served him right!
"I wouldn't if I were you," a female voice said from John's left.
He raised his hand decisively and brought it down with a loud slap on the bottom that was being offered in such a tantalising manner. Sherlock cried out, short and sharp, more in surprise than pain, and jerked his hips forward in a delayed attempt at an evasive manoeuvre.
It was bitter cold that night, and John wasn't the only one with white clouds forming in front of his face, clouds that dissolved like smoke in the darkness - the other three figures' breath condensed in the air as well.
spying for Mycroft."
A warm glow appeared on John's face, the one he loved so much. "You've done well. I'm proud of you." A chaste kiss on his cheek that caused more emotional turmoil in him than a hard fuck would, and then John let go, got up, and moved away from him. "You've earned a little reward," John said eventually, puffed on the cigar and blew the smoke languidly into Sherlock's face.
"Sherlock!" He patted Sherlock's cheek frantically.
"Soon," John whispered. "Soon... just a little longer. Patience."
And there was something else... Victor was wearing a wedding band.
Obediently, Sherlock opened his mouth, and with a sigh of relief, John shoved his stiff erection between his lips and began fucking his mouth and throat with hard, indiscriminate thrusts, to which Sherlock had absolutely no objections. He was just starting to enjoy the rough treatment when it was over. Somewhat disappointed, Sherlock registered the brief pause, the almost impossible additional swelling of the glans on his tongue, and then … the first shot! Bitter, sour, and altogether John!
It wasn't just John's cock that was stimulated by Sherlock's voluntary submission, but his brain as well. It was a heady sensation.
How would the other mobsters react... and what was almost more important... what would Albright do now? Would he tip off the police? And drag even more things about John, his activities, and the entire mob out into the light of day? Would he do that? Would the pain of the loss he'd suffered be great enough? Enough to put himself in the line of fire as well?
"No, of course not," John growled. "No one said anything openly, but they all made it clear with their more or less vague allusions." John tore open the door of the minibar and stared at the neatly arranged selection of bottles.
Much too soon, Sherlock straightened up again, and John - ridiculous as it was - felt a loss when the caresses came to an end.
After twenty blows, Sherlock's buttocks were redder and he began to wriggle his hips restlessly.
John waved him off again. "Found out?" he asked shortly.
"Happiness is overrated," Mycroft remarked with a peculiar undercurrent to his voice.
Jacques took care of his task and brought the briefcase to the living room on the first floor, where he set it on the coffee table - as always. When he went back down the stairs, the music had stopped, and Jacques secretly breathed a little easier. Maybe Mabel would go back to being halfway normal again without that melodious brainwashing.
But who would believe him if he said he didn't have anything to do with the death of Albright's nephew?
"Piss off," John hissed.
"Good." John nodded. It's what the three of them had agreed on earlier. "And the private dicks aren't going to try to double-cross us?"
And all of a sudden, John realised that although Sherlock might be far from perfect, it was those very flaws that made him so ideal.
A young man in a demure yet dapper dark suit suddenly appeared out of nowhere before them to take John's coat, which he had slung over his arm due to the mild temperatures. The coat was then stowed in a closet next to the main door. The entire manoeuvre was done in silence, causing Sherlock to deduce that John had instructed his staff well and was no friend of unnecessary chatter.
Sherlock stroked his cock experimentally.
"A sentiment that's entirely wasted on him." He paused a moment. "At any rate, Mycroft is used to getting me out of all sorts of binds - no matter the cost or the effort, and generally without even bargaining. It would be unbearable for him to have the
"How many are there on your household staff?" Sherlock couldn't help asking, even as he remembered that John hated being called
“But it won’t
man wins here in London."
"Nouveau-riche, overblown, and kitschy - I know," John admitted with a shrug and a laugh. "But there's no other way to get enough light into this draughty hall … at least not when it's dark out," he added, waving his hand in the direction of the large, full-length windows. It was morning, and the almost garish rays of the robust, springtime sun fell through the clear glass, reflecting so strongly in the black-and-white marble tiles on the floor that it was practically blinding.
"That might be nice for a start," Greg said, his voice hard, and looked Mycroft directly in the eye. "Yeah."
"You forgot showy and inappropriate," Sherlock said, nodding at the chandelier, and John laughed.
He wasn't left in the dark for long, as he soon felt John's fingers touch his testicles, causing him to flinch a little.
"Kiss me, John," Sherlock whispered urgently.
Then he picked up his mobile phone and entered a number.
"It would still be better if we knew..."
"Are you really going through with this?" Irene asked, watching Sherlock smooth down his jacket in front of the mirror.
"Yes, that was Sherlock Sigerson. My new accountant. The man everyone's shitting their pants over because he's able to uncover each and every one of their little rackets." He looked around the group in a warning that everyone understood.
"I think we may call him Sergeij in good conscience," Mycroft explained with vague amusement. "He's completely trustworthy," he assured John. "The happy couple exposed themselves to several surveillance cameras at airports on South American soil... all of the tickets were reserved and paid for in the name of Miss Morstan. It's only a matter of time until I'm informed that my strait-laced, reliable secretary fell into the clutches of a marriage swindler and has disappeared to South America."
"Greedy … always so greedy," John growled at him in a deep voice, pressing three fingers against Sherlock's tongue.
"Why is that so strange? Doesn't everyone?"
"Sherlock Sigerson..." John finally drawled. "I'm afraid we're going to have to have a little talk."
John took a deep breath and turned his attention away from his inner monologue, directing it once again to his immediate surroundings.
The black limousine was being driven by a man with close-cropped hair. Beside him sat another man with a slimy, contemptuous grin.
"Jim? I don't know any..." John's forehead wrinkled in thought. "No," he said slowly after a bit. "I don't know anyone named
"I'm afraid not..." Mycroft answered lightly. "I've rather exhausted my repertoire, other than fisticuffs. But a scuffle is out of the question, as I'd certainly end up on the losing end of a physical confrontation. I don't believe I'm quite up to your par in that regard."
"I don't think I need to make it clear that none of this leaves this room," John said in a tone of voice that left no room for contradiction.
"Oh-ho!" John said, grinning. "Is someone trying to tell me who I can kiss or not?"
... but only if you call me Susan." She laughed.
"You said... you promised you wouldn't hurt me intentionally," Sherlock called after him. John stopped and turned back. "You lied," Sherlock said with an odd look in his eyes that didn't match the coldness of his voice.
"Sherlock is gone?!" John blurted out, disconcerted. He was about to say something else but just then his mobile phone rang. Without even looking at the screen, he accepted the call and bellowed, "NOT NOW!" into the device.
John's last words... they had been so unexpected. Sherlock had never thought of it in all his fantasies he had ever created for his masturbatory pleasures. To incorporate him into the scene! To make him part of his own debasing! To make him a tool in his own humiliation! John was a genius!
"All right... hands and knees, if you please," John ordered him, sliding to the side on the bed to give Sherlock enough room to get into the new position.
Sherlock tilted his head back and forth, considering.
"Money is no object," John said, facilitating his decision.
John shook his head in disbelief. "That's enough?"
"Oh God! I didn't even use a condom!" It was probably meant to come out as a shout, but little more than a hoarse whisper escaped John's lips. His utter horror was inscribed all over his face.
Sherlock knew the path his mind was starting down was extremely dangerous, and he should make every effort to avoid taking even one more step along it.
John's hands clenched. No, two bullets had definitely not been enough.
Sherlock took his lockpicking tools and went to the bedroom, where he pushed down on the door handle without bothering to knock. But the door was apparently locked and didn't budge. Inside the room, John must have noticed that someone was trying to gain entry, and he pounded his fist against the door.
- not Jack!"
Sherlock sighed again and ran both hands through his hair. "Slutty secretary and strict boss."
"Doesn't look like it," John said. "It wasn't so much after all, and the quality was pretty low. Looked to me like someone had cooked it up in their kitchen somewhere."
Mike raised his hands in a defensive gesture. "All right, calm down... no need to bite my head off. Was just an idea. But we do need to find someone. And soon. Eleanor is really great, but there's only so much she can do."
"We have to make time now, John," he called out to him crossly. "Or do you want to be the last one to show up?"
Following the lengthy, unwanted abstinence during his hospital stay, Sherlock's self-control was in shambles... everything was too exciting... too overwhelming...
John... with his hands in his trouser pockets and a faintly amused yet severe and uncompromising look in his eyes that made Sherlock's heart beat faster.
"Oh, I have an idea..." Moriarty declared lightly. "You'll hear from me."
Sugary.
John - who thanked
"Yes, it did at that," John admitted. "They weren't expecting that...
Martinique. It must be Martinique.
A week after the mayoral election, Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade strode into City Hall. A single, courageous ray of the setting sun had struggled through the rainclouds, causing the crests of the waves on the Thames to glitter like diamonds for a brief moment.
*********************************************************
"And then... one of my former clients is sitting at the next table. What then?" he asked in a voice that was both more cutting and more forlorn than he'd intended. This was more than just an excuse for Sherlock. More than a variant of the lie he'd built up. It was something that really concerned him. Not for his sake... but for John's.
"HELLO?!" John shouted, interrupting them. Two heads jerked around towards him, irked and a little shamefaced. "Is anyone other than me interested in the fact that someone's trying to pit the mob and the politicians against each other?"
He thought he could hear the wet smacking sound of Sherlock pulling the beads out of his irritated pucker. No matter what it was... the sound went right through to his core... sending hot shivers down his back and making his cock throb.
Absolute bewilderment engraved itself on Sherlock's face. "Will you come back?" he finally asked cautiously.
John had a briefcase in his hand, which he handed over to Jacques with a slightly irritated look.
As a kind of avoidance behaviour, John smeared a generous portion of lubricant onto his fingers and, after several teasing touches, inserted one into Sherlock's eager, waiting body. A long, drawn-out sigh accompanied the act, and Sherlock jerked his hips in an obvious attempt to speed up the rate at which John's finger entered his body, and to get it to go deeper.
. Nothing better either. He usually knocks when I..." John stopped short, his forehead creasing momentarily. "When I have a friend here. He doesn't always remember at first, though - but I only need to remind him once. It won't happen again." After a moment's reflection, he added, "He may actually have been horrified, but he's too well trained to let it show."
Sherlock respiration increased and he automatically pressed himself even closer to his beloved, imagining what it would be like if he had not just one but both nipples pierced... and if John attached a couple of pretty little weights to them... how it would feel if...
John stared into space as if bereft of all sensation.
Greg’s appointment as
Tonight, Sherlock was finally going to come clean and tell John the truth about how he felt... tell him that he loved him... how
"Our pieces have been used a few times too often," Dave agreed. "Dimmock always turned a blind eye... but since Donovan's in there... And he can't get any deader anyhow."
Irene tossed her hands in the air. "Lord give me patience!" she cried. "Where was Doc even going? He doesn't know where..." Irene's eyes narrowed in fury. "You didn't give him the room number, did you?!"
John entered without knocking, pulling the door closed and locking it behind him. Only then did he take a moment to look around the room. Miss Adler's rooms generally provided all the comforts of an expensive hotel suite, and this one was no exception. A big, luxurious bed with dark red satin sheets, topped with an extravagant excess of pillows; a medium-high sideboard, whose function John was well acquainted with from earlier visits as the place where sex aids, utensils, and toys of all kinds were discreetly stored; and finally two comfortable armchairs set around a little table.
“Aaahhh – just like that, yes, just like that … please... just a bit more … just a little bit deeper...” Sherlock moaned.
“Where?” he asked with cool reserve.
Everything in the gallery was either round or oval, aside from those canals. Even the low, broad walls echoed the curvature, becoming so wide at their base that they led into the water with a gentle sweep, creating an effect more like a shallow-banked tarn than an artificial reservoir.
Dave and Naresh exchanged an uneasy look, but then Naresh went ahead and answered.
"That's not what I mean!" Susan cried angrily. "I visited Sherlock at the hospital earlier today. I'd baked some bread and made the poor boy a few sandwiches with it. The food there is nothing short of catastrophic, you could really have put him somewhere where they have better cooks, but that's not the point. The point is that he cried his eyes out to me over how poorly you're treating him."
Without saying a word, John flicked his index finger against Sherlock's sensitised, swollen glans, listening in delight to Sherlock's ecstatic scream.
"So it is a secret," Mycroft determined smugly. "I'm not quite certain, but the last time I cared to check, secrets weren't one of the guarantees for a stable relationship."
John raised himself and caught a glimpse of the last bit of come as it ran down Sherlocks fingers. His other hand was still busy pulling his nipples.
"What is it then?" he wanted to know, deliberately lowering his voice. "How can I help you, Sherlock?"
"No idea," Mike answered readily and yawned. "No one tells me anything," he complained darkly. His eyes wandered over Sherlock's sheet. "I'm going to order some breakfast from the kitchen. If you want something, I can order for you too - but you're going to put something on before you sit down at a table with me."
“We'll simply split the third one,” Sherlock announced, held one half of the delicate baked good between his teeth and leaned across the table to John, who closed his lips around the other half of the biscuit with a grateful smile.
"Thank you for..." Mycroft said with a vague gesture toward the used condom lying on the floor between them.
"This outcome to the affair is rather... unpleasant," Mycroft admitted unwillingly.
"Incredible..." Sherlock panted feverishly before his eyes rolled back in his head and he slumped down and collapsed.
And yet... he couldn't just put the day's events behind him.
"Lie back down," John murmured softly, working the plug into Sherlock's distended opening, which closed greedily around the thick piece of rubber, virtually sucking it in deeper and deeper until only the flat grip at the end was visible.
“I didn't pass out,” John protested vehemently. “I just... may have been a bit
"Look at me," John commanded with such calm and control that an icy cold shiver ran down Sherlock's back.
“Hands on your back,” John commanded once he'd been given the strip of leather. Breathing hard, Sherlock followed the order with a sigh of contentment. It wasn't exactly easy to tie someone's wrists without seeing what he was doing, but John had enough experience to master the task. He wrapped the belt around Sherlock's wrists several times, pulling the binding tight with the buckle. He checked whether the leather was snug yet loose enough not to cut off Sherlock's circulation entirely or do any other damage, and decided he was satisfied with his handiwork.
He took out a ring, but it was too small and delicate to be used as a cock ring ... something Sherlock (at least going by his expression) had half expected. There was a sort of movable hook attached to the ring, ending in a ball – not unlike the sort of thing used for piercings.
Sherlock would rather have died than become party to John's execution, for that's precisely what it was. He didn't want to live if it meant having to see John's cold, soulless body lying there in that forest of bricks... motionless and dead forever... He would rather have died than bear witness to Moriarty's triumph, to see the greed and lust for death flare up in Mary Moran's eyes and turn on him. Moriarty might even have forced him to take John in his arms, or staged some other disgusting scene with them before he'd let her kill him.
John lets out a strangled moan, feeling for a moment as though he was being ripped in two.  But the pain subsides in just a few moments, when john feels Sherlock’s warm seed flooding him. Sherlock’s moving his hips in small circles, while simultaneously working John’s swollen and sensitive prick. In less than a minute, John’s drowning in his own orgasm, body shuddering, muscles contracting, a near scream ripping itself from his throat.
-----
“Hmmm. Yes.”
He can’t take it anymore. The two of them won’t survive acting so out of character: John like a delicate piece and Sherlock like a doting caregiver.
Reminder: tags will change next chapter.
“Sherlock what in the hell happened? Have we not talked about this? This is a homicide investigation: do not go running off without bloody fucking back up.” Lestrade fumes at him and Sherlock just winces at the volume, brushing the D.I. off with a dismissive wave.
the opportunity from life). So, Sherlock takes his time, running his tongue over every curve of John’s mouth, tongues exploring, hands pushing off coats and robes and vests and pants. It doesn’t take long before they’re sprawled across the sofa, limbs entangled and breath mingling.
-----
He opened his eyes.
“Sherlock, the men,” John’s panting and it’s not a good sign. The heat is coming on fast. “Those men, they’re Mori-….they’re his men.”
And John is only smiling, watching the manic ranting because the case is back on and Sherlock loves him and he loves Sherlock and he hopes when he wakes up in the morning that this hasn’t been some kind of experimental drug induced dream.
There it was: John switching from melancholy to anger. Despite Sherlock’s mercurial nature, he loathes these mood shifts in the smaller man. He doesn’t want to put up with it today, he wanted today to be a good day. He’d just solved a crime, a 6 or a 7 at least due to the cleverness of the not-so-dead wife. Can’t he just enjoy the post case contentment?
Spent, satiated, and hedonistic on the sofa, the two laid, a warm midday striking across their bare skin through the window. John would have been happy laying her forever, until he realized the time, shocked to see he’d spent almost five hours at Baker street.
“Right…”
“Flatmates, I know. I thought maybe you were telling the truth despite how you’re absolutely covered in his scent. No bondmark, no children, and no bonded omega would be allowed by his alpha to go running around pubs by himself...” She’s fixing the lapels on her coat, and snatching her purse. “But seeing you two together…what? Does he get off on watching his omega with others? Well I can’t do that John, sharing an omega, well, it’s not natural, it’s so un-alpha…” Her tone turns soft and there’s a distinct look of pity, “and it’s not right to treat you like that. It’s not healthy for you.” John’s expression sours at the insinuation that he’s a delicate creature to be taken care of, but Jeanette continues, “I can provide for you John, take you away from this sociopath. We could be so happy, our children would be beautiful. Just don’t make me compete with Sherlock Holmes.” John does roll his eyes at that declaration.
John’s pushing himself off the thin man muttering apologies and Sherlock’s body feels too cold without him. The minute his feet reach the ground John practically throws himself back and away and begins furious pacing, fist pushed against his lips.
What happened with Sherlock was just – well, it does not need to happen again. If it doesn’t become a pattern of behavior and no one finds out, then everything could be okay.
“You just like talking about ash” John rolled his eyes but grinned anyway. Sherlock probably doesn’t even realize what he’s doing: trying to comfort John before his procedure. “Show- off”.
” John vomits, there in the back seat of Mycroft Holmes’ fancy car, all over the upholstery and leather, he’s shaking as he wipes the bile from his lips, “ –don’t be dead. Stop. Just for me.
Fighting with John wasn’t fun anymore. He rarely argued back and almost never got angry at him. It was not okay.
He scribbles out a “

“I love you”
” on a yellow post-it note and leaves it on the table.
“Sherlock?”
“Too quickly. I don’t think it’s a full heat. Usually I can feel symptoms for a week before the worst hits.” Maybe we’ll be able to remember some of it?” Sherlock feels his lungs tighten because the future is so looming and horrible and uncertain, “It’s probably just from all the stress and irregularity with my birth control and –”
“The Holmes clan would have a fit if I left you alone and slightly pissed to find a cab. Tonight was fun. Christ, it’s been far too long.” Lestrade sounded tired and John chucked a little.
Sherlock’s phone ringing broke through his panic
“Did you catch the men who grabbed me?”
I want to spread out the updates but I'm so impatient so it's a real possibility that I'll update tomorrow.
“No please. Not tonight. Let’s just…not tonight.” John lazily pulls the duvet over them, settling in for sleep and Sherlock mumbles a goodnight into the soft blond hair.
“You smell delicious, mostly…”
Sherlock feels hope flutter in his heart, while he untangles and rearranges their bodies so they lay comfortably while waiting his knot to go down. He lays spooning the small doctor, arms wrapped around his waist, hands resting on the soft belly he swears has become slightly distended from their mating and the copious seed his alpha biology supplied. He licks the new bond mark, hoping the natural bonding chemical in his saliva will help clean the wound until they can care for it properly.
Sorry for the confusing alternating POV's but I just want to make sure I address both Sherlock and John's feelings. The next chapter has a bit more action to it.
The tension between the two of them since Sherlock’s return was choking him and over their tired dinner in the den of two-two-one B Sherlock could feel a new dynamic shifting beneath the surface. He couldn’t pick a name for it. If he’d been anyone else he’d pick awkwardness, nerves, or the angst of unrequited love. But he’s not anyone else and all Sherlock knows is that he simultaneously wants to fuck the man in front of him senseless and run away as though nothing has changed: pretend that his best friend, his
“So it’ll be two different procedures meaning separate surgeries for each eye because each will require a different level of anesthesia.” John wasn’t going to get his hopes too high.
He grabs Greg’s body wash, a rich minty scent that reminds him of the man he loves in the other room. It foams between his calloused fingers and he needs everything his mind has come to associate with that scent. The smell of home and safety, the things Sherlock could never offer him.
“You're doing The Look again.” Sherlock needs John to stay right here with him. He needs to know John still wants to be with him, despite what he’s done to him. He’s taken away so much.
- “Goodbye, John.”
“My alpha? No, I’ve told you, he’s not my alpha we’re just- “
There’s a moment like a movie, when things are just lovely and Greg wishes he could thank God himself for the beauty of his life and his amazing partner. He’s not much for poetry but he swears the angels have given him more than he’s worth, after the stress of his job, the pain of his divorce and the guilt of sending Holmes to his death. And like a movie, it has to end. The credits are rolling and he has to deal with the real world: marked and muddled like the spot high on John’s shoulder. An ugly purple red bruise, an obvious bite mark. It’s not one he’s left, and despite the regular insults he receives on behalf of the world’s only consulting detective he can determine the perpetrator from a single glance: Sherlock Holmes.
-----
“It’s not like that.” John spits out trying to put some distance between them but his grasp is strong.
It was warm under the duvet from John and his body heat. John’s still asleep but the detective has been awake all night. Now he lies here, pretending to sleep; he won’t let John wake up alone.
Sherlock swallowed audibly, tearing his eyes from the  soft, enticing, body in front of him, and gave an embarrassed cough before speaking, “I know you’d prefer not to wake up covered in…well, you know, everything and it would be much too difficult to attempt to maneuver you, unconscious, down the stairs and into the shower. I brought a bottle of water for you too, in case you did wake up. I can leave this here and you can finish up the, erhm, sponge bath yourself, although you’ll be quite sore from your, ah, activities of last night and you’ll need help to bandage up some of the wounds. I can leave and come back when you need my help? Or I could not come back at all, although I imagine you’re quite hungry so I can send Mrs. Hudson up later…” What no shut up, shut up,
“But not omegas.”
The words are inaudible, spoken against John’s lips and chin but he gets the idea from the impatient tugging on his clothes. They break apart a few centimeters, far enough for Sherlock to rip off the jumper and vest in one swoop. The newly exposed flesh is mouthwatering and Sherlock takes seconds to catalogue it before he attaches himself to John’s neck.
“No not that!
and this is all he’s wanted, John warm and solid in his lap, pliant against his lips. Gods, why did he ever wait so long to do this? John’s moaning into his mouth and Sherlock’s mind is screaming at him:
There’s an ache building in his ribcage because this might be his only chance to be John.

him. His baser nature is begging him to give in, bare his throat and arch against the potential mate. It’s hard to ignore the part of him telling him to give Sherlock access to the glands that will release the hormones necessary for bonding heat.
“Shhhh…” He tries to calm John who is reaching towards him, wanting him closer, and needing to be filled. Sherlock wants to, gods, does he want to give the small man what he wants. His erection is throbbing, the knot already starting to swell a little around the base, and his blood is racing instincts screaming at him to impale the small body on his cock, make the world know whose he is. “Shhh…John
He’s tense, fearful of what this man will do. Legally, if he’s forcibly bonded and raped here in this shithole ruin of a building to this brute working for Moriarty, he can dissolve the bond, press charges and hunt the bastard down. Biologically, he won’t want to.
“It’s not –“
.” It was bad enough, all the shit Sherlock has to do for him. He wasn’t a caregiver yet he struggled to squeeze himself into the role for John.
(See the end of the chapter for
But it’s all they can say at the end of each day.
By the time he made into the living room, Sherlock was already draped across his armchair. “When will you be moving back in, then?”
John can feel the tender spots dotting his neck and shoulders, blooding pooling beneath the skin; he’ll be covered in bluish-purple splotches tomorrow. He’s panting slightly from arousal as he reaches his arm back and tangles his fingers in soft curls. It’s an awkward angle but he’s able to reach Sherlock and he lets him know what exactly he’s thinking with a clumsy clash of lips and teeth.
Sherlock stands up, close on his heels, “Where are you going?” he sounds alarmed.
On the ride home John’s lucidity returns almost completely and he knows it won’t be long judging from the cramps between his pelvis and the sweat gathering at the nape of neck.  He’s trying to ask questions about the case but the answers are curt and frustrating and he gives up on trying to distract everyone from the elephant in the car.
The confusion in his voice quells john’s fears and he just nods in what he’s sure is a slightly manic manner before pulling Greg by his shoulders so he’s on top. His weight is reassuring. Greg props himself on one elbow to keep from crushing his partner before leaning in for a filthy kiss that’s really just tongues and teeth clashing violently. He breaks off when John trails a hand down to squeeze Greg’s erection and the groan that rips from his throat is obscene.
“He’s not using me. We are just friends, not that I have to explain myself to you because this is over.” He pushes the door open, “you can leave now, thank you.”
Sherlock saw John arrive, watched him take the steps across pavement in front of Speedy’s, and take the short steps up to the door. John’s early morning presence was… a surprise because Sherlock had decided it would be days before John spoke to him again after what happened yesterday. It’s also shocking because Sherlock planned that when John did show up on the doorstep again, he would have his bags with him, announcing his return to their flat.
“I miss the color of your eyes.” His throat feels constricted.
“No Sherlock its fine. Well, no it wasn’t…but it’s okay because it wasn’t…” John chokes a bit. It was just biology. Sherlock doesn’t want him. It was just an alpha trying to claim a possible mate. “it wasn’t
John rolls his eyes at the man, poised gracefully by the window. He’d returned Irene Adler’s files to Mycroft, exactly one camera phone light, and came back to find him cradling his Stradivarius, bow at the ready as if he’s about to start his own private concert. He settled into his armchair, anticipating the ear splitting screeches and melodic low notes Sherlock oscillates between when he’s deep in his mind, but the man just stood there like a statue.
John smiles like a teenager, sick in love as he pushes the rest of Greg’s clothing off. The warm olive skin underneath his hands are all too real suddenly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I-“ He doesn’t want to leave John here, stiff and pale against the cheap tiles. He straightens up and looks at his hands, confused by their need to reach out and soothe his friend. “I don’t want to leave you here.” John’s head snaps up, a tense ‘what?’ leaving his mouth. Sherlock looks to John, his silver eyes cutting John to the core, fingers twisted in the cloth of his trousers to keep from reaching out to the omega “I want to take care of you.”
“Eventually, dear brother, you will figure it out. John is neither a riddle nor a wounded animal. Stop treating him like an invalid.” He stepped around the younger man and headed for the stairs. Before descending he stopped and turned back to face the detective. “I told you this would not be easy, but it doesn’t need to be difficult.” Letting out a longsuffering sigh, he strolls down the stairs and into his waiting car.
, and you’d like me to be accessory.” Sherlock has a sudden casualness about him and he steps quickly toward john, “No crime without a victim I suppose.” He pulls John up, gripping him tightly to his own body. “There
A jogger knocked him to the cement and he tried to half shuffle, half crawl to the wall of the buildings lining the street. Someone stepped on his wrist, hard, but they didn’t slow down. Pedestrians, for the most part, went around him, but no one helped him up. When he reached a relatively safe brick wall, he slowly stood and used the sturdy wall to hold himself up. He wanted to scream. He wanted to punch something. He wanted to cry. He wanted Sherlock.
It breaks Sherlock from his daydream; John isn’t his to have Later’s and Some Day’s with. ..just tonight, just right now, and he better not waste it. Nodding, he grabs at John’s hand and takes off towards his bedroom, John hobbling quickly behind him, trousers still trapped around his thighs.
Sherlock leans over him, hunched slightly and balancing all his weight on one arm to come face to face with the doctor. Their faces centimeters apart, their panting breaths mixing in the humid, warm atmosphere surrounding them; Sherlock’s free hand is stroking John’s waist and down his thighs, pulling his leg up by the knee to rest on his hip. John wraps his leg around the alpha’s slim figure. Sherlock’s guiding his cock towards John’s wet opening, the swollen head just starting to breach the sensitive rim.
Either way, Sherlock opts not to theorize until more evidence can be collected.
Lestrade lets out a pitying sigh and runs the hand not holding John up through his greying hair. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll help you.”
“Besides you can’t get too much worse at solving cases. Even with your vision at near perfection you still missed all the important observations.”
Too curious to hold off, Sherlock was flying down the stairs to greet him, alarming John who had been biding time to consider his words.
Those aren’t the kinds of words you can take back because you were caught in a moment of misplaced aggression. Sherlock wouldn’t excuse it just because John was too emotional to be rational at the time.
John hadn’t spent this much time being poked and prodded and interrogated by doctors since he got shot. Thankfully Doctor Hart is tolerable, he didn’t bother with condescending explanations and he was straight to the point.
“Smell?,” Sherlock growls softly as John tries to put space between them. He pushes himself away a few more centimeters in a very mature huff. “Sherlock, what exactly do I smell like?”
be okay, if this doesn’t happen again. If we don’t – speak about this.”
Crooked Nose is pushing his face into the crook of John’s neck. “Hell I might throw my lot in to buy this bitch myself.” The man’s breath smells like days old beer. He brings his hands around John’s waist and grabs onto the omega’s lower back, pushing his body against John’s. Seeing his opportunity, John throws himself forward and butts his head against the alpha’s. Tying his hands in front of him was big mistake and he’s determined to make them regret underestimating him when grabs at his kidnappers gun.
This story will have 5 chapters, and I'm working on completing and editing the last two chapters while trying to finish Time Waits for No One and The Blind Blogger.
Denial is spilling from his lips because John has never been so wrong and how could he even think that but John’s looking at him with pleading eyes, “Please, can I have some privacy?”
It’s not a power play by Greg, not a way to dominate John, a way for him to prove his strength. With Sherlock it’s a game with strategy and wit but with Greg it’s a journey. They’re on completely even footing. John doesn’t have to give his trust over to him in the same way because they’re on equal footing.
) boyfriend of nearly two years. Greg’s more likely to laugh him out of the building for trying to seduce the cold detective then lash out for his infidelity, but that doesn’t change that it’s wrong though. The blush taking over his face and chest is not from arousal.
bastard” The small laugh in John’s voice betrays his anger and Sherlock’s mouth quirks up in the corners.
There’s something satisfying about trailing his fingers on the soft skin.
John wants to throw up when he feels teeth scrape against the spot on his neck where the bonding gland is swelling slightly. Heat is flooding his face and he struggles a bit more but he’s weak and in pain and about half this man’s size. He’s at too much of a disadvantage and it’s mortifying to be this helpless. All it would take is a touch more pressure and the hormones will flood his body and send him into a microheat,
!” A harsh scrape of horsehair on taut strings makes John wince. Sherlock is testily storming around the desk, taking care to place his violin gently in the case. John stares, wondering at the reason for the outburst.  Frustrated hands rake through the riot of dark curls, before being thrown exasperatedly away at his sides. “I’m not
“A big improvement to your two-finger, key pecking method you had before, I’m sure” John’s rolling his eyes but he’s obviously amused by Sherlock’s remark. The teasing is good, it makes it feel more like things were before.
“Good, he won’t miss any of the fun, then,” The blond one says around his cigarette. He’s flicking a small blade absentmindedly. He hasn’t moved from his seat on an old crate. They seem to be in a dank abandoned room; windows boarded over and covered mostly by stacks of boxes and crates. There’s a portable heater in the far corner of the room where his captors were sitting around. Three of his attackers are prowling around him
Decision made, he pulls himself off the sofa and to his full height. Stalking toward the fidgeting doctor, he rumbles a low, “John”, stopping the man’s nervous movements.
Taking a deep breath, like he was about to plunge into the ocean, John steadied himself.
Sherlock kisses him in return, just a light brush of lips on his forehead, but cannot return the smile. That’s fine. It’s all fine: because John can’t see the slight frown tugging at his lips.
‘Nothing’ is incorrect. He saw grey and white and strange smudgy colors. He didn’t see the pained expression on Sherlock’s face.
The Woman’s presence had thrown a new problem into their relationship. It was making John wonder about Sherlock’s past, and how little he knew. Mycroft’s taunting “
John feels the cold metal of the contraption leave his face and flinches slightly as bright spots break through his hazy world. Doctor Hart must be fiddling with the slit lamp.
A digital female voice came from the computer speakers, “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and John was grinning wide and chuckling softly while looking in the general direction of Mycroft. Sherlock cleared his throat to announce his presence, John jumped slightly and the smile shrunk considerably. Mycroft’s own smirk disappeared as he acknowledged his brother.
Not useless; related to John: anything related to John is of upmost significance.
One of Sherlock’s favorite things is helping John shave. John makes it known one every occasion that he can, in fact, do this himself, and the detective believes him. The ex-Army surgeon has steady, cautious hands.
John lets out an embarrassing whimper at the pressure on his wrists. Eyes widening, “Of course…” the towering alpha pushes his nose into John’s collarbone leaving a trail of warm breath as he moves along John’s throat. A dark chuckle coming from the man’s throat makes John nervous.  “You’re an omega. You’re just convenient fuck for him, aren’t you? Shame he hasn’t bonded with you yet.”
Sherlock had the man handcuffed (
-----
John’s shaking and whimpering a bit in the embrace but he doesn’t look like he’s trying to fight. This could get real messy real fast and Lestrade knows he’s going to need to tread lightly. He’s not dealing with Sherlock much at this point, but an alpha with an omega in heat within his reach. The pheromones in the air don’t have quite the same effect on Lestrade, he’s an alpha that’s been bonded before and he’s got a stronger hold of his instincts. He just needs to snap Sherlock out of it.
The brush of a cold, slick digit against the delicate skin of his entrance sends a thrill up his spine. Greg deepens their kiss until John’s entire world is the taste of tobacco and coffee before pushing the long finger in. He massages John’s inner walls slowly, running over everywhere but the swollen gland that drives John crazy. John gasps in deep lung-fulls of air when Greg breaks off to taste the salt on John’s neck and along his collarbone, leaving a small trail of light discolorations when he sucks a bit too hard on the flushed flesh. He runs the flat of his tongue over a pert nipple as he pushes in another finger into John’s tight passage and John arches off the bed at the stimulation.
Time is frozen, time is racing forward. There are so many people around him and then they’re gone. He’s moving, but he’s sitting still. He knows he’s not walking because his legs wouldn’t be able to hold him now. There’s a buzzing, a new one, coming in around him, getting louder. John is suffocating, but his lungs feel like they’ve burst open.
He slowed as he walked into the den and found John at his laptop with Mycroft draped over his shoulder talking to him about something on the screen. He watched as John smirked at something the older man had said, something Sherlock had missed.
“You knew me as I was two years ago.” Because John did want this now, he wanted his friends at the clinic, coming home, and having dinner, and falling into bed with the man he loves and then waking up the next day and do it all over again.
“Sherlock, listen…”He squeezes his arms between their bodies, hands flat on Sherlock’s chest trying to put some space between them. He swears he can feel the beginnings of an erection against his thigh and it’s making him weak in the knees. He pushes against the detective, hard. He barely gets a couple of centimeters between them before the Alpha is snarling. He grabs ahold of the smaller man’s arms and pins them to his side while latching on to his neck. He’s got the skin above the omega’s gland tight between his teeth. The harsh noise coming from him is clear: Submit.
Sherlock has his hand wrapped tightly around both of their erections, thrusting hard against the velvet, solid, heat of John. It’s not the most comfortable procedure, without proper lubricant, but between their combined pre-cum and a filthy lick along the palm of his hand he can feel his orgasm building, and he knows John’s getting ever closer as he writhes and gives aborted uncoordinated thrusts against Sherlock.
“No more games, Mycroft. Tell me why.”
The first time they had sex since the accident, it was messy and awkward. John kept missing Sherlock’s mouth and he head butted him a couple times. It was nothing like the fast-paced, adrenaline-spurred, passion they had before. It was gentle and careful and beautiful in its own way.
“To the toilet, Sherlock. Stop following me,” he throws over his shoulder at the looming man.
“Well, ring me the next time you want to watch my team lose and we’ll do it again.” John felt along the door for the handle before stumbling a bit onto the sidewalk.
“I’m bleeding?” John thinks and pats himself. He can’t feel much pain anymore. “My ribs?” Sherlock’s hand fly towards his friends torso, lightly feeling for anything over the omega’s shirt. John starts giggling. It’s ticklish and it feels very good. Brow furrowing in concern Sherlock starts helping the small doctor stand.
Sherlock’s desperate because John’s eyes will drift to the floor and he’ll frown slightly and sit in utter silence for an irritating span of time. He won’t let him run away so easily, not this time, not now when it’s so imperative that John fights.  Sherlock’s frustrated growl doesn’t so much as make John flinch.
“What are you doing out here? Come upstairs. Hurry up. I don’t have all day.” Sherlock dragged John into the foyer, letting go right before bounding up the stairs to the flat.
It’s barely seven now, and it’s a Sunday so John should have plenty of time to speak to Sherlock and be back. He’ll make it clear that it shouldn’t happen again, because John is honestly happy with Greg, and it’s too late for him and Sherlock to do this. He tucks his wallet in his back pocket and is out the door, knee bouncing and chewing his lip the entire trip to Baker Street.
John stared, a bit slack-jawed at the man rambling in front of him. He’s never seen Sherlock so…flustered. It’s a bit unnerving, if comical, really. He’s too shocked to notice that Sherlock’s barrage has trailed off awkwardly and they are both just staring at each other, John shocked and Sherlock wide-eyed and more insecure than John has ever seen him.
scared. He can’t afford to be scared because being scared meant seeing John as this fragile thing, something the ex-army doctor would protest greatly.
John doesn’t want Sherlock to change. He’s never wanted that.
It plays on repeat in his mind and he lashes out in his dreams: trying to stop it, trying to stop everything. He’s trying to save John, not just from the hands of a drug smuggler, but from the life that’s waiting for him when he wakes up, the life neither of them knows how to cope with.
You guys are only getting this chapter now because I don't want to do my ethnobotany project. I was going to wait a few more days but the need to procrastinate was strong.
“Sherlock, I appreciate what you’re trying to do here but going on about tobacco ash is not calming. This is the fifth ash-related tale you’ve told me and I’m far from relaxed.” John drummed his fingers impatiently on the arm of the uncomfortable chair. He’s starting to believe they make the seating this stiff and cramped on purpose. The staff wants maximum tension before they start jamming needles and sharp things into his eyes.
Hopefully the next chapter will be up in a couple weeks since it's already half written.
When Sherlock arrived at Baker Street, Mycroft was sitting imperiously in his armchair, fingers steepled under his chin as he stared intently at the door of Sherlock’s bedroom.
She walks across the threshold, sadly, “Dear god, he’s brainwashed you, you poor thing-“
“Why? Because you’re too busy wallowing in pity to see the high probability of success?”
and London and adrenalin.” He pauses for a deep breath. In and out. “So I miss the color of your eyes. I think that, for the rest of my life, I will always miss the color of your eyes…but there are some things I’ve gained since…since…” In and out. Breathe. He’s losing his composure and his throat feels raw. He needs to say it because Sherlock needs to hear it but he can’t quite, so he settles for what he
much but his mind is still trying to catch up. He still feels like he kind of wants to punch the man, but he’s pretty sure it’s the normal amount. Then suddenly the kiss is over and Sherlock’s rambling about brilliant and fantastic and conductors of lights and acronyms.
“Sherlock” The pacing detective is only making John more nervous.  They’re not bonded, not by a long shot, but their pheromones are definitely taking a toll on each other.
articulate, “but I’ll always miss the color of your eyes.” John’s trying so hard to let Sherlock in and let all the pain out but it’s hard. His heart feels stiff and underused like relaxing his hand after a death grip on his old life.
John lost Sherlock when he lost his sight. He can deal with being visually impaired. It’s hard, but he’s a soldier. He’s dealt with worse.
Sherlock rose and walked across the room like a predator. Pacing, soft in his movements but deliberate in his direction, “Does he give you everything you need in life, John?” He’s turned his gaze to pin John where he stands, “The man I knew was a soldier who rushed into danger, but you’re telling me you prefer the domestic scene now?”
How far are either of them willing to let themselves go?
“So…you have…you know…with, uh, people- someone” He’s a doctor for Christ sakes, yet he’s stammering and waving his hands around instead of discussing sex like an adult.
Even more remarkable than the doctor’s professionalism is his ability to deal with Sherlock throughout the boring examinations. John can hear the detective sighing and tapping and squirming in the cheap chair in the corner and it’s driving him up the wall. This is exactly why he told Sherlock he should go to his appointment alone and now he has to babysit a bored detective.
Sated, the men lay there for a time, chest to chest, breaths evening out as their mixed ejaculate grows cold and tacky between them. John reaches over Sherlock’s shoulder, half climbing over him to grab a towel off the bedside table. He begins wiping of Sherlock’s chest and stomach before cleaning off his own abdomen, giving a perfunctory, but gentle, wipe around each of their sensitive groins. They really need a shower to clean off the stink of sex but he’s too spent to do that much moving.
John looks a bit taken aback at the concern and he’s staring at the pile of clothing in his arms, a slight furrow between his brows. “No. They’re just some bruises. I’ll get some ice or arnica cream for them.” It doesn’t feel right to leave it at this. He wants to say something, but what can he says that won’t strain their friendship any more than it is now? He settles for, “Will you be sleeping tonight?”
There was a steady stream of people on the sidewalk; it was midday in the city. They were bumping into the doctor, pushing him to and fro. A few muttered “Sorry, mate” but no one noticed the blind man stumbling around. He was afraid to move, not knowing which direction would take him toward the busy road and which toward his detective.
-----
John can practically see the great mind whirring with the new information but Sherlock doesn’t respond.
Except for John and it wasn’t fair.
Maybe some other time they can take this slow and Sherlock can get to know every crevice and fold of John’s body; memorize all the beautifully tragic sounds he can pull from the doctor’s throat. There’s too much desperation tonight, a quick release is what they need to break the last of the tension since Sherlock’s return, but some day Sherlock’s going to show John that he’s all he’ll ever need, make those pretty pink lips beg for him. God what it would feel like to be inside of John-
“John” the limbs lightly wrapped themselves around his chest “I know what you’re doing. You can’t…” a sharp intake of breath, “…this needs to be confronted now rather than later.” The detective was having trouble choosing the right words.
John feels like a lovesick teenager being rejected by his crush. He’s well into his thirties and he knows when someone is not interested.
He sounded sincere but the look in his eyes told Sherlock his was a power play, a challenge of sorts.
“He’s not obviously.” Sherlock’s gripping the sides of John’s face, trying to get those feverish eyes to look at him. “John, hey, look at me, do you need immediate care? You don’t appear severely injured.”
John’s instructed to lean his head back as the doctor drops a cold aching liquid onto both eyes. Hart continues, “I’ve seen people sit their bored out of their minds and I’ve seen people sit there chewing at their fingers and nearly in tears. Your friend there was certainly nervous.”
He fishes for his phone in the pocket of his denims, feeling ridiculous, hiding in the bathroom to make a phone call. The little voice in the mobile reading out his contacts to him until he reaches Greg, hoping the Detective Inspector is free for drinks tonight.
Yo it's been like 6 months since I've updated you have permission to throw things at me next time I take that long to update. I feel bad for the hiatus so have a bit of smut (consequently the rating got bumped up). I might go back and edit later but I really just wanted to get this out to you guys.
pointed at him. He was in the snipers crosshairs. The anger of someone touching his blogger, of someone threatening what’s his makes his instincts surge. Sherlock is supposed to keep his omega safe. He failed. He needs to prove he can provide. He can be a good mate and he needs the omega to see that.
Even now, splayed out beneath the older man, hands resting up by his ears, fists gathering the duvet in a vice, they’re equals. The strong fingers in his arse are scissoring at an even pace that betrays the urgency John feels. He doesn’t remember when he started  thrusting his hips back desperately but he lets out a low moan when Greg withdraws. He wonders for a moment, what he must look like, debauched and writhing on the warm bed.  Judging by Greg’s hooded eyes and heaving chest he must look pretty fuckable and he wraps his legs around his waist to pull him in close, the bulging head of his cock brushing John’s sensitive hole.
“Fuck….John, John…”
Being upright suddenly is disorienting and John grabs desperately at Sherlock’s shoulders to steady himself. Sherlock eases towards the door, encouraging John to take a step but his knees suddenly feel like gelatin and he’s falling against the detective’s chest and Sherlock’s hit with the scent of an omega in heat. He spots a small spot of blood on John’s shoulder right where his omega endocrine gland would be. The bastard bit him and at that realization Sherlock feels his chest burn with anger.
“Moving in?” John shook his head, it’s impossible to jump from thought to thought the way he does, “No Sherlock, I’m not moving in. I’m here about… well – it’s about yesterday.” His throats going dry with fear.
When he hears the tell-tale signs of John waking up, the snuffling and shifting and soft breath intake of a soldier unable to identify his surroundings, Sherlock’s eyes flutter open. He’ll never get tired of watching how quickly John’s face changes: from peaceful to tense to relieved to content in seconds. The blond man turns around to face his partner. He cups the man’s sharp cheekbones and gives him a peck that lands on the corner of his lips; pulling back he offers a small smile.
Stimulation to the area makes the endocrine gland pool with the hormones. One of nature’s clever invention, it produces a fake heat that doesn’t release in ovum but allows a bond to happen when time is of the essence. Normally it lasts from about six hours to a full day depending on the age of the omega. The older the omega, the longer it lasts and John’s not exactly young, pushing his mid-thirties. His body is desperate to be mated even when he isn’t and if this man triggers the bonding heat, he knows he won’t so much as struggle.
The politician slowly shook his head, more to himself than to his brother, “Pills and physicians will only do so much for the kind of pain I’m talking about”.
“We move faster without you and your dog’s anyway.” Sherlock struggles to stand up and grabs his head in his hands as the movement aggravates the agony behind his eyes.
How did this man know his name? Surely if he knows John’s name then he’ll know he works with Sherlock, and that friendship puts him more danger than anything else.
This can’t be real. This has to be a nightmare and by god if it’s not worse than all the nightmares John’s endured since war
WARNING: There is a small part with unwanted advances, non-consensual touching, and some references to forced bonding. Nothing explicit but it's important to warn you.
Also, Reichenbach. It has to happen. Sorry.
Sherlock would watch him when he thought he was alone, sitting in his armchair with his mobile gripped tightly in one hand, the other one drumming impatiently. He looked like he was listening out for something.
It’s hopelessly masochistic to fall in love a self-proclaimed sociopath married to his work, but what else can he do? He may not be a genius like Sherlock but John was almost certain he’d hidden his feelings for the detective flawlessly. He has nothing to offer the man, after all. It’s a fact made more apparent to him during Moriarty’s little “game”. He’s not mentally stimulating and he’s far from interesting but he’s so infatuated with the damn genius that he’ll give and give and ask for nothing in return.
“John
Sherlock feels the small man tense in his lap. He’s rigid beneath his hands but it’s not regret for his actions it’s….embarrassment?  What does he have to be embarrassed about? He’s done what others have failed to do. Sherlock Holmes is undoubtedly, undeniably in
You would have had this chapter two days ago but the internet went out and well don't even get me started.
Then came the Baskerville case and everything had seemed to boil over.
“We?”
Just the sound of Sherlock’s voice grates on John nerves and he can’t tell if it’s the anxiety of the possible outcomes from this appointment or the stress of a smothering partner.
John wasn’t that familiar with this area. He didn’t know where to go, “Sherlock!” Breathing hurt and his ribcage felt too small.
Sherlock knew he wanted to savor this, because yesterday he thought would be his last chance to be so intimate with John, but life is giving him an opportunity (or at least, Sherlock is
-----
John sighed, before making his way quickly up the steps. “Sherlock, I shouldn’t be staying too long, I just needed to talk to you about something”
It was only supposed to be a walk. Sherlock just wanted to see the area where the suspect was living; he was looking for some kind of soil to support his theory. John didn’t care that they were only out to look for some dirt (literally), he so rarely got to do something different from his routine he welcomed the excursion.
“Well,
John steps out of shoes and tugs off his trousers and vest; not bothering to put his clothes in the laundry basket before crawling onto his bed and under the duvet. Lying on his side he sees his crumpled cardigan sticking out of the mess on the floor. Slipping out of bed, he pads over to pick it up. John buries his nose in the soft material. Ignoring the embarrassingly-comforting ache on his neck where Sherlock was biting him earlier, he begins to drift off curled around the cardigan, because sticking to the warm knitted fabric is the faint scent of Sherlock and if he closes his eyes, and doesn’t think about it overly much, maybe he can pretend he never saw the repulsed look in his best friend’s eyes as he pushed him away.
The guilt would be better if there was someone to chase and find and kill but the men responsible are in custody and aren’t coming out anytime soon.
the inspector either I see.” Sherlock has to be happy with just a taste. Whatever he gets… but he’d been away for so long. “I thought maybe I could have fixed everything –“He clears his throat a bit, his airway feels a bit sandpaper-y, “I thought you wanted this too.”
John was not where he’d left him.
Silence sits between the two while Mycroft watches his brother shift through his limited emotional database.
He could have had it too, if John had let him in last night. Instead he had Lestrade sedate him. The idea that his omega had trusted another alpha has something snarling in the back of his mind. Realizing that John had felt unsafe with Sherlock in his vulnerable state causes something ugly to simmer in his ribcage; a sensation he can’t name but wants gone all the same.
-----
Have you ever known someone who thinks they're the victim in everything?
Leave notes.
“I’m…” Sherlock kisses along his shoulder “…a genius...” He nips at the skin along the doctor’s throat, “…not…” deft fingers rub at a dusky nipple and he plants a kiss behind John’s ear, “a mind reader.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t there when John was attacked and beaten so badly that when the detective finally got to him he was slightly delusional from pain and, what would turn out to be, a moderate concussion. Lestrade was called, an ambulance arrived, and Sherlock followed closely behind in Lestrade’s cruiser while he explained the details of their criminal’s operation that would lead to his arrest.
Sherlock’s mind is blank. There are so many emotions and meanings behind that confession that he’s afraid of running straight into a land mine and ruining the tentative repair in their relationship.
John loved Sherlock’s violin playing and the detective thanked whatever God there might be that one thing hadn’t changed.
“Sherlock.”
, he struggles to remind himself) and Sherlock doesn’t want to shatter the fragile thing connecting them. Sherlock pulls John to him, spooning the smaller man, away from the cooling mess they’ve left on the duvet and as the doctor begins to drift sated and sticky and conflicted Sherlock can’t stop himself from leaving a dark, filthy bruise on the man’s shoulder. John grunts a bit but hardly stirs. Anyone who sees it will know it for what it is, a clear mark of possession and sex and maybe it’s childish and spiteful but the next time John looks in the mirror, the next time he lets Gregory Lestrade undress him, he wants him to see that mark and remember that he’ll never feel the same with anyone else that he does with Sherlock Holmes.
“What? No.” He’s shaking his head. “No. Nobody could be that clever.”
Since when is this the situation? Since when does Sherlock preach to John about things like hope and strength and fighting? He has no right to accuse John of giving up. He wrenches his face from the man’s hand and turns his head toward the window and away from the sound of his voice. The silence aches.
How absolutely stupid could he have been.
Nobody could be that clever.
If John said no, right now, Sherlock would step away. It would take all his will power and that ache in his chest would probably implode.
He was so damaged. He wondered if Sherlock would get bored of playing nurse.
“Wait, John was with you?”
Sherlock didn’t understand what he was waiting for.
John’s anxiety was never such an issue before. The cases and excitement worked the adrenaline out of his system. He suffered from the occasional nightmare, and some cases hit him harder than others but he had it under control.
, John!”
-----
“Don’t say that.”
“It’s better we confront this now rather than let it fester and harm our dynamic.” The words sound rehearsed and John wonders if Sherlock read that in a book or got in from the television. They’re doing this, having this awkward conversation, because Sherlock feels compelled to. It’s just damage control.
All he’s ever wanted was John to be okay. Whatever it takes because he needs to be alright. For both of them. When he sees the greying doctor hurting, staring off into space, blankly at the wall, eyes empty and face sullen it’s like freefalling. It’s pulling the air from his body and his heart is in his throat, choking him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock is putting a hand on his lower back, unnecessarily guiding him around the table and the boxes on the floor. John just twists to dislodge him before slamming the door.
So Sherlock drives himself back in, his knot popping through the tight rings of muscles. His orgasm is almost immediate, enough to make his vision spot. It crashes over the alpha as he lets out a growl, moving his hips in small movements. Instinctually, almost without even realizing it, Sherlock locks himself to the tender spot of John’s flesh, right above where neck meets shoulder and tears into the skin.
John can’t help but feel bad at how he snapped at Sherlock. How could he confuse nervous fidgeting with the detectives bored sulking? He can read Sherlock better than anyone, yet he made such a glaring error. An almost complete stranger was able to point out the differences.
“John, even if this doesn’t work, it doesn’t change anything: not how we operate and not the work. Even without sight you still have four perfectly…” Sherlock stumbles for a word as John looks at him, a stormy pout on his face, “
John’s chewing his bottom lip guiltily as he nods in response, refusing to meet the man’s eyes.
There’s a short, sweet kiss and a slight nod and Sherlock’s gone, nuzzling John’s prick through the rough fabric. He mouths along the bulge and he can barely taste the musk through the damp cloth but moves to John’s hip, leaving hard sucking kisses as he works the pants down and off John’s body.
At first, John finds the warmth and close proximity comforting. The stress of nearly dying at the hands of a madman has set off his solider instincts but as the adrenalin works its way out of his system he’s more and more shaken. His biology is telling him that he’s safe in the arms of this
John’s thanking him as they struggle up the stairs together and he realizes that he’s going to lose his senses again soon, and probably for the last time before this painful heat let’s up. They have to pause on the landing when a cramp hits John so bad his knees nearly buckle from the pain. Waiting for the agonizing ripples to stop, he waves Lestrade to carry on.
“I’ll shoot you before you can move,” John growls at the youngest one, Scotty he thinks, who was pulling his own firearm from his waistband. Cigarette has barely moved from his spot. “I’m going to ask nicely and I’m going to ask once before I start shooting people. Now, please, if you will, tell me where we are.” He’s using the most commanding voice he can muster over the dull ache still throbbing in his head.
Sherlock has nightmares.
Small note to address anatomy and physiology in my omegaverse:
It was biology. Just chemistry. Nothing more.
…let’s-
The only sound for a few minutes was the tapping of a very expensive heel against the linoleum.
John stopped in his tracks and shot a glare in the general direction of the infuriatingly patronizing voice. “I’m bored, Sherlock. You of all people should know what it’s like.”
John had kept his eyes closed since the nurse had taken off the bandages. He thought that maybe if he didn’t open his eyes, it wouldn’t be real. Maybe they’d all been lying to him. Maybe this was one of Sherlock’s experiments.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock expected his meddling older brother to be smirking at him, maybe even demand a favor in return. The older Holmes did not look smug though, he looked…angry, disappointed even. Sherlock stood still in the middle of the den while Mycroft rose and strode over to him. He towered over the detective and wasted no time with quips or insults, “The next time I pick up the good doctor it will not be to drop him off at your residence. Good evening, brother.”
Now he always seemed on edge. He jumped from glass breaking, nearly had an attack when Sherlock dropped a textbook, and even someone knocking too hard on the door made him tense.
John wants to say something but he’s gotten so frustratingly close if he could just get his hands on himself- Like Greg can read his mind he releases John’s wrist and starts working his dick as he increases his rhythm to a near violent pace. It’s like a damn has broken and John has to use his newly freed hand to push on the headboard to keep from being thrown up the bed and headfirst into the cheap wood. It’s a passion he’s missed from Greg since work has overloaded them both. The honeymoon of their relationship ending abruptly with the return of a curly haired devil of a detective-
A knee slips between John’s knee and presses torturously against the erection growing in his jeans. He gasps obscenely and throws his head back, stars smattering his vision when Sherlock grinds against his crotch, frotting like a teenager. John’s grabbing at his silk shirt, trying to pull at buttons and he’s gotten about half way down when he feels pulling at his belt buckle and a rush of cold air hitting his hips.
“You’ll be solving cases, yet, my dear Watson.”
Greg’s smile nearly blinds the doctor, “That, my love, is an adventure I’d love to join you in.” John smiles back at him, just as fondly, maybe more, because it all seems so perfect.
You could.
“It’s coming on very quickly John.” The conflicting emotions are flashing across his bloggers face like a film. Sherlock knows that they were very clear to each other: they don’t want their first time together to be during a heat, when his animal brain is taken over by his rut. He doesn’t know how to voice the danger they face and the risk Sherlock chose for himself. He doesn’t know how this will end but he can hypothesize it’ll be with either Moriarty or himself being taken to a special room and burned. Maybe both of them. He doesn’t know.
, it’s normal. Natural. Just hormones and biology. Nothing more.” It’s physical. It’s the only thing it could be.
Wait. Pimps. The same person calling the hits is the person policing the group of pimps and slave dealers. The underground group selling off Omega’s to the hightest bidder. The realization grips Sherlock hard and he feels sick.
He wants everything back the way it was.
The detective can’t smile because John Watson’s beautiful, dark, grey-blue eyes are empty.
Life is hard.
They’re frozen for few moments, Sherlock panting slightly, and John simmering with self-loathing. Slowly, he begins to move around the lounge picking up his discarded clothing and not meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
“Sherlock?”
John’s response is unmistakable:
“As tempting as that offer is…” Lestrade rests his hands on John’s hips, not demanding, just feeling the solid body of the blond. He rests his forehead against John’s and looks in those blue eyes like they’re oceans and he hasn’t had a drink in days. His smile is addictive and John hopes he sees it for the rest of his life. “…and it is tempting, doctor Watson, I have to finish up these emails from this past case.  All that time away and Holmes has yet to gather the patience for paperwork.”
He let himself think for a second, as the pair maneuvered awkwardly into the too-small bathroom, that he’d like to hold John like this, wrapped in his bed, waking up with this pliant gold body clutching him. He thought about how his yellow hair would glitter in the morning light breaking through the window, the sleepy way he’d look at Sherlock, adore him, kiss him…
” at the palace twisted in the back of his mind. Sherlock obsessively researches the most contrite topics, yet neglects the absolute basic aspects of human nature. So what category does sex fall under?
. Finally, they’ve been stripped bare and John addicted to the skin contact, grabbing at the alpha desperately from his perch on the edge of the detective’s bed.
When there’s nothing but silence from the blond, he stalks forward and drops to a crouch in front of the man. He frames John’s face in his hands, tilting his head up, and he searches the doctor’s face. “No. You don’t want to get your hopes up. You don’t think it’s going to work. You’ve given up before they’ve even tried!”
He’s not in control of his body anymore. His mouth is rambling, his legs are moving, his head is spinning. He can’t stop himself, he can’t stop anything. “
Sherlock kept telling John how gorgeous he was and John just wanted him to stop.
-----
Eventually, everything settles. Breathing patterns are returning to near normal and Sherlock’s orgasms are coming further and further apart. John opens his eyes, he doesn’t even remember closing them, and stares at the gorgeous alpha above him. Sherlock is just barely keeping his head up, energy drained, and John gives him a sloppy, exhausted grin. He musters the energy to lift his head up when he feels a horrible ache on his neck. With a small gasp, he runs his hand along the tender area and feels the painful wound. His hand comes away with flecks of blood; matching the droplets John’s now noticing decorate the corners of Sherlock’s mouth.
-----
-----
Because there is no going back from this, not really. This will undeniably change everything, could ruin everything more than they’ve ruined it already.
“I’m not trying to do anything other take advantage of an excellent opportunity to educate. “ With a petulant sniff, Sherlock hugs his knees, cramming himself into his seat.
-----
It’s too slow for John and Greg is just gently pressing by prostate, enough to make the pleasure curl his toes but not overwhelm him. It’s deliberate, because Greg is nothing if not an attentive lover, to make this last longer. Greg is panting, hot and moist against John’s ear and he hears his name mixed with curses slip out occasionally. John’s rocking against those tan hips and making embarrassingly high pitched keening noises as the pressure in his groin builds.
They say when you lose one of your senses, your other senses improve. John can’t confirm this because everything is constantly a grey wash of white noise and numbness. A sea of disorientation and limbo.  It feels like being underwater for too long, surreal and torturous, vision clouded with bubbles until everything is a swirling mess and the weight of his clothes and thoughts pull him down. He’s submerged but he’s not drowning, not quite.
He was teaching John his methods: the science of deduction, how to see what others miss, and how to use all the facts to formulate theories (proper ones, not the half-cocked
Of course Mycroft sees right through him “Jealousy doesn’t suit you, brother.”
“We got two of them. They were driving a truck.”
“I want to go home.” Sherlock looked unsure about the suggestion at first, but John’s pitiful mumbling into his chest changes his mind instantly. He nods at the detective inspector and follows him out to his cruiser, Lestrade helping Sherlock mostly drag the omega out of the abandoned building.
The others jump into action, delivering a few good kicks and punches before their leader lets out a short whistle, calling them off.
He breaks the kiss with a lewd smack, “Too many clothes.” His bottoms are too constricting and he pushes at them, wiggling and kicking his pajamas and pants off. Next he gropes at Sherlock’s thin waist and pulls at the waistband of his black boxer briefs for emphasis. There’s a shocking moment of cold on John’s damp skin as Sherlock lifts himself up to shuck off his pants but it doesn’t last for long before he’s pressing back down on John, their movements becoming increasingly more frantic.
Short update. Sorry it's so wordy.
Thank you for being patient and if somehow you've held on all these years to see to the conclusion of this story than you are a spectacular beyond belief.
“My hormones are doing this to him, manipulating him-“
The smell of distressed omega was steady and strong coming from the blond doctor and Sherlock needs to make sure these damn windows are locked properly. And both doors. He can’t have someone breaking in because of faulty locks. His omega needed to be provided for, protected.
-----
any victims. Right, John?” John doesn’t answer, but he feels like a victim in all of this, as he wraps his arms around Sherlock without a second thought.
“Leave a note
you are.” John wants to chin her so badly he’s amazed he’s barely moved.
To make the situation considerably worse, he was forcibly scenting John, and judging from the pheromones he’s been pumping out and his erection, the Alpha side of him wasn’t going to stop there. It makes him sick and he practically throws John away from him.
-----
He won’t lie; the forced bonding heat was utterly unsatisfying when he could smell the tempting reek of fertile alpha so close yet he was stuffing himself full of cold silicone. Now he’s just sexually frustrated, trolling small pubs and bars just looking for a willing beta or alpha to make him feel full. He’s trying to tell himself it’s not about the sex, it’s about wanting a real relationship, but mainly all he can think about his having a real knot filling him up when his real heat hits.
“Okay.” So there it was. No omega’s apparently, so either beta’s or other alpha’s.
He wants to run to the other room and confess and apologize and hold onto Greg until he understands what’s happening but he’s scared. He’s never been this afraid, not in his entire life, and he invaded Afghanistan. Sherlock was the most important person in his life at one point, and he thought he’d lost him because of his own flaws and weakness. Now Greg is his entire world and if losing Sherlock wounded him, losing Greg would kill him.
“John?”
this is slowly turning into a multichaptered fic oops
“I trust you.” Is all he can choke out. John’s terrified, more terrified than he thinks he’s ever been…and he invaded Afghanistan! But the fear fades as Sherlock strips him of his clothes, peeling off button down and practically ripping the trousers from John’s legs. Sherlock takes only a bit more care with his own clothes, the stuck up
Deciding on his actions, John turns off the kettle and heads to the door to grab a coat and slip shoes on. He’s pocketing his keys when he realizes he should leave a note for Lestrade, who should be waking up in a couple hours’ time.
Silently, John stares up at the advancing detective; his stormy eyes are heated and the pupils are blown wide, John lets out a stuttering breath. His heart’s beating so fast he thinks it’s going to give out when Sherlock places his large hands on John’s hips, stilling him. They’re faces are so close they’re sharing the same humid air.
John’s hoping he’s hallucinating because the very last person  he wants to see is casting a silhouette on the concrete in front of him. It’s not Mycroft, like he originally thought, and right now he’d take the elder Holmes over the spectre in front of him and the only thought echoing in his head is:
The first thing John needs to do is talk to Sherlock, make sure he understands that this can’t fester between them. Sherlock left all of them behind, and he must find a way to fit into the life everyone has made for themselves in his absence. There is too much that wasn’t said, before and after, Sherlock’s disappearance and they chose the wrong way to say it. It occurs to him to try and text or call him, but he knows if Sherlock is deep in his mind, he won’t even hear his phone ring.
“Deduce it.” John punctuates it with a very deliberate press of his arse against Sherlock’s cloth-covered groin. He’s feeling…
Previous warnings apply: Tags may continue to change, there will probably be mpreg, and a lot of anxiety and panic.
The detective straightens in his chair immediately, poised like he’s ready for a fight, “What? Why?”
He was lightly grasping Sherlock’s hand, their contact almost hidden by his long coat. John hadn’t brought the white cane with him because he liked it when Sherlock subtly led him around the city. His Seeing Eye Detective. It was nice to be somewhere new.
He works at the cock in front of him, lithe fingers wrapped around the base while his tongue does cruel things to the delicate frenulum beneath the glossy head. John’s balls are pulled up tight, heavy with semen, and his muscles are twitching erratically. It doesn’t take a consulting detective to know he’s about to come. When he feels himself at the brink, John tries to warn the man, pushing blindly at his shoulder and crying out obscenities but Sherlock is unrelenting and when he massages the sensitive skin around John’s entrance his vision whites out.
To avoid any further harm to John Watson, he slept in short intervals or kipped on the sofa. Last night, he’d snuck into the kitchen to tinker with an experiment involving bees and anthrax spores after John had fallen into a deep slumber but had crawled back into the bed as morning neared.
Seeing the clarity in the detective’s eyes, John knows he’s getting his friend back. His arms are tender from the harsh treatment earlier in the evening but the pain is secondary because as Sherlock pushes him away and he’s filled with embarrassment and shame when he sees the disgusted look in his eyes. He was right in his earlier decision to stop it before it gets too far but actually seeing the repulsion in Sherlock’s eyes makes his stomach twist.
If Sherlock Holmes was a better man, he wouldn’t do this. But he’s not. He can’t pass this up, his only friend, the man he loves in front of him asking him to make him his. He can’t say no that, future be damned.
, made love to, Sherlock Holmes. He’d
He runs a hand over his exhausted face. He thought Jeanette might actually be a long-term thing, or at least a good couple of heats but her obviously archaic way of thinking was too much. John lets out a hysteric laugh at the way she insinuated Sherlock had been mistreating him in some way. Surely there has to be one willing alpha in the greater London area who finds John worth their time-
"It's just this drink. I don't actually like martinis," John answered evasively.
That was it! That must be it!
"No one was shooting at
"Why are you still seeing her? That's just... a money-making scheme."
"What do you have in mind?" Lestrade asked, his suspicion obvious.
"Did the man lose his mind?" Mike gasped.
Sherlock accepted his key with mixed feelings. On the one hand, it demonstrated John's complete faith in him - on the other hand, it didn't exactly make him any more popular with the maids. Whereas Eleanor was more of a follower and couldn't stand him simply because the rest of the house staff wasn't very well disposed toward him, he suspected that Anthea wouldn't so much as spit on him if he were in the midst of a blazing inferno. She probably held it against him personally that the bedroom sheets constantly needed to be changed.
Sherlock was still trying to find the right words. "But you... you didn't... you didn't finish with me," he finally stammered, his cheeks flushed red. Unfortunately, John couldn't tell whether embarrassment or irritation was at the root of the colour.
Irene blinked. Had she understood that correctly?
is right around the corner..."
“You, my dear boy, are going to balance the books for me.” Irene gave him a smile that was as sweet as honey. “
John exhaled slowly. The first traces of arousal flickered through his body. He'd always taken great enjoyment in breaking the feisty ones. And this young man was an extraordinary example of one such.
John raised an eyebrow and moaned in relief when he reached the bottom of the staircase.
That would be the first step... the first step toward finally taking charge once again over his own life.
Sherlock didn't know how long he withstood the erotic torture this time before his arousal again became too great for him to control on his own.
for so long now that his real name had been entirely forgotten.
John returned Sherlock's gaze steadily, but after a while he cleared his throat and said abruptly, "I'll draw us a bath."
"Bloody bastard," John mumbled softly in a tone of voice that other people used for terms of endearment.
"Of course he wanted more money," John agreed easily, as if it were no big deal. "He's getting a pay rise from Scotland Yard, after all. More work, more responsibility, and more pressure also mean more money. It's all been set up and everyone's happy," he said in an attempt to nip any further commentary - or criticism - in the bud.
Sherlock frowned. "Is he dead?" he inquired.
"Is there something I should know?" Greg pressed.
Sherlock shrugged and resumed rearranging his food.
“Right.” John glanced down at Sherlock’s cock which had gone a bit soft during their conversation. “Okay.” He gave Sherlock a toothy grin. “Now... shall I wank your teeny-weeny dick?” He asked with false innocence. Sherlock gasped and bucked his hips in a wordless plea. His cock surged into full hardness again. “Well...” John tilted his head, considering his options. “I don't know...”
He didn't do any of that, though. He simply stood there, his eyes lowered, with a grin that was surely nothing short of idiotic, as he attempted to comprehend the new turn his life had taken.
"Sherlock..." John whispered to him. "Just hang on a little bit longer..."
"A little of both," Mycroft allowed.
John shook his head again. When he spoke, his voice was raw. "I should have... known better. I
Holmes' gaze flickered. He almost looked bewildered for a moment. "I'm not acquainted with either this Charlie or Albright's nephew," he finally declared. "What are you talking about?"
John smiled, rubbing Sherlock’s back in soothing circles while Sherlock nuzzled his way into John’s neck like a sleepy cat.
"Do you think you can again?"
"Miiiike... bumblekins... it's still ringing!"
“No, not really. But if you'd ever let me finish speaking then you'd know what the good news for you is in all this.”
"You know exactly what I want to hear from you," John growled, yanked his cock out of the warm body completely, waited a few seconds, and then mercilessly slammed it deep into the fluttering hole, where he paused motionless for a moment before withdrawing again completely.
"Yeah, I'm sorry - Jacques refuses to give up any of his almond biscuits. He's even gone so far as to lock them up in a cupboard..." Thomas replied with an apologetic gesture. "He bakes them himself, you know? Not even Mrs Turner's allowed to see the recipe. Usually, everyone gets a biscuit with his coffee or tea … only with you..." Thomas realised a second too late what he was saying and cleared his throat sheepishly. "Would you like anything else?" he asked instead, adjusted the plate once more on the table, and straightened up to give Sherlock a questioning look.
"You have a visitor," Jacques announced in a somewhat huffy tone.
(the one I thought of when writing this scene... According to the description it should be made of rubber and plastic, which seems more hygienic to me than all that leather...)
Adamant. Almost concerned. Sherlock would have liked to sigh, but that might knock everything out of balance. So he didn't.
"Yes, he bloody well did!" Mycroft rejoined as he appeared at the foot of the staircase, breathing heavily. "We heard shots. Is everything all right?"
"Holmes," the mayor announced himself tersely when Greg accepted the call.
"Of course." It didn't sound entirely convincing. "Take care of yourself."
"Should I be?" Sherlock returned the question, frowning slightly.
“Well, I … don't know...” Irene giggled nervously. John sent her a look that was slightly perplexed for all that it was calculating. “So he doesn't know what your plans are for him? No, of course not. What exactly are your plans for him? I mean... where are you going to take him?”
"Who - is responsible - for this fuckjob?" Albright fumed.
John started a little before turning to him. “Yeah? What is it?”
He hadn't mentioned with a single word what John had promised him that morning... a rousing spanking for his extremely attractive bottom … and John felt a little bad about it. He'd withheld that particular pleasure from Sherlock for a while now, and today, when he'd wanted to reward him for his patience (or for what counted as
Sherlock glanced at the glasses on the table, half lost in thought. "A roleplay. It's never really... but I thought John might like it." He sighed softly.
me just to tell me. You never call me. Sorry if that makes me a bit suspicious. My interrogation methods might be deficient in your opinion, but my instincts are still in perfect working order, thanks much."
"If you've already done all the research on the internet," John began with poorly concealed sarcasm, "then you may have noticed that there are certain things you need to watch out for. To be safe. So that nothing happens."
What Sherlock wasn't so indifferent to, however, was the fact that his mysterious client was running late. He glanced in annoyance at the clock on the mantel. He'd been waiting over twenty minutes. This kind of behaviour was inacceptable. They could have taken care of all the formalities by now and...
To John's astonishment, Greg came over to them and laid out his parka.
"Okay." He heard John swallow. Then he repeated: "Okay." Gruffer this time. "You're going to think of me... every - single - second." He took a deep breath and let it go. When he spoke again, his voice had taken on a hard, strict tone. "Hands behind you. Spread your arse for me."
he thought to himself.
"How could that happen?" John hissed.
"Do it," he demanded, his voice raw. "Do it now. Here."
"Keep it up - you'll be in for a citation in a moment!" Greg threatened, not entirely seriously.
Once he was undressed, he draped himself expertly across the client's lap, as the man had expressed the desire to spank him. Sherlock was fine with that, and since – due to the similarity to John - his brain was constantly coming up with thoughts that were both confusing and stimulating, the prospect of a beating sent a shudder of pleasure down his spine. He shuffled back and forth over the man's thighs until he found the ideal position, and in doing so he felt the initial signs of arousal in the older man... his penis was already half-hard and pressing against Sherlock's stomach through the material of his trousers.
"Your brother's the one who deserves the laurels. It was Sherlock's idea," John corrected him. "There wasn't anything interesting in your flat anyway."
Aaaand... another cover (made by me)
With a loud click, he took the safety off the gun.
"Do you even listen to yourself?!" John roared at his friend, furious. "What kind of a harebrained idea was that? A passbook? Could you not think of anything more idiotic?"
"I don't want you to go."
"I know something's crooked here. With you, with Doc Watson, with that Sigerson, with your brother, with Dimmock, with Donovan... I just know it! And Donovan knows something. The way she's going after the mob isn't normal. She's already chalked up two successful operations! Honestly, now - where Dimmock was doing too little, she's doing too much. I don't get it! Donovan must have an informant. And I don't understand how you can just sit there the whole time not doing anything."
"Er... just a sec," John detained him a moment longer. "I just thought of something. There is something you could arrange for me."
With practised fingers, John grasped the butt plug, ripped it with something bordering on violence out of Sherlock's body, and hurled it away with a grimace of utter revulsion.
Sherlock flexed his back and arched into the thrusts, opening himself up to them in a way that John wouldn't have thought possible. The oversensitive muscles sucked on his hard flesh, grasped it, all but milked it, all while submitting to the hard, deep strokes with shameless abandon.
Sherlock blinked at him coquettishly. "You can do it like this too."
... all right, that narrows the field of suspects down quite a bit. So it can't be the maid or my cook. That leaves... hmmm... the gardener, Thomas, and Jacques. We can eliminate my bodyguards and Mike." A sumptuous moan interrupted his deliberations, as Sherlock - in an attempt to distract him - began to massage his arse. "I put my money on Thomas," John finally said with a sigh of contentment. "As for the others … I'm afraid they..."
Once Mike had closed the door a touch too firmly behind himself and the two men were alone once more, John resumed speaking.
"Of course," the cook replied. "Thomas will bring it up to you right away." Her gaze slid over to the young man before returning to Sherlock. "If you'd like something to eat … I could serve you a light lunch in fifteen minutes."
A chuckle lingered in John's throat. The sod really was entertaining, but he couldn't lose sight of his goal. He needed to show him who was in charge here. He couldn't allow the wanker to give such insolent responses – no matter how amusing they might be. It was high time to clip his wings a bit.
Then, when John finally left them alone in the office three days after that nighttime phone call, Mike was less interested in Charlie White than in the conversation between Sherlock and his wife Susan.
The first half hour was painful, and the sounds he squeezed out of the instrument were far from what he used to be capable of, but then it started to get better... his fingers, his hands, his arms remembered... his body and his muscles automatically did what they had once learned, and then... then it was wonderful.
"Hello, Mama..." Sherlock said suddenly in a soft voice, sounding both so happy and so sad at the same time that John's heart squeezed, and he pulled his hand back, suddenly uncertain. Sherlock lifted his eyes from the gravestone, up to the blue sky, and took several deliberate breaths before focussing on his mother's name again and continuing in a soft, tentative yet determined voice: "I've thought about what I wanted to tell you for days, and now that I'm here it's all... gone. I'm... I'm sorry, Mama. My life... wasn't what you would have wanted for me, I'm sure - and it probably never will be. But... in the end, it all led me to..." He stopped and hesitated before starting again: "I've met someone I'd like to introduce to you - Mama... this is John," he said abruptly, touching John's arm and pushing him gently but firmly closer to the grave.
No sooner had Susan shouted back from the kitchen, "No one dies that fast," than Mike's phone rang again. Mike groaned when he saw the number. What did Sherlock want this time?
"Wank your prick," John panted. "Do it properly... I..." John felt Sherlock's knuckles brushing against his abdomen in a rapid rhythm. John held himself up with his arms on either side of Sherlock's head and pounded even harder and faster into the body writhing beneath him.
"By the way... I had the concierge replaced," Holmes remarked smoothly. "Nice idea you had there. Very nice."
Hastily, he opened his flies, shoved his underwear down over his hips, and took his rigid erection, wet with his lustful appetites, in hand. He had to bite his lips in order to suppress a whimper of relief. God – if the gentle pressure of his own fingers felt this good, how indescribable was it going to be once he was inside Sherlock?
Naturally, he was now expected to lower his gun. Well, they could wait until they were blue in the face. He kept his aim on Moriarty, not to be distracted.
Mycroft Holmes nodded his head thoughtfully. "Perhaps not the loving, forgiving God of the New Testament. But... what about the strict, vengeful God of the Old Testament? There's a rather significant difference between '
John Watson, better known in some circles as "The Doctor" - a nickname he hated, but had grudgingly grown accustomed to - was bored.
"Mike," Sherlock broke into the flow of words. "You're not making it any better. Perhaps you should simply stop talking."
It wasn't just their bodies that melded with each other, as if cut loose from the world. The level of their arousal rose higher and higher, and their desire for each other grew deeper and deeper... a sensation of floating came over Sherlock, and his heart was filled with a lightness he'd never known before. He broke apart, found himself again in John, held onto him, and opened himself to him with one last trembling sigh.
... were you just on the phone with your brother?"
"Good," John praised him. "As a reward, you can take the Vaseline. And now get back on the bed."
“I would stop treating you like a child if you would stop being so imbecilic and stubborn and just ask for some bloody help!” Sherlock hadn’t meant to raise his voice near the end and the outburst took him by surprise. John was glaring at the space above Sherlock’s left shoulder and the detective’s stomach twisted a little. “John.” He gently coaxed John’s face so that he was facing him, “I don’t want to come home to you bleeding.”
“Go ahead to the safe house and send out word that the Met is onto us. Don’t let them know we’re looking for the rat. Keep it short.” There’s grumbling and a clatter and John’s trying to focus on the words but his head’s becoming increasingly fuzzy as the pain takes over. “You two: go get the truck ready. And make sure you haven’t been followed or bugged before coming back here or my boss will turn your skin into shoes.” His ribs ache so horribly he hopes he’s not broken anything. He hears feet shuffling as the men move around and leave. Are they going to leave him here? “I’ll take care of this one.”
“Where’d ya find ‘im anyway?” The voice is gruff and it seems to be coming from a wiry beta with an unkempt mustache.
The unfamiliar voices put John on edge but he stays silent, trying to get his bearings. They’ve secured his hands in front of him. Clearly they underestimate him, expecting a docile omega.
So many what-ifs. It’s not his fault, Sherlock and he have flogged that dead horse to no end, but it’s his body and he wants to take some form of control over it. The responsibility can’t completely sit with some punk-for-hire off the streets.
His lungs are imploding and his head spinning, vision fading again. “
Was Sherlock truly a virgin? No, he couldn’t be…could he?
Sherlock growls as he comes to in the dirt of a small bank off the Thames. He jolts up dislodging the offending hand on his should that’s shaking him awake. He’s about to snap when he sees Lestrade’s face.
Alright so I've got a pretty good idea where this story will go and I'll be changing and adding tags as it progresses. I didn't want to add them all and ruin any surprises. I haven't decided if there'll be mpreg or not because I'm not sure if I'm ready to write that.
“Obviously not since you’re clearly upset,” Adjusting the dials of the microscope, Sherlock mumbles barely glancing at the small doctor.
Sherlock feels his heart drop a bit at that, “So you’re not
The mention of Sherlock makes his insides twist painfully. He shivers a bit in Greg’s embrace and he hopes to play it off as anticipation instead of guilt. He gives a petulant grumble
.  John was taken, strapped to explosives, had a bloody
When it came to it, Sherlock was not able to give the news himself.
Watching John unravel beneath his body is making Sherlock burst with pride, and before long he’s lost in the sensations. Pistoning in and out of the beautiful omega doctor, growls rumbling from deep in his chest; it’s like a high he’s never experienced before.  He wants this to last forever and it almost feel like they’ve been rutting for days before he feels himself catching on John’s rim with every thrust. The knot at the base of his penis, designed by nature to keep an alpha and omega together to improve insemination and bonding, is swelling to full size. Before long, Sherlock can only give shallow thrusts when his knot is inflated too much to allow him to move freely.
It wasn’t until he started applying burn cream to the angry red skin that John spoke up, “I don’t need help with everything you know. I’m not useless.”
Sherlock noticed the slight tremor of his friend’s hand. He wondered if the limp would return as well.
“No, no, it’s fine.” John breaks out of his thoughts, mumbling, “It’s all fine.”
Objectively, Sherlock can read John’s patterns of behaviour and give a diagnosis like he would any factor on a case. Honestly, Sherlock can’t handle the reality of it. He’s at a literal blank, a limbo his mind hasn’t seen since his first hit of cocaine, mind palace blown empty with  one epiphany ringing along the white walls: John wants him. John Doesn’t think Sherlock wants him back.
“You could be.” The ease with which she has dissected the relationship between the two men make John very aware that he’s just another pawn in the game between two geniuses, “You’re so pathetically attracted to him, like a lovesick puppy. He’s territorial; leaving scent markers anyone can smell ten yards away. So
unbonded omega scent. So, no signs of a heat creeping up and no illness. John’s always been expressive and, even when he tried, thoroughly unsuccessful in hiding his emotions but the whiplash mood shifts are more Sherlock’s thing than John’s. Maybe it’s just a hormonal phenomenon, or maybe it’s just a new side of John developing.
He shakes his head, like he can shake the thoughts right out of it. When he hears the sharp snap of the bedroom door closing, he rinses off, his skin still smelling like the greying Detective Inspector. Wrapping himself in a towel and heading into the bedroom, he sees Greg undressing, unbuttoning the last of his shirt. John saunters over and pulls on the tie hanging around the neck, bringing those lips into a sweet kiss. Greg moans into the kiss and unfolds the towel the reveal the short body in front of him.
“You haven’t changed your stance on the outcome of the operation” The tall git knows just how to ruin the easiness of their conversation.
John wouldn’t hear it.
John’s still in shock when Sherlock starts kissing him and he wants to shout it back, that he loves him, too so

The tickling lightness in his chest contracted into a painful vise around his rib cage as the weight of what he had done fell on him. He couldn’t tell Greg, and he wouldn’t. Greg’s had an unfaithful partner once before, and though it didn’t make him cynical, John couldn’t do that to him again.
The warmth on his back is soothing and he leans back into it. “John. What are you thinking?” One thin arm is wrapped around his waist and another across his chest, long fingers stroking his collarbone. The detective is trailing kisses up his spine.
I already have some idea for another chapter but overall I'm not sure how long this will be. Probably around five chapters at the most.
When he turns down Baker Street and sees the ominous black sedan parked along the curb, he hastens to the door of 221 and flies up the steps to his home. Mycroft’s presence unsettles him, particularly because Sherlock knows the power his brother has. The politician could easily take John away from him and there was not much the detective could do without hurting his doctor. His threat during their last exchange could have been a bluff but it wasn’t worth the risk. He doesn’t ever want to risk John again.
“From the amount of debris the smoker had been there for between 30 and 40 minutes. The officer was too focused on the amount of the time the murderer had waited for his victim to show up and completely overlooked the truly important evidence right under his shoe. Higher quality tobacco keeps its form when it burns off and, coupled with the silky bit of wrapper on the ground implies the cigar was expensive and bought abroad.”
“Shit,” Jumping up, he grabbed his clothes, quickly dressing, and searching for his phone. He’s hoping Greg hasn’t become worried that he’s not home, yet. Once dressed, he spins on Sherlock, and rests a hand on his chest, “Sherlock – “

He’s gripping the sink, breathing through the irritation. He can’t see himself in the useless piece of glass in front of him, cold under his fingers.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “Yes, Lestrade. Keep up. We were investigating a lead together before we were jumped…” He explains like he’s talking to a child.
“I was just dropping in. I had a gift for the good doctor, I thought I’d show him how to break it in.” Ever cool and collected, Mycroft stepped away from John’s chair and towards his brolly, propped against John’s armchair. He twirled it between the palms of his hands, “It’s been awhile since he’s updated his blog. His fans await another harrowing tale of justice and deduction.”
” this can’t be true, “Are you sure?” are you absolutely sure, John?
That is not acceptable.

“I don’t know what kind of kinky things you and your alpha are into but I’m not interested.” Jeanette is storming off the sofa and John chases after her.
“It’s not biology, it’s not pheromones, and it’s not my sexuality,” He’s impossibly close and his lips are so close to John’s ear he fights an anxious shiver. “

alpha and he’s never felt better protected in his life. The hands on his shoulder move towards his hips and he stirs when those hands grip him and hold him place. His face is turning a bright red when he feels his flatmates nose travelling down his face. He’s nuzzling the side of his face, the curls tickling John’s nose. The warm puffs of air along his throat and collar are setting alarm bells off. Sherlock is
” Sherlock’s got such a tight hold of his arm and he’s pulled the blond omega so close all he can smell is the detective and he’s so damn angry at him but still he wants to get closer and bury his nose in that warm scent.  “And now this hound, that I saw but couldn’t have possibly been there. How?”
“- I was able to rule out several suspects based on the stiffness of the ash alone. From the color and density of the ash it was obvious it came from a cigar, most likely between five and five an a half inches. Bit outdated, so the suspect was older and most likely male.”
“John this could fix you. This is a real chance to go back to normal.”

He gives him a chaste, but heartfelt, kiss before turning towards the bedroom. He can hear Greg hit the kettle on to boil and the even clicking of computer keys as he strips in their shared room. He must be free from the office for the day because he’s making tea and not a monster pot coffee. John feels warm and a smile pulls on his face as he peels his socks off because it’s so rare for the two of them to have a day off together. Really it’s just rare for Greg to have a day off at all and he so badly needs it. Throwing his vest and shirt in the general direction of the dirty clothes basket, he allows himself to anticipate the promised quality time he’ll get to spend with his very foxy boyfriend.
“We need to get him to a hospital.” Lestrade is watching the interaction and even though John seems pretty out of it, the blood dripping down his chin and the bruises blooming on the blonds face are concerning. He takes a tentative step forward –
“Are you jealous?” God that smug tone has John’s skin prickling
“Yes, they are. And I’m sure Mr. Poppon would be
It looks like Mr. Holmes is done with talking to them, though, because he stands up and says, “I think today I will try lilies. Good-bye.”
“What do you mean, what am I doing? I’m decorating the heart-”
Sentiment was a funny thing. Right now, though, it was overwhelming, all negative, all bad, all fear and anger and worry and-
