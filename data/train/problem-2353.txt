“Come back to bed.” He adds quickly. He might be in love with the guy, but it was too early to talk about feelings. Castiel is happy to comply, and goes back under the covers carefully and hands Dean his cup of coffee. Pressed against each other, they sit in silence, sipping their coffee and enjoying the moment. Once their cups are empty, Dean takes them and places them on his bedside table before turning towards the angel.
“Long story. I guess we should catch up on everything.” Dean replies, before he quickly heads to the kitchen and starts another coffee pot to ignore the butterflies that disturb him when he looks at the angel. Castiel and Sam exchange a glance and follow him.  As soon as they’re all seated around the table, Sam starts asking questions:
“I don’t believe so. It’s mostly your soul’s reaction that we need to be careful about. But it might be painful for you."
Even though they’ve just spent a couple of days mostly ignoring each other and despite the tension still very much present between them, they head in the same direction once they arrive at the bunker. Dean insists on helping Cas clean up the cuts, and put some cream on his arm before they head to bed, exhausted. There’s still an uncomfortable silence between them, but they’re both relieved to be back in the reassuring familiarity of Dean’s bed, together. As Cas is about to turn off the light on the nightstand, he realizes that Dean is a lot closer to him than usual, barely an inch between their bodies, and he looks troubled.
After what felt like days, but had probably just been a few minutes, he heard heavy steps and panting. His whole body tensed up, until he realized that the noise definitely sounded human. He was so relieved when he recognized his friend that he let out a sob.
“I told you he sacrificed himself Sam, and the Empty took him. What else do you want me to say? Don’t make me relive that night.” Something in his tone must have been enough, because from then, Sam had stopped asking. At least for the time being. They had also visited Charlie and her girlfriend, Jody, Donna and the girls, and even stopped by to have a drink with Bobby on their way back to Lebanon.
“Let me?” the Empty laughs, then adds: “Boy, I’m older than God. You really think you can stop me? I’d like to see you try.”
Like the previous one, as soon as Dean is up, they pretend that nothing has changed in their relationship. It’s like they didn’t spend the past couple of nights in the same bed, almost cuddling.  Like Dean doesn’t know how desperately in love Castiel is.
After that, they don’t talk much, both preoccupied with their mission, hoping Sam and Eileen are fine and that the spell will work, but also worried about its consequences. The car ride to the casino is tense and seems longer than it actually is, even though Dean drives well above most speed limits. However, as they are about to get out of the impala, Cas takes a deep breath and turns to Dean, who shrugs him off right away:
- "Cas…please…" Dean was literally begging his friend. "I need someone on my side." He added with a pleading look. "I am not trying to be stubborn here, I just don't trust them and I am pretty sure working with them will backfire on us at some point. Look at what happened to you when we followed Mom the last time."
“It almost destroyed heaven last time. It won’t stop until I’m dead, it’s too late Dean.” Castiel replies, avoiding the hunter’s gaze. “It’s okay.” He adds, “I knew the moment would come eventually.”
Castiel wakes up with a start. At least he thinks he’s awake. He’s surrounded by darkness, silence and he’s cold. He tries to calm his pounding heart and tune out the voice in his head that tries again to make him believe that he’s still in the Empty. He reaches over the nightstand and manages to find his phone. The screen lights up and he lets out a deep sigh of relief when the faint light is enough to show him that yes, he’s in his room in the bunker. It’s only his second time having this nightmare, and if watching over Dean’s sleep after Hell taught him one thing, it’s that it’s probably going to happen many times over the next few years.
The angel only replies with a smile. He’s quiet, but as they sit in the car once the house is fully burning and before the locals start showing up, they drive away and Dean can feel his gaze boring holes in the back of his head. After all these years, he was used to the angel’s intense stares, but this was different. He could almost feel his soul burning at the intensity.
“When things got really bad between us, it might have crossed my mind. You said I was dead to you so for a while, I thought it didn’t matter. But above all, you have enough on you plate and this is my burden to carry, not yours. It shouldn’t be and I didn’t want you to take this as yet another mission, another thing to fix in the universe.”
“I’m not angry at you, okay? I get it. Hell, making crappy deals is almost a family tradition at this point. It’s just so unfair. You gave everything up, man. You’re the most loyal son of a bitch I’ve ever met. Your faith in God was unwavering for millennia, and then you rebelled, gave everything up for me and Sam. You’re so damn loyal to Jack even when things go sideways, even if it means standing up to the rest of your family and you’re the reason he’s such a good kid. You just deserve so much better Cas.”
“I missed you so much buddy.” He whispers against the angel’s ear, before burying his face in the warmth of his neck. He doesn’t know how long he’ll be around, so he decides to make the most of it, hug him for as long as he can.
"Jody, I love your cooking but after that hunt, and the crappy mattress I've slept on the past couple of nights, I'm ready to be reunited with my memory foam." Dean chuckles. Everybody else agrees to go back on the road, Jack’s condition being that they stop at the nice diner that's on their way, about three hours from Lebanon and Dean definitely can't say no to that.
He quickly closes the door behind them and closes his eyes for a second, letting the fear take over. He didn’t think he’d ever be ready to go, but he’s certainly not ready now, and the last thing he wants is Dean to die trying to save him. The hunter grunts bring him back to reality and he turns to face his friend who is still holding onto him, wincing in pain.
“No, thank you. I’m pretty tired, and I forgot what it felt like. I think I’ll go shower and head to bed. Goodnight Dean.” Castiel replies with a sad smile.
- “Dean. The plan failed. I’m not getting the Mark.” Castiel replies, slowly closing the distance between them again.
-	“Can we meet in Des Moines? I was on my way back to the bunker from Chicago. I should be there in a couple of hours, approximately the same time as you.”
-	“I wanted to, buddy. I just… I don’t know. I’m lost. I…” It was only then that Dean realized that he had been holding back tears since he left the bunker. And right now, he was so close to break.
Castiel stopped, just in front of the rift and turned to look around, making sure once last time that they weren’t being followed.
"Hey, what are you up to?" he asks, obviously trying to look composed even though the angel can't be fooled.
As usual though, things don’t go as planned, but a few hours later, they are all back to the bunker and even though Chuck is still around and Eileen has to leave, at least they are all alive and made it back home together, which definitely counts as a win.
“It’s taking me a minute to get used to sleeping again, but I did eventually. Thank you.” Castiel replies as he’s handed a plate full of warms eggs and some toast.
The hunt was in Minnesota, just a couple hours away from Sioux Falls, so they decided to drop Jack off at Jody’s on the way. They all felt like the kid could really use a break after everything he had been through. And since he had gotten his soul back, he seemed even more worried than before about having to use his powers and losing control. Plus, Claire and Kaia were looking forward to spend time with him, so all in all, it seemed like the best idea.
They reluctanctly let go to rapidly catch up on everything that happened while they got separated. Castiel’s heart had been beaming since he had heard the hunter’s prayer, but it almost exploded when he showed the blossom to his friend and saw his eyes gleaming with pride. After years of repeatedly screwing up, it felt good to do something right, something that could give them a shot at winning, the angel thought.
Castiel feels a content and at peace. Unfortunately, like every single good thing in his life, it doesn’t last. All of a sudden, the air in the bunker feels colder. Cold enough to have Dean and Castiel stand up and exchange worried looks. Dean grabs the gun hidden under the table and Castiel lets his angel blade slide to his hand and grips it firmly. They simultaneously turn around as they hear the sound of someone walking towards them.
“You gotta stop doing that.” He says a little louder than anticipated. As he sees the confusion in Castiel’s eyes, he adds: “Behaving like your whole existence is a burden, like you haven’t been there for us, for me, over and over again. Acting like you’re expendable, like you don’t realize you’re family. I know that you deserve much better than everything I’ve put you through, but by now you should know that I need you Cas. You gotta know I’d do anything for you to stay and to be safe.” He ends up taking a deep breath and closing his eyes, trying to fight the tears threatening to make an appearance.
The angel nods, avoiding his gaze, seeing that the hunter had finally realized that they were facing the Empty.
They started walked towards the rift while Dean checked his phone and announced: “Just about a minute left, let’s not waste any time here.”
“What do you mean by that?” asks Sam who still doesn’t understand why Jack is so angry, and why Dean and Cas walked in the kitchen together, with the angel wearing his brother’s clothes. Should he even dare to hope that they had finally gotten their heads out of their asses? But why would Jack be against that?
“I’m very thankful to be here as well.” Castiel replies, glad that Dean can’t see the tears that his words have brought to his eyes, but hoping he can hear the smile in his voice.  He almost regrets talking, because it seems to bring Dean back to reality and he drops his hands.
As soon as he steps into the room, it’s like the air is punched out of his lungs. His knees feel weak, and he can barely make it to the wall the angel had pushed him against that night before he collapses. He’s sitting on the floor now, in the very spot he was the only time he actually let himself cry for Castiel, as he had been paralyzed by the shock of everything that had happened a few minutes before.
Castiel would like to visit Jimmy and Amelia next. He pretty much owes his happiness to the man, and letting them know how amazing Claire has grown to be is a small retribution compared to everything he got from taking Jimmy as his vessel.
And then, when their time comes, they’ll get to visit Sam and Eileen. Dean hopes they’re going to have to wait for a while before they get to do this, even if he already misses his little brother. He can’t wait to make fun of his grey hair and hear about the rest of their lives.
- “I… I would have had to trap you in the Ma’lak box and bury you Cas. I can’t… I can’t imagine…” Dean’s chest was heaving and his eyes were full of tears.
“But you would be happier in the bunker with them.” Jack states. “You’d be happier with Dean. I can feel how much you miss him now.” He adds, calm as ever.
As the angel’s last words resonate, Dean wonders if Cas had already started falling in love with him back then.
While the angel was coming to terms with that realization, Dean feels the panic rise in his chest. He had barely survived it the first time around, things had become out of control so quickly. How long would he be able resist the second time around?
He takes a few deep, shaky breaths, brings his knees closer to his chest, and put his hands on top of them, brings them together in a praying gesture before he realizes that he can’t get any words out. He takes another breath, hoping to release some of the pressure in his chest and throat, but the only thing that comes out his a loud sob. He lets his forehead fall against his hands, and he’s grasping his knuckles so tightly that he’s probably going to end up with bruises. The first tears finally fall from his eyes, followed by many others. He can’t move, but all of a sudden, he can’t stop the words from coming out.
- “But it could have!” Dean cries out, pushing the angel away, letting the anger take over. “Things like us becoming a vampire and me killing Jody seemed surreal, but not impossible enough for me to laugh it off.” He shudders. “And when it comes to losing you because of the Mark, just thinking about how close we were…” The anger disappears as quickly as it had appeared and the hunter was now looking like he was about to start crying again.
loves burgers, he’s immediately rewarded by a proud pat on the shoulder from Dean, and the way the hunter beams at him makes his heart skip a beat.
But in the meantime he has great company, and a lot of lost time to make up for. He snaps out of his daydreaming and turns to face Cas, who’s staring at him with a soft smile.
He tells him everything. How Michael ended up being the one who saved the day, managing to reach out to Amara and how they overpowered Chuck together, keeping balance in the world. How they were rebuilding Heaven with more angels, with Michael taking its lead so that Amara would be free to roam around the Earth she had come to love so much. How Jack somehow became a reaper after exploding in the empty, probably sucking in some energy to stay alive. What a great job he was doing, because he was kind and compassionate like Castiel. How he still preferred to spend time with his family, as much as he could, and would be able to come and visit them both in Heaven, thanks to his powers.
“I’m fine” whispers Cas, barely audible. He comes closer to Dean, slowly backing him up against the door, giving him the time and opportunity to pull back, but he doesn’t. They just stare at each other closer than they’ve ever been. Dean is baffled and doesn’t understand what’s happening and but doesn’t have time to process what is happening when Cas frames his face with his hands, pushes their bodies together and kisses him, taking his breath away.
They spend the rest of the morning catching up, the Winchester telling their side of the story of how they defeated Chuck, and when Sam mentions that Dean is the one who decided to not kill him, because they were better than that, he doesn’t miss the look that his brother and the angel exchange, and the proud smile on Castiel’s face.
The kitchen is deadly silent after Dean’s departure. Sam tries to wrap his head around the load of information he just received, Jack seems to deeply regret being responsible for the conversation that just happened, and Castiel feels like he’s suffocating. He desperately wants to leave and get some air, but he knows he needs to talk to Dean, even if it means having to deal with the hunter’s anger.
- "Dean, what I said when I was dying… I meant it. You're my family, the three of you. " said the angel in a soft voice. "And I love you." He added, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
“Hey Cas… I don’t even know if you can hear me, but I just need to talk to you. There are some things I need to say, there’s just so much that needs to come out since that night. I hope… maybe you can hear me. I really hope you can.” He’s forced to stop talking for a second because he’s breathless, the sobs now wracking through his body. “Castiel” He starts again and he knows he sounds desperate, pleading, and he really hope Sam isn’t going wake up and come find him. “I need you back. I swear I’m trying to find a way, we’re looking every day, but I can’t seem to find anything. It’s only been a week and we’ve been busy, so I’m trying to keep my head up. Jack has had seven days to bring you back though, so I don’t understand why you’re not here. I know he said he was going to be hands off, but I thought he’d make an exception for you. Maybe he can’t. But I don’t want to think about it, because if he doesn’t have the power do it, there’s no way I do, and I can’t accept that. I don’t want to give up on you Cas.  Chuck’s gone, we’re finally free and we should be happy. You should be happy too. You should be here. I can’t focus on anything else when you’re away. Hang in there buddy, okay? I don’t know how long it’s gonna take me, but I’ll get you out. There’s still so much I need to tell you but I hope you heard all of that at least. And I hope I can see you soon.
“Yes.” Castiel replies immediately, without thinking. He then realizes that Dean probably wouldn’t want his brother to know they’ve slept in the same bed, so he quickly starts talking again. “I mean, I believe he is. I haven’t seen him around, have you?”
Cas doesn’t reply but his toothy grin speaks more than a thousand words. Dean decides that he needs to take every chance he can get to see it more often. He grabs some pajamas, throws some out to the angel who looks at him, tilting his head.
Dean stares at the big white door with his name on it and wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans for the third time since he arrived in front of it.
Dean grabs Castiel’s arm, and the angel is about to tell him to run to a safe place without him when he sees his determined look and the blood on the hunter’s side. Knowing that Dean won’t agree to be healed if Castiel doesn’t come with him, he throws the hunter arm above his shoulder, holds him by the waist and walks them to the dungeon.
Castiel is not exactly sure how it happens but somehow, Dean’s lips are now covering his. As time passes, it seems less and less accidental, because what started as just a soft brush of the lips now finds them exploring each other’s mouth and Cas can’t help but shiver again at the first swipe of Dean’s tongue against his parted lips. As they finally pull apart, out of breath, his heart skips a beat when he hears Dean whisper: “I love you too.”
“Hey, it gave us enough time to run away!” Dean protests. He tries to stand straight but clutches his side and suddenly looks so pale that he’s probably very close to passing out.
Now though, there’s just too much going on, between Chuck, Jack, Castiel not letting him know about his deal, Castiel confessing his love to him, Castiel dying. The angel is surprised because he knows he’s unloaded a lot on his friend all at once, but the usual angry reaction that he expected, which usually comes when Dean has to processed unwelcomed news, still hasn’t happened. The hunter just looks lost, and Castiel isn’t sure how to deal with this silent rift that he’s created between them.
“I know. I just wish I didn’t have to watch him get hurt all the time.” Dean replies, clenching his jaw.
“There was a lot going on, as usual, so you took the win. And I chose to keep it to myself because you and Sam didn’t deserve the extra burden.” Castiel replies so calmly that he drives the hunter a little crazy.
“Yeah” Dean whispers.  He raises his hand to lightly trace the bruise just above Castiel’s elbow with his fingers, making him shiver. He removes his hand right away, thinking he’s hurting him.
After the plan fails, Dean can't sleep and they both reflect on their day and how it's affecting their friendship.
“Your soul, and my grace… they bonded when I pulled you from Hell. You were very reluctant at first, so it wasn’t an easy process. I’m not sure how your soul is going to react if we come in direct contact again.”
He explains that they managed to separate his grace from his soul, and that he was technically human now, but human meant that this part of him could get to Heaven. He tells him how angry the Empty was, and Castiel unfortunately remembers how true that was, and how it made him pay for it. But ultimately, with help from Amara, it was now silent again, which had allowed them to get Castiel’s soul without the Empty trying to hold onto it.
- "Well, you should have thought about that before going there. You should have told me before going Cas." Said Dean, unable to hide the pain in his voice.
Dean does not reply but nods. After another minute of silence, he gets up but stops next to the angel to ask:
When he got to the parking lot of the motel where Cas was waiting for him, he felt a wave of relief overwhelming him. Almost immediately followed by a wave a fear. For some reason, and he wasn't even sure why, he was dreading this encounter with the angel.
-	“You are the most infuriating person I have ever met, you know that?” interrupted Cas, clearly annoyed. “We need to talk Dean, let’s meet. Please.” He added in a softer voice.
Once in the abandoned house, they had been ambushed by a much bigger and much stronger group than they had anticipated which had been difficult to deal with, even for two extremely experienced hunters and an angel of the lord, who ended up having to use so much of his grace that he was heavily panting by the time the last vampire dropped dead.
- "What? Don't tell me you're thinking about joining them too!" He couldn't believe it. Cas wouldn't do that. Even if he had betrayed him in the past, he couldn't do that now.
They’re hugging again, and everything feels right. However, Dean knows there’s still a question that linger, even if Cas hasn’t mentioned his confession since the beginning of his conversation. Slowly, he steps back from their embrace and cups the angel’s face with both hands.  Their faces are so close they’re almost touching, and Dean smiles when he sees how wide Castiel’s eyes have become. The hands that were holding his waist tightly are now gripping his shirt.
Cas laughs quietly and starts undressing, and he can tell that the hunter is having a hard time avoiding to look at his body. He puts the t-shirt on and, deciding against the pajamas pants and lies down next to Dean. They stare at each other for a few minutes, all smiles but as if they were afraid to touch the other again. Dean gives him a quick peck on the lips and turn around to turn the lights off. Once in the complete dark, it seems easier for their bodies to find each other, and Dean ends up with his head on Castiel's shoulder, one hand on his stomach and his legs slotted against the angel's who's embracing him. He lets out a happy sigh, and is already falling asleep by the time Cas whispers "Goodnight, Dean."
The sound of his mug shattering as it hits the floor is enough to end the embrace and have both figures turn to Dean, who feels like the world has stopped turning.
“If we’re going to be spending the night together cuddling, we might as well be wearing comfy clothes.” Dean says taking his jeans off, and Cas can't help but feels a blush creeping up his cheeks at how intimate this feels.
-	“It’s okay Dean… I’m worried about you. Just tell me where you are.” said the angel in a soft voice.
“But you don’t have to wait. I can send you there. You should at least go tell them that you’re back.”
“You were gone. ” Dean whispers.  “Everything happened so quickly. I felt like I was going crazy Cas, and that was the only proof I had of what actually happened. I just walked past that room, saw that it looked like nothing happened, and... I freaked out I guess." Dean confesses, ashamed.
Castiel tends to forget how much Dean can hate himself, how unworthy he always feels. He can feel hope again, that maybe the reason Dean hasn’t returned his feelings is because he still believes he doesn’t deserve to be loved.
“Jack, what do you mean? Of course you’re doing the right thing.” Castiel replied, even if he was not sure what Jack was referring to. He can’t think of a single thing he has done since he became God that wasn’t right. He was amazing, fair, and Castiel couldn’t be prouder or more honored to be by his side.
“Yeah, I guess I never realized that my bed was the comfiest in the bunker. I thought everybody had a memory foam mattress. We should get you one.”
It takes a long time for them to fall asleep after that, but they both feel peaceful again, enjoying the intimate contact.
It was subtle, but Dean looked slightly disappointed. Almost as if he wasn’t about to repeat his apology, but say something else.
Dean tells Cas about the roadtrip they went on after Amara brought back everybody who had disappeared because of Chuck, including Eileen who had permanently moved in with them to be with Sam. He tells him about going to the beach to sip on fruity cocktails, toes in the sand. About showing the Grand Canyon and the Niagara Falls to Jack for the first time. About all the burgers and pies they got to try on the road.
Hey y'all! Sorry for the delay in posting this, I meant to do so over a week ago but life got in the way and I wanted to take the time to make small changes first.
He got closer to the hunter a put a hand on his shoulder and forced him to turn around and look at him.
They keep kissing for what feels like forever, alternating between smaller pecks and deep, open-mouth kisses and Cas can’t help but whimper the first time Dean’s tongue glides against his. Their hands have moved too, and while the angel is gripping Dean’s hair and neck, the hunter has slipped his hands under the trench coat, circling his hips and keeping him close.
“What?” Surprised, he takes a step back to face the angel again. Their whole bodies aren’t touching anymore, but Dean can’t remove his hand from Castiel’s shoulder. He needs the touch to know he’s really here with him.
It’s short and sweet, and yet, when he pulls back, Dean’s heart his hammering and he feels like his legs would be shaking if Cas wasn’t holding him up so firmly against the door with his whole body. He opens his mouth to talk, but no sound comes out, so Cas starts talking.
“Which means I could spend more time around here, if my presence is welcomed.” Castiel adds, shyly. He tries to not get his hopes up, because they haven’t really talked about his confession, but Dean seems happy to see him. Maybe he could stick around. Being by his side as his friend was much better that being away from him.
“Don’t be. I first died when I was 26 and many times after that, never thought I’d make it to 42. I’ve had many chances, YOU saved me many times, it wasn’t fair of me to ask you again. I don’t think I was even asking, I think I was just pissed to die so quickly and so stupidly after you had sacrificed yourself for me. I thought you were still in the Empty and I didn’t know if you could hear me, but I wanted to try and say goodbye.  I wish I could have enjoyed the post-Chuck life a bit longer, sure, but I get Jack’s point. The world is finally right, so we had to stop with the deals, the changing destiny and the resurrections and mess things up again. And you both did a great job up here.” Dean says with a smile.
- “You can’t waste your grace on me Cas” The hunter tried to protest, feeling guilty when he thinks about how much grace the angel had probably used to fight the Leviathans.
Lost in his thoughts, he realizes that Dean’s face had become serious again, and almost shy. He takes a deep breath before speaking again.
“Do you remember what I said when we first met?” Castiel asks as he detaches himself from the hunter just to meet his eyes. “Good things do happen Dean. You deserve it.”
Dean gulps, knowing that even though Castiel is giving him an out, the confession is always on his mind too.
Castiel nods with a proud smile, and tells them about Jack rescuing him from the Empty, promising to make it quiet again in exchange, and sealing it forever to make sure nobody else could go in and wake the entity up. He tells them about rebuilding Heaven together, focusing on the task for what seemed like a short time, before he realized that several days had passed on earth. He doesn’t mention the prayer from the previous night because he suspects that Sam doesn’t know, and catches Dean’s grateful look.
“So what does this mean for you?” Dean asks. “You’re the new God’s adoptive father, that must make you the big boss around here.”
Castiel smiles, grateful. He’s so focused on his relationship with Dean sometimes that he tends to forget what an amazing friend Sam has been to him.
After a while, only forty-five minutes according to his watch although he feels like he’s been sitting there all night, he finally manages to drag himself to his bedroom and smiles when he sees Miracle waiting for him by the door. He gets under the covers and pats the empty space next to him, eager to have the dog cuddle against him, slightly filling the void in his chest. Emotionally drained, he quickly falls asleep, thinking of blue eyes and a smile full of tears.
After that night, they still don’t go anywhere near the subject of their feelings, or sleeping arrangements, but Castiel now heads straight to Dean’s room when it’s time to go to bed, and the hunter doesn’t seem to be complaining. They keep a bit more distance in the bed, but seem to have found a good rhythm, and move around each other in a way that feels completely natural. And it seems to keep the nightmares at bay, for both of them. Castiel wishes they would talk, but he’s too afraid to say anything that might ruin this newfound intimacy.
He takes his time to finish his tea and he's about to stand up to rinse his cup when Dean storms in, and makes a beeline for the fridge to grab a beer. He seems disturbed, and Castiel clears his throat to signal his presence. Dean jumps when he realizes he's not alone.
Everything feels suffocating after that realization, and Castiel decides that he needs some air. He lets everybody know that he needs to go for a walk. “I need to clear my head.” He adds as sees Sam’s look, and is pretty sure he’s about to offer to come with him. As he gets to the top of the stairs, at the bunker’s entrance, he realizes that Miracle has been following him, and as he looks at the dog’s sad face, he finally understands what Dean means when he talks about Sam’s “puppy eyes”.
“Hello Dean.” The angel replies softly, avoiding his eyes, and that’s all Dean needs to hear before he can move again, heading straight into Castiel’s personal space, slowly raising a trembling hand to touch his cheek. He slowly tilts the angel’s chin up and their eyes finally meet.
The next day, they take care of the ghost, and frankly, the salt and burn is so easy that any of them could have taken care of it alone, but they had decided to be careful. After everything they had been through, after defeating God himself, they were determined to not die stupidly on a simple hunt. Castiel, still adjusting to not having his grace, had been a little too slow and ended up with a nasty bruise on his arm and a few shallow cuts after being pushed around, but that was it.
- “I made it?” Asked Dean, surprised. After all, he hadn’t been the ones taken away by Leviathans and currently bleeding.
Dean knew that by "you", Cas meant him, but also Sam, and probably his mom. But when he was looking at him with his crazy blue eyes, standing so close to him and saying stuff like "I'd rather be with you", Dean's heart was skipping beats, and he couldn't help it.
“I suck at this, and it’s especially difficult after your incredible speech from that night, so I’m just gonna kiss you now, okay?”
-	“Cas, if you want to go back to the bunker, it’s fine.” Dean replied, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
“I just… I always knew you were an angel, hell your entrance the night we met in that barn is hard to forget, but then you became my best friend, you became more human and I guess I started seeing that in you, more than who you actually are.” Dean tries to explain.
“I fell asleep… and it’s like I was back there. I’m just…” Castiel tries to find the right words but he’s caught off guard when he feels his eyes tearing up.
I hope it's not too full of mistakes, if anyone wants to beta read this or my potential future works, let me know !
“Just a bit of cleaning, organizing. Sam went over the laundry process with me again.” Castiel replies, not sure where their conversation was going.
- “Dammit Cas, we should really get you a bell” he tries to joke. Seeing Castiel’s concerned face, he adds: “It’s just.. I am fine, it’s just been a long 36 hours or so.”
The next morning, Castiel wakes up alone for the first time and with a pounding headache. Dean’s side of the bed is already cold, and it’s still quite early, so it looks like he hasn’t slept that much. When he gets to the kitchen, there’s a pot of coffee, a big glass of water, and some ibuprofen waiting for him, but the older Winchester is nowhere to be seen. He went for a drive, according to Sam.
He had been touching Dean more and more often as the years went by and their friendship had grown stronger, and it was the second time that day that they ended up holding onto each other, but this felt different. Usually, the hunter was clasping his shoulders, his body hard and strong even though he was always slightly melting into the embrace. Right now though, he is just a dead weight in Castiel’s arms, holding onto him like a lifeline. He had wrapped his arms around him, a lot lower than usual, hands clutching his coat, and he had buried his face in his neck, breathing deeply. The angel moves the hand that was holding onto his friend’s shoulder to rub his arm in a soothing gesture.
- "You have nothing to apologize for, Dean." Replied Cas, giving him a shy smile. "Are you going to tell me what's wrong with you and why you left the bunker?" he asked, hoping the hunter wasn't going to avoid the topic forever.
- “Ok.” The hunter sighs, obviously relieved. He pats Cas’ shoulder, letting the touch linger before dragging his hand away. “Goodnight”, he adds before leaving the room.
Dean nods and they can’t help but start making plans for the first time the doors will open. They’re probably going to visit Bobby first, who’s most likely to congratulate them for getting their heads out of their asses. Dean suspects the old bastard knew about them long before their realized their own feelings.
I realize that I promised to post this chapter about two months ago, and then life got in the way. I wrote 80% of this story in one go, so it was hard to get back into it after so long, and I'm not totally satisfied with how I ended things, but I think it was about time I finished this story and moved onto something else. My brain is full of season 15 coda ideas (probably my way to cope with that incredibly underwhelming ending?) so you might see me around here soon!
“I’m sorry it took me so long to say it. I should have said it before the Empty took you. I should have said it the very second you came back. I just… I’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop, I guess. It just seemed impossible that I was finally allowed to have this.”
“It’s my fault if I was too slow, not yours. I just need a bit of training to get used to fighting as a human, but I’ll learn. It’s not your job to protect me, Dean.“ Castiel softly replies.
-“It wasn’t real though. Sam prevented all of this from happening.” Replies Castiel, still stroking his friend’s arm to soothe him.
Now he was driving, without really knowing where to. It had been a couple of hours since he had left the bunker and he still didn’t know what to do or where to go.
"I was just going to head to bed. Is everything..." Castiel tries to ask but he's quickly interrupted by the hunter.
He didn’t have the countdown on his phone like Dean had, but the angel knew that they had been here for a long time and the rift would be closing soon. Most likely in less than an hour. He used to have a better grasp on time, and thinking about yet another consequence of his failing grace made him wince.
“Hierarchy is much more fluid than it used to be.” He explains. “There aren’t many angels around, but our graces are much more powerful, and Jack barely ever leaves so it’s more than enough to keep Heaven powered. We closed the gates to keep the angels in and we just make sure things keep working here. It’s quiet.”
It was hard to remember a time when he had been happy. Especially since it seemed like what he remembered from his childhood wasn’t true.  Since his mom came back to life, he had realized the pretty, soft blonde who wore floral dresses and spent her days baking apple pies and singing lullabies probably never existed. Since she came back, he had realized he didn’t know her at all. After all, he was four years old when she had died. As the time passed, his scattered memories of her had mostly disappeared, replaced by memories he had wished were true.
“Look who’s talking.” Dean jokes.  He becomes serious again. “I was done Cas. We played our part, and sacrificed so much along the way. We saved the world. Everybody was at peace and ready to move on. I just chose to be happy for once.”
“I felt your guilt, your pain, but something else was stronger… I felt loved.” Castiel whispers, still in awe from this revelation.
Dean's breath falters and he blushes, avoiding the angel’s gaze, which Cas finds endearing and can’t help but slowly caress the hunter’s cheek. Still looking away, Dean smiles and all of a sudden, they’re kissing again. For Cas, it’s even better this time because Dean is the one who initiated the kiss.
“Dean… you can’t.” He replies and the hunter turns back to look at him. He realizes that they’re both on the verge of tears. “You’ve fought for this whole world. For years. Don’t give up now. Don’t give up because of me.  You deserve to see what happens when you finally win.”
“You definitely deserve some sleep.” Castiel nods before letting go of him, and looking like he’s heading for the door. However, Dean catches his hand and makes him turn around.
When he saw how reluctant Cas looked, Dean stopped pacing. He froze, worried about what he was going to hear.
Castiel feels his blood run cold and his heart misses a beat as he realizes who is standing in front of them.
“We can’t move him, it might make things worse." the hunter says with a shaky voice. “We could pray to Jack. That has worked before.” He suggests.
-	“I don’t know man, I’ve been driving for hours and I don’t even know where I’m going” Dean sighed, exasperated. “Seems like I am not far from Omaha.” He added after passing a sign.
Sure, he was glad she was back. He was so lucky to get a second chance to get to know her he hated himself for being disappointed. And he wasn’t disappointed in her, not really. The problem was their relationship that was so different from what he had hoped it would be.
The following morning, Sam and Dean are almost done eating breakfast in a peaceful silence when they hear the sound of the bunker door, and someone slowly walking down the stairs. Sam bolts out of the room first, excited like a puppy, because they’re expecting Eileen to arrive later that day, so he assumes she’s just early. Miracle is following, wagging his tail, curious to see what’s going on. Dean is more careful, and grabs the gun taped under the kitchen table. With Chuck gone, Heaven and Hell in order and Jack watching over the world, he can’t imagine what monster would dare coming directly to them, but a hunter can never be too careful. He brings his coffee mug with him, determined to finish drinking it and feel completely awake, but drops it when he finally enters the war room and catches a glimpse of black hair and a trench coat engulfed in Sam’s arms in a bone-crushing hug.
After sitting alone for a while, he decides to grab a few books from the library and go to his room to do some research. He reads the same page at least three times when he realizes that he is dozing off and his eyelids are feeling heavy. He had used a lot of grace in Purgatory, and he is feeling exhausted, but he doesn’t want to sleep. He needs to feel useful. He decides to go and check on his friends instead.
Cas nods, stunned, as it suddenly all comes back to him. Billie chasing them, almost killing Dean, and his sacrifice to save him. The relief of finally being able to tell him how he felt and everything he meant to him, and the peace and happiness this moment brought him. He remembers the pure shock on Dean’s face and his broken plea. He remembers the Empty, taking him. He remembers being stuck there, with a very angry entity and how he was tortured for a while, relieving his worst moments.
So, he went for a drive. On the road, with his baby and his music, he can pretend he has everything he needs. Even if that isn’t entirely true. After everything he’s been through, he has made it to Heaven. He is surrounded by people he loved and he is finally at peace. So he can’t complain, right?
“But I don’t have a heaven, and Heaven is supposed to be memories.” Castiel says, more confused than ever.
Castiel slid down against a tree, feeling slightly dizzy from his wounds that were healing way too slowly, and waited. Without even realizing what he started praying, even though the hunter could not hear him.
But now, after yet another miracle, he’s out and Dean just kissed him. His lips are slightly parted, his smile getting wider the longer they stare at each other, he looks happy. He has never looked more gorgeous. “That’s exactly what I meant.” Castiel finally says with a hoarse voice, his throat tight with emotion.
“Not exactly.” Dean replies, trying to sound reassuring. “I need to catch you up on a few things sunshine, let’s sit.” He says, taking Castiel hand in his and leading him towards one of the benches.
- "It's okay Dean, I'm here." He murmured, caressing his back with one of his hands in a soothing movement, like he had often seen other people do. He was still the awkward Angel of the Lord he had always been, but he was definitely getting better when it came to knowing how to react to some situations.
When he wakes up the next morning, he’s startled by the warmth he feels against his skin. He opens his eyes and realizes that at some point during the night, he has gotten much closer to Dean and has draped an arm around the hunter’s waist, holding him close. They’re still facing each other, so he can also feel Dean’s breath against his forehead.  Even though the touch feels incredibly good, it also breaks his heart a little because he knows that it’s probably unwelcomed, or not wanted in the way he wants it. He makes sure to swiftly remove himself, gets out of bed, and start his day.
“Look Cas, every time you died, every time I lost you, it broke me. And when you sacrificed yourself for me, I felt like I was dying with you. Sam called me about a dozen times before I managed to pick up the phone that night, because I was hurting so much that I couldn’t move.” He pauses, getting choked up as he relives that night. He clears his throat and continues: “But we had to defeat Chuck, we had to save the world, and I had to shove it all down so I could get up and fight. And then we won, and it felt fucking wrong because you were gone and Jack was kinda gone too but we finally had free will and we had each other. You saved me, over and over again, and I owed it to you, to Sam, Jack and everybody we lost along the way to try and enjoy this freedom. I got a dog and tried to pretend that I was gonna be okay, and I was even starting to believe it but then I got impaled.”
As the first tears fall, he feels the air shifting. It’s subtle, but familiar. As he’s about to turn around, he hears a voice he didn’t think he’d ever hear again.
“Of course, if there’s anything else you want to talk about, I’m here.” The angel adds, still holding him.
Sam had made an appearance about twenty minutes earlier, but the younger hunter had quickly escaped to his room, even though they all knew he wouldn’t get much sleep after everything he had seen and been through today.
“You’re gonna stand here all night and watch me sleep, for old time’s sake?” Dean tries to joke. However, his tone immediately changes to a much softer one as he finally catches the angel’s eyes. “Are you okay?” He asks, frowning. Castiel realizes he must still look pretty distraught.
“I get it, Cas. Me too.” He whispers. Trying to lighten the atmosphere, he asks:  “So I guess I can keep kissing you, right?”
“Let’s go. Together.” The hunter said, voice firm, holding out a slightly trembling hand that the angel immediately grabbed, lacing their fingers together with a shy smile. Dean squeezed his hand with a strong grip and the angel could see a hint of fear in his friend’s eyes. There was no doubt he was reminiscing of the last time they had tried to leave purgatory together but this time, Castiel had no intention of letting go. He squeezed back as they walked through the portal and made it back to the bunker just in time.
“It wasn’t clear but I could feel that something was wrong. I wanted to come save you, but Jack didn’t let me. He said we had to let things happen, and that timing wasn’t too bad since we had just finished our work on Heaven. I’m so sorry Dean.” Castiel lowers his head as he apologizes, but Dean has already caught the glint in his eyes and squeezes his shoulder in a comforting way.
“I…” Dean opens and closes his mouth several times, clearly not expecting his friend to be so forward. He looks away, biting his lip, clearly trying to gather his thoughts and Castiel feels a wave of affection rushing over him. He raises his hand and delicately traces the hunter’s face with his fingers. Dean closes his eyes under the soft touch but reopens them when he feels Castiel tensing up, his look becoming way too serious for someone who has been drinking that much.
Castiel had let out a sigh as Dean’s words and pain are still vibrating through his body. He had tentatively glanced towards Jack, and had seen on his face that he had heard the Winchester as well. Of course he had, Dean had said his name so he had been too curious not to listen, but even if he hadn’t, he was everywhere. Everything. So he knew.
Castiel feels his heart breaking, seeing his friend struggling and timidly raises his hand to cup the hunter’s cheek and dry some of his tears, feeling relieved when he immediately leans into his touch. They had never been so close before, so emotionally vulnerable, and despite the situation, the angel’s heart rate was picking up. Only a few weeks ago, it had seemed like they might never be friends or trust each other again, and having the hunter open up to that extent was more than he could have ever hoped for, even 24 hours ago.
Dean almost says that he should remove his coat and jacket to feel more comfortable, but it doesn’t feel brave enough to get the words out. Castiel probably wouldn’t feel the difference anyway, so he decides that he doesn’t care, as long as the angel stays with him.
Cas sends an apologetic and ashamed glance at Dean and he freezes. Things hadn’t been perfect lately, Chuck was still around, and Sam had gotten pretty hurt just the day before. But Jack was back, they were on the mend, and as much as he tried to not read into it too much because the future was still way too blurry at this point, his blossoming relationship with Cas was giving him a new kind of hope. Of course the other shoe was about to drop.
“Jack, it’s not your fault. You rescued me from the Empty when I thought I would never get out. You offered me to work with you, rebuild a better Heaven. You did everything right. Of course I miss them, especially Dean. But they’ll arrive eventually.” The angel said with a sad but peaceful smile.
Castiel quietly checks his phone on the nightstand and realizes that they’ve been asleep for about seven hours. He thinks about Dean’s prayer and is pretty sure that the hunter hasn’t slept that much since they defeated Chuck. And he was barely even sleeping before that, so it’s good to see him getting a good night of sleep. He smiles as he admires how peaceful his friend finally looks in his sleep, the eternal frown caused by stress slowly fading away.
“I won’t give up on you, I promise I’m gonna come find you. Gonna get you out of there. I love you so much.” He whispers against his skin, pressing as many soft kisses as possible into it.
“Thank you Jack. For everything. This is more than I could have ever wished for.” Castiel says his voice full of emotion, before hugging Jack.
Castiel nods, somewhat relieved. However, things are different now. They both finish changing in silence, facing away from each other and when they lie down on the bed, they both stare at the ceiling, a chasm and so much tension between them that they’re not sure how they’re going to fall asleep. However, the alcohol in their systems helps, and they end up passing out almost at the same time.
Months ago, this wouldn’t have necessarily been a problem. They used to spend a lot of time together, without talking. Castiel understood that words weren’t always necessary and because they knew each other pretty well, silence wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable.
The drive back to the bunker is quiet, although Dean keeps stealing glances at Cas in the backseat. The angel was staring right back at him in the beginning, daring him to say anything about him getting hurt, but Dean stayed silent.  Now that Castiel has fallen asleep, he can let the concern show on his face.
“It just feels surreal sometimes, you know?” Dean whispers against his ear. ‘’Last month, we were still trying to find a way to defeat Chuck, and to be honest, I didn’t think we’d all make it. The way he manipulated me, made me so angry, and desperate. I was so hopeless. And then, we beat him but you were gone. Just a few weeks ago, I was drinking myself to sleep and begging for you to come back. And now, you’re here, Sammy’s here. Jack is safe and looking after the whole world. It just feels too good to be true.”
Dean hung up, without answering. He felt like he didn’t have the strength anymore. He felt exhausted, empty.
“Look Cas, I don’t even know what happened the night you died. I know that you made a deal and were able to summon the Empty, that it took you away with Billie, and that you saved Dean, but that’s it. I know there’s more to it, but Dean wouldn’t talk about it. I could see how hard it was on him, but there was nothing I could do to help. I could see him lose hope every day, as you weren’t coming back, and I didn’t know if he’d ever get over it. So whatever is happening now, I just want to make sure you’re both happy, because you sure deserve it.”
“Are you happy right now?” Jack spats, only looking at Castiel, and he sounds so angry that Dean is taken aback.
“So when is it going to be then?” Cas asks and he can feel the tension radiating from Dean’s body, how he’s slipping away from him, the giddiness from moments ago now forgotten. He instantly regrets pushing the hunter, after repeatedly telling himself that he didn’t need more. That they had been through a lot, that the worst was behind them and he owed it to Dean to give him time to process everything. The hunter had let him in, closer than before, shared his bed with him every single night, slowly opening up and letting their relationship shift into a new direction, and Castiel was ruining it. “I’m sorry.” He says and Dean meets his eyes again, surprised to see the panic on his face. “Just pretend I didn’t say anything.” He adds before turning around to leave and go hide in his room.
The rest of the day is quiet. They each find something to keep busy, enjoying this newfound freedom. Dean and Castiel don’t talk that much, although the hunter seems less reluctant to be left alone in a room with him. He does disappear most of the afternoon though, claiming that they need a refill on groceries and that he’s taking Eileen with him, insisting she has better taste than Sam in food, and that she’ll help him pick plenty of different foods for Cas to try, now that he has taste buds again.
At the restaurant, the beer is great, the food is amazing and the evening definitely feels like a celebration. So when they finally drive back to Lebanon, sated, the ride is much quieter with everybody but Dean dozing off. It’s not that late when they finally get home, but the days has been so full of surprises and emotions that they all agree to go to bed once they arrive at the bunker. Unsurprisingly, Sam and Eileen quickly disappear toward his room, leaving Dean and Castiel in an uncomfortable silence.
“So… what do we do now? We already wasted years ‘cause I didn’t want to acknowledge how I feel about you and now… “
Dean heads towards the Impala as well to grab some fuel, because burning the abandoned house down seems like the fastest and most efficient way to cover their tracks, but Cas grabs him by the shoulder and cups his cheek in such a tender way to heal the bruise that was starting to appear on Dean’s jaw, as well as some back pain that was barely there yet, but that he definitely would have felt the next day.
- “Talk to me” begs Castiel in a voice so soft that Dean was only able to hear him because they were pressed against each other and couldn’t physically get any closer.
- “Night Cas.” He replies, face flushed. He closes his eyes, feeling relaxed for the first time in days and falls asleep within minutes. It looks like the angel won’t have to use his grace to keep the nightmares at bay after all.
“OKAY OKAY, fine.” Dean interrupts with a panicked look. “Whatever. Just get us home in one piece. Bitch.”
The angel knows that there is more to it for his friend to have a breakdown and barely even try to hide it, but knows that there was no point insisting right now, the hunter was way too stubborn.
“Oh yeah? Last I remember, Billie wanted to kill me. If I hadn’t dragged you with me…” Dean replies, clenching his jaw and avoiding the blue eyes staring at him.
“My human side, your friend, that’s also part of who I am, who I’ve become by being part of your family.” Castiel says, still not understanding where the conversation is going.
, Dean had thought, even though nobody dared to talk about the fact that Castiel was gone, because nobody but him really understood what happened that night. Sam, of course, had kept asking, until Dean had snapped:
“This is a memory. But I’m not.” Dean replies softly, waiting for Cas to figure things out. He slides his hands up to his face and slowly strokes his cheeks with his thumbs.
Dean and Castiel exchange an awkward smile, which makes Jack realizes how happy they look and he snaps.
“Don’t you recognize it? We’re in Heaven.” Dean says in a reassuring tone, gently squeezing his shoulder.
“The deal that I made with the Empty is that it wouldn’t come to take me until I experience a moment of pure happiness.” Sam nods as he’s listening, still not understanding what exactly happened. “So I told Dean how amazing I think he is, how he’s made me a better person, and then I told him I was in love with him.” Sam gasps. “And then, the Empty took me away, because I didn’t need Dean to respond to be happy, I just needed to be honest with him and let him know how I felt. How I feel.” Cas pauses. “We haven’t talked about it yet. “ Sam rolls in eyes. “I said everything I had to say that night, so we’ll have this talk on his terms, when he’s ready. I’m just happy to be back and I’ll take whatever he gives me. Even if we want different things. Being part of this family, being your friend, it means everything to me. I don’t need him to return my feelings, as long I can be here.” Castiel says with a smile, but Sam can see the underlying sadness that comes with pining for someone, and can’t believe how clueless both of them can be.
Once he’s done praying, he lets his head fall against the wall behind him, drained. The tears keep rolling down his face, but the sobs are quieter now, as if talking to the angel had helped lifting some of the suffocating pressure he has been feeling. He doesn’t have the strength to move yet, so he stares at the spot where Castiel was standing when he said he loved him. He keeps staring for what feels like hours and he can’t unsee the angel’s face, his eyes full of tears, and his beautiful smile as he uttered those words. Dean feels like he won’t ever be able to stop crying, but he knows it’s better to let as many tears as possible out now, so he can pretend that he’s fine when Sam looks at him tomorrow. He just wishes he had brought some whiskey with him, but he had been afraid to drink the whole bottle before even stepping into this room. Cas deserved better than a drunken prayer.
When they finally walk back to the bunker, after one last “Thank you” sent to Jack, he feels much better, lighter.
"His reaction seems quite strong. I'm not sure it's about fishing Dean." Castiel replies. Worry creeps up on him, as he starts to wonder if the reason behind Jack’s anger is linked to the happiness he feels. But Jack is young and still unexperienced when it comes to feelings, so he couldn’t be so clairvoyant, could he?
And he also felt stupid, because it wasn’t as if they were kicking him out of the bunker. Mary wasn’t even living with them. She never really did. She was their blood, but she never really acted like family, no matter how hard she tried. She had to love them because they were her sons, but she had a hard time getting to know them. Still, she wanted to protect them. Maternal instincts or not, she had chosen to work with the British Men of Letters. The people who had helped them, but also tortured Sam. People they weren’t sure they could trust. To Dean, it felt like she’d rather trust strangers than her own family. That’s what hurt the most. They had defeated so many monsters, so much evil.
It’s almost noon when he finally comes back and Sam has found a hunt a couple of states over, so they decide to head out and take care of it. They could have called other hunters, but in a way, and even with the silence between Dean and Castiel, it’s the most normal things have felt in months. It’s just the two of them, plus Sam because it’s just a house haunting, so Eileen decides to go visit one of her friends nearby.
Considering that Sam and Eileen had both been stuck with Chuck earlier that day while Dean and Cas almost got trapped in Purgatory, this day could have been much worse, Dean thought while chugging his third glass of whiskey.
The girls had been out when they had first stopped by on their way to Minnesota, so Claire runs into Castiel’s arms to give him a hug. The angel hugs back right away with a soft smile, always surprised and grateful that the young woman has accepted him in her life despite him being responsible for her losing her parents. She pulls back, but he keeps his arms on her shoulder, and takes the time to stare at her. “You look great, Claire.” He says in a soft tone. “Less angry” She actually chuckles at Castiel’s words. “Being happy suits you.”
“Is it working?” Castiel asks with a smile, but something in his eyes shows that he’s only half-joking.
Their trip to Purgatory was going as well as they could have imagined. The Leviathans were still desperate to kill Castiel, and he had gotten separated from Dean. The monsters had left the hunter behind when they had captured the angel, in a rush to get him to Eve, but there was no guarantee that there weren’t more monsters hiding, just waiting to attack the Winchester while he was on the ground. Castiel had managed to free himself from the Leviathans once they were far enough from Dean, seeing an opportunity in a clearing full of the blossoms they had been looking for, and just before they made it to Eve. The fight had been difficult as his power were failing and he had been outnumbered, but he had managed to kill two of the monsters and escaped from the rest, and after an hour or so, it looked like he had finally managed to lose them. He was hurt, and too weak to heal himself right away, but he had the blossom and he could make it back to the rift. He just had to find Dean first.
He didn’t even know for how long it had been driving when his phone started ringing again. The first hour, Sam had tried to call him at least a dozen times. Then, Mary had tried to call. But he didn’t want to speak to them. Didn’t want them to know how much it hurt that he couldn’t agree with them.
Just because they’re determined to live their new lives to the fullest, they head out to a bar that evening. Castiel is a little worried that he’s going to have to watch Dean flirt, or worse, find someone to spend the night with, but he doesn’t say anything and just follows. However, he’s pleasantly surprised when Dean doesn’t leave his side all night and decides to get a round of shots for the both of them, determined to put his friend’s tolerance to the test now that he doesn’t have his grace to keep him sober. Castiel knows it’s probably a recipe for disaster, but it’s not like he has the strength to refuse Dean anything. After a while and a few empty glasses, Dean decides to teach Castiel to play pool, but they’ve both downed too many drinks by then, and despite how talented he usually is, handling a drunken sort-of-angel when he already feels uncoordinated himself is too much. So he settles on dragging his best friend to the tiny dancefloor instead, putting one arm around his waist, and grabbing his hand with the other, to supposedly teach him out to dance. Castiel is more than happy to follow, welcoming the excuse to be close to the hunter. Dean avoids his gaze while they’re gently swaying to the music, but they’re both smiling. When the song ends, he makes the angel twirl, and can’t help but stare when it earns him a laugh, a sound that is too foreign coming from the angel.
“He’s okay with it. Hell, it wasn’t easy and we definitely had a major chick-flick moment. But he’s happy for us and he’s ready for a new life. Jack was a bit more reluctant but he ended up being the one reaping me. I don’t think a reaper is supposed to cry that much and I don’t think the person dying is supposed to hug their reaper to comfort them, but the kid did a good job, and he’ll get to visit soon. And when Sam get his ass over here, we’ll get to visit him.” Dean explains, grinning.
“You better. Don’t you dare leave me again.” Dean says, his gruff voice slightly trembling before cupping his face with both of his hands.
“It will just be temporarily though. You’d get to live and properly enjoy a human life with them, but as soon as you come back through the gates of Heaven, you will be reunited with your grace. I’ll keep it safe for you.”
“Long story short, the nest was big, Sam got pretty banged up, Cas managed to fix him, and now I’m starving.” Dean says with his usual cocky grin. Sam and Castiel knew that he was probably still beating himself up over the fact that his brother had gotten hurt and wanted to avoid the subject. Deflecting was just a second nature for him.
He wasn’t sure what to expect, but he’s still surprised. It only takes him a second to recognize the park and the two benches where he and Cas were sitting when the angel first confessed that he had doubts. That he was happy that Dean had ignored Heaven’s orders to save a whole town, even if it meant breaking a seal. Because he cared.
“Dean, that’s not how it works.”  Castiel’s heart breaks again because he can see the raw pain emanating from Dean. Both of them being in the Empty together, that would be too good to be true and the Shadow knows it. It knows that no matter how much it could try to torture them, they’d always hold on to each other. It knows the further Castiel is from Dean, the more miserable he is, so it’ll make sure that they stay apart.
“Of course.” Castiel replies and Dean finally seems to relax a little. After a few minutes of silence, his doubts are confirmed: Dean didn’t come to talk. The closeness between them is reassuring though, and Castiel closes his eyes to let the slumber takes over, hoping Dean will fall asleep quickly as well because he definitely deserves some rest.
“Then you’re an idiot because I love you too. And I’m also dumbass for not saying anything earlier.” Dean finally confesses, his thumbs still stroking Castiel’s face, now wiping the tears of joy that have started to fall from his closed eyes.
He starts with Sam, who is sleeping deeply but obviously having nightmares. He let his fingers hover over his friend’s forehead, using the little grace he has available to make some of the nightmares go away. When Sam’s face looks less tormented, the angel decides to move to the other Winchester’s room. Like his younger brother, he is probably asleep as the angel’s soft knocks on his door are left unanswered; however Castiel is surprised to find the bed unmade, but empty.
“No Dean, you have to let me go.” Cas replies with a sad smile as he tries to wipe some of the hunter’s tears. Dean knows he won’t be able to stop them, knows that he’s about to lose the angel again so he pulls him close, gripping his trench coat, and buries his face in the crook of his neck.
The angel leaned against a tree for support as he realized that he was shaking. Dean was alive and he was praying for the first time in months. He had sometimes felt the hunter’s longing as if he had been about to pray to him, but it had been a while since he had heard that voice so clearly, and with no hint of anger. He felt a wave a relief wash over him.
On that third night though, Dean doesn’t say anything as they get ready to go to sleep. So, Cas brushes his teeth and heads straight to his bedroom, only to find it empty. He’s disappointed, but Dean did mention the previous night that his bed was more comfortable, and it’s not like he invited him to come to his room. Maybe it was his way to gently let him know that he wouldn’t be sharing Castiel’s bed anymore. Maybe he had woken up at some point, with the angel holding him, and had remembered that there were still a lot of unspoken things between them, that the embrace was less than platonic, and had decided that he needed some space.
“I think we’re okay.  Even if you and me… this is making me really happy right now… but Chuck is still around. You, Sam and Jack… my family is still in danger as long as he’s around. So as happy as I am when I’m with you, I don’t think I can be completely happy, and at peace, until you’re safe from him. I realize that now. But that doesn’t diminish how good you… I…”
- “Dean you’ve already taken the Mark you can’t take it again. I can, it’s the only way.” Replies Castiel, trying to keep his voice as calm and reassuring as possible given what he is about to do.
“Let me heal you.” Castiel groans. He doesn’t let the hunter the time to react and pushes his hand out of the way, putting his on the wound instead. The grace is weak, but steady, and it’s just a matter of seconds before the bleeding stops. Dean squeezes his shoulder, silently thanking him while the angel takes a second to catch his breath after using his grace left him panting.
Cas doesn’t reply but nods and smile, and Dean automatically smiles back. Then, they both get out of the car and focus on their upcoming fight with God.
This is it. The retirement, the peace and quiet, the happiness he’s always wanted. The final death. Ironically, it feels like the beginning of the rest of his life.
Mary was back and Dean almost never agreed with her, always looking for more. Sam was taking her side and it hurt like hell. He finally understood how his brother must have felt when he left for Stanford. When John had told him to not bother coming back. When Dean had watched him go and said nothing.
“It’s okay Dean. It’s more than I would have ever hoped for. I didn’t think I’d come back from this, that I’d have to deal with the consequences of everything I said that night. I was ready to take whatever you were willing to give me, hoping that I, at least, still had your friendship. But then, things shifted, and I was just happy with what you were giving me.” Castiel replies, smiling reassuringly as Dean pulls him into a hug.
When Castiel reopens his eyes, he feels a strong pressure on his chest and realizes that he has trouble breathing. Everything around him is dark and silent, the only sounds being his heart pounding in his head. He tries to calm himself down, tries to move but he’s just paralyzed. He desperately tries to take a deep breath, tries to tell himself that the Empty has never been so good at manipulating his dreams, despite a creative imagination, that he must be out because everything had felt too real, but the panic is too strong and entirely controlling his body. He lets out a whimper, but all of a sudden, he feels warmth on his wrist and he’s able to move again.
“Then I want to try. We’re talking about Sammy’s life here. I guess if my eyes start burning or something, just pull out, okay?” Dean says with a cocky grin, trying to sound reassuring.
That night, they crash into a motel and have to sleep in separate beds. Castiel can’t seem to fall asleep and the only thing that makes him feel slightly better is hearing Dean toss and turn, seemingly having trouble sleeping alone as well.
“I’m so glad you’re back. It didn’t really feel like a win without you.” Dean whispers before letting out a shaky sigh. Castiel doesn’t move for a bit, because he realizes that the hunter is taking advantage of the dark to say what he couldn’t when they were talking in the kitchen, and he wonders if now if the moment they’re going to acknowledge the declaration Castiel made that night. Dean doesn’t say anything else though, but his fingers softly start tracing patterns on the angel’s skin, leaving goosebumps behind them.
Eventually, he’s able to breathe again, and his heart rate slowly calms down. He turns to his side to get closer to the warmth and can feel a very much real Dean, slightly snoring a few inches from him. He must have somehow felt Castiel’s anxiety in his sleep because the warmth that brought the angel back to reality is the hunter’s callous hand on his skin, his fingers circling his wrist.
Despite the case being in a small town, it took them a couple of days, a lot of time spent questioning the locals and one and a half night in one of the crappiest motel they had ever been to before they managed to locate the nest.
As they pull apart, Dean sees that the black goo has almost reached their feet. He knows they only have minutes, if not seconds, left.
“I wouldn’t be born if it weren’t for you. I wouldn’t have had a family, and I would have been taken by the Empty the first time I died if you hadn’t been there. I’ll always be grateful for you Castiel. Now let’s finish our work on this place so I can send you back to our family.” Jack says as they let go of each other.
He still wasn't okay, but he was better. Cas was there with him, for him, and right now, it was everything he needed. Everything was going to be just fine.
“Wait.” He says, as he reluctantly pulls away from Dean, feeling his worries take over. “How did I get out of the Empty? Did you make a deal? Is that why you’re dead?”
They end up finding him in the kitchen, seating with Sam who seems to have no idea why the Nephilim is fuming.
It’s past one am when they finally decide to go home and Dean and Cas are straight-up giggling in the backseat for no apparent reason. Sam and Eileen exchange amused looks in the front until they get interrupted by Dean who yells:
- “I’m sorry too.” Dean replies. “For putting you in these situations. It wasn’t fair to you. But I want you to know trust you with everything I have, and I don’t want you to feel like I’m your responsibility, even though that’s probably asking too much.” Castiel tries to hide a smile but fails. The hunter had been a mission at first but had become his priority throughout the years and someone he would protect at all costs.
- "Sam didn't tell you?" Dean was surprised. Sam wasn't used to keeping his mouth shut. When something was wrong, he never hesitated to talk about it. Was he so ashamed of working with the British that he couldn't tell Cas? Dean felt some relief at that thought. Maybe his brother realized he had made the wrong decision.
That was it, the thing that Dean had dreaded. Even if he had been expecting to hear something like that, he still felt like a punch in the gut. For a second, he felt like he couldn't breathe. Then he exploded.
He settles down and casts his line in the water, enjoying the peace and quiet. He remembers being in the same position, at a very similar spot, when Castiel first visited his dreams, years ago. He thinks about Jack’s excitement when they went fishing together for the first time. He closes his eyes and allows himself to miss them. He knows Jack is everywhere, so technically he’s also here with him, but he misses the kid and his goofiness. He wishes he could have been a kid a bit longer, had a proper childhood. He wishes he had treated him better. He thinks about how sorry he is and hopes Jack is listening.
They don’t disappoint, and they also bring him some clothes back, including some flannel, "because it's the Winchester trademark" Dean says, making the angel feel incredibly pleased. He had noticed earlier that his and Jack's name has been carved next to Dean, Sam, and Mary, but every reminder that they really considered him part of their family was heartwarming.
- “I know I’ve been an asshole to you, especially lately, but I could never do that.” Dean says after a while, his eyes closed again.
He looks up at his friend, taking him in for a second before he realizes that everything in his attitude screams how exhausted he is. There’s something else too, that looks somewhere between worry and fear, and he barely catches it since the only source of light is coming from the hallway, through the gap around the door frame.
- “Cas… we good?” His tone sounds so shy and insecure that a wave of tenderness rushes through the angel.
But when he got closer and saw the shy smile on his best friend's face, the only thing he could do was to throw himself in his arms. He felt that Cas was surprised at first, not used to such a display of affection. Sure, they were hugging more and more often. But most of the time, it was because one of them had been hurt or dying. Not because they were sad and seeking for comfort. But the angel relaxed quickly and put his arms around the hunter's shoulders.
“I know time is a strange concept here, especially for humans, but it’s been almost 40 years since we last saw each other, Dean. That’s longer than the time we spent together on Earth. You never prayed to me. I never even felt your longing until now.” Cas says before lowering his eyes, avoiding the hunter’s gaze.
He slides an arm around Castiel’s waist, who grips his shoulder, and heads towards one of the bathrooms.  Castiel tries to protest, wanting to head straight to bed, and Dean quickly interrupts his mumbling.
Dean catches Sam’s gaze, who’s sitting alone at their table, and feels himself blush. Sam smiles at his brother as he realizes he’s never seen him so happy and carefree. He’s so obviously whipped that Sam can’t understand how the angel still thinks his feelings are unrequited.
“Nothing’s happening.” Cas replies and Sam raises an eyebrow, clearly not believing him. As he starts talking again, he looks a lot more serious.
“I’m not sure. I just… I feel like I slept for a while after being hit in the head and just woke up. It might take a minute for me to gather my thoughts.” He replies, and Dean can’t help but smile at his comparison. After a few seconds, Cas seems to come to a realization. “Wait... Was I dead?”
“I would have either died later, or I would still be wondering what it’s like to be happy, looking over my shoulder all the time, worrying about the Empty finally coming for me. I got to choose how and when it would take me instead, and I got to save you in the process. Nothing you can say will make me regret that decision.” Castiel interrupts, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder to prevent him from turning away and avoid his gaze.
- "He said you had a fight, but didn't say about what. He said it wasn't important, but that he was worried about you." Replied Cas, looking at the hunter in a way that made him feel the angel was trying to read his mind.
Dean jumps when he heard his friend’s voice, quickly rubbing his eyes with the back of his left hand to hide his tears.
When Sam and Jack finally make it back home a few hours later, with the final ingredients needed for the spell against Chuck, Dean still hasn’t moved.
“You’ve done that before with Bobby right?” Dean says, now sounding frantic. “When you needed a little boost to time travel. He told us about it back then. That would work, right?”
“No” Sam says, his voice getting weaker. “That might draw’s Chuck attention. We can’t risk it.” He adds, staring at his brother. His voice might be weak, but his tone is firm.
“Oh, Dean.” Castiel says, putting a hand on the hunter's shoulder, the one he always touches, a gesture they both know so well now and that seems to be enough for Dean’s last walls to crumble. He crashes against the angel, arms around his shoulders, holding him tight.
His eyes have been closed for a few minutes, feeling the slumber quickly taking over, when he hears soft, almost shy, knock on his door.
He could hear the emotions and a vulnerability that Dean would only rarely show, and the tone of this voice was so heartbreaking so Castiel felt his throat closing and almost missed the actual apology. He couldn’t help but shudder when his friend finished his prayer. He tried his best to ignore the pain he could feel radiating from his Dean words.  What if he was hurt and had lost hope because Castiel couldn’t find him?
With his grace failing, everything had felt kind of muffled ever since Jack had died. Right now though, the hunter’s prayer was so intense that Castiel felt like each word was radiating throughout his whole body.
- “Cas?” He replied, staring with disbelief at his friend who had to hold himself against the tree to stand up.
“Thanks, Cas.” She replies before kissing his cheek. She steps back and grabs Kaia’s hand with a bright smile.
“How are you Dean?” he asks, tilting his head in that special Cas way that the hunter could online describe as adorable.
He wants to think about Cas too, because he’s barely let himself do so since that night, and he especially refuses to think about him when he’s around his family. He doesn’t want to let them see that part of him is still hollow and miserable, even in paradise. They probably know though, because they seem to avoid mentioning him. He knows Jack has saved the angel from the Empty, and knowing he’s around and safe is more than he could have asked for, but he still misses him. He’s still grieving his best friend, and he misses what he could have had, if he hadn’t been so oblivious and stupid. He hopes he’s still watching him, once in a while, even though he hasn’t stopped by to see him. Dean hasn’t prayed either, because Cas is probably better off without him. He feels a sob coming and tries to swallow it back down, but realizes it’s pointless and nobody can see him anyway. He already has a lump in his throat and tears welling in his eyes, so he might as well go all in and let himself mourn for a bit right?
“Dean, you don’t need to come and tuck me in. I’m fine.” Sam laughs, appreciating the concern. "Night guys" he adds before closing his bedroom door behind him.
He’s known their bond was special for years, and can’t believe that Castiel still thinks that Dean doesn’t have feelings for him, even after the long hugs, the lingering looks and touches, and literally spending the previous night in the same bed. He knows it’s not in place to interfere though, no matter how much he wants to, so he settles for comforting words instead.
Sam smiles, seeing how flustered Castiel is, and explains: “I found Miracle waiting outside of your bedroom door this morning. I went to check Dean’s bedroom and it was pretty obvious that he didn’t sleep in his bed last night. Quite easy to figure it out from there.” Seeing that the angel looks embarrassed, and isn’t saying anything, he adds: “Hey, I won’t mention it if it’s a touchy subject, even though it’s very tempting to tease my brother about it. But if you need to talk about what’s happening between you two, I’m here to listen.”
Castiel, who was a little stiff and seemed slightly reluctant at first, finally melts against him at his words.
They have many more people to visit, like Charlie, Ellen, Jo, Ash, and everybody they lost along the way. The good news is, they have all the time in the world.
He doesn’t feel completely ready, but he also knows that he can’t wait another second, so he takes a deep breath and pushes the door that says
- “I didn’t even think about it but I should have understood earlier…” Dean starts, quietly. He takes a deep breath and adds: “this must be the same spell used to lock the Darkness away… It says that for the entity to stay locked away, the key reside in a mark…”
“I love you too.” Castiel replies, and this time Dean’s heart is not breaking, it’s healing. He can’t help but lean in to peck the angel’s lips again. And again.
I know I said this was going to be a One shot that I then decided to split into two chapters, but turns out there are three chapters now? I'm almost done, I promise. Hope you like it :)
“Not so much, even though I’ve been around for a very long time, those few years spent trying to save the world were exhausting. I enjoy the quietness. My few years on Earth were the best of my long existence and have changed me forever, but I needed to find peace. We were finally able to build the paradise humans deserve, that you deserve. It should have been that way all along. Now that the restoration work is done, I have a lot more time on my hands. I might have some ‘angel business’ to attend every once in a while but Jack said I was mostly relieved of my duties and I should enjoy my freedom.” He explains with a smile while Dean feels his cheeks redden because Castiel used air quotes for the first time in a long time and looked so freaking adorable. Half an hour ago, he wouldn’t have dared to imagine seeing the angel again, and now he can barely focus on anything else that the fact that he’s so madly in love with him.
So he’s managed to avoid that room for five whole days, but now he feels like he can’t stay away. He’s been waiting for Sam to go to bed to leave his own room, and now that he’s been gone for almost an hour, hopefully asleep by now, Dean feels like it’s time.
“This is what you meant right? The thing that you can’t have?” Dean asks, suddenly nervous. After all these years, the weight behind his confession and the fact that his whole happiness seemed to depend on Dean, he’s pretty sure of what he meant, but now that he reciprocated, he can’t help but worry, especially since the angel doesn’t seem to remember the circumstances of his death.
Cas can’t help but think about the hunter’s prayer from the night before and wonder what else Dean needed to tell him so badly. He’s been standing close, catching his eyes occasionally all day, but he’s also been avoiding his stare, and now that he thinks about it, Dean’s always made sure to leave whatever room they were all in first so they wouldn’t be left alone, just the two of them. The revelation feels like a punch in the gut, although he had accepted a long time ago that the hunter didn’t love him back. He feels sad, but tries to focus on the fact that Dean’s reaction to his confession could have been a lot worse. He was willing to give him all the time in the world to process, because they didn’t have Chuck breathing down their necks anymore, or another apocalypse to prevent, so they didn’t have to rush things. He had felt the desperation in his prayer, heard that Dean still needed him, still wanted him in his life, even after all the feelings Castiel had unloaded on him that night. So, as far as the angel was concerned, that was enough. The fact that he hadn’t ruined their friendship by declaring his unconditional love to the hunter was more than he could have hoped for.
His throat feels tighter as he tells Cas how hard it was for him to even get back on his feet after the Empty took him. How he barely had enough strength for their ultimate fight. How sad Jack had been for a while, and how helping people to find peace in their death had helped his mourn his father figure. How Sam had tried so hard to keep it together, despite his own sadness, because he could see how broken Dean was. How the support from Eileen, Donna, Jody and the girls had helped. But ultimately, how Michael and Amara’s promise to look for a way to get the angel out of the Empty, and the slight hope that came with it, was what kept him going.
As Eileen comes back from the restroom giggling, Sam realizes she’s pretty tipsy as well and smiles at how adorable she is. That makes him the only one of them who is still sober as he’s only nursing his second beer and has refused to do any shots so that he can be their designated driver for the night.
Once Jack had brought everybody who had been snapped away by Chuck back, they had stopped by Eileen’s first, and she had almost been suffocated to death by Sam’s big arms. She had promised to come visit them soon, explaining that she just wanted to give them some time to breathe after the big fight.
Dean wakes up the next morning with a smile on his face. Not used to spending the night entwined with another body, he woke up a few times to find Cas happily snoring against him which made him fall right back into a peaceful sleep every single time. This morning though, he's a bit disappointed to find that the angel has already left. He sighs, thinking about the missed opportunity of lying in bed together, exchanging lazy kisses. His sulking is cut short a few minutes later though, when the angel enters the room with two steaming cups in his hands.
“Thank you for telling me.” He says, sincerely. “Thank you for loving my brother, and taking care of him the way you do. I know he doesn’t see it, but he deserves it. And you deserve it too.” Castiel huffs at that, so Sam repeats it, louder. "You do deserve it, you both do. Look, I don’t exactly know what’s going on in his head because he’d never talk to me about that, but I know him, and I know he’ll come around eventually. I wish I could shake him and make things go faster, but I don’t think that’s the best approach when it comes to Dean. Hopefully, he won’t make you wait another decade, but I’m sure that conversation will be worth the wait.” He says before leaving the room, leaving Castiel deep in his thoughts, hoping that Sam is right.
He smiles, searching for the green eyes he loves so much and waits as he can feel in Dean’s demeanor that there is more he wants to say.
Later, as they gather for dinner, he smiles as he watches Dean slipping some food under the table for Miracle, making sure Sam doesn’t catch him. He blushes when he realizes that Cas has been staring, but winks at him and smiles. The angel feels his throat tighten as he realizes how easy happiness is now, that every moment spent together, every smile makes him feel lighter.
“Ours.” Dean replies before leaning in and finally kissing him. It’s shy, just a soft touch of their lips, barely moving, but Dean has never felt lighter. After a few seconds, he pulls away and presses their foreheads together, his eyes never leaving the angel’s.
- “I wasn’t planning on saying goodbye last year because I knew I wouldn’t have the strength to leave if you asked me to stay. Sam figured it out, otherwise I wouldn’t have said goodbye either. I wasn’t strong enough to say no to either of you. I was afraid that you would offer to come with me, like you did for Amara, and I wouldn’t be able to resist.” He says in a low voice. “But please don’t think that means I don’t care about you, understood?” He adds, trying to lighten the mood.
“I thought not interfering with them was for the best, but for a second, I forgot the pain losing you had caused them. And I didn’t realize that you were unhappy.”
“Dean.” The angel says with determination. “I understand that you will never see yourself the way I see you. But if there’s even a small part of you that wants me around, I’d like to stay with you.” He adds in a soft voice, putting a reassuring hand on the one that Dean still has on his shoulder.
“No!” Dean shouts, startling them both. “No, it’s not that. Sorry, I…” He says his voice much lower this time. “I’ve been meaning to clean it up, I just haven’t been able to… it was too hard.” He adds with a strangled voice. When he raises his head again to look at Castiel, he can see a strange shimmer in his eyes, and the look reminds him so much of that night that he can feel his throat close up and his eyes tearing up too.
The hunter takes a couple of deep breaths but doesn’t let go. Much to the angel’s surprise though, he starts talking, mumbling against Castiel’s neck who can feel his lips moving against his skin and can’t help but shiver.
Dean furiously blushes, for what feels like the tenth time tonight, thinking he’s going too fast as they haven’t even actually talked about their feelings. But then, he sees that Cas is still smiling, obviously teasing him so he childishly decides to throw a pillow at him.
Cas doesn’t reply but immediately heads towards Sam, who’s still miraculously conscious, but paler than before. The angel’s hands start glowing as soon as they are on his friend’s shoulders. A minute later, Sam is back on his feet, his shirt stained by blood but his wounds fully healed and Dean strides towards them, to give a quick i'm-so-glad-you're-alive hug to his brother, and pats the angel's shoulder. Sam also gives Cas a hug, and heads out to the car, still feeling a little wobbly, after Dean and Cas tell him that they'll take care of all the dead headless bodies.
- "Good" was the only thing he managed to reply. He let his hand slip a little, from the angel wrist to his hand and laced their fingers. When the angel softly squeezed his hand, the hunter smiled, his first real smile since he had left the bunker.
As the air has cleared between them, Dean lets himself feel relaxed for the first time in days and lets a yawn escape. Castiel grabs his arm, tender and firm at the same time, and walks them to the hunter’s room before he can protest.
Castiel quickly changes into his pajamas, which are still Dean’s clothes because that’s the one thing Eileen and him didn’t buy today, and the angel didn’t say anything because he loves wearing the hunter’s worn t-shirt and soft pants. He lies down on the bed too and turns the bedside light off, ready to spend another night surrounded by Dean’s warm presence. However, as soon as they’re in the dark, the hunter starts tossing and turning in the bed, restless.
Castiel almost mentions that even when they do get to beat Chuck, there will be no happily ever after for him as he knows the Empty is just patiently waiting to collect him. However, he doesn’t say anything, not wanting to add to the hunter’s burden when he was already feeling so helpless. A few days ago, he would have been worried that the hunter would yell at him for making a stupid deal, or worse, not care at all. Tonight though, and after everything that had happened in the past few hours, he knows how much Dean would suffer from this and he isn’t ready to make things even more painful for his friend..
It doesn’t take long until they find a field and the dog seems happy enough to run around and chase squirrels. It gives Castiel the opportunity to sit against a tree, look at the sky, and pray to Jack. He lets him know how proud and grateful he is, how being back is an adjustment but how good it feels to be reunited with his family. He doesn’t mention what’s going on with Dean, but he’s pretty sure that Jack knows, or can feel his longing at the very least. Once he’d done praying, he closes his eyes, lets his head fall against the tree behind him, and takes the time to enjoy the warm feeling of the sun on his face, the smell of the trees and flowers around him, the sound of the birds chirping, and the softness of Miracle’s fur as he comes to snuggle against him.
- “Dean.” He called out as his friend was walking past him. The hunter immediately pointed his gun at him, for a split second, before he recognized the angel.
When he wakes up the next morning, he feels a lot better. He turns to look at Dean, although his hand is not touching him anymore, their bodies are still close enough that he can feel the heat radiating from the hunter’s body.
.” Castiel had been walking for what felt like hours when he heard it, and stopped so abruptly that he almost fell.
“I can get on board with that.” Castiel replies with the most beautiful smile Dean has ever seen. He doesn’t stare at it for too long though, eager to cover it with his lips.
And then Sam sided with her. Worse, he sided with them as well, after everything he and Dean had been through. Even if he thought they were wrong, truth is, Dean didn’t know if they had a point or not. Working with the British Men of Letters seemed like the worst idea ever, for so many reasons. He tried to understand but he couldn’t see how things could end in a good way with them. No matter how hard he had tried, despite what Sam and Mary thought.  But after all the times they had kept secrets and worked being each other’s backs and had to deal with the terrible outcomes, Dean couldn't help but wonder. Who knew how it was going to end this time?
When Sam had confessed that he had agreed to work with them as well, Dean hadn’t been as surprised as he probably should have. And he had tried to remain calm, he really had. But the only thing he had been able to do was muttering an “awesome” without looking at his brother, taking his keys and slamming the bunker door.
They sit around the dining room table while Jody goes to the kitchen to grab the food and dishes, helped by Dean who, of course, wants to be the first one to take a peek at the delicious meal.
“Dean, what’s going on?” Hearing how lost Castiel sounds, Dean lets go of him, reluctantly breaking their embrace. He can’t stop touching him though, so he puts his hands on his shoulders and looks him in the eyes for the first time since he said goodbye.
“What are you doing Castiel?” he says before walking away, although not before slamming the bedroom door behind him.
As quietly as he can, Castiel moves closer to Dean’s body, almost touching, and spends a long time listening to his even breaths before falling asleep again.
“JACK! I said no!” interrupts Cas in a voice so deep and powerful that it feels like the bunker’s walls are trembling.
- "You could have died on that stupid mission Cas!" Dean interrupted his friend, the anger and fear back in his voice. "We almost lost you and who came to the rescue when shit got bad? Crowley! Even the freaking King of Hell is more trustworthy than those assholes!" Dean stepped back from Cas' personal space and started pacing around his friend, trying to calm his nerves.
Dean and Castiel are back from Purgatory but realize that the spell will require yet another sacrifice.
and that they would be reunited when he died. He tells Cas about the look he and Sam exchanged, both realizing that Dean was ready to die, right then.
- “You know we won’t find an easy way to get rid of Chuck and live happily ever after. That kind of stuff never happens to us.” Dean thinks out loud. He sits up and leans forward on the bed, unable to hold to angel’s gaze on him.
“Couldn’t sleep.” Dean immediately replies. He finally meets his eyes, and Castiel understands, even though the hunter doesn’t actually say the words
“It said it would only take him once he finally allows himself to be happy.” He pauses as they all look defeated. “Cas, I want you to be happy but..” Jack adds with tears in his eyes.
He caves as he finally meets Castiel’s gaze and warm smile and steps towards him to pull him in an embrace. As he reaches around his shoulders to bring him even closer, he knows the tears are falling again. They hadn’t really gotten to say goodbye, at least Dean hadn’t, and feeling his warmth again only reminds him of how painful losing him was, and how long it’s been since they last saw each other.
- “I’d love to.” Castiel replies with a bright smile, taking his shoes off to sits on the bed next to the hunter, back against the headboard.
“If you think I’m going to let you take him…” the hunter starts, the anger and fear both obvious in his voice.
“Miracle, this is Cas. He’s family. Cas, this is Miracle, he lives with us now.” Dean says, crouching down to pat the dog’s head reassuringly.
He’s lying still, on his back, but can’t help but turn his head towards Dean’s side of the bed. Castiel can’t really see him in the dark, but guesses the shapes of his body and realizes that Dean is lying on his side, facing him. He sheepishly asks:
“I’d like that very much.” Cas replies with a smile as he leans in. Their lips touch again, and the world fades away for a moment while they focus on the present, and most importantly, on each other.
“He started praying to me soon after he got here. He was wondering if I was around since he’d been told I was working with Jack and wanted to hear from us. To catch up.  Jack said he didn’t want to interfere in the part of Heaven filled with humans, even though he misses you both. But he’s watching over you, we both are. I felt like it might be better not to meddle as well, but my willpower is less strong that Jack’s and I did go to see Sam eventually. It was great seeing him after all this time, and he said that just because you weren’t calling didn’t mean you didn’t want to see me.”
- “I just did it for Sam before finding you here and I feel fine. Let me do the same for you, please.” Castiel begs. “I’ll just need to rest to recharge. Maybe sleep an hour or two.” He adds matter of factly.
He turns around and wanders around the bunker’s hallways as he realizes that his friend probably hadn’t been able to fall asleep. He decides to check the kitchen first and isn’t surprised to find Dean there; although the hunter’s position seems unusual. Instead of sitting at the kitchen table, he is on the floor, his back against the kitchen island and the unfinished bottle of whiskey from earlier in his hands. His eyes are closed, so he isn’t aware of the angel’s presence yet and Castiel thinks about leaving him alone for a second, to give him some space, but then, he spots the tears silently streaming down the hunter’s face and isn’t able to stop the words coming out of his mouth.
Sam had arrived a little while ago. How long exactly, he wasn’t sure. It could have been a few days, or even a few weeks. It had probably been longer than that knowing how time worked in Heaven. After all, he had been dead for about 30 years by the time Sam had finally joined him, and to him he had only seemed like a week or two.
“What do you want, Billie? Sam and Jack are not back yet.” Dean says, lowering his gun but still suspicious.
- "No, it was a waste of time. They don't know what they're doing." Castiel couldn't hide how annoying it had been, wasting his time going back to heaven, thinking they might have a lead on Kelly Kline and a solution for the Nephilim, instead of being where he really wanted, at the bunker with the Winchesters. "I won't be going back to heaven." He added. "I'd rather be with you."
When his father was alive, it seemed like things had been easier. John had raised him, and even if he was hard on him most of the time, there was no doubt that he had loved him. The man had been driven by his desire of revenge. Heartbroken since the love of his life had died so horribly. Numb after seeing and killing so many monsters. But he had loved his sons, had done everything to protect them even if raising them like little soldiers had been his way of showing them.
- “I went to check on Sam before going to bed. He still feels guilty about not trapping Chuck, you know? He felt like he needed to justify what happened and told me some of the stuff that Chuck showed him. Let’s just say I started having nightmares as soon as I closed my eyes.” He tries to laugh but only manages to make a strangled sound.
It's already way past midnight by the time they make it back to the bunker and Jack heads straight for his room after saying goodnight. Like each time his brother gets hurt, Dean becomes even more overprotective and actually walks Sam to his room, closely followed by Cas.
“I missed you too.” He replies. Dean can feel him take a deep breath, something so human for an angel, before adding: “I wasn’t sure you wanted to see me.”
“Jack, don’t.” Castiel says, trying to prevent yet another drama from disturbing the Winchesters’ life.
“You should have said something about your deal, man. I should have realized that something was wrong, that Jack coming back had been too easy but…” Dean replies, his throat tight with emotion.
They hear the Empty scream and all of a sudden, black goo start coming from under the door, slowly making its way to them.
“Dean?” he asks, looking confused. He doesn’t get to ask more questions though, because Dean has now reached him and is squeezing him in a bone-crushing hug.
“I’m sorry Cas, but they need to know. Do you just want them, want Dean, to wake up one day and find out that you’re gone?” The anger is gone from Jack’s tone, replaced by sadness.
- "Dean…" he whispered in a soft voice. "Dean." He said again, this time in a stronger tone, waiting for the hunter to raise his head and stop avoiding his gaze. Castiel felt like his world was crumbling when he saw that the tears were back in Dean's eyes and they both knew it was the angel's fault. He was clenching his teeth, glaring at Cas, but they both could tell he was having a hard time trying to pretend he wasn't about to fall apart. "Please let me explain." He muttered. Dean nodded, still trying to avoid his gaze even if the angel had gotten so close that their bodies where touching. "I didn't want to hide this from you because I don't want you to think I'm going behind your back."
He’s met with silence but can’t bring himself to leave as he hears the quiet sobs coming from his friend. After a few minutes, Dean’s broken voice emerges from under the covers.
Sam and Jack are away, retrieving some ingredients that Billie said would be required for their fight against God, and that they didn’t have at the bunker. They had been able to find everything relatively easily though, and were on their way back to the bunker. They all know that even though the spell to kill Chuck looks promising, there’s always a risk, and one of them might not make it.
When he realized the hunter was getting angrier and angrier and he was nowhere near calming down, Castiel decided he had to tell him why he had disappeared for the past few days now, before things got worse. He knew Dean was going to be angry and disappointed in him but he had to be honest.
“Let me go with you.” Dean begs in a hoarse voice and Castiel can tell that he’s panicking. He raises his head to look at the beautiful green eyes that he loves so much but the hunter has turned around, looking at the door.
His wounds still bleeding, Castiel decides to go to the bathroom, to clean himself up, taking a few minutes to heal with his weakened grace, while Dean is gathering the rest of the ingredients for the spell from the bunker’s storage room.
Unfortunately, they’re interrupted by enthusiastic knocks on the door and they barely have time to put some distance between them before Jack barges into the room.
From that point, things happen quickly. The Empty marches towards them; obviously aiming for Castiel with a replica of Death’s scythe and the angel gets pushed out of the way by Dean; who throws some oily oil and his lighter towards Billie’s doppelgänger. The creature catches fire and screams, and while it will definitely slows it down; they both know it won’t be enough to kill it.
“Okay Dean.” Cas whispers in the shell of his ear. “I love you too”, he adds before falling to the ground. It only takes a second before his body is covered in black goo and another for his body, and the Empty, to disappear. Everything is silent again, like nothing ever happened, except for Dean’s sobs. He lets himself fall against the nearest wall and screams.
Dean clears his throat, not sure he’ll be able to participate in a conversation so quickly after one hell of a make out session.
“Yes, I do if it kills him.” There it is, Cas thinks. They hadn’t talk about his deal in quite a long time, but Dean was making him really happy and he needed to give the kid credit for figuring him out so quickly.
Dean chuckles at his words but it’s so full of tears that only a broken sound comes out. He pulls the angel against him, gripping the back of his trench coat and drops his head on his shoulder to breathe him in. He can feel his whole body shaking, but for the first time in weeks, he feels alive. Castiel’s arms are carefully circling his shoulder as the hug lasts longer than usual, and he can feel that the angel seems a little distant, not holding him as tightly as he has in the past, but hugging him nonetheless.
“You say that like you wouldn’t do anything to protect me. Like you wouldn’t die for me. Again. It’s okay when you’re the one doing it, but I can’t?” Dean says, his voice getting louder.
Dean slowly walks up to Castiel, almost hesitantly, and sits on the side opposite of the bed. He’s turning his back to the angel who can only guess his posture in the dark, but he can feel how tensed the hunter is, even though he’s avoiding his gaze. After a minute or so, he lets a long sigh out, slightly turning his body towards Castiel, but keeping his head low. He doesn’t say anything.
A week had passed since Jack had gotten his soul back, and things had been pretty quiet and uneventful at the bunker. It had been a little uncomfortable at first, as Jack was just overwhelmed with grief and the guilt he hadn’t been able to feel after accidentally killing Mary, but they were slowly working their way through it, together, as a family. Sam and Dean were able to forgive him even if it wasn’t easy, but in the end, they were happy to have the real Jack back, and the permanent frown on Castiel’s face was slowly starting to fade away.
Dean has been hovering around room 7B ever since they stepped back into the bunker, five days ago. It’s been seven days since they beat Chuck, and ten since Castiel was taken away.
“I know. I just… Look, You’re pretty drunk and I’m far from sober. I don’t think now is the best time.”
When he finally comes out, almost fully healed, the hunter is sitting in the war room, elbows on the table, face hiding in his hands, looking defeated.
Cas rolls his eyes. They both know it wouldn’t be that easy. He realizes that they don’t have much time though, as Sam has been losing quite a lot of blood, so he nods. Dean mutters a quiet “hang in there Sammy” to his brother, then goes to sit on a nearby chair and seems to be bracing himself for the pain, so Cas gets closer, softly lays his hand on the hunter stomach, takes a deep breath and pushes in.
Miracle circling around them to sniff the angel is what ends up making them let go of each other and they realize that Sam is staring at them, barely repressing a smile, while he’s picking up the broken mug pieces.
As they had left the motel at dawn, it’s early enough for them to go back there to have quick showers and grab a light breakfast, before calling Jody to let her know they were heading west to Sioux Falls and would arrive just in time for lunch.
He’s instantaneously surrounded by Dean’s soul. Surprisingly though, as if his soul had recognized the familiar grace, instead of the expected push back from the soul feeling attacked by the intruder, it’s like flood gates have been open and he’s overwhelmed with feelings. He just feels everything at once, but above all, he can feel Dean’s soul wrapping around his grace, in a way that is so incredibly similar to being hugged by the hunter. He's also surrounded by his guilt, sadness and hope but above all, the love he feels is so overwhelming that he can feel his vessel’s knees buckling. It takes him a second to remember that he’s supposed to absorb some soul energy to power his grace, and he already knows he’d stay like this and cradle this beautiful soul forever if he could.
Cas nods, absent-mindedly and lets out a non-committal grunt. He wants to suggest that Dean should spend the night on his comfortable bed, but he’s afraid that he might take it as a rejection from Cas, or worse, take his word for it and move back to his room.
“Come here” Dean interrupts him with no hesitancy and pats the empty side of the bed. Without needing to be asked twice, Castiel lies down, facing away from Dean, feeling the shame take over. His throat feels tight all of a sudden, and he doesn’t want the hunter to see how much he’s struggling. He lets a couple of tears fall down as Dean turns the light off, relieved that he won’t be seen. However, he’s suddenly surrounded by warmth as the hunter has come closer and is now plastered against him, sliding his arms around his waist to hold him close against his own body. Eventually, he feels the hunter’s face leaning in the crook of his neck, so every single part of their bodies are now touching, grounding him.
“What the hell!” Dean shouts, throwing his now empty coffee mug against the wall, shattering it in a million pieces. He storms out and Cas tries to follow him. “You leave me alone.”
“So we’re back to being a couple of dumbasses then?” Cas says after a while as he opens his eyes and releases a shaky breath.
At the time, Sam had been the rebellious one. Always looking for more. While Dean had been following his father blindly, it seemed like Sam had always been looking for conflict.
“Then what are you doing here? Where are we?”Cas asks, taking in his surroundings, realizing that it looks nothing like the Empty, where he’s supposed to end up.
Castiel walked towards the hunter and let himself fall into his embrace when he realized Dean’s arms where reaching out to hug him. He instantly hugged back. They both let out deep sighs, happy to be reunited and finding comfort in each other’s touch after weeks of fighting.
“I’m not.” Castiel replied, even though he sounds hesitant and Jack can probably see right through him. “I haven’t been this happy in Heaven in such long time. This place has never been so perfect.”
“Yes. Sam and I were talking as we were reorganizing the library and he mentioned at some point that nobody had touched the room since the night I disappeared. I thought it could use a little scrubbing.“ Castiel proudly replies. Seeing the frown on Dean’s face, he’s worried he might have overstepped in a way. “Is that a problem? That sigil wasn’t effective anymore but if you think we might need it, I can replicate it.”
Castiel smiles against his mouth, realizing how happy he feels. The happiness he felt when he sacrificed himself for Dean came with a feeling of peace at doing the right thing, but now, the feeling seem surreal, almost too good to be true.
- “I’ll take it.” Castiel says firmly, clearly seeing the terror on his friend’s face. Saying that Dean is surprised hearing his words would be an understatement. “You already had the mark of Cain, it might interfere with the spell and we can’t take that risk.” Castiel says in a calm tone. “Plus there’s a chance my grace might help bearing it”, he adds, trying to sound reassuring although they both know it is very unlikely. The angel’s grace had faded a lot, and even if he had been at full strength, the mark was very powerful and they both knew it.
He helps Eileen wash the dishes after dinner, and then they hang out in the kitchen, drinking tea and exchanging stories. Eileen ends up faking a yawn after a while and Castiel smiles knowingly when she tells him that she should go find Sam and head to bed. He's glad they've found each other.
, their lips are touching. It’s soft at first, because Cas seems too stunned to move and Dean can’t believe he’s actually doing this, so their lips are just pressed against each other, but it’s the best feeling in the world. Dean smiles against the angel’s lips, and it’s like a switch has been flipped. Castiel catches his smile, pressing their lips together with more intent, bringing their bodies even closer. He still hasn’t fully registered how they got from Dean’s self-loathing to kissing, but he’s waited for too long to not reciprocate. Their kisses get bolder, their tongues finally meet and they both feel like they won't ever want to let go. So, when their lips part, they’re both smiling. They can’t seem to stop touching each other, can’t seem to look away.
“Surprisingly fine. That didn’t hurt at all.” Replies Dean, not mentioning the fact that he couldn’t remember the last time he had felt at peace like that. Because feeling so good while the angel was in him or whatever was weird, right? “Are you juiced up enough to heal Sammy?” he asks.
Castiel groans but cooperates, holding himself to the counter with one hand, not understanding why the world won’t stop spinning, and Dean starts brushing his own teeth next to him, a hand on his back to steady him. If he wasn’t so drunk, he’d probably blush at how much a simple action can make them look like a couple. And how much he enjoys the intimacy.
Because there were more people than usual around the table, they all had to squeeze in which means that Dean’s knee was pressed against Cas’, making him feel particularly giddy as the angel seemed to be leaning against him as well, slightly more than necessary.
He still misses Jack, and he misses his grace, but being outside, just enjoying the feeling of being alive has reminded him of how lucky he feels just to be there. He smiles as Dean calls him out as soon as he sees him, saying that he’s been waiting for him to come back to start getting dinner ready. He joins him, Sam, and Eileen in the kitchen and they share another meal full of laughter, as Dean tries to sign something to Eileen and ends up confusing two signs, saying something completely inappropriate instead. After dinner, the four of them pile up in the Dean Cave to watch episodes of Scooby-doo and tell Eileen about the time that they ended up in it and Castiel smiles fondly at the memory, the melancholy he felt earlier long forgotten.
“I spent the whole day thinking about this but I wanted to wait until we were alone. I almost kissed you before we burned the house down but that didn't seem like the best scenery for a romantic encounter." Dean is barely registering what the angel is talking about, obsessed with the memory of soft lips against his, but Castiel’s way of describing intimate situations makes him chuckle as always. "When I touched your soul, I didn’t mean to intrude… but I just felt… everything.” The angel adds.
All of a sudden, the house becomes eerily quiet, contrasting with the screams and fight sounds from a minute before. Castiel looks around him to see Dean slowly crawling towards his brother, who is on the floor, regaining consciousness, half-groaning, half-whimpering. As Cas approaches them, he realizes that Sam is heavily bleeding. He tries to use his grace, but it’s barely glowing since he’s used so much of it to get rid of the vampires. Dean sends him a worried look.
Now, they’re in the library, Castiel going through a few books while Dean browses the internet for anything on the Empty. He’s been showing websites with old texts to Cas a few times so they’re sitting side by side, so close that their shoulders are brushing every once in a while.
- "Of course, I would have done anything to find you." Cas replied in a deep tone that made the hunter shiver. "But we have to admit that they're powerful and have a lot of resources Dean. Becoming their ally might be appealing when you're desperate." He added, even though he knew the hunter was not going to like his words.
Even if it was pretty obvious after the previous day's soul-grace connection, actually saying the words out loud was different. And while they had fully acknowledge the shift in their relationship, they had spent more time kissing than talking about it the night before, not that they were complaining.
Dean opens his mouth to protest, but realizes that they didn’t really have any other options, or the time to look for one. He reluctantly nods. Just before the angel slices his hand to add his blood to the spell, and even though he already knew the answer, he can’t help but ask one last time:
“What the hell Cas? Let the kid talk” Dean interrupts. He’s worried now, because it sounds like he’s about to find out about yet another secret and he’s not going to like it.
He knows his heart is not technically beating anymore, but he definitely remembers the feeling of it missing a beat. He breathes deeply, then takes his fishing rod out of the water, wipes his face with the back of his hand and gets up, turning around to face the angel. He tries to look calm and collected, even though he feels like his whole body is shaking.
-	“Yes.” Cas admitted. “He told me what happened. He told me you left and he thought you would have called me. But I haven’t heard from you for days.” Dean couldn’t ignore the disappointment in the angel’s voice.
“Cas, please”… Dean begs, and he’s doesn’t even know what is asking for. All he knows is that, without realizing, he took a few steps towards the angel and their bodies are almost touching now, but the hunter needs more. He cups the angel’s face with both hands and kisses him. After a surprised whimper, and maybe a second of hesitation, Castiel grips his shoulder with his right hand, where his handprint used to be years ago, and his waist with his other hand, pulling him closer. Their lips move together in sync, as if they had done this many times before, and Cas realizes that it is the most beautiful and most heart-wrenching moment of his very long existence, because kissing Dean feels better than flying, but feeling the hunter crying  against him is like a blade through his heart. What started as shy and sweet is now getting more passionate, more desperate as Dean grips his hair while their tongues are dancing around each other and Castiel can’t believe the love pouring from the hunter while they kiss for the first, and most likely last time.
