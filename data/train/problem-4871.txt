It had been several years since Tony had last been in a close encounter with a member of the feline species but he distinctly remembers not being able to see out through red, puffy, streaming eyes after just a few minutes of being in their company.
"Yep, fine, perfectly fine." He replied reaching down to retrieve his mobile from where it had slid under his seat. He pulled his collar away from his slightly flushed neck. "Actually Happy can you turn on the AC? It's a bit hot back here."
Luckily Tony managed to come out of his thoughts before he created a situation for himself where he was forced to explain to Steve that he had popped a boner at the mere mention of a bloody rug.
The most subtle way he could think of to show his interest was to flip his hand over so that they would be loosely holding hands across the table. He was sure that would be a clear sign of consent to carry on whatever was going on here.
Pepper answered on the first ring and spoke before Tony even had a chance to open his mouth. "Tony... there's been a slight problem."
"Personally I'm up for the idea. Free accommodation though yeah?" Clint was smiling at Tony which the other man returned.
Steve paused for a moment, then smirked. "I really don't think I'd mind having you around more often you know if you did decide to keep coming," he expressed, reaching out slightly with his right hand to gently caress the fingertips of Tony's left one with his own.
And wasn’t that an image Tony didn’t need right now, himself face-down on the light brown shaggy rug. Carpet burn beginning to affect his knees as the blond ruthlessly mounted him from behi-
"And look here Pep, this is the training room, I spent ages designing this!" Tony lead her into a large room filled with the typical types of gym equipment. The only thing that told her this wasn't a normal gym layout however was the six doors at the other end of the room, each one clearly coloured to suit each of the Avengers.
"Now there's eight bedrooms on this floor with another five around the corner, I wanted to make sure everyone had a choice, although I have decorated certain rooms to fit their style so I think they'll probably go to those anyway." Pepper smiled as she watched Tony literally bounce down the corridor, it was nice to see him so excited about something that wouldn't risk his life.
"OK Tony, i'm going to save your breath and stop you before you go off on one. Call me when it's ready and i'll be over. However don't blame me if I cost you millions in repair work." Bruce turned back to his near hand-made computer, finishing off whatever he had been working on before Iron Man had come crashing through the door.
"And here I was thinking I'd finally perfected my poker face," Steve replied with a wink, leaning across the table slightly into Tony's space.
Tony looked up from their hands and straight into those piercing blue eyes once again, only this time he made sure to maintain contact.
"Thanks Tony." Steve tapped Tony on the shoulder before giving him a huge grin that tugged something in the shorter man's stomach.
"I'm going to ignore you now. Have you had any news on when the beds will be delivered? Mine came yesterday but the rest haven't and saying as the others are supposed to be moving in today I think they should probably have a bed to go to don't you?" The two of them made their way to the kitchen where Tony poured them both a cup of coffee.
"Be sure to chase it after signing those papers though. Debbie really will have an aneurysm if you leave it any longer."
Steve didn't give him a chance to try and redeem himself though unfortunately and instead grabbed onto Tony's forearm to pull him back to the café.
do we?" Tony was in front of Fury now, forcing the other man to look directly at him. "Listen, I'm doing this for the good of the team, I actually thought of all people, except for maybe Steve, you'd be the one most up for this."
"I said" the man replied, smiling as if Tony’s spaced out look was charming instead of creepy, "we're open."
The other man must have noticed his staring, as he promptly took his arm away, letting it drop to his side whilst the other hand ran through his hair.
Happy smirked slightly as he noticed just what, or who he should say, his Boss had been staring at before he schooled his expression into one of bored indifference. Nodding  once he replied, "Of course Sir."
"Wait a minute Tony." He flinched as her voice took a darker tone. "You mean to tell me that you have had time to build water slides that could rival most waterparks but you haven't had time to sort out the heating systems?"
"Uh, yeah. I mean yes, she was. Wanted me to try bringing in new customers with more exotic flavours that may be harder to find anywhere else in the city."
"Am I to take that laugh as a no then?" She asked, nails stopping their rhythmic tapping on the glass phone screen at the sight of the unopened envelope on the desk in front of her. "Ah, I see. I'll take that as a no instead then."
"Bruce, trust me. You and the Hulk will be fine. I promise you. Plus there's enough space that you don't even have to interact with anyone else if you don't actually want to. Hell, I know somedays i'll be avoiding all human interactions and-" A deep laugh stopped his trail of thought.
"Cap, listen, go shower and change. I'll wait out front for you and then we'll go discuss everything you want to talk about over food. Maybe Italian. But first you have to shower, now go."
Steve had clearly sensed the other man's tension as he was now looking at him with an (admittedly adorable) confused expression.
He quickly reached out to pull back the chair and winced as it squeaked aggressively against the floor at his excessive force.
"I really couldn't tell you know," Tony said jokingly, shifting again in his seat so that he could comfortably drink his coffee. "I think you'd actually have looked more at home diffusing a bomb back there."
"I told you already Stark. Hawkeye and Widow have their own lives out of SHIELD. When we need them we call them in and then they may as well stay at HQ for briefings." Fury said without even turning to recognise Tony had entered the room.
A Greek Adonis who was currently bending down to write the daily drink specials on a chalkboard in perfect cursive.
"And a good evening to you too Tony." Steve replied, punching the bag a couple more times before stopping to take off the tapes around his hands. "I was just finishing up here, did you want me for something that involves me going outside? Because honestly at the moment I just want to shower and then go to bed." Steve yawned, furthering his point.
"No Pepper, no way, despite what you may think I don't actually want to sleep my teammates and there is no way i'm sharing my bed with them!"
Steve watched him in anticipation and smiled as Tony's eyes widened in surprise at the first sip. "Good?" He asked.
"Well this is... cosy?" Tony tried to turn to glare at Clint but found himself sandwiched between a super soldier and a god.
forthings. "Right, just walk in with Jane, tell the person that asks for your name that you're there under Tony Stark and you'll be fine."
Tony sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Oh for the love of-, can you arrange some cars for the guys then? They'll just have to come back in a couple of days when they've arrived I guess." Tony watched as the snow started to rapidly build up outside, there must have been at least 3 inches already.
It took a moment for Tony to realise just where he was but when it did eventually hit him he started to panic.
"Oh, Colonel Phillips! You're awake finally, I was starting to get worried about you Ol’ man." Steve had stood abruptly at the sound and Tony cursed his luck at being potentially cockblocked by a damn cat.
“Captain, there’s nothing you can do. We have it under control,” Fury calmly replies. This is only one of many countless times a person of authority has tried to convince him he can’t help. Unfortunately, it’s not in his nature to stand down. And besides, Tony’s still out there. It doesn’t matter if Steve’s can’t help; it’d still feel wrong to fall back while his men are still fighting.
hurt. It doesn’t matter that everything will heal, that nothing is permanent. What matters is that Tony made a mistake, and someone else suffered for it.
Tony hands him a piece of multigrain bread and a banana, and Steve takes them in grateful and mildly-surprised silence. He’s supposed to be the professional here, but the inventor is the one reaching out the olive branch. “You stay up all night? I thought we were going to take turns.”
“Hey,” Steve smiles, leaning back with a wince and wrapping a hand around his ribs. He holds up the paper bag, and Tony takes it from him. “Dinner. JARVIS said you liked burgers.”
Cautiously, he sets Steve down, cradling his head and slipping his vest underneath. Tony takes off his own and adds it, knowing that it’ll be better than hard rock. Then he turns to inspect the cave, lifting his shirt with a shaking hand. The shadows are dimly cast in blue as he exposes the only light he has on his person – his arc reactor – around the cavern. To his relief, it’s uninhabited. Water drips near the back, but otherwise it’s dry and sheltered. There’s a draft near one side, but the space as a whole will be warmer than outside when the rain comes.
against strict orders not to, but then he remembers that he’s been terse since the beginning. “Just... focus on the mission, okay?” he lifts his hands pleadingly. Now’s not the time to be discussing his personal issues.
Again, Tony doesn’t let him finish, or even try to cobble together a sentence. “I pay attention. You might have that super steroid brain of yours, but I’ve got this all-natural Stark genius. I might be shit at friendships and all that, but I see stuff. Plus, you’re not as mysterious as you think you are.”
He tells Steve about how he invented an element. He explains the design of the reactor, how it all works to make its own power. And Steve stares at the hologram like it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. “Is it warm?” he asks.
Tony scratches his face aimlessly, wrapping his blanket around himself and shifting his posture. He frowns and looks up in the low light. They make eye contact, and it holds. Instantly, the inventor seems more relaxed, entering his zone of expertise. “That I can get in,” he explains confidently. “Whatever security measures they have, they’ll be no match for JARVIS. I’ll be in and out no problem.” He reaches into his vest pocket and pulls out a small device that looks a bit like a computer chip to Steve.
Captain America’s shield is resting on the floor against the bar, perfectly shiny and smooth, just like its owner. Steve’s pale skin and golden hair glow in the daylight streaming through the windows, blue eyes fixing on Tony intently.
Tony swallows and doesn’t answer for a minute or two. His expression makes Steve wonder if maybe the inventor has forgotten how well the soldier can see in this low light. He can see just how much dread has crossed his companion’s face.
Of course the first-aid isn’t stocked for spinal injuries. Tony searches through it, but the best he can do is splint Steve’s swollen wrist. It’s definitely fractured now that he looks at it. He feels a little better after it’s wrapped, like he’s finally done something useful. The arm he props up on Steve’s chest. Then he pulls a blanket across the man and steps back.
Obviously, there were parts of it he hated. Like the early morning wakeups from Pepper, or the bombardment of emails he received whilst sat in the back of his limo. He hated the stiffness of his suit and the smell of car fumes that still seemed to permeate the limo even with its fortified doors.
Shifting in his seat, Tony covered his mouth with one hand to hide his laughter. Due to living the life that he did, (early morning meetings and all-nighters in the lab), Tony had been a resident of many coffee shops over the years, and he could firmly say, with conviction, that he had never seen any barista look as out of place as Steve did making his coffee.
"Fantastic! Come on then, follow me." Steve beamed, smiling wide to reveal two rows of perfect white teeth. "I've saved the best table just for you." Steve winked, and Tony faltered as his heart stuttered for a beat in his chest.
Pepper had to admit, the mansion looked amazing. Tony really had put all his effort into this, spending most of his nights going over even the tiniest of details to make sure everything was perfect. It was just a shame she couldn't get him to show this much enthusiasm for his own business...
His throat, which had begun to tingle when he had been drinking his coffee, felt like it was on fire now. And dry, it was incredibly dry.
When Tony Stark has an idea, 99 percent of the time that idea will become reality. (Not counting the time he was six and he started collecting reptiles for their DNA in the hope of creating a dragon.) So when Tony Stark has an idea, all of his time, free or not, will go into it. Despite whatever obstacles he has to face.
Tony looked over the God of Thunder's shoulder to look at the mass of flyers in each of his huge hands.
. This means that the rest of the team hardly see them except for on missions and even then we don't exactly have time for
"Not at all, I look forward to seeing you again Tony." Steve reached down to pick up the Colonel and Tony really regretted having to leave the two of them. He wanted to stay in their calming bubble for all eternity.
"Perfect, Pep you can leave now if you want, start your weekend early." Tony motioned for the other five to follow him. "Come on then guys, lets give you the grand tour."
“Yup. Ready soldier?” Tony gets in close and holds his arms ready to catch. Iron Man seamlessly peels away from Steve, and he collapses into the engineer’s waiting grasp. His whole body hurts, but that’s alright. It’s a little embarrassing, but he doesn’t mind it too much as inventor carries him bridal style once again into the helicopter. Fury doesn’t say a word, firing up the rotors.
Steve angles his shoulders, and Iron Man does the rest, carving him a perfect pathway to his friend as the Jericho gains.
“Sounds like SHIELD’s business to me,” Tony saunters around the bar. Steve’s voice makes him want to put his head through a window, though Loki’s already thrown him through these, so he doesn’t fancy breaking them again. He’s a reformed alcoholic, but he can’t possibly deal with these two unless he’s got a few units in him. That, or they pull the sticks out their asses, and he knows that won’t happen.
terrible,” Tony chuckles. “But you could use some practice.” He leans his elbows on the sofa cushions and rests against it.
“I didn’t do it for that,” Tony retorts. “I didn’t do it to pay you back. I...” His mouth is very dry. In the corner, JARVIS turns on his record player and drops the needle. Quiet music fills the shop, and the lights dim.
“Captain Rogers-” the EMT grabs his arm to pull him back, but he’s so much stronger than her that it doesn’t make a difference. Two normal humans are no match for the top half of Captain America.
“No, you work for yourself, and this one is on your conscience. So I suggest you do yourself a favor and get your ass up here. Or I’ll come to you.”
“Or what, you’ll arrest me? Kinky,” Tony throws down his screwdriver and stands up, arching his back. He’s not in the mood, and was getting in the groove of things. But he packs up anyway, and goes to the clear space in the middle of the room. The trackers are already imbedded in his skin, so all he has to do is raise his arms and gesture with his hands.
Surprisingly, Tony doesn’t take much to rouse. He groans and rubs his eyes, and the journey of realization is clear in his eyes as he remembers he’s not at home in a warm, plush bed surrounded by expensive sheets. Nope, he’s in a forest, in a tent. The inventor scowls and props himself up on one arm, his hair a mess. He licks his lips. “What time is it, Soldier?”
Steve’s hand gently lands on top of his head. His coordination is shot because of his injuries and all the drugs in his system, but he manages to give Tony’s head a pat. “It’s okay.”
“Late enough that we need to get going.” Steve knows he could have roused Tony a lot earlier, but he also knows the older man needs more rest than he does. But they really do
Steve stands up the second he can touch the bottom, Tony still tucked under his arm. He sets him down once they’re out of the water and walks up the sand to the rocks. He can hear the engineer on his tail, carefully picking his way across the terrain but keeping pace. Steve has to remind himself not to go too fast: Tony is a fit guy, but he’s still not a spy, or a super-soldier.
“Uh huh,” Steve agrees whole-heartedly. He looks like he’s trying to nod, but he can’t. It takes him a moment to remember why. He accepts the drink when it’s given to him and sucks.
The tools for the project Fury called him away from are still laid out on the work bench. Tony sits down and looks over at the extra-strength garbage bag full of the suit he originally brought with him to the island. He looks back at the array of supplies in front of him, then back at the cases of extra suits all around him. JARVIS has cleaned and repaired them as well as he can in the inventor’s absence. He spots the blue and silvers ones next to each other.
No doubt about it. Tony just smiles. He’s not walking into a mission without it. Unlike Steve, he’s not bullet-proof. He doesn’t have any magic healing potion.
“I’m so sorry,” the words spill out of his mouth as he puts his arm through Steve’s Kevlar vest. “I’m so sorry, god, I’m sorry... I fucked everything up... I fucked
“SHIELD has intel that someone is building weapons on a remote island, and selling them on the black market,” Steve jumps to the point, which Tony appreciates. “We’ve been tracking down buyers and working our way back to the dealers.”
That won’t be an issue. No human, no matter how hard they train, can ever match the strength, speed, and durability of Captain America. Even injured as he is, he’s got Iron Man to make up for it. Steve fires up the repulsors and holds up his hands. It might be harder than usual, but he can take this guy.
Tony’s honesty and articulation shock and impress him, and he’s speechless as he regards the older man. They stare at each other for a few minutes, Tony simmering but recovering now that he’s said what he needs to, and Steve in sheer shock as he tries to decide how to respond. He’s in the wrong, and he’s man enough to admit that.
There’s more to learn about Tony, too. Steve’s smart, a lot smarter than the engineer first perceived him to be. He’ll soon figure out that though Tony doesn’t sell weapons anymore, that won’t stop him from being the Merchant of Death. On top of that, he’s a wreck. Steve can’t possibly want to be friends with someone so broken.
The HUD scans his face and starts running it through the data JARVIS has collected. “This is one of the strongest soldiers currently stationed here,” the AI relays, sliding one of Steve’s legs back in accordance with his upper-body position. “As far as I can tell by his training regiment and performance, at least.”
“I have people for that,” Tony waves a hand. “Just give me your address. We can stop by on the way out, if you want.”
“I told you, Cyclops, you can’t afford me,” Tony flashes a charming smile at the phone, even though he knows the director can’t see him. “I don’t work for you.”
This is not going as smoothly as he’d like. Tony drops his wrench and wipes grease from his fingers, reaching instead for the screwdriver and cradling the suit component in his palm as he slides the instrument through the cracks to adjust the motion sensors and trackers newly imbedded in the hardware. Next, he’ll tweak the coding, and give this baby another whirl.
Steve won’t be able to rest until this is over. To his relief, JARVIS doesn’t argue as they fly up over the complex for a better vantage point. Indeed, the fight is vastly swung in their favor. Tony’s extra suits are protecting the SHIELD jets, and the SHIELD agents are defeating HYDRA soldiers one by one.. JARVIS is looking after the group in the complex, seeking out enemies with equipped scanners.
“Aye aye, Captain,” Tony peels off and flies to his side of the building, while Steve does the same.
A drop of rain splatters on his cheek. It’s cold and harsh, and it brings him back. They can’t stay out here. Steve
Both men are asleep. JARVIS works as quietly as he can, taking control of the silver suit in the case. He walks the metal body over to the sofa while DUM-E grabs a corner of the blanket across Steve in his claw. The robot draws it back, and Iron Man gets to one knee. He scoops Mr. Stark’s slumbering body off the floor and deposits him across Steve’s broad chest.
Tony steps out of his own suit the second Steve’s safely on the stretcher. It flies off with the other, off to help in any way they can. The inventor grabs hold of a handle as the doors slide shut and they take off, a sly grin on his face. “Well? No more spandex for you then?”
“By my estimate, Captain, there are still at least fifty employees inside the warehouse,” the AI relays. “By the data you and Mr. Stark collected I assume many are stock and factory workers. It would appear there are about a hundred and twenty guards on the premises, all with varying levels of training in armed and hand-to-hand combat. Their skills level compared to the SHIELD agents does appear to be similar, if not slightly superior.”
“Not your fault.” the inventor raises a hand and cuts him off. “Well, some of the fault’s yours, yeah. But some of it’s not. The world moved on without you. It changed and became something new. And from what I know, which isn’t everything, but it is a lot, you never got the chance to change too. You’re not the man you were, but the world wants you to be. So you’re trying, but you can’t, because that Steve can’t survive in this world, but it’s all you feel you’re allowed to be.”
He can’t wipe the scowl off his expression, though the realization of truth is bleeding through. But Steve simply pushes out his jaw. “I know,” he agrees lowly. “That’s the best way. It’s what the serum’s for.”
"I've got a meeting at 9:30 on Monday and it's a big one. I'll be relying on your excellent coffee skills to get me through the day if you don't mind."
The blond was undeterred by his exclamation however and continued to scratch behind the Colonel's ears. "Yeah, he is. The Colonel here's a Maine Coon. Don't be fooled though, he may be a giant but he's just a big softy at heart, craves attention like no other cat I've had and I've had some needy cats."
Steve stiffened as a certain genius rolled over onto his stomach, poking him in the ribs before finally settling on top of him. "Tony what are you doing?"
"Yep, sorry to run out on you so suddenly but I didn't know how long you'd be on the phone and I've got to get back to the office for a development meeting."
"I think that you should take a chance." She began, cupping his cheek in one hand when he looked up at her with puppy-dog eyes. "Ok so option one happens and it's crap and annoying but at least you can then move on. If by some cruel twist of fate option two occurs then maybe 'Hottie McHotWaiter', as you once called him and no I won’t let it go, gives you mouth-to-mouth and you run off into the sunset together. I really don't see a reason why you shouldn't just go in and at least try and order a coffee from him."
Managing to maintain eye contact with the man proved too tricky for Tony's heart. He felt threatened by those piercing blue eyes as if Steve would be able to read his mind if he stared into them for too long.
"As you wish. Goodnight friends, may all your dreams be blessed." And with that, Thor went out like a lamp, quickly followed by Banner, then Natasha and finally Clint, leaving only Steve and Tony awake.
went against the diet plan Pepper and him were trying out. But this was a big decision, right? Big decisions like this require comfort food and grease, that's always been Tony's belief.
"NO!" Tony laughed at the clear panic in Bruce's voice. "I mean, i'm fine Thor, thanks, i'm perfectly comfortable here on my own now."
Apologies for any 'Britishisms' throughout the story, I've tried to pick out any I've spotted but it's hard when Word decides to consistently change them back
Maybe he could draw up a mental list of pros and cons to help him decide whether to chance actually meeting the literal man of his dreams?
Maybe he would too? Perhaps he’d like it so much he would push Tony against one of those windows, show him off to the world, show them just exactly who he belongs to.
Thanks for reading and please let me know if there are any glaringly obvious mistakes that i've missed
The sharp ache in his chest startled him. “Poor thing,” he whispered. Tony didn't know whether it had been inflicted by a fellow cat or a human but either way it would have surely been a traumatic experience for the cat. Yet here he was, getting comfy on a stranger without a care in the world.
I'm planning on posting a new chap weekly but that's all dependent on how hard work and my social life decide to beat down on me so just a forewarning that some may be a tad late...
Steve twisted around in his seat to point in the direction of the mass of steel and Tony had to stifle a groan at how the move made the muscles in his neck bulge. The man had muscles on top of muscles.
Five flashes went off with a chorus of 'cheese' ringing out and the team watched as their faces took over the place where the grey square had been on the card.
And now there's a blond man coming out from behind the counter making his way over to the door and...
The ridiculously hot weather of late was sort of a blessing in disguise now. It wasn't ideal when he had to spend his days in a three-piece suit but at least this way he would have an excuse for his slightly flushed face if Steve called him out on it. The fact that Tony, ex-playboy extraordinaire Tony, could be reduced to a blushing, stumbling fool was frankly embarrassing, and he was determined to put an end to it. He was a Stark. Stark's dominated conversations and left other's speechless. That was just the way it was and had been since Tony had attended his first function, age 14, and had left potential investors racing to empty their pockets with his plans for the first light-weight laptop.
Tony smirked to himself as he watched Fury go back to whatever the hell it was he did. He'd never asked and he wasn't sure he wanted to.
"WOW, woah wait, TONY!" Steve had to jog to catch Tony before he had a chance to leave the gym. "Want to explain that to me again?"
The other man's head shot up from where he'd been looking at the floor, and he waited for Tony to continue.
Tony flinches slightly at the feel of claws digging into his leg and reaches out a hand to stop the cat, or Colonel as Steve called it, from falling off his lap.
"What are those doors there for Tony?" She pointed to the red and gold one, clearly that was Tony's door.
Pepper’s entrance into his office startled the man out of his thoughts before they could go to certain not safe for work areas.
If he really was no longer allergic, then there was truly nothing to stop him from carrying on his plan to woo Steve.
"Pepper, my sweet, fiery goddess I can assure you it was next on my very long to-do list", Tony replied, leaning back in his chair and rocking, hands cupped to the back of his head.
Tony somehow managed not to show any outward indication that the move had affected him. However, he prayed that the man didn't possess superhuman hearing otherwise the rapid thumping of his heart trying to beat out of his chest would have given him away.
Pepper tsked, moving around the desk to the gap in front of Tony's outstretched legs so that she could perch on the edge of the table.
"That," Steve mirrored Tony's dramatic point, and the smaller man's crush developed just a little bit deeper, "is due to my friend and business partner, Natasha. She's the one who bought this coffee and also the one who put the deposit down on all those over-the-top machines you can see behind the bar there at the back."
"THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD OF COMFORT THAT I AM USED TO ANTHONY." The other five groaned as Thor's voice momentarily deafened them.
"The sort of lady that knows what goes into their burgers, trust me, take her to... oh that one, nice little french restaurant. Don't bother about reservations." Tony took one look at Thor's face and decided to skip over introducing him to the world of having to
Things had started to calm and Tony was just on the edge of sleep when Clint's voice rang out startling him right back awake. "WOW, JESUS NAT! IS THAT YOUR
When Steve failed to answer his question, Tony looked back towards him and smirked when he noticed the other man's eyes darting up from where they had been fixed on Tony's throat.
"Tony will you please just listen to me?" Pepper shouted as she followed her boss in circles round his office. "It's just not practical! You're spending way more money than is coming in at the minute due to this 'Avenger' business and you've just spent
"Yes, I scheduled it in for 11:15 to 12. You're actually interrupting it right now. Quite rude don't you think Ms Potts?" Tony said, flashing her his patented 'million-dollar' smile which only grew wider when she rolled her eyes at him.
." He'd brought his head up now, staring down at her with his brown childlike eyes, the ones he knew could win him any argument with her.
His eyes were streaming, his nose was running, and his throat felt like someone had aggressively taken a strip of sandpaper to it.
"... and also it apparently goes a bit, um, gloopy? Like wine. That's when it cools down though.  Which is how some people might like their coffee I guess. Personally, I prefer mine just plain hot, but hey, everyone’s entitled to their own preferences” Steve jested, placing the now full cups onto two separate saucers.
Tony chanced a look again to his right out the tinted window and smiled to himself as the stranger walked back into the shop and out of his sightline.
"You're not going to let this drop are you?" Tony shook his head. " Fine, I'll start setting up the arrangements then." She sighed, but returned Tony's smile. "Will that be all Mr Stark?"
Tony hadn't touched a cat in over 30 years, and now he has perhaps the biggest one he has ever seen in his lap.
Tony turned his head, nuzzling into his friend's palm. "I'll think about it," Tony replied, his voice muffled.
"Then what are we having this talk for? You'll have your own lab for all your genetic'y science'y shit and then we can-"
Steve managed to tap the god on the shoulder, "Thor, what have we said about using an indoor voice."
"She taught me how to use them a few months back when we first opened. The woman can be intimidating but I gotta admit, she's one hell of a teacher." Steve smiled before taking a sip of his own coffee and Tony couldn't help the pang of jealousy in his stomach at the evident affection in the other man's voice.
She smiled at him briefly before letting it drop and donned what Tony referred to as her 'authority face'.
How Pepper managed to walk with such confidence in 5-inch stiletto heels AND with her head glued to her phone was a mystery to him.
He quickly turned on his heel and started to walk back the way he must have come (even if he doesn’t quite remember the journey over).
Sighing, he picked up the Colonel and ignored the affronted 'meow' he received in return before placing him on the ground at his feet.
In the morning Tony would ignore Pepper's comments over the video call about he looked the most refreshed she'd seen him in ages, but for now he'd just let himself be consumed by the comfort and happiness he felt in that moment.
"Yeah alright, you caught me. I don't know shit about coffee, and honestly, I don't even like it all that much" Steve said, sitting down opposite Tony with a sigh as he placed one cup by Tony and the other in front of himself.
The cat itself doesn't seem to notice the tension in its new handler and decides to make itself comfortable by kneading at the soft flesh of Tony's thigh.
"Fuck that thing is big!" He exclaimed, taken aback at how the cat seemed to stretch across Steve's entire torso.
"No, I love cats!" He exclaimed, and ironically, he did. He had begged his mom for one when he was small and had to find out the hard way that it wasn’t a possibility for him. "I've never really had much of a chance to interact with them though if I'm completely honest".
He doesn't feel any of that coming on though. Strange. His throat doesn't feel warm, and he hasn't yet had the urge to scratch his eyes out to rid himself of an itch.
"You ok Tony?" Steve said, following his gaze. "Oh, don't worry about those guys, I forget they're even in here sometimes. They're obviously a selling point for some customers, but most tend to just come in for the coffee." Steve pointed over to the table at the end of the shop to the left of the bar and motioned for Tony to sit. "They like to keep to themselves unless someone decides to pay them some attention so if you’re worried about potential cat hairs on your suit you should be fine as long as you don’t lie down on the rug.”
“Not on... warranty. Probably run out... by now.” Steve’s eyes stare distantly through the wall across from him.
He’s not worth all this. He can’t be. If space had swallowed him back then, he’d have died happy. A hero. His last act would have been something selfless, something that saved countless lives. He’d have been mourned, would have left a good impression. But he survived, and now he’s been given the chance to fuck up making friends.
Once his heavy combat boots are laced, he’s dressed. The clothes are surprisingly comfortable. He pulls on some combat gloves, zips his previous outfit into the bag, and walks out.
Tony rolls his eyes and tucks the item away again, waving his hand dismissively. “If ol’ eye-patch expects me to break into a high-level security system with a handful of screwdrivers, he’s out of his mind. Which I could do, by the way, don’t get me wrong. I almost want to, just to prove it to him, but JARVIS could do it far more gracefully. That’s what you guys want, right? In an out without a trace? J’s pretty sneaky. Won’t take him long to smooth-talk his way through any shit those monkeys programmed.”
This one is blue. It’s faster and sharper and newer than the one he’s just worn, the display buzzing with information as usual. How does Tony follow all of this at once? Even his serum-enhanced brain is struggling to process it all, whatever he can understand. JARVIS is already filtering the display for him though, showing him only what is absolutely necessary.
“If I have to. I can see and hear better than you can. And you can’t sit there with the flashlight in your hand.”
Tony stops in his tracks, and his eyes are dark when Steve turns to look at him. He points an accusing finger up at the larger man’s chest. “You know what? You’re a dick. I don’t get what my dad thought was worth wasting his life looking for. You don’t know shit about me, Rogers. I
Well my friends, thank you for enjoying this little adventure with me! I have many other projects on the go, but I am always open for feedback and suggestions! If you've got ideas and things you want to see, I always keep a list.
Steve can start to feel his shoulders tensing up again. “I’ve done it before. The serum lets me get away with it.” He’ll pay for it once he lets it catch up to him, but he’ll be home by then.
“I’m surprised you showed,” Fury is already there, a drink in his hand, leaning on the bar. Beside him, dressed in his blue stealth uniform, hands clasping his belt and his expression just as serious as always, is Steve Rogers.
There’s plenty of space for the two of them in here. Steve can stand up straight inside, and there’s plenty of room to stretch his arms out and spin in circles if he wanted to. He spots the rocks on the forest floor and knows they’ve come from higher up the cliff, but he doesn’t press, and he doesn’t argue. Tony seems surprised by that as Steve simply steps out of the cave and continues to walk along the cliffside without further comment on the subject. It’s not his place to pry, and he’s smart enough to tell that his companion isn’t fond of caves for whatever reason. If this were a freezer or an ice bath, Steve would be the hesitant one. Tony might not be his bestest friend, maybe not his friend at all, but Steve’s not a dick.
Iron Man can’t be left out in the forest. It’s one huge beacon pointing to their location. Once again, he leaves Steve on his own, and pushes into the rain. If he has Iron Man, he has JARVIS, and can contact SHIELD. Without those turrets, he’d have already used the beacon. But if he can call and let Fury know about those weapons, they can send the helicopter safely to this side of the island without coming anywhere near the turrets’ range. They can get Steve out of here and checked out.
Fury doesn’t budge, even under the judgmental stare from the inventor. “Yes, Stark. I did. I knew there was a chance things could go wrong. There always is. If a fight broke out, I needed to know you’d be safe. Nobody could have protected you better than he can.”
They do, finally, striding right past and leading the way up to a meeting room. Tony leaves the armor in the corner, Steve sets his shield against the opposite wall. Everyone gathers around the table, the two Avengers, plus Fury and a handful of SHIELD operatives, and the brief begins.
The soldier tries to take the case from Happy, insisting the weight is nothing for him, but the man won’t have it and insists on lugging it down himself. There isn’t much in it, at least, but Tony knows Steve could have tucked it under his arm like a purse. With his back still healing though, the inventor is on Happy’s side.
“I never thought anybody could make a gown look good, but you pull it off,” Tony shakes his head. He must say he’s a little disappointed that it doesn’t hang open at the back, though it does look a bit like a minidress given how high up it rides on the soldier’s thighs. It doesn’t do much justice to his tapering hips though.
Everything he touches turns to ash. Now Steve’s suffering for it, the next victim of the Stark curse. Tony
“Yes, I do. Now suit up. We’ll brief you on the helicopter.” Fury empties his water glass and sets it down, turning on his heel in a swirl of black.
“You can fly it as much as you like when your head’s screwed on right,” Tony promises. There’s hopefulness in his eyes, and a slight questioning tone in his statement.
“I’m breaking you out of here in a couple of days,” Tony promises. “And... you can come home with me. If you like. Better than moping around by yourself for three weeks. I guess. I mean, you might not want the company. Or
Once it’s bright enough, and the last few stars are chased away, Steve goes back inside the tent. The sooner they leave, the better. They have a lot of ground to cover. “Tony,” he announces, nudging the man sprawled under the blanket. “Up.” He’s not sure how he’s supposed to wake up a man he doesn’t know very well. Should he kick him? Shake him? Or just stand over him and say his name until he gets up?
“Rogers.” They’ve fallen, right. Tony glances up the cliff. It’s a long way up. He can’t even see the top, it’s so obscured by trees.
They pull up together and circle the complex side-by-side. “Just couldn’t bear to be away from me, could ya,” Tony comments.
“With a few days’ rest he’ll be good as new,” the woman smiles at him over her shoulder. “The surgeons fixed his back without any complications. He might have some trouble walking for a little while, but nothing should be permanent. The serum is already well on its way to healing him.”
Steve doesn’t like being on the sidelines for any reason, and he doesn’t like not knowing what’s going on. At least he still has his earpiece, through which he can hear Tony breathing, and the occasional exchange with JARVIS. Even over the buzz of helicopter rotors, he can hear the sounds of gunfire below.
Steve deliberately ignores him. The guy’s actually right: nothing is official, but he did technically sell himself to his country the second he joined the super soldier program. This is all he has, all that’s left. Without Fury, without SHIELD, he has nothing, just a body to live in and no soul to fill it. That’s how it feels anyway, but he can never say that because it’ll sound stupid if it leaves his lips. Maybe it doesn’t have to be this way, maybe he could have said no to Fury’s recruitment, but he hates sitting alone in an empty apartment more than anything. When he picks up his shield, he can taste the memory of who he used to be. Fighting feels good: it’s what his body is made to do, and he’s good at it. He likes being able to save people, protect them, do what he’s always wanted.
Tony folds his arms on the mattress and drops his face into it. He needs to stop feeling so sorry for himself. But the more he tries to bottle it down and fight the urge to cry, the more Steve’s stroking hand on his shoulder blasts apart his strength. The soldier jerks his hand across Tony’s back, whatever he can reach. He can’t take it anymore. The dam has to break, or he’ll surely explode.
“My data banks are equipped with plenty of martial arts techniques,” JARVIS replies steadily. “Perhaps I can be an adequate substitute for your skill and instinct.”
Tony is already on his feet, striding right for the door. He has no more words for the director. Besides, he’s got some promises to keep. The woman glances back into the room as Tony approaches, but she leads the inventor off anyway. Fury follows, and Tony ignores him. “How is he?” Steve’s all that matters.
The sun rises, and Steve stands up. He folds up his blanket and makes sure all his weapons are holstered. Guns and knives aren’t really his style, or his preference, but there was no chance of bringing his shield, and he needs to be armed in some way.
Sleep is Captain America’s best (and only) medicine. But the battle is far from over. JARVIS interprets his movements and guides the suit accordingly. He runs with strong steps, and though Iron Man could never contend with his agility, it’s still fast. Steve makes contact with a HYDRA agent loading more rounds into a machine gun, punching him with a metal-wrapped fist. The gun falls, and the man sails into the concrete wall of the complex. It’s terribly satisfying, more than punching HYDRA soldiers has ever been. Steve’s punched a lot of HYDA soldiers.
He can just see the glow of his arc reactor pushing from under the collar of his shirt and coveralls. Just like that, he’s back in Afghanistan, and there are wires running under his shirt. A car battery is keeping him alive, and his whole chest aches. It’s not Steve at his feet but Yinsen, who’s given his life so Tony can live instead. How many more people will have to die for him? How many people will get hurt protecting him?
“Everybody move out,” Fury orders, and starts to lead the way to the hangar. Tony flicks his wrist, and Iron Man strides along behind them. It gives him great pleasure when he spots the apprehensive faces of the agents escorting them. This whole mission may be worth it just for that.
of a mess), but in the end Steve had loosened up, showing there was more to him than following the rules. Right now, in his SHIELD-issued uniform, Steve looks like he carries a little notebook full of rules in his utility belt.
Steve isn’t sure if that’s true, and he’s torn between annoyed and impressed that he knows it’s entirely possible. It’s not Tony’s eagerness to show off that annoys him, it’s the flippancy with which safety measures of this operation are being so casually disregarded that’s riling him up. He holds his expression firm. “What else did you bring.”
Tony groans and shifts, and to his relief nothing protests too terribly. Nothing is broken, and he hasn’t ruptured anything. All his limbs are attached and functional, just bruised.
Steve knows that Natasha probably could have done this alone with a bottle opener and some scotch tape. She’s a spy. He is not. Sneaking around gathering intel is not one of his strong suits, and though he’s not exactly a show-boat, running in and blowing everything up is much more to his strengths. He won’t tell that to Tony.
to be moved. If Tony is careful... He’ll just have to hope that Captain America is tough enough to withstand a little jostling.
It’s really not. This whole mission has been a complete disaster. If he hadn’t lost control of himself, they’d have gotten out safely. The two of them had been doing so well right up until he’d lost himself and called the suit. And Steve got hurt for it.
Steve can think about these issues once the job is done; who knows, maybe somewhere along the road he’ll figure it out, and everything will make sense. Maybe he’ll even agree with the director’s motives. Or maybe he won’t. That’s a fairly large possibility. Steve isn’t the government’s lap dog, contrary to what some might believe.
Fury watches as the inventor takes the top off a bottle of whiskey and tosses a cup in his hand, catching it the right way and starting to pour. The second the bottle is back on the shelf and he’s about to take a sip, Steve’s huge frame is easily reaching across the counter and plucking the drink from his hand. “It is,” the soldier agrees, “but these are your weapons being built.”
Together, Steve and JARVIS right and suit and stand over the body for a moment while the soldier catches his breath. He flexes his hand and winces. “Good work, J, thanks.”
“I know that,” Tony’s joking tone finally cracks, and it feels like a petty victory to rouse that frustration. “I’m not a moron, and I’m not taking this lightly.”
Steve isn’t a hardened, soulless soldier who only cares for order and rules. He’s sweet and friendly and understanding. He wants to make other people happy, even within his own suffering. He’s endlessly selfless, endlessly caring, and more human than anyone Tony has ever met. All of that he knows from just a couple of days spent in some cave. Now it looks more and more that they’ll get to spend some more time together. How much more will he learn about the Captain? There’s more to learn, he knows it. Steve’s already alluded to some of those layers.
“Trying to take care of you,” the director does give a little now, sighing ever so slightly. “The Avengers may have disbanded, and was never my team in the first place, but I like to think I can still do something to help. You need each other. Besides. It’s not hard to spy on a man always in the limelight.”
Steve’s still on his back, unconscious but stable. Tony wastes no time unpacking, turning on the lamp and shedding the cavern with yellow light. He spreads the thermal floor cover down, rolls out the sleeping mats one on top of the other, and drags Steve over by his shoulders again. With a little maneuvering, he’s positioned the Captain on the mats.
“You really sure about coming over?” Steve asks quietly. “I mean... we don’t know each other that well.”
“We’ll find shelter and set up base,” Steve finally says once the rocks are behind them and the forest swallows them. He can see quite well despite the lack of light, so he knows that this dense forest they’re about to plunge into will be full of good places to build a camp. If the facility they’re scouting is at twelve o’clock, then the jet dropped them off at almost six. It’ll be a bit of a trek, but it’s safer to have their camp far away just in case.
Tony makes a point about groaning, even though the reaction he’ll get from the AI is less than satisfactory. It’s more fun with Pepper. “What does he want.”
But that’s it. He won’t appreciate anything else as he follows Steve out onto the helipad. This suit does the good Captain much better justice than the crap he wore just a year-and-a-half ago against the Chitauri. Still, Tony knows he can do better. He waits to appraise Steve from top to bottom until the faceplate is secured and he’s safe to let his eyes roam where he wants. Sure, Steve may be a square, but he’s a hot piece of ass, with broad shoulders and a tapered waist.
It’s a nice evening, he has to say. The air is cool but refreshing. It’s quiet, far away from the city and civilization in general. Steve tries not to get lost in how relieving this is for his sensitive ears. There are no cars beeping, no grumbling engines, no thick street chatter. Just a few birds and the rustle of leaves. He can taste the ocean, crisp and fresh on his tongue. It’s rained recently, he can taste that too, and it cleanses his sinuses of city smog.
Tony lands outside, on the redesigned pad. The doors open and he walks into the lounge, stepping out of the suit as it peels away and stands sentry.
who are revered by the mass public, looking down on me and seeing only what I was, and not what I tried to become. I’m not perfect, okay? Never have been, never will be. But at least I’m trying. You’re not giving me much to work with here, and I’m
For once there’s no argument. Tony just smiles and pats his blanketed shoulder. “Yeah yeah, I’m amazing, what else is new.”
“We aren’t” Steve assures. He’s got a better idea: look for shelter. Where there’s a cliff, there are rocks, which means there might be a cave somewhere. SHIELD scans have shown there are likely to be caves around these mountains, especially with the rivers and streams cutting down from the top. There’s plenty of room for water to flow through and erode away a little shelter. Tony follows obediently as Steve wanders along the cliffside, brushing away foliage. Even if they can’t find a cave that two people can comfortably fit inside, it would be quite easy to make a shelter between the almost-vertical incline and some trees.
“We can turn the lights on in there, and it won’t be so dark,” Steve reassures, finding it impossible to keep up the stern distance he’s been so diligently cultivating. Lots of people are afraid of the dark, and he won’t hold it against anyone not to feel comfortable in it. Steve himself isn’t fond of it, but with some lights on it’ll be a nice shelter.
There’s little chance of that, but Steve knows that from this point onward, Tony will do what he wants no matter how much they argue. This mission is testing his nerves more and more, and they haven’t even started it yet. “I’ll take first watch,” he growls, standing up and pushing the tarp flap aside. He brings his blanket with him and secures the tarp corner with a rock, sitting down in the dirt where he can see the forest best. Tony doesn’t protest or follow. He simply turns out the light. Steve hears him shuffle around a little as he gets tucked into bed.
He lands the suit on his feet, and though he can’t feel his legs, the impact traverses through the armor and shakes his body.
Steve smiles back, unable to tear his eyes away from his new friend. The EMTs waste no time strapping him in. He lets them tuck a blanket around his lower body and fit a rigid brace around his neck. “I could get used to it,” he agrees as Tony sits next to him and does up his seatbelt. They’re taking off, veering back toward the mainland. “It was pretty amazing. I could teach JARVIS a thing or too though.”
“Not until the battle is over,” Steve watches a small group of SHIELD agents swarm the back door, armed with stolen HYDRA weapons and racing in to clear out anyone still hiding.
Tony has a feeling this may not be the first time the serum has mended the un-mendable. As he understands it, the Captain is more-or-less immune to anesthetics, too. He wonders how many surgeries Steve’s been awake for. And what about this one? Did he have to suffer much?
“Welcome back, sir,” JARVIS greets. It’s been a while since Tony’s visited. Sometimes he comes up here, usually to hang out with Bruce in the lab. The tower would make a good base of operation, though he hopes there’s never a reason for the Avengers to reassemble.
It takes Steve a few moments to process all of Tony’s relieved and concerned rambling. He peers down at his wrists, noticing the brace and understanding the joke. Tony can physically see the haze melt from his eyes. “Oh.” He smiles.
Steve smiles. “You’re welcome. Thanks for letting me borrow your suit, and for letting me stay here. Been kinda lonely. It’ll be nice to have the company. You don’t owe me anything though, Tony. You’ve been really generous-”
Everything in his life feels like it turns to disaster. “God, what have I done...” Tony wraps himself more tightly in his blanket and puts his head between his knees. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t pull himself out of this. He’s shaking again, replaying the events over and over in his head. Now they’re in this cave, and he just can’t take it. He wants to cry, and his throat is tightening. All the air in his chest is evacuating, leaving him with nothing but choking, breathless sobs. “Fuck.
The stone beneath his final step wobbles, and Tony loses his balance. Steve’s fast, whipping out his arm and catching the inventor by the front of his vest before he can fall. It wouldn’t have been far, but with all those rocks he’d have surely broken something. It was a close call. Steve’s hauling Tony up the rest of the way and setting him safely on his feet on flat dirt. They both stare at each other for a moment, Tony a little flushed and caught off guard. Steve’s not sure if it’s because he’s been man-handled, or because he nearly fell.
“I cannot say,” JARVIS replies calmly. “But I suggest you answer it. His direct attempt to contact you can only signify urgency.”
Apparently the past doesn’t just bite you in the ass: it follows you around like the plague, a disease that eats you slowly from the inside, manifesting a new symptom just when you think you’ve purged the last of it. There is no cure, no medicine, no way of telling when this terrible disease will remind you that it’s there, and no way to tell if it’s gone.
Maybe if he just waits a few minutes the super soldier will come round. He did take the full force of their fall, and surely nobody can just bounce back after that.
SHIELD medical is just as sterile and cold as any other hospital. Tony hates it, and vows to get Steve out of here as fast as possible. “How long are you keeping him here?” he asks more aggressively than is necessary.
find a cave, and it’s on their level, no climbing needed to reach it. There are some thick bushes obscuring it, and the entrance is narrow, but he can squeeze his shoulders through. He turns once he’s inside, and Tony is frozen in place, a distant look in his eyes as he stares with horror at the entrance.
Steve’s back burns, and his fingertips are tingling again. JARVIS rights him, and helps him delivery a powerful kick into the guard’s chest. It’s strong enough to crack bone, mathematically aimed and balanced. Steve swallows his nausea and twists at the waist. The AI takes care of the footwork, and spins him around, bringing the other foot up and hooking the heel into the guard’s ear. It makes a loud crack, but it’s not enough to down their opponent.
a little warm, soaking into the metal casing, and into his chest. “Does it hurt?” Steve asks quietly.
Tony scampers to his side. They manage to match their strides despite their difference in leg length.
Can you imagine that when I first conceived this, I thought it might be more on the cute/humorous side of things? And look what happened instead. I'm not sorry.
He waits in terror for Captain America to respond. But the soldier doesn’t spit in disgust or walk away. He blushes deeper, and doesn’t say a word.
The floor length windows of his office looked out onto the skyline of high-rise buildings, (although none were higher than Stark Industries
"Tony, have you signed off on those VAT receipts for this month yet? Accounts are starting to get a bit worried and by a bit worried I mean Debbie’s already made her way through a packet of heartburn tablets. "
"Your belongings have arrived ahead of you and have been placed in the rooms Tony thought would suit you best, however feel free to change your mind if you so wish."
The look of outrage on the taller man's face would have worried Tony if it hadn't been replaced by a small smile soon after.
Tony doesn't know how he got from that conversation to having five superheroes in his bed but he'd like to find out.
Yeah, this was for the best. He'll just tell Steve he's busy. Sorry, no can do today pal-a-reno, work commitments and all that.
"Tony! Are you leaving?" Steve questioned, and Tony couldn't help but be slightly happy with the fact the man didn't seem too pleased at the prospect.
A- Note: This is going to have no plot. Like seriously no plot. I just wanted to write Avenger fluff. This chapter is just Tony convincing everyone to come to the mansion and other chapters will involve various moments with the team getting to know each other, with Tony/Steve developing throughout. It's my first time writing for these characters so bear with me while I get the feel for them.
He truly was beautiful. Tony knew he had light blond hair, (his car had made an excellent creeper helper with its one-way tinted glass), and it was styled into the usual soft quiff but he had never seen it this close. He had never been able to make out the few sparse copper strands that glinted in the sun giving the man an almost ethereal glow.
"Don't worry Pops" Tony said whilst making his way over to the door to follow the others. "I'll look after your children for you."
Somehow his lust-filled brain had managed to omit that word when he had first noticed Steve. It wouldn't have affected his desire for the man in the slightest, but it would have made him think twice about stepping foot inside the shop.
The coffee waved slightly in the cups, threatening to spill over the rim as Steve turned and halted at the sight of Tony.
"Right, you, along with the other four members of our team, are going to live in my house so that we can bond and get to really connect as a team. I guessed you'd be alright with this saying as you've been trying to get us to go on all those team-building courses..."
And if someone were to ask why Tony Stark was humming to himself as he made his way to the car... well, for once he could say it was because he was
Tony waited a while until he realised Steve wasn't going to settle any time soon and looked up into the other man's eyes to find him looking back. "I can move off if it's too uncomfortable for you, I mean there's some spac-" Tony stopped speaking as an arm snuck round his waist, holding him to the soldier.
"...the rooms are soundproof as well." Pepper raised an eyebrow. "Not because of that Pep, jeez what kind of man do you take me for? No. Don't answer that. Anyway, it's actually because of Thor, that man is as loud in sleep as he is awake. Trust me, this is best for everyone."
The Colonel looks up towards the brunette at the feel of his hand, and for the first time Tony can see that he's missing his left eye, a single scar running across closed flesh vertically where it once must have been.
"BUT..." Thor seemed to notice Tony's recoil even through the armour at the boom of his voice. "But you are presented with golden crowns there. What lady doth not want to be treated like royalty?"
His eyes took in the rest of the blond as he continued to write, pulse quickening as the man's biceps threatened to split the fabric of the short-sleeved white cotton shirt.
"I'm guessing Natasha's the one who bought you the beans then?" Tony asked, picking the cup up again to drain it in one gulp, the action forcing his head back slightly.
“My friend, Nat, has assured me that as long as it’s brewed just right, this coffee should be one of the smoothest to dri-”
He'd been running away when Steve had chased after him hadn’t he? He wasn't ready. He’d had a plan. This wasn’t in the plan.
Gasping slightly, he felt his face warm as he realised how close he was with the man he had been crushing on for months.
He imagined those tree trunk arms picking him up and slamming him against a wall. One hand underneath to keep him steady and the other reaching up, two fingers outstretched, moving towards Tony's mouth so that he could suck on them and worship his skin and-
The sound of a bell chiming behind him along with a light clink of glass doors closing was enough to startle him but he refused to slow down or turn around.
Steve smiled at Tony's face as he grimaced at the reminder of what those courses involved. "I am definitely ok with this Tony. However there is a lot we need to talk about and we're going to have to make sure everyone knows what they're getting into by moving in together and-"
A soft purr came from his left, and that’s when Tony noticed just what he was now sat next to. It was a three-tiered black velvet cat tree with, what looked to be, a massive mound of black and grey stripy fur asleep on the top. Tony noticed Steve tying a green apron around his waist in his peripheral, but he didn’t dare take his eyes off the cat tree. He waited for his eyes to stream or for his throat to close, but so far he'd seemed to have had no reaction to the cats even though he was seated right next to one.
, his mind supplied) on the table for balance. "You can tell her you succeeded, keep providing me with god-tier cups of coffee like that, and you'll have a hard time keeping me out of here."
"Oh don't worry I won't keep you, just here to let you know that you'll be moving out of your rundown apartment and into my amazingly perfect in every way mansion. Anyway, see you when it's done."
He wanted to take his time and map out the contours of his cheeks with his tongue. Taste the salt on his skin.
Steve scans the carnage below, forgetting his pounding head and strained breaths so he can focus on a plan. “How many suits do you have?”
“Maybe...” Steve winces. He’s still too sore to bend down and touch his toes, or twist all that much.
what he can do. “JARVIS,” he bats the EMTs away from him and throws off the blanket before they can stop him.
At least out here, in this forest, he can hear himself think. Tony’s voice, surprisingly, is his guide among a swamp of ideas he’s not contemplated properly in a long time. Whether he’s not had the chance, or just ignored them, he’s not sure. It’s hard to tell these days.
He fetches a blanket and some more pillows, jogging all the way. Steve lets himself be manipulated, and Tony carefully props up his huge body until he’s comfortable. He drapes a blanket over the soldier’s torso. Everything feels sudden and easy. All his fears are gone, just like that. “I guess that means I get to do this, then,” he leans over and kisses his new house-mate's forehead.
Steve’s arm pops back into place with a loud pop, but the soldier doesn’t even flinch, though Tony winces in sympathy. It’s done. He doesn’t give himself any time to breathe, continuing his assessment. Steve’s wrist looks a little swollen, probably fractured. It’ll heal in no time, and at least it doesn’t need setting. It won’t stop Captain America.
“Nonsense,” Tony grins. Who could say no to those sad puppy eyes? “I’d like the company. Here, I‘ll show you what I’m making.” He can’t hold himself together all of a sudden, brimming with the crackling desire to show Steve all his projects. The awe and interest in the soldier’s eyes is intoxicating, and it makes him feel... magnificent. If there’s another word for it, his genius brain can’t find it.
“So what, you’re gonna be taking all the watches for however long we’re stuck on this god-forsaken island?” Tony peels his own banana.
So Tony does what he always does when he starts to slide: he works on the suit. If he can’t fix himself, he can at least make himself a perfect shell.
“Despite the set-backs, the mission was a success,” Fury explains, eying Tony from across the desk. “We’re sending out a STRIKE team to take down the last stragglers, and we’re interrogating the captives for more info on buyers and other bases.”
The sky is much darker than he remembers it being, and when he looks up through the small patches of sky visible through the treetops, he can see dark storm clouds rolling in over them. It’ll be pouring rain soon, and there’ll surely be a search party out to scour the island for the two intruders. Tony can’t just leave Steve here on the ground to take his sweet time.
“Bottom of the ocean, about five-hundred meters off the coast,” Tony explains, “ready to fly to me when I call.”
Things were actually going well until... Until the elevator shaft. Until the open crate. Until he let his emotions get away from him. Tony squeezes his eyes shut, fighting against the wave of inadequacy dragging him down. All he wants to do is lie down and give up, but he can’t.
“’Oh’? That’s the best you got? Doctor, I think you screwed him up! I want a refund!” Is it cruel to tease Steve when he’s so out of it? Maybe. Is it fun, helping to unwind his tightly-strung nerves? Yes. Very much so. He’s not taking advantage of the situation, not at all. The soldier’s grinning, isn’t he? Sure, he’s doped out of his head, but he’s happy. “This better be on warranty, Rogers.” Tony is grinning himself, reaching over for the can of ginger ale the nurse left.
It’s amazing what a few days can do. Steve’s moving his legs by himself after two days of rest, while Tony helps him turn his upper body. His feet dangle off the edge of bed, and the nurse tests his reflexes. They’re a little weak and slow, but they’re not far from healthy. She brings him some slippers and slides them onto his feet.
