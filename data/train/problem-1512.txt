I hate fighting with John, but the idea of splitting the family up drives me insane. John hates fighting with me less than I hate fighting with him. He would not normally do so while I am still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that Mycroft is gone for good but the idea of waiting for Mary to move drives him insane.
“She will love it,” John states the obvious. After watching both films about lost fish she has become even more interested in sea life than before. The book delivers some information but more important, it will give her the names of myriads of new kinds of fish. John and I will have to learn them quickly to keep up with her.
“John likes to take care. Give him situations in which he can do so, e.g. you could sprain an ankle or catch the flu. That will heal him faster than your tedious “Time heals all wounds” mentality. Time does not heal all wounds. Believe me.”
“I only had a thirty minute window but that baby never stopped crying.”
Was that really it? John had to bite his lip to stop himself from sighing. There was no need to try and blame it all on Mary. She was who she was, and he had fallen for her, once, when he was …
It is highly illogical, but I am not ready to take that step right now.
Well, the idea of people having a crush on me is nothing new, though incomprehensible to me. And if this crush is big enough to make that woman provide me with information she would otherwise keep secret, who am I to reject that?
A brutal picture formed in his mind now, one that Sherlock must have seen at the very first look: Adigi had got shot in the back of his head, sunk to the desk, but had been aware of it at some level, trying to fight it, maybe trying to hold on to something, smearing his own blood all over the desk with his arms in his final death struggle, and with that pushing the cash box down on the floor.
“You will like her,” Janine says, and it turns out that she is absolutely right.
Does oral sex get boring if it is delivered once daily? (God no)
I miss him. Terribly. Always will. Just like I miss John and Emmi.
What? He blinked.
Then suddenly, Sherlock's body stiffened. He stopped following John's rocking movement. The sobs died.
There is so much subtext in that sentence. “Please don't say no”, he says without saying, and “This is important and more than just taking a shower”, and “Trust me”, and “I know what I am doing, I think”, and “Your pain hurts me”, and (of course) “I love you”.
Then we drive back to London where we try to find Mary before she finds us.
My wrist hurts.
John stares at me in bewilderment. I can see the wheels inside his brain turning, before he asks, “When?”
“Would have thought you’d be freed by now, wouldn’t you?” Moran teased, clearly aiming at making John fear Sherlock would not find him in time. With one swift movement he turned John's chair around. “How long have I been here?,” John asked, his throat still hurting, his voice harsh. “All in all? Six days. You’ve been out cold for four days after I got you, and another two after…” He didn’t end the sentence, softly touching John’s throat instead, maybe even caressing it. John shuddered.
Without hesitation he approaches her body and fishes for her mobile. Finds it in one of her trouser pockets.
But little Sherlock wants to play, really really wants to. So I watch him use the most powerful weapon against his big brother. “Only because you are about to lose,” he claims, then ignores Mycroft entirely and after a while states, “Yellow car! I am leading by ten to nothing. Starting to play now would be stupid, 'cause you can't win anyway.”
John wondered if he should help him. Dr Davies had been very clear about John not doing that to support his recovery but it hurt him to see how Sherlock -
When I don't answer, he places his hand softly on my curls. “Tomorrow is the 27th of May.”
He does not complain when they spend his birthday in the library, comparing lexicons because something about her linguistic knowledge is about to convict a landlady. Well, the fact that Sherlock wears his new lilac shirt that day knowing that it is a definite turn-on for John makes up for that. Definitely. And also the fact that they shag inside the library's toilet twice as a birthday present.
and suddenly there is air and I gasp and pant and my hair is wet and cold and I'm shaking and panting and finally there is enough air inside my lungs again and I can force my body to calm down.
That might have been a mistake, for now I can see the whole of the crash site. The nose of the plane is lying on its back, several yards away from the cabin. The tail of the plane is driven into the ground almost vertically. The cabin is compressed, its hull torn in several places. There is debris lying around, as well as body parts.
(between eighteen and twenty-one years old, studying, grew up here, owner's son)
I have to wait a whole day before I receive an email from him. Access to online archives worldwide. Not all of them legal.
“I'm sorry, John.” I try again but he doesn't react.
He turns from half-hard to hard instantly.
“Do you remember who shot you?” she asked him, leaning very close to him. Was there an unspoken threat in her voice? John needed to take a deep breath. Impossible. He was surely just imagining things. The last fifteen days had been hard on him too, and he was tired to the bone.
Is she telling the truth? John will want to know. I need to deduce if she tells the truth. Can't see her face but her voice should be enough. I need to deduce her.
I tell him more about Amrum, unimportant things like that the windmill in Nebel is now a museum or how important the island is for shelducks. He sometimes looks in my direction but never into my eyes. I do not think he is listening, so I refrain myself from telling him important things. He would most likely miss them anyway.
He has to be unconscious.
“John,” I say (pleadingly) but do not know how to go on. I remember that day almost three months ago. There is nothing my parents could have said to ease my fear.
Sherlock was simply not used not being to blame for an incident. Hence, he had no idea how to deal with being the guiltless party of a fight.
I am afraid that she is right about that. I had my bottom-hitting in the form of a big red bus. John, on the other hand, is still spiralling downwards.
When I accidentally choose rice with prawns John understands what I am doing. He gets angry. All I can do is look at him apologetically. Which is stupid, really. I am the one who would have been forced to eat something he doesn't like, not John.
It seems impossible that this is the same person.
Banned from Fenwick's. It might not only be people's reservations against the pagan origins of Christmas, but also their objection against graphic descriptions of how the Roman scapegoat was killed.
When they break the kiss after a long, long time, they are both gasping for air. Sherlock is so horny he would have sex in a haystack if nothing else would be available, and he is happy and fulfilled and content with life for the very first time and happy. John is his hero of the hour, and he himself is still completely lost regarding what to do next.
As I am the one who broke him, it should be me attempting to do the mending, but he has made his decision on that topic clear.
He flees from her when she starts dwelling on the fact that Sherlock never buys John flowers.
If John had turned to the right instead of turning to the left he-.
That was why her betrayal at Magnussen's office had stung so much.
The breathing tube was removed then, the medication was changed, and a physiotherapist came to discuss how they would get John up and running again soon.
When Sherlock finally breaks the kiss to gasp for air, John realises his hands have made it all the way into his trousers and to the rubber band of Sherlock's pants. He lets go reluctantly, wondering how many by-passers will spread ridiculous rumours tomorrow. But they are alone in the alley.
But Mycroft is adamant. Wish I would loath him as much as I always pretend to do. The fact that John supports his idea only makes it worth. I try to make the following weeks tolerable for me by getting to know my therapists better.
Then the film comes back into focus, and Sherlock's heart clenches so hard that for a second he is honestly wondering if he is suffering from cardiac arrest. John is not looking at her happily, or admiring. Instead, he is broken. So broken he does not even look hurt or lost. Dead.
I start visiting empty places, wander the Wadden Sea or hide in the forest.
John looks at me (surprised, for I usually ignore such provocations). Instead of answering he just shakes his head and snorts once more.
You are the one responsible for mending John now. I doubt that you know how, so I've made you a list of things you should keep in mind while dealing with him.
The third file was less disturbing than the other two, Mycroft thought. Yes, the amount of violence inflicted on Dr. Watson was even more severe this time, and he had already organised a bed for him at a clinic in Stockholm that was well known for its superior hand surgery, just in case they could save his life. But unlike last time, Sebastian showed control here, and so did John.
“I know,” imaginary John answered. “I have lost you once and it almost killed me.”
Suddenly, my brain jumps into action, and I know exactly what to do: get our jackets from the overhead locker (to keep him warm), get him out of the plane, get help.
That night, he includes the backyard in his mind hut. Just in case. One never knows if there might be a need for refuge one day.
(Facts calm me down. Like this one: Holloway Prison is located at Parkhurst Road. Opened in 1852, mixed prison. All female since about 1902. Completely rebuilt from 1971 to 1985. Capacity of 501.)
“This could have been the four of us,” she says and tiptoes to ruffle my hair. “Would have let you babysit the little one when going out with John. Would have let the two of you working on as many cases as you would have wanted.” She presses an (abhorrent) kiss on my lips. Her voice is playful and soft, “But now you have ruined everything. As always.”
To: Mary Morstan
But Sherlock never does that. Why would he?
“How?” John asks, voice shaking. He doesn't want to know but has to know anyway. He is still feeling something and it's nothing good.
He stepped closer to Sherlock, sat down again in the chair he had spent the better part of the last eighteen days in. It was unbelievable. Anger and pain mixed in his stomach. “I am sorry,” he whispered.
It is a quiet day when Sherlock thinks for twenty minutes that educating John in playing the violin is a good idea. It is not, of course, John could have told Sherlock so before. After all, there was a reason why John had stopped playing the clarinet age ten. But the way Sherlock stands behind him to adjust his elbows is absolutely worth the endless stream of comments on John's ineptitude that inevitably follows.
When the night nurse has looked after us one last time, I carefully sneak into John's bed. His body  is hurt, just like mine, and I try not to cause more pain. But there is no way I can abstain from feeling his body heat for one more second. John doesn't lean into my (soft) embrace the way he used to (probably because he doesn't want to hurt me), but he doesn't reject me either.
He realises that he might be in need of a miracle, but despite the season none happens. He visits Harry on Christmas, but spends most of the holidays thinking of macabre ways to end his pain. On New Year's Eve, he hears Sherlock playing the violin in his head. It is such a magnificent memory that he is rightfully moping at midnight.
God no.
Before I can give his comment any thought, he goes on, “You cannot open the door, so you simply turn away. You cannot play the violin, so you simply let it rot in the corner. You cannot speak, so you simply remain silent. You cannot stand to think about how broken John is, so you simply ignore it. When did you become such a coward?”
The memory of Janine telling him smugly about her new cottage came to Sherlock's mind. He had to swallow hard. They had been at peace with each other in his mind. In reality, she died without knowing he was only using her. Somehow it made him feel even more guilty than before.
Lord, no!
I curse my indecisiveness, yet I am lost as of what to do next.
When my eyes fall on Mary (standing in the kitchen, her right arm loosely around John's hips, a completely innocent expression on her face, her left hand thoughtlessly placed on her immense belly), I tell myself to remain impassive.
He is there whenever someone comes to visit, helps me being nice to them, watches me sharply and hushed them out when he sees that I am getting exhausted. (He is especially alert when Mycroft pays a visit, and at first he is quite taken aback about how close we allow ourselves to be when there is no super villain threaten to watch us, but John gets used to it quickly and stops feeling uneasy in his presence soon.)
“We will both catch pneumonia if we won't get up soon,” he says after a while, so dryly that I have to laugh. He chimes in, and we are giggling hysterically. When we are finally able to control ourselves again, he turns around in my arms so we can look at each other. There is sadness in his eyes and regret but something else too.
When his body finally starts to cramp, when he inhales without getting any air, when it feels like he is drowning in water but it is only the blood inside his lungs, he welcomes death gladly. He closes his eyes -
We stare at each other. He takes a deep breath. His fingers are buried into my sleeves. He is shaking. “Stop that,” he repeats.
One day Sherlock sits over an experiment in the kitchen, emulsifying something or the other, an effervescent fluid placed next to him. It is not one of the entertaining experiments that draw John's attention to the kitchen. It is one of those John does not fully understand, with complicated chemistry.
He realized that the drizzle must have stopped some time ago. The streets were damp now, the water evaporating from the warm ground. The sun has not broken the clouds yet but it seemed to be only a matter of time. Damn.
The same as always: Sorry for being late, thank you for reading. Here is something fluffy today. :-)
Of course he had. I know that (now). But there is one thing I still fail to deduce. "Why didn't you commit suicide in Scotland?" I blurt out. (Should have drunk the wine slower.)
She stops in mid-sentence and bites her lips. Now that is the topic the two were dancing around earlier. “Now that Mary is what?” I ask, because there must be something bigger going on than the pregnancy.
He nearly-smiles once more. “Agreed.” I lead him into the bathroom (slowly but steadily), supply him with towels and fresh clothes from his travel bag and head downstairs into the kitchen.
“No way,” John hissed.
“Not with someone else,” I clarify. “With you. Well, inner you, that is.” He is a bit slow at getting it, I cannot help but think.
I watch her going from scared to sexually interested in three seconds.
I try to drown it in violin music, but fail. My brain feels like swimming in an ocean of remembered murmurs and whispers and trampling and mobile ring tones and mobile message tones and the clacking of keyboards and and the rustling of newspapers.
The smug smile on Moran's face widened. “Yes, you will die here,” he said with delight, entirely misreading the reason for John's swallowing. Then his eyes narrowed. “Well, maybe I should deliver you from your pain right now. It won't matter how long you have been dead when Sherlock finally finds you, will it?” He's bluffing. God, let him be bluffing. The look in Moran's eyes grew cold, determined, and his hands closed on John's throat. Please, let him be bluffing.
In the kitchen, I realize that I had not prepared anything. Right, the case. Had hoped to enjoy it. Stupid me. Had only demonstrated the vacancy by my side.
“That's none of your business” Sherlock snapped. For a while, Sherlock pretended to ignore Mycroft. He picked up his violin and played a few notes. Then he made himself tea. Then he sorted some of his papers that were scattered on the floor. Then he tried to light that fire again, only to fail once more.
Before we board the plane, we are searched very thoroughly. (No wonder. Last week's plane crash was caused by a bomb placed underneath one of the seats. Security are at maximum alert.) When we enter the plane it is apparent (to me) that it has been searched for explosives just minutes ago.(The smell of dogs is still present.)
When I was younger, I hated those kind of presents. They always came with obligations (showing the right amount of happiness, understanding the relevance giving it to me had for Mummy, and more).  Now that I am more relaxed with my parents (when exactly did that happen?) I cannot help but look forward to opening it.
John squeezes my hand. I snap out of my (frantic) mind for more than a second this time and find myself placed next to John on a plastic chair in the waiting room. Have been waiting for a while. How long? Check with clock at the wall. (Ikea, model Pugg, 12 pounds, less than three months old.) About one hour.
She retreats to the kitchen where her cheeks turn red with the rage she hides so carefully from John. That night, they have the roughest sex they ever had. She even considers allowing him into her rectum, just to make sure he is not missing anything in bed.
He always made sure to look sad on his way home (for Mycroft and his CCTV), refused to deal with attempted suicides at the clinic (because he knew he definitely wouldn't be able to do so had Sherlock really jumped to his death in front of his eyes) and spent enough time in his chair at home, doing nothing. He never touched his blog again, dutifully lied to Ella (who really was a terrible therapist, for she never realised he was lying) and gave away some of Sherlock's things, knowing only too well Mycroft would secretly acquire those that were important to his brother.
So instead, he watched Sherlock closing his eyes again, taking a little rest. He looked a bit troubled, a frown on his forehead, the corners of his mouth drooping a bit. He looked alive.
Mycroft's eyes pierced right through him. There was a snappish remark on Sherlock's lips already, but somehow he couldn't bring himself to say it. Because Mycroft was right, of course. A divorce would be the best thing for Sherlock to happen. Even if there was no chance that John would ever love him, he would surely move back in here again.
“Back home again, still alive.” he typed, and then added, “Plan working so far. Be careful!” Then he picked one special contact from the list, the only one actually connected to an existing mobile number, but covering its owner with the fake name of Mary Morstan.
He registered that there was a nurse by his side, and he knew she was talking to him but it was so much nonsense that he tuned her out. John was dead. He heard himself crying but what else was there to do now? With no reason to stop he sobbed like child, mourning the loss of John, the loss of everything they were and everything they would never be now.
(Fear.)
Because talking to me would inevitably intensify the love again. The love he is trying to bring to an end.
A stranger's voice mixing with John's. Light too bright. Blanket removed from my body. Cold. Something even colder and hard pressed against my belly, against my chest. Belly feels tense. Too cold. Want it to be warm again. Feel my legs stir, but am unable to control movement. Leave me alone! Finally the blanket is replaced. Warm. Sleep.
I close my eyes again, let him take the lead once more. I do not have to look at him anyway, the sight of him, grinning at me with affection, is burned into my retina. I feel his lips on mine again, and this time, with the first wave of desperate need ebbing away, I am able to really feel it, all of it. His body pressed against mine, emanating heat. His lips, soft yet strong, moving in time with mine. His hands, stroking every part of me they can reach, arm and shoulder and chest and side, caressing the part of my left arm where the cast begins. His tongue, demanding, seeking, inside my mouth.
Being able to follow more than one train of thought, Mycroft easily divided his attention between the video clip and his brother. Sherlock however gave the clip his full attention, his eyes darting across the screen of his laptop feverishly. He seemed oblivious to how clearly his emotions were visible on his face.
“Maybe you're overestimating my compassion,” I say, and try very hard not to close my eyes when she beats John so hard that the chair nearly topples over. (Funny how his pain hurts me. That could turn out to be a problem during our confinement here.) Mary's face clearly shows her anger with me, but no regret about nearly sending John to the ground. (Bad. She is willing to risk seriously hurting John. Maybe this whole thing turns out to be more dangerous than I thought. I try to will my fear away. Not easy.)
He is an egalitarian when it comes to insults. John is on the receiving end less than other people, but not completely left out. Other people never understand why he does not find it more enervating. But then, other people also never understand what it means that John can call Sherlock an idiot and be acknowledged for it by him.
The walks through London are the perfect opportunity to reform their friendship. They pass a group of teenagers who is unsuccessfully trying to raise a ruckus at the train station, and Sherlock instantly sputters out deductions on their backgrounds. John cannot help but smile. He missed that one, too.
No. Please please not.
“What a wonderful idea”, he lies, hoping that Sherlock knows it is a lie, and throws an evil glance at Mycroft. He has no clear idea of why he acts like that. Must be some strange kind of the team spirit he always feels when someone openly criticizes Sherlock.
Then he slows down. Is slowed down. With most of the network crushed, only the most persistent members left, the gaps between action gets longer. Unfortunately, that means more time for boredom. More time to be concerned about John.
He welcomes me and Janine (who has agreed to serve as a intermediary) with an easy-going “Nice to meet you!” (Lie. He hates to see us.) and lets us into his (expressively understated) home. Tells Janine that she is as beautiful as always. (Lie. Thinks that her bottom has got fatter.) Shakes my hand and makes it clear that he is sure that I will be able to prove his innocence. (Lie. Scared I might find out something about him. What? Need to investigate further.)
I ignore the choking sound John makes, concentrating fully on Mary. But I cannot tell …
I look at him (with a smile I could not hide even if I wanted to) and know that he knows how perfect his present turned out to be.
(opposite of Adigi's home, Seb shot him from the first floor of this building, first place I've looked on my own, returned here again with Mycroft the next day, clever of him to bring John here now, big building with large cellar and two rear buildings, plenty of hiding places, need to hurry up)
They have taken four more turns each when the ambulance finally arrives. One of the three paramedics has recently crossed the Atlantic Ocean, one of them is an asexual atheist and lives alone. The third one hates the tattoo on her ankle. There are further deductions hammering into Sherlock's awareness and he clings to them as to a lifeline. Because if he stopped deducing he would start feeling and that is a luxury he cannot afford right now.
This is no longer crippled, troubled, desperate John. This is Captain Watson, ready for a ferocious fight. He is still shaking his head. “No,” he agrees, and looks at me in defiance. “No, nothing will happen to the two of you. Because I will protect you.”
Sorry for the delay. Let's call it "summer slump".
And John afterwards, when she realises that he will not love her anyway.
Daddy is happy just to be on holiday (as always). Mummy is interested in each and every person around us (as always). She shares her deductions with us right away and (as far as I can tell) they are spot on (as always).
His body goes slack again, his head falling down onto my shoulder. (My loins are burning and burning, a strange kind of pain that is not pain but fear.) (Don't die on me don't die don't die!)
To: Mary Morstan
Sincerely yours,
The cold wind is smelling of salt and algae and the coming of frost and snow. It is the last week of November, I remember suddenly. Christmas time will begin next Sunday. Mummy must have bought tons of decoration already.
I cannot play the violin with my cast, so I retreat into my mind palace and practice a difficult piece of music there. I want to play it during my next visit to Sherrinford.
But then his hand cups mine, presses my fingers hard against my own cock, and starts moving my hand in time with his thrusts. God it feels good.
After passing the third row my brain tunes out all of the horrors. I know there must still be people all around me but I can no longer see them clearly. It is simply too much to comprehend.
Sherlock finally moved towards them, too. John rose from the chair
Emmi makes touching little sounds sucking her pacifier in her sleep. The little stuffed sheep John gave her for Christmas is half hidden underneath her. She sighs (happily) and starts dreaming of something nice (apparently). I continue loving her for a while. Then I tear my eyes away from her and go back downstairs.
“The active phase of childbirth takes an average of eight hours in the UK,” I tell John, who grins at me like a maniac. Why is he grinning? There is a child about to be born. (Well, sometime within the next seven hours or so, but still). Our baby (more or less).
Suddenly, John felt ice-cold inside. Almost all of her lovers were dead. All except him and...
John looked Moran directly in the eye now, all signs of weakness and doubt and being broken replaced by determined conviction: “I always understood that he wanted to become a good man. And I know that he relied on me to be his conscience. No matter how long we would have lived together, I would have never been allowed so close to his heart had I been a lesser man.” Truth. He saw Moran's eyes losing their focus. “He couldn't have loved me had I been … I don't know … say, a cold blooded serial killer ...”
It is also a rare time of having a permanent address, because it really is John who does all the apologizing to Mrs Hudson. She is fond of Sherlock, maybe even as much as Sherlock is fond of her, but she would have drawn the line after Sherlock had been forced to store all the patellae in her fridge because their own had been filled with perineum muscles.
He looked up to watch Sherlock and Mary, who were busy trying to light a fire in 221b's fireplace. Only recently had Sherlock hired a firm that turned his gaslight fake fireplace into a real one, and now he and Mary decided to make 221b a bit cosier. They were having little success, mainly because they both had absolutely no idea how to light a fire, but they were clearly having fun and enjoying each other's company.
Before I really know what I am doing, my fingers fly across my mobile. Most of the documents I need are classified or simply not to be found online. Does sending Mr Super-Secret screen shots of the pages I need access to count as communicating? Surely not.
Is it the wine? Is it the strange mood? I don't know but I take a deep breath and say, “If Mycroft had allowed them to send me to Serbia, none of ...”
But of course I did. Threw another WRONG in his way. To get some time with him alone, and to see how much WRONG from me he can stand. I wish I could find the words to explain. “I've missed you,” I whisper into his waist instead.
When Christmas comes, the blog entries are ready to be uploaded. I am a bit unsure if my writing is good enough but when I show the draft to my parents Mummy is tear-filled and Daddy does the shoulder clapping routine I have come to like.
Regardless of the fact that I am a murderer. I will go unpunished, no matter what I deem to be right. Maybe that I am still dreaming of Magnussen's dead eyes and the (incredibly small amount of) blood dripping from his temple every night is my punishment. Maybe the shot that still echoes in my mind is worse than any legal punishment.
“Sebastian will let me know if he has seen me here. Until that, we'll wait.”
Then, with an unexpected move, Sebastian reached out and placed his hand on Sherlock's.
Their eyes locked, and Moran's face was nothing but determined. John felt his lungs burning. God, please let him be bluffing. For a second, Moran loosened his grip, and John choked in as much air as possible before the hands closed around his throat once more. So he was still playing with him. He would not die now. He felt his hands clenching helplessly, his vision dimming rapidly. He would wake up again. He wouldn't die now. The last thing John heard when his body started to go limp was Moran chuckling.
Okay, to be true, John does tell him to stop it after the otter incident. With many outrageous swear words that would make even an open-minded sailor blush. But it has the same effect a tiny origami object has in an orang-utan compound (none).
We are standing in the living room. He is there for a short visit, a few stolen minutes, before he and Mary will leave for their honeymoon. (She thinks he just wants to say goodbye for two weeks.) Still feels wrong to have him here as a guest. He belongs here. (Used to belong here. Not any longer. Accept it.) His face determined. He came here with a (seemingly) simple question, not willing to leave without an answer.
He breathes in again. It takes him three attempts to finish his dying breath. Then suddenly his body is jerking with so much force that I nearly let go of him, and then, in one fluid, almost elegant movement, his body slacks. First his legs, then his torso. Then his hands lose their grip on me, slowly sliding down my body, almost softly. Then his head lolls down my arm.
“All those times he found excuses to touch me ...” John ventured on with another half-lie, fascinated by watching Moran's expression crumble more and more. Ignored the fact that he could no longer keep his own legs from trembling. Not much longer now. But he was nearly there anyway.
Sometimes he thinks that it will start when John leaves him because he cannot stand Sherlock any longer. Never is Sherlock closer to relapse than on those days.
For a heartbeat, she thinks Sherlock is really trying to be helpful. Then her heart hardens and she reads it a third time. No, it is far from being helpful. Half of it is simply wrong, the rest is insulting or histrionic.
I do my best to put on my "it doesn't matter" face when he rings the bell because I really don't want to make him sad. He has gone all the way to Scotland and back and has surely done his very best to convince John to come with him. If he couldn’t achieve it, no one could.
John's head snaps up and I see his eyes grow wide with fear. It matches the ice cold fist that suddenly has a hold on my stomach.
When John leaves that day, he is extremely fierce about the “See you in three days” part of saying goodbye. He tells me about the scan they will have tomorrow morning, that will most likely tell them if it will be an Emilia or an Anthony. “Grace or Joshua” I correct him, and he smiles again.
The terrible thing about it is that he is hurting himself with it, too. I can see it in his face every time I cannot hide my pain. When we are back at his holiday home after two hours we are both glad to part for a while.
That makes John stop grinning for a moment. He looks at me seriously, and I can see several thoughts crossing his mind, but not one of them makes it all the way to his lips. He does this endearing thing with his upper lip and his forehead, and then finally says, “Will you love her?”
And out of training. Sleep deprivation and undernourishment had left their traces, he hated to admit. Sherlock seemed to be unaware of his panting, or maybe he was just ignoring it. Didn't matter, anyway.
“Mrs Hudson,” I yell. Hasn't she said something about spare packing cases? Fourteen holes in the shelf. Most of the books just looking like the old ones. Mere covers. If I hurry, I can have the bookshelf empty and out of the flat in the afternoon.
Let me take a moment to thank all of you for reading and commenting and giving kudos and stuff. You always make me feel extremely grateful.<3
He nods again, with a little, honest smile on his lips and in his eyes.
I wake up because I am crying so hard that my pillow is wet and I am choking on saliva and tears.
and then my body hits the ground. (How?) The rope is removed. (Impossible!) I gasp and retch and breathe (Another game? God, no!) and don't open my eyes because I couldn't stand seeing her. A hand on my head, soft. Caring.
It is an awkward embrace, but with his left hand in my hair and his right pressing against my back, and with my cheek gently leaning against his, it is perfect.
“What memory?”
After a while, Daddy joins me (unobtrusively). He sits down next to me and pretends to be incredibly occupied with reading a German newspaper. I cannot help but smile (a little).
I keep drifting in and out of sleep, unable to stay awake.
And then we hit the ground, only for a second, and are bounced up again. We are weightless for a moment which feels strangely good. The plane slowly (can't be slowly but feels like it) descends again, and the next ground touching is not soft but brutal. I am pushed against the limits of my straining seat belt, metal screeches, I am thrown back into my seat, the plane still moves forward, there is pain somewhere but I cannot say where and I lose all sense of direction and I need to maintain the emergency position -
“That's flattering,” John admitted, “but why did you ...” That earned him another “John, please”-glance. “Flattering? Apparently your mediocre middle class childhood has prevented you from ever living a house that is big enough to have wings.” Now was he getting compliments or was he being insulted? John kind of lost track, but Sherlock seemed far from noticing and would continue talking anyway.
“She was in Magnussen's office to threaten or kill him,” Sherlock explained softly. “I don't know why. She was wearing a professional assassin's outfit, but had not covered her face. When I offered to help with whatever it was that drove her there, she shot me.”
He cries real tears up on that roof, knowing his next step will separate him from John for a long time. Sentiment is merely a chemical defect, he knows. Yet, he also knows that he can not stop loving John. He hesitates, already knowing that he will not be able to cope with being cut off from John. He listens to his voice on the phone, sees him standing down there, and hesitates.
“You are safe,” I say and watch his body relax. He needs some time before being awake enough to open his eyes.
John allowed himself to relax a little. Stopping Sherlock from pulling all kinds of tubes out of his body had been terrible. This time, he only reached for his mouth, as if searching for something.
Then Sherlock's voice became desperate. “I love you,” he repeated again and again, “Don't be dead, John, please. I love you. I love you!”
He is also there when I am finally allowed to take a shower and wear my own clothes afterwards. It is amazing how you feel different with trousers and a proper shirt. I feel like myself for the first time in ages. I feel finally brave enough to talk about the most important issue.
Sherlock closes his eyes when John reaches out to touch his face, for seeing him AND feeling him  would be simply too much to handle. So he just feels, feels these soft fingers slowly caressing his face, floating from his forehead to his cheekbones to his ears before cupping his face. He feels John's thumb gliding over his upper lip, then over his lower lip, and it is the most erotic thing someone has ever done to his face.
The last thing I realize is Mummy grinning a little. It has been a trap. All those wrong deductions, all the little errors. They have all been traps to lure me into talking. Doesn't she know that people get hurt when I speak? But she knows. She made fun of it. Then why did she lure me into speaking?
He wished he could tell Sherlock he was fine, but shouldn't Sherlock deduce that anyway? But instead of relaxing, Sherlock tensed visibly. “John, I ...” he tried again, and stopped. And before John could fully process it, Sherlock had stood up and uttered, “I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't.”
John stares at a point on the wall behind me for a while. Then he takes another big gulp of wine himself. "Because of you," he says.
John's face is twisted with pain now. He looks questioningly at Sherlock. “Poison?” he asks.
John blinked, trying to keep up with the twists of Sherlock's vulnerable mind. “Well, yes, I ...” he started, but Sherlock cut in almost instantly: “I mean, I still fail to understand how someone can love me. I know some people regard me as attractive, I've been using that regularly, but love me? How could you have known something as absurd as that?”
We look at each other for a moment. He nods (sadly). "I had to go," he whispers after some time.
“Oh please, dear,” Janine smiles sweetly, “don't worry. If I had had any intentions of making you pay for what you did to Jimmy you would have paid already.” She goes to Mary and gives her a friendly hug, “Oh my, you are VERY pregnant now.” Then her eyes fall onto one of the laptops. There is (real? Surely not. Very well faked) realisation on her face, “Oh Mikey, you were working on that clip already. Did you think it was meant for Sherl?”
Fascinating how you do not stop wondering how the husband-to-be is feeling now, even though he broke your heart utterly and completely only yesterday. Despite the many past cases that indicated something else, Sherlock feels no need to hit him back, to take revenge or to hurt him as deeply as he has hurt Sherlock.
It turns out that this Book is a very effective life insurance. Containing extremely valuable information on the criminal upper class, it is stored at a reliable notary. Should Janine not die of natural causes, parts of it will be published, exposing several secrets that should better be left in the dark.
Sherlock spends hours and hours to figure out which of these he loves the most and fails in the end. He simply loves the whole package. What a peculiar notion!
It is only in the end when his voice finally breaks.
John nods once more. His whole body tells me he wants to say more (clenching his hands, pursing his lips, keeping his back erect) so I wait as patiently as I can. I am sure he wants to say sorry.
“And just when I convinced myself that someone was imitating his voice, I received a video clip,” she goes on, and now it becomes obvious that behind her flirtatious easy-going façade she really is scared. “Sherl, it was him. But … older. Some new wrinkles, a few grey streaks. Seeing him was …“ She is clearly fighting for composure now. (And I can no longer resist the urge to help. She was right at the hospital, we could have been friends. Well, maybe it is not too late for that.)
Then, one rainy April night, the boring routine was broken up rather dramatically. A text from “Mary” had told John that his hunt had brought Sherlock to Madrid (“Honestly, why not just admit that it is a greenhouse? A train station is where TRAINS are.”), and John had envied his friend for being active while he himself was forced to a life of uninspired boredom.
His eyes are searching my face with sympathy, his expression is open. How am I supposed to continue being hurt when he resembles my old John so much? I sigh, and to my surprise he grins a little. (Important. Need to ask him why later!)
Her comment does something funny to my body. On the one hand, the thought of shagging John (Lord, has it really been that long?) sends a wave of arousal through my loins, leaving a burning feeling I can barely ignore. The thought of someone believing it to me marginal, on the other hand, sends a cold shiver through my chest. Both feelings mix in my belly and the result renders me immobile.
“Or look at me,” she continues. “All the pain I suffered because I love you.” Love, not loved. Good. The more she loves John, the safer he will be.
“I don't want to talk to you,” he says when Sherlock answers his old smartphone, “so you have to do the talking.” And for once, Sherlock obeys. He talks about how he faked his death, how he was secretly relocated after the fall, how he revenged Moriarty's network, he talks and talks.
I am sure he does. This is why he is watching me closely as I look around. The view to the beach is breathtaking. You can see the sea in the distance behind the dunes, hear the waves hitting the shore. It was low tide one hour ago and you can watch the high tide rolling in again.
John is painfully aware of Sherlock's earth-shattering sexiness. Sherlock is not. He is also totally unaware of the effect he has on John.
Sorry about the cliff hanger.
“Sherlock,” John said again. He was way too weak to be polite now. All he wanted was Sherlock by his side and some peace of mind. Soon. So he bluntly went on, “Why did you leave?”
It takes twenty-eight minutes to make Mrs Hudson come upstairs, look at my laptop and understand what I want. (Opening tabs on your laptop is not really communication, right?) It takes another thirty-two minutes for her to make the necessary phone calls and fifteen minutes for me to pack all I need (not much). Eighteen minutes cab ride to the car rental service (a mini cooper, because daddy's cars were always too small for us back then), and five minutes between signing the contract (signing is not communication either, right?) and starting to drive out of town.
Still, at the end of August, all in all he had too much time at hand, and so he let his mind wander. Thinking back to the funeral, for example. Held without public announcement, without any member of the press, but with a huge amount of homeless and a very marginal number of friends and family.
For some reason I wish the plane would finally start to speed towards the ground.
Now, at noon, I still don't have a good excuse. John is wearing his soldier face. I won't be able to use one of my usual strategies to avoid answering. Only way out now is to play down the importance of it. Put on my best acting face. Make my voice sound slightly flippant.
“I could tell you about it,” he says.
And then something changes. His body straightens and the expression in his face …
Mary thinks that John would get over Sherlock faster if he wrote him a letter. John still does not want to get over Sherlock, but he does not want to argue with Mary either, so he meanders once more. Writing a letter feels wrong, and after three failed attempts, he writes an e-mail.
Apparently there is something wrong with our fireplace, for it must have been the smoke that made my eyes stingy. When I was finished talking, John was quiet for a long time. His eyes were also affected by the smoke from the fireplace it seemed.
(3) Fact was, Moran had been very close to Sherlock, lost that closeness due to a mistake he had made (given you could call killing more than five innocent people merely a “mistake”). (4) Fact was, John was as close to Sherlock now as Moran once had been. These facts made both (a) and (b) equally tempting goals.
Really for her?
When Sherlock had not moved for more than thirty minutes, John got up and lit the fire Sherlock and Mary had been clumsily trying to light before. It was getting dark outside, and the fire's soft glow made Sherlock's face look soft and warm. There was still a frown on his face, but there were also wrinkles that hadn't been there when they had met. Laughter lines around his eyes. Was he happy with his life?
He walks up and down for a while. Then he sighs. Then he shakes his head.
“He ...” I start, not sure how to end that thought.
But why did he think so low of himself? Curiously, Sherlock went on to navigate blindly through this talk, “Apparently you are not. You are a wonderful father and a loving husband.” Something was happening in John's face, but Sherlock couldn't identify it. So instead he continued, “You are the best best friend anyone could have and ...
“Well,” I say, doing my best to sound unimpressed, “you have done your homework concerning me. Did you also find time to investigate on the plane crash that happened yesterday?”
and saw -
Mary looked down at him. “Idiot,” she said and leaned over the corpse to kiss the guard passionately.
The scene cuts to a man from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the government. He is wearing a neon yellow high-visibility vest, the letters AAIB bold on his back. In that scene, it is already dark. He is standing in front of the wreck, looking at the ground. The camera swings around and shows him from the side.
“I love you,” I blurt out.
“I' will need the texts and the letters.” I say, and she starts to work on her mobile instantly. Good girl. “And you will have to send me that video.”
(Had John felt the same when he left? I suspect him to be in Scotland, but am not sure. He has not sent a single sign of life since he left Baker Street.)
The fourth day is nearly identical. I have breakfast. Calculate the bricks in the wall and delete the result. Have lunch. Forecast the weather. Do my workout. Take a shower. Mycroft shows up again. He brings along Stratego again. We play four matches. I win the last. He leaves. I have dinner. Go to bed. Lie awake until a restless sleep overpowers me. I don't speak.
I get dizzy and realize that I am holding my breath.
That is when I make the inexcusable mistake.
In it, John tells Mycroft to clear off and stop using CCTV cameras to follow him. He also tells him how guilty he feels about Sherlock's death, and Sherlock is struck when he reads it. There is pain in it, and desperation and grief.
He travels from China to Canada so often it feels like merely commuting.
After the extended visit with the Stamfords, she will be agitated for they always give her too much sweets and spoil her even more than we do. So our plan for today and tomorrow is to stay at home, go to the park maybe, and take it slow. Watching those clown fish again might be inevitable. Better than watching the funny pig family rolling on the floor laughing or Norman Price doing something stupid yet again.
She is as surprised as I am. She fusses over how thin I am and how sad I look and feeds me. She asks me many clever questions about the Moriarty Enigma. She shares some of her herbal soothers with me, and soon we are both lying on her carpet, listening to her swing records. I tell her at length how much I love John and why, and she pats my hand and my back and my cheek. She is so much better at that than I am.
There is nothing more I can do. John's fingers are still slack, his head still lolled to his chest. He is merely unconscious.
“Thought it best to retreat before someone could force me to dance.” Put as much disdain into the last word as possible.
I sit down on my favourite bench, the one where I opened up the letters to our older selves months ago. It seems like a lifetime ago. I close my eyes, tune out the waves and the birds and will up the sound of London early morning traffic, muffled by the old walls of Baker Street.
The call that had pulled me out of my disturbing dreams is repeated. Why did I sleep so long? Memories are crawling back slowly. Case. First one in nineteen weeks. Closed room mystery. Never been able to resist. Wish I had.
(pretending not to be surprised? too late for that even John must have recognised, pretend to be only slightly amused? No, inappropriate considering John had apparently contacted Mycroft which is always unpleasant and had hurried to Spain out of worry, show happiness and leave out relief? No, John wouldn't buy it after the phone call, show only relief and leave out happiness? No, would leave John disappointed)
The next important thing of course was finding out if Sherlock knew who had done that to him, but when it came to Sherlock, John would always be doctor first. And doctor John Watson could not bring himself to ask a traumatised patient about being shot into the chest three minutes after waking up from being in a coma for fifteen days.
All I can do is nod, and let go of his cock so I can embrace him, press his body against mine, feel his invincibility diffusing into every cell of my body. His energy is recharging me, and suddenly I can feel it too. Joy fills my soul, and I have to release some of it through my mouth or I would explode. I kiss him, wildly, not bothering that our teeth clash, and John kisses back, gets hold of my hair with his hand, holds me in place, sucks at my mouth, and we both get wet with pre-come.
Then his brain slowly, slowly took in the entirely unexpected scene.
Of course he was right. I pocket his letter and carefully open mine. It is addressed to me anyway.
They instantly detect the strange mood between John and me, the weird mixture of relief, catharsis, and something dark still lurking behind us. But because they are brilliant, they find the right way to help us without mentioning it: They pretend to have missed Emmi so much that they insist on spending the day with her while John and I can do as we please.
Serves me right, John thought when he subtly struggled for balance after being pulled into the fierce hug. You can't surprise two Holmes' a day without being surprised at least once in return. When he realised that Sherlock would not let him go any time soon, he gracefully settled into the hug and started rubbing his friend's back a little. Damn, he DID miss him.
Does obnoxious odour stop him from jumping into obscure fluid to save Sherlock from drowning? (no, but what idiot jumps into a cesspit just to solve an case first place, knowing he is a non-swimmer?)
I pull him even closer, press my cheek against his hair and refuse to let him go for thirty-eight minutes. After some time, he stops trembling, and in the end, his body relaxes against mine.
Banned from Harrod's. Apparently parental wrath is inversely proportional to children's age.
I don't know.
So that night, when Emmi is (finally) sleeping in her cot I do not go back into the kitchen to join the rest of my little family. Instead I sit down in my room, start my laptop and check John's blog. There (still) is my entry made during his honeymoon, then a short part on Moriarty being really dead and an announcement of Emmi's birth as well as a lovely description of our life as a family of three. (Hard to read without getting heavy-hearted once more.). The last entry was made a few days before Mycroft's death.
That memory makes me stop in front of the door now, hand resting on the handle.
“I love the ending the most. It always makes me smile,”John goes on, apparently not willing to dwell on it in silence. Like the rest of the letter, Sherlock of course knows the ending by heart.
"But only ..." Mummy interrupts him and blushes. They exchange one of the looks they use to exchange whenever their sons were involved.
So we share a secret. Have a common goal. Renewed the bond that was once there.
More often than not I wake up in my bed alone. We always go to sleep together, me leaning against any part of John I can get hold on, but when I wake up he is always gone. After the first time I looked at him questioningly, and he told me that he woke up way too early and didn't want to disturb me.
"How was he?" I finally ask. I do not dare to voice the actual question, "Do you think he will kill himself, now that he is completely alone?"
Somewhere, in the mostly unexplored back of his mind, a very little gear started to turn. All those dreams he had, during his coma, the entire simulation of what would be, everything he had made up in his mind had lacked one thing: smell. He had not smelled the air inside the plane, not the dirt on the street of old Baker Street, not Mary's perfume when she had died.
“I have waited for this moment for so long,” Sherlock said in his mind instead, “And now I am scared to ruin it.”
Sherlock replays the scene in his head later. Then he imagines John pulling rank on him. He stares at his pre-come-erection in amazement. Never had imagination triggered such a reaction from his body. Pre-orgasmic fantasies have not been something he had conjured up until that day.
The most horrific day of my life. One day before that one has been the most horrific of his life, I suppose. I've always been a bit slower than him with things like that.
There is no dramatic breaking point, only Rosie demanding that I play her favourite tunes on the violin. I try and explain why I am unable to do so but she keeps on demanding, again and again, and then she cries because she does not understand that you cannot play with a broken wrist.
But do those souls really need to remain unknown? Surely there must be documents of their ships that report someone missing. If one would compare the worldwide records of missing sailors with ocean lanes, the ocean current at that time and the weather ...
Inside the car, John grabs my hand wordlessly.
For a moment, Sherlock's mind blanked out. He should find a solution. He should find a way out. He should come up with a plan, but the thought of John dying was unbearable, and he could no longer think at all.
But more became obvious to him: Sherlock compassionately watching Sebastian first punching John in the face, then treating him with increasing violence. Sebastian hitting John so hard that the chair keeled over. Sebastian kicking John's ribs, breaking more than one in the process. Sherlock's jaw clinching in pain while watching it. Sherlock's eyes widening when a fierce kick to the head made John lose consciousness again.
Mycroft gives me a sad little smile, “Of course he does, little stupid brother.”
At the hospital we are both examined thoroughly, our blood is taken, our blood pressure measured, John's statement is written down and finally finally we are alone in a hospital room.
He felt silent, just watched Sherlock for a few minutes, wondering if his friend could stop now if he wanted to. “I'm not leaving,” he quietly stated after an eternity. “Yes, you are.” Sherlock didn't even look at him. Didn't even hesitate for a second.
He gives me an uncomprehending look, “Why?” He thinks about it for a moment, then goes on, “Didn't they say he was the best in aviation accidents?”
After thirty minutes Sherlock is close to hysteria. His heart is beating so hard Sherlock is sure it is hazardous to his health and they are still too far away from home. “Hang on,” he tells himself, but knows that he will not listen. He plays with the wristbands of the hoodie he wears as a disguise, tearing the seam apart.
Before John can answer, another nurse comes and pushes us first into an elevator, takes us to the casualty ward and into another room. A standard four-bed hospital room.
(knew Seb was observing us one way or another, probably the camera in the kitchen I couldn't match to someone yet)
“Aaaasss”, Emi answers.
“What are you up to?” John asks her. Did she recognise the slight waver of his voice? Does she realise that he is beginning to be scared for me? Hard to tell. She is controlled again, her face not giving away much.
“Mycroft thinks that he found out about fifty percent of her past. The rest is hidden so well even he couldn't get to it.” Not good. In my mind, I correct my assessment of her. Not just a paid assassin. Someone much higher up on the criminal ladder. Someone with enough resources to hide something from my brother. Moriarty had not been able to do that.
His voice trails off, leaving much space for interpretation. I wonder if I should tell him how I felt today, left out and cut off of information. Before I can make up my mind, he goes on, “I … missed you at the hospital. I know it is not fair, and Mary has no idea what's going on, and she is the mother, and it will break her heart, but … she can't have my girl, Sherlock. She is evil and she has killed … she is … she will never … I am scared and … you know.”
The day of Mycroft's death.
He dreams about the funeral, only this time he does not stand motionless. Instead, he goes to the coffin and touches it. Starts tapping on it with his fingers. During the dream it makes perfect sense, but when John wakes up it no longer does. He does not understand what he has done. Maybe, he thinks, he has been tapping a message in Morse code on Sherlock's coffin. Which makes absolutely no sense, because Sherlock is dead and why should John send him a message?
It will be more than sex, and we both know it. It will be healing.
In my mind, I conjure Mary next to my bedside. Turn her around, look for all the clues I have  overlooked so far. The control she has over her facial expressions. (Used so subtly that I missed it. Not just a liar. An experienced one. A professional one.) The gap in her past, starting five years ago. (And the small gaps in her recent life. More than I wanted to see before. Several trips with an unclear destination. A job that does not pay for the clothing she has in her wardrobe.) Brilliant fine motor skills. Come in handy as a nurse. (And as an assassin.) The way she uses to make sure John and I spent time together. (Giving her free time as well. To do what? Remember her face, her bearing afterwards. Too controlled, hiding something.) The love in her eyes when looking at John.
His hair was all curly now. He hated it. John would love it. He had an obscure soft spot for product-free Sherlock-hair for whatever reason.
In another one, Sherlock sits at Mycroft's diner table with John, both of them watching his brother wearing a crown for some reason, consuming lots of cake, custard, chicken, cheese, candy and celery and becoming corpulent. John mentions the fact that Mycroft might blow up, and they laugh so hard it annoys the hell out of fat Mycroft. That is it.
(See the end of the chapter for
that he was startled when someone knocked at the door: “Room service.”
Before I can respond accordingly, she informs me, “We are done talking. I'll hang up now!” She blows me a kiss and the line is broken.
“Where are you hurt?”
(See the end of the chapter for
In real life, John had never turned away from Sherlock. He had never abandoned him at Emilia Ricoletti's grave. He had never forgiven Mary. He had never beaten Sherlock so violently that Sherlock needed to be hospitalised.
He has to guide Sherlock to bed, not an easy task, as John himself is not completely sober. A statement that holds a certain under-exaggeration. They sway up the stairs clinging to each other and Sherlock is dropped into bed rather unceremoniously. He falls asleep within seconds, mumbling something incomprehensible. Probably about Hobbits. The sight of Sherlock on a bed sobers John enough to contemplate his life.
John looked at the marble wall that had been opened with sheer force. Sherlock had just thrown a superficial look at the site a few moments before. “This must have been extremely loud. Is this why the security team came in?” “Well, no,” Mandini admitted “but that's not a surprise. Actually, just like the residents, the security team has been informed by a faked ministerial letter that there would be some disturbances at night due to construction works at the piazza.” He reached inside his pocket and fished out a very formal looking piece of writing. “Barry, over here,” John shouted, wanting Sherlock to have at least a look at it.
Then, times flies again, and before John really knows what is happening, he is sitting in a cheap hospital chair, waiting for the neural surgery to be over, and then John is sitting in another cheap hospital chair by Sherlock's bedside, overseeing him day and night, wondering if he will ever wake up again or not, and then John is sitting in the same cheap hospital chair, softly talking Sherlock through his recovery, and then they are back home again, two weeks later.
“We really need to see such a spa soon,” John says. Well, he nearly says that. His speech is still slurred but Sherlock's brain is almost able to ignore that. Then John sobers.
He embraces me, careful but strong. I do not know how long we are standing like that for my brain fails to count the minutes. It does not matter anyway. Funny how I always feel completely safe and wrapped up in his arms, with him being so much smaller than me.
At that, all his anger erupts. He pushes my arm away, more forcefully than necessary. It hits me by surprise. (Stupid me!) Before I can help it, his push sends me off the planks and into the sand.
"Take it easy," he heard John say. "Everything is all right."
Eternal thanks to the best three betas in the world, and thanks to all who are reading, commenting, subscribing and / or leaving kudos. Hope you've had a wonderful Christmas time.
Oh how he longed to be as miserable on the outside as he was on the inside but the weather did not appear to be cooperative.
Now all I have to do to safeguard John's unborn child is conceal my plan from the man I love, deceive his wife, outsmart my brother, probably have my parents drugged and conduct the deal I made with the devil.
This is not about THE INCIDENT anyway. If it were, I could point out to John that I have already repented.
(See the end of the chapter for
In front of him, on the coffee table, there is a two page print-out. Sherlock's email to Mary. Attached to his carefully collected list of twenty points to ensure John's happiness in the incapable hands of Mary Morstan there is a post-it. “How to handle S. Holmes” is written on top of it, and at the bottom it reads “Handle with care!”, not in John's hardly legible doctor's handwriting but in his love letter and shopping list handwriting.
The one thing I deduced when meeting her the first time. And she is a good one, it later turned out.
From the living-room I can still hear Rosie chanting for a while before she falls asleep as well.
Really, that is what concerns him most? Well, at least the answer to that is easy, “Yesterday night.”
I cannot answer but that is all right too. I simply nod, and his face bursts into a smile. Because he does not just love me. He knows me, and he understands me, and he belongs to me. Because he no longer is the almost broken man who arrived on Amrum two months ago.
It cannot be due to the fact that the naked victim is tied to the bed with purple plush handcuffs. It cannot be due to the fact that John's corners of the mouth twitch upward a little at the sight of the used pink preservative lying on the ground, telling a tale of penetration and lust. Only in a very pink way.
John's expression barely changed. He was suppressing a grin, Sherlock could tell, but did it really well. “Well,” John said, doing his best to sound serious, “I could kiss you instead, but see, I have already survived a knife attack today AND made tea. I really think it's your turn now.”
I stare at it for a while and allow myself to contemplate all that we have lost and are beginning to regain. Then I take a deep breath, hack into his blog, open a new document for drafts and start writing about our work on the unknown sailors.
I invite us all to my parents' home for Christmas. To John's surprise, Mary willingly agrees to come along. Mummy predictably forces Mycroft to come as well, not knowing of course that his presence is the key to the success of my plan. (His presence, and that of his laptop of course.)
Mycroft did not bother to help. Instead he explained, “It was almost impossible to trace her back. Miss Wilson had woven an extremely elegant web of camouflage tactics. That explains how she managed to pass my security check after your first date.” He hesitated, if only for a second, before he went on, “That's an explanation but not an excuse. My deepest apologies for not realising what was going on under my nose.”
“Maybe,” he carefully agrees.
He gets up (as gracefully as one can inside a cramped slippery shower cabin), reaches for the shampoo (his, apparently knowing I love the smell of his hair), kneels down again and starts to apply it to my hair. Well, apply. It is more of a massage, really, and I cannot stop myself from humming.
“Are you all right?” he asks. I stick to the simple one times means yes, two times means no code and tell him that yes, I am fine. (No need to let him know how scared I've been, right?)
On the way to the kitchen, my eyes fall onto the bookshelf in the living room. Still fourteen books missing. Difficult to replace. Takes me longer than I thought. Remember how in the beginning I had superstitiously believed that he would return as soon as I have replaced all books that were beyond repair. Once the old state is restored. Now I hope I was wrong.
There are no fireworks at midnight (too many houses with thatched roofs), so we miss the beginning of the new year. But we both know that we started the year in each others' arms. It is so much more that I hoped for.
And how Jim would surely use John's life to put the necessary pressure on Sherlock. How most unfortunately Mycroft had realized that Sherlock was not likely to survive the blow John's death would deal him. And how Mycroft had therefore threatened to stop helping his little brother if he would tell John about their plan to fake Sherlock's death. How Sherlock had had to wait for the bug in this room to break down, giving them one surveillance-free night to plan everything without Mycroft's knowledge, given that they would whisper low enough not to be picked up by the bug in the corridor.(The only alternative had been finding a reason to take a shower together or some other activity inside the bathroom, and John had been really happy that Sherlock decided against that.)
“What if … “ he starts again. Purses his lips once more. Clenches his hands once more. Is about to say something seriously important.
In the end, there are four people left. Four potential culprits. All with very different motives.
“Don't worry, she will be in prison by then,” I do my best to reassure her.
“Good morning, boys” she says cheerfully and goes on, “Still a bit early in the morning, but I had the most wonderful time at a lovely little night club in Romford just an hour ago.”
Romina Vendosso, the victim of the mafia gunshot. “Sister alcoholic” This was bad.
He didn't look at her, because he would never want her to be the last thing he saw. Keeping his eyes fixed on John, he steeled himself for the final gunshot.
Apparently not a good topic. John freezes, then leaves without a word. When he returns (after forty-three minutes, breathing hard, wet from the rain, with dirt on his shoes that tells me how fast he has walked and hence how angry he has been) he shouts at me, then leaves the sitting room to make tea (in a really angry fashion that I must admit is as arousing as it is frightening), then finally finally ends up on the sofa with his head on my lap.
Instead I let him continue talking. “Mickey was such a content child when it was feeding time. A bottle of milk, a burp cloth, that was all we needed. But feeding you has always been some kind of challenge,” he says, and I have to laugh a little.
A final spasm shaking her body
“Let's carry the pushchair over it. We are alone here anyway,” he says and freezes when I do not start moving.
Mycroft stays for another hour. Tells me he is already negotiating to turn my imprisonment into some kind of service to the crown, but so far Serbia is the only alternative. I wonder if I really deserve something else.
but didn't take his eyes off John, their gazes locked again.
Now, with the plane damaged and my stomach doing strange things, I wish I had been more insistent about this talking thing. I mentally write it onto the to-do-list that is hanging at the office of my mind palace.
For a second, Sherlock thinks that John is asleep and feels shamefully glad about not having to face him right now. Then John turns his head, sees Sherlock and smiles. “Sherlock,” he says groggily.
I open it (with trembling hands) and my glance falls onto the most beautiful violin I have ever seen. Older than my old one, more delicate. A lot more expensive. The wood feels almost warm beneath my fingers, the bow is lying in my hand like it was made only for me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now you understand why Mycroft had put you to the test in the warehouse.” John nodded thoughtfully. “I always thought I had passed that test,” he said. “Oh, but you didn't. You failed, and failed spectacularly. When Mycroft realised how loyal you were after just a few hours, how determined, how brave... All those weak little traitors that had moved in with me over the years had never bothered him. But with you, he instantly increased the surveillance at the flat to a maximum.”
Then John stretches his neck and kisses me. Powerful, demanding. Owning. His tongue is slipping into my mouth without any hesitation, without consideration. He wants, and he translates all that desire into that kiss.
Will she go after Mrs Hudson? Molly or Lestrade? Unlikely. Need to warn them anyway, but what good will it do? You cannot hide from a good sniper, no matter what you do.
“Better get laid soon, it won't be long until you'll hurt him so much he'll go away,” my inner Mary purrs while John is kissing me on the sofa in October. I close my eyes as hard as I can, concentrate on where John's hands are right now and what his tongue is doing to my ear lobe right now and wish she were wrong.
I finally drive home to find Mummy working on the unknown sailors once more. When she deduces my state of mind, she definitely doesn't cry with relief secretly while preparing dinner.
Thank you for everybody who read on anyway. I'll do my best to hurry a little. Probably have my pupils working quietly a lot so I can sketch the next chapter. :-)))
Concentrating on Farnsworth is difficult. Especially after I deduced that she is innocent. Took me eight minutes. But she keeps on talking. Tells me something about honour among thieves and really believes in it. When she asks me if she is boring me, I say yes.
To my surprise, he just gives me a sad smile, “I know.”
I am so close to coming that I am holding my breath and John pushes and pushes and my body is prickling and my skin is raw and I can hear he is close so close and so am I and he pushes and pushes and his hand is hot on my cock and my vision is disturbed for I see black dots dancing and he pushes and I need to kiss him and I stretch my neck so our lips meet again and it is uncomfortable and his tongue touches mine and think I am screaming into his mouth when my body is pushed over the edge and I am pulsating and pulsating and John is moaning and something hot is filling me now my head jerks and he breaks the kiss to breathe.
And then I am pushed forward again with brutal force. There is an eerie second of silence before my world drowns in blackness.
We are both holding the line. My mouth opens and closes a few times. I don't find the words I would need now. After some agonising moments, Daddy takes the phone out of my hand.
Then his eyes roll back into his head and he moans. In the distance, I can hear the siren of an ambulance.
I am torn between being happy because I will not see John die and being horrified because John will watch me die.
While that plot is conducted, we will need to find out who really broadcast the clip and why. There is a list of twenty-six potential enemies, combined with thirteen possible motives. I cannot help but find the task ahead intriguing. Very soon I am fully innolved, following Mycroft's fast-pacing thoughts, trying to bring in my own ideas before he can think of them himself, my mind racing. I am high on adrenaline and brilliance.
He watched Sherlock even more closely now.
My voice is sounding strange now, vulnerable and childlike. I hate myself like that. John doesn't.
Now that I understand where I am, I can sit up with some effort. It makes me dizzy. Around me, people start to moan. Somewhere, a child is crying.
John heroically pretended to ignore the tears in Sherlock's eyes.
A young man, barely twenty, crying with pain.
He hides in cellars, cavities, empty houses, train wagons, one time even in a crevice somewhere in Alaska, chilled to the bones by the cold northern summer rain. He spends the time with making plans for the future. No, that word is too small, for the future he has in mind for John and himself. He develops, he creates plans for the future. They are glorious and exciting and strangely domestic.
I am at a loss for words now myself, so I simply nod in return. We continue sitting there, side by side, the way we were always meant to be. We don't touch, though. I am longing, desperately longing to hold his hand but I am scared that might break the spell of this peaceful, open moment.
Sherlock had spent a surprisingly high amount of time with John in hospital, coming from London four or five times a week, usually by a helicopter Mycroft had organised using God knows which sources.
John fumbled with his keys before he managed to open the door to his house as he always did. It was dark inside, and quiet. He sighed when he turned on the lights. There were no signs of a fight. Mycroft's team must have taken Mary by surprise, or they cleaned up afterwards.
It seems like a lifetime ago that he wrote that letter. But then, here in the purgatory of hospitalness, even having breakfast that morning seems like a lifetime ago. And how wrong he had got John in that respect. He had seriously thought it would be advisable for Mary to take an A level in Algebra to talk to him about aberrations or something.
The touch if his (cool) hands against my (hot needing) erection only intensifies the burning. Spreads it. I moan silently. Slowly, very very slowly (but strong) John pulls back my foreskin, as far as possible. Then he applies pressure, squeezes, does not let go. That does not relieve any tension at all, only makes me want it more. My legs go rigid and my head falls back. I'm sweating already.
The third day is nearly identical. I have breakfast. Calculate the bricks in the wall and delete the result. Have lunch. Forecast the weather. Do my workout. Take a shower. Mycroft shows up again. He brings along Stratego again. We play six matches. I lose every single time, but it is a lot closer now. He leaves. I have dinner. Go to bed. Lie awake until a restless sleep overpowers me. I don't speak a single word.
About Mrs Hudson picking up Deb from the babysitter and taking her to Baker Street with her.
Mummy and Daddy will ... I cannot even think about it. But they will. And it will be my fault.
John watched her leave, and closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, he knew exactly what to do next.
She greets Janine just as cordially and gives me the warmest smile I have ever received (besides when John smiles at me) and starts chatting about the Miss Me video and what a terrible person Jesterton is. Tells me that unfortunately she does not know anything about it at all (genuine regret). When I cannot help but sigh at that, she hugs me again. “I am really sorry, Sherlock,” she tells me, and means it. Probably due to the crush on me Janine mentioned before.
“Um...and... he took the money from the cash box and...” “What money?” “Excuse me?” Pezzutto squealed. He now seemed like he was close to fainting. Hopefully Mycroft's involvement meant lots of money for him, for he surely deserved it.
That is true. I can see it in his eyes. Have deduced it before I left him, too. Unfortunately, no matter what Inner Mycroft might think, I don't know if I can heal John's soul. But there is one thing I can do for sure.
After some time, we hear the sirens of two ambulances as well as the arrival of several cars. (can't tell how many, but anyway.) John only moves away from me when gently forced by the paramedics.
From: Sherlock Holmes
John smiles a bit smugly, which suits him perfectly, and takes a mouthful himself. When he puts down the glass again he frowns. “What - “ he murmurs. Then he looks at Sherlock. He is more confused than alarmed.
I am sorry. I really am. But I promise that this will be the last mean cliffhanger.
In the end, he refrains from killing Molly. Instead, he tries to smile when she provides him with a Snickers even though he does not have any appetite at all.
He was surprised at how much he could love this little bundle, all eyes and thick black hair, at first sight. He was surprised how good it felt to be admired by the five-year old boy who clearly stated that he wanted to be exactly like Mycy when he grew up. He had been surprised at how much the seven-year old boy needed him when their father died, leaving them to the well-protected, yet unloving life with Mummy.
Sherlock did not react. Instead, his moaning grew louder. His head was twitching as if he was trying to pull himself out of the nightmare but he did not wake up.
Of course it was. No message from John, saying he was sorry. No call from John, saying he was sorry. Nothing.
There is a scan of the baby. John and I come along. Not easy to pretend that I will only be the child's eccentric uncle Sherlock. When we see it moving its arms I am so overwhelmed by what the future could hold for us that I involuntarily squeeze John's hand. I compensate the blunder by quickly grabbing Mary's hand and squeeze it as well.
Behind each point, John has drawn a little box. Both boxes are ticked.
It had been one sentence. Short and shouted in rage. Enough to make Sherlock flinch and lose control himself.
But John is a genius when it comes to them being a couple and his obviously telepathic abilities are stunning. His laboured smile becomes a real one and he pats Sherlock's chest, “Next time you want me to be occupied, you could just sprain an ankle or catch laryngitis, couldn't you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” he said, “I've got John!”
At the bottom of the stairs I hesitate. I simply cannot face the empty flat right now. So instead I knock on Mrs Hudson's door. Try to remember if I ever did that before, simply to enjoy her company. Surely not.
“She is fine,” I assure him.
One year later the two friends of Carol were found dead. They had been shot in the belly at short range. One of them had died instantly, the other one had lived for another three hours, slowly bleeding to death. Carol Sawyer had disappeared that day and had never been found.
and lie wide awake.
Our eyes lock, and I see serious fear in her eyes. “Promised,” I agree. I know how it feels to fear Mary. I know it perfectly well.
“Alas, John!” she says again and again. She mentions that John nearly died so often that Sherlock's chest starts hurting in a peculiar way. When he is sure that he has been nice for ample time, he starts commenting on the aerobics leotard she is wearing but not the ale she had last night.
“Fuck me,” I interrupt breathlessly, and he laughs.
“Yes,” John volunteers when I refuse (am unable) to answer, “We even told the flight attendant ab-”
John moves away from me a bit and looks at me. I can tell from his eyes he wants to make some funny remark to lighten the gravity of our situation, but then sees the expression on my face and swallows it instead.
And then there is no time to think about the past any longer. Pressure is building up inside of me, and fast. John's hand on mine is anchoring my mind, and his cock is hitting my prostate every time, and his face suddenly twists, and there is want and need and lust written all over his face and I have to gasp and I am sure that he is moaning even louder than me and something is building up inside me, hot and red.
Which is difficult because Harry starts sobbing the moment she sees John in his hospital bed.
The dreadful words had come out of the blue. Or hadn’t they?
John, on the other hand, is strangely reserved. (Trying not to lose control?) I try to take in all of their reactions at once. It is overwhelming. I have to stop before it becomes too much to stand.
“I will continue to try helping you out,” he promises on our way to the car, but his heart is not in it. He knows that course is lost.
The only thing that does not really fit in is John. He arranged all that, and yet he feels like an invader. I can tell that by the way he sits in his chair a bit too straight, a bit too close to the edge. His (lovely expressive) face shows the inner turmoil he is going through. His fingers are ...
Damn Mycroft. John should have been there, with Sherlock, the whole time. He should have been the one to kill that person. Forcing them to separate might protect John, but it obviously didn't protect Sherlock. Had Mycroft considered that, too? John doubted it. He eyed the clock once more. Their safe time was nearly over. “Sherlock, promise me not to do anything stupid tonight, will you? Sherlock?” But the line had already been disconnected.
(only Mycroft's deduction really, but no need to admit that, he's arrogant enough without me praising him)
I am left standing in the middle of the room without the slightest idea of what to do next.
John closed his eyes, but that proved to be a mistake. Ashkan's friendly face appeared again immediately. He sighed again, glad Sherlock had decided not to face him. To his surprise, he felt the other man leaning closer, actually resting his head against John's. “You're saying that time won't heal all the wounds, then?” John gave that a sad smile. “No, it won't.”
I really need to find him. I should shout his name but I am scared that I won't get an answer because he is -
John's concern for me is clearly visible on his face now. I look at him confidently, but he does not react. So I have to calculate the risk of speaking up to assure him that I will survive Mary's little kidnapping. What would he prefer, worrying about me or suffering from physical pain instead?Well, it's John, so the answer is clear.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can't,” he tried to sidestep the talking but John would have nothing of it.
“Mycroft,” John said, and he instantly started to analyse the subliminal message of the good doctor's call. He sounded worried about something. Interesting. He knew John despised him deeply since Sherlock's “death”, so every reason to call the remaining Holmes brother must be alarming, at least to John's simple mind. “You once said if I ever needed something I should call you...” John elaborated. “Indeed, it was at the funeral,” Mycroft replied, curious where this was leading. He had already made up five different explanations for the call and several alternative solutions to John's probable requests, but the actual reason hit him completely by surprise.
John is very careful not to scare me with a thoughtless, nightmare-triggering touch. Actually, he manages to get me off my trousers and my pants without touching the relevant part of my body at all.
Tomorrow I start working full-time again, with Baby Schmiezi and Mr Schmiezi staying at home. It is rather likely that the next chapters will take some time to come online.
I watch a man and a woman sneak to the toilette presumably to have sex there while their partners are having their drinks, unaware of what is going on. It influences my own plans for having sex with John there but to be honest, it is unlikely that he would agree to it anyway. He is kind of shy when it comes to having sex in public places. (A pity.)
So I try to be grateful instead of sad when he comes in and -
But she forgives him and is all compassionate and understanding. She says she knows what kind of loss John has suffered from. Only that she does not, of course. She knows about the friendship and the cases and the limping. But she knows nothing about the love. This may be the only things she has in common with Sherlock.
I am waiting for a nervous eruption but none happens. It is because protecting is part of who he is, I realise when he makes a swan dive to catch Emmi when she jumps off the sofa. All the time after the cellar he felt like he was no use, like he could not protect us anyway. And he was missing it. Missing it with every cell of his body.
Afterwards it had been almost impossible to discuss the whole affair again, only a few muttered sentences with their backs to the CCTV here, a hushed whisper in a very dark part of London there...It was incredible how tight Mycroft´s and Moriarty´s surveillance nets really were. So when it finally started, John had had to largely manoeuvre on instinct, but obviously, everything had worked out as well as expected.
- best friend loves adorable daughter to pieces
“I can't sleep,” John repeats stubbornly when I (chastely) undress him. I gently press him down onto the mattress. He is sound asleep even before his head hits the pillow.
“You don't have to,” I say softly, my voice harsh from not being used for nearly a week. I find the courage to turn around, look into his (still loving, sad) eyes. This breaks the last straw. I stumble into his (always open) arms, hide my face in his (soft) jumper. Feel him embracing me, steadily, then gently rocking me as I cry over the innocence I've lost the second the bullet hit Magnussen's brain, over the future John and I most likely will not have, over the baby I will not see grow up.
It is a little miracle, each and every time we are having sex, that I am able to survive the crossfire of feelings and sound and smell and emotion.
I receive a text. Mycroft. Benjamin Jesterton admitted that he was the one who tried to pretend Moriarty was still alive. Motive: unrequited love.
The way he kisses me changes instantly. What was a slow, satisfying kiss becomes something more raw, full of want and lust. He groans into my mouth, and I start to gasp. John being aroused is something I cannot resist.
It is all right for me to cry in a situation like that. I know that because John is crying too. We should probably get ourselves something to eat while waiting for the ambulance, or at least something to drink but neither one of us seems to feel like getting up. Instead, we remain huddled against each other.
I rise and he gets up too. Slowly like an old man. "Can't sleep," he murmurs, tongue heavy, words slurred, eyes half closed.
How could he put all that in words without ...
Or worse. I will not shoot Magnussen. He will contact some of the people looking for Mary (good people most likely, with good reasons to find her). They will decide to take revenge, killing not  Mary, but John instead. Collateral damage, just to make a point.
“Yes,” John answered, his voice almost not trembling, “but hearing it again, seeing you react to it somehow made it more real.”
"I'm sorry," he says gently and I shake my head. No need for him to be sorry. He tried. That is more than most people would have done.
One week in January John strained his ankle when he tripped over the laptop he had forgotten in front of his bed. He limped through his daily routine, wondering why everybody was THAT sympathetic for him. It took him three days to figure out that all people knowing him had naturally assumed that his psychosomatic limp had returned.
(Pain. Helplessness.)
Afterwards, John felt no regret at all. Just the liberating feeling of doing the right thing.
In April, he starts dating a lovely woman named Mary Morstan. She is everything Sherlock was not. She is not mad. She does not go missing all of sudden because there is a really interesting case  she forgot to tell John about. She does not macerate chopped off fingers in the kitchen sink. She is no mystery to John. She never asks John to masticate something to confirm an alibi.
“I always pretended to be annoyed when he disturbed my dates, you know?” John carried on, fighting down a completely unwanted wave of nausea. Yes, this needed to be over soon. Fortunately  it made him look only more wretched. “But in reality I've always hoped he just got into their way to have me completely for himself.” A statement that held a certain, if only small amount of truth. John was convinced that Sherlock had ruined a good deal of his dates to have John for himself, but only because he demanded John's help with catching a criminal, getting rid of Mycroft or fetching his mobile out of his pocket.
My tongue is inside his mouth, my hands are on his backside. I have missed him so much I feel like drowning right now. My whole body is pressing against his, and I love it, I love him so badly.
Will he still try and leave her with me dead? I don't know. (Breaks my heart.)
“A plane can easily land on one engine,” he says to calm us both down. An obvious fact. Yet, it feels nice to have him say it. I just nod.
One of the times I wake up again, John is looking at me thoughtfully. "What kind of danger are we talking about?" he asks, instantly continuing, "I mean, will she take me to the cleaner during the divorce? Or will she stab me in the back with our meat knife?"
John looked back at Mary and his eyes fell onto the knife she was holding in her hand. You could see his mind racing, the soldier in him searching for the best way out. ”Good,” he said then, ”explain. Why did you shoot him?”
Thanks to GoSherlocked, Katzedecimal and Grizzi. They beta faster than I can say "I love you".
His gaze is directed to the ocean again. His face does this funny thing where it expresses three emotions at once. In this case they are lassitude, realisation and hope.
“This is where we found you that summer when Mummy and I were done being idiots,” Daddy muses. “I always thought it was your favourite place around the house.”
Instead, Sherlock just stares at John, as if he is the most fascinating specimen in the world, something completely out of the ordinary, with his intense gaze, and then Sherlock smiles, one of his genuine smiles, and says, “You are so interesting!”, and John knows his anger won't stand a chance against Sherlock's love-driven curiosity. Damn.
(See the end of the chapter for
(It was easy to deduce that they think I am too thin. I try to sulk about being forced to eat but it is difficult to do a good sulking when you don't speak at all. Nobody notices that you are sulking. So I stop with it halfway and enjoy having my parents here instead.)
Davies went on very clinically which helped a lot. “There are some minor injuries like a rectus sheath haematoma where the bullet hurt the right rectus abdominis muscle. That will heal on its own, more or less. What really worries us, however, is your right phrenic nerve.”
The way to John's room is endless. Sherlock is sure Molly leads him in circles, for this God forsaken hospital can never be that big and all the walls look the same. The smell of antiseptic alcohol hurts his nose. The smell of diseases and deaths hurts his soul.
John's face shows the sturdy look it always gets when a crisis is ahead but not there yet. He is determined to face whatever challenge will come our way. “Planes can land on one engine,” he repeats but takes my hand and holds it tight. I am not really scared, so it must be to calm down himself.
“Do you want me to stay during your therapeutic sessions today?”
He yells at Sherlock for good five minutes and cannot remember what he has said afterwards. The words “idiot”, “emasculating” and “death” might have been used, but he is not sure. Then he pulls Sherlock into a careful embrace.
21st December
John tries to keep up his smile, but can barely look at me. What I want to do is take him in my arms and kiss him senseless, pressing our pelvises together and feel him getting hard right here in front of everyone. Or hide in his arms and cry like a little child, make him caress me and press those chaste little kisses on my face. Or just stand opposed to him and look into his wonderful eyes for hours, see his love for me shining through.
She was (the position of her head before it lolled to the side) looking into John's face (her eyes wide open) when she died.
He has a point there, and, what is more important, there is a warm glow in his eyes. He really thinks his present will make me happy. Well, then it surely will. Sometimes he knows me better than I know myself. Besides, no matter how interesting or not, there is a symbolic value I cannot ignore. Working on the sailors has become the one thing we do together without shadows of the past looming over us. A present referring to that means so much more than just “I thought you might like it.”
"Mycroft willed it to us," Daddy explains. "There was a letter attached, saying we should give it to you should you ever break your old one."
“No,” John lied, avoiding Sherlock's glare.
“I am sorry the case was rather boring,” Sherlock says matter-of-factly when they leave the crime scene again, “but I'm sure you can turn it into something more interesting when you blog about it.” Oh, was that a compliment?
Mary thinks she loves him, right? She wouldn't …
He dreams about a magician with dark curls and piercing eyes. John watches his show, and mistrusts every so-called magic trick that is displayed. He tries to understand all the tricks and in the end, he dissects them all. Instead of becoming angry, the magician acknowledges John for it. It does not make any sense at all, does it?
It is a strange sound (no explosion) with some kind of an echo (coming from outside the plane). The vibration of the plane changes slightly (engine problem?), the orientation of the plane does not (nothing serious, at least not yet). People around us start to murmur (no panic, that's good).
“The left engine is smoking,” I tell her (politely), “you should inform your captain.”
(need to place left arm here in order not to hurt broken ribs more than necessary, right arm here to stabilise body, careful with broken hand, kneel down slowly so John is nearly lying, keep his upper body and head slightly upright to prevent blood pressure from crashing, turn him around a little so I can see his face, support his head with my chest, check pulse, too fast due to shock, need to keep him warm)
He is not ready to do that right now.
When spring comes Sherlock feels so lonely that he chats with Molly voluntarily. But whenever they talk, over some secret channels, there is always something odd about her. Not because she bores him with stories about Lestrade. Something that has to do with John. But Sherlock does not feel courageous enough to explore that topic. John meets her and Lestrade regularly. Good. John is fine. Full-stop. No need to explore further.
Then he realises that it will arrive too late. John leans over to vomit again, then falls back into Sherlock's arm. His eyes are staring at a point somewhere on the left. His left hand is clinging to Sherlock's right arm, like to a lifeline. His breathe is shallow.
“I want you to deduce every little thing I did to him from his corpse.” He leaned down and pressed his cheek against Sherlock's
“Me too” he offers. I stomp once more,only to let him know that I heard him. There is no way to say “I was scared for your life and love you more than you can ever know” by stomping your heels, so I let the change pass.
After a while, when I am able to breathe again, I write an answer, “Of course!” I delete the exclamation mark, then I add it again, then I delete it again, then I add it again and then I press send before I can delete it again.
She looks at me carefully. “He … left with the two o'clock ferry. Needs to pick up a few things we forgot back home. He will be back in two or three days.”
Can Sherlock keep John's on-going erection going on for more than a day? (God, yes, and afterwards John has to admit that the relieve was well worth waiting for it)
We are 27,500 feet up in the air, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to stop whatever is going to happen now. There is no way out, no trick to escape, no way to outsmart a plane crash. I am absolutely helpless, and without any responsibility to save our lives.
It takes me twelve minutes to admit to myself that I am hurt. Because John is so angry with me that he left without another word. And because I am excluded. And I am nervous, because GraceNotEmilia might be born right now. And because I still don't know if John is angry.
“Point 20 says that you should have kept this email away from me,” he says and her glance gets hostile. They fight for a while but they both know that it is their last stand anyway.
Dr Davies gave him a sympathetic look for the first time. “There is not much we can do, I'm afraid,” he answered, and went on, “There is a chance for the diaphragm to recover on its own but that can take up to two years. If it does not recover, we can perform a diaphragmatic plication, meaning we will kind of gather up the muscle. That will not make it work again but will create something similar to the vacuum the lung needs to function.”
When I am finally able to react I can feel him watching me. The present is a book (I deduce from holding it) but one he picked very thoughtfully (his eager face tells me). I open it (slowly). When I look at the title (“Amrum Yesterday”) I cannot hide a frown. It is not a book I would buy myself. I do not care much about history (unless it involves crime mysteries) and have never wanted to own a photo book (besides those on anatomy).
“Well, in that case I'm very glad that my ordinary brain and I made it here in time to entertain you and your immense intellect,” John grumbled, but tried very hard to keep the smile out of his words. “So am I, “ Sherlock tossed back, but then grew sober, “so am I.”
(Sherlock must have been impressed with the result of that one, for it even made its way into his letter to Mary, saying, He does not mind an average number of body parts in the fridge. But I doubt that this knowledge is helpful for you and your boring daily routine.)
(The waiting room was redecorated four weeks ago. Wilko Matt Emulsion Soft Cream. Blood stains on the wall not completely covered. Caused by self-inflicted wound on a left-handers right wrist with a knife that could have been sharper.)
That night I sleep better than ever before.
Another folder was tossed. “Livorno, 15 days later, shooting at the harbour. Two mafia families decide that after 9 years of truce it is finally time to decimate each other's number again. 17 dead members of the familia, exactly one innocent bystander hit, directly into the heart. No accident at all. And now Rome.”
Sherlock is so occupied with stopping the nightmares that it takes him several weeks before realising John does not believe his excuses … but always pretends to do so.
I must admit I have spent some time, mostly at night, imagining how our second first kiss would be. Now I realise that I have never even come close. He is still angry, and sad, and troubled, and he puts all of his emotions into his kiss. It is rough and clumsy. Our teeth clash and my body switches to autopilot.
The woman's sexual interest in John fades instantly. (Ha!) She stammers some kind of “Thank you” and turns away again.
point 16 (John minds being excessively told why his favourite TV shows are deficient. He usually gets angry after the fifth remark within 45 minutes. You should also refrain from informing him about continuity and production errors.)
No. NO. Nonono. I know that he can read the “no” from my face, just like he read everything else. It just does not stop him. He hails a cab by phone and turns to me afterwards. “Don't see me off,” he  (commands? asks? pleads?) says.
When I continue driving north, I am sure that my heart is a little lighter than before.
That leads me to another unpleasant thought: I will not be able to play the violin in reality for a long time but playing it is the only way of communication between Eurus and I. What will I do when visiting her again next week? I do not have the slightest idea.
There is no more giggling now. John is moaning, seriously wanting me (me!), and I chime in. I can feel my hip moving on its own again, until his hand finally comes to rest on my cock.
That, Sherlock has to admit. He makes an affirmative sound and continues pressing his nose against John's temple.
His caring instinct, the one he always denied to have, kicked in. Frantically, he pressed the blanket against John's wound, telling him softly that he needed to hold on, that everything would be all right again, that ...
And then what? During the last fifteen days, his thinking had been dominated by hoping Sherlock would wake up at all. Then, when he had had problems coming back from coma, there had been no time to wonder about the future. And now -
Without Sherlock, John feels like slowly sinking in quicksand. No, in a marsh. For in his mind, quicksand is always linked to hot climate, and all he feels inside is cold.
I think of Mycroft again. How he had clung to me when he was shot. Would he also be disappointed if I gave up now?
His hands are slightly wet.
He catches me staring at him while Mycroft tries to assure Mary that Moriarty is really dead. Slightly shakes his head. Not here. I force myself to avert my eyes again. I am not sure what I am feeling, so I concentrate on the Moriarty Enigma instead. (And when did I become someone who wonders what he is feeling while faced with an enigma like that? Love seems to do strange things to the chemical balance of the brain.)
Somehow he wished he had shouted back at John instead of thrashing things and storming out. And leaving John behind, looking … How had he looked? Sherlock replayed the scene again in his mind. He watched himself losing temper instantly. No, stop. Concentrate on John!
When I return several hours later, the sheet has disappeared.
The fact that his eyes are a bit wet makes the single tear that is running down my face (slightly) less embarrassing.
When John finally comes to visit Sherlock at 221b, he gives the boring walls an reproachful look. He does not say much and does not stay long, and it is easy to deduce that he feels extremely  uncomfortable. Sherlock needs a while to realise that it is a good thing, because it means that John starts feeling again.
If John was wrong, at least there would not be too much time left to regret it.
But I have to try. So I push that thought aside (which takes an enormous amount of strength) and grab his bag instead. “Let me carry that,” I say instead of “Welcome” or “I missed you”.
John grabs me by my shoulders (one hand exactly where Mycroft's had been mere seconds ago) and shouts something at me. It seems to be very important, so I force myself to look at him and listen.
“After that, it caused two major wounds,” the doctor went on, “The bullet hit you at an unfortunate entrance angle that allowed it to rupture both your lung and your liver, causing heavy internal bleeding.”
But that night, my love for her somehow forced its way back into my chest and sat there, waiting for my approval. I clearly remember looking at her, her little nose that already resembled John's, her tiny fingers that were curled around my little finger, her tiny ears.
Doesn't he?
(took in the scene faster than me, he will dwell upon that endlessly in the future, John's alive!!)
Yet, Sherlock responded to it worse. Interesting.
“Of course,” the young doctor answered and exchanged an unnerving glance with John. Again, Sherlock lacked the strength to growl.
When Sherlock tried to voice his questions, he couldn't. Something was blocking his tongue, made him choke, made him lose it completely. In panic he wanted to reach for whatever it was that was stuck in his throat but still barely had any control over his body. He felt his hand clumsily bumping against something, could not get a grip on it.
“Our fight was stupid but can we have make up sex anyway?”
His cheeks turn red, and his thumb subconsciously starts playing with his ring finger. Sherlock starts talking, about his time away, and how he missed John and how he had been lonely and how incredible he had been from time-to-time but John has not been there to see for himself.
Because now I have to face a problem I didn't anticipate: I don't know what to say next.
The other man just smiled drily. “We have a few things to discuss,” he said, placing a yellow folder on the table. It had the name “Kate Wilson” written on it in tall black letters. John frowned. When Mycroft remained silent, John took the folder and opened it.
"Really Sherlock, it's all right. You have been in a coma for almost three weeks. Take it easy. I'm here. You are safe."
Sherlock needs to sort a few things before the story can gather pace.
I look at him sharply. Neither of us says a word but there is a flood of dialogue exchanged silently.
Panic takes over again and I fight him with all I have but no matter what I do I cannot free myself. Before long my vision is blurring and my arms stop flailing, are barely twitching now and I can feel my body slacken before everything is covered in darkness.
The phone rings. Mycroft. I take the liberty of rolling my eyes, even though he cannot see me, and pick up.
“I've been an idiot, and it is your fault,” Sherlock accused him, shaking his head in disbelieve. “What are you talking about, Sherlock?” John asked, moving closer. “I solved it.” “You found out what the victims had in common?” That should have been good, shouldn't it? Then why was John having the feeling that something was going terribly wrong?
(Memory: John and Mycroft on the morning of his death. Smug. Satisfied with themselves. A surprise for me, forgotten in the aftermath of death and torture and suffering.)
(odd expression on Seb's face, not only smugness, but pain as well)
He became painfully aware of the situation he was in now. John was holding him in his arms, rocking him like a child, while Sherlock was wetting his shirt with tears and drool. There was no dignified way out of this.
Evelyn. She completely ignored the fact that we didn't name Emilia Grace according to her wishes. Please let that mean that she cares for Emmi. Please!
That gives me focus again. I need to get him to safety, away from the plane, and get somebody to help him.
When he is finished packing, he straightens his back and faces me again.
My clenched guts agree with her. My brain is trying to disagree. My heart is caught in between, and I feel misery mixing with anger and guilt. “You cannot compare that,” I hiss, and when Janine continues to talk about it, I tune her out and think of how to break the news to John instead.
Whenever I come close to talking to someone, an irrational panic spreads all through my body. I start sweating, feel a lump in my throat, my hands start shaking. In the end, I give up. I try to tell myself that going to the bakery is already a big achievement as it is. I am pointing at the things I want, which is some kind of communication, isn't it? That is already more than I was able to do back in London. Sometimes I give a friendly nod to people I regularly meet on the street or at the beach.
Put that thought aside for a while. (Feel the room I have in my mind palace for put-aside thoughts growing and growing.) Take in the scene instead. Mummy holding Emilia, Dad holding Mummy. They are mourning their son, and I cannot comfort them. Can only just remain standing because John is close to my side.
“I'll store that knowledge in your room” Sherlock tutted and shook his head, probably still wondering how John could even have dared to consider drinking cappuccino after midday. “My what?” John looked at him curiously. “Your room. In my mind palace. Oh Otis, please try to keep up, will you?”
Please take a look at the tags. There are new ones because of this chapter.
(unpleasant, stop, won't be too late)
She prints it out anyway, then stores it in a safe hiding place, wondering what is going on in Sherlock's Holmes' weird mind.
Memories of Mary surface in my mind. Mary in front of the kebab shop, “I'll talk him round.”
The sadness reaches her eyes now, “I don't begrudge you of it.” She moves even closer, and whispers, “But no matter how cute the two of you are together Sherl, what is happening is this: John is cheating on his pregnant wife and you will steal her child.”
John refuses to believe that Serbia will be a death trap. He is completely adamant that Mycroft will find a way out. “You will not die there,” he states matter-of-factly while holding me tight. His optimism is so radiant that I tend to believe it as well. Occasionally.
Later, when he is sure of Sherlock's not yet admitted love, he stops minding those times. Instead of sitting around forlorn and lost, he does all the things he cannot do in Sherlock's present, like watching sci-fi shows. On one day, he manages to watch episodes 1 to 6 of Firefly, including the pilot, without being disturbed and being told what a ridiculous show it is.
Sherlock dives for John, pushing him out of the way. They both end up safely on the floor. John assumes that Sherlock has calculated the whole motion through, that he has known exactly how hard and when exactly he had to push him to get them both out of harm's way.
When I wake up again, it is dawning outside. John has moved away from me as far as possible and is watching me concernedly. “Good morning,” he whispers, “are you all right?”
And when John had been standing in front of him, unhurt, unkilled, Sherlock had had another chance to kiss him, and suddenly he felt all the loss and pain and desperation and insanity and emptiness he would feel should anything ever happen to John, and he had shied out.
Bit not good but loud enough. I manage to do so four times before the pain gets too intense.
This time, there were 113 words starting with a C that needed to be in the story. Many of them had to do with crying. Poor Sherlock!
It was good to hear that Sherlock's pronunciation was almost back to normal, John thought relieved. Then he decided to stop Sherlock's harangue.
This fic had been an attempt to deal with the sour feeling I had after S4. I thought that writing a fic that takes place long after S4, with an established romantic relationship between the boys would help. Unfortunately, it didn't.
When we sneak out for a cigarette, Mycroft lets me know that he is aware of my plan and approves. He even goes so far and tells me how much he cares for me. (Hope I did not let it show how much I love him in return. He would be an unbearable prick if I did.)
“I hadn't,” Sherlock volunteered, his face completely innocent. “At that age, I have been a dead boring good boy.”
Of course I do. I intend to make an ironic comment but instead I simply nod because there is something very serious in his eyes. Something profound. Something painful. So this is really not going to be a simple seduction underneath the shower.
Would love to take a boastful look at inner Mary now, but inner John's hand wanders into my hair and pulls, strong, steady. It hurts, but brilliantly so. Fixes my head so I am helplessly at his mercy. He assaults my lips forcefully, leaves a harsh stubble burn on my cheeks, leaves my legs wobbly with desire.
“He stole an ashtray for me, once,” he told Moran when he felt that enough time had passed. “At Buckingham Palace. Only to make me laugh.” And the most wonderful thing was that it wasn't a lie at all. He looked at his captor once more. Now it was about time ... He let a little fond smile spread across his face. It was genuine, no need to pretend here.
I watch him closely for another moment. “It was melon, not peach,” I tell him then. (Easy, he was fixating the stain it had left on my cast.)
“You know that legally speaking, you are not married to her because she used a fake identity. I took the liberty of arranging the paperwork to make the annulment official. One word from you and it will be done,” he said instead of the usual how are you banter.
(his breath against my face again, revolting, don't flinch, won't find him too late),
18. Remain being intellectually challenging for him. See attachment 3 for Adult Education programmes around Kensington.
When he was sure that he had finally stopped crying completely, he cleared his throat a little. John reacted instantly, moving back a little, giving Sherlock space to sit upright on his own. Their eyes met and Sherlock felt himself blush deeply. He was at a loss of words.
Sherlock looked at her, then his eyes flickered to John, also only for a second. “No,” he said then.
Only two seconds pass between realizing that it was a nice gesture and pulling John into said empty office. In a fluid motion he has to find extremely sexy I lock the door, swivel him against the wall, press his body against mine and start kissing his neck.
After a while, the tension that built up inside of John eases. His knees buckle, and he sinks down the wall of his bedroom, tears streaming down his cheeks. He is rendered completely immobile, clings to the phone like a life-line. Sherlock's voice floats around him, this wonderful, rich voice he did not dare hope to hear ever again.
I am caught in hell.
Well now, that is the one thing I should say once more, just in case. So I tell him.
The rain was so soft that puddles were only just forming. Sherlock tried to stomp through them in an impressive way but that only caused little ripples.
There were dark circles underneath his eyes. Did he have another nightmare? They did not really talk about them, but it seemed like they were mostly about John dying. He remembered the night after Sherlock had fully woken up from coma, when they had called him back to hospital to help calming Sherlock down.
John opened his mouth to answer but before he was able to voice his thoughts, Moran had reached out and punched him again, more fiercely this time. But now John had seen it coming, and his painful cry was carefully controlled, its only purpose to make Moran feel in charge here. It nevertheless hurt, and he felt something hot trickle down his temple. He lowered his head and watched his own blood slowly seep into his shirt. Then he steeled himself, determined to keep the upper hand here, no matter how ugly it would get.
Why does that catch my attention?
Spring turns into early summer.
“A lot better than those blue trunks you took off yesterday night,” Sherlock adds, completely unhelpful. John skips any reaction and just leaves for the bathroom.
At least, that had been the case until his little brother had been born when he himself had been seven. Sherlock brought countless surprises to Holmes Manor, and the biggest surprise of all had been the fact that Mycroft started to like the feeling.
There is a room for re-watching the parts of my life my conscience missed the first time. It used to look like Auntie Rose's living room. Now it is the (only) cinema John forced me to visit to watch a Bond film with him four years ago.
(I am a bit surprised at how positive my memories of him are. Am I being nostalgic? Or is my brain just giving my soul what it needs right now? I don't know. Don't care. Really.)
He has a point there but as always that does not make it better.
I feel the need to peel my skin off of my body with my fingernails in order to prevent me from calling Mary a lying cunt.
Janine laughs. “Oh, she owes me a favour. Besides,” she goes on, dragging me towards the cab she has stopped, “she reads John's blog regularly. Real crush.”
A young doctor comes and tells us that John is fine except for a severe concussion (A heavy weight is falling off my chest. He is fine.) and needs to stay in hospital for a day or two. No, he will not be able to be transported back to London just now. Yes, he will be completely fine again.
John moans. “God I want you so much,” he says, “I want you right now.”
It is slowly dawning to me that he will not be able to leave the hospital today. Just when I think I need to panic, another nurse comes and pushes us into the room. She places John in front of the X-ray machine and pushes me out of the room.
“Good,” John says, “good.” (Wants to say more but doesn't.) We both look down at Mycroft. With my arms trembling I can no longer hold him, so I lower him to the ground. With enormous effort I lean forward and close his eyes. (His face still warm. Lips blue.) My fingers leave another blood stain, matching the one John's fingers left at his throat. Something drips onto his forehead. Apparently I am crying.
I have no idea.
He is a genius when it comes to us.
Surely Sherlock must be searching for him already, and it would only be a matter of time until John would be rescued. All he had to do now was playing for time. And the longer Moran thought he was in control, the better. He averted his glance, looking at the white plastered wall instead, allowing some of the fear he felt to show on his face. Moran instinctively responded by smiling with satisfaction.
Sherlock remembered seeing himself lying on a similar operating table, the surgeons stepping back from him, already taking off their gloves. It had been that moment when his inner Moriarty had reminded him of John being in danger, causing Sherlock to fight, and defeat, death. It had been a very important moment in the construct of reality he used to live in for a while. The thought that it did not match with reality bothered him deeply.
“Your Mummy will be very pleased with you,” he sniffs, “she's been plaguing me to cry all night.”
“Don't. Do that. To me.” he nearly yelled. “Don't you dare to lie to me.” They stared at each other for a while, a whirl of emotions crossing over Sherlock's face within a split-second. Then he sighed, looking slightly uncomfortable, but still not admitting anything. John sighed as well. “Sherlock, you barely looked at anything inside the Pantheon, and you didn't even ask about what Commissario Mandini told me. Then our trip around the entire building and you standing next to the obelisk for thirty minutes, completely exposed ... You weren't there to observe. You were there to be seen.”
“It's my brain, John,” Sherlock explains later, when they are watching the intravenous fluids dripping into Sherlock's body, “my brain. Who am I if it gets damaged permanently? Who would I be without my eidetic skills, my deductions? Who would still respect me without my abilities?”
about …
There is only the mail box. I leave a message that our plane has been diverted and that we do not know when we will be able to get Rosie. I do not mention the broken engine.
He looks at me for another while, then, without a further comment, he leans forward and takes me in his arms. Carefully, without hurting my already wounded chest. It is an awkward embrace. John has to keep up the tension in his spine in order not to lean against my wound, I on the other hand cannot lean forward without hurting myself.
With that she leaves.
I would love to dwell on it but Emmi demands more presents (rightly so). Then the gift giving goes on. My parents are appropriately moved by their trip to Hamburg, then a few more presents are exchanged, and everybody is moved by one present or the other.
Then I realize how to exploit her current state. “All right, I will do the leg work for you,” I (pretend to) growl at Mycroft, “but I need John with me.” Mary, caught between being angry about everything and trying to appear at ease with the world, has no choice but let him go with me without comment. We are out of the door and inside a cab faster than ever before.
When he arrives at Leinster Gardens, we prepare the stage. John sits down in the wheelchair Billy has stolen for me, and I ruffle his hair (with great enthusiasm. Many times. Until he tells me to stop and proceed with the rest of the preparations. And that I'd be free to ruffle his hair as long as I want in the near future ... Looking forward to that.)
Again, I cannot help but giggle a little. “Making people cry used to be my speciality before John transformed me into a softie.”
There is something warm on my shoulder. John's hand. I feel my body relax a little.
I can only nod. "I'll go first and tell them you are down with your nerves," my genius lover tells me. Brilliant plan. That gives me some time to pull myself together, wipe that post-orgasmic smile from my face (grinning like an idiot now), re-arrange my hair and my trousers and my mind. I nod again.
When the terror was over, ending without Sherlock being able to sit up on his own and the nurse stressing that he could indeed have more pain killers if necessary, all Sherlock wanted was to sulk and be ignored by the world.
John does not huff. He sees the hidden fear in Sherlock's eyes. He understands, as always, sees all the emotions Sherlock claims not to have but from which he is unable to divorce himself. He sees how the whole experience has shaken Sherlock to the bones. He sees Sherlock's love for him and wonders if Sherlock also knows that he is in love with John.
But John does not know. He only sometimes wonders why Sherlock listens to him.
When he finally wakes up for good, he is disorientated for a moment. He lies completely motionless, eyes closed. Taking in the situation, scared to give away he is awake. Like he did back in that cellar.
“Well,” John started, but was cut off immediately. “Two similar cases during the last four weeks, one in Lombardy, one in Tuscany.” Sherlock didn't stop pacing to throw another collection of newspaper articles onto the table. “First incident, Bergamo, 25th of March, 13:47, Banca di Marche. Four robbers, 21 hostages, a ludicrous amount of money. Of all banks at Bergamo, this one is the most complicated to break into, and also the one with the lowest amount of cash available. Twenty hostages survived, one got killed by a clean shot in the head. Accidentally? Unlikely.”
When the letter is written, John feels better for the first time in weeks. Then his heart clenches, and he feels tears sting again. He does not want to feel better. Never. Mechanically, he tears the letter to pieces and throws it away.
So here is the final chapter. It contains 124 words starting with A. No wonder it turned out angsty, right? Enjoy!
“Let's face it, John” he went on after a moment. “If he'd trusted you the way you still trust him, he wouldn't have doubted you for a second. But he did, didn't he?” John closed his eyes just before the hammer came down on his ring finger.
The dizziness got worse, he honestly needed to take a break. “Unbearable, egoistic things” Moran chimed in, probably misreading John's pause, not noticing how he was helping his captive here. “Nice things” John corrected, avoiding Moran's glance now. Eyes down, like he had done a century ago, back at the hospital. “Like when he pretended to have a lead we needed to follow, chasing a cab, only to make me forget my psychosomatic limp.”
Sherlock looked down his body towards the wound in his chest. “Of course,” he answered as smugly as possible in his situation. “She shot me in the chest.”
I don't have to look at her to see the hidden insecurity on her face. She probably thinks that Daddy should have found me. He is far better at handling a broken son.
When he finally opened his eyes, he got an impression of the room he was in now. It seemed to be old, with stone walls and sandy clay instead of a floor. It was shady without the lights on. Some cellar then. Something caught his eyes, a little red dot of light somewhere underneath the ceiling. A camera. No wonder Moran always appeared as soon as John regained consciousness.
I snap out of my mind palace and find myself alone in the morgue, looking down at my brother's corpse, my hand lingering at his temple again. In my head there is an echo of a conversation we once had. “They all care so much. Do you ever wonder if there’s something wrong with us?”
The vitae of the victims, all four in a row. In each of them, a single phrase was frantically circled with a pen several times. John frowned and stepped even closer. He skimmed over that of Lucia Mazzini, the woman who got shot at the bank robbery. The circle made of ink was curled around her profession. “Doctor”.
Well, but it doesn't matter. Mary is dead.
Our eyes meet once more, and all the heat and passion and want rushes back. His wonderful face is open, his eyes clouded with lust. He is shivering in anticipation, and so am I.
But his problem is still unsolved, the nightmares continue, and John continues to be strangely distant. Sherlock launches another set of experiments. Does John still look at him adoringly when he walks into the living room, wearing only a towel? (Yes but three distinctive seconds less than usually.)
“We'll need coffee and something light to eat,” I tell my parents. Daddy starts preparing something for us instantly while Mummy looks quizzically at Emmi who is sitting on her lap.
But no, he didn't want to indulge that memory. He was angry. Angry with John and angry with himself. But that wasn't the right thing to be, was it? No, being angry with John was what he needed to focus on. Just being angry with John. Because John had been mean.
John allowed some of the fear he felt to show in his eyes, hoping to appear miserable. In fact, he felt better than before, besides the fear. If Moran was about to break John's each and every finger, that would at least buy Sherlock more time to find him. All John had to do was to endure the pain. He could do that, definitely. He only hoped he would be able to use his hand again once this was over.
Well, Sherlock would get better soon. He would recover from his multiple injuries, rebuild his muscles, hopefully get rid of the oxygen mask, and then -
A wiggly film shows a plane, presumably high up in the air, moving oddly. It is constantly diving and rising again. The people inside must be awfully sick. “Live”, a little icon in the top right corner of the screen tells us. The ticker at the bottom informs us that a film team outside London is accidentally catching the wild ride on tape and sending it directly to the station so it can be broadcast all over the world.
I sit down on the sofa and take refuge in my mind palace, where Mycroft is waiting for me already. He is looking sad (once more, no surprise here). “What are you doing here, little brother?” he asks, knowing exactly what I will answer.
This is most likely the best Christmas present I …
I work until my brain is so tired that I can risk going to sleep without thinking of John and Mary (lying in bed side by side). Does not work. Why is it bothering me that much? I know that John loves me. I know he is with Mary to protect GraceNotEmilia. Because I told him to. And yet …
“What I want?” Sebastian chuckled, an insincere, cold sound. “I want you to stay right here for the next hour.”
(old view of the main square, looked like that when we spent the holidays here, another predictable move).
When John uses that tone, Sherlock's palpitations intensify right away, and he does what John wants almost without thinking. He knows that if John would ever do it on purpose he would be in trouble, for there is no way of resisting.
“And now the brilliant part, please,” Sherlock prompted. “And that would be...?” It was always interesting to watch how Sherlock was able to express annoyance, arrogance and expectation at the same time.
