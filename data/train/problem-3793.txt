Cas pulled him back into bed and Dean laughed lightly.
It didn't matter who had really killed her, just like it didn't matter that Dean hadn't been the one to pull the trigger that ended John Winchester's life, guilt didn't care about semantics.
Cas tilted his head.
“You are drunk.”
“What are you going to do now?”
Murder
“What the hell Cas?”
“Cas!”
“Don’t stop,” he whimpered.
"Well..." The angel faltered. "If you do not wish to... I can return it."
“Please...”
“I will, in time. If I’m feeling generous. You ignored me, I didn’t like that.”
“Silence can’t help you either, you just need to tell us what we want to hear. Daddy’s a big boy, he can take it.”
He stepped into the room and Dean shut the door behind him.
Dean pushed his hips back, grinding his ass against Cas' erection, which thankfully hadn't flagged enough to give him away.
Dean held tight to his gun under the table, silent and tense as the waitress received another flirtatious look from his lover, oblivious to the danger.
He might even call Sam if he made it past breakfast. It would be nice to hear his brother’s voice again. Sure, he might bitch at him for not answering before, and it might be difficult to figure out how to communicate after all this time away, but, given time, maybe they’d be able to get there. Maybe they could be a family again. Maybe he could even call Bobby as well, make up for all the shit he’d pulled. Maybe he didn’t have to be defined by all the terrible things he’d done anymore. Maybe-
"You plannin’ on getting naked before I die of old age?"
“You shut your face.”
Home, what a strange concept. Something Dean had been searching for, for as long as he could remember. Something that always ended in fire, in destruction. When he had seen Cas’ wings, falling to bits, charred beyond repair, he had thought of that fire. Mary had burned away, but not Cas, never Cas. For so long home had been a fluctuating space, identical and disparate motel rooms, a car, a brother who came and went. Fire, always fire, licking at the walls, burning their flesh.
Dean had hated Ruby from the moment he met her, but hey, he hated a lot of people. No one would be good enough for his little brother, particularly after that Jess chick had broken his heart and left Dean to clean up the pieces. They spent their time in a state of comfortable loathing, both avoiding saying a thing against the other, while Sam was around at least. He wouldn’t have thought it was possible to be so at ease around someone he hated and who hated him just as much, but somehow they managed it, and that had been the problem. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust his instincts, but everyone he knew was bad or worse, except Sam perhaps, what did it matter if she was no exception? The only way to keep Sam clear of evil would have been to ship him off to someplace far from the hunters, from Dean, and he just couldn’t bring himself to do that. Looking back he really wished he had. It’d have ended up the same anyway, just with a damn sight less bloodshed.
“I’m not sure.”
Dean didn’t seem any more willing to finish the thought than Cas was, and the next few minutes were tense and silent as the mood was shifted by memory.
“You are impossible!”
“I know.”
He practically fell against Dean, hiding his face in the crook of his neck as he shoved him back against the wall, not able to bear looking at that cursed tattoo one moment more, and hoping that Dean's arousal would stop him questioning the desperation he'd surely seen in Cas' eyes. He bit down on Dean's shoulder for good measure, knowing the way pain seemed to bring his mind to a standstill.
“I should leave.”
“You can study. I’ll tutor you.”
He grabbed the phone and, only hesitating slightly, dialled his brother's number, not even sure it was the current one. How long had it been? Not long enough for him to forget what Sam sounded like, but certainly enough to question his memory. Hell, Sam's voice might even have dropped in that time. Dean knew his own was deeper, by far, but perhaps that was a matter of experience, not age. He hoped Sam was blissfully free from experience. Bobby's call, however, did not fill him with confidence.
"I've got a brother. We ain't getting on. He's all the family I got and I keep fucking it up."
“Scared your boyfriend will get hurt Castiel? Or are you more worried about him getting expelled?” He laughed as Cas bristled. “It’s a good thing Mommy Winchester didn’t live to see what a disappointment her son turned out to be.”
This whole story being unrelentingly emo, and getting certain songs stuck in my head every time I release a chapter
“What did you say Dean?”
A few tables over two kids were sat beside each other, ignored by their mother on the other side of the booth as the younger crawled over the seats, playing with some tacky toy plane, being periodically saved from disaster by the older of the two. They looked so normal.
Dean shook his head, he had to stop thinking like this. There was a job to be taken care of, that was the priority, not his own reservations. This was what he did, and he was good at it. His father would have given him a beating if he’d known he still felt guilty for the business he’d been raised in. Thank god the old bastard was dead. Not that Dean had ever managed to escape his influence, not like Sammy, Sammy was free. At least one of them was still human, at least one of them still deserved forgiveness.
“I didn’t choose this.”
Cas’ forehead wrinkled adorably as he thought about it. Wait, no, adorable was not a word he should be using to describe his best friend.
Alastair (because he NEEDS to be tagged)
Cas was starting to look worried.
"Yes Dean?" There was a smile, a true smile, in his voice. His eyes twinkled like the stars they were made of and Dean was awestruck with the majesty of them.
“How is your brother?”
He gripped his dick and pumped it hard, groaning in relief, so close, already so close. His hand slid up and down his shaft, too desperate to care about the lack of lube. An impending orgasm coiled in his belly and his breaths grew ragged, one more stroke, maybe two before-
“I have a knife, you have a gun. The likelihood is high.”
Sam called, and they spoke, and Dean cried for the first time in… how long had it been? After the phone call, of course, he still had his pride.
Sam didn't deserve white hot instincts and murderous rage, and Dean, well, Dean deserved exactly what he was going to get.
He would do it, he had to do it. This was as inevitable as the rain, it wasn't like he hadn't known that. He would kill him, but not tonight. Tonight he would sit outside the apartment building he now knew he lived in, miserable and still so fucking aroused, and he would follow his orders (tonight the first and tomorrow the second) and somehow he would find a way to live with it.
Dean laughed, flicking on the light, which still didn’t stretch to illuminate the walls. The small circle of light making it feel like they were the only people in the world, like this wasn’t impossible.
"You don't dictate the speed of this, Dean, you do not control your pleasure. I do."
“Hey, Cas, so I’ve been thinking. We’re probably gonna wind up killin’ each other anyway with the way things been goin’, how’s about we just agree to keep fucking until we get told different?”
"There has to be another way."
Cas, and yet somehow they still caused a lump to rise in his throat. The angel faltered for a second, then his eyes cleared of anger, and filled with compassion. Dean lay down in the bed, guiding Cas to lie beside him, and Cas hugged him tight to his chest.
“Hey, assbutt.” Cas flicked on the lighter, and held the necklace over the flame.
“He loved me. He loved me all these years and I fucked it up Sam. We could have had what you and Eileen have but I was too fucking scared and I left it too late and now he’s gone and there’s nothing I can do.”
The knife dropped to the side and they both surged forwards, drawn to each other with a pull that neither of them seemed capable of resisting. They kissed like they were starving for it, like there would never be enough, like this outcome had been inevitable all long. As inevitable, he supposed, as one of them eventually killing the other.
"Cas, I'm not... Guys don't really wear stuff like this? Okay. I really appreciate the thought, but I can't-"
Dean stepped back but Cas matched his pace, something dark in his eyes that sent a tingle directly to Dean’s dick, a fact that he aggressively ignored.
“The last time I did as you asked of me you had an exceptionally adverse reaction so excuse me if I am no longer listening to your demands,” the anger in his voice pleased Dean, at first, before the guilt set in.
***************************
“Why not?” He growled at the man who’d been more father to him than anyone.
"You don't have to sit all the way over there Cas," Dean patted the bed beside him. "C'me on, I won't bite," he giggled, "that's more your style anyway."
“I know what you mean.” Cas spoke softly.
Dean shifted, eyes slightly wider than normal, and Cas pounced.
Ruby laughed a cruel laugh and Dean wanted nothing more than to stab the bitch himself, anything to take that look off Sam's face, like he'd been broken too.
"Uh-" he struggled to speak around the lump in his throat, "Cas..."
“Cas, come on, he’s not worth it.”
"I don't like the sound of that."
Cas pulled out a chair for him, forcing him down with a hand on his shoulder, then took the seat directly beside him. Dean shot him a questioning look, which was only answered with a mischievous smile and an increasingly familiar controlling grip on his thigh. Dean took a deep breath and willed himself not to get hard in public, he had a sneaking suspicion it wouldn't go well for him if he did, which, dammit, made it even more difficult to avoid. This was hot as fuck, but Dean Winchester sure as shit didn't let himself get pushed around without a fight.

“No, that was her. I’m honestly surprised she never tried to kill me while she was alive.”
"Ew, gross Dean."
Was he, after all this uncertain time, actually alive?
“Survive, then. If you emerge victorious you should not dwell on the past. You have been doing that long enough.”
He glanced up, saw pupils blown wide with agony, and looked back down at his work. It was good enough. He flung his kill to the floor, head colliding with the pavement, no strength left to lessen the fall. He was close to dead already but Castiel didn't do half measures. He raised his foot and stomped down on the fading man's neck, gradually applying more pressure until he heard something snap. His eyes glazed with the sheen of death and Cas walked away, whistling once again.
"So, what's up gramps?" He knew he was poking the bear, Samuel always made a concerted effort to ignore the fact that Dean was anything more than a soldier to him, but he couldn't really give a fuck. They were family, what did it matter if he acknowledged it?
“Just- you. You’re a freaking lunatic.”
He yelped as Cas cut him off, silencing him with a kiss.
Why hadn’t he died?
He wanted to tell him to go away, but before the words could form the door opened.
“—and the empty candy wrappers when rearranged will lead him to the actual stash of candy. It’s genius.”
Dean shook his head, but he couldn’t stop the grin from spreading over his face.
Dean shook his head. “No on both counts.”
Sam snorted. “Right, well I’ll just, uh, go back and wait in the car again.” Sam pointed a thumb over his shoulder and backed out of the room. “Don’t take too long, lovebirds,” he called.
“We should go, too.”
“Did you hear?” Cas asked the next morning when Dean opened the door.
Sam sighed. “I don’t think I ever said sorry for not seeing past all of that.”
Cas finally made the harrowing move to place his whole hand on top of Dean’s. He only needed to say one word, the one that meant everything to him, and the one that meant so much more when he said it. “Dean.”
“So, you ditched him?” Bobby furrowed his brow.
“Fuck, Sam! Don’t you know how to knock?” Dean shouted angrily from his position bent nearly in half underneath Cas.
Cas started to laugh, Dean joining in a moment later.
“So… just… wow.” Sam rubbed a hand over his jaw, the stubble catching on his fingers. “Dragons and soul mates. I feel like you guys should have a Disney movie made about you.”
“You’re really staying?”
“We’re going to save him,” John said into his ear. “Just help me, son.”
He reverently ran his hands over the steering wheel of the impala to ground himself before starting her up and backing out of his expertly chosen parking spot. He sped out of the parking lot, Sam in the rearview mirror, thankfully too far away to make out his exact expression.
“Something’s up,” Dean said.
“Come on, Cas.”
They picked up Sam on the way to the abandoned barn. The car ride was silent aside from, or perhaps because of, the music Dean had blaring through the speakers.
“Well,” Cas said. “It’s all a moot point since he’ll never find out what I am anyway. Information about me is extremely sparse.” He opened the door and sat down.
Cas closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Is this really why you called me out here?”
Cas had grabbed him by his flannel and forced their mouths together in some semblance of a kiss. In reality it was just a firm, slightly aggressive, press of lips on lips.
“The present,” Dean said. Hadn’t they just established this?
“Hey, you said this was my pie.”
Dean let out a sigh and let himself relax into Cas’ arms. “It’s just… I put all of this behind me, you know? It took a damn long time, but I did it. It was like, I dunno, like I was free or something. I mean, yeah, sometimes I had a relapse or something when someone came at me too fast or raised their voice too loud, but that had almost completely stopped. But now my dad is back. And he’s going to try and kill us.”
“Good.” She turned to the coffee pot and began filling a dark blue traveling mug. “Now both of you go and finish getting ready. We’re leaving in five.”
John stood up from the chair, advancing on Cas with menace in his eyes.
“And you’re okay with this?” Sam asked Dean. “It doesn’t freak you out?”
“Excuse me,” Dean said. “Charlie did
“Cas!”
Dean didn’t know what to make of that, but the dude just magicked him out of a giant crater so he was inclined to believe him. “Well, you’re going to love it,” Dean told him. “Take a seat and let me grab another skewer.” He fed another log into the flames to build the fire back up first, though. You couldn’t make s’mores without a campfire.
“Yes,” Sam said miserably. “But you weren’t supposed to find out!”
The next day when Cas arrived to school in Dean’s letterman jacket, everyone knew it was official. At lunch, Dean made sure there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that the two of them weren’t completely, one hundred percent official by tugging him onto his lap and moaning obscenely as he laid a sloppy, wet kiss on Cas’ lips.
“What kind of pizza do you want?” Dean asked.
“Cool,” Dean said. He looked at the fire to avoid letting Cas see his blush. The marshmallow he had been roasting now looked like someone had stabbed a chunk of coal. But it did give him an idea to keep the cute star talking for a little longer.
“What? No way,” Dean said. “I don’t want to actually live with the guy. I’ve heard your horror stories.”
Jo arrived twenty minutes later, angry and sweaty. “At least one of you jerks could have called to tell me we weren’t meeting at the park anymore.”
Cas bit his lip. He didn’t want to be callous, but, “Do you think you’ll be able to get over it? My adversary could show up at any minute.”
Bobby snorted as he turned and led the three of them further into his house. “I only have the one spare room, so I’m guessing Sam is going to have to take the couch.”
Sam quickly pulled up in front of them and unlocked the doors. Cas jumped in the front seat and Charlie slid into the back.
Cas just shrugged. “Would you prefer male genitalia?”
showed up at the grocery store?”
The man looked back to his computer and leaned a little closer to the monitor. “I’m sorry,” he said, his cheery voice carrying. “Could it be under another name, maybe?”
There was a knock at the door and Dean dreaded what awaited him on the other side. He had hoped that Cas would just leave. It would have been easier than sticking around to say some bullshit goodbyes, anyway.
“That’s not what I said, Dean,” John told him. “But look at him. Last I recalled you weren’t gay.”
“So, Bobby,” Sam started, popping open the cap to a beer and taking a swig. “How long have you known about Cas?”
Castiel pulled away from Dean and rolled his eyes. “I had
Sam looked away sheepishly, swallowing and mumbling out, “Sorry.”
Cas went on.
“Great, so he can come back with me right now,” Dean declared.
Sam shook himself out of his momentary shock and looked down at the speedometer. “Cas, my foot is literally to the floor. My car doesn’t go faster than this.”
Dean couldn’t stop the smile spreading across his face, though he did try. “You are such an asshole.”
The desk he had been sitting at toppled over as Dean shot up to face his best friend. “Cas!” he squeaked, backing up a few paces. “I—what are you doing here?”
“You swear it’s not going to hurt him?” Sam asked.
His adversary was down in that rubble somewhere, recuperating. Cas didn’t want to give him the opportunity to do so, but he had taken a pretty big hit in the last round of fighting as well. He removed his hand from the wound at his side and saw the circle of blood staining his white shirt grow larger, the crimson substance seeping into the starched fabric. The wound was large, but Castiel would survive. He’d certainly survived worse. And technically, as he was always quick to point out to Gabriel, he couldn’t actually die in his dreams. Though, of course, Gabriel always replied that brain dead was as good as dead and that was usually enough to cow Castiel into a huffy silence.
“Uh, cancer doesn’t care how tan you are, Cas.”
“It’s a picture,” Dean replied. “Now get out of my house.”
“Uh, guys?”
Cas reached across and laid a gentle hand on Dean’s thigh. “Then close your eyes or look at me.” He squeezed his thigh. “And just remember, if all else fails we can always run away to our private island.”
Cas clenched his hands into fists. “Apologies,” he said after a sigh. “Please drive quickly, Sam. I have an idea what your father plans to do and we cannot allow it to happen.”
“I’m open to better ideas.”
’” Cas said.
“Watching over you,” Cas finished.
Finally, Gabe obliged and pulled out onto the now mostly deserted street.
“Good,” Bobby said. “Dean, why don’t you show Cas around. I’ve got to go check on dinner.”
“Ugh, what?” Jake said, cresting the top of the hill, Andy on his heels. “Holy shit!”
Cas froze. “What?”
Bobby, who had been taking a sip of his own coffee, spit it out at Dean’s words. “What the hell’s wrong with you, boy?” he demanded, wiping his mouth off on his sleeve.
In the end they waited to go on vacation until Sam was done with school for the year and surprised him and Jess with an island getaway. He tried inviting Charlie and Gilda, but Gilda beat him to the punch by surprising Charlie with tickets to the San Diego Comic-Con, so in the end it wasn’t really a choice for her.
“You two are being weird,” Sam told them. “And if I have to be in the middle of it, I’m not watching Doctor Sexy. Hand me the remote.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas replied, unable to keep a grin off of his face.
“Why?” Sam asked, flinging his arms up. “What could you have possibly seen that would make it hard to be around your best friend?”
“Right,” Dean said. “Back on track. Why I’m pathetic." He cleared his throat and continued, "Well, you see, this crazy, wonderful boyfriend means the world to me, and I’ve pretty much known how I’ve felt about him since day one when he saved me from that ball pit in McDonald’s when we were four.” He paused a moment to reminisce. “But you see,” he continued with a shake of his head, “I’ve been too pathetic to tell him just how much I like him. Just how much he means to me. And I almost lost him, so I decided I definitely can’t wait anymore.”
“Oh!” the man said, a goofy looking smile spreading across his face. “Why didn’t you say you were here to meet the Novaks? Right this way!”
“He doesn’t like our sweaters,” he accused, pointing a forkful of pancake dripping with syrup at his brother.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said into his shoulder. “You’d think I’d have stopped being such a monumental fuck up by now, huh?”
“That’s still so weird to me, man,” Sam said. “I mean, I get it, I do. But I just never thought you’d give it up.”
Dean dropped the plate he had been washing, hearing the dull clatter as it landed in the sink as if through a filter.
She laughed, and the sound was a pleasant tinkling thing.
Sam’s face brightened for the first time that evening. “So it’s true? I can finally sing Dean and Cas, sitting in a tree, and it’ll be true?”
"I didn't want to freak him out more than he already was," Dean said, shaking his head. "I didn't think it'd be a good idea to make a big deal out of it, you know?"
They walked in silence for a few minutes, Dean feeling even more miserable than he thought was possible. He used a balled up fist to wipe sweat from his eyes. And it was just sweat, he wasn’t
“Um, well…” He shook his head and stood up. “Just come on.”
Castiel ruminated on his thoughts until the man next to him, his mate, began shaking in what Castiel was horrified to realize were suppressed sobs.
Pink touched Dean’s cheeks. “He would, wouldn’t he?”
The front door was open when they got there.
After that, Dean forgot all about his plans of making Cas sleep on the floor.
Anger bled into Sam. “Why do you even care?” he demanded.
Dean gave a minute nod in return. He remembered now. The kid hadn’t looked before running after his basketball. “How’s the kid? He alright?”
“Were you just jogging?” Dean asked, in the same tone of voice one would use if inquiring about eating your own toe jam.
Cas heaved a sigh across the line. “Yes. Gabe has been very adamant about it. He thinks we need more brotherly bonding time.”
"Yeah," Dean agreed. "Even if you are a pain in the butt, I did sort of miss having your ugly mug around."
“Hey,” he said sheepishly.
“This could all be so easy.”
Bobby grunted over the line. “Well, I guess that explains why you jumped into this whole thing so quick.”
"Too bad," Dean said. He reached over and put Sam in a headlock. "Now you're coming with us, or you're going to get the worst noogie of your life."
“You realize I will have to continue to live with him, correct?”
Dean nodded. “We did. He’s probably still staring out of his dumb window. I seriously think that’s all he’s done for the past week straight.”
He finally looked up and saw Cas’ blue gaze locked on him. Time seemed to stop as they stared at each other. Dean wanted to close the distance but couldn’t bring himself to move. He could hear his heart beat pounding in his ears, wondered if Cas could hear it, too.
“We’re almost there,” Charlie tried to reassure him. “Just like five more minutes. We can think of a plan of attack.”
“Gladly,” Cas replied. “I haven’t had a chance to stretch my wings in
“But what, Sam?” Dean asked.
“It was
“Because it wasn’t real,” Cas replied.
“Bobby!” Dean yelled. “Hey, Bobby!”
Cas didn’t even give thought to the implication, though he would stay up all night wondering about it later. But in the moment, he slid his hand into Dean’s, lacing their fingers together like it was the most natural thing in the world. Maybe it was.
“Huh?” Dean froze like a deer in headlights. He felt like he’d been caught out by the graveled tones of his best friend.
“Sorry, Jo, gotta go,” Dean said, grabbing Cas by his upper arm and practically dragging him out of his seat.
Dean cracked a grin and allowed his boyfriend to help him up. “I dunno, Cas. I’m thinking I might deserve two pies now.”
“Well, yeah,” Dean said. “But you and Gabe don’t exactly strike me as the fishing type.”
Dean shrugged. “I—I don’t know, Jo,” Dean said. “It sounds crazy, but…”
“Eat your food, Dean.”
“What are we going to do?”
Cas unlocked the back door to the bakery and stepped inside. It smelled wonderful, scents like cinnamon and chocolate and strawberry mingling in the warmth of the kitchen, but it was the loud music blaring through the stereo that put a smile on Cas’ face. Led Zeppelin this morning.
“You just want me to take my shirt off,” Cas grumbled, but he stood and pulled his shirt off obediently. Two large and leathery wings unfolded from his back and Sam felt his jaw drop open. If this had been a cartoon he’s pretty sure his eyes would be popping out of his head.
"Nah," Dean said. "I think I'll stick with my donut lovin' cop clichés, thanks."
“I meant I was leaving to go to the store.”
Dean looked down at the blaze below, the inhuman shrieks of Cas’ adversary ringing over the sound of flames spitting and popping. “Smokey the Bear would be very disappointed in us,” he said.
“Oh fuck, I knew you were an angel,” Dean breathed, dragging him into a messy kiss in front of all their friends and family.
“He’ll get over it,” Dean whispered, finally closing the last few inches and kissing Cas. They continued for a few minutes, keeping it chaste(-ish) until they heard an exasperated voice from the open door.
“Is watching them fight as weird for you as it is for me?” Charlie whispered to Jo, just loud enough for the boys to hear.
“Maybe you should have thought of that before you left me in that motel room,” Dean told him, not reaching his eye. “Let’s go, Cas.”
“And maybe after that, we can go to the cabin. Let you stretch your wings a bit.”
“I expect you to be ready in ten,” John told him before disappearing into the bathroom.
Dean hummed as he reached for the plate of potatoes in front of him and scooped some onto his plate. “You know, I can’t say I remember.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Thanks, Cas.”
The other three rolled their eyes and pretended to gag. Dean flipped them off.
After that things went back to normal. They continued watching the movie, Charlie drooling over Andy (a respectable amount, she was quick to remind everyone), munching on snacks, and eventually deciding against going outside to play a round of catch since it was still far too hot out there. They all left before dinner, but not before making plans to hang out the next day, Cas and Dean making extra plans to meet up earlier for some alone time.
Dean let out a little laugh. “Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, but don’t you think you should let Cas field that question?”
“Don’t sass me,” John told him, heat behind his voice. “Now find me something to fix up my arm.”
Dean’s eyes widened and he shook his head. “Please don’t do that. You’re a terrible baker.”
Sam nodded. "Yeah."
“You’ve never heard of a costume?”
Cas just smiled at him and placed a hand on his knee. “I’m very glad that you decided to open up your shop instead. You’re still gone far too long for my liking, but at least your hours are reasonable.”
Dean started giggling, thinking of all of the jokes he could make about Cas and his ass, but refrained from saying any of them. Bobby was like his father, after all. He didn’t want the old man to know too much about his sex life. “Oh yeah, he decided to wait five years into our relationship to finally try and take me out. He even married me just to lure me into a false sense of security.”
Dean dropped his marshmallows into the fire. “What?”
“I promise,” Cas pressed into his lips. “I promise.”
sign and taking a deep breath.
“Have you really been getting that far behind in biology?” Cas asked him, concern making his voice soft.
Jess gave him a sad little smile and nodded. “He could come around,” she told him. “Five years is a long time. He might’ve changed.”
“And checking someone out isn’t that embarrassing,” he added at his normal volume. “You caught me doing it to you in the crater.”
“A lot of ass,” Dean echoed.
Sam immediately looked away, afraid that the sheen of tears covering his eyes would give away how much that meant to him. He was pretty sure that Dean was proud of him, too, but he was also pretty sure that this was the first time the words had ever been spoken aloud to him by someone aside from Jess. He didn’t know why this was different, it just sort of was.
Dean scrunched his face in thought. “Huh, guess I didn’t.” He shrugged and Cas punched his arm again. “Ow! What was that one for?”
Dean pulled some plates down from the cabinet and set them on the counter. “Yeah, he’s a dragon.” There was a short pause. Dean even pulled his phone away from his ear to check and see if the call had been dropped. “Uh, Bobby?”
“The monster was talking to him?” the woman asked. Dean could tell she had tried to refrain from sounding condescending, but it didn’t really work out.
“What is what?” he asked, trying to remove her death grip. It was one thing when she was just ruining his shirt, but this
“Hey,” Charlie protested. “It’s called being fair-skinned. And it comes with the territory of being a badass redhead, alright?”
“Oh, that’s right,” Dean said. “He just said that he didn’t like mine.”
“I love you, too, Cas.”
“No, not until you come hang out with us!” He put his knuckles on Sam’s head.
Sam’s stomach sank. “What? I don’t know where he is,” he said quickly.
Sam gritted his teeth and decided to drive the rest of the way home in silence. He wasn’t mad at Jess, he was mad at himself. Because Jess was right. Dean wasn’t the person that Sam thought he was. Maybe… maybe he didn’t have the whole story.
. We wouldn’t have to hide anything! Just you and me, Cas. That’s all I need.”
Bobby raised an unimpressed brow. “Did I say you should have stayed?” he asked. “Because I think the best thing you ever did was leave your daddy behind. You made something of yourself, Sam. And I’m damn proud of your for it, don’t ever think I’m not.”
“For not even pretending to be sorry for the mess you’ve gotten us into.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “It can cool off in my stomach.” He walked past Cas to lay his eyes on the lopsided pie. Any self respecting baker would have shuddered at the sight, but Dean merely beamed. “What possessed you to make a pie?” he asked. “I never figured you for taking up baking. Krav Maga, maybe. Hell, even gardening. Isn’t that what your buddy Joshua did?”
Sam couldn’t help but to wish that something like that would have been possible.  “Come on, Bobby,” he said. “You did everything you could. I mean. A lot of my favorite memories are here. You, Dean and me when you just let us be kids. You did a lot more than you think you did.”
“It’s not—“ Cas sighed. “I already told you: I was simply trying to get a better look at something and I... slipped. It’s not that exciting of a story.”
“Perhaps it would be best if we all just sat here in silence,” Cas suggested. “At least until our problem is resolved.”
Ten minutes later Dean was plating pancakes and placing one in front of Cas, dropping a kiss to his unruly head of hair.
The pinks and purples in the sky were a strange contrast to the dull grey skin of his adversary, but the crumbled building he stood atop as flames licked their way towards his feet were a perfect match. Castiel thought they would look at home together in hell.
Cas pulled Dean into a tight hug and Dean just deflated, burrowing himself as deep as he could into Cas’ embrace and letting out the sobs that he had successfully kept in thus far.
Jo slapped a hand over Charlie’s mouth. “Shut up!” she hissed.
Dean tightened the arm he had around Cas. “Sorry.” He gave him another kiss on the side of his head. “You saved me, babe. You don’t have to think about any what ifs.”
“Ugh, that’s not the point, Cas,” Dean told him.
“Dean,” Cas said, knocking on his door. “May I speak with you for a moment?”
Cas pushed beyond the next few trees and his heart skipped a beat. Dean was safe. And holding up a twisted, humanoid head. Cas looked down and saw a body to match, tentacles and coiled skin wrapping around each other in a shape that only gave the most vague impression of a human.
“Perhaps we should make room for those who are actually dancing.” Cas’ fingers were playing with the short hair on the back of Dean’s head.
“Yeah, but…” Dean extended his arm as far as it would go, landing just a couple inches short of the hard plastic of the remote.
“Yeah,” Dean grunted.
Dean immediately smacked his hand over Cas’ mouth. “Hey, you swore!”
Dean crossed his heart. “Got it.”
is here.”
John narrowed his eyes. “I think we have more pressing problems than your girlfriend throwing a little hissy fit over a missed lunch date.”
Dean grabbed up the sodas, chips dangling from two fingers. “Can’t you just drop it forever?”
“Yeah, man,” Dean said. “Give him a taste of his own medicine.”
“Is him being my husband not a good enough reason?” Dean asked.
Dean let out a soft sigh. “Tomorrow’s going to suck.”
Cas shook his head. “You’re offering this to me now? After all these years of fighting? My whole life has been spent fighting you and now you think I’ll join you?”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Because I left my phone at our
Dean let out a long sigh before sitting up, pulling his now bandaged arm back to his own lap. “It’s alright, Sammy. It’s not your fault that dad’s an asshole.”
“Look, you were the favorite, okay?” Sam burst into laughter, but Dean continued over him. “You were the favorite,” he repeated, louder, “so you don’t know how bad he could get.”
Dean sighed. He was getting a little tired of these surprise talk attacks.
Charlie peeked over her laptop and saw Dean peering intently at his own. She could only see the Rebel Alliance sticker adorning the front of his computer and not his actual screen, but she knew exactly what he was looking at. “Are you on Cas’ blog again?”
Cas shook his head but couldn’t hide his smile.
Cas walked into the room, a hint of pink coloring his cheeks. “Hello, Dean.” He turned to look at Sam. “I see your brother is taking full advantage of the situation.”
By the time dessert rolled around, Charlie and Dean had gotten into an argument about something or other in the newest Star Trek movie, and Cas finally had someone share an exasperated look with.
Charlie just laughed. “He’s just totally horrified that I’m telling you,” she said with a glance back at Dean who, she could see even from this distance, had a bright red blush covering his entire face, which he was still trying to hide. “But I’m sorry, I couldn’t take the barely missed stares of longing anymore. It had to end.”
“Dean,” Gabe said. “I know you love my baby bro and all, but this is just getting ridicu—“
“I don’t want to leave, Dean—“
“So, uh,” Dean started, “let’s not tell Charlie about this.”
“Right,” Sam said. He stood in front of them awkwardly, like he was about to give a speech he hadn’t prepared. Clearing his throat, he started off with, “Okay, well,” and then all in a rush, “I may have called dad last night when I was drunk but I really didn’t think he’d come—hell, I don’t even remember calling him. I just woke up and he was at the door. And I’m really sorry, alright? It’s just—you—you wouldn’t answer any of my calls or texts, man.”
“Shut up, Dean. I’m not in the mood for your half-hearted apologies.”
“Cas,” Dean sighed. “That wasn’t—I just needed some readjustment time. That djinn really threw me for a loop, you know?”
Okay, Cas was a star.
“But in a good way!” Charlie quickly added. “It’s cheesy in the best way. It’s heartfelt.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “I’m sorry, did she hurt your feelings or are you just mad that Charlie won the argument?”
Cas sighed. “When I told you I’d rather go with you. I—I thought that maybe it was a date. Well, no, actually I didn’t think that’s what it was until after at Charlie’s.”
Cas did so with enthusiasm, only stopping to look over at Sam who was glaring at Dean.
“Alright,” Cas said, grabbing his keys off of the table next to the door. “Call me if you get any psychic vibrations while I’m out.”
of it.”
“Speaking of getting knocked up,” Jo said, closing the fridge door with a soft
“Why not?” she asked with a shrug. “He’d totally say yes.”
Dean let a small grin pull at the corner of his mouth. “You—uh—you were there,” he told him, looking away. “In the djinn dream, I mean.” Cas nodded but didn’t say anything, so Dean continued, “Sammy was there, too. He was happy. He, uh,” Dean paused to clear his throat, “he was trying to convince us to get a dog.”
Cas sighed. “Your birthday is coming up,” he said. “Sam was going to take me to the mall and help me pick out a present for you.”
“No, like,” Dean rubbed a hand over his face. “Like, do you ever wonder sometimes whether all the things we killed deserved it?”
“Dean!” Sam hissed. “Come on, I have to meet Jess in like twenty minutes!”
“So?” Jo asked. “That doesn’t mean I’m not going to help get Sam back. And if you guys are crazy enough to think that fighting an imaginary monster is the way to do it, then I’m with you.” She glared around at them, daring one of them to comment. But the other three stayed silent. Dean nodded and tried to focus on keeping his breathing steady.
Dean kicked Sam under the table, hard, and said loudly to cover Sam’s yelp of pain, “I think Jo’s mom needed her to help out with something before she could come and Charlie was caught up with some video game or something. They’ll be here later, though, so it’s not really a big deal.” Dean shrugged to play up the nonchalance.
“Good,” Cas nodded. He took his marshmallows away from the flames and turned to Dean expectantly.
Charlie blushed but she forced the smile off of her face. “Umm…”
Castiel woke up exhausted. Castiel
“Seriously, Cas?” Sam flung his hands up in frustration and then upon realizing more eyes were turning towards the commotion, he sunk down as far as he could without sliding off of his seat.
“Gabriel told me,” Cas replied, matter of fact.
Dean, who had been determinedly trying to ignore the whole proceeding, perked up at that, face flushing red.
“Fine,” Sam conceded. “Fine. We won’t talk about it. We’ll just sit here and drink our beers and you can brood in silence.”
Jess sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Then talk to him. That’s all you can do.”
“It will tonight.” Dean looked over Charlie’s head to the clock across the room. He needed to get to sleep. “So if you can leave now and cover for me in the morning, that would be great, thanks.” He tried pushing her towards the door but she just walked further into his house. “Charlie, seriously, I have to go.”
“You don’t sound too happy about that,” Dean said, still trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.
Bobby rolled his eyes and opened the door wider for the three men standing on his stoop to come in. All three were sprayed liberally with holy water upon entering.
“Then where did the boys go?” Cas asked.
“Only if you admit that you started it,” Cas said, putting his hands on Dean’s shoulders to stop him from getting closer.
Cas shrugged. “Yes, but he’s probably stopping to wash his hands, not make out with his boyfriend.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Whatever, Sammy. I bet you’re just tired of getting embarrassed in front of your little girlfriend.” He grabbed his cup and the jug of orange juice to pour into it.
“Mom?” Jo laughed. “She’s the one keeping the books.”
“I know, I know,” Dean sighed. “I hid it from him, how could he have known, blah, blah, blah.” He turned to Cas with water filled eyes. “It was so easy for him to think I was just getting into fights all the time, you know? That’s me. Big dumb brute who can’t go two days without throwing a punch.” He let out a bitter laugh. “Just some horny teenager beating one out in the bathroom while his dad and brother were on the other side of the door.”
“What’s the magic word?” Dean asked, doubling the pressure.
He realized a few moments later with an unpleasant jolt to his stomach that Dean probably wouldn’t ever read his comment, since they were only sharing the book for the day.  Well, it was done now. At least Dean would never find out.
“He didn’t mean anything,” Dean said quickly. “You know how dad was. You don’t think that shit qualifies as hurting us?”
Dean looked down and saw that both of them had bloody hands pressed to Cas’ side to staunch the flow of blood.
He took a quick shower and threw on some clothes before heading downstairs to grab some coffee. He basically lived off the stuff.
“Definitely wait until Cas gets here,” Sam continued as if he didn’t hear Dean at all. “It’ll be like a two-for-one. Do you think Gabe would come and help me out with it?”
Sam threw up all over the hardwood floor.
“This is insane,” Sam told them. Then, “Wait. What if you died first?”
Cas continued to sneak out to meet Dean for their nightly stargazing, and for the most part they were back to their original no speaking policy. However, now it was enforced by the fact that they had found a much better use for their mouths than words.
“And no rolling your eyes,” he added.
“Fair enough,” Charlie said, sinking back into her seat.
“Here I am, fielding calls from him and your dad the past five years, then you go ahead and invite Sam over to dinner and I don’t get so much as a phone call?”
“And what—what’s that?”
“Yo, Sammy!” Dean called from another room. “Hurry up, man! Time to go pick out a tree!”
“Cas,” Dean choked out, grabbing onto the sleeves of his trench coat to hold him in place, so close he could still smell the hint of coffee from his morning cup. The taste of it was still pressed into his lips and Dean thought for one crazy moment that it tasted better than pie.
the ground that he landed on.
“I don’t know,” she said. “Mr. Finley just called and said that he would be bringing it by tomorrow instead of today. I think it was a mix up at the towing service.”
A loud crack rent the air and then a shriek so loud both Cas and Dean dropped what they were holding to slap their hands over their ears. A bright white flash blinded them both for a moment and then the two of them were blasted backwards as his adversary exploded into the air.
He rubbed the tears out of his eyes with his palms.
“You wanna come with, Sammy?” Dean asked.
“Are you sure I shouldn’t be calling the cops?” she asked.
to leave,” Dean mocked. “But you always do.”
“Cas!” Dean shouted, his cheeks turning red before Cas’ eyes
Dean blushed an even brighter red at that.
Cas shrugged again.
“He was coming after you,” Cas said. “I had to do something.”
“Sweet,” Charlie said. “Now I don’t have to go outside at all. I’m glad you finally came to your senses.”
is my brother.”
“Maybe we can win the lotto and then we can both be trophy husbands,” Dean suggested.
“I’ll walk you to your door,” he said.
“I can’t just do nothing,” Sam insisted.
“Guess we’d better get to class,” Dean said, handing Cas his book.
SQUASHED
“I don’t know,” Cas said, opening his door and sliding into the car as Dean got into the driver’s seat. “Her reasoning was sound. You rely too much on emotional manipulations. You need to deal more in logical and factual information if you want to beat her.”
Cas looked into his adversary’s eyes and watched as the flames dispersed over his skin, leaving no trace they had ever been there. And then his adversary’s face began to change, which wasn’t the most shocking thing for Cas to see happen since it was a shapeshifter, but the face it took on did leave Cas’ jaw hanging.
“Yeah,” Dean said slowly. “My letterman jacket.” He put a hand on Cas’ forehead. “You feeling okay? I mean, I know you were moaning my name pretty loud a few minutes ago, did it hurt your hearing?”
“Let me what?” he asked. “I literally own this place. There’s no way in hell my baby brother is going to pay for a meal here.”
The words echoed in the cavernous war room, taunting Dean, each repetition more pathetic sounding than the last. And Cas just stood there, staring at him with his head cocked to the side in that way that was just purely, stupidly
“Okay, no one’s taking bets, but I’m pretty sure Gabe tried to.” Charlie sighed and gave Dean a push. “Go on,” she said. “Get this over with. Sheesh, it’s like waiting for Ron and Hermione to get a clue over here.” She gave him another, slightly harder push and he stumbled a bit before straightening and glaring at her. “Okay, okay. Go at your own pace. I’ll just be over here dying of old age.”
Sam just shrugged. “Maybe he does Krav Maga or something.”
“They’re not,” Cas said, stepping up next to Dean. “Let them go.”
“Dig in,” he said.
Dean gasped, still trying to get his breathing back under control. Cas crossed the space between them in a few steps and sat down next to him, hugging him close. “Breathe with me, Dean.”
Sam smiled. “That’s a nice sentiment, Bobby, but I really don’t think dad would have let you just take us.”
Cas sighed. Dean wasn’t acting any different than usual… Maybe Cas had gotten lucky and he hadn’t seen.
“Cas said, ‘If he tries to hurt you
“Wait,” Dean said, hurrying to get his crutches situated so he could follow. “Is that a yes? It’s not a no, right?”
Cas turned towards the staircase and began making his way up. Gabriel had tried confronting him that morning about his dream, but Cas had taken off in such a hurry he didn’t even think he’d said a word to Gabe on his way out. Cas was not looking forward to the conversation they were surely about to have.
Silence fell between them, broken only by the sound of the breeze through the leaves and on the ripples of the water. Even their minds seemed quiet, filled only with the soft buzz of their Bond.
“Yeah, so? I did the same to Cas. He wouldn’t crack, but you will. You’re soft.”
"Dean," Sam groaned. "I just don't want to."
Sam swallowed at Cas’ ominous tone and turned to the road.
Dean grumbled to himself, probably about how they all
The others nodded in agreement. The three students thought to be responsible for the prank had yet to return home. Dean thought it was a pretty excessive reaction to avoid what would probably be a stern talking to. But apparently it also wasn’t exactly unusual for them to take off for a few days at a time, and according to their parents they had been planning a road trip to celebrate their graduation. And since they had been banned from walking in the commencement ceremony for ditching the last day and presumably pulling the monster prank, their parents figured they skipped out a couple days early.
“What’s wrong?” she asked, pausing once she realized he wasn’t following her.
Dean grinned at him.
“But, babe—“
Dean sighed and shouldered the fridge closed. “It’s a little hard to ask someone to a dance with your dorky little brother cramping your style.”
“Jo, obviously,” Cas said. “Since she owes Charlie ten dollars.”
“Hey, you’re the one that walked out on me!” Dean shouted. “I begged you not to go.”
“How was work?” Cas asked, placing a bookmark on his page and laying his book aside.
“It’s like nothing else Cas, it’s better than ecstasy, or sex, like I steal their energy or something. I don’t know, maybe I’m just fucked in the head, got my wires crossed a ways back. Killin’ shouldn’t be like that, should it?”
“Are there any cold spots in the house?”
“It’s probably just some faulty wiring.”
Orgasm denial
A ghostly arm threw Cas across the room. Dean pulled the gun from his belt and shot a salt round at the transparent figure, which disappeared as the bullet made contact. He hurried across the room and helped Cas to his feet.
"Thanks," he chuckled and took a long gulp, then looked at the bottle as he twirled it in his hands. "It's been a long day."
Dean shook his head.
"You have a book?"
"I can see your longing, it shines out of you. I could take you against this wall, right now, I could make you come so hard you'd forget your own name. Have you bare and broken and beautiful, exposed before the world. Someone could wander into this corridor, see you opened up before me, and they would know you are mine. Maybe I would share, if I was feeling kind, I don't think you would tell them no, I don't think you could resist any demand I made of you. Or perhaps I should keep you for myself, my filthy little fuck toy. So subservient. Would you like that? Well would you, boy?"
It was a large plug, almost as large as Castiel himself, and Cas knew that every time it jostled within him Dean would know those words to be true.
(just let me duck any projectiles being thrown in my general direction)
Murderous intent
“Fine.”
He tripped slightly on his feet. He barely managed to resist the urge to stay, eager to see Cas pull himself up on the chains, nervous that he would drop the key during the gymnastics that would be necessary. He made a mental note to come back in a day or two, just to be sure.
“What’s so funny?”
He made his way towards the door, taking one step at a time, intensely focused on his feet, unsure how they were staying on the ground when everything was upside down.
Dean repeated the words a few times in his head, not sure what it was that was making him trip over them, then it dawned on him.
The last thing John saw before a trigger was pulled and the life drained from his eyes was his son breaking down in tears, and perhaps that was the most unforgivable thing of all.
"You can do better than that," Cas was definitely mocking now. Dean gulped and continued.
“Yeah yeah, I’ll do your stupid ass makeup; just never tell anyone I said that.”
Cas was shaking.
“I was going to give you a choice of punishment, but since you decided to question me,” Dean opened his mouth, presumably to refute the charges being levelled at him, but Cas silenced him with a look, “and don’t think for a second I didn’t hear the sass in your tone,” Dean was panting slightly, arousal glazing his eyes, “I don’t think you deserve that accommodation.”

Cas crossed back to their position against the wall, smiling as he took the spliff from his hand and relit it. He snaked an arm around Dean’s waist and pulled them flush together. Dean’s breath caught in his throat.
Dean smiled.
And with that he left, Dean choking on his coffee as he went.
Dean still listened to the messages, no matter how much they hurt him. He couldn't seem to resist. Sam hadn't called, not in a long time. It was like freedom, and a length of rope. Bobby, on the other hand, was persistent.
“Cas, is this-“
“Shut up jerk.”
He just wanted to go to sleep. He didn’t suppose that would prevent Uriel from destroying him. At least then he might get some peace.
“Cas, please wake up. I need you. I need you so much I can barely breathe. You can have me Cas, of course you can have me, you’ve always had me. I thought you- I thought we- I love you too. Come back to me my angel. Please. Please. Anyone, anything that can hear me, bring him back. Bring him home. Come home Castiel, come home-“
“You’re right, it does. Enough blood has been shed.”
“I shall avoid that in the future, I promise I will pay attention as I rip your head from your shoulders.”
Dean slowly breathed out, watching tendrils of smoke dance and disperse. He looked up at the overcast sky, wondered if that was what the clouds looked like up close, not that he ever intended to get high enough to find out, not in that sense at least.
Cas raised an eyebrow.
Cas had known what the answer would be, but he still wondered at the self loathing. Ah well, he was here to oblige. There was every chance of it being a last wish after all, whether Dean knew it or not.
Strangely enough, there are none
His clothes were roughly torn from him, buttons probably popping from his favourite shirt, but Dean couldn't care less. There wasn't even a pause as the knife was discovered and tossed aside. Dean had the fleeting thought that he should be alarmed by that, surely normal people had some reaction to finding weaponry tucked beneath someone's clothing, but potential danger seemed immaterial with a warm, unexpectedly strong, body pressing him into the bed. He'd fought off attackers while naked before, both homophobes and enemies, he could do it again.
It was a struggle not to flinch at the lies.
No, this was not the way he dreamed. Everything was too clear, every detail perfect in its imperfection.
Dean laughed, the sound bitter enough to make him wince.
“I’ve been meaning to sort this mess out.”
“I hate you.” He really wished he could summon more anger, the words just sounded wrong when they were directed at Cas.
Dean shuffled awkwardly, unsure of himself now that he’d achieved his goal.
Proof that listening to that one song by Maroon 5 while writing is dangerous
“I just… It just…” He couldn’t find the words.
Yet being the operative word. He could feel the traps being set, the danger looming in the distance. For all he knew, it could already be too late.
This had better not take too long. There were things he needed to finish.
“Why? We’re gonna end up killing each other. Ain’t no point in talking to the dead.”
“For a dom, you certainly seem to enjoy the loss of choice.”
“Don’t wanna be alone.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, nervous as he hadn’t seen him before. There was something different, something raw, about the way they reached for one another. The yearning was visceral, in a way that clearly made Dean uncomfortable, yet he allowed himself to be revealed when once he would have run.
“Nah,” Dean forced a grin, but it wavered far too quickly to have the desired effect, “fair’s fair, you didn’t kill me last night. Sorry to love ya and leave ya, but I’ve gotta bounce. I just don’t think this relationship or whatever the fuck we’ve had is gonna work out. So, uh, adios. Let’s never see each other again.”
"Are you alright Dean?"
“You’re right, it wouldn’t.”
He didn’t expect Castiel to get the reference, it was a personal indulgence, one that made him smile like the Cheshire Cat, before he realised his teeth might be visible in the gloom.
“Glad to have you back man,” Sam leaned forward and clapped Cas on the shoulder, squeezing for a moment, before letting them go.
Cas’ expression softened.
Dom/sub undertones
Even now, even in death, Cas was his rock. The rocks of the shore he was about to be crushed against, perhaps, but solid ground none the less. He’d been floating so long.
"Truly. Best birthday present ever."
"Abso-fuckin-lutely. I've wanted this, you, for years. Forever." Dean tried to stop his voice wavering at a sudden swell of utterly unwelcome emotion. "Now, do you wanna see me in my birthday present or what?"
Dean looked up at him, so open, so trusting. Cas flipped him onto his front to hide the expression, pulling off his tie and binding him to the bed. For a killer he was horribly easy to restrain. Cas’ heart sank even as he tied the length of silk around his wrists. He wondered if Dean could feel the wire that rested within, he doubted he could, but this knot certainly wouldn’t break, no matter how hard Dean struggled.
“I think I got him,” Dean said with a proud little grin.
“It’s his birthday,” Dean replied.
“Eh, not super noble,” Dean said. “I mean, by the point you’ll realize you’ll need the therapy we’ll probably have a joint bank account, so really, I’m just looking out for my own money.”
Dean turned back around, his own cheeks still red from his admission. “So we’re even,” Dean told him with a shy smile that Cas returned. “And hey, I guess you sort of granted two of my wishes tonight.”
“Sammy,” Dean said. “Sammy, it’s me. It’s Dean and Cas and Charlie and Jo. Come on, man.”
When he finally managed to wrench the door open, it was to face the last person on earth he expected to see at his door.
“So, about that dance…?”
Cas looked down at what Dean had given him. A heart shaped card with
Dean kept chuckling to himself as he went about looking for the rest of the things on his list. Once he’d finished and wandered back to the house, Cas was up and sitting at the dining room table nursing a cup of coffee and looking like he wished he could inject caffeine straight into his bloodstream.
Dean shrugged. “Dunno,” he said. “Something awesome, though.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked. “So how long has this,” he gestured his hand between the two of them, “been going on?”
“Hey, I resent th—
Cas rolled his eyes, again, and pulled Dean towards him by the neck of his shirt. “Then let’s make the most of the alone time we do have.”
“Dean,” Cas said. “I think you’re forgetting who my brother is.”
“Hear what?” Dean yawned. He had woken up to Cas’ knocking.
“When did dad say he’d meet us here?” Dean asked, slamming his door closed a little more forcefully than necessary. He gave the hood a pat in a belated apology.
“What, you think I hallucinated him or something?” Sam asked, looking up.
Cas wiped a hand down his face as Dean audibly gulped.
“’Course,” Dean said, handing the plates to Cas and going to grab the cups.
Dean's face heated up, but Cas just shrugged. "I'm sure we'll be able to reign in our raging teenage hormones for your sake, Sam. If not, Gabriel has taken to squirting us with a water bottle when he says we get too close."
“They’re gathering everyone to start,” he said next. “You ready?”
self-control, jeez.”
“Dude,” Dean said, walking into the kitchen. “Do I smell pie?”
“Please, man,” the doctors and nurses would hear him whisper, “you can’t go out like this. Not like this.” Quiet, miserable laughter, and then, “You are going to be fucking pissed if you let this be the end.” A dry sob disguised as a cough. “Just a dumb salt and burn.”
Dean chewed on his lip. “Well, have you?”
Cas just flashed him a smirk and disappeared into the kitchen.
They all laughed at that.
Sam swung by the florist on his way home. He had sort of made it up to Dean and Cas for his drunken call to his father, but Jess had been witness to the whole messy debacle of him actually being a drunk jackass. He figured that a bouquet of mixed flowers (he could pick out a Gerber Daisy and the pink roses, but he had no idea what the others were, just that they looked nice together) could be the first step in what he was sure was going to be a multi-step apology.
“You know it takes at least two to have the crazy hotel sex, right?” Dean called after him.
“Took you idjits long enough,” Bobby said in lieu of greeting.
Gabe held his hands up in surrender. “Hey, it’s your life we’re dealing with.”
John Winchester stood a few feet in front of Charlie’s desk, looking both awkward and intimidating.
“But what?” Jo demanded. “But all of a sudden monsters are real?”
“Oh, sure, yeah, of course,” Dean said. “So, uh, what the hell are you?”
. He would have to remember to laugh about that later.
Cas tried backing away, getting back towards the hole they crashed through and gravity, but his adversary grabbed him by the arm and held him in place. Cas still had a grip on his blade but he knew he wouldn’t be quick enough to stab him and he feared getting disarmed since he wasn’t sure he had the strength to manifest a new weapon.
“Congratulations,” Cas told her.
Cas just smiled. “What kind of pie would you like?”
Dean just accepted it. It was hardly the worst thing that could have happened to him, and the doctors were hopeful that things could someday turn around for him. And even if it never did, well, it’s not like he didn’t deserve worse. And besides, it’s not like he really remembered long enough to get really worked up about it.
“Wouldn’t I?” Dean asked, evil grin in place.
“Cas?” His head was cocked to the side again.
“Usually,” Cas replied, his mouth still full.
“Alright, alright,” Dean grabbed his wand and flicked it. “It was a simple hex.”
“Seriously?” Sam cut in.
“Spelled glass is some powerful stuff. What the hell kind of present you giving him?”
John’s face hardened. “Then I’ll do it on my own.”
“Dean doesn’t seem like one to turn his nose up at some cheap chocolate, but okay. I’m with you. You got your boy some gourmet chocolates. Hey, if he turns you down, can I have them? I’ve always wanted to try some fancy shmancy confections. But you know my motto, quantity is quality.”
Dean scoffed, offended. “Jeez, Cas, I’m not that old,” he said. “I just can’t read this dude’s writing.” He threw the paper away, where it spun gracefully through the air and landed on the end of the bed. “Next time I’m not accepting any handwritten applications. Online and typed resumes only.” He rubbed the heel of his palm over his eyes.
Cas nodded thoughtfully. “Perhaps we should relocate to Charlie’s house and ask to play games wither, then. It’s quite hot out here.”
“Just,” Mary stopped and sighed again.
Dean had been unconscious for three days now. It was unsettling seeing so many tubes and IVs hanging off of him, the constant sounds of beeping breaking the sounds of his breath by machine.
“He invited us to dinner. At Lafitte’s.”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he said, voice cracking. “Fuck, baby, I’m so sorry.” He leaned his forehead against the cool steering wheel.
“Cas! Hey, Cas!”
“Jeez, Dean,” Sam said, prying Dean’s hand away from his now most certainly bruised arm. “I thought you said you were going to be cool.”
Cas squinted and tilted his head. “I don’t think that’s a step up.”
Cas felt his heart drop. “What?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Agreed. I’ll start looking for the shackles. You start looking for the wolves.”
“I mean, why didn’t we think of buying in bulk before?” Dean asked, shoving some more steaks in the freezer.
“What do you mean ‘again’?” Sam cut in, and Dean and Cas both jumped, having forgotten for a moment he was still there.
“What?” Dean spluttered. “You can’t just declare yourself the winner!”
Cas grumbled, cracking one eye open to look at Dean’s angry bordering on confused expression.
“I didn’t say that,” Bobby told him. “I’m only trying to say that you don’t have to keep hunting just because it’s what you think you should do. You have an out. No one would blame you if you took it.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Dean, I am going to the store today.”
Meg laughed. “You’re going with Dean?”
Dean sighed and pulled Cas closer with the grip on his wrist and rested their foreheads together. “I do miss them when they’re hidden,” he said softly, reaching out and running a hand up the leathery skin on one wing and trailing it along the deep blue scales at the top. “I know I’m being paranoid about all of this.”
“Good to meet you, boy,” he replied, taking his hand and giving it a firmer-than-necessary shake.
. Fuck!” He slammed his hands down on the steering wheel, murmuring an apology to his baby a second later.
Cas cursed as he looked around but all he could see were trees, static with the lack of wind. If Cas was going to give his adversary so many hiding spots he was at least going to make it easier on himself to spot any movement.
Dean pursed his lips and nodded. “Right. So what is this big lead, then? Was it bigfoot?”
“Yes, sir, Mr. Novak,” the gawky man replied, and with a slight bow, left the room, closing the door behind himself.
“Well, I guess after the dance I will.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Obviously. But you started the flirting. You told me I was ‘pretty.’”
“What? Not even old age?”
“Whoa there, kiddo. What’d that poor phone ever do to you?” Charlie asked him.
Dean turned to Cas once Mary was down the hall. “You really don’t want to make out with me, huh?” he asked, but he was smiling.
“Perfect,” Cas said, looking around at the now practically deserted bakery. “I’m starving.”
Dean smacked his arm lightly. “I was going to start peeling apples to try and help out, jackass.”
He noticed that the rope Sam was working on was getting looser instead of tighter.
“Where’s Sam?” Dean called, taking a step forward.
He wanted to reply with a
“So you think they all deserved it? All the creatures we killed?”
Dean could feel his heart swelling in his chest.
“So,” Charlie said, clapping her hands together. “Where to? Park? Movies? Two steps over to the couch?”
Charlie informed them that Dean’s phone had stopped moving and gave them the coordinates.
The world got a little fuzzier and he refused to admit it was because his eyes were now shining with unshed tears. He just chalked it up to being the drunkest he had ever been in his life. Which was true.
He changed tact and called Cas instead who answered on the first ring. “Sam.” His voice was tense.
“Great, you’re protected against demons,” Bobby scoffed. “You know how many other things are out there?”
“Yes, Dean?” Cas turned his head to stare at the side of his best friend’s face. Dean didn’t reciprocate, but Cas had the feeling that he wouldn’t be able to go on if he did.
Dean shifted in embarrassment. Of course this dude was like the nicest, most conscientious guy ever. “S’alright,” he slurred. “S’okay.”
Mary looked concernedly towards the hall where Sam’s room was and sighed. “I’ll go get him,” she said. “But can you two please do something with him after dinner? Video games or a movie or just something?”
“Put it in port three and tell Andy to take a look at it. I’ll take over when I finish with all this damn pencil pushing,” Dean finally said.
“I like the song,” Dean mumbled into his shirt.
“Cas, I swear to god, if you suggest what I think you’re going to suggest,” Dean cut him off.
“Happy birthday, Cas!” Dean exclaimed. He had considered getting a blow horn to really commemorate the situation, but ultimately decided against it. In the morning, that much loud noise would be nothing but annoying, even if it was celebratory.
let them go to Burger Palace. Gabriel was the only reason Cas had ever even been there, sneaking them out every time he came for a visit. Cas would take Gabe’s teasing and pranks if it meant he got The Burger Palace.
“This book says a blade dipped in holy water will destroy anything evil,” Cas said. “I’m sure it could work on the monster.”
“There’s one more thing wrong with that plan,” Cas said.
“His name is Azazel.”
“Just let me say what I came here to say,” Dean said.
Cas glared. “Both.”
Dean fell asleep around midnight, sprawled on the couch where they had been watching Star Trek reruns. Cas watched as a puddle of drool formed on the couch cushion below Dean’s open mouth, willing himself to find it disgusting so that he could get over his ridiculous crush. The flirtations were obviously just a joke to Dean so it was past time that Cas got some sense and treated it the same. But try as he might, he could only find his best friend’s drooling cute. God help him, he found it downright adorable.
The four of them slowly made their way into the trees, the humid air sticking the shirts to their backs while the occasional chill rang up their spine. They were silent as they moved, sticking to the path they all remembered taking when they were in fifth grade. The four beams of their flashlights swung this way and that as they tried to search for anything.
Sam’s eyebrows shot into his hair. “Uh, well seeing what you’re capable of, thanks?”
Cas let go of his grip on Dean’s hair and fisted both of his hands in his letterman jacket. “I like being president of the chess club,” he growled.
Dean realized then that the odd wheezing sound he heard beneath the roaring in his ears was his own breathing.
“But that’s the thing, Cas,” Dean breathed. “I’m the boss. We can take as long as we like.” He leaned in to close the distance, but Cas pulled back.
“Whoa, there, Dean-o,” Jo said. “What’s got you so jumpy? It’s the last day, it’s not like there’s a test you forgot to cram for.”
“Goddamnit, Cas,” Dean said. “If you didn’t have this stupid overprotective thing this never would have happened.”
, Dean told him furiously.
“Charlie?” Dean asked.
“Good,” Cas said. “That’s around when Gabriel will be coming back as well.”
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean replied. “Uh, long time no see, I guess, huh?”
“Shit,” Dean said. “Guess we’re a little late for class, huh?”
Bobby had his coffee cup halfway to his mouth, but he was staring at Dean with a face somewhere between concern and amusement.
He slammed the door of the impala and wasn’t even in the right frame of mind to apologize as he marched up to his house with Cas right on his heels.
Cas tilted his head. “And yet we spend most of our free time at her house,” he said, turning to open his locker back up.
Cas quickly grabbed up his pen and wrote,
“How long until he gets here?” Cas asked, seeing that Dean was still in shock. “Maybe we could just leave.”
“Much better than you did today,” Cas told him, his voice serious. “There was no yelling, for one.”
Dean wouldn’t tell anyone about what had happened in his djinn induced fantasy. Sam and Cas wouldn’t have minded so much, but Dean was acting weird. Every time Sam so much as opened his mouth, Dean was huffing his way out of the room with a clipped, “Not going to talk about it.” But at least he didn’t have it as bad as Cas who Dean wouldn’t even look at. Whenever Dean so much as glimpsed a five o’clock shadow or rumpled bed head, he was spinning on his heel and marching a hasty retreat to his room. With his back turned he never saw the look of hurt and confusion cross his best friend’s face. But Sam did.
“Because we’ve never had a reason to avoid the store before.”
Bobby stopped and turned to face him. “That ain’t what this is, son.”
“Hey, hey,” Dean said, bringing Sam in close and hugging him. “It’s okay, dude. Plenty of people sleepwalk, I’m sure. We’ll just have to get a lock for your door, huh?” He tried for a laugh, but Sam kept on shaking in his arms. “Maybe it’s just something you ate. I mean, I’ve never seen someone eat so many Pixie Stix in one sitting before. And you washed it down with a big ol’ glass of Dr. Pepper. That’s gotta do something to a person’s insides.”
Dean didn’t know why Cas would think that, Dean was hardly good company right now, but he couldn’t help but to agree with the sentiment since a warmth was spreading through him just from Cas’ shy smile.
Dean snorted and rubbed a hand over his mouth, turning watery eyes back on Cas. “Seriously?”
“It turns out your father somehow found the Sword of Bruncvik.”
Jo answered by taking those two steps and plopping herself down onto the couch.
"Don't you 'what' me, Castiel Novak," Dean said.
“You boys parked in the back, so he shouldn’t see it. If he sees it then I’ll stop him.”
Dean gritted his teeth. “No.”
“So what’s it like?” Dean asked after a handful of moments had passed in silence. “Being a wishing star?”
“Sorry,” Cas purred into his ear. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“I’ll go grab the beer,” he said, seriously. “You are not leaving this house, not while there’s a hunter in tow—Hey, can I get an extra-large meat lovers for delivery?”
Mary came back then, Sam following behind her.
Andy rolled his eyes. “I never should have told you about that.”
“It is true, Cas,” Dean went on. “You didn’t grow up with him, alright? When he was little,” a hint of a smile cracked his mouth upwards, but it disappeared almost as soon as it appeared, “I could tell that he looked up to me, you know? Always asking me questions and trying to be like me. I pretended it was annoying. Who wouldn’t? Everyone’s supposed to be annoyed by their little brother, right?” He paused. “But I fucking loved it. It made me feel good, to—to have someone think I was worth something.”
Cas huffed and turned his body to face away from the others.
“I don’t,” Cas said quickly. “I’ve just had a bad morning. Gabriel insisted on braving Starbucks.”
“No,” Cas replied, making a smooth exit out of the car. “You’re being ridiculous and I wish to speak to your brother about it.”
Dean’s mouth formed an ‘o’ of realization. He cast his eyes down and scuffed his shoe on the floor. “So, when you said that you were leaving…”
“That thing has your head all warped,” John sighed, pausing in his painting to look up at Dean sadly. “I’m breaking your bond.”
“Should I start singing now, or wait until Cas is here?” Sam asked himself.
Both of them froze and looked at each other before quickly looking away.
“What are we doing?” Dean’s voice was back to squeaking. “Um, uh… just, you know… hanging out?” His voice went higher at the end, turning what should have been a statement into a question.
Cas laughed and tried to school his features. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he said, unable to wipe the gummy smile from his face. “Go on.”
pouring out of his nose. He knew the situation wasn’t humorous in the slightest, but oh my god, Cas actually had
Dean grinned. “Need me to be your fake boyfriend again?” he asked, leaning down to give Cas a quick peck on the lips.
, freaking Charlie). Why didn’t anyone ever warn him that owning his own shop meant he had to do all the boring shit like paperwork? He just wanted to get under the hood of a car and get to work. Leave everything behind and just let an engine speak to him.
“The only thing we can do,” Dean said, taking the knife from Cas in a hand still slippery and warm from his blood. “Try not to hurt the kids. Well, maybe the high schoolers. They did try and scare Sammy.”
Sam’s heart began beating a little faster. “Does Dean know?”
“And to think I came here to try and cheer you up,” Dean grumbled.
“Dean, please promise me you won’t be weird about this.” Sam stared at him, on the verge of one of his bitch faces. They were standing in front of a fake hospital room, three walls housing a couple of beds, heart monitors and IVs. “Jess won’t be able to get you back on set if you freak the guy out.”
“Yeah, but you’re still going to get in trouble if you’re this far behind,” Sam said.
“Wait!” Sam called, lunging after him but missing by a hair. “Dean, wait!”
“Fine,” Dean said. “But we are going to stay in a really fancy hotel. And I’m raiding the mini bar.”
“I’ll be fine,” Cas gritted through his teeth. “I—I don’t think it hit anything vital.”
Dean barely kept in his snort, but didn’t bother hiding his eyeroll since Sam couldn’t see anyway. “Okay, well, I’d say don’t let the monster bother you, but if mom catches me telling you that thing is real again I’m pretty sure she’s going to ground me for the rest of the summer.”
“I know, I know,” Dean said. “I hired a new girl, Tracy, the other day. Gave her an old beat up Ford to work on while I’m gone, so hopefully if she works out I’ll be able to take some time off a little quicker.”
“Which hotel should I be headed towards?” Dean asked as Cas scrolled through his phone.
“You’re still grinning,” Cas told him. “If your so-called apologies were sincere, then—“
“We had a good time, thanks, Cas,” Charlie said. “And don’t listen to Jo, she had a
“You make it sound like you don’t appreciate my artwork,” Dean said in mock offense.
“Cas!” Dean spluttered, eyes widening to saucers.
“You’re welcome,” Dean told her. “See? At least Jess has manners.”
Cas slid across the bench seat and took Dean’s face in his hands, looking at him with such sadness. It wasn’t pity, never pity. It was one of the things Dean loved most about Cas.
, loaded. They bought an
“But I don’t wanna,” Dean whined, laying his head back on Cas’ shoulder.
“Dean, think about it. Do you really think that Sam just happens to be passing through the same town you decided to settle in?”
Sam barely paused to watch his trajectory, too focused on getting to his brother. Whatever had kept Cas out obviously only worked on dragons since Sam passed whatever barrier there was with ease, skidding to a stop in front of Dean who was struggling frantically to escape his bonds.
“Look, Sam, you don’t need to know why, just don’t tell him.”
Dean huffed a laugh. “I guess I appreciate the attempt.”
A large tiger like figure appeared, slinking out of the water and onto the sand. It turned to face Dean with a smile filled with sharpened teeth.
“How’s the deal on the private island going?” Dean asked instead, coming to plop down on the couch next to his husband.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him. “This wouldn’t have anything to do with you trying to pry information out of everyone, would it? Because I gotta say, man, Bobby doesn’t know anything.”
“Sure thing. Maybe after I’m all done here we can go grab something to eat?”
“Good,” Jo said, “because I have plans.”
Cas smiled. “Good. Then you’ll be able to be home even more often.”
“Oh, I am,” Gabriel replied. “Didn’t I say something about not treating my baby brother like a floozy?”
“You didn’t want it to end?” Dean asked.
“And don’t complain about a high SPF,” Charlie told him. “Your favorite ginger needs all the help she can get.” She grabbed the sunscreen from Cas and shook it.
“I—“ What did happen exactly? He saw his brother and flipped the fuck out? “I don’t—“
Cas huffed and crossed his arms. “I just think it’s completely stupid that we’re not allowed to be alone together anymore just because we started dating. Shouldn’t they trust us? Trust that they raised us well enough not to be stupid?”
The first thing Dean noticed when he opened his eyes was blue. He wondered for a moment if he was outside looking up at a cloudless sky, but there was an insistent beeping that he was fairly certain you didn’t hear in nature.
Dean smiled. “Get over here,” he said, grabbing Cas by the shoulders and pulling until he was lying on top of him.
Another name! She grabbed and clung onto that small thread of hope. “Oh, yes, it might be under…” She stopped. She had never gotten Cas’ last name.
Sam stared at the letter and a small smile curved up the corner of his mouth. “Jerk.”
“I don’t know, but my mom is the same,” Jo said.
are the one who has been worried about our meeting. Not me.”
“Don’t you start with your smarty pants answers,” Jo threatened with a wagging finger in his face.
“I sorta thought that’s what we were doing right now,” Dean replied. “Although, I won’t make any promises for how much longer it’ll go on.”
Dean shivered. That voice sent a chill down his spine and put ice in his veins. Was it possible to sound cold? Like scratching at the thin icy covering of a lake in the dead of winter.
Dean woke up and Sam was gone.
Dean swallowed down a large portion of his coffee, scalding his mouth and trying not to choke on it.
Castiel wanted to demand to know what happened, a fierce protectiveness he never knew he possessed flaring up inside of himself. He wanted to find the perpetrator and—he cut off that line of thinking quickly. It would do nothing to remedy the situation at hand.
, Cas told Dean.
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean said.
Cas shook his head. “I can run to the corner and grab a six pack.” He stood up from the table and began walking towards the door, but Dean grabbed his sleeve and held him back.
Gabe just shrugged and stuffed the rest of the muffin in his mouth.
“What?” Dean asked. “What happened?”
“Cas, babe,” Dean said, walking forward and crouching in front of Cas, taking both of his hands in his own. “Please understand how serious this situation is. I know you think that human hunters are puny and lame or whatever, but you’ve never seen my dad when he’s on a mission.”
“I got it!” Sam shouted from the living room.
Sam just laughed as the director called quiet on the set.
“Balthazar is gone,” Cas cut him off. “We, um, don’t have to pretend anymore.”
Cas couldn’t see Dean anywhere. His wings beat on either side of him as he scanned the landscape. A large forest spread out beneath him, trees spreading all the way to the horizon, except for directly below him where a small lake lay tranquil. It made Castiel nervous to have so much cover for his adversary, but he and Dean had agreed it was a good plan. Not that the plan would matter if Dean didn’t show up.
Gabriel rolled his eyes at them. “Dean-o, your mom called and asked if I would be so kind as to fetch you. And I, being the kind gentleman that I am, readily agreed. So get your cutie patooties in the car.”
Cas just raised his eyebrows and Dean noticed how close they had gotten to each other. Not that they hadn’t ever had a friendly tussle like this before, but it was a little different now that Dean was allowed to fantasize about the lips currently pressed against his palm pressing against his lips. He dropped his hand quickly and took a step back, jostling a group of dancers behind him. But Cas stepped right back into his personal space.
“Don’t forget the ragtag group of barely teens,” Charlie added.
“Oh,” Cas said. “Yes. I am fine. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean smacked him in the arm, though he couldn’t keep the smile off of his face. “You’re such a jerk,” he said. “Can’t you ever let me be Han?”
“Don’t worry about Sam, he’ll be fine. I have Pastor Jim checking in on him every few days.”
Dean groaned. “Are you sure there’s not something else that needs to be done on the Firebird?”
Dean opened his mouth, closed it. Did it again before falling back onto his pillow. “Well, fuck.”
“Won’t be you in there anymore, kiddo. You gotta be smart about this.” It’s what Gabriel always told him whenever Cas started to get anxious. He usually paired it with a knock on the head or a noogie if he was feeling particularly annoying. It was usually enough to quell Cas’ desire to try something reckless.
“We’re not going to talk about it,” Dean said, slapping a rather small container of leftovers down in front of her. “And what are you, twelve? Stop spinning around, this is supposed to be a respectable business.”
Dean turned his quizzical look to her. “Why?” Surely Sam didn’t get in trouble on the last day. Dean couldn’t even remember a time Sam had been in trouble, period.
“Come on, Dean. You’re doing great. Just take a deep breath with me, okay?”
Dean smacked a hand across Jo’s mouth as his face turned bright red. “Jo, I swear to
Sam’s face became even more pinched. “Study date, Dean. Study.”
you, Cas!”
“Balthazar is in town.”
“You don’t have to speak to Sam about what happened,” Cas told him, planting a kiss atop his head. “But I would suggest speaking to him. If only to tell him to stop calling non-stop.” He paused and tilted his head to the side. “Or you could just turn your ringer volume off. In fact, why haven’t you done that?”
“How the fuck should I know, Sam?” Dean spat, causing both Sam and Cas to jump a little at the vehemence, especially since he had just seemed catatonic. “You didn’t tell him I’d be here, did you?”
"You said he was sleepwalking last night?" Mary asked in an undertone so Sam wouldn't overhear.
“Where’d Sam go?” Dean asked, looking around the room.
“It’s my choice,” Dean said, then turning back to his struggling husband, “Dammit, Cas, stand down!”
“Come on, Winchester,” she said. “You’re a total catch underneath your oversized nerd shirts.”
“Hear who?”
Sam startled and turned to see John standing at the foot of the hallway, his broken arm clutched to his chest.
A hand on his shoulder forced him to turn and come eye to eye (more like eye to nose, if he’s being honest) with his kid brother. Who had apparently grown another foot since the last time Dean had seen him. Before Dean had completely registered exactly what was happening he was being crushed in a hug so tight that the fact that he had forgotten to keep breathing became a moot point.
His phone call with Bobby didn’t go exactly as planned. In fact, Bobby somehow guilted him into agreeing to come with Cas for a visit.
get away with giving me a Texas sized hickey?”
They stayed one night in the fanciest hotel they could find where they ordered shrimp cocktails and champagne from room service just because they could and left the next day to spend a few days in their cabin.
“Oh, I don’t know, Dean,” Sam said. “Maybe because he’s given up on trying to talk to you and has instead decided he’s going to work himself to death becoming the next great hunter so you won’t kick him out of the bunker.”
“I heard that,” Dean mocked, pulling a face.
to their deepest core without really knowing anything about them at all. I thought I was going crazy. One day I just woke up in some guy’s room and he’s telling me he’s my soul mate and oh yeah, a freaking
“Gabriel,” Cas groaned.
"No, the um, the park is fine," Sam said. "Thanks for inviting me."
“He’s friends with all the cops,” Cas said, shooting Dean a look that clearly conveyed
to do all day,” Cas replied, placing his hands on Dean’s hips and squeezing.
Dean sighed and dropped his head into his hands. “It’s just—it’s hard, Sammy. It’s hard to be around him.”
“You got one of ‘em?”
"Hey Cas," Dean said, a smile stealing across his face. “How was fishing?”
“Of course, man!” Dean nearly shouted. “I mean—uh—I would not be averse to that, no.” He held his hands out awkwardly as he gestured towards Charlie’s recently vacated seat.
There was another special report on in the morning. This time Jake Talley, eleven years old but looking much older in the school picture they put on the screen.
Dean kept his eye roll in check, mainly because he was too focused on Cas and the fact that he was about to go over and potentially ruin their friendship. He took one more deep breath.
Honestly, Castiel had given up hope that this would ever happen. Most of his family had already made connections and passed on long ago, and those that were left were unwilling to do so. His cousin, Balthazar, for example, had had the opportunity at least three times now and refused each one. Castiel had always been somewhat bitterly jealous about that, but all of those thoughts and feelings were banished from his mind as he took a seat next to the young man nursing a whiskey.
“You teased your little brother about that stupid monster and now he thinks it’s real.”
“Aw, come on, baby,” Dean said. “You can sound like that.”
chocolates, and you’re not too hard on the eyes. Now go over there and get your man.” She pointed over to where Cas had his head stuck halfway in his locker, shuffling something around.
“Here,” Bobby said and shoved a mug of steaming coffee into his hands.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up. “Gabe isn’t here?”
“So what, you’re telling me to just get over it? To just take it like a man?” Dean squared his shoulders and planted his feet in a dare.
,” he said. “It felt like our Bond was breaking.”
Dean leaned forward and pressed a hard kiss onto Cas’ lips. “Together.”
Dean shrugged. “Looks good on you.”
Jess placed a gentle hand on his cheek. “And you were five. What could you have done?”
“You’re late,” Charlie said as soon as she opened the door.
Castiel smiled. “It has been a while since I’ve done that. Can we skip the hunt and get straight to the flying?”
Cas just smiled. “That’s fine, Dean. We can order a pizza tonight and I can go shopping tomorrow.”
Cas just rolled his eyes.
Had he been braver and turned to see Dean’s reaction, he would have seen the same shade of red spread across his best friend’s cheeks and ears as well as a dropped mouth and eyes glazed with shock and a little something else.
“Okay,” Dean said. “Then what the hell are you doing here?”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Dean said, stopping Cas’ quick stride by grabbing his arm and pulling him around to face him. “Is that what you think?”
Cas squinted back before his eyes flew wide with understanding.
Cas wrenched Dean’s hand away. “How do you know?”
“Jerk,” Sam replied with a smile.
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam said quietly. “Seriously.”
Dean looked down. “Dad said I could borrow books from the library, that you had extra sets for kids who can’t afford ‘em.”
“Jess.” Sam said, coming up behind her. “It’s okay,” he told her. “It’s okay.”
“What?” Dean said. “Are you serious?”
Cas watched him for a few more moments before mimicking his movements.
It was Sam’s turn to lift his shoulders in a shrug. “I mean, yeah, I think so.” A thought struck him then, and he turned to Cas. “You’re not a siren, right?”
It was another year before Balthazar managed to visit again.
Charlie’s jaw dropped. “What?” she asked. “You didn’t lead with that?”
Once again, all eyes snapped towards Dean who had just come out of his room, looking a little pale, but otherwise fine.
The pink on his cheeks turned red and he tried to shrink behind his computer screen.
“Novak Restorations, huh?” John said, looking around the waiting area.
“That’s the one,” she said. “Although, I can’t speak for other Deans. You might be a total Dean magnet.”
Cas sighed and kissed Dean’s temple. “I don’t know, my love. If you think you can handle it, then honestly, I think you should speak to him,” Cas told him. “Maybe not today, but soon.” He shrugged. “That’s my opinion, anyway. I think you have some questions that were never answered. And from Sam’s reaction, I think he feels the same way. I know you say you’re fine that way, but…” He sighed and hugged Dean closer to himself. “But whatever your decision, I will stand by you. If you need me to get everyone out of the house, I can be quite intimidating. Maybe I’ll even show them my—“
“I know, I know, I’m sorry,” Dean said. “But hey—my dad is out of town this weekend. I was going to throw an awesome party and officially be crowned the coolest kid in school, but I guess I could cancel the fog machine and strobe lights and let you stay over instead.”
“I thought you’d be asleep by now,” Cas said.
“Please,” Cas said, “don’t feel like you have to wear it if you truly don’t like it. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable in your clothing.”
,” Dean said. “We just… didn’t tell anyone. Not a big deal. And like Cas said, the dance is going to be our first date. And can we please stop talking about this? Charlie already grilled me all through last period.”
“I said
Luckily, this one didn’t take out any cities, just a dozen or so trees as it crashed with an almighty racket.
Dean threw his arm around a now blushing Cas. “Nah, he’s stuck with me, too.”
“Last week,” Cas mumbled.
By the time they were dropping Balthazar off at the correct gate, Cas was just about ready to beg him to stay. On bended knee if need be. He didn’t want it to end. Dean’s arm was a warm, solid weight around his shoulders as they stood at the curb, waving Balthazar off. As soon as he was through the doors with his back turned, Cas stepped nimbly out from under Dean.
“Alright, agreed,” Cas said. “We’ll win the lotto.”
“Nothing can kill a dragon,” Dean said emphatically.
“What?” Dean asked.
Charlie shook her head and put her hand on Dean’s shoulder. “It is romantic. But romantic can sometimes mean really stupid. And this? It’s really stupid.”
“You felt that?” Dean asked sheepishly.
Sam watched the whole proceeding, hearing their argument and subsequent makeup as if through a filter. His mind was still stuck on Cas not being human. But it wasn’t just that, it was seeing
“I just need to hire more people,” Dean said. “I’m doing most of the work on my own right now. That’s the only reason there’s a waiting list. It just seems like I’m popular.”
“And—and why would that be?” Dean’s heart was beating so loud he was sure the whole school could hear it, each centimeter that Cas gained sped it up exponentially. He was sure it would burst right out of his chest like in all those muggle cartoons, but Cas just kept coming until his lips brushed against Dean’s.
“I’m sorry, baby,” Jess told him.
“Thank you, Bobby,” Cas said with a small smile.
“Dean,” Cas said on Thursday after the third call in a row. “Maybe you should just talk to him.”
“Yeesh,” Gabe said, holding his hands up in surrender. “If this is the thanks I get for raising you then I will definitely not be helping with your teen pregnancy baby.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Big brothers don’t actually know everything, Dean. If Sam says he saw something, then I’m inclined to believe him. He’s not exactly prone to bouts of hysteria.”
Dean tore into his own piece. “Good, ain’t it?” he asked, mouth still full.
“You know I won’t let that happen,” Cas told him, holding him tighter.
“Don’t worry, boss. I’d never let anything get traced back to you,” she assured him. “I like this cushy job too much.”
“I think I’m going to take that as a compliment,” Sam said.
“Dean!” he shouted as he got near enough to see that Dean was trapped underneath a giant catlike form of his adversary.
A minute later Sam came into the room, arms filled with candy, a bag of popcorn dangling from one hand.
Dean shrugged it off. “Weapons?” he asked.
Cas hated that the words sent a chill down his spine, but Cas hadn’t felt this afraid since the early days where Cas spent his time running and hiding from his adversary. Apparently zero gravity had been a terrible idea because his adversary seemed to glide through space like his thoughts moved him along while Cas still struggled.
They both looked over to Charlie who was standing awkwardly next to the chair she had just saved Dean from.
“Come on, Sammy,” Dean told him, grabbing his shoulder and giving him a brotherly jostle. “You’re going to have fun today. Promise. Besides, even if the monster is real, which he’s not, he only comes out in the dark. You’ll be fine.”
Three years later, instead of a best man’s speech, Sam projected his phone recording onto a giant screen while Dean hid his bright red face in his hands and Cas smiled through his tears.
Cas narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth to respond in the negative before he realized that Dean was once again trying to brush off his show of emotion with a hyped up sense of masculinity. “Apologies,” Castiel lied instead. “It was one of the earlier batches.”
Sam looked at her blankly but she just shrugged.
Sam felt like he was going to be sick. How could this… how could he…
Dean just shrugged and mumbled an awkward thanks.
“You said you’d be another hour,” Cas said, unable to take the silence any longer.
“It’s hardly anything,” Cas told him.
Confusion was winning out over the anger on Dean’s face, but Cas knew it was only a matter of time before it turned into bluster so he decided it would be best if he stopped teasing and explained. He sighed and placed a gentle hand on Dean’s stubbled cheek. “A little over a month ago we went on a hunt,” Cas began, and then proceeded to explain Dean’s new condition. He and Sam had perfected the speech and had it down to about three minutes, accounting for Dean’s questions.
Dean blushed bright red. “Shit, Cas. You can’t just say things like that.”
“It means my dad was the one giving him those bruises.” He took a deep breath and exploded with, “And I
Charlie smiled and shrugged. “I can live with that.”
“Hey, Bobby,” Dean said. “What’s up?”
She spared him a glance before turning back to the sauce.
Dean and Cas got out of the car a few moments later and Sam did a double take.
There was a pause. “Don’t you like fishing?” Cas asked.
Dean stopped his failing attempts at not sliding back to the bottom of the crater and looked over his shoulder at Castiel. “So you’re trying to tell me that if I say, ‘I wish we were out of this crater and back at the campsite,’ you’d be able to—“ he was going to finish with, ‘make that happen?’ but his jaw went slack when he found himself standing in front of the now dying fire he had built earlier in the evening.
“Blame Dean,” Cas told her.
Gabriel made a show of rolling his eyes this time. “Why you decided to get a job is beyond me—“
“Nothing’s got me jumpy,” Dean said. “My god, you guys are such assholes.” He stalked off to go talk to Cas.
“I’ve only got suspicions,” Bobby said. “He wouldn’t tell me.”
After another two minutes of squabbling they decided that they would walk in together, both trying and failing to be subtle about trying to edge the other behind themselves. Sam rolled his eyes and followed them in.
Cas held his package close. “No, I don’t trust you to not eat them.”
Dean stared at his phone with a furrow between his brows until there was a knock at the door and it swung open, squeaking slightly when it reached the halfway mark.
“Aw, don’t be grumpy on your birthday.”
“Fuck.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “I told him that he should have used ours.”
Cas grabbed a handful of Dean’s ass and squeezed. “You are dangerously close to not having sex today, Dean.”
“I don’t know, not since that first night,” Dean said. “But I don’t think he would just leave like this.”
Dean ignored the comment as he continued to take in the scene before him.
“You did it Cas! Holy shit, you fucking did it!” Gabriel was shouting and the next thing he knew Gabe was crushing him in a hug, continuing to shout directly into his ear. “Oh my god, Cassie, you’re finally free!”
house!”
,” John said the word like it physically pained him and Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from yelling. “He’s a dragon.”
he said
“Look, I’ll definitely be able to do it before we leave,” he told her, grabbing two coffee mugs from the stack on the buffet table and filling them up. “I created the spell, I just need to ask Bobby for some reinforced spell glass. Maybe twenty minutes to complete the actual spell.” And hope it works. He poured a splash of creamer in his along with two scoops of sugar. Cas liked his black, though, the weirdo.
“Oh yeah?”
“Alright, we should do this again sometime” Dean said, walking to the door with Cas.
Cas gave a solemn nod and turned back to the television screen, letting Dean rest on in peace.
“I know,” Dean said softly. “I’m still working on it, alright?”
Dean quickly looked away from where he had been staring at Cas and saw this his own marshmallow was quickly nearing burnt and yanked it from the flames. He turned his back to Cas to hide his blush and to grab the graham crackers and chocolate bars from the bag behind him.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas replied. It was true. Cas did like Led Zeppelin, though the
Cas remained silent, afraid of what his voice would sound like, but he nodded again.
Mary shot Cas a small, grateful smile.
“You’re the dramatic one in this relationship, remember?” Cas told him.
“You’re right,” Charlie said. “I think this place closes soon.”
“Mostly me, and I turned out great.” He even threw in a wink.
He heard grumbling on the other end of the line before it went dead.
Dean stood up and marched over to Bobby, giving him a brief, but strong hug and leaving the room.
Dean cleared his throat. “Well, that’s good to know, but it’s not like it really matters.”
,” Dean insisted.
“Cas?”
Dean rolled his own eyes. “Dude, have you ever looked in a mirror? Or have you been too busy checking me out in my green and blue plaid shirt?”
“Then why did you?” Cas demanded. “Why would you agree to help me out if it was only going to disgust you in the end?”
“I don’t know,” he said, voice getting louder. “Maybe you could start off with where the hell you’ve been the past five years!”
"The park?" he asked, head perking up.
Cas grinned for a moment before the next throb of pain shot through him and his face sobered. “I did not like today.”
“What is this, a limo service?” Gabriel asked, turning in his seat to face them.
“Dean,” Sam said, striding forward but stopping awkwardly a few feet in front of him.
They ate sandwiches that Dean had prepared for them (turkey, lettuce, and tomato from Dean’s own garden) and played footsie under the table until it was time for the afternoon crowd. Cas smiled through that rush, too, even though he burned himself on a tray of snickerdoodles he had mistaken for the cooled sugar cookies.
“Go, Charlie. Tell Tracy and Vic to call it a day, too.”
Sam shrugged. "Haven't felt very good lately."
Cas flashed a devious grinned. “You wanna hear a better one?” At Dean’s nod, he continued, “What do you say we skip the takeout altogether?”
“Um, about that,” Cas said. “We sort of have a plan.”
Cas nodded. “I’m enjoying this movie very much. I think it’s my favorite one.”
“What were you trying to look at?” Dean inquired.
“Oh, that’s it, asshole,” Dean said, tackling him back onto the bed of the truck. He pinned Cas’ arms above his head. “You’re going to pay for that.”
“I can’t see anything,” Charlie said, turning her flashlight to the trees as well.
“Would your brother really tell your father?” Cas asked.
actually have some differences.”
They passed Sam on their way up the stairwell, his hair still wet and clothes with damp patches where he hadn’t quite dried all the way off.
Dean picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder. He waited for Bobby to lead the way, but Bobby was too busy staring at him.
“So does Charlie,” Dean said. “Why can’t you guys go hang out at her place?”
“Totally likes you?” Charlie finished for him. “Yup. So I’m hoping you’re a little more Gryffindor—no, wait,” she held a hand out to stop him from saying anything. “I don’t want to know if you don’t understand that reference. I was half kidding before, but this one would truly break my heart. So, anyway, I’m hoping you’re a little braver than Dean and will maybe do something with this information that I have so lovingly imparted.”
Sam looked over to Dean who was trying to shout something through his gag, still struggling to free himself.
Bobby opened his mouth to answer, but Dean held up a silencing finger. “I want to hear what it is from Sam. He should know, right? I mean, obviously you would have given him the basics to convince him to help you.”
“He tried to kill us, Dean,” Cas replied without looking over. “He tried to kill
“I’m not happy about this, Cas.” Dean sat on their couch, his leg jiggling up and down with nerves.
“Well, usually you come in here all, ‘So get this!’ and then tell me a story about some
“Yeah, and you’re only ten. You should respect your elders.”
“What the hell is dad doing here?” Sam asked, apparently having followed them. He seemed far more confused than worried.
Instead, he said, “Yeah, well. We don’t always get what we want.”
“Sporadically?” Sam asked. “Have you been watching Clueless again?”
But Sam didn’t listen. Couldn’t listen, maybe. He just kept taking step after step, his movements jerky and halting.
Cas shook his head in fond exasperation while Dean let out a howl of laughter. “I take back my earlier statement. You and Dean are reacting the exact same way.”
Cas took his hand and pulled him out of the janitor’s closet they had been hiding in and began to walk quickly down the empty hallway. He caught his reflection in one of the windows lining the hall and stopped dead.
Cas knew Dean was in Bobby’s office, though he was sure that if he didn’t, he’d have been able to find him even without his locator ring. He could just feel him.
“All dates are study dates to a Ravenclaw,” Dean replied with a wave of his hand. “You’re all a bunch of nerds.”
.” Charlie’s voice was tinny over the intercom.
and I just—“
“But what if you get tired of living my first day with me?”
“Uh, yeah, we told them to come at three, I think.”
The fury melted out of Cas and he began walking towards Dean, expression lightening with each step he took. He didn’t manage to take many, however, before he roared and fell to his knees.
And he was. Ansem lifted his head to look at them. Unlike Ava, his movements were slow, and he lifted a hand and pointed behind them.
“Damn, I thought I smelled something good,” Dean said, trying to peer around Bobby into the kitchen.
Cas hummed as he pondered Dean’s question.
Cas’ eyes widened and his face turned a similar color to Dean’s previously sunburned butt cheeks.
“Do you think I’m selfish? Or self-centered?” he asked. The long car ride back from Bobby’s had given him plenty of time to get over his initial anger and confusion and allowed him to think about how he had completely missed something so essential.
“Shut up,” Dean said, his face heating. “Please just drop it, okay?”
“Stole it. Don’t ask me any more questions. Please.” His plan had gone horribly wrong. Dean was going to murder him. You see, it would have been funny, hilarious even, if Dean had drunk the potion. Sam had just planned on asking him various questions around Cas, skirting around the fact that Dean had a major crush on him. He wasn’t actually going to make him admit it! He would never! But none of that would matter if Dean asked the wrong question.
“Really?” Dean asked excitedly. He schooled his features into a more neutral expression and continued, “I mean, you don’t have to. We’ll still see each other there.”
Sam hid his grin as Dean lifted the cup to his mouth, but before he took a drink he put it down onto the table.
Dean waited for him, rising and falling with the beating of those gorgeous wings.
Cas held him closer, maneuvering so that he could wrap both arms around him as well as his wings. “If you don’t want to go tomorrow—“
What the hell was Sam doing here? It’s not like Dean staked out a city for himself and didn’t want anyone coming into his clubhouse without his permission, it was just… Well, that was sort of exactly what it was like; he just hadn’t mentioned it to anyone because as far as he knew no one knew or cared where he was. Okay,
“Don’t worry. I’m Team Cas all the way.” Dean winked at him.
Cas shook his head. “But it’s possible I would have been had I known then what they tasted like.”
He let out a pathetic groan because he might as well, seeing just how pathetic he was.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said gruffly. “Be sure the two of you come around more often now that you don’t have to worry about me finding out, will you?”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas said. “He’s like the brother I always wanted but never had.”
“What? You’re just going to kill them all? Not an option, Cas.”
Cas narrowed his eyes at Balthazar. “That is not the terminology I used,” he groused.
“Because I wanted to talk to you.”
Cas cocked his head in thought as he stared at the flickering flames of the fire. “I like listening to the sounds of the universe,” he said with a smile. “The planets spinning, flying along their paths. Asteroids drumming into anything in their way. Sometimes we’d even hum along, add to the melody. It’s very peaceful.” He pulled his marshmallow out, now the perfect shade of golden brown, and turned to Dean for further instruction.
. By the time he realized he needed to fight back, his limbs were already too sluggish for the struggle and he fell into unconsciousness cursing himself for letting his guard down around his father.
Dean and Cas managed a glimpse of each other during passing period. They both smiled sheepishly at each other from across the hall as Jo and Charlie switched places.
Castiel ignored it all and stood on shaky legs. He shook his wings out, sending a cloud of dirt to settle in the air around him. “Do you really think your old tricks will work on me?” Cas asked. “This form worked quite well to scare me when I was a child, but it’s a little lacking compared to what I see in the movies these days.”
“You can eat them raw?” Cas asked, sounding more urgent than Dean thought the situation called for.
“Well…” Cas chanced a glance into Dean’s eyes before looking away again. “Never mind, it’s stupid, don’t listen to me. Forget everything I just said.”
“How do you know that, Cas?” Dean asked. “How can you know what you’re going to feel like in a year?”
“I can carry him,” one of the teens said, Dean thinks he remembers his name being Max from one of the news reports.
Dean hummed. “Let’s just go with ‘gorgeous as hell’ and call it a day,” he said, rolling on top of Cas and leaning down to capture his lips again.
Dean bit his lip. “Is it... “ he sighed. “Do you think it’s, like, romantic?”
“You know,” Cas said softly, sounding a little embarrassed. “I, um,” he cleared his throat. “When I told Meg we were going to the dance together… I didn’t think I was lying.” His head was turned away from Dean, staring resolutely at the couple dancing to their right, but his grip around Dean had tightened with nerves.
“Twenty minutes? Great, thanks.”
“And Cas seriously broke his arm?”
“They aren’t listening in,” Sam said, rolling his eyes.
), and tried to keep the smile off of his face. Ms. Harvelle kept looking over at him like she knew he wasn’t paying attention and Cas wanted to take Dean’s earlier advice and stay on her good side.
“He’s very happy for us,” Cas assured him. “Except for when he can hear us. Then I suspect he is quite frustrated.”
Cas looked to Dean and then over to John and Sam unconsciously backed up a few steps at the absolute fury he saw in his eyes. And it was a good thing, too, because next thing he knew Cas had taken two steps forward and punched John who fell to the ground like it was a magnet.
"I might not have a choice if you keep talking."
“I’m fond of Balthazar. Where is he?”
He should have said it years ago.
Dean was almost crying with laughter. Cas looked on, bemused, but smiling.
“Something up Cas?”
Cas put a hand on his chest, over the tattoo, noticing now that a scar ran deep across it, cracking the ink. Dean’s heart was hammering violently, his body tense and shaking slightly. Cas frowned, and realised that the only truly cruel thing he could do now would be to delay any further.
Dean started undoing buttons, struggling to remove clothing with Cas’ arms wrapped around him so tightly. Cas reluctantly released his death grip, shoving at Dean’s layers, hindering more than helping. He was impatient. He wished he could have removed the clothes with a snap of his fingers, made it disappear without these moments of distance.
The waitress returned and Cas ordered a coffee for himself, giving her a charming smile that had her blushing. Dean glared at her as she walked away, teeth grinding. Couldn’t Cas wait until after he died? Did he really have to move on right in front of him like that? Wasn’t he worthy of a last few moments of undivided attention?
They saw nothing but a family, a car, and the open road.
"There is plenty of me that you are yet to see." He glanced down at his infuriatingly clothed body then looked back up at Dean.
“You know that I-“
Dean fidgeted, eyes flicking from Castiel's calm expression to their hands joined between them, paying next to no attention to the movie.
Bobby shook his head.
“I’m distracted,” Dean swallowed around the admission, eyes moving from the space beneath the table (where Cas’ weapon was undoubtedly poised) to meet his gaze. He exhaled as he looked into those eyes, incapable of separating the killer from the man, incapable of ignoring his fucking stupid feelings.
Cas looked happy, truly happy for a blissful moment, then sheer terror overtook his expression. He grabbed Dean's face between his palms, desperately kissing him, and finally, finally Dean knew what those lips tasted like. It was everything he'd wanted for so long and he felt like this was the moment he would live over and over if heaven was something that was meant for him.
Dean didn’t know why he kept pushing Cas, didn’t know why he saw the knife and wanted his skin to split beneath it, didn’t know why the thought of Cas being anything resembling gentle right now had him on the edge of a panic attack. His mind was buzzing too loudly for him to make sense of anything, getting louder and louder with every second that passed until he just wanted to scream the noise away. Fuck, maybe he had deliberately knocked the damn glass over, because he knew in that moment that Cas was the only person in the world who could calm him down.
Dean laughed somewhat bitterly.
"Not in this family."
“I can heal you if you’re hurt, let me-” he reached out a hand to heal whatever damage he had done, but Dean took hold of his wrist and gently moved it away.
A general sense of forboding...
Was this a date? It didn't feel like a date, it sounded like a date, surely you were asked on a date rather than dragged out the door to one. Dean gave up on trying to find the answers, expect the unexpected, he internally chanted to himself, it was the only way to keep up with this man. Not that he was likely to be able to anyway.
Why was he so incapable of shutting this shit down these days? Normally he could forget, normally he could just do, without thoughts of good and evil, right and wrong. Normally he got hard at the sight of blood. Not today, or yesterday. Not since he’d met Cas. He cursed himself; this was why men like him didn’t form attachments, it was too dangerous. He couldn’t afford to care, he couldn’t afford to want to be better. He didn’t have the right.
“Cas, Cas, Cas.”
“She tried to stab you.”
Cas was planning his vengeance from the second Dean left. He thought through his options, considering all the ways this could go. Should he kill him? Perhaps. It was certainly the dignified option, and yet, he had no desire to do so. He could chase him down easily enough, but he didn’t need to, all it took was a text. Dean was, as always, eager for his destruction. He arrived at the allotted place at the allotted time, without the most basic of precautions. He wasn’t even carrying a gun.
The war was wearing on him, Castiel was finding himself needing companionship in a way that he never normally would. He wished Dean had been sober, physical indulgence had a way of calming him. Sex was, by far, his favourite form of meditation. Tonight he felt like he was made up of blinding light, on the edge of an explosion, hot and tense and dangerous. He had killed far too much of late, and seen too many of his brothers and sisters killed in return. It was out of control. He had hoped to at least be able to find control in Dean. He slipped off his coat with a sigh and sat on the edge of the bed while Dean sank into the headboard.
“Cas, please,” the desperation had returned, desperation that Cas knew was mirrored in his own expression.
“I hope you have a convincing explanation for what I just witnessed Castiel.”
“Calm your titties there Uriel, you know I love you freaks far too much for any of that watchamacall it.”
“I know Dean. I know, but let me give you some modicum of pleasure beforehand.”
“Get back under the covers before I change my mind.”
“Good, because this is not going to be easy on you. Don’t look away from me,” it was an order, of that there was no doubt, and Dean found himself not even second guessing the urge to obey.
Dean regretted his decision to go home the second the house pulled into view. All those dark windows, the unkempt lawn, the smoke stains that they still hadn't been able to get out. It looked cold and scarred, uninviting, empty. Familiar in all the wrong ways.
"I know I just-" Cas stroked Dean's cheek, reassuring himself that he was still there," he was going to kill you and I couldn't let him do that and..." he dropped his hand. "Oh god what have I done?"
Torture
“No, you listen Castiel, and listen well. These cockroaches are destroying our family, and your paramour is responsible for more than his fair share of that destruction. Love may have blinded you, but I will not be similarly weakened. Tomorrow you and Uriel will hunt down Dean Winchester, smite him from this earth, and when that is done we shall... have words. Do I make myself clear?”
"One word at a time."
"Come inside me," Dean breathed out in a rush, blushing deeply.
He did as he was told. Not caring if Sam saw him like this. Not bothering to move his head. Screwing his eyes shut as the truth of it all crashed down on him.
“I do. However I would feel more grateful if you let me go also.”
Dean nodded his assent, desperate to get away from the only family he had left. He knew Samuel despised him, but he wouldn’t fight him. He had, after all, saved him from the responsibility of leadership. Dean didn’t think he could have handled that, after everything.
"We can still fix this," Dean's words came quick and urgent, "there's a way out for you."
