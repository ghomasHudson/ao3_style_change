John’s brilliant smile returned, his minty breath fanning across Sherlock’s face as he kissed the tip of Sherlock’s nose, filling the bathroom with a different sort of light than the fluorescents overhead. “Come on then, let’s get you undressed.”
“What?” John griped after a few seconds of silence, eying the detective with disdain. His annoyance melted very quickly when he saw the somber look on Sherlock’s face. “What’s wrong, Sherlock?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So it was a shock, really, when Sherlock pulled back without warning and aimed his gun at the older man. John hardly had the time to look indignant before Sherlock squeezed the trigger-

They sat in silence for several minutes, drinking their tea and very pointedly avoiding eye contact. John coughed lightly. Sherlock drummed a melody on his thigh. After what seemed like an eternity, Sherlock huffed.
Sherlock shifted, too, so that their faces were centimetres apart. Somewhere in the flat a clock was ticking and the early dawn light was beginning to seep through the windows, casting a surreal glow on everything it touched.

John, who was rapidly crossing from concerned to alarmed, glanced at Sally in surprise. She swallowed, but seemed prepared to accept whatever punishment Sherlock was about to deliver.
John wrote down the affected keys:
John cupped a handful of hot water, gently pouring it onto the detective’s ivory curls. Little streams flowed down Sherlock’s temples and nose, and he sunk lower so John could access his head with more ease.
Sherlock turned, looking John up and down as if scanning him for any signs of deception. His gaze was carefully guarded, but not even Sherlock Holmes could hide the small sliver of hope that was gleaming in his eyes. "Tell your landlord to purchase a new doorbell; this one's about to give out."
Why what?
Again he paused, and again John felt a wave of nausea sweep over him. It wasn’t until Sherlock started again that John realized he was now speaking at normal volume, voice slightly less robotic. He wondered how long Sherlock had wanted to tell this story, how many times he’d practiced it and revised it so that every word had a purpose and he got his point across exactly how he wanted it.
John felt his stomach lurch. Everyone was completely taken aback. The few whispered conversations amongst their impromptu audience died. Sally’s eyes widened a fraction, but she otherwise had no reaction. Even Anderson’s defensiveness deflated.

John shook his head in wonder. “I am about to rock your world, Sherlock Holmes.”

It seemed to go on and on, chaste and passionate and hot and cold and more than John could have ever hoped for, or even imagined… and then Sherlock was pulling back, face flushed and a ridiculous grin on his face.

“Then I was entering uni, and I decided to start fresh. No more deductions, no more cocaine. Maybe I’d even make some friends. Instead, I was accused of cheating when I got a perfect score on a chemistry placement exam. My enrollment was revoked, despite my protests. It was a rather harsh punishment, but I suppose they figured they were saving themselves the trouble of dealing with me in the future, and I wasn’t technically a student yet. I didn’t want to go home to my father, and I didn’t want to ask my brother for help, so I tried getting a few jobs, but I was not well-suited for the types of jobs that teenage flunkies were stuck with.”

"There were too many! That could have gone wrong in so many ways, Sherlock. What if I hadn't come in time? What would you have done without me?" John threw his hands in the air.
He didn't yet dare to love John with everything he had to give. He'd never forgive himself, would never be able to live with it, if he'd ruin it, if he'd break John Watson.
Sherlock had obviously noticed, too, as he now lifted his foot and placed it, heavy boot and all, in John’s lap, putting delicate pressure on his trapped erection. John groaned, dropped his head. Fuck. What was his life?
After 8159 seconds, after 69 periodic tables plus chlorine, after 1023 prime numbers, he hadn't given up hope because he didn't hope because he didn't care because that was the plan.
“Yes, yes... I’ll be quiet now. Sorry.”
way at least… Sherlock couldn't hold it against him though, could he? He couldn't expect John to find him in such a precarious situation, left in the dark and then keep a clear head.
“Ha!” John barked out. “Yes, you can say that. But really, Sherlock, we’re getting groceries from
Sherlock seemed to pick up on its desperate begging as he took John's full length in his mouth and enthusiastically started bobbing his head. Sherlock's balls slipped from John's mouth when he gasped and gripped Sherlock's thighs hard with both hands to steady himself, to have an anchor not to drown in the onslaught of sensations. The muscles underneath his hands were twitching, tensing; Sherlock's hips bucking forward seeking much needed friction. John released one of Sherlock's thighs and reached for his erection instead, and swallowed it completely down in one go. Sherlock thrust forward in surprise and John gagged and coughed, so he took hold of the base of Sherlock's cock covering it partly with his hand as far as he needed to keep the man from suffocating him. This gave him space to tease and stimulate the glans, twirling his tongue around it, poking its pointed tip against the slit.

"Let's say, I'm an old friend. You can call me Spider and I'm only trying to keep my net free from filth." the man said appallingly friendly as if they were having a neighbourly conversation over the fence. "Let me give you a little advice… between friends, so to speak. Don't get too attached to your pets, they all leave eventually. That's what those floosies do. Ya know, caring is not an advantage in our business. All lives end. It'll burn a heart out of you eventually."
John stared at him. Not knowing how to react, he felt all the anger and the tension of the past few days boil up in him, and if he was honest with himself there was no small amount of fear mingling with it.

What did John even suspect? On the other hand, was it that far fetched that something fishy went on here? Or should he rather not ask? Maybe it was overbearing? Not his place? Then again, why would Sherlock leave him out? What did he have to hide? If he had to hide anything in the first place. And if not, what would Sherlock think, if John interrogated him about it? Maybe he would think John didn’t trust him. But... did he trust him? God gracious, what a freaking mess! Why was it even such an issue?

“No, no, no. You know I can’t possibly be away from the office for any length of time, not with the career and re-elections, well, you don’t need to know about that, do you? Besides, a case like this, it requires…legwork.” He said, the last word making him grimace.

A week had passed since Cas left and Dean was starting to worry. He even began helping Sam with his demonic possession research to get his mind off of it.
"What are you on about Lestrade? I'm fine. Better than fine, actually. Now let me go." Sherlock growled.
“Yes.” The vamp gulped.
Dean became dumbstruck with awe for a split second, but that instantly melted into rage. "Some angel you are." He spat viciously. "You burned out that poor woman's eyes."

Dean sighed. "Maybe Cas will know."
"For God's sake, Gregory. Everything supernatural; vampires, werewolves, demons, they're all real. And they are all dealt with as swiftly and efficiently as possible by a special British task force."
"Could you possibly try to keep it down? Doesn't all that racquet hurt your head?"
“So you get a ruffle your feathers and decided to disappear?” Dean chided. “To go stick your head in the sand, forever?”
Greg's heart dropped all the way to his feet. He hadn't considered that consequence when he decided not to call Sherlock in. He should have. The D.I. lifted his hand to finally knock, but then something else was said that confused him. Mycroft had moved inside the flat and he could hear him clearer.

'Phone.' His subconscious supplied. 'Ah, yes. Of course.' With some effort, he pulled himself back into the current world and fished his phone out of his pocket. Three texts from D.I. Lestrade. A case! And it wasn't far from here! Sherlock briefly wondered if he should go in his altered state, but he was on uppers and he knew they would only sharpen his focus if concentrated.
“For Sam.” Cas stated. “Here.” He ordered, reaching his hand out to retrieve the note. Sam handed it over. On the top it read: The Trials of God require either a sacrifice or a hero. It’s your choice. Underneath that was a list of ingredients and instructions for the spell. “If a mortal were to complete the trials, it would kill them…” The angel began.
Greg sat up slowly. “Wow, I must’ve been pretty tired. Hope you still slept okay. Breakfast?” He stood up and quietly padded over to the kitchen.
Mycroft Holmes sees and knows all.
"We're going out tonight. Get changed." The taller man ordered.
Greg scoffed. "You really are a drama queen, Mycroft Holmes."
"...he had a gun to Sherlock's head. I couldn't shoot him, or it would have set off his pistol too. He decided to strangle Sherlock instead, but that God-forsaken gun was still pointed at him. As soon as I saw his grip loosen on his gun, I pulled mine and shot him in the head. Unfortunately, the killer's gun still went off, and the bullet grazed the top of Sherlock's skull. It was too close. Way too close." John grimaced at the memory.
Lestrade stirred slightly with a small grunt of disapproval. One of his hands wrapped around John's waist, his subconscious not wanting to give up hold just yet.
“I see you’ve written up the taxi driver case.” Sherlock mentioned to John later, in order to deflect from a dispute about body parts in the fridge. John stood with one hand on his hip and the other pressed against his forehead.

Suddenly, the lightbulbs above the hunters began to blow out, shooting cascading showers of sparks. A shadowy figure, that Dean couldn't quite make out because of the fluctuation of light, sulked into the barn. The figure approached slowly but surely, walking right past all of the sigils and wardings that the hunters had laid for the being.
John was immediately alert and at attention. It made Sherlock smirk, because he knew that John could take him down with a single blow.

"How ya feeling there, Sasquatch?" Dean asked, poised to stand right back up.
“Not important? It’s primary school stuff! How can you not know that?” John asked loudly, his voice laced with disbelief.
John was by his side for it all.
“Uhhhm, no.” He replied harshly to the paper he was holding.
"I...I had suspected." He confessed, rubbing the back of his neck with one of his broad hands. "Just...I was just hoping that I was wrong, is all."
“Kevin!” Sam gasped.
"I suppose I can't, can I? When you fit in so perfectly with it. You make my work so much more exciting and fun."

John walked out into the cool London air and headed for a pub on the other side of town. On the way he pulled out his phone and sent a text.

You’re ridiculous.
He tried to recall the events of the previous evening leading up to such a strange sleeping arrangement. They’d finished a particularly difficult case last night and bought a bottle of Jack Daniels to celebrate. After several drinks, John’s memory went hazy, but he vaguely remembered suggesting they watch Star Wars: A New Hope. Had they put in the disk and fallen asleep watching it? That seemed the most likely. More likely than John seducing Sherlock into cuddling, in any case.
Sally’s mouth set in a firm line, but before she could speak, Anderson cut in. “You think it’s funny, Holmes? Sticking your nose into other people’s business and mucking around? Just because nobody loves you doesn’t mean you should go around and ruin relationships.” His voice was passionate and wrung with conviction: he truly believed no one loved Sherlock Holmes, and was stating it as a given fact.
“I told you I would rock your world.”
“I know. But now I need the loo.”

As John’s mind slowly rose from the smoky haze of sleep, the first thing he became aware of was how terribly uncomfortable he was. His neck was cricked at an awkward angle on the arm of the sofa, the entire right side of his body pressed firmly against the back rest while his left leg dangled off the couch. Judging by the pounding headache, dry mouth, and vague sense of regret, he’d been drinking last night, and he longed desperately for a glass of water and a paracetamol.

Sherlock licked his lips, eyes flickering across John’s face, before suddenly standing and making his way to John’s chair. Sherlock bent down as John looked up, their noses brushing.
Sherlock cracked one eye open again, peering hesitantly at John. “It’s been a very long time. I don’t—I haven’t taken on any lovers for several years.”
John thought as their breaths mingled. He was sure his breath smelled stale with sleep and Sherlock’s wasn’t much better, but John found that he didn’t care in the slightest.
A shocked laugh escaped John’s throat before he could contain it. Of course, he had had his speculations about Sherlock’s sexuality, but John had always assumed that Sherlock was some level of asexual.
A bit not good.

“You’re an idiot, Sherlock Holmes,” John yawned, reaching for the lamp.
The blood roared in John Watson's ears as he ducked under the bridge to the safety of the outer brick wall. The gun, firmly grasped across his chest with both hands, was slick with sweat. Adrenaline coursed through his body, his fingers and toes humming with excited energy, and under the heavy vest his heart was beating like a hummingbird's wings.
Sherlock's arms dropped and in three long strides he had John pinned against the brick wall, lips pressed against his in a desperate kiss, as if Sherlock needed John more than he needed oxygen.

John, too, had gone very still. He cast Sally a warning look. The Sergeant seemed to get his message and looked back up to Sherlock, now a little anxious.

The thing about being suicidal is that you learn to be a good actor.
That had to be it. That had to be the passcode. Either that, or it was the biggest coincidence on the planet, or Sherlock was playing dirty. Never in a million years would John have thought of this, but now it did seem obvious, though perhaps a bit unbelievable.
Sherlock froze, eyebrows raised. “Why?”
Seemingly satisfied, the detective turned. He addressed John as they walked away (John was several steps behind, having been frozen in shock when Sherlock began his departure.) “Now we’ve got to wait for a cab, thanks to your admittedly admirable impression of a statue. Pezzo’s?”
"Uhm… yes… well," Scott sounded a bit caught off guard. Was he embarrassed? Why would he be? John already knew he was working for a phone sex hotline, didn't he? No need to hide. He was the one calling the hotline after all. "It might be the case that I have taken over some extra shifts this week… for reasons…"
Sherlock nodded silently. He had expected that much. But one more week?
When John then smiled at him as if saying,
"Rather a lifetime supply of pints in the pub." Sherlock said between kisses on John's chest.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, then held his breath. Then pressed the button.
He wasn’t in the least surprised when he was greeted by one of Mycroft’s shiny black cars the moment he opened the front door. He had texted after all. He hadn’t mentioned a time though, but it wouldn’t be beyond Mycroft to have a car on stand by at his front door all morning.
"Because you made me pay for dinner."
John kneaded his hands. His gaze shifted, he was struggling for words.
he’d find a suitable club...then what? It had been so long since he had to chat up someone that he felt uncomfortably out of practice. Sweet talk? Never. Innuendos? Ha. Seducing? Never heard of. What even were women? Alien species?
"I don't know, John." was what he said therefore.
“The need has never arisen, considering I’ve never lived under circumstances that might have caused scarcity of water or space. At least not in the company of others.” The doubt in his own reasoning was apparent and emphasised by the way Sherlock lowered his gaze and studied his dusty feet.
“Oh… I bet you did.” Spider-guy said smugly. “You naughty boys. Can’t keep your hands off each other, can you?” He chuckled playfully. But neither of the mayflies seemed to get the joke and empty eyes just stared out of empty heads.
His thoughts came to a halt when he felt a warm hand searching his; fingers intertwining. He looked around and realised they had already made their way outside of the power station and its surrounding area. How had he missed it, how could he waste all those precious minutes with John. He willed himself to stay in the moment, John's hand in his anchoring him, pulling him into the present.
"Alright?" Greg asked when he poked his head through the opening of the hatch.
That was probably the reason why John was lost lately. Yes, he was happy to be back. Yes, he never regretted his decision concerning Mary. Even if Sherlock had been hesitant about it at first, downright angry actually when they had talked about it for the first time. However, eventually even Sherlock had calmed down.
"If you say so," he laughed. "Go on then, spill it. What do you want to know?" Prepared to give this stranger, handsome or not, every piece of information he'd ask for, he wondered what might be so interesting about his dreary little life. And was once again taken by surprise.
“Of course I know, brother mine!” Sherlock says angrily. “As you make use of every opportunity to remind me!”
Yes, very very unfortunate. Sherlock was lost in thought imagining John in front of him to be deduced. What would he see? What would John let him see? Would Sherlock even dare to look closely?
He tried to understand. He had to understand. Because how could he act and react, if he didn't understand.
The room was tidied up. Same as the kitchen, nothing of the clutter he had left behind was left where it had been. His music stand where it should be, books and papers stockpiled in the bookshelves disguising the gaps left behind where John's books had been. Suddenly Sherlock remembered the box, the John box, and he frantically searched the room with his eyes but it was nowhere to be seen. Where could it be? Upstairs? In John's room…
Panting, gasping, pumped out. Lungs and chest hurting, heart nearly capitulating from exhaustion physically, emotionally. Drained. Empty.
“And you gained all that from the two times you spied on me?” He even tilted his head a bit, a trace of suspicion in his voice.
His release within reach, literally, hand on the door handle to the gents, he heard a much too familiar smooth voice coming out of the shadows.
His mind was fogged. He was shocked. He was confused. He felt old wounds being torn open to bleed again. It hurt. Damn! Shit! Fucking feelings. He thought he would manage. He thought he had found a way to handle it.
“All of it.” Sherlock panted.
John was impressed by the courage of the man to speak up even though he wasn't exactly sure what he was referring to.
She now ran her fingers along her neck, down her chest, cupping her breast with her hands and pausing there for the tiniest moment. One couldn’t hear above the music, but one could imagine the little moan escaping her throat. After a very little squeeze of her breasts, which drove John mad, she continued her path sliding her exquisite hands down her belly. John held his breath about what was to come.
Which now meant, he didn't have to look at his phone to know who was texting. He smiled sadly. John had been patient. It was indeed the next day. He had done what Sherlock had asked. Reliable, trustworthy John. Even now. Which was in stark contrast to his own current situation, condemned to passivity, avoiding everything that was left of him. He felt something being crushed inside him—it might have been his backbone. It would have hurt, if he would still care. Then again, Sherlock had not expected to still be around to receive any reaction in the first place. Bloody Mycroft.
"Whatever it needs to get your approval, Captain." Scott's voice dropped even deeper, reminding John of the growl of a thunderstorm on the horizon. It even gave off the same electrical charge, making the air around him crackle. “Maybe you should come back and check on the progress yourself.”

“What’s wrong with me?” he hissed out between ragged breaths.
“Sherlock,” he said, relief and anger and concern and adrenaline and endorphins all knotted into one tight ball of tension making his voice hoarse and sharp.
"What other things?" voice flat. Hesitant?
“So… it became… it was… it didn't work anymore. You know how things can get then. Shouting, rows, pouting. You know
“Well… he left me something.”John started to say, when Greg immediately latched on to it.
*stop*
“Just tell me!” Scott demanded, slightly petulant.
“Oh, come off it, John,” Sherlock huffed, “who’d expect a war hero, extremely skilled doctor, crack shot and a sex god behind your boring everyman’s appearance?”
song 2 for the chapter:
Sherlock shuffled and turned to look John in the face. His eyes were earnest when they roamed John's face.
"Well then." John said coolly. "Goodbye… for now. I guess…"
Sherlock looked a bit abashed, tilted his head and grimassed.
“Of course, dear! Of course!” Mrs Hudson said in her motherly caring tone. Sherlock could hear a rustle of fabric and could picture her engulfing John in her very own kind of embrace nobody could ever escape.
“How…,” Sherlock frowned. “When…?”
what John was feeling.
"John!"
. Eyes closed. Mind blank.
"I'm here," John said quietly in between his small kisses.
you're
When they had settled back into their tangle of arms and legs and hands and hearts, John explained, "I might have started a poll."
When he had come back after the fall, he couldn't risk to let John see. He had stopped playing. Excuses of too long a time not played, of too little practise had. Sometimes John had asked, but he had never insisted. Now though, it was his only option to manage the riot of emotions.
After a while there was still no reaction from John and Sherlock slapped his hands over his ears. He scrunched his eyes shut as if that would help in any way. Of course, it didn't. It was maddening! Especially as he wasn’t able to blend out neither the music nor the lyrics which - naturally - he knew by heart. It wasn’t the first time he listened to this album after all. How else would he have known about the other song. But this one though wasn’t any better! Especially not now!
OMG, this is so adorable!!! Someone should write a fic about it!!
"Well. That was Mycroft Holmes." Greg shrugged. "Thought you'd recognise him." He added and winked at John. "Do you think he'd be amenable to have dinner sometime?"
'My sacrifice'...

Oblivious to his surroundings Sherlock wandered through London’s streets, bumping into people without even noticing. Getting lost without even realising. Because his mind was stuck on what he witnessed just moments ago.
"I think you've had too much wine as well, John."
Sherlock only hummed, hadn’t yet found his voice back. He looked at the pavement slowly vanishing beneath his feet. Eventually he felt the tightness in his throat ease.
Suddenly some events and observations fell in place for John and he scowled internally. Some of Sherlock’s formerly seemingly inconvenient reactions became suddenly more than understandable. He put a hopefully comforting hand on Sherlock’s knee and was relieved and pleased when Sherlock’s hand joined his. The purple coloured nails though, led his thoughts off track, reminding him of places they had been… He was pulled from his pretty pleasant memories when Sherlock picked up his explanation again.
Eyes closed. Hand dropping. Clenching the phone.
“Why tomorrow?” Greg crinkled his forehead in confusion.
The cab ride home was as quiet as the one earlier that evening. Only, Miss Pirate had her eyes closed, head dropped back on the backrest and John let her be. At one point John spotted a movement out of the corner of his eyes and turned. He smiled, spotting the hand resting palm up on the seat between them. He tenderly took it and laced their fingers and as if in a snap the tension in the car eased; Miss Pirate turned her head, opened her eyes and smiled warmly at him.
John waited a moment if there would be any more, but when nothing came he turned and more murmured than said out loud: “Well, at least you’re talking to me again.”
These were the things he had been complaining about talking to Mike sitting on a park bench, sipping at his coffee.
“Yeah… yeah… of course!” John hurried to defend himself. “That was not what I… No. No, I didn't mean…” he huffed. Shaking his head a bit he chuckled and looked up at the man.
“I just need to understand,” John said, continuing their silent communication out loud.
But he wanted to understand John. He
This couldn't be it though, could it? He couldn’t go on like this, otherwise he would grow old until he’d retire, and all he would have left would be the loving relationship with his left hand. No, he had to take matters in hand. Although, not in the way he usually did...
In a flash, Sherlock jumped off the bed in all his naked glory and started rummaging in cabinets, picked up his phone, made for the bedroom door. He stopped on his way, looked at a flummoxed John who was still sitting on the bed.
Apparently John had misjudged where the line was drawn between friendship and… something else, something more. Despite Sherlock's belief, John wasn't very experienced with friendships. Yes, people easily took a liking to him. Although first of all, most of the time that wasn't reciprocal. John had just learned to adopt socially appropriate and friendly behaviour to gain people's trust, being a doctor and all. People responded very easily to that, misjudging his thorough care and treatment and interest as friendship. People were usually idiots though. Because the second thing was, only very rarely, almost never, it really turned into friendship. And honestly, even then he sucked at being a friend. He barely met his so called friends, rarely texted, never called. The occasional contact, work related, birthdays, unintentional run-into-each-others  and catch-up-over-coffee-to-go. How much were such friendships worth? Actually, John had acquaintances. And then, he had Sherlock. So, how was he supposed to know what real friendship involved? Felt like? Let alone a best-friend-friendship. A soulmate-friendship. A life-saving-friendship.
like a shared secret between only the two of them. Of course, there had also been the 2am torturing of the strings, but John missed even that. Wasn't that, too, something that belonged to a life with Sherlock Holmes? Just as empty fridges, stacks of unpaid bills, having to bring the weirdest garments of disguise to the cleaner? Just as ruined tv-shows, night time take away, an uncommented new bought jumper on his bed? Just as breakfast with newspaper? Just as two chairs in front of the fireplace? He missed all of it. He missed Sherlock.
“And not the point. Not really difficult, too." Greg nodded to himself. "Point is: any progress? With… whatever?” Greg raised his eyebrows.
Something in that wording struck John weird, but he couldn’t exactly pinpoint what it was. Sherlock was already up and about, hurrying to their bedroom in a flourish, and John almost didn’t get a chance to ask.
All the while the music kept roaring, his mates cheered loudly; John didn’t notice any of this.
"Why ever not?" He said frostily, emphasising each word, living up to the reputation of the iceman that preceded him.
The music faded, John tapped the screen again and silence spread in the room uncomfortably. Even the water seemed to stop sloshing against the outer shell of the boat. Both men cautious, tentative, hesitant.
Sherlock swallowed. A lump forming in his throat.
"No, John, it is…"
But the moment he was about to voice his thoughts, as if he sensed it, Sherlock picked up to play again. As if to stop him.
way obviously—but he had to be quick to catch her by surprise. Wait... chatting? They were... Chatting? Sherlock? John frowned. Oh well, but then this wasn't Sherlock but Miss Pirate. He still hadn't gotten used to her on an everyday-day-life basis. He wondered if he ever would and if he even wanted to. She was special in every way and to him she always would be.
was searching and waiting and hoping.” She had scowled. “So sad that he moved out.”
There was silence on the other end and John already wondered if he had misunderstood or if Scott didn't remember. He already was about to start explaining, but then…
“I guess,” he said, followed by a comfortable mutual silence. Watching nightly London from the window seat he had flopped into, John wondered when he had last felt this not-lost in a silence and this not-trapped in a conversation.
"Sorry, love. I'm sorry. Maybe I should have warned you." Some last giggles escaped his lips. He straightened and looked apologetically at Sherlock.
“Not since you, no.” Sherlock studied him with wonder in his eyes as if this was the first time he saw him. “I have always been a selfish bastard. Never taking other people’s feelings into account. Then you came and you showed me that I was able to care for others after all.”
Sherlock had thought... it would give John the life he always wanted.
He had carried Sherlock, who was much lighter and felt much smaller than expected, to Mycroft's still waiting car. The driver hadn't asked. He hadn't wasted time and drove off to Baker Street. He had raised the partition to give them some privacy and John had held Sherlock, whispering in his ear to be strong, to hold on. He told him he'd be there, he'd take care. He promised him that he'd make sure that Sherlock would be alright. He had made a vow… he'd ensure Sherlock would get anything he'd need… everything… nothing less and nothing more.
John was stunned into silence. How…? Just —
“Obviously.” From the sound of it, Scott had grit his teeth, breathing sharply through his nose.
"Hey, hey, calm down. We're all in the same boat here, right?" the man said in a friendlier voice, but John didn't miss the devious belligerent spark in the man's eyes contradicting his pacifying behaviour. John narrowed his eyes.
"Christ, Sherlock!" John hissed as if Sherlock had just confessed to have kidnapped someone. "Alright, alright." he tried to calm down. "It's nothing," he mumbled to himself while preparing and arranging everything, "can shave a face, can shave an arse, skin and hair, skin and hair, all the same…"
Feeling the sting of pain on his scalp some of the fog in his mind started to clear up. He tried to assemble all the loose flittery snippets of his impressions to form a bigger picture. Then, suddenly, he wondered... where had Sherlock even come from? He had been well dressed, well groomed, well nourished… at least for his standards… so he had to live somewhere equipped enough to make that possible. No bolthole, no homeless network, no Wiggins would be able to achieve that. As realisation dawned he could barely contain his fury. An angry outcry and a fist hurt from punching a wall later he fumbled for his phone. Mustering all his patience he tried to calm his thoughts and come up with a plan for how to proceed.
Sherlock was rubbing his eyes. This was really getting to him. This was not what he had planned for. His mind should have slowed down by now. He should have been able to sort his thoughts by now. He should have been working on storing away his sentiments. He should have been preparing to face the next day, to get through it, to stay at distance, not to let John come to close. Dangerous.
Was that a winky face, John? Did you wink at me?
he needed a battle-plan. Lacking any reliable data, he had to work his way onwards from the only indisputable fact in this disaster
“Don’t be daft. There’s only one line with a stop called ‘Chancery Lane’.” Scott huffed and John groaned and face palmed himself the moment he realised the next stop had just been announced. “However, that’s not the point of interest," Scott went on snootily, "What I do want to know is, what in the vicinity of St.Pauls at this time of the day can possibly be more important than calling
A cruel smile played across Mycroft’s face. He was going to enjoy making this one talk. “Gregory. I shall require my tools now.” He called out towards the two way mirror. He began unbuttoning his wrist cuffs as his victim studied him curiously.
"Sherlock, we can take this slow, if you'd like to."
This apparently infuriated the man further, because he proceeded to shove Sherlock aggressively.
Sherlock's vision went black.
"I concur." Cas agreed. He looked over at Sam, who was smiling weakly at the seraphim. "There is a plethora of information and resources in this bunker."
The creature chuckled half heartedly. “Show’s how much you imbeciles know.” A roll of the eyes echoed his distain for the humans in front of him. “Oh?” Mycroft questioned. He picked up a small blade, eyed it thoughtfully, then replaced it on the tray. He returned his gaze to his victim, then preceded to pick up a simple hammer.
3 Years B.J.W.
“You killed my mate. Now I’m going to kill yours.”
The color drained slightly from Greg's face as his brain struggled to process the information. That could't be real, could it? How come he was only finding out about it now? Shouldn't he be required to know these things? How was he supposed to protect London if he didn't know about the added terrors lurking in the shadows? I mean, fuck, it was bad enough without the monsters.
John chuckled. “You’ve got that right! You know his brother, Mycroft?”
“Huh?” He said unintelligibly and dropped his hands. “Oh, uh, yes.” He answered before plopping down ungracefully into Sherlock’s armchair. (It was the closest.)
“I. Don’t. Know!” The vamp reiterated with a shout. Mycroft raised the hammer and swung it down onto the vampire’s middle finger, crushing the fingertip.
Mycroft Holmes sat upon a rigid throne behind a fortress of mahogany, diligently attending to the never-ending stacks of paperwork on his desk. He had just released a quiet sigh of discontent when his assistant, Anthea, alerted him to an important incoming call.
He closed his eyes. No. No, he wouldn't have. He can't. He didn't. Did he?
Take care and stay safe everyone!
“Wait... What?” John frowned. What was that supposed to mean?
Probably such a commanding tone wouldn't exactly help to make Sherlock cooperate, John thought.
John’s head snapped around. There he was, the creep.
“We’ve only just met and we're going to... what... live together?” he asked, making sure to add some teasing to his voice.
John looked up at him, intensely observing him, scanning his face. He loosened his hold on Sherlock and Sherlock immediately craved his touch to be back.
"Well, apparently it
“Heard of the term ‘drag queen’ before?” the stranger asked with a tad annoyance in his voice, accompanied by an unnecessarily dramatic eye roll.
John stood slowly and said while stretching his back, “Yes, of course. Anything in? Sorry, didn’t check…,” and marched over to the kitchen counter.
"Yes, home." he just said. What else was there to say?
In the end it was John who broke the spell, starting to feel awkward, his hand against Sherlock's cheek, occasionally trading his fingers through the hair above his ear.
John wasn’t sure if it was part of Sherlock’s routine not to move or if time had just conveniently stopped. Actually he didn’t care. All he did care about was that he had opportunity enough to revel in the sight of the gorgeous creature in front of him on stage; dimly lit by orange spotlight on the one side and a green one on the other; the colours alternatingly fading in and out, creating a transcendent and surreal air around Miss Pirate whose purple dress was oddly accentuated by the light. As if it was popping out, a hologram. John was almost tempted to reach out with his hand to see if Miss Pirate was physical or just a projected image. The fog suddenly wavering around her ankles didn’t help one bit to let the ethereal creature appear any more real. She was the adored heroine out of his most fantastic dream; a dream that had become his life.
“You want to… watch.” Sherlock put it as a statement although the slight hitch of his voice at the end showed John that he was in the process of investigating, deducing, narrowing down. So it was actually a question to be answered. Why didn’t he dare to ask? John had thought it would have been fairly obvious what his intentions were.
When the moment finally arrived, he got comfy on his bed, because that’s what one did in this kind of situation — thanks for the instruction, Scott! John grinned. Glass of wine at the ready for some mental support, changed into pyjama pants to make it more practical... uhm, no, more comfy! That’s what he meant!
After having finished his shower quickly, he got ready, put on his jacket and shoes for the second time today and wandered off without destination. He was hell-bent to check out those clubs he didn’t know where to find. On a mission to get the real thing by anyone who wouldn’t at all remind him of a certain someone he didn’t even know. It wouldn’t do to cling to a voice for the rest of his days, would it? Better get something more...meaty…
"No." Strangled, as if it had escaped against his will.
"Well, applying eye make-up makes one look like a carp with a seizure. I don't desire you witnessing that." he said totally unfazed. "Better go, dress yourself. I've prepared everything you need in the room upstairs."
the hair, no?”
"You're the brother of the Queen after all," John said, his lips curling into a wicked grin.
But he couldn't help it. He couldn't change it.
And Sherlock had heard him. He had heard him. He had let John conduct the light. He had let John punch him in the face. He had let John watch him die. Twice.
Just for fun: does anyone know where I got the inspiration for John's fancy slippers from? 😉
“Okay, here we are then...
After that text message from Sherlock, after Sherlock had apparently discovered the song and understood what John had wanted to say, John had gotten cold feet. He hadn’t dared to answer immediately, overwhelmed by the sheer amount of possible outcomes of such a talk. He started to wonder if he maybe had only acted upon the hope Sherlock would decline anyway. Always easy to blame someone else for your own cowardice.
"..."
“Okay then, come on.” John said, turned towards him and took Sherlock’s other hand as well.
“I thought we agreed on no more assumptions?” Sherlock said, without any hurt or accusation.
The lights went back on and John’s heart sank. The stage was empty, Miss Pirate gone.
This left him with the glorious view of the ringlets peeking out from under the hat ending in that endearing nape curl he loved to run his fingertips over when he was kissing Sherlock. His gaze was drawn to the sharp contrast of black lace covering pale skin where the long irresistible-to-kiss neck merged into the finely muscled planes of the upper back. The slender arms held up over the head stretched the lean torso and it appeared even more slim and trim, accentuated by the lace crisscrossing down the back, holding together the delicate purple corset, forcefully tightened by his own hands earlier this evening. John’s mind helpfully—or not so helpfully—added the memory of how he had run his hands along Sherlock’s sides, warmed by Sherlock’s body heat, his breath pushing gently against his hands in a slow rhythm. The tingling of the soft velvet on his palms interrupted by the slightly scratchy sensations of silvery embroidery and black lace, which looked now, in the light of the stage, even more glamorous than back in their bedroom.
to. Yeah, I’d really really like that. It can be really nice. Thought about it more than once…” he said, calmy, holding Sherlock’s gaze.
“I said
"JOHN!"
John blushed. He felt caught out, which shouldn’t have surprised him, facing the most observant man on the planet.
“Becaus’ I don’ ev’n know what thingsss you like Sherlock. Do you like thingsss at all? I never hear you or sssomething. I tried you know, really hard, haha… hard… but I never heard you. Pity.” John said when Sherlock arrived in front of his door. Sherlock threw the door open the moment John asked, “Do you hear me when I’m wankin’ here upstairsss?”
“Sherlock. I can’t stand this either.” John started, but of course Sherlock couldn’t wait for him to finish.
“I have to say though that there might have been one or two complaints...” The smirk in Scott's voice was obvious even without visuals, which really was a pity.
The stale smell of take away food reminded John of yesterday's feast; one a bit of a different kind than initially intended though.
John spun around and gaped up. Eyes widening when he saw his stranger slouching casually on the edge of the flat roof of the club, holding a cigarette between long fingers with nails still painted, and lazily blowing smoke into the air. Why was this making his heart jump?

"This is not funny, John. Complete strangers with ridiculous names like Big-D-Watson or Johnlock4evA or ShagCockHolmes… what is that even supposed to mean… they're offering…
Until he realised that it had been a slight beat sneaking into the music. He was only aware that it was missing the moment it faded.
“Sorry, I was… I thought I’d make use of the nice weather and… the boat, you know, have to keep up, needs a lot of maintenance…,” he rambled. Still not looking at John.
"And I think," Mycroft cleared his throat, "it has to be you."
By now, he had an inkling where this evening would lead to, but he had absolutely no need to let that happen. If this was the glorious idea Mike has had then… no, thank you very much.
“I came prepared, John. I’m not stupid.” he said low. John only huffed. As if...
"No, I'm not." the man simply said. And after a short moment, "how could you tell though?"
Threading the fingers of one hand into the hair at the back of John's head and gripping it tightly, Sherlock sped up his movements, desperately, forcefully almost pulling all the way off, slamming himself down again. "And I want to… I want to…" he muttered and grunted insistently. "I want to, John." Taking a free sharp breath, he fleetingly closed his eyes. "Oh God, John… Oh Gooood… I…," his eyes opened again, piercing John. "I want to… stay! Oh God, yes, please…
Greg's look at John softened a bit as he asked quietly, “Isn't that exactly what you already were… are?”
"But when we met…" he tried to sort his thoughts, "that club we went to, where you danced… you, uhm, tucked there, right? No way you could have..." He frowned. "All those blokes I've been with, they went there for "the girls"..." he mimicked the quotes. "I know for a hundred percent that they're not gay. If they'd even spotted a glimpse of… I mean, it's not particularly easy to hide, is it?" he went for a joke, winked and nodded in the direction of Sherlock's crotch.
He hadn’t dealt well, at first. Later, he had found his way, his weapons, his armour to not lose the battle against his worst enemy
John turned to look at him, caressing him with his gaze. His eyes softened.
"Gregory Lestrade." He shouted. "What. The. Hell. Was. THAT?"
"Yes, John. I will."
“Get your fingers wet.” John demanded in a low growl.
Lots of love,
He tried to get it back under control. It was like a force breaking free, a wild creature having been captured for far too long. He had to tame it. He had to face it.
He never left the property.
?" he asked sultry, voice deep and dark, while gripping the hem of his vest and pulling it up and off in one fluid movement.
“Do we?” John looked puzzled.
“Uhm… because there were things I had to do?” he said a bit evasively.
He had thought… he had
“Huh?” What was he on about?
"..."
He lowered his gaze.
A deep rumbling hum emerged from Sherlock's throat when John massaged his scalp, the foam slowly sliding down Sherlock's temples and neck. John's cock stirred as a predictable reaction to that most sinful and erotic sound and John spotted, hidden under the water surface, that Sherlock was in a similar state. But they both ignored it—or rather not ignored, as they were both well aware of it, but they didn't pay it any attention. Somehow, it wasn't important this moment. This moment was about something else altogether. It was about warm skin on warm skin; it was about curls becoming soft again; it was about fingers sliding through them; it was about gentle kisses and content hums.
Well, that was unexpected. And different from all the other times he'd watched such a performance.
ended in chaos. Dangerous.
= chapter 1-6,
"Hm, however God is definitely not my shepherd. I have my own one."
Hey, I'm back 👋
, I never came close enough to reveal what was hidden under my skirt—even though they no doubt assumed, I never gave anyone any physical confirmation. Except you. Also, I never enjoyed it myself—at least not the way I did with you..." Sherlock winked.
The sheer luck they'd had filled John with deep humility and awe. It had been one of the rare occasions that the stars had aligned. John refused to think that it was just coincidence; this wasn't just the deed of a lazy universe. John smiled fondly at Sherlock and reached out to caress his cheek.
"Caring is not an advantage; all lives end. It'll burn a heart out of you." Sherlock whispered.
"I normally don't come that close, John. Normally it's all pure acting. It wasn't with you." Sherlock said calmly.
So he prayed to God that she wouldn’t slip the shirt off of his shoulders and tried to stay calm.
John laughed heartily, for the first time in a long while, and shook his head. These two idiots, didn't see what was right in front of them.
"And now that you've decided to give us this chance," John continued with a lump in his throat, "I think we can do it. I really think we can make this work, if only we do it together. I'm not wasting this chance, okay? I promise you to do better." He swallowed. Damn, the intensity of the emotions almost choked him. He had to get this out. He wanted to. He forced himself to go on, his voice rough and a bit shaky. "I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. But that’s the point. Who you thought I was ... is the man who I want to be. You make me a better man, Sherlock."
"Drugs."
It worked out well for a while until one day Greg called.
“How do you think that would have been received?” Mycroft asked with a small voice, a pained look in his eyes… powerless… as he only ever was regarding his little brother.
“All of it!” Sherlock answered, voice just as affected.
If John would know what Sherlock really wanted him to fight for, for what Sherlock would willingly surrender, it would ruin everything!
“Impossible!” Scott snapped.
Home. Home was a scruffy flat. Home was no milk in the fridge. Home was two chairs in front of a hearth. Home was a boiling kettle. Home was socked feet coming down the stairs. Home was hideous jumpers. Home was grumpy swearing. Home was greying hair and bright blue eyes.
"If I'm that uncomfortable, you
to.” Firm enough, spat out even at the end. Not good. Too much.
Standing still, nearly choking on his own breath, Sherlock absorbed the words, tried to weave them into his tissue, make them part of his being.
“But… what about Molly?” He asked, a bit sceptical now. How could John not have thought about her until now? He knew exactly why though. He had been too perplexed. Not that he had any problems with it, but seeing Mycroft Holmes in such a state of agitation had been an experience on a heretofore wholly unknown level. And Greg? Flirting this boldly? Above all, with… well…
*stop*
John ran a hand through his greying hair. Lifting his eyes, looking at the ceiling.
"I think a shower is in order," he said.
This girl, she had a friend, her only friend. He was a street cleaner. He was very wise even if he appeared to be unremarkable - entirely unjustified in Sherlock's opinion.  One time, she took a walk with this friend, who was sweeping the street with his broom. She asked him how he managed not to get hopeless in the face of the long street ahead. How could he keep going and not give up? ‘Sometimes’ he had said, ‘sometimes there's a long road ahead and if you only ever focus on the end of the road, on the end of your path, you will think you'll never be able to do it. You get exhausted and anxious, you'll hesitate and doubt and in the end you are not a single step closer to your goal. But if you take one step at a time, just one step, one sweep with your broom, in the end you'll see that you did the whole street without even noticing. And you'll be happy. And that's important.’
It took five more days until Mycroft one evening announced a time and date for the briefing. Finally. Only two more days. Actually even only one and a half, if one took into consideration that the briefing would take place in the early afternoon. Which meant half a day less to wait. Which meant his departure was near. Which meant release from this mental and physical prison he lived in. Which meant Sherlock felt… relieved. Yes, that was what he felt. Probably.
Tense with nerves John took one cautious step after the other. He clutched his phone in a tight fist at his side… one never knew. It felt disturbingly similar to holding his gun when he was silently following in the wake of Sherlock, most of the time not even knowing what they were up to, what to expect - having Sherlock's back nonetheless.
When Sherlock stayed quiet, John sensed that it wasn’t the whole story. He ran one of his feet up and down Sherlock’s calf to calm him. It seemed to work, at least a bit as Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed. When their eyes met again, John nodded encouragingly at Sherlock to indicate he should go on.
used all of the cans. So,
He had seemed not to be aware of John’s presence.
“Love,” he murmured softly and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open. “Why don’t you get out of the shower first, wrap yourself in one of your probably insanely expensive towels and get the bedroom ready?” He searched Sherlock’s eyes who studied him, trying to deduce him, apparently without much success. The brilliant brain shut down by a bit of fooling around. A small fond smile spread on John’s lips. “Give me five minutes to finish here and I’ll follow you, yeah?”
, John thought, trying to convince himself that he had regained some composure, but actually he couldn’t stand it anymore. He was, once again, fleeing from it. Shutting it down, burying this part of his past deep down in his soul, shut away in a gold-shot treasure chest. ‘
He didn't step back though, for it was something he was not willing to do anymore, at least not in regard to Sherlock. All he wanted was to take that last step forwards and close the last remaining gap between them, but he
Mycroft led him to his study, directed Sherlock to one of the plush chairs in front of the windows and planted a tumblr of something in Sherlock's hand. Sherlock had no idea what it was. Because he didn't care. That was the plan. It burned down his throat. That's all he needed to know. Unfortunately, it didn't reach his heart.
He inhaled deeply and realised that he had slowed his steps. He was still trying to avoid it. This was ridiculous. He wanted it. Sherlock had agreed on it. He had even been the one to initiate it in the end, after John’s lame drunken attempts. He was still embarrassed about it, but well… it had led to this. So, that was… good. Kind of. Wasn’t it?
A pensive silence fell between them, each man lost in his own thoughts.
The topic of amnesia was novel to me, so I had to do a lot of research. Sherlock's research is basically my research (and it really was this bizarre!!). I can't guarantee the accuracy of all facts (you all know the internet)... so, my apologies for possibly incorrect information to everyone with experiences or expertise with amnesia!!
he didn't mind one bit. On the contrary, the humming anticipation simmering underneath his skin made it more than welcome.
"This is… nice. I… like it."
“As you wish, Captain." was Scott's eager response. "The game is on!”
blaring from the kitchen radio’s speakers.
By now more than a bit bored he called himself to attention, wondering if he should sneak over to the bar and get himself a drink. He hadn’t even averted his eyes from the stage for a fraction of a second, when a familiar sound of creaking wood and roaring wind pierced his attention. He spun around with a speed that almost gave him whiplash and all of a sudden his boredom had gone up in smoke. His heart pounded in his ears and his lungs decided to forego oxygen. Apparently with immediate effect on his brain, because… A case? Case, who? Other dancers? When? Where? He wouldn’t know…
"Stop this annoying… Oh. Christmas Tree."
In high spirits and with high hopes, he set out for the start of the rest of his life. He had decided to take the bus to Victoria station and walk the rest of the way. He took his time, to calm his mind, to clear his head. He came through St.James Park. He loved to watch the ducks there and to sit on one of the benches, thinking back to the moment when he had tried to tell Sherlock that he was one of the two people who had turned his life around. That he had done the same for him as Mary had when Sherlock couldn’t. But then… Sherlock had been the first! Sherlock was the first, his first, so many times and in so many ways. Only, the git hadn’t even waited for John to finish his sentence and had vanished into thin air. So typical, always avoiding the emotional bits, but not today. Today he’d have to listen. John leisurely walked past Covent Garden, enjoyed the sun on his face, the relaxed early summer buzz in the city. It was morning still, not holiday season yet, London was enlivened by Londoners. John let his gaze and mind roam, seeing Sherlock and himself at every corner, past cases passing his memory. The swelling noise of traffic and the chatter of people, footfalls of slendering or hurrying passers-by, an occasional dog, a lost seagull, the bell of a bike rushing past him. The smell of the first cafés opening, serving breakfast and coffee, the inevitable car exhaust, the underlying London typical mix of nearby water and millions of multicultural lives lived. All of it caused a feeling of safeness within John, a feeling of comfort. Of being home.
In the Impala, on the way back to the bunker, Dean wondered what the hell Metatron was on about.

Mycroft entered the cold, bare, interrogation room and closed the door behind him. His gaze pierced the unfortunate vampire that was chained to the steel table by reinforced restraints, specifically designed to accommodate supernatural strength.

"Please tell me that's everything." Sam groaned as Dean handed him another large stack of files.
"Oh." Dean deflated. "Well, what about the rest of these?" He asked, gesturing to a vast expanse of weapons laid out on a table in front of them.
"I'm afraid I can't indulge."
"Huh. Thought there might have been
“Perhaps I could help. Remove your shirt.”
John grabbed Sherlock by the back of the neck with one hand, and braced his other against the couch to keep himself from falling onto the detective, and kissed him. Hard. (As possible, with the head injury.)
“I don’t know if I should be telling you this, but when I got home today I opened up the fridge to grab something, and there was a bloody
Sam grabbed it and unfolded it. “It looks like some sort of spell.”
Dean watched in horror as their hands were forcefully pulled from one another by the force of the portal, and in an instant, he was gone.
Another groan left him when he realized he wasn't alone. Lestrade was there, sitting on a bench opposite him, and he was staring intently at Sherlock.
"What the hell do you think you're doing? Let me go!" Sherlock shouted. "I need to examine the body! You need me! You need my help!-"
Five years B.J.W (Before John Watson)
After a few moments in thoughtful silence, Mycroft reached over to retrieve his glass of scotch from the desk and took a tentative sip.
"YOU COMPLETE AND UTTER SOD! Oh my God! You really are that clueless!"
“A spell for what?” Kevin asked.
“Pretty sure your suit’s not gonna survive either.” Greg snipped.
?" The Winchester questioned, pointing at the stabby stick.
Sam reached out for the file, then quickly skimmed it when Dean handed it over. "A necklace. Huh." He mused. "So, you think it'll work for a dragon skull?"
John's heart beat rapidly against his ribs. Sherlock was definitely being strangled by this crazy man.
“Uh, yeah. I mean, again, it didn’t make much sense. He said something about Hercules and, uh…what’s the other dude’s name? Achilles? Yeah. I don’t know, maybe those were his favorite stories or something.”
John cleared his throat. “So…national importance?”
Greg’s confusion and hesitation was written across his features.
Sherlock braced John's hips and rolled his up, craving more friction. He was growing hard from all of this new attention, and by the feel of this latest action, so was his doctor.
“Well, now, hey. It’s not what it looks like.” John defended.
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't." He voiced sternly. "You can't honestly expect to be allowed to do your 'consulting detective' thing, if you continue to put drugs in your system. I don't care how good you are, there are RULES, Sherlock. Rules that even YOU have to follow."
“Extraterrestrial being?” Kevin echoed in disbelief.
“Well, if he hasn’t driven you out with all his madness by now, I’d say you’re doing just fine.”
Mycroft looked down at Greg's shoes as one corner of his mouth turned up in smirk (He seemed to be doing a lot of that in Gregory's presence.) before redirecting his gaze back to Greg's dark chocolate eyes. "I suppose if you really must put a word to it, then yes."
"I do hope that you find time to relax and unwind from time to time." Lestrade's voice dipped in tone as Mycroft had inched closer to him, and he found himself sitting fully back onto the ledge of his desk. "All work and no play make Johnny a dull boy, after all."
“I’m not one of them. I’m not an archangel. I’m really more run of the mill. I worked in the secretarial pool before God chose me to take down the word. Anyway, he seemed very worried about his work, what’d happen to it when he left. So, He had me write down instructions. Then, he was gone.”
"...brother..." Greg said the word quietly and thoughtfully, like he was testing it out. "Alright." He stated, steeling himself a bit more and looking directly at the eldest Holmes brother. "What is it that you want to talk about?"
“I’m sorry John, how was the lay-out?” Sherlock thought to ask, again changing the subject.
Dean drew a quick drink from his bottle. “Atypical. Yeah, that describes us pretty well.” He chuckled. “We can work it all out later, for now let’s just go to bed.” He stood upright and offered his hand out to Cas, who took it.
As soon as the aforementioned creatures entered the hall, Sherlock and John ambushed them. Then they rushed in on the other two.
******************************************
"Ah, bloody Christ!" Lestrade threw his whole body into the statement. His body tensed, he dipped his head, and his hands shot up. "I should have known. What with all the drama and the craziness that this," Greg gestured around the room and back towards the car, "whole meeting puts off. Geez, Is everything with Sherlock this obnoxious?"
"Yes, my apologies, Detective Inspector Lestrade. But it was imperative that we met as soon as possible."
Mycroft sighed in displeasure and the grip on his glass tightened slightly. He should just cut it off here. Gregory was right about their jobs being connected. If things were allowed to continue, there could be some detrimental consequences.
Whatever the fuck that’s supposed to mean.” John laughed.
“But it’s the solar system!” John cried.
Greg practically snorted in amusement. “You’re good for him, you know.”
Dean looked down at the angel's hand on his torso, then back up at Cas. Was he trying to protect him from re-experiencing hell?
"Well, Detective Inspector Lestrade, as the elder brother it is my utmost responsibility to ensure Sherlock's safety, general well being, and to clean up his messes. However, because of the minor position that I hold in the British government, Sherlock's...escapades...tend to often interfere directly with my line of work." Mycroft sighed heavily and the D.I. took the opportunity to speak.
A shot rang out in the quiet of the night.
Alas, it was nice to write about season 8 Destiel, it's one of my favorite seasons for them and it would have been an excellent place for canon Destiel. <3
"It took a week for Hepaestas to make
John smiled and shrugged. “Guess he’s stuck with me then, whether he likes it or not, the insufferable git.”
Cas looked like he was exhausted with Dean's antics already. "It's Lucifer's Spear. And it took me a while to get because it was locked away in one of his ancient crypts."
Cas' brows scrunched slightly as he quickly scanned over the objects. "None of these are what we require for the spell." He scowled.
The angel squinted his eyes and tilted his head as he tried to read the reasoning behind Dean's response on his face. He wasn't very good at reading people, However. Human emotions and feelings were still so complicated to him. He found his gaze settling onto the hunter's lips, and he subconsciously licked his own.
“I’m the scribe of God. I erased it.” The angel answered.
John huffed in response and then retreated into the kitchen to make tea. It seemed as though things were going to go right back to normal.
The soldier locked eyes with the detective, searching for answers to unasked questions.
“Why?” The D.I. pressed as he folded his arms over his chest.
Sam dropped the files he was holding onto the war room table and clutched his head just as Dean sat down.
“Yeah, well, he probably wanted everyone to think that he was. The cowardly bastard. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. We know what the third trail is now. Sam can get back to normal. And every evil thing lurking in hell will be locked up tight in the pit. Forever.” Dean stated.
“If you’re so keen, why don’t you investigate it?” Sherlock retaliated.
John practically snorted. That fun and excitement had almost killed Sherlock just a week prior.
An undeterminable amount of time later, Sherlock stirred and became vaguely aware of a dull pain shooting up through his left shoulder. His mouth was also devastatingly dry, and his head pounded. He groaned loudly as he readjusted into an uprighted position. A flimsy blanket fell off of him and onto the floor in a pathetic heap.
“Well, for starters, I am not a hunter. I am a man of letters.” Mycroft explained as he carefully rolled up his sleeves and re-buttoned them at the elbow. “I’m also a man of impeccable taste and I would prefer not to get blood stains on my Westwood attire.”
******************************
"Oh."
There was more silence. Then the door swung open without any warning and the Detective Inspector fell through the portal. "Shit!" He cursed when he landed, the folder knocked from his grasp and papers flying from it.
It took several more days for him to regain his voice. (That was an odd thing indeed, a silent Sherlock Holmes.)
“After that, the archangels took over. They cried and they wailed. They wanted their father back. I mean, we all did. But then, then they started to scheme. The archangels decided that if they couldn’t have dad, they’d take over the universe themselves. But they couldn’t do anything that big without the word of God. So, I began to realize maybe they would realize they needed me.“ The angel explained.
"I have a feeling that you hold a much higher position in the government than you've lead on. With the way you just said that." Greg laughed cheekily. Then his demeanor turned serious as his gaze wondered ravenously along the length of Mycroft's lean body. "A true man of power." He mused. "I'm glad the responsibility falls on such deserving and capable shoulders."
He was beginning to wonder if this guy would even show up tonight.
Sherlock wondered how he had gone all this time without this sort of connection before. But he didn't want to do it again, if it wasn't with John.
Now it was Sherlock's turn for a brain malfunction. The addition of tongue felt so...erotic. And in public! He could have scolded John for his boldness.
Ah. Yes. He had come straight from the drug den, clad in sweats and a hoodie. A far cry from his usual attire of dress wear topped with his Belstaff.
"Where is she?" He demanded boisterously. "I need to see her!"
John had a liking for french kissing, it seemed. The feel of the other man's tongue felt even more delightfully sinful here, in a private setting.
Once he was sure that he was indeed, tangible, Dean pulled him in with all of his might for a fierce hug. He buried his head into Cas' shoulder and he sobbed.
His gaze shifted over to John, and his voice became less stern. "I'm glad your both okay. Make sure he gets plenty of rest." With that, he excused himself.
He threw it in park and nearly jumped out of the car. “Cas?”
Well, alright then. When and where? GL
The vamp contemplated this as he reeled from the pain of shattered kneecaps. “He…our father…can send messages…to all vampires, telepathically.”
“Never mind your usual trivia, this is of national importance.” Mycroft chided.
“He said…” Dean took a moment to remember. “They didn’t survive on their character alone and that they all had a weak spot."
He stood up straighter and squared his shoulders. "Then I need to know as much as possible about what's out there, and how to kill it."
"What in the bloody hell do think you're playing at? Do you have any idea who I am?!?" A gentleman with salt and pepper hair barked as he exited the sleek black car in the middle of the warehouse. The sound of the passenger door slamming echoed through the building. Anthea quickly and quietly guided him over in her bosses direction, before returning to the vehicle.
“Something I’ve got on, It’s just too big, can’t spare the time.” Sherlock rambled absently.
covered in feathers."
"Piss off ya wanker." John warned in a dangerous voice.
"Hey, so uh, none of the weapons we have in the bunker are what we need for the heroes spell." Dean informed him as he approached the table.
"Sherlock!" John cried.
The gesture quietly softened something inside of Dean.
The memories from purgatory stung deep, bare to Dean's soul. The recent sightings of Cas had increased the frequency and the intensity of the flashbacks.
Mycroft sighed. (He was doing that a lot today too.) The lanky man then raised his left hand above his head, signaling his assistant. "Gregory, please." He practically whispered. "The sake of the world aside, I know you're fond of Sherlock and I suspect that you would like to see him reach his full potential as well."
The crisp night air felt nice against John's skin as he emerged from the taxi to follow Sherlock to the front of the line.
"Right." Greg's smile grew impossibly larger and he chuckled.
"Alas, the work that he's begun recently is good for him, as well as your police force. I don't wish to discourage it, only to monitor it." He finished.
“Well, did he say that Sam would feel better after the completion of the trials?”
He slid his hands up the exposed flesh from hips, to stomach, to chest. Then leaned in to nibble on Sherlock's ear while his fingertips ghosted over the detective's sensitive nipples.
"Don't like it, don't look. There are plenty of other couples here displaying their affections towards each other." Sherlock stated calmly.
"Hey, ya heard him. Piss off." The bartender shouted, now that he had been alerted to the situation by the commotion of it all.
Sam leaned back into his seat and bit the inside of his bottom lip. "So, your boyfriend took off without you then?"
Greg managed to huff out a laugh in return. He didn’t want to reveal too much in case John decided not to stick around after all. It seemed Sherlock was being careless with the truth, but that didn’t really surprise the old copper.
"So, I, uh, failed your test, huh?" The hunter pursed his lips and nodded. "I get it. But you know what? If you were to wave that magic...time traveling wand of yours, and we had to do it all over again, I would make the same call." He stared defiantly at Cas as he finished his words. The angel returned the stare and so, Dean continued. "See, I don't know what's going to happen when these 'seals' are broken. Hell, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow." Dean shrugged. "What I do know is, that this, here." He gestures to the playground. "These kids, the swings, the trees, all of it. Is still here because of my brother and me."
he wanted to say.
Sentiment. He couldn't afford that. Not here. Not now. All he had come for was to pick up some essential items. And he had to be quick. Efficient. Efficiency had no room for sentiment. So he cleared his throat silently to fight off the dust. Walking through the flat, he definitely didn’t let his gaze stroke over the surfaces of the evidence of a life lived by a different man. Because he didn’t care. He didn’t care when he rushed through the living room to hurry to the bedroom as quickly as possible. He didn’t care when he threw purposefully too tight shirts in purposefully favourite colours of John's into a leather travel bag. He didn’t care when he picked up his journal with the most important notes on experiments including the study of abilities of one John Watson, army doctor. He didn’t care when he accidentally also picked up the shower gel that wasn’t his own from the bathroom. He didn’t care when he hesitated a moment in front of the kitchen cupboard which held the mugs, but then only opened the door next to it to pick up one of his experimenting kits. He also didn’t care when he searched for the power bank a furious John once had purchased but couldn’t find it and decided that he wouldn’t need it anyway. He didn’t care when he walked upstairs to check the upstairs bedroom for anything he might need… just to be sure… but there was nothing in it he wanted to take with him. Not anymore. He didn’t care when he put his violin and bow in their case and also gathered his sheets and compositions, all of them but one waltz he didn’t exactly like very much. He didn’t care when he reached for Billy the skull without even knowing why he even would be essential, but must be packed anyway.
“It's marginally leaning to the left,” Scott went on feeding John’s greedy mind, “foreskin slightly retracted, head visible at the tip. There’s also a bead of precome forming at the slit…” Scott’s voice was going darker and rougher by the minute. John almost couldn’t stand it anymore. He groaned and cursed. Eventually, Scott added, “And just to be clear, it’s fully erect,” he said, sharp and urgent, almost whining, “Painfully so…”
Miss Pirate shortly nodded to her, raised a hand to indicate that she'd be there in a moment and turned to look at John again.
When the morning came creeping in, pale and dreary, forcing it's vile fingers of smudgy grey light through the crack between the curtains, Sherlock hadn't slept at all. He forced himself to get up, put on his dressing gown and shuffle downstairs into the kitchen. He was lucky that nobody was around, although he was certain that the house was run as incessantly as an anthill. The coffee in the coffeemaker, ready and waiting, was proof enough as Sherlock was convinced Mycroft hadn't fixed his own coffee or tea since adulthood.
“Did you really think it would be better to leave than to just talk to me?” John whispered, his own head leaning forward, cheek almost touching curls. He untangled the hand not trapped by Sherlock’s, brushed his fingers over Sherlock’s temple and gave in to the urge to let them slowly slide through the dark brown mob of hair. He felt Sherlock shiver under his hand, stopped at the back of his head and played with the tips of the curls spiking there in all directions.

Thinking of Sherlock - again - John stopped in his tracks.
"Because you forced me to. You should have known I wouldn't if you forced me to."
,” He lowered the rest of the zipper without any hesitation left, felt the unmistakable bulge under his fingers. Sliding his hands around Sherlock’s hips, underneath the inconveniently tight waistband, he once more reached for that plush arse he had dreamt about far too many times. God, separated by the thin fabric of Sherlock’s pants only, it felt so much softer, warmer; so much more real. Stepping closer again, putting some pressure on his wrists, he eased the waistband over the curve of the behind he was holding firmly right now and finally Sherlock’s trousers slid down and pooled around his feet. Without wasting a second, Sherlock stepped out of it, simultaneously slipping out of his socks the same way John had witnessed him doing on that memorable day at Battersea; the last time John had seen Sherlock in not much more than his pants. Who would have thought then, that he would have this now. Not him.
*****
"What is?" Sherlock tilted his head, frowned. Everything was about John, but what was it to Molly? What issues would she have concerning John?
More clearing of his throat.
Sherlock all but inflated and threw himself dramatically on the sofa.
"Implies that you've not had—and let me quote you here—the full capacities of your mental abilities for the fricking rest of the fricking last couple of weeks?? Because you… you know… you didn't explain one single bloody thing to me!" John yelled.
It was only confirmed when the email he had sent returned, couldn’t be delivered, address unknown. When he discovered that even the blog was closed down, one more piece of his world shattered to shreds. Absolutely no way left to contact him. No sign of life. All strings cut. That was the moment he had thought about the disc. That miraculous thing that had suddenly appeared out of nowhere while Sherlock had been dead. Which had appeared when John had already been numb from grief, had been about to give up, had hit rock bottom. That miraculous thing through which Sherlock had talked to him, through which he had talked to Sherlock. A connection like a lifeline where none had been for an eternity. The thing that had given him hope against all odds.
"Come on, you." John murmured and pulled his partner up holding both hands.
“I’d say so, yeah.” Greg confirmed. “I just hope that silly idiot detective of yours has listened in, too! And if he has, I really hope for his own good that he’ll get up off his arse and finally does the right thing. Bloody git that he is!” Molly nudged him with her elbow in his side.
John tilted his head; he had noticed it himself. Of course, he had. Still, he didn’t fully understand—neither his emotions and behaviour nor what it had to do with whatever Sherlock wanted to say.
“He's been doing this for hours now, John,” came the quiet voice of Mycroft from much closer by than John had expected. A brief tentative squeeze of his shoulder. This unexpected and unusual gesture made it even worse.
After a while, when he inevitably had to move on to the next step, he instructed Sherlock to spread his cheeks for him in a husky voice he didn't quite recognise as his own. Sherlock lowered himself to rest on his chest to have his hands free to reach behind. When he glanced over his shoulder, his pitch black eyes piercing John with a heat that would be able to set ice on fire, a torrent of curses broke free from John's mouth, which he kept up all the way until he had managed the last careful stroke with the razor.
, damnit! He groaned in frustration.
"No," John barked out a laugh. "Rest assured, no need to serve the queen for me. That would be more my area anyway, I guess." He chuckled. Then, when he realised what he had said, he hastened to add, "Don't mean that in a kinky way though!" and winced.
“Should have known.” Scott grunted.
“Well, make whatever noise you need to just don’t be an idiot.”
"Are you alright, Mrs Hudson?"
“Did you finally tell John? I’m soooo glad!" Sherlock blushed and John frowned.
His breath got a bit raged in his desperation to assure John, to make him believe him.
However, before Sherlock was given any chance to react to it, John had rested both his hands on Sherlock's shoulders, put on a mirthful smirk and started to sway in sync to the music again. He swung his hips, tapped his feet in the worst possible impression of college times slow dance. Sherlock had always found them tedious and uncomfortable; in much too close proximity to too many idiots. He had tried to avoid those at all costs; somehow
Whatever he had imagined the first touch of their lips would be like, it wasn't this. There was no jolt of lightning, there was no heart-attack or nervous breakdown. All there was, and that was better than anything in the world, was a root deep feeling of rightness.
“Same with my parents, although I think they’re still not fully convinced. However, they rather react with concern and protectiveness; bestowing unannounced visits on me to check that I haven't turned the flat into a brothel.” He huffed out a humorless laugh.
“And what did you say to that?” Greg asked matter-of-fact.
He couldn't contain it any longer. His guards lowered by too much alcohol, too much talking about Sherlock, thinking of Sherlock, the yearning and longing for the man took over. Impatiently, he tugged at his pants to free his straining erection. He couldn't stop to stroke his cock, tight, fast, urgent. This wouldn't take long. Too much. Too sudden. Too desperately needed. Wanted. John was unable to hold back the images of Sherlock dancing, his lean body bending and twisting, that long neck being stretched even more and damp dark curls framing his flushed face. All this merging into his mind's pictures of a much more intimate context - Sherlock's skin flushed for totally different reasons, neck stretched for John to run his tongue all the way up along the carotid to Sherlock's jaw, his ear, nibbling and sucking his earlobe, his head thrown back in pleasure, panting, sweating, those flexible long legs folded around John's waist.
loving voice.
“Am not.”
After a moment of silence in which Sherlock cursed the noise of his own shallow breath, he could hear that John was speaking again. “Please? Would you do that? For me?” a hint of desperation swinging in the air.
"..."
As was to be expected Sherlock didn’t give in and tried to appear as unaffected by John’s reaction as possible. When the day went by and Sherlock not so much as mentioned the events in the morning again, John lowered the newspaper he was reading and turned to Sherlock who was sulking on the sofa.
That said, I hope you enjoy reading this chapter! I very much enjoyed writing it!
He turned while quickly finishing buttoning his shirt. He hastened to pick up his coat and grabbed the last remaining items lying in the dust… mobile phone, USB device, Bluetooth speaker, belt…
In between the steps his feet traced broad circles in the dust and he could feel the point of contact between his body and the ground, the dust being parted by his toes, leaving evidence of his progression by drawing patterns for everyone to see. Evidence. That he had been here. That he had let go. For a split second he wondered what the construction workers would think of it the next day, but was then pulled back under the blanket of the trance like state evoked by the music.
This wasn't the kind of carnal desire that asked for chasing satisfaction as fast as possible. Oh, John didn't doubt for one second that they'd reach this point in the future more often than not. How could they not with Sherlock looking like he did?
"Why ever not, Sherlock?" John sounded desperate, helpless, pleading.
“Obvious. You’re male!” Scott said crisply, as if John should know.
"Yes, John. You're right."
Now? He was going to bed now? But they weren't done! Nowhere near! John, come on, you can't mean that!
John pushed him slightly, rearranged their tangled bodies so that they were sitting facing each other.
But he hadn’t realised until now that he lived through John. John was the blood running through his veins, the air he breathed. John was his life.
John couldn't help but laugh and went over to Sherlock to ruffle the thankfully almost  totally grown back curls of his beloved.
"I'll show you sappy," he murmured, reaching up, pulling Sherlock down. Sherlock's thumb brushed over John's cheek, wiping away the tear, before they melted together in a kiss—unburdened, unhurried, carrying the certainty that they had all the time in the world.
They’d die together, they would have. Better die together than Moriarty taking John away.
At those words John felt a knot in his stomach uncoil, a quiver, which he didn't really trust. He didn't want it to be hope in case Mycroft was about to reveal disappointing news. He didn't want it to be dread, because he didn't want to lose hope. Although there was one thing he was certain of. Mycroft would only come all the way to the pier, and apparently on one of his less official days judging by his attire, if it was important. The only important thing between Mycroft and him though was Sherlock.
No! He had to stop this! This was not about keeping up old patterns. This was not about their usual manner of communicating. Because that had led to nothing. It had only led them to the mess they found themselves in right now. He had to do better. He still had to do better. Why was it so hard to break old habits? Why was the relapse always the easier option? Easier perhaps, but from experience he knew that it also was—almost always—more painful. And lonely. He had lied to John. More than once of course. Constantly. But the moment he had been most vulnerable, most afraid, he had told John the biggest lie. Alone didn’t protect him, no. Rather, always when he had tried to protect himself, in the end he had always ended up alone. It was a pattern. It had become his normality. He had started to be a step ahead and make it his state of being. Only now, he wasn’t alone. John had absolutely incomprehensibly come back. John was miraculously still here. With him. Together. They’ve had enough of alone.
Sherlock didn’t look up as John caught up and settled close next to Sherlock, grimly poking with his little plastic fork at the pieces of sausage. He ate hastily, propping the sausage with sauce into his mouth, accidentally smearing some of it across his lips and onto his chin without noticing, as he witnessed Sherlock staring into his cup out of the corner of his eye. John looked down into his cup and took in the sausage, the sauce, the bread…. Well it surely wasn’t a posh meal, but it wasn’t exactly roasted intestines either. Now he thought about it, Sherlock probably wouldn’t be disgusted by that either… But the way he saw it, there was nothing to be that dumbstruck as Sherlock now obviously was staring at his food.
Sherlock marvelled once again at the man in front of him; John had understood without a single word from Sherlock. He knew Sherlock had to get his composure back, he knew that Sherlock had to steady himself as to not fall to pieces. He knew what it meant for Sherlock to take that step. Literally.
love… his mind was whirling, the mind palace in disarray… love…
John watched her and saw the same raw and tangled emotions he felt himself reflected in her eyes. There were cases, then there were difficult cases and then there was this one. Somehow this case stripped them both bare to the core. They had never experienced anything like it before. This case was far too personal, throwing them back to the fragile beginnings of their now wonderful relationship, overshadowing it with a flavour of insecurity and wariness. It opened a window into the past of his Pirate he hadn’t been part of and he didn’t know enough about. Yet. John was anxious about what he’d learn, afraid it would make him see his partner in a different light; although at the same time he loathed the thought alone that it would make any difference. He had wondered about it before, of course he had, but as it had never had any influence on their life together up to this point, he had dismissed it and put it to the back of mind.
Jenny probed carefully.
Right in front of him. So close.
He exhaled. Eyes squeezed shut.
“He was a dancer, you know?” John said, panting, still out of breath from the kiss. He didn’t know why it seemed important for Sherlock to know.
Although he was alone he was glad he had only yelled it in his mind. He wasn’t very keen on Mrs Hudson to come upstairs and look for him. He didn’t want anyone to be with him right now. He didn’t even want to be with himself in this moment.
“Just wasn’t 'It' in the end. No hard feelings though. We’ve totally been on the same page there. She said I wouldn’t be psychopathic enough for her taste…” Greg crinkled his nose, apparently still baffled. “And for me… I mean, she’s lovely but… a bit too lovely? If you get what I mean… She’s so sweet and nice and always… good.” Greg shrugged one shoulder apologetically. "I realised I need a bit more… snark in my life.” He laughed. “A bit more headwind. If you get me…”
"Oh, is that so?" Sherlock released John's neck, grinning impishly. "Well, in that case… better not waste time." he said and slid down John's body and under the covers in one smooth motion. On his way, he ran the tip of his tongue over John's skin in one straight line without lingering anywhere, waking it in rapid speed, leaving John no chance to react other than moan loudly and give himself over to the sensation. The unprocessed tickle it left in its wake, seeped through his skin, pulsing in dizzying waves of diffuse warmth through his neurons.
“Look at my
“I’ll just go up there and you come when you’re ready, yeah?”
“No, I merely implied that I need to get rid of my overly male body hair.” Sherlock carried on as if nothing had happened.
be able to leave him… out?” The clearly audible smirk in the man’s voice was appalling. John’s insides churned. The man was much too complacent.
“John,” he couldn’t quite get it out. He felt lightheaded, his voice was failing him. But John spoke before he could start to panic, as if to stop him.
Without any idea about Sherlock’s decision and with an award-worthy mess in his own head
Sherlock’s voice resonated in his skull like the whispered voices in a church. He felt pulled into a multiverse of madness. No end and no beginning, everything counts and nothing matters.
“No. No, no. It's not that!” John had hurried to reassure his friend as soon as he had realised how his reaction must have had come over. “It's… uhm...  unexpected but it looks great. Yeah, great. Really... cool actually.”
John reached over, gently freed the neglected cup of coffee out of Sherlock’s crushing hold and set it next to his cup. He slowly and deliberately took Sherlock’s other hand too, holding both, looking at Sherlock. This time Sherlock accepted the touch without hesitation, even turned his hands palms up and tightened his grip the moment John’s hand settled into his, like holding onto a lifeline. It felt good. It felt right. It felt secure. It felt like a closed circle. Perfect.
came to the conclusion that we’re better off as friends. Don’t get me wrong… in the beginning there definitely was the intention for more, but… now we got at least this out of it, right? She's a great friend!”
That moment his train of the Jubilee line arrived to take him to Westminster to the headquarters of NSY. Hustling all his belongings in that old army bag, John was able to snatch some space where he could lean against the wall. He closed his eyes and let the noises of the surrounding crowd and the monotonous rattle of the wheels working the rails wash over him.
There was something his brain didn't catch up to. He could feel it in the twist of his thoughts, in the tangle of memories. But while trying to sit up he realised that there wasn't any energy left to nurture his neurons, to spread their information and form any coherent deduction.
Turning on his belly, pushing forcefully with his arms Sherlock jumped back to his feet. He had to get all this pent-up tension, all this strain, this intensity and tightness out of his transport; this was unbearable!
“You won’t be able to shave.” Sherlock answered as if that was reason enough for John to give in.
His mind snapped back to the moment he woke up …
“You haven’t consulted me as a client and I ruled you out as a suspect right at the beginning...”
Blown away, although not literally, by the sheer amount of options John scrolled the seemingly never-ending list of phone numbers. He read about horny housewives and greedy grannies and his motivation as well as some for the intended activities crucially needed body parts were shrinking more and more the longer it took. He was about to abandon the idea all together, when he spotted a small ad squeezed into the lowest corner of the currently opened website.
Sherlock stared blankly at him.
Sherlock scanned his face for a moment then bent forward and caught John's lips in a deep kiss, taking his time in a way that felt to John as if Sherlock tried to confirm and refresh and seal their bond. Warm soft lips caressing his own, without any heat but with even more heartfelt emotions. A promise and a confession.
"I do."
"The only thing I can't remember is, how I paid them…" he couldn't avoid sounding rougher, the thought alone that he'd sunk that deep again appalled him, made him sick, "... but considering that aside from the overall soreness there were no notable bruises or injuries, visible or nonvisible, I live in hope that…"
"No," John countered, and started chuckling again at the thought.
He didn't want to take the whole box though, it was too big to put in the bag and too bulky to carry on the tube. So he put it on the couch table and opened the lid. Even knowing what was in there, he had to take a deep breath before starting to sort the content.
"Well… you're a quick learner, I'd say." John chuckled, delighted.
bisexual.” John searched Sherlock’s gaze, who had started stroking John’s shoulders with his thumbs. Sherlock leaned forward, pressed a kiss against John’s forehead. The tenderness of the gesture flooded John with warmth from head to toe, helping to melt the icy guilt that had made its home in his heart since that time. John was certain that Sherlock did deduce what was going on; he was holding John in his arms nonetheless. Apparently he didn’t care. Or didn’t mind. Or was at peace with it.
So John got to work. To give himself some time, and spare his mind some seizures, he decided to work from top to bottom.
"John. You're drunk."
“I’m really not!” John huffed. “Why would I?”
“You don’t say…,” John didn’t believe his ears. “I’m the one going out, Sherlock, doing the shopping. Touching stuff, stuff that other people touched and which is now stored in our cupboards. Which you’re touching, too… Seriously, Sherlock… how can someone like you be this stupid?!” He was really getting angry.
Her eyes widened a bit, then softened. Then she smiled almost shyly, leaned forwards and pressed her soft lips on John's. When she pulled back her smile widened into a grin and she raised her hand to wipe her thumb over his lips.
For a moment there he had thought John would kiss him. Suddenly, he had turned serious in the midst of his laughable and therefore refreshing act. A genius move to alleviate the tension and lighten the mood. His John was smarter than he looked after all.
John scanned the text and huffed amused.
*play*
Sherlock noticed a reoccuring blogger, who apparently answered questions of any kind. Not all of the asking persons seemed to be equally experts in whatever content they were sharing. Sherlock gnawed his lower lip for a while before making a decision. For obvious reasons he couldn’t use John’s account so he created one for himself, took a deep breath and clicked on the ask-section of “
“However, taking our mutual agreement into account and also the current circumstances of your call, you can’t exactly be considered a client of the other kind either. Hmmm, interesting...” Scott rattled off and John understood exactly nothing. “Nevermind, tell me about that… ‘friend’ of yours.” Scott continued and the quotes around the ‘friend’ were hanging in the air to mock John. “How is it possible you suddenly spent an evening with a… friend?” Scott asked as if they were old mates, knowing each other for a lifetime.
"Yes, John. It does." Sherlock wondered how it was possible that his voice was calm and steady again. How would John interpret that? Was that good? Not good? He stopped himself from groaning again just in time. "But then, people and their motives are
But that wasn’t it. John had the feeling that on their way down the road, he had lost a part of Sherlock. As if there were walls up that he’d never experienced before. Sherlock wouldn’t talk about it. Every time John tried to voice his concern about this topic, it ended in short clipped conversations with Sherlock assuring him everything was alright, and there was nothing to be concerned about, John should drop it, stop fussing, thank you very much!
Only after cleaning up and getting ready for the night, already lying on his bed and slowly dozing off, he startled from his slumber with a jolt. How long had they even been talking? Fumbling for his phone, he picked it up from the night table and checked the outgoing calls — Fuck. That would cost him a fortune!
"Okay?" he asked, more content and reassured now. "What's next?"
This was a calculated reaction though and John already enjoyed the anticipation of the giddy feeling when the message would sink in.
he could feel the vibrations of the trimmer pressed against Sherlock’s perineum transferred all the way to his palate. He groaned around the cock in his mouth and Sherlock bucked his hips and thrusted even deeper into John’s mouth.
*****
"What would fairies have to hide?"
about then?”
Greg blew out a breath and nodded.
Mike looked at him thoughtfully for a moment before a little smirk crossed his lips, there and gone.
John stomped into the living room, still dripping wet from the shower, only clad in a towel around his hips.
Now John realised what the contents of the travel bag had been. Of course! How could he have missed. The finishing touch to turn the stunning Queen into Miss Pirate. On top of the meticulously styled curls rested the extravagant tricorn hat John had found so ridiculous in the very beginning. There was nothing really he had found ridiculous about this Pirate not much later. The effect seemed to last, because he had to swallow against a sudden dry mouth only from studying the hat alone; opulently decorated with glittering silver braid and feather and all, playfully shoved to the back of the head. Surely allowing the curls, which looked smooth and shiny and with an even warmer tint than usual to the deep dark chocolate colour, to fall seductively over the stunning face’s brow. John could only imagine—oh, how he could imagine—as Miss Pirate was facing away from him.
Sherlock fidgeted, was restless just standing around, he needed to move, to distract himself, to evade the intensity of John's undivided attention. So he started walking again and pulled John along.
"Why?" John tried to hide his glee about the predictability of his… uhm… his… well
“Okay then,” he said, setting down his equipment. He got comfortable on the bed and laid a reassuring hand on Sherlock’s thigh. “Bend your knees and splay your legs for me.” He told Sherlock and tried to sound unaffected and professional.
"And look at him? What about that? I mean… not that I accidentally make him go up in flames..." She raised her eyebrows, as if to accentuate the deadly weapons that were her eyes.
"Well, I'm not a Christian and I dislike Christmas, therefore I'm not a sheep!"
“No, of course, you’re right… sorry.” John said silently. He turned back to his former sitting position, away from Sherlock, facing ahead, not having to look at each other. An emotional gap of the size of the Grand Canyon between them. They stayed silent for a moment, and when they broke it, they spoke at the same time.
Luckily at that moment Greg had resolved all of John's doubts by saying: “Thought one of us can take the sofa and the other the bedroom.”
“I’m not actually a mind reader, John.” Sherlock huffed.
old man!" And it sounded so tender and loving that John's heart swell with affection and he once again realised that he was devoted to this whirlwind of a man with everything he was, with heart and soul; captured without a chance to escape. Not that he wanted to; he'd gladly live his life chained to Sherlock Holmes.
He didn’t take off the sweaty shirt, because otherwise his dress shirt would be ruined for sure. Pulling on his jacket he felt sticky and dirty, but couldn’t help it at the moment.
"That's what you just suggested." Scott sounded defensive. As if
So he made use of the first moments of melody floating through the room, put on his best Fred Astaire imitation and, slowly sauntering, made his way around the table. If his hips were swaying more than necessary and the seduction-level in his gaze was Cary Grant worthy he knew he was laying it on thick, but the stunned and puzzled and a bit lost look in Sherlock's eyes was absolutely worth it.
And just the moment John thought that she might move on she stepped forward, placed her legs on each side of his own and lowered herself slowly onto his lap.
, you… arse,” John laughed, “speaking of… turn over!” He tapped Sherlock’s thigh, moving to the side to give him room to move.
The buff security guy guarding what seemed to be the back entrance of a club just nodded at Sherlock in apparent recognition and let him pass unhindered, but crossed his arms and looked down at John when he followed in obvious warning not to cause trouble. Jeez, what had he gotten himself into.
"I never said anything about 'disgusting'."
"What a ridiculous kind of reason is that?"
Just when Sherlock suspected that John's plan to add a video hadn't worked out after all, the screen suddenly came back to life and a man's voice immediately started to sing. Sherlock looked up, but of course John was gone. Some inane video clip playing. So Sherlock closed his eyes and
Wondering what Sherlock was aiming for John didn’t know better than to ask: “You okay?”
John swallowed. And swallowed again. His voice refused to cooperate. When the tightness in his throat finally eased a bit, it came out raspy.
When the mattress dipped under his weight, Sherlock’s eyes popped open and he followed John’s sturdy and controlled movements. John settled between Sherlock’s legs and draped them over his own spread thighs to keep them apart. He reached for the hem of his own shirt to take it off. Sherlock raised one inquiring eyebrow.
loveismyrevolution
"*whisper* Thank you, John. This is the best present you could give me."
"We'll go mingle with the crowd in the pub now," Sherlock whispered in his ear. "Try to make clear that I belong to you. You think you can do that?"
“Home, John?” Not fair that his voice was shaky, he didn’t want to sound doubtful or questioning. Although, he’d love to have a confirmation that it was meant the way Sherlock craved. Of course John noticed and smiled at him.
John didn't seem unaffected either, apparent in his quicker breaths and the way he licked his lips. His eyes flicked between Sherlock's eyes and mouth and it didn't need a genius to know what he was thinking about. Sherlock wondered why he wasn't going for it and just took what he wanted.
“Sorry. No, I just meant…I mean you
It's a short one!
“As he is now, yes.”
****************************
“Woah, where are you going?” Dean asked when Cas pushed away from him and sat at the war room table.
A moment passed in silence before Cas looked over to Dean. "I am not here to judge you, Dean." He tried to assure.
“You’re pretty far along too. You get that far along you start resonating with the word. Or with it’s source on a material plain…with me.” Metatron smirked, smug with the fact.
John watched curiously as Sherlock brought himself much closer. "Good." The taller man stated.
"I've had that hangover before." Dean supplied unhelpfully as Sam lifted his head to glare at him. "Jager, man." Dean shrugged.
Mycroft now stood impossibly close. Greg could feel his heart racing like a wild stallion. He licked his lips and shamelessly parted his legs to invite Mycroft even closer yet. To his surprise, the other man took it. Mycroft stood flush with the desk, lightly pressed into the other man and he placed his hands on either side of him. Greg almost forgot to breathe. Just a minuscule shift forward would have their lips connected.
"Good. Anthea! Please escort our guest, here, to his location of choosing."
John startled briefly. His posture tensed and he brought an elbow off of the bar to turn towards his friend. "Of course I trust you."
“MOTHERFUCKER!!!” The monster screamed at the men of letters. His fangs extended and he tried admirably to surge forward out of his restraints, but to no avail. Another string of profanities spewed from his mouth. “I’m going to kill you! I’m going to rip your throats out!”
***********************************
"No." Greg said defiantly.
Mycroft was standing with one foot crossed over the other ankle, leaning into his umbrella for balance. A bright overhead light lit him nicely from above in the abandoned warehouse. It was all quite theatric, which Mycroft throughly enjoyed. A genuinely pleased smile presented itself before he opened his mouth to speak.
They stood in thoughtful silence for a few moments before Dean asked, "What now? Can you take a trip to hell and make a...I don't know, knife, or sword, or something?"
Dean flashed a fake smile that immediately fell. "No." He deadpanned. Then he waved a flat hand in front of him as he followed it up with, "Not even
Castiel ventured closer still. It made Dean uneasy. "Good things do happen, Dean." He assured, stopping only when he was within inches of the man.
His heart throbbed in his ears as it beat erratically. He turned slowly, hoping not to scare off what must be a hallucination. His eyes scanned the figure from head to toe.
Dean pulled back slightly from Cas to answer his brother. "I'm fine Sam. Just need a minute to myself." His hands swept up higher to wrap behind Cas' neck.
John smirked into the crook of the other man's neck and then moved to straddle him.
“Well, I’m never bored.”
The vampire’s eyes flickered from the weapon, now at Mycroft’s side, to his face. He noticed the muscles in the tall man’s forearm flex as he gripped the handle tighter. Saw the calm yet malevolent intent behind his eyes. This man was dangerous, the vamp decided. Darker than he first assessed. Mycroft stepped closer and raised to strike. The vampire’s whole body tensed, his head snapped to the side, and he squeezed his eyes shut. “Wait! Wait!” He shouted, voice laced with fear and anger.
The innuendo was lost on the detective. That is, until John dipped his head down to kiss along Sherlock's jaw and then ever so gently on his still tender throat.
"I'm a married man." Greg contended when Mycroft's hands moved up to unbutton his crisp white dress shirt. "Doesn't that bother you?" Mycroft's deft fingers made quick work of the buttons and soon the shirt hung open. "No." He answered clearly as he pulled the fiber barrier off. It fell to floor, leaving bare skin in it's absence.
“Give him a minute.” Metatron said solemnly, before retreating to his kitchen.
"It's worth a shot." Dean nodded, a small smile forming on his face at Cas' sudden perkiness. "Let's go find him." The Winchester made to go off to gather his things, but Cas stopped him with a hand to his chest. "No. You stay here and locate the dragon skull. I'll go to hell and search for Hephaestas."
“You already broke both of my knees, you bastard.”
"Cas. I'm more than capable of handling myself in hell." He defended. His pride a little sore.
Dean inhaled slowly as Cas continued, "But, in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I...don't envy the weight that's on your shoulders, Dean." The pity in Cas' eyes churned Dean's insides. "I truly don't."
After a while he asked, “Are you on the pull tonight?”
“Oh, you’re resonating, aren’t you?” Metatron asked Sam.
“To cure a demon.” Metatron stated matter-of-factly.
“What?” Metratron questioned.
Cas raised his eyebrows and drew his lips tight as he read the list of ingredients. “The spell itself isn’t too complicated. However, some of the ingredients may be a bit hard to procure. Particularly: A weapon forged in hell fire, the skull of a dragon, and a vial of blood that’s descended from an extraterrestrial being.”
"You look like shit." Lestrade stated plainly as the consulting detective approached.
The soldier had really turned his world upside down.
“No! Really?” Greg gasped in an amused horror.
"I have a tip off from the homeless network that someone I've been after for a while has resurfaced, guy by the name of Gerard James. He's supposed to be at a nightclub called 'The Black Crow' tonight."
“Not the words we were looking for. And you are not a
The vamp’s eyes flashed with anger, which caused Greg to smirk in response. Mycroft took less than a second to read into his counterpart’s interrogation technique. He sighed dramatically as his hands roamed over the supply of torture devices at his disposal. “I suppose you are correct, Gregory. He’s not likely to know anything at all. Perhaps it would be prudent to just kill him quickly and move onto the next vampire.”
Mycroft didn't bother trying to conceal the frustrated groan that emanated from him upon this revelation. "He chased them off, then." He supplied, from simple deductions of his little brother's boringly predictable habits. Mycroft ran a hand over his facial features before posing a follow-up question. "Did he manage to capture or kill any of them at least?"
This was impossible, Dean thought. And yet, here he was. His angel, solid and sturdy against him. Tasting of earth and lightning. So raw and so powerful. How could he possibly hold back any longer?
“Elaborate.”
Greg released a harsh dry laugh. They were obviously making fun of him. "Yeah, alright. 'Let's make fun of the dim witted cop.' See how stupid he really is. Hilarious."
Mycroft blushed slightly under the D.I.'s gaze. He paused for a moment to fully read the man in front of him; The way he held himself, leaning in towards him slightly. The smile radiating confidence, but there was also the way he grasped one hand loosely in the other across his body, as though still guarded. The smile didn't completely reach his eyes: Nervousness. Speaking of his eyes, they were a beautiful shade of dark brown. Bagged underneath from sleepless nights, at the office, no doubt. He must spend most nights there, what with the state of his suit. Being a detective inspector doesn't pay as well as one might think.
Dean slowly nodded and he reached a hand up to cup his angel's face and leaned in to kiss him gently.
“I saw it on the telly. You okay?” John asked, perplexed by the calm of the two brothers.
Then an idea came to him. He signaled Sherlock to stay where he was and then quickly darted over to the other side of the door frame. Next he bent down to retrieve a small knife he kept strapped to his ankle, and then threw it down the hall. It clanked and clattered.
Cas drew in a long breath and glanced back at the playground. "Our orders-" The angel began. "-Yeah, I've had about enough of these orders of yours-." Dean interrupted, but Cas cut back in. "Our orders," He said louder this time, "Were not to stop the summoning of Sam Hane. They were to do whatever you told us to do."
A week later, Greg had filed for a separation. He just couldn't bring himself to file for a divorce. Sure, his wife had drug him through the mud, but Greg wasn't exactly innocent himself. So after a serious discussion with her about taking time away to mend what was broken, he moved into a small flat closer to the Yard.
“Yeah?” The detective questioned as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He knew full well what Sherlock used those for.
"No. I want this. I want you, John." He replied with enough certainty in his voice to warrant another hot kiss from his doctor.
"I'm sorry John." He tried to say. But his throat was hoarse and he chocked on the words.
"Thank you Gregory. How kind of you to say." Mycroft found himself being pulled steadily toward the other man, like a magnetic force. Another man of power, but wrapped in a nonchalant and charismatic shell. How unorthodox. And lovely.
The taller man trailed his fingers slowly up over Gregory's well defined torso. His fingertips teased lightly over a nipple, and he rolled his hips forward.
"Hello Dean." All of Dean's doubt left him when he heard the deep rich baritone. "C-Cas?" The hunter's voice broke along with the dam keeping his tears held back. He lifted a hand to the angel's face, needing to touch. To know that he was real. His hand cupped Cas' bearded jaw and it was solid. Dean's other hand came up to clasp a shoulder.
A few minutes passed by in companionable silence while the two men sipped on their beers.
The doctor smiled to himself and rounded a corner before typing out a reply.
His friend smiled shyly and shook his head. "That would definitely draw attention."
“Ah, fuck.” He cursed before turning to lay the machete on the table with a clank. “Shirt’s ruined. Ah well, I’m sure the rest of my clothes will be too before we’re done. We have seven more vampires to interrogate.”
"Dammit, Cas! Come on!" Dean barked as he stumbled up the incline to the portal.
***************************************
Dean roughly swallowed down the panic that intruded his mind along with the horrible memories of hell. The heavy gaze of the angel made him steel himself, however. He would not break in his presence. But then, the angel really managed to surprise him. "Can I tell you something, if you promise not to tell another soul?" Cas' voice was softer now. Unsure.
“Really? I didn’t.” The hunter responded truthfully.
Mycroft swiftly returned the phone to it's receiver and then stared at it with scrutiny for a few moments, before turning to his assistant. "Anthea, I need you to do a pick up and then meet me at the old warehouse in precisely ninety minutes." He ordered.
The receptionist sat there staring dumbfounded at the detective with her jaw slack. It caused his anger to surge. He hammered his fist down onto the desk top and she jumped about a foot in response. "...she...she doesn't work on Wednesdays, Mr. Lestrade." The woman finally stammered.
"You know, you may be the dumbest smart person that I know!" He exclaimed as he stormed over to Sherlock.
How was Cas such an oxymoron? And how was Dean supposed to build (let alone keep) walls up around him, when he contradicted everything he thought angels were? Maybe Cas wasn't a total dick, like the rest of his command. Maybe.
Well, fuck.
Shit. Outnumbered. Not by much, but when the enemy had supernatural strength and agility, it up’ed the chances for injury.
“Cas...” Dean rested his forehead against Cas' and took a moment to gather his breath and his thoughts. He wanted to apologize. He wanted to make his angel understand what he was feeling. But Dean was never any good with words and it sometimes left things awkward between them. Cas already had so little to go on.
"Come again?" Dean asked with the raise of an eyebrow.
Sherlock smirked at that. Proud of the increase in deduction skills he'd seen in John in such a short time.
Vampires?...
“Okay. What
He could hear the sound of feet running across pavement.
His breath quickened as he watched Sherlock's face start to turn purple.
John looked down at his sleeping friend and smirked. “Greg. You’re on my shoulder you bastard.” He said a little louder.
Greg's anger had built substantially on the drive over from Mycroft's flat, causing him to come in hot. The office doors ended up swinging wildly behind him, his over coat flapping behind him in the same frantic fashion. The receptionist startled almost comically.
Their cab pulled up to the curb of the night club and stopped to let them out.
His fingers moved a bit stiffly from the cold and John wished he'd had bundled up a bit better.
The day started out like any other.
Sam searches for a demon cure while Dean and Cas search for two of the three heroes spell ingredients.
“What is it?” Sam asked.
"These people." The angel stated, leaning forward as Dean had done, and placing his elbows on his knees in the same gesture. "They're all my Father's creations. They're works of art."
“So, you’ve been holed up here, or, or in a cave, listening to stories or reading books?”
“Eight vamps and not one of them knew why their Alpha sent them here.” Greg recapped as he aggressively wiped the blood off of his latest blade. The last vampire sat headless in the steel chair. Mycroft eyed the D.I. as he rolled his tense shoulders.
"Are you aware how often you repeat others?"
“Are you insinuating that I should remove my clothing as well?”
“Yeah.” Kevin confirmed. “Who are you?”
Shock, excitement, fear, confusion, embarrassment.
Fire pulsed through Greg's veins as Mycroft's hands gripped his hips firmly. His tongue traced and his teeth scrapped at the skin where neck met shoulder. Greg closed his eyes, sighed, and tilted his head to allow Mycroft better access.
"I thought we were on a case?" John said.
“He gave you something, then? Coordinates? A spell? A name?” Cas probed.
“Vampire.” Mycroft answered. “We’ve been having a bit of a problem with those nasty creatures as of late.”
“I believe you.” Mycroft stated flatly, then nodded to his work partner.
“I don’t know.” The vamp answered. Mycroft grabbed his arm and yanked it forward, splaying his hand across the tabletop.
“If you’d let me finish…” The angel snapped back. Dean glared at him through the rearview mirror. “I was saying, a mortal can complete the trials but they would die from it. A hero, however, would be a much better choice, because the weight of the trials wouldn’t crush them.” It was silent for a few seconds while Cas let them absorb the news. “The spell Metatron gave you, it’s a Heroes Spell. It would give Sam the ability to take on the last trial without succumbing to the raw holy power of it.”
John's hips faltered and he sunk his teeth into the other man's collar while he stroked a hand over Sherlock's still clothed erection. Causing him to come with a shout.
"DON'T MOVE! I WON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT!"
Sam and Dean exchanged a look.
**********************************************
“Good strategy.” Sherlock intoned after.
“Hmm.” The hunter grunted noncommittally. He watched Metatron and wondered what he was writing.
In fact, he barely managed to make it to the cell before the world around him was consumed by blackness. Before it completely overtook him, an intangible feeling of respect for Detective Inspector Lestrade registered in Sherlock's mind, then a feeling of warmth, and then there was nothing.
He found it to be empty, so he sat in his armchair and picked up the paper to rifle through.
“I suppose it’s really none of our business.” Mycroft snipped.
Sherlock didn't argue. He simply followed where Lestrade lead him. Honestly, he was just thankful for a safe place to crash. The downfall was imminent. He felt it coming on, like a train barreling towards a cliff's edge at high speeds.
“Oh.” Cas voiced thoughtfully. “Of course.”
"Mornin' Sunshine." Dean replied, heading towards the angel. "Sam's tryna find something on how to 'cure a demon.' Men of Letters ought to have something helpful hidden away in here." He clasped Cas on the shoulder and smiled at him fondly.
"Yeah, exactly. God, you're such a nerd." Dean teased as he sat on the arm of the nearest chair.
********************************
“Sure. Want some help? I could at least put the kettle on.” John offered.
The confrontation after Sherlock heals.
"Ah, yes." He replied curtly before answering.
"Should I even ask how they know you?" John inquired on their way to the bar. "Did you ensure a death or save a life?" He laughed, but quickly dismissed it. "No. Never mind. I don't actually want to know."
“He’s dead now.” Sam interjected angrily. “Because of you.”
“Alright, it’s settled then.” Mycroft declared, “John, do have a seat please.”
Metatron nodded, his smug smile firmly planted.
Cas' beard scraped against his own stubble as they kissed, reminding Dean of the masculinity that should scare him away. It had for a long time, but it just didn't seem important anymore. He loved the angel, and he wouldn't change a single thing about him.
"He's a devout man. He actually prayed for this." Castiel affirmed with a small smile.
Standing in the cold silence, his heart continued to sink as thoughts of what-if plagued his mind. It wasn't fair to blame himself. Even Dean knew that. He did everything in his power to get Cas out. That's what hurt the most, though. That he did everything in his power, and yet he still failed to save him.
He had honestly tried to hold back but hearing Scott, obscenely needy, shamelessly begging, reduced to a wrecked mess, pulled John over the edge without warning and he came with a curse and a long stretched moan. His come splattered against the palm of his hand still imitating Scott's mouth and the thought that he would have come all over the man's shameless tongue just now sparked off another bout of shudders, pulling another wave of release from his tightening balls and a raspy shout from his throat.
“Because you

John got the message and didn't interrupt. If Sherlock knew he was here, he'd pay him attention eventually. Sherlock was the one who had given John the sign, had made the decision to meet; so Sherlock would turn towards him when he was ready. John was sure about it.
"Not my fault either."
"Then you haven't listened closely. The female operator would have been on line one."
Apparently, he had been lost in  memories after all, because he hadn’t noticed Sherlock approaching him.

To free himself from that goddamn guilt that told him that it was all his fault, even if only for some blissful minutes,

“What is?” John asked, confused and admittedly somewhat distracted.
