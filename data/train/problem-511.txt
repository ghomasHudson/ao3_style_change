“Please.”
Greg knew who that was directed at. “Yeah, yeah,” he said, brushing candy out of the folds in his clothes and shoving it back towards the pile with his foot. “Means we’re all even, yeah?!” he asked back.
Bruce sighed…contrary to the wildly popular beliefs of his children, he didn’t always want to be ‘mean Da’da’. He didn’t like counting to three anymore than they did. “We’re going,” he said, standing back up. He stepped around behind Dick and before the little guy could scurry away, scooped him up under the arms and lifted him onto his hip.
Greg watched as Mycroft leaned in and listened to Sherlock intently, nodding along and clucking his tongue every so often. “My, my...no, of course, I think it’s very fitting, not harsh at all...getting off easy if you ask me...but you’re sure? Terribly sure?...Mm-hmm, I see. Very well.” Mycroft sat up, and both Holmes brothers squared their attention directly on Greg. Mycroft was smiling...smirking, actually...and Sherlock, even with his ruddy, tear-stained cheeks, looked very satisfied.
"Struggling lil jawn being comforted after a really rough week leaves him aching and limping even in headspace? For day 8"
“Yup, all done. You want Big Bird or Elmo?” Stephen asked, already opening the box of Sesame Street bandages that he knew Tony would pick.
“Yes, ‘oh’.”
“What, you’re not gonna tell me it’s ‘too much’?” Greg asked, sounding incredulous.
The first crack of the paddle against his backside had him jutting forward as all the breath left his lungs.
“You can help by doing as I said, and clean up the sitting room. There’s candy everywhere, and I’m fairly sure that Jawn flung an open bag of gummy worms when the lights went out.” Mycroft turned and started to leave the room, meaning the conversation was done and that was that...for now.
“I’ve watched you do the potty squirm for the past ten minutes.”
“My’coff???”
“Of course I’m gonna tell them--!”
“I’m hurryin’ as fast as I can, Mr. ‘I-have-fourteen-dozen-bloody-locks-and-a-retinal-scanner’–”
Mycroft feigned surprise; “No?” he asked, an eyebrow going up in shock. “You don’t think so? A lesser sentence, then…yes, yes, I suppose you’re right; it was an accident, after all. Such a magnanimous little thing you are!”
"Lil sweater made me think of the Weasley Christmas Sweaters soooo 👀 Smol Harry visiting for the holidays?"
“Bu’d Tony ha’sh a beard.”
“It’s the one thing you can count on in life,” Thor said, sounding neither pleased or disappointed by the fact, but just…accepting. “But, in the meantime,” he added with a sly smile as he wiped away Steve’s tears with his thumb; “we have a battle of our own against the Brothers of Smash?!”
“Good job!”
, he didn’t have to go potty, Stee'b. Not when Blue was back on and Josh was asking for help!
…And Drungus Umongus was such a silly name! That always made him laugh, too!
“Yeah.” Jawn sniffed and rubbed his nose with the back of his hand.. “Know’ed i’d was him a’whole time.” As far as anyone else was concerned, at least. No cheap rubber pound-store mask could scare him.
John hooked his fingers behind his head and stretched as he looked over the rest of the kitchen, which was an absolute disaster…even the shopping from earlier still sat in its bags on the counter, as he and Sherlock had barely made it back into the flat before all hell had broken loose.
Jawn had crawled onto the couch next to Mycroft and was tucked at his side, munching away on something from his pile of treats with Mycroft’s arm around his waist. Sherlock was still on the floor, sprawled on his belly with his chin in his hands and watching the movie with wide-eyed glee. His little dress had ridden up over his backside, and even under his tights Greg could see that Myc had been right...that nappy was in desperate need of a change.
John was still just as confused; “I…didn’t say anything? At all?” He looked around the flat to see if there might have been literally anyone else that he could have possibly been talking to…seeing as how a lot of their friends (and most enemies) had a habit of walking in unannounced.
Sherlock quickly picked her up and held her to his chest. “What happened, darling?!” he asked, still looking her over.
…They still had no idea where he’d holed up in all that time. Not even a spanking for running from Greg and scaring all of them for hours had loosened those stubborn lips.
Mycroft chalked the attitude up to a combination of being wet and more tired than he’d ever admit, even with the extra sugar piled on. “Here, why don’t you come sit with big brother and Jawn?” he asked, patting the cushion beside him. “You can bring some of your sweeties with you.”
“He hates me,” Bilbo sniffed.
“F’ank yoouuuuu for B’yuuuue!” Bucky said as he plopped himself down on the potty seat.
“I don’t know what’s on your mind, “John said quickly, anxious to finally get some things off his chest, “but I just want to say...if I overstepped a line last night with… you know tending to you...I sincerely apologize. I didn’t mean to pressure you or harass you in any way. I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”
Ben seemed to think for a moment, then he shrugged and shouted: “Yes, well, there’s been a bloke who matches your description. He left.”
But he couldn’t, his mind just wouldn’t function and how could that be, he knew he was maybe a little drunk but not that bad. Or maybe he had overestimated himself a little, underestimated the effect six weeks without much sleep and hardly anything to eat would have on his body and maybe that’s why he was getting more drunk even quicker than usual. Yes, yes, that had to be it. How stupid of him.
Something cold entered Sherlock’s heart, making him freeze in his motions. He stared at John, wanting desperately to say something back but he couldn’t. So he just stood there, gaping, watching as John looked at him with this frustratingly sad expression. Then he shook his head and left, only to stop and turn around once again after a few steps.
When Sherlock still didn’t react, John reached out and carefully placed his hand over Sherlock’s. The detective looked up at him in surprise.
But Sherlock had hung up by then.
“Wait. Did you say it was Scottish? I thought your parents were from somewhere around Leeds?”
“I’ll get us some coffee from the cafeteria, alright?” Mike said as he grabbed his bag and made for the door. “Be quick about your shower, class starts in twenty minutes. I’ll wait for you outside.”
His friend needed his comforting touch, but he needed it, too. He needed to feel Sherlock next to him so that he knew that he was safe right now, that he was okay. Nobody wasn’t there to hurt him anymore and John was there to protect him from nightmares or anything else disturbing his sleep. He would stay with him for as long as he slept and he wouldn’t let him out of his sight for just one minute, he vowed to himself.
John was amazed to see this new side of Sherlock. It was terrifying, in a way.
But she brought him coffee or tea without him even needing to ask for it and she occasionally let him take a look at one of the corpses in the lab where she worked as an assistant to one of her professors, accumulating work experience for the set goal she had chosen for herself, which was to become a forensic pathologist. He wouldn’t go so far as to call the two of them friends, but they were as close as to such a thing as it could get and they were the only ones who he occasionally ate lunch or shared a cup of coffee with. He indulged them from time to time when they asked if he wanted to go the cafeteria after a seminar and although he usually ended up being bored to death by Molly’s pointless blabbering about her Alpha mate or Greg’s tedious account of his last rugby game it was a good way of interacting with his peers, allowing him to keep up with the latest news and stories - not that he was particularly interested in those things. Still, it was a necessity he didn’t dare to neglect.
“What did Ron get you, darling?”
The plastic bin with the nappy supplies had been taken out from under the bed, most of which had been pulled out and tossed aside haphazardly…except, for the wipes.
Loki pinched the bridge of his nose. “…You have a nice cup of milk–that you asked for, remember–sitting right here,” he said, picking up the small sippy-cup the waitress had brought, along with the rest of their drinks.
Which means that the dummy/bum pat combo had an expiration date, and it was all too soon that Sherlock had it figured out and began refusing his dummy (or any cuddles, at that!) whenever he became suspicious that they were trying to get him to nap.
“N-nine.”
worse than a fully-loaded diaper ever did, but seeing little hints of Buck’s chubby cheeks peeking out of the bottoms was pretty damn cute…plus, he may or may not have forgotten to order more diapers, and may or may not have used the last one on Bucky last night.
So, without further ado, we have the very last prompt for Diapcember, 2020!
“My’coff?”
“…From jail,” Greg sighed.
“Ugh, anything will be better than the room I’m staying in.”
Sherlock smiled as he strolled over to his brother. He stopped behind him and placed his hands on his shoulders while bending down. “Fancy seeing you in a place like this,” he whispered in his ear.
“Oh, no it won’t.”
Sherlock jumped around and glared at him. “Don’t patronize me, Mycroft. Why didn’t you mention her before?”
His eyes enlarged again. “You know Mycroft?”
Thanks for reading and leaving kudos ♥
“So, technically you’re still married?”
One day after class, he called Sherlock aside. He waited until all the students left before he asked. “Do you have another class now?”
“No you don’t. If you did, you wouldn’t leave me alone not telling me where you’re going.”
“What’s going on in there?” Sherlock put the packet of biscuits down and stood up. He gasped aloud when he noticed the water on the floor. “Are you trying to flood the kitchen?”
John kept his promise and waited patiently. Their relationship consisted of cuddles and kisses alone. It suited Sherlock. He didn’t want to take another risk in having sex and relived that moment when his professor brutally raped him.
Sherlock paced up and down the flat, smoking the one cigarette after the other while waiting for Greg to call back.
Mycroft flew in from London, on his mother’s demand, to talk sense into his brother’s head.
“No thanks.”
Only his lips moved as he begged once again for mercy.
Sherlock’s mouth came down on his lips, forcing them apart, exploring the inside of his mouth with his tongue. He grasped his butt again and drew John’s crotch up against his.
“Are you okay, John,” Sherlock called out from the living room.
“Shh, just enjoy it,” Simon whispered while panting. “Pull up your legs.”
“Tell him what you told me,” Simon said, glancing at her.
The professor reached for the textbook and shut it.
Sherlock gazed at him and smiled. “You, John Watson, keep me right.” He kissed him on the cheek and stood up.
“You need a bigger place, little brother.”
His mother barged into his room. “What did I tell you about slamming doors in this house? You better start packing. We’re moving the end of the month.”
Sherlock jumped up. “Did your boyfriend called you up to ask permission before he gives me her phone number?”
“No, I’ve invited him for dinner so that he can see for himself.”
Mycroft tapped his umbrella against the window separating the driver from them.
Andrew charged forward and caught up with him before he could enter the room. He grabbed him by the arm and flung him to the floor.
He shrugged while shaking his head.
“And you said I don’t have to buy you anything.”
“Why would I make a case? To whom are you referring?”
They shook hands before taking a course in different directions.
“Your first day in my class and you’re already daydreaming.”
The truck driver hooted when she drove past him. He put the truck in gear and drove off, following them.
Since he took up violin lessons two months ago, he practiced every day. He was a quick learner and could play a piece of music after a month.
“The minute I saw you there on the roof, I knew you were gay.”
He ignored her and fixed his eyes on Lestrade.
As soon as he took a seat on the couch, a text message came through. He glanced at the screen and smiled, reading the message.
Sherlock gazed at the full lips as it moved while he spoke. He took a deep breath, leaned over and kissed him.
She smiled faintly at him. “I have a John Doe in the morgue. You said I have to call you as soon –”
John nodded and started climbing the two flights of stairs until he found the door and pushed it open. He glanced at the slender tall man dressed in a dark suit, with a cigarette between his fingers. His black curly hair ruffled from the wind. He paced closer. “Those things will kill you,” he said and raised a brow when the man didn’t even twitch a finger.
The two of them trotted up the stairs.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “Thank you for the tea and biscuits, Missis Hudson. Close the door on your way out.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking and when I want to escape from the world. I hope it won’t bother you.”
“Sorry, I’m not going with you. The stairs will kill me. Just take them up and go through the door. You’ll find him there smoking.”
They moaned with pleasure and found it difficult to keep their voices down.
After a month, he recovered of visible scars. The invisible ones remained, and that worried his family.
He brought them each a cup and returned to the kitchen for his.
“Tomorrow.”
She flung around, hurried out of the flat and trotted down the stairs.
John stood on his knees wiping the floor. “No, when I turned my back for a second the sink overflowed.” If he only knew, he was thinking of him and his sweet lips. “Bloody hell,” he yelled.
He took the glass from him, sipped on the wine and shrugged. “I don’t know.”
Mycroft chuckled. “Sorry, kiddies lock. It opens only from the outside.”
Sherlock tried not to burst out with laughter. He kept his pose but the shaking of his body gave him away.
He kept on walking, ignoring him.
He chuckled when he took two fifty pound notes out of his wallet. Before he could hand the money over, a voice spoke in the dark behind them.
He threw his arms around John and gazed in his eyes. “Make love to me, John.”
He shut the lab door and turned around. “Let me show you to the roof.”
Linda shrugged. “I guess so.”
Linda held a cell phone up. “Maybe the number will be on here.”
He smiled at him before he turned back to Sherlock to inform him about the case. “Come down to the station. I’ll give you the case file to go through. Perhaps take you to the crime scene.”
Sherlock kissed him on the cheek, grabbed the packet and trotted back to the living room.
John stepped closer and sat down on the bed. He rubbed his arm and tried to hush him. When that didn’t work, John pulled his feet up on the bed and moved closer. He put Sherlock’s head on his lap, brushed his fingers through his curly hair and over his forehead.
He drummed his fingers on the trolley while watching the nurses making his bed. “Why am I back here, I’m not crazy?”
The paramedics barge within minutes through the door. They connected him on a heart monitor, put him on the stretcher and wheeled him out. The lift was too small for the stretcher with a patient on it to fit. They had to carry him with it down the stairs.
Mycroft snorted. “My brother discovered his natural endowment. More of a nuisance, I would say.”
“Are we doing anything today?”
“Simon, I’m not the person you think I am. Leave now, while you still like me.”
The first signs were showing when Sherlock refused to go back to university.
He stood up and took one of the towels. “I’m soaking wet.”
“Oh you can try, they will laugh at you.” He fiddled with his umbrella’s handle. “I want you to keep an eye on Sherlock for me. I worry about him, constantly.”
Sherlock sat with the newspaper in front of his face, reading. Every now and again, he picked up the cup of coffee, took a sip and put it back on the table without looking away from the paper. “John?” He lowered the left side of the newspaper and glanced at him. “John, wake up. What are you doing at night, definitely not sleeping?
He felt another twinge and pressed his thighs together. Okay, now he was going to…oh, what? More Blue was comin’ on?! And it was an episode with Stee'b?!?
“If that’s what you want.”
worth it.
Sherlock looked back down and carefully cracked the box open…and gasped.
“I can’nah
“Alright, ALRIGHT, you’ve made your point, brother,” Loki sighed, and leaneed over to gather Natasha from the floor. “Here…no, come here, dumpling, come to Mama.”
get into it. “You’re lucky I have to go get that,” he warned, pointing at Mycroft. “Curmudgeonly little snot.”
pouting. “I know, I don’t like it either, baby,” he said, stripping him of his heavily-soaked diaper and wiping him clean. “But hey, you know what we could do later?”
,’ Greg thought...before emitting a blood-curdling scream as a hand burst through in a shower of candy and grabbed his shirt, balling it into a fist.
Sherlock wrapped his arms over Gregs’ shoulders, and nuzzled into the crook of his neck. “Y’ub’oo.”
“Good; then I won’t waste anymore time. Bend over, hands on your knees.“
He’d walk around all melancholy and droopy, liked a kicked dog, until Bucky would seek him out and toddle up to him for a hug or to be picked up, and the way that he would look at Steve would snap him out of it and realize that he was being a dumbass and that he need to pick his baby before there was a super-soldier-sized fit of fuck-off-sized proportions took place.
Severus raised his eyebrow at him, and then quietly muttered and enchantment that froze the springs in his mattress in place.
Why had he asked for this, again?!?
“…El’bow,” Tony grinned.
,” he said…no
“Then let me do it myself!” Bilbo whinged. “I can handle it!”
“But none of the others had a fever befall them.”
Molly slowly turned her head and blinked up at him, still in her unicorn-clouded haze, and whimpered as she clung to her toys’ neck.
, either…not while he was Big, anyway).
Sherlock smiled to himself, and waited until Jawn had disappeared into the bathroom before carrying his armload of laundry to the wash.
” Sherlock squawked in protest, even as he let Greg scoot him off his lap and onto the floor. “
“So why don’t you–!?”
He tilted his head back and there, out in the hallway, were Mycroft and Sherlock sat at the top of the stairs. Mycroft was holding his belly, eyes squinched shut and covering his mouth to stifle the donkey braying that he calls a laugh. And Sherlock was just as bad, sitting on the step next to his brother, rocking back and forth in an effort not to piss himself (anymore) and shaking just as hard as he had earlier, but this time it was at Greg’s expense, not his.
Greg closed his eyes and buried his face in Sherlocks’ curls. He’d been waiting for that.
’ing sound his middle finger made against Sherlocks’ face as it hit dead center on his left nostril and skidded across his right cheek and making him jerk his head back, eyes wide with shock while Greg could only watch on in horror, fully realizing that that was way,
Sherlock twisted in his booster, and reached for him. “Da’yee, my?” he asked, his fingers grasping at air. “My? My, p’ea’sh? My??”
Bruce sat up, frowning. “This was ‘intercom’ worthy, and not ‘come downstairs’ worthy?”
It was adorable, and the pink was just the right shade to accentuate the natural blush of Sherlock’s cheeks and lips just like a little doll (which John was fairly certain is why Mycroft selected it).
Sherlock grinned like the cat who’d found the cream, and giggled. “...G’eeeegg,” he said, clasping his hands under his chin.
It looked like Da’...well, from what he could see (which wasn’t much), and it sure felt like Da’ that he was holding on to, but...but no, the smell was all wrong. Fancier than what his Daddy smelled like. And that was very much Not his voice.
“Ohhh...oh, oh nooo,” Mycroft tutted as he gently bounced Jawn in his arms. “Poor dove; I know who you thought I was.” He carried Jawn to the end of the bed, where the railing ended, and sat down with the tiny one straddling his lap. “It’s alright,” he said, patting Jawn’s back as he rocked them; “He’ll be back sooner than you think, darling.”
Bucky frowned at the very thought. “…O’gay,” he sighed, and held his arms up for Steve to lift him onto the table.
Then, he took one look at Sherlock, who was becoming more concerned by the second…and dissolved. That was it, that was all it took, a single question, a simple glance, and now all he could do was cry like a baby.
“Oh yeah?” Steve chuckled, and pulled back Bucky’s ‘Blue’s Clues’ blanket; normally when Bucky took a nap, it was on top of the sheets and comforter while he only slept under one of his baby blankets. Mainly to keep that distinction between naptime and bedtime. “Did you have good dreams…oh,” Steve paused. “Well, looks like you did, buddy.”
And, as if that weren’t enough salt to rub into the wound, Jawn decided at that moment to let out a cheer as he used his last move to switch the winning piece of candy into place, setting off the cheery music to a waterfall of happy sound effects that made the look of utter betrayal splayed upon the detectives’ face all the more perfect!
It started out pretty smooth. Bucky’d had a good morning, and had let Steve get him through their morning routine of waking up, getting his diaper changed, then getting dressed and making breakfast…hell, Bucky had been in a good enough mood that he wanted to help with the cooking. And Steve, being the soft touch that he is (when it comes to babies, always), let him whip up the scrambled eggs. It had gone really well, actually.
John looked at the small box in his hand…it was the apple cider mix that Sherlock had begged for in the shop. Because it was his favorite, and they only had it out for a limited time during the year.
Mycroft could hear the underlying current of fear in his baby brothers’ voice...God, how could he not?! Both of the little ones were trembling like leaves.
John no longer looked like he wanted to commit felony homicide, but he still wasn’t exactly thrilled. Greg couldn’t blame him, and he supposed that it helped that the Little one was no longer crying, either….in fact, he looked quite content there (in spite of the tear tracks down his cheeks), perched on his Daddy’s hip while he got his bum patted and rocked. And Mycroft…
“Bum up! Who else??”
Bilbo sniffed, and rubbed his cheek along Thorin’s coat. He wanted to go home. Or at the very least, go to sleep right away and hope they all packed up and left him in the morning.
for her!!), the crib…without fail, she’d find a way to finagle herself out of it.
She looked up then and, instead of looking appropriately chastened in her usual way (the elder Holmes hardly ever scolded her, so when he did it was usually enough to break her heart), she started giggling so hard that she snorted.
“Y'us!”
It was then that Bilbo felt a soft, tender pat to his leg, and turned to look–
“-John Hamish, you interrupt me one more time and you’ll
Greg frowned. “Happy-feckin’-Halloween to my arsehole,” he huffed, and headed for the broom closet.
Grass it was, then. Steve scanned the scant few yards of grass before the parking lot began, his gaze skimming over the brown patches and the picnic tables drowning in knee-high weeds, and–
And none too soon! Not even a full five seconds later, Ron burst into the kitchen, red-faced and out of breath. “Where,” he heaved as he staggered against the door frame; “did he go?!”
.So she was still getting out some other way.
“Don’t you have calls to get back to?!?”
“You didn’t yell at Greg for saying it!”
“Sh'illy,” Sherlock agreed. He leaned back and said his head on John’s shoulder, and reached for his phone.
Eventually, while John was telling Sherlock about Harry’s upcoming birthday and how he dreaded having to call her, Sherlock fell asleep. Just like that, mid-sentence. His eyes closed and his head lolled to the side, a couple of loose curls falling into his face as his breathing slowed down in peaceful slumber.
The nurse bit her lip and blushed as she gathered all her courage and spoke. “Oh, no, Mr. Holmes. We have another tray for Mr. Watson, as the accompanying person to you, he has the same right to breakfast as the patients. I’ll fetch it right away.”
is the song that John sings to Sherlock. I've searched for suitable Scottish lullabies (sung by male singers) for quite some time, which was surprisingly difficult. This one kind of stuck out to me, even though it's not technically a lullaby (like John says).
He felt refreshed, instead of exhausted. There was still the kind of daze that lingered around after a couple of days of fever and illness. But the promise of recovery was right there and his brain and body jumped at the chance of a return to normalcy. He needed this.
It all seemed very unfair to John and he wished he could get a hold of an Omega, talk with them, ask their opinion on being treated like this. Did they hate being diminished to bearing children, taking care of the house, rarely allowed outside to enter other possible careers? Or was it okay for them, because it was in their nature to do those things and not the other ones?
“I better let him in, “he muttered and left the bedroom.
It was exciting. Knowing he could sleep with anyone he liked, any one of those many people that showed an interest in him. Of course, he could always choose to enter into another relationship but he was not really interested in doing that. After spending eight years in a nice, but somewhat boring relationship, the last couple of years of which had even been long-distance, he felt entitled to just have some fun, no strings attached.
“I’m sure John didn’t mean it like that, right?” He looked at John who mumbled something incoherent under his breath, blushing slightly, unable to cope with the situation.
Instead, Sherlock smiled and nodded. “Of course, John.”
John swallowed as his mind turned to other, more recent events.
“You’re up for a party tonight?” he asked Mike during breakfast the next morning.
But John wanted to stay. He realized that Magnussen was a creepy arsehole and he knew the course would be incredibly hard, but he knew he could do it. He had always been a very ambitious man and he wanted to rise to this challenge, show everybody, including himself, that he could do this. Prove that arrogant sod that there were students worth his time.
“Good.” Silence stretched out again. On the one hand, Sherlock was triumphant that he seemed to have won that battle, as well as he did have the last word but at the same time, he felt sad and he was terribly annoyed at himself for it.
“Sherlock! Oh God, what is it? Have I done something wrong? I’m sorry, did I go too far?” He grabbed the other man's shoulder, desperate to get some sort of reaction from him, but Sherlock was only staring at him wide-eyed and John was afraid he was on the verge of hyper-ventilating.
“Oh?” A hint of indignation.
“Okay, I’m not making fun of you, I mean it. I know what I said to you that other night when I lost control which was quite the most terrible thing that could have happened to me and it’s not fair of me to put you through the same ordeal, no, it’s really terrible. I’m ashamed of making that decision and I hope you can forgive me. Please, I can only reiterate what I said at the chapel: I only have one friend and that’s you, John…” He trailed off, looking a little lost and he ran a slightly trembling hand through his curly hair nervously. He swallowed heavily. “I’m grateful you’re my friend John. I really am. I’ve never had a friend like you and it’s…. well, it’s made my life so much better okay?” He looked down, obviously unable to look John in the eye anymore, and blushed.
Hush, hush, dreams come a-creepin
The door to their apartment flew open and they jumped apart in shock. Greg Lestrade stood in the doorway, arms akimbo, a little out of breath as he stared at them curiously. Coming to a halt right behind him was Mycroft, dressed as usual in an immaculate three-piece suit, his outfit completed by the inevitable umbrella in his right hand, his brow creased in a somewhat scowling manner.
“Told you, John. This was a good case.”
“Really?” Sherlock’s whole face lit up and John felt his skin tingling at the sight of it.
“Yes, “Scott said slowly, “aaand?” He looked as if he thought John was being exceptionally dim.
“Sherlock, “he urged him, “can you tell me where you’ve been injured?”
“I don’t want to wear this ridiculous hospital outfit, you cannot make me do that!”
“I’m sorry, “he said quietly, and his shoulders slumped down as he forced his body to relax. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to yell at you, Sherlock. I’m getting it all wrong.”
Greg had called reinforcements and while they were waiting for his colleagues, he tried to calm his friend down but to no avail. John was furious. With himself for neglecting to realize something had been wrong with Sherlock. With Sherlock for getting himself into that kind of situation again. With the unknown kidnapper that he had chosen Sherlock as his target. Damn, being famous only had disadvantages for Sherlock, they shouldn’t have made a media spectacle out of themselves, then they wouldn’t be in the situation they were now in.
John simply nodded and got into the ambulance. His mind couldn’t focus on thanking his friend. He just wanted to be at Sherlock’s side again. He couldn’t bear to be away from him for just one second, so he quickly took a seat beside Sherlock’s stretcher and grabbed his hand again.
that Sherlock was hurting and distressed yet at the same time it felt so unbelievably, unmistakably
She laughed again, a brief harsh sound bereft of any warmth, and Sherlock couldn’t help the shiver that ran down his spine.
“How...how did you do that?” he asked, unable to decide if he should feel offended on top of being deeply impressed.
But as soon as he had said the words, Sherlock’s eyes widened in panic and he started to shake his head.
“What? Because I look like a freak?” Suddenly Scott was right in his face and John’s eyes widened as his scent glands were suddenly overwhelmed by the heady scent of anger and fear. At the same time, he was almost mesmerized by the wide bright eyes, suddenly so close. They were sparkling dangerously with defensive fury and he could practically feel his mouth turning dry.
No. He realized he could not bear it. Now that he realized what he really felt for Sherlock he knew he could not go on like before. He needed to tell Sherlock about his feelings. But he knew it would be overwhelming for Sherlock and he was in no state for something big like this so he would have to postpone it until he was better.
“Yes?”
“That’s not fair!” Mike gasped beside him. “That’s not in the book, it’s sixth-semester material, even I don’t know the answer to that question. How mean can he be?”
However, his mind was not completely at ease. Sherlock was traumatized by what had happened to him, but he refused to let his feelings how, he was unwilling to process what had happened. John knew it had been far-fetched to believe his friend would have agreed to see a therapist. But he had hoped he would maybe talk to him. To his best friend. That he would have enough trust in him to confide in him, to talk about his fears and anxieties.
“Yes, “he said into his phone. “I need you for a job. Not right now, no, we need to lay low for a little while. Could you be here by New Year’s? Give or take a few days. Yeah, great. And bring your tools, we’ll need them.”
“Then we have to make him see that he’s not allowed to do that.” Greg’s face was grim with determination and John was touched by his investment in this matter. He really was a good friend to Sherlock, even if Sherlock was too blind to really see it.
But then he saw Donovan frown as she inspected the detective with a furrowed brow. “Wait, what happened to your face?”
“And I already said no, “Scott said coldly, “so just let’s skip this pointless discussion, shall we? I’m already bored.”
John nodded curtly and sat down on the sofa again. God, he didn’t really need Mycroft around him now. He had enough troubles as it is.
“That you are, “Greg said with conviction and he drained his cup of tea in one large gulp. “And I’m glad you’re not getting punished for decking him. I shouldn’t say this as a police officer but if you hadn’t done it, I might have been tempted to do so myself.”
“What happened? How did you manage to get yourself into that kind of situation again? I hate to ask, but I need your statement again, you know how it is.”
“Are you alright?” Mycroft asked. His voice sounded uncharacteristically soft and Sherlock was irritated though he didn’t want to voice it. He wasn’t in the mood for a fight. He felt utterly exhausted and just wanted to drink some tea and rest.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, but his pupils were dilated and unfocused and he raised his head very weakly. “J-John?”
“Yes, “Sherlock mumbled, and he started pacing in John’s bedroom.” There’s one thing I have to say, so please just let me say it, and then I’m out of your hair so you can catch your beauty sleep or whatever.” At John’s sharp intake of breath, Sherlock raised his right hand quickly as if to stop him from disrupting him again and continued. “I know, I know.”
Greg turned an apologetic look at him. “I’m sorry, John. I can’t let you leave. In fact, I have to put you in detention, the Public Prosecutor’s Office is aiming to charge you with murder.”
“Okay. I understand.” John scooted forward in his position so that he was near his friend and he reached out to softly grasp Sherlock’s hand. “It’s okay, “he said quietly, looking into his friend’s green-blue eyes. “I understand.” He rubbed his thumb over the back of Sherlock’s hand in an unusual tender gesture and Sherlock looked at him nervously, a little surprised too.
He began CPR. Thirty compressions to the chest, two quick breaths into the cold, stiff mouth, back to the chest.
“Hey.”
“No!” Sherlock yelled back. “No, he can forget about that, I won’t allow it! I don’t want it, it’s not necessary!”
“Please, John, please!” Sherlock’s whole body was trembling, and he was breathing heavily as he wearily laid his head onto the mattress while keeping John in his vision. As if he was expecting him to pounce on him to drag him away. In his weakened state, he wasn’t strong enough to fight John off and they both knew it, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t plead with him to stave off the unavoidable.
“You, “Magnussen addressed the student, seemingly as mesmerized by him as John had been just a few minutes before, “what’s the target organ of streptomycin-induced toxicity?”
“You okay there, Sherlock? “he asked, and Sherlock was already tired of the concern in his voice.
Feeling a little better, John dampened the cloth he held to Sherlock’s forehead again and again in order to stop or at least lessen the heavy perspiration. If it brought him even a little relief in his sleep, it was worth the effort. He couldn’t stop his hands from brushing through the clammy curls of Sherlock, as it calmed him down, gave him comfort.
Mrs. Hudson flinched at John’s sudden outburst and he was sorry, but he was angry at himself for being so naïve and angry at Sherlock for being so childish and he needed an outlet.
“Wait!” Greg followed him swiftly. “I’ll come with, maybe he’s in trouble again.”
Sherlock rose out of his chair too. “I’m sorry, John, I didn’t want to ….”
The tall Alpha was smug as he explained what he and Sebastian had done with their centipede sample, while Sebastian indicated every single thing Victor was talking about. They had done good work, John saw at once. He dared a quick glance at Scott and saw that the other student barely seemed to be listening, the way he was glancing at the wall or the side, his face showing off his boredom with unashamed candidness.
John blinked in surprise when Scott’s hand suddenly shot up. Magnussen fixed the young student with mild surprise.
She paused, her face red with the anger she had worked herself up into. John watched in sympathy and fascination as she took a deep breath, looking away from him. Her display of anger was a little different than he was used to seeing on others, or even on himself: she was more subtle, less obvious in her fury. She wasn’t yelling or gesturing wildly, her posture markedly non-aggressive in every way. But still, it was there and he could see that it was just as strong and justified as in any other person and something within him stirred. It wasn’t right that she was being treated like this just because she was an Omega. It wasn’t right that she didn’t have the same rights as anyone else, and his inner Alpha howled at the injustice.
“No! John, don’t leave. Please!”
“You know, John?” Sherlock suddenly realized the guy was literally breathing into his face and he felt a foreign hand creeping up his arms, ghosting at the thin material of his shirt.
He made the same dismissive gesture with his hand he had used before - it seemed to be one of his trademarks - and at once, almost all of the students jumped up, grabbing their stuff and almost tripping over themselves in their haste to get out.
“Damn, Sherlock, did we have to bolt like that, like madmen?” he muttered as he typed a quick text back –
Greg was standing in the door, staring at the scene in front of him. Dimmock shrugged and sat back down in his chair.
John swallowed the lump in his throat and squeezed Sherlock’s hand once again in silent reassurance.
Sherlock was up on his feet and in his brother’s face before he even realized he had moved. “Oh, the arrogance of you, imposing upon me, ordering me around as if I was your property, thinking you can decide everything over my head!”
John was alone then, and he let himself fall unto his designated chair heavily. However, after a few seconds of restless fidgeting on the chair, he jumped up again. He was feeling incredibly antsy.
“John, it seems...I think that….there is something….” Sherlock stopped himself abruptly, shaking his head in increasing frustration and it was such an unusual sight to see the great Sherlock Holmes flustered like this, that John found himself staring at him, partly in disbelief, partly in fear.
John watched him sleep, brushing his fingers lightly through those unruly curls, completely entranced and utterly content.
Sherlock’s heart was beating in his throat as he raised his head, on the verge of shuffling closer to John. But before he could do that, John had already moved next to him, pushing against him so that Sherlock’s head rested on his shoulder.
His words took John unaware, yet they were spoken in such a heartfelt manner, that a warm, fuzzy feeling spread through John’s chest immediately. He was stunned into silence for a few seconds, wondering what was behind that sudden acknowledgment of sentiment.
“It’s nothing, really, “he explained nonchalantly, as he picked up his forgotten bag from the floor, pulling it over his shoulder, clearly signifying that he was ready to go. “I was just distracted for a moment, but that’s all.”
They had stopped at home to change into more comfortable clothes which meant a fresh brown lumberjack shirt for John as well as his beloved green jacket and a pale blue dress shirt and trousers for Sherlock. He couldn’t persuade his friend to leave his Belstaff at home for once. Well, he wouldn’t be Sherlock without that coat, would he? The scarf, too although it was only early autumn and quite mild outside.
Sweet oxygen finally filled Sherlock’s lungs and he inhaled gratefully, his gaze still fixed on his best friend. After a few minutes, his breathing calmed down, he felt his heartbeat drop to normal again. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes again. John was observing him intensely and Sherlock was touched to see the relief in his eyes.
He was unlike any other person he had met. Except for Mycroft, but his brother was comfortable being who he was because he had stuck to the principle of sentiment being a weakness. In contrast to himself who was party cold, inhuman, a freak and partly, emotional, weak, unstable, at least in everything concerning John.
She didn’t seem perturbed by his silence. Smiling seductively, she began to circle the chair he was bound to.
He couldn’t do anything. He could just lay there and take whatever that man wanted to do to him.
Scott blushed, shaking his head as he turned away a bit. “That’s not what people normally say.”
“Alright, alright, you don’t have to be mean about it, “Sherlock jumped in, ignoring Mrs. Hudson’s curious side look. “Everyone makes little mistakes from time to time, it doesn't mean anything.”
A hand roughly grabbed him by the shoulder and John turned around to see Greg Lestrade smiling at him. They pulled each other into a manly half-embrace and all said hi to each other. James Sholto was there, as was Bill Murray, and a few other blokes from the rugby team, too.
A pale, lanky student in the first row on the right side, his bright green eyes focussed on the pacing professor, pencil ready in his bony hand. John was struck by how beautiful the guy was.
Greg jerked his chin to the side. “Off you go. We’ll do the paperwork some other time. Text me later, will you?”
The second John saw him his heart started to pound in his chest and he quickly looked the other way, trying to concentrate on Mike’s words.
John took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and closed it again. The corners of Sherlock’s lips twitched but the man remained silent.
“Of course, dear, “she said, glad to be included, and she patted his shoulder affectionally, as she passed him on her way to Sherlock’s bedroom.
John slowly drifted away while all these thoughts were still swirling in his head.
“Oh, he just waited for someone to come in and make the first move so that he wouldn’t be the one to do so. But now that you’re here, I’ll give him…” – John looked at his watch – “oh, I think, ten minutes at the most.”
“Sherlock! Can you hear me? It’s me, John!” Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open at the touch of John’s hands but only barely so and he closed them again immediately, wincing in obvious pain.
“Good!”
“Yeah, I wondered that too,” said Charles, the younger brother sitting next to John. “Maybe they’re sick in the head or something. Especially that one.” He waved his gun in the direction of Sherlock’s face. “The way he was lying there with his face in our stuff, sniffing around – that was almost creepy.”
She scoffed, her jaw clenched and he could see her small hands pulling at the belt loops of her jeans, rising frustration and restlessness piercing through the veil of her calm exterior. Her dark brown eyes pierced into him.
So the wound had gotten infected after all.
“It shouldn’t be legal!” Scott spit out angrily. “It’s inhumane that someone can just decide to murder another person just because they’re an Omega!”
It had been one of the very rare times Mycroft had shown him open affection, something which nowadays would be out of the question, naturally. It did make sense. Mycroft had been the one who had taught him that caring was dangerous and would only bring you pain.
He needed that or they would charge him for the missing glass and then John would make fun of him and that alone was reason enough for him to accept the full glass from the other man’s hand. He was careful not to let their fingers touch because that would be disgusting.
Sherlock didn’t answer, so John decided to take a risk. He scrambled back onto the bed, lying on his side next to Sherlock, careful to leave a strip of empty space between their bodies.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at that but couldn’t suppress a weak grin at John’s sudden eagerness to go wild.
The EEG made a whiny, annoying noise which made John’s ears ring and his own anxiety spiked up as he noticed the panicked look on Sherlock’s face. He had to do something. But before he could do anything, the door opened, and two nurses rushed in.
Scott - the name seemed a little strange for the kid as if it was meant for an older bloke - seemed irritated by his blatant smile and he huffed impatiently.
Only offering a vague grunt of acknowledgment in return, John shut the bathroom door behind him and stepped under the shower. The hot water pouring down on his stiff, tired body felt heavenly. He sighed in content as he tipped his head back and closed his eyes against the hard jet of water from above. He could practically feel every cell in his body waking up, his muscles stirring as he stretched them, flexing his fingers as the fatigue was washed off of him. He grabbed his coconut-scented shower gel and began to quickly but efficiently clean himself, washing his short hair afterwards too. Although he usually preferred longer, slower showers, there was just no time for that today. Chiding himself silently for his thoughtlessness, he quickly got the job done.
“I know you want to. I can feel it.”
“And?”
John’s face flushed with anger. “Don’t even mention that. You kept me prisoner in your bloody car.”
“I said I wanted to rest.”
“Let me see him then.”
He took it from her. “I promise.”
“But if you keep doing that, I won’t be able to hold my promise.”
“I’ll have the chicken schnitzel,” Mycroft said and patted Greg on the hand.
“Me neither.”
John emptied the bucket in the washing machine and turned to him. “You don’t have to do everything yourself, you know. Let a man… me help you with the heavy lifting.”
Sherlock nodded while smirking at his brother. “Evening,” he greeted and left the table.
Like before, he sat with his back against the headboard while Sherlock curled himself up in a fetal position with his head on John’s lap. He calmed down as soon as John started brushing his fingers through his hair and over his forehead.
He jumped up and raced for the door.
Sherlock nodded. He waited until Simon disappeared into the lift before he rushed off to his locker. He grabbed a small plastic sachet out of his bag, took one of the tablets and popped it into his mouth.
“Your house is lovely, Professor.”
Mycroft tapped the tip of his umbrella on the floor while he drew his lips in a thin line. “What is your business with the wife of the drug cartel lord?”
Sherlock’s heart started racing. His eyes grew large when he recalled the last time he went home with one of his professors. “I um… can’t. No thanks, I have to study.” He put the violin and the bow in the case and shut it. “I have to go.”
“No, I have violin lessons.”
His breathing started racing. “Don’t touch me ever again.”
When he glanced back, the woman was gone.
For two months, he received letters from him every week. The letters diminished until it stopped, even though Sherlock kept on writing, sending a letter to him every week.
“You left me for a woman. I can never forget you for that.”
“I won’t.” He shut the door after she left and took his usual place at the back of the room. He played the piece of music he practiced, flawless.
His face lit up. “Oh yeah, Mike.”
John placed his hand on his. “I’m not rushing you into anything, Sherlock.”
“So tell me, did you make any decisions on the list of labs interested in you?” he asked and moved forward to sit on the edge of the couch as well.
John blinked a few time while he smiled. “I didn’t know he’s gay.”
They gazed into each other’s eyes.
After they enjoyed their meal and was on their way back to the car, Simon suggested that Sherlock went back to his place for a nightcap before taking him back to the flat.
Sherlock held his hands up. “Don’t ask me,” he said while cutting him off mid-sentence. “Neither my brother nor my parents know the story.”
“Not much, he was glad to meet me and he asked how you were.”
She continued to show him how to position the violin under his chin and the correct way to stand while playing it.
“Would you maybe consider going to a few counselling sessions?” Sherlock tensed visibly but he still didn’t look at John. “Why?” he asked simply.
He was checked upon at three am but still, his eyes were open his mind racing.
If this Alpha was handsome and popular, on top of being a rugby player and intelligent enough to be studying medicine, no doubt aspiring to be a well-earning, admired physician someday, there would be absolutely no way this Alpha wasn’t an arrogant, entitled prick. Therefore he needed to get his hormones in check, ASAP.
“Alright, four.” Sherlock huffed dramatically, but they were both smiling at each warmly and something inside his chest was tugging. A warm fuzzy feeling filled him from the inside, his fingers feeling tingly, his whole body alight with pleasure, drunk on endorphins.
Even if everything was quite hazy to him, he remembered waking up at some point in the night. He remembered feeling very hot. It had felt as if his whole body had been set aflame and he desperately wanted to peel off his sticky clothes, step into the shower and revel in the cooling relief the water offered. But then, the heat had transformed into a sudden chill, gripping him tight into its merciless arms, and he had changed his mind. The cold was much worse than the heat, chilling him to the bone, freezing him from the inside, and leaving him weak and immobile. Desperation took over him. It was unbearable.
Greg nodded with a short smile. “Alright. See you in a bit.”
He could hear the man clear his throat in a warning and he forced himself to raise his head to meet the expectant gaze of the cruel man in front of him.
“Would you mind telling my brother that I hope he gets better really soon? And that I’ll be in touch.”
“Yeah?” John looked hopeful again and warmth bloomed in Sherlock’s chest at the sight of that adorable eagerness.
“Shhh, it’s okay, “John tried to soothe him, as he lowered them down to the bottom of the tub and laid back against the tiles, positioning Sherlock between his legs, “it’s just water, calm down. We need to get your fever down.”
“Fine, Greg, “John said with a strained smile, “a little tired maybe but that’s all.”
“Yes.”
That’s when a nurse poked her head in. “Mr. Holmes, I’ll be by in just in a few minutes to check your vitals and give you more pain medicine if you need it.”
“So, I take it you need to ask me some questions as well,
“Boys, boys!” Greg stepped in between them, raising his hands to their chests to shove them away from each other. “Be nice to each other, please! Sherlock, please, get back in bed, you’re shaking.”
That’s when it hit Sherlock.
“You know what?” said Charles Dickson to his brother. “I bet they’re into all kinds of sick stuff. I bet they’re faggots, shagging each other senseless with who knows what.”
“Yeah. So?”
At John’s incredulous look at him Greg shrugged helplessly. “I’m sorry, John, but I have to know. We saw you attacking a man rather brutally and we have to know the exact circumstances.”
/////
He changed and brushed his teeth. Then he settled into the bed and found himself lying on his side, staring at Sherlock’s slack form. He was breathing peacefully, and John was strangely entranced by the steady rising and falling of his chest.
He moaned as another wave of arousal surged through him, and he clenched his hands into fists to keep them where they were, utterly annoyed with himself.
John closed his eyes and tried frantically to push his anger away. His breathing slowed down.
Scott studied him warily, disbelievingly. “Do you now?” he eventually sneered. He obviously thought that John was making fun of him.
Sherlock drank the rest of the water and pressed his fingers into his eyes. “So, do I remember correctly? Mycroft will be here soon?”
he thought with a smirk and somehow that thought really lifted his spirits.
John’s heart skipped a beat. “Seriously? Just like that?”
“What about John? He’s your best friend, isn’t he?”
Thank you for reading!
“Show me the picture, “Sherlock said, as he swallowed heavily and with a sudden determined look on his face. He still had some reserves left, it seemed.
John grinned. “Yes, you remembered that right. But my grandmother was born and bred in Glasgow.” Sherlock stared at him incredulously and John chuckled in obvious delight.
It was still that first day and they were at Angelo’s. John had just asked him if he had a boyfriend. This was the part where he had acted unbelievably stupid.
The outrageous howl he gave when a crazy woman was pointing a gun at his head.
When the show was over and Sherlock’s toast was gone as well as John’s soup, John asked mischievously: “Do you want to watch another one?”
But John was sure he was far from being fine. He had refused to talk about that first attack, had been in total denial that it was normal feeling terrified after being assaulted. And now, a second attack. From what it had looked like, it even seemed to have been partly sexual as well. The way that vile woman had pushed her gun in and out of his friend’s mouth …. He felt sick just thinking about it. What was wrong with some people? He just hoped the damage done to Sherlock’s psyche wasn’t too bad, but his hopes weren’t very high. He had to ask Sherlock what exactly had happened in that room. He had to know. If Sherlock weren’t willing to talk to a therapist, that was fine but then he would have to talk to him instead. He was no psychologist, but he was his best friend and he had to force him to confront his fears. He had to be gentle tough, he wouldn’t bring the matter up too quickly. First, they had to get him out of the hospital and make him rest so that he would get well quickly. He would have to watch out that Sherlock wouldn’t slip out again. He would take two weeks off work.
“I’ll call you if I change my mind.” Sherlock jumped out the car before Simon could get hold of his hand again. He strolled over to the driver’s side and bent down. “Thanks for a lovely day.”
After the third attempt of asking him on a date, Sherlock finally agreed and went to dinner with professor Linder.
He pushed himself upright. “I’m not a drug addicted. I took only two sleeping tablets.”
Simon jumped around and rushed out.
He turned his head away. “We can’t. I’m married now.”
At the lift, one of the psychiatrists caught up with him. “Mister Holmes, could I speak with you for a minute?”
“He was working on a case, MI6 took over.”
“Oh come now. Let’s not argue, John. That’s in the past.”
“I know. Do you have a boyfriend?”
They got in after a taxi stopped.
John flung around. “You saw me in pain, mourning, and you couldn’t tell me you were alive.”
The smell of disinfectant hit his nostrils. He was in hospital.
Horny as hell, he jumped into the shower and opened the cold-water tap. He gasped aloud when the cold water jetted onto his warm skin. He sighed while glancing down at his erection. The cold water was useless today.
“Yes, we all know what that was.”
The two weeks went by quickly. The furniture truck was loaded and ready to go.
He grabbed hold of his ear, trying to rub the cream off. “The first day in months I didn’t have early lectures and I overslept.  I have to get to the bathroom before I can continue.”
Deducing the new patients as they wheeled them passed his room, he helped many a time with diagnoses when the psychiatrists missed something.
He smiled. “I had plenty of time, John. After work, it was all I did, thinking of you… of us.”
When Sherlock stepped outside, he shut the door and glanced at the woman standing against the wall. He turned around and headed towards the taxi.
“France, I’ll be gone for a month, maybe longer.” He rushed into the bathroom and took a shower.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “Ugh, not again. I thought they were gone.”
“Yes, he worries about you. He saw on the CCTV monitor in his office you were heading over here. He knows it’s your old dealing place, so he woke me up and asked me to save you from falling for this crap again.”
She showed him the stock sheets, opened the cupboards where they kept all the medical supplies and gave him a pen. “Are you up for it?”
“Huh?” Simon blinked a few times. “Refreshing,” he lied.
Sherlock jumped out of bed, breathless. With enlarged eyes, he stared at him. “My nightmares are back.”
“I do, brother mine.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. He took one of the magazines on the nearby table, crossed his legs and paged through it.
While Sherlock strolled down the corridor back to his dorm room, the sad howling of violin music drifted towards him. He stood still and listened a while before he walked off in that direction. He found the room the music came from, paused and leaned against the doorway with his arms crossed.
‘I’m not spying on you, Sherlock. I saved your life tonight, well, Greg too. MH’
He rolled his eyes while shaking his head and walked over to Sally. “This is bullshit. We had to study, attend classes and he just walks in here as if he was sent by God.”
With his elbow on the arm of the chair, Sherlock supported his head on his thumb and two fingers, while glancing at him. “Me neither,” he said still smiling.
Sherlock grabbed his violin.
Sherlock struggled to free himself. “Let me go. I want to go home.”
He pulled Sherlock’s pajama pants down and gasped aloud as he gazed at his erection. With difficulty, he tore his staring eyes away to unzip his denim jeans. John waited until he turned over onto his stomach, before he placed both hands under Sherlock’s hips and tugged his rear end upwards before entering him.
“She’s James Moriarty’s sister.” He opened the door and glanced back. “Afternoon, John.” He left the door open and trotted downstairs, ignoring Sherlock when he called him back.
Mycroft gasped aloud before covering his mouth. “Poor Sherlock.” He shook his head. “I’m so hard on him. This explains everything.”
“Biscuits, buttermilk biscuits,” he said and took the packet out of the drawer where he hid it. He wanted to give it to him tonight, but since he upset him with word from his brother, he gave it now instead.
After deducing professor Linder a few times, he became aware of the professor’s feelings for him and agreed to meet him for coffee. Although his deductions were never wrong, he remained skeptical and chose the university coffee shop for their meeting.
“Yes, detective inspector at New Scotland Yard.”
After cleaning up the kitchen, he went back to the living room and sat in his favorite chair while listening to the violin music.
“I suppose he has his moments.”
“This meeting is over,” Mycroft said and stood up. He pulled his shoulders back and tapped his umbrella on the floor, glaring at his brother. “There’s one more thing. I didn’t want to tell you, but since you have this attitude.”
Mycroft followed the ambulance to the hospital.
“John? What are you doing here? You should’ve waited for me.”
“In your shoulder. Were you in Afghanistan or Iraq?” he asked while opening his locker.
He snorted. “Okay, I’m leaving. I have to take a shower first.”
“My street network.”
“Aren’t you glad to see me, Sherlock?”
Thanks for reading and leaving kudos ♥
The quiet dormitory was bliss to him during weekends. He preferred to stay in instead of going home. Once every two months, just to please his mother, he would go home for the weekend.
After collecting samples from the cadaver for research, Sherlock went back to the lab.
His head wasn’t throbbing anymore.
Simon jumped off the bed. He caught up with him, threw his arms around him and held him tight. “I am not that monster from Liverpool who hurt you.”
He snorted. “Sorry I can’t say the same about you, brother mine.”
“Business or pleasure?” he asked after taking a seat.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “Doing what?” he asked biting on the left side of his lower lip.
He took a deep breath when he stepped outside into the cool London night air. Why was he so attracted to this woman? John used to be on his mind all the time, but now… He sighed as he trotted towards the main road.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he patted the cell phone against his chin. He had to work tomorrow. He bit his lower lip, searched the lab’s number on his phone and dialed it. “Linda, Sherlock. I’m not coming in tomorrow, will be there on Friday.” He sighed. “Of course I’m fine.” He ended the call and called Mycroft. “No, calling is faster than texting. I want a favor from you.” He shook his head. “Not money. Let them reduce my working hours at Bart’s.” He sighed. “Why do you always have to know everything? I’m going to be a consulting detective. Yes, consulting detective, google it, I’ll be the first one.” He smiled. “Did he tell you I solved the case? Good, now reduce my hours at the lab. I will be there on Fridays only.” His face flushed. “Good god, Mycroft,” he yelled. “This is what I want to do. Yes without pay.” Sherlock arched a brow. “Is Lestrade there? Put him on the phone.” He waited a few seconds, before Greg answered. “Will you talk some sense into your boyfriend’s head,” he said and dropped the call before he could put Mycroft back on the phone.
She turned to him and frowned. “Why are you so jealous of your brother?”
She accompanied him to the door and remained standing in the doorway, waving him goodbye after he got into a taxi.
“Who’s that woman you were talking to?” John asked when Sherlock got into the taxi.
His eyes flung open. He didn’t even notice the music had stopped.
Sherlock glared at her. “Who are you? You are not a journalist.”
He stopped struggling and sighed. “I can’t do this. I told you, you were going to hate me one of these days.”

Sherlock resigned his position in the lab at St. Bartholomew hospital. He didn’t have the time to work there, as well as solving cases. With a good word from Mycroft, the CEO of the hospital granted him permission to use the lab whenever he needed it. It suited him. His bachelor’s flat was too small. There wasn’t enough space to put up the new microscope he bought along with other necessary lab equipment.
“How do you expect me to sleep with that image imprinted in my mind, John?”
He gazed at her, eyeing her from head to toe, trying to deduce her, but failed like the time when he met Irene Adler.
“221B Baker Street,” he said and glanced at John. “I hope you’ll like the flat.”
“If you have something else to do, we can make it another time.”
The psychiatrist nodded. “Did he ever denied or admitted to your accusation of him being a prostitute?”
“You look much better,” Mycroft said.
The backdoor opened up seconds later.
“I stopped using, Whitey.”
He knocked off at five and found Molly in the hospital foyer when he was on his way out. “Thank you for letting me know about the body.” He didn’t wait for a reply and hurried past her.
Sherlock’s head hit the doorframe. He turned around, crawling on his backside into the room trying to get away from his professor.
John’s eyes enlarged. “You have a sister?”
He reached for John’s buttocks, grabbed hold of it and pulled him up against his crotch while caressing his behind.
Sherlock glanced at his watch after he stood up and snorted. “That will be anytime soon.” He pulled his pajama pants up, brushed his fingers through his hair and ruffled them a bit while taking a seat on the couch.
At first, Mycroft, Lestrade and his team made fun of him until they were used to it.
Mycroft’s eyes enlarged as his face flushed. “What did he tell you?”
He turned back, bent forward at the taxi door and talked to John.
He put his glass on the side table before he took place next to Andrew on the edge of the couch and turned to him.
Sherlock picked up his violin and played a piece of music he composed a few days ago.
“You haven’t seen me naked, yet.”
Sherlock glanced at him when he sat down on the couch. Could that be an invitation? He didn’t want to make the same mistake as with Matt. They were attracted to each other. Both were scared to make a move and he left London without kissing Matt once.
“If you want me to beg, I’ll beg,” he said smiling faintly, his eyes pleading.
He nodded. “Yeah, I did file for a divorce.”
Mycroft smiled. “Doctor John Watson, finally we meet.”
He sauntered over to the door and yanked it open. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He turned around, headed for the couch and sat down, crossing his legs.
“About a month ago.”
He never woke up in time to leave the room before five.
“But?”
Sherlock stopped breathing while staring at the handsome man.
Sherlock arched a brow. “And how would you know? Oh wait, you work for the government. You logged into his bank account before dating him. Why do you keep him a secret?”
“How is Sherlock? Is he behaving himself?”
Not once did John demanded sex from him or even suggested it.
“Stop acting like a child, Sherlock.” Simon caught up with him again. “Why are you so difficult?”

Sherlock took his coat and scarf off, hung it behind the door before he stepped into the living room and dropped onto his chair.
John rushed downstairs to Missis Hudson’s flat and knocked on the door.
“You don’t need to blog about all our cases. Who reads it anyway?”
Sherlock turned his head slowly towards him, raising a brow. “You didn’t…” He gasped aloud. “Oh my god, you and Greg thought I want to contact her for drugs.” He jumped up again. “My god, Mycroft, the woman didn’t even know he was a drug lord until he was busted for it,” he yelled. “She was elated when he was sentence to death.”
Sherlock ignored the remark. “You have to question the gardener again.”
“When will you be back?” his wife asked.
“I think it’s important, Sherlock.”
He smiled at them, put the violin in its case and handed it to Willa. “Thank you. I’ll buy my own the end of the month.”
He picked up the violin case and shoved it under his arm. “I know, but I have to go, Professor.”
John returned from shopping when a black sedan with tinted windows stopped next to him. The chauffeur jumped out and opened the backdoor, ordering him to get it. After he refused, his cell phone rang. When he answered, a voice commanded him to get into the car. The person called him by his name and profession.
Mycroft arched a brow. “Oh, you don’t know? She’s Irene’s girlfriend.”
He scoffed at him. “I can ask you the same thing. This is not your usual dining place.”
“That went well,” John said when they were alone in the flat again. “Your brother is quite a pleasant guy after all.”
He shut his eyes, thinking of him and John making out behind the curtains on the stage. That was when she appeared out of nowhere. She saw them shagging. She smiled at him then disappeared.
He nodded. “I’ll be ready.” He opened the car door. “Thanks for dinner, I’ve enjoyed it.” He gasped aloud when Simon put a firm grip on his shoulder, pulling him closer. He blocked him with his hands against his chest. “Please don’t, not tonight.”
He shook his head and tried focusing on the words again.
Greg glanced at the two brothers. “Would you excuse me for a second,” he said, stood up and left the table.
Sherlock opened the door and dragged himself out of the car.
She grabbed his arm and cuddled up against him. “Nice and cozy for new lovers, isn’t it.”
“I always pay attention, Professor.”
“Oh god, what –”
Sherlock was losing sleep of the uppers he popped regularly. He didn’t eat and lost a lot of weight. He sat in front of the computer, staring at the screen, the words swimming in front of his eyes.
“I don’t need friends. I don’t have friends.” He glanced at John and smiled faintly. “I have only one.”
Janet chuckled. “Mycroft was right he’s the clever one, not you.”
“I know. Your name is on my subjects list.” He turned back to the desk, chucked his sling bag on the floor and sat down.
The doctor led him into a vacant room. “What happened to your brother in Liverpool?”
Simon sighed. “You’re a difficult man to persuade, Mister Holmes.”
He frowned when he let go. “I am capable to carry heavy things,” he said while following him to the bathroom.
“Mycroft,” she called out when she jumped out of the car. She hurried up to him and threw her arms around his neck. “I was wondering if you were coming to greet us before we leave.”
Sherlock looked up from the microscope and glanced at his watch. “One o’clock already?” He stood up, stretched his back and took his packet of cigarettes out of his lab coat’s pocket. “I’m on the roof if anyone’s looking for me.”
“I want this, I want you.”
“Why not, this is the best part.” He ignored him and tried again.
Simon brushed his finger over Sherlock’s cheek. “I hope you change your mind.” He smiled while watching his beautiful man walking away. He started the engine and waited until Sherlock entered the building before he drove off.
Their lips met again, their hands all over each other.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “Not now.” He put the violin down, grabbed the phone from John and dialed Mycroft’s number. “What now, don’t you think Britain can wait?” He sighed and shut his eyes as he listened while his brother explained. “Fine, I’ll do it.” He pulled a face and chucked the phone on the couch.
John snorted. “Who are you and how do you know Sherlock?”
He opened his eyes and furrowed his brows. “Ow, it hurts.” He relaxed his facial muscles before he asked. “What do you mean?”
A woman in her late sixties opened up. Her face lit up. “Sherlock,” she called out and threw her arms around him after he stepped closer.
He nodded. “The island was wonderful, beautiful actually. Great weather for the time we’ve been there.”
“I’m a consulting detective. I used to work here, but now I’m using the lab only when I have to analyze evidence I found on crime scenes.”
John glared at him, before he switched off the light. He put his arm under Sherlock’s head and the other one around his body and pulled him closer.
He nodded. “I made one mistake, though.”
His whole body was sore and stiff.
He raised his head slowly and locked eyes with his new science lector. He almost gasped aloud as he laid eyes on the tall sturdy man with the short blonde hair.
He cocked his head and smiled. “Mummy, I’m working for the government, remember.”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged while gaping at him. “John, wait.” He caught up with him and grabbed his arm. “Why do you worry about me?”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged. Within seconds, he stood on his feet and held his hands in the air. “I’m so sorry. I thought… I thought you were… I’m sorry,” he brushed his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock took a taxi the next day to meet with Greg at New Scotland Yard. After going through the case files, he took him to the crime scene at an old house in Brooklyn.
Sherlock smiled as he pulled John against him. “We better go inside, the neighbors will talk.”
He paused at the taxi door and glanced over his shoulder. His eyes enlarged before he jumped around facing her. “It’s you,” he called out.
Mike pointed to the bench where he left his food. “Have a seat. Be with you in a minute.” He trotted off as fast as his plump body allowed him to the café. He hurried back with John’s coffee and handed it to him.
He was hardly breathing. He narrowed his eyes trying to recognize the man.
He jumped up, straightened his clothes and glared at her. “Yes, I’m fine. What do you want?”
“Do you want to see the flat now or are you in a hurry?”
“I was working under cover. I had to keep it a secret, no one knew except Mycroft and…”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged and he gasped aloud, when their bare skin touched.
He pointed to the tall building on his left. “St. Bart’s hospital, I’m a lab technician there.”
Anderson chuckled. “This is police work, not some kind of lab experiment.”
“It’s Willa. Sit down. I will get you a violin.” She disappeared into a room at the back and returned with a violin case. “I prefer that my students have their own violins, but I do make exceptions.” She gave it to him and started his first lesson by telling him the names of the different parts of the violin. “This may seem like useless information, but it is important. Now stand up.”
“Sod the neighbors.” He placed his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks, pulled him down and kissed him on the lips. “Now they can talk.” He grabbed his suitcase, held the door open and trotted behind him up the stairs.
The taxi dropped them off in front of the address he gave.
“No,” he replied bluntly. “I’m going back to the car. Good day, Mycroft.”
“It’s too heavy. Let me carry it.”
The lector stopped writing on the blackboard. His hand remained on the board as shut his eyes and bit on his teeth. He hated when someone interrupted him while writing a formula on the board. “Can I help you,” he asked without looking at the person who entered.
His breathing sped up. “You don’t want me, John. I’m damaged goods.”
“Doctor Müller wants to keep you here for another week, maybe longer.” He glanced at his brother before taking a seat next to his bed. “I can help you if you want to make a case against the person who hurt you in Liverpool.”
