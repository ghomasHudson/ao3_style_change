Castiel Novak was a nerd, first and foremost. He spent the majority of his time at college in his dorm, either reading his own books, or reading the material for his classes, and studying. He didn't frequent parties, and he definitely didn't date. Not because he hated the idea, but he just didn't go out, and he wouldn't date anyone he already knew from his, admittedly, very small friendship group. That was up until Charlie introduced him to Dean Winchester, and Castiel had developed a crush within minutes. Dean's eyes, his freckles, and the way his confidence filled a room, really hooked him in. It took them barely two months to reach best friend status.  It wasn't until second year that he and Dean moved in together, to save money, of course, and Cas was elated that he'd get to spend time with his best friend, and maybe see him hanging around their little apartment half naked. Of course, that had nothing to do with it.
“Campbell,” he confirms quickly, silently impressed at his capability to retain the easygoing façade in spite of the glaring danger. Rolling back his shoulders before shooting her a disarming grin. “You must be mistaking me for someone else.”
With a resigned sigh, he strains across the leather seat to unlock the passenger side door. Pointedly ignoring her glower as she marches around the front of the car, and clambers inside. Propping a considerably bulky, steel briefcase between her knees.
Dean clasps the amulet Sam gifted him prior to his reluctant trip to Nowhere, Purgatory. The only tangible reminder he possesses of the life left behind.
“Of course,” the Seraph confirms without inflection. His eyes flicking up to reconnect with Dean’s own, pinning him under its intensity. “And you?”
Dean chuckles, beside himself with the new lengths he’s willing to go for a paltry wage. And exhales audibly, as he plops down onto his respective chair flanking the table—eying the glass pieces of the chess set with increasing uncertainty.
“Yes.” An inscrutable smile of her own strains the corners of her mouth. “I must be,” she agrees, tautly, before mercifully releasing him from the grips of her scrutiny to commence typing in the code.
“Why?” The Seraph’s eyes narrow at the request, instantly suspicious.
cleaning up that mess, and that was almost a year ago!”
“Yeah?” he rasps, positive the repetition won’t cease unless he responds.
His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
“Need a place to stay for a while,” Dean finishes dimly. The loose planks groaning inordinately loud beneath their combined weight; even more so, once he decidedly eases the bags onto the deck.
Her glossed lips press firmly into a line in indication of her thinning patience. The fact he isn’t buying the shit she’s selling an apparent insult towards her manipulative abilities.
“Yeah, well…” Dean sniffs, and nonchalantly examines the damp patch of fabric with his palm; finding the layers of cheap gauze beneath have soaked through entirely. “It’s late. We still have a few hours ahead of us, so go back to sleep.”
A mirthless smile tugs at Dean’s lips, bracing himself for John’s impending rage. “Oh, believe me.” Feebly gesturing towards the house with a small wave of his hand, he assures, “This was the last resort.”
Dean inhales deeply, conceiving the trap he may very well be waltzing into. “Anything you want.”
Pursing his lips, Dean glances about the room with incredulity; his gaze falling upon the rumpled sheets of the bed. “As long as I’m compliant. Catering to your every whim, right?”
“Oh, yeah,” he huffs, shooting a disdainful glare in said demon’s direction. One that hasn’t, apparently, ceased eyeing him like a fresh piece of meat. “She’s a real peach.”
“Hey! Earth to Winchester!”
“That’s reassuring,” he murmurs while hastily typing in the digits of a specific birthday he’ll never permit himself to forget. “Can I, at least, have the name of the person currently holding my life in their hands?”
“I was,” he confirms, as he adjusts his jacket and methodically smooths the creases from the worn material. “Until the road became bumpy.”
An indiscernible expression crosses the Seraph’s face at that before it steadily morphs into one of dawning comprehension. “I possess something you desire.”
“Not if you’re planning on participating in my game.” The man reaches to pick a tumbler, bringing it to his mouth to indulge.
There’s a pause of consideration, and Dean barely dares to hope he’ll be granted this one request.
No such luck. She presses the measuring cup to his lips in silent demand. With a sigh of resignation, Dean grudgingly drinks it, then coughs out, “Get an ambulance out here.” When she doesn’t move but stares down at him dispassionately, he adds, “You got what you wanted. I kept my end of the deal!”
“You,” he says at length, mouth thinning in displeasure.
“Then,” the reaper starts, gravely. “You and your nearest of kin will cease to exist.”
“You’re mine, now.”
'You keep using that word; I don't think it means what you think it means.' -Inigo Montoya (The Princess Bride)
A soft scoff escapes Dean at that. “Poker isn’t entirely based on luck.”
She shoots him a scathing look, clearly peeved enough to find fault in any explanation he has at the ready. “I was waiting on you for over an hour. When it became clear you were pulling a no show, I had to call in a favor with Bradbury to hack the city’s surveillance cameras to locate you.”
Vexation alights a fire in the hazel tones of her eyes. The corners of her mouth twitching as she grits out, “You’re an ass.”
The private backroom he’s escorted to by staff is equally elegant by its interior as the rest of the building, if not more over the top. Remarking silently, as he’s ushered inside, the collection of gold framed Renaissance paintings embellishing the walls, and statuettes of angels adorning any available smooth surface. Every minute detail—from the marble fireplace to the crystal chandelier aloft the table—an argument against frugality. And giving Dean an uneasy impression of definitive influence, similar to that of entering a house of worship.
he wonders.
Dean huffs in disbelief, nervously eying the white queen’s position. “You think you can read me that easily, huh?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I won’t force myself on you,” the Seraph suddenly informs with such astounding veracity, it momentarily takes Dean aback. “Nor will I require you, at any point, to perform lewd acts against your will. You are free to make decisions, within reason. There are, of course, a few stipulations.”
Hell if he knew the correct term.
he’s decided to partake, and hurriedly crams what remains into his mouth. The action freeing his hands on the off chance of an assault, but causing him to appear less than intimidating with puffed cheeks and crumb sprinkled lips.
A finger twitches on the trigger.
“This should be enough to pique the Seraph’s interests.” Tapping her nails absently against the outer casing, she elucidates without prompting, “He typically favors the high rollers whom collectively participate in a weekly winner-take-all poker game. So, you might need to take an innovative approach to cull him from the herd beforehand.”
The door is whisper quiet while it slowly swings outwards to reveal a teenage girl, who appears to be anything but thrilled to be there. Dean instantly catching himself in the act of scrutinizing the way her hair cascades in loose waves over one shoulder, and that along the other side of her head, it’s been neatly portioned and pulled into tight braids. Mascara is smudged around her lashes with purpose to enhance the cobalt tones of her eyes, causing them to be ever more striking, even from a distance. The bland, ebony cocktail dress she’s clad in incongruous to her unique sense of style, and is worn unwillingly, if the imperceptible hunch to her posture is anything to go by. Formal attire, seemingly, robbing her of her confidence.
With a long-suffering sigh, the Seraph considers the board and pieces intently. His fingers skimming its edge in an almost languid manner, thumb tracing the contours of the black knight with an odd sort of gentleness. His actions effectively throwing Dean off guard enough that he doesn’t expect for him to suddenly move with near inhuman speed, heaving the entirety of the set in his direction. Only allowing Dean a second to fling his arms up to act as a meager shield against the barraging figures of glass.
Dean halts before the opened trunk of the car, not daring to obey just yet.
Dean shoots him a thoroughly unamused look, and is all but relieved to behold whiskey tinged eyes peering mischievously out at him from between nearly skeletal arms—glinting with juvenile mirth.
Turning his eyes downcast, the Seraph thoughtfully traces a finger along the rim of his glass. Each passing second almost as unbearable as the job at hand; that is, until the keen stare returns. The Alpha ominously concise in his reply: “You.”
“Time’s up,” the reaper informs without inflection. Remaining unfazed by the glower Dean’s directing at him. “Now, proceed to the door, H-6.”
“What?” he grumbles, irritable, and peels his cheek from the cool glass of the car window to properly glare at the asshole who’s disturbed his slumber. Not entirely surprised to be met with a mirroring gaze, one which he’s been graced with damn near every encounter with the ever elusive co-worker. Or should he claim, co-conspirator?
,” he subtly nods in direction of the angel, “as far as you can.”
“Yeah.” He fights to swallow past a large lump forming in his throat. “I know you do.”
Collecting his feet under her arm, she commences dragging him across the ground. Frozen mud mercilessly scraping the skin of his hands and arms, while rocks and rogue twigs jab and dig mercilessly wherever they make contact. He bites down on the gag against the pain, his stomach turning in protest of the motion.
The crunch of gravel underfoot alerts him to her return. Some tension leaving him at the lack of gunshot and her intention clutched in her gloved hand. Mary waves Cas’ cellphone before dialing the emergency number. Placing the call on speaker for his benefit and, more than likely, his torment—given his inability to cry out for help.
“It’s colder than Hoth out here,” Dean jests, clambering onto his own pad spaced roughly six feet apart.
“She’ll still be here when you get back,” Sam’s quick to dismiss. “And I’ll be here, too.” A beat passes, then, “Bobby and I won’t miss a viewing. We’ll, you know, try to help you as best as we can from here.”
Once inside, he’s keenly aware, there’ll be slim to no chance of running away. Mary is thorough, calculating, and clever. Honing her craft over time until she perfected it. Leaving no room to be careless, not now that she’s gained him back.
“But, I’m hungry,” comes the muffled plea. “And I don’t want cheese crackers or fruit snacks.”
In his haste to sit upright, he realizes his mistake in the action, as his bleary world takes to spinning and tilting sharply on its axis. The ringing in his ears ratcheting up in volume, while his arms tremble with effort to sustain his weight.
The pain of it sears through his skull, rendering him helpless for several crucial seconds. Her curses echoing around him as he breaks through the headache and fumbles frantically for the restraint. Nearly removing the strap tip from the metal prong when a hand seizes his wrist, fingernails digging into his flesh until a muffled cry escapes him and his own fingers relinquish their grip.
Having obtained enough knowledge from the recording of the last tournament, it’s safe to venture that nothing remotely good is about to transpire in the arena. Yet, sadly, the information still leaves him woefully unprepared for what’s to come. Even considering the practice he’s had from countless brawls, bar fights, and sparring matches with Sam, none of it adds up to the severity of
Collapsing back onto the soft surface of what he easily guesses is a bed, Dean screws his eyes shut, and reluctantly draws upon the teachings of his father. Recalling, the first steps of centering himself; striving to respire slow and evenly, until the crippling terror subsides. Finding, in the settling calm, that the collar isn’t constricting his airway in the slightest, and that his panic has been the true source of the sensation.
Dean casts a quizzical glance over the rim of the case at her. “And if I fail?”
He misses Sam’s reply when the phone’s unceremoniously yanked from his hand. The lack of closure splintering his entire world.
“I said get in.”
The unexpected voice startles him and nearly causes him to lose grip on the can—fumbling in attempt to prevent it from bashing against the dashboard.
“Frankly, yes,” the Seraph says casually, scanning the state of the room with perceptible intrigue. “It is the usual response, after all.”
Dean jolts awake with a desperate gasp; conceiving he’s choking by the distinct pressure digging mercilessly into his throat. His hand instantly reaching to claw at the object affixed around his neck—only to have a kernel of fear take root deep in his gut when the pads of his fingers trace the sleek curvature of a metallic band. Dejectedly, discovering the ends secured inside a sturdy, solid plastic connector with no detectable release latch to withstand tampering. Much similar to those commonly used by skin traffickers in lieu of cattle tags to keep track of their valuable commodities.
“It’s fine,” Dean strives to alleviate some of Sam’s anxiety, aware the truth will only incite Sam to act risky in the name of family. “Everything’s going to be okay, Sammy.”
“Want some life-saving advice?” The demon’s voice feathers into his ear just as a mountain of blankets, assorted weaponry, and survival kits materialize from virtually nowhere. Scattered about in the unoccupied space before them.
“I was under the impression I’d been acquainted with every guest present this evening,” a distinctly low, gravelly voice sounds from behind, prompting Dean to spin around from the bar in order to match it with a face. His breath hitching when he immediately beholds eyes likened to a fathomless cerulean sea; their surface glinting with intrigue and something Dean can’t quite decipher.
—through the most congested part of the city. We’re
He attempts a chuckle but instead emits a violent cough as his lungs protest the icy air. “Dean Winchester,” he introduces.
“Got me there,” Dean returns stiffly, unable to deny the fact. “And I’d wager you to be a bit of a dick, judging by your need to base people off their
The man’s lips quirk at that, amused. “Or, perhaps, I’m simply being astute.”
“I’d rather be Kirk than Picard,” Dean argues, easily catching the reference with fake outrage. His simmering anger saved for the powers that be reducing him to some number identifier. “You actually like being labeled as H-1?”
“Yeah?” Dean habitually licks his lips, and shifts his weight between feet in challenge. “In that case, I want to make a phone call.”
“With me?” A huff. “Yeah,” she answers, snippy, though Dean is beginning to suspect he isn’t responsible for her irascible mood. And considers her for another protracted minute, as he belatedly notes the arrest to her gaze. Staring him down with such unnerving intensity, he wonders if she’s able to see straight through to the back of his skull. Her look suggesting how keenly aware she is of his own covert monster currently lying dormant within him, and steeling herself to either fight or flee at any hint of movement. The girl being far too young, Dean determines, to be this cognizant of the danger he presents.
"But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
“Thirty seconds,” the deep voice startles him. And Dean barely manages to squash the urge to deck the reaper for the interruption.
Mary’s face instantly becomes stony. Her eyes as sharp as the warning on her tongue, “Take them or I don’t call.”
The Seraph’s lips quirk again, causing Dean to quietly remark at how effortless it is to amuse the dickbag. “I presumed you would prefer staking your life on a game of skill rather than one where you rely heavily on chance,” he explains with the absence of a shrug, fingers fiddling with the ivory rook at his end of the board.
Dean scoffs, clutching a hand to his chest in mock affront. “Hey, I single-handedly disbanded the Romanian Alpha child-trafficking conglomerate with a bullet to that smug, golden-eyed bastard's head.” Lifting his pointer finger for emphasis, he finishes proudly, “First shot.”
Disbelief fleets across the kid’s face; the skin between his brows pinching prominently with worry. “That’s what you always say.”
He managed to escape once, and she’ll make damn sure there won’t be a second time.
He stiffens at the equivocal threat. Feeling vaguely nauseous, he smartly turns away and head for his respective pad on the opposite side. The haunting echo of maniacal laughter chasing after him and setting his teeth on edge.
“Hey,” Dean starts, patiently waiting until their gazes lock again to continue, “It’s not going to be like that anymore. Okay?”
A responding soft sigh pierces the roar of impinging rain upon the car. Dean’s breath hitching when he observes a sober expression harden the soft angles of the boy’s face, aging him far beyond his years. “Shouldn’t you go to a hospital?”
that you ‘envisioned’?” he starts, finding his feet, and balling the soiled towels in his hands. Discovering the Alpha standing uncomfortably close when he whirls around to face him, and clad in the same suit from the previous night. “Class 5 hurricane; complete and utter destruction?”
“Sammy,” he starts, mildly impressed by his ability to maintain an even tone, given the circumstances. “I just… Baby’s all yours if I… I mean, promise me you’ll take good care of her. So help me, Sammy, if you mistreat her—”
It’s another hour before the boy stirs; blinking and turning his head to shield his eyes from the brutal assault of the sun. The freckled skin at the bridge of his nose crinkling as a sign of irritation before he scrubs tiredly at his face.
“Yeah.” Dean’s head droops in defeat, his breath catching as he mutters, “Just make sure to take care of yourself first. You hear me?”
,” Charlie urgently interjects, gesturing with a curt nod of her head once she gains his attention. “Over there.”
“Nah,” Dean breezily dismisses, forcing a reassuring grin that he’s aware does little in assuaging the boy’s concern. Unable to erase what young, perceptive eyes have already witnessed. “It’s not that bad,” he lies.
Curious now, Dean opts to remain mute. Enduring their reserved indecision, until he’s rewarded with another set of tentative knocks; though, this time done fractionally louder.
It’s meant to be simple.
,” she says with fervor and bites her bottom lip with enough force to break the skin; allowing a trickle of blood to trail beneath her chin.
from the Alpha when the tiny transmitter, taped a few inches beneath his armpit, becomes exposed. His heart hammering against his ribs, as he feels a rough brush of stubble against his cheek.
Another hum, this time in assent. Dean watching those startling eyes avert in favor of observing the bartender upon his approach, who deposits not one, but two scotches on the sleek surface before them. A small smile gracing the Alpha’s otherwise unreadable countenance once he catches Dean’s look of confusion.
,” she practically snarls, and to drive her point home, flings the tray through the door. Uncaring of how the contents strew across the immaculate, ivory carpeting, while she makes to slam the door with enough force to rattle the frames of the paintings. The scraping of the bolt that summarily follows unsettling in its finality.
The odds of his return, he knows, are slim to none.
he registers with growing trepidation, pulse pounding a relentless rhythm against his temples.
With a wry smile, he breezily returns, “Of course. His ass or mine; nothing new there.”
Heart rate quickening, Dean ungracefully follows suit; though, he hurriedly moves to insert himself in a safe space between the Alpha and the doors. Loathe to surrender the battle just yet.
So, needless to say, it’s a place Dean stands out like a sore thumb in his leather jacket, worn denims, and mud crusted boots. Garnering suspicious looks from guests and staff alike in the duration of checking in and journeying to his room. Making a mental note to one day hire a tailor to fit him for a suit when he ventures back to the sweeping golden arches of the foyer, and straight through the double glass doors of the casino. Having made certain to inject another dose of synthetic hormones into his system prior to departing the elevator.
“Her name is Abaddon,” a thickly accented voice chimes in, and he whirls to regard the demon on his other side.
Those poised in an intimidating display while unfazed by the arctic-type weather could be none other than the angels. And if it weren’t for their unfaltering stoicism, Dean would’ve had a bitch of time telling them apart from the demons. Given the fact, it’s the first time anyone’s seen them out of their celestial armor and in what looks to be business casual. As if planning to attend some big board meeting as soon as the killing spree’s concluded. The image so absurd that ducks his head to cough a laugh into the stiff collar of his hoodie.
The Grand Angelus stands beachside of the San Diego Bay. A towering structure fifteen stories high, and secluded within an impressively vast acreage. The intricate architecture transparently modeled after the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome, while its grandiosity is proclaimed by its steady influx of wealthy clientele. That of which percentages largely to those of celebrity status and prosperous businessmen.
“I’m in a five star prison.” Dean scoffs, crinkling his nose at the onslaught of flowery fragrance upon venturing further inside. Bending to locate the sets of exceedingly fluffy towels hidden within the cherry wood cabinets beneath the tempered glass sink, all meticulously folded aside toiletries and other beauty care products.
“You have five minutes.”
Meet up in public, maintain distance while retrieving his personal items, then leave.
Startled by a sudden knocking from the other side of the main pair of ivory wooden doors, Dean fumbles the two
Dean desperately scans the playing field, discovering only one direction for his king to flee; now effectively trapped on a row between the white queen and the rook. Realization dawning that he’s only two turns away from losing everything, and understanding, rather belatedly, that there isn’t anything he can possibly do to change that fate.
“I know I can.” Taking out Dean’s rook, he expands, “I have nothing else equal in value to your bid, and you wouldn’t be risking your neck merely for money. Plus,” he pauses, visibly malcontent. “It so happens that I have a score to settle.”
Eyes narrowing, she scoots nearer to the door, gripping the handle but not yet swinging it outwards. “721 Paradise Avenue; Grand Angelus Hotel. Your reservation is under Campbell. Be there no later than 2000 hours.”
eventually kill you.” The demon finally shifts to meet Dean’s gaze fully. “I’m just merely propositioning a deal that’ll prove beneficial for the both of us. A little tit-for-tat, if you will.”
“Is that right?” Dean returns lowly, tossing the wad unconcernedly to the small but elegant breakfast table adjacent the window; the slap of wet cloth against the wood piercing the tension. “Pretty sure a willing person wouldn’t be choked, drugged, tagged, and locked inside a room.”
Dean huffs cynically. “Yeah, that’s
“Her?” the Seraph parrots before a spark of recognition alights his eyes. “You mean Claire. I haven’t compelled her to do anything.”
So, he opens his throat to sing"
Dean eyes the gauge needle as it dips dangerously toward empty, inciting him to scan ahead for a frontage road or an extended shoulder—somewhere he can pull over safely. Thankful, for having some equanimity to fill up the gas can along with the tank before getting the hell out of dodge. Knowing, intuitively, that a stop at any fuel station or general establishment could point fingers in their direction.
Veins of light carve across the dark canvas of sky and illuminate the partially flooded, muddy back road he navigates away from the freeway. Bringing the Impala to a halt at an unmarked crossroads before killing the engine. The ferocity of the storm impressing upon the metal and glass with remarkable force, as though their stillness has incurred its wrath.
John’s response is instantaneous; his countenance contorting irately at the supposed affront, and upper lip curling to expose teeth as he demands incisively: “Get off our property.”
A hand latches painfully onto his wrist moments after; the steely grip grinding the fragile bones until the pain forces him to relinquish the knife. Dean emitting a curse, as he listens to his only defense clatter to the floor before he's roughly shoved in reverse, his breath rushing from his lungs when his backside impacts a wall. The Alpha’s forearm pinning him against the solid surface by the throat, applying enough pressure to onset asphyxiation.
He can’t help it. After decades of battling to survive on his own, he’s been conditioned to respond without a second thought to potential consequences. “That isn’t my name anymore.”
“Get in the trunk, Deanna.”
Dark eyes narrow, but the demon concedes the point. “Fine. Do what you want. Although…” He once more faces the opposing side, crossing his arms nonchalantly over his chest. “I probably shouldn’t mention that while you’ve been preoccupied with Sugar Lips over there, you’ve become the target of something a bit more…
Dean jolts to full cognizance when the rapping persists. Whoever it is insistent upon waking him regardless of his sleep deprivation.
“Cas,” he whispers, brokenly. His voice seemingly detached from his own body, foreign to his own ears.
“Is that you, Dean?” comes Sam’s winded voice the moment the line clicks. Not allowing Dean a chance to answer as he spouts questions in rapid-fire: “Are you okay? What’s going on? Are they letting you go?”
As she secures it, Dean takes advantage and wrestles his trapped arm free. Blindly swinging it to snare coarse locks of her hair in his fist. Pleased by the surprised intake of breath from her before he collides their foreheads together.
“The ones here will buy you a bit of time, at best. It’ll be nothing more than a scratch if you’re lucky to land a hit,” the demon answers, scarcely loud enough for them to hear. “You’re better off finding the hidden gems before any of us do. Now those will make a grown immortal weep.”
“Yeah. And also your grandson,” Dean adds on, hoping to appeal to his better nature.
“Yes.”
Dean shakes his head wordlessly in disagreement, his silence allowing his brother this glimmer of hope rather than the alternative.
To his credit, the bartender forgoes the forced pleasantries, and instead leads on with a straightforward, “What can I make you?”
Dean chuckles despite himself, supposing her assessment isn’t entirely false. “I try.” He shrugs, observing her disapproving frown deepen before nodding indicatively towards the case. “That for me?”
Dean bristles at the command, his hands curling into fists as he stares down the aforementioned hunk of metal several feet down the corridor. The dimly lit walls seeming to creep inwards the longer he stands there, threatening to crush.
He gasps, wrenching back to reality. Finding he’s stumbled backward a few steps with the heels of his Doc Martens hanging precariously over the edge of the pad. Disoriented, his mind rushes to catch up to the last few moments; the fragment of memory fading into the frozen scene before him.
Jo conveys her indifference in regards to his predicament with a small, noncommittal shrug. “We need the information he possesses on Crowley’s whereabouts. Do what you need to do, but endeavor to be discreet,” she says matter-of-factly, then rushes to add, almost as an afterthought, “We don’t need a repeat performance of Bucharest.”
Mary releases a long-suffering sigh as she once more digs inside the bag, producing a handkerchief. And Dean isn’t dumb enough to argue when she fits him with the gag. Grunting softly at the discomfort as she secures it.
“And what’ll happen if I don’t follow these rules?” Dean ventures, squinting against the fractional change in lighting.
“I mean it this time,” he returns, earnest, and grasps the boy’s denim clad arm for emphasis. “I won’t let anyone hurt you, again. You hear me?”
That is, until the mass shifts, aiming once more for the lifeless form on the ground.
Fleetingly hopeful that a family isn’t far beyond the realm of possibility before a soft snort escapes him at the ridiculous thought. Inwardly chastising himself for even considering that a killer could be desirable to anyone with a decent amount of sanity—Alpha or otherwise.
Her eyes dart back to him at his none too subtle accusation. The anger that’s been simmering beneath the surface now rising in a tidal wave to consume.
“Trust me,” she intones, warningly. “That isn’t a favorable outcome on your part.”
Dean struggles. Bending his knees, he attempts to kick outward and roll onto his stomach; desperately desiring to dislodge her hold. However, it proves futile when she twists with him and pivots on her heel enough to secure his legs with her free arm. Their awkward angles hardly hindering her as Mary tows him through the now open door. Having little regard for the metal sill on the floor which rips into Dean’s elbow, drawing a muffled shout from him.
Still, despite the flash of wealth, Dean has to admit the improvements of his environment, however gaudy. Comparatively more tolerable than the utter dumps he normally scopes out. His assignments often leading him to vile, amoral holes in the ground where brawls are imminent and questionable stains are commonplace. The repulsive stench of vomit, ammonia, and a variation of other bodily fluids never entirely washing clean from the fabrics of his clothes. Therefore forcing him to chuck the sullied garments into a nearby dumpster with intent to buy new sets from random thrift shops subsequent of each successful hit.
“But you seem to be holding it together pretty well,” Charlie observes, cutting him from his reserved musings. He grunts in half-hearted agreement as he stamps his feet with hope to jolt some life back into them.
“Yeah, I bet you haven’t,” Dean says, tone dripping with sarcasm. “Just deluded her into believing the idea of gifting herself to me wasn’t yours.” Jutting his chin, he wonders, “How long did it take for her to become your unresisting slave? A week? Two weeks?”
they’ll be treated.”
Dean releases a defeated huff at that, much too drained for puerile arguments. “There’s a peanut butter sandwich in the food bag.”
After all, being an independent gun for hire falls within a marginal grey area of justice. Especially, where governmental agencies are involved—surreptitiously employing killers like himself to straddle the line of sanctioned security procedures and unlawful executions in their stead. Being expendable glaringly obvious, even despite the luxuries he’s afforded for his continued silence. And knowing that it’s far better to be conscious of the fact he’s walking on thin ice than to delude himself into thinking he won’t be thrown under a bus—figuratively and more than likely, literally—if shit hits the fan.
The Alpha hums in response, and gifts Dean a casual once-over which oddly leaves him feeling exposed. “Judging by your apparel, I’d wager you’re not really one for tradition.”
, he thinks stubbornly. Even as his shirt rucks up and his bare backside scrapes across an icy patch of snow. Grunting out his agony as quietly as possible.
Dean’s throat is unsurprisingly tender when he swallows; conjecturing that his trachea has been bruised, but is, otherwise, unharmed. Inwardly debating whether or not to mark off the fact he’s still alive as a positive; especially, with the looming likelihood of being sold off as breeding stock.
“Consider it more an assurance of integrity,” she returns somewhat patronizingly. And waiting until he has completed the task to add, “A personalized passcode as well, if you would.” When he shoots her a questioning look, she gladly elucidates, “A security measure to maintain privacy, of course.”
“Of course not! Lord, are you daft?” He snaps, waving his arms in exasperation. “Listen, you need me to inform you whenever an ambush is conspired, and I need you to neutralize some mutual foes. It’s a win-win. You know, the whole I’ll scratch your back and you mine partnership.”
An uncomfortable pause stretches seemingly for eons, and Dean’s nearly certain he’s lost signal before his brother decides to speak again. Only, this time, with a notable waver to his voice, evidently on the verge of tears. “Right. You always are. Yeah, you—you’ll be okay.”
The stars are eventually blocked by a building, shrouded by night. An ominous sign for the darkness ahead, if he ever saw one.
The Seraph regards him with a clinical coldness that sends a shiver crawling down the extent of his spine. “That isn’t wise,” he warns lowly, eliciting a strained laugh from Dean.
The statement is hollow—trite. Halting Dean in his tracks, as he shoots his captor a leveling glare. “‘You keep using that word; I don’t think it means what you think it means.'” When he receives a perplexed look from the Alpha, Dean growls out, “Did you feed this bullshit to her, too?”
“Not really hearing the problem, Harvelle.” Dean grins, insolently, before casually resting his arm atop the steering wheel. “You eventually found me, didn’t you?”
“I’m not saying I
Dean snorts with incredulity at her seemingly innocuous intent, not fooled in the slightest by the falsity.
“I didn’t come here to talk about myself,” he mutters, uncertain how to defend against such acute perception.
“I somehow doubt that.” John’s dark, inscrutable gaze sweeps past Dean to scrutinize the kid hovering at his side; regarding him dispassionately. “He yours?”
, he decides, eyeing the three bulbs aligned over the doorframe. Particularly, the middle one emitting a soft, yellow glow.
“Most Alphas are natural stealth hunters,” Dean says at length, refocusing on the game, and finally daring a move.
“No,” the Seraph returns firmly, unyielding as the monolith he presents himself to be.
“Gladly.” A wolfish grin etches across her face. “I bet you taste
Giving a rigid salute and a playful wink, Dean acknowledges, “Aye, aye, Captain.”
The Seraph is quick to take exception to that with a low, contemplative hum. “I believe you underestimate yourself.” Reaching for a pawn, he indicates the start of the game by gliding the piece forward until it comes to rest on a black square. “You’ve honed your techniques of camouflage in order to hide in plain sight; therefore, affording you the advantage over your enemies.” Canting is head to the side, he wonders, “Would you still attribute that to happenstance?”
He groans as the stars above viciously wobble and his arm throbs intensely, alerting him to a fresh injury. Although, he suspects nothing is broken.
“You’ve been prepared and have spoken to a loved one,” the reaper states, heavily implying Dean’s apparent ungratefulness.
“Are you sure you can handle this?” she tentatively questions, brows drawing together. “Your scent has altered. It’s…” she trails off, tilting her head in puzzlement while she sniffs the air. Her Beta senses, thankfully, not nearly as keen.
—are you?”
“Your tongue,” she says, not trusting.
“Such a pretty boy,” someone purrs as he breaches the perimeter, eliciting him to whip around in search of the creep. His skin prickling as his eyes lock on her own before observing her tongue dart out to seductively lick cherry-red stained lips. Mild horror engulfing his disgust when her eyes ink over black, contrasting the fiery red of her hair which spills in loose curls over the dips in her shoulders. “You look a little cold there,
of a door slamming, followed by a gruff, “That him?” curtails him once more. Bobby’s presence adding even more weight to this moment.
The reaper, predictably, doesn’t respond to the bait and continues to shepherd him apathetically down the corridor. By the time they reach the threshold, Dean’s a mess of nerves. Tremors wrack his body and his palms sweat profusely, despite his attempts to rub them dry. Finding himself unable to bridal the fear over his potential, gruesome demise.
With his eyes burning insistently, Dean wrestles against the pull of unconsciousness—barely maintaining attention on the stretch of potentially lethal highway ahead. His view obstructed by the perpetual torrent and oppressive gloom of night; in which, the high beams scarcely cut through. The darkness bearing down with a near tangible weight; bleeding through minuscule crevices of the car and constricting around his body as though intending to suffocate him.
In her hands, she balances a silver tray supporting an array of food. The collective, familiar aromas permeating the room within seconds, and calling to him like a siren at sea.
“No? Pretty sure I’m the one with the upper hand,” Dean goads, purposely flicking his wrist to menacingly catch light on the serrated blade.
, we can’t be allies?”
“What do you—?”
, he reminds himself; recalling what limited options he’s had in regards to a career, next to his current line of work. Ultimately preferring to be the hunter rather than the hunted.
The kid frowns minutely, incredulous. “You’ve told me that before, too.”
“Yet, you are neither of those—
?” Dean scoffs. “What do I look like—a restaurant?”
A sharp rapping tugs him from the clutches of a vivid nightmare. One born from illicitly obtained photographs, consecutive months of irregular sleep, and a nightly routine involving five fingers of some cheap, bottom shelf swill. The unexpected sound all but jerking him back to consciousness while dispelling the gruesome tableau of mangled corpses littered at his feet. Their glazed over, lifeless eyes transfixed upon him as rivulets of blood inch towards him in spidery, crimson veins.
Finally, he stirs at the click of the trunk’s latch, and gasps at the onslaught of icy air as it lifts open. A violent shiver raking over him as a shadowy figure in contrast to the starry sky leans inside. Gripping one leg firmly as the other hand roughly works to free his ankles from their bindings. And then, to his dismay, are they retied loosely with what he presumes is some kind of cord.
Dean casts a weary sidelong glance at his son, finding him ostensibly apprehensive to answer; fidgeting with the cuffs of his sleeves and shifting his weight between feet. His voice subdued and quivering when after a stretch of taut silence, he tentatively replies: “Sam. Sam Winchester.”
After drifting in conscious limbo for what he believes is hours, Dean eventually resolves to clean the mess from sheer lack of anything more productive to do. And while still under the waning influence of the sedative, he finds that the normally effortless task of motion has become somewhat of an arduous one. His movements slightly clumsy while he rises from the bed. Noting, that his boots have been removed and are now missing, as he shuffles languidly on socked feet in direction of the secondary door at the opposite end of the room. Not surprised, in the least, when it leads him directly into an en suite bathroom, complete with a spacious Jacuzzi bath and strategically placed crystal bowls of potpourri; the details no less extravagant than that of the bedchamber.
“H-6 ready for entry,” the reaper says to no one in particular, maneuvering to stand beside Dean. A hand gently unexpectedly settling onto his shoulder.
Dean chuckles disconcertingly, and draws his thumb across his mouth. Pondering the risks he’s taking. “Well, this is certainly a unique way to ask for my number,” he eventually quips, reveling in the responding tic of anger. Cracks forming in the mask of her genteel veneer.
The clang of the door unbolting reverberates loudly in the silence as the bulbs simultaneously switch to green. Its hinges squealing and groaning when it commences swinging inwards, spilling a dull light across the dark expanse of the hallway. A sharp gasp escaping him as frigid air assaults him a moment later, sending a chill racing down his back as it slices mercilessly through the meager protective layer of his hoodie.
Following her line of sight, he spots the being in question fairly quickly—an angel. Despite the distance, he discerns how the angel’s eyes are ablaze with azure fire and fixed squarely upon him. The inscrutably intense stare raising the hairs at the nape of his neck.
“Okay.” He sighs resignedly. “Deal.”
“Just nerves,” he’s quick to supply, silently praying she doesn’t call him on it. “Nothing a few beers won't cure.”
Mentally shaking himself, Dean casually reaches for his drink. Clutching the glass tenaciously as though it were a lifeline, while sizing up the man standing poised in front of him; clad in an unconventional dark khaki suit and mismatched necktie. Curiously eyeing the week's worth of stubble, and hair which appears to have been combed through by fingers. Suggesting this man is either uncaring of his outer aspects or he’s prone to deceiving his enemies into believing him weak.
“Out of all the possible reactions I anticipated, I admit, this is not one I envisioned.”
He attempts to speak, but a distant
With no clock in sight, and his burner phone seized, Dean is forced to make a guess as to the length of time he’s been comatose. Judging by the lethargy and heaviness to his limbs, plus the sporadic waves of nausea, he can easily infer that it’s been a little more than a few hours. Kept under, presumably, by a sedative the Alpha likely administered subsequent to him losing consciousness. Probably, in order to prevent any further blemishes to Dean’s body with hopes of higher bids from potential buyers.
“If you do exactly what I tell you, I’ll call for one.”
“Do you want your food or not?” she’s quick to dodge; her gaze skittering away at long last. Incredibly obvious in her attempt to evade his probing stare by the way her attention bounces from object to object.
Swallowing thickly, he ventures, “What are they?”
“Give me your backside once you lie down,” she commands as he clambers into the cramped space of the Focus; curling into a semi-fetal position to fit uncomfortably, facing the interior wall. He inwardly curses himself when he flinches at cold hands collecting his wrists behind him, followed by the confinement of several zip ties pulling tight and a pair of metal handcuffs.
No, this is far beyond anything he’s ever experienced. And the possibility of succumbing to death or losing the last shreds of his humanity in the unlikely event he makes it out alive is nothing short of a daunting prospect.
The wound in Dean’s shoulder throbs in time to the rhythmic swipes of the windshield wipers. White-hot pain lancing down his left arm as he shifts his weight to ease the cramping in his legs, and grits his teeth at the inordinately loud groan of leather that results from the motion. Hoping, the sound doesn’t rouse the small, slumbering form curled in a ball on the seat beside him.
“Even after your…
Yet, there comes no response, except motion he catches in his peripherals—a dark mass lingering with a silent promise for further harm. Muffled words he isn’t able to distinguish feathering into his ear from some far off distance.
Dean huffs at that, shaking his head in disbelief. “A guy needs at least four hours every once in a while, you know.”
“Then, go back to wherever it is you came from!”
“I have twice the buy in for your tournament,” Dean presses, not daring to lay all his cards on the table just yet.
,” Mary snarls, weight on his chest pinning him as she stretches to fasten the last with bruising force; causing Dean to jerk violently and bite down on his gag to bear it.
Dean thinks as he spies the pills, understanding her intention of restraining him first to prevent an opportunity to hide them on his person.
“Actually, that’s exactly what it means,” Dean retorts hotly. “In the end, only one species can be named winner—”
Dean strives to swallow past the panic forming like a lead ball in his throat. Distraught, as he struggles to keep tabs on his opponent’s moves; the Alpha swiftly advancing on his glass army.
Dean stands frozen, staring mutely down at Cas’ unmoving body. Observing the vicious red consuming the material over his chest inch by devastating inch. The only color Dean’s aware of as the world fades into varying shades of grey. A sharp ringing drowning out noise, save for the pounding of his pulse and his shallow, raspy respires.
Again, Dean’s breath catches in his throat. “You’re the Seraph.”
Dean’s feet are suddenly moving, guiding him to pace the floor, as he stuffs his hands deep into the pockets of his faded denims. Shaking his head at the ridiculousness of it all, he concludes, “So, I can’t make any decisions like you claim.”
“Aren’t reapers supposed to console those marked by Death?” Dean starts peevishly, sparing a glance over his shoulder at the reaper while he grudgingly obliges. His pulse drumming against his ears as the distance between them and the door diminishes rapidly beneath the hard soles of his boots.
“And go where?” Dean returns with a tinge of desperation. Unsure as to the reason he’s still bothering when their unwelcome is so clearly perceived.
“Tell that to all the history buffs,” Dean counters, quelling the urge to squirm uncomfortably. “Besides, luck’s really the only thing I’ve got going for me.”
With the fog of disorientation steadily lifting, Dean commences taking stock of his situation. Discovering himself alone in a room, of which its design closely resembles the one where he’d lost to the smug Alpha. The only differences being the bedroom furnishings that have taken place of the table, and the sheer, golden draperies covering the expanse of a window that hardly conceals him from the outside world. Offering an illusion of freedom, while shadowy outlines of iron bars bleeding through the fabric serve to solidify his prisoner status.
Dean is almost willing to bet the latter.
The Seraph’s expression incrementally darkens, his head inclining and nostrils flaring. “It’s rather subtle. I couldn’t distinguish it while surrounded by my guests, but faux hormones have a distinct musk—a chemical perfume that’s nearly identical to cleaning products. Especially, those sold on the black market.”
Dean studies the contents of the meal when he kneels to collect the largest pieces from the floor to place onto the tray; pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausage—everything essential for breakfast. The realization prompting him to inspect the curtains again to observe the degree of light behind them having increased since the last time he checked.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m going!” he bites back, relieved to regain his temper. “No need to be so damn pushy. Don’t I deserve to go out with a little dignity?”
Dean is unceremoniously wrenched from his musings by the ominous noise of a heavy bolt sliding free, heralding someone’s arrival. The polite knock that sounds merely seconds afterwards taking Dean by complete surprise—having expected a more malevolent greeting rather than one of courtesy, all things considered. And noting how a delicate silence descends when he doesn’t immediately make to acknowledge it, as though the person on the other side is debating if he’s regained enough of his sensibilities to be capable. Which is, to say the least, exceedingly peculiar, given the fact he should be thoroughly stripped of any free will by this point.
“What?” The demon questions, feigning offense. “Because I’m not
“Please, forgive my confusion,” she continues at length, an unsettling edge to her tone. “The identification you presented upon check in does not match the name under your reservation.” Popping open the case, her analyzing gaze seeks him once more with a notable, predatory gleam—a shark scenting blood in the water. “Although the hotel has no policy against the use of aliases, it’s insisted upon to ask your preference to properly address you.”
Eagerly, Dean dials the number from memory, his heart rate spiking as he raises the cellphone to his ear. Hoping with every fiber of his being that someone’s home to receive the call.
Jo’s gaze remains steadfast on him for another protracted minute—disquietly contemplative. Then, as though coming to some internal decision, she hefts the case from the floor, and drops it unceremoniously onto the empty space of bench dividing them. Her recently manicured fingers typing in the code to release the locks before flipping the lid open to reveal a multitude of large bills, all bound and placed in neatly stacked rows. The very sight of the substantial sum eliciting a low, appreciative whistle from between Dean’s lips as he bends closer to better inspect it.
“Isn’t Nyquil a little overboard?” Dean tries, desperately hoping she’ll leave it at that. “I took the pills.”
“Don’t,” Dean blurts as the fragments of his disjointed reality snap sharply into place. Colors exploding, the rush of cars on the freeway deafening, and the keen awareness of the person beside him sending chills along his spine. “Please, don’t.”
Dean licks at his dried lips with incredulity. “And I’m supposed to trust you? Just like that?”
It’s a flurry of activity as soon as he steps inside; socialites of all sexes traversing the floor in elegant evening attire. All too wrapped up in their vices to notice the outlier maneuvering past them in direction of the bar, where Dean is thankful to discover it virtually deserted. The Bartender keeping busy regardless of the lapse in patrons.
Dean grimaces, then juts out his chin in a semblance of bravado as he retorts, “Bite me.”
“So, you thought you’d come here,” John rebuffs, visibly irritable, and steps further out the door; permitting it to bang menacingly against its metal framing.
For those who have anxiety over potential character deaths, I promise Cas isn't dead.
“Fuck the cold,” Dean gripes under his breath, dipping his head against the tempest wind. A wall of flurries and sleet obstructing his vision as he treks farther along, carving a path through ankle-deep snow and rugged terrain. Cursing the Fates and Death for this so-called “preventative measure of the Apocalypse” when the toe of his boot catches a jutting of rock, forcing him off-balance and acquainting him with the nearest snowdrift.
The kid stubbornly shakes his head, unwilling to surrender the negotiations. “Do we have pancakes?”
Dean snorts, mistrustful. “Yeah, and what about a weapon?”
Dean thinks somberly.
“He was Azazel’s accountant; it was all necessary to track that son of a bitch down. I couldn’t just let the one lead I had vanish, now could I?” Dean pauses in his justification, tongue darting out to lick habitually at his bottom lip. “You guys solely hire me to hunt these monsters and kill them. What I do and how I do it should be irrelevant, given I ultimately complete the damn job.
“Apparently, I was mistaken,” the man finishes, effectively breaking Dean’s captivation and drawing his gaze down to the relaxed curve of his lips.
A look of consideration crosses the Seraph’s face; his head canting a fraction to the side, pinning Dean beneath his scrutiny. The Alpha seemingly endeavoring to pierce through his outer shell to the soft, vulnerable layer of his core. “As long as I accompany you.”
“You may as well concede the match,” the Seraph says; the rumble of his chair as he pulls it from the table reverberating off the walls of the room.
Dean’s hand falters over his own pawn, his mind whirring with the jarring implications. Resolutely keeping his eyes trained on the checkered pattern, so as not to give away the consternation overcoming him.
“Nah. It’s just—” He gestures weakly to the board. “Not what I expected.”
“What—no last name?” Dean tries, feeling ill at ease by the shroud of secrecy overhanging them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he asks dumbly, immensely perturbed by the intense scrutiny.
“I like to arrive fashionably late,” Dean starts, nonchalantly, before throwing back the rich, amber liquid; relishing the potent burn as it travels down his throat. “You know, etiquette and all that.”
Emitting a noise of exasperation, Dean folds his arms over his chest, and casually quips, “To tell someone about the BM I had yesterday.” Then, “What’s it to you?”
John exhales audibly, pointedly ignoring Dean as he’s done countless times in his youth. “What’s your name, kid?”
“How’s this?” Dean propositions, “We’ll see about having pancakes once we’re at your Uncle Bobby’s, but only if you eat the sandwich now. Deal?”
Sensing no other options in the matter, he curtly nods his comprehension, and bends over the table to punch in the sequence—thankful to have made the deposit prior to the bank closing for the day. “Making fools of us all?”
Dean chuckles softly; deeply amused by his meager efforts to keep him at bay. “We’re right at the city limits. Shouldn’t be more than another thirty or forty minutes.”
“Forgive me,” the Alpha says flatly before decidedly encroaching on Dean’s personal space. Instantly setting Dean on edge when he seemingly looms over him, despite their similar heights. “I believe my social skills have become a bit rusty recently.”
John’s hackles rise instantly at the audacity of his request, much to Dean’s dismay. Confirming, how his meager hopes for a positive reunion has simply been nothing more than a pipe dream.
“Anywhere but here.” Pointing to some distant place just past Dean’s left shoulder, he states, “There’s some cheap motels in town.”
“Same difference,” he fires back, pivoting a degree to flag down the bartender for a second round—instinctively not presenting his backside to the predator.
“I suppose,” she grudgingly concedes, then gracefully spins the case to face him; a small number pad and miniature screen its only contents.
“Excuse me?”
Dean muses somberly, gripping the steering wheel tenaciously until his knuckles blanch from the strain.
“Campbell.” Grasping his own drink in hopes to ease the sudden dryness in his mouth, he states, “Dean Campbell. And I’m not interested.”
At that, startling blue eyes seek him again. The Seraph’s gaze absolutely glacial, his expression thunderous. “It was necessary. You weren’t complying with the terms of the deal.”
“If you don’t move in the next three seconds—”
“I’m not playing this game with you,” comes Mary’s predictable scolding. “If you’re going to act like a child, then I’ll treat you like one.”
He will not beg.
She continues the punishing exercise for another minute, then slumps over to catch her breath with hands on her hips. Her cheeks flamed pink from the exertion.
“No,” comes the expected reply. “I can’t allow you to do that,” he intones, brooking no room for argument.
“No, you have freedom.”
At Dean’s visible bemusement, she explains, “I’m a Larper.” She shrugs, again. “It’s a lifestyle. And right now, it’s pretty much the only thing keeping me from losing it.”
His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
Shaking his head, he refocuses on the task at hand. Scrubbing vigorously to remove the syrup embedded in the fibers, while purposely disregarding the distinct slide of the deadbolt. Already aware of the person’s identity, even before an overwhelming scent of cinnamon spice pervades the air. Feeling the vibrations of footfalls beneath his palm upon their silent approach, until they’re close enough for him to discern the soft brushing of shoes against the carpeting.
As the doors swing inwards, Dean is struck by a remarkable flood of Alpha pheromones. The oppressive scent of thunderstorms threatening to overwhelm, as an electric charge diffuses the air. Whoever it is, evidently, inclined to making grand entrances, while flaunting tacit power to exert superiority. Their affluence seemingly enough of a reason to refresh his memory of society's pecking order, despite the fact he's also loaded; at least, for the moment.
interaction,” she adds as an afterthought, offering him a look of commiseration.
“Are we almost there?” he grumbles in reply, digging his profile into the leather seat, and raising his arms over his head as a barrier against any further unsolicited affection.
Charlie shrugs noncommittally, then pinwheels her arms to reinitiate blood flow. “It has a nice ring to it and makes me feel like I’m on some sort of top-secret mission.”
An unbidden growl of protest escapes Dean at that. “Alone.”
“And who says I need you for that?” Dean scoffs.
The long-suffering groan he receives is like music to his ears.
After shutting the lid and latching the case, she affords him an indulgent smirk. Flashing an incredibly perfect set of teeth. “Naomi.”
“I don’t wish to harm you, otherwise.”
"I think this is exactly how I pictured your bedroom." He moved to lay beside Dean, looking up at ceiling, where Dean had some of those little plastic glow in the dark stars. "Less porn than I thought."
“A while. Sam asked me if I was gonna ask a couple of weeks ago, and I.. kinda chickened out each time I thought to ask.” He chuckled. Castiel kissed his lips gently, barely even applying enough pressure for it to be a kiss.
Castiel pulled away only when he absolutely had to, resting his chin on Dean's shoulder for a moment just for a cuddle. "I could go back to be?" He suggested. "Or... we can just eat here and do presents. I'm excited about presents."
"Yeah, no, I know I'm smokin' hot."  Dean grinned, not close to joking. The mans ego was far, far too large for his own good. Castiel found the confidence extremely attractive. "M'just wondering if I'm so distracting, why you've never kissed me?"
Clearly, he was, because the next moment, Dean was removing the half eaten slice of pizza from Castiel's hand, and shuffling closer to him. Castiel stayed frozen, watching Dean carefully. Dean's eyes flicked from Castiel's down to his lips, licking his lower lip as he leaned into him, and then they were kissing.
Dean and Castiel had met in the last year of highschool, when Castiel's family moved to Lawrence, hitting it off almost instantly, soon realising it was more than just a friendship between them. Dean spent weeks flirting with him, which of course Castiel was too stupid to catch onto, and in the end Dean had just pulled him into a kiss while he'd been in the middle of studying, and they hadn't looked back since. They followed each other to the same college, Castiel eventually opening his very own bakery (cleverly named Angel Cakes) once he'd saved enough up to do so, while Dean had taken over Singers Salvage  Yard, turning it more into a repair shop than a self-service place. Both of them were more than happy with where they're at right then. Especially after they'd finally bit the bullet, and started looking for their first proper home.
Dean ran his hand up and down Castiel's arm slowly, sometimes tracing little patterns before he spoke again. He felt good about them, really, really good. " Y'know I don't say it all that often, Cas, but you... I mean, I really am /in/ love with you. Wouldn't ever want anyone else." He smiled to himself, looking down at the head of messy hair leaning on his chest, and ran his hand through it. "You mean a hell of a lot to me."
“Give you a lift?”
Sam let out a quiet laugh form his place next to the Nephilim.  “Not quite.”
standing in front of him making this offer.   This was something that Dean suggested and
The dots danced for a minute or two.
“You may.” Castiel answered taking a step away from the boy and his presents.  The three older men watched Jack tear into exactly one of his gifts before ripping into their own.
“I doubt the man can read.”  Dean fell back on his bed and the next time he spoke, he sounded very tired.  “What are the odds of this being mistaken identity instead of some messed up supernatural bullshit?  Because if there is some shifter or witch using my face to attack women...goddammit.”
“You have to wake up Dean.  You have to wake up and live.  Find someone else with big blue eyes and messy hair.”
Castiel sighed.  “What do you
“No!,” Dean sounded scanalized as he opened the Impala’s door loudly.  “
“That’s good to know.”  There was an indefinite commotion on Dean’s end of the phone.
Dean threw up his hands in helpless submission.
Sam showered, changed, and put a small bag together while Dean set up his computer at the room’s requisite rickety mini-table and chairs and nursed an oversized mug of what Sam hoped was bad coffee.
Sam fidgeted with the paper behind his back.  “Yeah, sure, just let me finish this note.”
Dean took a moment to clumsily futz with a box of prophylactics and slide one over his penis, but recovered his confidence as he lay back on the bed, feet on the ground, motioning Melanie to him.  Melanie released Castiel so that she could crawl on to the bed, plant a few kisses on Dean’s torso, turn around and slide herself onto Dean’s covered erection, while also facing Castiel.  She pulled Castiel right to the edge of the bed so that she could touch him while also rocking against Dean and Castiel found himself also between Dean’s legs where they extended off the bed.
It was easy for Dean to forget that beneath Jimmie’s insurance agent exterior, Cas was a truly ancient being who had spent hundreds of thousands of years, more even, wandering and watching the Earth and its inhabitants.  At this moment though, with the bunker’s soft lighting accenting the contours of his face and bringing out the confused emotions trapped inside of his eyes, Cas looked so far beyond anything, anyone Dean could ever begin to comprehend that Dean knew he had to spend the rest of his life delving beneath the surface.  Dean swallowed the rest of his drink, but didn’t take his eyes off of the honest-to-God angel at his side.
Castiel testily struggled a hand underneath all of his layers to adjust his erection before hitting the play button again.  When his hand made that brief contact with the shaft of his penis and his thumb grazed its head, the angel felt a jolt of something akin to electricity surge through his human form.  It left him doubled over and gasping.  He removed his hand, but remained doubled as the rest of the video played and the two men finished messily.
“Uhm,” Cas wasn’t sure which article of clothing to struggle with first.
The angel blinked and ruffled his hair to clear his head after that video.  Sex was a natural human process that he chose to abstain from, but his vessel was still totally, annoyingly, human with all the human reactions that entails.  He stared at his flushed hands until the color returned to normal and then he remembered the rest of the post-it-note.  He fished his phone out of his coat pocket and pressed his first speed dial key.
“Man, the things you’ve seen.  I want to hear about it.  What was it like?”
Sam broke out into one of his full-body smiles.  “Why don’t we each open a present?”
“Oh, I remember Sammy.  I spent the first couple of years trying to keep both of us from getting smited for some damn reason or another.  He was the holy douchebag, judging us, spying on us, and ruining everything he touched.”  Dean shook his head and began to walk again.  “He’s still ruining everything he touches.  He hasn’t learned anything.”
Chapter two went a bit longer than I expected.  I decided adding third chapter was better than cramming it all together.
Dean nodded, unable to decipher the angel’s expressions.  “You okay?”
Castiel couldn’t catch an even breath.  “Oh God!”
“Hello?” Castiel called out to anyone who might be in the bunker out of habit.  Hearing no reply, he carried his large canvas bag of supplies into the library.  He saw Dean’s closed laptop resting on the library table with a post-it-note on top that he couldn’t quite read from where he was standing.  With a smile, Castiel effortlessly eased his overstuffed bag to the floor and ran his hands over his coat sleeve, wiping away an intrusive splotch of blood before retrieving the note.
“That…would be nice. I – “ Cas was interrupted by being suddenly, but gently pushed against the wall.  The first thing his mind processed was the cold tile against the back of his head, but then he became aware of the warmth from Dean’s lips pressing against his own. They were surprisingly soft and tasted of spice and berries.  Cas saw that Dean’s eyes were closed tightly and there was a blush on his cheeks.  He was beautiful. Cas sank into the kiss and consciously tried push radiantly happy feelings into Dean.
As the door closed, Castiel noticed the minimized web browser on Dean’s taskbar.  He brought up the tab that turned out to be a webpage with a jarring yellow background with a fat, red, problematic, faux oriental font.  The words Free Trial lay over several embedded video elements.
It was Dean who suggested the Christmas dinner, on Christmas of course.  It was Sam who suggested that maybe a small dinner while they wait for Garth to infiltrate Michael’s forces would make the waiting easier.  Jack and Castiel agreed.  Jack wasn’t familiar with big family dinners and somehow it was decided that each man should focus on one dish.  Dean would of course, under threat of certain death, be the only one to handle the preparation for a turkey.  Sam opted for some over complicated frou-frou vegetable medley and Cas, after some days of thinking, volunteered to make a “drink I tried once at this one place”.  Jack discovered the wild world of Jell-O molding at Thanksgiving, so that would be his contribution.
Cas’s eyes blurred with tears and he smiled weakly.  He chewed, his lower lip, trying to formulate words.  Dean ran his thumb against Cas’s bottom lip, rubbing away Cas’s chewing.  It was soft, but cold like the rest of this place.
Continuing from the last chapter, Cas found the explicit video Dean left for him.  Dean was Dean and Castiel was pissed.
Dean shook a few more into his palm, not counting them.  He’d have to have a talk with Garth in the morning about their efficacy and his tolerance.  Dean swallowed the fist of pills and lay on his pillow so that he could watch the clock and count the minutes pass.
“How?”
Castiel nodded.  “I did completely reform his body and soul after pulling him from hell.”
Sam raised an eyebrow, that was a long pause for such a short sentence.
“You know, like close buds -"
Castiel looked deeply into Melanie’s eyes and noticed small, glowing flakes of glitter in her eye make up.  It did very little to hide the growing blush of her skin.  He stroked her cheek, touching a bit of smeared lipstick near her mouth.  As he did so, it was like a bucket of ice water suddenly washed over him, snapping him out of a stupor.  On the list of infinite “Thou Shalt Nots” Angels have to follow, laying with humans and any risk at all of the creation of a Nephalim was pretty much the cardinal Shalt Not.  Castiel knew he was already an abomination because of his lust and past mistakes, but this one was the rule he could not risk.
Sam’s eyes caught Dean’s and he pleadingly pointed his head towards the library.  Dean smiled and nodded.
That thought appeared to end abruptly.  “Tell me you’re sorry about what, Cas?”, Sam flipped to the next page, which seemed to be completely unrelated and also very disorganized.  He flipped back to the page he’d been reading, but started from the top of the page.
Sam sighed and shook his head.  “We should leave, Dean.  There were at least a dozen people in that greasy burger yesterday and we don’t know how early our hotel manager reads the paper.”
“Is your brother embarrassed by me?”
Castiel flapped the pockets of his oversized coat helplessly. “I do here.  All the time.  How long has it been?”
“Melanie’s been waiting,” Dean explained for Cas’s benefit.
Nine.  That was how many times Dean replayed the same tired Zeppelin album on his worn out cassette in his crappy, archaic tape deck.  Nine.  Sam did attempt to drown out the grating, static filled cacophony with his own music, but Dean glared at him until he took his airpods out.  Sam slumped against the passenger door and bumped his head against the glass.  This was meant to be a thirteen hour road trip and Sam used up both of his rest stop requests three hours in.  His phone was about to die and he hadn’t had time to pack the right charger for his laptop or tablet.
“You don’t eat dandelions, Sammy, you murder them with a lawnmower,” Dean chided Sam with a smile before snatching a dandelion to munch and instantly regretting it.
“You and me both,” Sam agreed, replacing his phone in his pocket and absentmindedly tapping Cas’s papers on the table.
“Okay? Well, okay then,” Dean smiled and began walking.  When he didn’t hear Cas’s steps following him, he turned around to see Cas motionless and wide-eyed, perched on the car’s hood.  “C’mon, you,” Dean grabbed Cas by the sleeve and steered them both to the unlit stairway.
Melanie shifted her posture and adjusted her warm, firm grip on him.  She looked up at him and Castiel realized she was asking if it was okay if she did to him what she’d just done to Dean.  Castiel couldn’t form words, but nodded as he frantically pulled off his tie with one hand and undid his top button with the other, desperate to find more oxygen in the room.  Melanie dropped her head and, starting from the bottom of his length, slowly dragged her tongue upwards to the very top.
“Me neither.”  Dean punched the mattress with his left fist.
After a few hotswaps of the hotel’s cramped bathroom, Dean and Cas found themselves, again, outside the hotel room’s door.  Melanie shuffled through a bag and handed Dean a small, small grey box.
“Thanks,” Cas was both embarrassed and appreciative. “One question, Sam?”
“Later tonight...oh! Hey, Melanie! Uhh, better make that tomorrow.  Late tomorrow.”
Dean felt his head shake involuntarily.
“Not your papers, not your business,” Sam spoke to himself, gripping the steering wheel and focusing on the door to the apartment building.  He stared at the big nothing that was happening in front of him for about five seconds before giving up and retrieving the paper.  “You’re a trash human being, Sam Winchester,” the man told himself as he unfolded the packet, searching for the part with his name all over it.  It appeared to be in a really rough patch of text with lots of words scratched out, underlined, and arrows indicating lines to other thoughts.
Dean took a few steps towards Cas and the battle hardened angel gulped reflexively.  Dean made a point of staring predatorily at his friend as Dean kicked off his boots, taking his socks off at the same time.  Eager to hide from Dean’s eyes, Castiel’s eyes found themselves on Dean’s hands, which Dean was using to make a proper show of breaking open his belt buckle and sliding the belt from the loops in his waistband.  Dean set the belt aside on the nightstand with a coy wink.
Oh.  Sam’s stomach dropped.
Dean blushed involuntarily under Cas’s gaze.
“Don’t listen to her,” Dean was clearly joking and spoke to the writhing woman, “she can go for hours like that.”  That elicited a frustrated groan from the woman.
Cas cocked his head to the side, inquisitively.  “Did you just get paid for sex?”
Cas narrowed his eyes and Sam threw up his hands in the universal sign of surrender.  “Just an expression, Cas.”
Cas nodded. “Oh yes. It just so happened that the village was having a winter festival.  They welcomed me.  I sat in the chapel with them.  The village religious leader was extremely…charismatic.  Then there was a huge feast with music and dancing and lots of, well, this,” Cas sloshed the beverage in his cup for emphasis. “That night the whole village smelled like cloves and berries.  Everything was too loud and too bright.  But, I stayed as long as I could and watched them dance and laugh out in the snow.”
Soon enough each man had a plate and found their typical spots at the small, four-person kitchen table that sat against a tiled wall.
“I feel like I forgot something.”  He patted his pockets and found Baby’s keys.  Dean tilted his head, uncertain.  “Oh well,” he finally shrugged.
The younger Winchester started his standard news trawler, plugged in his AirPods and flicked to Netflix, reminding himself that he is not responsible for fixing whatever Dean and / or Cas have broken.  Sam fell asleep right before the intro for Always Sunny started.
“So, what’s up?”  Sam entreated.
“Alright, there you go, buddy.”  Dean directed the golden haired dog to his bed in the corner with a point and a snap.  The dog cheerfully did as he was told.  He always did.  Winchester sighed heavily and gripped the edge of his bed tightly, until his hands turned white and began to tremble.  This was the hardest part.  The quiet part of the night, when there was nothing else to say or do and no way to distract himself from the empty inside.  He sighed and dropped to his knees on the floor, planted his elbow on his bed, and clasped his hands tightly.
Winchester waited a time, straining his ears for any sound and trying to feel outwards to that ambiguous point in the ether where he could always find Cas if he wanted to.  Not Cas exactly, but his presence, his being, his constant reassurance that he existed on some plain and that he had not abandoned Dean, no matter how much of an asshole he was.  On his best days, Dean liked to think that he could actually feel a little of what Cas was feeling, even if Cas was feeling angry, or let down again, or confused.  On his worst days, Dean knew that Cas was there, ageless and watching.  Today, there was nothing.  There had been nothing for 360 hours.  There will be nothing tomorrow.  Dean felt profoundly alone after 12 years of being on an emotional tether.
Castiel was just confused.  He raised his hands in surrender and slowly backed out of the doorway.  “Good night, Dean.”
“Exactly.”  Dean folded his arms triumphantly, beaming confidence and victory.
“Betty,” Sam emphasized the woman’s name, “Can pick me out of a line up as easily as she can pick you.  If I run around town flashing a fake badge and trying to get evidence, she could find out and then we’d both be screwed.  We don’t know this is our kinda thing, it doesn’t have to be.  Like you said, it could be some awful coincidence.”
"How’s the research, Sammy?  Find anything...worth anything?”
He rushed and wrapped his arms tightly around the Angel, smiling at the air moving in Cas’s lungs and the beat of Cas’s heart that Dean could feel through in his own chest.  Castiel reciprocated the hug and pressed Dean’s head against his shoulder, touching their cheeks together.  Dean didn’t want to let go, but eventually Cas did, so Dean was forced to take a few steps back and his feet made no noise.
“You’ll figure it out.  Melanie’s, uh, she’s kinda urgently waiting upstairs, so I’m headed up.  Are you comin’?”  Baby creaked and bounced as Dean stood up.
“So.”  Cas answered.
“Good, good,” Dean nodded.
This time it was Castiel who couldn’t entirely stifle a laugh at Dean’s sudden, obvious embarrassment and loss of words.  Melanie shot him a warning glance that he took very seriously and wiped the smile from his face.
Dean raised an eyebrow at Cas and made a point of scanning him up and down.  “He might have even more stamina than I do.”
Cas rose from the table and gently pushed passed Dean to go to the stove to retrieve his bubbling brew.
Sam pulled his eyes towards the cash register, seeing his brother making a joke to the woman behind the counter.  She covered her mouth shyly as she laughed.  Sam knew where this was heading.  Castiel suddenly seemed much more sagacious than Sam had ever given him credit for.  Sam decided to head back to the hotel on his own.
“Ok, fine, we’ll just be smart about this.  The cops can’t know about the Impala.  I’ll head over to Betty’s place and see what I can see from the outside, right?  If I don’t see anything weird, we assume it was just bad timing.  You...wait here, call the office for another night and, uh, I’ll bring food.  Sound good?”
Dean shivered and took a sip of his drink.  He wasn’t able to sit down comfortably for weeks afterwards.  Dean’s reminiscence paused as he noticed the drink in his mouth.  It was a berry wine, but thicker and tasted like cloves, ginger, and a few other things Dean couldn’t identify.  It tasted…old.  Certainly not something that would be popular today, but it was very good.
Before Cas found the stairs, he heard a slow, quiet “Hey Cas” from the shadow surrounding the right side of the building.
The quiet was too loud and too painful.  Dean sat up, reached into his bedside drawer, and rummaged for the largest of the pill bottles.  He unceremoniously popped the lid and shook a few into his palm.
“Always a pleasure,” Dean drawled and shared a meaningful look with Melanie before leading Cas down the unsafely dark hotel stairs.  The men crossed the parking lot quietly and Dean stopped next to the Impala’s driver side door.  He eyed Cas as Cas walked past the passenger door.
Cas smiled, sleepily.  “I’ve always loved you.  Not feeling it sooner was...hell.  Wake up, Dean. Live.”
All Cas heard in reply was one thick, easy laugh.
“Yeah, sure man.  What’s up?”
“At the hotel, where I’m hiding from the police”, Dean spoke in faux happiness.
The room was silent except for Melanie’s toy, her rocking, and the working of her mouth, which Cas was watching intently.  Melanie was very beautiful, he decided, particularly the shape of her lips and the brightness in her eyes. Castiel was almost startled when Dean first let out a soft sigh and then a second, sharper one.  Dean tapped Melanie on the shoulders and she wordlessly released him and scooted back on the bed.
“Hmm.  I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
Searching for change, Sam’s fingers found the creased edges of Cas’s paper in his front pocket.  “Shit!”.  Sam pulled out the pages, angry with himself that he’d forgotten about them.
“Good?  Good!,” Dean nodded.  “Ok, we’ll be back.”
“I never knew, Castiel.  You believe me, right?  I never knew that you felt how you felt.  I always thought, you’d say things or do things that made me wonder, if you really knew what you were saying.  If I’d known, I’d have told you, absolutely, that I love you too.”
“No, Dean, it’s not good.  You’re not good.  You and Cas aren’t good -” Sam watched as his brother dipped his head and grimaced - “When you guys aren’t good, I’m not good.  No one is good here, Dean.”  Sam was surprised by his own level of annoyance.  That felt good.
Dean pulled the Impala into a cracked, uneven roadside motel parking lot about twenty minutes later and Sam sprang from the door, bag in hand, before the car was even fully stopped.  The sound of a domestic argument ringing from one of the hotel rooms was like an angelic choir to Sam’s ears, relative to yet another playthrough of Swan Song.  Sam spotted the hotel’s requisite shitty coke machine and made a sprint for it.  He didn’t normally like soda, but drinking one...or two would give Dean enough time to turn the car off and find them a room.
to do with him.  Suddenly his reticence seemed unnecessary.  “Okay.”
Cas just settled his eyes on the slow traffic at the intersections designated by Dean and Sam when Dean popped his head back through the now half closed hotel door.  His eyes were wide and his face flushed.  “Uh, everything ok in here?  Computer working ok?”
just got paid for sex.”
Annoyed with himself more than Dean at this point, Sam uncomfortably reached to his back pocket and slid out the paper with one hand and grasped his phone with the other, attempting to compose an adequately apologetic message in his head.  He tapped the edge of the pages on his forehead in frustration.
“Better luck next time?”  The woman smiled apologetically and set off around the curb.
“Something wrong?”
Dean looked at Sam’s plate with approval, his brother had taken twice as much turkey as the other men at the table and then he met his brother’s hazel eyes.  “It was usually just me and Sam doing what we could with what we had.  When dad was around, we didn’t even do that much.”
Dean nodded slowly again.  “Look, don’t worry about Cas, Cas is...Cas.”
Jack dutifully began doling out gifts into separate stacks.  Apparently, opening one gift each was no longer the plan.
“I regret a great many things about my time in your life.  I don’t regret saving your life nor do I regret telling you how I feel.  I’m sorry that, in doing so, I hurt you...again.” Cas’s features dropped.
Cas caught some movement over Melanie’s shoulder and saw that Dean was sitting stiffly on the edge of the bed, but had taken himself in hand. He was stroking himself rhythmically in time with Melanie’s head.  This made Cas even more flushed - when had it become okay to watch Dean do that?  When had any of this become okay?  Castiel felt his entire body tense up, starting from his erection.
“Sounds beautiful,” Dean’s tone was mocking, but he reached out to grip Castiel’s shoulder affectionately.
“It never seemed important or appropriate.”
Dean nodded again.  “Yeah, why not?  A night at a shitty motel with shitty cable tv doesn’t sound like the worst thing in the world right now.  Unless you want to keep goin’?”
“I vote for fire.  I’m not in the mood to have a heart to heart with a reanimated corpse.”
Castiel felt his body react to both the image on the computer and the stolen memory of Amelia, pink and glowing, begging imperatives - “Just like that!” “Right there!” - and her final, soft gasp.  He felt a flush all over and heat was redirected to his slacks.
“Are you drunk?” Cas asked, suspicious of his friend’s appearance.
It took a few seconds for Dean to cotton onto what was happening. “No, Cas, please don’t dream about that.  We understood and were just assholes takin’ it out on you.”
Dean felt that like a kick to his gut.  “How is this possible.  Are you alive?”
“It was…intoxicating,” Cas was saying, he’d turned his eyes to Deans.  “This,” Cas tapped his metal cup, “is what I think of when I think of Christmas.”
Cas nodded, Dean had a few regular dalliances at this bar.  The building had a giant cowboy hat on the roof. “Don’t worry about it.  I do want to talk to you - about that video, but in person.” Cas suddenly felt a knot in his throat at the thought of discussing free internet porn videos with Dean.  “Is that ok?  When are you home?”
Sam scrubbed the palms of his hands against his eyes in frustration. “No.”
“Busty Asian Beauties?” Cas narrowed his eyes towards the door before sighing and closing out the tab.  “At least he doesn’t pay for it.”
“Wait, angel Anna?” Sam was frustrated that he lost his place on the page, but that was just enough time for it to click that Sam had seen Dean exiting the apartment.  “Dean?” Sam looked at the building and down to the pages a few times before he threw down the pages reluctantly and sprang from the car and ran toward the apartment entrance.
“Yes, Cas.  Correct. Him.”  Sam eyed Castiel down for emphasis.  “I’m sure that an Angel of the Lord has ways to make puny, misleading mortals understand the truth of things.”
“It’s the whole thing with mom and with Jack and Cas.  You know.  He knew better.”
Melanie managed a small laugh.  She spoke with something of a whine, “Yes, I have.  Come on, Dean.”
“Look, you know I know what you’re doing when you close your computer like that, right?”, Cas asked Dean, one night, from the doorway to Dean’s brick and white tiled bedroom.
“Yeah, hey man.”  Dean emerged from the shadows, from a spot that Cas could now clearly identify as the stairwell he was seeking.  Dean’s face was flushed and his eyes were red.  Dean was uncharacteristically undressed, wearing only a t-shirt and jeans and he was in clear need of a comb.
Dean stared at the image and gulped. “That’s concerning.”
“Alright,” Dean turned his key to unlock the door.
“I bet that’s it then,” Sam nodded.  “What’s that like, anyway?”
When Dean pulled away, it was with a laugh and a swear.  “Damn.  I’m sorry.  You said that would be nice and I thought ‘I know what would be nice’ and I just…”
Castiel nodded sadly, clutching his coat tightly to his frame.
“You know man, I think it’s a good thing you’re already here.”  Without moving his hands, Dean leaned in and pressed his lips against Castiel’s. Dean felt Cas’s cold tears drip against his face, but Dean didn’t release Cas until some of Dean’s warmth was left in his lips.
“I let myself love, ok?”, Sam lied aloud to the pages, turning them to unsuccessfully try and decipher some writing along the margins. “You’re welcome by the way.  I’m glad you found me such an educational failure of a human being.”
Cas smiled sadly.  “You know it is.”
“No.  Why?”
Sam flipped through a page or two when he heard heavy boots approaching the door.  He’d just been able to fold the paper together in the palm of his hand, hidden behind his back when Dean made it to the doorway.  Dean popped his head in the room and looked around.
“They were trying to save us!”, Sam interjected.
Dean winked and grabbed his and Sam’s garbage as he rose from the booth.
Sam groaned internally, it was going to be one of THOSE conversations.  “The research is uh, going well.  Cas is helping a lot.”
The woman’s expression changed to one of absolute ecstasy and a peace Castiel had never witnessed any human achieve.  It became obvious she had not been in distress, but experiencing a genuine sort of transcendent event.  Cas set the video back and watched that moment again - the arch, the gasp, the sob, and the smile.  He watched that moment multiple times, focusing on a different feature each time, her eyelids, her hair, her trembling lips, and the smiles of the attractive men inside of her.
Sam raised his hand to interrupt and remind Dean that he can, in fact, smite demons with his mind and shit, but Dean wouldn’t let him get a word out.  “You and I have been victims of Cas and his kin for over 10 years now.  Now there’s Jack.  I am sick of it, Sammy.  Losing mom again, man, that was it.  I’m done.”
“Oh, that’s not worrying at all,” Sam spoke to the phone.  He thought for a minute before slowly typing
A thin, blonde, naked woman lay on a bed and she was artistically backlit by an open window..  She had her back arched outward from the bed.  One hand held both of her ample breasts and the other was tucked between her legs.  The woman’s mouth hung open and  her eyes were half-closed.  She looked radiant and happy.  Despite Castiel’s own limited sexual experience, he knew he was looking at the photo of the moment of the height of this woman’s orgasm.
"Mm. You're welcome to come with whenever, Cas. I miss you when I'm here and you're back there." He admitted, as if it wasn't completely obvious by how much he called and texted. It still made Castiel smile all soft.
“Hey yourself.” Dean said into his skin, Cas was able to feel his smile against his shoulder. “I’ve been thinking.”
Dean's smile faltered, and he leaned over to kiss him. "Gabriel can visit soon, and your parents can fuck themselves. Pretty sure Mom's already printing adoption papers in there. Might make our whole thing a bit weird."
Castiel spluttered, coughing around the lung full of smoke he'd just pulled in, burning in his throat as his cheeks turned from a dusty pink to a darker red. Dean laughed at him. "Why I've never..."
"Kissed me, yeah, Cas. Why not?"
Dean scoffed, reaching over to pull a magazine out from under his bed, waving the naked man on the front cover in Castiel's face, making him laugh.
Once it hit 1am, Dean double checked Sam and Mary were both asleep, and led Castiel out onto the roof just outside Dean's window, a few blankets, a pillow and more importantly, a joint in their hands.
"..What's this?" Castiel asked, a printed piece of paper in hand for Jensen Bee Farm in Wichita.
"A joke?" Castiel rose an eyebrow, taking the gift and peeling the paper away to reveal.. customised boxers with Dean's face plastered all over them, and he laughed. "Seriously?"
Castiel's family was a sore subject. He got along with his brother, Gabriel, most of the time, but his parents were too big of a fan of Castiel and his "homosexual choices" and they made that very clear every time he went back home to visit. Which  he didn't anymore. Gabriel visited him sometimes, but he mostly just stayed around his friends and remained happy.
"Cas, baby. I've been doing this since I was a kid. Never fell through. I did fall off, though-" Castiel rolled his eyes, able to picture it. "-but you'll be fine, we're only laying down."
Castiel didn't meet his eyes, focused on chewing his mouthful before he spoke. Dean took another drag, and passed it back, but Castiel just held onto it while he spoke. "Oh, well- um. Just in general, y'know? You must be aware of how attractive you are, Dean."
It was cold outside, nice after 10am, but now it was still cold and a little dark. Dean snuggled into his boyfriends neck, careful not to wake him, and thought about the next few months. Dean still hadn't plucked up the courage to ask Castiel if he wanted to come back home with him on his next visit home. He knew if he didn’t at least attempt to ask, his boyfriend would stay here alone, and didn’t want to think about Castiel sitting around waiting for Dean to come back, or a friend to text to see if he was busy. Castiel  didn't tend to bother making plans with his friends, and that wasn't just because he had Dean, he'd never been big on parties or anything that required more than five people at most. He let Castiel continue to sleep, unable to bring himself to wake him up, even if Dean’s stomach grumbled quietly. He stirred in Dean’s grip, only earning a few tickled kisses against the back of his neck, making Castiel’s lips pull into a sleepy smile.
“...yeah. If you’re sure, and your family’s sure, I’d love to.”
"I might just take you up on that."
“That’s dangerous.” That earned Castiel a playful bite to his shoulder, laughing.
"It's a bee farm. So, we'll have to drive a few hours, and we can stay somewhere nice overnight or something. But you'll be able to harvest your own honey, and see some bees?" Dean said, unsure of it Castiel was up for it by his reaction. His boyfriend's lips split into a grin, practically launching himself across to Dean to hug him.
“So you talked to your family about it, too?”
"Uhm.." Castiel's brain felt frozen, he wasn't sure if this was one of Dean's jokes, or if he was serious. Dean didn't want to kiss him, Castiel wasn't stupid.
"We're here." He told Castiel as he blinked awake, nodding and pushing  his hands over his face, rubbing his eyes to wake himself up a little more. He got out the car with Dean, grabbing both their bags from the backseat of the car, Castiel mentally preparing himself the best he could when he was still half asleep.
Dean's situation was better. His father had left them when he was a teenager, probably for the better, because the man was.. well, an asshole. Dean was more than happy to be left with his mother and his little brother, both who he adored, the two most important people in his life, other than Castiel and his car.
It was mid December, and while it wasn't freezing cold, Castiel still felt chilly each morning, and insisted he wore Dean's robe around the kitchen until he got dressed, earning no complaints from the robe's owner. They'd decorated the house for Christmas, trim around the banister up the stairs, plenty of coloured lights hung around the walls, a good-sized (real) tree stood in the corner of their living room, decorated with absolutely no co-ordination, different colours baubles and tinsel hung on top of multi-coloured lights until there wasn't really much of the tree left on show. Dean thought a lot of the house looked tacky, but it made Castiel happy, even if he'd almost fallen off the roof when they'd put the light up santa and reindeer up there for a little outdoor festivities.
Mary seems to seize the opportunity, hauling him up onto a rock hard mattress. Working hastily to affix bed restraints to his ankles and disregards his groan of agony when she shifts his battered body to release his wrists. Trapping one arm beneath his body to keep him within her control while maneuvering the other out to slip it into its respective strap.
At the correction, Dean swears his heart freezes in his chest. An icy sensation of dread rocketing up his spine as he dips his head to conceal his shock. All thoughts thrown into panicked chaos.
“May I come in?” she starts, sounding entirely rehearsed with a tone that’s awfully defiant for one frozen at the threshold, requesting permission.
“You will be,” Sam repeats with conviction, endeavoring to convince himself more so than Dean. “I have faith in you.”
The counterargument on the tip of his tongue dies with the condemning blare of a horn, rumbling over the treetops.
“Everything I have will be riding on a game of
“Good evening, Mr. Campbell,” she begins without enthusiasm, and places the briefcase with a flourish onto the table. The warm, oceanic tones of her eyes ablaze with implicit knowledge and a promise of pain. “Or would that be, Mr. Winchester?”
“To being drugged and imprisoned?” Dean snaps back with an accompanying scoff at the Alpha’s striking apathy. “Gee, that’s a real shocker.”
“Now, turn your head and take these.”
“And until then, do what?” Dean hisses.
The storm relents a few miles past the border into South Dakota. Its ruling darkness yielding to the encroaching morning rays, penetrating the haze to awash the clouds in saturated reds and golden hues. Painting the start of a new chapter—another chance to turn his life around or fail miserably trying. If not for himself this time, then for the kid’s sake.
Dean works to swallow the pastry down as a slim woman—impeccably dressed in a scarlet pantsuit and matching stilettos—steps dignified into view. Her heels clicking obnoxiously loud against the marble flooring with each dutiful stride. The sleek, ebony briefcase she clutches firmly and fastened to her person by a pair of handcuffs signifying her importance.
Dark brows inch upwards at the proposal. “I typically win triple that amount.” Placing the glass onto the bar, he wonders pensively, “Is there more you’re willing to risk, aside from money?”
A crafty smirk etches slowly across the Alpha’s face at that. “You just told me.” Then, with a single unforeseen maneuver, declares: “Check.”
Dean can’t be sure if it’s meant to be supportive or merely a deterrent from fleeing, but Dean oddly finds comfort in the contact. Allowing it to ground and steady him for the impending battle.
“I don’t belong to anyone,” he asserts with a growl, reaching inside his jacket for the hunting knife the staff missed upon inspection. Thanking his lucky stars the material is thick enough to conceal the weapon’s girth. “You’re going to tell me about Crowley, then I’m going to leave.”
That gives the Seraph pause. His eyes narrowing marginally as he tilts his head in wonderment. “What is it that does interest you, then?”
“Fuck my life,” he grouses, voice weak and cracking. Fighting for traction against the silky golden sheets beneath him, until he’s partially seated with his head resting at an awkward angle against the unforgiving surface of the headboard. Grateful, to find he’s remained fully clothed in the duration of his unconscious handling. The Alpha bastard, apparently, having some shred of decency after all, but not nearly enough to save grace.
“Dean,” Charlie starts, her face pinched with fear. “Maybe we should listen to him.”
“You were wrong, Dean,” the Seraph coos against the shell of his ear, clearly unaffected by the nails clawing red marks across his bared forearm in a bid for freedom. Dean's terror building as his body gradually slackens; the darkness engulfing him, and leaving him with only the comfort of the Alpha's sinister voice.
“Doesn’t that defeat the purpose?” he challenges, silently cursing himself for the major foul up with the IDs. Having been far too distracted by the opulent atmosphere, at the time, to have noticed issuing the front desk the wrong license.
A derisive snort pierces the quiet confines of the car in response. “Yeah, while almost compromising our entire sting operation with your childish antics. And not to mention,” snapping the briefcase closed, she pins him with a leveling glare, “you stirred up a media frenzy with that little cat and mouse chase—
Once given the dispatcher an alias, Mary terminates the call, then carelessly chucks the cellphone towards its owner. Dean barely catching the sound of it skittering across asphalt seconds before the lid of the trunks slams shut, plunging him into darkness.
Bile scorches the back of Dean’s throat, as his entire world commences spinning uncontrollably under the soles of his boots. Vaguely aware of the clacking of the screen door, heralding someone’s presence, and the rapid-fire questions being hurled at him, while he suddenly loses his bearings; stumbling backwards into a support beam. His last paling seconds of consciousness being that of a distant voice calling his name, before observing the planks of the deck rush upwards to meet him.
Nudging Dean forward, the reaper rambles off the instructions. “Follow the path and find your assigned pad. Do not engage in combat with the other contenders until the horn has sounded. Is that understood?”
“No honor among thieves,” Dean comments, vapidly, before successfully capturing the Seraph’s knight. “Though, it doesn’t explain how you knew I was interested in him.”
he comprehends dimly.
“His drinks are on the house.”
Crystal skies pierce through the dark fog inching inwards, as Dean futilely fights the call of oblivion. Vaguely registering the ripping of cloth and admonishing
Apparently satisfied, Mary walks from his line of sight towards Cas’ general direction. Dean’s breaths becoming shallow and fast as his mind fills with possible scenarios.
“I will. I promise,” Dean assures, swallowing thickly as dread prickles up his spine. “But would you call an ambulance for him? I’ll do whatever you want. Just don’t leave him here like this.” And for good measure, he adds, “Please…Mom.”
As if sensing Dean’s suffering, the boy tentatively wonders, “Can we stop?”
Clenching his jaw, he quashes the urge to fight as she repeats the process with his ankles, effectively condemning him to his fate. His skin crawling as she gives him an approving pat on his thigh.
Although, between exhaustion from travel and continuous blood loss, Dean’s certain the last few miles will drag on. Especially, with the road tilting worryingly before him; the lines bending abnormally, forcing an illusion that the lanes are curving. The dull headache that’s been throbbing at his temples since Colorado burgeoning into an unbearable migraine.
Sauntering up without hesitation, Dean leans against the edge of the bar; taking in the alignment of imported liquor on the shelves directly behind the middle-aged Beta with awe. Presuming most of the selection has to be well worth his rate of pay.
Gravel crunches beneath the treads of the tires, as they pull into the open gates of Singer’s Salvage Yard. The outer face of the two-story house dilapidated as ever, though Dean knows better than to say the structure is anything but sturdy; having been constructed by competent hands from the ground up.
"I really am /in/ love with you too, Dean. I'm glad you don't want anyone else, you're stuck with me now."
He eyed the highschool football trophies with distaste, wondering if they'd have been friends in highschool, and then the photos of Dean, Sam and Mary, and the one photo with the man that Castiel only could assume was Dean's father. He wrinkled his nose, and turned back to Dean, who was laying in the center of his double bed, watching Castiel look around. He looked over the few books Dean had, and the little collection of superhero figures on his shelf, picking up the ugly multicoloured beanie baby from the top of his dresser, and smiling at it.
He'd been hoping he could make breakfast before Castiel woke up, scratching Thursday's neck on the counter while he made coffee and mixed pancake batter. Castiel wrapped his arm around Dean's middle as he pressed a kiss against his shoulder.
They opened a few more mundane things, Castiel had gotten Dean a new pair of brown leather boots. Dean's old ones were falling apart, the lacing even wearing out and snapping at some point. Dean bought Cas a few shirts, and some socks that had little cats on them. Castiel unwrapped the gift that was labelled for Thursday, which turned out to be a cat bed with a pack of treats. Dean shrugged when Castiel asked why he'd wrapped a present up for the cat, earning a grin from his boyfriend.
“I /did/ tame you.” Castiel grinned, pausing to think it over for barely a moment. “Are you sure? I wouldn’t want to impose on that, I know you're-“ He was cut off by a kiss from Dean. They shared a few more before Dean spoke again.
Castiel had been beyond excited for Christmas this year. They'd agreed to stay on their own for once. They'd gone to Castiel's fathers one Christmas and ended up back at Dean's family's place pretty quickly after the first fight had broken out, and Dean had punched Lucifer hard enough to make his nose bleed after insulting Castiel. And from then on they'd spent the holidays with Mary, John and Sam, and more recently Eileen, Sam's girlfriend. But with the new house, they wanted to start their own traditions and just be by themselves for once.
“Yep. And mom wants to meet you. She keeps going on about the guy who tamed me. Whatever that means.”
"You left me in bed alone on /Christmas/." Dean knew he was pouting as Castiel had spoken, his own lip pulling up into a smile as he reached back and squeezed Castiel's thigh.
“I wouldn’t just sit around and wait.” Castiel argued, rolling in Dean’s arms to face him. “How long have you been thinking about that?”
"Thanks the plan, sweetheart. I'm glad you like it. I'm sure you'll still be hot in that beekeeper outfit."
"Of course you are." Dean murmured, kissing his head again like he had earlier, smiling. "Can't make pancakes with you plastered to me, as much as it's nice."
“I’m sure, Cas. Wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t.”
It took almost another year for them to admit their feelings for each other. Dean wasn't a bad influence, but in this instance, they were sat on the floor of their small kitchen/diner/living room, leaning up against the kitchen cupboards, a half eaten pizza in its box by their feet, and a joint swapping from Dean's hand to Castiel's. Cas never smoked until he met Dean, and it was never regular, but now and then Dean returned home after class with a blunt, and Castiel grinned and dialed up for pizza. This specific time, Castiel was being soft, and telling Dean how glad he was to have him as a friend.
"Stop thinking." Dean told him, head turned to the side, watching his boyfriend with a small smile.
So, second of all, he was Dean Winchesters boyfriend. They'd made it official almost six months ago, and it'd been smooth sailing since. Well, mostly smooth sailing. It'd been weird, everyone on campus finding out that Dean Winchester was dating quiet, nerdy Castiel Novak, and was completely serious about it. Castiel had been told plenty of untrue things about Dean from random girls he'd never met, as if it was going to change anything, as if Castiel didn't already know Dean better than any of these girls did. But they worked it out, and while a lot of people thought they were an oddly placed couple.. they didn't. They fit like puzzle pieces, and they didn't need to prove that to anyone.
“The Empty?” Dean wiped a tear he hadn’t noticed from his cheek.
Dean blinked a couple of times, obviously annoyed.  “People suck, Sam.  That doesn’t concern us.”
“I’m not blaming him for everything.  I’m blaming him for...him.”
“I thought you had stamina” Melanie was teasing him, but smiled at him genuinely with an ‘its up to you’ shrug.  Castiel hoped it didn’t take as long as it felt it did to get the condom in place.
“You’ve never really talked about Earth before you met us,” Dean spoke around his mouthful.
Sam mused.
“No, because, God knows what we do all the time anyway, right?”
Cas tilted his head. “....yeah?”
The angel paused to take a sip of his drink.  “One year, at about this time, I…had an assignment nearby and I was given permission to use a human vessel, which, you know almost never happens.  My, uh, vessel – “Castiel looked at his hands and cringed just a little.  Dean took a breath, ready to change the topic, but Cas took a breath and continued.
“The good ones do,” Dean answered, returning to the room with Sam’s laptop for the impromptu movie night.  Sam followed closely with a what was probably Castiel’s uneaten plate and cleared the library table of shredded wrapping paper with a sweep of his long arm.
“I love you, Cas.  At first I thought it was a side effect of this “thing” that connects us.  I thought it was, like, misplaced intimacy.  I told myself for over a decade that Angels couldn’t feel the same things.  I had a crush on your big blue eyes, and messy hair,” Dean reached up to tussle Cas’s hair, making it stand up.  “You were lightning and thunder.  The things I saw you do were terrifying...Powerful and, and I think we all fell in love with you a little bit.  I thought I was in love with someone who was so far above me, I was lucky you even noticed me.  If I had known, if I had the balls to ask, I would have shared my life with you.  You get my meaning?”
“Just watch and see if the wolves are nearby the scene.”
Cas rolled his eyes.  “Of course, Dean.”
“He hides things.”
The faded, but still carbonated off brand soda hissed appropriately as Sam popped it open and he glared at the pages, wondering if it wouldn’t just be easier to throw them away.  “They’re probably not private or important,” Sam chided himself.  “Since when does Cas even have private, important papers?”  There’s only one way to find out.  He took a breath, unfolded the pages with one hand and read from the very top of the first page.
The second time Cas stumbled on to Dean’s collection, it seemed more coincidental than intentional.  For the record, Dean invited Castiel to his room that night.  They were going to watch The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly at exactly 9:30.  However, when Castiel knocked on the partially opened door, Dean wasn’t there.  The angel took an awkward step inside, shoving his hands deep into his coat pockets.  Dean reminded him twice, so its not like the hunter forgot that they were supposed to meet.
“I’ve been following a Satanic cult hellbent on summoning Lucifer and Dean has been trying to track down a cursed set of acrylic paints.  He only needs a Thelo Blue and a Burnt Crimson to complete the set.”
“You’re asking me to participate in sexual intercourse with you and Melanie...tonight...upstairs?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hello, Dean”.
“Right.”  Dean nodded and stumbled towards the bathroom.
“What?  No.  Nothing.  Standard issue, small town hookup.”
, Dean?”
“Well, when we deal with Michael, you should tell me about it.  All of it.”
The third time Castiel found Dean’s porn was definitely on purpose.  Sam was working a solo case a few states away while Dean and Castiel were both working locally, but also independently.  The two almost never saw each other and took to leaving each other post-it-notes in passing.
Sam once again assumed his mask of irritatingly unwavering calm.  “Some ‘arrangements’ are...unspoken, but understood by both parties.”
It took Sam a few seconds to process the change in conversation.  “Uh, yeah, the case.   I guess it depends if you mean Chaucer Wight or Tolkien Wight.  The lore isn’t really clear on how or if they’re different from Revenants.”
“I never want to wake up,” Dean felt his heat leaving his body through his eyes.
“Do all of the Die Hard movies take place at Christmas?” Cas squinted at some DVD cases in his hands.
“Uh, Yeah.”
“Is this real? Or did I take too many pills?”
Next to the headline was a police sketch that looked more than a little like his brother.  Sam opened the headline page and reached over, vigorously shaking Deann’s shoulder. “DEAN! DEAN! Up! Now!”
Sam glanced at the papers and then over to the car, with a resigned sigh.
“What the hell are you doing?” Sam called out to Dean.  Dean saw Sam, smiled, and sprinted down the sidewalk.  Sam set off in pursuit, but due to his lead, Dean disappeared around the side of the building.  When Sam attempted the turn, he ran smack into someone and they both fell to the street.
“Thank you, it was the first thing that came to mind when you spoke of a ‘Family Dinner’.  I wasn’t certain you would enjoy it.”
“Oh! Hey, I forgot my phone charger.  I’ll pick one up while I’m out, but can I borrow your phone ‘til then?”
Sam wound the Impala around Betty’s apartment block, slowly.  Lots of windowed terraces, some well cared for and some not.  Unfortunately for Sam, it looked like all access to the apartments was internal to the main building and he wouldn’t be able to see much just in passing.  “Fuck,” Sam picked a shaded parking spot that faced the building and settled in to get an idea of foot traffic.  Winchester fumbled in his bag for his sunglasses and then emptied the contents of his pants pockets into the bag, to make the sitting and waiting more comfortable.  The bright yellow pages from Cas’s desk fell into the heap and Sam frowned at them.  He clearly saw his name several times in the writing.
Castiel mirrored Sam’s fondness as the younger Winchester stood from the table.  “Good night, Sam.  Thank you.”  As he watched Sam leave, Castiel was momentarily puzzled by one sudden, slight twinge of Sam’s neck and shoulders, but Sam kept walking as if he hadn’t noticed, so Cas returned his eyes to his book.
This caused conflicting sensations in the pit of Castiel’s stomach and a warmth spread from the base of his spine upwards and back down, causing him to shudder and gasp.  His muscles contracted like before, but this time Dean didn’t interrupt.  Everything felt tight all at once and Cas’s senses blurred, he felt as though he was falling off of a steep cliff and at the moment he was about to hit the ground, his wings spread and he soared.  Then it was over. He opened his eyes and tried to breath.  Melanie was smiling up at him and Dean was sitting up, rubbing both green eyes tiredly with his palms. “Umm..I, uh…’
“Sometimes I wonder if you remember who Cas was before we met him.  What he did.”
“Well, we can’t exactly ask the victim.  She saw me with you yesterday.”
If a text message can be plaintive, this was it.
There was a loud thud from the bathroom and Sam was about half off the bed before he heard “DAMMIT!” from behind the walls.  “I’m glad you’re alive!”, Sam called to the wall.  Resettling on the bed and looking back at his phone, Sam saw little dots bouncing on the screen that meant Cas was formulating a reply.
Jack lit up like, well, a kid on Christmas morning.  He leapt up from the meal and ran into the library, Sam right on his heels.
“The keys?” Dean wasn’t even sure why he was feigning innocence about the keys, but at this point he couldn’t stop himself.
“Dean, literally everyone who has ever stayed in this bunker has seen-”
“Salt and Silver then?”
Castiel shut Dean’s door with a sigh.
Sam shifted to grab his phone from his back pocket and the folded bundle of papers tumbled out onto the table.  Dean sighed and Sam slowly pushed the pages under the carton for his fries before opening a document on his phone.  “That’s where I’d start.  If nothing else, we can try fire, decapitation, or maybe resolve whatever lingering issue it has with the living.”
Dean laughed and he repeated, a little too loudly, “Yes.  I’m inviting you to participate in sexual intercourse with me and Melanie, right upstairs, right now.  That is exactly what I am asking.”
“I know.”
Sam pursed his lips in a way that characteristically meant he was choosing his words carefully.  “How do you mean?”
“Nothin’.”  Dean frowned and nodded.
“We don’t claim to be holy or to be God.  We’re not older than the planet.  We don’t have divine knowledge and can’t smite Demons with our minds and shit - “
“Porn?” Even Dean realized how ridiculous that feigned innocence sounded and cringed.
“Ahh,” Sam nodded his explicit understanding, falling into the chair across the table from Castiel.  “Did something happen?”
It took Cas a solid half a minute to understand the short encounter.  When it clicked, the angel smiled.  That embarrassment was...cute.  Unwarranted and inappropriate, certainly, as Cas was indifferent to his friend’s viewing habits, but endearing.
“Christ,” Dean mumbled refusing to open his eyes.  “Stop! We don’t have to leave right away”.
“And why is that, huh, Sam?  Think about it.  We had Bobby, until Cas released the Leviathans from Purgatory.  Jo got ripped apart by hellhounds and Ellen blew herself up because-”
“Yes.”
“Try to keep it to just a few,” Garth had warned, writing the prescription.  “They’re to help you to relax into sleep, not to knock you out.”
“I was thinking she seemed like your type.”
Sam must have been having the same thoughts about his own drink.  “Wow Cas, this is great!”
After speaking, Cas returned his full attention back to stirring an aromatic, thick mixture under a very specific simmer.  Dean felt Cas to be uncharacteristically melancholy since Jack ‘came back’, but he was the only one who thought so.  “I’ll fight you, Angel!” Dean tried to engage his friend back into the light banter.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Dean, whatev-”
Cas nodded awkwardly.
Castiel wasn’t completely sure what Sam meant nor was he completely sure that Sam was completely sure about what Sam meant.  “Right.  Uh, okay.  Correct him.”
“It’s perfect!” Jack smiled down at the Jell-O.
“It’s ok Dean,” Cas smiled.  He closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against Dean’s.  “It’s about damned time.”  This time he initiated the long overdue kiss, trapping his friend’s bottom lip between his and running his tongue along that lip, wanting to taste every molecule of Dean.
Dean smiled and shook his head.  “You, uh, liked that video?”
Castiel frowned at the page he’d marked over with particular viciousness.  “Stood up implies that there was an arrangement in place.  There was never any such arrangement.”
“Right.”  Dean took a step back and quietly closed the door.
Melanie eagerly rose to her knees and Cas obediently took a spot in the dingy vinyl chair.  Cas felt over-warm, but he didn’t take his eyes off of Melanie as he shrugged out of his long coat.  She smiled at Dean like he was a god.  Without needing a word of encouragement, Melanie dipped her head and took Dean into her mouth.  Slowly she began to rock her body back and forth, bringing Dean closer to her.  Cas noted with fascination the smile at the edges of Melanie’s lips as her rocking had to go further and further back as Dean grew in her mouth.  Dean relaxed his hands onto Melanie’s shoulders and began to match her movements with his hips.
“It’s okay,” the woman tried to wipe some dirt from the back seat of her pants. “You must have been chasing the guy that ran past me?’
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is this what Christmas was like for you two growing up?” Jack asked innocently, uncertainly spearing an asparagus sprout with his fork.
“His name was Ansilo and he worked at a quarry.  He was scarred and calloused and I think he genuinely welcomed the opportunity for a break.  Anyway, I took a short detour into that village.  I wanted to sit for a prayer and experience the place from a human perspective.”
Melanie did not appear to miss a stroke as she gracefully took Cas completely into her mouth.  He closed his eyes as he felt the heat surround him and he could rejoin the moment.  When he opened his eyes, he found Dean looking at him.  A blush had settled on the hunter’s freckled cheeks and his mouth was half open as he moved against Melanie. He looked away when Castiel looked down at him.
Dean reached out and gripped Cas’s face with both hands.  “Don’t ever apologize for that.  You hear me?  I wish you could’ve told me some other way.  I wish we’d talked more when we had the chance.  I wish I would’ve understood everything sooner.”  He searched deeply into Cas’s eyes, to know that Cas both heard and understood everything he was saying, everything he meant.
“Shaddup,” Dean blushed again and smiled towards Cas.
The brothers shared a glance.
“Aww, Cas,” Dean admonished him, “Melanie doesn’t bite.”
“I don’t care about your porn Dean - “
“Yes.  Your brother ran into a ‘friend’ at a bar.”, Castiel didn’t lift his eyes from the yellowed pages.
“We can walk?”, Dean suggested.  There was something in Dean’s tone that made Sam’s fraternal spidey sense ping.
“Yeah.  yeah.  I’m just going to walk.”
“Hey now, don’t forget about me over here.”  Dean’s words broke the spell Castiel’s body was under and he found himself disappointed as all of his muscles began to relax.
“Right.”  Cas nodded his head dutifully, taking a seat at the hotel room’s miniature sized round table, Dean’s laptop in hand.
“At least I won’t have to ask Cas to heal my sodium levels!” Sam shot back with an exaggeratedly disapproving look of his older brother’s turkey coming out of the oven.
Castiel made a few contemplative strokes against the woman’s body, really trying his best not to accidentally touch Dean as he did so.  Castiel closed his eyes.  This was the warmth and wetness that Jimmy was powerless against and dreamed of even as Castiel fought the armies of Heaven in possession of the vessel.  Though he, himself, was not completely new to sex, Castiel could only defer to Jimmy’s stolen memories and the few porn videos he’d seen for reference of what it really must be like to indulge himself fully.
Castiel reluctantly peeled himself away, taking over the role of making them both coffee, and turned on some Christmas music from the little played they had on the counter. Dean gifted Cas one years and years ago, and it had followed him through every kitchen he'd baked in. Plus, sometimes when there was a slower song on, Dean would pry him away from the counter and whatever he was mixing, and dance him around the kitchen, singing quietly against his ear. Maybe he'd be able to convince Dean into a dance tonight.
It took Castiel aback, his stomach doing a little flip like it had the first time Dean had told him he loved him. He tilted his head up and pressed a lingering kiss against Dean's jaw, since he couldnt reach his lips.
Castiel studied it, wondering if Dean had just wrapped up nothing, and carefully opened it so that he didn't damage whatever was inside it.
Dean's bedroom was exactly what he'd expected, still a mess from the last time Dean had been there, but the bed was changed and clean, and he assumed it was Mary who lit the vanilla candle, which made Castiel feel a lot better about being there.
"Me too." Castiel replied, lifting his head to look at Dean, his smile soft and stupid. "Love you."
Once they'd eaten, they left the music on and moved through to the living room, sitting opposite each other on the floor. They'd debated getting dressed, but with no one coming over at all, Castiel found he was more than happy to keep Dean shirtless for a few more hours, at least.
Dean rummaged through the gifts to find one for Cas, passing it over with a grin. "I'm giving you this one first because it's kind of a joke, but I'm pretty sure you're gonna love it."
The boys found a perfect house pretty quickly, somewhere between both of their works, with a nice sized garden and a garage that fit both their cars. Castiel had painted their bedroom a pale blue, hanging photos he deemed important on the opposite their bed. A few of him and Gabriel, Dean with Sam and his family, a few of them altogether, and most importantly the newest addition to their home, Castiel's stray white cat named Thursday. Dean hated her to begin with, a stray cat that he was sure the previous house owners had left behind, but he loved the way Castiel smiled at her. She was soon sleeping in their bed, and Dean wouldn't admit he'd fallen in love with her too.
"I'm not thinking." Castiel lied, "I'm just.. thinking about how nice this all is. Ive never met someone's parents before."
They had two good-sized bedrooms and a smaller one.They'd turned them both into guest rooms for now, because they'd both agreed on waiting a little while more before they started the whole kids conversation, but they knew they both were up for the idea. A nice bathroom with a shower and a tub, something Castiel had been insistent on. The kitchen was big, with an island and a dining table they never really used unless they had guests, the counters were black granite with dark wood cupboards, Castiel's favourite room in the house, of course. He liked coming downstairs in the morning to find Dean sat at the island with coffee, half-dressed and munching on toast.
"Hm?" Castiel asked, already momentarily forgetting what he'd just said, "Oh! No, no. Not... Well, yes. Not constantly, but I.. you're very distracting a lot of the time."
“Hey.” Castiel murmured, voice gravelly with sleep, blinking himself into consciousness.
Sam met them at the door, introducing himself to Castiel with a grin, both happy he finally got to meet Castiel, and because he wanted to annoy his older brother before he'd even stepped through the door. Nothing new there. Mary hugged him. Castiel hadn't expected it, he wasn't sure why because he knew how much Dean enjoyed hugs and being close, but it still took him aback before he returned it with a smile. They stayed with them for a few hours, eating and generally chatting. Castiel found it a lot less dramatic than he'd imagined meeting his boyfriends family, and he found he felt at home pretty quickly in the Winchesters house.
Castiel laughed, swatting Dean's thigh, and passed the joint back, sighing. "I know, I know. It's nice to be around them, though. And Sam. I can see why you visit so often now."
"I know you've met Charlie's."
Dean smiled, stopping his singing to kiss Castiel's forehead. "The best, Cas." He murmured softly, resting his chin on Castiel's head. He couldn't help but think of their lives in a few years, if they'd be dancing this time in five years, too. Maybe the kid would be asleep by now, and they'd be exhausted but they'd still make time for it.
"I /was/ planning on waking you up with pancakes and coffee." He chuckled, twisting around to wrap his arms around him, and pressed a sweet slow kiss against his lips, in absolutely no rush this morning. Their presents were already under the tree, and Dean would need to start on their dinner later on, but right now he had everything  he needed in his arms.
Dean shook Castiel's shoulder gently, rousing him from his nap. They were parked in Dean's childhood driveway, positive that his mom and Sam had heard the car pull up, he didn't want to keep them waiting.
It wasn't late yet, and they still had four or five hours before their Christmas Day was over and they'd definitely make it upstairs in a fever of kisses in a matter of hours, but right now Castiel still pressed his cheek against Dean's shoulder, opening his eyes again to look up at him. "Did you have a good Christmas?"
They washed up side by side, Dean cleaning dishes and Castiel quietly drying them. He didn't need to ask Dean to dance with him, the kitchen dim by the time they were finished cleaning. Dean took his hands without saying anything, and pulled Castiel into his chest, stepping around the island slowly, swaying. Blue Christmas was playing, Dean singing quietly in Castiel's ear, making him smile.
Two weeks later, both men were on the tail end of a long drive back to Lawrence, Castiel's head was leaning against Dean's shoulder as it had been for the last hour or so. They should have left earlier, but it was very easy to get distracted when you live with your partner. They'd planned to get there for dinner, but it was approaching 8pm now, and they still had another half an hour to go.
"You know, other than Charlie, you're the only other best friend I've ever had?" Castiel murmured, earning a hum from Dean, waiting for him to continue. "Mm. I'm glad you're around. Even if you make life harder sometimes."
Dean continued to watch him while Castiel realised what he'd been saying, and his cheeks flushed a lovely shade of pink, one Dean thought suited him quite well. "Not that you're.. distracting. I think I might just stop talking now." Castiel muttered, reaching for another slice of pizza instead of speaking, while Dean contined to look at him, amused.
The brothers Winchester walked in slow silence towards the budget fast food place for a long time.  Out of the corner of his eye, Sam saw Dean look at him, but when he looked up, Dean would look away.
“She is interested in, well, we are interested in, mmmm.” Dean sighed.  “Would you like to join us upstairs?
Dean reached a hand out to Jack while simultaneously wrapping his other arm around his angel.  “Hang on Jack, we’re on our way.”  He then whispered conspiratorially to Cas, “We’re ruining Christmas for the kid.”
Cas cocked an eyebrow.  “Sticky.”
“How do you want me?’, Dean offered, settling his palms flat, holding himself up on bed as he seemed to unconsciously follow her body towards the headboard.
“Did you clean out the fridge?  I thought I had a pizza left”, one note read accusingly.  “It was two weeks old!”, was Castiel’s reply in a flowing script.  “Please return towels to the laundry room!”, one note scolded.  Dean wrote a small, jagged “Yes, mom” on the note, leaving it on a pile of freshly laundered and folded towels. This went on long enough that the men made an unofficial game of hiding the notes in unexpected places.  Cas found a grocery list inside a box of chocolate cereal and Dean found a poem about the sounds of the bunker’s antiquated air conditioning system inside of an ammunition locker.
At his desk, Dean quickly shrugged into an old red checkered flannel and, in the same motion, shoved the closed laptop further away from the angel at the door.
Sam took a measured, certain breath.  “Is this related to my asswipe of a brother?”.  He nodded as Cas nodded helplessly at the table.  “Cas, nobody ever asks me, but I don’t think that there is very much that Dean doesn’t understand about you or your arrangement.  If there is something that he needs to know or something that he’s deliberately making you misunderstand, he needs to be...corrected.”
Puzzled, but interested, Cas settled into the large, stiff library chair.  He flipped open the laptop and was pleased to see it was only sleeping instead of turned off.  As the note promised, there was a movie file icon named “Cass” in the center of the desktop.  Castiel perched his head on his chin and played the video.
“Did you?” Dean was definitely smiling.
At this point, Dean’s breathing also changed so Melanie lifted her back to Dean for more access.  He folded himself completely around her, leaving the angel, Castiel, to fully support the weight of all three of them. Dean thrusted and stalled several times against the woman before he let out a powerful moan and shuddered.  Then he was still.  Dean lay breathing against the woman with his eyes pinched closed for a few minutes before withdrawing from her and falling backwards onto the mattress.  Melanie released Castiel and rocked back on her knees where she and Dean shared a satisfied laugh of nervous energy. Watching that shared motion and reaction genuinely delighted Cas.
“Not drunk,” Dean shook his head a little too emphatically.  “I wanted to be sure I caught you before you made it to the room.”  Dean waved Castiel in the direction of Baby and both men perched on the Impala’s hood.
Dean narrowed his eyes.
“I’m more worried that you think there is an age limit to seeking out companionship, Sammy.”  Dean slid out of his wrinkled shirts and the Whisky smell became more intense. “ I need a shower.”
“Much,” Dean agreed.
Cas headed a few steps towards the parking lot entrance before turning back. “Hey, Dean?”
When that short moment passed, Melanie returned her attention and her mouth back to Cas, as if she’d never let him go.  Cas could also feel that, while Dean appeared to be lying on his back with a darkly freckled arm across his face, Dean wasn’t staring at the ceiling.  He had Dean’s undivided attention as well.  He could feel Dean’s eyes on his face, and mouth, and chest.  This made him both self-conscious and a little bolder.  He made sort of a show of thrusting deeply into Melanie’s mouth, but decided he very much liked how that felt and kept doing it and found the woman was very accommodating. She rearranged herself so that she was on her knees, one hand and her mouth firmly gripping Castiel’s shaft and she used the other hand to gently tug on his testicles in rhythm with her head movements.
Sam shook his head, glad that the greasy fast food joint was now in sight.  “Bullshit. Bobby, Ellen, Jo, and Rufus were all hunters, they knew the risks.  Charlie was translating the Book of the Damned and
Sam was getting more confused, not less.
“I don’t have ‘a type’”, Cas was certain of this.
“You need a shower,” Sam agreed.
Sam sat back on his bed and read from the webpage.  “Local police are seeking assistance after a woman was brutally attacked last night.  The woman, age 30, was brought to the hospital in serious condition after the woman’s sister found her, on the floor of their shared 5th street apartment early this morning.  Per the complaint, the woman states she was attacked by a man she invited over last night.  The woman states the date ended amicably and she watched the suspect leave her building and start walking westward. However, a short time later, the man reappeared at her door, demanding to be let in.  When she refused, the suspect broke in her door and proceeded to physically assault her.”
.  Sam sighed, knowing that the tension between Dean and Cas was exactly why Dean was in this mood.  Then Sam remembered the folded paper in his back pocket.
Castiel opted to walk the short distance to the hotel and hadn’t noticed how warm he had been until he felt his skin chill against the night air, as if all of his body heat was trying to find a way to escape at once.  “It’s a normal human body response”, he spoke in an attempt to keep himself company, more than anything.  “When humans are angry or upset their bodies have a chain reaction that prepares the body to expend great amounts of energy.”
Sam looked back out to the empty bunker hallway before stepping across the room’s threshold.  It felt odd being in Cas’s room like some creeper, but the angel was the one who asked that Sam meet him here.  Sam sat on the edge of the bed for a minute, before thinking that really made him look like a creeper, so then he stood by the desk.  He weighed the creep factor of taking a seat at the desk’s chair, when he saw his name in capital letters and darker print on one of the sheets of torn out paper.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice cracked and he cleared his throat self-consciously.  “Cas.  It’s been two weeks and one day since you...since you left.  What were you thinking, man?  We need you.  I need you.  I need you to -” Dean smiled in spite of himself, “Grip me tight and raise me from this.  It hurts and it sucks and... find a way back. There has to be a way.  There always has been.  You’re an Angel, with a capital A.”
“I don’t know man.  We were on really good terms when I left, I promise,”  Dean smiled a little cockily.
“How about we switch?” Dean offered up from his back. “Or, uh we could, uh…”
Dean felt Cas stiffen beside him.  “My garrison was stationed on Earth since practically the beginning.  We were told to watch and never interfere unless…well, you know some of that.” Dean reassuringly leaned into Cas while taking another bite.
“You can text him,” Dean motioned with both arms that Sam should leave the room immediately.  Sam realized there was no way he could discretely place the pages on the desk now.  He hoped Cas wouldn’t be too angry with him as he slipped the folded pages into his back pocket.
“Cas,” Dean nudged Castiel in the ribs, causing Cas to jerk his head back to the center of the room. “this is Melanie.  Melanie, this is...Cas.”
“Room 121.”  Dean’s voice ripped Sam’s focus from the page.  Dean squinted at him from a few feet away.  Dean waggled the oversized hotel key fob at him.  “You wanna get some lunch first?  There was a fast food joint about a mile back?”
“Cas, I-”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean watched Cas beam a bright white smile back to Sam.
The two ordered from the extremely unhealthy menu and, once having taken possession of their greasy bags from the friendly looking cashier,  took a booth near the back of the dining room.  Dean dove into his dripping fries, without a word, and Sam sighed - his big brother was especially broody today and Sam knew he’d hit a very raw nerve.
Glad he was out of Castiel’s direct line of sight, Dean couldn’t completely squelch a knowing laugh about that statement.  Melanie smacked Dean’s thigh in Castiel’s defense even though she wasn’t in on that particular joke. “Be Nice!”.  Dean made one sharp thrust in response, nearly toppling the precarious tower.
“Did the villagers accept you?” Sam asked, enthralled by the story.
“We got problems Dean.  Our kind of problems”.
“I should - “ Castiel made a wide gesture towards Dean’s discarded box of condoms.
“So, Wights?”  Dean licked a glob of ketchup off of the corner of his mouth and looked at Sam expectantly.
Sam glanced down and his eyes were drawn to a bit of handwriting that was visible above the fold Sam had made in the pages.
It rang twice before he heard Dean’s familiar “Hey Cas!”
“No.  I’m dreaming.  Sometimes, I have moments of...terrifying lucidity though, I think it was an extra ‘screw you’ from the Being that lives here.  Imagine being just aware enough that you know you’re in your worst nightmare and knowing that no matter what you do or how much you beg, you know exactly what you’re falling back into.
“Hmm?”
“Hey, Cas?”, Sam asked and knocked briskly on the Angel’s bedroom door.  He waited a second and turned the knob.  It was never locked and the door sprang right open.  Castiel’s room looked as unlived in as usual.  The twin bed was immaculately made, mostly because it was never slept in.  If Castiel kept many personal belongings, it wasn’t apparent by the bare walls or empty shelving.  The only outward indication that someone had been in the room recently was the lack of dust and a yellow, legal-sized pad of paper on the desk.  Several sheets of paper were pulled off of the pad and lay in an untidy heap beside it - some balled up, some neatly folded.
“And maybe hit on the cute cashier on your way to the toilet?”, Sam mused.
Sam smiled at Cas fondly.  “I’m sorry about him.  I’m sorry that he’s obviously hurt your feelings tonight.  Please don’t give up on him or whatever he’s scheming just yet.  Good night, Cas.”
Sam cringed and backspaced, clearing out the word grabbed,
Sam blinked.
Dean frowned.  “Alright, back to the hotel, then?  We can make Crownpoint by this time tomorrow.  I’m gonna hit the head before we head out.”
“Betty.  Her name is Betty.”
as a flurry of motion near the front of the building caught his peripheral, dragging his attention reluctantly from the page to see Dean exiting the apartment building.
“Is it one of Mary’s old-fashioned recipes?” Jack asked.  Dean shivered at the thought of his mother being ‘old-fashioned’.  It made him sound old.
Castiel was fairly certain that the first time Dean left his recreational material open for Cas to see was accidental.  Dean asked Cas to monitor traffic patterns in the area while he and Sam went out to the crime scene.
“Dean! I don’t care about your porn, I just wanted to know if you knew where the spare keys to the garage are.”
Sam reached for Dean’s phone quietly and slipped it into his coat.  “Uh, sorry. Sorry.  Bye."
“Yeah,”  Sam nodded.  “I’m just tired and I’ve got this-”  Sam waved the folded yellow paper around, “...research that I don’t know what to do with.”
Cas folded his arms and his shoulders sunk, slightly embarrassed.  “I like the way sound echoed.”
“You and Melanie?  Upstairs….together?” Cas was having some trouble with his words and shoved his hands into his pockets, bringing his coat closer to his body.
“DEAN! You need to see this!”  Sam grabbed Dean’s arm and began to pull Dean off the mattress.
The sapphire eyed angel was indignantly correcting a volume on 7th century Catholicism when Sam spilled into the library later that night.
“What?  Fine.  Just let go.”  Dean pulled his arm from Sam’s grip and opened his eyes.  “This had better be fucking important.”
The Angel walked until he saw the tacky neon-violet cursive text of the hotel sign.  Frustratingly, his heart began to stammer quickly when he was close enough to the hotel to see Dean’s “Baby” parked near that sign.  This was the sort of roadside dive where the two-storied hotel’s rooms open directly onto the street, so Cas wouldn’t have to pass through a lobby or risk any attention to get to the appointed room.  Once in the parking lot, Cas scanned the ancient hotel’s layout for stairs to the second floor.
The Angel nodded.  “As you can imagine, time is different here.  It’s been a great deal longer.  I heard your prayer Dean.  I’ve heard them all.”
“It was...beautiful.”
Castiel laughed deeply at their antics, but he didn’t move to leave the table.  He seemed quite content to sit there, looking down at his untouched plate, with his shoulder resting flush against Dean’s.  Dean felt compelled to saw another bit off his turkey and stuff it into his mouth.
“Can we make a decision, please?” Dean spoke with short breaths and growing urgency.
Sam woke up to see he’d fallen asleep with his computer still on his chest. Netflix’s judgmental “Are you still watching?” message was on his main browser page, but an alert made the text flicker for the second open tab - his news trawler.  He shifted and brought that tab up.  It was the front page for the local small-time news rag.  The headline was
“Are you ok?”
Melanie smiled, clicked the toy off, and with some effort, removed it, setting it on the nightstand next to Dean’s belt.  “What about your friend?”
Soon Melanie began to move in shorter and shorter arcs.  Her breathing became stilted and this drew Castiel’s full attention.  She had Dean’s attention too, as he reached one hand around her hips, placed it between her thighs, and began to rub.  She withdrew her mouth from Castiel and muttered quiet curses as she ground against Dean’s pelvis on the way down and his hand on the way up in short spastic motions.  Suddenly, she took a breath, let out a short series of moans, and arched up and forward, where she latched onto one of Castiel’s arms.  Enraptured, Cas held her tightly to him with his other arm.  She buried herself in the crook of Cas’s elbow and Cas smiled broadly and stroked her hair as her breathing began to slow.
“Heya Cas.  Look man, I’m really sorry about last night.  Hope you’re not too angry or frustrated or somethin’.”
“Remember that time Bobby took us to an ice rink for Christmas day?”, Dean asked his brother and gratefully held out a metal cup to receive Castiel’s beverage as the angel circled the table, pouring into every man’s cup.
Both Winchester men received a mug that read “My Guardian Angel is a BADASS” which they happily filled with more spiced berry wine.  Sam had a thick book of lore written in Enochian to delve into and Jack had many “necessary items for a young man” as Dean described them – a wooden handled straight razor, a bottle of pungent smelling aftershave and a crayon illustrated book entitled How to Get a Girlfriend, among them.
“God could really not care less wha-”
“Join you?” Cas cleared his throat.
“I didn’t raise you from the depths of hell to let you wreck your kidneys, Dean Winchester,” Cas responded in his characteristically dry, deep voice.  Cas spoke without humor, but Dean knew he was joking.  Hopefully he was joking.  Dean paused to wonder if the angel was joking and, if not, how many times Cas may have silently ‘helped him out’ over the years with his many small touches.
“We angels all have our talents. Anael’s is healing, Zachariah had an affinity for time, mine was always...this,” Cas gestured vaguely around him, “Dreams.”
“Uhh, I can’t, thank you.” Castiel withdrew his hand.  If she was offended, Melanie did not show it.  She maneuvered around Dean so that she was up on all fours.  This brought Dean up to his knees.  Melanie made a movement to bring her head down on him again, but Castiel pulled back.
Cas awkwardly thumbed through a flipped over book on Dean’s desk and silently critiqued the number of weapons Dean used in his decorating.  His attention fell to Dean’s laptop.  It was turned at an angle away from the door, but the screen had not gone to sleep, indicating dean had just left the room.  Cas tilted his head to see an erotic photo open on the screen.
“I’ve got you, handsome.” Melanie assured him, sliding off the bed with a pillow.  She dropped the pillow on the floor next to Cas’s chair and knelt on it.  Castiel clasped his hands rigidly to the chair’s armrest, but was sure to leave his body open as Melanie leaned into his space.  Dean momentarily grabbed Cas’s attention as he sat on the edge of the bed, but Melanie grabbed it back instantly, as she reached in to unbuckle his belt.  He watched her eyes and found her smile intoxicating.  She was earnest in unzipping his trousers and met his eyes as she slipped her hand inside, drawing him out.  Castiel was embarrassed when she drew out his already solid erection and by the fact that her touch seemed to shoot lightening through his body.
