Sherlock didn't answer.
“Sure thing, tea?” John offered, knowing that Lestrade was trying to determine if he was still stable or not. He wasn’t sure either way himself.
Sherlock flopped onto the bed. “It’s a miracle. You figured something out.”
“The… we’re not being chased by the hound from our visit to the Baskervills?” Sherlock was sure this was some fear left over from that case.
"Hey there..." John said softly, kneeling to eye level with him as he cupped Sherlock’s cheeks and tilted his head up to look at him. "None of that now, alright?"
John looked up, noticing he was only a block from the morgue now. It was still early and he knew Molly would be working. The flat was an empty and constant reminder of what he had lost, perhaps paying a friend a visit could help.
“No, no, no, and a million times no!”
Lestrdae tried pulling his neck and head back, away from his attacker, and surprisingly Mycroft allowed this until almost all of the tentacle was out. But just as Greg thought he would finally be free of it, Mycroft quickly thrust it forward again and back into the welcoming wetness. The tentacle squirmed inside of him, now starting to gently thrust in and out of Greg’s mouth as he tried getting away. But it seemed that this could be an easily exploitable weakness. The thick tentacles on Greg’s waist and wrists were going lax as he focused on the on in his mouth. Maybe he could still escape after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
John fought against the thick rope that bound Sherlock to his chair.
'Play the disk.'
“You have no boyfriends or close friends that would be messaging you at this hour of the night. Your face showed that the text was of some importance and you immediately began getting ready to leave.” Sherlock smiled smugly. “See John, I can still solve cases.”
It was a small leap into the boat for John and Sherlock followed by pushing the remote in first and then dropping off the dock with a small thud on the boat sending it into a light rocking.
“Sherlock!! Damn it!”
The scene was odd, there were still many patrons that were being filed out, many weren’t even aware that there was a situation on hand.
Sherlock left his hand over John for a moment longer before slowly lifting his fingers up.
Sherlock couldn't help it, he was still nervous as he felt John's fingers hook under the band of his boxers and pull them down, freeing himself in the process.
"Oh, I was just about to leave… uh, is John here?"
Mycroft was furious someone could hold a gun to his brother’s head only to bolt out the door a second later, but he knew there was no time to run after him. The small flat was crumbling around them but he still turned the corner to find an elderly man tied to a chair, luckily he hadn’t been gagged.
“Frankly if the hypnotism one had I’d have filed charges.”
He was only a few steps away from leaving when he heard a knock at the door. John stopped mid step, focused on the wood before him. The corner of his mouth twitched up a bit. He had heard that, right? A knock… But no, it wasn’t- it couldn’t be- but so many strange things had happened the last couple days and even Molly thought-
“So as you can see, today is not particularly good as my brother’s idea of having fun has left me bound to the sofa.” Sherlock waited for John to be mad that he had lied, find some reason why he had to go, pretended now that they had met in person that he was wrong about the feelings he had confessed to the night before.
“I really hate you, I hope you know that. If this lasts more then an hour I might just kill you.”
This was a bad idea. An idea so incredibly bad that John couldn’t for the life of him believe that the so called ‘genius’ had actually come up with it and wanted to implement it.
Chapter 15
Sherlock looked over at where it was laying on the bed.
Sherlock wanted to type back a response so bad, but he doubted he was capable of doing it, not only would his fingers not press the buttons down but the phone technically had no service now even if he was able to use it through otherworldly ways. Besides, what would he say? ‘I’m sorry’? ‘I’m dead but don’t worry I’m haunting the flat’? He knew John wouldn’t believe the text was actually from him anyway.
"Don't you dare make fun of me or tell this giant git anything." John huffed.
Greg could feel his hands starting to shake. He didn’t want to even be considering this right now. But he couldn’t see how this frame had fallen. Where that voice had come from. Why had John been using a Ouija board? No, this was ridiculous. Just coincidences.
John sighed. Sherlock would be Sherlock no matter what state he was in. He smiled all the same when the long pale hand came down beside him offering a lift.
“Piss off, it doesn’t concern you.”
John had expressed a desire after the first time he visited Sherlock’s grave to move out of 221B, it held too many painful memories. But he found he couldn’t bring himself to leave it. Leave behind the hope that Sherlock might come back beyond all reason and logic. Leave that looming scent of his that John wasn’t sure if it was imaginary or not. This was his home, their home.
John clicked on a video keeping his comp on silent and watched as he switched from it to the skype window.
“Not hungry. I have an experiment that I would like to try though…”
John glanced at the clock; it was still pretty early in the morning.” Just tonight, I have a date.”
“I- I just don’t want to lose you again. I’ll be in my mind palace.” Sherlock brought his hands up and shut his eyes quickly to back out of the conversation at hand.
She looked as though she might just walk away at first, but she stayed. "No Sherlock- I can't let you do this. I don't want to see you get hurt."
“N-no boss! I didn’t mean it like that, honest.” He subconsciously put a hand on his gun and stepped back.
“Greg, I…” It felt like it was far too much. He wanted Sherlock to still be around so very much.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine, but I don’t trust you on you own.”
Maria ran her fingers through Harry’s light blond hair that went just past her shoulders. It was soft minus the parts with dry blood. Maria slid her knife blunt side down against the back of Harry’s neck, Harry struggled away from the touch but couldn’t do much being tied down. She barely managed staying quiet, but she wasn’t about to let that psychopath have her amusement.
“What?! What is it?” his cat ear drooped down.
John gave a small wave as he left, not looking forward at all to going home in this downpour.
Which is why Sherlock entered the kitchen to find a cup of tea already brewed for him.
“These experiments are utterly ridiculous! Not to mention Mrs. Hudson thinks we’re doing some weird BDSM stuff with a cage now!”
John cocked his head but the younger man made no elaborations. A grin found it’s way to his face, “Shall I hack onto your screen and find out for myself then?”
Sherlock slid the phone lock off to check. “Mycroft.”
John was taken aback. “What are you talking about? I thought you wanted me to help you?”
“Why not?” It was a fair enough question.
“Hey hold on, you already took it, you might as well stay now.” John went after him and grabbed his coat sleeve.
Don't worry about your wife, I love you Harry- JW
John quickly looked over his shoulder at the empty chair. “I’m afraid you’re mistaken…”
The corner of John's mouth curled down. Sherlock had done that on purpose. He knew that he couldn't answer his phone during therapy but that he also would forget to tunr it off.
"DON"T CRUSH ME!" The doctor scurried to get away from the long bone crushing limbs of Sherlock.
John let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, “But yesterday… that thing you did… how was that even possible?”
“I have to know how you feel.”
Mycroft’s eyes slid slightly shut at the attempt however, a small sound escaping him. Lestrade’s brow furrowed, that hadn’t exactly sounded like he was in any pain. He tried the action again, his tongue awkwardly sliding to the side of the damn thing as the limb had forced it down. This time however, Mycroft pressed two tentacles down on him, forcing Greg flat on the floor as he drew closer.
Sherlock didn’t respond.
.’ “Nothing important. Now, we’ll begin.” They were just outside Tesco’s and Sherlock led his test subject inside.
“No, no” John sighed.
Like all of Sherlock’s experiments, he quickly became immersed in this new one, spending all his time focused entirely on trying the simple feat of moving things. It was far more difficult then he had thought it would be, but he was slowly picking up little tricks. If an object was already in motion, it was significantly easier to move it. A door moving a bit from the wind or someone else starting to shut it was simple enough to slam shut or open, unfortunately that had given Mrs. Hudson quite the scare when she was around for it.
Sherlock huffed. “Triple homicide… and they’re less noticeable then your erection.” He stormed off leaving John beet red.
“I promise to take the blame if he is upset.”
“Problem?”
“Uh, you see…” his voice trailed off.
No Sherlock, I know you sounded afraid last night when you were telling me this was a bad idea, but you also looked so relieved, so happy, when you did tell me where you live and knew I was coming. –JW
“Yes?”
“Its fine, just leave it.” Sherlock reached for the pack in John’s pocket.
It’s late the following afternoon that Sherlock gives in, has to find John and tell him he’s ok and waiting for him at the flat. He really thought John would have come home by now. It’s worth scaring the daylight out of Mrs. Hudson to use her land line, she might as well know he’s still alive anyway. But when he walks down to her flat, the door isn’t locked and she’s nowhere in sight. Good. He can just call John and get this over with in peace.
Sherlock was annoyed, he wanted far more details first, but they would have to wait. “His wrists were tied behind his back for an extended amount of time.” The body still bore the rope burn on his wrists, his arm muscles clearly strained from the unnatural position. There were multiple knives used to inflict his injuries, though the main one appears to have been a fish gutting knife.”
John stayed out as long as possible that day. It was bad enough he found Sherlock strangely alluring on an average day with his quick graceful movements and they way he could perfectly make his coat float around him extending his thin waist and height, but for some perverse reason behind John’s imagining those cat ears and tail sent him over the edge. They matched his cat like movements and behavior far too perfectly.
“And obviously you’ve seen through Sherlock’s little charade, so how about you leave now and save yourself some time.”
You open this door now, I know you can hear me. –JW
“He’s tired himself out I’m afraid, I thought it best I stayed and made sure he was alright for a bit.” She gestured her teacup over to where Sherlock lay on a cluster of pillows piled on the floor with a mostly empty saucer of milk next to him. John noticed the tail and ears were still very much intact as well.
“I’m not afraid nor allergic to bees.”
“Er- are you still there?”
Greg’s phone buzzed in his pocket, he expected it to be Sherlock with a lead and explanation why he wasn’t there, what he didn’t expect was Mycroft on the other end of line.
“It could be a good idea. Doing something like that. But that’s not why I came. I just thought… hell, maybe you wanna go out for a drink or two some night. Maybe make that a regular thing. You’re a good friend, John. I don’t want to loose you too.”
A scream broke the tension and Lestrade immediately looked at the dead woman sprawled across the grass.
“mhm.” His face remained deadpanned.
“What? Of course, I’m fine.” Mycroft straightened his suit a bit,
Greg was gripping the sides of the bed, wincing at the intrusion. He had never felt so abnormally slick before, despite them not using lube.
“Double homicide, we were hoping you could help us out Sherlock.”
She nearly gasped out loud as she read and reread the email. It was true. Molly knew she was the only one that knew this side of John. She felt strangely honored. The emails continued, slightly more open then before. John still didn’t come home.
“Your voice… it’s very deep. Sorry, shouldn’t assume, just it seems like the voice of someone tall.” John tried imagining him in his mind.
Inhibitions
He sunk a bit deeper into the cup. ‘
Sherlock tried his best to not smile, “Ah, well, good thing it’s morning. I know what I’d like to test today.”
“He’s killing my spiders! He’s suppose to be dead already.”
“At least he’s gone.” He stepped closer to John. “I thought you didn’t want anyone knowing?”
“He’s my
“What are you doing?”
Invisible
“Thank you.”
"I would reconsider what you are implying unless you'd like to be punched in the face." Sherlock straightened his back.
“Off the table!” John swatted the offending shoes away, “Really, you don’t have to ruin everything in the flat.” He set the steaming plate of pancakes and sausage in front of him.
"John Stop! You're tickling me!" his legs uncontrollably shot up around his seducer.
"How am I suppose to go to work?"
Lestrade looked up, “News?” he hopeful but still prepared for the worse.
Sherlock sat gun in hand shooting at the wall. The gun now clicked, out of bullets.
“Left slipper, under my bed.”
Each new message made his orgasm speed up and continue, ridding the pleasure out.
“Ah, well it could have been-“
John’s brow furrowed, “I never heard anything about a storm?”
“I’m hardly hiding,” He huffed, feigning irritation.
This chapter has inches in it, the original story was written in inches instead of the metric system, I'm trying to think of a way to edit the wording of this chapter so it still makes sense. Sorry.
“Right, I’m going to go home and pretend I didn’t see or hear any of this, but one of you better explain what’s going on with your head soon.” ‘
“He’s still coming…”
‘Interesting.’
“It’s my fault you decide to accompany me on late night cases that cause you to fall asleep at work? Now really John, don’t be absurd.”
“Sherlock?” a small voice from his pocket beckoned him.
John blinked in surprise. “Come? To my therapy session? Uh- I’m not sure that would be a good idea.”
It was one of the very rare occasions Sherlock laughed, "This is John's phone, not mine."
Sherlock brought his hands into his thinking pose. “We’re going to Tesco’s. I want to see if being around people will affect your responses.”
John could feel his face going even redder, “Umm…”
"I'm on a case, you know I don't think when I'm eating." He put his hand on the table palm up.
Sorry about last night, there were things out of my control. –SH
“Well what? Oh, right. John, you should probably answer that,” he smirked.
“This is ridiculous Mycroft, she’ll wait out there until one of us come out. There’s just nothing we can do.” Lestrade had briefly considered escaping out the window, but it was far too high. He never thought he would be imprisoned in his own office.
“Goodnight Sherlock.”
“Really, you wont find it enjoyable in the least, I assure you.”
“I’m not sure how that relates to our dilemma.”
“Myc,” Lestrade could feel his strength returning slowly to him and grabbed Mycroft’s shoulders. Even now, he couldn’t let Mycroft retreat to solitude. “I have to know,”
He started sneaking out late at night. Lestrade had watched him on multiple occasions taking bags from Tescos and sporadically shopping. He never did see what exactly was in the bags, it hadn’t seemed important so long as it wasn’t drugs or something to kill himself with.
“Doesn’t mean he can’t be bisexual.” Sherlock eyed the frying fish with earnest.
"Erm, yes." The scarf surrounded the doctor and smelled heavily of Sherlock's after-shave and smoke. He found it oddly relaxing. "Thank you."
"Social call then? No… he seems far too distraught." Mycroft leaned in closer to the screen now more worried. It made no sense; if John was so sick that his sister and then Lestrade were paying visits while so upset then why did Sherlock seem fine? And why did he always check his breast pocket before and after getting in a cab?
“We need milk” Sherlock woke on his mountain of pillows to find John half awake on the sofa looking in his general direction,
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft realized she must have been guarding Greg’s office and waiting for any ‘intruders.’
John looked up, he had finally reached the corner room and thankfully it was another plexiglass one that allowed him a good look at the man he loved. He jerked his head back down. ‘
Sherlock stepped closer to his now relatively speaking taller blogger. “Because even if I couldn’t find a way to get you back to normal, I didn’t want to miss out on this forever.” He leaned forward and met John’s lips with his. Their first true kiss as a couple.
Sherlock was encouraging him to go on a date? Now he knew something was wrong. “I realize you don’t know a lot about dating, but that’s not exactly how it works. It’s not really a hotel situation.” John tried to rack his mind around why Sherlock should stay in and avoid people during this weather. “Are you prone to illness or something? I really don’t mind. Besides, I am a doctor after all, it would be best if I was here to take care of you.”
Sherlock smiled from where he had been leaning against the wall. John needed looking after, and admittedly, he had missed the DI as well. Perhaps it was time he started branching out and trying to contact others.
Of course. What would I do without my consulting detective? –JW
Mycroft huffed at his watch barely waiting for the response he wouldn’t be getting before grabbing his broom despite the sunny day and stepping out of his car. He thought he heard a clicking sound in the distance but brushed it off. He eyes narrowed at the inch wide crack that Sherlock left the front door open. Mycroft scoffed “Idiot, if the owner comes home while you’re in there he’ll know something is wrong.” He scowled at a sudden realization. “Sherlock
Greg rolled over to his back, seeing for the first time what had grabbed him. He reflexively pulled his leg back again at the sight, still to no avail. The tip of the thick tentacle around his ankle was a brighter red then the deep crimson at its base where it disappeared somewhere behind Mycroft’s back. Mycroft scowled at Lestrade’s obvious fear.
“Shit shit shit, I hit send! Fuck… I didn’t want him to know that.” John cursed at his screen.
Mycroft’s phone buzzed in his pocket, there were very select people that even had access to that number.
Greg shifted a bit, It was true, to be fair. “Well, some of those unspeakable things weren’t exactly unappreciated.”
John was flustered, “I don’t want people recognizing me… or you know… knowing I’m… a guy.” ‘Well that was awful to put into words.’
Unnecessary
Sherlock spread his fingers over the door, wishing he could be face to face with John right now. But he couldn’t even slip through solid surfaces now.
“He never came back after that, sent for his possessions. I can’t figure out why he would just run out like that.”
“What about my eyes?” It came out quite aggressively. He barely gave Greg a moment to answer before he sprung for him, trying his best to grab the DI by the waist.
ALL THE SHIPS
it usually meant something bad. He took the cup and drank it all in one gulp. To his surprise it even tasted like tea.
Sherlock chuckled. “Precisely. Just a foot. If you found that shocking you really have no idea what else one can do with chemicals.” He eyed his beakers fondly. “I did tell you we were starting off simple, we could move up a few notches with the experiments after all. It makes no difference to me what order we do them in.”
“This is one of the numerous reasons why I appreciate your height John. You are very conveniently light.” The detective grinned.
He squeezed shampoo into his hand and rubbed it through his curling hair, it was strange feeling the oversized cat ears on top. He knew they would be gone soon, allowing him to be hat free in public again and less likely to attack rub someone but he found he was already missing them.
“I’m taking a risk here myself you know. You could get confused after taking it and attack me.”
Lestrade picked the blender up anyway, analyzing it. "Guess you're right."
-Incoming Call-
Shit. Shit. Shit. Sherlock instantly started rolling his chair back into the confines of his room, but it was too late, before he could get in all the way and lock the door Mycroft was there with his hand on the door holding it open.
“Tell her… get me… home.”
“Well no, but-“
“John?” There was of course no answer. “JOHN?!” Sherlock tried yelling at the top of his lungs to no avail.
“No! No! Not at all. I’ve just not seen anyone the past two weeks is all.” The sofa shook and Lestrade could tell John had lost his footing for a moment. “Oh, Greg, so… Sherlock and I are, we’re dating.”
John swallowed deeply, a bit flush from what he discovered, but then he recalled how Sherlock had so coldly read off the name of the porn he caught him watching when his computer was the one being hacked. “Adam and Steve dot com?” he cocked an eyebrow for effect.
“Molly has no life.”
Sherlock marched back over and grabbed John by the arm “John, you aren’t even listening to me deduce what happened! I need you by me.”
John let out a frustrating sigh.
“I said I
“You’re kidding right?”
He smiled and turned to Sherlock with a salute, “Where to captain?”
Sherlock’s lips curled down, he didn’t want John to find out that he had ripped up the floor boards in search for him the night before, that would most definitely be coming out of their rent.
“Bloody hell, he has to come over here first thing in the morning dressed to the nine’s of course.” Lestrade had only brought a few things to the flat, not sure how long he would be staying there. He dressed quickly and unplugged his phone from it’s charger noting he had a text.
“The door was locked before the incident was reported and was still locked when the police got here.” Donovan had silently followed them in. “Besides, what would be the point? No one was here to see or hear it, and seems like just a coincidence that someone happened to spot it from the street.”
John swallowed loudly, “You promised nothing would have long lasting affects.”
John shook his head fondly and set up his computer so they could watch Netflix.
Chapter 12
Two days later there wasn’t a dealer in all of London that would sell to John. They had all been threatened within an inch of their lives not to let John get a hold of so much as a cigarette.
“Get dressed properly,” John said in a shaking voice, loosing his composure. He knew that somehow Sherlock wasn’t safe to be around. But he could at least keep him from getting sick for real.
“DAYS!? Sherlock you just promised me that-!” John’s eyes grew wide.
She beamed, “Oh! You should have said so, that’s good. When did you meet your friend? You haven’t mentioned one before.”
The tentacle curled away from his mate, “Its really sensitive right now.” He couldn’t meet Greg’s eyes again. Not about this.
Sherlock grabbed the tufts of grey fur and made his way up the cat, taking John’s hand to make it to the creature’s neck. He positioned himself directly behind John, placing his hands around the shorter man’s waist bringing him closer. John held on to the cat’s collar.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide, did John really think of him as a fraud now?
“Fire downtown in an empty warehouse. Could be nothing but…” he paused to see the DI was hanging on his every word. “Earlier before we knew Sherlock was taken, I was scanning various cameras when I came across some interference in that same area. I assumed the cameras were just down at the time, now I’m not so sure. Well, I’m off then.”
-You’re up late.-
Sebbie? –JM
“Yea… yea, of course.” He gently took Sherlock hand as they walked. “Sorry, uh, if that was too soon.”
Moran had often wondered by what power he had been found innocent. “Looks like he’s in no position to be asking me for shit, don’t you think?”
Sherlock’s head shot up. “Really? You… you admit you’re attracted to men then?”
“Faking. You’re not mad. You don’t care about the cabbie in the least, nor that I would insult a stranger like that, you are in fact very accustomed to me insulting strangers and don’t mind when I do it. But you almost always pretend to be cross with me, on rare occasions you don’t care enough to even pretend to be though.”
John cringed at the silly sounding username but flared with rage when he realized this was the man who had forcefully taken Sherlock out of his chair.
“I’m sure you would much rather enjoy one of the other-“
John smiled slightly, knowing what he might say next he took Sherlock’s hand in his.
"John?" He said again with out looking away. "This can't be real." He placed the skull back down and clumsily scooped up John in his hands.
-Simple, I hacked the game and created it. Wasn’t that hard actually, just had to have the feat Canny Sleuth, Discern Lies, and Alertness.-
John was rifling through a closet when he found some old board games. He had wanted a way to more directly contact Sherlock still, but he was out of luck. There was no Hasbro Company Ouija board in there. After all, seemed like an odd thing to be sold as a toy. There was however, a scrabble set. Which gave John a promising idea.
“Alright I suppose. It’s strange going to school again.” John sat stiffly in his chair looking out the large bay windows.
“986 Chapel? I’m on my way. Be there in a moment.” Greg hung up and put his phone back in his pocket. “Sorry John, I have to-“
It wasn’t until a particularly cold day when John showed up in his dark jacket sporting the blue scarf that the officers were officially done taking his insults. Their glares were unnoticed at first; John had gotten to work immediately deducing what had happened. Finally Lestrade pulled him aside.
“It’s not… like… that.” John mumbled into a pillow.
“It’s alright! Don’t panic, just a bad bulb.” John quickly flicked a new light switch on. “Didn’t mean to spook you with all this talk.” He frowned.
The D.I. retraced his steps, the last place he was sure that he had seen them was when he was looking at that damn cat- as if it was important. Sure, it did count as animal cruelty, but that was hardly his division. “Damn it you two, you better be around here somewhere.” He knelt down by the chair and table and searched the perimeter.
“Yes, now don’t push it. If they weren’t trying to scare her then maybe they are trying to scare someone that knows her and would be affected by her potential death or that someone is threatening to kill her.”
“John! Slow this damn thing down!” Sherlock yelled across the racing wind as Tobby dashed through yards, gates, and scaled up fences.
“Did something happen? Something new I mean, you’ve been doing well- at least last night it seemed like it,” until they both thought they had seen Sherlock, but she didn’t mention that.
“SHIT.” John’s eyes had gone huge as he gripped the tub to get closer. “Does is it hurt?! Fuck, what happened??” He was getting his own shirt wet now as he carefully pressed his fingers to Sherlock’s skin, trying to gage how bad the damage was.
He could also move small objects a tiny amount, it wasn’t nearly enough for anyone to noticed, but with practice he figured he could move up to larger items and moving things further, maybe even picking something up entirely.
John scrunched his nose up, “But… Mycroft?” Even if Greg was bisexual or pan, why him of people?
“How did he text me just now? He obviously didn’t plan for me to find his phone there, but then how and why did he get it there while I’ve been standing here?”
“I simply forgot to feed you is all.”
“You were at the gym for five hours?”
“I shouldn’t have doubted you. Of course you’ll figure something out.” He whispered before closing the gap between him and Sherlock’s nose, pressing his lips against it in gentle kiss.
A long and awkward moment passed before the voice came back, nervous, “John?”
“John… you… you did this to me?!” He pointed at the black cat ears.
“In this economy? Granted you are a very skilled surgeon, I doubt you will find a new job in time, besides, I am hardly requiring much from you, think of what a great opportunity this is!”
‘Sure thing. If there’s anything else, don’t hesitate to ask.’ –GL
“Maybe. But you wouldn’t rub my back otherwise.” Sherlock mused.
"Holmes, not here, really." Lestrade hoped no one had heard the detective.
“You let them out of your sight!? Anything could happen to them!”
Half an hour later Molly emerged from the bathroom with John soaking wet and began to dry him off. Sherlock was not at all jealous, he wasn’t.
“Well this has been an interesting surprise.” Mycroft held his umbrella in his lap as the car took off.
“Thanks to you.” He smiled brightly. “Now if you don’t mind I’ll be needing that package next to you.”
“It’s morning and I still can’t move an inch.” His voice was hot and tempered.
“Great minds think alike after all.” Moriarty’s voice was sickeningly high pitched.
“So you otherwise had no reason to ask her out or any interest in her?”
“No… not really. Was just curios.” John swallowed,
Sherlock started to fumble with his hands, “Jam. We really need jam.”
Sherlock took the opportunity to slide his hand into John’s open palm and noted with great satisfaction the shorter man offered no protest to this. “To the crime scene then.”
John was taken aback, “Into what exactly?”
Greg breathed heavily, “Its mhmmmm, ok. I do need it out though.” Why was flustered post sex Mycroft so damn cute? “Just, really slowly, ok?” He carefully got onto his back in hoped it would make this easier. But instead all it did was display Mycroft’s hard work of filling him to the absolute brim.
The cat came to an abrupt stop nearly flinging the two tiny men off its neck. Tobby then casually strolled through a plastic flap on the back door of a small apartment and pranced up to an empty food bowl where it sat patiently.
“No, I mean, Sherlock isn’t even there.”
“But you’re still ‘dead’.”
With a sharp nod of her head, Molly got up and procured the files on the most recent victim. Shuffling through the paperwork, Molly saw mention of a house keeper who’s stated hours fell just before the murder took place.
John turned to leave, “I’m going to bed.” Half way up the steps he added “Alone!”
“You didn’t know?” He managed to breath out, realizing that Mycroft hadn’t pumped him full of only god knew what on purpose.
“Yea. It seems something has been scaring all his renters away. We were- I was going to come help figure it out.”
“John! Where the hell are you?” He could hear muffled yells coming from the bedroom and quickly made his way there.
Despite his slow movement it still surprised John, he had assumed not being able to move he wouldn’t be able to feel either. “Yes.”
Sherlock looked down in defeat. All John wanted to do was ruffle his dark curls, but instead he stood to answer the door. Before he could reach it however the door swung open as the tip of an umbrella pushed.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed a bit, “I don’t get much sun…”
There was a long pause before the next text came and John had nearly given up.
Sherlock pulled him closer but the angle was undeniably awkward. They both knew they couldn't exactly be close with Sherlock sitting. He sighed with slight irritation and pushed his wheels backwards, pulling himself beside John's bed. There was no ceiling handle to pull him self onto the mattress like his own room had.
Sounds potentially fascinating, come to 221b Baker Street tomorrow afternoon, bring anything you might have that pertains to this problem.
Chapter 24
After the funeral he stopped calling the people he knew through Sherlock. There was no point in calling Lestrade if he couldn’t solve cases with that mad genius. He knew Molly would only cry and want to re-live the memory of Sherlock with him. He didn’t want that. John wanted to suffer alone. In his mind he knew he was the only one worthy of the private life he and his flatmate shared.
"A fire!? Bloody hell Sherlock! Then John could have-"
John had turned stark white. “I think you better explain how you ended up coming here today…”
“Zero.”
“Could be haunted,” John took a long sip of his tea, growing strangely nervous as the words left his mouth.
Sherlock had originally chosen the public location to see if someone under the influence of hypnotism could pass by as completely lucid to their actions by anyone watching, but things were not going according to plan now. “John, wake up, stay with me.”
“Still standing right here…” Lestrade shifted his weighted, “Oh, and congratulations on the whole dating thing. Been wondering when you two would-“ Lestrade stopped mid sentence as John popped up from behind the couch and came around it.
“This is Harry, I’m away at the moment but I’ll be sure to call you back as soon as I can.” Followed by a loud beep.
Now. –JM
“No, no, not that. I mean. What is this? Between us?”
John gulped nervously, the woman looked too familiar to him.
“I’ll stay in. For now.” Sherlock finally stood, shredding his coat off.
“That is strange… but I’m afraid I can’t help, Sherlock…” John cleared his throat, there was a strange breeze that only hit his neck. No… not breeze, breath. It was exactly like the numerous times that Sherlock would come up behind him and whisper something important in his ear. John swallowed hard, trying his hardest to keep from turning around, no one was there, he was sure of it.
John blinked. “Well, I’m glad we’re not lost and all, but what exactly is she suppose to do? We can’t exactly stay at the flat anymore.”
“Boss says he got you off in court, now it’s time to pay the piper.”
“Ha! The one and only time I was glad there was a head in there.”
“It would seem so.”
As soon as the two boarded the cab Sherlock sat closer to John then they were normally accustomed to.
“John,” Lestrade had a long pause, as if he wasn’t sure if he should ask him something or not. “Does Sherlock ever avoid leaving the flat? I mean, not because he just hates people, but, like he’s afraid to? Or… during storms?”
-John, I apologize profusely. I had no idea what you were doing or that I would offend you.-
Mycroft strolled down the Scotland Yard hallway to Lestrade’s office, umbrella hanging from his arm as he carried a coffee meant for the DI. He knew it was just an excuse to see him now, but he had little choice. It wasn’t as if their social circles crossed very often. His eyes narrowed as he saw the sleek figure of a woman he had hoped to never see again. At first he thought he might be able to pass by her without a word, but Grace stepped in front of him forcing him to confront her.
Clenching his fists at his side he glanced over towards his closet where he had already set out a more casual suit for the day. He wasn’t sure what John would like, but he was pretty sure it didn’t make much of a difference, people didn’t tend to notice his attire too much.
“It looks good, on you I mean, erm, not everyone can pull it off, you do…” he started fumbling over his words, Sherlock caught on and flashed a bemused smile. John raised his hand to run it through his hair and hide his slightly flushed expression
“John? Oh my gosh I haven’t seen you since…” ‘better not mention the hospital’ “It feels like it’s been ages! How have you been?”
“They do little else, and I do my best to make you look sane if it really means that much to you. Although…”
“Alright, any suspects?” Greg grabbed a chair and pulled it up beside John’s. “People he’s evicted? Had disagreements with? And ex even?”
John turned, “As a matter of fact I-“ Sherlock was no were to be seen. Had he only thought he heard his voice? Did he call out from another room?
“MMMPH!” Greg tried to bit down on the tentacle again, but the thicker end of it was now forcing his mouth too wide and he couldn’t manage it.
“Oh, sorry.” John stepped back.
He was almost proud of John’s reply. ‘I hope you realize that Sherlock and I don’t keep secrets from each other.’ He liked to think that this was true. Well, sometimes it was necessary to hide drugs. Or how he would intimate John’s dates at times. But that was all innocent enough. He never thought that This would come up, after all.
Sherlock bent down closer to the body. There was something sticking out of the man’s left shoulder. “A fish hook?”
"There was a child here when I first came around the corner. DAMN IT LESTRADE! He must have found John and taken him!"
“Hmm, you’re flush now, meaning it was something particularly embarrassing. In general or with me? Ah, definitely to do with me.” Sherlock was smiling now, he was very close to figuring it out he thought.
“Prefer it? What are you talking about? You can’t even go out without a hat and coat on, why would you want that?”
“I will be able to and that’s hardly the point, it’s mine and I want it pristine. The one I’m wearing is a pale comparison.”
When John had left that morning Sherlock did the only thing he thought would win over his blogger, he re drugged himself. It was worth wearing an ugly hat if John paid more attention to him.
-Ah, that makes worlds of sense now.-
“John?” he whispered from the doorway, maybe he would hear him again like he had that morning. But John barely stirred. Sherlock drew closer, John was breathing heavily with his eyes squeezed shut, possibly having a nightmare Sherlock thought. He knew it would probably do no good, but Sherlock tried rubbing the side of John’s face with his hand to sooth him.
“John?” Sherlock cocked his head as he looked at him, phone still in hand. “We really need to get there before any evidence is washed away.”
John hoped.
Sherlock looked up, face less red but still noticeable for a very bemused John. “How so?”
"What are we? What is this?" Sherlock asked hesitantly.
The answer was immediate in his mind, but not on his lips. Again he tried to find an excuse “Well I’m just very busy these days with-“
He passed over a ruler that had been taped to the autopsy table and a counter top as a bridge for the tiny detective to use. John sat on the cold tile counter with his hands wrapped around his legs and eyes down cast. He knew Harry could likely end up like this poor dead woman across from him, it was all he could think of.
Sherlock immediately began deducing and Lestrade strolled over to John.
"Lestrade, you are an atrocious headache at times."
Ok, in the morning then. GL
Greg was startled and immediately searched for the cause of the noise. He carefully picked the picture frame up. It was a photo from one of their cases together.
“It… could be… which would also prove beneficial. Though I’m not sure how we could help Daniel if that is the case.”
How has the doctor been doing? MH
“Where um, does that put us?”
He met Sherlock's lips with his own. "Better now." He moaned in his detective's mouth. He was soon straddling him, kisses deepening.
“Hold up- is he hypnotized? I saw something like this on youtube before.” His voice was growing annoying louder, they really didn’t need an audience.
A sharp jabbing pain filled John, the majority of his body going limp at that. Sherlock pressed him up against the wall and with nowhere for John’s feet to find flooring, he wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s waist. John’s hand flew to his neck after Sherlock pulled back.
John had a very bad feeling as to where this was going. “Ask away.” He wanted very badly to sound casual, but they both knew it was more of a nervous reply.
T-H-I-S-I-S-S
"A faerie."
“Mild? Lock, you shrank over a foot!” he plopped down in his chair, might as well be comfortable while waiting the inevitable.
-You’re a wanker, but you’re forgiven, this once.-
Sherlock sat in the cab pressed up against John with his head leaning against the shorter man’s shoulder. “I can’t seem to help it. Despite having minimal physical cat features I’m displaying cat like behavioral patterns.”
He quietly stood, walking to the doorway of the bedroom and peering out into the hall. There was no one there. He stepped back inside and without warning the lights began to flicker softly.
“Proof of what exactly?” John looked between them both. Did they seriously intend on leaving him in the dark? Both the Holmes’ seemed to be intentionally not looking his way now.
“Oh and before I forget I brought you boys this.”
“Sherlock! No I’m not planning on- oh wipe that smile off your face, I meant I wouldn’t just do that on a first date.” John huffed and crossed his arms.
Forensics was already there, gathering as much as they could. Other investigators frantically searched the shore in case evidence had washed up elsewhere, but it was a race against the tide. A man lay nude, face down on the beach, body covered in lacerations.
Three days had passed and John came home to a small brown box sitting outside his door. It was the size of the prescription medication his therapist had been prescribing to him for his nightmares of the war. Like always, the box had no description on it other then his name and dorm address on a printed sticker on top. Medicine is considered a personal matter and pharmacies tended not to let information out.
“Well that was an interesting insight into the way your mind works Lestrade. But no.” Sherlock’s gaze dashed towards John’s.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!”
Sherlock scoffed, “Inconclusive evidence, you did not overcome the command like I had anticipated and by the following day the affects had worn off.”
John furrowed his brow. That hadn’t really sounded like nothing. “Its just that he isn’t apparently talking to anyone. Greg keeps texting him.”
Sherlock tried blinking, there was something moving inside one of the wooden rooms but he couldn’t make out what it was through the tiny window. The rat sniffed around and began walking about the clear room he had been freed in. The movement was so fast that it barely registered in Sherlock’s mind. The creature bolted out of the wooden room and into the clear one attacking it’s prey at lightning speeds. The bite was deep and steady but the rat still kicked it’s hind feet in a desperate last attempt to get away. The long hair legs wound themselves around the rat quickly and hauled it back to the wooden room next to it to feed.
John bit his lip nervously, he thought they had talked online enough for questions like that already, perhaps he was wrong.
"Possibly one last week, similar death, she was found in an ally. We thought it was an isolated incident before this."
“I’ll have to get someone to fix your heater, this place is always freezing lately.”
“and my phone?”
John remembered the command for that one well, “But you didn’t say… that again after the first day.”
John was still stretching his arms out in an effort to scratch at Sally with his fake nails. Then it sank in. He was going to be brought down to the station. By Lestrade. Who likely had no idea who he was but would soon find out along with everyone else. Fuck.
Sherlock glanced at a near by clock, “Later then I thought.” He placed John on the kitchen table before opening the fridge.
Sherlock groaned, “oh come on! That was a perfectly stable stack!” He kicked the coffee table they had been sitting at, sending it sliding a few feet.
“Shit. Any idea where they might have taken him? And what about John?”
“Get it off?”
“Don’t leave!” John shouted. Suddenly terrified that whatever had allowed him to hear Sherlock wouldn’t be around again later. “I… I might never hear your voice again.” He was glad no one could see him like this. Tears streaming down his cheeks as he was locked in a closet.
"Damn, what does that woman want?" He reluctantly opened the door again. "I have already told you, John is-"
"You seem unusually happy." Sherlock slid a new slide under the lens without looking over at John laying on his back on the Union Jack pillow.
“Do I look like I have a fish tail?”
Greg wasn’t convinced. “Any plans for today?”
“Oh, it’s uh, Molly, Sherlock wanted me to ask you to watch some surveillance for him.
“Sorry... I uh…”
"You can't know that, there is no way you can." Sherlock snapped back. "This is all my fault. He kept threatening me to stop bringing chemicals home… and now he's gone."
“Look here, he’s not gonna keep putting up with you. I don’t know what you two have been fighting about this time, but he’s damn mad at you if he’s still not said a word.”
“The Thames.” Sherlock’s face was illuminated by the glow of his phone as he typed something out on it.
John woke up again three hours later to the sound of someone knocking on the door. Light spilled through the window forcing him to open his eyes.
“I know, keep calm, he’s not here. Maybe he made it out?”
“Tobby?! John, it’s going to eat me!” Sherlock struggled to get out if the furry weights realizing the cat must have been de-clawed. His hair was splayed in every direction. “I’m going to die…. JOHN! Why are you laughing at me?!”
Sherlock was dreading this. He still couldn’t get past the door that led outside. He would be alone all day now. Somehow it seemed much easier to get John to stay around when they were in his room. He knew it was likely the same reason why he had better luck with moving objects that use to belong to him opposed to just anything.
“I don’t recall telling you there was a time limit on the pill.”
“No worries.” John looked his date up and down, she wasn’t ugly or anything of the sort but he wasn’t exactly attracted to her he now found. “Uh, you look lovely.”
“I knew you would find me.”
“For me?”
“The floors smelled like they had just been bleached, but this woman was wearing relatively nicer clothing at the time, and her hands neither seemed wrinkled from liquids nor covered in the powder from plastic gloves.”
Lestrade coughed nervously, “Erm, well- is that alright with you?” he looked at Mycroft knowing he would likely want to be the one responsible for his brother’s safety. “You could come over and check on them whenever you like.” He offered as compensation, it really would be beneficial for him to stop living in a shady hotel.
last night.”
“She’s a bit nutty. Sorry. So, you were looking for me?”
Tried to fix all the typos I found. If you spot any, please alert me so I can fix them. I dont have anyone editing my stories for me at this time.
Sherlock had outwardly been adoring the new John for the past two days, but inside he cringed to see him. It was a reminder of Sherlock's lack of care to his flatmate's safety and of what he might never have again. The novelty of having John ride around in his pocket all day was a pale comparison to having his friend back. He worried constantly about his safety, checking to make sure he was still in his pocket while out of the flat. Having to remember to feed him, although luckily John had been very vocal about that point so far.
“John it’s going to kill me, please John please, save me!”
“Not sure how you figure that exactly.” He felt a light kiss on his bad shoulder.
thing to say. “We do actually. I’m frying this up for you, then I’m off.”
“You really are so very precious like this.” She dropped her hands down on either side of John in an attempt to scoop him up but he managed to step out of it. Maria’s smile fell. “John, I forgive you, we can be together again.”
John groaned internally, he must have made noises during his nightmare then. It had all seemed so real at the time. Especially Sherlock, although, in his dream, Sherlock held him. That was something Sherlock had never done and was possibly incapable of he thought. Sherlock had simply never been the sentimental type. He sighed, the last thing he had said to his friend in person was that he was a machine. He regretted the words more then anything. So he wasn’t sentimental or particularly fond of emotional outburst such as holding. Sherlock was honest and cared in his own way. John could never have asked for more then that.
Sherlock continued ripping the flat apart until he was sure he had come up with nothing useful. Just a pair of heels some woman likely left in John’s room after a date. He scowled at the thought of John having women over at the flat at all, let alone after his ‘death’ when he couldn’t even monitor them.
-Uh, psych. Sorry, wasn’t thinking when I hit send, I’m not a nutter or anything like that.-
“No, but you do anyway, like a good pet.”
"John" the legs came back up around him, pulling him closer. John ghosted his hands up those beautiful thighs and placed a painfully light kiss on Sherlock's cock.
Chapter 16
Sherlock shot him a look of pure rage. “I haven’t ‘lied’ to him.” Omitting things wasn’t really the same, especially when the subject never came up.
You’re –
Lestrade thought during the horribly pregnant pause in conversation.
John’s expression grew uneasy. “Right.”
Moriarty held the gun firm in his hands and raised an eyebrow.
“Oy, Watson! You gonna respond or what?”
“And I’ve accidentally been in my mind palace for fifty minutes. Come on, the games afoot!”
There. Just then. John could make out an almost unperceivable whisper. But it was Sherlock. He was sure of that much. But, who had he been yelling at then?
“Relax, you didn’t seem that upset when I tried hypnotism the first time.”
Sherlock gently takes him by the waist and eases him down on the floor, back braced against the tiny bed frame. “Shhh.” He wraps his arms around the smaller man and rubs him softly, it’s a calming technique he’d seen done many times but had no practicality for until now.
John kissed his way down Sherlock's body, hands gently massaging his sides. It took a certain amount of talent to undo pants without the wearer being distracted by it, he landed a kiss on the pale hip bone. How anyone thought something like this was a '
Sherlock sank into the scarf more and pulled some of it over himself in a futile attempt to hide. John rolled his eyes and let out a small yelp as the detective grabbed his arm and tried to pull him under the scarf with him.
Sherlock didn't respond but instead grabbed the wrench from the DI and went to work on the pipe, ripping it apart. Half of the whole pipe was nearly destroyed with a large rat fell out with a small thud in a puddle below.
“hmm” he made another note and showed the third image.
Sherlock’s eyes widened dramatically. “Theraphosa blondi” his voice just over a whisper.
“Of course it was.” John realized the implications of what he just said. “Not that-“
The detective lowered his shoulders. “I’m not a bad cat… I’m not even a cat!”
“You could have called me! I would have been there. You don’t have to go through this alone.” His voice was so loud it vibrated though the small hospital room.
Sherlock’s teeth gently grazed John’s neck, making the shorter man freeze. “I need to bite you. I have to.” The detective was near tears. He didn’t want to force himself upon someone like this. He wasn’t a predator. Yet he was intently scenting John’s neck all the same.
“So we’re partners then?” John smiled.
He nodded.
“And a fine hello to you to. Mind me asking why you’re breaking into my bathroom?” He shut the door quickly behind him hiding the clump of clothing under a well placed towel in the bathroom.
There was a horrible glare from the camera as the screen flashed bright white. Slowly, features came into focus. Dark curly hair framed a pale white face, sharp cheek bones casting shadows down the sides of his face extenuating the thin frame. John couldn’t help but to smile in response to the sight.
John- please- don’t, why would you want to see me after that?? –
“I saw it on tv show, one of those ghost ones…”
“Oh, that.” John wished he could disappear into the floor. “Its not mine.” He had a vague memory of the time he was caught with a slingshot in grade school and claimed it wasn’t his.
“Sherlock?! God damn it, come out right now.” John stalks off to the kitchen, looking around, then to Sherlock’s room. He looks around confused. “Sherlock?” his shouts have died off to a whisper.
“Those things will kill you, you know.” Sherlock smirked.
“About men?”
John beamed, Sherlock was really communicating with them, which was well worth the strange feeling in his hands.
“He’s been texting you hasn’t he? You keep looking down at your phone thinking I haven’t noticed.” She puts her fingers to her temples in frustration. “Just, stop alright?”
His tent and bedding seemed to fade away as water slowly surrounded him, drenching his clothes as the murky depths began to claim him as its own. John gasped for air that wasn’t there and felt the sting of salty water trying to flood his throat. He kicked desperately at the current to find the surface, seeing only a vague glimmer somewhere far above. His breath was running out as he neared what he could only assume was moonlight. But mere inches away from breaching the surface, he was ripped back down. Something perfectly smooth had wrapped around his ankle and was pulling with a force even a soldier couldn’t compete with. John quickly maneuvered himself around to pull the thing off, barely able to make out what the dark tentacle was. As soon as his mind could comprehend it, several more suddenly shot out all around him and enveloped him in their pure blackness.
Mycroft began scattering light kissed from his cheeks to his neck. He began unbuttoning his shirt to trail them over his chest as well, the tentacle still pumping into him the whole time.
Harry: Still? I might have to pay you another visit then, maybe bring a board game. ;)
“Is that what you think?”
Sherlock gave a fake smile ‘
“I thought you would say that.” The detective stepped close to John and leaned in to give him a chaste kiss on the forehead.
John was glad his size would possibly hide his blush, "Well it's pitch dark in your pocket and there's nothing to do!"
"Besides, I see no reason why you can't still go on your date." Sherlock used a lot of inner will to prevent himself from laughing.
Sherlock was already taking John’s shirt off and threw it to the side. He had seen the scar on John’s  shoulder in passing when he had come out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel before, but he had never seen it up close until now. His eyes lingered on it until he forced himself to look away.
John smiled, “gladly.” He had been nervous about political correctness, not sure what was considered ‘acceptable behavior or assumptions’ but relaxed significantly when he realized Sherlock likely didn’t know either and more importantly, didn’t care.
“I’m here.” He walked closer to the edge away from the lamp. “Watching each other now.”
“Whoa whoa whoa, I am not killing someone Sherlock! I refuse to take part in this again if you so much as suggest I-“
“My sister’s house hardly counts and it’s not like I need much anyway.”
“Yes, alright, just get up, you’re freaking Greg out.”
“I thought that one was an accident-
“Drop him?! You’re probably the reason he’s like this to begin with!” Sherlock flinched at this. “You’d probably forget about him or stick him in a jar for experiments you freak!”
The D.I. found himself, file in hand, looking up at a very tall Sherlock. Glancing down he realized the reason why. “New shoes?” he could hear a stifled laugh from inside.
Compliancy
“I’m… I’m really sorry about what I said earlier.” The detective stopped walking and turned to face his blogger. “I can’t say I’m thrilled to be reduced to riding cats, but I’m glad I did this. It’s why I had the vial after all.” He placed his hands on John’s shoulders. “I’m just not use to it yet. But it’s worth it if I get to be with you. Forgive me?”
“Mycroft? This really isn’t a good time.”
“I’m glad you weren’t wearing your scarf last night.” John lazily pulled more of the posh blue fabric over himself.
“Odd.” John’s heart sped up a bit. In his dream where he was drowning, there always seemed to be storm. He had never feared the water or bad weather before, but these dreams were relentless.
“Mr. Skull is not an inanimate object!” Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “It’s not his fault he’s no longer alive. Makes him more tolerable in fact…”
Sherlock's face went a light shade of pink. "I…" his thoughts trailed off again.
John lost his balance falling back onto the bed. "What are you saying?"
"Mhm?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Its just fabric, it will dry. And your boots wont save you from drowning.” He smirked and stepped out onto the muddy shore.
“I just bought some the other day.” His voice was distant with drowsiness.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a bit. “Its not the first body you’ve found? There’s at least one other, more likely more that you think are connected.”
“That wasn’t so hard now was it?”
“That’s not true…” The buzzing died off, sounding more like a regular human voice now.
A second fish flopped against the underside of the boat flipping it upside down in the lake.
“I mean it, don’t you dare.”
Sherlock is furious. Why is it so damn hard to tell him he’s alright?
He thought with a frown forming.
John wasn’t about to put all of Sherlock’s efforts to deduce people to complete waste though. Ok, so they talked? What else? Lestrade usually had nicer food then just a box of donuts; at least he typically did lately, not two years ago when he was still with his wife. Which seemed almost backwards, usually people only ate cheap junk when they weren’t making or buying it for someone else. “Wait… do you two…” No, that couldn’t be right. Besides, if it were, surely Sherlock would have noticed it by now. Of course he was also terribly horrible with sentiment and couldn’t deduce a damn thing if he was somehow involved in his own deduction for some reason. But Mycroft? That was just absurd. Yet, Lestrade looked like he was hanging on whatever John was about to say next.
“The phone, you said it was Mycroft? What’s he want this time?”
"These women," Sherlock cut in "They're all lesbians correct?"
“Well?” John turned back to look just as Sherlock pulled the white fabric back down.
“Oh, right, oh course. You… never leave your house do you?”
Chapter 4
John went silent as he was placed in the much softer bed. His flatmate straightened out his arms and legs and pulled a blanket over him.
"Just experimenting."
It was starting to sink in what Sherlock was saying, "My god! You've shrunk me?!"
The politician cocked his head to the side in a calculating manner when voice came from everywhere and no where at once.
“It’s not just your immobility that I worry about brother, and you know that.”
Sherlock grabbed John the second he could and held him close, “I thought I lost you.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Do keep up, he's in bed sick, he can't possibly go out."
Sherlock's eyes never left the content of the folder but a small smile did begin to form. "Naturally."
“He tells me all the time actually.”
John caught the subtle concern that shot across his flatmat’s face. “Yup, I think that’s the one. I pick that one.”
As the egg fried, Sherlock brought over a measuring stick and propped it up next to a rather annoyed John.
John’s expression quickly dropped, “Feed me?! What is that suppose to mean? I’m not a pet Sherlock!”
John was timidly responded, “Uh… he says there’s been an emergency…. I think I have to go.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose. How was he going to explain this to Sherlock? It was hard enough getting him to understand human emotions and the concept of sentiment.
Donovan adjusted her weight awkwardly, something seemed very off. When had John become so bloody clever?
"a- damn you!"
“You’re uncharacteristically quiet today John.” The deep baritone voice snapped him from his thoughts.
It was a fair enough point John considered, but it still seemed like Sherlock was simply trying to change the subject.
J-O-H-N   The planchette stopped.
Sherlock sighed and crouched down by the cage, biscuit in hand. “Do you feel any different at all? Eyesight? Hearing? Smell? Anything?” he had a look of disappointment.
Sherlock scooped a hand full of water up and splashed his face with it, letting it soak through his hair. His clothes were soaked, but he didn’t seem to notice. The fingers on his right hand twitched longingly, his tongue darting out a bit. Sherlock’s body reeked with his pain and he just needed some small release.
Chapter 9:
If the thought had ever occurred to him before he hadn’t given it any attention till now. He had simply grabbed the first remover product he found, but he hesitated a moment in the aisle. John had truly regretted the bizarre late night idea to paint his nails black, he had only done it to see if he might like it and because it was sitting in Sherlock’s room- always the experimenter that he was. Although the act of painting them it’s self wasn’t all that bad…
Lestrade was dumbfounded having no idea what was going on.
“Think about it.”
“But… it’s just there? I mean, I could just get it if you like.” It hurt John deeply to see the pain in Sherlock’s eyes.
Things weren't adding up. Mycroft scowled at the thought.
Hours passed and John wasn’t sure how much longer he could take it. From the corner of his eye he could see Sherlock as motionless as he was in deep thought. How the man could remain that still for so long without being drugged was beyond him.
Chapter 9
"Serial killer, this wasn't his first time." Sherlock kneeled near a scantily clad woman whose body was awkwardly leaning half against the wall and drooping to the floor. She had medium blond hair that went just past her shoulders, eyes frozen open looking into darkness.
“I’m going to fucking burst.” He whined desperately. His hand went to his stomach, shocked by how much Mycroft had forced inside him.
Eventually John stopped talking to the people he knew outside of Sherlock as well. He would simply walk into work, do his job quietly and efficiently, and leave. What he did once he was home in 221B was beyond anyone’s knowledge. Mrs. Hudson’s knocks and calls went unanswered, but at the end of the month she would always receive the rent in full in an envelope under her door.
Sherlock tossed plates and cups every where looking for his doctor, unable to hear the tiny voice through the wood and tiles below him. The thought of finding John injured or worse was too much. "John!?" his eyes blurred as they moistened. Once everything was off the counter besides an old blender with still no sign of John, Sherlock knew something wasn't right.
Nervously he booted his computer up, as luck would have it, it was one of the rare occasions that Sherlock wasn’t online. John grinned at his good fortune, although he supposed he wouldn’t actually be aware of what he was doing unless they were using the camera…
“Just realized how much I appreciate you I suppose.”
Molly looked like she was about to burst into sobs again at that.
“What?! What is it?!” Mycroft pushed past the DI to get a glimpse of a massive eight legged creature run through the rubble. “You scared the life out of me!”
“Anyone with basic cable knows what that means.” Greg pinched the bridge of his nose. “What does this have to do with the case?” He had a sinking feeling they weren’t looking for a physical intruder.
“Jaawn, rub me first?” he purred.
“Sentiment.” John stated matter-of-factly.
A flimsy doll bed complete with bedposts sat in the corner of the room. John grabbed on of the posts and placed his foot on the frame of the bed as he pushed all of his strength into ripping it apart. Had it been a normal bed he would likely have no chance, but luckily doll furniture was made of the cheapest possible wood and didn’t make too much resistance for the former soldier. He gripped the post awkwardly yet firmly and whacked at the limbs that were nearing him.
Greg thought back to the one and only time he had spoken to Mycroft Holmes in person. Lestrade had found Sherlock drugged out of his mind in the ally behind a popular club with two dead bodies half naked. The police thought he was just high when he sat crossed legged by a trash can and deduced the entire scene and the two bodies, solving the crime in mere minutes. No one had believed him of course and some of the officers on scene wanted to lock him up for the night believing he had committed the crime himself. He was too far gone to even protest it. But somehow Lestrade knew that there was more to the disheveled looking addict and took it upon himself to bring him into the station without handcuffs and even force a decent meal on him. It would turn out to be one of the best decision the DI had ever made, believing in Sherlock. But it also earned him a terrifying car ride to an abandoned parking garage the next day.
“John,” Sherlock finally gave in, curiosity getting the better of him, “Would you make us some tea?”
“But why? Are you going to poison me or something?” John was squirming to hide his erection, but Sherlock was making it near impossible. Sherlock’s damn teeth kept grazing his skin and he could tell without looking that they far sharper then a human’s.
Sherlock’s blush deepened. “You are my work.”
"You passed out, are you okay?"
He didn’t want anyone to know who he had become.
“I may be stopping by whenever I have a free moment.”
"Well, I've done all I can do here. I'll be off."
“How the hell…” John groaned, grabbing the broom and a pan to clean the mess up with.
-Of course, amazing even-
“Shh, John, I’m not suppose to be here remember? How are you going to explain talking to yourself?”
“I don’t particularly want to get my clothes soaking wet.” John could feel his body awkwardly sliding forward more.
-Sorry, didn’t mean to ask something personal-
The interview was set up at an outdoor café, Molly had arrived a few minutes early and took a well visible seat towards the edge of the enclosed space. Normally not the best dresser when outside the lab, Sherlock had insisted she stop back at her flat to put on her best professional attire, the options from her closet were limited but she did at last managed to find A blazer Sherlock didn’t roll his eyes at.
There was a distinct pause. “Does it matter?”
Sherlock jumped up and grabbed a list from out of his ‘John’ notebook. “Here. You can do whichever one you want.”
This was the third morning in a row that Mycroft had come over, John was beyond suspicious that the reason was more to do with a certain Detective Inspector rather then his brother, but somehow this didn't feel right, he wasn't here on a social visit. "Could be at Speedy's- there's not much food here and it's just downstairs." He could hear Sherlock dressing behind him.
He lined the sleeping pills up and inhaled deeply. He wasn’t sure how many over the recommended amount would do the job, so decided to take as many as he could while he was still conscious. On the fifteenth pill the door to the flat burst open. John was too out of it by then to make out who everyone was, just that the man who grabbed him by his shoulders shouting at him bore a striking resemblance to Mycroft. But Mycroft didn’t care, how could he?
“Oh.” Sherlock contemplated this not sure what he could ask for before John was uncomfortable.
“Ah but that’s it!” He finally understood. He looked the way he saw himself as. He concentrated hard on the image before him, and soon found he could easily change what he was wearing just by thinking. Though with no one else to see, this new trick seemed to be of little use.
‘Myc, I’m coming over. You don’t have to let me in if you don’t want, but I’m just worried about you and want to check up on you.’ –GL
Chapter 4
“Let me have a look at it” Sherlock took out his small microscope and peered though it, John understood why he needed the microscope but it still made him feel self conscious.
“I’m sorry, shit, I’m so sorry- I shouldn’t have- I don’t even know why I did, it was just there and,” It was probably a very bad idea to mention that strange disembodied violin music he had heard in the flat or the other strange things that happened. “I just thought I should bring it for some stupid reason.”
John huffed, “You’re the one taking in the scenery.” He muttered.
Moran dropped his duffle bag at the edge of the cheap motel bed with a small thud and rustling of metal. He was use to the peeling wallpaper and stained sheets of unfamiliar rooms, but somehow this one brought with it the weight of the world. He flopped down on the stiff sheets face first, not even minding the overly detergent smell. Eventually he rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
Mycroft could feel his tentacles thickening. They were ready to release again, but it felt strangely different. They were fuller, especially the one doing the main penetration. His own body arched forward, feeling his mate close to him as his breathing became erratic as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ella’s right eye twitched a bit. She clearly didn’t believe him, John knew this since he had been taking to heart all the things that Sherlock had told him about catching a persons bluff.  “You know these sessions are for you right? To help you with stress? I don’t just tell you these things to punish you, you do want to get better right?’
“But that doesn’t mean you should be taking some drug. You don’t need those to get my attention.”
Sherlock grumbled, “That doesn’t even make sense!”
John simply nodded and followed hand in hand. He didn’t hear anything the angry crowd might have said, he was too focused on the enigmatic man in front of him.
Chapter 19
John ran towards the edge of the house closer to the flame that was near being set off. ‘
________________________________________
“Oh god, that was awful, she wouldn’t leave either.” John chuckled at the memory.
“What on earth did you do to him Lestrade?” He tried to untangle himself from John’s grip.
“Mycroft is fine.” His eyes looked past the detective inspector distantly.
“It was in a fire- Why am I arguing? Sherlock, what the hell happened, why are you so small?” Lestrade was exasperated from stress for the night.
John wanted to curl up in the sheet and die rather then see the look on Mrs. Hudson’s face when she saw him sitting in the cage. “Oh my, is this a bad time? You boys, didn’t think you were into this sort of thing.”
Four kicks in and he could finally hear the crunching of the abdomen giving way beneath his feet. Once it was open he gave one more thrust exploding the contents onto the floor. He scurried off and out of the room.
“Do I know you? It’s just that some of those tips seemed really specific but I don’t have many friends.” Molly XX
"Shh, it's ok Lock, I'm here."
“He’s not here.”
John finally spotted the wheelchair sitting in the corner of the room.
Using the now excess fabric of what Sherlock had been previously wearing, he and John made it off the chair and easily slipped under the gap between a door and the floor. It was dark and colder out then they had expected.
“That I did.” He continued to scribble in his notes.
“No, definitely not that! I can’t move at all!”
“I don’t think you understand. You have only been writing about your ‘flat mate.’ You never mention your work at the hospital or any of your girlfriends. You don’t even mentioned girlfriends to me anymore.”
Twenty minutes went by, Lestrade had several officers out looking for Sherlock, it felt sickeningly useless.
He bit down on his lower lip, he couldn’t believe he was really about to do this. He quickly disrobed and discarded his clothes to the floor. A small button on the bottom of the toy would cause the computer to start playing music and cause it to begin moving, but John decided to save that for a bit.
Lestrade and Mycroft gave Grace a good head start before Lestrade put money on the table hoping it was close to the right amount and then left quickly.
“Oh I’m sure there were other times.” Sherlock leaned his head against John’s chest as John swallowed two aspirins with a large gulp of water.
. "Sh-Sherlock?!"
“You took the damn vial.” John found he couldn’t stop grinning. “Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed about being short? For Christ sakes Sherlock, you were just telling me the other day you were keen on me being short, and you’re the same bloody height as me now.”
It was the day after his near naked bath experience with his socially awkward best friend and flatmate, that John found Sherlock in the front room focusing intently on his laptop.
“With work?” Ella finishes John’s sentence.
"Magic? You're bloody nutter you know that?"
"No… I mean… I want you. Physically."
He doesn’t want to respond to that, he knows they’ll find her, but he also knows that it will probably be her cold body by then.
John looked up through the jam jar to see a massive pair of spectacles staring at him. He jumped back but hit the wall of glass behind him falling back into a sitting position.
Instead John decided the skull and gun belonged together on the mantle. The two prized positions of their respective owners. One the ultimate representation of life lost and the other a means to do it, but that’s not what they had been to them. The skull was a friend for a man who had none. John had been it’s replacement. The gun was a means of protection for them both, John had no way of knowing Sherlock had replaced it with himself as the ultimate protection when he jumped to save his friend.
John sighed loudly and ran his hand through his hair, “As ready as I’ll ever be I suppose.”
“Is he… ok?” John loomed closer, looking a bit nervous.
“If I didn’t know any better I’d say you prefer me in drag.”
“But why? She doesn’t have any money. There are far more affective ways to get her attention and other then her friend dying I’m pretty sure she doesn’t know about the other girls.”
were you referring to…”
“mhph! Not so fast!”
“It was… well, graphic. Trust me on that one.”
“Just a social call today. Came to see how you are.” He had a tight forced smile, debating internally if it was a good idea to come or not.
“John, you look confused.” He promptly interrupted Janette.
“It’s alright, it’s hardly your fault.” While leaving John’s right leg he was about to move on to massaging the left when he made a new discovery. “John! You’re poseable.”
“Fine. You have till the first.” Sherlock slammed the door and John could hear his heavy footsteps pounding down the stairs quickly.
The eyebrow was once again raised.
Greg adjusted himself in his seat and scratched at his neck a bit awkwardly. “Well, to tell the truth, Mycroft wanted me to come over and encourage you to see some grief councilor or something like that. At the very least...”
Harry did more then just crack a smile at seeing her twelve centimeter tall brother fuming mad at another man.
The second day John started showing odd behavior.
John tottered off to the kitchen, feeling rather uneasy about that. Was Moriarty back? He couldn’t imagine anything else that warranted such behavior from the two of them. He turned the sink on, letting the water rush down from the tap and into the kettle. The back spray hitting him just a bit. Even indoors it seemed almost impossible to stay dry.  John set the kettle on the stove, not being intentionally quiet necessarily, but if he happened to hear Mycroft and Sherlock talking, that was hardly his fault. After all, there was nothing much to do as he waited for the water to heat up.
“It’s the only logical conclusion.”
"Ah, asexual?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
“I didn’t come alone and it’s likely there will be guns drawn on the house regardless of your presence here.”
"Sherlock?" He quickly noted that the flat looked as though it had been ripped to shreds.
“Ex wife as I recall…”
“Trust me, you’d be glad he’s wearing that hat today.”
John turned to see over a mountain of blanket-looking fabric, and there stood Sherlock, too large to even fathom.
“Greg wants to be with him, romantically.”
The line remained quiet a bit longer until a curious voice asked, “How short?”
“Well?” Sherlock hoped for an unknown reason that he knew what John was about to confess to.
“O-of course.” He looked down into the dagger piercing eyes staring at him. Moran was one the world’s deadliest men and yet this single man could bring him to his knees. He wasn’t sure he quite understood it himself. A monitor behind Moriarty caught his eye, “Uh boss, the fire started already.”
“Well I refuse to do it unless you have a half decent meal in you and I’m going out for a drink with Greg first anyway.”
Sherlock took the notebook back out and began writing. “How do you feel?”
There was a pause before Sherlock typed anything.
“Yea, sort of. He was with his girlfriend.”
Lestrade let out a breathy sigh, “I don’t even know why I agreed to meet up with her. Final papers are still being processed for the divorce, I don’t even care if she gets everything. Sorry… that really doesn’t matter right now…”
Mycroft stepped in “John, I know you’ve stopped seeing your therapist, it’s really time you go back to-“
Some people were worth telling.
“We have every right to be here.” He subconsciously stepped in front of Sherlock blocking him from the crowd in defense.
“What if…. Oh! John, you can do an experiment to me if you like.” He sat back up. “Would that make it fair again?”
‘Lestrade.’ –SH
Sherlock stood motionless under the hot spray of the shower for a while, letting the beads of warmth hit him. ‘
In the center of the room sat the remains of a badly charred table, now collapsed on the ground. On top layed piles of melted plexiglass and bits off wood. The DI kneeled down to inspect it better.
, I think he might make another appearance.”
Chapter 5
“Perks”
"You don't have to keep living in that hotel you know. It must be adding up." Grace Lestrade sipped daintily at her Mojito, watching her ex husband's expression carefully.
Why not? We’re so close. –
“Wont affect you, I guarantee it.”
He carefully stepped into the following room, this one was clear and gave him a better look at his tied up boyfriend as he awaited death. John could see something he had only seen once before, fear in Sherlock’s eyes. He knew then that the genius had no plan of escape, couldn’t see one at all. Lucky for him he had John, and more importantly, John had a plan.
John repeated the gist of what Sherlock had told him. Lestrade nodded, seeming to approve of what he was being told.
“Oh hush, we’ll just stay in the flat until it’s out of your system.”
Sherlock continued to watch John for any sign of a social que or even hidden clues as to what his next move should be.
“Everything alright?” He placed the pastries on the coffee table in front of Sherlock, sad that he was staring intently at the ground and seemed to be sitting there awkwardly.
"What!?" Lestrade's eyes went to the nearest street subconsciously thinking that would somehow aid them in finding the boy. "We'll just have to… Sherlock?"
John heard something relatively heavy plop down on the table near him.
John wrapped himself around him, his hot breath hitting Sherlock’s neck before he licked at it and began lightly sucking. "What would you like us to be? I love you Lock."
“Wrong.”
“Oh just answer it. I can tell it’s bothering you.”
-John this isn’t working out.-
‘Just come out with whatever it is that you want.’ -SH
John stopped his pacing and shot Sherlock an annoyed grimace. “That would be me Lock.”
It was odd, in fact. It seemed that even back at 221b he had more effect on the world around him. After all, he had turned that tv on and broken a mug just that morning. It had taken a great deal of effort to build up to that. But now he couldn’t even open a closet door or properly wrinkle up a bed sheet. Something had changed.
“I’m in no mood to help you, just go.”
Donovan blushed a crimson red in embarrassment, “But… it really did move…”
“Who are you? Why me?”
“No! Stop! Stop!” Sherlock was rolling with high pitched giggles still trying to get away when he uncontrollably bucked his hips up raising John’s body up and making him slip forward.
“There’s no one else in the room with you from what I can see…”
The interrogation was short, Mycroft had offered him money to report back to him about Sherlock, which he refused to do, and officer of the law can’t be bribed, or at least he refused to be. Despite his harsh tone at the time, the elder Mr. Holmes seemed pleased by his responses. But since that night there only contact had been via chaste phone calls about leads for cases and which cases needed priority for political purposes.
Captain Hedgehog?- SH
“Oh right, I still have some cases I need to upload to it, I try to give the cases a bit of time after they are solved before I post about them. Sherlock doesn’t like me posting anything about ongoing cases.” He replied absent mindedly.
“Sorry about that” John coughed, hoping that the distraction was enough to change the topic they were on.
"You think the erm, serial killer? You think he is killing lesbians?"
There's currently 21 chapters, I'm planning on writing the bare minimum of 5 more. After that... I have no idea.
Sherlock turned the tv on and turned John’s chair to face it. “I’ll be in my mind palace, alert me as soon as you can move.”
2. My goal since chapter 13 was to make this story 50k plus. I am now thinking of attempting 100k plus, is that too long? Would anyone keep reading it at that point? It doesn’t actually affect the current plot, it would just be a second story arch. Still pocket sizable character(s).
John bit his lip “Right.”
“Hm? John?” By the time Sherlock opened his eyes the door was already swinging open to reveal his well dressed enemy.
“Er- everything ok?” John eyed where the phone landed, not sure how Sherlock’s brother could have pissed him off so much this time.
“Its too much!” Greg could feel the corners of his eyes watering a bit.
“It’s just me. You can come out.”
"JOHN! Which beaker!?" John could tell know that Sherlock was indeed mad.
“Through your speaker, yes. Not exactly brain surgery John.”
Sherlock opened a small Tupperware of casserole and placed it next to John. “I don’t think I’ll find anything here.” He grabbed a fork full of casserole for himself.
John was left to his thoughts on an empty stomach and no clothes. Luckily it was only twenty minutes before the detective came back. By then John was wrapped in a blanket due to his lack of clothing.
“But then, what did he show you the other day?”
“Just calm down, that’s why you made the antidote first.”
“Hold on-” John wasn’t sure if he was actually hearing what he thought he was hearing. “ ‘Every time’ what?”
“I’ll come back.” He promised in that odd buzzing voice.
"Oh god I want you too!" Sherlock pulled him onto his lap.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.” He went into his own bedroom.
John sat up with the first sign of anger, "Why is that? You are making a cure aren't you?"
Mycroft let out a rather annoyed sounding sigh. “Its not as if I have done this before.”
“Ah good. Your mic is in excellent condition. This should be a must faster method of discussing our tactics.”
“Just warn me before you do anything to me alright?”
“You have lots of friends. Co workers too.” Unknown Sender.
John licked his lips. “Come closer.”
When Mrs. Hudson came home she heard an assortment of odd noises coming from upstairs. She knew John hadn’t been home in nearly two months despite paying the rent.
A fire officer nodded to give them the go ahead to go inside. The two put on breathing masks and entered with caution. The air was thick and dark with the remains of the smoke that had previously consumed the place. As they walked through the wet sleek mess they noticed hundreds of dead bees on every surface.
Sherlock shot back up for a moment. “Don’t open it.”
John looked at him in surprise. “Oh. I uh, didn’t realize…”
“It doesn’t matter, I’m leaving.”
John smiled, “but not enough to stop?”
Sherlock shifted on the opposite end of the sofa, John was only just realizing he might be here. He needed to show him, confirm John’s suspicion. But sending emails didn’t prove a thing. Sherlock carefully scooted closer to the teacup John had discarded, analyzing it carefully. He poked at the cup- nothing. Placing his thumb and middle finger around the saucer, he tried his best to slide it to no avail.
“I will, but not in the cab.” He nodded towards the cabbie, not wanting to say it in front of anyone else. “You… wouldn’t have liked the real reason why I was going to visit him is all.”
“Fantastic as always.” He smiled back.
“Oh.”
Sherlock cringed at the mention of the ungodly head wear he so despised.
Chapter 7
A loud sob escaped Sherlock against his will. He was normally very good at controlling his outward emotions but now he felt helpless to them.
Mycroft nodded, pausing in his quick pacing out of the restaurant away from that much too awkward of a situation only to unlock the door of 221B.
Sherlock looks out the window and finds it’s early morning. He makes a note to himself to tell Mrs. Hudson her eyesight has clearly been going if she didn’t notice him there. He leaves and goes back to 221b, the door is locked, not as he left it.
“Er, I gotta go to crime scene.”
“It’s not that I don’t trust you… just, er.”
“Well I can’t help that you messed your own experiment up.” He held the sheet close to his body “and it’s bloody freezing.”
Sherlock's eyes widened dramatically as he spotted the hole the blender was hiding. He quickly pushed Lestrade out of the way to peer down the hole, but it was significantly too dark.
Two days passed and the only indication that the world was still aware of John’s existence were the two calls on his answering machine inquiring why he didn’t show up for work. If he had checked his blog, that he hadn’t looked at since his final entry posting the video announcing Sherlock’s death, he would have seen the thousand’s of questions, comments, and replies left for him. Some smearing the genius’s name even more, others asking if the rumors were true, and rarely, those who encouraged John to keep writing and try to prove Sherlock’s innocents. He had heard of #IbelieveInSherlock and #MoriartyWasReal, but he was no longer a part of that life. Sherlock was gone. Nothing else mattered. John Watson’s war was over; he had lost.
it was too much like training a dog.
Sherlock tried backing his chair up away from Mycroft again, but the older brother grabbed it quickly.
It was clear to John that Sherlock was too nervous to propose anything himself. "I want you-"
"John!"
Sherlock beamed and poured the majority of the contents of a beaker into a mug and handed it to John. “I’m really glad you asked actually. About a month ago I received a letter from the Baskerville testing facility asking me to help them with a compound they have been working on but couldn’t get quite right. I’ve near perfected it, but still need to test it.”
“And you swear to me that this won’t affect my life outside the flat?” John narrowed his eyes. He knew there were always loopholes with Sherlock.
“We also need jam.”
"Join me."
John is definitely not here, might as well send in forensics now.- MH
“Just go investigate the damn scene Sally.” Lestrade stepped closer to the body and looked around to make sure no one was watching. “Alright, I need your help now.” He whispered.
Sherlock watched anxiously, his notebook with “John” scrawled across the front in hand. Twenty minutes passed of intense agony. “John, this is really boring.”
A case had called for Sherlock to take a look at a couple of bodied in the morgue. As he listed off his deductions for the ever-impressed John and of course Lestrade, Molly pulled John away to the far side of the room.
"I'll be back in a moment." Sherlock had left the room and from a loud bang further away it sounded as if he had left the apartment too.
Mary pressed her lips into a thin line, “He can’t love you, he has no feelings. John, it’s ok, I know you two haven’t done anything yet, we can still be together.”
John could swear Sherlock was actually enjoying this.
John looked back up at the swamp grey green eyes that were locked on him. “I think I might, well, you see-“
“Ah! What are you doing?!”
Sherlock’s eyes darted about, “What if it was? Would you prefer that?”
“What’s wrong? ARGH! Do you even know what people ask me about on my blog? The whole city seems to think we’re a couple you know.”
“John!” he pounds up the stairs to John’s room and walks in, he’s asleep in his bed, looking distraught.
“You’re lying.”
“I see.” Was John telling the truth or was he just being crafty? It was hard to tell.
John wanted to die. Or better yet, kill Sherlock. These thoughts filled his mind when his date arrived.
So what's Mycroft been up to?
“Ha! You’re telling me? Just please give me something to snap out of it already yea?”
“You better not be looking at anything I have on there.” He could hear faint sound coming from the device meaning the detective was likely watching some sort of video.
John looked at him, not sure of the connection to the break in.
John could feel a boney clavicle, the indent of where neck met shoulder, and a thin arm before pulling away.
“Oof! What was that for? Ah, you’re mad with me.” Sherlock gingerly took the phone back. “John? Where are you going?” His shorter counterpart quickly walked out and down the hall.
“What do you want?!” Greg was nearly frozen with shock, but there had to be something. “You don’t have to do this. I can- I can help you-” He hoped, “Just let me?”
Sherlock propped her up in one of the chairs before continuing studying the evidence. Twenty minutes later her eyelids began to flutter open.
was beyond him. He kissed the soft skin in the same place several more times.
My phone does that automatically, Sherlock Holmes- SH
“Sir?”
A/N: So when I started this story I sat at my computer and said to myself, I should put the twist in the first chapter. It wouldn’t make sense if I didn’t. Then I though, ooh, I could just surprise everyone in chapter two. Then I realized, I should totally string you guys along for over 10k before I reveal what my concept for this story is. SO I guess what I’m saying, thanks for hanging in there guys and waiting this out. We’re finally gonna see Sherlock’s point of view in this chapter.  Also there’s a bunch of clues in previous chapters :D
John sat on a stack of glass slides eating a muffin crumb, "It's alright I suppose, so long as no one else finds out." John was quiet for a moment unaware that Sherlock's face was level with the table he was on simply staring at him. "That girl today… the blond one. She looked too much like my sister."
It was later that same day that Captain John Watson was shot in left shoulder, the bullet narrowly missing his heart, and sent back to England on discharge.
John’s body ached to move, “You promised me-!”
Sherlock flopped limply onto the couch. “This isn’t fair.”
Sherlock smirked up at him, instantly catching why John had stopped talking, “The way? Happily.” He turned his wheels to face the direction they would be headed.
“I don’t give a damn how big it is, I’m not a bloody doll and the last time I was near one of these things I was nearly killed a dozen times over.”
Janette eyed the offending hand, and reached to put her own hand against his arm, John looked even more confused by that. “Ah, well call if he needs anything?” ‘
“He’s… not here. He was feeling under the weather and sent me instead.”
“Do you love me?” he voice was hopeful.
Sherlock was staring at the water intensely, almost as though he was searching for something. His gaze snapped back to John in a nearly startling speed. “Stop dodeling, we need to hurry.”
A flash of fear came across Sherlock’s face as the door began to open behind him, “Sorry John, goodnight.” The screen suddenly went black before returning to John’s normal desktop, meaning Sherlock’s compute had been turned off.
The jar was covered by a screw on lid, one without air holes he noted. Luckily his size meant he had a few hours to a day longer before he ran out of air. Stepping on the tips of his toes and reaching as far up as he could he was still a good two inches from the lid, which comparatively speaking was closer to two feet for him.
“Was wondering when we call the scene closed, we collected everything we could. Er, are you looking for something?”
“Damn him what’s taking so long?”
John turned to look, the corpses were in the same places, and no one alive seemed to be around, he turned back. “I didn’t hear-“
Knowing Sherlock had a neck for hacking John’s computer simply to answer his own calls, John hurried back to the chair, placing the box under the desk where there was no way of Sherlock seeing it.
“You would have told me…” His voice sounded strange in the empty flat.
Molly beamed, “I noticed you looking at that corpse last week, the one with Vuitton boots. You’ve really been a great help.”
“What happened to going out??”
Anthea looked down at her phone. "Or rather a five inch man by the looks of it."
“Guess I underestimated you,” Lestrade elbowed John while smirking. “Didn’t know you could do that too, might give Sherlock a run for his money.”
Mycroft waited impatiently in his car. He saw Sherlock pick the lock and walk in, that meant he should have been able to find John and come back by now.
It was typically only a special occasion and in the privacy of a club that John cross-dressed. Sherlock on the other had taken to stealing John’s shoes and wearing them around the flat whenever possible and on several occasions went out completing forgetting he was still wearing them.
So it really was that serious. John sighed, knowing it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault that he was being left out of the loop again. Besides, maybe that daft genius would explain himself later once Mycroft was gone. “Fine, but I hope you realize that Sherlock and I don’t keep secrets from each other.”
John stepped further in. “Could be a hidden panel in here, is that what it is?” He tried carefully tapping on every surface he could.
“Sherlock I don’t think this is working out. I can’t keep doing this, and frankly the hypnosis has got to stop.”
John felt cool fingers wrap around his waist and gently pull him up and into a towel. He blushed deeply and hid himself in the significantly oversized towel. “Er, thanks.
“Hey! Listen, I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over me.” John’s eyes flicked to where the two long appendages were hanging awkwardly from the bottom of Sherlock’s shirt. “We’re going to figure this out.” When he got no reply, he looked back up to his friend’s eyes. Black. Shit.
“Good thinking,” He smiled at Greg. “I noticed a few plates in the cupboards we can use.” There was no reason why they couldn’t stake the place out as well as enjoy it after all.
Sherlock nodded quickly, “Get me in it before my brother comes back? He’ll try to stop me.”
Sherlock watched John’s changing expressions carefully, he would see him start to struggle with his thinking process but the calm eventually won over. “So, ready?”
“Well that was called in fast. Hope they don’t start putting the fire out before the bees die, that could be quite the problem.” Moriarty grinned. “Turned all the cameras off, we have other places to be now.”
“Lestrade…. I think you might want to see this.”
fun fact: the movie Lestrade was thinking of with witches was Hocus Pocus, where witches cant cross salt lines. There is no importance to either line regarding this, it was just a gag.
“I’m coming with you.” The detective inspector began following him downstairs.
Sherlock's voice booming voice easily penetrated through the wood but John's returned calls seemed to go unnoticed. He cursed his now miniature vocal chords knowing his only way out would be finding one himself.
“Er,” John was dreading this. He really didn’t want to lie to Mr Rogers, but things just kept happening to imply that Sherlock was incidentally not dead. “The thing is-” Miraculously, John’s phone dinged with a text at that time.
“Oh, er, I didn’t know that you knew… well, actually they both are.” Molly put her purse down on the counter and began to open it.
“What are you doing?!” John bit his lower lip nervously, he didn’t want either of them to be seen after all.
“The formula for the chemical compound that shrank us, it’s gone.”
John stops dead still as he sees the door wide open. He put his hand to his mouth to suppress a laugh. “You bastard, you utter bastard.” But he’s laughing, can’t believe Sherlock had really done it, survived his own suicide.
“No, no! It’s fine… just, I mean, you think you can do this?”
“Then you would be up for an analysis? Just to make sure of course.”
“Wont happen again.”
The D.I. sighed, “Yea, I guess I should go look at it.”
"Well you broke the beaker. But yes, there are several positives. You don't have to buy food anymore since you fill up on crumbs, we don't need to pay rent for two rooms, you wont have to chase me down an ally or rather I wont have to look back to make sure you are following, and I'll always know where you are." Sherlock smiled.
“We were already partners.” Sherlock teased and took another bite from the tupperware.
‘I could come over? We wouldn’t have to go anywhere. Just stay in.’ –GL
John had accidentally punched Sherlock in a moment of rage, forgetting the fabric wall was Sherlock, who had barely felt it.
"Lestrade look, there's a toothpick rammed through it's mouth and into the brain."
Two weeks passed and things were back to normal. Relative normal. As normal as living with Sherlock could possibly be… while also hiding a daring new fashion collection.
There was a sound like a person moaning. He wasn’t entirely sure that it was Mycroft or if it even meant anything, but it seemed like probable cause enough to him. He quickly stepped in, shutting the door to the rain behind him. His clothes were dripping on the floor, which he didn’t have much time to help. He quickly attempted to shrug off his coat and hang it up, but his mind was still frantic.
“I’m not doing anything else.”
“Please?” He looked up at John with pleading eyes. “I wont ask you for anything else, no matter how bad I want it.” He subtly rubbed his inner arm.
“Physiological study.”
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was significantly softer then when he was talking to Maria. Sherlock looked down at his palm with his full attention. John sat and placed his open palm against Sherlock’s massive one beneath him. “I’m really sorry about that.”
“That’s just one of my preliminary lists John, ideas I’m still thinking about but know you will likely think are a ‘
"Is he here?"
“Making sure you get some sleep tonight.”
“I’m not about to do something rash, look up. We’re next to the building, we just need a- ah, very good. There’s a pipe leading to the roof, likely a ventilation system up there. I just need to look inside.”
“You’re such a drama queen.”
“Fuck-” There were more of those things.
Sherlock’s hat fell off as he left Lestrade and went back to rubbing against John without a care in the world. “Never mind, John’s jumper is much softer and more cuddly and he smells like jam.”
“Lestrade! The killer just ran outside!” Sherlock grabbed the D.I.’s arm and turned him around and pointed to an unsuspecting victim of his scheme.
“Contract first, did you bring a lawyer by chance?”
He let out a long breath he didn't realize he was holding, it wasn't until then that he hear the soft pitter-patter of the water hitting the outside of the pipe he was in. He bent down to wash the sticky blood of his hands and arms in the shallow water at his feet.
John hurriedly wrapped the shawl around his neck, it felt even better then it looked. “If no one collects the possessions of that woman I swear to god I’m taking those boots.” Even Sherlock had to crack a smile at the sudden sassiness.
John clutched the pillow closer, staring at the wall. “Yesterday when I got that phone call… for minute I thought I heard you on the other line whisper my name… but it wasn’t you.” his eyes welled up with tears.
Her lips tightened into a thin line. “Unless his phone was there the whole time. But then… well he couldn’t have texted me if he wasn’t close enough to the phone himself. She peered at the skull hesitantly as though the answer was looking her right in the face. Her hand instinctually went towards it.
The irritatingly loud ringing sounded indicating Sherlock was attempting to cam. Instead of answering, John jumped out of the chair to remove the box from the bed.
“Very funny, you know what I mean, just hand it over.”
“Well he would.” Lestrade sighed. “How on earth do you get on with him?”
“Am I embarrassing too? Is that why you haven’t told anyone?”
Sherlock blinked. Was John… talking to him? “John?”
There was a light unexpected chuckle and muffled voice, “Sounds like mine.”
John grabbed the detective and pulled him away, “I’m so sorry, he’s uh, not been feeling to well actually and well, he’s a tad out of it-“
Mycroft brought his hands to his temples and tried to massage them “I had to tell her that last year when you had the hair incident. I swear you plan horribly failed experiments to get out of things.”
John scurried to catch up with his faster pace, his hand accidentally brushing against Sherlock’s paused mid step to look at his blushing blogger. He placed his hand out in front of him, palm raised as an invitation. John accepted, taking Sherlock’s hand in his, but didn’t continue walking. With is other hand his took Sherlock by the collar and pulled his face closer to his, noses brushing against each others for a moment, then lips. John placed a light kiss on his friend’s cupid bow lips.
“I swear to god if you….” John could feel his fists calling, why was Sherlock always so damn difficult?
“Good, now give me the damn cure.”
The corner of Sherlock's lips curled slightly, John had clearly mentioned his brilliant deduction skills to his sister.
“She trained her cat.” John climbed up the side of the cat and held onto it’s collar tightly.
John narrowed his eyes, he had a strong dislike of Donovan for the way she treated Sherlock and constantly referred to him as a ‘freak,’ but she was by no means naïve or paranoid. If she thought she had seen something, chances are, she likely did.
“It keeps my neck warm and I look good in cool toned colors.” His voice was monotone.
“You didn’t enjoy it?” Sherlock was perplexed. John always enjoyed his dates so long as nothing went wrong. “So something did go wrong.” He tried to think of what it could have been. “An ex showed up?”
“Yes, well, we must be off.” His hand slid down and wrapped around the side of John’s waist, “This way love, watch your step.”
There wasn’t much that Lestrade could do. It looked like the case was already cold. There were no leads and zero evidence to go on. There wasn’t even evidence that a crime was committed, let alone proof. The DI sighed, he knew Sherlock would have had a field day with this one and would have thought of some terribly clever way to solve it. But Sherlock was gone now and wasn’t coming back.
John made sure her visit was a short one.
"What!? No! That's not possible! Damn it Sherlock, where the hell is a calendar?"
He told himself that this will lead to a higher chance of Sherlock finding him, after all, Mycroft certainly had enough funds to bid for him or at least steal him. He sank back into a seated position with his head against the glass.
“Oh John, you worry so much! There’s no one here right now and if anyone comes in I’m sure you can pretend to be a doll.”
John closed his eyes and clenched his teeth.
“Well what happened, what did he say??” Lestrade was now at the edge of his seat, although John had no idea why.
“That’s what happens when it’s raining.” How was his flatmate suppose to be a genius again? “I should probably dry it off a bit more. Sherlock? Are you alright?”
"Well it's not right yet, I am surprised at you Lestrade, you know how important it is to find this child."
“I never grew another inch. Been this height ever since, so I know a thing or two about being made fun of.”
“It’s no use, you’re not strong enough.”
John shifted in his seat. “Why do you say that?”
“Yea, alright. No salting the door.” John was in pain and he certainly didn’t want to make it any worse. “I’m gonna check on the pizza, how about you look online for some movie for us?” Lestrade gave him a sympathetic smile. He needed to take John’s mind off of ghosts.
“Do you and Mycroft get food together a lot? Or does he just bring you breakfast?”
“Shut up.” He shot back between bites of his fish.
Sarah: Well you could have at least called in sick today and yesterday. I’ll just not count on you coming in then until you say otherwise.
"Ugh, I knew I should have called." Harry pulled her phone out.
“Spacious.”
John’s eyes softened, ‘
“John’s just being shy. Come out.”
“Hmm? But those are all things that only fulfill my wants. I don’t care that you can’t work at the hospital or go on dates. I don’t even feel
John opened his closet doors, realizing he really had nothing to wear. “Crap…”
"Oh it's not that. Just… you should probably cancel the date at this point."
"Greater connection?" Harry was confused and shot John a glance. John knew enough to trust Sherlock's deduction though.
“Speaking of which, where is John? I haven’t seen him around the past few days, you two haven’t been having a domestic have you?
That Friday John came home to the baritone from his speakers apparently talking to no one. He stepped in quietly listening as Sherlock ranted about his classes and how boring they were and how much he hated his brother.
“Would you… bring me my cigarettes?”
He looked at the rope again, there was something there. Something coming off the thick chords. Sherlock squinted his eyes. It was like heat on pavement on a hot summer’s day. It was a though his eyes were only beginning to adjust to the world around him.
They continued until Sherlock was satisfied with his data. “It seems I just had to find your ‘
Sherlock marched over to the couched and leaned on it, peering over the edge at his furiously blushing boyfriend. “Just come out, you look fine.” He leaned over further and pressed his lips against John’s softly. “Gorgeous even.”
“I’m not sure what I believe in. But,” He was having trouble finding the words. “Right now-”
“I didn’t fall for- and besides, what’s wrong with Greg?”
Chapter 8
I’m really sorry John. –SH
“Boss I really don’t think there’s anyway they could get away.” Moran stood awkwardly in the doorway of a control room set up with tv monitors with his rifle hanging from his shoulder.
Could his friend, just like that, really cut all ties?
“I… we need to take this off.” John undid Sherlock’s shirt, it needed to be dried now anyway.
John opened one eye lazily, “But you only have the one scarf and looks rather old.”
The detective was know ripping the flat apart in his search, almost ignoring his phone as it went off with a text.
Why John Puts Up With Sherlock
“It’s not. It’s because you’re brilliant.” John smiled at the towering giant.
“Oh very funny. It takes you forever to run across your keyboard to type and that’s what you decide to write?” Sherlock scoffed from the couch.
Mrs Hudson tisked, “Must have bumped the table, don’t worry, I’ll get that for you.”
Daniel Rogers was rather shaken up that the police had come by. He had been out at the time of the initial report and came back to the place surrounded by police cars. It didn’t exactly help him settle his nerves which had already been on edge.
The tape was sped up, a man- presumably the person who lived in the flat at the time, going in and out with several boxes, obviously just moving in. At 2:59, John pressed play, the lights were out, the street looked like it had been quiet for a while by then. The lights suddenly came on at exactly 3, a few moments later the man came running out of the flat, leaving the door wide open.
John reached out for Sherlock’s hand and held it in his, “Shh, I know.”
"What are you doing in my bed? Wait... the last few days…" John took in his surroundings. It was an ordinary bedroom though it lacked furnishings, but he didn't recognize it. "Where are we… the dollhouse. Of course." John's body relaxed, so it wasn't a dream. For a moment he dropped his gaze. '
Sherlock rolled his wheelchair out of the room, checking his watch. It wouldn’t be long now. John had always seemed so nice, understanding. He would probably see past this, they knew each other so well already, minus his own disability.
“Cut that out and help me wake her!”
He bit his lower lip and watched intently until John had clearly finished with a louder moan. Sherlock snap his eyes shit knowing John would want to look back to make sure he wasn’t watching.
10pm rolled around and John was still sitting motionless, this time Sherlock was excitedly telling him all about a case file Lestrade had emailed him.
“Now John, I really think you need to think more about your future and settling down like we discussed last time.”
"You are the sole cause of all of my breakups, I hope you know that."
“But you’ve been carrying tiny clothes and a vial of that damn stuff in your pocket this whole time?”
“Fine, we’ll move onto a different experiment.”
“See my therapist again?” John rolled his eyes.
John groaned, they really couldn’t risk standing there any longer. He began marching off rather irately, “Come on then, we’re taking back alleys and don’t you dare wander off.”
Chapter 2
-Really?-
“Yea, sure.” She blinked at him in confusion but continued on.
“Damn it Sherlock! I’m trying to punch you in the face right now but I’m not moving! Why?!” John remained perfectly still.
John clenched his jaw at Sherlock’s rude remark. He wasn’t getting anywhere near the water if he could avoid it, but as he shuffled out of the cab, he noticed Sherlock’s odd expression.
“Uh- right- uh- get back to me on if you find anything in the flat then.” He had awkwardly turned away to pretend he was looking for something important in a filing cabinet.
After the initial investigation of the flat, Lestrade’s hands were tied. There was nothing more he could do other then fill out a report and wait for something more to happen. But there was also the matter of John Watson to consider. It was the last case that he had agreed to go on with Sherlock, and he knew that John was intending to go through with it. He let Sally get a head start to their squad car and waited for John.
“I was really hoping you two could help, I’ve heard such great things about Sherlock and the last time I asked someone to investigate they refused on the grounds of the case being too absurd to be real.”
Sherlock looked at him expectantly.
“Greg told me. He… he would have found a way to get a hold of you. I’m sure of that.”
Chapter 8
John awkwardly sat across from him, drinking a cup of tea as he watched Daniel stress eat what seemed to be the entire contents of his cupboard as he rambled on and on about his life. John wasn’t quite sure how any of this was related to the case, but listened politely.
John would always remember the brief moment that Sherlock had hesitated on the ledge. Why? Why had he jumped if he wasn’t sure? Or was there another reason? The questions ate at him slowly.
That was it, Greg snapped. He grabbed Grace's Mojito and splashed it directly in her face. False accusations or not, she wasn't about to get away with insulting Mycroft. Seeing the shock on her face was all worth it.
“Er, yea? You were here for the conversation we were just having, right?”
“Oh.” He set the notes back down. “I gave you specific instructions not to disturb me until you could.”
‘Not like that. Not the way Moriarty did it.’
John felt Sherlock’s fingers cringe around his tiny body as he lay against the hard wood.
Sherlock stood as well, head tilting to the side a bit. “Fragile…”
“Blind study.”
Chapter 7
“I don’t understand,” Donovan sounded rather confused, “This room and the whole flat was already cleared.
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he saw Johns eyes momentarily glaze over or not, “Alright alright, I’m just going to drop it if you really do think it was for the best.” He checked his basket, “We’re just about done here anyway. You uh… haven’t made me done much yet. Unless you’re just making me forget afterwards.” He really hoped that wasn’t the reason.
“You can say it you know. I made sure that you will only do something if I’m the one that commends it. Wouldn’t want to be irresponsible after all. Oh, and don’t be surprised if you find everything I ask to be highly suggestible for a while.”
Ella looked up from her notes, “You seem tired? Have you been sleeping well?”
"John, you wont believe this, it's astonishing really, but there is an incredibly impressive doll maker just two blocks away from here. John? You don't seem impressed."
“Everything alright?” He nearly put a hand on the detective’s shoulder, but something held him back.
even though I have multiple times now. You have previously claimed on numerous occasions that you are not gay, obviously I have miscalculated.” This time Sherlock did manage to slip past him and trudged through the annoyingly tall grass.
“You should stay in,” Sherlock glanced at the window, the same distant look still in his eyes. “For safety.” He smiled, but it looked quite unnatural on him now. His pupils seeming larger then normal.
“Where is he?” Moriarty’s gaze swept the whole room, he clearly missed John’s jam jar.
"What are you doing there?" He scooped his doctor up into his palms before hearing the knocking of the door.
John desperately wanted to protest, but couldn’t. “Harry could be in there.”
He didn’t want to stop.
“I’m just suggesting that instead of living in the hotel that’s draining your bank account dry as you search for an apartment after you finally got the dignity to leave your cheating wife- that you could stay in our apartment. It would be mutually beneficial for the moment.”
Working? –
“Stop this now John. There’s really no need for it.”
“John’s been very good, I think I’ll let him out in an hour or so, then he can have one of your biscuits.” Sherlock kissed her cheek and opened the door for her to leave.
He looked like a child caught in a lie, “um what? Isn’t that against patient doctor protocol?”
“Are you tall?”
“She was just keeping me company. Its not a big deal, really.”
-I’m the only one-
"W-what? What's going on? Why are you so big?"
“Er, right then.”
Sunday morning Macy’s had a shoe sell and Molly decided it was about time she bought new clothes and make an attempt at looking prettier. She eyed the shoes thoughtfully, they were far more glittery and feminine then even she was use to, though she was glad they came in larger sizes. She bit her lower lip and began looking around to see what other women were buying for comparison.
if Sherlock was online and his computer was on. That was just not acceptable. He could probably hack the speakers and accidentally hear him or some such rubbish.
As John caught his breath he looked around, he would have sworn he heard Sherlock’s voice before but of course now he was no where to be found.
He frowned.
“Er yes. Uh, thanks?”
Sherlock wrapped his hand around John’s mouth to silence him, “She could crush us in an instant,” he whispered.
Never? –
If convenient, come online.- SH
John blushed furiously. He hadn’t even thought that one day he would meet the rest of Sherlock’s family and the realization that he would likely still be five inches tall only made his anxiety worse. “Maybe it’s not a good idea… you don’t want to startle her or make worry after all…”
“Uh…” There was nothing he could possibly say.
Greg blinked, “Uh, yea.”
Chapter 9
“Why do you wear it so much?”
Lestrade as well as Donovan raised an eyebrow.
“Hang on, I’ll get you something.” Greg’s body still felt weak from when the tentacle forced something down his throat. But he managed to get on his shaking legs. “Stay with me, come on.”
John put his hands in his pockets as he followed Lestrade in. “Daniel Rogers sent me an email a few days ago. It was before…”
“John” Sherlock’s voice sounded strangely off, almost like an echo. “You’ll catch a cold like this.”
“New one? But Lock… you’re all… catty.”
“We sort of need your help, we got lost and we’re trying to make it back home. Or well, at least somewhere safe.”
“Sherlock! Go find Sherlock!”
There was a long pause.
Sherlock looked beyond distraught, almost like he had just been crying had tried to wipe the tears away before calling him.
“I don’t think I can eat jam for a while…”
"I'm sorry" she got quickly before pushing Sherlock's hand away from the table. He had been cupping it so lightly over John that the force from Molly's hand easily disrupted his own, sending John flying off the table.
John was completely drained on the way home that night. He softly mumbled through Sherlock's pocket as they ascended the stairs to their flat.
“What?” he tone was just as abrasive as a moment ago,
Sebastian lowered the pipe completely and stepped away, “What’s he offering? This boss of yours?”
“You’re shirtless in a the bath under me with your gills fluttering. What more could you possibly be hiding?” John deadpanned.
’ John looked at what Sherlock was doing, his arm was completely twisted one and a half times, he couldn’t feel it in the least.
“John? Answer if you can hear me.”
Much to the D.I.’s surprise he caught Sherlock cracking a smile. “You get so flustered John.”
Chapter 10
“Stop it. Don’t pity me.”
This only made Maria madder “You’ve done something to him!”
Sherlock was thoughtful in his own way. John couldn’t help but let out a snicker as he tried to sneak read the text.
“Sherlock is dead and I’m too upset to tell what’s reality?” John’s voice had a bit of edge, but he wasn’t too harsh. “She really was just helping me out and vice versa. She… well, she brought it over after she thought she saw him in the morgue one night.” Well, now that was out of the bag.
He pushed the wall until it reached the arm of Sherlock’s chair. The detective could move his hand just enough to stabilize it as his tiny blogger ran across the blazing wood and reached him.
There was strong knock from the door.
“You’re dead.”
“He’s a cat….” Greg said with a shaky voice while pointing to the offending silken cat ears.
Lestrade quickly turned, “MYC-“ He froze.
“Six feet actually.”
“Not fine- just, alive. He counted on breaking some bones, it had to be believable.”
Finally the spider broke through the entrance turning it’s fat abdomen to the side and forced John against the wall, post falling to the ground. The spider pinned him and backed it’s head slightly before it’s strike. John grabbed the leg on him forcing his nails up the joint socket in the exoskeleton. The spider suddenly let go making a noise John wasn’t aware tarantulas could make before then. Without a moment’s hesitation he slid down with his belly now parallel to the spider that launched forward to strike and hit the wall instead of it’s prey.
“Ah, no problem, I’ll come back when Mr. Holmes gets here.”
Chapter 11
Very amusing. I meant visiting me. It can’t happen. –
“It is impossible for me to know the extent of everything you would or would not like to do while hypnotized…” Sherlock could see John growing more uncomfortable by the second. “But I will of course respect what I believe you want. Now get comfortable.”
John shrugged. “Its just what he wants. But Mycroft is- Mycroft.” It did seem unusual for both Sherlock and his brother to be asexual or whatever they were, but he wasn’t about to be the one to question it.
The detective smirked. “Well if you’re that enthusiastic about then I must insist.”
“Sleep well
“It wont be up for sale until later today at the auction house, I have to get the best price after all.”
He had wanted it to be Sherlock guiding his hands. He wanted to see his best friend in every strange noise there was. But Sherlock was gone.
“Why Sherlock? Why would you do this?”
"It's pretty hard to see what's down there."
John excitedly grabbed a taxi, making a quick stop on the way to Doyle Avenue at a small pastry shop to grab something special for Sherlock and himself. If he wouldn’t be able to convince him to go out, he would at least bring Sherlock something nice to munch on.
“Only did that to you once.” He eyed John up and down. “So you would really let me?” his voice had a hint of skepticism and  he likely would have already started making John follow his commands if it was for the strange small amount f guilt he had about earlier.
It took John a few minutes to set up a skype account, the messaging system seemed much faster to the one they used through their game.
“You’re in shock,” he turned his head slightly- which only made him more cat like “When you woke up the first thing you did was look at me and panic.” His eyes narrowed and he turned to look for a mirror.
John clicked out of his skype account and plugged the device in, the box claimed it had a range of 25 yards. He wasn’t sure why anyone would need the range to be so long, but he wasn’t about to question it as he plopped down on his bed that was on two feet from his desk anyway.
“Well I can’t let you out. It might just be a delay in reaction.” A knocking at the door prompted his attention.
Because I like you too and refuse to let whatever is holding you back come between us.
“He’s trying to trick you John, he’s a sociopath! You know he can’t possibly care about you, not really. I can take you to my place, take care of you. It will be perfect, you’ll be my little doll.”
