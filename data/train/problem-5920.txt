I would classify this and all of the sex that'll happen in this story as Risk Aware Consensual Kink, but do be aware that when the team interacts with one another, especially without Tony, there is not always much depicted in the way of negotiation or discussion. They know each other and their limits pretty well by this point, and fully trust that safewords or check-ins will be used liberally when required. (I bring this up because what constitutes under-negotiated kink can sometimes vary among readers.)
When Tony imagined being taken on a ‘date’ within the confines of Avengers Tower, he had pictured take-out and a movie,
“…yeah okay. That’s fair. Maybe at first I didn’t know either. I just knew it…you, were important. What I’ve come to realize over the past little while is that I’ve been fighting against things for a very long time. Loki, HYDRA, hell, my own damn body was the enemy for a long time there. It’s just been a long time since I really felt like I was fighting for something.  Tony told me, you know. That you could have been an Avenger years back. That you turned it down so that you could still be a kid, and because your neighbourhood deserved help on a smaller scale than someone like the Avengers could give it. That’s…way more sense than I ever showed at your age. Maybe even ever if you listen to Buck. So I thought maybe, if you’d let me, I could fight for you?”
Steve frequently thought that no matter how well he got to know any version of Tony Stark, he’d never become truly predictable, and this was one of those moments where he was glad he had never grown cocky enough to believe otherwise.
Steve has been so busy watching Bucky, preparing for the attack from one side, that he neglected to guard his flank. And now Sam leans against the doorway wearing Bucky’s t-shirt, a steaming mug of tea in his hands, openly projecting the kind of concern that Bucky would have hidden behind several layers of snark. (Steve hates that look. During long, lonely nights in Wakanda that look had brought Steve to tears more than once.)
This Steve took the time to observe. Tony had learned that just under a week ago when he’d challenged Steve’s interest in his as an individual rather than a permutation of a previous lover. But after spending so much longer with a version of the man who seemed to actively avoid seeing the people and world around him for what they were, it still came as a shock sometimes. He pressed his forehead against the broad expanse of Steve’s back.
Tony wanted to scream to be put back there, to watch the people he loved forever. He hadn’t even had a chance to see Bruce yet, or Clint or Wanda or Barnes. And what about Carol, and the Wakandan contingent, and those Guardian people, had they all made it out okay? By the time he was in control enough of his muscles to try to make a grab for Strange, however, the other man had left the room, muttering something about giving Tony space.
Ah, more astute notes regarding those aspects of his life Stark continues to be somewhat recalcitrant to share.
For the most part, for logistical reasons, the team tends to sleep separately in the Tower. There are certain patterns to those arrangements (Agents Coulson, Romanov and Barton often end up on the same floor, for instance, as do Thor Odinson and Bruce Banner; prior to the other Tony’s death, Steve Rogers most often slept with him, or James Barnes, or both), but there are also many instances where those routines are disturbed for one reason or another. Stark’s bedframe, which he of course designed, does extend and allow for magnetized additions to the mattress for the occasions where most or all members of the team desires to sleep together; they do not do so constantly, in part because the bed takes up almost the entire room, but it does occasionally prove useful.
going up there if he has to face Rogers. Something like sympathy flickers across Pepper’s expression, sympathy he suspects isn't directed at him, which is almost enough to get Tony riled up all over again. Whatever else he and Pepper had come to disagree on, she had been firmly on his side after the whole civil-war debacle. Her list of insults for Rogers was actually stunningly creative and often downright vicious.
“Okay, you were right, Natasha. That pose looks like they’re trying too hard to be intimate. Uh, alright. Let’s try the one where you’re standing behind Tony, Steve, but not touching him.”
For several long moments, one robot (oh, no, two robots—Drama the robot llama had emerged from the bedroom to investigate), one modified Iron Man suit, seven humans and one god surveyed one another in complete silence. (Well, almost complete. Dummy was still offering his account of things to anyone who would listen, and Drama was now egging him on.) When Tony finally spoke, it was a rasping, destroyed whisper.
I hope you all enjoyed the chapter, and that you have a wonderful weekend. I remain endlessly grateful for and delighted by your comments, questions, and kudos. I couldn't ask for a more awesome bunch to have taken the long journey of this story with!
Tony was not remotely a fan of this plan. He wore irony and bullshit (and, apparently, the passive voice) like second skins, he couldn’t just…shed them the way Phil was suggesting. He wasn’t a damn snake, and what Phil was asking was much. Except he wasn’t even asking. There had been no hint of a question in his instructions just now, no sense that perhaps this was something Tony couldn’t accomplish.
All eyes have been on the Avengers since Tony Stark’s press conference on Tuesday in which he revealed that Howard Stark, as well as several key figures at Stark Industries, were involved in a decades-long cover up of research suggesting the need for widespread reform to labour and its intersections with orientational needs.
Tony stepped inside the door Bucky had stopped them in front of with no small amount of trepidation, and was greeted by walls of a warm, dusky pink; it was a few shades off from the colour Peter had once insisted was ‘millennial pink,’ but still a gentle enough hue that Howard undoubtedly would have been horrified. There were some tools that had a dungeon-y kind of air to them; he recognized the spanking bench he’d been on during his punishment, and there was no way the curved couch that sat in one of the corners of the room wasn’t somehow a sex thing. A table resembling the benches Bruce used for check-ins back at the Tower was folded up in an open closet. There were rigs in a couple of places too, he thought, for some kind of bondage, though he would have needed more than a cursory glance to make a guess at how they would work.
Even if Tony hadn’t witnessed the team training together, it would have been obvious within minutes that they were a far more cohesive unit that Tony’s version of the Avengers had ever been. They functioned seamlessly, not just combining their individual talents but truly working together. Some of the results were truly spectacular—like when Thor channeled his lightning to super-charge one of Clint’s arrows, or when Nat and Barnes pulled off a series of moves where one of them pretended to narrowly miss a shot as a distraction to that the other could come in from behind—but Tony’s favourites to watch were the small moments that made it clear just how well these people knew one another. Half the time they didn’t even have to announce their positions or actually request back-up; they’d clearly practiced formations enough that they could just act and trust that their teammates would be where they were supposed to be.
“I just thought if Tony stayed here on Thursday it should be clean, that’s all.” Bucky arched a skeptical brow.
“Sir, the person in question was making private contact in order to warn the team in advance that Captain Rogers is in moderately severe Dominant deprivation.” Well that…that changed things. Tony glanced at the screen, desperately seeking any evidence at all that the battle appeared to be wrapping up. But the remaining owls were now capable of reproducing and triggering some kind of rapid growth cycle; several of them were now large enough that they were capable of teaming up to lift Thor off his feet by his cape, causing him to bellow in outrage. “Sir? I can contact Ms. Potts. I’m sure under the circumstances she would agree that the slight risk of your exposure to the public is outweighed by the discomfort it may cause you to attend to Captain Rogers in such a state.”
This would normally have been the point where Coulson would have taken charge; Phil took his position as the team’s handler very seriously, and he was always the one to step up if the others were struggling. But something about his interaction with Tony seemed to have spooked the agent; he remained quiet and nearly motionless, still seated in the same chair he’d been in when Tony had fallen into his lap. Natasha had attempted to pull Clint aside, but Steve knew the look on her face. The thin lips, the hooded eyes, the fact that she alone had yet to holster her weapon…they were the traces of the Red Room, and of the decade that had followed filled only with suspicion and blood. Natasha wanted something practical, likely bordering on cruel (or she wouldn’t have avoided saying it to the room at large.) Steve held her in place with a single dark stare.
Which was how, roughly fifteen or so minutes later, Steve wound up settled in Tony’s bed. Well, settled was perhaps an inaccurate descriptor, given that the guy was a stiff, unmoving line next to Tony, and that one of his hands was still gripping the handle of the shield which was propped against the nightstand next to him. Tony only bothered to attempt sleep for around ten or so minutes before turning over and pressing himself against Steve’s back. It should have felt absurd to play at being the big spoon, but as big and unimaginably strong as Steve was, there was still a delicacy to the narrow span of his hips, the softness of his skin, his long artist’s fingers…
“What’s really a shame, Morton, is that if you had actually used your brain this might have been the one time you stood a chance against Steve Rogers. He was tired. He was distracted. He was sloppy.” Natasha leapt down onto the mat in a single, sinuous motion and strode over to stand above Alex, who was still writhing on the mat and glaring up at her through the tears in his eyes. “Next time focus less on trying to come up with a good one-liner and more on your ground attack. Tall hunks of muscle like Steve are top-heavy, and if you can make that weight work for you instead of against you…well, you might not have a shot but at least you won’t embarrass yourself. Now get your ass to medical before I decide to pick up where Cap left off.”
“I wasn’t sure whether you knew that you had an arachnid twin out there and were trying to protect her, or if you really had no idea. Judging from the bug-eyed thing you have going on right now—heh, bug-eyed, get it?—I’m going with option b.”
. He added a coffee cup emoji, and the Pepper Potts emoji he himself had made, and then sent it off to Steve without letting himself think too hard about it.
He did in fact clutch at the three of them again pretty much the second Thor had finished wiping Tony and Phil down. And he kept clinging, even once the crying was over and every touch stopped feeling like a shock on his over-sensitive skin. He made a couple of attempts to do something about Phil and Thor’s hard-ons, but was not all that surprised to find his attentions gently refused. The team clearly had an agenda today, and unless any part of it put Tony into actual distress, he was pretty sure they wouldn’t be deviating.
She’d been on the mission last night, he recalled vaguely, though the tension in her frame seemed to speak to something beyond tiredness. As the gathering concluded (one of Steve’s favourite things about the Wakandan army was how little patience they had for bureaucracy for its own sake—they were efficient in the extreme) Steve wound his way through the crowd toward his Agent.
The chapter also contains what I can only describe as unintentional gaslighting on the part of the team toward Steve. They're not doing it on purpose, they genuinely think his worry about Tony has more to do with Steve's well-documented own issues, but it's obviously still not great of them. If you need a redacted chapter or have other questions or concerns, feel free to drop me a line as always.
“The Bleeding Edge armour is as close to indestructible as it gets. The nano-machines self-replicate, so as long as their connection to a power source isn’t interrupted or disconnected, they can transform or heal most damage. Everything you see that I haven’t been able to fix yet took actual universe-ending conditions to bring about. So don’t for one second think that because I’m a little more tired and old and banged up than the other me was that I can’t handle what’s coming for us.”
Shortly before the Snap, Pepper had accused Tony of putting the women in his life on pedestals. He had responded by truthfully telling her that it was hardly his fault that pretty much every woman in his life was equal parts impressive and terrifying. Rasa Chimva did not look to be in any way a deviation from that trend. The number of letters after her name rivalled Tony’s own, and combined with Wakanda’s vastly superior medical knowledge and technology, he could barely understand some of her more recent publications. The fact that she was glaring suspiciously at Tony did not help matters either.
“The first step in this kind of therapy,” Domen continued, “is for the patient to process the event story of the death. Understand, Steve, that I am familiar with the facts of Tony Stark’s death. I have seen every bit of footage that exists, read every report, reviewed each and every picture. I am not asking you this out of some sense of voyeurism, or because I have not prepared for our sessions. What matters to me is knowing your narrative, the story that you tell yourself about this loss you have faced.”
He woke on board the Wakandan jet, and debated for less than a minute before placing the call. Natasha, per usual, seemed unsurprised to hear from him, though her voice betrayed more stress than she would normally allow to come through.
Hmm. Now, it is true to some extent that I cannot risk the future I have seen by sharing too many details. But it does seem innocuous enough to share, say, some relevant headlines from major news outlets around this date 5 years in the future.
However, part of the reason that the OCS eventually incorporated social as well as biochemical and hormonal assessments was that it started to become clear that factors beyond the strictly physical did play a role in how a person experienced their orientation. While this remains currently unconfirmed, Steve Rogers has long suspected that his time with HYDRA has altered James Barnes’ orientation. (This is not to say that anyone who faces trauma would become more submissive; indeed many might respond just the oppsosite way. And shifting on the OCS in adulthood as Rogers assumes Barnes has done would be exceedingly rare. The point is merely that one’s experiences and attitudes do seem to have an impact on where one lands on the OCS.)
you or something. I recognize that even if you did share our Tony’s orientation you still might not have had any interest in joining us in a romantic or sexual capacity. That you are not in fact a submissive, nor any other recognized orientation of this universe, might make that more likely and it might not. Our Tony’s relationship to his orientation was…complicated. But that doesn’t mean we can’t be your friends and your teammates. We can help you with this. Bruce could teach you anything you want to know about the science behind how orientation works here. Natasha, Clint and I could teach you about the way it impacts things like body language and diction and clothing choices. While Asgard operates under some similar conditions, our orientation classification system is by no means identical to ours, so Thor would have a lot of insight to offer about how to adjust. As would Bucky and Steve, in their own—”
And because it still wasn’t enough to have remade himself in his own image, then it had been Pepper’s turn. Which meant putting everything he’d learned all together, plus adding in Steve. They had been trying out different positions for everyone to stand in during the press conference for the last hour and thirty seven minutes (and yes, Tony was counting every second of this hell.) Both Cap…no, Steve, he needed to get used to calling the guy Steve again. Steve and Tony had steadfastly refused to kiss one another on camera, but pretty much every other variation had been tried and attempted: Steve’s arm around Tony’s shoulders, his waist, their hands joined, Tony and Steve bracketing the rest of the team, Steve and Tony facing each other like they were on the cover of a romance novel…it was fucking horrible. And Steve’s nearness meant Tony could feel him getting stiffer and more frustrated as the posing went on.
“Kid, get down to the shop and stay there until I arrive. Remain in the suit with the taser webs active. JARVIS, nobody in or out; defend with extreme force.”
“Safety goggles!” bellowed at least three separate voices, and that was it. This was officially not just an alternative dimension, but some kind of bizarre wish-fulfillment world Tony’s brain had generated for itself.
“I will if that’s really what you want. I can even fly you back home. I have more experience than the muscleheads downstairs, but they have enough field training that Bucky could probably manage to follow Bruce’s directions without screwing it up too badly.”
The rest of check-in proceeded in the same fashion, Tony’s mind warring between the comfort of the familiar routine and the frustration of the punishment. When he finished his usual procedures, however, Bruce didn’t seem in any hurry to get Tony off the bench and on his way. He circled around the table and dragged a nearby chair across the floor until he was seated near Tony’s head.
. Tony had grown to regret much about his impulsiveness, his willingness to deal with the consequences as they came rather than spelling them out ahead of time. But there had still been a kernel of truth in what he’d said to JARVIS that day, and nothing, nothing that had come after would ever take away the sheer and uncomplicated joy Tony had felt when he’d flown for the first time.
At first he tried to enjoy the quiet. Tony had never been the type of person to want company just for the sake of it, after all, and he’d gotten even better at being alone after the War had all but emptied out the Tower and the compound. He drank a whole pot of coffee without the weight of Bruce’s faintly disapproving stare (and then he cleared the plate of scones because the goddamn things were delicious.) He watched the morning news, a habit he’d taken up since arriving here because watching the anchors spend ten plus minutes on stupid shit like which celebrities had broken up and where traffic was particularly backed up was such a fucking miracle compared to the somber disbelief that had coloured all post-Snap media. He munched on the berries while Dummy chased him around the room with a blanket (which his wayward bot had somehow become convinced over the past several days solved all the world’s ills.)
“Also backwards,” Tony agreed. “But he needs the Dominance more than he’s been getting it lately.” Bucky arched a brow and crawled his way to Phil. Coulson, who had been laughing seconds ago at the subs’ antics, now wore a wide-eyed, animal-in-headlights expression. Steve, who had been on the other end of Bucky’s disapproving stare more times than he could count, winced in sympathy even as he wanted to dig for more information about what Tony had said. Had Phil really been needing more than he’d been getting?
“Meaning?” Clint’s free hand ran through his hair, leaving the short blonde locks messier than before.
“I’m saying I want to give you back the choice, Tony, or as much of one as we can. We have a few days until the press conference. I’m suggesting we—” Steve swallowed, just barely, passed the lump in his throat. “I’m suggesting we put things between us on hold. You spend those days however you need. Try to find a way back to your own universe if that’s what you want. Stay here, don’t leave the Tower, and spend it all eating ice cream and remembering the things you lost. Journalling is—well I’ve found it effective, anyway. Whatever you need, just let yourself be selfish for once and just
Before he knew it, two days had past, and Tony had barely had time to think about the Dinner at all. He’d been gloriously busy, flitting between suit upgrades (he’d had a breakthrough with Natasha’s that he could hardly wait to show her), after-action reports (Thor wrote the best ones, hilarious and poetic and overwhelmingly sweet)), and more background reading on the SWORD project. Phil was happy to be as involved as Tony wanted on any particular day; sometimes that meant they didn’t see each other until end-of-day check in, and others they spent virtually the whole time together, Coulson completing paperwork in the shop so he could provide feedback on weapon and suit upgrades, or talking Tony through some of the Avenger’s past missions that the reports themselves had trouble capturing.
The relief that accompanied the release was a gradual, incomplete thing, nothing like the sudden finality of orgasm. But it rippled through his entire body like an all-encompassing wave of pleasure that threatened to swallow him whole.
Content Notes for this chapter: Steve encounters a submissive whose continued employment is conditional on her acceptance of some degree of submission in her private life. (We're not given a specific reason for her rejection of her headspace, but we do know that she's not fully comfortable with it, and is being forced per the terms of a mandatory wellness policy to find some kind of an outlet because prolonged sub/dom deprivation can seriously impact one's overall health in this universe. The same would be expected of a dom in a similar situation, as we sort of saw with Steve last chapter.) This is mainly a world-building scene, though there are some parallels with the now-deceased version of Tony. So if you wan to skip it, stop reading at the paragraph beginning "Talia. What
“Unfortunately I’m going to join the scouting team tonight. Please pass my regards to the General…I’m sorry, I don’t think we’ve met before. May I request the honour of your name?” It was highly formalized query, but one Steve had grown used to making. Many Wakandans, especially those in the military or government branches, chose not to provide foreigners with their names upon first meeting. They used only titles or ranks until they felt the person had earned the intimacy of names often bound up in generational and national legacies that had, until recently, been jealously guarded secrets. Many in the international community read it as arrogance, or a desire to return to Wakanda’s isolationist days. To Steve, who was rarely called by anything but his titles except by the people he kept closest to him, it made nothing
“So tell me everything we have on this new contractor, then. How are w—you guys going to take him down?”
“Ow fucking hell. What the hell do you mean Rescue is here? Why would she have left Pepper? I swear to all that is good and pure if there’s a glitch we missed during the diagnostics I will absolutely lose it. Let her in.”
Do you regularly work 8+ hour days without access to orientation-based interactions? Do you frequently find yourself feeling unstable or unwell by the time your shifts are complete? The Orientational Research Collective at Berkley University is urgently seeking participants for a twelve month study designed to determine the mental, emotional and biochemical effects of the standards workday on orientation wellness. Peoples of all orientations, as well as gender, sexual, racial, ethnic, and religious identities are welcome to apply.
. Yes, by quirk of fate or whatever the hell was at play here, you look and act a lot like the guy they used to love, but you’re still separate entities whose needs and desires and experiences may vary drastically.”
Tony was ashamed, even before he opened his mouth, of what he asked next. Whatever else Barnes was, this version of him was suffering. Mark II’s loss had cut him deeply, and he was still offering these deeply personal accounts of the time that had immediately followed without complaint.
“Why though? I mean I know you’re Mr. Morality, but it’s not like I’m skimming answers off some guy sitting next to me in a test, Rhodey. He was me.”
A bit of tardiness was not unusual, but the longer Peter waited, the more anxious and guilty he started to feel. Had Gwen been so hurt by his not attending her show that she’d skipped out on practice entirely? She didn’t seem like the type to take things so seriously at such an early stage, but Peter was also a complete novice when it came to dating. As he pondered the likelihood of his own jerkiness, he made the mistake of making eye contact with Flash. The other boy wasted no time in realizing that Peter was still without a partner.
him. I know some of that shit is necessary for the press, but that makes it even more important that it not creep into the rest of your life. You’re
have gone insane. Even people whose levels have stabilized, when they’re denied access to the things they need to access their headspace, they lose the will to live. Most of them stop eating and drinking within a couple of months.” Starvation and dehydration were way too recently familiar to Tony (
It is blessedly easy to get in contact with General James Rhodes, and even easier to convince him to return to the compound. The words ‘Steve knows about Tony’ are barely out of Sam’s mouth before he hears Rhodes is briskly ordering someone to make preparations for his departure.  That’s the good news.
It was the best scene…well, series of scenes, really, that Tony had ever been involved with. And still, all through the glorious hours of aftercare, that sense of anxiety from before didn’t fully dissipate. The sex had been incredible, of course it had, but he’d thought…well, for a while there it had felt like they were going somewhere further with all of it. Whatever he’d been hoping for (okay, he knew what he’d been hoping for, what he’d been fixated on for weeks now if he were really honest) never came. He was basically himself again by dinner the next day, and mentally planning a days-long binge in the shop to try to work through the absurd disappointment he felt. He had partners, more than one of them, who loved and adored him. He could learn to let that be enough, couldn’t he?
Even hours later when he and Steve returned to the Tower, Tony wanted to crawl out of his skin. Sunset had been the closest he’d ever come to letting his true orientation come through in a relationship. It had been she who had taught him all the fussy, old-world poses and words, who had provided a thorough introduction to all the possible tools and tricks that could possibly be used to punish a sub. She had never strayed toward actual non-consent; it would be virtually impossible for any Dominant, especially one with such a high classification. But much like Tony himself, Sunset had learned to sublimate some of her own instincts in the interests of business; the Dominant desires to protect and nurture were twisted into drives to control and to manipulate. Without Rhodey, Tony might never have gotten the hell out of there before revealing who and what he really was; thank fucking Christ for Rhodey.
Having actually entered the building, Pepper thought she was through the worst of the stress. Once she decided on a path, she usually didn’t struggle to remain committed to it. Then a red-faced and furious Clint Barton met her at the penthouse elevator.
The conversation that followed, where Masdee explained what she understood of the scientific and technological intricacies of the barrier, felt as intimate as watching two people kiss or make love. The rest of the Wakandan contingent surveyed the scene, occasionally looking to Steve uneasily as if expecting him to intervene, maybe to even accuse Masdee of being inappropriate. But how could he possibly do that when he could practically witness the world, bright with potential and excitement, unfolding in front of these women? He didn’t know how this would work, what negotiations or compromises would be required; he’d lost too much to believe that a promising present guaranteed anything about the future. But he did know that he had no interest in trying to stifle any of the possibilities.
Some part of Tony must have assumed aftercare wouldn’t be as important a part of this to Clint as it had been to Bruce, because he was stunned by what unfolded over the next several hours. Clint washed them both down with a soft, wet cloth, and then insisted on giving Tony a full body rubdown. It was evident within minutes that Clint hadn’t been trained; he didn’t touch with the gentle skill of a professional, but with the targeted focus of a soldier, someone who knew major muscle groups primarily in the context of treating them after injury or strain. It still felt damn good, and he talked almost constantly to Tony as he did it, practically showering him with the praise and affection he’d been so sparing with during the scene. (And he didn’t seem offended or even particularly alarmed that Tony cried a couple of times, either.)
“Well I’m not dead, so that’s pretty fucking awesome. Except for those of you who may be losing money in some kind of pool—”
In terms of being flexible with myself, I find this happens mostly with pacing. I used to try to keep myself pretty strictly confined to the chapter outlines I made; if something was supposed to happen in a single scene, then it stayed that way no matter what. Now I try to listen to the characters a bit more as I write, and stay a little more flexible. If something was supposed to be a chapter but it need more time to let it breathe, I let it go longer (the non-sexual submission stuff is a good example of this); if something was supposed to be a multi-chapter arc but suddenly it feels like it would be fine to cover in a scene, then I don’t try to stretch it out just for the sake of sticking to the outline.
“Over a decade ago now I stood up in front of the world and I announced that SI would no longer be manufacturing weapons. How many of you started updating your resumes?” Pepper raised her hand with exaggerated speed, and Tony glared in mock betrayal. Her candour had paid off, however; most of the room had their hands in the air with her. “Et tu, Potts?” Pepper shrugged, clearly unrepentant. “Anyway. You might have questions, you almost definitely had doubts, but you stuck around. Everyone here stuck around, or came to SI afterward as we were trying to figure out what our new direction would be. And then, as a thank you, I turned around and did the same damn thing to all of you. Just over a month ago I stood up and told people about Howard Stark—who he really was, what he valued, and what he was willing to sacrifice to get there. Our company bears his name, and the weight of his legacy good and bad, so I knew that it would have an impact on more than just myself. While it wasn’t news I could safely share with you ahead of time for reasons that are probably pretty obvious, I know the shock was probably still a particularly unpleasant one.
“You have nothing to apologize for. We’re the ones who assumed instead of asking you what you needed. However, I don’t think any of us plan on making that mistake with you again, Tony. So take in all the information you can during these sessions, learn to play the game the way you’ll unfortunately need to. But you’ll need to start thinking, too, about what it is you
“I texted him yesterday to ask if he wanted to grab some lunch, but JARVIS implied that he was busy with something for Coulson.”
Bucky had emerged from HYDRA as someone who not only liked, but sometimes needed brutal forms of domination, particularly intense impact play. The first time Bucky had limped his way out of Natasha’s bedroom after moving into the tower, covered from head to toe in bruises and marks and bites, Steve had lost it at her; Bucky, in turn, had screamed at Steve, reminding him that people’s needs and desires changed, and that if Steve was gonna be an asshole about it then ‘he didn’t have to fuckin’ be there.’ Terrified of losing Bucky, and the fledgling bonds the team had just been starting to build by that point, Steve had sworn to keep his mouth shut. (It wasn’t like he was against whatever forms of submission worked for all parties, anyway; it had just been hard to see Bucky
The last section of the chapter also involves a sexual scene with most of the team. (Bucky chooses only to observe.) At Tony's request, it includes elements of exhibitionism and humiliation. The latter is fairly gentle as humiliation kinks go, but still might be worth skipping if that's not your jam. (If you want to do so, stop reading at the section that ends "so it doesn't turn into something worse, okay?") As always, let me know if you have questions or concerns. And remember, too, that while I do my best to depict ethical and consensual relationships, it's always okay to nope out if your definition of what that looks like differs from mine.
“But he was already more,” Peter protests, the anger that’s been smoldering inside for months not willing to give up so easily. “He had you, he had me and Harley—”
Pepper's living arrangements turned out to be the easy part. She consented heartily to moving into the Tower, provided that her Dominant (Sharon Carter, which, oh boy was Steve coming back to that one later!) would be permitted free access as well. The Tony side of things turned out to be rather more complicated.
Tony was casually leaning over to refill wine glasses, and he was smiling, but something made Peter suspect the question was not quite as nonchalant as it sounded.
The Avengers await the coming storm while Tony re-discovers his hatred of mornings. (Well, most mornings.)
These were among the last words Tony wanted to hear as he lay sprawled across Rhodey’s lap. His stomach ached pleasantly from a mix of food and laughter; after lunch they had been joined by the rest of the team, and Rhodey had just finished explaining to an incredulous Thor that the salmon he’d provided Tony with was in fact different from Swedish Fish, Thor’s second favourite snack of choice. On any other day he would have been happy to sink fully into a state of indolent pleasure, drifting in and out of awareness as he enjoyed simply being without the weight of any expectations.
“When we fought, he didn’t recognize me until about halfway through. When he did, he said my name. Like—like we had a history, like he…
I don't think any content notes are needed for this one! So instead I'll take a moment to clairfy something that has come up a couple of times in comments: in the version of the MCU that our Tony comes from, he and Pepper never got back together after their 'break' between Ultron and Civil War. This was purely a practical call on my part; I just couldn't see Tony not fighting with everything he had to get back to a wife and a kid if he had them, no matter how great other aspects of the D/s verse might have been for him.
Today wasn’t exactly the same. Howard hadn’t planned on bringing Tony down here, but one of his regular assistants had needed to go home to attend to his submissive. She was classified at a one, which meant sometimes she had very high needs. Most people talked about subs, especially subs classified that close to True status, in hushed, reverent tones. But when his Dad explained why Damien had had to leave, it didn’t sound like that. He sounded…sorta mad, or grossed out, maybe, like that time Tony had presented Mom with a collection of rare insects.
The room was silent for close to two minutes. Tony ate, and tried very hard not to stare, or to fill the silence the way that a childhood in high society had basically trained him to do. Eventually, Clint’s hand was on Tony again; this time, there was no mistaking his touches as anything but definite and purposeful, because Clint dragged two fingers lightly all the way up Tony’s forearm, pressing unerringly down on Tony’s medial nerve once he neared his wrist. His hand twitched like he’d been shocked, and Clint arched a brow.
May’s voice echoed around the cavernous and mostly empty confines of Peter’s new room in Avengers HQ. The newly rebuilt compound was mostly a carbon copy of the one that had been destroyed during the Battle for Earth, a fact which Peter would have known even had General Rhodes not told him when the team had been trying to sell Peter on the move. Every inch of the place that he’d seen so far practically screamed Tony Stark in its befuddling mix of opulence and thoughtful practicality. The former was frequently used to mask the latter, like the way that the futuristic glass and chrome nightstand made it easy to miss the light therapy lamp that sat atop it, or how the astronomically high thread count of the sheets drew attention away from the weighted comforter on top of them. Peter wondered sometimes if Tony had ever learned to care for someone openly, without using the showy flash of wealth or status as a cover. (When he really wanted to hurt himself, Peter wondered if Tony had found that kind of openness in the other universe. Was that why he’d stayed?)
“You’re leaving them.” Tony spluttered, made a vague attempt at denying and deflecting, which she swatted away like they were particularly irritating insects. “Don’t bother, I know it’s true. Have they…did they hurt you?”
He wanted to say no. He nearly did. But Tony’s frustration seemed to go beyond his usual annoyance at having to voice emotions or preferences, and when Steve turned to look back at the contract, his eyes found the long column tracking experience. Almost everything was marked ‘No.’ A few had question marks, or were annotated with definitions and descriptions Tony had clearly pulled off the web.
“They say here that they monitor all of the participant’s hormone levels during the trials.” With a lazy kind of grace, Tony flicked open a holoscreen and sent the projection sliding across the room in Steve’s direction. “How do those numbers compare to the baseline during the workday here?”
Well, Bruce wasn’t an option for obvious reasons. And Cap, even if he hadn’t had whatever mystery plans, wasn’t much better. Their interactions since Rogers’ return had been cordial but distant, and Cap spent most of his time on his own level. He was usually joined by at least one member of the Avengers, so at least the guy wasn’t alone, but even Tony could tell it was starting to put a real strain on the team not having him around much. He would have been the one to leave and give them some space if he’d had anywhere to go, but whether because it was clearly a pattern from when Mark II was alive, or because they didn’t totally trust Tony alone in the space for long, at least two members of the team were almost always in the penthouse when he was there.
Forcing back the wave of pity that this realization caused, Peter focused his attention on the floor of the closet, where a heavy glass jug marked in an unfamiliar language sat. Whenever Thor came around, he always brought Asgardian liquor for Steve. Apparently, it was the only thing that worked on super-soldiers. Peter didn’t know for sure if he would have similar problems with metabolizing liquor, but he wasn’t going to take his chances. Not tonight. He hauled the heavy jug to his room and then pulled out his phone and opened the group text.
The relative ease of its delivery didn’t mean that this backstory had been an uncomplicated one for all of them to agree on. Several members of the team had favoured introducing Tony as an alternate universe version of himself, sticking closer to the truth and omitting only the fact that he didn’t share their orientations. Legally, though, this put Tony’s ability to gain control over SI, as well as Mark II’s finances and other resources, in a way murkier position than it already was. Plus this option involved confirming that there were alternate universes in the first place; even Cap, who still tended to avoid lying whenever possible even as head of SHIELD, admitted this had the potential to cause massive global security problems down the road. And while the notion of sticking to something resembling the truth of his presence here had initially been appealing to Tony, this story would have effectively meant having to invent and learn to convincingly perform a
Clint was the one to meet him at the door when he finally went inside, Thor’s blanket in one hand and a cup of something hot and steaming in the other. Tony lunged for the latter, swallowing half a cup in one gulp only to discover it was hot chocolate, not coffee. The other man shrugged, unrepentant and boyish, and he wasn’t who Tony expected to serve as greeting party, but he was abruptly grateful for Clint’s presence all the same. He wouldn’t push talking the way someone like Phil or Steve would, but he was more emotive than Bucky in soldier mode.
“More than you probably realize,” Bruce smiled ruefully. “Genius over here too, you know. One of the things I like best about Domination is how narrow my focus becomes; for however long I’m with a sub, all that matters in that moment is their needs, their desires, breaking through whatever barriers or defenses they’ve put up around themselves so I can give them those things. It’s rarely simple, but it is incredibly gratifying.”
Normally, hanging out with War Machine and Captain America would be the stuff of fevered fanboy dreams. Not tonight.
“I uh…I meant to say thanks. For the watch.” Thor didn’t stop chewing Swedish Fish with his mouth open (which, ew), but he did turn his eyes from the television screen for the first time in several hours, so Tony was counting that as a win.
It was difficult to keep a straight face, particularly when the Board visibly swelled with pride, as if they had actually accomplished the things Tony was describing instead of actively attempting to prevent Pepper from almost single-handedly accomplishing them. (Yeah, this whole ‘Tony-is-so-happy-to-be-alive-he-just-loves-everyone’ shtick was going to have a limited shelf life, for his own sanity as much as anything else.) Tony made a point of making eye contact with Fletcher again, inclining his head slightly and watching as the guy stopped just short of rubbing his hands together like an evil mastermind in a cartoon. (Pathetic. If you’re going to piss me off, at least be interesting about it.)
Steve rolled over then, and Tony had only seconds to mourn the loss of contact before the other man had bracketed Tony’s head with his hands and was bending down to kiss him.
Peter taps his foot impatiently all the way down, and bursts out the second the doors open with even less grace than usual. He hopes to at least find his mentor preparing the vibranium, or working one of his crazy-detailed diagrams of the building. Instead, Tony is seated on the couch watching what appears to be footage of a training session and taking notes on a tablet in his lap.
It was more frightening than he’d imagined, saying this out loud to Steve. The last time they’d had a genuine disagreement (not a fight borne of simple misunderstanding or emotional overload, like the one when Peter had been hospitalized), another version of the man had put his shield through Tony’s chest. But his arms didn’t fall away from where they held Tony fast, and when he spoke his tone hadn’t grown hard or bitter.
“What can we do?” The anger was still there in Clint’s voice, but whether from the physical pain of whatever he’d done to himself or something else, it sounded less threatening and more…defeated, the kind of anger that lingers when it’s all there is left. (To varying degrees, they’d all sounded that way after the Snap.)
“You wanna make fun o’me that’s fine, jerk, but you’re gonna help while you mock. Grab a toothbrush.” Bucky huffed, and muttered several complaints that seemed to centre around duplicating the jobs of the cleaning staff and Steve being a bossy little shit. Both happened to contain elements of truth, so Steve ignored him in favour of spraying the grout with a vinegar and water mixture.
Once, Tony had thought Steve to be selfish in his grief, too. After Coulson, he’d stormed away, refused to take solace in being hailed as Phil’s fellow soldier. We aren’t soldiers, he’d spat. So when it was Tony who came to Steve as he sat staring blankly out at the haunting beauty of their setting, so eerily silent with half of the sounds of the natural world absent, he was grateful.
Truly, Coulson’s records border on obsessive. I dread the day Stark ever learns about them; his head may become too large to fit through any standard doors.
“Yes, Clint,” Tony ground out. Clint nodded, the storminess passing from his expression as his submissive’s attempts to challenge him were halted, at least for now. He waved a hand toward his feet, and Tony settled himself into a cross-legged position. (Clint was right; he was just as beautiful that way.) The archer dangled a set of familiar purple leather cuffs in front of Tony, twirling them irreverently on his index finger. Tony’s pouting expression instantly transformed, his eyes following the cuffs unblinking and almost transfixed.
“Anything…you?” Tony asked, which bordered on nonsense but Steve had him on his hands and knees now so that he could lovingly clean every inch of Tony’s ass, and he felt he should be forgiven for the fact that it was rather hard to think under those conditions. And his Dominant understood anyway.
“Clint was too far down himself last night to be Domming you. If he suggested otherwise then that’s something we all need to discus. Immediately.”
‘True’ in my writing—see my bio and/or published work for more information) prior to his death. While sympathetic toward this violation of his privacy, many (including myself) were inclined to read his having concealed the information in the first place as a sign of shame or other orientational ill-health.
“Show me how you tap out if you want or need to.” He patted three times at the inner side of her left knee, and she nodded. “Good boy. I have you, Tony. There’s nothing you need to say, now, nothing you need to do, nowhere you need to be.”
As you might imagine, Steve is raw and broken and overwhelmed here. If you need to give this response a miss, please feel free to do so. Its only function plot-wise is to confirm that D/s Tony is indeed dead.
“I’m going to need one or both of you to explain. Quickly. Simply. With minimal snark and maximal clarity.”
Why, then, would Tony want to get married? In their universe, bonding ceremonies had all the legal and emotional implications of weddings, and had long since overtaken them in popularity and scale. The only people who tended to get married now were, as Clint had assumed, extremely religious, though some who identified as un-oriented were also turning to marriage as a way to have their bonds recognized.
“We shall have to work on your impulse control in public, Talia. In private, however…I hope you never lose that enthusiasm.” She was still smiling when she turned to face Steve fully for the first time. “Captain, I believe you have your answer.” Steve beamed, too.
effect, but they hit like a ton of bricks. He groaned, loudly, and had his face half-buried in Barnes’ armpit, like he was sniffing for pheromones or some goddamn thing, before he even realized what was happening. Several laughs came from the direction of the pool, and he didn’t even bother to look up to glare.
Shouting was, admittedly, kind of an overreaction. But the check-ins were easily one of the most difficult parts of daily submission. They were embarrassing and invasive and like all the hardest parts of subbing rolled into one. For Steve to insinuate they somehow made Tony feel better was just…no. He stomped his way to the elevator and all the way into the labs.
them. He wished he were the type of man to stay there, happily ignoring the man behind the curtain in favour of the illusion.
If you haven't seen it yet, there's also a major #AskStrange update, so feel free to check that out as well, and leave any questions you have for the Doctor here or on Tumblr.
“He is,” Bruce agreed. The air of slightly distant remove that he tended to play at was noticeably undermined by the almost strained sound in his voice.
Tony flushed, but he didn’t contradict the bombshell Clint had just dropped. Meanwhile Steve searched his own feelings, and found nothing pride in Tony for opening himself up this way, as well as a vague sense of excitement. This was something entirely new for all of them, something that couldn’t be compared to the other Tony (who, despite having spent years pretending otherwise, had had absolutely zero interest in Domination.) No matter how interested in ever Dominating again this version of the man turned out to be, Steve reckoned that the novelty of it would matter greatly to Tony.
“James, can you come home like yesterday? I’m pretty sure that the fact that we haven't fucked yet is some kind of human rights violation.”
“You don’t owe her, or me, an apology for her death. She made a choice she believed in, and from the sounds of it, it’s one she never would have had to make if any of those fools had listened to you in the first place. And she couldn’t save you either, Tony, none of them did. Why do you expect me to be angry with you when you aren’t with any of them, hmm? Your life is worth the same. It matters just as much.” He shook his head in painful denial; Natasha sighed, but didn’t push that point further, for which Tony was immensely grateful. “Remember what you were actually just punished for today. Not for her death. That does not and will never warrant punishment. You were punished because you needed to talk about this, and it was information I clearly should have had before we scened together, and you kept it from me. I understand a lot more about why, but we also can’t prove to you that we’re worth trusting if you don’t give us opportunities to try. Can you let us try,
“There’s no chance, that is, the stones are scattered here. Thanos is dead, Ultron helped us take him down pretty easily, but that’s no guarantee someone won’t find them. There’s no danger to you, right, if someone else gets their hands on the Soul Stone?”
This morning, however, it was like all of those feelings were amped up to twelve. When Steve tossed him a sweater to put on over his t-shirt with a casual reminder that it had snowed overnight, Tony threw it onto the bench in foot of the bed in a ball. Immediately it rolled off the and landed in a wrinkled heap at Steve’s feet.
“He didn’t even hit me!” Tony blurted, then groaned and buried his face in his hands. The rest of his confession was muffled, but Steve’s enhanced hearing was enough to compensate. “He made me come
“You’re Tony Stark!” she declared. Tony winced, preparing for one of Steve’s agents to go full-on fan at them. “You must have so many embarrassing stories about my boss. I’m pressed for time, so I’m going to need the top five immediately.” Another woman who seemed to be even better than Bucky or Nat at moving silently (seriously, where had she even come from?) appeared, a look of mingled amusement and exasperation on her face. The expression felt so much like Steve that Tony liked her immediately.
“Oh please. They’re damn lucky we’re here to help ‘em clean up their mess. Not like they did the same when it was us.” Then, guilted by the memory of a clearly heartbroken Steve Rogers demanding that Tony be selfish, even if it meant Steve and the others lost him for a second time, Rhodey added, “That might have come out a little more bitter than I intended.” Pepper grinned and raised her beer in a lazy salute.
Fifty really didn’t sound like that much. Between that and the sliver of stubborn resistance that subbing for Steve occasionally seemed to bring out in him, Tony was quite certain that crying or screaming wouldn’t be an issue. If anything, he worried that he’d reach the end of this session and not feel much of anything, let alone the penitent space he’d found after punishments from Natasha and Rhodey.
Ned’s might have been trembling when he grasped the suit in both hands, but that didn’t stop him from stretching and pressing with all the interest and curiosity of a true nerd. Peter watched with an aching kind of fondness in his chest. He even offered the occasional comment about some of the features he’d installed while trying not to overwhelm his friend’s quiet exploration. Finally, as if some kind of dam had broken, Ned grinned and stuck the mask over his face with a delighted exclamation.
“Are you telling me you haven’t had an orgasm in weeks because you were waiting on our permission?” Bruce’s voice was taut and strained, and one of his hands clutched the edge of the table like he wasn’t quite sure what it might do if given free rein. Alarmed, Tony shoved his way up backward on the table enough that he could sit up and cross his legs. Maybe it was pointless to try to preserve his modesty now, but the prospect of facing this conversation as exposed as he had been was entirely unappealing.
“We had planned to address that soon enough, but we wanted to give you some time to get used to the whole host of new things we were already asking of you. And you were behaving almost frighteningly perfectly at first, so there was no real need to rush a discussion about discipline anyway. The last week or so, though, you’re slipping on the rules that we agreed on together, and your mood has been deteriorating. And now I’m finding out that despite being explicitly told on a number of occasions that our moratorium on sex did
“Noooo Dummy not now, ’s the middle of the night.” A soft, musical laugh informed him that this was decidedly not his bot playing wake-up attendant again. “Pep?” And damn if this wasn’t the most bizarre thing that had happened to him in ages, portal included; when was the last time he’d woken to Pepper Potts in his bed? Before Thanos and the War, definitely; maybe even before Ultron—Pep had been gone a lot back then, even before they’d officially called it quits. Yet here she was, sitting cross-legged on the bed in patched, fraying jeans and a Stark Industries hoodie, her hair tied back in a messy ponytail. For the briefest of moments Tony entertained the notion that this was some kind of misguided ‘thank-god-you’re-sorta-not-dead’ bootycall. (He’d say no, of course, even if the thought of being touched positively by anyone right now felt like a lifeline he was tempted to cling to with everything he had left.)
.” The uncharacteristic curse from Bruce was the only warning Tony got before the flogger began to land with increasing speed. The blows remained as precise as they had been the entire time, but the methodical pacing he’d always associated with Bruce was falling away in the face of their shared desperation. He had never felt Bruce like this, with the very last of his hesitation stripped away. It was glorious and primal and Tony was prouder of himself than he ever thought he’d could be, that he’d helped to bring Bruce to this place, that his most reserved and careful Dominant was finally letting go. “God, it’s never going to be enough.” Tony nodded in frantic agreement.
This, at least, had brought Peter several minutes of something close to joy as he imagined MJ, clad in some kind of Black Widow-esque getup, coming in through the air shafts or blasting her way through one of the walls. The two of them had been carefully not addressing the status of their relationship ever since he’d left school, but it felt good to know she’d still do something as absurd as infiltrate the Avengers Compound even if he was never more than a friend again.
Phil gave no indication that he noticed the war Tony was currently waging against himself. After finishing his cereal and clearing both their bowls off to one side, he tapped one heel against the bottom of the chair. Out popped a drawer from which Phil drew several blankets, including the weighted one that usually resided in the penthouse living room. He wound it around Tony, pulling just slightly as he did so that Tony was drawn flush against his side. It wasn’t quite the same as being at Coulson’s feet, but at least with the heaviness of the blanket combined with Phil’s arm around his shoulders he didn’t feel so unmoored.
“I am exceptionally, ridiculously serious about this,” Steve confirmed. It drew a smile from Tony for the first time in the conversation.
It was such a non-sequitur, even in a conversation made of them, that Domen couldn’t entirely mask her surprise.
“…well, the girl at the front desk asked me out the other day, and I promptly proceeded to walk into the door.”
“It isn’t. I mean, it is in so many ways but not this part. He pushes up against you hardest because he needs you to show him where the line is, prove to him that you’ll keep him within in its boundaries. Most of the time you can do that with the Dominance. Sometimes, especially with this Tony, he needs something else. You gave him what he needed; now just give him some time to realize that, hmm?”
“Personally,” Howard continued as if Tony hadn’t spoken (a good sign his had been the right answer), “I think True subs and Doms are uncommon because orientation is a trait that’s just dying out. And in my book that’s a damn good thing. No one should have to rely on anyone like that. People…they disappoint each other. It’s what we do. We hurt each other and leave each other and end up on the bottom of the
“Hush now. That’s my decision to make, isn’t it? I decide when you’ve had enough. And you’ve been so good for me, Tony, so patient and obedient.”
“It’s not…that’s not what Pepper meant,” Steve sighed. "Something happened to trigger this, something clicked for him when we were at SHIELD together. It does concern me that he took off like that, but it’s not like that’s totally unprecedented when he has genius moments.” The others nodded their agreement with varying levels of exasperated fondness in their expressions. “But I think Pepper, and I would agree with her here, is more concerned with the fact that it feels like he’s almost regressing. Refusing to come out of the shop or let anyone else in, probably not eating or sleeping much, forcing JARVIS to lie to us—”
Tony continues growing closer to the team, with movie night and his date with Thor both going in unexpected directions. Steve continues fighting several uphill battles: the workplace orientation and cross-training programs, and his efforts to keep Tony at arm's length.
“I’m so glad to hear that sweetheart. It was good for me too,” Steve told him as he placed Tony’s right foot into his palm and then began to gently roll his ankle. “I like it when you go down hard and fast, and I’m sure we’ll play that way sometimes too, but for this first time, I liked having you stay with me a little longer. And I like to let you fight yourself a little on the way down instead of just forcing you; it makes the full drop feel even sweeter when I’ve watched you work so hard to get yourself there.”
Natasha had laid out Steve’s old sweater and a pair of soft grey pajama pants. Tony let them dress him with almost disturbing obedience, stepping or raising his arms when he was told without the slightest concern. He was asleep in minutes after his head touched the pillow, one hand still clasping Steve’s. Natasha bracketed him from the other side, and ran her fingers through his damp curls with a shaky breath.
It wasn’t that Tony had ever really doubted how seriously the team took things like safewords and consent. Submissives, he’d been told and had witnessed firsthand again and again, held all the real power. The Dominant took only what they were given, and always had to be prepared to return it; their Dominance became meaningless if not aligned with the needs and desires of their submissive.
“Why didn’t you?” she asked in that same almost-neutral tone. It wasn’t an unexpected question, but it was still a challenging one to actually answer.
“Ah, so subs are made out to be overemotional and needy and doms—what, lemme guess. Dominin makes them sexually aggressive and unable to control themselves, right?” Bruce, who has heard some of the most outrageous of Tony’s behaviour and never so much as batted an eyelash, looks at him like he’s out of his entire damn mind. “Uh…it’s possible I was mapping some bullshit stereotypes from my universe onto yours.”
So when upwards of two hundred messages were sitting in his highest priority inbox, the one typically reserved for Avengers-level threats, Steve knew his morning was going to take a turn for the worse. He took a long gulp of coffee, sat back in his chair and opened the most recent one.
Pepper cast a longing glance back at the document containing their half-completed mission statement.
“What?” he shrugged in response to the thoroughly bemused look he received from his pillow. “Still dropping, y’know. Just hold me for a bit?”
“No sleeve,” Phil grunted immediately. No surprise there, though Steve suspected the choice would be taken out of Phil’s hands. Whoever had prepped him (Natasha, probably, she loved giving teased, desperate subs to other Doms to play with) had sent Phil to Steve already on a hair-trigger. And Steve wasn’t planning on going easy enough to let Coulson calm himself down any. “One, Sir.”
Tony was still shouting outraged protests about the value of the unexpected in the scientific process by the time Steve was stepping back into the elevator and pressing the button for the garage.
Then Natasha took over. Rhodey been hesitant at first, when most of the team had wanted to involve themselves in punishing Tony. Poly relationships were great and all, but when it came to punishments ‘too many cooks’ was still a genuine risk. It would be incredibly easy for the scene to become monotonous, or for Tony to become overwhelmed by the guilt and pain before he could reach true release. Rhodey needn’t have worried. On the battlefield the Avengers were famous for their unity and cohesion; they were studied by every combat force Rhodey had ever heard of. But that was
“But then why not just have Taskmaster move in and try to go more directly for Tony the way he as much as told us he’s planning?” Steve had asked.
Unlike all the other evenings, Tony didn’t try to argue with him, or force a conversation that Steve wasn’t ready to have. There was only a sigh and a quiet rustle of sheets.
“…huh. So you’re—alright then. I mean, if my brain was going to generate some kind of between-state guide I guess you’d be a decent one, though if you threaten to taze me again I might rethink that. The rest of you though…” He turned and surveyed the room, holding his hands up in a slightly mocking surrender when Natasha and Bucky both raised their weapons again. He stopped dead when his eyes (finally finally) fell on Steve. And oh Christ, it was really him. There were parts of the man that were just slightly off, like Steve’s Tony had been taken apart and put together not quite correctly (the arc reactor looked…odd, and there was something about the man’s left hand…). But there was no one else in the world who could make Steve feel like he was being stripped utterly just by the intensity of their attention.
Which was how they wound up eating fast food forty minutes later while sitting in an empty parking lot, dressed to the nines, on the hood of one of Tony’s more subtle cars. Steve had made himself a bib out of several of the supplied napkins to protect his suit, and was taking an adorably delicate bite out of his fifth Big Mac. Tony had yet to get through one, mainly because he’d spent almost the entire time staring at Steve.
It wasn’t going to happen again. She didn’t know everything that had gone on between this Tony and his own version of her, but Pepper knew they had been close. He still looked at her like the other Tony had in the early years of their friendship, with so much admiration and open affection, but also a hint of regret. Like maybe there were things about their relationship he wished he could erase as much as Pepper yearned to have fought more to keep Tony in her life.
been really busy lately,” he observed, allowing the slightest hint of a whine to creep into his tone. Steve made a sympathetic humming noise and kissed his head.
Content Notes: So, this chapter is abut 75% sex. Plot-relevant sex, but still. That's pretty much it. To the point that reading around it would mean almost skipping the chapter altogether, but if you want to give it a shot, you probably want to stop reading at "These are pretty heavy" and pick up again after the section break.
The team was elated. The more they celebrated Tony’s acceptance of himself and his role, however, the more concerned Steve grew. At first he couldn’t articulate what it was about Tony’s behaviour that was making him anxious and suspicious. His partners seemed inclined to read it as a remnant of Steve’s recent drop.
Oh gosh. I'm nervous to post this, way moreso than usual. Please be kind (you always are, but I feel the need to ask anyway.) And thank you, as always, for your wonderful kudos, comments, and questions.
“You still can’t afford me, Director.” Steve held up a garlic fry, thick cut and dripping with mayo and who knew what else in answer. “Alright, I’m listening.”
Ah, excellent factual inquiries. (Well, at least to start.) The D/s universe is nearing the second anniversary of the death of their Tony Stark.
“No. Let them see it. Hell, let ‘em project it on every screen in the Tower if they want. Just, no incoming communications, alright, J?”
Content Notes: You know, it might be possible this is the second chapter in a row with no real content warnings to speak of! Tony does experience some jealousy in this one, but it's brief and not directed so much at a person as a context. That's really all I can think of. As always, let me know if you have questions or concerns.
Oddly enough, Barnes’ unwillingness to apologize for mistakes that hadn’t been his own was just as comforting as the apology he did offer. It meant they weren’t empty words designed to placate or push Tony’s grievances aside. (The contrast to Rogers’ ‘sorry-not-sorry’ letter were…certainly striking.) Dummy wheeled back and forth between the two of them, clearly trying to evaluate what he’d do if Tony and Barnes couldn’t reconcile, and that sealed it.
“With very little reason to believe that you were likely to succeed.” The knot grew tighter, and Steve’s jaw tightened almost to the point of pain. “And then there was the plane.”
It was absolutely nothing like Tony had imagined Peter’s life without him. The kid was supposed to be eating street food and fetching cats out of trees, not fighting for his life in an ICU while his bewildered aunt wondered if he had joined some kind of gang or if he was being abused or chased by someone with deadly intent. This reality had in fact been so unthinkable to Tony that he’d considered the possibility that it was May herself who was different. Perhaps Peter was not reaching out to her because she had never embraced her role as his primary caretaker with the same care and devotion she’d provided in Tony’s original universe? Natasha had been quick, decisive, and entirely correct in striking down that option. Tony had not been truly surprised, but the absence of that theory left behind a truth that was somehow even more discomforting: that Tony’s presence in his life had potentially ended up altering the course of the other Peter Parker’s life in ways that were not solely negative.
“I thought—you said no orientation stuff before, and then Bruce wouldn’t do check-in this morning. Thought maybe I had to earn most of it back or something, the submission.” Steve frowned, unsure how to begin addressing that level of renewed insecurity on top of everything else they needed to cover. After days of wanting nothing but to be able to have these conversations, actually starting them suddenly felt daunting.
Team, I'm really sorry this chapter is a week late. I'm especially sorry because your responses to the last chapter were particularly kind and supportive and I just want to write ALL THE THINGS for y'all! Hopefully the length of this chapter, and the AskStrange replies coming your way tomorrow, make up for it. You're the best.
“I—I had a late night.” It was a desperate play, but the phone call from the Tower to T’Challa’s offices could at least be verified, and he had to try something. He had no desire to walk out on someone he considered both a colleague and maybe now a friend, but the longer their conversation entered around this topic, the more Steve felt like a panicked animal being chased by a much more powerful predator. (Even that was probably the damn dep talking, volatile emotional responses to relatively mundane situations.)
“Sit. Down.” Pepper wasn’t a Dom, but Steve, who had been rising to his feet, sat back down on his chair so quickly and hard that she might as well have been. She glared at Tony as if daring him, too, to try to moving, but he knew way better than to bother messing with Pepper when she got in this particular mood. He’d seen her make grown businessmen cry. “Steve, I know you’re angry. But no one is leaving this room in a huff; no one is leaving this room period until we get this sorted out, and believe me when I say you don’t want to test me on this. So get comfortable, boys. We have a lot of ground to cover. Now Steve, explain slowly and calmly, using I statements, what your issues are with the plan Tony has put forward.”
“He did.” Tony thought about leaving it there. Steve might be uncharacteristically focused right now, perhaps in an attempt to make up for having so massively derailed their earlier conversation with mind-blowing sex, but he would leave it alone if Tony clearly indicated this wasn’t a conversation he wished to be having. “SWORD is big picture stuff, about as big as it gets. It’s trying to protect the whole damn galaxy from anything else that might be coming. And that’s important, but…God, I thought of nothing but big picture stuff for years. I’m kind of happy about the idea of keeping my feet a little more on the ground, focusing on solving some of the problems here, you know?” Steve was silent for long enough in the face of these complaints that Tony wanted to burrow back through the bedsheets and maybe into a vortex of some kind.
“Join the club,” Steve commiserated, taking a swig of the liquor for himself. “Remember the part where I didn’t tell him that Bucky killed his parents, and then beat the crap out of him for being upset about it? It’s kind of unbelievable I ever thought it work between he and I, really. There’s way too much baggage.”
Tony couldn’t remember a time no one had needed him to speak, build, or act. Subspace, he supposed, but this was different. Oh the subby parts of Tony were delighted by these developments for sure, but he wasn’t floating and unaware the way he got in deep ‘space. He followed the debate that the team had over what to watch, even laughed a little to himself as Thor made an impassioned and ultimately successful case for some rom-com on Netflix that he loved. He flipped Rhodey off when his friend laughed a little too pointedly at the protagonist of the show insisting she wasn’t tired right before falling asleep face-first in her dinner. Natasha checked the gag frequently, too, making sure Tony could breathe and that the straps weren’t too tight or irritating against his skin, and she took it off for a while around lunch time to hand-feed him a hamburger and some cut-up fruit and vegetables. Even then, though, no one took advantage of the gag’s absence to ask anything of Tony, or to force interactions any more complex than occasionally combing their fingers through his hair or pressing a kiss to his cheek on their way to the kitchen or the bathroom.
“Mr. Stark?” The breath was punched from Tony’s lungs all at once, and he gripped the doorframe with one hand as a fresh wave of pain crashed through him.
It was Natasha (of course it was) who seemed to realize how quickly things were edging toward too much. She reached for Tony, pressing a kiss to his lips that refused simple categorization. It was soft and reassuring, her mouth open and seeming to yield against his own, but he could feel the subtle ways she directed the entire exchange. Tony didn’t take so much as a breath that he didn’t think she intended, and when they broke apart he let himself stare at her in wonder for just a moment. He’d called another version of her an imposter once, but the more he got to know Natasha, the more he felt like what made her so good at her job was exactly what she’d told him made her a unique Dominant: every version of herself that she presented was always true at some basic, core level. The self she produced in response to the desires of those around her no less honest for the fact that they often involved some kind of manipulation.
It was never not a delight to watch Coulson troll the team, so it took Tony longer than it should have to register what he’d heard.
“He won’t be again, Natasha. I can’t promise much when it comes to him; things are too new, there are so many variables…but I give you my word that he will never be alone again.”
He found the object of his ire working not at his usual desk but on the penthouse couch. Phil was also wearing jeans, which Tony had never before seen him in (which looked to be a crime judging from the way they hugged Phil’s impressive thighs even sitting down), paired with a sinfully soft-looking black pullover. The sight was unexpected and distracting enough that it was several beats before he remembered why he had stomped his way there in the first place.
“Huh?” Her smile had that sly little curve to it that only came out on the rare occasions that Pepper was about to break the rules.
The checklist had a whole section on what pet names were acceptable, so Tony mentally adjusted the compliment.
It took Pepper nearly two hours to emerge from the workshop, pulling a protesting Tony into the penthouse by his left ear. He appeared drawn and beyond exhausted. Any weight that he had put on since arriving in this universe had vanished and there were dark bruises under his eyes. The beautiful hint of wavy curls that his hair fell into when it was longer like this were flat and greasy. Dummy rolled behind them, beeping his disapproval and concern and jostling for position with the armour that was still stalking Pepper. When Dummy’s camera found Steve, he zoomed over and began relaying his frustration in even more high-pitched and frequent exclamations. Steve could hardly blame the bot; everything in him ached to feed Tony, get him into a bath, and then put him warm and sated into a bed.
ready. Any more than this right now and we risk overwhelming him and making him reject aftercare altogether next time. You made the right call.” He steered them, not to the elevator or the stairs, but back to the bedroom in which they’d spent the majority of the last two days. Her sheets still smelled like sex and Tony and a little bit like sugar (Tony had eaten way too many of the pixi-stix Thor had brought him on his first day here), and she fell gratefully into them face-first. Bruce paused only to strip off his shirt before joining her. His chest was warm and delightfully fuzzy with its usual crop of hair, and she burrowed back against him, grateful to be with someone whose Dominance was stronger than her own right now. “You did well, Natasha.”
“I am absolutely certain,” Steve said firmly. He draped a blanket around Thor’s shoulders, slid on a pair of pyjama pants, and jogged to the elevator.
“Good.” With hands that appeared to be very slightly shaking, Bruce opened the fridge and unearthed several plates of food. In addition to threatening post-its directed at Thor and Clint, each of them was covered in clear cling wrap, and contained all manner of small, bite-sized portions of food. One was a mix of fruit, cheese and meat; another contained a colourful variety of vegetables with several kinds of dip in the centre. The third was a selection of desserts including bite-sized brownies, mini-cakes and bright macarons.
Which was all well and good, except that it would get right in the way of Tony’s plan to avoid Phil until he felt a little less awkward around the man. Something about their encounter nearly a week prior left Tony flushed and squirmy every time he let himself think of it for too long, and until he could figure out what exactly his problem was, he didn’t want to risk being around the man.
Two days later, Tony was flying, and it wasn’t even a metaphor. He had a death grip on Thor’s absurdly sculpted shoulders and back while the other man brought them in to land using only Mjolnir as a guide.
“Brat,” Steve accused, even as he shuddered and reached behind himself to place his hands under Tony’s thighs and hike him closer. When Tony took a chance and nibbled experimentally at his neck, Steve groaned and seemed to struggle with himself for a moment before he spun around and Tony abruptly found himself on his back. It was the first time the super soldier had ever let a hint of his strength come through in private, and while mere weeks ago the sight of Steve looming over him like this might have evoked terror or rage or even a full on flashback to Siberia, now there wasn’t room for much beyond base lust, and competing urges to keep teasing Steve and bare his neck in submission.
Steve felt his own Dominance rise up in response. He wasn’t pleased to see Thor struggling, of course, but Steve was quite literally built for this, made to be able to ease Thor past whatever the source of this uncharacteristic resistance was and get him back on solid ground. All hints of tiredness fading away, Steve stood and dug into the nightstand he had been using as his own lately. His residency in Tony’s room was new enough that he wasn’t as well supplied as he would have been if he were on his own floor, but moving between levels with Thor so unstable right now felt like it would be a mistake. He seized the simple leather cuffs he found and beckoned Thor toward him.
Likewise, the hyper stimulation of a Dominant’s amygdala means that if they feel they have failed to provide adequately for a submissive, they are prone to depressive episodes and other severe emotional responses.
“Hey, you’re up! There’s coffee in the press, that shit that tastes like dirt that Bruce says you still love—”
I apologize for having neglected to respond to this question, especially since it is so wonderfully data-driven.
“We can skip this if you’re busy,” he tried anyway. (God, they hadn’t even started yet and already he was squirming where he stood, that same confusing rush of humiliation and pleasure and embarrassment coursing through him as strong as a hit of the really good coke from the 80s.) Bruce spun on his feet, smiling even as a couple drops of tea escaped over one side of his cup.
I'VE MISSED YOU ALL SO MUCH! I've never had such an erratic posting schedule as I have for the last year or so, and while life is just gonna do what it's gonna do, I always feel so much better when I'm active in fandom. Love y'all. Thanks for sticking with me! We're nearing the end on this one, but if you follow me on Tumblr, you know there are another two fics in the works. Plus I'll be doing Marvel Trumps Hate again this year. And I launched a new Iron Man podcast! So many things.
“I want the specs on this.” That was definitely Bruce, whose appreciation for Tony’s mind was just as intense as his desire for the rest of the man. Tony laughed and spun around for the team to admire him from all angles. (Clearly every version of the man knew how to work a room.)
Other evenings were more subdued, like the one where Thor showed up with a massive jug of Asgardian mead and sadly announced that he was certain enough that he’d brought physical harm to Tony that the two of them had decided to forego any D/s play for the time being.
“Yessir.” Steve watched carefully as Bruce circled Tony’s hole, pressing gently all around the rim with his gloved index finger. Tony’s hips kept wanting to move, to shove back into Bruce’s touch, but Steve could see he was also working hard to respect Bruce’s ‘no sex in check-ins’ rule (the bane of every sub and Switch that had ever experienced them.)
to get hard and come had his cock twitching in his own palm before long. He groaned, tipping his head back as the lace danced across hyper-sensitive skin. As he continued his slow exploration his knees slid further apart, Tony’s joints for once fully cooperating with his desires; hell, his whole body felt fluid in a way it never had before, like it could just make itself into whatever shape his Dominants wanted. It made Tony feel infinitely powerful and incredibly submissive all at once, and he groaned aloud.
“They suspect,” Steve corrected. “Taskmaster intimated that he’d told SI he suspected something about Tony was different, that he’d come back ‘wrong.’ He seemed convinced that they hadn't taken him seriously, and obviously they were hoping to just avoid the issue by taking Tony out of the picture altogether. But seeing as that didn’t work, this seems to be Fletcher's next play.”
“Steve, I’m sorry.” His partner’s eyes closed, tears leaking down onto his face, and Tony wanted to be where Pepper was now, would have given anything just to touch Steve, to show him just how much he regretted what he’d done. But he sat, frozen in place as Steve’s chest heaved with the force of silent tears.
Peter rocked back on his heels. He’d expected a lot of things from Tony in this conversation. Platitudes about his age, definitely, paired with not-so-subtle reminders that Tony had already faced the loss of another version of him. Just as it had months before when Tony had baldly announced he was not from this universe, his willingness to lay it all out in front of Peter was enough to stop him cold. If Tony was willing to treat him like a peer, someone who deserved explanation and justification, how could Peter continue to respond by acting like the child he had just been insisting he didn’t deserve to be treated as? (It was as calming as it was annoying.)
“God, who knows what bullshit reasons my mind has for the things it does.” May did not call this out for the obvious lie of omission it was, but she did take back the bottle of wine. Holding it hostage might not be the most ethical approach to this conversation, but hell if she was going to do all the work. Part of her was already regretting not letting one of Tony’s ample supply of partners handle this. “Ugh, you are so exactly like Pepper. The fact that there’s two of you should rightfully make the world implode or something. I…this is the one thing that’s just mine, okay? Not—I mean, he’s yours, obviously he’s your kid and I would never. Christ, when did I get so bad at this?”
of all people refilling Tony’s coffee while chatting happily away about some book they’d both decided to read about algorithms and systemic oppression. Natasha had teasingly called their plan to get back together and discuss it after reading a book club, and Phil had jumped on the idea, arguing that having an external push to make time for non-SHIELD related reading would be welcome. By the time Steve had made a hurried exit back to his own floor, several of them had been planning on making a whole evening of it early next week. It wasn’t togetherness in the same way it had been with their own Tony, of course; even aside from the absence of orientational dynamics, there was still the occasional awkward pause or conversational misstep. But those were fewer and farther between compared to when Steve had left for Wakanda, and tempered by unmistakable signs of affection and understanding on both sides.
Well, it's so late in most time zones that I know most of you won't actually be reading this until tomorrow, but I still wanted to try to get it posted on my regular day of the week for my own satisfaction and sanity if nothing else.
By the time Steve’s shock had worn off, Natasha and Bruce were already off the phone, and Bruce was trying to wrestle a sweater over his head that was both inside-out and backwards. Steve strode over, seized the offending garment in one hand and put the other on top of Bruce’s chest, directly above his heart.
tonight! And the data Jane was pulling up, what you can do to wind and precipitation, and that’s not even to mention the Bifrost! I mean sure, seeing it in person would be cool and all, but tonight it talked to me in my own damn language. I’ve seen the science of it now, and Jane’s going to show me more, and—and I’m babbling,” he concluded. For his part, Thor seemed neither bored nor annoyed as he removed his red cape and set Mjolnir down on the floor next to the coffee table.
She flinched as soon as she registered the expression on Peter’s face. He remembered that even in the haze of the days that followed. But MJ, while brilliant and thoughtful in so many instances, becomes stubbornly defiant when truly brought to anger. Instead of uttering the apology that would have ended the entire matter right there with nothing but a few awkward moments of recovery, she crossed her arms over her chest and said nothing.
about where you came from and what it was like for you there, but I’m betting there are things and people from your universe that you miss. That you’re mourning.” Oh God. Now that she was arriving at the point, Tony was positive he didn’t want to hear it. “Our Tony…he set up a substantial endowment for at-risk kids who have demonstrated an aptitude for STEM. The kids work in the labs as part of their community service hours, and they retain the rights to whatever they make. This particular bunch enjoy it so much that they regularly ‘break in’ to SI at night to keep working; everyone knows they're here, of course, but it's cute to watch all the strategies they keep coming up with for bypassing security and JARVIS. Rhodey and I figured you had probably set up something similar on your side,” (he had), “and we thought it might be nice for you to know, to see, that everything you’ve given your world didn’t vanish when they lost you.”
blamed Thor.” This set Tony off cackling again, and when he looked across the table and found Natasha’s fond gaze, her presence felt the slightest bit more solid, like he could safely look away for a few seconds and feel confident that she’d still be there when he dared to look back.
first-date question, something that two people who truly had little to no history might have asked. Clint grinned, probably at the banality of it too, but then cocked his head to give the inquiry sincere consideration.
“Save me the eggplant parmesan or I swear I will eat every single piece of garlic bread,” he threatened, ignoring Natasha’s smug grin. (Hell, it had been a while now, and their minimal interactions had been fine. Seeing Tony in a more informal setting, buffered by their entire team…it might even be nice.)
Steve carried the feeling of bone-deep warmth and contentment that had seeped through him during their first dinner into the fundraiser. He was far more comfortable with these kinds of events than it sounded like the other version of Steve would had been, but there was still an intense performativity to them that sometimes reminded him unpleasantly of his days as a propaganda tool.
TIME SPECIAL ISSUE: ORIENTATION AT WORK? WHY THE WAKANDAN MODEL IS LEADING THE WAY TOWARD THE FUTURE
“You’re never intruding anywhere in this Tower, Thor, you know that. What do you need to talk to me about that Tony can’t know?”
He’d gone in an as optimistic as one could really be when their destination was grief counselling. Dr. Domen had already been waiting when he’d arrived in his living room, though she apparently hadn’t anticipated his slightly early appearance, because she was sitting on Steve's couch eating a granola bar. It felt unexpectedly surprising to see her doing something so normal, so human. Steve’s mind had apparently built the woman up as a kind of impenetrable force above such things as food.
No one had had any clue how Tony might respond to their first group scene, so there had been a number of plans and alternatives depending on how long and how far it seemed like the submissive would be able and willing to go. Bruce, however, seemed to be reaching the same conclusion that Steve himself was, which was that to push Tony much further today might put him down further than he was really prepared to go. He shook his head in Natasha, Clint, and Phil’s direction; far from seeming bothered by the news that they wouldn’t get a chance with Tony, the three of them immediately got busy with one another, kissing and petting and caressing as they watched the scene in front of them play out. Bruce, meanwhile, stepped forward and rapped his hand around Tony’s dick, thumbing lightly at the head.
“It wasn’t a big deal! Don’t pretend to be ignorant of the way it works when you’re operating at the level that SI does. Things are just as dirty and underhanded as they’ve always been. There were some threats, to myself and my parents, who someone must not have gotten the memo that I don’t actually speak to. My apartment was broken into—unclench, I wasn’t there and they knew that, they just wanted to frighten me.”
Other things were entirely predictable, especially to someone like Coulson whose work was so much about pattern recognition. Bruce Banner showing up in Phil’s office the day after the team’s conversation about Tony submitting definitely fell into the latter category. Coulson had the document charting everything they knew about Tony open before Bruce had even stepped fully into the room.
“Of course I’ll help. I told you, I’m yours as long as the muffins hold out.” Tony’s answering smile was…God, it was almost shy. Steve downed his entire glass of orange juice in one pull, just to be doing something that wasn’t staring at the man across from him.
This still sounded somewhat dubious to Tony, but the sheer force of Steve’s Dominance ultimately left little room for real doubt. Tony gave his permission, then focused his attention back on working the too-thin, too-short, not textured enough dildo in his ass.
“We also thought, though this is something we definitely want your input on, that it might be best to keep submission out of the dates for now. Our wanting to get to know you better doesn’t depend on where you land in that arena, so keeping them as discrete entities while you’re still figuring things out might be a good way to reinforce that.” There was a definite logic there, but some part of Tony was distinctly disappointed at the idea of stepping back from the submission stuff when they’d just barely started it. “Your lessons, though…well, we thought if you were amenable, those could start having more opportunities to experiment with the things you might be interested in trying first-hand.”
His encryptions are impressive even for a mortal, so while I can’t provide a complete overview, I can confirm that his notes include: clothing habits (and current measurements); eating preferences (complete with an itemized list of meals they’ve seen Stark reject or strongly enjoy), recreation/leisure interests, and both confirmed and speculative notes about all elements of Stark’s overall health. There is also what I can only deem a truly absurd shared ‘wish list’ where the team is adding items they intend to purchase for Stark once they feel he will be more inclined to accept gifts from them.
“Why do you do it then?” he asked. “Stay here, with mortals I mean. Isn’t it—doesn’t that just make it harder? We must be like the blink of an eye to you.”
“I mean, yeah I guess I could see how losing so many people that young would make me more cautious, but it also made me…I don’t know, more aware that waiting to do things I wanted until they fit some kind of script or set of expectations for what life is supposed to look like, I’d just end up regretting it. Because nothing is—I mean, doing things the way you’re supposed to doesn’t mean you can be sure of anything, does it?”
“Woah, woah, Brown, take a breath and have a seat. You want a drink? Old fashioned, right?” She waved away the offer impatiently.
Oh team. The world is hard and scary right now, and that makes me all the more grateful to have this verse and you wonderful humans to connect with. We've all been waiting for Steve and Tony to get their date for ages, and I desperately hope that part one (because we'll totally be picking up on this next chapter!) lived up to the hype.
“I can’t—I don’t deserve—” Phil’s short, decisive sentences cut through the wave of self-loathing that threatened to swallow Steve whole.
"Honestly I’m not sure. I think it would be hard to avoid them entirely, especially since some scenes don’t start that way but do end up going that direction, and I wouldn’t want to limit any of you by making that kind of flexibility unavailable. There might be particular scenes I’d have to nope out of, or that Tones might not want me there for, but we can probably deal with that in the moment without causing anyone too much distress.”
“Don’t point that thing at me, Rogers.” Steve had indeed been waving his hot dog at Tony like some ridiculous wand, showering them both with relish and onions. He blushed and offered up a napkin while Tony cackled. (God it felt so good to hear him laugh. Steve would make himself look like a fool a thousand times a day for that.) “Seriously, though, you’re not forcing anything on anyone. You’re gathering the facts, you’re listening to experts, and you’re asking yourself hard questions. These are good things, Steve. And I can…I mean, if you want, I could read over some of the more scientific stuff. From what I remember of T’Challa’s team their writing is great but almost poetic in a way that can make it hard to follow at first.”
At this point, though, no one on the team seemed to want to hear Steve’s theories. They’d gone from reading it as drop to assuming it had something to do with the upcoming anniversary; he was getting entirely sick of the mixture of frustration and concern that accompanied his so much as saying Tony’s name these days.
Peter is in hell. There is absolutely no other word for it. Rhodey has everyone gathered in the living room, and is holding each of their left shoes. It’s an old trick, he says, from dealing with Tony. (“He wouldn’t normally get pissed enough to leave with only one shoe on, and when he did I at least had the satisfaction of knowing he looked like a complete fool.”)
: This chapter picks up almost immediately following last chapter. As such, Steve's mind is still very much on the super triggery stuff that he was thinking and talking about then. See last chapter's warning for details if you haven't read it yet, and take care while reading.
“But it is so…so petty!” Thor protested. Steve’s enhanced hearing picked up the protesting stretch of leather; Thor was putting too much pressure on the bonds at his wrists. He seemed to realize it too, because before Steve had the chance to remove them or offer a gentle reminder, the noise ceased. “We have a version of our lover, our partner, back. It is more than we could have dared to hope for, and instead of thanking all the Gods, I resent my lovers for the attention they receive? I do not recognize myself in this.”
“So do you—I mean, I guess with Mr. Stark you don’t really need a guy in the chair. He’s gotta be like—
Ah, yes. The fundamental contradiction of Trues: they are both nothing special and extremely unique. The deceased version of Tony Stark was correct in arguing that much of the mythos built up around True identification is, essentially, a sales tactic. True orientations are such a rarity that it became easy for them to become little more than a marketing tool, encouraging those outside of those classifications to feel they must make up for a perceived lack through the purchase of jewelry, luxury vacation, cars, etc.
It had only been a matter of days. Hell, technically they’d been with Tony for most of the day of the press conference, and for several emotional hours immediately preceding it. But it felt like it had already been weeks since Tony—theirs, forever now—had stepped into the penthouse. His eyes had been red-rimmed and bloodshot, and Steve’s stomach had dropped, preparing for a goodbye he wasn’t sure he would survive a second time.
The hints implied by the presence of particular materials turned out to be the most involved Tony got for the entire afternoon. It wasn’t exactly quiet in the lab, not with Tony’s music blaring and his ongoing banter with his AI (so cool), his bots, and occasionally people who were not in the room. He made occasional conversation with Peter, too, but it was all pretty neutral stuff and generally related to the work one or both of them were doing.
Tony, but they’re so damn much alike that looking directly at the man was the most torturous delight Steve had ever experienced) and Tony had responded by going nearly catatonic, no one really knew what to do next.
When the team had drawn straws (literally! drawn straws! like hanging out with Tony was some kind of prize they were going to fight over without some kind of system) and Clint had turned out to be the winner, Tony had downgraded even those expectations. Lose the flowers, add maybe some time on the shooting range, or a retreat into the air vents if things took a particularly disastrous turn.
“I’d like you to repeat what I said to you the night of the debriefing. I’m not entirely sure you heard me properly.”
“Tony listen to me. I am on your side, okay? Always. And I am telling you that if at the end of this conversation you still want to leave, then you and I will walk out this door and we never have to come back here if you don’t want to. I have a company chopper on standby, and we will figure out where to go and what to say to the press. I promise, Tony, can you trust me?” It was a bit rich, her actively asking for Tony’s trust after blatantly lying to him, and yet he would always give it to her. It was
Rhodey’s departure dampened his spirits enough that he started to wonder if today was really the right day  for the kind of scene he’d discussed with Phil that morning, but when Bruce came to fetch him a couple hours later, eyes already dark with Dominance, Tony’s stomach still heated pleasantly.
Strange likely thought he was complicating matters. In truth Tony was surprised to learn that Harley was apparently involved in Peter’s attempts to recover Tony. He’d kept in contact throughout the years, but not as much as he would have liked, and beyond a bit of relief from the money he’d left Harley and his Mom in his will, Tony never expected the kid to feel particularly strongly about his loss. But the answer to Strange’s actual question arrived with a clarity that Tony rarely found in anything except science and engineering problems.
know that high level Dominants often ended up in caregiving work, but he betrayed no signs of surprise. He did, however, let his body lean ever so slightly backward against Steve’s as he and mogul-guy (Steve wanted to call him Chad, but he wanted to mentally call a lot of the men here Chad) kept chatting.
“I think we both know that the grades you’ve been getting over the past several months are not reflective of your abilities, Peter.” There was nothing, really, to say in the face of this matter-of-fact assessment. Either he could insist he was in fact as disengaged and foolish as the past few months suggested. (This option would undoubtedly lead to him getting kicked out of school.) Or he would have to admit he simply didn’t want to join the decathlon team, or any group activity for that matter. Morita nodded as if Peter’s silence had involved a vocal and enthusiastic agreement. “Yes, I think this is going to be a good opportunity to reset and establish good habits with like minded peers. They’re meeting tomorrow in the library. 4 PM. Don’t be late.”
“Rogers? The hell—JARVIS, what the hell? What the fuck is Cap gonna do, huh?” Steve hadn’t heard Tony that drunk in years, probably not since the immediate aftermath of him being outed as a sub. It triggered nearly ever Dominant instinct he had to protect and soothe and support; with no potential outlet for any of those compulsions, his skin immediately felt too tight around his bones and muscle.
“Want to do it now?” Tony blinked. Then blinked again. If this entire day had been a particularly elaborate dream, he was going to be really pissed. He’d finally figured out the quickest route between the admin floors of SHIELD and the cafeteria, and if the whole thing had been a dream he was never going to find the actual place.
While I hesitate to immerse myself too deeply in Stark’s psyche, I would suggest that all current evidence indicates that not only does Stark take joy in this, but there is nothing quiet about it.
Content Warnings: Steve alludes briefly to past and somewhat ongoing tensions between himself and Bucky about the latter's increased need for high levels of pain in his scenes following his time with HYDRA. Steve has reacted badly to this in the past, but (and he reflects on this directly) it's not a matter of wanting to shame anyone for their kinks and more about mourning who Bucky was, and struggling with seeing HYDRA's effects on him in such an intimate setting. If you want to avoid this, skip the paragraph that begins "And that was...rather a kind understatement", as well as the paragraph after it. (It will, however, be a sub-plot that comes up again since Steve and Bucky's relationship is still healing from those issues.)
“Tell me something else, Steve. It doesn’t have to be in any kind of order. Remember I’m not looking for something comprehensive or even sensible like a mission report. All I want is your narrative. Anything that you think of when your mind goes back to that day.”
“My magic will respond to some degree to what and who you hope to see. Try not think of all of them at once; go slowly, one at a time, or it will undoubtedly overwhelm your mind.”
“I’ll also need you to agree to take tomorrow off from SHIELD work entirely. At that point it will be your choice if you wish to have company or not, but regardless, I don’t want anyone’s life in your hands for at least 24 hours. You’ll spend the day engaged in some of the self-care practices we’ve discussed, and you will call my cell, not my office, if you require further support. These terms are non-negotiable, and if I find out you have violated any of them I am not remotely afraid of placing you under a temporary psychiatric hold. Your safety, and that of the people around you, is always my priority. Are we clear?”
“Yeah, she’s pretty cool. I’ve never heard anyone describe things the way she does. There’s this bit about—well it’s about love and touching and stuff, but it’s not just, it’s…” Peter trailed off with a hopeless groan. He flipped frantically through the text to find the passage before Gwen walked away disgusted. Disgusted that, by all appearances, he was using an extremely obvious come-on from a book that clearly meant a lot to her. When he finally found what he was looking for, she seized the book and began to read before Peter could change his mind.
“Good,” he said again, a hint of a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. “You’ve eaten?” Recalling the item on the checklist about honorifics, Tony faltered, unsure how to address the man in front of him. He settled for avoiding the matter altogether and replied only with a jerky nod. “Excellent. Then why don’t you go get yourself comfortable in the living room, alright? I’ll be in in just a second.”
“Yeah I know it is. And I bet it feels so good to get cleaned off after working so long down there, hmm? All fresh and new again. Soon you’ll be able to just slide into some pajamas and curl up in bed for some rest.”
He kissed Thor then, standing on the tips of his toes and laughing at the absurdity of their height disparity. Thor kissed with the same wild joy and contained power that he’d demonstrated outside, and Tony laughed again as they broke just because he could, because it felt so unexpectedly wonderful to be able to laugh at a moment like this. Thor grinned back in return. But then, because the domestic thing was not just an act, he added,
Emotional breakthroughs did not, unfortunately, heal hangovers, and once the food was eaten and the remains of the Maintenance Day festivities cleaned up, all Tony really wanted to do was sleep. But as he watched Barnes wave his goodbyes to Dummy and teasingly bid him to bring a pail upstairs for Tony, he had a niggling feeling that he’d left something undone.
The orgasm tore through him, powerful and instantaneous, and it didn’t matter that it left Tony absolutely shattered in its wake, not when the rest of the team was already moving to crowd around them, to hold all of those broken pieces and eventually put them back together, stronger than before.
“You’re going to give it everything you’ve got, Cap,” he said firmly. “Until you do you’re not really going to believe it, and you’ll never sleep. Come on.”
After that, it started coming back in bursts. Some of it he was positive happened—he definitely sang a song, and yelled at MJ about Tony, and threw up. (That last one he’d known just from the fact that his throat was still raw.) Other bits, like talking to Doctor Banner on the phone, were a little iffy, and could just as easily be some kind of dream sequence generated by his drunk, depressed brain. Some, like having an asthma attack, would have to be outright fictions. Peter hasn’t had an asthma attack in years.
“If we pick off too many at once they’re gonna retreat or call in backup” Steve explained as he pointed at a portion of the digital projection of the Tower he was manipulating. “But each of these should take out around 3 or 4 of ‘em at once, enough to thin the heard and distract them from realizing we’re essentially directing them through the Tower exactly the way we want.”
“Whatever magic the Soul Stone used to get you here was powerful but not remotely delicate; it tore a slight hole in the fabric between the universes that could easily be worsened by frequent travel. Even their Strange and myself have limited our communications for this reason. Furthermore, the potential complications to your health given the distinctions between them are significant. If you choose that universe you would not be able to safely return to this one. The same is true of the reverse.”
“Bit impatient,” he observed. Tony had no response to that other than to think ‘of fucking course,’ but he quickly realized the remark hadn’t been intended for him. Bruce was speaking almost like Tony wasn’t there at all, or at least didn’t need to be addressed directly. And fuck if that didn’t
Steve didn’t trust himself to be in the room any longer, not without either embracing this man or screaming at him for being so fucking close to what Steve had wished for all these years but
“Technically she does technically still own 12% of the place,” Steve mused. The weak joke was as much for his own sake as it was Clint’s, because now that he had context for some of Tony’s behaviour (the blanket, the way he was seated closer to Pepper than they would usually have done), Steve could easily have kicked her out of the Tower himself. Clint flipped him off and dumped an entire bag of dill pickle chips (Steve’s least favourite snack of all time) into a bowl. Then he dug his hand in, grabbed a handful of chips and began eating. Loudly. With his mouth open. “Okay, okay, sorry. Look, it’s awful timing, it really is. And one day when things aren’t so new and tenuous with you all, you can maybe set up some boundaries around who and what is permitted to interrupt any portion of a scene including the aftercare. But if you didn’t do that ahead of time then you can’t fairly be pissed at either of them.”
“Ugh, Coulson I swear I’m going to get you for this. Look, SI is going well, and I’m grateful for that. In my universe it was something I always regretted, because these people had stuck with me through the switch over from weapons and I pretty much had to abandon them to deal with Thanos. Not my proudest moment. But it’s not enough. And it’s all made a little more complicated by the fact that I really think…I think I might be done with Iron Man.”
over a pot of spicy chai that Bruce had brought back from his travels. Unlike most of the academics Steve had ever met, Bruce was excellent at translating his specialized knowledge, and he actually enjoyed reading and discussing popular scientific texts marketed to the broader public. They hadn’t done this in a while, because like so many traditions that had existed before their Tony’s death, Steve had only been able to see what had been missing in the aftermath: their Tony’s grumpy commentary, his attempts to avoid becoming involved in their conversations, which always ended in Bruce drawing him in with clever questions even Tony’s brilliant mind didn’t expect. Half the time those discussions had ended in arguments that went way over Steve’s head, but it had been more than worth it to watch his two geniuses, lit up and excited by one another’s unmatched intelligence.
Steve’s room was the worst kind of quiet. Betrayal and hurt hang heavy and thick in the air. No one is looking at each other. Sam wishes, not for the first time, that he’d landed himself with a team full of slightly more emotionally competent people.
“Stimulates sexual desire,” Tony interrupted impatiently, yelping when Bruce picked up an eraser from one of the desks and chucked it at him.
In a matter of hours, Tony and Talia were thick as thieves. Masdee feigned annoyance at the frequent absence of her partner over the days that followed, but Steve knew her well enough by now to be able to recognize the joy and pride as she watched her submissive bond so quickly and easily with another sub. Not so long ago Talia likely would have rejected a friendship with Tony as a reflex, too afraid of seeing any of herself reflected back in someone who shared her orientation. Now they were damn near giggling over some shared joke and swapping tools with the ease of people who had known each other for years rather than a matter of days. Steve watched from the window and, after a moment of hesitation, glanced at Masdee.
Thus far during their time with the MCU Tony, the D/s team has chosen to keep scenes fairly limited in scope. However, they absolutely do partake of scenes and sexual encounters as a group. Both the Tower and the Malibu home contain playrooms designed for this purpose, which I will say no more about now since you are fairly likely to encounter them in the near future.
Steve was inspecting the visible portions of his chair like the thing was entirely alien to him. There wasn’t, honestly, all that much to see. Like most of the furniture Tony had selected for Steve’s personal floor, it was simple and classic: warm brown leather and sleek lines. The leather was scratched in a couple of places; the one Steve has just run his index finger over was by far the deepest of the marks, originating from a mishap between Dummy and a stray kitten Hulk had once smuggled into the Tower after a mission. There was a chip in the wood veneer on the front of the armrest too, the result of Steve losing his temper in the early days of his residency here and breaking a glass. He considered with bitter self-depreciation how easy it is for him to mentally recount the history behind every imperfection on this meaningless piece of furniture compared to what he was actually being asked to discuss. Which was of course, the same thing he’s been asked about for three sessions now: the day they’d lost Tony.
As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns about tagging or anything else.
Content Notes: Warnings for canon-typical violence for the first half of the chapter, especially the first section. (Specifically descriptions of blood/bleeding, broken bones, and threats of more intensive violence which are not realized.) Some fairly important things happen around those events, so if you want to avoid maybe drop me a line so we can sort out a redacted version.
“We used a tool I’ve had for a while. And Bucky’s real good at being still when he needs to be; pain is almost more a meditation for him than anything else. The marks never last long because of the serum, but it’s worth it to get to see ‘em for a while.”
he suddenly remembered Phil asking, and felt his gut clench with equal parts anticipation and a fearful kind of longing.
“In fact I haven’t. Mainly because there’s a stack of outstanding reports with your name on them on my desk.” Clint blew a raspberry, and Steve attempted to keep his stern scowl in place. He’d actually had a chance to miss his partners this week, Steve realized. Between work and many of them catching up with friends or individual hobbies and pursuits they’d neglected on vacation, they’d spent more time without one another than they had…probably since Tony had crashed into their lives.
And speaking of questions, remember you can #AskStrange too! The Doctor didn't have any work to do after chapter two and we can't gave him getting too complacent...
“A bit. Kinda hard not to be conscious of the things I’ll never be able to offer no matter how hard I try. Especially when it’s not like the comparison is just in my head.”
“Did he know? Your—did he know, what you did to his parents? Before he put that arm on you, did you tell him? Did Steve?” The air compressor Barnes had recently used to clean You’s rear vent nearly slipped from his hand. His head stayed bowed for a few seconds longer, but then he raised it to look Tony squarely in the face. (For the first time, he regretted how little he had known of Barnes in his own world. Reading his expression was virtually impossible.)
That hope dimmed a little when he returned to his room to find an extremely irritable James Barnes, who despite agreeing the night before, was now entirely disinterested in calling his therapist for a phone session.
Then had come the extended argument over which designer to use. Rhodey, who had teleconferenced in to every one of the conversations he hadn’t been able to be personally present for, had noted that Tony’s appreciation for both quality and showmanship might mean he’d like one made by one of the major brands. And certainly there was no shortage of options to choose from; every major jewelry and accessory designer in the world had a line of collars. None of the ones they had reached out to, however, were willing to guarantee that Tony’s collar would not be the only one of its kind, and that was a deal-breaker for the entire team. They were more than used to having everything from their superhero garb to their most random daily clothing noted and copied; an ancient sweater Clint had worn a few months prior had garnered so much interest that the company had started making it again after retiring the design nearly a decade prior. But this was different; they were all determined that this one thing would belong to Tony and Tony alone.
“I believe I said PG, Sir.” Seeing Steve shiver at the title had absolutely nothing on feeling the way his frame shook, rocking Tony’s entire body with it. (Nothing Tony had ever done or would ever do made him feel quite so powerful as having that particular effect on Steve. He hoped it never wore off.) “You need to sleep.”
understood until that day how powerful she was. The kid was just a projection she had made with her magic, powerful and realistic enough that it could be heard and seen, but completely without substance. She needed…she said she needed to make sure that Tony knew he was about to—to die for nothing. That he didn’t get to be a hero. I tried to tell him we were coming, we’d be there soon, but she cut the comms. I don’t know if he heard, I don’t…” Steve would never know what the last thing Tony had ever heard was. Didn’t know, wasn’t sure he wanted to know, if it had been Steve’s own words of reassurance, or if Wanda had spoken any more to him before she’d taken his life. “I raced there as quickly as I could. I don’t know how many I took out on the way there, I had this horrible feeling…but before I was even to the warehouse, I looked up and there was Iron Man. Only it wasn’t…I’d seen him fight so many times by then. It was always like…well, I compared it once to watching the ballet with Natasha. The suit was huge and powerful, but he always moved so smoothly and gracefully in it. And every attack was precise, with exactly enough power to incapacitate but never seriously harm unless it was unavoidable. This…this wasn’t like that. I watched the suit kill five enemies with a single unibeam blast. No hesitation, no warning, nothing. I knew then that something was wrong, kept trying to talk Tony down, call him off…but I didn't realize until afterwards that that…that had been JARVIS grieving. He had just lost his creator and his best friend, and he wanted to kill every single person who had contributed to that loss. He didn’t stop until there was no one left. He waited until the rest of the team got back, so I wasn’t alone…that’s when he finally landed the armour and told us…that he’d lost Tony’s vitals forty-seven minutes and thirteen seconds before. He was dead. It had been quick and, from what JARVIS's sensors could tell painless, the kind of death only magic can give you. But Tony wasn’t coming back.” Silence filled the room. Domen probably thought he was done. Hell, Steve had thought he was done. “I didn’t talk to JARVIS for months afterward, you know. I was so unbelievably angry that he'd waited, that he’d followed Tony’s ridiculous Avalon protocol….I made him stop monitoring my floor, and the rest of the team helped me install manual controls for the things JARVIS used to handle like lighting and climate control. It was so petty, such a foolish thing to—”
“Rhodey and I used to drink this by the box in college!” The second he undid the screw top, May had seized the bottle back from his hands. The kicked puppy look she received in return might have been effective on a May even five years younger. Today it just made her laugh.
“If you really love me, you won’t ask me what happened.” This was the closest Tony had ever come to acknowledging and accepting what were now Steve’s repeated declarations of love for him, so Steve felt he could be forgiven for the fact that his brain went briefly offline for a period of several seconds. Eventually, however, he did collect himself enough to press the matter.
Oh gosh. Oh gosh. We're 130,000 words in and these two are finally just acknowledging that they want to be together. I did warn it was a slow burn, didn't I? In seriousness, I know all of us (including me!) have been dying to get here for ages. I sincerely hope it felt worth the wait.
“Oh, hey, I almost forgot: some of you might have seen Melissa Collins, head of CNOW, come in today. She was scheduled to meet with a senior member of SI this morning because we had hoped that the organization’s stance against trans-orientation, and even recognizing social factors as a factor in orientation, had softened with time and consideration as many do. Unfortunately, CNOW remains committed to an extremely rigid and exclusive definition of orientation—and, honestly, a terrible name, and this is coming from the guy in a relationship with several employees of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. I want to reiterate that this is entirely out of line with Stark Industries’ views and commitments. While I particularly want to thank Mr. Fletcher for his valiant attempts to open a dialogue, there are simply some topics about which there cannot be compromise; as far as I and SI are concerned, the right of all individuals to dignity, safety, and self-determination is one of them. And now I should really get back in there before they realize my lunch break has been about an hour too long.”
“Pepper asked me if I knew who someone named Peter was. You kept calling out for him in your sleep, she said.” When his hand began to shake with far more violence, she reached out to take the mostly empty mug from him, setting it down on the counter and taking his hand in hers instead. (It was the first time anyone from the team had touched him at all since the revelation of his lack of orientation. If he’d had any tears left this definitely would have drawn them.) “She wasn’t gossiping, Tony, she was…concerned that he had maybe been a lover, that the others wouldn’t help you look for him if that meant losing you.”
“I guess…I mean, at first I was just focused on crisis management. He was so unwell, had been for so long. Even the simplest things were huge struggles, and I was constantly terrified that if I didn’t win every single one of them, make him see what he was doing to himself and convince him to let me in, that he’d…we’d lose him.” Pepper nodded with what looked to be genuine agreement. She’d seen it in different ways than Steve had, of course, but he supposed that she was still just as familiar as they were with how unstable Tony had been before he’d been outed as a submissive. “Maybe it was starting out that way, or maybe I was just inclined to a certain amount of—I think the word my therapist uses is codependency. I was still healing from what had happened to me, and it felt like the easiest and most natural thing in the world to focus everything in my  life around the team, Tony especially. I didn’t even know how completely it had happened until he was gone and I felt like I had nothing left.’
“I’m not—I wasn’t—” Phil edged a single step closer. It was easy to forget how big Phil was, especially since he spent half his time in the company of men like Steve and Thor, and without his musculature on display in skin-tight battle gear. His current outfit wasn’t hiding a damn thing, though, and Tony alternated between staring shamelessly at the other man’s thighs yet again (he was going to burn every pair of pants Coulson owned that weren’t jeans after today, just watch if he didn’t) and trying to control the impulse to crack a joke or take other, more dramatic, evasive maneuvers. Then Coulson backed three steps away. His posture loosened, and the smile he gave Tony would have been almost playful except for something in his eyes that sent another thrill of anticipatory longing through Tony.
“I didn’t, I didn’t do anything for the three of you.”  Even as he spoke the words Tony’s exhaustion and the encompassing depth of his subspace were obvious; taking him down any further tonight could easily have wound up making Tony panicked, or required the kind of aftercare that would have put the rest of their plans on hold for days. Bruce had made the right call, even if Tony clearly didn’t agree right now.
As reality set in, the energy in the room turned barbed and prickling. The signs of unease were everywhere; Bucky, too restless to remain still, was standing, weight shifting from foot to foot. Clint, who was almost never still
Tony was still tingling from a combination of science and post-date high the next morning when he stepped into the kitchen to hear a voice coming from the ceiling. It did not, despite Thor’s jesting the day before, belong to JARVIS.
Before he’d delivered the last of his worries into Natasha’s hands for safe-keeping, Phil had hesitated. Not for long, but enough of a break from the almost musical rhythm of the exchange to be noticeable; quickly, Tony had attempted to feign interest in the medical drama playing out on the screen in front of him.
“You’re right.” Which, the Steve in this universe had said several remarkable things in all the time Tony had known him, but that one honestly might win for most shocking. Steve, backing down from a fight? Steve, admitting he was wrong without first beating something (or someone) up?
Content Notes: While there's nothing I think could be considered remotely explicit in this chapter, we do get some hints at teenage romance and D/s dynamics. If you want to avoid that, stop reading at the sentence beginning "And then he finds himself turning..." and pick up again after he section break.
Which meant Steve shouldn’t have been surprised by the request, nor by the fact that Bucky had insisted on their going out together. If nothing else, Steve had been optimistic about the meal; post-HYDRA, Bucky tended toward hedonism with food in particular. He always kept an eye out for new, up-and-coming spots to try, and he was rarely wrong.
For a matter of seconds, temptation strained Tony’s features to the point of near unrecognizability. A relationship with a kid he considered his own was going from a distant, hopeful possibility to something suddenly within his grasp. All Tony had to do was reach out and take it. For Steve, there was something unimaginably difficult and yet deeply familiar about the scenario. He’d felt a variation on the same thing when a version of his dead partner had first stumbled into their living room: the desire to hold on all the harder because it didn’t seem quite right, and was likely to be torn away just as easily as it had suddenly been offered.
He sticks around just laughing and catching up with Rhodes longer than he really intended. Rhodey tells him all about his work with SWORD, the planets he’s visited, the various alien races he’s had the chance to work with. It would be easy for him to make Sam feel small in the fact of that, but Rhodes asks plenty of questions. He’s particularly interested in the work Sam has been doing with folks who have been displaced by efforts to shut down borders and find housing for the Returned.
“I…sorry,” he muttered to Dr. Domen who waved an assuring hand while Steve tried and failed to figure out where he’d actually put the device itself. “JARVIS, just patch it through to the house system please.”
Before this, Tony would probably have said that he’d been touched in this area pretty much every way that existed; it was still fun, of course, but not a whole lot new. But Phil wasn’t pulling him off or teasing in any of the ways Tony was familiar with. He was massaging, just as surely as Thor had done on his other side. He rolled Tony’s balls in his hands for while, then worked near his pubic bone, and on his perineum. The latter had always been the prelude to penetrative sex in the past, and Tony lifted his hips in invitation only to have them pressed back down against the pillow.
“I should have kept him here longer. He might not be ready, and he’ll never forgive me if he drops in public, or—” Bruce wrapped two heavy arms around her waist, leaning down to brush a kiss against the back of her neck.
Specific notes for the sex itself: Tony has a strong emotional response to tantric massage. This is actually pretty common, and is not a sign of any emotional distress on his part, but if you want to avoid it, skip from when Phil and Thor enter until the send of that section.
“I mean, depending on who exactly you were speaking to they might buy you a beer if they thought you had something to do with it.” And then, because Dr. Domen’s words were always chosen with care, and never casual even when they appeared to be so, he considered the question he knew her to be truly asking.
“Look, I have seen footage, and I still can’t actually believe people say it like that.” This time several of them laughed, which was unexpected, but highly preferable to them looking they might cry or break things. (Cap’s hand was still bandaged from earlier, a decision he had loudly decried as an attempt to shame him. Given that the serum had already haled the actual wound, Steve was probably right about that one.)
“Are you the reason he’s been getting in so much trouble, getting hurt the way he has been? Because I swear to God, I don’t care how rich or powerful you are, or that you’re back from the dead or whatever—”
“Phil is a cat-4 switch, which means he’s heavily inclined toward submission. I think he needs to spend some time in at least a shallow form of headspace this morning, so I’m going to put him there and care for him. While he’s down I’m going to ask that you not direct any questions to him, but you’re welcome to observe what we’re doing and ask myself or Clint anything you’d like.”
And yes, btw, the identity of Peter's frenemy in Decathalon is supposed to be somewhat of a mystery. Gotta keep y'all on your toes!
“Starkly Sub-lime Cheesecake?” she offered. Tony had a moment to ponder whether or not it was worth being annoyed that even the Ben & Jerry’s flavour named after him on this side had to reference Mark II’s orientation, but that internal debate was largely settled when he tasted the bright, bold flavour of the dessert. (Truth be told, Stark Raving Hazlenuts was chalky, even if he would never permit Strange the satisfaction of admitting it.)
Tony wanted to be comforted by the sight of the bag being used by that way, as yet another indication of how committed the Bruce in this universe was to staying rather than leaving.
Clint was the best possible choice for something like this, that almost-condescension thing he played at perfect for the angle Bruce was going for. Soon a set of calloused hands settled themselves on his mouth, casually manipulating his jaw and tongue as if they were just objects to be better arranged to bring Bruce pleasure.
“Officers!” Steve called, stepping forward shield-hand first, leaving no doubt as to who he was. “Everything under control? Do you need any support?” The ensuing delay was brief, but it gave Spiderman the time he needed to slip out off the bodega and take to the air, swinging smoothly from building to building with a speed that would have made Steve nauseous to even look at in his pre-serum days.
“Your intent was extremely kind, but none of us would have chosen for you to have to digest that kind of news alone,” Coulson had said, hesitating before placing a hand on Tony’s knee. “Do you have any questions that we can answer? Even the media is hardly going to be crass enough to quiz you on the more immediate details of what happened," Pepper made a noise of disagreement there that Coulson ignored temporarily, "but if you need context or…or if you want to talk through any of it, we’re all at your disposal.”
“Hey Pete?” The kid stopped in his tracks, allowing Steve to catch sight of the fraying backpack he wore. The mask to the Spiderman costume was stuck in the zipper. “Tell your aunt soon, okay? If you accept it, the job is going to start after the holiday break and I don’t want to lose a perfectly good intern because of any drama coming out of that.” Peter didn’t speak or even turn back around, but Tony nodded as if he his words had been acknowledged and then watched until the elevator doors glided smoothly closed.
. He had come, and maybe that meant he hadn’t given up on Tony altogether. Maybe there was something left, still, to fight for.
“SHIELD is…I don’t regret staying. I’m the one who tore it apart, and I had a responsibility to build it back up and not just leave it in ruins.” For just a moment, Tony thought of his own universe, of helicarriers littering the Potomac, of the world left behind in chaos while Steve chased Bucky, and he loved this Steve so fiercely he very nearly interrupted the conversation with sex for a second time. “But I’ve also taken the agency as far as I think I know how to take it. The things it needs now, they’re exactly what you did the other day when you came in and told me everything that was wrong about how we handle kids; it needs fresh blood, news eyes.”
If Tony hadn’t already been naked in front of Rhodey for the past 24 hours, he undoubtedly would have felt way more embarrassed at the sight he made: kneeling and strapped face-down to a piece of furniture the team had called a spanking bench (which, could it not at least have a less embarrassing name?), his ass in the air and his legs cuffed down a foot or so apart. The thing was well padded, which was probably the only reason that lying with so much of his weight on his chest and hips wasn’t painful; the team had also forgone the strap that could have been buckled across his back to reduce the pressure. It wasn’t exactly a comfortable position, but at least for now that had way more to do with emotional strain than physical.
“I know you’re comforted by training right now. I know it makes you feel safe and secure. But there’s more than one way to care for ourselves, and for him. He needs this, Steve. He needs it more than I could have possibly hoped.” Bruce might have gone on to say more, but at the sound of Steve’s name, Tony’s head darted up, eyes frantically searching the room.
Another strong, fact-based question. The weeks where I am able to avoid inquiries about Stark’s emotional state remain by far my favourites.
Natasha had then reported, in the flattened tones Phil recognized from plenty of after-action debriefs, that in Tony’s world he had faced the Mandarin alone, with some aid from Colonel Rhodes. (No wonder Tony always looked to his friend so much in this world; increasingly it sounded like Rhodes and Pepper had been his only constants.) Phil added that under the category that specifically tracked divergences in major Avengers-level threats, right below ‘didn’t know Steve was head of SHIELD until told.’
Awkwardness over Iron Man aside (he really was just going to have to suck it up and get the suit repaired one of these days), it was a relief to step through the doors of SI. During the extensive negotiations he’d gone through with the team about all the 24/7 stuff they wanted to try, he had been pretty insistent on having a full day off from all of it—the check-ins, the pictures, the food, he’d asked for one day a week where none of it happened, and the team had been happy to honour the request. No one had even gotten on Tony’s case about double-fisting coffee and an energy drink this morning.
“I think that sounds like a good idea,” May agreed, not giving a still-conflicted Peter the chance to reply first. He glared halfheartedly, but looked away when she cocked a challenging eyebrow at him. When her gaze fell again on Tony, it was far gentler than it had been for the rest of the morning. “Whatever else happens, I really respect your honesty. I know there are a lot of other ways you could have gone about this, and you chose one that I know would put everything you all have built here at risk if it got out. And you chose knowing you would piss my kid off now over devastating him later, which…it’s still going to take me a while to adjust to even the idea of having co-parented with Tony Stark, but it’s a start.”
Tony also makes reference to the backstory about his own relationship to the soul stone, which was dealt with in one of the Ask Strange responses. So if you feel lost, make sure to refer back there!
So, this chapter was initially going to be pushing toward some of the more intense, dramatic and plotty stuff that's coming, but the world is a scary and difficult place just now. I needed some tenderness, and thought you might too. I hope you enjoyed the chapter, and as always I value your comments, kudos and questions.
“Steve, you are not being set adrift. I would only ever be a phone call away. And I already have a colleague I think would be perfect to take over your care. If you give me permission, we can start the transfer pretty much immediately. It might take a few extra days because of the additional rounds of screening and legal documentation he’ll need to fill out, but you would probably still be able to get in for a first meeting by late next week if you wanted.”
“Give me one reason. One damn good reason that you’d send this to my office without notice for explanation. For why you’d lie to your Dominants, your friends, and hole up down here without the slightest regard for your safety or basic hygiene, from the smell of things down here. Convince me so that I don’t use this very handy suit to just haul you up to them right now, Tony, because so help me—”
“From what I understand, Colonel Rhodes has already been taking care of Tony unofficially for a few days now. I would suggest that, if they both agree, we formalize that arrangement. That way Tony can still get the things he needs without feeling additional anxiety about our expectations or desires for the future.”
He arrived home from practice tired but buzzing with the kind of energy he hadn’t felt since—hell, maybe since the bite. Definitely not since Ben had died, when it had felt like accepting his responsibility meant turning away from everything else in his life. Right now he felt, well, like a kid. And even the crappy parts of that, like having no idea what the hell he was doing with his love life, felt kind of awesome, because at least no one lived and died by whether or not Peter ever managed to land a date. For once, he was having the same kind of problems that everyone else was having.
After a few days, even Bucky had mostly stopped coming by. Bucky mourned Tony, and Steve knew he regretted that the two of them had never had a chance to really make peace about everything that had happened in Siberia. But Bucky, like the others, also wanted to get on with the work of re-making the world and his own life, honouring Tony’s sacrifice by not wasting any more time.
And of course Phil was pissed, possibly more pissed than any of the team. The man took his job as handler extremely seriously, and while Steve hadn’t actively lied to anyone, he also had been far from truthful. All of them had seemed to assumed that he was practicing some long-distance Domming with other members of the team, and Steve simply…hadn’t corrected any of them. Not a lie, but definitely not the full disclosure they had all come to expect from one another.
“I’m bored. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not looking for end of the world style intrigue, but I can’t just sit around all day except when you guys want me to play good little sub. Despite my reputation back in the day, I’ve never been good with that much leisure time.”
Bucky and Sam sprang into action pretty much immediately after that. Steve was halfheartedly participating in their extremely thorough search of the compound, still somewhat in denial that any of this was happening. Then he stopped mid-stride and slapped his own forehead.
“JARVIS, turn the TV off. Actually, is it possible for you to cut  the wifi and cellular data to the floor entirely, along with any non-essential power outlets? With allowances for any emergent communications?” His first instruction to the team had gone entirely ignored, but the loss of the trash TV they were watching and their suddenly useless phones finally got their attention. Phil looked up, glassy-eyed, from the game he’d been playing on his phone that seemed to involve giving people virtual haircuts.
“Alright, sweetheart, since you don’t seem all that interested in food let’s have you head straight down to Bruce. I think you could use a bit of help this morning, and you always come out of check-ins in a better mood than you go into them.”
“If you want to punish me for not being him I guess that’s your prerogative. If you could just…give me a two hour head start or so? Before you tell the others I’ve left? Can you do that for me, at least, Ms. Potts?” He was unsurprised when the clicking of her heels started up again, and prepared for a slap or at least the shrill pitch of Pepper’s voice that only came out when she really, truly screamed. Instead, she planted herself directly in the middle of the path he’d been tracing around the shop and cocked an eyebrow.
“Tony.” But Tony had exactly zero interest in waiting for Bruce to figure out how to let him down gently.
