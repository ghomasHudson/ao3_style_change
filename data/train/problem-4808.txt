“Of course.”
The three each went to their own closets to get ready and met up in a little less than an hour. Cas was having a little trouble tying his tie correctly, so he entered the main room of the bunker last.
“Why not?” No answer. Dean waited at the door for a moment.
“Y-You can come in,” Cas said, barely audibly through the thick wall.
The next second, there was Dean.
Cas nodded. He braced himself as Dean counted down again.
“Only if you tell me what cologne you’re wearing. You smell fucking awesome.” Cas blinked dumbly as Dean crawled into bed next to him. He wrapped his arms around Cas and he prickled slightly.
Dean spread out against the headboard, slightly propped up so he could help Cas. Cas swung a leg over Dean’s pelvis and met his eyes anxiously.
The only sound was their panting from the exertion.
“Nope!” his eyes flashed black. “I don’t think so.” Well, that explains the super-strength. Cas panicked, and brought his leg up as hard as he could, his knee colliding with the demon’s groin. Cas was able to wriggle free, but all this appeared to do was piss the demon off.
There was no answer, but Dean didn’t need one. He knew his angel was out there, and he knew he had heard him. Cas needed his help and he was going to do whatever he could to provide it.
“Let me help.”
“Please,” Cas blinked, his own scent of dense trees and fresh clay acquiring a slight burn. “Just- Just come closer. Please.”
“No, no, it’s all good. What’s got you all worked up?” Dean asked, stroking Cas’ hair as he waited for a response. Cas’ breath hitched.
“Let’s stop apologizing,” Cas said hurriedly. “Like you said. Moving forward.”
“No, no, don’t worry about it. I can take care of it. Oh, here. Let me get you a key,” the young woman said quickly, disappearing behind the desk for a moment and returning with a room key. She didn’t take their name. Rookie mistake. “Room 213. Down the hall and hang a right.”
“Aren’t you a little tied up at the moment?” The demon cut Cas’ arm quickly and violently with the angel blade. Cas inhaled sharply and tried to breathe through the pain.
Cas turned, his body unfurling slightly under Dean’s intoxicating scent. He could smell the alpha in him coming out- an extra kick of smoke in Dean’s syrupy-sweet bourbon scent. “Why?”
“Mhmm.”
Dean allowed him some more silence.
“He’ll have the same thing as us.” Dean said, more to Cas than to the waiter. He wrote it down anyways.
“Cas… I’m really happy I could help. I know it was tough and I’m glad you trust me.” Cas continued to avoid his gaze. “I think you’re beautiful.”
Cas shouted in Enochian between broken moans, gasping out monosyllabic phrases as he gripped the sheets tightly. His wings twitched along with the wild movements of his hips. His glassy, pleading eyes, pierced right into Dean’s as he continued begging hoarsely in that beautiful, ancient language.
There was a thick-skinned, blotchy spot of tissue where the base of Cas’ wings used to meet his body. It was a dark, nearly black color that contrasted the smooth, tan color of his skin. Dean figured it was best not to touch the wound after learning how sensitive Cas’ wings were, and he figured that they were connected in some way.
Once he was done with Cas’ arm, he pressed the washcloth to his chest. Cas winced. Dean placed his other hand on Cas’ thigh for a moment to steady his mind. Aside from the large cut from his collarbone to just above his pectorals, his chest was littered with scrapes and bruises. Once he was done cleaning the blood from Cas’ chest, Dean started threading a sewing needle that Sam had brought in with dental floss. Dean poured whiskey onto a cotton pad and pressed it to the cut. All Cas did was inhale and shut his eyes.
Cas unfolded one of the hands around his stomach and reached out to Dean. “Please, stay. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Cas, if you’re using up your Grace on me-”
Dean blinked, unsure of how to respond. “You’re gonna to have to help me out here.”
Cas grinded his hips towards Dean, who only countered the motion backwards. “A-Ah, three, Dean,
A few minutes of walking later, Dean noticed that the trees were becoming more sparse. “I think there’s a clearing up ahead.” He took a moment to look at his surroundings more carefully. “Going through instead of around looks to be the quickest option. Ready?”
__________
Dean cut him off by stabbing his angel blade through the demon’s stomach. He gagged and flickered for a moment before falling limply onto the ground. Dean pulled out the angel blade.
“Hey, I won’t tell,” Dean said, smiling. “It sure sounds like it would be more comfortable.”
“Yes, that’s fine, thank you,” Cas said as Dean helped him slide the black t-shirt over his head. He shifted as the fabric draped over his back so that it didn’t rub against his scar too violently. Dean swung his legs over the edge of the bed and Cas leaned on him for support as he put on the blue jeans. Both articles of clothing were a bit big on him, but he didn’t mind. They were breathable enough to keep Cas’ sensitive skin relatively pain free.
“Actually, both of our wallets are missing. Can we stay here for the night? I promise I can make it up to you.” Dean clutched Cas a bit tighter, half out of impatient concern, half for dramatic effect, showing a sad half-smile as he did so.
Cas’ throat was releasing quiet whines from behind his closed mouth as Dean’s hand worked him deliberately. He was overstimulated again, but there was little he could do but learn to marvel at the new sensation. His hand reached for Dean’s- a silent plea for comfort in this terribly human madness- and their fingers interlocked as Cas hurtled towards the edge.
” he tried, somewhat exhausted from being awake. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what’s wrong with me… I seem to have undergone severe physical trauma.”
“I’m glad they enjoyed the show.” Dean said, finally relaxing a little bit, coming down from his rock-induced high.
“You were beautiful, though,” Dean said, his eyes grazing over Cas. “You are beautiful. You, uh, feel any better?”
“It’s great, thank you.” Sam said, taking another bite.
Against his better judgement, Dean smiled to himself. He was Cas’ world. Cas laughed, looking away from him.
“Dean, look around. More things will be coming for us soon if we don’t go. Now. This is no world to live in. I don’t want this for you…” His mistakes had caused Dean so much pain. “I deserve to die for how I betrayed you. I left you behind. It’s time you returned the favor.”
Dean walked next to Cas and examined him, trying not to disturb him too much. His body was covered in as many cuts and scrapes as Deans was, and his brow was furrowed slightly as he slept. Dean pulled the towel off of Cas’ back to examine the damage there.
Cas groaned a bit, his eyes adjusting to the earthly sunlight. He coughed, his body curling in on itself as he woke.
What was a seraph without his wings?
“Thanks for making lemonade, I was in the mood for something sweet,” Dean said, pressing a kiss just below Cas’ collarbone.
“No. Come with me.”
“I think I know someone we could call. Who knows about angel stuff.”
“Yeah, I’ll call him.”
Dean hummed contently and kissed Cas, a silent thank you.
Dean thought. Guess his Humanity was still detectable. He thought about trying to direct Cas’ attention elsewhere, but he figured it would be better to just let the shower wash away their filth first.
“Not if you’re going to die. I won’t let it happen-”
“Cas? I-I promise I’ll - explain everything - I need your help.”
He tried not to think about anyone else. He was better off lonely than dead. The Monsters, the Leviathans… they didn’t care if Dean missed someone. They could smell the Humanity on him, and that made him an easy target. Any abomination would jump at the chance to kill Dean Winchester.
When he finally came back to the waking world, Dean was lying next to him, awake and waiting for Cas to stir.
“I’m certain of it,” Cas said, nodding firmly. “I’m prepared to go through this time, and I have you with me.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, sweetheart. You’ve got a long night ahead of you.” Cas decided he would try and keep pace with Dean instead, who’s glass was only half full.
“A-Ahhhhh, Dean!” Cas was full out sobbing as a force of arousal equal to a regular day’s orgasm hit him, the length of the feeling conjuring up more anxiety. It wasn’t over yet, and he knew it. “Please, p-please, please help me…” he said weakly through the spikes of pleasure racking his body.
“Whoa, baby, slow down,” Dean said, grasping the headboard for balance.
When Dean entered the motel, Cas in his arms, the young woman behind the front desk looked up to assist them. A surprised look crossed her face, and Dean remembered that both of them were caked in dirt and blood.
Cas had hoped he would be an alpha. He had figured that his fading angel status and personal character would code his human body as a more assertive presentation, but here he was, shaking feverishly with the strangest hunger deep inside his bones. He couldn’t bear to call for Dean’s help, although his love for Cas would make him willing to assist in any way he could. Cas’ embarrassment got the best of him, so he crawled into the freezing bathtub, breathing heavily as he waited for the wave to pass. He barely felt the cold water on his skin.
Dean and Castiel laid there for nearly an hour, not sleeping, just resting in silence together. Around lunchtime, Cas started to get fidgety.
Cas nodded. “I’m already starting to feel a little better, and the bones feel like they’re setting themselves back into place. The pain is less sharp; only the muscles are straining.” Cas gast his glance towards his left wing and stretched it out, scrunching up his nose as he did so. The tip of it blocked the sun and soft rays shone through the feathers, making them glow more than they already did. Dean nearly lost his mind.
“Cas? Are you there?”
“-I know, Cas. Let’s get somewhere safe first, okay? I don’t want you to wear yourself out.” Dean walked down the alleyway and peaked out into the street, holding up Cas as they walked.
It surprised Cas the first time. He had never cried before; his celestial powers could block it out. First came the breath, heavy in his chest, punched out of his lungs. Second came the initial sob; it shook his frame with the force of all his love’s loneliness. Third came the tears, tracking down his face, first in thin lines, then in thick beads that gathered on his lashes until they became too heavy and fell.
Dean pushed himself up so he could kiss Cas’ chest, finding that the skin there was just as warm. Cas was flushed a beautiful red, and the moans spilling from his mouth were so perfectly congenial they could have been pulled right out of Dean’s dreams.
All of a sudden, the creature darted out of the bushes, running the other direction from Dean and Cas. Dean took a few steps forward, gradually picking up speed. Cas lunged after him.
He couldn’t feel Cas, and that was what scared him.
“Home.” Unlike Dean, Cas feared the unknown, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t risk it all to get back to Earth.
Dean stumbled forward as he was pulled out of danger, falling to his knees as soon as Cas let go of his hand. Cas collapsed next to him and Dean rolled on to his back to look at the sky.
“These are the best damn pancakes I’ve ever had,” He said, taking another bite. Cas was silent until Sam started to laugh. He joined in, realizing his mistake. Dean smiled at both of them through a mouthful of pancakes.
“I gotcha,” Dean said, climbing onto the bed in front of Cas. “Lie down for me, angel, I’ll grab some lube-”
“Bad news?” Cas mumbled. Dean tossed him underwear, a worn Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and a pair of checkered pajama bottoms. There was an angel on the shirt, flying, sprawled out with thick, white-feathered wings. Cas swallowed his childish jealousy.
He whined again, louder, and more desperate. “
“Can you try and stand for me, Cas?” Dean asked tentatively, and Cas had to keep himself from audibly groaning in displeasure. He wasn’t even sure if he could, and he didn’t want to try. But he did, just because Dean asked him to. Dean stood up and held out his hands. Cas took them and pushed himself upwards quickly, getting light-headed in the process. “Whoa, whoa,” Dean said as he wrapped an arm around Cas’ back. “Too quick, darlin’. Be careful…”
The night held no answer.
“I forgive you,” Dean said, taking Cas’ other hand in his. “I understand why you did. Let’s just focus on moving forward, okay?” Dean started to lean his head in.
“This is nice.” Cas said, taking another bite. Dean nodded, chewing. It was an 80s themed diner, which was why Dean picked it. Cas’ attention turned to the music for a moment. It was some soft rock song that Cas recognized the tune of from inside the Impala. “I like the juke boxes. They’re so vibrant.” Cas said as Dean nodded along to the beat.
Dean wasn’t going to ask twice. That was all he needed to start spilling into Cas. At the peak of his orgasm, Cas’ eyes began glowing blue, adding to the energy of his pleasure. “Castiel!” he growled as he felt the angel’s grace rush through him. His vision went blurry, and all he felt for several moments was purely
“Wow… You’re going to have to teach me more about all this when we’re done,” Dean joked as he lined up at Cas’ entrance. He pushed inside and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth bottoming out felt. Cas was just as slick as he said he was. “Is this… is this okay?” Dean said, holding back to make sure Cas was alright first.
After Cas had calmed down, there was a bit of an awkward silence. Neither of them were sure what to do.
Cas was, frankly, frustrated that Dean didn’t feel his Grace. Their love was the same, but Dean’s perception was ever so slightly different. Dean’s love had a sacrificial, protective nature to it that Cas could feel at every hour of the day. Cas’ love was more open, ready to please and serve when needed. Nevertheless, Cas wasn’t stupid. He loved Dean, and he had time and time again given him everything he had. Cas wasn’t helpless. He could figure out how to get through to Dean.
However, Dean was still worried about Cas’ wings. The ends dragged on the ground on uneven terrain, and Cas seldom lifted them. Dean had no idea if it was easier to travel this way or if Cas wasn’t moving them because of some kind of pain. The feathers were growing back fuller now and they were still damaged, but to Dean, they were effortlessly beautiful.
When Dean moved to what was left along the coverts, Cas’ wing twitched suddenly. Dean moved his hand back when Cas let out a small sound of resignation.
The moment Cas’ pleas for
Shattered glass. Blood on the floor. No one in sight.
(See the end of the chapter for
His breath hitched and he did the only thing that seemed logical.
Dean slipped into the bathroom and shut the door behind him, his scent filling the room. Cas had his head turned away, but Dean sat down on the edge of the bathtub, trying to coax him out a little bit. Dean’s presence was comforting, but Cas was still fighting.
He inhaled through his teeth. “That’s good then. Do you know how long we’ve been here?”
“I went to cash out at the ATM earlier, we’ve got all the credit card money we could ask for. Plus, there’s a restaurant there.” Dean walked over to the center table and opened the drawer. He pulled out three stacks of money and tossed two to Cas and Sam. They were at least a couple inches thick, all twenties. “Hope I can get a good steak tonight.”
“Hey, Cas, look at me,” Dean said, placing the palm of his hand on the other side of Cas’ face. Cas turned to look at him, glassy-eyed and lost. “You’re safe now, okay?” Cas hesitated, but nodded. Dean went back to work. Cas’ forearm was still bleeding, so he put pressure on the wound and started to wrap it with a bandage.
“Thank you,” he breathed. Cas didn’t look at him. Dean hated seeing Cas so upset. He didn’t mind helping Cas with private matters; that’s what people who love each other do. Part of him was able to empathize with how Cas felt. It was probably hard to share something that private with another person, especially when that part of you was damaged. Cas said that even the Monsters thought his wings were ugly, but even damaged, Dean thought they were amazing.
“I, um… I actually would prefer if you assisted me, Dean,” Cas whispered, trying not to seem embarrassed. They loved each other deeply, but Cas preferred to keep this conversation clinical. “There aren’t many angels left, certainly no other Seraphim. I am the last one.”
Dean had spent all night coming up with a plan. He had been looking for a way out, but today, he decided to change his course. He began to head due east of where he originally planned on going, hoping it would shake up the pattern of Monsters and lead him to Cas.
“Can you walk, Cas?” Dean asked, opening the car door with his leg. Cas nodded, wincing as he sat up. Dean slid out of the car helped Cas out of the backseat. He swung Cas’ arm around his shoulder and half-carried him into the bunker. Dean got to work right away.
Dean turned towards Cas, who was lying on the ground next to him. His back was turned towards Dean and his face was curled into his chest. He held his arms across his stomach and shivered.
Dean turned back to Cas as he walked out of the room. “That’s my angel.”
Cas knew Dean wasn’t going to let him heal him of his own free will. Dean Winchester never asked for help, especially not from a broken angel. Cas, feeling much better and bolder, than he had a few days ago, jumped on top of Dean from behind, startling him enough to knock him to the ground.
Cas laughed. “And I promise I won’t desert you again. It was wrong for me to flee when you were in danger. I apologize.”
“You never want to celebrate, but Cas thought you deserved something special.” Sam said, cutting into the stack of pancakes in front of them. Dean picked up a fork and gazed at Cas, smiling at him in reverence. Though Cas and Dean had been together for longer than Castiel had been human, these new human feelings that arose when Dean looked at him like that made his heart flutter.
“I remember you,” Cas said, referring to going through the portal. Dean didn’t react, so he assumed that Dean wasn’t aware of his Humanity’s affect on Cas. His heart broke a little. “I recall… falling. Hard. And then there was a woman’s voice… and then the shower… and I remember falling asleep.” Cas tried to move while speaking, but Dean made a loose gesture, telling him to take it easy. “I remember feeling very weak,” he continued, out of breath, and it was clear to Dean that he still was.
Cas was still a bit shell-shocked from the embarrassment of showing Dean his wings for the first time, but he sensed such genuine awe and amazement from Dean that he forgot about it. He was quickly swept away in the feeling of Dean kissing him and touching,
Cas could feel Dean’s longing pulling at his metaphysical heartstrings. Every word was a tug at his will. He needed Dean as much as Dean needed him, but he couldn’t let mere want interfere with his judgement. That would be foolish. He needed to keep Dean safe. He knew the Monsters told Dean that he was still out there. But he needed Dean to believe it. Cas needed Dean to really believe, to know for certain that he still cared.
“So good, angel,” Dean sighed into Cas’ ear. It took Cas a moment to register his words. Dean continued sweeping his hands over Cas’ wings, testing the limits of what he could take. When he found a spot that Cas seemed to enjoy, he lingered there, relishing Cas’ response to his ministrations.
“No, no, Cas, come on! I don’t blame you. You weren’t in your right mind, and I know that.” Dean shook his head, hesitantly looking at the portal.. We don’t have time to argue, we have to go!”
Dean figured that this shouldn’t be news to him. Cas had been at full power and became severely damaged when entering. What would happen when he was weak upon exiting. “How long do you need to get juiced up?”
“Do you? Understand, I mean.”
“Page 81,” Cas said, taking up a position next to Dean.
“What?” Dean objected, laughing along with Cas.
Cas squeezed his eyes shut, searching for a more human language, and arched his back in response to a particularly deep thrust from Dean. “A-Ah! There! Please keep going!” Cas shouted desperately.
As Cas held a hand over one ear, Dean led him to a small outcropping in the trees to serve as temporary shelter. The two sat on the ground for a while in silence. Dean watched Cas as he listened, his eyes searching beneath his eyelids.
“Someone’s happy this morning,” Cas said, picking up a rare but not unwelcome vibe from Dean.
Then suddenly, he stopped.
“Please… they’re really sensit- that really hurts…” Cas said in a hushed voice. He was absolutely mortified. Usually, it felt good when Dean touched his back around that area, even if only in passing. That sensitivity was usually welcome. Pulling the feathers there was borderline torture. Each tug set his whole spine on fire.
Dean was afraid for Cas. He had run at the first sign of trouble, leaving Dean alone. He was angry, and bitter, and absolutely confounded. Sure, Dean could manage a few Leviathans, but what if Cas couldn’t?
Dean nodded instantaneously. “Yes. Every time.”
“He’s going to need stitches, at least for his chest,” Dean said. He could tell Cas was still breathing; Dean was certain he’d live. “What the fuck did he want with Crowley anyways?” Dean spat, seething.
“God, you’re burning up, sweetheart,” Dean said, only mildly concerned. Cas just whimpered in response.
Cas nodded. “Just sensitive,” he blurted. Dean couldn’t see his face, but he saw Cas’ jaw shut tight, embarrassed at his own forwardness.
, but he held his tongue in favor of Cas. “I’m going to figure it out. We’re going to figure it out,” Dean said firmly. “What do you want to do now?”
“Uh, whiskey. Top-shelf. Surprise me.” Dean said.
“Uh, yeah. They’re down that hallway I think.” Dean pointed to an outcropping near the front of the casino. “I’ll be here, angel.” Cas nodded, turning to walk towards the restroom.
“I don’t believe there are very many. Maybe four at the most?”
Dean smiled softly, his eyes closing. His smile twisted into a frown for a moment.
“Can you be more specific, Cas?”
“Bingo,” Dean whispered. He drew his angel blade and walked down the hallway. Sam drew his as well, and they listened through the doors as they snuck down the corridor. They seemed to be filled with groups of people, laughing, playing poker, drinking…
“I’d rather you hurt me than hurt yourself-”
“HE’S my cherry pie! Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise!” Dean always changed ‘she’s’ to ‘he’s’, just for Cas. Dean sang along just under obnoxiously, pointing at Cas on the pronouns. Cas loved every minute. He laughed at Dean’s stupid air guitar and practically wheezed when he used the salt shaker as a microphone.
Dean pulled the last stitch tight and cut the dental floss. “All done.” He smiled at Cas, who still had his eyes closed. Dean hated seeing him like this. “Would a shower make you feel better, angel?”
“We can do this the easy or the hard way, angel-face.” The demon cocked his head for a moment, sizing Cas up. “Maybe angel-face is the wrong term. How about…  hairless ape?” The demon smiled wickedly, picking up the angel blade and holding it over Cas. Cas breathed heavily, trying his hardest to remain calm and calculate his next move. The demon raised the blade and drove it down, stopping inches from Cas’ sternum. The demon leaned in close to Cas’ ear. Cas shut his eyes tight, breathing shakily, preparing for the worst.
“Water’s just fine for me thank y-”
“Go ahead, punk.”
“Ah! How much l-longer?” Cas bit out, gripping the pillow above his head. His hands scratched at the fabric as Dean worked him open.
“Are humans normally this excitable when they are forty?” Cas pondered aloud, a smile creeping into the corners of his mouth.
Dean shuffled his limbs from Cas’ and positioned himself between the angel’s legs. He knew Cas would be aching already (as was he from the scent of an omega,
For the moment, staring at the sleeping Cas wasn’t helping anyone, so Dean decided it was time to rest. He was going to savor his first sleep back topside. He rolled onto his back to stare at the blank motel ceiling and let his hand drift near to Cas, just to let him know he was there if he needed. He heard the soft rustling of bedsheets and felt Cas’ hand connect with his as he drifted off.
“Hey guys, Gabri- Oh, shit, I’m sorry!” Sam said, peeking through the door frame, trying not to stare. Cas froze, panicking so quickly that his wings returned to their original plane. Dean shot up with the force.
When the movie was over, Dean was ready to announce his plans.
At the end of the first street, Cas’ knees buckled and his breath heaved. He tried to walk of his own accord again, but Dean just picked him up, holding Cas tight to his chest, whispering soft words of encouragement.
“Almost one. You slept a long time,” Dean said, grabbing a cleaner pair of clothes out of his drawers for Cas. “I’ve got something to tell you. When you’re ready.”
Cas tried to get his head straight, but he could barely answer. “The exit…” he muttered, gesturing vaguely. It flickered more intensely than it had before. “We have to go now.”
make trembling headway through his lips, and Dean’s hand made its way back to Cas’ dick.
Dean removed his fingers from Cas, who reacted with a whine, and leaned upwards to kiss his angel. “I think I understand. I’m gonna try as best as I can.” Cas, a little calmer now, nodded silently. “You feel loose enough to me… is it alright if I fuck you now, angel?”
Cas made quick work of Dean’s shirt buttons, moving faster than Dean had ever seen him move. Dean worked on undoing his belt while Cas took off his own clothing. Dean had barely slid his jeans off of his thighs when Cas started pulling him down.
“You don’t get it,” Cas snapped at Dean. “You know how Gabriel is. And they still hurt a lot. I don’t want him to see me.”
__________
__________
This wave of emotion from Dean’s Humanity shook Cas to his very core, more so than it ever had in Purgatory. Every nerve that caused him pain since their return ignited, flaring up with Dean’s possessiveness. It knocked the wind out of him, and he tensed momentarily. Cas side-eyed Dean in curiosity to see if he noticed his Humanity’s effect, but once again, there was no response from Dean.
There was a certain part of him that wanted to make it through Purgatory with Dean, but he also knew that and angels and humans alone drew copious amounts of attention here. Purgatory’s most wanted travelling together sounded simultaneously like the best and worst idea.
He prayed.
“Hey, angel,” he whispered, smiling while his eyebrows knitted into a concerned expression. “You’ve been out for about a half an hour.”
Though Dean could barely stand himself, he offered a hand to Cas, who graciously took it. His knees shook as he stood. Dean hooked his other arm under Cas’.
“-Don’t worry, I’ll be back. And you can touch yourself while I’m gone, but don’t you dare cum. Okay?”
“Did you at least text him?”
She laughed. “I’ll have your waiter over in a moment.”
His love for Dean gave him the perseverance to stay in the same place. Love told him to wait patiently, to stay alive until Dean came looking for him. Love assured him that Dean would understand why he left. Love pledged that Dean would care for him despite his damaged wings. He just hoped Dean understood.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My hero,” Dean said with those sexy eyes that made Cas shiver.
“It’s a summer solstice that correlates with Pluto beginning a new orbit. This hasn’t happened in over 12,000 years.”
Purgatory seemed so wide to Dean. He could walk for hours and it wouldn’t seem like he had traveled a mile. Time was as thick as molasses, and it felt even slower. Eternity was an incomprehensible limbo.
“I’m not. Just… focus on feeling it.”
“Hey, hey, it’s okay,” Dean said, pulling Cas into an upright position. “We’re safe now, I’m gonna take care of you.”
Dean lost his bearings for a moment as Cas teleported them behind the Leviathans. “Run!” he shouted to Dean, and he obeyed.
As soon as he was able, Cas’ arms were around Dean, and they were locked in an embrace. Their lips met in a series of rough kisses as Cas’ fingers wove through Dean’s hair and Dean’s hands worked their way down Cas’ body.
“Y-Yeah?” Cas swallowed as Dean kissed his way down to his hips. The fabric of Dean’s shirt brushed over Cas’ already hard cock as he did so, and Cas rolled his hips impatiently into the contact.
“Yes. Wait,” Dean said, suddenly coming out of his elated stupor. “Are you okay to get through the exit? Are you healed enough?”
“Jesus Christ… CAS!” Dean yelled, racing out the door in the other direction.
“No, no, don’t worry about it. I know it’s really painful. I’m almost done, I’m so sorry, Cas. Almost done...” Dean smoothed his hand over where he pulled the feather out and Cas nearly sank through the dirt. “Ready?”
Dean leaned his head against the tree and stared up at the sky. There were no stars, only sun and moon to tell the passage of day and night. Staring into that indigo, Dean prayed, just as he had the night before.
“Well, that was… quick.” Sam said, almost surprised at his brother’s forwardness.
“I need you. Now. Please.” Cas was hardly ever this direct. Usually they fell straight into the rhythm of sex with silent initiation, or Dean proposed the idea.
“Cas?” Dean asked softly, not wanting to wake Cas if he was already sleeping. He snoozed peacefully and seemed to be free of any pain for the moment. Dean smiled at the sleeping angel and went straight to work.
“Come with me and no one here has to die.”
“I… I want you to fuck me open with your fingers, Dean…” Cas looked at Dean as he spoke, his cheeks turning red with embarrassment and anticipation. Dean would give him anything if he asked, but that was the catch- he had to ask.
__________
“If you’re scared, we can turn it off, love.” Dean said, running a hand through Cas’ hair.
“Mmhm,” Cas responded in a desperate whine. “Please, I need your… I need your fingers…”
The burger joint was crowded, but they got their food quickly. Dean attributed the speedy service to “birthday luck”, which confused Cas. Human birthdays didn’t have any sort of pull in the balance of the cosmos. They ate quietly for a little while, taking in the nostalgic scenery of the place.
The demon’s eyes turned black once again. “He owes me my soul!” He raised a fist, and punched Cas’ lights out once again.
Cas faced his final Leviathan, breathing heavy as he tried to muster the energy to kill it. He raised his arm, expecting Grace to flow through it, but he only felt a weak pulse. The last Leviathan wrestled Cas to the ground and opened it’s jaws. Cas landed wrong on his right wing, and he felt the muscles at the point of impact tense as the rugged terrain pulled out a group of feathers. He shrieked and attempted to reorient himself. Hearing his cry, Dean threw himself onto the Levithan, knocking it off of Cas to promptly cut off its head.
“Whoa, no reason to be so vile, Dean. Answer my question and I’ll let you all go scot-free.”
Dean chuckled. “Idiots. They think we can’t hand four of those fucking bastards?”
Once she left, they all thumbed through the menus. Cas was excited. In all his years, he had never been to a casino. He was glad Dean chose to share this moment with him and Sam.
After another short moment, Dean started dialing. Cas audibly sighed in relief and Dean glanced at him nervously. Cas heard the dial tone over the receiver as Dean anxiously tapped his finger against the bedside table.
“Dean?”
The moon rose above the trees and cast a faint silver glow across the water. This was Cas’ favorite time of night. It was the limbo between daylight’s last breath and the inhale of the moon upon its awakening. For a few minutes, there was peace across the land. Monsters grew lazy and Leviathans grew confused at the subtle drowsinesses of the day.
“Some Leviathans were chasing me. I couldn’t fight them, so I prayed. I mean, I’d prayed before that, but he never answered… not really, anyway… He was really hurt, really fuckin’ hurt, even back there. And he still pulled me out.”
“That’s better, Cas,” praised Dean, who graciously added another finger. By this time, Cas’ cock was absolutely aching, and he reached down to stroke himself as Dean fucked him with his fingers. Dean watched Cas for a few moments before grabbing his wrist with his free hand and placing it at his side. “Here, let me.”
Cas passed through the gates of Heaven and Earth, even Hell, with a door. There were entrances and exits to every place, and he always walked through them with certainty. Something was wrong with the door to Purgatory. He wasn’t supposed to be there, and neither were his wings. The most heavenly part of him was now the most hellish.

“I’m sorry, Cas… I can’t help thinking that this is all my fault,” Dean started to explain. Cas raised an eyebrow. “I tried my best to find you, but I wasn’t there for so long…”
Cas’ eyes screwed shut as he took Dean’s cock, finally feeling full and nearly satisfied. But the unfamiliar buzz in his body was still growing, and it showed no signs of stopping. The anxiety crept back into the forefront of his mind. Another wave in his scent gave him away, and Dean worked diligently to keep Cas satiated in any way he could pick up on.
“I can’t understand you, angel,” Dean said, panting as he continued his thrusts. He stayed attentive to Cas’ needs, making sure he wasn’t in pain or overheating. As it always seemed to be, this was a new situation for both of them.
“Cas, if you want to borrow my clothes you can just ask,” Dean chuckled. Cas didn’t laugh. “... Did I do something wrong?”
“Awesome,” Sam said.
Dean and Cas begin to readjust.
Dean was trapped between the Leviathans and the water. He couldn’t bolt around them to the left or right, and fighting through them on his own would be impossible. Dean didn’t know how good Leviathans were at swimming, but he would have to hope that they weren’t as fast as him.
Dean chuckled quietly, running a hand through Cas’ hair. “That’s ok. You rest up a little more and we’ll get you something to eat so you can get some strength back. You’ll need it.”
“Yes.” Cas said quietly.
“Shhh...” Dean hushed.
“Don’t worry…” Cas mumbled as Dean lifted his shirt over his head. Dean froze.
Dean felt his lungs collapse as he let the feeling overtake him. His skin tingled with the familiar warmth.
“That’s it, angel, keep going…” Dean whispered against Cas’ neck as he kissed the sensitive skin. He could feel Dean’s breath there, ragged and conscious, and hear the soft groans falling from his mouth. Dean was less sensitive than Cas and more experienced, but he was no match for the strength of Cas’ deep sensuality.
His eyes fluttered, squandered of all energy. Cas sighed out a soft, barely coherent word of thanks as he drifted into unconsciousness. Dean pulled out and held up Cas’ head in his hand. “Cas? Fuck, um, I’ll be right back.”
“Yeah, should be fine.” Sam said. Maybe little Sammy was a risk taker after all.
Perhaps the most concerning matter was his wings. The Monsters, Cas, and Dean were now all on the same plane of existence. This otherworldly place allowed everyone and everything to see his wings. Being sucked in to Purgatory damaged his wings so egregiously that he didn’t even want to be seen.
“Thank you so much!” Dean said, taking the key between two fingers. He smiled at the woman, who returned it nervously, once again retreating behind her desk. Dean immediately bolted to the room, trying to keep his footsteps as quiet as possible.
Around what would’ve been an earthly noon, Dean came across a lake. He stared across it and watched the sun flicker across the nearly still water. He glanced over his shoulder to assure he wasn’t being watched or followed, and he knelt beside the lake.
“We should still be careful.”
Dean flipped the manilla pages and began reading the section titled:
Dean pushed away the thoughts of Cas being in danger long enough to let the reality of the situation sink further into him. All that was on his mind was the exit. He would do anything to get Cas home safe.
“Hey, look, there,” Dean said, gesturing towards a Motel 8 sign in the distance. “Can’t be more than a few blocks.” Cas didn’t respond. Dean decided it was best to keep moving. He pushed his concerns to the back of his mind.
Though annoyed, Dean nodded solemnly, resigned to the facts. It was simple, really. Cas was hurt, and Dean wanted…
“-It’s okay. Don’t be sorry, baby. Come here,” Dean said, coaxing Cas to come a bit closer. He buried his face into Cas’ hair as Cas curled into Dean’s body.
First on the list, finding out where the hell they were. He rifled through the desk drawers until he found a travel guide in the dresser that the television sat on.
Cas could feel himself becoming dizzy, falling in open space, but he wasn’t afraid. He knew Dean had him. Comforting arms reached under his own, holding him up as he descended into the blackness.
“That’s more than okay. Thank you,” Cas responded. He took the towel off and started to put the clothes on. He had no problem being naked in front of Dean, but he turned away slightly when he saw Dean watching him with a smile. Cas threw on Dean’s old band t-shirt, faded with wear and age, and turned back around to a frowning Dean.
Cas couldn’t even form a response before the telltale signs of an orgasm started floating through him- but this time, he felt them everywhere. The prickle at the base of his spine shot up through every vertebrae, and the arousal usually reserved for his most sensitive areas was racing across every inch of skin he owned. He managed to let
“I’m not gonna lie… this is probably going to hurt a lot.” Dean poised the needle over Cas’ chest. “I’ll try to go as quick as I can.” Cas nodded vigorously, not wanting to think about it. Dean pierced his skin with the needle and Cas shivered. Dean worked as fast as he could. He got about a third of the way through his task when he felt tears start to drip onto his hands.
“Dean, Dean…”
“We made it…”
“Shhh, Cas, shhh. Save that energy.” Dean knew it was true; they were safe, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. “Can you stand?” Cas nodded, and Dean helped him up, but he could tell Cas’ knees were shaking. “Come on, baby, you’ve got this.”
“When we were apart, I could. Now I suppose I don’t need to because I can see you. I can understand better. At least I try to,” Cas explained. He let his tone go quiet. “I could feel how much you missed me. It… it made me cry. I didn’t know I could cry.”
More Leviathans emerged from the tree line, gathering around their injured comrade. They seethed with anger and bloodlust, and it looked to Dean like a great time to get out of there. He could take about four Leviathans on his own (after some practice and a couple close calls), but they just kept coming out of the trees until there were around ten.
“Trust me, please,” Cas said, leaning over a bit, pressing his forehead to Dean’s. He was clammy, surely a sign of some further illness, but Dean kissed him anyway. Suddenly, a flash of Cas’ Grace lit up his body, just as it had in Purgatory. It was so purely
Dean hadn’t noticed in their rush, and if he did, he didn’t mention it. Even the Monsters didn’t mention them. They were more than a vainly viewed blemish; they were a mark on his very existence. He was so repulsive that even the Monsters didn’t want to acknowledge how damaged he was. Before they attacked, they looked at the broken angel with pity, and Cas spat back at their condolences with a swift death. That would end their “sympathetic” glances.
“No, Dean. It’s not stupid,” Cas interuptted. “I already have the world.”
“Dean!” Cas shouted with a broken sob following soon after. “I’m s-so… so close!”
“What?” Dean shook his head. “No, Cas, I’m just worried.” He reached out to put a hand on Cas’ face but he flinched away. Dean’s heart shattered. “... Do they hurt a lot?”
“I’m not going anywhere. You gotta relax. Just let it go.” Dean was panting with the effort, the rhythm of his hand in time with his hips. “I promise it won’t hurt. It’ll be over soon, angel, I promise.”
“Sammy?” He said, rounding the corner into the map room where Sam was reading. Sam had his head propped against his hand, and he was scowling.
__________
“What?” Dean said, confused.
“Yeah, yeah, cool,” Dean said, his mind and eyes elsewhere. “Have you seen Cas anywhere? He went to the bathroom 20 minutes ago and he’s not back yet.”
my help. He did some Vulcan mind-meld shit with me to try and get me to understand-”
“How’d you find him?”
Dean’s Humanity got the best of him when he first arrived. He searched for Cas for a month, asking every monster where he was before he went in for the kill. There were no answers. He yelled until he drew in Monsters from every corner of Purgatory. There were no answers. He prayed every night, hoping that when he opened his eyes, Cas would be there.
escape his lips. Cas pulled his knees to his chest, suddenly feeling small and scrutinized.
“-Cum inside me,” Cas stated breathlessly, his eyes shut in concentration. “Please.” He seemed almost embarrassed.
“Nothing even wants to look at me. Even the Monsters think that I’m unseemly…” Cas shuddered and tried to meet Dean’s eyes. It was natural, but uncomfortable. “I… I can’t heal them. Something’s wrong with me. I believe it’s… it’s my Grace. It’s being taken away.”
“I gotcha, baby,” Dean said, rolling them over once again. Dean thrust as hard and as fast as he could into his angel, just attempting to satisfy his heat. Cas let out little punched out, exhausted noises of pleasure as he came for a final time, finally melting into the sheets.
“No thank you. Hey, did you see a restroom on the way in?” Cas said, his eyes floating around the room. They landed on their waiter from earlier, who was watching them from behind the bar. Cas thought it was strange that he wasn’t in the restaurant section of the casino anymore.
“Being away from you… it was hurting me,” Cas admitted. Dean’s Humanity marked Cas as much as Cas had marked him, ever since he pulled him out of the Pit. Somehow, Dean understood that. “I need you here.” Cas bit his lip and inhaled sharply to stop his tears. He leaned up from Dean’s chest and looked him straight in the eyes. “Will you help me, Dean?”
“It’s dangerous for you too,” Cas said, starting to walk past Dean. “Besides, I’ve got some of my energy back.”
“Dean!” Cas yelled, bringing his attention back. He reached out a hand and Dean took it without question.
Castiel was having a little difficulty choosing something to eat. His inexperienced taste buds had no clue what to get, and he had never eaten anything of this caliber before. He enlisted Dean’s help in picking a meal. “What should I get?” he said, leaning over to Dean.
Lost in thought, a knock surprised Cas.
“I wanted to cry. I guess you did it for me,” Dean said, reaching over to run a hand through Cas’ hair. “I know it’s a lot. Thank you.”
“Cas? Sammy?” said a voice from down the hall. Sam and Cas turned towards the doorway and waited, beaming.
Cas came more than Dean had ever seen him cum in one sitting. After his fourth orgasm, he was a complete disaster. His face was red, and he was intoxicated with pleasure. He was floating on air, rolling with whatever Dean gave him.
“You missed your birthday.” Cas said, frowning at his chicken-flavored ramen.
It had been minutes at most, but Cas felt the feeling would never end. Tears streamed from his eyes as his moans mixed with sobs. “Dean, please!” he shouted through the storm brewing around him, hoping his vague plea was enough for Dean to understand.
Eventually, the weight started to grow exponentially to the point where Dean could barely take it anymore. He could feel the ghost of wings on his back, and the sharp, stabbing pain that jabbed at every nerve. Through every moment, he could feel the draining sensation- the draining of Cas’ Grace. He felt powerless as that essence of life emptied. His own panic returned alongside Cas’ hurt. Dean held on to Cas, trying to push away from the kiss.
“-Cas, don’t. Get up. You’re gonna get sick if you stay in this cold water any longer,” Dean ordered, an unusual worry on the edge of his words. He pulled a towel from the basket next to him and opened it for Cas.
“Jesus, Sammy, don’t you know how to fucking knock?” Dean said, monotone enough for his words not to be wildly offensive. “What is it?”
“I won’t let you.” Cas said firmly.
After dinner, Dean hit up the blackjack table with Cas while Sam chatted up a woman with heels that were certainly higher than comfortable. Cas watched Dean play his first game intently, trying to figure out the strategy. After a few minutes of ‘hit’ and ‘stand’ and ‘split’, Dean added a hundred more dollars to his pocket.
“Ngh! Don’t stop, please!” Cas whined, pushing back, panting as he rode the aftershocks of his first orgasm. Dean complied, speeding up to what seemed to be a more suitable pace for Cas.
“Well, I’m in a great deal of pain… I arrived to Purgatory with my wings so severely damaged that my body couldn’t heal properly from the shock of being sent to a dimension I wasn’t supposed to exist in… I didn’t have enough time to completely heal before going through the exit, and it seems to have caused me more trauma than going through the first time.”
“Well, you don’t look good, and I’ve got the time.” Dean stood from his chair and shut his computer. He took a seat in the armchair past the bookshelves, expecting Cas to follow and sit beside him. Instead, Cas searched for a book, found it, and tossed it to Dean with an uncharacteristic urgency. “
“Me too.”
Cas pulled away for air and Dean took the moment to his advantage. He threw a leg over Cas and rolled on top of him, pinning his hips to the bed with his own.
“Dean, come here.” Sam beckoned Dean to a door on his left. “This one’s too quiet,” he whispered.
“I’m sure,” Cas said, nodding. “But… where do we go? Are we just going to wander around looking for a way out?”
“I think I’m ready,” Cas said, leaning up and forward. “Um, can I try being on top?”
“Looks like this one isn’t too deep. It’ll heal in a couple weeks.” Dean scrubbed gently at his angel’s face and watched him carefully to make sure he wasn’t hurting him. Cas was definitely in shock from his ordeal. He was in a decent amount of pain, and he looked so tightly wound that Dean wasn’t sure if he heard him.
Cas was an omega.
“How did you know?” Cas said, taking a bite with his bandage-clad arm. Dean just leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. Cas was about to apologize, but Dean interrupted his self-pity.
Cas nodded, and Dean darted forward into the clearing, his quiet footsteps leading a path for Cas to follow. They were about halfway through the clearing when Dean heard Cas calling out in protest.
“He said something about his soul… how could he not have heard Crowley was dead?” Sam said, still as shocked as Dean.
“I feel awful,” Cas lamented. He was staring at the buckle of Dean’s belt like he was going to tear Dean out of his jeans himself. Dean removed them quickly, and his boxers followed soon after.
Dean worried aloud, still rapidly texting Cas. “God, he could be drunk and throwing up in the bathroom! I shouldn’t have ordered anything for him. I should’ve stayed with him. I know he can’t handle alco-”
Cas nodded vigorously. “Yes, yes please.” He practically lunged at Dean, latching their mouths together in a rough kiss. Dean grasped his hips and climbed on top of Cas. He let the side of his hand trace from Cas’ jawline up to his forehead.
, trying once again to push back onto Dean’s hand. Dean pulled his fingers out with a devious smile and removed his hand from around Cas’ dick.
“Dean, stop!” Cas said as quietly as he could to get Dean’s attention. They both paused in the middle of the clearing. “I hear talking up ahead.”
“C’mon, Cas, please,” Dean said softly. “I won’t do anything you don’t want. I just… I need you to come with me.”
“It’s not as bad as you would think. Most Monsters have the same idea as us. They think it’s better to hunt during the daylight. Except werewolves, but we can handle those easily.”
“I’m glad. I’ll be okay. I just need some time to rest,” Cas said in the middle of a bite of ramen. “I never gave you your birthday present!” Cas shot up, handing his ramen to Dean.
“How about we go for a drive instead? We can get some food and then come back and watch a movie before dinner. I need a burger.” Dean was more excited than usual.
Dean ran some warm water in the shower for Cas and handed him a towel. “I’m gonna go find you some clothes and something to eat. Will you be okay on your own?” Dean asked, furrowing his brow. He didn’t want to leave Cas alone, but cared about making sure he felt safe and got everything he needed.
The bathroom was quiet, and Cas was slowly becoming more acquainted with it. Strangely, it was one of his new favorite places. The unspoken rule of solitude was comforting to him, and baths became a new and welcomed pleasure. Sam and Dean knew that Cas needed his time to relax and ease into his new life as a human, so it was not unusual for Cas to go undisturbed for a couple hours in the bathroom here and there.
“I’m not talking about your wings. I’m talking about you. And even if you’re hurt, I don’t care what you look like. You will always be beautiful to me.” Dean felt like he was on his deathbed, making his final confessions. Besides taking care of the people he loved, wordlessly, he didn’t do much of the touchy-feely stuff. “But really, are you holding up okay?”
“Okay, okay, I’ll just be gentle then,” Dean said. Cas whimpered, and it was apparent that he was in a deep enough stage of heat that he didn’t care how Dean gave it to him.
Cas knew Dean got his message when he started to feel joy again. His whole body felt Dean and his Humanity leap for him, and Cas enjoyed knowing that Dean was safe and wasn’t angry with him.
He could feel Dean laying him down next to him. Cas lazily melted into the crook of Dean’s arm.
“I know, baby… I’m so sorry. Just a little longer, okay?”
“Where are you going?”
“Oh, fuck…”
“Damn it, Cas, wake up,” he said, shaking Cas’ shoulders. “Come on, we gotta move.”
Dean said nothing.
“It’s really okay, Cas. I wasn’t expecting it either.” Dean blurted out. “Can I open the door?”
Dean snapped back to reality, his interest piqued. “Who?”
“Ooooh, the dumb one!” the man said, pushing hard with his forearm onto Cas’ chest. “Shouldn’t have gone out into the big scary world all alone like that!” It was their waiter from earlier.
Dean did the opposite of hurt him. To have Dean here, touching his wings, the most personal and powerful part of him, drove him absolutely wild. He felt a strange lust rise deep down inside, but he was mostly distracted by how calm he felt. He was safe. Dean would never hurt him, not on purpose.
“It’s late afternoon. We should travel overnight since we’ve been resting all day.” He held out a hand for Cas to take, which he accepted. “Have you ever travelled at night before?”
Cas furrowed his brow and shook his head. “It’s probably nothing.” He continued walking, and Dean followed. “I’ll stay sharp.”
“What hurts?”
“I think I’m gonna get some of that lemonade now,” he said, throwing his legs over the edge of the bed and standing, leaving Cas naked on the bed, his orgasm fading from his body.
“Cas, honey, will you look at me?” Dean asked softly, just loud enough for Cas to hear him. “I need to see you.”
“Shit…” Dean said, reaching in his suit pocket for a lock pick. He wiggled the tool around for a few seconds, and he wrenched the handle open when he heard it click. The door hit the wall as Dean stormed into the bathroom.
Dean stayed awake while Cas slept so he could listen for Sam’s arrival. He made use of his time by reading the dining guide he found in the dresser, glancing at Cas occasionally to occupy his mind.
Dean smirked. “What was that, angel?”
Silence.
“Thank you,” Cas mumbled, squeezing Dean’s hand.
“We won’t be wandering. I have a good idea of where the exit is based on what a few different Monsters told me. We can go through it since we don’t... belong here. I was going to find you and then head back topside.”
Cas quickly got to work. He brought his left wing to his lap and set it down tenderly. He searched for a bloodied feather, which wasn’t hard to find, and pinched two fingers around it, near the base. He closed his eyes and tugged, pulling the feather out at the root. Cas let out a small, defeated noise of pain. He inhaled sharply.
After a few minutes of chase, Cas saw a glowing blue light up ahead. His head snapped over to Dean and he leaned into his motion, adrenaline pumping through his veins. The light ahead flickered softly, and Cas heard Dean cheer in surprise.
“I’m going to go make us something to eat,” Cas said quietly, shifting out of Dean’s arms slowly, not wanting to disturb him in case he still wanted to rest. Dean followed him to the kitchen and snuck up behind Cas, who was looking through the fridge.
“I’m doing fine. My Grace seems to be recharging, but I still need a little more time,” Cas answered, eyes forward, scanning the forest. “If I can be of use, please let me know.” Dean only nodded in response.
“He was smart,” Cas smiled. “He came after us because we were the first thing he saw, but then he realized we’re stronger together.” Cas’ smile faded. He had been mistaken. “I think I was wrong before.”
Dean thought briefly about how to approach the subject. Cas was obviously upset and embarrassed, but Dean couldn’t imagine the amount of pain he was in. Dean couldn’t see them before, and Cas knew that. He was probably torn up that this was the baseline for Dean’s impression of them.
Dean listened to Sam in the phone as he looked into Cas’ eyes. Dean nodded. “Lincoln, Nebraska. We’re in Room 213 at a Motel 8. I think it’s about 7 miles from the Capitol. Please hurry.”
He cried for hours.
Dean chuckled a bit as he shook off Cas’ trenchcoat. He didn’t want to seem worried. The truth was, he had no idea what to do next. He didn’t even know exactly where they were. Should he call Sam? How was he going to help Cas when he didn’t even know what was wrong?
“T-Three?” Cas asked quietly in between soft moans. Dean stopped with two fingers completely inside Cas, millimeters away from his prostate.
Dean pulled out the last feather and Cas only made a short noise of protest. “All done,” he nearly whispered. He stood and walked around one of Cas’ wings to sit in front of him. “Doing okay?”
“Huh?” Dean said, letting out an exhausted breath.
“Wanna try, baby?” Dean said, gesturing to the table.
“It’ll be fine, Cas,” Dean reassured, swinging his weapon over his shoulder. “We can handle it.”
Dean huffed. Gabriel was a pain, but Cas needed the help. “Fine. Does that motherfucker even have a phone?”
“I’m right here. I still love you.”
For the first time, Dean hesitated to call Sam. The fact that he had just come back from the dead and he didn’t want to tell his brother was shocking even to him. Listening to the dial tone drone in his ear, he gazed at Cas, still fast asleep, and hung up the phone. For tonight, he just wanted to sleep and make sure Cas was alright.
Dean pocketed his phone and walked down the corridor. He knocked first. “Cas?”
“It knows we’re here to escape! We have to hurry!” Cas said hoarsely. Dean nodded, understanding quickly. He cast a concerned glance in Cas’ direction, momentarily concerned at his condition.
“In Heaven we called it the Sickness,” Cas added. “I’m very sorry, Dean-”
Dean- and quickly. “Cas? Are, uh... are you alright?” Dean stopped in the middle of his sentence, obviously struggling to get the words out. “You smell like- Please let me in, angel.” He already knew. There was no way out.
Cas wasn’t exactly sure how making lemonade in the kitchen turned into Dean all over him in the bedroom, but he was down either way. One moment, Dean’s hands were on his waist as he poured the last of the simple syrup into the pitcher, the next, Cas was naked and moaning into Dean’s mouth, grasping at his clothes for dear life.
“Absolutely. Thanks, Sammy,” Dean said, graciously taking the bag. “I’m gonna see if Cas wants any.”
“Do they hurt to move?” Dean asked tentatively. Cas nodded. “Then we should start getting you healed up right away,” Dean said, not knowing how to start. “Is there a way we can speed up your healing process?”
Dean opened the door slowly. He peeked his head out from behind the door, and Cas disappeared into his pile of blankets and pillows. Several of Dean’s shirts were interspersed within the pile.
was the moment he knew it was all over. Sam and Dean were both alphas, and the last thing he wanted to do was become more of a burden than necessary. He knew very little, but he knew that the discovery of his secondary gender would most likely cause more harm than good.
“I don’t understand.” Dean stopped touching, worried that he’d hurt or upset his angel.
“Dean,” Cas said, still hoarse, though trying his best.
None were foolish enough to attack Dean Winchester on his own terrain. He would set up camp with his few belongings and sit near a tree or cave. He strayed from the obvious places and let himself rest long enough to stay alert. He would let his mind go blank, readying himself for the next step in his journey to escape. Dean no longer feared this place, and he was on a quest to conquer it.
“He’s not answering his phone!”
Dean lined up with Cas’ entrance and Cas pushed back immediately, forcing Dean to bottom out in one stroke. He was tight, but so hot and wet that they barely noticed. “Oh shit, Cas…”
He raised his blade and the Leviathan held up his hands in front of his chest. “Hey, man, don’t take it personal. You’ve got a pretty respectful bounty on your head, I’m just here to collect,” the Leviathan grinned. He lunged again, but he was slow, and Dean nicked his side with the blade, just enough to momentarily incapacitate him.
He jumped to Cas’ level, turning on the Leviathans. “Just a little more. Come on, Cas,” Dean said. A Leviathan lunged up from the ground and Dean kicked it in the chest, knocking it back into another. Cas raised his blade two and began swinging anywhere he could. It was bloody and gruesome, but Cas didn’t care. They were so close. There were only five left.
Though Dean immediately felt better now that he was healed, he scowled at Cas, who was already standing up to continue their journey. He looked like he was thinking about whether to be angry or not. “You’re an idiot. Thank you.”
Dean said nothing, and instead looked around for any signs of danger. He gripped his Blade tighter in his hand. He silently moved closer to Cas, a promise of mutual protection. “What is it?” he mouthed.
“Oh,” Cas said, exhaling with a little shiver up his spine.
“Dean, we’ve seen this a million times.” Sam said, tossing the DVD case back to Dean with a slightly exasperated tone.
“I know, but Cas has never seen it!” Dean opened the case of Hatchet Man and loaded the DVD player. He hit play and joined Cas on the bunker’s couch. It was a strange time of day for a horror movie; it was only three in the afternoon. Nevertheless, the gore of the film had Cas curled up next to Dean’s sleeve.
“Dean, your soul. I can… I can see it again…”
“Please, I-I can’t, please… more...” he nearly sobbed out, gripping Dean’s shoulders with his last shred of fervor.
Dean knew Cas was feeling quite useless. Every Monster that came, Cas would stand at the ready, waiting to get a hit in, but Dean wanted him to heal. To smite and kill with just his hands, he needed his Grace, and he was still weak. He was doing better, but Dean was concerned about him being at his best when they needed to leave.
“Careful!” Cas nearly shrieked with an uncalculated twitch. Frenzied cries spilled from his lips as Dean moved his hands towards Cas’ scapular. “S-Sensitive there!”
“You alright, love?” Dean asked, shifting to a more comfortable position. Cas’ head lolled back as he fucked himself on Dean’s cock.
“Okay.”
“Dean.”
“Did you make contact with Sam?” Cas asked. Dean didn’t answer. “Dean-”
“You’re getting tighter, fuck, Cas,” Dean bit out, struggling to keep the pace of his hips steady. “It’s almost over, love. You’re gonna feel so much better when you cum.”
“You’re Dean Fucking Winchester.” Cas’ eyes flitted nervously to Dean’s for a moment, and then he laughed. “I’m just Castiel.”
“I know,” Sam said, understanding Castiel’s struggle. He stood next to Cas, watching the pancakes cook for a little longer while Cas reached for the whipped cream on the top shelf. He cursed in Enochian under his breath when he discovered he wasn’t tall enough to reach it. Castiel sunk back down, sulking over his pancakes once more.
Dean laughed too. “Nah, I don’t do strip clubs anymore.” He smiled at Cas. “Twenty one plus. Same kind of money, but with more clothes.”
“I’d like to return home,” Cas stated, as if it were that easy. “We would move faster if I could teleport, but my Grace has been depleting since we arrived. I can’t regenerate if my wings are damaged, and my wings can’t heal unless they’re cared for… I haven’t had the time to do a thorough examination of my condition. I have realized the obvious problems, however.”
“I-I can’t!” Cas shouted with vehement desperation, whispering something in broken Enochian between his phrases. “It’s too much!”
“Happy birthday!” Cas and Sam said in unison.
“Unhand me.” Cas commanded, clenching his teeth, trying to wriggle free. He was stronger than Cas expected for his size. He was as tall as Cas, but seemingly less muscular.
Another hour of preparation later, plates and napkins were set around the table for three, and a huge stack of pancakes with syrup, whipped cream, and strawberries was sitting in the middle of the table. Sam and Castiel were pleased with their creation. It had been Cas’ idea, but Sam’s knowledge of kitchen utensils and possession of more experienced human taste buds had saved the day.
It took him a week to cry. He felt Dean’s longing extending from his Humanity, reaching to Cas from the deep corners of his soul. Cas couldn’t hear him, but he felt his pain, physical and emotional, every hour of the day. He felt Dean wish for him to come back, to walk with him: to come home with him. He cried when Dean wouldn’t allow himself to.
Cas inhaled. “Can you take a look at them again? Just to see if there’s anything… disgusting about them?”
He tried to say Dean’s name, but it came out raspy and quiet. Cas managed to slide his arms back to push himself upwards, groaning in pain as he did so. Dean looked up at the noise and saw Cas behind him in the mirror.
It was Dean; Cas could smell him through the door. His heart jumped and everything inside of him wanted,
Dean continued for awhile, and he became surprisingly efficient around the eighth or ninth feather. He was very meticulous. He found and removed all the imbrued feathers he could get to on both wings, making his way inward towards Cas’ back.
Winchester promise.
He made quick work of all the feathers he could reach, and by the time he was done, Cas was a bit shaken, exhausted from the torment. There were still feathers that he couldn’t get to but needed to remove.
. Dean ran his hands up Cas’ sides, pausing to feel the rise and fall of the angel’s chest.
“Um, neutral news,” Dean said. Cas detected his true feelings. He didn’t like whatever option he had chosen, but he knew it was the only one. “Gabriel is going to come check you out and see if he can fix whatever’s up with you,” Dean said as gently as possible.
Cas stirred, adjusting to the light. Truthfully, he felt awful, but for now, he just mumbled sleepily. “What time is it?”
“Let him go, Dean, he doesn’t want trouble.” Cas said, trailing Dean. Dean stopped in his tracks and turned back to Cas.
“Damn straight, dirt bag. But it’s the truth.”
“Dean-” Cas mumbled, inhaling sharply. “I need- I need help-”
“It’s your birthday! It’s the one day a year you have to let me help you.” Cas said gleefully as he picked up their finished lunch.
He would give up every ounce of his Grace for Dean, and that was
“Hear what?” Dean said. Cas gestured in front of them, and Dean listened harder. “I don’t hear anything.”
“Holy shit…” Sam said when they entered The Gold Halo Casino. Dean had heard it was fancy, but damn, this was the life. There were sparkling chandeliers overhead and the walls were made of white marble with black velvet curtains draped over them. Everything looked as it had been tinged with gold.
“I’ll take that risk,” Cas said, looking at Dean, his gaze searing into his eyes. “You don’t deserve to be here.”
Cas had been listening to the Leviathans talk for about two hours now, and nothing they were saying was useful. Nevertheless, he kept his focus. Something in his very soul told him to keep listening. Under Dean’s attentive eyes keeping watch, he honed in on the group of Leviathans once again.
When Dean left the room, Cas stared at his chest in the mirror. The stitched-up cut was long and ugly. It wasn’t a clean stroke; it was jagged and deep. It was probably going to hurt for a long time, and scar for even longer. Cas felt an extremely human sense of shame.
The sight of Cas and the sleepy (yet desperate) movements of his hips did a number on Dean’s ability to control himself. “Fuck, Cas, I’m close-”
Dean walked up to the hostess. “Do you have a reservation, sir?” She said, as equally business-like as the waitress.
“No games, Winchester,” the shifter with the blade snarled. He let a smirk cross his face. “Maybe I could trade you for the angel!”
became incoherant was the moment Dean knew the Sickness had reach Cas’ core. He alternated between letting punched-out gasps leave his throat as he stared at Dean in half-lidded pleasure and rolling his head backwards, mouth agape, dripping lewd moans. Either way, he was a tempest.
I hope you enjoyed this one! Cas is on his way to feeling much better <3
“I’ve dealt with the same thing. Sometimes I don’t want you to see me when I’ve got a lot of bruises or when I’m hurt… I don’t want to make you worried or upset.” Dean pressed his mouth into a thin line. “Feeling better?” Dean asked. Cas nodded. He was grateful Dean felt the same way. To avoid a moment that was too sappy, Cas changed the subject.
“Sorry…” Cas said softly. Dean’s impatience melted away.
They burst through the tree line to reveal the portal, nestled between rocks on the side of a hill. The base of the slope was guarded by four more Leviathans, and they were headed straight towards them.
“Dean, are you crazy?” Sam whispered.
Cas looked up, startled at the compliment. Dean had never said that to him. Cas assumed from the way he looked at him that Dean thought he was attractive, but Dean never verbally confirmed his belief.
“I’m not certain, but I suppose it’s been about two hours,” Cas explained. “We should probably move. We’re both in danger. We can’t stay in one place for so long.”
“Where is Crowley?”
“Mhmm…” Cas closed his eyes and nodded wistfully.
“Dean?” he called, leaning out from behind the tree. “Can you come here, please?”
“Perfect…”
Dean shifted his eyes down.
“You guys!” Dean said, catching their infectious grins. “Thank you so much!” He walked towards them with arms open. The three embraced for a moment, and Dean kissed Cas on the cheek before pulling away.
“Oh my God.” said a dumbfounded Sam.
“Hold still.” Cas scooted down to Dean’s legs and held the wounded one down, letting his Grace flow through the cut.

He repeated Dean’s name over and over. It was his turn to pray. It was his turn to long. It was his turn to hope Dean understood what he meant, even if he couldn’t find the words for everything. For now, Dean just let him coil into his chest and cry, and he let himself worry for his angel.
Part of Cas wanted to pipe up and say ‘I’m sitting right here, Dean’, but he held his tongue. Dean was trying to do what was best, which means he would end up doing what he thought was right. Most of the time, this was a good system, but sometimes it failed terribly. It was on it’s way there. Cas reached out a cold hand to touch Dean’s forearm.
Dean swallowed. “What can I do?”
“Come and get me, you pricks!” Dean yelled, spreading his arms wide. “Free lunch, baby!”
“Cas?” Dean knocked on his bedroom door.
“Did you tell that to Cas too?” Dean said, angry. Sam reluctantly closed the door. Dean didn’t budge. “Put the knife down, freak.”
After lying on the ground for far too long, Dean rose and decided they should get a move on.
Dean turned on the Winchester charm. “Hunting accident. Me and my buddy were attacked by somethin’ and he went unconscious,” he explained calmly, incredibly practiced at lying through his teeth.
Cas awoke to a dark room, once again alone in bed. He tried to lift his head to look for Dean, but a sharp pain ran down his spine before he could bend any further. It wasn’t overly painful, but it surprised him enough to fully jolt him awake. The real pain was spread over his whole body, sore and weakening. He felt glued to the bed, barely able to move. He overheard the hum of running water from the ajar bathroom door, and Cas caught a glimpse of Dean splashing the water on his face.
“No!” Cas wanted to scream, but he forced himself to lower his voice. His whole body trembled as he laid still, wanting so badly to rid himself of this deeply human affliction. “Too much. N-Need more. I wanna… I want to finish so bad, Dean. Quickly. But make… make it slow.”
“Sam, come help me.” Dean tried to wake Cas up as Sam worked on the other restraints. “Hey, it’s me baby… Can you hear me? Shit, he’s not waking up.”
Dean felt this strange sense of fulfillment, staring across the water. He felt like Cas was close. He let himself sit by the lake for a while for a midday rest.
“Welcome to the Gold Halo! On the back side of your menus, you’ll find specialty drinks,” she said as they all flipped through their menus. “And tonight’s dessert is cherry pie, a la mode.”
A bed-headed Dean walked through the door, rubbing his sleepy eyes. He froze in the doorway, staring wide-eyed at his boyfriend and his brother.
Without his angel-ness, Cas felt small as he crossed the large entryway. A part of him wished he’d asked Dean to come with him, or at least wait for him outside. The bathroom was empty when Cas walked inside, but he didn’t feel alone. He swiveled to his right, towards the stalls, but was met with a figure that pushed him against the wall. He heard the lock on the door click.
“No,” came a small voice from the other side of the door.
A rustle from behind the trees caught their attention. Dean swiveled to face whatever he invited to wrestle with him. Three shapeshifters emerged from the tree line. One of them carried a weapon similar to Dean’s.
Cas hesitated, and then turned to Dean, agonizingly slow. Dean didn’t ask him how he was or if he was hurt; he already knew the answer to both questions. He didn’t have to tell Cas that he missed him. He didn’t know what to say.
Dean shook his head. “Not when I’m touching your wings.” Cas frowned. “But I can feel it when I kiss you. Or like when you answered my prayers.”
“I could’ve done it myself,” Cas replied, more disappointed in himself than annoyed with Sam. Ever since he went mortal, he’d had a burning desire to accomplish, to take pride in the things he’d done. He had a fresh start and he wasn’t going to waste it.
“Dean-” he pleaded.
“Can you tell him to come tomorrow afternoon? I think Cas might want a little time to himself, and I want to stay in.”
“Crowley’s dead.” Sam said, confused.
“Sure thing.” Another pause. “He’s lucky to have you.” Dean didn’t answer. He wouldn’t call it luck. The moment Cas touched him he was in danger; the least Dean could do was care for him.
“I love you too, angel.”
“That’s terrible! Is there anything I can do? Anyone I can call-”
Dean kissed his forehead. “Relax, Cas, I don’t want to hurt you,” Dean reached for the bottle of lube in the drawer. Cas shook his head.
__________
Cas threw his head back and groaned through his teeth, trying in vain to control the sensitivity. His chest heaved with shuddering breaths. A mix of human and Enochian curse words fell from his lips, each one feeling as foreign as the hum of arousal in his body. It travelled up his body, far enough to cloud his mind, and down far enough to make him dig his heels into the mattress for support. From somewhere far away, Dean’s words of comfort were piercing through the fog, but his scent, and the desperation on the edge of it, was driving Cas mad.
Purgatory was making him needy. He could hold his own against any Monster that he crossed paths with, but he longed to see Dean. He wanted Dean to hold him and tell him that everything would be okay.
“Is your heat too high?” Sam asked from the table as he finished his bowl of cereal. Castiel nodded, scraping off his second attempt at pancakes to start a third. He turned the heat down to medium.
Cas cried out, the sound abruptly cut off by a rough inhale. Dean ceased the motion of his fingers and brought a hand to Cas’ forearm, flexed from his hands fisting in the sheets. “Does it hurt?” he asked hurriedly.
“It’s my birthday. I don’t have to listen to monologuing.” Dean said as he focused his attention on Cas. He knelt by the chair and started to untie his legs. God, he looked awful.
“I’m not angry,” Dean whispered, matching Cas’ volume with strength. “You were just trying to help me understand.” Cas nodded. “You know I can take it, right? I’m Dean Fucking Winchester.”
Dean furrowed his brow, but played along with a small smile. “And?”
“What are you curious about, Dean?” Cas asked, and Dean scoffed. “You have a question. I can feel it. ”
Cas could hear Dean’s labored breathing on the other end, and he knew something would have to be really wrong for Dean Winchester to ask him for assistance.
Sam’s mouth curled into a smile. “Do you want help?”
“No…” Cas said weakly. Dean sat down at the end of the bed. Though he couldn’t see Cas, he reached out to touch his covered leg in support.
“Fuckin’ shifters. They’re stupid when they don’t go walking around in someone else’s skin,” Dean said, wiping the dirt from his forehead. He took a step and winced slightly at the pain.
“I-I’m not wearing any cologne… I apologize, this is all very strange…” Cas fidgeted. Part of him wanted to run for the hills, and the other part wanted Dean to stay forever.
“Jesus, Cas, you were that worked up?” Dean joked, slowing his pace.
“You can say they’re hideous,” Cas said, soft, yet firm.
Thanks for sticking around! Much love
Dean practically dragged Cas to the portal. Cas grunted in protest as he tried to escape Dean’s grasp. Dean let go of his arms and grabbed Cas’ hand instead.
“Please, Cas… come back. We can figure this out together. I wanna know why you left…. Please, baby.”
“You’re gonna be just fine, baby, just keep holding on to me when you let go.”  Dean squeezed Cas’ hand back with equal force. He sped up his thrusts in hopes of dissipating Cas’ suffering a bit quicker. “I gotcha, Cas. It’s gonna feel so good. You’re gonna feel so much better.”
“You’re my Castiel,” Dean whispered. Without thinking, he kissed Cas on the forehead. He heard Cas’ breath hitch nervously, but both of them stayed where they were. He let his hand come up to Cas’ cheek, resting it there for a moment, tracing his skin with his thumb. Dean drifted his hands to the bare skin along Cas’ arms where he violently pushed him away and pulled him into a loose embrace instead. “Mine…”
“It’s alright,” Dean said, with a smile in his voice as he stroked. Everything was quiet, and it seemed, even if just for a moment, they were alone. Though slightly damaged, the feathers were the softest things he’d ever felt in his life. Soft down protruded in short, wispy hairs at the base of the feathers. The longer fibers of the larger feathers were thick and velvety, and Dean smoothed them down with care.
Cas didn’t move. He had explicit instructions for his body, but he barely knew what to do with his mouth. “O-Okay, Dean.”
“Yes.”
Cas sniffled at the nickname. “It’s your Humanity. I can… I can feel it. It’s pulling at me, like we’re connected. I always knew we were, it’s just… here? Your Humanity is so… loud, and I can feel it all the time.” Cas broke into a sob. He found it so hard to articulate the raw emotion that he felt from Dean. Everything about this was painful; he didn’t want to worry Dean, but he knew that Dean needed to understand what he was feeling. “I can feel you all the time. I knew something was wrong and I didn’t want to hurt you by staying-”
Castiel felt utterly helpless. He was drowning in his own self doubt and unabashed pity.
When the pie came out, Dean barely even savored it. He finished it faster than both Cas and Sam. Cas decided cherry pie would be the next thing he learned how to make.
__________
Cas nodded weakly. “De... Dean…” he tried to say.
“I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s wrong,” Dean replied, as stubborn as ever. Cas said nothing. Not even a peep. “Damn it, Cas, I’m coming in.”
“You want the rest of my fries?” he said. Cas shook his head. “Suit yourself.”
“Are you gentlemen ready to order?” There was something too mechanical in the way he spoke that bothered Cas. He couldn’t put his finger on it. They ordered their food and sat back to enjoy the rest of the night.
“That sounds good. Thank you, Dean.”
He resolved to stay where he was, and if Dean wanted to find him, then that was his decision. Cas didn’t know if he would flee or welcome Dean’s presence. He was so embarrassed by his physical condition, but he was starting to accept the fact that he needed help.
“Hey, hey, it’s alright, baby,” Dean said softly, but quickly. “We’re almost home. I’m gonna help you, okay?”
“... No. It was just… tired. Your soul just kind of… clung onto me.” Cas smiled. “You didn’t let go until I had to put you back into your body.”
“It has a lock, I don’t want to jiggle it. Surprise attack?” Dean whispered back. Sam nodded and got out of the way. Dean backed up, raising his leg and kicking the door near the handle. The door swung open to reveal a very bloody, unconscious Cas and a black eyed demon. The waiter? He looked surprised at the entrance of the Winchesters, but swiftly raised his angel blade to Cas’ neck.
Cas closed his eyes, squinting as he concentrated. Dean couldn’t hear any voices at all, but Cas’ enhanced hearing must’ve picked them up. “I think they’re Leviathans,” he answered, returning to his intense concentration. “They’re talking about… guarding something. I can’t figure out what yet.”
Dean and Cas skidded to a stop as the other group of Leviathans approached. They were flanked on both sides; there was no choice but to fight their way out of this.
Dean held the blade in front of his chest, pointing it at the Leviathan. “You already know my question. Answer it and I’ll think about letting you live.”
He blinked the water droplets out of his eyes and looked up at the moon. Every time he looked at the moon, he thought of Cas. He remembered Cas telling him how much he loved the moon, how it was a perfect creation of God.
“It’s damn near dead. Sam gets the front.” Cas faked pouted and Dean was grateful his boyfriend was okay with the backseat. Sam never complained about winning his front seat privileges.
“Better,” Cas mumbled, shifting on the bed. Dean sensed his anxiety and moved in closer, kissing Cas’ jawbone and neck until he loosened up. Tentatively, Dean placed a hand on Cas’ wing, and it fluttered in surprise. Cas didn’t expect the touch, but it wasn’t unwelcome. “Much better,” he whispered breathily. Dean laughed against his skin.
“I’ve got some clothes in the other room for you, baby,” Dean whispered into the shell of Cas’ ear. Cas hummed slightly and nestled even further into Dean’s embrace. He wanted to make up for what had just transpired. “C’mon, sweetheart, we’ve gotta get ready for Sam to get here.”
“Hm?”
Dean and Cas make their way through Purgatory.
“He ran. Said my Humanity and his Grace together drew too much attention…”
Cas’ legs were starting to tense with the physical exertion. Just a little more, he told himself, trying to match pace with Dean. The spying and the teleportation had worn on his body, and he wasn’t sure if he was going to make it through the exit alive.
“No, no, Cas, it’s ok,” Dean hushed, standing to meet Cas as an equal. “So… do I get you toys, find another angel?
Dean opted for a more aggressive push, leaving Cas to shed his towel and crawl into Dean’s covers for what short-lived privacy he could obtain. As Cas curled in on himself, Dean rushed about the room, digging out snacks from his bedside drawers and soft shirts from his dresser. He shed his clothes and tossed them into the hamper- he wouldn’t be needing them for as long as Cas needed him. He was muttering to himself- an uncommon habit for him, one that only crept to the forefront in his panicked states- something about time and preparedness…
There was no answer.
Dean’s shoulders heaved in a mix of breath-chasing anxiety and relief, grateful that Cas was not afraid of him. “Jesus, angel, you smell so good.” He practically leapt onto the bed and wasted no time pulling the covers off of Cas.
“Oh, hey. This is Marie. She’s staying at a hotel near here and get this- she actually does know J-Lo.” Sam said. Marie Who Knew J-Lo smiled and waved at Dean.
“For Dean Watson.” He said with a smile. Castiel Watson, Cas thought, had a nice ring to it. The hostess guided them to a table. She sat them down and handed them menus.
Sorry I haven't updated in awhile! I haven't been super motivated to write, but I reread the first few chapters and decided to keep going. Hope you're well!
As he filled the glasses on the table, he asked, “Is there anything else I can get for you to drink?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean started, looking intensely at him as they walked. “When we get home, I’ll do anything for you. I want to give you the fucking world.” Dean inhaled sharply, trying to find the words. “I don’t want to hide anymore. I love you…” He paused. “I know it sounds stupid-”
