"Si beau! Si beau!" (So handsome!!) She cried, pulling Sherlock by the hand and giggling. He returned a small smile as John came, cases tucked under his arms.
"Dr. Watson, do sit down." The four of them sat awkwardly, and Sherlock looked up to his older brother with a face that was a mixture of humiliation and contempt. He was feeling more and more like an auctioned statue, or painting, every pair of eyes in the room watched him intently, appraisingly.
“M-ast-ter, p-please,” His threw his head back, his whole body shuddering.
"I know," Greg whispered, rubbing soft hands down his lover's biceps, pressing his lips to his husband's forehead, breathing in just a drop of his gorgeous scent. Like icy steel and peppermint. "We make sacrifices, we fight, we win."
Sherlock shuddered and wrapped his duvet around himself tighter, feeling so small and so alone. He was brave. He'd find a way. He'd block it out, he'd get into his mind palace and let John have whatever he wanted, wait until he was finished to come back out. Or he could kill himself before he had the chance.
"But he said, he said if I didn't want to marry him-" Sherlock sniffled, lying on beneath his raging Alpha brother, whose pheromones were strong enough to knock him to the floor.
"No. God,
Mycroft rubbed his temples as he hunched over in his study. Hitler was chancellor of Germany, and his rhetoric was getting more and more extreme- the people lapped it up. Mycroft did not care for him. His colleagues at the foreign office said that socialism was nothing to worry about- Germany had learnt her lesson in the Great War. Mycroft wasn't so sure.
"Hi," John grinned, hand resting gently atop his omega's stomach, the darkness around them fading into oblivion.
"I love you, I can't help it, you brilliant madman, that's why you've got to let go of me, wait for a patrol boat and be safe, love, let go and save yourself, your life is still ahead of you,"
"He'll be alright."
you all have been so kind to me and this story, ilysm
"He's not a
"No, sir, I've been good!" Sherlock whimpered as daddy rubbed his hands along his harness, tugging at the straps a bit, rubbing at the skin beneath them. His hands floated to Sherlock's collar, grabbing the back with his finger, tugging on the soft leather and leaving Sherlock sputtering, breathless. His cheeks flushed red, his eyes wide and innocent as he applied extra pressure with his other hand, fingers gripping firmly, but gently, into his neck. Sherlock choked a bit as he whispered, "I can show you sir, I've been good!" John smirked and squeezed at Sherlock's bum, leaning forward and nibbling at his glowing red ear.
"Sorry?" John smiled sadly and looked down at Sherlock's pale cheeks, which sported a sweet sprinkling of freckles.
"Let's see what we have here...Mary...Poppins by P.L. Travers." Mycroft enjoyed the illustration of an umbrella on the front page and cleared his throat as Emmy sat on his knee, leaning up to his chest and staring down at the page. He cleared his throat and began to read, "If you want to find Cherry Tree Lane, all you have to do is ask the Policeman at the crossroads..."
His heart had never felt so full, and he smiled, squeezing her hand in return.
"He's older, he's rich, he's kind. He's perfect for anyone else. But I never even wanted it, I don't know if I want it now," His fingers grazed his pinkish scar, "I just wanted away from my brother, I was so naive, I didn't realize, it's forever. And it's not forever for him! He, he can bite as many whores as he wants, and I'll always be his little creature, his possession,"
"But who says we-" Greg sputtered, and Sherlock gave him a look, and Greg only laughed before clapping his hand on Sherlock's shoulder before looking dreamily down at Emilia.
"Sherlock. Listen to me," Greg's voice took on an aggressive, dominating tone, he could use his alpha half when he needed to. "He wants to get to know you. He really doesn't have to, you know. My could sign the papers and you'd be in his bed tomorrow."
“I’m getting a drink.” He turned and left and Ross furrowed his eyebrows. Well, that was a bit rude.
"If you weren't what?" Sherlock jumped and looked to the lab tech. "Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't have been listening, it's just, sometimes I talk to them too and I...no, no, not that I talk to dead people! I mean, not like that! I just... I..."
"If he dies, you will be significantly physically at risk as his bond mate- but you will be safe with us." Sherlock bit his lip, the snappy remark he wanted to make dying somewhere in his chest at the sight of his brother- desperately trying to tell Sherlock something, but not saying it. "I know you very well despise me, Sherlock, I've accepted that, and I'm sorry."
“You can come, Sherlock, come for me, love,” It didn’t take much before Sherlock vision flashed white behind the blindfold, his chest seizing, his limbs frozen and his whole body convulsing as his orgasm ripped through him. He fell forward, barely in time for John to catch his shoulders and steady him, pulling him back onto his knees, reaching behind him to expertly pull the knots open. Sherlock had red marks where he had struggled against his bonds, and he crumpled into John’s arms once free, grasping for him, hair drenched in sweat, eyes pressed closed as John undid his blindfold. “You did so good, Sherlock, such a good boy, such a sweet little puppy, that’s it love, deep breaths, I’m right here,” Sherlock breathed in deep, obediently, eyes still shut tight. John pet his nape firmly until Sherlock was settled enough to look up, eyes calm and shimmering blue.
also, PSA, don't try and write when you're sad or angry, because everything gets way too angsty way too fast
not. a. sound." Sherlock bit his lip and John stood over him, folding his belt in two. "You need to learn your lesson, Sherlock. High time you knew who is the Master and who is the puppy- who begs me for my cock and eats from my hand, hm?" Sherlock did not answer, heeding his admonishment and tucking his forehead down against the cool wood of the coffee table, gripping tight, expectant for the impending blow. John only rubbed a callused, warm hand across his lower back, whispering low and thunderous, "I think it's time we were clear who humiliates whom." Sherlock shuddered, barely suppressing a whimper.

"Oh, god,

"Yes,
“Um, Stephen, it’s me?”
"It's up to you, darling," John acquiesced, sighing and rubbing his eyes. Sherlock grinned and nuzzled his Alphas' cheek tenderly.
“Oh no, of course not.” Sherlock sighed in relief before squishing his face into the pillow. “Sleep well, Sherlock,” He kissed his baby’s forehead and brushed away his sweaty curls.
"Dr. Watson, can you come take a look here, there's an omega in shock, I'm afraid he might pass out,"
"But I'm-" the word evaded his lips, and he itched at his neck.
"You wouldn't, Sherlock, even if, something should happen, you'd stay here, with Mrs. H,"
"You'd make a great detective, you know?" Sherlock raised his eyebrows and let out another puff. "You're clever as all hell- you know everything about people just from looking at them."
"You seemed a bit sick after last time," John smiled, stormy blue eyes glowing with something that sent shivers down Sherlock's spine.
"If-" Sherlock started, but bit his tongue, swallowing the syllables and looking over at Greg, "If he's not...would you, help me?"
"it's a shame you're all the way up there," He smirked, arms to either side of Sherlock's knees, gripping the dock edge. "The water's amazing," Sherlock cheeks flared, his heart racing, suddenly quite bashful. His pale skin shone ivory in the sun, a healthy amount of freckles already beginning to bloom across his shoulders. John put his hands on the tops of Sherlock's thighs, tan skin contrasting so vividly as his thumb caressed a small spot at the hem of his shorts.
"I'm John," The alpha smiled and squeezed Sherlock's waist a bit. Sherlock shuddered, his heart seizing.
"I've been reassigned, Sherlock, it's not a big deal. Happens all the time," John paused, swallowing thickly.
"Hm?"
"But I'm not a woman," He said obviously, feeling the need to distinguish himself.
"Present, Sherlock," Miss Adler instructed, standing in her red-bottomed heels, looming over the petite omega boy. Sherlock bared his teeth and shook his head.
He didn't blame them.

"I don't, understand, you're not upset." Sherlock knit his brows and approached him closer.
"Oh, I- uh, thanks,"

“I see.” They stood awkwardly for a moment. Ross broke the silence, ”I feel like I know you.”
"Sherlock? Sherlock are you in there?" Mycroft! Dear God no. No no no no.
"Am I especially lucky?"
John positioned himself and slowly worked the bulbous tip in, Sherlock wriggling on his knees, elbows buckling, attempting to push back into it more. "Ah-Ah, I decide, darling, you just sit back and think of England," All at once, Sherlock giggled, more than a bit delirious at the relief of John inside of him. John furrowed his eyebrows and smiled, leaning in to Sherlock's ear, his own cheeks flushed, "you can't giggle while we're fucking, it's not decent,"

"Mummy?" He cried, tiny voice, small shiny shoes clacking on the marble floors of the north corridor, "Mycroft?" His cries grew in desperation as he searched the house, sweat dripping down his back and drenching his shirt. He peeled off his tweed blazer, dragging it by the sleeve as he ran. "Mykie! Mummy! Please, somebody!" He found one of the downstairs maids, whose nose twitched as he frantically approached.
"Hmf, what is it?"
He pushed himself up and steadied, in his mind's eye remembering John's solider posture, squaring his shoulders and setting his jaw, feeling like a little boy again, with bloody scissors in the bottom of the bath.
in Sherlock's long-term room that is nicer than the furniture that they have at home, and he decides to be grateful that if he's going to kip in hospital, at least he's going to do it in a room meant for royalty.
After another few moments of waiting in useless silence, John found himself with no choice but to just turn back down the stairs without another word.
He doesn't want to be here, because he wants to be out there, instead.
Maybe his reluctance about this case was a little more severe than he'd first thought.
however, love someone else.
But Sherlock clearly does not want to do this later.
He flexed his hands, his heart thudding in his chest, and forced himself to stay calm.
John stiffened, a new light in his eyes. He was increasingly irritated by the second and if Sherlock kept pushing, oh,
you sodding arsehole, that's any college student-"
"There is nothing remotely normal about what is going on h--"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and set about continuing to ignore every word that he said.
That night, Sherlock finds himself draped over the sofa like a blanket, his feet in John's lap. They're not like this every night, sometimes they both need space, but John has seemed to want very much to be close to him ever since the full explanation of what happened ten months ago, and Sherlock has no issue providing. He lets John have a hand on his knee or absently stroke his calf or use it to muscle him into eating an extra biscuit, and
Greg was really starting to get worried.
As you can see, this really is the ending chapter. What's up next is a very small ending bow of an epilogue, just a bit of resolution and fluff as a thank you for making it this far :)
Sherlock suddenly gestures something. Or he tries to, through one arm being held to his chest and both his hands stiff and constrained, and the signs are slow and hesitant even if the lack of confidence does not show on his face. His mouth is moving through the words, but whatever they are, they are kept completely silent.
He was in love with Sherlock and didn't even know how to start a bloody conversation with him.
He held his breath until the angry, pressing heat inside his skull receded, and then he pressed his face back to Rosie's hair.
"Why do you say that? No, Holmes, we can not just
Why the hell would anybody ever
"That remains to be seen," he sniffed, huddling down even smaller. Perhaps if he looked small and pitiful enough, John would have sympathy after all. "It's
Another piece of what John had said finally registered, slowly sinking in through the fog around his head. "If the

There are several benefits, to not being able to speak.
"It's eleven at night, and Mrs. Hudson is in her seventies."
Next up is The Great Game!
The floor drops out from underneath his feet.
"Yeah?" John snaps. He's so angry he can barely see straight. This is not happening. Mycroft
Sherlock lets the silence drag on still, turning his gaze over and over John's form. He looks into the part of his hair, and the soft, red vest, and the loose button at his throat, and the calm, careful way that he sits. How he is ready to spring to life at any moment, with his strong, sure, skilled hands, his lovely, stormy eyes, the way he is at all times a tightly restrained bundle of action and nerves of steel and excitement.

Sherlock presses his ear to his chest, sinking deeper fury and despair and the unfairness of it all, the horrible, disgusting
He moved on.
"Jesus Christ, what happened?
Sherlock rolls onto his back and flings his arm over his head, glaring at the ceiling. Sickness still churns in his stomach and throat, but the despair has flagged, and with it the blinding rage that vibrates in his bones and fills him with the need to scream. It's all gone, and in it's place, he just feels... empty. Nothing.
"You won't." He started to draw back further, already withdrawing into himself, his shoulders lifting and his jaw tight but there was just the faintest quiver in his voice that betrayed everything underneath it. "You're not remotely like Oscar, or Mary, or-- whatever it is that you think you'd do, John,

He told the truth. Why was it his problem, if
He scratches Bosco around the ears again, tucking his face against the infectious, comforting heat of his head. Sherlock breathes in, first just one time, then in starts, his tongue suddenly swollen and his throat full. He tries again and nothing comes out. It
He can't stand knowing that Sherlock Holmes is trembling behind him, enraged and shaking and
It's a complicated case. Even without Sherlock being unable to vocalise it, he's seen the frustration on his face mounting as he pieced through files at the Yard-- he's as happy as he is stuck, and this is sure to be a case that'll keep him busy for the week to come.
"Shut up. You're me." He closes his eyes through a shudder, reveling in the sensation of John's fingers in his hair, his arms around his shoulders. "I still can't speak."
Sherlock still said nothing.
his eyes seem to be saying,
He stands in the sitting room, his eyes squeezed shut and sniffling quietly into his hands, stamping down the wave of emotion until it is thoroughly corralled. His rubs his eyes with one sleeve, cradling the precious paper in the other hand.
That hadn't been an offer of just drinks between old colleagues, had it?
"Sherlock..." John looked back up at him, finally pulled away from his phone by the sting of concern. Whatever excitement and energy there had been in him before had completely evaporated, and he sat in his seat now absolutely still, his jaw clenched and little finger back tapping in his lap. He looked twice as uncomfortable as he'd ever been back in the flat. "Sherlock, what's the matter? You've never said you don't go to Cambridge before."
John ate a quiet, early lunch with Mrs. Hudson and Rosie, texted Ella to cancel his afternoon appointment, and kept on waiting.

he sighed, giving in. Clearly, the cards here were already laid. Sherlock let out a little whoop, clapping his hands and squirming on his feet, and the sight was so ecstatic that even John felt just a little bit lighter. He could never say no to that face. "As long as it's just looking at the scene and talking to witnesses, okay? No running off, or I

wants John there on a case. What he doesn't want John there for is to play witness to him searching out all the dogs in the park. Sometimes one will bound over to him, licking his legs and shedding all over his coat. His dry cleaning bill doubles, and he finds air. "There's a good boy," he says, or "Good girl," or "Your owner's a bastard that's cheating on his wife." Perhaps they really should get a dog.
So Sherlock sits here, pathetic and his brain rotting inside his skull and
John grins breathlessly back, the hold in his hair releasing. "Making sure." He lets his head thump back and still strokes his hair, the skin warming underneath Sherlock's hands. "Good, because--
The problem is, it's the
"Hmm. Something like that." He smiled very carefully, very slightly, and gave a gentle tap to her phone. He hoped neither could smell the alcohol on him. "Do you recognise my date as well? Highly respected Cambridge professor, Nobel prize winner, happily married for fifteen years?" He waited for the pieces to click to wink. "Just keep your eyes on me, please."
He sits there on the floor of the morgue in John's arms, cries like a fucking baby, and gasps soundlessly into John's neck. Scaring the hell out of them all and permanently, utterly ruining anything that had ever been left of his own pride. John continues to speak to him, his voice tense and strained, but very little of the words themselves make it through to the bottom of the palace. Gentle praises, warm encouragements to keep breathing, that he's doing well, that he's safe, that John will keep him safe. Only the worry underneath them fully permeates, and the warm of John's fingers as they wipe against his face.
John's words stumbled to a dead halt.

But John's reaction would be even more unfortunate, if Sherlock kept this from him and waited for him to find out on his own.

"I should've punched him more."
Ella waited for him again. She watched hm only in calm, neutral sympathy, no expectations, no demands, just letting the words to settle. But they fell on deaf ears. It felt like John had just walked into a brick wall and was now just standing there, repeatably ramming his face against it.
God, he hated feeling stupid.

"I adore you, Sherlock, but maybe try not to sound so excited."
“I don’t think you are sorry, Sherlock.” John tsked, “and you were doing so good, boy, I thought we had made progress,” John sighed, the disappointment in his voice slicing through Sherlock’s heart like a razor. He had let his Master down. Again. He was horrible. “Get up, boy, we’re going home. You’ve embarrassed me, you’re lucky I don’t teach you a lesson right here, right now in front of everyone” Sherlock whimpered, eyes dripping with silent tears as he stood, eyes down. John pulled open the door for him and watched crossly as his sub exited, head down, wiping his nose with his sleeve. Out in the hall, Lestrade’s mouth hung open and looked at John incredulously.
As if he had a choice.
"I could never see you as anything less than my perfect boy," He lulled into Sherlock's ear, "my sweet, kind, brilliant, sensitive boy, who is so good for me, so awfully good." Sherlock hiccuped as he rest on daddy's shoulder, eyes closed, soaking up his praises that glowed like sunshine on his skin.
“Okay, are we ready ‘Lock?” John called from the light switch, hovering, his little boy covering their scrawny tree with ornaments, a few of them homemade from tongue depressors and crayons. Sherlock turned and gave him a thumbs up, nibbling his lip excitedly. He switched his weight from one foot to the other, standing nervously in his pyjamas. “Alright, 3...2...1…” John flicked the switch and their little Christmas shrub lit up, along with the strands of lights across the fireplace and the wall. Sherlock gasped, his brilliant blue eyes glowing in the warm lights. John chuckled and scooped him up, setting him on his hip and kissing his cheek. “What’ya think, kitten?”
"It'll be fun, I promise," Sherlock only nodded shyly as John pulled him up, leading him by the hand downstairs, giving Sherlock the basket "Bye, Marie!" He called as they pushed open the front door.
"That's good, Sherlock, but you really don't need to be sorry. I let myself fall to baser instincts, and that was wrong of me."
"Alan-"
29 May 1939
"What was that Sherlock?" John whispered.
The Alpha thundered a growl at that, his cock rather pleased by the notion- oh christ, imagining Sherlock's tummy round and full, so full he could barely move, stuffed with tiny little him-and-Sherlock's, but shook his head.
omega, and he would not be that. Never. The card fell from his fingers back into the box, and he stood, knees weak, falling forward, grasping a post of his bed to stay vertical in a haze of dizzying pheromones. Tears blurred in his eyes- the rushes of chemical emotion leaving him a trembling mess.
“Yes, I’m sorry, I’m just really nervous. He’s taking me out tonight, I don’t want to disappoint him.” Grace cocked an eyebrow.
"Gregory! I need you to listen to me. Now." Mycroft growled, and the beta shifted on his hips.
"It's only mummy needs an extra chair at dinner- we're trying to find someone suitable for Sherlock, and I could use reinforcments," Greg smiled and looked around before whispering into the mouthpiece of the phone.
The maid left briskly, the door slamming shut behind her, the dead bolt snapping shut. Sherlock realized there wasn't a handle on this side, and he rolled off the bed, collapsing onto the floor in a heap before crawling to the door. He searched for a handle, or something to open it. Nothing. Fear was thumping through his veins as he sat against the cool metal, sweat still pouring off his locks and onto his shirt collar. His eyes flickered over the windows. There weren't any, he realized.
"How'd you get the mud so thick?" She cried, scrubbing intensely, the brown dirt chipping off of and revealing the chocolately black below.
a voice whispered in the back of his mind. He coked his head and retrieved the card again. No, that wasn’t the address. What the hell was that?

look. Sherlock grit his teeth and rolled his eyes.
"No, Mycroft phoned me, the interfering bastard," John paused, looking up at the bleak military hospital, grasping his walking cane tight in his hand.
"I know, love, but you're not ready for me yet," He helped Sherlock out of his swimming costume, the sheets already sporting a wet spot beneath Sherlock. John sat back on his knees and pulled off his own shirt, Sherlock's pupils flared with lust, his pains growing stronger and sharper.
Sherlock didn't say anything.
, I'm going to be married tomorrow," Sherlock pulled on his dressing gown, quite aware he was only in his pyjamas, heart racing a mile a minute.
"Be like what? Honest? I'm hardly good looking, let alone obedient, Lestrade. I'm a disappointment that Mycroft's antsy to be rid of. Good luck to him. I'm running away soon anyways." Lestrade watched as Sherlock stood and shook out his jacket, rubbing a spot on the ground with the tip of his rubber boot.

"I will not ask again, Sherlock." Mycroft said calmly, that bastard. As if he was frightening in the slightest. Sherlock's tummy was disagreeing with him, his alpha had given him orders, and every second under his harsh gaze was torture. Damn his fucking instincts- damn his whole body. Sherlock stood begrudgingly, his amygdala rewarding his obedience with a second rush of endorphins. That was the tricky thing about the opium and the alcohol and the pretty white pills he swiped from the chemist- lowered inhibitions meant less protection from baser, submissive tendencies that were loathsome.
"You- hypocrite! Liar! there
"Sometimes it's the people no one can imagine anything of, that do the things no one can imagine,"
"A scientist?" John raised an eyebrow, the hair on his skin standing  rod-straight, his arms tightening around the trembling omega in protectiveness. His instincts made him glance to the door, the windows, the need to keep Sherlock safe running thicker through his veins at the scent of a flowering heat.
"Doctor Watson!" Came the shout from the other side of the room as a solider was carried in, losing blood by the minute. John ran his fingers through his hair and stepped over a dozen gurneys to reach his destination.
John growled his affirmation and pushed to the hilt. Sherlock writhed as he found his prostate once again. John slowly began to buck his hips in and out, growling low and gripping tight bruises onto Sherlock's hips. Sherlock wept, desperately trying to hold onto his orgasm, rutting against the sheets. John grasped a handful of chocolaty locks and tugged sharply, his baser instincts growling and snarling.
"Christ, just fuck me, John, and get on with it,"
“Afghanistan,” He said with a chuckle, “How’d you know?”
"Mycroft says I have to,"
And he hadn’t even noticed that wasn’t his name. It
"Mycroft, he said once- I was-s a sociopath," Sherlock whimpered, his skin tingling and itching as John kissed his chin, his red hot ears receiving a few careful licks. "'cause I didn't love anybody, Jawn,"
Mycroft gripped tight to Sherlock's hand, icy eyes melting for just a moment, before speaking, "I do," He pressed a hand to Sherlock's shoulder, whose knees hit the floor with a thump, his ears glaring crimson in embarrassment. Mycroft took the set of keys from his pocket, and with Sherlock's wrists in one hand, he handed both to John, who grasped Sherlock's wrist, warm and callused fingers rubbing a circle there, eyes apologetic and somewhat disgusted as he gripped the keys in his hand.
Sherlock let himself get lost in repetitive work. Often he could just let himself slip into his mind palace and come out again with the entire kitchen floor polished. He shook his head, knees burried in the damp dirt of the tiny garden, grass barely stirring in a soft breeze. Car horns and sirens and dogs barking all drifted away, but his mind palace was solidly locked.
" Sherlock mumbled into John's ear and John sighed, shaking his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh! Hi! I'm Janine!" She cried in an Irish accent, grabbing his hand and shaking it, "Do you have any idea what we're supposed to be doing?" She whispered conspiratorially, and Sherlock shook his head.

"I need to sort out my will and what will happen to my family, my omega specifically, when the time comes,"

"It took some creative persuasion to get him to come," Gregory whispered, winking and Martha gasped, swatting at him with her tea towel.
"Oh my, I'm here, I'm here, no need to shout about it," Mycroft knelt and scooped her into his arms, his scent immediately soothing to her, but she was still quite stroppy, swinging her tiny balled fist about in a gesture of anger.
Sherlock lets one hand go, and instead raises his fingertips, very deliberately, up to his own mouth. He lifts them away again, almost as if he's blowing him a bizarre sort of kiss, and mouthes the words.
Sherlock catches his fists in his hands, pushing them both down. John is shaking and staring up at him with horrified eyes, and Sherlock
John grins.
It doesn't quite feel worth it, somehow.
The seconds ticked by again, drilling periodically in the office's silence.
His voice is ragged, and Sherlock knows better than to protest that he can manage it on his own.
Oscar Wilson's place was nowhere within a hundred mile radius of either one of them.
Sherlock would what now?
this is not fair. This is far and beyond the happiest Sherlock has looked in three months, and he's doing it at a crime scene he's not supposed to be at, his mouth all but glued shut, and where John has no choice but to stand here and let him do it.

John lets his arm go, and Sherlock waltzes free to jump up the stairs instead.

That speaking, writing, about something that hurt him, and acknowledging that it had hurt him, that he was still hurt by it, is an important step to take. The scars are there whether he acknowledges them or not, but he can't start to truly treat them until he acknowledges that they exist and where they came from.

"After... noon..." John blinks dazedly, looking utterly flummoxed. His fist is still curled by his side, and it's absolutely lovely.
Sherlock was limp and unresisting, allowing John to gently fold him upright and pull him out of the long folds of the Belstaff. After long hours of sitting in a filthy alley filled with rubbish, it was going to need to be dry-cleaned. Next he tugged off the suit jacket and his shoes, and then he freed a few of the buttons on his shirt, enough that it no longer put any pressure on his throat, not so much as to actually expose anything. It wasn't that he hadn't seen Sherlock in much more extreme states of undress-- courtesy of Sherlock being Sherlock-- but something about these circumstances made it feel wrong.
"Oh, I'm

John meets Sebastian Wilkes. Unctuous and full of himself and laughably smug, sneering about the freakish spectacle that is Sherlock Holmes- as if the manifestation of slime in human form Sebastian Wilkes is any better. John looks like he'd quite like to punch him. "My colleague, John Watson," Sherlock says-
"John." He drags out each word, enunciated forcibly through gritted teeth. "I'm. Fine." He opens his eyes, and there he is. Lovely, dependable, calm John Watson, his face white in the glow of the monitors, still blinking the sleep out of his baggy eyes.
and John is right. Something in Sherlock's brain must recognise that he needs him there, because he never once moves to go.
Sixteen.
But he can do none of those things, and John is on the brink of a panic attack instead.
He missed Irene Adler.
At the hour on the dot, John called Sherlock. This time, there was no question.
He breathes in sharply and his fingers tangle in his hair, tugging him away just enough to see his eyes in the dark. "You're sure?"
out in the open, and it's too late to take any of it back.
and once she even kissed him on the forehead. She asked after him and accepted grunts as her answer, and told him his playing was lovely as he sawed out melodies of the disgustingly melancholy.
How the hell had they gotten here? How had things gone so
Sherlock has not written, since-- since. It had made being discharged from hospital an ordeal, because when he had been unable to vocally answer his attending's questions, they had tried to get him to write the answers, instead. He hadn't been able to do it.
"Yeah," he started, sobering back up. He cleared his throat and watched Sherlock only out of the corner of his eye. "So... I'm bisexual. Like I said. And maybe one of the reasons I've... been violent with you in the past is because I've always associated violence with liking other men. And I did like you, for a long time. Whether I could acknowledge it or not."
Everything is gone and he feels empty and useless and
Which was, incidentally, how Sherlock ended up sitting at the kitchen table before his microscope, one severed leaf pinned between a pair of laboratory scissors and held aloft, and-
Sherlock rolls his eyes, his teeth still grinding together and his fingers clenched in his lap. It's not
because names and speech were just boring and dull and none moreso than his own.
"When was the last time he ate? A day ago, perhaps? Two?"
Everything else is from John.
that makes his blood pound. It hurts and he wants to scream and tear things apart, and apologise on his knees and beg John to let this somehow be enough and burn the world to cigarette ash all in the same breath.
first date, when his every experience thus far told him that relationships only ended in pain.
John wasn't worried. Oscar had taken advantage of Sherlock, but he wasn't the type to show up drunken and raving on the street, screaming to be let in. And even if he was, Sherlock didn't need Mycroft's men to protect him. He didn't even need John-- he'd proven that tonight.
, because you don't care what happens to yourself and I don't know how to make you. You go out there against Magnussen and get shot again or god knows what else, and I can't do this anymore, Sherlock. I can not keep watching you die."
Sherlock coughed, and, once again, made a grimace that was akin to swallowing a lemon.
The look on Sherlock's face was... it was too much. It was disbelieving and stunned and overwhelmed all at once, and it almost made John want to cry. Because some part of Sherlock clearly didn't believe him and that fact alone was all the difference in the world. That he treated Rosie as a privilege and not a right. It was more than John's parents had ever done.
Answer me right now! Sherlock, where are you?! Sherlock!"
What Sherlock doesn't understand is that everyone always tells him that he is
Greg shares a look with John and shakes his head, gently disengaging to leave all of Sherlock's weight on him. "I'll go get the car," he promises, already set off at a jog, and John can barely contain his relief.
John is just about to press Sherlock for another deduction when he stops, something catching his attention. "Do you hear that?" he asks, more to himself than Sherlock-- broken microphone or not, the quality of John's old laptop over a Skype call is probably not all that great. Sure enough, Sherlock only looks confused as John makes to stand, frowning towards the shut door to his exam room. Shouting. He can hear shouting, from just outside. "Sherlock, sorry, hang on a minute..."
But it wasn't right. Ella's line of logic wasn't what had actually happened. It was a different interpretation, a different story; it wasn't
and if he'd been given more than three seconds to deduce it, he would've seen it right there on John's face what was happening.
John tried to roll it back in his head, playing through conversation that had happened days ago now. Before that horrible look on his face this afternoon and whatever the hell Mycroft was doing here tonight. He had, hadn't he? Wasn't that what had happened? He'd assumed, and Sherlock had... let him assume that. He hadn't challenged it, so he'd thought...
John continued writing, and added a few more.
Gunpowder, wool, whiskey and strawberries. Heaven. Sherlock heard the sound of the shower turning off and the door opening. John stood in the doorway, toothbrush tucked in his cheek, towel wrapped around his waist, tanned skin glistening with droplets of water. Sherlock bit his lip and leaned back on his arms, flinging his head back and giving John sexyeyes.
please
"But...with Esther you..."
Sherlock drew his knees to his chest and his heart wrenched. "...I
"What's the meaning of this?" John said, hands on his hips. Mrs. Hudson opened her mouth with a smile, but Sherlock cut her off, his voice cold and emotionless and remote.
7 oclock came so quickly. Sherlock had showered twice, fixed up his hair and even considered using the tube of mascara that was hiding in the bottom of his drawer. No, no, stupid Sherlock, stop being a girl. He dressed in his best shirt and trousers, carefully tying his dressiest shoes and rubbing his hands down his legs. Get it together Sherlock, get it together. His hands shook terribly, so he popped three little green pills and swallowed them dry. The buzzer rang and Calphurnia, Grace’s wife, opened the door to his room and gave him an encouraging nod. “Knock his socks off, Sherlock Holmes,”
“I’m fine, sir,” John licked his lips and Sherlock almost fainted at this blonde british sex god. John sipped his wine and nodded.
"How can you say that? When my body is so disgusting, when I can't vote or drive or go anywhere without Mycroft's permission. If I weren't like this, I could be someone. But I'm no one, and I'll never be anyone and I don't matter."
WARNING: this author is delicate and needs criticism to be kind and constructive bc he is a sensitive bean <3
The room upstairs was dusty, and Sherlock cried and cried, sitting his back against the wrought iron frame of one of the small twin beds inside. A nursery. He looked through blurring tears to the rocking horse by the window, the dresser with a stack of children's books. Well furnished for a
Sherlock nodded and shakily took her hand and stood, eyes averted as she led him into the switchboard room, abuzz with activity, and through to her small office. She pointed to a chair and he sat, grasping the arms of it tight as she left again, returning with two cups of over brewed, papery tea. Sherlock took his with a mumbled
"I came to see my friend," He said kindly, his omega instincts begging him to tend to the crying child, and he looked down at the bear in his fingers, kneeling down to the shy toddler boy. "Is this yours?" He nodded, grasping the bear close to his chin, retreating behind his mother.
"On your head be it."
Sherlock was miraculous, angelic, his halo of midnight curls topped with a crown of heather and white flowers. He wore a pale grey suit, with a small blue ribbon around his neck, and a traditional mantle around his shoulders with a train held by two adorable little page boys, John's nephews. His ivory skinned glowed with a subtle rosiness, his eyelashes fluttered down to watch his wrists, bound with blue silk rope. Mycroft held his arms by their bindings as they made their way towards the altar. A female omega or beta would have worn a veil, but omega males were married tied up- even if the kidnapping of the bride was no longer commonplace. Did all wedding tradition have such misogynistic roots? Sherlock seemed so, shy, embarrassed, it was lovely, all blushy and hunkered in on himself. His silver blue eyes flickered around the guests before looking right back down. His. That boy, right there, was his. John's chest heaved with pride, his lip turned into a smile. The most beautiful, brilliant boy in the world was
"Shh," John mumbled into the soft warm skin, eyes inspecting every bony joint with care, as if he were memorizing it. He rubbed a firm circle into Sherlock's palm and looked over to his omega, eyes swirling blue like choppy sea. "We'll have them when we're ready, love, both of us."
"I can go myself," She shook her head.
"Don't go, you're strong, please stay, I don't know what's happening, please-"Greg shook his head and tried not to let himself get too emotional about this. Omegas weren't themselves in heat, right? They were desperate for sex, for knots, that's all they could think about, right? Greg might not be an Alpha, but he couldn't deny that Sherlock smelled intoxicating.
"Of course John, of course I will," Sherlock said quickly as the train's horn blared as it pulled up to the platform, a cloud of mist forming around their feet, filling the world with haze as John's eyes found his, two deep cavernous oceans that Sherlock was liable to lose himself in. His boyish grin faded for a moment and he whispered.
"Sherlock, is everything alright?" John said sweetly, reaching down to rub into his mate's shoulders as he hunched over his microscope, books in a heap around him. Sherlock went stiff beneath him, delicate fingers shaking as he replaced a slide.
1. Desert and swim the channel. Not a viable option, as (a) he couldn't swim and he doubted even a strong swimmer could manage it (b) he didn't want to get shot and (c) he didn't want to leave. Not now. Not when he was actually doing something important, when his actions made a difference and he was finally
"You're too beautiful to pull off the lie for long," He said nonchallantly, as if this were obvious and unimportant, "besides, what about your...time?" Sherlock almost rolled his eyes. Heat suppressants were older than synthetic insulin, most certainly never available for the public, but there were medical and professional exceptions.
"He's not yours though, is he? He's Mycroft's, and he's not begging you for anything. Now, please, go back to the dining room and
"Would you like to come into my nest?" Sherlock said with a giggle, pulling open a slot in the duvet and John obliged once his boots were off and discarded to the floor. Sherlock immediately wrapped himself over his Alpha like a sea anenome, his legs locked around his abdomen and his nose pressed to his neck, sucking down breath after delcious breath of pheromones, warm and spicy and soothing. "You're my husband, Jawn," The omega whispered, lapping at the older man's neck delicately.
speak of me that way. ever. again." He slapped his arse harsher, his own palm begining to sting something nasty. Sherlock shrieked, sobbing, trembling, his chest pressed tight against John's thigh. His eyes glistened with tears that spilt over down his cheeks, and John spanked him again and again, the sharp slaps echoing through the room. "Do I make myself clear?"
. That's when he saw it. Like a type writer, but so much heavier with and extra set of letters across the top. Sherlock swallowed thickly, approaching the machine on the table with fearful reverence. His stomach was buzzing with nerves, the entire thing seemed to be surrounded by static, as if it might shock him if he touched it.
Mycroft paused. This was where Gregory hung up the phone, but he didn't. The Alpha swallowed thickly, leaning forward on his elbows, tongue heavy in his mouth.
"Sorry, yes,
at him to turn around.
John peeked open one eye and looked down at the sweet thing in his arms, silver moonlight shining through Sherlock's ringlets of ebony. The omega's eyelashes fluttered, pressed closed, as John brushed his thumbs along pale marble cheekbones, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
"It was Arthur, right?" Sherlock said angrily.
"No Sherlock. Stop it. Now. I'm not going to hurt you, Jesus," John paused, pinching the bridge of his nose, "Jesus Christ, Sherlock! Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?" Sherlock's eyes gleamed with fresh tears and John released his hand from his mouth, brushing through his curls instead, his eyes flickering over his omega's face, who still looked rather terrified. He pulled the small boy into his arms and pet his hair, pulling them under the covers, holding his tiny little spoon around the middle. Sherlock would need to stay on his side, to keep from choking in his sleep.
"She won't die, Mrs. Hudson, just ovulate, and then it's back to your hutch." Sherlock swirled the jar of his urine and Mrs. H furrowed her brows, a bit unsettled by seeing that so early in the morning.
be something you can do!"
"I'm so sorry Sherlock, for all of it. I was wrong to say you don't get to decide when we do these things, because you do, it's your body too, love."
"Yes, Sherlock?"
"Gregory, it's complicated," Mycroft let go of his hands and tucked them into his pockets.
The solution to his frightful independence had been Miss Adler- an Alpha, with an bonded omega of her own, and a very firm hand. Miss Adler was hateful. He'd
it. Wanted to be as close to John as he possibly could, skin on skin, touching him, touching John, even if it hurt, he wanted to please John. He wanted it horribly. And it was revolting.
brother," Mycroft smiled, "Now go to bed."
"They'll be ready, Sebastian, I promise you. They're smart, especially the new boy,"
"No," He squeaked and John snarled, hand pressing offending letter to the wood with his finger pointed at Sherlock.
“This one’s
"You don't seem fine, and if someone's broke your heart, we'll break 'im," She pat his shoulder and sat on the bench next to him, and Janine gave Sherlock a knowing look across the table.
For some god forsaken reason, the thought made his tummy flutter, and he pulled his bottom lip between his teeth nervously. It was not quite evening, and golden sun shone through the tall windows, casting big square shapes of light on the floor of the party. Somebody had put flowers and banners everywhere, which was strange. Dying plant carcasses had a rather macabre form of beauty, he supposed, but he doubted that's how most people saw it. Sherlock didn't know most of these people, and he kept his eyes down. He didn't want to know them. He didn't want to speak to any of them, these people who were celebrating his shame.
Sherlock could barely whisper, his voice threatening to break, "I will," looking up to John, eyes full and glassy and pure. The vicar smiled, turning to John.
“Goodnight, little Sherlock, daddy loves you very much,” John petted Sherlock’s hair as Sherlock closed his eyes once more. John’s heart was full as he flicked the light off, never looking away from his sleeping boy. His perfect, kind, brilliant ,
,” John growled, giving the man a hard stare, to which he scoffed, winking at Sherlock and heading away. Sherlock kept his eyes on the ground. He felt dirty. And not in the good way. Not good at all. John leaned in and whispered sternly, “Get your things, we’re leaving. Now.” Sherlock nodded quickly, rushing to retrieve their coats. When he returned, John gripped his wrist and pulled him away, dragging him along in front of everyone, causing Sherlock to turn beet red with embarrassment.
Silence.
"No! No I'm not letting go, just hold on to me and everything will be fine, we'll get through this, just stay- stay with me," Sherlock choked, his eyes laden with tears, shaking his head desperately, pumping his legs weakly.
"Shh, you're so beautiful, darling, you're so beautiful," John quickly got to work testing his cloaca- which had opened up, but not enough yet. "You're not ready yet, darling boy," John pressed kisses to the tops of his quivering thighs, warm hands holding his ankles upward. "On your front, Sherlock,"
John only laughed and looked him straight on. His eyes were dark, brooding, and Sherlock shivered. They got to daddy’s Aston Martin and Sherlock’s door was opened and he was buckled before he could say anything else. The drive was tense, John gripping the steering wheel tight, eyes tight on the road. Sherlock ran his hands down his thighs, trying to will his tears away, to stop hyperventilating but he couldn’t. He felt like the dirtiest, whoriest boy in the world. Daddy was so cross, maybe…
John leaned over the clanging metal rails of the swaying ship, eyes lost in the choppy, foamy waves, his feet planted firmly on the deck. The ship creaked and John watched as each slapping wave hit at the large red cross painted on the hull.
you." John opened his mouth to counter but the organ began to play, and everyone scrambled into their places. The Vicar smiled, holding his bible tightly and giving John the eyebrows. John swallowed and turned to the doors, his heart seemingly stopped in his chest. His nieces giggled as they spread flowers in their cute fluffy dresses, and his heart tightened. Someday, maybe, him and Sherlock would have children too. Beautiful little him-and-Sherlock's. The thought sent him reeling, so he rialed up his alpha to keep himself from fainting. He stood tall, parade rest. Feet shoulder width apart and hands folded behind his back. Clara came next, looking lovely as usual, with a small bouquet of flowers. She gave John a friendly smile before taking her spot on the other side of the aisle.
An omega stood on the platform excitedly as the train pulled in, a cloud steam around her ankles, her tummy large under her dress. She stood on the toes of her kitten heels, and she clutched her handbag with one hand, cupping the top of her stomach with the other, watching as each  went by. When the train stopped, a tall blond man leapt out of the carriage and rushed over to her, hands resting on the sides of her stomach as he pulled her in for a kiss, fingers brushing through her caramel brown hair, pulling back and grinning before talking to her stomach.
“Going through my things again?” Sherlock quivered and craned his head further down, his neck bare and exposed to John.
"I hope this doesn't put a damper on the dinner tonight," She said sadly, folding her hands in her lap.
"Oh," Sherlock nibbled on his lip some more, his heart thumping in his chest. He blinked away tears and took a shaky breath. "That's- that's good,"
John looked round in a potted plant on the step, pulling out a set of keys and opening the large white double doors. He pushed open the door, flicking on the lights and pulling Sherlock along into the empty dance hall, still stale from second-hand smoke and snuck-in booze. The floor was sprinkled with paper pieces, banners running along the ceiling.
"Goodnight Sherlock,"
"What was your name?"
"I, John Watson,"
"Sherlock is none of your concern."
“Christ, Sherlock, are you insane?!” Sherlock was confused, his eyebrows furrowed and his eyes wide.
"No, Mycroft, I
(See the end of the chapter for
a male omega, it made one's head spin a bit.
"Probably a few weeks or a month," He smiled as Sherlock's delicate fingers traced over the skin, his eyes flickering, cataloging every centimetre of John's face.
"It's lovely, John,"
"Moved in?" Sherlock's cheeks flared pink as he brought his knees close to his chest, balancing the base of the phone between his legs.
*kisses*
"Does it hurt?" He said softly, and John only smiled.
"Don't say that!" Sherlock gasped, flopping upwards and throwing a leg over John, palms on his chest and sweet little nose oh-so-close to John's, "It won't be a long while at all Jawn, it'll all be over soon, and then you can be a doctor and I can be a scientist and we can live here, together and we can forget this whole war. I don't fancy it, John.
"Oh, Sherlock, oh
"I didn't want it to hurt! I didn't want..." Sherlock mumbled, tears flowing free, arms hanging limp at his sides. "I didn't want to hurt," He whispered, his conscious mind slipping as the drug took it's effects. John closed his eyes and growled even lower and louder, the omega trembling and whimpering, cowering in fear. "m'sorry, Jawn, don't hurt me, please, you can still have me, I won't fight, please Jawn, I won't fight back I won't-"
"Sherlock is your legal property, Dr. Watson, I don't understand how you couldn't know this,"
blushing. Simply the cold weather, that's why his cheeks flushed with crimson and his heart beat faster than a train. He swallowed nervously and placed the card to the side, fingers resting on it's front, as if he were making sure it wouldn't disappear.
"Stop! stop this," Sherlock set his tea down with a clatter, and John eased his hand away, brows furrowed in concern. "Why are you doing this?!"
The night air was cool on Sherlock's cheeks, rustling through his curls, forcing him to brush them from his eyes if he was to see. John's breathy snores filtered through the doors of the terrace, and Sherlock couldn't help but smile. God help him. He looked over his shoulder to watch the rising and falling of John's chest, covered in sheets from the waist down, except for a single muscular leg poking out from beneath them, glowing with a golden bronze. John was, John was beautiful, like a statue, athletic and strong and handsome and rugged and everything that Sherlock was not.
He didn't fight it. At least now he would die somebody, his own man, this was his choice. Greg might call him a hero. Mycroft would be pleased to be rid of him. John could remarry and find someone good and sweet and domesticated. Mrs. Hudson could make her biscuits and tell the story of that strange boy that used to live in 221b. He smiled and let himself sink, his eyes shut, resigned to lie forever under the ocean. That wasn't so bad, he thought.
Mycroft sighed heavily and closed his classified files, shuffling a few important papers away from view. "Come in,"
"What a turn up for the books, I'm rubbish too" He smirked and Sherlock giggle in spite of himself, if not only from nervousness. "Now come on, let's get out of here,"
“Is that the name of the game, baby? I can play lots of games with a lost little boy-” The man was cut off by someone grabbing his collar and pulling him off of Sherlock. John was livid, so angry he was smiling.
“He likes you,” Ross laughed. Stephen never stopped gazing into those eyes- so deep and full of mourning and midnight. Ross’s smiles were the most beautiful thing in the multiverse, he decided, yes, this was the most beautiful creature he had ever encountered. His chosen. His badass CIA agent. What a lovely, lovely thought.
"I wondered when you'd decide to wake up,"
The phone went dead and Mycroft was speechless, head limply hanging in the air, phone slipping in his fingertips. Caring was not an advantage, and yet here he was. He pushed a button on his desk and sighed.
"Yes, sir,"
"No, it doesn't hurt, unless I nick myself, which doesn't happen much anymore."
For some reason it made him want to wrap himself inside of it and never come out again. But he couldn't do that. Not when he was in an Alpha's bedroom, with the same Alpha downstairs, about to come upstairs, about to mate with him. His omega screamed at him to strip, position himself submissively, wait patiently, beg for it. He only wanted to cry some more. He heard footsteps and scuffling below, so he hurriedly pulled the syringe from his pocket, pulling off his trousers. He quickly drew up the clear fluid into it, squirting a bit out the top to release any air bubbles. He knew how to do this. He swallowed, eyes damp, and jammed the needle into his thigh, biting on his lip to keep from crying. He quickly deposited the needle and vial into the bedside table drawer, crawling into the center of the bed and hugging his knees. He closed his eyes and waited.
"Sherlock, please, we need to talk."
"Was I good, John?" Sherlock whispered into the fogged warmth and quiet, and John grunted, wrapping his arms around his middle and caressing his stomach gently, pressing a kiss to the shell of his ear as his omega purred.
"You seem to forget your place so often, Sherlock, are you really as clever as you think you are?" Sherlock keened and planted a kick right in Mycroft's solar plexus. A little knowlege of annotomy and an omega was not as helpless as expected. Mycroft groaned and sucked in a breath, dropping a humilated Sherlock to the gravel. "Go inisde. Now. Get cleaned up and don't do it again." Sherlock stiffled a fake chuckle, still desperate to maintain his dignity.
"Yes."
"You're still not allowed to die in this war, John Watson,"
"I miss him a lot, sir," Sherlock said quickly and Moran nodded.
“Please don’t call me that, your highness, really.” He nervously put his hands in his pockets. Whenever he was around wakandans he felt small. No, not small. Just, not in control. And he had spent his whole life trying to be in control. He jarred against the memories of his childhood.
“I’d, I’d like it to be more, sir,” He said a little louder, blushing furiously. Good God in Heaven, he was so innocent. Sweet little kitten. “Can, we go home, sir?”
I really wanted this to be longer, I promise, but here I am at 4 in the morning, two days after starting this chapter, and I need to get this out or I'll never finish anything.
“It snowed again last night, daddy, I made a snowman on the roof!” John pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to cool off, not to overreact.
would be was apparently not something he elected to share, so Sherlock was horribly lost. Suddenly a group of women went by, in tight skirts and neat hats and he breathed easy. Navy Girls. WRENS. Probably radio transmissions personnel.
"Do you trust me Sherlock?" John said softly into the air between their faces, and Sherlock looked up instantly, opal eyes glittering, his bottom lip drawn between his teeth.
"Does John know what?" Sherlock growled, fists clenched.
SIlence.
"This country has the most powerful navy this world has ever seen, and you're trying to tell me that we can't evacuate our men from France? What does Lubrun say?"
"Yes John," Sherlock's omega was so upset that he had done this to John, even if Sherlock hadn't done anything wrong, that he found himself grasping out and curling into John's neck. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, John, please forgive me,"
His seed began to surge into his omega, by insticts alone, he growled, pressing Sherlock down by his back and shoving forward his knot, squeezing through, his bullocks finally pressed completely to Sherlock's arse. Sherlock screamed, his eyes watering,
Sherlock was now facing a much larger problem than his flatmate, brother, and a stranger seeing his naked arse. No,
"Sherlock? Darling, please let me in," John sighed, leaning against the cool wooden door. Sherlock whimpered and curled tighter. "Love, I'm so so sorry, please forgive me, Sherlock," John closed his eyes and awkwardly tucked his hands into his pockets.
"What would Downing Street want with-" Sherlock's mouth hung open in realization, his eyes wide, chest tight with exasperation.
"I won't bite you, little thing, just have a little bit of fun, huh? Or are you not that kind of boy?" Thomas whispered in his ear, breath hot and foul smelling. "Because I think you're oh-so naughty..." Sherlock gasped as Thomas was pulled off of him, the redheaded man growling in frustration, turning to leer his canines at whomever was usurping his territory. Sherlock's eyes pinched closed, heart racing, his cheeks flushing a deep crimson- the smell of two alphas in conflict sending involuntary shivers and shakes through him.
me to," Came a snarl from the door, and Greg grinned at who was arguing with the bobby at the door.
"Of course I know."
“Do you think Melly saw all that?” He whispered sheepishly and John smiled and shook his head.
Sherlock bit his lip hard, flinching at each thud of John's feet down the stairs. The front door slammed shut, reverberating through the floor. Sherlock pulled his feet up onto the smooth leather, hugging his knees to his chest. He wasn't crying. He wasn't.
heads up- I'm a Sherlock fan first, MCU fan second, and I had to do a bit of research for this chapter and the next few, so please excuse any comic book inaccuracies <3
"Neighbor's garden."
“Hi,” He said sweetly, John laughed. God Sherlock was gorgeous.
“No silly, it’s Christmas Eve, we’ve got the whole day to ourselves.” Sherlock smiled happily as John pulled him out and onto the bathmat, running the towel over him and through his hair. John slipped a soft t-shirt over his head, drifting down to the hem and squeezing Sherlock’s arse.
"Lie back, Sherlock," John said gently, hands on Sherlock's shoulder blades, holding him up, Sherlock squirmed, straining his neck up to avoid the water. "Settle, love," John said sweetly, steadily. Sherlock leaned back, still hesitant. John nodded in approval before lightly moving his hands away. Sherlock panicked, thrashing in the water and hugging back to John, whimpering.
"Oh, dear, I don't think John would want you smoking, love," Sherlock glared as Mrs. Hudson followed him and pulled it away from his lips, watching an expertly formed ring form in the air in front of his flickering eyes.
A sob wracked through Sherlock's body, his arms wrapped around his tummy. His eyes pressed closed and he breathed out swiftly through his nose.
"Lestrade," He said curtly, turning and continuing his work with a cool facade.
"I like it," Sherlock's cheek flushed and Marie made a sound.
"It wouldn't do you harm to
“Can it be a big tree, daddy?”
"Jawn that's not a surprise!"
"Would you dance with me, Sherlock?" John said softly to his hand, breath warm and sweet and sending a shiver on the skin of his knuckles. The omega swallowed thickly, lip quivering ever so slightly, trembling under the soft gaze of the alpha's amorous eyes.
3 September 1939
He ripped open the letter faster than a kiddie on Christmas, pulling out the pages, eyes flickering down as if he were watching a tennis match.
"Oh that's trite. Grow up, Sherlock," John pulled his coat over his shoulders and Sherlock scowled, flopping into an armchair.
I'll do. it. myself." Sherlock turned and ran from the study, the door swinging behind him. Mycroft's jaw fell open as the little figure of his brother ran down the hall, turning and taking the stairs two at a time.
"I'm- I'm fine, I'm just- sleepy-"
"Hey it's no problem, bit scandalous to have a beta as a best man though,"
"Ich möchte zuerst!" (I wanna go first!) One of his comrades growled, shoving the first one off.
I'm not going to 'get on with it'," John unzipped his trousers, tugging them down to his knees as he pulled them both down to the floor, straddling Sherlock and grasping his face with both hands as their teeth clacked together awkwardly, their limbs shuffling before Sherlock was finally lying flat and John was on his knees, their erections brushing together with electric sparks. Sherlock let out a whine, pushing his hips up and grinding them together.
He practically screamed as John continued, his knot begining to swell and his fingernails pressing cresent shapes into Sherlock's pale skin. He was ghastly oversensitive and each thrust felt like fireworks inside his body.
“N-no, ’sokay daddy,” He mumbled into his shoulder as daddy carried him back to the sitting room. He settled them both on the sofa and clicked on the television.
"How long would it take until you had a beard?"
"Your brother, sir, he's gone into heat, quite suddenly," Violet gasped and Mycroft shook his head.
"Sherlock, my father served in the war, he commanded an air squadron." John adjusted his collar, his throat tight at the thought of his father, with his horrible grey beard and that goddamn pipe.
"I. hate. you." Sherlock whispered, eyes fiery and teeth grit.
"Mach dir keine Sorgen, kleiner Junge, wir kümmern uns gut um dich, füllen dich auf und schicken dich voller arischer Babys nach Hause," (don't worry, little boy, we'll take good care of you, fill you up nice and good, full of our pure German seed, send you home full of aryan babies) He growled, his breath hot and foul on Sherlock's skin.
He gasped when there was a knock on the door and stood frightfully as it swung open.
“Feelings mutual, Agent,” Ross looked at him quizzically. He hadn’t mentioned it previously. “
"Fuck off."
"Sherlock, I- I want to say that I am sorry, for not, appreciating you, cherishing you the way that I should have. I want to give us another chance. I- I've failed you,"
thank you all for your support! <3 <3 <3 sorry this chapter was so short
"Sherlock, you're alright," John said firmly as Sherlock trembled, reaching out to take his omega's hand, "I'm here, love, and nothing bad can happen when I'm here."
"Sherlock!" With one hand over the mouthpiece of the phone, Mycroft shouted up the staircase, "Sherlock it's for you!"
“Can I call you Master, Jawn?” John smirked and looked down at Sherlock kindly.
"I'm sorry," He said softly, eyes wide and pale blue.
"Come,
"I'm sorry?"
Sherlock tensed and John rubbed a circle in his back. Those two were going to be harder for him, John knew that.
"For god's sake, I'm not wearing it!" He cried, crossing his arms and closing his knees together, tears threatening the back of his throat. Greg sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.

"Well, you won't be for long, an 18 year old, unbonded male omega? We better keep him out of sights or we won't have any men to ourselves!" Vanecia said over her shoulder and the girls laughed. Sherlock gave a fake smile, his insides burning with horrible guilt. He forgot that he said he was 18. The woman he'd enlisted with hadn't said anything, but he knew she didn't believe him. He wasn't even fully grown.
“Detective Inspector, really, this is a new low even for you,” Sherlock snapped as he took in the crime scene. The dead woman was splayed on her back, with clear signs of strangulation around her neck. Sherlock sniffed the air- men’s cologne, but no bottle of it in the bathroom and no signs of a man living here. Window latch, broken, recently, pane tipped open wide enough for a medium sized man to crawl through. Lestrade eyed him sharply and crossed his arms.
thank you for reading! I promise there is more on the way!! Comments and suggestions are always appreciated <3
"You know her?"
"...dismissed. Holmes, stay back please," The girls shuffled away, the gravel crunching beneath their feet and Sherlock swallowed, still standing there, stupidly. Like a doll, his clothes fluttering against him in the wind, his hands numb and limp at his sides.
"What?"
"To Baker street, to my house," John said softly, excitedly, "Oh, I meant to tell you, I've received a letter from a certain 'Uncle Rudy', whomever that is, he's offered us his house for honeymoon, in France," John paused, "but I'm not sure about taking you over there, not these days,"
"Sherlock we're back, are you asleep?!" Janine whispered, shaking his shoulders. His eyes snapped up to meet hers and he shook his head, standing quickly and hitting his head on a beam.
"Sherlock, this, I mean,
“Everyone be quiet, she’s coming!” The hotel room key beeped and she stepped into the apartment and everyone shouted.
"Oh, I see."
"You really are something, Sherlock." Esther shook her head. "Alright, I think we've got him clean enough for you to handle," She pat a sudsy pale shoulder and stood, straightening her apron and collecting some things off the bathroom vanity. Sherlock began to wash his own hair. "Her ladyship said you've got a suitor, huh?" Esther smirked, leaning aginst the vanity and giving Sherlock the eye.
boy, so shut up Beatrice," Sherlock winced and blushed, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly, looking to Janine for help.
He looked back at the mirror- maybe it was silly to think that his clothes mattered at all. What a petty,
"Do you know what happens to omegas who don't obey, Sherlock?"
"I can't stay, Sherlock, please, just- sleep, sunshine, you'll be alright," Greg placed him softly on the bed, patting his shoulder and turning to leave. He paused.
He reached the big black door with golden letters and smiled, pulling out his key and pushing the door open. He looked up and heard shuffling upstairs, talking. He knit his brows together and pulled off his hat, depositing his bag of clothes by the door and taking the stairs quickly, reaching the top and eliciting and excited cry from his housekeeper.
Sherlock, don't be so bloody emotional and
any guesses as to that experiment? ;)
," John grunted as he stripped of his trousers quickly, eager cock bobbing against his abdomen as Sherlock's needy fingers tugged at his shirt buttons.The omega eagerly opened his knees and angled his hips upward, his body desperate for relief now, the pains beginning in his tummy.
"Omegas, you mean?" Gregory snapped, eyebrows hunched.
"You got small fingers, omega, just, reach in, find it and pull it out." Sherlock bit his bottom lip and pressed a kiss to John's lips before sitting back, rolling up his sleeves and taking a wobbly breath.
going into heat, Mycroft," Sherlock's tears flew free now, "You don't get to just,
"Shut up Beatrice,"
"Second mate?" John snorted, "Is this 1850?"
"John! Oh, hello! Help us catch her!" Mrs. Hudson smiled, and John looked quizzically at Sherlock, who froze when their eyes met, paling as if he'd seen a ghost. John swallowed, his eyes melting with a dark blue softness.
and be respectful to your future husband," Sherlock puffed out his lip and properly sulked, looking Mycroft up and down before giving him a smirk.
Sherlock grumbled to the floor, a second wave of anger filling him at his debased orientation. Irene grinned and crouched next to the young child, petting his hair.
"John," Sherlock whispered, eyes cataloging every detail of his darkened skin, the the pale glow of lamplight casting glorious shadows on his tanned and freckles skin, and Sherlock traced a finger down his nose. Sherlock really did adore that nose. John smiled and carded fingers through his delicate, velvet soft hair, thumbs brushing his ears before grasping his by the sides of his cheeks and pressing their lips together.
"My brother's an omega, he got married at 12, can you believe that?" Beatrice added.
"It's empty," Sherlock said obviously, looking round, pressing a lone piece of confetti between his fingers. John smirked, walking over to the phonograph, cranking the handle and putting the needle down, the large amplifier twirling out into the empty room. Soon the silence was softened by a crackling melody of
thank you so very much for reading! Please tell me what you think! <3
Mycroft was left to the empty hallway, knuckles white as he gripped his umbrella's handle- feeling just a tiny sliver of what might have been regret, before shaking it off and turning back to his study. Long night's work would do him good- he could really get lost in it, and there was so much to be done these days.
be a thief- couldn’t possibly just be a dull murder, Lestrade?” Sherlock snapped off his gloves in a huff, his mind whirring. John must’ve forced Lestrade to give him a case,
He looked to his pile of suitcases and knelt to go through them as John turned on the water to start shaving. Sherlock waited until the door snapped shut to remove his pants and nightshirt, suddenly overcome with a need for modesty, even after last night. Once naked he quickly found his way into pants, tall socks and a vest, pulling a dark blue button down over his shoulders, and stepping into tan trousers, hopping a bit as he zipped them up. He clipped on his braces and flipped his cuffs over to clasp each pearl button closed before selecting his brown oxfords and lacing them. He spritzed himself with his perfume, if only because it hid his own scent somewhat, and tied his hair up in a scarf, far too tired to wrangle with it this morning. He looked over to a tall mirror in the corner, slowly stepping towards it and examining his reflection. Film star? No way. Not with that face. He turned and closed his cases again, now terribly unsure what to do. He sneaked across the floor and towards the washroom, pushing open the door slightly.
"Sherlock, off the phone, it's time for bed,"
"The time will fly by, Sherlock, I promise."
"Is he, you know-" The nurse turned to Janine as someone touched his forehead, he could feel the looks of the men standing around him in the crowd, but he was too lost to care.
Sherlock shook his head, his throat burning and his nose running horribly, tears continuing to flow down his cheeks in rivers. John's heart clenched, his lungs suddenly devoid of air.
*kisses and hugs*
"Why do you think she needs discipline? Really, you sound like a

"really Mycroft, you could do better than to invite dirty city boys inside your house, it's disgraceful."
," He keened, head thrown back, eyelids pressed closes.
”You’re new here,” She said obviously, licking her teeth, her lipstick was blood red and she smelled like powder and ginger. Sherlock nodded shyly and a few of them giggled, “Where’re you off to?”
"No!" His feet tumbled back, "No I won't do it!"
"No, no I'm okay, really," Sherlock said cheerfully, his heart glazed over and solid, "perfectly alright,"
"But, Jawn, I-" John shook his head and continued his kisses to the other hand.
His heart leapt in his chest, throat catching at the thought, bondbite aching something awful. He put a hand over his shirt collar, hoping to soothe it.
eyes that made him nervous.
"I did no such..thing... Oh
"Holmes, I swear to god-" Sherlock didn't let him finish before rushing out into the woods, and the RAMC infantrymen exchanging glances.
“Marty?” Everett called sing-songy as he turned the key to his apartment, stepping in and being overwhelmed with how empty it felt. “Marty I’m home,” Ross sighed and went into his bedroom, tossing his clothes into a suitcase.
"How do you know that?" Sherlock quirked his lip and cupped his hand around her ear in a whisper.
"Mr. Holmes!" Came a throaty posh cry from down the hall and Sherlock threw his head back, leaning up on his elbows and letting out a rather dramatic sigh, as two kitten heels labouriously stomped nearer. "Sherlock what is this mess? Monty, Holly, Willow, let him go!" The puppers immediately dropped his sheet and ran around their owners ankles before returning to the naked detective and licking at his face.
,” Sherlock’s voice cracked into a whisper. John grinned and pulled out, tapping his arse firmly.
"I promise," John smiled as Sherlock nodded, leaning back again, the army doctor's strong hands beneath him. "Let go, Sherlock.
Worried about what? Sherlock nestled back into John's warmth, tucking his nose into his neck and gulping down deep breaths of his strong and protective scent, and for maybe the first time in his life, he felt well and truly safe.
*I don't know if wwii counts as a spoiler but who knows
“Da-addy!” Sherlock rolled his eyes and pressed a tentative kiss on daddy’s scruffy cheek, closing his eyes delicately. A deep grumble vibrated out of John, his pupils flaring as he licked his lips. He grabbed the back of Sherlock’s nape with firm fingers, brushing against his hair before pulling Sherlock in for a passionate kiss- his beloved left flustered and blushing as John breathed heavily, sucking and pulling, nibbling gently. Sherlock giggled and pressed back a bit, exploring John’s teeth with his tongue. John chuckled and tugged on Sherlock’s hair, the smaller boy trembling and whining in that sweet voice that had not entirely adjusted to it’s silky baritone register.
"Sherlock!" Vanecia smiled, "thank goodness I caught you, one of the girls found this when we were away," In her hands rested his camera, and his chest grew tight.
Fucking hell. Fuck. He wanted to rip his heart out of his chest for betraying him, his disgusting feelings and urges.
"Maybe" by the Ink Spots
“Shh, that’s it, Sherlock, we’re almost there,” John paused but didn't pull out, calmly rubbing his thumb across Sherlock's trembling shoulder blades. Sherlock took a moment, shaking still, arms aching behind his back. Daddy rubbed him gently, lulling affections and sweet things in his ear. His words escaped him, so he nodded to continue, hair swishing, the edges of the green ribbon cutting mildly into his neck.
Completely and entirely. John sipped at his freshly poured whiskey, setting it on the side table by his arm chair before approaching. He circled Sherlock like a predator stalking it's prey. He loved him, hopelessly, but Sherlock's blatant disrespect at the crime scene was unacceptable. John knelt down in front of Sherlock, lifting his chin and examining his teary ice blue eyes. He pulled his dogtags off of Sherlock, slipping them into his pocket, wrapping his sturdy leather collar around in their absence. He fastened the collar a bit tighter than necessary, enjoying Sherlock's stutter at the slight pressure.
"Lovely, yes." Sherlock whispered, fascinated by the mirror, the creature on the other side. He couldn't decide if he liked it or not. "Intelligent, no."
Silence.
“Da-addy it’s only midday!” He gasped, slumping back thoroughly exhausted.
"I love you, Sherlock, more than the world," John whispered into his curls, reaching up to card fingers through the velvety strands, a shiver running down the omega's spine. Sherlock smiled and leaned forward, his forehead against John's shoulder.
"Sherlock," He said, "we had a deal. It's been two years of you growling and nipping at every Alpha you see. And now, I've met Dr. Watson a few times, he's an upright bloke, and I think you could love him, if you'd stop being so stubborn. I've sat back and let you ignore all advances, but not anymore."
"I'll make you a deal, Sherlock, if you promise not to do anything stupid. Stay and I'll wrestle My into letting you come to London with me. You can stay at our flat, you won't be lonely in the city."
"Mm?"
"Weakness is hurting your wife because you're drunk, Harry," John snarled, but tried to retain his cool and control his alpha. True strength, being a real man, was being the one in control of his alpha, not his alpha controlling him. That's what mum had always said, after dad had gone on another "business trip" with his whore.
I promise more angst and smuttiness next chapter!!! i'm just in a wretched mood lately, but I promise it'll get better
. She shut her mouth but furrowed her brows at him. His secret was safe for now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly, he looked up, and John gasped, half in shock, half in relief to see him, pale diaphanous eyes glowing with realization, and the omega shuddered, pulling himself up, much to the worry of his companion, and ATS woman who was holding him by his biceps, trying to convince him to sit before she looked over, somehow recognizing John as well.
"Well, it could've gotten lost in the post sir, these things happen all the-" The babbling solider was cut off by a look that spoke volumes and he shut his mouth, scratching the back of his neck, "I'm sorry sir,"
Sherlock does not look at all like he wants for him to go. But he can't say anything to stop him, and John hurries for the door.
Seconds ticked by. Sherlock sat there looked aggravated and aggrieved as ever, his jaw twitching and his finger twitching with it, and John just stared at him. A bomb might as well have gone off. In the flat, from Sherlock's mouth, inside John's own head.
"Tea, then."
"Not if he doesn't want it!"
"Never thought I'd see them working together like this, I'll tell you that much." He hesitates, his voice kept carefully low. John doesn't know why he bothers. Sherlock might as well have deleted their presence in the room entirely. "...how's he doing, then?"
He rolls his eyes, once again keeping his hands locked in his lap. Mycroft would sooner quit and retire to Sussex. Sherlock would sooner kill himself.
Oscar tried to squirm back, tried to tug his head out of Sherlock's grip, his eyes wide. "You!" he gasped, jerked back. "How dare you?! You're a drug addict, a
His own blood smears all over the worst of it, in handprints and wet, fresh splotches. It's still wet, somehow, even all these months later. It's like a beacon, drawing him down to the worst of the damage, and he finds it every time. Disgusting, leaking boxes, files that are out of order, filing cabinets that burn to the touch and are borderline radioactive with filth.
The next, Sherlock had buried himself in his nest of blankets, and started to read.
When Sherlock next surfaces, it is to a hospital room infested solely with flowers, get-well cards, and sentiment. His company is one of Mycroft's faceless minions, sitting stone-faced and unblinking on the edge of the opposite bed, thumbing through a conversation on his phone.
"The silent treatment?" Mycroft tries next. "Quite mature, Sherlock." He rises to his feet to begin to pace carefully about the room. The powdered sugar in the ashtray is ignored, in a very blatant slap to the face, and he moves instead towards his violin sits, cushioned on the sofa. "Music. What a lovely, healthy, scientifically supported thing to try. Have you ever considered that?"
"You think you ruined him, but the truth is you're nothing more than a footnote in Sherlock Holmes' bibliography. You're barely even that. You're a blip on the radar that no one will even remember past the prologue. But in yours? In yours, which was already written in full the day you decided to take advantage of a fifteen year old?"

He rips John's clothes off two minutes before the police arrive. Lestrade walks in on him dissecting the Semtex vest, wire by wire, and it's not enough. He tears the vest apart down to the threads, until there is nothing but a mountain of fraying green cotton in his arms, and further still; he rips them apart until it is nothing dust, nothing but
John has bolted around the corner just in time to see Mr. Moron hauling his fist back against where Sherlock slouches on the sidewalk. Lit only in the glow of the streetlamps, he is a furious and vengeful angel, leading the charge down the street and
It takes another slow, few moments, everything shifting like molasses. John frowns at him, letting Sherlock to play absently with his fingers. He can tell something isn't right, but he can also tell that nothing is desperately wrong.
he groans, waving a hand to encompass his entire, desperately unhappy visage. "I'm fine. Obviously. And even if I wasn't, there's hardly any way you could have possibly known." Sherlock rubs his face again and tries very hard to shut his overactive brain
John turns, very slowly, back around. Every trace of his sleepy, early-morning affection is gone, and instead of a smile he now stares are Sherlock with such sudden intensity that the feeling moves inside him and robs the space from the anxiety that wants to grow.
"Gay, yes," Sherlock said flatly. "Ho-mo-
"Well--" Dr. Wilson stepped decisively closer, planting himself inside and looking down at Sherlock with eyes that he couldn't interpret. "For starter's, you're sitting on the floor, and you're holding ice on your face, Sherlock. Come on, let's get you up."
The nervous work of his fingers dug deeper into his trousers, his eyes slitting open and his shoulders hunching even closer around his ears. "I was so

with post-case excitement, and-
It suggests brain damage.
He can't even do cocaine right, anymore.
"No! Of course not! I-" Lestrade yanks out his phone, as if it might've magically texted Sherlock of its own accord. It has not, of course. There is no text, to or from Sherlock. "You told me not to, not until he was feeling better! You said he's only taking cold cases for now!"
Dr. Oscar Wilson... the man that had hugged Sherlock? And given him his card?
Lestrade still didn't bother to so much as lift his head. He looked about as bored as Sherlock felt, and he didn't make any move whatsoever to pour him any coffee.
"It's okay," he tells him, pressing his face again to his hair. It's not okay. He wants to apologise again, to say he's sorry until he's blue in the face and then keep saying it, but that's not what Sherlock needs or wants so he keeps it out of his mouth. "Sherlock--" He hesitates, because he's not sure if this is a question he wants to risk right now, but in the end, he must. "Will he come back, do you think? Do we need to figure out something to do for when I can't be here?"
He starts to step forward, already sifting through a few choice words for what's best to say to keep everything calm. The girl does need looking at, he is a doctor... if he volunteers, maybe he'll be able to put the budding explosion on ice until the police arrive. Or perhaps--
They'd had a prescription for a strong anti-anxiety medication, to be taken as needed. Sherlock, in his infinite wisdom, has refused to fill it.

that he's meant to meet, right here, right now, with John's fingers clasped around his and nothing in the space between them but bedsheets and Sherlock's own silence. It's pressure to perform and he hates himself but he tugs one hand free, his throat suddenly dry and his chest gone hollow.
John didn't want to hear
Because John was waiting for him to react, watching him, growing more and more unsettled the longer Sherlock just sat there like a statue, and the longer it went on, the more John thought he'd done something
Sherlock must've seen something of it on his face, because he softened, just a little. The first stayed in his eyes but the hard anger behind it began to fade, the tension taut in him from head to toe loosening, like a bolt that had been turned too tight. "We have wasted so much time already, John. If we were to have been waiting all these years for the... for the Right Time-- when would that have even been? Between me being dead and you being married, and then, and then,
"You know," he mutters, "when I tell you that you need to sleep more, I really didn't mean on the
Oh, it's definitely not good that that makes him proud, a little, isn't it? He wants to show it off, the same way John sometimes shows him off. Divorced. Because Sherlock is important to John.

too short for the beanpole that he was but swallowing up his shoulders and chest anyway, because he was rail-thin. His muddy hair fell over his eyes and his hanging head, knotted with leaves and twigs-- perhaps he'd slept in a park-- and his angular face, with hollow cheeks and heavy eyes, was flushed with the heat of a high.

John's fingers dig into him again, scrabbling from his shoulders to his back to his hair, scratching between expanses of skin and angry scars without regard for the difference, and that, that is perfect too, and when Sherlock sucks one of his legs kicks to tangle in his and this is amazing. It's sweaty and messy and Sherlock's own transport is tempting to fray apart at the seams, and it. is.
Andrews' mouth curled. "I see he really hasn't changed after all," he snipped, with another sharp tug on his jacket. "Still needs big brother to sweep up after him behind his back after barely bothering to show up. You have a good day, Dr. Watson. And my condolences."

He certainly had collected a lot to think about.
"For the good of my business," Davis starts, his words a slow, almost lazy drawl, "because it's not all that economical a model for my repeat customers to off themselves." He pauses, looking over Sherlock with a very pointed, direct gaze. "I'm obligated to remind you to measure your doses carefully. Especially if it's been a while since you've used-"
"Mary has also expressed a wish for assistance against Magnussen. Justifiably so- after her first failed attempt, he has drastically increased security, and will be watching for her in particular. I'm uniquely qualified to assist, even if only in the planning stages, so-"
"John, there is presently nothing that I want more than for you to remain my flatmate. The past several years have been the worst of my life precisely because you were not in it. I don't know how to make it any clearer that my happiness appears to be contingent on your continued existence adjacent to mine, given that I started kipping in a drug den the day you got married, but if you want for me to dictate and sign a statement on it do feel free to let me know."
He curled closer around John, one arm wrapped around his stomach and his face pressed to the warmth of John's neck, and began o explain.
But he's taken a step forward.

He can't do it.
"Yes. Please." He sat up an inch straighter, almost seeming to inflate and glow, his face transformed from a kicked puppy to an eager one. "That would be-- much appreciated. Yes."
He writes the last two words, knowing John won't be able to translate the signs for them. Sherlock isn't sure he even knows them himself. But John is immediately upright all the same, joining him in searching out the window. He groans at the sight, but his smile glints with a hard edge of steel.
He is

Ella sat quietly for several moments, letting him talk himself again to a standstill. She glanced at her notes, sliding a thumb up and down her pen, and-- he knew that look. The Concerned Therapist face. The
His face heats up, burning uncomfortably hot even as he buries it back into the tired blanket dragged loosely around his knees. Sherlock digs his fingers into it as well, carefully isolating a single loose thread to spend the rest of his day unraveling.
A box of something is set beside him. Plastic tupperware, by the sound of it. Those chocolate biscuits of hers that he loves, and she makes them for him whenever she can be sure he'll actually eat them.
He bides his time. He makes an appointment. He waits.
John swallows, and reverts his eyes, instead, down to the stubbornly black screen of Sherlock's phone. He is thirty-four years old, has just worked a week of alternating single and double shifts, it is not even nine AM on a Saturday morning, and he wants nothing more in the world than for Sherlock's phone to light up to give him something to do.
Everyone knew that I wasn't special at all, but just the next domino in his ever repeating pattern. Everyone knew. Except me, John." He swallowed hard, and for the very first time, his voice shook. "Victor tried to warn me. I blew him off."
Sherlock is obviously already at the end of his rope. He can not walk that far, John and Greg helping him or not.
While the water comes to a boil, Sherlock goes on a silent hunt for the other items they'll need, for a long bathroom-floor cohabitation. They're almost out of tea. He very briefly considers texting Mycroft, to send his minions on a Tesco's run or at least to bother him in the middle of the night, but instead forces himself to settle for his lab notebook under his arm, John's dressing gown over his shoulder, and one cup of water and one cup of tea in hand.
