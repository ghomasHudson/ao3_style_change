Sam smiles and turns to face Dean. He settles his hands on his lap and Dean knows this will be serious.
He’s driving into the sunset and he can feel the burn. The sun is glaring through the windshield as he presses on the gas even more, and he imagines it swallowing him whole. What would be on the other side?
Dean slams his foot down on the clutch and shifts gear. The gearbox crunches and he presses on the gas before the clutch can scream at him as he raises it. The Impala races forward, dust billowing into the air all around. It’s sunset, and the Impala looks golden, coated in sand and dust and glowing. Dean races towards nothing, the road empty before him and nothing but fields either side.
And by the ‘oh’ Castiel silently says, the way he pulls his eyes from Dean, it seems he does. But the silence lasts a little too long and god, Dean feels like shit.
“It’s okay if you don’t want to go, I can go with Sam,” Castiel offers, failing to understand exactly what Dean’s issue is. If only he knew how dry his mouth had become, how dead he felt inside at the very idea of it. “I want to get back to normal.”
They quietly pick up the remainder of the spell ingredients, including the jacket, and take them to room 7b, because somehow it feels right. They’re not rushing. Everything is eerily calm.
But he remains on the floor, pulling Castiel towards him, running a hand over his face, and hoping beyond anything that tiny shred of grace has saved him.
A breath. Butterflies flying madly in his stomach. And then he remembers that his kid is God now, so he probably already knows. And that’s what confession is, right? Admitting to the things that God already knows and sees so you can clear your record before it’s time to go upstairs?
. The sky streaks blue and black and the moon is so huge, so vast. It seems to pulse as his grace siphons from him, funnels into the abyss.
Dean laughs, tries to break the tension. He’d normally give Sam a big speech, some acknowledgement of how Sam needs to live his life so he’s safe from harm, so he doesn’t suffer the same fate should Dean not return. But he looks at him now, in this post-Chuck world, before this mission that doesn’t really have anything to do with Sam anyway, and he knows he doesn’t need to do it. Sam has Eileen, he has the bunker and a whole host of hunter friends. He’s uniquely skilled in so many different and exciting ways and he has a new determination to live, to enjoy the freedom he fought for. Sammy will be just fine.
Castiel is aware of the balance in Heaven, of the way emotions are weighed and measured. Souls can’t experience euphoria but will also not feel extreme lows. Every soul will find their peace, a harmony in their feelings, and settle into its warmth. Which is why Castiel can’t understand why those very words send shivers through him, leave him ice cold and burning hot, and like he’s ascended to the highest levels. The moon emerges from behind a cloud outside, as if winking through the window, eager and excited. His grace glistens on the surface, almost a taunt but mostly a reminder that he wanted to exist with Dean, and Sam, and their friends. He wanted to be a part of this.
Jack promises to stay for at least a beer before Sam is ready to leave them and Dean is nervous. This isn’t in the script. This isn’t what was promised.
“Who do you think you are?” the Shadow rages, standing above where Dean is slumped to the ground. “Do you think it’s easy, keeping every angel and demon asleep? Do you think it was easy to restore order after your INSUFFERABLE NEPHILIM RUINED IT? And now you stroll on into MY DOMAIN and decide you know better?”
Dean looks around and he can’t see the Shadow anymore. The shapes are moving closer and closer, but the Shadow has bailed.
It takes another three days of poring over encyclopaedias, articles, research logs, journals, and Sam hunting, before they finally get a nudge in the right direction.
Dean grabs at his wrist and pulls him closer, doesn’t hesitate. His arms wrap behind Castiel’s back, the kiss deepening every second. Castiel responds, a hand on Dean’s neck and the other on his waist and he wonders if Heaven has ever seen an act so holy. The fire calms down, his grace completely burned, but Dean catches him before he falls.
It always starts the same – hi, how are you, I miss you, thank you – and it always ends the same – he’s lost, he won’t forgive himself, he needs this, please help us.
The end of the road arrives quicker than Castiel expects, on account of no such thing existing in this version of Heaven. To the side of the road sits a motel, ivy crawling the outside walls, rust settling into the staircases and railings, water damage staining the doors. The sign blinks above them as Dean pulls the car in and cuts the engine.
Dean can’t help but feel nervous. Because what if this doesn’t work? Has he really rallied all these people, who seemingly care for him and love him, to potentially fail?
Save for Crowley, Dean hasn’t ever seen a demon try to possess an angel. Or rather, he’s never seen a demon burn from the inside out by the sheer will of the grace held inside an angel bursting to the surface. The demon doesn’t burst out into smoke or try to run away. It can’t. Dean feels the grip around his neck loosen and the hand on his shoulder drop completely.
Dean just nods. He doesn’t look at Castiel. He just glances around the room one more time and heads for the stairs. Castiel follows, regretting again, just for a moment, that he dealt his grace away.
“I am going to do this spell for you,” he says, stopping Dean from interrupting when he tries. “For Cas, too. You deserve someone that understands you too and god, Dean, it’s so typical of you that he’s stuck in some cosmic realm we stand barely a chance of getting into, but we’re going to try, okay?”
His eyes zero in on Castiel’s mouth, because fuck… he just can’t help it. And Castiel nearly died today.
"I'm so sorry, Dean," he tries for sympathy, and finally presses two fingers to Dean's forehead to try and make it better. But he can’t. Instead, he's overcome by calm and ease, and as he moves gently to lean against the car, Dean's hands rush to hold him. "You seem happy."
“Naomi, please,” he tries again, running his hand through his hair and using the other to brace himself against the edge of his bed. “I don’t think either of us thought this day would come but I’m praying to you. Please, if you can hear me, I just want to talk. I need to ask you something.”
Castiel finally nods in agreement, but not before pulling Dean into a hug that almost knocks the air from his lungs and drops his heart into his stomach. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel as tightly as he’s being held and it’s awkward because they’re both still on the floor, but Dean doesn’t know how he’s ever going to let go.
Dean wakes with a start as soon as he starts to sleep. A glance at the clock tells him it’s 2am and he knows he heard something. He heard something fall.
Castiel is too close. Dean was happy with the table between them, with pacing while Castiel sat. But now Castiel is right in front of him, he can almost feel his breath on his own face and it’s all just too much.
“Stay,” he whispers to Miracle as he stands from the bed, gun and demon blade tucked into his waistband.
It’s a week later and Dean is in a damp, abandoned warehouse in Minnesota staring at Castiel, his eyes pitch black, and a smirk contorting his face unnaturally. He has Donna by her neck next to him and he’s taunting Dean.
As Castiel moves closer, the fire roars and the flames lick higher. He steps into Dean’s space, desperate to reach out and touch him, to press his fingers to him and lightly press his grace into his skin, to calm him, soothe him. Give him some peace.
Miracle wakes and lifts his head with a slight grumble. Under his paw sits Castiel’s handprint, bloody and stained, but still so clear.
“Is this what you wanted, Dean?” Castiel asks, smiling next to him, utterly unfazed by the sensation or the appeal.
He wants to cry, feels the urge building from his chest and prickling at his eyes, but he swallows it down, and with one look at Castiel’s utterly bewildered face, he laughs and laughs and laughs. Sam in the corner, by the shelves, relieved and astonished, unharmed. Dean turns to Castiel, grinning, elated.
His other hand is caressing Castiel’s hip, which is pressed hard into Dean’s body, fingertips grazing his waistband, but suddenly he feels like a schoolboy, like a teenager with his first crush. He can feel it all the way down to his toes and he wants nothing more than to press back into Castiel, to keep pressing, moving, colliding until he feels nothing but relief. Until he feels Castiel breathe, relax, fall into him…
And yet the euphoria he was sure to feel is bittered by the loss of Jack, the temporary loss of all they loved, and the overwhelming loss of Castiel.
“His permission to be happy was to get away from you. He told you a wonderful story, but I see into his mind, into every part of his infinite brain, and what was it that he really wanted? To leave you.”
“Well,” Dean uses his spare hand to drink a large mouthful of whiskey. Castiel is jovial, in a sense, but the thought unnerves him. For as much as he knows this is light-hearted, that Castiel has found his sense-of-humour over the years, the fact remains that if he had never spoken, he would never have been happy. It sits heavy in Dean’s heart, confusing the situation. He just doesn’t know what to do with that. Either way, the existence of this deal required Castiel to make a huge sacrifice, and both options were because of Dean. So, he can only offer him a small morsel, something that is absolutely diminished in the face of Castiel’s determination to do right by Dean but… he just can’t give any more without cracking himself open and bleeding onto the table before him. “It doesn’t make me uncomfortable.”
There’s an internal thread of thought that Dean is trying to push down, that desperately wants to answer the question. It starts with John Winchester and ends somewhere in the general attitude of the world, of the image Dean has worked hard to cultivate, but he doesn’t want to listen anymore.
He grabs him by the shoulder and shakes him a little, and it earns him a groggy half-smile and a hand gripping at his own. “I’ll live,” Castiel jokes and accepts Dean’s help to stand. Dean turns to check Sam is okay and finds him standing but limping.
“I’ve been in worse situations before,” Castiel tries to reason, and he’s right. Dean knows he is. He has seen him deal with worse and who knows what he was getting up to when he was away from the bunker.
He quickly changes into the clothes he took off earlier and grabs his gun and the demon blade again.
, he thinks, as the headlights flood him and drown him. He can only imagine how godly he looks in this minute - aflame, gracious, celestial. But it doesn't intimidate the person stepping out of the car, leaning on the driver side door as it hangs open and grinning, slightly lopsided.
“It didn’t work because Castiel is asleep. He can’t walk out because he’s probably asleep,” Sam explains, as though it’s really that simple but like a man driven mad by it. “It’s a spell designed for him to get out, not for you to go in. But I’ve figured it out. I can get you in.”
But whatever grace Castiel had managed to pull together to heal Dean in the Empty has depleted, so now he sleeps. He settles back into his bland, vacant room, so devoid of personal effects, and promptly collapses into the bed. He doesn’t wake for at least twelve hours, at first.
“I’m going to rip you limb from limb and I’m going to make him remember. I’m going to make sure the only face you see as you die is his. And then I’m going to laugh so fucking hard.”
That Dean did apply for jobs and has attended a couple of interviews, that he does occasionally fix up the locals’ cars for cash-in-hand while Sam and Eileen chase packs of werewolves out of town three states away, while Castiel updates the bunker’s records on heaven and angels and fuck, the Empty. He archives Nick’s spell with Sam’s amendments, and leaves a vial of his own blood with it… just in case.
“What?” he asks, as eloquently as he can manage, tipping his glass to Jack’s in an absurd celebration of the impossible.
Dean collapses back on his bed, hands under his head, smirk permanently painted onto his face. “Really? Mr ‘Dean-is-the-best-person-in-the-whole-world-and-I-want-him-so-badly’ thinks he’s funny now?”
Dean feels sick, he feels cold, he feels itchy, he feels utterly undone. He’s being unmade in this hollow room in this empty bunker before his baby brother and there’s nothing he can do about it. Because Sammy knows what Dean has been refusing to acknowledge and he’s just said it, just laid it out on the table in huge letters for anyone that needs to see it, and god Dean needs to see it.
“Oh boy,” Donna laughs, mostly with relief. Dean can see the strain in her eyes, the fear. “That was a close one! Good to have you back, Castiel.”
“This man says he’s been experiencing blackouts for days at a time and the allegations against him,” Sam laughs a little. “Orgies, excessive drinking, bar fights, murder in dark alleys, and an altar behind the church with blood all over it.”
He puts the 'your type' in air-quotes with a slight smile and Dean thinks he might lose his mind. Because how does he know? How can he be so sure? The part of him that has been holding this back, for as long as he can remember, knows it would be so much easier if Castiel could just speak plainly and out loud and put it into the world before Dean gets a chance to, before he can muster up the words.
He’s trying to fill it up with beer and scotch and occasional nights swimming in tears, but nothing satisfies it.
Dean’s brain is working like a switch in his brain has gone off and with permission to let his gaze wander, linger, and thoughts invade, he’s noticing
“That was pretty rough today,” Dean observes after a moment of silence. The whiskey runs down his throat, gently warming the cold that had not left since he saw Castiel dying against that wall.
. Dean gives a tiny nod, mouth open, gaping, before reaching for Castiel’s face and pulling him closer, his lips meeting Castiel’s again, quickly and crushing and it feels like nothing he’s ever felt before. Castiel grips onto Dean’s sleeve so tight Dean wonders if he might rip the fabric. But it’s the ease at which this is happening that trips Dean’s mind the most. He doesn’t care that Castiel is an angel, a man, anything, really. He just cares that he loves him and wants him. Years of torturing himself boil down to this simple moment, this simple revelation, and it feels like the biggest win in the world.
With a blink, he’s in the car and they’re racing towards infinity. Castiel doesn’t know what they’re looking for. He doesn’t know what Dean wants to find. Every leaf, every road, every falling flower in the breeze, every splinter of wood in the Roadhouse, poured from Castiel. But Dean remains the only person he knows as well as himself, and a mystery at the same time.
Castiel is standing before him, head slightly tilted, vampire blood all over his trenchcoat and t-shirt, hair falling all over the place and stubble a few days old smattered across his slightly perturbed face. “Dean?” he asks when Dean can’t look away. It’s embarrassing, really.
“Not quite,” Castiel smiles, wryly, but he’s mostly nervous. “I might not have had much leverage, but I did manage to get one thing for myself. My negotiating skills haven’t completely dried up.”
He doesn’t glance in the rear-view mirror, he doesn’t reverse, he keeps on. Hands on the steering wheel, foot on the gas, faster and faster and faster…
“I’m going to bed,” Sam announces with a yawn when they return, while Dean leads Castiel to the library and pours them both a drink.
He wonders what would happen if Famine rolled into town now. Would it be true this time? That’s he’s empty inside? Or would the craving for something he can barely understand consume him until he flings himself into
“Jack restored my grace and my wings when he pulled me out of the Empty, gave me a promotion. Gave me everything I needed to make this Heaven perfect, to make it in whatever vision I saw fit, and then when the time comes… I become like you.”
And even later than that, Miracle will join Dean as he drives to a bridge on the very edge of Heaven and brings his brother home.
It feels like an age between the vamp grabbing him and Castiel’s calm request but in reality, it is seconds. And in the next he’s covered in vamp blood, but the hold on him is gone. Castiel stands to the side with a shotgun in his hand, still hot from the accurate shot that has blown the head clean off of the vampire in question, the one that was about to kill Dean. Sam has seen off his own vamp, but it doesn’t matter. Dean hears some quiet praise from Sam, from somewhere behind him, telling Castiel he did a good job, but the words feel hollow. They’re not good enough.
Dean’s not looking but he can feel Sam studying him. The room feels hollow and quiet. Nothing but Dean and Sam, Sam and Dean. And it’s wrong. Maybe ten years ago Dean could have only dreamt of this, but now? Without the family they built? It makes him feel sick and it makes him feel nothing.
“Cas is my friend, he’s your best friend,” Sam explains, his tone more casual than his body is suggesting. “We’ve done worse for less.”
Dean doesn’t know any other life right now. He has job applications waiting to be filled on his desk, beds that need to be made, laundry that needs to be put away. But it all seems so tiny, so insignificant, in the face of his real purpose.
“This is about bringing Cas back, right?” Sam starts, slowly. But Dean’s not an idiot. “We’ve lost countless people we couldn’t bring back. We clean up, we move on. Charlie, mom, dad, Rowena… you just can’t do it when it’s him.”
“Can you-” Dean stops. Breathes. “He made a deal to save Jack and we all know how well those work out for us. That’s all it is.”
Dean floors the gas pedal and tears from the bunker faster and angrier than he needs to. He doesn’t stop until he can’t see the bunker in the rearview mirror anymore, like all his feelings and thoughts are held up in their little fortress. If he just drives fast enough and far enough, maybe they’ll go away, just vanish in the distance as the bunker slides from view.
Sam starts hunting with Eileen full-time and Dean spends his days in the Dean Cave – bad television, cartoons, drinking beer, replenishing the beer, cheap snacks, occasional porn, bad television… and so on. But none of it helps. None of it satisfies the need to stop hunting, nothing vindicates the feeling that none of it is worth it anymore.
There's an angel walking in the middle of the road, draped in a trenchcoat and suited with a sensible tie. He's surrounded by trees stretching to the stars, mountains and shadows. He's lost and he's looking for something, but he doesn't know what.
He still can’t see anyone. He only sees Castiel, arm resting out the open window, watching the sun set before them without a care in the world, his other hand in Miracle’s fur soothing him.
“Sorry, baby,” he grumbles, pushing faster, but giving the steering wheel a gentle sweep. A small gesture of comfort.
Donna is fumbling around her belt and as quick as a flash, Dean sees a small vial of holy water in her hands.
“I’m asking Eileen to move in,” Sam says, and then hurriedly: “Properly. Not like whatever she’s been doing until now.”
Dean nods, considers his move. But he doesn’t have one. He has never known anything about the Shadow or the Empty. He never pushed Castiel to talk about it and only picked up glimpses from what he would say and… it’s going to kill him.
He sees Sam shaking his head, resting his face in the palms of his hands, elbows on the table, but he won’t back down.
They’re silent for a moment. Dean can see a thousand more questions written all over Claire’s face, but he knows he has no answers. None that he’s ready to talk about, anyway. And she knows it too.
And finally, Castiel does relax. His shoulders loosen and as he rolls his eyes, his neck loses its tension. “A thousand?” he questions.
"If you don't want it anymore," Dean takes a deep breath. "Then same deal: no expectations, nothing has to change. You’re still family, to me. To Sam."
And then: foot hitting the brakes, clutch into the floor, gear shift, full lock steering, and finally… gas, gas, gas.
“I never wanted to make you feel uncomfortable, Dean,” Castiel rushes to clarify, placing his other hand on top of theirs, still together. “And we don’t have to talk about it. I never intended to ever have to say anything, but it was the only way to keep you safe in that moment.”
It’s one failure after another. One dead end followed by another failed lead followed by the next snarky angel or demon
Sam is in the library, scribbling quickly onto a scrap of paper with at least six books open in front of him and a plethora of plants and ingredients scattered around.
The next day he finds Sam praying in Jack’s room. Dean hesitates before knocking on the doorframe. Part of him wants to run away before Sam sees him, but another part is curious – what does his brother pray to their three-year old deity about?
And that… that’s fair. And Dean can’t argue. And he can’t swallow down the sudden hit of guilt, because he tries not to think about that time, tries not to dwell on being taken in by Gadreel, leaving Castiel out in the cold. Because he doesn’t know how Castiel can even stand to look at him, let alone look him in the eye and tell him he’s the most loving, caring, selfless person he’s ever known.
The thrill of Castiel flirting is still novel and Dean delights in it. He lifts himself from the bed with ease, practically floats to Castiel before pushing him against the door and pressing the gentlest of kisses to his lips, hands resting on Castiel’s waist, pushing his shirt up ever so slightly in their race to touch his skin. “That’s the first.”
Which means a vamp gets him in a hold, gripping him by his head and trying to bend his neck just so. Dean is struggling, flailing with his blade, trying to get a hit but he’s overwhelmed. He glances at Sam who is fending off his own opponent and he can’t even see Castiel anymore. He’s going to get his throat ripped out. He’s going to bleed out into this vampire’s mouth and he’s going to die here.
“I guess angel mojo ain’t all it’s cracked up to be after all,” Dean tries to joke but it falls flat. Castiel just looks at him.
Because it’s still hard to say. He still fears the Empty if he so much as allows himself to even think of all the ways Dean Winchester has imprinted on his life and changed his very being. He still fears the rejection he was so sure Dean would deliver without hesitation.
Dean wonders if this couldn’t have been resolved in the moment had they more time. Perhaps the deal could have been broken, an agreement met before it had to result in anyone dying. Because Castiel’s personality, friendship, and his body, is all that Dean ever wanted. They were the most important things in the world when Dean was screaming his lungs out and fighting back against every push, pull, ache and break.
Jody and the girls leave the next morning, Claire clinging to Castiel longer than she’d ever admit as they hug and say goodbye, as Dean provides an endless supply of
“Well, I think he’s great,” Castiel says in a voice Dean has never heard before, as he leans down and speaks directly into Miracle’s fur. Castiel is rewarded with Miracle nuzzling him right back for a moment and Dean… “Looking after a dog will seem simple after an archangel’s Nephilim.”
Dean is referring to the unmade bed. The duvet bundled at the bottom of the bed. The robe, hastily thrown on top of the bed. The crinkles in the pillows. The
"Hey," Sam calls over as he strolls in, yawning, and Castiel courteously takes a step back. "Jody just called. She's got a werewolf pack that's bigger than she thought and needs a hand. You guys want in? We can leave in the morning."
"I don't know how to talk about this... this part of me," Dean says. It's tearing him apart. "I don't want to say the wrong thing, but I want to say it to you, whatever it is... fuck, I'm not making any sense."
He knows somewhere a tree has fallen to Dean’s will, perhaps a storm cloud forming on the horizon. But he can’t
And with that, Castiel takes his leave. He spins on his heel and moves down the stairs and he’s done. Crisis averted. The moon is rising outside, as if peeking through the window, as if observing and Castiel wants to close the curtains more than anything. He doesn’t want to be seen.
“Yes,” she agrees. “And then your Nephilim arrived and decided I was more useful elsewhere. I happened to agree.”
“It’s kind of stupid,” Sam says into the silence. “But I feel like he might hear me a little clearer if I’m in here.”
Dean acknowledges in his mind how this looks, how it makes him feel. That nothing much had to change to step into this new, romantic territory tells him that he’s been with Castiel for years. That Sam hasn’t commented or noted any difference in them tells him it’s definitely been obvious for years.
But as they make it through, Dean watches the black tendrils synonymous with the Empty and the Shadow knit themselves back together and vanish into thin air, as if it had never been there at all.
He presses the gas harder as the beach comes into view. The suitcases on the backseat rattle as they shake but Dean is calm. Dust flies up from the wheels as they keep turning and Dean keeps a steady foot on the pedal.
Dean cooks breakfast in the mornings, and Castiel runs his hand over Dean’s back as he walks past. Dean says goodnight to Castiel in the evenings, and Castiel holds his hand just a little as they part. Castiel’s hand rests atop Dean’s shoulder when he stands in the library discussing possible cases in the library, his foot grazes his under the table where Sam isn’t looking, hugging him close, hands in Dean’s hair and on the small of his back when he returns home safely. He’s always touching, touching, touching and it seems as though that’s enough.
He knows Castiel likes to be told he’s part of Dean’s family, he’s not blind. But for the first time, it doesn’t ring as true as it used to. Dean recounts the times he has told people he cares for them, loves them, by way of telling them they’re family and it just doesn’t work for Castiel anymore. When he says it now to Castiel, it feels too small. He feels nervous all of a sudden, uncomfortable even.
Dean can only bring himself to laugh a little. If he doesn’t laugh, he’s sure he won’t hold himself together.
can,” Jack raises his glass to a toast, failing to understand toasting etiquette but seeming to understand Dean perfectly. Because that is exactly what he would raise a glass to. That’s exactly what he needs to be celebrating.
Three days ago, Dean defeated Chuck. Defeated God. Left him in tatters, just a man, on the floor begging to die.
“No!” Dean responds, strained. “Bobby mentioned you were around, and I just left. I just drove away from the bar and didn’t stop until I found you and… Cas. What did she say?”
Dean finally notices the ‘documentary’ is some sort of dog whisperer show and takes in Castiel’s hand in Miracle’s fur, gently fussing. And Castiel notices him.
“One of the scanners picked up recent angel activity in the bunker,” Sam says slowly, cautiously. “Do you know what that’s about?”
“I’m sure he’d find the time if you needed it,” Sam says, with that look on his face. The one Dean hates. The one that says he knows exactly what Dean is doing, and it’s not going to fly with him. “It’s been a few days now.”
“Only if we won,” Castiel points out. He wants to soothe Dean, run his fingers through his hair and sprinkle grace through every strand until he is relaxed and peaceful and eternal. But he can’t. He feels the itch on his back, the imaginary thumping in his chest, the warmth from Dean’s legs as he presses his toes to them… this is real, and this is reality. And it cannot be changed. And Castiel isn’t sure if he’d try.
“Sure I am,” he tries not to sneer but it’s near impossible. “Look at paradise, Jack. Look at it. Who needs you or Cas or my mom or anyone, really? Just me, Sammy and the damn dog. Life is perfect.”
“Eileen and I have been looking into restoring the bunker without needing magic,” Sam announces over dinner one day, half signing what he can for Eileen’s benefit.
But whether Castiel is looking right at him or pointedly looking away, it remains a simple fact of the universe that he does love him, and he wants him, and he would do anything for him.
“‘Whatever she’s been doing’ meaning staying here five nights a week and spending the other two days a week in the library nerding out with you?”
). “This is Heaven, Dean. Eternity. You shouldn’t spend it in a motel, and you shouldn’t be hidden away in a bunker.”
“Then let’s go,” Castiel says, nonplussed, inviting himself along without being asked. It feels like an improvement and Dean wants to savour it.
“Do you think we should help?” Castiel asks, bringing Dean a coffee from the coffee machine Eileen helpfully donated to the bunker. Dean takes the mug, careful not to scald himself and tilts his head up at Castiel from where he sits on the end of the library table, watching Sam’s gentle chaos unfold. Castiel obliges and offers a quick kiss before rolling his eyes. “Bringing you coffee should have been a perk by itself.”
“I have a house,” Castiel blurts out, throwing one last disgusted look at the motel before turning back to Dean. “For you. I have a house for you.”
“What are you talking about?” Dean asks, irritated. “We need to go, Cas! I need your help, come on!”
“I know Sam prays to you sometimes and I know he’s worried but I’ve gotta be honest with you, buddy, this isn’t the paradise I thought we were getting. Doesn’t really look like the brochure. I mean it’s perfect because Chuck is… wherever Chuck is, but.”
Dean feels the moment like a hand gripped tight on his heart, squeezing him to death. He tries to breathe but all he can see is Castiel’s eyes closing, slowly. All he can do is watch as Castiel extends an arm, just slightly, in his direction. His hand is stretched, like he wants someone to hold it. But Dean can’t do that. He can barely move. He just got him back and now…
And so, with a heavy sigh, a full hip flask and a trunk full of clean and ready weapons, Dean drags himself to another vampire nest, another pack of werewolves, another vengeful spirit, another, another, another… Sam is thriving, Dean is wilting, the monsters keep on dying. They have absolutely no leads on how to get to the Empty. And so, everything
Castiel's heart sings, and his soul vibrates, and when he closes his eyes for a second he knows that they are finally at peace.
The smashed bottle has been cleaned but Dean carries Miracle from the room, just in case he hurts his paws, and dumps him unceremoniously onto his bed. He doesn’t want to be alone and if the best he can hope for is a warm, lazy cuddle with the last dog in the world, then he’ll take it.
“We haven’t seen a demon in months, I thought Rowena had them on a tight leash down there?” Sam thinks aloud.
Miracle jumps back onto the bed and nestles under Dean’s chin, nuzzling into his chest, but Dean finds no comfort in it.
“Cas,” he prays, holding onto Miracle with a trembling hand. “I don’t think you can hear me where you are, but I hope you can, I really hope you can.”
Dean looks around now, from where the Empty knocked his ass to the floor after his third attempt at walking through, and he sees the pity in Sam’s eyes, the unshed tears in Donna’s, the defeat in Claire’s. Jody is crouching next to him, hand on his shoulder, and telling him how sorry she is. That they can try again. That they all just need a break and then they can figure it out.
“What?” she taunts. “What are you doing to do? Got an angel blade tucked under your pillow? Or are you going to set your dog on me?”
But here, in this utopia of Dean’s own devising, toes in the sand and basking in the heat of a summer sunset, Dean kisses Castiel back and holds him as tight as he can. As they separate, Dean kisses Castiel’s temple and holds him as they watch the sea go out, arms around his shoulders, Castiel’s arm around his waist, and the sun moving lower and lower and lower.
“I got a dog,” Dean’s smile drops slightly. “His name is Miracle. Think he’ll find his way up here?”
“You’re right,” Dean concedes with a sigh. Castiel reaches out to run his fingers through the hair at Dean’s temple anyway, just lightly enough to coax his head up. “You’re always right.”
“Do you think his grace will come back?” he asks over the burgers Dean has made up for lunch a couple of days later. Sam hasn’t spoken about a hunt since Castiel returned and they’ve fallen into a temporary routine – three meals a day, coffee pot always on, even a cleaning schedule. Having Castiel back has shifted them into a temporary new way of living.
“You wanted to just sit in your car?” Castiel squints and turns a little in his seat as though it will help him understand.
Dean's breath hitches and Castiel feels the sway of the trees in the breeze. He feels the cooling air through his feathers and across his face and he stands, away from Dean’s hold. Away from the car. Away from the utter devastation that sits shattered in the very core of him.
“Dean,” Castiel says, and he means business. He’s not taking this crap and god, Dean knows he deserves it. But if this is the price he’s going to pay to try and keep him safe? He’ll take it. “Are you suggesting that without my grace I can’t offer anything of use?”
“Naomi, please,” he’s aware of how much it sounds like he’s begging, but he won’t. Not even for this. Not to an angel. Not to
“He was Jack before he was god,” Dean says, with an air of acceptance. “I figure he’s still in there somewhere. He helped us get Cas back.”
Sam’s incantation was correct, the scrap of the jacket added to the bowl opened the portal, and the black tendrils wrapping around the portal entrance sat in the middle of the library, taunting Dean. Torturing him with the images he hasn’t been able to get out of his head.
Startled, somewhat, Castiel prickles. Because he’s already said what he had to say. And Dean still hasn’t said
“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” Sam says. “Do you think I should ask or just clear a drawer for her and give her a key?”
The demon’s black eyes flicker offering glimpses of Castiel’s blue underneath. Dean doesn’t know if he’s hallucinating through lack of oxygen or if it’s some kind of miracle, but he can see a faint glow in them. He knows that glow. He’s missed that glow, been longing to see it again.
The trashcans are overflowing, and the scent of day-old cleaning products lingers in the air. The floodlight illuminating the parking lot flickers to life but as Castiel steps outside of the Impala to just breathe, Dean by his side, the light finally dies. He feels Heaven leave him and now he’s truly lost. His arrangement is complete.
“I made some of it,” Castiel admits, cautiously. Dean’s eyebrow raises and Castiel’s soul, gently forming within, moves with it. His grace is moving fast and loose within this realm, leaking into every crack and crevice and it’s simply impossible to have manifested such a creation alone. But Dean doesn’t believe him. And Castiel
“I wish I had time to tell you what you needed, deserved to hear. I don’t know why I couldn’t say anything but god, Cas,” Dean struggles, and sighs. “I don’t want paradise if you don’t get to be in it too. You fought for this and believed in this so you should be here, with us.”
"Cas," Dean inhales, deeply, but the smile never really leaves his face. "Get in, let’s go for a drive.”
“Wait… Mary? You’ve seen my mom?” His voice is softer now and Castiel wonders if the thrill he feels from his middle, if the slight edge on his nerves will ever stop when Dean speaks to him like this.
“It is,” Sam agrees with a gentle laugh. “I want to make sure the choices I make include her. I don’t want to plan my future without her being in it.”
Dean feels the weight sitting heavy on his chest ease with every passing minute and as he closes the trunk and Sam pats him on the back, it vanishes completely.
“After we lost Jack and Mary, and had to deal with Chuck? After entire universes started collapsing and you wouldn’t even look at me, let alone speak to me?” Castiel sighs. “I vowed a long time ago not to add any unnecessary burden to your life, Dean. I always intended to honour that.”
Just as the demon adopts Castiel’s odd head tilt, Donna empties the vial onto the demon’s hand around her neck and breaks free as the skin burns. She runs to Sam, but the demon doesn’t care. It advances on Dean as Sam throws more holy water to deter it. Dean keeps moving backwards, makes sure the demon follows him, and eventually they land exactly where they need to be... if the universe was playing fair, anyway.
The end of the point is hanging in the air, unsaid, but Dean feels it as his heart beats faster, as his breathing becomes slightly more laboured. As his fist clenches and he simply says nothing.
He gestures between them. The Righteous Man and a fallen angel sitting in the front seat of the Impala, outside of a motel Castiel can barely remember manifesting. And Castiel just doesn’t understand.
“I do want you, though,” Castiel says quietly, leaning down to press a soft kiss to Dean’s shoulder, his neck, his cheek, and then finally, a bruising, desperate kiss to Dean’s mouth as he removes his hand, barely allowing him to catch his breath.
“You made all this?” Dean asks, after a year or two passes on Earth. He’s gesturing at the motel, at the sign, at the authentic run-down American road-trip experience. And yet he means the very fabric of this realm, this cosmic place.
He swipes at the bowl full of ingredients angrily, tipping the flaming contents across the floor and watches with a sick satisfaction as the portal closes and yet another lead dries up.
“Dammit, Cas,” he says, gritting his teeth, trying to pray. “Where the fuck are you? Why aren’t you here?”
Over and over until he wonders if he even has vocal cords left. The Shadow keeps kicking him, hitting him, pushing him, but he’s waking the Empty up. He’s disrupting everything. The humanoid shapes are getting closer, multiplying by the minute. Dean’s body is broken but he only came here to do one thing, so he’s going to do it.
“I thought you could be happy knowing your life was yours, but I think I understand now that you need to share it,” Jack smiles, and he just says it. He just puts it right out there with no qualms while Dean feels like Jack’s hands are wrapped around his neck. “What happened to Castiel wasn’t right and I think I know now that this wrong needs to be righted before you can move on.”
Castiel is standing on the dock at the lake, looking out over the water next to deck chairs set out for two. There are fallen trees around the lake edge and empty bottles of beer scattered in front of him. His trench coat rests on the back of a chair and Dean’s footsteps are loud and clear behind him. Dean drops his head on Castiel’s shoulder and presses quiet kisses into it, arms wrapped around Castiel from behind.
“He was my friend too, Dean,” Sam is gentle in his tone, but Dean hears the demand to just stop fucking around. It wouldn’t get to him so much, but Sam asked last week over a nightcap and tried to ask when they first defeated Chuck.
"Yeah," Dean shakes his head with a smile and finally the embarrassment hits. He hides his face in his hands until he feels Castiel's hands over his, gripping them and pulling them down just enough so he can see Dean's face. He's a lot closer than he was a minute ago. Dean didn’t notice Miracle being dumped on Dean’s chair, or Castiel making his way towards him. Dean can see the blue of his eyes so clearly and in Castiel's happiness, they're vibrant.
“Let’s clean this mess up and go home,” Dean announces to the room, stepping out of the tiny space still left between Castiel and himself. He doesn’t look at Sam, but he can hear the barely stifled chuckling, he can see the grin from the corner of his eye as they pick up their weapons, and he hears the contented sigh when Castiel leads them from the room, back to the Impala. And it feels okay. And it feels good.
“To bring him back,” Jack takes a seat now. He’s sitting where Castiel sat when Dean toasted to him being right, about Jack. And he looks just like him – tan coat, blue jeans, his face. He’s every inch Castiel’s child and for a second, Dean can’t breathe.
Castiel stays silent, but Dean can tell he's no longer at peace with what he thought he knew. That once, Dean would have had to have explained the intricacies and complications of romantic love and relationships, but he can see now just how human Castiel has become. He can see how much he's allowed himself to feel, how much he has let in. Dean lets himself acknowledge for the first time that Castiel will understand him, will hear him. And that's terrifying but exhilarating.
“Fine,” Dean says, but he’s hitting a tone he instantly regrets. He didn’t come here to get angry. He didn’t come to start a fight. “But we dealt with that. Why didn’t you say anything after that?”
“Jack has given me a way into the Empty,” Dean says into his bottle of beer, sitting in the kitchen while Sam clears away the empty bottles. Sam turns around with a start.
“Were you expecting someone else?” she tries for humour but as with most angels, it falls flat. “You said you needed to ask me something?”
Another minute passes, that feels like an hour, before Castiel inhales sharply and clings to Dean’s jacket lapels from his awkward position lying across Dean’s lap, on a cold warehouse floor in Minnesota.
“I know,” Dean mumbles, ceasing his onslaught of affection to rest back on his own pillow and watch Castiel, intensely.
“Got it,” they continue to laugh. “The Shadow would consume you as soon as you arrived, why bother? I’m just looking out for you, buddy.”
He stands in the Heaven he created to wrap a blanket around Dean, and the soul carved from his grace hums peacefully, happily, and finally. He takes in the scent of earth and spice and day-old beer, of peppermint and slightly dirty clothes.
“You heard me.” Sam sticks to his guns, refuses to move. He straightens up where he stands and looks Dean in the eyes and… Dean feels so
“Right now? I want to go to the beach,” he says, quietly. “I don’t want to only see the ugly parts of the world anymore.”
Later, Miracle will join them on the dock while they empty bottles of beer and watch the day turn to night turn to day then back to night in no time at all.
Although Castiel still isn’t really listening to him, but Dean’s not sure he’s even articulating what needs to be heard.
Sam fixes him with a look, half a raised eyebrow and the beginnings of a smirk, but it softens with a gentle nod, an “Okay,” and a stack of books almost as tall as Dean himself.
Sam shrugs his shoulders and thankfully, Jack laughs. It’s good that he laughs because Dean’s mind has come back to itself and he’s going a mile a minute wondering why Jack is here. Why is Jack, the new God, stood before them? Why has he finally answered their prayers after weeks of nothing? He can’t help it, he’s not ready to embrace a life where he doesn’t have to worry about cosmic consequences, but he holds his head high and prepares to hear whatever cosmic disaster awaits. Because this isn’t paradise. There’s no way it can be.
Within seconds, Castiel is on the bed, straddling Dean’s lap with his hand over Dean’s mouth to shut him up. And Dean is still smiling. “That’s not quite what I said, is it Dean?”
Castiel’s prayer is answered by thunder and a freak downpour he hadn’t seen in Heaven before. Dean runs for shelter, but Castiel stands a minute in the mud. He feels his feet start to sink a little as raindrops fall into his eyes, matting his hair to his forehead. But it’s only when Dean turns back from the comfort of the porch, with a curious glance, that he can force his legs to move.
“Yeah, and you’re right for that too,” Dean grins, tugging Castiel into a kiss a little more bruising this time. They kick the sheets back up and it takes another few sunsets before they contemplate moving again.
“But you’re not normal, are you?” Dean’s tone wasn’t what he intended, and he regrets his words as soon as he says them, but the point stands. He’s not going to take it back now, no matter how much the hurt look Castiel throws his way makes him squirm. “You’re all out of angel juice! What are you going to do if this thing comes for you?”
It’s when Dean glances into the master bedroom, clears his throat and throws a look back to Castiel standing on the landing, that he really feels it.
“Well then get out of my way,” Dean smirks. He wants to fight but he isn’t sure which weapon to choose – the angel blade stashed in his belt, the archangel blade he remembered at the last minute, the demon blade, or just his hands. The Shadow waves its hand and throws Dean to the floor with no effort at all.
Dean laughs a little and shrugs. “Nothing much. Just little things, like when I think about how much he’d love Miracle or when I find a cool new TV show that I know he’d spend an entire weekend watching.”
He smells the rubber burning and glances at the tyre tracks left in the road from the rear-view mirror.
“I shouldn’t have let the Empty take you,” Dean groans, turning his face into the pillow. “I thought about it so much after you were gone, all the things I should have done. I’m so sorry, Cas.”
The air changes as the sun begins to rise. Shadows from the tall sequoias draw lines in the road. Castiel walks right over them. Heaven can't have him now. He was only ever on loan.
Dean is sleepwalking through this life that was supposed to be a gift, that was supposed to have been won. But for the first time in weeks, he can feel his soul gently stirring, waking. He’s ready to consider a way, consider their options. And then, utterly betrayed by his own mind, he thinks of Castiel in the Empty. Awake, probably. Alone, definitely. Reliving his worst memories, all of them Dean. And Dean is suddenly incensed.
So, Sam joins in with the spells. He tries to speak to Rowena, with no luck. He visits her apartment, with even less luck.
“I can’t do this anymore, Sammy,” he says, dejected. “Hunting, demons, angels, all of it. I don’t want it.”
Dean is looking at this angel and his dog and they’ve both got his heart in a grip so tight it’s taken his breath away. He thinks of Jack, of his wish for Dean to feel at peace and live his life without pain, without chasing the impossible constantly. Without assuming his life began with a gun in his hand and will end with a blade through his chest. And fuck, this is it. He’s looking at this angel, and his dog, sitting in a recliner in Dean’s perfectly curated room watching shitty dog programmes and drinking crap beer. He allows himself just a moment to indulge, to think ahead, and he can feel that blade being removed from his chest. He can see his ending rewriting itself and… he kind of wants it. Really, really bad.
, but the only thing Dean can see is his best friend paraded around by a creature so abhorrent to Castiel. There isn’t any justice.
With his head rested on top of the steering wheel, Dean sends another silent apology to the car and finally exhales.
As they pull up the driveway and move slowly towards the edge of the lake, Castiel sends a silent wish to Jack or Amara that they extend him one small kindness. That they gift him enough grace to lose the evidence.
Dean tests the waters and finds that his leg is now okay to walk on. So, he does the only thing he can think to do – he grabs Castiel’s hand and they run to the light, to the glimpses of the bunker up ahead. He’s aware of the other demons and angels, not yet fully formed, trying to chase after them, trying to force their way to freedom.
“That’s not what Bobby says,” Dean twirls his car keys around his index finger, amusement across his face.
As Castiel pulls away from the kiss, his hand travels down Dean’s body leaving goosebumps in its wake, settling between them as Castiel palms Dean through his pyjama pants and Dean’s hips buck to meet him.
The realisation washes over Dean instantly. It wraps him up and holds him tight. He can barely see, he can barely understand. Why is he interrogating demons and shredding books looking for spells that don’t exist?
“It’s okay,” Dean huffs. “This is heaven, right? I can’t go anywhere from here. My time is up so no matter what you say, nothing is going to change. So, I just don’t get it, man. I spent months praying to Jack and thinking about you, and you were here the whole time? It’s fucked, Cas.”
“No,” Sam laughs. “You guys have a ‘more profound bond’, remember? I don’t know if Cas knew what he was talking about then, but he wasn’t wrong.”
They burn through two graves before they find the right one, but not before the spirit tries to possess Sam and strangles Castiel. Dean rushes into the room to find Castiel held up against the wall by a ghost he can barely see, slowly losing consciousness. Sam is on the floor, scrabbling around for a shotgun that Dean can’t find. They dropped the crowbars in the kitchen the first time the ghost tried to attack.
Dean finds Castiel in the Dean Cave later that night, sat in one of the recliners with Miracle draped across his lap from arm to arm of the chair. Dean swallows down the ridiculous pang of jealousy when he sees them. Jealous of who, he’s not sure.
Up ahead are headlights and the rumble of an engine he knows too well. His wings ruffle slightly, though still unseen, and the aching in his back intensifies.
Castiel’s eyes, bluer than Dean could have ever remembered on his own, fixate on Dean’s face. It feels like an age before he shows even a hint of relaxing, of understanding what is happening.
“Dean,” Castiel starts. But that’s as far as he gets because Dean holds his hand up and shakes his head.
“Sounds kind of sappy if you ask me,” Dean manages a smile for Sam’s benefit. Oh, to have the luxury to dream.
Dean takes a breath. And another. And another one. And then a sip of his whiskey. “You have no idea what it’s like when you’re gone. Last time, I was the one that carried you inside, that prepared you for the funeral. I was the one that had to light the pyre and then go on, pretend to care about saving the world one case at a time. This time you left nothing behind, and I had no leads to save you.” Dean pauses for a minute, trying to be careful. Trying not to blurt out something he hasn’t fully processed in his own mind yet. “You can do what you want, hunt with Sam, whatever, I’m not trying to stop you. But I need you to hear me when I tell you that I don’t think I have it in me to go through it again.”
“I can’t stay here playing housewife just because you don’t trust me to do the job properly,” Castiel continues. “I’m not going to get myself killed whenever I so much as leave the bunker, Dean. Need I remind you that you weren’t there the last time I lost my grace? You don’t know how capable I can be. One particularly tricky spirit isn’t the measure of what I can do, grace or no grace.”
… you gotta help us out, Jack. I can’t just leave him there. I won’t leave him there. You know I hate doing this, but just point me in the right direction, man. Please. I just need
“We found a way,” he continues. “Jack helped. But I’m going to bring you home. I wish I could have said something, or done something, to stop you and I wish I could have saved you when you needed me to. I’m so sorry, man. You’ve been stuck there for so long.”
“Sure does, Sammy,” Dean stands, pats Sam on the shoulder and makes to leave. “Tell Jack I said ‘hi’.”
He’s sprawled somewhere in the middle of the devil’s trap, and Castiel is propped against one of the walls.
“Come on, you son of a bitch! Come and get him!” Dean yells into nothing and sure enough nothing happens. The demon is dead. The pastor too. And the Shadow continues to hide in the safety of the Empty.
He dares to run his thumb over Castiel’s knuckles, just once, but he can’t make eye contact when Castiel grips his hand a little in return.
“Yeah, I remember but I thought that spell died with him,” but Dean also remembers what happened after Nick died and his tone drifts into tense. He doesn’t want to do this. He doesn’t want to be angry with Jack, not now. He can’t do it.
Castiel wonders if Dean can feel betrayed in Heaven. This place is supposed to be his paradise where nothing can hurt him, where Castiel created an environment that will always keep Dean Winchester safe. Negativity has no place in eternal peace and yet… Castiel looks at Dean’s face, slightly defeated but eyes as bright as he remembers, and he wonders. He wonders if his absence really was felt so profoundly that it latched onto Dean’s soul and followed him into his next existence, whether it should have or not.
Dean can’t look at the body, at the innocent person he knows they should have tried to save. The demon had been toying with the pastor, hopping in and out of the vessel at their leisure. It was firmly in their grasp to return him to his life but… Dean has tunnel-vision. He only sees darkness. He only sees Castiel.
And if he thinks about the last time he spoke to Jack, the last time he saw him, and how he squandered it. He barely said goodbye to his kid. He barely recognised what it would mean.
“Then go for it,” Dean smiles. “Throw that key in a box, get down on one knee and ask her to join us in the finest, cheapest real estate in all of America”
Only now it doesn't hurt to acknowledge. Before, Dean heard Castiel. he heard him and then he watched him die, the forgone conclusion being that Dean destroyed him. But he sees now just how much he misunderstood.
As he takes his seat, Dean holds onto his hand. His arm is stretched across the table, but it makes no sense to stop.
The Shadow pretends to vomit at the thought and delights in the expression on Dean’s face, the one he’s losing control over. Where Castiel’s last words gave him strength, the Shadow is expertly trained to tear it right down.
With every fibre of that stupid trenchcoat under his fingertips, his chin, his arms, wherever he can physically touch, he feels the universe stitching itself back together in every one of his cells and he knows this is right. This is good. This isn’t a win with cosmic consequences like defeating Chuck or Amara, or even Death itself, but it’s the biggest win Dean is after. It’s the only win he wants. And he never wants to chase it ever again.
“Cas,” Dean finally chokes out, perhaps desperately, refusing to look away. Castiel meets his eyes and feels the calm leave him. This is it. He took too long. He took this for granted. This is where he is cast out. This is where Dean tells him to leave. This is… “Stay with me.”
“I know,” he sighs, with a gentler smile. “Good things don’t always happen to me and I guess I knew it would be too easy to ask. I didn’t realise we had so little time left with you.”
“I don’t think you fully understand what was happening when Castiel made his absurd arrangement with the Shadow, but I won’t risk Heaven again. I won’t risk any more angels for a cause barely worthy of consideration. Your constant fight to have Castiel return to you, or you to him, is over, Dean. You are merely a human and the Empty is beyond your reach,” she says with a tone that belies her intent. “I’m sorry but Castiel has served his purpose. Heaven can’t help you.”
“Naomi,” he whispers, late into the night after his third beer. He’s got Cas’ mixtape playing in the stereo, graphic novels open on his laptop and he’s just had enough. Normality is a concept, it’s not real.
As sparks fly into the room from the fireplace, Dean reaches to brush his thumb across Castiel’s cheek, followed by another swipe from the corner of his mouth, and a gentle caress on his face as affirmation that he’s
Sam sighs and twists in his seat to lean against the wall and fix Dean with a look. Dean feels the chill on the back of his neck but pretends it’s not happening.
“I trust you,” Dean eventually says in a smaller voice. “I do trust you, Cas. You’ve had my back more times than almost anyone I’ve ever known, of course I trust you. I don’t trust myself.”
“A documentary,” Castiel explains after taking a sip of the beer. He screws his face up a little as he swallows. “Well, that doesn’t taste the same.”
He did. And the case is solved, and everyone is saved, but there is a redness around Castiel’s neck that wasn’t there before, an irritation that he keeps rubbing, deeper breaths than usual and it’s impossible for Dean to think about anything else. He drives back to the bunker like a maniac, hoping no one notices the absurd number of times he checks the rear-view mirror. Just in case.
a family. He’s two angels and a mom short of the picture he had back then. This is supposed to be freedom, but it feels like it’s Chuck’s wet dream.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, and refuses to look Sam in the eye. “Except we don’t use Jack’s blood. We use Cas’. He’ll either be able to walk through or one of us goes in, I don’t know. But this is the only shot we have.”
“I guess it’s just you and me, then.” Dean smiles, offering one last bit of fuss before going back to his comics.
“I can’t risk taking this from you, Sammy,” Dean tries to smile, tries to make it okay but he can’t. Because it isn’t, really. But what can he do? “She’s in the life, and she’s damn good at her job. And she loves you, man. Who else is going to understand you that way? If you see a future with her you should have it.”
“He made a deal,” Dean’s voice is barely above a whisper. “He made a deal with the Empty to save Jack.”
Lips sliding over lips, warm breath on mouths and chins, foreheads resting gently on another, and his thumb brushing under his eye as he kisses him a little gentler than before, with a little less desperation, but he can feel the want building in his stomach, feel the need growing with every second.
Another burger slides down his throat, chased by beer after beer after beer… until his nightly mantra takes hold, whispered, almost like a prayer: screw you, Chuck.
Dean tries to get Sam to check Castiel’s room but he’s always ‘too busy’ or ‘chasing a lead’ that never goes anywhere, so eventually he has to do it himself.
That they can remove the shame that floods him when Dean parks the car, steps outside and admires the exterior of an obviously lived-in house.
Dean throws his hand out and places it on top of Castiel’s, still lying on the tabletop. The contact sends a thrill down his spine and nausea through his stomach. It’s an involuntary act, but the only one that makes sense so far.
“And now, assuming you don’t piss off any more cosmic entities and get yourself killed, we’re going to save him.”
Dean knows there is something in the network growing and new, young, capable hunters springing up all over the country feeling like it’s less urgent for
He doesn’t think Sam knows that sometimes he stands outside his bedroom door and hears him praying to Jack – sometimes earnestly, sometimes desperately.
And later still, Miracle will join them in the Roadhouse where Dean can look around see everyone he has ever loved and everyone he has ever lost, and then, finally, Castiel will look to the moon, and he will feel the weight of it as it sets, and the sun begins to glow on the lake’s horizon. He will feel the pull of the moon winking at him as it blinks from the sky and he will know what it means as Dean reaches to hold his hand and watch the sunrise with him.
The silence is palpable. Castiel lets it simmer in the air. It feels comfortable, suddenly. The fire is still crackling, charmed to never go out unless Dean wills it, and the rain has stopped outside. A calm has washed over the house and Castiel sends a silent thank you to Jack.
Dean’s phone rings, Sam’s name flashing up on the screen. He grabs at it and throws it on the backseat without care.
“Join the club,” and finally, Dean joins him and sits down. He pours them both a glass and wonders what on earth Castiel would think if he could see his three-year-old drinking whiskey in the morning.
“Stop!” The Shadow tries for a booming voice this time, and just for good measure makes sure to swipe Dean off his feet again. The Shadow throws him higher this time, so he lands harder. The aches turn into breaks, but he’s somehow still got air in his lungs. And so, from the ground, he continues:
“Oh yeah?” Dean tries to smile, tries to will away the embarrassment of being heard, of being seen. “See anything good?”
Because it feels like a cruel trick. It feels like Jack getting his final laugh. And god, Dean deserves it. He feels the guilt every day and he wants to scream when he thinks of how close he was to losing Jack altogether out of his misguided, desperate rage.
“You’re family, Cas,” he manages to get out, but for the first time it sounds hollow, devoid of meaning. Because Castiel is his family but he’s not ‘family’ in the broader sense Dean had always been taught to use it. “I’m not going to fight some cosmic entity to bring you home just to let some pissed off ghost kill you.”
“I need to talk with Dean,” Jack smiles, manages to throw Sam an apologetic glance, but fixes his gaze on Dean. And it’s unsettling. Dean helped raise him, he was there for his first few months when his own mother and chosen father couldn’t be. But the intensity with which he looks at Dean now? It’s bigger than Chuck. It’s bigger even than Amara. Dean wonders if he should be falling to his knees and praying right now.
After months of Eileen living in the bunker, Castiel moving into Dean’s room, and Sam building a new hunter network, Dean finds himself hunting less and less and no one says a damn word about it.
He’s unaware of Dean, struggling to know what to do in the silence, choking on his wants and trying to force himself to speak them, gripping onto the architrave like it’s the last thing holding him up. He’s staring at Castiel, standing calmly by the window, and he’s distressed.
“Shit,” Dean exhales and Castiel has never seen a soul tortured in heaven. He’s never seen a soul give in to negativity like this. He’s only seen peace. He doesn’t see peace before him now. He sees fear, sadness, longing…
“SHUT UP!” The Shadow eventually yells and with a click of its fingers, Castiel appears before him the very image of the man haunting every minute of Dean’s existence. He’s lying on the ground and he’s awake and he’s squinting, and he’s never looked more confused.
Dean is about to turn the doorknob when it suddenly flies open, and there he is. Castiel is wearing one of Dean’s old t-shirts and some lounge pants that he probably found in the drawers. His hair is a mess and it’s obvious that he hasn’t found his way around a razor yet. But he looks rested. And he looks… good. Really good.
But Dean can’t promise anything. He wants to, so badly. He wants to tell Jack he will live the happiest life and find joy in the mundane and get a real job, maybe a house with proper windows and ventilation, perhaps a garden for Miracle. But every time he thinks of it, Castiel is always by his side. And that terrifies him.
The breeze turns into wind and it picks up enough to hide the sun momentarily. He's in the middle of the road with a 1960's muscle car and the soul he traded his grace, humanity and life for. The sun moves to set as it peeks out from behind a cloud, and as Castiel is bathed in pink and orange light, he feels his grace waning again.
Days pass and pages turn, and the words all begin to look like Enochian. The Men of Letters knew about multiple universes, they knew how to cure a demon, they knew to ward against God and angels. But they don’t have a single mention of where an angel or demon goes when they die.
The door isn’t locked so Dean pushes it open. Castiel knows the fire is burning before he even hears the crackling. He knows there are photos of the Winchesters all over the coffee table waiting to be framed. He knows there is beer in the fridge and a duvet on the bed, and he knows there are leaflets for take-out services in one of the kitchen drawers. He knows this. And he’s so ashamed.
“Thank you,” Castiel smirks and shifts slightly towards Dean, presses a soft and gentle kiss to his lips pulling back only so far as to touch the tip of his nose. “I love you.”
He wonders if it’s going to happen fast or slow, if he can get Castiel out before it happens or if he will have to find his own way.
Castiel wishes he could still feel the shifts of Heaven, the way it is finely tuned to Dean’s presence, to react and bow to his wants, needs and feelings. But he can’t. He wonders if Dean can, if he’s just ignoring it. If he really understands how this place is
, Castiel thinks, as visions of how he thought this reunion would go vanish into the many stitches and threads holding this realm together.
to be on the frontline, for Castiel to have to continue fighting the way he does. But for all that Dean has spent his life fighting for Sam to have the chance to stop, no one wants to talk when it’s apparent that Dean is, day by day, finding his own happy ever after away from the monsters.
“Well at least you can stop coddling me whenever I so much as think about going on a hunt,” Castiel rolls his eyes, purposefully picks the beer back and takes a mouthful.
"I love this," Dean says quietly, with a gentle squeeze on Castiel's hand. Castiel exhales, and grasps at their joined hands with his other. He turns as Dean leans in, whispers a quick "
Dean nods, suddenly feeling wide awake. He doesn’t even question the legitimacy of it. “I’ll go get ready, then.” He gestures to his hotdog pyjamas with a smirk, but his heart is hammering in his chest and really, he’d go save Castiel wearing a dress if he had to, but he needs to calm down. He needs to focus. Because this really is last-chance-saloon. All his moping and self-deprecating and desperate need to
“This is me taking you home,” he explains simply, but for what feels like the tenth time. “It’s so good to see you, man. So fucking good. But we don’t have time, we have to leave.”
“Yeah, I agree,” Sam nods, but he’s not ready to give up. “But so is mom, and dad. Jack, even. You know that’s not what I’m talking about.”
“Dean!” Sam calls from where he is still on the floor and for the first time, Dean notices that he’s hurt. But he’s shoving a tall wrought iron candlestick across the floor for Dean to catch, and as soon as it is in his hand, he swipes at the ghost who vanishes into particles around them.
“Let’s see if we can’t get him back on his holy path,” Dean is out of the door and in the garage before Sam has finished his coffee. Dean pretends not to notice Sam’s raised eyebrow, concerned glances across the Impala, and general confusion. He just doesn’t want to talk about it. He honestly doesn’t think he ever can.
“I’ve never had an angel before,” Castiel’s voice says but it’s anything but him. “The shred of grace he has left stings a little, but I can manage.”
And he just drops it into the air, just says it and lets it hang there. And it’s Dean’s job to catch it, cradle it and send it back with something just as profound, as… romantic. But he’s fumbling because his mouth has gone dry and there’s a slight tremor in his hands and he’s pretty sure his beer is flat and man, has this chair always been so uncomfortable?
He grabs Castiel’s hand and presses a kiss to his knuckles before shifting into gear and driving on home.
“I don’t want to hunt full-time anymore,” Dean says into the Dean Cave one day, Sam lying on the floor with Miracle, and Castiel in the other recliner, lying back with the footrest out and chair tilted back. No one points out that he hasn’t hunted full-time in a long time, that Dean stepped into the world he wants long before he was ready to speak about it. But as he says it, the tension he’s been holding back leaves him and it’s easy. It’s easy to admit now.
of that name finding its shape in Dean’s mouth wouldn’t make him sick. “What happened? How did he summon the Empty?”
“Dean?” Castiel asks once more, but this time he barely brushes his fingertips along Dean’s cheek, trying to trust that he’s real. “What is this?”
But Castiel only screws his eyes shut and blocks out the sound of Dean’s voice. And Dean has no idea what to do. He can see the light in the distance, the tear in the fabric of this Nothing, and he knows they need to go but…
“Sure,” Dean smiles. “No, yes. I don’t know. I wanted to just hang out, talk to you, let off some steam, go for a drive, grab some burgers… you know?”
Because this life now? It’s doomed to repeat itself. Castiel isn’t coming back, but he’ll leave the bunker open for him. Castiel isn’t coming back, but Dean is keeping his mixtape, his badge, and curating them like he’s running a museum. Castiel isn’t coming back, but Dean is going to take every opportunity to just try because what is this life he fought so hard for if his happy ending is left in the dust?
The spell is broken. “A little too close if you ask me,” Dean grumbles, stepping out of the vacuum he’s found himself in. “Know any good bars around here?”
Dean gestures to the empty beer bottles standing on a table on the front porch, right next to the main door. “I think someone already moved in.”
“It’s different from before,” Castiel smiles and sits on the edge of his bed. “Last time, the Shadow returned me as I was before I died because it wanted rid of me. It was a negotiation.”
Miracle follows him to his room and slips through the door before it is slammed, before Dean punches the wall and bloodies his knuckles. Before he stares at himself in his tiny mirror and hates the angry, grieving, disaster that he sees looking back at him.
“Eileen and I have been talking a lot lately,” Sam speaks into the silence, cautiously. “About where we see this thing we have going, the future, you know? That sort of thing?”
“I didn’t,” Dean shrugs, leaning against the car and gazing up at the flickering sign. The sun is casting a glow over him so gently but he’s so vibrant he almost looks alive. “I just wanted to feel normal again. Cas…”
“I’ve had an angel squatting in my home for years, Cas. Why do you think I wouldn’t want you here now?”
He feels like his mouth is full of riddles, that he's cursed to never speak in plain English. That telling Castiel ‘I love you' might kill
It takes five more sunrises and four sunsets before Castiel kicks the sheets from his legs, tangled around his ankles, and holds Dean close.
“It’s so good to see you!” Sam exclaims, patting Jack on the back and pulling him into a quick one-armed hug. “So… how’s it going?”
He’s scanning the pages of a study on demons, specifically how they die, when the lights begin to flash in the library room. Sam looks up from one of Rowena’s spell books to take notice when the map table begins to flash, and the lights switch to red. Dean immediately grabs his gun and Sam grabs one of the weapons on display. The tables begin to shake, and books fall from the shelves.
Nothing but a curious glance from Miracle where he’s curled up on the other chair when Dean’s bottle smashes into the wall.
Dean revs louder than before and shifts the car into gear. It’s performative and ridiculous, but if it will shut Sam up… though it doesn’t. And Sam is twisted in the passenger seat staring down the side of Dean’s face so hard it begins to burn.
draped over the back of the chair in the corner. Castiel is painted all over the room, there is no mistaking it. He’s been playing house in his fantasy of the life Dean deserved and it’s
“If it’s the difference between you being alive or dead, yes!” Dean raises his voice because he’s tried, but he just can’t keep it at bay.
His skin tingles, and his wings itch, as the feathers shed and his grace drifts towards the moon. In a heartbeat, it vanishes from existence and the warm glows of sunrise emerge behind the worn-down building.
It seems utterly absurd that these are the troubles in their lives now. That Dean gets to be a normal big brother, gets to share bad relationship advice and tease his little brother relentlessly. There are no thinly veiled undertones of life-threatening monsters or demon deals or twisted angels, no apocalypses, or prophecies. He doesn’t have to throw his life on the line for Sam anymore. He’s not his parent. He’s his brother. He’s his friend.
“Okay,” Sam eventually says, and Dean almost spits out his beer. “We should call in all the help we can in case the worst happens but yeah, okay.”
“You think you can take him away from here?” the Shadow laughs. “You think he’ll walk away willingly, with you? He chose this, Dean.
“From the minute you arrived, my grace has been disappearing. It’s almost gone… so my work is done.”
“Jack’s compromise with Amara was that he could recreate Heaven if he didn’t have to stay here, if he could manage all the worlds Chuck created and keep them balanced, in harmony. With a singular focus on Heaven, he just couldn’t do that. So, Amara agreed when Jack asked to bring me here, but it was on the proviso that I rebuild Heaven, maintain it, manage it. I couldn’t just leave. That wasn’t the agreement.”
“It’s okay, man,” Dean stands and makes for the door, but not before dropping the mixtape onto the side, next to the stereo. “I borrowed that while you were gone, thought you might want it back.”
Castiel isn’t going anywhere and yet when Dean’s fingertips itch to reach out and even just skim the edge of his ridiculous coat, or the palm of his hand, he finds nothing.
Castiel pulls back after a moment, dragging his teeth across Dean’s lower lip as he does, and stares at him, searching his eyes for
“Thought you’d put on a show for us?” Dean grumbles, putting the gun down and scanning the mess. But it hardly matters, because before Jack can even form a response Dean has pulled him into a hug. Dean knows it’s insane, but he’s still their kid. He’s still Castiel’s kid.
“Okay,” Castiel agrees. “But I think we need to speak to Rowena about her abominations running loose.”
, as he puts his glass down on the table and makes to stand. “Good-” he starts, trying to say goodnight, goodbye…
“Okay?” Dean questions, suspiciously. But Sam just nods. Sam gives him a look that borders on pitying and Dean can’t look back anymore. He can’t stomach being seen so clearly.
“We have a dog now,” Dean grins, spinning Castiel in his arms and pressing a kiss to his cheek. “Come and meet him!”
“You know that’s not true,” Sam laughs it off, but the surprise of the statement and the ease at which Sam said it hits Dean right in the chest. Sam’s right. Of course, he’s right. But it doesn’t make it any easier to hear. “Have you spoken to him yet, about how he died?”
and as soon as I saw it, I knew because I could picture myself there, one day. In another life, probably.”
“Cas!” he yells, just like last time. It echoes for miles and then it echoes right back to him. His voice is travelling to nothing.
He hasn’t seen a single person since he left the bunker and he’s had no one to listen to but Sam and all Sam wants to know is what happened to Castiel and there’s just nothing but grass and sand and fields and mountains and the sun is setting on the day.
“If I calculated it right, you should end up where he is,” Sam explains. “We don’t know anything about this place. Cas never really spoke about it in detail but wherever he is in there, you should be.”
“Like me?" Dean scoffs. "Dead at 41, single, with a dog as his new best friend and a brother that won’t just move out?”
"Shall I come back later?" Dean jokes, but Castiel isn't feeling jovial. He is an angel, with a promotion. But the second he felt Dean Winchester arrive, he lost his grip. His godly purpose, his divine plan, his heavenly architecture, all utterly meaningless in the face of a soul that deserved to live, clutching at Castiel's faith and refusing to let go.
“She told me that I didn’t have to discuss it if I didn’t want to, but that I might be surprised if I did,” Castiel rolls his eyes, completely missing Dean’s startled inhale. “She also told me that she was glad I told you but that she was upset for both of us that it was in the circumstances that it was.”
It takes another few hours for Dean to pick up the damn mixtape and find his way to Castiel’s door, mid-afternoon. He breathes, breathes again, rolls his eyes, and finally forces his hand to knock. “Cas? You awake?”
“Dean, right? It’s all up here,” the demon gestures to Castiel’s head and jabs at it. “Dean, Dean, Dean, I love Dean, Dean, Dean, so beautiful, beautiful Dean, Deeeeeeeeeeeean.”
Castiel is gazing at him fondly, sliding into Dean’s space and resting an arm around his shoulders, fingers tangling in Dean’s hair, gently soothing, calming, as they watch over the move. On instinct, Dean wraps his arm around Castiel’s waist and pulls him closer still.
Because Miracle isn’t on the bed anymore, he’s on the floor. He’s curled up asleep on Dean’s jacket.
“I’ll give you the spell if you promise me you’ll let yourself be at peace, Dean,” Jack sounds tired, like this has genuinely agonised him. “We all fought for this and I need you to not waste it.”
The demon takes a step forward, dragging Donna along. Dean knows he should be throwing holy water, he should be starting to chant the exorcism, he should be doing anything. But he’s stuck in place, once again.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs but this time, it doesn’t come from inside. It’s shallow, hollow. It doesn’t mean anything. “It was free but… most of the time I just wanted to do this.”
“I don’t understand the way you see me,” Dean starts, swallowing down any instinct to abort the mission and retreat. “But I need you to know… I heard what you said so I know why you do.”
“As soon as I understood my end of the deal, I just assumed I would never find a reason to be happy. Our lives have rarely offered moments that would allow it.”
living in it. And I didn’t get to tell you before but Cas… you really thought you couldn’t have me? Have this?”
Eileen moves in two weeks later. Two weeks after Dean stood in a pool of dead vampires and kissed Castiel for the first time. Two weeks after everything just snapped right into place and he stepped right on into the paradise Jack promised. And it’s a simple affair – Eileen is calm as she dumps her belongings on the map table and signs orders to Sam, but Sam is mostly flustered. He’s red, he’s anxious, but he has a smile that not even Eileen’s heaviest boxes can shift and for that, Dean wonders if there is a way of making her stay permanently, come what may.
“I froze today, seeing the way that spirit had you,” Dean admits, which is somehow easier than saying what he knows Castiel needs to hear, deserves to hear. He pulls his hand back slowly. “I couldn’t see anything but you dying, and I can’t do that again, Cas.”
“How did you know?” Dean asks, almost accusing. And now, Castiel must speak. Heaven won’t do it for him.
“I know,” Castiel grins, fully understanding his own reference and thoroughly enjoying Dean’s eyes light up when he realises.
Heaven gives him a final push to complete his fall from grace. He steps out from the headlights, wings folded back, and the moon dashes behind a cloud. As he moves closer, he takes in the scent of earth and spice and day-old beer, of peppermint and slightly dirty clothes.
Dean Winchester, who has fought vampires and demons and God himself, can't find enough courage to tell the angel before him that he loves him, and he wants him to stay.
“I miss him, Jack,” Dean sighs, brings a bottle to his lips and takes more than he should. “But you know that because you were there last time I lost- we lost him. It’s not paradise until he gets to be in it too. So, if you can do
Castiel who broke free from God and Heaven, and who Dean followed into Nothing on a wing and a prayer just to bring him home.
Jody flashes him a small smile and runs her hand down his arm. It’s supposed to be reassuring, and to a degree it is. He grabs her hand when it reaches his and squeezes tight. “Thank you,” he mumbles.
And there at the top, he finds Castiel’s face staring back at him. Stoic, calm and handsome. The picture sits on one of the many fake ID cards Dean made him. He feels it like a stab in his stomach. He’s winded and he might be bleeding but who cares… it’s one thing to remember the moment Castiel told him that he loves him, of everything he’s ever thought of him, but it’s another to see his face so clearly. To remember every part of his features, the ones he chose to keep for many years. The ones he chose to keep while he stayed with Dean.
He blinks and Castiel is stood before him, silhouetted by the oranges and purples smearing across the sky.
“I was... I didn’t know what to do when you were gone. I thought I’d never see you again but now you’re here, and you built me a perfect fucking house and
, he hears, but this time he smiles. The sun is high in the sky, the moon is hiding, and his grace now barely a spark in his chest.
There's an angel standing in the middle of the house that he built as a love letter, dressed in the most casual clothes Heaven could conjure. He’s surrounded by photos of his life, Dean’s life, and for the first time he’s not lost. He’s found. He knows what he has been looking for and he’s suddenly drowning in it.
Dean lets out the breath he didn’t know he was holding and presses his forehead to Castiel’s, pressing hard enough to leave a mark. “Never again,” he says quietly. “You’re never doing this to me again.”
The ‘I don’t know’ is lingering on the tip of Dean’s tongue and it’s bitter and he wants to spit it out and end all of this. But he swallows it instead. Because Castiel was Sam’s friend too.
“When?” he answers over the not-vegetarian-bacon he’s frying off as Sam nurses a coffee in the bunker’s kitchen.
“I know this isn’t easy,” Sam tries again, impossibly even more gentle than before. “But I don’t understand what happened and I feel like I can’t just move on or grieve. I don’t understand why there wasn’t another way.”
“Dean,” Naomi softens slightly, but it’s barely noticeable. “The only way into the Empty is to die as an angel or a demon, and there’s no way out. Only one angel has ever managed it on his own.”
Dean moves his fingers and catches the indent on his fingertip. He curls his fingers into the palm of his hand and presses hard, just to be sure of what it feels like. To be sure of feeling anything at all.
. And he can’t stop talking. He modelled this Heaven in Dean’s image and yet it is a simple house that is making him crumble. He’s already told Dean he loves him, and he knows Dean understands this Heaven is for him… but the house. He might as well have sent a love letter, sealed with a kiss, sprayed with cologne, and all other references he barely understands from rom-com movie nights after rom-com movie nights (
“Slow down, cowboy,” he sighs, falling away from Castiel and heaving heavy breaths on the floor. “We’ll put that on the to-do list for next week. I need a beer.”
Dean slams his foot on the clutch and shifts gear, immediately pressing on the gas to gain more speed, speed, speed. The road is empty before him, nothing but grassy hills and trees on one side and California coastline on the other. It’s not a trip he ever thought he would take but here he is, car growling below him, Castiel next to him in a loose shirt and sunglasses that they’d picked up in some coastal town in Oregon, Miracle half on his lap and half on the seat, and the smell of fresh sea air flowing through the open windows.
