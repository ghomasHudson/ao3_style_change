“I don’t like lying to Director Rogers, even by omission,” was her greeting. Tony sighed and led her off the helipad and into the Tower. The penthouse was clear, he’d made sure that would be the case before confirming Dr. Chimva’s travel itinerary, and she appeared thoroughly unimpressed as she strode through it.
Two days later, the Avengers were called out. Somehow, the blaring sound of the call to assemble managed to actually startle Tony. He’d lived the entire period between the Battle of New York and the final war against Thanos on edge, always waiting for the next strike. (Christ, he didn’t even know if Thanos was still alive here, how did he not know? Had he really taken the security of this universe so much for granted?)
He was halfway through his second cup when the rest of the team began to trickle in. First was Coulson and Barton.
. Yes, by quirk of fate or whatever the hell was at play here, you look and act a lot like the guy they used to love, but you’re still separate entities whose needs and desires and experiences may vary drastically.”
“Hey, I’m not the only one who’s pissed. You got what you needed to stabilize, and now it’s time to get to work.”
“Gonna need more information, Tones.”
He listened to Tony’s feedback about everything, actually, and took about ninety percent of his proposals including the dozens of obstacles and threats he insisted they throw at Barnes out of sheer pettiness. Maybe Phil didn’t protest that because the other man hardly seemed upset by any of it; with unnerving speed and flexibility, Barnes almost danced through the course, shouting taunts and laughing in surprise when Tony and Phil actually managed to hit him with something.
“They remain the same, Captain Rogers.”
“It’s interesting that you mention wanting to go back to your past, and that you compared everything unfavourably to that period in time. I wonder if that might be a pattern worth exploring.”
“If you wanted a janitor you should have hired one.”
“I mean, to be fair, the Director got his job by crashing a helicarrier into the Potomac. I don’t know that he’d be in the best position to—”
“I’m assuming Taskmaster didn’t talk? Not that I officially know anything about all that, of course.” Pepper smiled sweetly and took a delicate sip of the expensive coffee she’d had delivered to her in the Tower conference room they were meeting in. Steve laughed aloud, wondering again (and not even for the first time during that particular conversation) how it was that he’d never reached out to Pepper before, when the other Tony had still been alive. She was funny and whip-smart, compassionate without compromising on the things that really mattered. She was…well, a lot like Peggy, actually.
Just because they couldn’t be everything to each other, though, didn’t mean they had to be nothing. Rhodey had been determined, right from the moment this Tony had arrived into their universe and had looked at Rhodey like he was the only sure thing left, never to fall into that trap again. And now, instead of fighting Tony’s existing partners every step of the way, they’d invited him to stay. He still had little concrete information about what precisely that would look like, but for the first time in nearly a decade, with Tony’s hands clutching desperately at his own, Rhodey had
By everyone, Kala had meant
A number of glib responses, filled with Tony’s usual mixture of sarcasm and brutal, self-deprecating honesty, nearly passed his lips. He was the very last one that anyone, let alone someone as fundamentally good and decent as Peter Parker, should have been asking for advice about balancing all the complexities of superheroing with regular life. But he couldn’t quite bring himself to meet Peter’s desperate plea for some kind of guidance with any degree of pessimism.
“Kill the music, JARVIS. I uh…I didn’t know if you did this, in your universe, or if you’d want to. I can go.” The bots all beeped in protest at this offer, and Barnes placed a comforting hand on You’s strut. The bot, who at least in Tony’s own universe tended to be the most withdrawn and task-focused of the three, wheeled closer to Barnes as if drawing comfort from the touch which…Tony was way, way too hungover for the realization that his own bots had apparently replaced him with James bloody Barnes.
Tony truly wasn’t trying to step on a landmine. Sure, he sometimes liked pushing Steve’s buttons, that part of their dynamic hadn’t completely vanished in the new universe, but needling Steve was about the last thing on his mind when Steve had just recovered from the last remnants of his drop that morning. He’d really just been trying to make light, airy conversation while they munched their way through a bag of Chicago popcorn mix.
Tony should have known, really. Natasha was always at her most dangerous when she was in the shadows, and he hadn’t seen her since he’d moved over to the bench. It was almost insulting how much it could hurt for her tiny hands to connect with his ass; he wondered absently if it was comparable to flogger in a way, if somehow the smaller surface area of Natasha’s hands made the impact stingier. The blows felt just as rhythmic as her work with the paddle had, maybe even moreso. She kept at it long enough for his mind to start to visualize the pattern as a series of music notes: a rest here, an eighth and then a few sixteenth notes here, a long whole note whenever she let her hand rest for a few beats on his skin. When he closed his eyes, he could almost hear the music of it playing alongside the percussive impact of her hand.
Shawarma, Steve decided, was the best food that this century’s New York had to offer. Now, to be fair, it was possible that some of this was his super-metabolism talking, stretched to its limits by the battle they’d just fought and desperate for any kind of sustenance. However, he would loudly proclaim to anyone who would listen that this wasn’t the whole of the matter; it was just damn good food. He was too hungry to try to catalogue the range of flavours that coated the meat, but he knew enough to know it was seasoned to perfection, and roasted perfectly. It came with a sauce, too, something Natasha said was called tahini. It tasted like lemon and sesame and if he hadn’t had an audience, Steve could easily have polished off a tub of the stuff.
“It’s not. I’m being briefed on a situation I could honestly use your input on, plus a friend of mine is in town and I’d really love for you to meet her.”
Realization had him sitting up suddenly from his chair, sending it careening behind him and nearly knocking over a delicate glass jar full of potpourri as he sprinted towards the elevators and jabbed the button for the lobby.
“I can never show my face in this Tower again,” Tony declared miserably, banging his forehead against Steve’s chest. “I’m gonna have to move, or at the very least get some pretty major plastic surgery so that I’m not recognizable.”
“Yes.”
“But I don’t know
“But I…it’s, I haven’t felt like this in years. Could—maybe if we did this every day, the punishment thing?” Bruce’s touch to his ass turned less clinical, more of a soothing rub that he wouldn’t normally deliver during check-ins, which was a small comfort. (God, was Tony blinking back tears? Seriously?)
Content Notes: Underage, alien-booze drinking (accompanied by a lot of vomiting.) And the usual warnings for a grieving, hurt teenager.
And that…that wasn’t a pained kind of noise. Steve knew precisely what that tone in Tony’s voice meant and it was pretty much the opposite of pain. (Oh god.)
Tony jerked upright; his eyes were still swimming with submission, but he was visibly clawing his way back up to baseline as quickly as he could manage.
“Stop hyperextending your elbow! Your freaky hyper-flexible dancer-limbs are not a benefit to you here, I keep telling you!”
His Natasha had often preferred tea, too, and watching her undergo the quiet ritual of boiling the water, steeping the tea, then adding milk and sugar was oddly comforting. She even let him mostly finish the cup in silence before she went for the usual Natasha sucker punch.
“Oh yeah?” Clint’s eyes darted up briefly from his sketch, almost like he was afraid to spook Tony out of the disclosure by looking directly at him.
Where I see Rhodes being most useful on this front, however, is in considering some of the daily ways in which this dynamic impacts Stark. He’s an imminently practical person, so I suspect it will be he who will realize that Stark may not wish to continue sleeping in sheets that did not originally belong to him. Rhodes also excels at not making assumptions, however, so I see him as equally capable of recognizing the moments where the continuity between the two might bring Stark comfort (such as with both versions of Stark each having the same favourite coffee mugs or t-shirts.)
By dinner, Tony had slid all the way up to baseline without even realizing it had happened. Coming up out of headspace had never been this smooth before. He stared slack-jawed and stunned at Steve, who just winked in reply.
“Oh my god he was dropping. He came to see me today, and his behaviour was…odd. He was seeking out both touch and approval, and he kept shivering like he just couldn’t warm up. I didn’t think a lot of it at the time, to be honest, because we don’t know him well enough to have a sense of how abnormal some of that is. And he calmed down after a bit. After we…”
? Was he giving up on Tony already? Steve’s hands were back on him, Steve’s Dominant voice in his ear, and that was the only thing keeping Tony from descending into real panic.
Finally, there is a brief misunderstanding where Steve assumes Tony is suicidal. It's cleared up immediately, but also easily skipped if necessary. Just avoid the paragraph beginning "The fatalism of that sounded entirely too familiar."
Finally, Steve is still struggling in this chapter and takes it out physically on a SHIELD agent. They are sparring and the agent is given plenty of opportunities to tap out, but Steve certainly will later consider it an inappropriate use of his strength.
The hints implied by the presence of particular materials turned out to be the most involved Tony got for the entire afternoon. It wasn’t exactly quiet in the lab, not with Tony’s music blaring and his ongoing banter with his AI (so cool), his bots, and occasionally people who were not in the room. He made occasional conversation with Peter, too, but it was all pretty neutral stuff and generally related to the work one or both of them were doing.
Content Notes: Tony's food issues, specifically his near-starvation in space, is discussed in this chapter. If you want to avoid, skip from "He didn't know quite how tied up in knots..." until the end of that section.
The boxes she dragged into the living room were far too big to be take out. The first was probably 30 inches tall and another 18 long and wide, and she deposited that one at Tony’s feet with a triumphant grin. He tore the tape off to find several large stacks of clothes. (Oh, right. Had it really been just a few days ago that he’d taken their suggestions to order some of his own stuff, so he could stop living out of Mark II’s wardrobe? He could also could have sworn he selected a delivery date after the press conference as an added precaution, but perhaps the timing was what Nat looked so smug about.)
Tony was fixated. He knew he was, and he was aware enough to realize it was starting to piss the others off. But there was nothing more irritating in the world than the sensation of knowing there was a link somewhere and not being able to find it. It was the mental equivalent of having something stuck between your teeth when you don’t have access to floss.
“I want a grilled cheese sandwich. And we should use the Iron Legion when they come for us.” Steve was halfway to the kitchen to seek out ingredients for the requested meal when he spun on his heel.
“There was a shocking lack of naughty content.” Tony cocked his head in consideration and then reached down to tug his sweatpants off, letting his legs fall open in invitation. He wasn’t entirely certain he’d ever be able to get it up again after Phil’s sorcery earlier that morning, but he was down far enough that his exhaustion was rapidly seeming less important than giving Steve what he wanted.
Bucky spits a vicious string of curses under his breath and throws the door open with his metal hand.
“That’d be pretty impossible given how much we want you all the time, wouldn’t it? No, I mean I guess to some extent things might slow down a little if you ended up wanting that. We’ve been in crisis mode basically since you got here, first training you to pass as a sub and then using submission because it was the easiest and most familiar way for us to help you work through some pretty intense crises. What I meant was—well, cortisol produces fight-or-flight responses in the body, yeah? So you’ve been on edge for weeks, your system clinging to submission as hard as it could because it was desperate, not to mention terrified that it might not come around again. Now your body and your head are starting to trust that it’ll be there when you need it, so it should start to calm down, let the submission be less of a roller coaster and more like gently rolling waves.”
It was a little after three in the morning by the time the Avengers were all collected in varying levels of wakefulness. Tony stood in the centre of them all, trading good-natured jibes with Bucky, who was insisting that Tony must not be tiring his dominant out properly if he still had the energy to work out in the middle of the night.
Just when Tony was working up the nerve to ask, Bruce exited the elevator and made his way to Tony, nudging his shoulder and reaching a hand out for his empty plate.
“If you keep it up I’m coming for you too, date or not,” he warned Tony with a smile way too charming to be human.
No chapter-specific content notes I can think of for this one! As always feel free to let me know, though, if you have questions or concerns about the chapter.
Tony reunites with the team in the last place he would have predicted.
“How long will it be before you get the results back?” Rhodey asked as Chimva capped the vials and gently shook the ones that had serums in them.
“There are signs. You can learn someone’s orientational tells the same way you can any other form of body language and behaviour. Coulson’s general response to stress, particularly at work, is to become calmer and hyper-competent. He manages, he manipulates, he handles until the situation is back to where he wishes it to be. His movements are precise, his every word chosen carefully. This morning he was short-tempered. He snapped at Clint and I over the same crap we pull every day. He ordered me an egg-white and turkey bacon breakfast wrap when I asked for sausage. And he didn’t notice that you had barely eaten any of your bagel when he reached for your plate.”

episode,’ which was unsurprising. Steve had fallen in love with Leo and his Big Block of Cheese from the first time he’d seen it, and his attempts to convince the team the show hadn’t inspired Community Day was…well, a big fat lie on his part. The Avengers, Steve felt, suffered from the same problem as those in the upper echelons of government in a lot of ways. When they only appeared for showdowns with aliens or possessed robots or other larger-than-life villains, it was easy for everyone to forget that the team’s most important commitment was to the people. They then started to think of the Avengers not as people, but as remote, godlike deities, and that kind of disconnect just wasn’t good for anyone. It made citizens feel like their daily lives and problems were unimportant, and it made them forget that the team were fallible and (mostly) human themselves.
His encryptions are impressive even for a mortal, so while I can’t provide a complete overview, I can confirm that his notes include: clothing habits (and current measurements); eating preferences (complete with an itemized list of meals they’ve seen Stark reject or strongly enjoy), recreation/leisure interests, and both confirmed and speculative notes about all elements of Stark’s overall health. There is also what I can only deem a truly absurd shared ‘wish list’ where the team is adding items they intend to purchase for Stark once they feel he will be more inclined to accept gifts from them.
Steve wanted to argue the accuracy of the description, wanted to protest that the hundreds of children who had found themselves orphans in the wake of the Snap didn’t belong to Natasha. Not because her orphanage hadn’t been valuable—of all of them, Natasha’ contribution to the post-Snap world had undoubtedly been the most meaningful. Those kids worshipped Nat, sought out her unique pairing of quiet comfort and brutal honesty, the way she never softened the harshness of their reality even while she held them through tears and read them stories and tucked them into bed. Steve wanted to force those words back into Tony’s mouth and beg him to keep it closed because how could Steve have forgotten that they weren’t the only ones who had lost Natasha today. They weren’t her only family.
“Hey!”
A little over two hours later found Peter wandering the compound on his own. May had been reluctant to leave, but was eventually persuaded by Happy’s thoughtfully-timed reservations in the city (Peter had mouthed a silent thanks to the guy for that one.) The repeated assurances of Peter, Happy, and FRIDAY that Captain Rogers would be returning later that evening was the eventual tipping point.
Ned beamed. Wide, unselfconscious, and toothy, the kind of smile they’d both worn so much as children but that Peter had assumed they’d lost forever somewhere along the way. Except it made him feel different to see it now. Back then smiles like that had meant simple camaraderie, secrets of the kind that little kids shared like sneaking treats or staying up past bedtime. Now it made something stir in the pit of Peter’s stomach, a sort of protective triumph he mostly associated with his time as Spider-Man, and with the few chances he’d had to experiment with Dominance when he’d first been classified as a Switch.
Tony was sprawled victoriously across Clint’s couch, eating a kohlrabi like an apple and watching some kind of adult cartoon featuring a talking horse. They’d finally escaped the 31st floor, and had even made out a little in the elevator, but Clint had halted things before they’d gotten more than PG, citing the innocence of the robot llama they had constructed as a condition of their release from the last part of the escape room. They’d settled in to watch television and munch on the truly odd assortment of things in Clint’s fridge; they’d debated ordering something in, but Tony had been more amused by the thought of piecing what Clint had together in some bizarre semblance of a meal. Next to him, Clint was pouring a can of red bull into a single-serving container of Fruit Loops. (He was a beautiful disaster of a human and Tony was halfway to loving him already.)
“Better,” Steve said honestly. The bath would help too, he knew. All that skin to skin contact, plus the opportunity to make Tony clean and comfortable would cut through most of his remaining worry and discomfort. If he managed to get some food into Tony afterward Steve would probably be back pretty close to baseline. “I’m really sorry. I didn’t know this would happen, it’s been forever since I dropped that hard.”
“Borrowed, Rhodeykins, borrowed! And I actually fixed the damn thing, it was a disaster. The arrangement of the sensors was asinine, it had less spatial reasoning than a Roomba, but when the guy found me and got pissed I was. Well. I was allegedly slightly less than clear about what I’d done and why I’d done it. But some nosy guy had been watching me work for a while; he stopped me from getting my ass kicked by explaining to PhDofus what modifications I’d made and why they made it better. And then mystery guy took me back to his dorm, let me throw up in his best pair of sneakers, which I later replaced, and the rest was history.”
MCU Peter's first day at his new digs.
For several long moments, one robot (oh, no, two robots—Drama the robot llama had emerged from the bedroom to investigate), one modified Iron Man suit, seven humans and one god surveyed one another in complete silence. (Well, almost complete. Dummy was still offering his account of things to anyone who would listen, and Drama was now egging him on.) When Tony finally spoke, it was a rasping, destroyed whisper.
“Fuck no,” Tony blurted. A chorus of relieved laughter echoed through the room, and Tony felt warm for the first time in days. “Honestly, I’d really rather just pretend this whole thing didn’t happen, chalk it up to cold feet and move on.”
Content Notes: There are two scenes in response #3. The first contains a scene in which D/s verse Tony fails to safeword when necessary. It also contains a brief mention, though no direct representation, of a former abusive relationship Tony was in with Sunset Baine. Feel free to skip if either of these are trigger areas for you, or let me know if you need more information before deciding whether to read. The second scene in that response includes the use of a safeword (which is, of course, respected and treated safely and kindly.)
“And the reason he can’t come back, or be in both places? He said to ask you, and I assume he meant, you know,
SHIELD’s director, when Tony finally dared to look at him, appeared as if he’d aged several lifetimes in the span of a few minutes. Then he leapt gracelessly to his feet, nearly tripping over the coffee table and careening briefly into Natasha, who reached out and steadied him with Thor’s help.
“What happened to her?” Steve heard himself laugh, a humourless, agonized sound that tore at his throat on its way out.
“I hope this isn’t all for nothing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How do you deal with this? The guilt and the fear and…I just left that guy there! He could have died, and it would have been all my fault
Aside from the memorial, Strange had made himself scarce after Tony’s not-death, but some part of Peter still found itself entirely unsurprised to have the guy strolling into his apartment through a portal where the wall should have been. (Peter was too young, wasn’t he, to be getting numb to this kind of stuff? Would it ever feel cool again instead of just kind of exhausting?) Harley, at least, toppled off the table where his feet were propped and landed on the floor with a shout.
“Why are we here, Tony?”
, for goodness sake. If he couldn’t trust her then he was always already lost. Plus the way Steve was staring at her, wide eyes clouded with some mix of fury and grudging respect (Tony was more than familiar with that particular expression) made it imminently clear that she had not informed him this was part of her plan. He nodded, and she smiled back, that secret, toothy smile he’d only ever seen her direct at him. “Good. Now I can go or stay, whatever you need, but I think your partners deserve an explanation of what’s going on before you make this decision. You’ve promised me that they haven’t harmed you in any way, and so I think we can agree that they deserve your honesty about why this isn’t working. Yes?” He nodded again, and his eyes met Steve’s for the first time.
“You sure ‘bout that? You didn’t seem to want much of anything to do with him last night, and then decided the best way to go this morning was to scream at him for wearing a shirt that he chose, not to hurt anyone, but probably because it brought him comfort after the hell it sounds like he’s been through. And to top it all off, you screamed at him in a tone that could have, probably
“Easier?” Tony scoffed, just barely remembering to add a, “Sir?” Steve chuckled again, this time leaning right down so that Tony could feel his breath against his neck, and oh god Tony wanted to live in that sound, he really, really did.
Tony had been fairly sure he was pretty much out of headspace when Steve had panicked that morning. Seeing Steve, who had been so confident and calm the night before, clearly terrified and full of regret had been like a yank right out of subspace and into something more akin to the adrenaline-fuelled mindset of battle. All that had mattered then had been meeting the objective: fixing whatever was going so wrong in Steve’s head, twisting a night that had been as close to perfect as any Tony could remember into something ugly and wrong.
“But I can’t, it might be decades before I’ll be where he was as a sub. I might
“Do you people even need me down here?” Tony wondered, realizing several seconds too late that he’d spoken aloud.
The lemonade recipe Banner bases his upon calls for:
“Pepper, if this is some kind of press thing, building up good will or whatever—”
“JARVIS said you’re working on getting your caloric intake closer to what it actually should be for your metabolism. I went the old fashioned way and just quadrupled what i would usually get for your order. Now tell me, what had you looking so pissed off when I got to SHIELD?” Steve sighed and took a massive bite of one of the stack of hot dogs. (It really was delicious.)
An interesting question worth exploring from the limited perspective of Stark himself. They did, indeed, inform Stark he had done well numerous times, but as you’ll see, that doesn’t mean they’re not working through the implications of the scene themselves.
“I’m pretty sure Tony has rules about your knives around his tech,” he ventured. Steve realized too late that he probably should have made more noise on his way in, but Natasha’s over-trained reflexes had apparently grown used to living at the team at last because the weapon in her hand did not go whizzing past Steve’s head or into one of his limbs.
“Did he know? Your—did he know, what you did to his parents? Before he put that arm on you, did you tell him? Did Steve?” The air compressor Barnes had recently used to clean You’s rear vent nearly slipped from his hand. His head stayed bowed for a few seconds longer, but then he raised it to look Tony squarely in the face. (For the first time, he regretted how little he had known of Barnes in his own world. Reading his expression was virtually impossible.)
Sadly, I am still forced to supply my own groceries. Wong never purchases the right kinds of cheese.
"We have a new problem. Tony asked me about marriage the other day. He tried to couch it as a matter of interest kind of thing, but I’m pretty sure based on that that it wasn’t. This means something to him.” Phil rocked back on his heels, stunned, and saw his own feelings mirrored on the expressions of pretty much everyone in the room.
“I think the idea of not having to grieve the other Tony publicly makes me feel an incredible sense of relief.” Pepper nodded in silent encouragement, which was good because Tony was rather too stunned by this statement to so much as blink. “It’s…everything with him, especially between he and I, it was so intensely public. I loved him publicly, I lost him publicly, practically every second we had together was filtered through a hundred people’s cameras and tweets and news articles. When I thought about getting the chance to mourn him with only the people who knew and loved him best, that felt really freeing.”
Finally, Bruce and Tony experiment with some more direct submission (rather than the more theoretical/academic discussions we've mostly seen Tony have in this verse so far.) I consider it a clearly negotiated and consensual scene, but I also realize that there can be variations in what each person considers adequately negotiated kink. As always, take care of yourselves and feel free to ask questions if you need clarification or redactions.
Natasha came up to meet him when the session was over as she often did. She was carrying a bag of take out that smelled absolutely heavenly (he was almost positive it was from the Italian place on Bleeker that was one of Steve’s favourites, and his stomach growled approvingly), but she jerked it out of his reach when he made a grab for it.
escape this situation if he wanted to was enough to take Tony from overwhelming panic to just plain anxiety, which was a huge bonus. Tony could still
“No, I mean—no, I’m still not going.”
From behind them, someone else sucked in a sharp breath.
“So you can help?” Steve clarified, trying not to hold his breath. Pepper grinned.
out of laundry detergent again because that’s what happens when you insist on using three pods per load…he’s done it all there without a single second of concern for the information being compromised.
Steve had attempted to give them some privacy for the bath, but Tony made quiet noises of protest every time Steve got more than a couple of feet away from him. So he sat on the floor, keeping up a gentle prattle about what was happening and what their next steps would be and interspersing it all with ample praise.
Steve laughed and settled into his bed, fully prepared, definitely excited, bordering on elated, by the possibility that this might take all night.
Given that he hasn’t spent any significant time inside Ned’s room in over a year, it should feel more startling than it does for Peter to wake up there. And perhaps this might have been the case if Ned’s Mother, overjoyed by Peter’s sudden and inexplicable return, were not flooding the apartment with the sounds and smells of her cooking. No one could cook a breakfast feast like Mrs. Leeds. The combined adrenaline and intense feelings of the day before had Peter half prepared to charge down the hall and stuff his face full of sausages before Ned could wake up and be in competition for such precious resources. This would, of course, be a real dick move given their extremely recent reconciliation, but he still let himself fantasize about diving headfirst into the pan for a good half a minute before he reached up from the pillow-nest he’d made on the floor to nudge Ned.
“Want me to return the favour?” Steve offered. As he’d anticipated, Thor shook his head; when he was nearing the end of a scene, Thor usually chose to avoid orgasm. He found that staying hard helped head off the worst of his drops, which could otherwise be quite severe once he was released from bondage. “Alright. You did beautifully, darling. I’ve just realized I left that case of juice you like upstairs after movie night, so I’m going to run up and get it, okay? I won’t untie you until I get back, and then I won’t leave again. We can stay together for the rest of the day. Sound good?”
“So for that or whatever reason, his universe’s team didn’t spend much time together before Ultron. Steve, I think you’re the one he’s talked to the most about that?” Steve took a long swig of someone else’s beer and sighed.
Suspension bondage, one of the more intensive and dangerous forms of Shibari, had therefore been on Thor’s dream list for ages. Steve had always meant to learn, but there was always some crisis or another, and then after Tony…well, he’d never gotten around to it. One of the goals Steve had set with Dr. Domen, however, was putting more active, focused effort into strengthening his relationships in the present, so he had spent several days practicing (with the gleeful help of Clint, whose comfort with heights and experiences in the circus made him an ideal test subject.)
“Horny,” Tony said reflexively (and because it was true.) Bruce chuckled and then pulled lightly at his hair again. “I…after a while it made other kinds of touching feel bigger, better. Like my skin was more sensitive to everything. It got to maybe be too much toward the very end, but before that I guess I felt…proud, I guess. That I could do that for you. I…Bruce, please, ‘m not even making sense here, put me outta my misery man—” Bruce stepped forward between Tony’s legs, using his grip on Tony’s hair to pull his head against Bruce’s chest. His shirt was soft and silky, and he smelled like chemicals from the labs and the natural deodorant he wore.
Awkwardness over Iron Man aside (he really was just going to have to suck it up and get the suit repaired one of these days), it was a relief to step through the doors of SI. During the extensive negotiations he’d gone through with the team about all the 24/7 stuff they wanted to try, he had been pretty insistent on having a full day off from all of it—the check-ins, the pictures, the food, he’d asked for one day a week where none of it happened, and the team had been happy to honour the request. No one had even gotten on Tony’s case about double-fisting coffee and an energy drink this morning.
Tony as Peter's AI is a comics-inspired choice based on a storyline from the (excellent) Ironheart series.
“I’m not remotely concerned about the safeword and I think you know that. I’m worried about this, though, and about the fact that you kept all the things you were feeling about Domming for Tony from everyone.” Tenderly, he wiped away a bead of blood that had formed on Bucky’s lip from the pressure of his teeth, and smiled sadly at the fear he could see in his friend’s eyes. “You’re not going backwards, Buck. Recovery isn’t a complete and total thing. There are going to be slip-ups and bad days and that’s okay, but we gotta stay on top of this so it doesn’t turn into something worse, okay?”
“Oh just promise to send some extra money toward their hockey teams and maple syrup and they’ll be eating out of your hand.”
He let his handshake with Fletcher go on the longest. While visibly into his mid-sixties at least, the guy had the overly smooth, oiled skin typical of so many of his peers who, like the aristocrats of centuries before, liked to showcase the absence of manual labour from their lives. Tony had never trusted hands like these, whose owners took pride in their distance from the processes of building and breaking all the while benefitting from those labours. It was the one thing, looking back, that he still agreed wholeheartedly with Howard about: if you weren’t willing to get down in the mud and learn how everything worked, right down to the last circuit or bolt or screw, then you had no business sticking your name on the outside of the building. When Tony finally allowed himself to extricate his hand from Fletcher’s quite literally slimy grip, he had to fight the urge to wipe his palm on his pant leg, but the other man’s smug satisfaction at being singled out for attention was evident.
It felt sort of like he was a grouchy god they were trying to appease with tributes. But they were also sort of delicious tributes, and before he totally knew what was happening, he’d been herded towards the living room by a pleasantly chattering version of all these people who seemed to know Tony, even this unfamiliar version of him, far better than he knew them. There was a long awkward moment where several of them stared at an oversized purple pillow on the floor in front of the couch. (Maybe the other Tony had been neater than he was? He hadn’t even been the one to put it there, but whatever…) He was in the middle of picking it up and settling it onto a space-gray armchair when JARVIS announced Barnes and Rogers’ arrival.
“I’m saying I want to give you back the choice, Tony, or as much of one as we can. We have a few days until the press conference. I’m suggesting we—” Steve swallowed, just barely, passed the lump in his throat. “I’m suggesting we put things between us on hold. You spend those days however you need. Try to find a way back to your own universe if that’s what you want. Stay here, don’t leave the Tower, and spend it all eating ice cream and remembering the things you lost. Journalling is—well I’ve found it effective, anyway. Whatever you need, just let yourself be selfish for once and just
“Some branches of government and religion tend to imagine that their God cares very much what goes on in people’s bedrooms. Anyway, the next part is even murkier, but I’m guessing that after Tony came back, Fletcher realized that their original plan to pit SI against Steve wasn’t going to work. People love Steve and Tony too much to be okay with Tony’s company actively opposing Steve’s. They needed a cover, and I think Melissa Collins was invited today because CNOW was supposed to provide that. SI wouldn’t be coming out against Steve or SHIELD then, just in favour of ‘healthy’ traditional orientations. Only Tony apparently saw her in the building, put all of this together and acted first, effectively declaring open war.”
“Steve.”
“And then what? He decided against it?”
“It…really you. Banner try explain, dead-not-dead….Hulk not understand.” Hulk hung his head with this admission; he wasn’t nearly at the intelligence level of the Hulk-Bruce combo that Tony had teasingly called ‘Professor Hulk’ one or twice, but clearly he took pride in Bruce’s efforts to teach him about the world. He didn’t want to have to confess to failing.
“Also backwards,” Tony agreed. “But he needs the Dominance more than he’s been getting it lately.” Bucky arched a brow and crawled his way to Phil. Coulson, who had been laughing seconds ago at the subs’ antics, now wore a wide-eyed, animal-in-headlights expression. Steve, who had been on the other end of Bucky’s disapproving stare more times than he could count, winced in sympathy even as he wanted to dig for more information about what Tony had said. Had Phil really been needing more than he’d been getting?
Steve’s Dominant instincts were near enough to the surface that he thought nothing of glancing at the holoscreen Tony had in front of him, attempting to find the source of the man’s unease. It didn’t occur to him as a violation of privacy at all until he recognized the document for what it was: a standard contract, of which Tony had filled out very little. By the time Steve had hastily averted his eyes and made to dart toward the fridge, Tony had caught him looking. He slid off the island with a slight wince, landing in front of Steve and jabbing a finger in his direction.
“You back the fuck off! He’s ours. Now the two of you just come in here, fucking break him and then won’t even let us in to try to help him—”
Tony wouldn’t have counted her among that bunch anyway, though she definitely still took every opportunity she could to throw a curveball or two his way. Her last piece had been a thorough and thoughtful dissection of SI’s labour policies, and had ultimately argued that anyone employed by a business owned by an active Avenger deserved hazard pay. Pepper, it turned out, had agreed, and implemented the changes several weeks after the article came out. The two women had even had a one-on-one sit down which he was pretty sure had gone well. (He should really catch up with Pepper sometime soon…)
“Why?” Phil demanded to know. It would have been a rather disheartening inquiry except for the way it was abruptly edged tight with hunger. Having that kind of effect on these people would never, ever get old.
“He was never very comfortable with the fact that I had money. Even when he warmed to the rest of me, that aspect of my life…I always got the impression that he sort of liked me in spite of the whole billionaire thing.” Steve looked like he wanted to say a great many things, but in an uncharacteristically controlled move, he nodded and took a pointed bite of his burger in a silent invitation for Tony to keep talking. “In the end I don’t think he and I really ever knew each other all that well. We started to, after the Snap, but so much at happened by then. I think maybe it always would have felt sort of bittersweet.” He gusted Steve’s shoulder with his own. “What about you? Am I…do I remind you of him a lot?”
“Steve, please, Sir, m’gonna, ummf, please you have to help me,” he tried to warn his Dominant. The others seemed to take such deep pleasure in restricting his orgasms, he didn’t want to come without Steve’s permission, he couldn’t couldn’t couldn’t. The crop hit landed far up his leg that he felt the air currents on his dick as it passed; he screamed as the dildo slammed into his prostate far harder than he’d intended.
“Peter…”
“This isn’t working. Would you agree?”
“Honestly, I’m worried you’ll tie yourself in knots if I explain too much at once. Can we compromise, make the call on a day-to-day basis? Today what I’d like is to have you kneel for me until you start to feel any kind of discomfort, so I can determine whether or not the subtonin is impacting your joints at all. Does that sound like something you feel up to?”
“Sorry not sorry!” Natasha chirped. “Have you
I'VE MISSED YOU ALL SO MUCH! I've never had such an erratic posting schedule as I have for the last year or so, and while life is just gonna do what it's gonna do, I always feel so much better when I'm active in fandom. Love y'all. Thanks for sticking with me! We're nearing the end on this one, but if you follow me on Tumblr, you know there are another two fics in the works. Plus I'll be doing Marvel Trumps Hate again this year. And I launched a new Iron Man podcast! So many things.
“No, Dummy, not that mug, it’s not nearly big enough—what is it for a doll’s tea party or something? Where’s the other one, the black MIT one that I stole from Rhodey?”
that easy on the rest of us post-punishment. Just sayin’,” Bucky drawled.
Before he knew it, Tony was pacing the shop with the battle protected from five angles on five different holosceens. He was midway through attempting to convince Rhodey to bring one or more of the mutant owls back to the Tower with him when JARVIS interrupted, something that sounded like alarm in his voice. (And fuck everyone who didn’t think JARVIS was capable of emoting.)
So I have cried writing three chapters of this story, and this was one of them! But I'm happy with how it turned out, and I hope you all enjoyed it too!
“It’s after eleven Rhodey—” she started, then bit off the rest of the sentence with an aggrieved sigh. (On the rare occasions that Pepper was tired and close enough to her own headspace to pout, she and Tony had very similar jutting bottom lips. Rhodey would take this knowledge to his grave.) “Fine. I’ll call her.”
Tony tried to imagine what it had been like for Mark II to use it. Had it been something routinized? Had he always taken time to kneel at ten in the morning or something? Nah, that didn’t feel right, at least not to Tony. If it were him, he’d want something more spontaneous. He’d want to be able to get off the phone with a grumpy investor or emerge from the shop after a spectacularly failed attempt at a new project, grab the pillow and just…surrender. Hand it all over to someone else for a while, the way he’d watched Coulson quite literally offer up his worries to Natasha.
“Welcome home, Steve.”
Clint had frowned at that, but let it go in favour of leading Tony from the elevator and onto the thirty-first floor of Avengers Tower. In his own world, Tony was pretty 31 had been one of a number of floors that provided conference and meeting space, and nothing he could see about the floorplan here seemed radically different.
This would be a challenging chapter to redact, but if any of these areas sound like they might be triggers for you, pop me a note in the comments and we'll figure something out.
“I am
As the battle went on, the confusion and fear grew amongst Taskmaster’s team. They convinced themselves constantly that they were seeing various members of the team, especially Tony, usually several levels away from where those people actually were. At one point, a particularly hysterical member of the force declared that Tony must have created ‘techno-ghosts,’ and that none of the Avengers were actually present at all. Steve felt almost bad for the guy when Bruce, who hadn’t even needed to Hulk out yet, easily took him down just by yelling ‘boo’ and then cracking him on the head.
He is so used to the sarcastic, biting version of Gwen that hearing the almost lyrical and entirely genuine way she read the passage was a bit unnerving. Also unbearably beautiful. He didn't look away the entire time she spoke, or for several long beats afterward. And then he found himself turning just enough to bare his neck in submission.
buying us a condo, Tony Stark.”
“The last thing I said—well, I made an attempt at Rhodey and Pepper’s names but I was pretty far gone by then—the last full sentence I managed in my own universe was ‘I am Iron Man.’” Steve’s entire ribcage contracted like he’d just been punched, but he said nothing for which Tony felt pathetically grateful. “I tried, a couple times, to separate us, but in that moment I could see so clearly how hopeless it had always been to wish to get to be just Tony Stark again. It was just like I’d said before: the suit and I are one. So when I woke up here, somehow miraculously not dead, I felt like this was my chance. This time I could finally let Iron Man die, and for a while that seemed like the best fuck you to every circumstance that had brought Thanos to Earth in the first place.”
Tony got enough rich boy jokes without indulging in his fondness for classical music very often, but he didn’t have it in him to protest. So much classical music was beautiful because it was math, after all, and the symmetry of this particular piece was imminently soothing even despite its somewhat aggressive tone. Bruce’s fingers tapped out an accompanying rhythm in 6/8 time against Tony’s side, and he sighed happily, letting his body sink into the couch.
Tony didn’t intend what happened next. He panicked, pure and simple. He had no reason to think that his relationship with the Soul Stone would show up on a routine blood panel—it certainly hadn’t in his own world—but what if it was different here? What would they do if they found out he was not only not oriented the way that was natural for them, but that Tony shouldn’t even exist by the laws of nature? He had barely come to grips with it himself; there was no way that whatever was between them would survive it. Plus if they took his blood, got their hopes up that Tony might be like them, only to get let down for a second time…nope, nope, nope. He’d end up as a SHIELD lab experiment if he was lucky.
There is also a brief flashback to D/s Tony struggling with similar issues (specifically, with having a team member who isn't Steve administer a punishment while Steve is away.) Anyone with triggers regarding the use of painplay, discipline, or their use to aid in addressing real life issues, I would definitely advise giving the entire chapter a miss.
If you need a redacted version or have questions, feel free to let me know. As always, take care of yourselves!
I know some of you have been waiting for this entire story to see representations of non-sexual submission. I hope it was worth the wait! I absolutely love hearing from you, so feel free to let me know any fave moments/lines, questions, wishes for future chapters, I gobble it all up with delight.
“I know he doesn’t need it for his health anymore, but I still don’t like the image of just placing it  on a random piece of furniture when he hands it to us.” Steve peered again at the half-shaped wood next to the reactor, and arched a brow. It was taking the shape of a square, he thought, and one far larger than the reactor alone would require. Then he looked back at Natasha, who quickly averted her gaze. The other shoe dropped. “This is supposed to hold a collar, isn’t it?”
Sorry for the one day delay, but as we're getting pretty close to the end of the story, I wanted to be extra sure I was happy with the chapter before I posted.
“Yeah, sweetheart. I’m right here.”
“Hey kid. How are those applications coming?”
Tony slept for close to two hours. He decried Rhodes’ ‘witchcraft’ when he woke, but stopped mid-sentence when he realized whose lap he had found himself in. Bucky, who had energetically debating cooking shows with Clint just seconds before, had gone stiff; he probably would have beat a hasty exit out of the room if it wouldn’t have sent Tony tumbling to the ground in a heap.
That discovery had been a new one just this morning. Tony had attempted to gain entry to Steve’s floor for the fourth time, and had been denied yet again. Whatever else he and Steve had been to one another, the guy had never just straight up refused to see him. Tony had stood at the threshold to the elevators, pondering whether it was worth breaching Cap’s trust to use his override codes, when he’d felt a heaviness against his wrist. Not painful, not too heavy, just sort of insistent. Like it wanted Tony to know it was there. (Oh great. Now he was anthropomorphizing a watch. These people were truly going to ruin him.)
The only other Dominant on the Avengers is Bruce Banner, classified at an 8.
I should also stress that I would also count reading the numerous other wonderful fics set in D/s verses as a form of research too. AtomicFrond’s “Stiletto” is an absolute masterpiece of D/s world building, and I learned a lot from it especially about how to incorporate explanatory details into the actual narrative without derailing it; same with TheKinkyPet’s “Power and Paradox,” which makes amazing use of paratexts like news articles to enrich the reader's sense of the world. I try very hard, of course, to never draw too heavily from just one story, so I read widely within the D/s tag, but those are a couple that have definitely left a mark on my own writing.
Ned’s might have been trembling when he grasped the suit in both hands, but that didn’t stop him from stretching and pressing with all the interest and curiosity of a true nerd. Peter watched with an aching kind of fondness in his chest. He even offered the occasional comment about some of the features he’d installed while trying not to overwhelm his friend’s quiet exploration. Finally, as if some kind of dam had broken, Ned grinned and stuck the mask over his face with a delighted exclamation.
Tony hadn’t been considering it, not really. He didn’t even know if the version of the suit stored in the housing unit he wore could even be repaired; if not, he’d be starting from scratch, which would take weeks given that the Tony on this side hadn’t done much with nanotech yet. But he waited for Coulson to explain with as neutral an expression as he could manage.
“No. It’s nothing like that. I just, I wanted to check in. See how you were doing.”
“You’re a real fan of the passive voice, aren’t you?” Reaching distantly for long-forgotten grammar lessons, Tony blinked back his incredulity.
“He’s completely covered in blood.”
“You didn’t fill out much of the first page of the contract. I get it, I have a hard time with that one too, but there’s some things I need to know to be able to proceed. So I’m going to ask you some questions, alright? You always have the option not to answer, but without answers to some of them there’s not much more we can do today. Understand?” Tony nodded, but some part of him knew even as he did it that he wouldn’t get away with another non-verbal response. Clint shook his head. “Try again. That’ll be Yes, Clint or No, Clint.”
“Oh not at all, not at all! Have a seat, I’ll go grab another round; I certainly need the jolt today!”
“Ask me.”
Your comments, kudos and questions remain wonderful bright spots even on more challenging days. Thanks to all of you who make this fandom such a wonderful home to keep coming back to, and I hope you're all staying safe and well!
“Mine lady, the son of Coul gave us strict instructions—”
And speaking of questions, remember you can #AskStrange too! The Doctor didn't have any work to do after chapter two and we can't gave him getting too complacent...
What followed was the frantic pre-mission action Tony had once been all too familiar with. Everyone departed to their own floors to suit up, then trailed back to the penthouse muttering about lost arrows, Widow’s Bites still sized for Thor from the previous training exercise, and whether or not anyone remembered why Thor would have stored his mystical hammer under the couch. There was a weight to this preparation; this team knew what it was to come home from a mission minus one member, after all. But there were also jokes and aiding with zippers and exchanges of power bars while Coulson briefed them on the specifics. The threat itself was relatively benign—a gang of giant and genetically manipulated owls the science team of a major corporation had attempting to use to deliver mail ala Harry Potter had escaped and were spewing questionable foam everywhere—but the birds had dispersed enough that the authorities were requesting the presence of the entire team, including Rhodey who was going to ditch a meeting to join the team uptown. None of the Avengers seemed to fully realize what this meant until Phil caught sight of Tony out of the corner of his eye and stopped mid-sentence.
“I did. I tried. It uh…I’m not always great with words.”
“I’d also be happy to talk you through any of it personally, Tony, just say the word. My wife and kid barely know who I am anyway,” Richards, another signatory on the almost-open letter assured him. (Try to turn him against Pepper and Cap more like…it really was annoying how predictable these people were turning out to be in every universe.)
“Well, primarily because you are effectively just beginning to accept that your previous partner died. You are
“I mean, I do get shot at a lot less when I’m out of all of your proximity. But I also have a pretty kick-ass concealer,” Sam fired back, lifting a bottle of beer Clint had pretty clearly intended for himself out of his hands and taking a long sip from it.
Today the directions didn’t feel annoying, they felt stabilizing. The rules were clear and simple and Steve was telling him precisely what they were, leaving no room for Tony to worry he’d screwed up somehow. Once they were arranged on the couch to Steve’s satisfaction (both still naked, but covered by Tony’s heavy blanket and surrounded by a wall of pillows)  Steve hand-fed him tiny sandwiches on gluten free bread and what felt like an endless selection of fruit.
The soft transparency of Tony half in subspace from the day before was long gone, which meant that without Tony’s typical verbalizing of his in-process thoughts, Steve was lost in his attempts to predict the other man’s response. After what felt like innumerable seconds, Tony walked up the length of the theatre and held his hand out. Awkwardly, Steve went to shake it, but Tony wrinkled his nose, jerked his hand backward and pointed to the Korean.
“It’s different, though. There was nothing wrong with—I mean, you loved him.”
“Never. Wanna stay here like this, Sir, please, please, you can’t leave me, you can’t ever stop.”
“You’re very welcome to be here as long as you like, James. Actually, we were going to wait until Tony was back to bring this up, but we were wondering…look, I know your dynamic with Tony isn’t romantic or sexual, but he clearly does well in your hands, and if you don’t mind me sayin’, you seem a lot more relaxed too. We’d be happy to have you around more, with full permission to act as a Dom for Tony whenever you both want or need. And as long as we wouldn’t be taking you away from anyone else—God, I don’t even know if you’re seeing someone. I’m sorry, I’m a little scattered, I think.” Rhodes shifted in his seat, and seemed to look everywhere but at Steve for a few moments. (Steve had never once seen the guy flustered before. It was kind of unnerving.)
“Good morning. Anything you want to talk about today?”
Ah Rhodes. He does, in this universe as in all others, carry most of the Avengers’ collective brain cells. It is a pleasure to deal with his thoughts rather than Rogers’ or Stark’s for a while.
“Oh, are you new here? Haven’t seen you around for ages.” Then she strode across the room and made a show of surveying Steve from head to toe. “You're more relaxed than I think I’ve ever seen you. It’s a good look, Director.”
statements, Steve. I think, I feel, I believe.” Steve’s jaw got that stubborn set to it that meant he was about to do or say something imminently foolish, but Pepper glared again, and he huffed but took several long breaths and a swig of water from the glass in front of him before answering.
Ice cubes
“We didn’t mean to—“
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch—”
“…okay. Was I, were he and Sam close or something?”
“Yeah, she’s pretty cool. I’ve never heard anyone describe things the way she does. There’s this bit about—well it’s about love and touching and stuff, but it’s not just, it’s…” Peter trailed off with a hopeless groan. He flipped frantically through the text to find the passage before Gwen walked away disgusted. Disgusted that, by all appearances, he was using an extremely obvious come-on from a book that clearly meant a lot to her. When he finally found what he was looking for, she seized the book and began to read before Peter could change his mind.
Dummy let out a string of high-pitched celebratory beeps that would have been hilarious if Steve’s heart hadn’t been lodged in his throat. Tony sat frozen across from him, his mouth still hanging slightly open.
“I wanted to provide you with some context before you speak to Sir, as I do not believe he is in the best shape to provide you with a clear account of what has happened.” Steve assented, trying not to permit too much of his impatience or anxiety to bleed through. “Sir recently learned of the existence of Ultron, and it has greatly disturbed him. He has not spoken in much depth, but from what I have been able to gather, the Ultron experiment was not a successful one in his own universe.”
There is no final examination in this course, because it’s bad pedagogy (
*So-called ‘true’ dominants and submissive (those with a 1 or 10 ranking) are extremely rare.
Content Notes: The third ask contains a discussion of Tony's experiences with starvation.
May was obviously still conflicted and extremely confused, but much as with Peter, her combined relief and exhaustion seemed to win out. After another threat about what would happen if any harm came to Peter—this one much more graphic and genuinely intimidating—May consented to the meeting the next day and disconnected the call. She hadn’t asked for any specific proof that Tony was who he said he was, but he ducked into the guest room and turned the lighting up just enough to snap a picture of Peter, which he sent to May along with his full contact information.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Jay, call May Parker. Use the contact information from Natasha’s file.”
this way. I didn’t know it could ever feel like this…it’s like—like I’ve been running races my whole life with a permanently sprained ankle, and it had always been that way so I didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to hurt that badly and be so much harder for me than all the other runners until the pain was just…gone. I submit to her all day at work, the same way all of her subordinates do, and that feels easy and right and natural. When we go home I can submit if I want to, or not, and sometimes I don’t feel like it for days at a time at home and that’s okay, I can have that without feeling dep starting to creep in. So yeah, maybe if I’d done things a different way I could have found out how to run the races with less pain, the equivalent of like a fancy brace or something, but my damn ankle still wouldn’t be
“I swear to Thor and all his relatives that if you are ratting me out about that damn muffin right now I will sell you for parts.”
“…no, I haven’t been—we’ve been trading off. In case you—or Rhodes or Pepper—needed anything.” And what was Tony supposed to do with such an open demonstration of care? How was he possibly supposed to even comprehend that right now? Natasha turned away without further comment, leading them both to the kitchen. He made a beeline for the coffee pot, but JARVIS intervened.
Before the visit, Steve had filled Sam in on who Tony really was. He didn’t know and hadn’t asked if knowing that this Tony was a different man from his counterpart made it easier or harder for Sam, but when Sam had accepted the invitation to come out to Malibu Steve had mostly relaxed about it, content to let Sam work through and verbalize his feelings on his own time. Until now, when his friend and his partner were staring warily at each other and Steve felt frozen to the spot, unsure of how to make the moment easier on either of them.
If Rogers couldn’t even bear dinner with Tony he personally found this to be a pretty unlikely option, but he made a show out of wrinkling his nose all the same, just to make Natasha laugh (which it did.)
For someone used to treating masturbation mostly as a necessary act of self-maintenance, it required deliberate attention to slow things down. Tony let his hands linger in places he normally avoided—his neck, his nipples, his chest. Even the upraised skin where his scars remained didn’t feel shameful or ugly today, not with Steve watching him wide-eyed focus, as if even the act of blinking was an unthinkable distraction.
One thing I have been working on a lot during symphony has been challenging myself as a writer. Most chapters I set some kind of goal to work on in terms of technique or process. Some of the experiments have been far more successful than others,  and it’s never the aim for those moments to call attention to themselves in a way that takes away from the actual plot, but it’s been a fun way to try to ensure I don’t fall into ruts, which is a real risk when chapters and overall stories are so long.
Whether from embarrassment about having her love-affair with Italian food exposed, or for some other reason, Pepper had quickly shifted the conversation at that point, and Tony had considered the matter dropped until he’d been in the kitchen loading the dishwasher.
“Now now, none of that Sugar Cookie. I know it’s hard for eager ones like you to control themselves, but you already need help focusing on the task in front of you. Don’t want to add in anything that’ll make that harder, hmm?”
I hope it’s alright, dear poster, that I have elected to provide insight from Coulson’s point of view immediately following the scene in the previous chapter! (All the warnings from that scene, particularly those for sexual content, are still applicable here.)
Steve couldn’t recall what, if anything, Tony had actually been looking at, or if he’d had any holoscreens open at all. The next thing he knew, Tony had sprung to his feet mouthing a word Steve didn’t quite catch, and then exited the office in a quiet whirlwind.
They loaded their bowls with cereal. Tony would have guessed Coulson would be a strictly one cereal at a time kind of guy, but he turned out to be a master of combining flavours that should never have worked together, like Reese’s Puffs and Cap’n Crunch. Tony happily followed his lead, and then settled onto the loveseat next to Coulson. Phil kept up a dry commentary about what he’d do if he were the Scoobies’ handler, his suggestions so entirely Agent Coulson of him that Tony very nearly spat cereal onto the floor on three separate occasions. He countered with ideas about their tech, and the unlikely crime-fighting duo potential of Scooby and Dummy. It was exactly the kind of irreverent, fluffy conversation Tony hadn’t realized he’d been missing until Coulson had provided.
Did you all see that pic someone grabbed before the press conference of @Avengers hugging? They’re clinging to each other so tight you can actually see their white knuckles! My heart! #AllLoveisTrue #TraumaIsReal #MoreHugsForTony
“You should ask that question not just of yourself, but about your loved ones as well. Because if I do show you the things I could show you, your next demand will be to have their Dr. Strange deliver messages. Mr. Parker and Mr. Keener, correctly believing you not to be deceased, have been seeking out methods of contact since the battle. Fortunately they do not yet have the skills or knowledge to succeed in their efforts, and my other self suspects they will exhaust their time and resources before they pose any real danger. However, you might consider whether or not it would be kinder to let those around them continue to persuade them, as they are now trying to do, that you are and have always been lost to them.”
He used the trip back up from the medical wing to give himself a brief but thorough talking-to about exerting any degree of Dominance on anyone who hadn’t consented, particularly the near-exact copy of his dead lover who had no way of knowing what any of his small shows of submission were doing Steve. This lasted approximately two and a half minutes, long enough for Steve to exit the elevator, hand the ointment off, and watch Tony awkwardly attempt to angle his body and apply the cream to himself with more wincing and flinching. Steve knocked Tony’s hands out of the way, seized the jar, dropped back to his knees, and began applying a thick layer to the wound himself. Tony stiffened briefly, whether from surprise or pain, and then allowed his arms to fall to his sides and his eyes to close. (Steve had helped. Tony had been in pain, and Steve had found a way to make a difference. He was a good Dom. He hadn’t failed everyone. Hadn’t failed Tony, again.)
“He’s not,” Peter snaps, unable to help himself. “Look, I get it. It sucks, okay? But the fact is he didn’t want to be here. He didn’t care enough to come back. Just accept it man.”
work, so it wasn’t something he would encourage that particular night. Natasha growled something inaudible against Phil’s back, and he would definitely have to follow up on that later, because Natasha never made any noises she didn’t mean to but that particular one had sounded like it had been torn out of her.
“I’m just…having some issues managing stress. Sometimes fieldwork is the best way for me to work through that energy so that I don’t take it out on junior agents who, while they may need a bit of an attitude adjustment, do
“Definitely not too busy. In fact I was just verifying the procedure I’ll need for later when we run the tests for carpal tunnel. But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves, hmm? Come on up here for me.” He patted what appeared to be an innocuous black leather examination chair, with which Tony had grown entirely too familiar over the past several days. Right now it was laid completely flat like a bench, and Bruce waited patiently as Tony clambered up onto it and settled onto his hands and knees. (He’d worn a full suit down the first day, but he’d quickly learned to stick with sweats or jeans. Bruce had absolutely no concept of what a crime it was to wrinkle Tom Ford.)
“Hey, you’re up! There’s coffee in the press, that shit that tastes like dirt that Bruce says you still love—”
Eventually, Steve agreed and made his way to his own floor. Not because he wanted it, but because he had put the team through enough in the immediate aftermath of Tony’s loss. They didn’t need to know how broken he still was, or how he wondered if (maybe even hoped, on the worst days) his body might someday physically give out from the grief. The story they had been telling one another lately, that Bucky had even rehearsed tonight, was that Steve had been doing better lately. And if they were able to convince themselves of that, he certainly wasn’t going to be the one to correct them; they deserved all the comforting fictions he could offer.
? Jesus, Peter, I thought you were in a gang or being—I don’t know, abused by someone at school maybe, or on some kind of weird new drug. Which I guess was actually the closest to the truth, though not something that making you watch those D.A.R.E. videos on repeat was going to help. Why would you not just tell me this?” May cast her eyes about the room again, but this time with far more intent. “Did you tell him not to? Because I’m pretty damn sure it’s illegal to—”
, but he had already learned that attempting to tease Steve about it resulted in a monologue about the value of being able to actually touch something in a world where so much existed primarily in the Cloud. (And the worst part was Steve was so sincere during those kinds of orations that he was entirely oblivious to Tony’s attempts to invite Steve to touch things other than dirty old coins.)
Content Notes: Response 1 contains extremely vague spoilers about the eventual future of this universe.
Between Talia’s hostility and the fact that Steve always forgot how much a part of him would always hate flying until he was in the air, he was really starting to agree with her that he should have stayed home. He gripped the leather armrest of his seat harder, grateful at least that it was a private plane. SHIELD had a policy (Steve himself had instated) of not sending out proprietary tech like quinjets on inter-agency missions—it just tended to cause too many headaches—but Tony had purchased more than one private jet and ‘donated’ it to SHIELD, claiming that Steve had faced enough of the horrors of the new century and did not need to be subjected to coach.
“That…that might work. Don’t get in a rush about it, alright, because I still have a lotta concerns, and there’s probably no way the team lets me get out of all this without checking back in with my shrink. But it’s…I would trust Stevie to keep you safe, even from me if he had to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fletcher,” Tony agreed. “I did tell you that I knew I'd read his name somewhere. The report was buried deep in SI's systems, but I came across it briefly when I was rooting around trying to find blackmail material to make the Board back off Pepper. I didn’t do more than check the title, I swear, and I didn’t know what I was seeing at the time. But that’s gotta be why SI is so against the pilot program at SHIELD, too—too much of a chance that their prior knowledge of this is going to come out of the woodwork.”
Steve was a lucky man, he reflected as he watched Bruce walk away, and not just because of the submissive waiting for him in his bed.
Thus had begun the even more extended journey of reaching out to independent leather workers. This had been the most contentious aspect of the process thus far. Nearly everyone had connected with someone that another team member had vetoed, for various reasons: Natasha hadn’t liked the extent to which one of the candidates was a fan. Thor, in an overprotective fit, had dismissed another for suggesting that certain designs wouldn’t look good on Tony. There had been numerous heated discussions, and toward the end Phil had really started to wonder if their ‘all for one’ policy might end up failing them this time.
The second 'vision' involves a portrayal of D/s Tony being outed as a sub without his consent or (much) prior knowledge. Again, avoid this vision if this is a triggering area for you.
Despite that one moment of weirdness, Peter spent most of the weekend so delighted by his reunion with Ned that he forgot to give Gwen and her performance much thought until it came time for decathlon practice on Monday. They were scheduled to be practicing for the interview portion in pairs, but Gwen—Peter’s assigned partner—was nowhere to be found.

“Yes, I believe he could have. At the time he did not want to risk the fate of the universe, but in that I suspect he was incorrect. Knowing the sacrifice you would need to make would not have changed your actions. It is why I am here instead of being conveniently off-world, as Wong and others have urged me to be.”
do so.”
Peter took this in silently, still petting Butterfingers. Then he smiled. It was a hesitant, fragile thing, but it was there.
This all made perfect sense, and Peter hadn’t thought it was possible to feel more humiliated, but here he was. Maybe he should text Aunt May and get her to send over some of his baby pictures or something, just to really make things as dire as possible.
For a while after that Steve just held him, murmuring praise and filth and love that felt like a blanket covering Tony and protecting him even from his own ability to think. Stave made him drink a whole bottle of water, too, and every once in a while he would toy with Tony’s soft cock, seeming unbothered when Tony could do nothing but shudder and shake. When he had finally recovered enough to start to respond to the touches, it started all over again, just as Steve had promised.
Tony flushed, but he didn’t contradict the bombshell Clint had just dropped. Meanwhile Steve searched his own feelings, and found nothing pride in Tony for opening himself up this way, as well as a vague sense of excitement. This was something entirely new for all of them, something that couldn’t be compared to the other Tony (who, despite having spent years pretending otherwise, had had absolutely zero interest in Domination.) No matter how interested in ever Dominating again this version of the man turned out to be, Steve reckoned that the novelty of it would matter greatly to Tony.
That last regretful note was dated right around the time that Tony would have been conceived. Or could he really call what had apparently brought him into the world conception, when really he was a product of the Soul Stone as much as Howard and Maria Stark?
Phil seemed to have gathered as much based on how Tony had requested his time, because when he stood to greet Tony, it was with the bland, bureaucratic air that Tony’s own version of the man had spent most of his time projecting.
“And you’re supposed to be
“But the symbolism alone…I mean, you kind of
It was more frightening than he’d imagined, saying this out loud to Steve. The last time they’d had a genuine disagreement (not a fight borne of simple misunderstanding or emotional overload, like the one when Peter had been hospitalized), another version of the man had put his shield through Tony’s chest. But his arms didn’t fall away from where they held Tony fast, and when he spoke his tone hadn’t grown hard or bitter.
“No,” Tony said shortly. He elected, in fact, not to answer pretty much all of Bruce’s usual questions, and refused him permission to view JARVIS’s food logs for good measure. The guy had to be getting frustrated, but he did far better at masking the reaction than Steve had done. Somehow, this made Tony even angrier.
It was everything and nothing like kneeling for the team. The relief of being at someone’s feet, of having clear directions to follow and a guiding hand at his back, that felt largely the same. It helped, too, that Rhodey was hardly just anyone. He might not be Tony’s Dom, but he cared deeply about Rhodey’s approval. He wished he could make some kind of fabric out of the way it felt to have Rhodey tell him he was still good, still loved. None of it produced the corresponding sexual reactions Tony usually had when it was his team holding and supporting him, but he supposed that was proof in and of itself that Tony’s need for this was no longer entirely limited to his romantic relationships. This was a part of who he was now.
“My turn. Please, I need to get this out.” When Tony nodded his assent, Steve pressed on. “I never should have spoken to you the way I did last night. I think I did have a right to be angry, but I know my own hot head well enough that I should have removed myself from the situation or taken a breather or something before I reached the point of yelling or insulting you. I am truly sorry.”
“No.”
“Do…you know it’s—”
“No, Steve, I—”
Clearly, he’d been wrong.
It wasn’t that Tony had ever really doubted how seriously the team took things like safewords and consent. Submissives, he’d been told and had witnessed firsthand again and again, held all the real power. The Dominant took only what they were given, and always had to be prepared to return it; their Dominance became meaningless if not aligned with the needs and desires of their submissive.
, Peter’s unhelpful and entirely too sincere inner-monologue finished. “—help.”
“Do you seriously not—”
Tony talked to himself pretty much constantly when he worked. Half the time he didn’t know what he thought until he was working it out aloud; occasionally he had Bruce to bounce ideas off of, and back in college Rhodey had occasionally been a semi-willing audience to his genius, but for the most part it was a monologue and Tony was just fine with that. Which didn’t make any less novel and exciting to be able to babble and have someone entirely focused only on chattering back, asking questions and making occasional suggestions or comments. Steve’s frequent praise was shockingly easy to accept when it was just part of this larger back and forth.
“Phil set a punishment for the whole knowingly stepping onto an unsecured surface thing. It’s not the first time he’s had to punish me for this, so it’s a particularly hard one, and I. Well. Sometimes after our Tony was gone, I would come up here to do things that were hard for me. I didn’t mean to intrude.”
“Aww Rhodey baby no—”
“Oh fuck
He must also have phoned ahead to warn the restaurant about super-soldier appetites, Steve realized, because the servings of stew that were presented to them were less bowls than they were tureens. Once Steve had made his way through more than half of it and was floating on a happy cloud of sweet potato and habanero, Bucky sat up in his chair and his expression turned serious.
“You can. You are. You’re going to give me everything, because that’s what I want from you.” Bruce kept up the slow massage until he had wrung every agonizing, wonderful drop from Tony. He whined with oversensitivity, and squealed when Bruce pressed down on his prostate like he was ringing a damn doorbell once before sliding his fingers out. “That’s my good, sweet boy. You took your punishment so well, Tony, I’m so very proud of you.”
“Have you and Carol met yet? If you haven’t, you really should. I’m sure she would love the homage.”
A plan was starting to take vague shape in his mind. Steve and maybe Nat, too, were definitely on to him, and he spent most of the time he wasn’t with Pepper or Rhodey dodging invitations and attempted drop-in visits, but he was pretty sure he would be able to manage it before anyone put all the pieces together.
“How’s it going in AI-land today? Have you managed to wrestle control away from FRIDAY?”
Forcing themselves to leave Tony alone after the press conference had been…well, challenging. Coulson, always perfectly disciplined and precisely controlled, had actually growled at Rhodes when he’d made to guide Tony away. Once, that kind of animosity might have triggered something bigger and more fraught, but Rhodes had just rolled his eyes and patted Phil’s shoulder.
“‘m I in trouble?” he mumbled as Clint’s hand slid to his back to guide him to the bedroom. He tried very hard not to think about how much he sounded like a guilty kid while Clint huffed a reluctant laugh.
“Aww, just bring him here,” Steve chuckled, smiling fondly as Tony was deposited into his lap. “Hey there sweetheart. Let’s get you all prepped and ready.” It was nothing he wouldn’t have said normally; if anything, he was a little extra gentle with his tone, as if Tony were something fragile and in need of coddling. It built on the dynamic Bruce and Clint had already established without straying out of Steve’s own comfort zone, and judging from the way Tony shuddered, it worked for him too. Steve slid two fingers easily inside him, taking plenty of time stretching Tony out. “That’s it, honey, just relax for me. Gonna get you all sorted and feeling good, give you everything you need.”
Pepper's living arrangements turned out to be the easy part. She consented heartily to moving into the Tower, provided that her Dominant (Sharon Carter, which, oh boy was Steve coming back to that one later!) would be permitted free access as well. The Tony side of things turned out to be rather more complicated.
James Rhodes is a category 8 Dominant.
I would classify this and all of the sex that'll happen in this story as Risk Aware Consensual Kink, but do be aware that when the team interacts with one another, especially without Tony, there is not always much depicted in the way of negotiation or discussion. They know each other and their limits pretty well by this point, and fully trust that safewords or check-ins will be used liberally when required. (I bring this up because what constitutes under-negotiated kink can sometimes vary among readers.)
like it is here, you know?…god I hate metaphors. They really love metaphors here, everyone’s always telling you something on like five different levels and clearly they’ve infected me.”
When Barnes left and Tony’s heart rate had finally stabilized again, he chanced a look in the bag. It contained a large flat of market-fresh blueberries.
or something.”
“How about you clean us up, sweetheart? We got pretty messy over here watching the rest of you.”
yes.” The words burst from Tony’s lips with more honesty and strength than he’d intended, but he couldn’t find it in himself to regret it once they had. Their experiments in Malibu had been enlightening to say the least; he hadn’t liked all of the tools or forms of pain they’d played with, but he’d loved some of it, both the immediate sensations and the waves of endorphins that came afterward. (God, riding that shit was way better than any drug Tony had ever tried, and he’d tried most of them in one form or another.) Bruce’s answering smile was sharp and heated.
“They say here that they monitor all of the participant’s hormone levels during the trials.” With a lazy kind of grace, Tony flicked open a holoscreen and sent the projection sliding across the room in Steve’s direction. “How do those numbers compare to the baseline during the workday here?”
“Phoenix. Right. Well, there’ll be no risin’ up for you this time, but that’s for the best, hmm? You obviously didn’t come back all right this time. I’ve known it for weeks, tried to convince my ‘sponsors’ to come at you on that front, but well, none of you rich bastards want to take input from the hired help. Anyway, way I see it, I’m puttin’ you outta your misery. The massive payday I’m gonna see is just a bonus, that’s all.”
The last section, meanwhile, contains a bit of a cliffhanger. This is, it feels like a good time to remind everyone, a guaranteed happy-ending kind of a story, but if you're trying to avoid things that might produce even minor anxiety at a hard time, might be best to give the last bit a miss until I can post the next chapter and you can read them together.
When Tony had let himself imagine it in his own universe, he’d always thought kissing Steve would be all brutal, consuming heat: beautiful and near-blinding illumination, but fleeting and wholly destructive, too. (It was unsurprising, really, that when they’d finally broken completely apart the world had followed shortly thereafter.)
Rogers was carrying something, too, and against all logic and common sense, Tony’s stomach gave a lurch. (Had he and this version of Rogers really been better with one another, worked through all their shit and—) He didn’t even have time to finish the thought. Rogers took one look at Tony and
He’d spoken to Pepper on the phone once before going through with the Time Heist. He’d reminded her that he owed the team nothing, that he and everyone else could end up losing more than they already had if something went wrong. He muttered about buying a farm, maybe some alpacas; he knew better than to include Pepper in that vision by now, but it was the only future he’d ever imagined for himself, so he clung to its remnants even without the image of her there beside him.
“That’s fine. You’re responding to some very intimate and difficult questions. It isn’t a mark of weakness or failure to struggle. Can you talk to me about whatever you had? How was Tony’s Steve different from the Steve that’s sitting in front of me?”
“It’s not the same,” he protested. “Peter and I. We’re…it’s not the same.”
been really busy lately,” he observed, allowing the slightest hint of a whine to creep into his tone. Steve made a sympathetic humming noise and kissed his head.
“Is that a hint?” Peter joked weakly, putting a hand in front of his mouth and pretending to smell his breath.
Unlike all the other evenings, Tony didn’t try to argue with him, or force a conversation that Steve wasn’t ready to have. There was only a sigh and a quiet rustle of sheets.
But it bought them the time they needed. When Taskmaster turned around, meaning to taunt Steve with the body of his dead partner, he found only the shell of the destroyed armour on the ground, very clearly empty. For the first time, his ravaged face showed real fear. Steve drank in the sight with sadistic hunger.
He’d done non-sexual scenes with the team before, but he’d still mostly been focused on doing what they wanted, being who and what they needed. This…Natasha and the others, they had given this to Tony just because he’d asked. Because, he realized with a start, he was allowed to ask for things now, and to expect the team to help him get what he needed. He knew himself well enough to know it was a lesson he’d probably have to keep learning, but for right now he let himself feel just a little dizzy with the joy and possibility spreading out in front of him.
“Sure we did. Don’t mean we can’t enjoy some of the ways that you’re different than he was.” Steve’s wholesale rejection of Tony was way too recent for this to be a believable claim. He snorted, but this backfired when Barnes turned to face him for the first time. His mussed hair and lazy posture were at odds with how serious his expression had turned, but Tony could still recognize pretty quickly that this was not the moment to challenge Bucky. “I loved the other Tony with my whole goddamn soul, but that don’t mean he was perfect. None of us are. He was hard. The world had made him that way, and we all understood why, but you never totally knew what might set him off, make him pull away or turn vicious and cold on you, sometimes for days or even weeks at a time. And his submission…yeah, he was a True, and yeah he was gorgeous and wonderful when he went down, but you always felt just a little guilty for putting him there when he hated that he needed it so much. You been through just as much as he had, I think, but it’s shaped you differently. Somehow it makes you want to hope harder, give more of yourself to the people around you. I think that’s fuckin’ beautiful.”
There was an extended debate over the order, but eventually it was decided, and Clint was up first. The archer was as unerring with his aim as ever, but not a single one of his shots managed to get anywhere near Tony; the moment they started sparring in earnest, Tony was flanked by two rows of crescent-shaped extensions to the suit that took each arrow out of the air with ease. One of them didn’t even make it all the way out of Clint’s bow. Near the end of their session Clint was getting close to managing a shot by firing multiple arrows at once, but he was nowhere near even making a dent before the buzzer went off.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve though of the submissive sleeping peacefully upstairs, a man who had chosen them, who trusted them so absolutely as to voluntarily leave himself without the protection of a suit whose entire purpose had been to be with him always. He knew Natasha’s fear, understood the impulse to draw away from all the risks that came with loving and hoping, but Tony had called them his home. As far as Steve was concerned, the rest was mere details.
“All this production over lunch, Brucie bear? I know I’ve got some issues with food stuff, but you don’t actually have to be afraid to give it to me, you know.” To prove his point, Tony ducked his hand over the wrap and made to steal an olive, but found it quickly pushed away. “Okay, see—”
He made his way down to Bucky’s floors, a heavy coat tucked over one arm. The other man sat on a long, padded seat in front of one of the massive bay windows, staring silently out at the grey sky and snowy streets. He seemed stunned to see Tony, which all but confirmed his suspicions.
“Why didn’t you?” she asked in that same almost-neutral tone. It wasn’t an unexpected question, but it was still a challenging one to actually answer.
“But it is so…so petty!” Thor protested. Steve’s enhanced hearing picked up the protesting stretch of leather; Thor was putting too much pressure on the bonds at his wrists. He seemed to realize it too, because before Steve had the chance to remove them or offer a gentle reminder, the noise ceased. “We have a version of our lover, our partner, back. It is more than we could have dared to hope for, and instead of thanking all the Gods, I resent my lovers for the attention they receive? I do not recognize myself in this.”
He came suddenly and violently to full consciousness several minutes later when he was hit in the ribs with enough force to make him gasp. Another blow landed against the side of his head, and it was oddly lucky that Steve’s reflexes were as slowed as they were, or he would have responded with lethal force before he could have registered the familiarity of the dishevelled curls in his face.
“Talia!”
Clint provided Tony with several more choices after that point—sexual or non-sexual scene, Clint’s room or his own—which eventually lead him to where he was now: sprawled spread-eagle across Clint’s bed. The other man currently had his back to Tony as he rustled through the black duffle bag he’d had with him upstairs. At the angle he was at Tony couldn’t see what it was Clint was fiddling with, so he took the opportunity to blatantly scope out the rest of the room. He’d expected a wall of bright purple, but the palette was slightly more refined, grey with pops of bright accent colours throughout. There were some pictures hanging on the wall in orange frames, mostly of the team, and a floating shelf that held a more weathered collection of odd knick-knacks that Tony could only assume were the sole remnants of Clint’s unstable childhood. Nightstands sat on either end of the bed; the one on the side that Tony was certain belonged to Clint was a kind of organized chaos, littered with charging cables and comics and what looked like a small stuffed penguin in no discernible order. The bed was firmer than he’d expected, and was currently covered only in a space grey top sheet. The whole space was youthful without edging into boyish.
On the third night he showed up at Rhodey’s door, his friend took one long look at him and sighed.
“No, it’s not that.” Well, that was mostly the truth. Sure the idea of sitting at someone’s feet or maybe being hand-fed lunch was starting to feel pretty appealing, but Tony could recognize when he was approaching…well, not dep, he didn’t think his system had enough of the bio-chemical elements of submission present yet to respond that way, but he knew what it felt like for his desire to submit to be edging towards ‘need’ rather than ‘want,’ and he wasn’t there yet. But how could he communicate the vague sense of unease and discontent that had crept its way into his mind lately, especially when so much of his life was closer to perfect than he ever could have hoped? “Really, I’m good. Let’s just get this done.”
Tony had about a dozen arguments. Midnight was laughably early, for one, and he hated the fuzzy way that sleep medication made his brain work when he woke up the next day. And exercise? Tony’s brief affair with running had, he was quite certain, directly helped bring about the end of the world in his own universe. Mostly, though, what he felt was sheer relief in Rhodey’s steadfast, no-nonsense attitude and his structured outline of the days to come. His life wouldn’t look the way it used to, it couldn’t if Tony was really going to work this all out, but he wouldn’t face the days alone and unmoored, either.
After a few days, even Bucky had mostly stopped coming by. Bucky mourned Tony, and Steve knew he regretted that the two of them had never had a chance to really make peace about everything that had happened in Siberia. But Bucky, like the others, also wanted to get on with the work of re-making the world and his own life, honouring Tony’s sacrifice by not wasting any more time.
Phil gave no indication that he noticed the war Tony was currently waging against himself. After finishing his cereal and clearing both their bowls off to one side, he tapped one heel against the bottom of the chair. Out popped a drawer from which Phil drew several blankets, including the weighted one that usually resided in the penthouse living room. He wound it around Tony, pulling just slightly as he did so that Tony was drawn flush against his side. It wasn’t quite the same as being at Coulson’s feet, but at least with the heaviness of the blanket combined with Phil’s arm around his shoulders he didn’t feel so unmoored.
The problem came when they trooped back into the house. Almost everyone took a shower (even Steve, who annoyingly didn’t look like he’d ever had so much as a drop of sweat on him), and while most of them did so in pairs or threes to 'save water', it was still past noon by the time they were all finished. Which meant lunch. And Tony so, so was not ready to have to deal with food again so soon.
“I don’t want to work for SHIELD,” she said at once. Then her eyes went impossibly wider, as if she was appalled by her own daring. “It’s not, I mean, no offense Mr. Stark—Iron—Ton—ugh!”
“The Board is planning to leak this on Wednesday. That gives us until Monday or Tuesday at the absolute latest for you all to the let the public know that Tony is…well, here.”
Tony wanted to scream to be put back there, to watch the people he loved forever. He hadn’t even had a chance to see Bruce yet, or Clint or Wanda or Barnes. And what about Carol, and the Wakandan contingent, and those Guardian people, had they all made it out okay? By the time he was in control enough of his muscles to try to make a grab for Strange, however, the other man had left the room, muttering something about giving Tony space.
No real content notes I can think of. As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns!
“Someone’s after Tony. They used today to gather intel, so that Taskmaster and his crew would have the most up-to-date information about how we’re fighting possible. He’s being funded by someone with deep pockets, made specific allusions to some kind of corporate entity.”
