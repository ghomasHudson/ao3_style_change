He draped half his body over Dean’s. Dean moved his head to make space on the pillow. It was nice having that pressure on him, felt warm, felt safe, felt everything the Empty wasn’t. It felt everything Purgatory wasn’t. If he closed his eyes, he could pretend they were somewhere else. Maybe a decent hotel room, memory foam mattress, and those little chocolates on the pillow because Cas could spruce with the millions, he no doubt owned.
“Cassie!” his friend Balthazar shouted, raising a drink in Cas’ direction. Cas made a beeline for him, bumping into people as he went. “Can I interest you in a beverage dear friend?”
Cas opened up more as well, spoke about his life outside of Purgatory though Dean figured it was more a way of deflecting Dean from asking about the Angel Grace and impending riot. Regardless Dean appreciated it, liked seeing behind the curtain of the deadly Russian, see what made him the man Dean knew today.
“Sorry brother.” Benny put his hand on his chest. He was an earnest man. That didn’t help Dean with the situation he had. They had fifty meters left to clean and no water to do it.
“I heard you used to be loud, brave.” Cas ran his hand up Dean’s hair. It made him shiver from the base of his neck down his back. Cas brought up his other hand, ran that through the side of Dean’s hair, brushing his palm over his ear. Dean wanted to lean into it. He had a weakness of people playing with his hair. Always made him go limp.
“Thanks.” He replied groggily. Dean took it, sipping the cold water slowly. When he had enough, he handed it back to Cas who placed it on the sink near him. Another wave hit him, and he hurled the water he just drank along with more of last night’s drink. “Ugh, never drinking again.” he groaned. His stomach clenched, trying to wretch more up that wasn’t coming.
The silent treatment between them continued till one night, a massive storm rolled in. Dean couldn’t sleep, the thunder bellowed in and the lightening lit up the block from all angles. They heard it was going to be a big one from the guards, they didn’t expect it to be this big. Electricity was out. Not that it made much of a difference, Purgatory was so old and run down they were still locked into their cells by keys.
They wait at the crossing for the green man to show. Dean has pressed the button in front of Castiel even though he’s closer to it. He keeps his hand out of his pocket. Castiel feels bold and touches Dean’s hand with his, rubbing the back of his knuckles over Dean’s palm silently asking for something. Dean answers by laces their fingers together and squeezing like it’s nothing when for Castiel its everything. He looks down at it smiling like an idiot.
“Gabriel, honestly its fine I don’t mind paying full price.” He fumbles with his wallet to get out the other two dollars.
The next passing was like the others. Dean with Charlie, playing cards with Charlie’s new deck. He had been learning black jack from the boys, picking it up too easily. Being good at math lent itself well to counting cards. If they were allowed to gamble, Charlie would be raking in the money by now.
Free time here had none of those things, well, he could sleep with something with a pretty smile if he was man enough to go for it. He knew he could get Cas to fuck him. The guy wanted it, that wasn’t hard to decipher but Dean still had his pride and hated that he was owned by Cas even if it was for his own good. His stubbornness was ruining any chance he had of getting laid. He had been close enough to asking for it on more than one occasion, glad he had the pillow or his fist to essentially gag himself with.
Leaning against the door he watched the steady rise and fall of Cas’ chest, how content he looked and comfortable. Dean didn’t have the heart to move him. Looked like they were sleeping upside down tonight.
The guy’s eyes widen at the remark. He can see the tops of his ears pinking. Dean can’t help but smirk, sucking part of his cheek between his teeth. If this guy enjoys catching people out, he challenged the wrong dude. Trench coat stiffens himself up. He wasn’t as tall as Dean but not far off of it when he pulled his shoulder back.
“What time you want us over at?” He picked up Charlie’s bag pack off the ground, swung it over his shoulder and lifted Charlie up too, easier to walk her over the busy road to the park. It seemed not many of the parents walked their kids to pre-school making it dangerous outside. She wrapped her little arms around his neck to hold on.
He’s so beautiful in the mornings. No barriers, no walls are up yet, just pure Dean who indulges in his wants. His hand moves up the center of Cas’ body. Fingers trace collarbones and tendons of his neck. So tactile.
He felt Dean shift, moving around to close the laptop screen shut then collapse on the bed beside Cas. He made no inclination of moving and Cas wasn’t about to tell him too either. Dean moved his head to look at Cas lying beside him. They lay there, just looking at each other. Cas noticed his messed hair, slightly blushed cheeks, eyes hooded, his mouth still shone in the light, filmed in his spit. Painfully beautiful. Cas blamed his afterglow for what he did next, bringing his thumb to wipe Dean’s bottom lip then bringing it up to his own for a taste.
Cas’ chest rose and fell under Dean’s shoe, trying to get his breath back on the tiled floors. He looked like he was debating taking out Dean, which he probably could even now if he tried. Dean pressed a little harder, showing Cas he wasn’t playing, and Cas dropped his head onto the tiles, giving in or at least giving in for this moment. No doubt this would have some repercussions. Dean would deal with them. He was just glad they hadn’t killed each other.
“Yay! I’m so excited!” Charlie beamed a smile at Claire. Her hands went out to her best friend, wanting a hug goodbye. Claire did it too, nearly falling out of Cas’ arms. The Dad’s found themselves leaning in to let their daughters hug it out, making them extremely close to one another. Close enough that Dean could smell sugar off of the man, noticed gold glitter on his neck and what he seriously hoped was chocolate on his jawline. He looked up at the man, noticing his attentive eyes on him, darting over Dean’s cheeks like he hadn’t noticed Dean’s freckles till right now, joining them up one by one. The temperature suddenly got a bit too hot for Dean on this cold day and he pulled his daughter away from her best friend.
Dean didn’t want Cas to fuck him as his prag, now he was going to have to let Cas fuck him to keep his brother alive. He’d do it, of course he would. He’d do anything to keep his brother alive. Balthazar doesn’t give empty threats. He’s killed prisoners for less Dean presumed. It wasn’t like he wasn’t going to enjoy it, not like he hadn’t thought about it before, but he wanted it as equals, maybe that was his stupidity again. He was never going to be equal to someone like Cas.
The decision for mutual orgasms during lock in time was hands down one the best decisions Dean had made since landing himself in Purgatory. Cas had an insatiable appetite, one that Dean was more than willing to keep up with seeing as the Russian tore orgasms out of Dean like no one else could including out in the real world. It was like his celly was made for him, sent by some sex God with a sole mission on making Dean cum at least once a day.
His other hand released as his orgasm built inside of him. He grabbed a handful of Dean’s hair, soft just as he suspected. Dean did too, tugged on Cas’ black mess and Cas cursed aloud. He was becoming a lost cause.
The letter he was writing to his Dad. The letter he never got to send. Not that his Dad would ever get it now. It still stood, he and Sammy were still alive and kicking down in Purgatory, all limbs attached. Though that was probably due to the Russians they effectively sold themselves to.
This is not what Castiel is expecting. The look is almost predatory, primal the closer he gets and Castiel finds himself unable to move backwards anymore as his legs hit the side of Dean’s couch.
“So, let me get this straight,” Dean lifted his hand up to go over the main highlights. He lifted one finger at a time as he spoke. “Gabriel is running the show
“It’s what we are Cassie, heaven’s precious little angels.” Balthazar lines up four more shots of tequila. He spills some onto the table as half of the bottle is in their digestion systems now, the alcohol becoming acquainted with their blood stream.
Gordon stumbled back into the chest of another inmate. Dean’s hands made fists on their own accord, ready for a fight. He did say he needed to punch a wall, punching Gordon would suffice. The inmate shoved Gordon back into Dean, he moved out the way, watched as Gordon fell onto the ground.
Castiel has everything ready. He followed Jessica’s instructions to the last letter. It’s all laid out on his little table in his flat. Dean just needs to be at home, which Jessica assured he would be giving it’s a Wednesday and Dean didn’t work at the Roadhouse on Wednesdays. The Roadhouse being Dean’s other job, hence the late nights coming home. He runs his hands through his hair double checking it once more before going to get Dean.
Saturday’s brings in another wave of customers, the students. Their academic schedules results in them only being able to get to get to the bakery on the weekends seeing as by the time they are free Sweet as Heaven is already sold out. He doesn’t mind seeing some of his students, emphasis on some. The ones who have yet to figure out that he occasionally works here creates the worn-out conversation he is currently having.
He couldn’t really believe what he was hearing. He hadn’t expected this conversation to be like that. He half expected Cas to tell him to get over it, that it meant nothing, that he needed to stop moping around and avoiding him or anything other than Cas admitting that he couldn’t stop thinking about Dean.
He released himself from Cas’ back once the kitchen opened up and less bodies were around them to hide what he had been doing. Cas turned to him, curious to see the look on his face. Dean winked and then was attacked by fellow classmates, lifting Dean up into the air to celebrate the end of exams. Someone threw their arms around Cas too, Balthazar already drunk and pulling Cas away from Dean to have a shot with him. Cas went, he’d get to Dean at some point during the night for the fun he had spoken about.
Claire tugged on Cas’ jeans to get him to look at other ones. The attention span of kids was short. He put the picture back down and followed his daughter to the other ones.
He rolled his thumb over the head of Dean’s cock, eliciting a pearl of precum with ease. A dark smirk grew on Cas’ face watching Dean fall apart under his touch. The boy had collapsed back onto the bed, a hand thrown over his eyes and bottom lip snug between his teeth. It was better than Cas imagined. Dean was wrecked and already chasing Cas’ hand.
They don’t manage to get back to that hot and heavy once their laundry is done. The moment had passed, and Dean’s eyes were starting to droop. Being around Cas as he read was like a sedative for him, constantly being wired and high energy for others it was nice when he didn’t have to emulate that around Cas. He steals a kiss outside of Cas’ front door and they leave it at that.
I'm sorry this took so long! I've gone from studying to a full time job and wow, its super tiring. Anyway, here is the next instalment, all abroad the feels train, the begging train and the edging train, choo choo x
Cas answered by shoving Dean back with force. His lower back met the desk behind him. Fuck yes this was happening. Dean stripped with a new sense of urgency and jumped up onto the desk once bare, legs parting for Cas to slot into them. The Russian started to undress too. His inked body on show for Dean, only Dean. He hadn’t seen Cas completely naked since that time in the shower when he couldn’t look for too long. This time Dean didn’t hold back admiring his glorious body. His hand went down to take hold of his growing erection.
He could see his friend reading the comments, his blue eyes squinting, mouthing the words silently as he read. He read one aloud “Is his voice as sinful as those hips?” His friend chuckled at that. “Yes, it is username spankmefilthy189.”
He’d deal with the consequences of that later. Too tired to care at that moment and he wanted his energy back for yard time, what waited for him out there. So yeah, another hour and then a shower and a shave were needed in exchange for missing out on the grub.
Dean replied in a hum mixed with a moan as Cas sped up, taking his other hand from Dean’s balls and gripping onto his hip tight, holding him down. His strength pushed Dean into the bed and that pushed Dean over the edge unexpectedly, body writhing and head thrashing back into the pillows as Cas pulled his orgasm out of him.
“What? No smart comments out of that pretty mouth of yours?” he taunted Dean. He said it loud enough some of the AB could hear and wolf whistled. Dean kept his head down, don’t react.
The guard looked the Russian up and down next but didn’t say a word. He saw his new celly bring up his right hand like he was showing Zachariah something. It made the guard tense, made him take a step back from the Russian. He even managed to put fear in the prison guards.
“It seems you don’t understand how punishment works,” Cas told him, grip tightening. “You don’t get what you want, you get what
The girls came running up to them, looking for lunch and their adult conversations were put on hold for the rest of the evening. Dean couldn’t wait for Wednesday now.
He pulled up the porn website, scrolling through the icons. If he hovered over them, they played a little clip of what was inside the video. It helped speed up the process. His eye caught a blow job, dude sitting on the edge of the bed with his mouth open, ready and waiting for the other guy to slot his cock into place. He licked his lips, suddenly noticing how empty his mouth felt without the weight of Cas’ cock in it.
“Alright inmates, back to your cells for count! Let’s go! Let’s go!” the guards shouted banging their batons on the rails they were standing near. Dean dropped his tray off and walked back with Benny to their block in anticipation of who was going to be there waiting for him.
“Bobby, I’m taking my break!” he calls out not waiting for Bobby respond. He walks out of the shop with Sam and Jess towards his car, so they can lean on it to eat and put their food on it. Dean keeps her pristine, people could eat their food off of her. Dean has eaten food off her, granted he wasn’t sober at the time.
“All I know is we’re on our way to breakfast, next thing the siren goes and we’re all on the ground wondering what the hell is going on then I hear 10-54d on a guard’s radio as he runs past me…”
Cas takes his hand again while their walking. It makes Dean’s heart skip a little feeling his cold hand pressed against Dean’s. He’s holding it like he’s scared Dean might let sometimes and Dean rubs his thumb in circles to subtly tell him to ease up or Dean might lose circulation in it. He relaxes eventually. With his two jobs Dean never really took the time to walk around the town he grew up in, shops changed over time, sole trading being replaced by chains. They walked past two Starbucks in less than half an hour.
“Funnily enough, Cas, or Professor Novak, whatever you call him showed up wanting to apologies for being such a dick to me. I told you about that right?” Sam and Jess both shake their heads. “He called me an inconsiderate asshole AND insufferable in the space of two minutes, this was after I got him an apology pie for playing the music too loud that night you were over.”
Dean pulled at this bottom lip, eyes closing to revel in this feeling. He couldn’t enjoy it yesterday, not as much as he was enjoying it this morning. The feel of Cas inside of him, that pressure he had never experienced before, new and odd but slowly he started to push back onto it, seeking more.
It looked like Dean was going to explain, when his face turned to steel, and he took Cas’ legs in his hands and pulled him into him. Cas yelped at the surprise of strength, his back hitting the bed under him and now Dean hovered over him, nowhere to hide.
He stepped into Dean’s space and slipped his hands under Dean’s shirt, peeling it back off his shoulders and Dean took the message reaching back to take over stripping himself. Cas went to the other side of his bed to get his lube and tear off a condom from the strip.
“Yeah, Claire, do what your old man says,” Dean pointed at the youngster who decided in that moment to stick her tongue out. He returned the gesture.
“I always look good.” He joked. Admittedly he did appreciate the compliment. It was the third shirt he had tried on. What do you wear on a date that is probably going to involve a drink, a drive and possibly some sex? Dean couldn’t bring himself to think about the last part long enough. He’d deal with that anxiety when it came to it.
Dean moves to sit in the chair opposite Castiel. He looks serious. “Look Cas, you’re not the only one here with a shitty childhood,” Dean’s eyes drop to his hands. His voice quietens. “Mine wasn’t exactly sunshine and rainbows either.”
“Yeah, it was real bad apparently. Someone I know who works janitor detail had to clean up the blood.” Benny told him.
Their porno on the big screen, that didn’t sound nerve wrecking at all. Dean scratched the back of his neck, noticing how his fingers caught the more sensitive spots where the bruises were. He’d get to see the moment when Cas started to make them and be by Cas’ side when it happened. He wondered what Cas’ reactions would be like.
“Dean,” a hand touched his shoulder. He recoiled from it, moving away like a scared cat till he noticed the skull in his view. Cas’ hand. He blinked back the water in his eyes to see the Russian on his knees in front of Dean. Blue eyes full of worry and concern, hands out in front of him but not touching without permission. “It’s me, Dean. I’m here.”
Hands are on his thighs, sliding up his jeans light as feathers as Cas’ body slides closer to Deans. He’s closing the gap. Smaller and smaller it goes till Dean’s nose touches Cas’. Dean wants to lick his lips again, can feel them drying already from Cas breath. He wants Cas to make the move, make the move and Dean’s his. People have taken enough from Cas, Dean wants him to take now, take him however way he wants.
“You’re alright my friend.” Their height difference more noticeable now Gabriel’s face is pressed against his friend’s chest for support. “It’s time for bed.”
The weight in the bed shifted, his hips dipped and then he felt something unknown touch lightly against his rim, like a whisper. He opened his eyes to see Dean’s arm in front of him, his hand between his legs, his finger touching Cas’ ass alongside Cas’ own. His chest heaved.
Dean ran his hands through his hair. Don’t fight, don’t provoke, don’t piss off the new head of the Russian gang on day one.
He could play off the silent treatment over still being pissed when really, he was reciting in his mind what spirits were on the back line of the bar at the Roadhouse he could remember in order to will his hard on away.
“Listen here assbut,” he pokes Dean in the chest, hard. Did he just call Dean an assbut? He can tell he’s angry. His voice is deeper however humanly possible. “almost every night since you’ve moved in here, I’ve had to suffer through your incessant music. Do you have any idea what time it is?”
doubt that compadre of mine is being hipster, you have met the guy, right? Bout this tall, crow’s nest hair, bit emo? Ring any bells?”
Gaah, a slight little kink might have slipped out while I was writing this and now I'm thinking this fit might get a bit kinky. Hope that's alright with ya'll x
His studio apartment was bigger than his car, he’ll give it that and bigger than most of the motel rooms he slept in over the years. The windows were big, brought in a lot of light. His kitchen was operational, one of the counters had stools underneath to function as a table. The furniture the old tenant left wasn’t all that bad either just needed some rearranging. He never had a place of his own, so he was making the most of it. Dean needed his bed by the window and his sofa between the bed and the kitchen to distinguish the areas. Cooking, chilling and sleeping, done. He bought a stereo system his first day back in the thrift store and brought up some of his tapes from Baby (his car) to play.
He remembers it well. Lucifer had found his stash of stories under his mattress. He fought what he could off of him and ran to the other side of the room where Gabriel’s bed was. Gabriel squared up to Lucifer, it got him a black eye. Castiel felt so guilty about it even if Gabriel insisted it was worth it if it meant Castiel got to keep his stories. He got the last laugh though when he covered Lucifer’s bed in worms. Gabriel loved playing tricks.
He had been quiet throughout it, not wanting to interrupt Cas and his flow. This was like the best bedtime story ever and Dean didn’t want to ruin it by letting it out that he was getting off on it. He just let his hips roll on their own accord, letting the fabric brush against his cock enough to get a tingle over his body. Cas’ dark tipsy voice was turning Dean into putty.
. Where they? They did spend the majority of their free time together. They lived together, had lunch together on campus, attended the same house parties, spent weekends together unless Dean went home to visit his family which was rare.
Dean couldn’t say how long they stayed like that, heads touching, Cas’ hand grounding him in their cell. He was back. This was real. He wasn’t dreaming. In a loop it went around and around in his mind till he believed it. His body started to sag. Exhaustion crept up on him.
“Can’t believe Shurley told you not to step out of line again and then he drops you with the head of the Russian gang in your cell. It’s like he wants you to mess up.” Sam chimed in.
“Charlie! Let’s go, we gotta go to the shops!” he stood up from the bench. His firecracker of a daughter came bounding towards him, face flushed from the running around and hair completely fallen down from the tie he had put it up in that morning. He noticed a dirt mark on the sleeve of her khaki coat (insisting she had one the same as her old man) and on the leg of her jeans.
“Nothing is sugar or gluten-free I already asked, just FYI.” One of the Moms Dean recognised from pre-school said to him. She was one of those yummy Mummies, ones that Dean tended to avoid.
Next was Cas. She touched his shoulder. There was a pause. “Eh, what was it again Daddy?” she turned her head around to look at Dean. He scoffed, broke character and got down beside her to whisper it in her ear again. Cas’ blue eyes squinting and full of curiosity.
Cas obliged, crawling up the space Dean had made for him, pausing at his waist. A cold hand ran around his left flank, then down the back of his thigh and behind his kneecap in one smooth motion making Dean bend his leg, foot flat on the bed. He took his hand away from his cock, raking it through the darkness of Cas’ hair instead.
Well, he never looked back on what he could escape. Gabriel was something he couldn’t escape though if he were to admit it, he would be ok with the fact Gabriel wanted him around. He was exhausting most of the time but Castiel was low on the friend front, having a total of… well one. So, he suffered through Gabriel’s constant need of attention and entertainment. It also meant he got an endless supply of free baked goods.
The soft hands on his hips have been replaced with strong fingers digging into his flesh just the right amount of pain for Dean to still enjoy it, like Cas doesn’t want him to go anywhere, like Dean would even be anywhere other than right here in the basement of his apartment block with his neighbor necking him like a teenager in the back of a cinema. It’s hot and rough and Dean wants to figure out what Cas’ mouth feels like on his body, on his cock, in his ass.
“You need to stop growing Sammy,” Dean slapped his brother’s back. He pulled him back to get a look at him, two arms, two legs, eyes bright, smile wide, yeah, he was all there. “I’m the big brother, remember?”
“Yeah man, think I got it.” Dean licked his lips again, eyes moving from Cas back to his cock. An eagerness in them that Cas hadn’t seen in Dean before. A fleeting thought that the eagerness was to please Cas, if only. “Lemme know when you’re close, k?”
were on the tip of his tongue though he refrained from using them. It had been bad enough he had told Dean he couldn’t stop thinking about him, he didn’t need to let Dean in on anything else remotely vulnerable.
I was inspired by a video from PornHub for this scene, its so sweet and sexy and mhmmm... (The title is called FRIEND SEX fyi)
It was too much. He slipped out from under the Russian’s grip and left to get some space from him. There was air, he knew there was but for some reason he couldn’t quite get it into his lungs. As much as he wanted to fall, wanted Cas and everything he said and more he couldn’t fall. He couldn’t. They weren’t out in the real world, they were in
He did it again and again and again till all he was doing was grinding himself down on Cas’ cock. His friend’s hands dug into his hips, not hard enough to bruise but strong enough to keep him there and it was enough for Dean to know that Cas had him. One of his hands moved to take a grip of Dean’s ass, squeezing the meat of it and Dean was almost completely done for. The feel of Cas spreading his cheek to get closer to him was making him dampen the front of his boxers. His t-shirt stuck to his skin, the audio behind him of Dean calling out Cas’ name over and over had Dean mouthing his name to him in time with the video. Eyes never leaving the other as Dean rubbed his ass over Cas’ hard and leaking cock.
“You drawing me like one of your French girls?” Dean jokes. Cas actually knows that reference for once.
Dean sat up, gripping his friend’s shoulder. “It’s cool man, honestly just maybe lemme in on it next time, alright?”
He left before he actually did decide to give her a piece of his mind. The sudden turn to bolt back into the park had Dean running into someone by accident, running into them with force. The guy keeled over, hand on his chest, his other still holding onto a little blonde-haired kid beside him. Dean could recognise the mass of black hair and trench coat from a mile away.
Play. Dean couldn’t help the flush spreading over his chest and up his neck. They hadn’t played in a couple of days, between driving and exhaustion, the most they could manage was quick blowjobs and frantic frottage. It took Cas a week into their road trip to set up some ground rules for this part of their relationship, the side that put Cas in control. Boundaries were important, to stop the lines blurring between them. It made it safe.
The entire family was hooked on Cas and his new boyfriend, who happened to be sitting right beside him and be related to them all, not that they knew. Sam bounced in his chair, eager to hear more about this mysterious guy in Cas’ life. “What’s he like then Dean?”
stuff…” Dean isn’t looking at him, staring at a spot on the ground. The last time he did that Castiel had upset him. That snaps him out of his train of thought.
Dean and Charlie stopped off at the toy store before heading off to Cas’ house for the birthday party. Dean had lost her twice already, once in the board games section, another in the teddy section and finally found her in the arts and crafts section. She was just so slippery sometimes and Dean was easily distracted by nostalgia, his eye-catching plastic toy soldiers and water guns that reminded him of his brother. He understood now why people kept their kids on leashes out in public. He might need to invest in one.
Jessica’s anxiety is calmer. Her chest heaves less, her eyes are glassy but brighter from smiling at his story. Getting lost in another life helped him with his troubles, he’s glad he could offer that to Jessica though he hopes it will be safe between them. Castiel doesn’t need his other students knowing he was banned from the library.
The diner had an arcade section. He fished out a bunch of coins and handed them to Sam who made a face like it was Christmas day.
He couldn’t breathe. He needed to get out of the crowd. Cas shoved Dean with more intent, making enough space to slip away. Cas barged his way through the crowd, climbing the stairs, tripping over more than once till he got to the bathroom. Thankfully, it was free. He closed the door behind him, hitting his head on the door. Gasping for air to fill his lungs.
His friend leaned off of the door frame, moving to the kitchen with purpose. “Gonna need some whiskey for this one, lots of whiskey.”
“Cas, I…” his voice cut off as Cas felt Dean’s boxers dampen. His quiet orgasm spasming his body slightly in front of Cas. Words like
“Again Dean, we didn’t specify a time,” He replies. He moves to a free machine, loads his washing. Dean reaches into Castiel’s pocket, retrieving his phone with the ease of a pickpocket he almost didn’t feel it. The skill level of Dean’s hands a constant surprise to Castiel. A skill he is still waiting to experience first-hand.
Apparently, that’s an invite for Dean to get off of the machine and join Castiel on the ground. He bends one of his knees and rests his elbow on it. The other stretched out alongside Castiel’s. They’re not touching but its close. Castiel runs on cold and he can feel that warmth again off of Dean.
“Cas is here?” he asks eyes peering out into the tables he can barely make out in this dim light bar. Atmosphere dimming his ability to make heads or tails of anyone that isn’t under the lights that hang over the bar.
The Russian was lying on his bed when Dean walked into their cell. His top already discarded leaving his chest on show for Dean to admire. Dean had a serious hard on for Cas and his tattoos. Each one with a purpose and a significance that he was still trying to decipher. Cas told him about some of them, when he was in a particularly happy mood, usually after basking in his afterglow. The stars on either shoulder to signify high ranking within the gang and the cross to show that he was a part of the Russian Bratva were the ones he knew about. He had yet to understand the meaning of the Madonna on his stomach or the set of eyes peering out over his trousers.
Everyone's on board with the sexy times though, just alcohol and lack of verbal consent make it dubious IMO.
The Russian smiled again. Dean was enjoying this much more than he probably should. His trousers were getting a bit tight in the crotch region, happy that Cas wasn’t sitting that close on his lap to feel it. He needed to keep some dignity, getting a hard on for someone playing with his hair like he was a teenager was not dignified.
When it came to melting the chocolate Cas was right, Dean did want to melt it. He enjoyed breaking up the pieces in his hand, slipping the odd one into his mouth when Cas wasn’t looking. One time he got caught and Cas glared at him with those steely blues his daughter enjoyed using. Claire did it, intimidating. Cas doing it, slightly alluring. He handed Cas a piece silently asking for forgiveness. Cas took it, popping into his mouth and humming. It was downright sinful, and Dean went back to breaking the pieces slightly more aggressively than before.
Balthazar nodded. The others did too. Cas turned his head round and saw Dean peering out of his cell. He forgot to re-adjust his hair, probably a mess from Cas’ hands. The Russian sighed, moved past his men and descended to the ground floor of the block. Dean stood over the railing to see what he was doing, where he was going. If he was going to Sam’s cell.
He may or not have called his brother a dick under his breath. With a quick check of his watch he realised he was going to be late, shocker. He dashed to his car, hoping the short drive there would get rid of this niggling feeling of being a bad Dad.
Dean ran his finger along what looked like a knife wound above the Madonna’s halo. It felt deep, jagged like the knife wasn’t all that sharp. Cas hitched his breath, stomach flinched. Dean moved his hand away with a quiet apology, “Shit, sorry.”
Cas climbed up Dean’s body, his eyes closed, mouth slack and bliss covered his face. Cas brushed his nose against Dean's. A tiny hum vibrated from his friend's throat. He looked peaceful and Cas didn’t want to disturb him any longer. He made quick work with the cloth, taking some of the lube off of Dean and then manhandled Dean’s tired body under the covers.
face at him. His brother just told him not to do anything stupid, asking Cas if he’s bringing drugs into Purgatory sounded pretty stupid in Dean’s mind. “C’mon Dean, if Angel Grace gets in here, we’re going to need to be ready.” Sam was serious, concerned even.
“I can see why you thought Gabriel and I were together. He is very touchy feely.” He uses Dean’s words. They feel strange on his tongue, like they don’t belong to him. He can see Dean smile, its half hidden in the arms he’s resting his face on. Castiel wants to reach out, run his hand through his hair to tell him its ok, that really Castiel is fine. After everything Dean had said the only words that are clinging to him were that Dean said he liked him.
“A day off?” she says it like he’s just suggested amputation of a limb. He nods. She takes another tissue from the box Castiel produced from his drawer. She blows her nose, shakes her head. “I can’t take a day off Professor, mid-terms,
“Yeah, course, go before she bites your head off and dips it in her soy latte.” Dean stepped out of Cas and Claire’s way. He did have to get to work, already cutting it close himself.
Also some kink negotiation (kinda), skull fucking, swallowing, rim jobs... its a lot. Dean loves it though.
Is it that he doesn’t want to be alone or he can’t be alone right now? Dean’s been there, more times than he cares to count.
“Then go,” Cas replied, pulling the collar of Dean’s jacket down to get at a piece of skin he hadn’t become friendly with yet. “The doors behind you.”
Cas reached for the lube, leaving drops of it on Dean’s cock that had him twitching from the coldness of it. He wrapped his hand around the base of Dean’s cock giving it a tight squeeze to ensure he knew who was in charge. Pre-cum slipped from Dean. His body completely responsive to Cas, completely owned by him in this moment. Cas kept that brutal grip as he slid up Dean’s cock, teasing him for a few seconds, letting it disappear and reappear over and over, enjoying the steady panting happening beside him.
There was someone new at their table, someone new sitting in the center of the table more importantly. Uriel, the usual center of the Russian gang nowhere to be seen. This guy was younger, about Dean’s age, hair as dark as the Empty got in the nighttime.
One night with the guy and this was what he was feeling, how the hell was he going to cope a month from now? Two? He had to come clean before it got too much, before he nose-dived into this and Cas wasn’t there with him. He had to know if he needed to pull the eject button on this whole thing before he let himself go in order to let Cas in. That thought scared the crap out of him.
Every wall he kept up fell as they stood in the middle of their tiny cell making out. As much as he loved getting to know Cas’ mouth and every trick he could do with his tongue he also needed more. The months of keeping the magnitude of his desire for this man was starting to crawl its way out of his skin and he was dying to see just how much Cas could tear him apart.
He looked up from his laptop to see Dean was on board with it. He was met with Dean staring at him like he had five heads.
“See you Monday,” Cas said walking out, he paused, hand still on the door and looked down at the ground to speak, “The sooner you fuck me, the sooner I’ll leave you alone Dean, remember that.” And with that he left Dean there with his limp cock still out.
Back in Cas’ bed he lay himself down on his comforter. A similar set up to their first time. This time the laptop further back, enough space for the dim lighting to not make Dean recognizable. The light on his desk was on, casting brightness to the ceiling above them therefore dimming the space they were situated. A role reversal. Dean stood at the edge of the bed, waiting for Cas to get comfortable before hitting the record button.
“I think there is a piece of glass in your wound, see?” he brings Dean’s hand to Dean, shows him with his index finger where the piece of glass is wedged in. The cut runs from the bottom of his thumb to the beginning of his wrist. It’s not too deep, just going to be a bitch to heal. Dean nods. When he does that, he can feel Cas’ hair against his forehead they’re that close. He pulls back, he’s already in enough physical pain, no need to add to the emotional one he is still dealing with.
That earned the girl an earnest groan from Dean which stirred something in Cas. He found himself unable to concentrate much on his drawing, his pencil starting to twitch in his hand at the onset of arousal.
Then the siren started going off around them. The group fell to the floor, hands behind their heads. Guards barged their way through the breakup the fight. Sam and the other Russian were still going at it. Cas crouched down to wrap his hands around Dean’s neck.
Cas couldn’t reach into Dean’s hair from this angle, he knew he wanted it, so Dean leaned forward, braced himself on one of the metal rods that was keeping his bed above Cas’. When Cas’ hand reached into his scalp Dean let out a soft moan. He couldn’t help it, so weak to that touch.
Castiel into the lift. That tiny lift where he could feel the heat of Dean’s body close to his, smell the fumes from his work and Castiel can’t even remember the last time someone made him feel like that, if ever.
When he got back from one of his runs, he spotted his older brother leaning against the backdoor to their house. He had that mischievous smirk on his face that told Cas he was up to no good.
“I will read you one another story I’ve written.” He replies. Dean seems content with that. They eat in silence. It gives Castiel time to think which of his stories he wants Dean to hear, what part of who he is does he want Dean to know about through his words.
Cas let him in. He was in his weekend clothes. Dean tried not to pay attention to how soft he looked in his red hoodie and striped socks. The warmth of his house made Dean shuck off his hat, coat and jumper. Cas didn’t say much other than to sit down in the sitting room which he did, taking a side of the couch to hug. The other man disappeared for a brief moment and returned with two cups of coffee.
“They pay me just fine,” he seals the box with a sticker. “That’ll be 18 dollars.” The student pays with his phone then leaves. When he looks up to inspect the queue and product left, he spies a familiar face in the line. Dean. He’s not alone, standing talking with Jessica his student and the tall guy who Gabriel flirts with any chance he gets. Sam.
“Tomorrow? What’s happening tomorrow?” he asked. Cas looked up at Dean. Face not giving anything away. “C’mon
“Cas, c’mon its Van Halen.” He tries to reason with his neighbor. There is that little part of his brain that enjoys seeing Cas riled up. It’s making his eyes looked crazed, his hair is messy probably from pulling at it. Dean wants to pull at it. These weren’t helpful thoughts. Cas is pissed at him, really pissed. Before Cas manages to respond Jess shouts over the music.
“Your burrito is safe Dean.” Jess assures him. He trusts her. He wouldn’t trust his brother with his food as far as he could throw him. Which means as he’s gotten older the trust is slowly withering away. They still won’t lose their smirks though which has Dean suspicious.
“For you to fuck me into the middle of next week,” Cas answered honestly. He smiled when he saw Dean grip the sheets harder. “I’ll take what I can get for now though, so if you don’t mind, I’d like to choke myself on this glorious dick of yours.”
One of the mornings a guard had dropped off their clean laundry into their cell. Cas had already gone to work so Dean was left with putting it away. He dumped their stuff onto Cas’ bed and sifted through it, noticing he was missing a few items.
In the same breath Dean hand his hand on him, pushing Bart off to check on Cas, not realising that his reaction was out of arousal and not out of pain. His friend’s need to protect him even when they were not speaking spoke volumes. The music was too loud to talk then it changed to something upbeat. More bodies appeared to enjoy the song, shoving Bart and the girl in different directions and shoving the boys together. They fell into one another, hands taking hold of what they could to steady themselves. Cas putting his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean taking a grip of Cas waist, bodies completely aligned in the smog of sweat.
“Yeah, well that was before…” he paused. Cas dug his nails in harder into his scalp. Fuck that felt good. The anger slowly seeping out of his skin from the touch. He didn’t understand though, one second the Russian was going to shiv him, now he was running his hands through his hair. The Russian was seriously unpredictable, one second hot, the next cold.
Cas rolled his head into his pillow, burying it in there to try and hide from the embarrassment of what happened. The laptop screen closed. It was over. He shouldn’t have done that. He wasn’t supposed to do that.
The food arrives before he asks it and they end up talking about how good the food is here. Dean tries some of Castiel’s pancakes. Castiel attempts to take a hash brown and Dean nearly stabs the fork into his hand. They talk about other food, what they love (dark chocolate chip cookies, pie) and what they hate (jam, salad of any variety) and different restaurants around town that neither of them has yet to try but want to. Dean tells Castiel about this diner he found on the road that did the best chicken burgers and how Castiel had to try them someday promising to take him and meaning it.
“I know,” Dean interrupted him, hands taking Cas’ face just for this one moment before they continued.  “I trust you man.”
The Russian nodded and left, heading back to the kitchen before he got wrote up for being somewhere, he wasn’t supposed to be. Dean ran his hands through his hair, trying to shake himself back to reality. He hadn’t had a panic attack like that in years. Benny must have gotten Cas for him while he was in the midst of it. He’d have to thank him for it, maybe give him some his commissary to call his wife Andrea who was back in Louisiana. He’d have to thank Cas too, somehow.
She hadn’t even said goodbye to him, too engrossed in what looked like the Tran kid’s bag pack. There were Power Rangers on it, Dean couldn’t blame her. He was about to make the walk back through the park when one of the head teachers spotted him. Crap.
“What now? You gonna punish me big guy?” He could hear the smile in his voice. Dean helped Cas out, shrugging out of his shirt with urgency. Cas loved it how easy it was for Dean to fall into this with him.
Gabriel hung out with them for a bit, retelling tales of his adventures in South America, specifically the numerous orgies he attended. Half of the time Cas wasn’t sure to believe him. They were completely outrageous though they were those kinds of stories that due to them being so outrageous they were probably true. If anyone could attend an orgy that involved two sets of twins, it would be Gabriel.
In other exciting news GABRIELLLL! I love Gabriel and he's a total bamf in this fic in my humble opinion :)
He wanted it too, wanted it more than anything. His heart screaming at him to shout his affection for Cas at the top of his lungs but his brain, his fucking brain…
It had been two years since Dean got released from Purgatory. The world had changed in more ways than Dean could count. Phones had no buttons, cars were electric, the internet was everywhere, and people gave a crap about the environment. It was a lot to get his head around. In some ways he had been glad he got early release, three more years in there and he’d swear he would have come out and time machines were going to be a thing.
And then the dancing happened and yeah, things started to go south for Dean around then. Alcohol and Cas grinding on someone had got him too riled up. He couldn’t even stand seeing them together. The jealously rising up in him like some possessive jackass. A body pressed against Cas’ that wasn’t
It turned out Dean wasn’t trying to stop him, he was trying to get Cas to move closer, jut his leg out more for Cas to get even closer. This was good, really good. Cas rolled his hips and this time a moan rifted its way into the short space between them.
They walked into Gabriel’s house, met by swarms of bodies pushing their way through to get to where they need to be. Dean had to lean in closer to shout over the music playing in the sitting room. “Maybe we should have gotten into the gambling business instead of the porn.”
Dean chuckled, swallowing his bite. He had the immediate thought to brush it off, make some subtle innuendo that was on the tip of his tongue or brush it off completely. They weren’t around the kids though, meaning Dean could take the opportunity to try out their new facet of their friendship, blatantly obvious flirting.
Right before he came Cas sat up, bringing their mouths together to breathe the same sex filled air. “YA lyublyu vas moy lev.” He panted.
Dean lifted his top up to his nose. Cas managed to see a glimpse of his bare skin. Dean must be nose blind to it by now as he didn’t seem to notice the retched smell of it. “I can’t do much about it unless you want me to take my top off?”
Cas is beside him, turning on the tap to let the cold water run. Dean pulls away the cloth revealing his hand. There is too much blood to see the damage. Cas takes Dean’s wrist lightly and guides it under the water. The impact makes Dean wince in pain. He inhales sharp through his teeth. “Is it bad?” he asks not wanting to look.
“He hasn’t been out for very long. He’s still getting used to the adjustments,” Cas added, talking with such affection it kinda of hurt. “I am very fond of him though.”
The girls were shedding their snow jackets, shoes and hats. The snow had gotten into their clothes. Dean shrugged off his own jacket, hanging it on the back of a chair. He picked his shivering daughter up into his arm. “You’re freezing, why didn’t you say anything sooner?”
Cas made himself scarce the following morning, after spending the remainder of the night locked in his room. He couldn’t bear to look at Dean, not after what happened. The guilt burrowed its way inside of him, till he decided to drown it in copious amounts of alcohol. His brother Gabriel threw the wildest house parties around. Friday night was no exception.
Charlie, small guy, red fired hair about as long as Sam’s in Purgatory for something involving hacking people he wasn’t supposed to, online terrorism. Dean couldn’t keep up with the technicalities of it all. A whizz with computers, and it landed him a 4-year stint. He was only 6 months in. He was a good kid, smart witted once he opened up to the rest of them. Kids like him would get eaten up around here. Kids like him needed friends like Sam and Dean to survive.
Their lives weren’t easy. The lives they ended up living meant letting people in was not something they could do easily. Letting people in meant letting people down or worse, the people ended up hurting the brothers more than they could realise. It took years for Sam to find someone to settle down with and Dean well, he never settled down with anyone. He’d never let anyone in out of fear of fucking it up. He could still hear his Dad’s voice in his head sometimes reminding him of it.
“No fucking hospitals Cas.” He stamps out every word looking Cas dead in the eye to show he means it. The last time he was in a hospital his Dad died, before that his Mom died.
Admittedly the replaying of Dean’s sex filled moans were what got Cas through his days. He tended to stay at the back of the class, stare out of the window or doodle in the margins of the paper. Daydreams of pretty green eyes and how his mouth felt full of Dean were hard not to slip into. He wasn’t entirely sure where this newfound interest in Dean had come from, but it was there, and he couldn’t shake it away.
Cas took a while to respond. In that time Dean had turned on a re-run of House just to have something on in the background. It was easy to watch, easy to drink to.
, a proper one, not one laced in sex. He brought her out to lunch then a walk in the park and they talked about being single parents and their kids because that’s what parents did. When he took her hand, she blushed, and it was cute. They were talking about their Thanksgiving plans when her phone started to ring.
Dean called him a sap for it. Cas didn’t care. The look of Dean arching into his touch on his sheets told him he made the right idea.
That gaze drying up his mouth and lips instantly. His tongue flattened out on his bottom lip to wet it. The cold blues moved to it, watched Dean pull his top lip over his bottom. He wanted them to stay on him as long as he could get, indulge in it by running a hand through his hair like he was putting on some kind of secret show that only Cas would understand. If he remembered. If Dean was even worth remembering. It was all Dean thought about it. He wanted Cas to want him again.
Dean nodded, pulling at his bottom lip. His orgasm building fast and then it hit him hard. He threw his head back, grunting out as Cas milked him, cum spilling out between them. It was euphoric, all the time not touching himself only making his orgasm that much harder. White spots blurred his vision. Cas’ name on his tongue over and over and over like a prayer being answered.
Cas cuts him off again with his mouth and shift of his hips, slightly pulling out then delving back in again. The warmth of Dean consuming him once more. Words were forming on the tip of his tongue, things like
“Nothing is free Dean, we did this for you, now you do something for us.” He explained. The other nameless Russian nodded his head in agreement. Of course, nothing was for free. Dean thinking Cas was doing something out of the goodness of his heart was his mistake. He shouldn’t have thought someone as important as Cas would be in the business of doing someone like Dean a solid. He wasn’t a charitable man.
“Oh okay,” he failed at hiding the dumb look on his face. He was totally elated that Cas had said that and his smile gave it away. He recomposed himself after a second or two, he could totally get lost at sea in those eyes of Cas’. “I actually came looking for a cup of coffee.”
It took time getting used to these massive changes. It also took time getting used to the small ones. The lack of schedule had been difficult, no one to tell him when he had to eat, sleep or work. Even deciding what to wear every day, his own clothes, clothes that belonged to him and not the state. He refused to wear orange for obvious reasons. He also didn’t have to watch his back, look over his shoulder or worry about the fact he couldn’t clearly see the exit. It took him a month to go grocery shopping. The aisles blocked his view. It freaked him out too much.
He tried not to think too much about how Cas was so sure that Benny would be willing for sex on the first date and put his phone down to drive off, not wanting to be late. The nerves had settled, thanks to Cas. Also, there was a part of him that was more eager for a blowjob if it meant he got to tell Cas about it. Again, he tried not to think too much about that either.
He then realised he just offered to drop his child off to play at another child’s house without even asking the parent first. That was definitely not ok, rookie parenting mistake. They might have had plans, or Cas might not have wanted a play date or any other of countless things.
“Laundry room.” Dean replied not paying much attention to his brother or to anyone who might have overheard the announcement of his whereabouts from the cells nearby.
He’s on a sketch Cas had done some time ago. Dean sitting on the bleacher, outstretched, staring off into a memory. His leather jacket with the collar turned up, hiding part of his face from Cas. Behind him, almost like a halo is the W in the same design as on his zippo. His Father’s one.
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re enjoying this.” He reached into palm at Dean because apparently, he liked to be a tease, liked seeing Dean crumble a little under him.
Cas went back to Dean’s cock, quickening the pace, conscious of the time. The more he stroked Dean, the more his own erection was getting in the way. He found himself swaying his hips on Dean’s thigh, getting some kind of friction that made his head spin a little. Dean moved one of his hands to Cas’ waist, gripping it tight, stopping Cas from moving.
Dean whined when Cas broke from his lips, trying to pull Cas back to him. Cas chuckled, moving his mouth to Dean’s neck to plant kisses. “Do you want to be punished Dean?"
Dean did what promised. He tried. From that morning at his parent’s house, letting Cas keep his t-shirt on all the way up to embracing him in a heated drunken kiss outside a jazz club in the French quarter in New Orleans. They cheer and shouts from onlookers seemed to only encourage Dean more and since then he’d been more open with his affections.
The heaviness that encompasses Dean is drastically noticeable. His shoulders slump, his head drops, his eyelids sag a little. His past wearing him like a blanket. Castiel reaches across the table, rests his hand on top of Dean’s. He watches Dean inhale sharply, like he’d been holding his breath. He exhales audibly and says,
He stood at the end of the bed, like he usually did to let his eyes wander to take Dean in. He was Cas’, all of Cas’ and no one else’s, from the tiniest lick of his bottom lip to the way his toes curl under Cas’ gaze. Breath taking.
Step two, Dean devouring (Jessica’s accurate words) the diner food, complete. He looks more relaxed now, leaning back against Castiel’s chair, one of his legs out stretched under the table close to Castiel’s.
That didn’t stop the guy from envisioning it. Cas was looking up and to the left. He nudged Cas’ shoulder back to reality. “Stop thinking about my ass.”
He gathers up a bit and laps at it, which Dean just stares at for a moment with heavy eyes before shaking his head and pushing Cas’ body off of him. He reaches for a pair of boxers, then his smokes and climbs up on Cas’ dresser to open the window and stays there.
“No.” Castiel admits. He smooths out the paper he crumbled by snatching it from Dean’s hands. Hopefully the student will assume Castiel spent more time on it than the others and not that he was trying to seize it back from his neighbor and his slightly calloused hands.
Cas was warm in Dean’s mouth, pre-cum leaking out and Dean lapped it up like an ice pop that’s melting in his hand on a summer’s day. He was anchored to the bed by Cas’ hands in his hair that didn’t know if they wanted to grip tight and fuck into Dean’s mouth or gently hold on and enjoy whatever Dean gave him. Dean was holding out for the former and when Cas let go completely Dean pulled off and told him to put them back.
Dean’s breathe hitches but he doesn’t stop Castiel, so he keeps going. It requires more pressure to get it off which Castiel applies. He sees Dean pull at his bottom lip on reaction, it stirs something dark in Castiel. Dean still doesn’t stop him, so he keeps going.
– this I’ve wanted, really wanted when you were telling me about fucking that guy and...” he was cut off with Cas’ hand finding his nipple, he groaned, craning his head back to lift his chest up higher chasing the hand that was moving away. Such a damn insufferable tease.
There was a tense silence that Dean knew he created. Cas had been casual about talking about his ex, it was Dean that was up in arms over it. He couldn’t help it. He was a protector, always had been, always would be.
Cas got off the bed to sit beside Dean, the sides of their bodies aligning. It helped having Cas near him like this. Not that he’d admit that aloud, ever, though given last night’s sleepover perhaps he admitted in actions already rather than words. That wasn’t part of their video.
A slide show of their bodies pressed close in the lift. Dean with a fistful of Castiel’s hair as he pushes Castiel’s mouth further into the joint of his neck and shoulder, asking for it to be marked, asking to make it last a week.
He feels Dean relax, he puts one hand under the table to rest it on Dean’s thigh this time, a reassuring squeeze to let him know that all is ok. Dean worries too much about others. They share a look that Jessica and Sam see but they don’t say anything about it. Castiel knows he’s sitting close to Dean, their arms brushing as they eat their lunch. He doesn’t mind, he isn’t breaking any rules, Dean isn’t a student. He wouldn’t mind others knowing about them, whatever it was they were, one date and a rather explicit kiss is all they’ve shared so far. That might be nothing in Dean’s world even if it means a lot in Castiel’s.
That seemed to be good enough for Cas. His hands went back into Dean’s hair, reaching up to the top of his hair, grabbing a fist full of it. Cold blues looked down as Dean rut himself on the bed from the feeling of it, because somehow being pulled from the top of his head had managed to make its way all the way down to his cock. He had been hard giving Cas head, now there was a growing damp spot he was working himself into.
Cas spat in his palm to help himself out, moving his hand up and down Dean’s shaft, picking up pace while he twisted his wrist, letting the head of Dean’s cock disappear into his tight fist to only reappear, angrier and pinker than before. Dean’s cock felt good in his hand, probably taste even better in his mouth.
Cas is persistent, pushing his mouth against Dean’s all consuming, all devouring, all nothing Dean expected it to be because this is so much better than Dean had ever hoped for. Cas is a fucking demon sent by Lucifer himself hell bent on making Dean crumble under his touch, under his tongue, under his lips and Dean is trying to catch his breath in the short breaks Cas gives him before claiming his mouth all over again.
Angel Grace successfully infiltrated Purgatory and as Sam suspected chaos and carnage erupted. A riot broke out. The guards were outnumbered. Chuck had brought guards down from Hell to get the prisoners back under control. Sam had tried to stay out of it, but he couldn’t. Gordon was back from the infirmary and out for blood. He knew he wouldn’t survive on his own. On the second day he walked up to the Russians and asked Gabriel for protection. He knew what he was asking. He didn’t care. He wasn’t going to die in here. He had to survive. Dean had to get out eventually, they couldn’t keep him in there forever and he wouldn’t die before he got to see his brother again.
“Come in.” he closes his email window on his computer. Jessica comes in. The usual effortless smile on her face isn’t there.
Cas chuckled, shutting off the feed and closing the laptop. He crawled back to Dean who was cleaning himself up. Cas took the cloth to take over, wiping Dean down as best as he could. They’d need to shower, later. For now, he wanted to wrap Dean up and hold him close which Dean welcomed.
He shook his head chuckling at the Russian. Cas did too, their laughs echoing in their little cell that they shared. It was a light moment between them. Those were few and far between in Purgatory. Probably more so for someone with as much power and status as Cas had. His cold blues now flooded with light like they’ve let something bright in for once.
Dean lifted his head. His dreams were torture, removing the two things he wanted and there they were staring at him and calling out his name. He could see Cas, actually see him for the first time in so long. The orange lit up his face in the darkness, his eyes were soft with the quietest smile Dean found so endearing.
Cas got up, pulled on Dean’s wrist, pulled it till Dean got up too. They went to Cas’ bed, Cas first lying down on his back with arms out for Dean to fall into them. He was actually going to let Dean do this. Dean took his top off and got on the bed before Cas could change his mind.
For one, Cas might have decided in the three days apart that it wasn’t a good idea, that it wasn’t really more than sex for him, and that Claire had already gone through a separation and he wasn’t about to put her through another one. Each one as reasonable and plausible as the next. Charlie didn’t have to see her parents split up due to the mere fact they were never together in the first place and as far as she was concerned Dean was the only parent she had. The real story will come out eventually when she’s old enough to hear it. Claire on the other hand saw and experienced the split of her parents.
Castiel couldn’t even stomach half a slice of the apple pie after that. He loves apple pie, his favourite and the taste of it was all wrong. Castiel didn’t need Gabriel to explain to him that he had upset Dean. The door being slammed in his face was explanation enough along with the venomous “Fuck you.” he got.
“I don’t read Russian Sam, how the hell am I supposed to know what’s in it? Now shut up and eat your damn breakfast.”
“What do you want to do Dean?” Such an innocent question filled with so many options. Cas was going to let him stir this ship. He didn’t want to leave. He wanted to stay and be with Cas, wanted to get over this feeling by smothering it with a more intense one.
The Russians stepped over the body, leaving it there and walked on towards the top of the queue, towards Dean and Sam. No one touched the body. Everyone returned to their conversation, as if nothing happened.
When he turned 18 and inherited his parent’s fortune, he packed his one bag and never looked back. That was over 10 ago now.
Anyway, long story short, Cas and he made up then they ate cherry pie on the sofa till they were too stuffed to do anything but go to sleep, in their separate apartments. That didn’t stop Dean from rubbing one out before he turned off the light, that damn Cas and his damn uncontrollable noises he made when he ate the pie in front of Dean. Sure, Cas didn’t understand people too well but c’mon he had to know what those noises sounded like. They were downright
“I’ll see you later Dean.” He turned on his heel and walked back to Gabriel. They started conversing in Russian, Cas sounding pissed off, Gabriel with a shit heating grin like he was trying to rile Cas up. Their relationship was much different than the one Cas’ had with the other Russians. The equal status between them was very noticeable. Gabriel ruffled Cas’ hair and Cas shoved Gabriel playfully. They looked like he and Sam would be sometimes.
It was like it was all he could think about, completely consumed by this asshole underneath him. He oozed everything Cas hated and yet he couldn’t help himself, drawn to his stupid green eyes and bowed lips, even his jaw called to Cas. How he longed to nip at it. Not that he’d ever admit it aloud.
He made his way up Dean’s body in that fashion till he left the final kiss on Dean’s sweated forehead.
“Yeah Cas,” Sex brain took over, high jacking any sense of Dean keeping himself under control. Cas had it all and Dean was more than happy for him to have it. “So, fucking good.”
He learned that night what the eyes on either side of Cas’ hips meant. He also learned how awesome Cas was at giving head. Dean made a passing comment about how Cas totally earned those eyes which had the Russian laughing and Dean liked the way he sounded.
He noticed Cas was hesitant, up on knees in front of Dean staring at Dean’s crotch like it was the first time he’d been around a dick, which it wasn’t. Cas was gay, dicks were his forte, if anyone was to be nervous about the situation it was Dean, who had never had a man touch his dick before. The longer this took, the more agitated Dean was getting.
Cas didn't come back till they got locked in the for the night. He stayed close to the other Russians during rec-time away from his cell and Dean knew not to go near them, he didn’t have a death wish. Also, even though he did get his reputation back for fighting with Cas he still felt people were talking about what happened in the showers with Alastair. It was best to keep their interactions private for his own sake.
There was something happening down the queue. Everyone was rubber necking to see what was going on. Dean followed, leaning out of the queue to see.
She was right, Cas admitting his feelings to Dean wouldn’t be difficult, he was out and had been for some time. Dean could be resistant to it, or worse, completely deny their existence. That would crush Cas. He knew how Dean felt, knew it in the depths of his bones and to have to pretend he didn’t…he didn’t know if their friendship would last that.
With his free hand he reached up to his neck, pressed into the bruises a little. It didn’t help with him keeping quiet but fuck it. He needed to feel them. Dean rolled his head to the side, giving himself better access to touch them, feel the burn of Cas’ mark on him. Hints of copper sparked in his mouth as he bit his lip to stop himself from whining at the sensation. Add pain to his ever-expanding kink list.
“Yeah,” Dean swung his feet over to the side of the bed, hand scratching the back of his neck. “Then movie?”
With a sigh, Cas obeys, sitting on his ends and before he can really register what is happening, Dean’s got his legs over Cas’ legs, locking him in place. His arms and legs completely restrained by Dean.
The crowd stared at Cas to see if he’d take the bait, if he’d step in and fight Dean. If Dean was really his prag, he wouldn’t fight Cas, he wouldn’t even challenge him. If Cas was supposedly protecting Dean, then he wouldn’t fight him. It was kind of genius, if Cas would do it. There was a noticeable pause, anticipating Cas’ response.
“Look Cas,” he needed to play this right, careful with his words. “I mean, yeah, when that went down, I was more concerned with Sammy not dying by the hands of one of your minions,” his hand reached back to scratch his neck, a bit embarrassed to admit the next part aloud because it was the truth. “But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it.”
Some dark parts of Cas he couldn’t help let out, not even play time could inhibit Cas from showing Dean his strength. As he pressed his hip down, he pressed in and Dean’s chest heaved with the impact.
“Yeah.” Dean interrupted. He sped up, wanting to match the smacking sounds that was echoing in his ear. The whole idea of Cas getting off to Dean was making him feel more aroused than he felt the entire time he was with Benny.
He took his hand back, shoving it into his front pocket jean and waited for Dean to freak out or give him a black eye. This time instead of volatile words, Dean just zipped himself back up and stormed off left in silence.
“Glad you two patched things up. He’s my supervisor for my final paper, the happier he is, the better chance I have of getting a good grade.” Jess says.
He let go to slick his hand up, locking eyes with Dean who watched attentively as he ran his tongue over his palm. Dean’s own tongue snuck out, coating his dried lip. He liked Dean’s tongue, his lips, bowed and inviting. They’d fit nicely around any part of Cas’ body though persuading Dean into that might take more work than it’s worth.
Castiel sighs running a hand over his bed head. He really wants to spend the day getting ready for work tomorrow. A new cohort of students to persuade creative writing was worth their time to fill his class quota. The loyalty to Gabriel outweighs his wants though. He shoots Gabriel back a text.
“Nothing,” Dean replied. “Well, everything, can’t believe we’re doing this.” He watched as his friend skating his fingers over Dean’s clothed shaft. His touch turning gentle. Dean let out a shaky breath, noticing his cock jolting from the touch. Cas flattened his palm over it, pressing a little harder to create a friction to bring Dean’s dick back to fully erect.
He went, turning his head to look at Cas. Their eyes flickered to each other’s mouths. Cas’ mouth that Dean had been thinking about far too often to be deemed healthy. He wanted them on him, needed them on him. A breath filled his lungs, on the exhale he let go of any other feeling he had been harboring other than the ones associated with Cas. When he paired it all away, striped it all back, all he was left with was pure desire for the man.
When the lift doors open the guy walks out first. Dean stays behind him and then passes him to get to his door a few feet down. They both rummage for their keys with their free hand, their post in the other. The guy gets his out first. Dean has too many pockets in his overalls.
“The ladies love the hair man.” Ash runs his hand through his mullet. It hadn’t changed in the twenty odd years Dean knew him. Their Dads were regulars at the Roadhouse. They’d sit in a booth in the corner doing their homework together and figure out ways to prank Sam. His Mom was a lover of the 80’s and when she died, he vowed to never change it. So yeah, everyone else thought it was for the ladies. Dean knew it was just for one particular lady.
Cas looked at his hand. Dean did too. The devil with the sharp teeth. A circle with a dot on the inside on one of his fingers.
He toyed with himself using his thumb, letting it ghost around his rim and he wasn’t entirely sure who’s benefit it was for because Dean’s eyes were sort of fixated on Cas’ hand and ass even as he made his way onto the bed to kneel between Cas’ spread legs.
Cas turned them around, pushing Dean against the wall and sank to his knees ungracefully, not wanting to waste a second more without knowing what Dean tasted like in his mouth. He wrapped his mouth around his pink flushed head, immediately met with the salted taste of pre-cum. He looked up, wanting to see what this was doing to his friend, seeing his head hit against the wall, choking on a gasp from the sensation of Cas’ attentive mouth.
Dean hadn’t planned on falling asleep on Cas’ couch. He had a tough day at work. He was tired. The pasta had been incredible and then when Cas started reading the story aloud Dean thought he’d close his eyes for just a minute then he wakes up around four in the morning with a creek in his neck, a blanket on him and the lights out in Cas’ apartment.
After getting dressed he padded back into his bedroom, rubbing his hair dry with a smaller towel. Dean was sat at his desk, still staring at the art on his walls. His jacket now discarded, arms folded over his chest, pulling the black Henley tight to pronounce his biceps. Cas now wished he had touched himself in the shower.
That didn’t stop Jo nagging about it. Once she got a whiff of something interesting, she wouldn’t let up till she got the information. “What’s her name then?”
Dean makes jokes that Castiel can’t follow and Castiel fumbles when Dean shamelessly flirts with him, Castiel calls him insufferable again by accident to which Dean laughs at this time.
Final noticeable difference being the space where he usually stood with his brother and Charlie, sometimes Bobby had been replaced by new inmates. His brother, his friends were not there. Dean scanned the yard, eyes on the hunt for his lurch of a brother landing on the Russians with his brother and Charlie sitting with them. Wait, what?
Reference to rape/sexual assault, actual sexual assault, graphic depictions of violence, flash backs, panic attacks.
Cas found a mini documentary about the aftermath of Stonewall and suggested they watch it to give their brains a break from reading and writing. They set it up on his swivel chair so they could watch it on his bed.
“Someone’s touchy,” Meg noted, eyeing Dean up and down trying to decipher what was going on with him. It made him uneasy. “Since when does Dean the ladies’ man Winchester get all closed off about sex? You’re usually dying to tell us all the stuff you get up to with your one-night flings. Ooh, this person must be special.” Meg smirked devilishly.
“Dean-o!” Gabriel called out. “Was wondering when you’d show up, I was starting to get worried. I’ve been standing here with Cas for half an hour already.”
Cas somewhat regretted agreeing to this. It appeared Dean did too. He was closed off, more than usual. Any time Sam tried to make conversation he glared sourly at his brother. He was wound up about something, shoulders tight and jaw set. He ate his burger like it tasted like cardboard and he wanted it over with already.
Dean waits for him after his run. He’s sitting on Cas’ bed, already stripped down to his boxers and he has this look on his face that tells Cas he’s up to something and Cas
Dean’s eyes widened, out in the open, no beating around the bush with that one. He rubbed his jaw, reached back to scratch his neck trying to answer it in words. Nope, no words yet apparently. The lump in his throat deciding to grow into tumor the size of his fist. He nodded instead.
“You gotta admit, was kinda fun.” He tried to smile, it stung. Sam rolled his eyes, but Dean saw through it, his brother loved fighting as much as he did. Underneath that good guy wrong place façade he liked to portray he was programmed just like Dean. A good fight made them feel alive.
Cas is pulling and he’s going with him. Dammit he’s totally going to hell for this, solely based on the fact that Cas is too drunk to register the significance of what he’s asking.
He blushed seeing how much he let go, the frantic nature of him chasing Cas’ hand and arching into the other than was massaging his balls. Jesus, he looked like he loved it.
“It’s fine Dean, I don’t mind talking about it with you,” Cas wiped the crumbs off of his top. “We separated shortly after Claire was born. I found out he had been cheating on me.”
He sighed, pulling at his face with his palms. He was a fucking lost cause at this stage. His body loving Cas near him, his mind struggling to keep up with his change in emotions and now on top of that he had to worry about his friends finding out about what he and Cas got up to behind closed doors.
God, his body felt good, really good and yet his brain was screaming at him to run for the hills, get as far as away from Cas as possible. That he still had a chance of a normal life if he just left now and not let this get carried away any more than it had. He couldn’t be what Cas wanted him to be, he wasn’t strong like him. The looks, the names, the taunting would eat him alive. He remembered what Cas had to go through in first year. He couldn’t do it.
“What’s the rush?” He continued to kiss Dean anywhere other than where he needed his mouth to be. Cas’ right hand moved back up Dean’s thigh. The smooth palm against the softs hairs was slightly tickling Dean, making him squirm under Cas’ touch. He took a tighter grip of Cas’ hair earning him a groan from the man.
“You see, Bobby already kicked him earlier so he’s pretty sensitive.” Bobby explains. Dean puts his tools down and slides out from under the car. Sam and Jess are standing over him. He can smell the lunch in Jess’ hands.
In a free period, Cas found himself in the library, sitting on the floor between the aisles sketching for the only class he gave a damn about. Art. The teacher encouraged they use their sketchbooks constantly, never to lose the ability to pick up a pencil and draw in everyday situations. Art needs to be a part of your life the teacher drilled into them. It was for Cas. He felt empty without a pencil in his hand.
Cas took Dean’s cock in his hand for the final time. Dean let out a desperate whine, falling back onto the bed to let Cas do his worst on him. After the length of edging he had Dean’s orgasm was going to be intense, earth shattering, and Cas couldn’t wait to be the reason for it. He twisted his wrist, moving up and Dean’s length. Dean’s body quick to respond from the stimulation. His moans filling the air once more.
Dean pulls Cas’ hand off of him, flipping them with ease so Cas is underneath him. He would fight but he knows it’s no use. Dean weighs him down and keeps him there. This time Dean takes Cas’ jaw, pulling him to look at him in the eye.
He buried his head in his pillow, trying to figure out how the hell he was supposed to act like Cas’ friend when he knew what he sounded like when he comes. He needed to forget about Cas, had to for his own sake if he was ever going to keep him as a friend. If Cas just wanted friendship, he’d have to replace his fantasies and quick. To get over someone, he needed to get under someone else.
Balthazar eyed him coming over, smoke between his lips, one leg crossed over the other. After Cas, Balthazar was next in the ranking. His second in command, right hand man, whatever way you wanted to call it. This man was less stoic than his boss, he smiled more and was a bit more approachable, emphasis on a bit. Dean still had to thread carefully.
“No, I’m merely checking…” he looked around, spying Dean lying down on his bed, completely relaxed, completely naked, scrolling on his phone. A far cry from the beginning of these videos. He could see the nerves roll off of Dean then and now he looked at home, where he belonged on Cas’ bed about to get fucked.
“Dean don’t do it,” His brother pressed him against the wall. He wanted to rip the Folk Nation’s throat out with his bare hands, wanted to break every bone in that hand of his that touched Dean. “Let it go.”
Their relationship continued to develop too, whatever they were. Dean wasn’t too hung up on the technicalities of it. He wanted to be with Cas, wanted his company inside and outside of the bedroom. Things didn’t really change all that much between them in the daytime, they did some sightseeing, drove around like they usually would have but, in the nighttime, or behind closed doors when Dean got to be himself, Cas took every advantage of it and Dean seriously loved it.
Dean’s leaning against the table, arms crossed over his chest. Cas mirrors him. He lets himself admire Dean while he’s quiet, how his jeans fit snug on his hips, his belt buckle showing due to his top not being pulled down enough. His flannel loose on his sides like undrawn curtains and Dean’s stomach is the show. Cas is awfully cheesy when he’s in a light mood.
Bobby even managed to get himself another employee while he was away, Benny. Dean was surprised he had stuck around for coming on a year. People didn’t last in Singer’s Auto-shop, either fed up with Bobby being Bobby or Bobby sacking them just because he could. Benny was a smooth talker from Louisiana paid off the books. They got on like a house on fire, Dean might even dare to say they were close to being friends at this stage.
He closed his eyes. The bed began to shift and then there was an arm wrapping itself around him, pulling him in. He froze, suddenly aware that he had not locked his bedroom door and that anyone could walk in at any moment. Dean took Cas’ arm away from him. He didn’t say anything about it and neither did Cas though they both knew what just happened there. The fear of being discovered had won out over Cas’ affection.
There’s a banging on the door. Dean gives Benny his beer to hold while he goes to answer it. Must be the pizza he ordered, who else would be looking for him? He swings the door open.
He got up on his elbows to see Cas running towards the tree house holding the girls in both his arms. Their squeals of pure joy were the best sound he’d heard. Once safely secured in the treehouse, Cas turned back to Dean, eyes playfully predatory like, making a come-hither gesture with his hand.
Dean kissed Cas, pressed his lips against Cas’ chapped ones and then Cas was kissing Dean back. Kissing him back hard. Hands that had been used to kill Gordon reached around Dean’s waist pulling him in closer till their chests hit and it hurt Dean, but he didn’t care about the pain because Cas was attacking Dean’s mouth with all he had, and it was everything. Frantic and chaotic but sure and smooth just like every contradiction the Russian was to Dean. His lips moistened against Dean’s and when his hand moved back to tug at Cas’ hair it made the Russian gasp and Dean took the opening to slide his tongue in. He was rewarded with a groan and the pure filth of it sent a shockwave through his body.
“I wanted to apologies for my behaviour last week,” he starts with. Dean shifts on his couch out of the corner of his eye. “I didn’t mean it in the way I think you interpreted it as.”
As suspected, Dean had the cheerleader pressed up against the bookcase, her legs slightly parted and skirt riding up. Dean had one of his hands down the front of her panties, the other holding the side of her face as he continued to kiss her. Both of their cheeks slightly flushed, and Cas was pleasantly surprised how in control Dean looked in the situation. A far cry from the state he had been in on Cas’ bed. Memories of that encounter mixed in with his private show had Cas taking a grip of his cock over his jeans to get a hold of himself. His free hand grounding himself onto the bookcase.
It would be the first time he did this to Cas, not the first time he thought about it. Cas’ dick was something Dean had wanted to get up close and personal with for some time now. His hands and Cas’ dick were friends, good friends even and his mouth was starting to feel left out. He was patient though, something he needed to pretend to be able to build up to. A couple of weeks of hand jobs and frottage was enough patience in his book.
It wasn’t till the day before Thanksgiving that they both could get away from their kids, over a week since their conversation. Over a week of standing in the pre-school yard, a week of playdates and having to keep his hands to himself. It was torturous to say the least. Claire was spending Thanksgiving with her other Dad meaning Cas had a free house. It was sort of hilarious, felt like being back at high school sneaking around behind parents but they were doing it with their kids.
He stood outside of his cell for count. Cas climbed the stairs, shoulders tense, anger radiating off of him. The closer he got to Dean the more Dean could see how his usual spotless orange top was stained with what looked like splatters of tomato sauce. That didn’t make sense, they had mac and cheese for lunch and Wednesday’s dinner was meatloaf. He lined up beside Dean, eyes looked straight ahead. Dean looked down, noticed how the sauce was on his hands, in his fingernails and his knuckles were cut. Yeah, that wasn’t tomato sauce.
