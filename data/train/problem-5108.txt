Steve blinked and frowned, “You’ve what?” His hand ghosted over his right butt cheek self-consciously.
Tony followed the words and spoke them out to the best of his ability considering that Steve was using words that he wouldn’t use in everyday conversation. However, he somehow muddled through successfully.
He rose and stepped down from the stage until he was situated in front of the boy. Before he had the chance to even fully open his arms, the boy had run into his embrace. The cameras went mad, snapping photos that would doubtlessly make the front page. The tight hold of the tiny figure reminded Steve of exactly why he’d never wanted to hear. The deaf and hard of hearing community were full of the most special kids who needed someone to look up to and identify with. Steve was glad that for this kid that could be Captain America.
Steve began signing and suddenly the flashing of cameras suddenly exploded as many got the very first shots of Captain America signing in ASL. Every journalist in the room knew full well that this would make headlines despite the original story just being a regular interview. He watched the crowd suddenly become chaotic as he described his experience.
Steve’s eyes followed the lines in between the floor tiles as he answered, “I guess it’s not so bad. Out of everyone I don’t mind that it was you.”
He had only just received his drink when a figure appeared beside him. Usually he would wave off anyone approaching him when he had only just arrived but tonight he felt like letting loose and didn’t want to do that alone. His new companion seemed happy to dance too. With each sip of his drink, he could feel the tight muscles that had been contracting across his shoulders gently releasing.
“You're right I think it was that Wade kid that started the fight, we did get him from Hydra” Tony says huffing.
“Well stuff is really interesting what kind of stuff? Video games? Drawing? Science? Robots?” He’s pushing buttons.
“Peter it says that you’re sorry, it tells me that you didn't mean it and that you want to stay here, you said it yourself just now you hurt someone that cares about you. Peter you know that we care about you but do you know that we love you?” Steve rubs Peter’s shoulders to help him calm down.
Tony sat there for a minute, he watches Steve with Peter in the most recent stores they have gone too. They’re looking at pajamas onesies to be exact, ones with the avengers all over them and some with puppies and others with spiders. The thought of what those horrible people did to such a wonderful kid pops into his head as he watches his new family. “Don’t worry Peter no one will ever hurt you again” he sighs to himself.
Jack feels his hair being messed with but he can’t seem to move away. The door opens once again “You Gotta be kidding me” A grumpy voice grumbles
Peter runs towards Tony who is now running into the store “Tony!” Peter calls to him, Peter gets picked up once again “Steve punched a guy” he tells.
“M.J. he’s not a bad boy just look at his glasses, bad boys don’t have glasses” Gwen tells the other girl.
Steve puts the one with puppies back and puts the other two in the cart and picks up the little boy and holds him against his side. They make their way around the store putting things in the cart here and there when the voice of a man calls out.
The two boys move to get up, Peter heads for the elevator to go get changed and grab his stuff, Wade heads for his room to go get ready. Wade changes his clothes  before grabbing his bag and heading back out to the living room.
Steve and Tony talk to the teacher to see when class gets out, Steve watches Peter find a cubby for his stuff. A little girl with bright red hair walks over to Peter and introduces herself to him, Steve is ecstatic that he’s already got a new friend and points it out to Tony “look Tony he’s a ladies man” Steve chuckles teasing Tony.
“Well then maybe you need to get the whole story like Bruce and I did, You're being a bad Parent Tony” Nat hisses.
“Mr. Stark and Mr. Roger I’ll have to give you this permission slip for the field trip  in a couple of weeks, I’ll be taking the kids to a public exhibition on genetic engineering and science.” The teacher informs the men.
Gramps starts pouring the drinks then passes them to Jack “go serve them then you can hang out with your friend” Gramps grumbles.
“I’m going to stop the bleeding” Peter says with a smile “I use to get beat like that all the time by my foster families”
Peter knows what he did to Tony, it’s clear to him that the reason Tony is acting like this is all his fault. He hates himself for it so much that it’s making him sick. Looking at Tony he feels horrible for everything he said to him. If only he had just talked things out with him in the first place.
“Yeah bud I’m hungry so I’m going to eat, go play it’ll be more fun than watching me eat” Tony laughs.
It’s not funny. “How can they possible forget about me?! I mean Tony even sleeps next to me at night but it’s like I’m not even there anymore!” Steve raises his hands in a motion as if to give up.
“Awe I'm sorry dude” Wade looks back at the smaller boy “I hope you can work things out” he says softly going back to his game.
His father set the kid he was carrying down and went over to him, Wade stood there not looking at him. It came harder than last time “I Told You To Never As Father” his voice rose and the beating didn't stop. Hit after hit landed on Wade his face and stomach hurt so badly and yet he was helpless to do anything. Blood filled his vision, everything was blurry and all he could see was that boy. The man left Wade and the boy alone after he had enough.
The tears in Peter’s eyes hurt more than all of the ones that came before them. He doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know what to think. His body moves on it’s own ashe runs back to the elevator.
The loud noises stop and all he hears is whispering, he opens the door to the lab to see a couple of men in strange clothing. “Who are you guys?” he questions “are you supposed to be here?”
Peter nods and looks over at Wade “I was looking for him when they came up to me out of the blue” he says looking back at Steve “then one of them stomped on my glasses and the other was going to hurt me even more when Wade stepped in” he explains further.
There is no god, life is going to be blown into oblivion, Tony and Steve were definitely dead. Tony’s head hurt like no tomorrow and he could swear he felt a smaller body next to his. Steve felt like he was never going to wake up again, the comatose feeling held his body down into his side of the bed, what the hell is that small thing next to him?
It has been back and forth all over the place for Peter and Tony just doing thing together to help mend the damage they both have caused. Tony can’t seem to apologize enough for his own sake and Peter accepts it every time. Peter does little things for tony like make cute little trinkets that Tony has made a shelf for. Tony whenever he’s out he buy’s Peter a new stuffed animal that reminds him of one of the avengers that Peter cleared off his dresser for.
She waits for Clint to hurry up and blow things up. Clint finally gets back in the jet “come hurry we gotta go!” he yells before looking back to check on  Peter “Who is the second one?” he asks
They drive into the parking lot, Tony finds a parking space. Steve helps get Peter out of the car, Peter holds onto his hand and reaches for Tony’s “you can’t let go because I don’t want to get left here.” Peter states dryly at the two men.
They start to move on to a different spider when Peter feels something pinch the back of his neck, his hand goes back to swat whatever it was away and rub the spot the hurts.  Peter notices that he’s falling behind so he rushes to catch up with the group leaving a grumpy radioactive spider to crawl on the floor. Peter watches all of the different spiders crawl around in their cases before they move on to some other stupid thing.
They sit together and read a different book one that isn't about cutting people up or anything related to death at all, Peter had brought his book from home a small story book that one of his dad's had gotten him. The book was about a rabbit who had no home or a family, he was very scared just like him and Peter. The book made him feel like he could get away from this horrible life and have a good family like Peter and the rabbit.
The fridge is now plastered with math homework when Tony gets home. What on earth have Steve and Peter been up too? And who did all the math? Tony is about to call out for Steve when Peter and Wade magically appear next to him giggling like toddlers. “Hey Mr. Stark Peter is going to give you a run for your money” Wade laughs.
Peter holds his arms up as Steve cleans the injuries. Peter explains how the boys pushed him down on the playground after calling him a nerd and saying he was unwanted by his real parents. Steve listens calmly as he applies bandages to Peter’s elbows “So you didn’t start a fight and Wade was just defending you?” Steve confirms with Peter.
The blood drained from Steve’s face as he watches blood slowly drip from his poor baby’s elbows “Oh No Peter!” Steve picks Peter up as fast as he can and rushes him to the bathroom “why didn't you say anything you have been in so much pain! Oh my poor baby!” Steve says frantically looking for the first aid kit.
Jack looks down at his uniform then back at James “I'm running away from a place” he says looking down at his food
Natasha walks Wade into the common room with Peter “um Bruce sweetheart… I uh have some news for you” she half-heartedly laughs holding onto Wade’s shoulder.
“Maybe I Didn’t Want All Of This! At least not with a greedy bastard like you” Steve raises his voice only to lower it again for his words to hit harder.
“I must've done something wrong because Steve said he didn't want this life with me in it…” Peter whimpers.
He sits in the “Learning Room” and ‘reads’ a book that his father has selected for him to read. All he knows about this book is that it’s about how to cut people up and remove organs. Something a kid really shouldn’t be reading, he thinks to himself, “what do you mean something a kid shouldn't be reading? This stuff is great!” the voices in his head start talking again “Shut up!” Wade shouts at nothing. He throws the book at the wall as if it will help to make the voices stop talking. His dad though walks through the just as the book hit the wall.
They move to sit on the couch to talk about how to deal with handling Peter now that he is upset and dialing back on the punishment. Steve also has to make Tony apologize to Natasha and Bruce for how rude he was to them.
“Fine stay there, it doesn’t matter much.” Tony looks at the small boy on the other end of the couch “Look here kid, you’re my kid now, I don’t care if I made a poor impression on you but from now on no one is going to ever hurt you again and we’re going to protect you from anyone else who wants to hurt you.” Tony smiles at him.
“Sorry father.. But they were talking again.. I didn’t know what to do.” he could feel his voice tremble in fear.
The group of kids crowd around the case looking to see the spider, one of the students looks over at the lady “I don’t see it where is it?” he asks her  moving aside for her to look.
“Oh yeah I’m fine..” he says softly “I’m kind of a ‘fail experiment’ they wanted to give me powers that could kill people but all I can do is heal myself from fatal or non fatal injuries”
Peter laughs softly snuggling close to the two men “thanks guys” Peter sighs happily “this has made me feel a lot better.”
Steve laughs and puts the small child on the floor. He grabs Peter’s lunch and backpack before following Tony out the door, Peter following the two out.
Steve stops as his find the first aid kit and looks at Peter “oh Peter… Of course I would care I love you sweet heart” Steve says wiping Peter’s tears away. “No will you be a big boy and hold your arms up for me” Steve asks soothingly.
Peter was so overwhelmed with joy of being called son by the two men who adopted him that he couldn't stop crying, but he’ll let them think it’s because of what happened.
Tony was ecstatic on the inside, they got married and adopted a kid! How much better could this get?! He sits with the boy as Steve just stands there watching them “Steve come sit down before the food gets cold” he waves his hand at Steve.
“Oh jeez Wade why are you being so sappy? It’s like you’re a grandma who is saying goodbye to her grandkids” Jack laughs.
“Well if you’re so worried about what’s wrong then we should be spending more time together as a family” Steve sends a glare towards Tony.
They have spent three hours just spending all kinds of money on this kid. Tony can feel his credit and debit cards just getting drained. His soul is being sucked out of him by this kid. Tony can’t help but keep giving him what he wants, he’s just so happy! Then Steve comes at him with whatever he finds and gives Tony the puppy dog eyes, this isn’t fair.
“Well you seem to know my name so it’s a pleasure to meet you Peter” Steve smiles at the kid “what happened to your arm?” he asks
Bruce pulls her close “you did what you thought was right and I support you Nat.” He gives her a quick kiss “now I need to go run his DNA” Bruce leaves her to go fiddle with Wade’s DNA. Natasha laughs going her own way to write a report about what happened.
Steve laughs holding Tony close to him “you’re going to be the death of me someday”he says placing his lips against Tony’s.
Peter refuses to even go near Tony, the guilt would probably kill him. Well at least that’s how bad he felt, Peter knows that what he said to Tony hurt him deeply that’s why they’re both hurting so much. He never meant to hurt Tony as bad as he had, he just wanted him to feel hurt like he did to him. An eye for an eye, but no Tony took an eye and Peter had taken his heart. It’s very clear that he has done something every wrong.
“Steve and Tony are gonna end up getting divorced I've seen it happen before I’m going to go back into the system… I can’t lose you Wade I need you” Peter says tears welling up in his eyes.
Wade is taken aback for a moment, “Friends? This kid has to be kidding! No one wants to be friends with us!” the voices chime in “Yes we’re friends” Wade glares at the air around them.
“It’s not all of a sudden” Tony explains “I've wanted one ever since Thena was born.. She’s so cute and sometimes really sweet” he huffs “I just really want a kid of our own.”
“No I was pulled from school a week ago for telling on my foster mom” he says looking out the window.
“Don’t call me sir for one, and  for two I know you’re not sleeping so I got a proposition for you” he grins down at the boy patting his head.
Alright one down three to go. Tony enters the elevator again and makes his way his lab where he assumes Bruce will be. He waits quietly for the elevator to ding for him to get off.
Astonishment crosses Bruce’s face when he takes off the makeshift bandages off, Wade’s injuries have completely healed “what is the meaning of this?” he asks the eight year old.
Steve takes his words by surprise “wait you want to have a kid?” Steve asks “why all of a sudden?” he kisses Tony’s temple.
Wade wakes up to a loud commotion outside his room, he looks over at his clock to see it was almost noon, his dad must have just gotten back from an early morning mission. He quickly gets up and dressed so he looks presentable for his father. Wade peeks out from his room to see if the coast is clear, which it is. He makes a break for the “Learning Room” or so his father calls it.
“Well yeah! I yelled at Tony.. I hurt him very badly.” Peter looks down at away from Steve as tears start to well up in his eyes “I hurt one of the only people that has ever cared about me.”
Peter goes to the common area of the tower to meet up with Wade. When he gets there the place seems to be empty. Wade is on the couch playing a videogame with the volume way down. Peter sits next to him on the couch and watches him.
Once the doors are open he finds Bruce with Wade, Bruce is showing Wade how to fix a toaster for some odd reason… Maybe Bruce broke a toaster. “Um.. Bruce, Wade… I need t o apologize to you for the things I said…” Tony says to the man and the boy.
Steve smiled, taking the cup that Tony offered, and clinked their glasses before they began to drink.
“Look I'm sorry for what I said to you I was in the wrong” Tony says huffing softly “I am sincerely sorry for calling you a bad parent. You’re a wonderful mother and I see that now… will you please forgive me?” Tony gravels to Nat.
The door bursts open to reveal a very angry Tony “Peter Why Did You Have To Start A Fight?!” he yells before walking briskly way “You have detention for a week.”  he says a bit calmer.
Peter is sitting in his room, on his bed, curled up in the fetal position. He yawns and rubs his eyes, he just wants to sleep. There’s a knock at his door that startles him to the point he falls out of bed. He rushes to get up and run over to the door “who is it?” he ask through the door.
“He has healing abilities” he rubs her shoulder “he said he can heal from fatal and non fatal injuries”
It seems to be the time of the year to start wearing sweaters again in New York City, Steve Rogers was out for his daily run in Central Park. Steve was starting to feel the cold bite at his nose as he made his third lap around the park and his boyfriend, Tony Stark. He loved that man more than his own life and of course he would give his life to that stubborn, egotistical, jackass of a man.
Peter sat in the cart watching Steve, this man had just called him his son and defended him. He couldn't help but let the tears start streaming down his cheeks. “We- we better go check out before the cops get called” he stutters.
Peter did what he said he would do and starts to put tissues on Wade’s face where the biggest of the cuts are. Peter puts a little tape on the tissues to help them stay so it’s like a bandaid. “There that’s the best I can do” Peter says smiling at Wade.
Tony comes back up to their floor only to see Wade standing with Steve and Peter. “Peter I Told You I Don’t Want You Hanging Out With Him!” Tony yells again.
Wade can feel everything as it burned with pain. The boy ran over to Wade to make sure that he is okay, of course he’s not though. “Are you okay?” his voice is soft “do you need help?” so soft. Wade can’t help but lean into this boy who is he? What is he doing here? The voices comment.
Thank you all for reading so far, I love getting all of your comments it's great. I'm glad you all like it and I will try to update as much as I can.
“I’m sorry for saying you're a bad parent Bruce, you're a good father to this boy and Wade I’m sorry for accusing you of being a bad influence on Peter you’re a good kid I see that now.. Will you please forgive me for being so incompetent?” Tony asks hopefully.
Wade and Jack were like old times the best of friends, they’ll be friends forever while that bratty Peter will weasel his way in. Jack will be happy just as long as he can always have Wade by his side. Wade will be happy as long as Peter and Jack never leave him.
“I love you too Steve” Tony laughs making his way to the door “clean clothes on the counter” he says before shutting the door.
“What do you mean they don’t want you anymore?” Wade asks holding the younger boy close with comforting him on his mind.
Something inside Natasha broke and she could feel motherly instincts kicking in “well now you're both coming home with me” she says “first let's go find your dad”
“Yes he does, now what do you need to do to help him feel better?” Steve asks trying to get Peter to go talk to Tony.
Steve glares at the man “excuse you but I’m spending time with my son who are you to give me your input on who I’m raising?” Steve sets Peter in the cart with all of his soon-to-be new things.
Bruce leaves the lab through a different door. Now is Peter’s chance to talk to Tony. Now he can make things right and everything can go back to being happy. Hopefully. Peter walks into the lab and clears his throat, Tony looks in the direction of the sound and is shock to see Peter.
Tony turns back into the elevator to go back up to his floor where he needs to make amends with his son now. Hopefully it’ll be just as easy as the last three have been.
Tony pulls off all of his layers leaving him in his long sleeve shirt and jeans, he hangs up his jacket and scarf on the hooks by the bedroom door. Steve strips his clothes and turns on the shower, letting it warm up before he steps into the shower. Tony grabs clean clothes from Steve’s drawer before making his way to the bathroom. He opens the door letting out the steam, he sets the clothes on the counter and picks up the dirty clothes.
Again left to be ignored Steve huffs and leaves the floor opting for his shared floor.  Peter and Tony have already left for school so Tony should be back in time to keep ignoring Steve to go to work. Steve is really starting to feel like an underappreciated housewife.
The boys look at each other then back at Peter before they push him down. As Peter falls down his glasses fall to the ground, one of the boys stomps on his glasses breaking the lenses. Peter lands on the hard ground busting his elbows as he reaches futilely for his glasses.
Peter was playing in the livingroom of his fathers’ floor, there was suddenly a black out and some loud noises coming from his dad’s lab. Peter gets up to go investigate, “Dad?” Peter calls into the room.
Peter looks at Tony his heart shattering into little pieces. “Why can't you just listen for a minute yourself… your husband is trying to tell you something and you won't even hear my side of the story like him.. “ Peter says softly.
Peter sits in his seat at school ready to learn and not get into anymore fights. Gwen looks over at him and smiles “I heard about the fight are you okay?” she asks sweetly.
Tony pouts the rest of the party about being called old, he’s not old! He hasn't even hit middle aged yet how dare that brat call him old! He takes back ever wanting kids.  Steve notices Tony pouting and goes over to comfort him, He sits next to Tony and wraps his around his shoulder. Tony leans into Steve “I think I want to have a kid…” Tony says out of the blue.
Peter looks up in confusion at Steve. What could he mean by this? What does that say about him? What does it tell Steve? “What?” Peter asks not understanding where Steve is going with this.
“Sorry Natasha…” Peter says softly as the memory of what Steve said coming back to stab him in the back again.
Tony Looks at the Super soldier's changed expression “what’s wrong Stebe?” Tony laughs softly leaning against Steve.
“Sandra stay here I'll get him” the first male walks over and picks Jack up “he’ll be alright right Pops?”
“Careful Black Widow I might think you’re flirting with the good ol’ Cap here~” Bruce walks in from the elevator.
The kiss was short and sweet, the promise of many more to come laced their lips together. ‘I love you’s promise them forever and after, nothing could break the bonds that they have made. They part only for a moment before Tony places a quick peck against Steve’s lips. The doors open to their floor and Tony is the first to get off the elevator.
Wade laughs at him “Weasel you're funny they aren't talking about anything important” he explains “if they were I wouldn’t be here”
Wade sits with Peter in his room, Peter shows him all of the new things that he got recently. “You’ll be getting a whole bunch of new stuff too Wade, but until then you can have something of mine to sleep with” he says holding out his stuffed animals. “You can have anyone that you want” he smiles at Wade.
Wade and Peter laugh as they play their game. Tony rummages through the fridge  for something to eat, no luck just fruit. He sighs and decides to go with an apple, at least he can stand apples. He turns to watch the kids as he closes the door to the fridge. A chuckle escapes him as he sees how happy Peter and Wade are together.  This is how a family should be.
Steve walks out all dressed and with wet hair “He’s not wrong Peter, you’re our son now and we will love you as such, so let’s get to know each other how bout it little guy” Steve holds out his hand to Peter smiling. Peter looks at his hand before taking it.
“Oh well I guess I need to step up my game so I don’t lose you to the first person who offers you a ring” Tony jokes laughing.
At recess Peter looks around for Wade and Weasel, Steve said that they should be in school together though those two would be in the Second Grade a year above him. Peter makes his way around the entire playground looking for Wade. In his search for his friend two bigger boys approach him. “Look at the little nerd boy with the two dads” one of them teases.
“I was taken in by ‘The Black Widow’” Wade whispers pointing at the redhead “her name is Natasha and she’s my mom”
Tony stands outside of Peter’s room, he holds his breath as he knocks on the door “hey buddy I’m coming in” he says softly.
The rest of the day goes pretty fast for the two boys, Peter does his work and Wade sleeps during class. Nat comes to pick them up after school gets out. They go home and get ready for their great escape.
“It’s okay Peter, I’m the one who should be sorry.. Anyways it’s time for school  so you should go get ready” she motions for them to get ready.
The two of them make it to the lobby of the tower, they walk over to the elevator. Tony pushes the button to go up. The doors open and they step inside, Steve pushes the button to their shared floor. Ever since they became a couple Steve moved onto Tony’s floor. OF course they didn't share a room until they both felt comfortable enough to take it to that level.
The three sit in silence for the rest of the class. The teacher talks to the students about the upcoming field trip. The field trip is a day from now so all Peter could think about is how he’s so happy that today was his last day of detention. The detention teacher makes him do math work but to him that’s not really a punishment. He loves math, math gives a simple right or wrong.
“Clint’s at a dog show with Lucky in France, Natasha and Bruce are traveling in Europe, and the Asgardians are gone. The Tower is ours, Steve. Let’s celebrate~”
Tony tenses for a moment “do you remember all of their names?” his voice is angry but his eyes are of a killer. Steve understands his feelings but hunting people down and hurting them isn't going to help anything.
Steve quickly finishes his shower so he can get dressed. Tony was already down in the Common area waiting for Steve, Thor was holding his daughter on his shoulders bouncing her up and down. Jane is just  happy to hear the laughter. The thought of having a family with Steve pops into Tony’s head oh how much he wants to have a son or daughter with him. They could move out of the city and go to the countryside they would be the cool family that lives on the countryside.
“This is Wade Wilson… our son” she smiles petting the boy's hair “I adopted him and he needs some first aid”
“Oh Peter is a math wiz! And he’s going to be helping me with my math from now on!” Wade laughs clinging to Peter.
Steve stops in front of Tony “come on let’s go home Grumpy-Gus” he chuckles taking Tony’s hand in his larger one.
hey um I'm sorry this chapter is so short... I just haven't been feeling all that good emotional recently and I haven't been able to get past that writers block I'll try to get another chapter out soon
“Okay well let’s go buy me stuff” Peter says pulling Steve to the elevator, Tony takes Steve’s other hand. The three of them stand awewarkly in the elevator waiting to let them off in the lobby.
Peter laughs softly as he bashfully scratches the back of his head “yeah it’s kinda a hobby.” he explains.
When he was close enough to the doctor he placed his dark brown satchel beside his leg and gripped the man's hands tightly in a handshake. And the laws of social behaviour meant that the doctor imitated the same action, placing his own bag close to Steve's and grabbing the man’s hand.
Once they touched it seemed impossible to pull their hands away as they explored each other’s bodies eagerly. Steve moaned gently against Tony’s lips as he could feel a heat beginning to pool inside his belly. He guided his hands across the other man’s chest keenly, feeling at the muscle hidden by the shirt.
The short man sighed too, "I can't..." The whole table began to groan in desperation when he piped up again,"But I might know someone who can."
Resting a gentle hand on his blond hair, she soothed, “We’ll see what we can do for you.” But it didn’t sound promising.
Temptation leaked into his expression. He'd always help Clint no matter what as they were like brothers but was this pushing too far against his morals. He wasn't to be a part of an organisation again like when he was in the military.
“Do you know why I paired you, detectives? It’s because you are the best detectives we have in this precinct and putting you together will mean that we solve more crimes and faster which is, in case you forgot, your job! And God knows we need our arrest numbers up this month. So, you will work together without another word of complaint. Understood?”
“You guys should unionize. Get better conditions than this literal mouldy cellar.” He joked but Romanoff didn’t laugh or even react to him speaking.
Barton threw his hands up innocently, "Actually, I saw you running so I was coming to get you. It's your fault you don't look where you're going." He smirked, "Didn't your mommy tell you to always look both ways before crossing the street?"
"No!" Bruce jumped in, worried they behind to hear about some human eating centaur again, "I'm sure Shield have a process for this kind of thing. Just wait until Fury gets in."
“Okay, look. Jokes aside. I just came to say I’m sorry. We should have said that stuff about you being uptight and a prude. And I, especially, shouldn’t have jumped on the bandwagon before I really knew anything about you.” His eyes glazed over the contents of the room, hesitant to face the unforgiving stare Steve was probably shooting his way. The man would be rightfully furious at Tony still. This wasn’t something he could see Steve just glossing over. The idea that he had hurt Steve made a flood of guilt wash over him and a frown creased his brow as he considered how he had never really considered his colleague’s feelings until recently. Now he suddenly couldn’t stop worrying about the other man.
When you’re growing up, you’re told that you’ll find a partner, get married, have babies and live happily every after. Nobody seems interested in all the complexities that come in between. However, Tony and Steve were beginning to find out how complex it can be but maybe they’ll find their own solutions.
“Mr Jenkins, I swear if you’ve forgotten your key again I will be driven to murder and, yes, I can make it look like an accident.” She spoke without waiting for him to speak.
“You’re sick?” Tony would lie in the future and pretend that his mind didn’t leap straight to sexually transmitted diseases. Creases folded between his eyebrows as he watched his date drop his head into his hands.
He twisted around, despite the screaming of his side, and pushed out the door. He was out in mere milliseconds, already pacing in front of the vehicle. Clint sighed again, watching him in the headlights for a moment before joining his friend.
The soldier stood and Tony followed his motion. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a patch that didn’t look much bigger than a postage stamp. After peeling the backing off, Tony reaches up to position the sticky patch behind Steve’s right ear. His hand lingered there for a moment as their eyes met again. Steve’s heart began to race.
Doctor Erskine approached him with a smile, “Perfection. Now to get you a prosthesis and get you back on the battlefield, soldier.”
“Oh gosh.” He covered his face with his large hands. It was definitely a bad idea giving a man like Tony such sensitive information.
Somewhere over the last two days, Tony had had the violent epiphany that he was not made for the barista lifestyle; he’d burnt himself more times than he could count, got orders mixed up and even tripped and thrown close to boiling water over his boss. Luckily for him, being a barista didn’t have to be his calling but it was the calling of his fake identity, Marvin Short, and he’d donned glasses, worn a wig and shaved his goatee especially. Hopefully, the burns and general fuck ups wouldn’t give away his total inadequacy.
He immediately clicked Clint's number as he had no idea who else to call in such a situation. He had no boss, friends or family that'd care for him. The phone began to dial and dial and dial with no answer from his only friend. He huffed a laugh at the irony; the one time he's ever needed the smaller male. He considered his options for a moment but his spinning head indicated that he was running out of time to choose. Steve reacted fast, selecting one of the only other numbers stored in his cell: Tony Stark.
A tear rolled down his cheek, “Get it together. He needs this.” He hissed to himself and wiped it away on their blanket.
Natasha peered up at him in surprise, “You did?” She shook her head, “I always assumed Tony would make the first move since you were denying the fact you had chemistry!”
The solider gave his partner a very pointed look before he slammed the lights off. It took Tony a moment to realise that he now couldn’t communicate with Steve and he stood with his mouth open for a moment.
“No, Steve. I’m just saying maybe you should give him a chance instead of jumping to conclusions. After all, you haven’t even worked on a case with him before.” After she saw her message was sinking in she lifted her foot and stepped back. “Anyways, hiding in this dingy file room won’t help anyone. It’s dusty and stinks of damp.”
"Wha? Noo. There's blood everywh-" His sentence dipped off suddenly as he dipped in and out of consciousness.
It was that second that they finally saw each other through the haze of their misinterpretation and confusion. They'd both made assumptions and believed wrongly about the other. In that moment, the tension that had been steadily rising since they’d first kissed came pouring back at double the intensity. In the silence, the only sound was their breathing as the stared at each other; neither wanting to be the one to make the first move.
“Stark, the top brass are demanding more progress on the Rogers case. We need to start acting offensively in our evidence building. I need you to go undercover in a coffee shop close to Rogers’ hide out to try and get some more intel. At this point, any piece of information would help.” He passed the file across. It had details of Tony’s undercover identity and the coffee store he was to pose in.
His laugh came out in a huff, “That, I can’t deny.” They chuckled together for a couple of seconds before they were interrupted.
“I have given it a lot of thought.” Steve spoke slowly and calmly. He ignored the scathing look Stark threw in his direction, “You need sex, Tony. It’s so ingrained in you. But I... I don’t like sex so it only makes sense for you to fulfil your... needs somewhere else.”
The clouds threatened a storm and the two men, looking anxiously up at the sky, began the ten minute walk from the coffee house back to the Tower. They were returning from a successful first date that hopefully would not be sabotaged by the rain. They chatted lightheartedly about their drinks, their weeks and their futures whilst keeping half an eye on the looming weather.
Steve, on the other hand, was mid-hand to hand combat with a bot. His eyes were solely focused on disabling the bot in his arms. He didn’t hear the metal plummeting towards him, now only meters away.
Unprepared for this sudden intrusion, the criminal ran straight into the side of the car with a large banging sound, sending them cascading to the ground in a groaning heap. Technically, he couldn’t sue them as he had run full speed into a parked car by his own volition. Tony peered down at the criminal when the car window buzzed down.
“Yep, I’ve got the paperwork in my office. I’ll show you later.” It was a promise that Rogers remained true to some time later and it proved that they were legally registered as a charity, much to Tony’s surprise.
He moved around the dance floor, swaying and dancing. He span Tony around as the smaller man laughed and grinned. Steve wasn't the best singer but his voice was workable and it made Tony smile which was the main thing.
“Tony, I-I can’t hold off any longer.” The soldier groaned. The gentle touches and kissing had meant that he’d Egan to get excited long before Tony had even started.
Steve could hear the familiar game over the radio. He eyed the woman carefully before asking, “Where am I really?” Even the air coming through the open window had a different scent to it, too clear and sterile.
They landed a street over from the epicentre and the team quickly ran towards the beast. It was easy to find as screams and the sounds of it breaking things echoed out from its location. Thor and Tony took off into the air to get a location on the thing and guide the team in. Rocket blasters at full, Tony was powering ahead so it was only by pure coincidence that he glanced back to the team. He had to double take when he noticed Steve was falling behind; usually Steve took the leadership role on missions and lead the group during the fight. Something seemed off to the genius so he quickly curved around and headed back despite Thor’s confused looks.
Clint laughed and set the vehicle going again. He turned in the opposite direction of the warehouse and sped away.
The younger man's lips curled slightly in the corners at the obscure reference. Even Steve, someone who tends to avoid too much tv, could understand that. He slurped at the water until the cup was nearly empty and he could feel the life being returned to his throat. He had the energy to appreciate that Stark understood Frankenstein to be the scientist though, not the creature.
She led him over to the living room and encouraged him to sit down while never taking her eyes from his clearly distressed face. He continued to dry the droplets of water from his blond hair.
Steve couldn’t help but burst out into laughter and grin ear from ear. His instantaneous panic after the kiss was beginning to melt away as he peered at Tony’s reflecting smile. His underlying feelings bubbled up to that monumental moment.
"How did you get my number and why are you calling me, Mr Stark?" He whispered back, voice as cold as ice. He'd been promised by Clint and Shield that nobody outside of those he'd confirmed would have access to his cell number. He wanted to avoid situations like this exact one.
Without another word, Tony was left standing outside the bar on his own as Steve rushed away. The other man’s name died on his lips as he realised calling after him would be useless. The remaining detective peered around the dark streets and sighed to himself mournfully. He had never been in a single relationship where he didn’t somehow screw it up.  He’d lost all hope of being with Steve so he could only pray that the man didn’t tell Fury about what had happened. Steve didn’t seem like the type of man to seek revenge but then he was a fan of sticking strictly to the rule book.
Tony lowered his mouth onto Steve’s dick and moved all the way down until he could feel the throbbing tip pressed against the very back of his throat. Having learnt to deep throat years earlier, this posed no issue and the genius took him deeper. Moaning, Steve curled his fingers in the dark hair as Tony continued his ministrations. The deep warmth was too much for him.
Google didn’t exist when Steve Rogers was growing up so he never had the opportunity to google whether he was normal or not. If he’d had someone there to guide him a little bit better in the sexuality department then maybe he would have felt a lot different about himself. Luckily, a certain Tony Stark might be exactly the person he’s looking for.
The man’s lips were moving rapidly and it looked like he was calling to someone in between talking to Steve. In that moment Steve bet himself that Tony had talked to him the whole time he’d been in hospital despite his lack of hearing. Although, on reflection, somewhere in his subconscious he had a vague memory of someone manipulating his hand to form letters from the sign alphabet like a code. If he had been more conscious then he would have heard of the device that Tony had begun to develop which looked like a smart watch and would turn anything said on the intercom into text so he could be alerted to danger.
Steve laughed slowly, “Good luck getting enough evidence for that. Are you free tomorrow? You’re welcome to come and visit us since you must be struggling to get any good intel from up the street here.”
As soon as he had fled from the room Natasha popped up from the other side of the bed where she’d been hiding on the floor. She placed the spoon, which is what she originally ducked down to get, back on the side table beside the orange jello. Her glare was pretty severe as Nat crossed her arms and tutted at him reproachfully.
"I didn't doubt that considering how antisocial you are." He joked. There was the sound of ice clinking in a glass cup.
A thought popped into Tony’s head, He hasn’t opened his eyes so he clearly doesn’t want to talk to me.
The smile made his stomach clench slightly as Steve rarely displayed such a charming and light-hearted grin around him. He felt himself flush as Rogers continued staring at him with soft eyes.
The idea of a late night run had been close to genius as it helped him clear his mind and unwind. However, somewhere along the line something had gone terribly wrong and he was now lying on the tiled ground floor of Stark tower with only a handful of meters between him and the elevator.
“Fury? Oh yeah, Stark’s right here with me. Okay? 10 minutes. We’re on our way.” He hung up and looked up at Tony, “Get the suit.”
His commanding officer was going to absolutely murder him since, once again, he’d been unable to capture one of the most dangerous men in the whole of New York. Sighing, he finished gathering his things and paced out to his Boss’s office ready for a dressing down. Tony only hoped that Captain Fury would go easy on him considering he would be beating himself up over this for weeks.
Fury was waiting for them by the time everyone had settled down, “First let’s welcome Detective Rogers back” Natasha clapped the loudest despite her face reflecting no emotion. Steve blushed from where he was sat in the seat beside her, “Okay, now. First things first, Stark and Rogers, you two have a case this week that’ll need some undercover work.” He paused to make time for both men to protest but none came. He pretended not to be surprised as he continued. There had be rumours circulating the office that there had been a 180 in Tony and Steve’s relationship but this was the first instance he had seen that confirmed that.
"Of course I could if I wanted. Easy enough but it's safer for him to remain hidden so I'm not risking his life simply to drag him back here just because you have a thing for him."
“What?”Tony was not prepared for this confrontation. He hoped that Steve, like himself, would be happy living a life where they never communicated again due to his mistake, “What are you talking about?”
"You clearly don't know the first thing about him! Or assassins in general!" The blond man ran his fingers through his hair causing it to spike up. "Captain is stubborn and fatally independent while assassins are the sneakiest and most deceptive bastards you can ever meet!"
The archer took to the stage, he had a projector behind him and just as he started pictures from Steve and Tony’s time together started appearing on the screen. Many of the photos, they grooms weren’t even sure they’d ever shared with him.
He nodded despite his brain barely taking in her words. Her brief visit ended quickly as another patient called out to her in pain. It would have been a perfect time for him to reflect on the surgery but drugs were still pounding around his system so he hadn’t quite realised that he was now an amputee. Besides, the drugs eased him into a fitful sleep after only a few more heartbeats anyway.
The inky darkness moved until the stranger was close enough to form a silhouette against the background. He was too drugged up to fully react how he should so just continued frowning at the figure.
The next time Tony woke up he could hear Steve moving around the bedroom but he didn’t want to open his eyes to face the day so he just listened. Something sounded strange. Footsteps were distorted or oddly placed and a slight metal clicking sound was interspersed between the footsteps.
“Rogers has been waiting for you in his office.” That’s all she said as she lead the cop throughout the cold and bare corridor. It was all cement walls and cement floor which was made worse by the fact that there were no windows in the corridor so harsh and flickering overhead lights was the only illumination.
One by one they jumped from the jet, Tony taking off in the suit, Thor flying off too whilst the others used parachutes. He watched them drop down below where he was hovering before zooming off to kick some bad guy butt.
Steve decides to have fun on his own so heads out to a gay nightclub. This doesn't exactly go to plan when he bumps into Detective Stark while on the dance floor.
Steve had only agreed on the condition he remained basically anonymous to Shield on a whole. That was going to be a challenge considering how he had basically just swung in through a window, setting off every alarm in the whole building sending every staff member into a frenzy.
To say that Tony was already riled up before the famous Steve Rogers had even stepped through the door was an understatement. His hands slapped unnecessarily hard against his equipment as he searched through data whilst trying to ignore Bruce’s concerned gaze darting over at him. Everything had been going perfectly well for the Avengers when they suddenly decide to bring in Captain Coldballs from the freezer. He’d got the sense, just from the way he’d heard the crew talking of Captain America, that their personalities wouldn’t quite click. Besides, someone had said that Steve thought he was nothing without his armor. He’d been ready to come face to face with the national icon for hours and his hands twitched in preparation to start throwing punches.
Clint hung up. He knew Steve well enough to know the man would be too out of his head on pain meds to make much sense. He'd send a text though with the same instructions in case he didn't understand.
The memory of it brought back bad memories as he could still remember the absolute all-consuming nature of the pain, the panic of his troops and the feeling of complete helplessness as he was stretchered back to base. He’d only recalled the actual event a handful of times and that was mainly because he had no choice.
. He ensured he mentioned his pride as he could foresee the next question asking if he was going to try and hear.
Clint threw his arms in the air exasperatedly, "He's a master assassin! Did you really think you could just leave him in a room alone? You know how stubborn he is!"
It was a couple of hours later that Tony realized that his husband had vanished. Luckily, the man was easy to find as he was out on the empty balcony peering up at the stars. He jumped when Tony’s gentle hand rested on his back.
He spoke as though his transgression was more than obvious and Tony was just playing dumb, “I made a move on you when it was unwanted.”
It was the sudden ringing of the doorbell that snapped him from his trance and forced him to manoeuvre off the soft cushions to see who had decided to make his day unendingly more interesting. At this point, a single letter, even a bill, would brighten his gray day: at least he’d be able to spend a few minutes reading over what was written there.
“It’ll be okay. You can get through this.” Tony offered even though he knew that the words would mean nothing.
He sighed contentedly and smiled as he spoke, “You know, before I met you I didn’t think I’d ever get to spend my life with anyone. I’d been rejected and cast aside so many times. I’m so lucky to have found you.” He turned and watery, blues eyes met brown.
Resting against his pillows, he flicked on the lamp beside his bed and, for the first time, fully took in his leg. His thigh stopped a few inches above where his knee would have previously been. The scar tissue was old and faded due to the serum so didn’t have the angry red marks he would have had previously. With the gentle fingers of an artist, Steve’s touch ghosted across his stump and he flinched at the illusion of pain. Phantom pain, he’d been told about it. The longer he inspected it, the more acceptance filled his heart. More than anything, he was just pleased it was him that stood on the mine rather than one of his squad.
“Stark!” Steve snapped, Tony turning everything into a joke or an opportunity to make a jab was one of Steve’s greatest pet peeves about the other detective. H crossed his arms and leant back further into his seat.
The assassin shook his head, "They weren't the first and won't be the last. I was, and am, ready." He peered straight into Stark's soul with his stone cold gray eyes.
“I technically am still in the vehicle.” He said seriously before his straight lips began to curl into a guilty, adrenaline fuelled grin. He couldn’t believe just how good it felt to actually get out of the apartment and do some actual police work!
It wasn't very often Natasha had the word 'tried' associated with her. She was a 'doer' person. She gracefully dumped herself in one of the the chairs at the table.
He sloped back up to the elevator broodingly whilst knowing he'd have to ring Clint to keep him up to date with what had just happened. It really wasn't safe for the man out on the street while he was hurt and dozens of people had a price on his head. The spy would inevitably throw a trantrum over Tony losing his mentor and then Fury would call him in to have 'words' about responsibility. He sighed and wished Captain wasn't so stubborn or skilfully stealthy.
Natasha was somehow leaning against an unsteady box of files without knocking it off. Her arms were crossed and her brows were folded into a deep frown that he knew meant bad news for him. She definitely knew something.
It must have been the loud flash of thunder that caused Steve to bolt upright in bed with his heart racing at 10 times it’s usual pace. The darkness surrounded him closely making his panic intensify and the loud crashing of the storm outside didn’t help the situation. The pitch black drew him unwillingly back to the war zone where the silence of night always felt ominous and foreboding as though they were merely waiting for attack. Blinking rapidly, the ex-soldier frantically attempted to fight the draw of a flashback.
“Oh my god, Steve!” He dropped down so he was eye height with his friend, “Are you okay? Nat, will he be okay?”
“There, the man said it.” Tony said, raising an eyebrow at his Captain. He still couldn’t figure out why he was again sticking up for Rogers so much since they had only partnered up once.
“Okay, good start.” Steve coughed awkwardly. He really hoped that his face wouldn’t flush red, “I really like kissing you a lot so that’s fine. Touching is fine like above the belt? Sex and masturbation make me really uncomfortable... Um,...” The soldier wracked his brains for anything else Tony needed to know.
Tony was next and, out of everyone he'd met so far, had the most hostile reaction to Steve's presence. He immediately slumped down into one of the leather chairs and glared at the stranger. Eventually he sighed and swivelled towards Clint.
Meanwhile, Steve’s neighbors were growing increasingly antsy at the current state of affairs. A man had spent the last hour on the wet doorstep of their building alternating between pressing the buzzer and calling up to Steve’s dark window. Many hands hovered over 911 as they watched him carefully but he showed no sign of leaving.
It was gone 3am and Steve couldn’t move from the floor. The cold of the tile was seeping through his sweats and chilling his flesh. Only a few hundred meters from the tower a sharp shooting pain radiated out from his amputation site. He’d experienced it before and had been told all about phantom pains after his surgery but this was unlike any he’d experienced before. It felt like he’d stepped on the mine all over again and his muscle had been torn from his shattered bone.
“If his style is anything like my own, this is the power source.” She held up a small, obviously empty container. “What was in this, Friday?”
Bucky speaks first “Tony, I uh, have a confession to make. I didn’t really intend to keep it a secret, it just kind of happened. Steve & I have been fucking like we have since we were boys. I hope you can forgive me and allow me to continue my relationship with you,
Turns out this second chapter is what probably needs retcon-ing. But I might've fixed it. Either way, I hope you guys liked it.
“In a sense. Iron Man is part of the Avengers.” FRIDAY brought up still images of four apparently-normal-sized people, a large green guy, and the Iron Man suit fighting in what appeared to be New York. Toni could see in the background of each that they were all fighting on the same side. She pointed to each in turn to check with FRIDAY that they were the same in this universe. She pointed at the sandy-colored hair, male, using a bow, “Hawkeye.” Then the intimidating woman with the red hair “Black Widow.” The large Nordic blond with brick-like hammer in hand “Thor.” “The big green guy’s the Hulk obviously.” She lingered on the final guy of the group. This world could be drastically different than hers. FRIDAY hadn’t mentioned there being a United States, but there could be no mistaking the stars & stripes, could there? “And this is Captain America?” It came out as more of a question than she would’ve liked.
Steve then says “I’m so glad for you, Buck. Now we just have to find Iron Man. Tony, do you know where we could find him?”
Toni’s eyes widened. “Are you implying what I think you’re implying?” She looked down at the toned, muscular body she found herself in. FRIDAY pulled up a Fox News article on the display, headlined with something offensively ignorant to the effect of “Captain America is gay!” Toni had no intent to read the article, with the headline confirming that the Fox News in this universe was probably just as bad. But the picture below it showed two men, one blond and buff, wearing a military dress uniform, and the other looking very much like her father even though he appeared to have made a very specific effort not to. The caption of the photo read “Captain America spends raucous night on the town with notorious playboy Tony Stark. Is the Captain becoming Stark’s new boytoy?” Clearly it had not been a mistake to work with SHIELD, part Hydra or not.
Tony is suited up as Iron Man. Steve asks him if he’s ever thought about sex with a man before. Iron Man answers yes, that it seems enjoyable. Steve is very excited and asks if he would jack him off. Tony remembers what Bucky said about Iron Man & Steve and agrees.
Toni inspected the machine in front of her, well, him at the moment. So Tony was trying to use this to go back in time. Fix something he thought he’d screwed up. There were several things she thought she’d screwed up. Making weapons at all might have been one of them. But without the weapons, there’d be no Iron Man either, and it was clear that this Tony felt the same way about the Iron Man. So what was he trying to fix? She turned a circuit board over in her hands.
In a few wordless steps, Steve had crossed the length of the workshop. He took Tony’s face in his hands, and Toni could feel the warmth of the immediate oxytocin response. They must have been so close, so intimate for the body’s memory to still feel so strong with another mind inside it. Steve’s lips gently met Tony’s…
