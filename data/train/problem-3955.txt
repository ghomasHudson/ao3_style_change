While he waits, Dean’s gaze travels through the room, only stopping when his eyes land on Jo. Urgently, without really meaning to, his body stiffens and prepares for a fight, ready to convince Cas of at least healing Jo before disappearing forever possibly forever. Before he’s able to speak up, though, Cas leaps towards him, Dean’s body tensing further in surprise as Cas drapes his body over his awkwardly.
“Shut up.” Dean said, shoving Sam slightly as he was about to sit in his seat, making him miss and hit the edge of the seat next to him instead. Sam was laughing at Dean so much he didn’t even care, just righted himself and tried to stop laughing.
Next Dean got hugged by Bobby and Ellen as they also congratulated him, Castiel was busy being hugged by both his brothers at the same time. Dean didn’t get hugged by the other Novak’s, but he did get a handshake and a slap on the back from them both. When everyone had sat back down Bobby asked a question that no one else had even thought to ask yet.
It was true that Castiel’s apartment probably wasn’t big enough for a baby. It was a small one-bedroom apartment, with a small kitchen/lounge room and one bathroom. When Castiel had graduated college he just wanted a place he could afford that was big enough for him, and this place had been enough, but luckily he was only on a month-to-month lease as he planned to move into a slightly better place once he could afford it. A few months ago Dean had thought this to soon, but now they were having a baby and he couldn’t see a reason not to now. “Cas, what if you move in with me?” Dean asked.
The huff, as familiar as it is although usually not directed towards himself, immediately clues him in on the other person’s identity. “Jo?” He asks, kind of relieved.
Sam's face turns into a bitch face, but he doesn't complain, and when he turns to face the window, he does it to hide the small secret smile that appears at getting his brother back.
On the other hand, he'll probably encounter the same employee as the night before and he can't handle asking her for food so soon after his feast.
Dean nods, a stray tear falling with the movement. He scrubs his face furiously, angry at the dampness.
So, it’s Thursday. It’s Thursday and for a while Cas and him have been meeting up on Thursdays because Cas is supposed to be “the Angel of Thursday” and it’s a big fuck-you to everyone upstairs to meet on
He glances at Cas sideways and asks trying to convey confidence, although even to his ears he sounds weak and unsure.
The cold air hits his face like a slap, punishing him for giving in to his urges. Otherwise, he also kind off finds it refreshing, less stuffed than the moldy room he was in, so it's easier to breathe.
Gabriel smirks, “Oh my, I didn’t know you missed me that much, sweet cheeks.” He sticks his tongue out and Dean recedes in disgust.
Cas nods slowly, as if something finally clicking together, and changes his demeanour, looking at Dean gentler and breathing more exaggeratedly.
When dawn came up on the fourth day and Dean stayed still besides the Captain, the Captain asked him to go to the ship after lunch.
Dean blinks a few times before the shock wears off and, even then, he still feels like he has somehow fallen asleep and is either in a really confusing dream or has woken up somehow in a completely different universe -which at this point wouldn't even surprise him.
As Dean resigns himself to not getting any answers, Cas hums again and closes his eyes as if to take a quick nap.
," Starts Sammy with a patronizing voice, "you woke me up with your drunk retching a few hours ago. I know you haven't slept and you're probably extremely hangover. Are you sure you're okay to drive?"
Cas advances towards him again. Dean's eyes focus on his lips, approaching him too fast and too slow at the same time. He closes his eyes, prepared for their lips to brush, when he feels them pushing against his cheek.
Dean shakes his head, fists tight against his sides. “Don’t you dare talk about my father. You don’t know
Cas chuckles and follows him down to where Jack’s seated. The castle’s already well-built by the time they get there, but that doesn’t stop them with having fun adding elements that castles most likely have never had.
They go somewhere in Atlanta, and while Sam investigates the details, Dean decides he should catch up with some sleep.
’s busy. Hunts of his own, loose ends, reminiscing of old time with worn-out angels that just want to fight him. So Dean isn’t mad at him. But he kind of is. Because it’s Thursday, it’s
The next morning Dean and the boat parted before dawn. He caught fish and let the manual labor run his thoughts. When he had come back to the Captain, he was still alright.
A hand clasps on his shoulder. Dean barely reacts to it, the warmth of the familiar palm steadying him in place more than he’s ready to admit he needs.
"You mean, the case you almost died and then drunk so much we had to leave late the next day?" Sam answers, irritated.
Cas doesn't push him. He does close the distance between them, though, trying to reassure him without words.
“And for that I apologize.” Cas continues. When Dean looks up at him, he looks so confused and reminds him so much of himself that Cas almost loses his train of thought. After momentarily smiling fondly to himself he carefully takes Dean’s chin with his forefinger, so he doesn’t stop gazing at the sincerity emanating from his expression.
Sometime along the way he finds himself over the toilet, fingers playing inside his mouth, over his tongue and onto his throat, bile and vanilla and chunks of whatever he's swallowed clogging the toilet and stinking up the bathroom, swallowing up all the clean air available in the crammed too.
Sam isn't done at the register when he passes by as they aren't the only ones leaving. When he sees Dean, he gestures him to go buy them some breakfast while he waits.
Dean leans forward and clutches Cas's forearm, creating a privacy bubble where he can whisper to Cas without being plagued with the fear of being heard by unwanted ears.
The longest it's ever stayed was seventeen days, sometime between Sam's loss to Lucifer's cage and his soulless return.
Cas goes to stand up, but Dean leaves his hand on Cas's knee again and Cas finds himself unable to leave.
"Just- Dean, it's quite obvious. I'm going to bed. I can't help you with this. I'm just really, really
Dean sighs. He’s so tired. He hasn’t been sleeping well- But, well. Since when does he allow himself the luxury of a peaceful night sleep? He rubs his face, then checks the clock. To be honest, he’s getting worried. What if something’s happened? Cas can defend himself. But what if he was taken by surprise? What if there was an unfair fight and Dean didn’t even try to help him?
. He's craving something so badly his hands are twitching and his mind's fallen into a loop of beer and meat and salty fries and soft vanilla milkshakes.
There are tear marks on his cheeks from the pressure he's out on his head, from the strain he's put on his body. These tears aren't emotional, they're due to effort.
Gabriel grins. As he makes a circle with his left fingers and enters it repeatedly with his right forefinger to illustrate his point, he corrects him. “Lewd, Cassie. The lewd version.”
Eleven years is a long time. Even if for Cas, who's lived millennials, it may barely seem like an afternoon does to a human being, he's been observing human behavior enough to know eleven years are a really big deal for humans.
They didn't talk much about their lives, each to their own. The past was the past, and as the prints in the sand at the coast, it was understood as something that had been washed away.
His minds tugs at him to recognize that that back can only belong to Cas, that he summoned him and hurt him, that
He's behind a glass wall that slows him and makes everything wrong with him quiet, whilst also forcing him to strain himself further to keep up with the world on the outside.
It comes out of nowhere and it stays as long as it desires, the pain leaving as suddenly as it comes. It makes him wonder if it really ever was there in the first place.
As he shoves it into his pocket, he looks around paranoically, but no one’s paying attention. He sighs, relieved. “Thanks, Cas,” he mumbles under his breath. He feels safer —stronger— already.
“You rather play ‘Pictionary’?” He adds, excitement sparking in his eyes. “We could play the dirty version.”
Jo doesn’t answer directly, but she bumps her head against his, which immediately flares up the pain already there, making him stifle a pained groan because it would be unwise to throw away his only advantage, the surprise of his own consciousness, by alerting them of his wakefulness.
Cas squints. “Dean. I know. John really did a number on you. I’m just saying there wouldn’t be anything wrong if you were attracted to men.”
questions what people mean if it's not related to a case or an apocalypse. Even then, it's usually Sam who wonders.
They had rested against the boat, and the Captain had caressed its wood with such gentleness Dean felt a pang of pain for different times.
And as he saw Cas's eyes; as he stared into the abismal ocean within it, he knew, with certainty, that what the Captain had tried so hard to convey the night they shared a piece of their pasts was true.
One moment he’s slumped on the chair, thinking long and hard, and the next Cas’s draped over Dean like the flag on Cas’s shoulders, hugging him and mumbling apologies and niceties into the space between his jaw and his shoulder.
His grip on the sheets below him tightens as he rolls onto his stomach, trying to hide from the offending sun light that blinds him even through his close eyelids.
Well, that's it if he absolutely ignores the time Cas was without grace, set aside by Dean in a regrettable set of circumstances.
“Do you want to go to Pride with me?” Cas asks calmly. Dean wonders at how effortlessly he says it, as if it’s not a big deal, as if it’s not
Sammy's rhythmic breathing annoys him like an unrelenting fly, because how is it fair that he gets to sleep when Dean's the one who's exhausted?
Cas's summoned and Jo's healed, but everything may not be as peachy after all. They've followed Jo there, but Jo was there for a reason that might just bite them in the ass.
The next day he took the boat in spread his ashes somewhere at sea, knowing the ocean would spread them around and take them in as if they were part of it. And they
Jack shakes his head, so, Sam just goes on his way. Dean smirks, trying to capture Cas's eyes to share some complicity. Cas keeps eating, though he does look up fondly when he thinks Dean isn't looking anymore. He is.
When Sam looks around boredly and announces he's leaving, "Dean, don't take anyone to our room. I really need to sleep. Go to her place" Dean lights up and smiles widely.
, and getting her the help she so desperately needs, his mind won’t stop swirling away from the task at hand.
"I've had such a... Best friend too," he said. Dean looked at him weirdly because of the tone of his voice. It seemed to imply something more. "I married her. Thirteen years before the fucker took her from me. Fucking cancer."
Baby run down, Dean hid her in a garage and compromised to help the Captain out. And so, he learned to fish beyond the basics his dad had taught him, and he learnt to sail, and to appreciate the wind and water and moon cycle, and to be as one with the sea as he was with the thrill of the hunt.
Lost in empty thought of exhaustion and cloaked hunger as he loses focus again, it takes him a few seconds too long to react when a mirage of Jo passes beside him carrying a metal dagger in her right hand. When he starts to follow her, she's already gone.
Dean wakes up, struggles a bit with food, gets in a little banter with Sam and travels with Sam for a case.
"Dean," he says. Neither of them are looking at each other. "I- What do you want me to say?" He asks, angrily and tiredly at the same time. It takes them both by surprise, their eyes looking for each other in shock.
It happens after dinner. As much time as they spend in the bunker now that cases are minimal, they don't see each other much with this and that and everyone having their own schedule. However, in insistence of some kind of semblance of a family, they always make time to have dinner together.
“Good morning to you too, Charlie.” Dean heads into the back kitchen to grab some new beans for the counter. Charlie follows him.
“Oh,” says Cas. Dean turns to look at him. Cas’s eyes are dark, inscrutable. “What exactly do you remember, Dean?”
He’s waiting for Dean, he knows. It’s sad and unfortunate and pathetic, but it’s the truth. He can’t leave, he can’t move on, but he can’t settle here either. He can’t dig roots into the earth here. He can’t furnish his apartment, can’t learn recipes or make friends or become a regular at the coffee shop around the corner from the laundromat where he washes the clothes that he won’t buy more of. He can’t own things. He can’t build any sense of permanence here, just in case.
“What would you say,” he starts, trailing his lips over Dean’s clavicle where the neck of his t-shirt sags away, the fabric stretched with age, “if I suggested that tonight, I...” he kisses his way up the column of Dean’s throat, feeling Dean’s breath hitch.
He feels the first tendrils of the burning in his chest start to spread through his chest. He imagines them as fingers, hot and glowing dull like embers, reaching through his sternum and around his lungs.
It’s that thought that pulls him straight over the edge, coming in streaks up Dean’s belly and chest.
Dean’s really looking forward to cracking that manhole open. He hopes the sewer people take him in kindly.
Taking it as a good sign, Cas parts his lips and slips the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth. He can feel Dean growing harder against his tongue, and he sucks against the flesh, closing his eyes and letting his lips slide down Dean’s length.
His face is pained, when he turns to look Castiel in the eyes. Cas wants nothing more than to swoop in and gather Dean in his arms, to whisper forgiveness into his skin. But he holds himself back.
A handful of days later, Castiel finds himself sitting in the half-dark in his apartment, his spine  resting against the unforgiving metal back of his kitchen chair. His hands itch. He’s come to realise that two of the worst human emotions — worse than pain and betrayal — is boredom and loneliness. The only person he talks to in town in Nora. If it weren’t for her, sometimes he thinks he may as well be a ghost.
There’s a new guy in the camp, with dark scruffy hair and a blue NASA tshirt that looks a bit worse for wear. Dean sees him lay a hand on El’s shoulder, and smile and something she says. He has a nice smile. Dean looks at him and thinks that his smile looks like warmth.
When he was still an angel, he’d seen this act performed hundreds of times—thousands even—as he watched over humanity. He’d never seen the appeal in it, never understood how it could bring so much pleasure to the person performing it, until he tried it for the first time. And now, with the weight of Dean’s cock against his tongue and the roof of his mouth, the salty-bitter taste of precome as it leaks against the back of his tongue, the way Dean moans and shifts against the sheets, kicking a knee out to spread his thighs: it all coalesces into something heady and artful, and Cas feels pleasure thrumming through his own veins as he sucks Dean down deeper.
Castiel feels very small standing there in the single room of his home, feels miniscule even in this tiny apartment. Dean fills the room, all of it, every last corner, with the brightness of his soul that Castiel still imagines he can see.
, he is in trouble. It’s him, Power Thighs, sweat starting to lightly stain the neckline of his navy t-shirt, swinging a water bottle from one hand, a small towel slung over his shoulder.
Cas pulls off with a pop. His hand resumes stroking behind Dean’s balls, before slipping back further to trace around the tight, hot skin at the core of him.
The smell of the alcohol is potent, stinging at his eyes. It reminds him of Dean, of the tang of it on Dean’s breath when he was drunk and angry, when he’d use cheap bourbon to dull his senses and close off the walls around his heart. Castiel knew, because Castiel could feel everything about Dean. Could. Not anymore.
The room spins when Dean opens his eyes; the familiar roll and pitch of too much whiskey. He squeezes his eyes shut against the nausea, rolling onto his side in an act of self-preservation. The surface below him is smooth leather. He cracks an eye: he’s sprawled over Baby’s back seat, fully dressed. His mouth feels furry and tastes like a hangover already.
When Dean’s car had pulled away from him that last time, it was like a single thread had been tied from the centre of his chest to the passenger seat, where he’d so desperately hoped he’d be sitting. And as Dean drove away, the Impala shrinking in the distance to a mere speck on the road, Castiel felt that thread pull, soft and first and then harder, yanking the weave of himself out into a sagging jumble at his feet.
, Dean thinks in horror. It looks engorged and pulsing, painful and gruesome like a blood clot. Cas grips it tight, his eyes flashing bright white. The thing in his hand squeals, whistles in pain like the sound of a kettle steaming in urgency. Then it is silent, still, smoking slightly, turning to ash that slides through Cas’s fingers and onto the floor.
Cas pulls his hand away, grabs the bottle of lube and slicks up his fingers. This time he slips inside easily, draws his finger out again, fucks it into Dean slowly and solidly.
Castiel watches as Dean looks around the apartment. Even though he spends every day and night here, it’s like he’s seeing it for the first time with Dean in the room. The Formica table with a single chair. The stained couch. The torn linoleum in the kitchen. The tragedy of a toaster oven. The single bowl and spoon in the drying rack. The great, unadorned wasteland of the walls, which he couldn’t bring himself to put up a single personal item—not a photo, not a picture, not a cheap dollar-store reprint of a Van Gogh, even.
Dean pulls in to the parking lot of a small strip mall near the centre of town, and heads into the inexplicably named Frisky Goat Café. Cas is already there, looking effortless and amazing in a blue chambray button-down and, wow, he’s also looking surprisingly shifty. But he smiles when he sees Dean, and he stands up and pulls out a chair for him before sitting down again.
Dean looks out at the water, the depth of it, the impossible infinity of it as it stretches out towards the horizon. He imagines the waves dragging him in, and runs his fingers through the sand next to him, letting the soft grains spill between his fingers, smooth as silk.
Dean stares at the back side of the car’s front bench seat, eyes tracking the smooth stitching in the upholstery. He’s not sure how he got here, or even when he is. He doesn’t remember drinking, that’s for sure.
He looks over to see Cas sitting rigidly in on of the kitchen chairs that’s been dragged in and set up next to the bed. He looks exhausted, head down, meditative.
The apartment he’s moved into barely qualifies as a shoebox. The tattered curtains ripple on the sigh of a breeze coming in through the third-storey window. The top of the table he’s sitting at is chipped Formica in an ugly salmon, and the metal-framed chair he’s perched on has a persistent wobble in the back left leg. His meagre collection of clothes sit unpacked still, one month on, as he cycles through six shirts and two pairs of pants over and over. His scalp itches from the cheap shampoo he’d picked up from the supermarket on Rexford’s main drag. It’s quiet. It’s so quiet he imagines he can hear the dust motes settling on the threadbare grey carpet. He doesn’t have a couch. Or a bed. His sleeping bag and pillow lie stretched in the corner of the single bedroom. The water-stained bathroom counter is a cracked brown plastic.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks. His voice is gravelly, and, speaking of, Dean’s pretty certain there’s a piece of gravel wedged into his knee from his fall. He looks down. Yep, ripped his jeans, and—oh, great, it’s starting to bleed. His palms sting, and he unfolds them and looks. Okay, great. So, there’s a cute guy, whatever, and Dean fell on his ass (well, knee) and is now bleeding from at least three places, and this really wasn’t the impression he wanted to give.
“Fuck, you’re so gorgeous,” he blurts out, stunned by the way Cas’s body looks in the yellow wash of the bedside lamp.
Dean shrugs, winds up the window and steps out of the car. He seems so big to Castiel, so real, from the tips of his hair to the scuffed soles of his boots. He’s so utterly, devastatingly present. Castiel wants to reach out and lay a hand on him. But he doesn’t.
“Oh!” Dean tries his very hardest to be nonchalant. “Oh, nothing. Really. Just, you know. Getting to know the neighbours.”
He reaches his hand down and swipes his fingers through the come pooling on Dean’s stomach. It’s tacky now, starting to cool as he rubs it between his thumb and fingers. He gathers more, and reaches his hand down between Dean’s legs, rubbing the pads of his fingers over Dean’s hole.
Dean comes back a few weeks later, on a perfect June afternoon, stopping by the Gas ‘n Sip and swaggering through the doors.
Dean lifts his hand off Castiel’s knee, and reaches up, forward, sliding his palm over Castiel’s shoulder instead. His grip is tight, desperate. He looks at Castiel, looks into him with loud eyes. His thumb brushes against Castiel’s collarbone, trembling minutely.
When their breakfast arrives, it is indeed smooshed avocado, but mixed with lemon juice and salt and pepper, and slathered onto thick slices of sourdough bread, topped with crumbled feta cheese and some sort of
Dean turns away from the sink, angling his body towards Castiel, his hand still damply pressing into Cas’s arm, turning the white of his shirt soapy and transparent. He leans forward, and the first brush of his lips against Castiel’s is soft, barely there.
“Sharks aren’t as dangerous as people think,” Cas says. “The life guards more commonly watch for currents and rips, and other dangers.”
“Yeah, yeah, I want it.” Dean spreads his knees further apart on the bed, making room for Cas to crawl between his thighs and push into him. But Cas waits.
“I’ve seen you, Dean. I’ve seen you staring at me in mirrors and across the gym. I’ve seen you do it, because I’m always staring at you.” Cas crawls onto the bed, up Dean’s body, dropping his head to kiss up Dean’s neck, wet and warm.
“I carried your heavy ass to the car,” Sam says, looking back down at the books. “Drove fast, called Cas to start looking. But Dean, we don’t really even know what we’re looking at here.”
Once the phone is unlocked, he thumbs open the app Nora had put on there for him. The black and yellow home screen opens, showing a grid of pictures under a ‘Who’s Nearby’ heading. Rexford isn’t a hive of activity exactly, so Nora has set his search to a one hundred mile radius. Even then, the selection is small. Their pictures are boring and predictable: a muscle car, a shirtless torso, a firm backside in a pair of white boxer briefs. Castiel scrolls through them, wondering what he’s supposed to feel. Interest? Arousal? Excitement? He closes his eyes and tips his head back, the front of his throat stretching as his face tilts towards the light. Behind his eyelids he sees green eyes, freckles, a soft mouth twisted in a moue of distaste as it said:
Dean hasn’t been this nervous about a date in for-fucking-ever. He’s changed his shirt at least three times, finally settling on a grey Henley that he instantly regrets the second he leaves the house, because he knows that any nervous pit-stains are gonna show right up.
Dean gasps, tries to nod. It’s like a ruby, a flame inside him, all sharp edges and pulsing burn. It pulses light to dark, swiftly, and Dean blinks against the ache. He blinks.
Dean nods, and stays quiet. Castiel wants to know what he’s thinking. His eyes dart between the small crease between Dean’s eyebrows, and Dean’s nimble fingers, which are peeling the label of his beer bottle and dropping the pieces in a small, shredded pile on the tabletop.
Dean moans again, reaches down to pinch at his own nipple. Cas lets him, watches the way Dean’s face twists.
Cas doesn’t know how to respond. It’s been weeks since he’d watched Dean drive away, and a sad part of him had expected that to be the last he’d ever see of him. The message is unexpected but not unwelcome. He feels colour rise in his cheeks as he replies.
Kissing Dean is a revelation. He’s spent years thinking about it, at first as a passing curiosity, and then, when he’d figured out how he felt, as a more active daydream, a well-worn fantasy. Nothing he’d imagined could compare, though, to the softness of Dean’s lips, the wet warmth of his mouth as he opens himself to Castiel, deepens the kiss. One of Dean’s hands slides up to cup the back of Castiel’s head, softly like it’s something precious. Castiel’s own hands are trembling at Dean’s waist, one hand grabbing a fistful of Dean’s flannel shirt and twisting it, using it to pull Dean closer.
attitude and propensity to mostly work on glamour muscles means that his biceps, triceps and deltoids are rockin’, while he’s still a little soft around the middle.
At the top of the cliff is a large split in the rock. Ocean waves crash with remarkable force down the channel created by the eroded rock. They stop at the top, looking down at the suddenly roiling sea, juxtaposed with the calmness of the surf down on the beach they’d just crossed.
They talk little during the meal. Castiel scrapes around in his mind for something to talk about, but comes up empty-handed. He doesn’t have anything to share — no adventures, no mishaps, no grand schemes to save the world. His life has become so small.
“Are you going to come like this?” he murmurs in Dean’s ear, running his fingertips over the hot skin of Dean’s erection.
He ignores the way the coffee tastes better--marginally, he assures himself--than anything he’s ever made in a coffee machine, even the good one in the bunker.
“I love you like this,” he says, running his hands up Dean’s thighs, dragging his nails on the way back down. Dean sighs deeply, runs his hands over his face. “You make me so
He stops for a moment. It takes him a minute to puzzle out the emoticon. Then he remembers. A pained half-laugh wrenches out of his throat. He supposes every human needs a birthday.
He pulls the sleeping bag up tighter around his shoulders. His back is starting to ache from sleeping on the shitty air mattress Nora had gifted him when he first moved in. A loan, he’d insisted, but he still hadn’t managed to buy a bed of his own yet.
It’s a Saturday afternoon, nothing overwhelming, not a big deal, just coffee. He and Cas had exchanged phone numbers, but beyond confirming the time and location for this afternoon, they haven’t really been in touch the last few days. Dean might have been so worked up that he skipped his Wednesday and Friday gym sessions so that he could have some time to get his head on straight. If Cas had noticed—
Cas does take him out again, this time for dinner the following Thursday. They go out for good steaks, and Dean doesn’t spill anything on himself, or drink too much, or make an ass of himself. He does make Cas laugh, though, and he loves it, loves that full, crinkly-eyed smile. The lighting is low, and he can feel Cas pressing their legs together under the table, and he’s not surprised, doesn’t freak out at all, when Cas fits his hand to the side of Dean’s neck, thumb tracing the stubble along his jaw, before leaning in and kissing him softly on the mouth. When they break apart, finally, he breathes in Cas’s shaky exhalation, and tips his head forward, bringing their foreheads together.
It turns cold in November. The heating in his apartment building leaves a lot to be desired. The window panes are frosted over in the early dawn light. He looks up at the tendrils of frost creeping over the glass, just visible through the sun-stained curtains in his bedroom. He’s still sleeping on a mattress on the floor. It’s been months, and he’s still living like any day now, Dean will appear and bring him home.
“And Crowley?” Cas asks, afraid of the answer, of the deal Dean might have made to get his brother back.
“You’re here,” he murmurs, pulling back for a second, before Dean’s other wet hand comes up to land, fluttering, against the side of Cas’s face, drawing him in again with a satisfied sigh.
Dean can see Sam take a shot, see the witch crumple, a deep red stain spreading across the front of her dress. From his prone position on the dusty warehouse floor, Dean watches Sam run towards him, concern contorting his face into something unholy.
Kissing Dean still feels like a revelation. He remembers the first time they kissed, a soft and tender flowing of relief between them. He kisses Dean now with the same gentleness, feeling Dean’s lips curving into a smile against his own.
A profile photo of a nearby user catches his eye. Strong, stubbled jaw. Plush lips quirked in a half-grin. It’s familiar, the twist of that mouth. He’d know Dean anywhere.
His eyes flicker down to Dean’s mouth, which, yeah, Dean’s not gonna pretend he hasn’t seen happening before. He can’t though, he just…It’s Cas, he can’t fuck it up, can’t fuck
He taps on the man’s profile. 20 miles away. Warm smile, dark hair. Brown eyes. Brown, brown, brown.
Manny starts to distribute the food to some of the other people in the camp. Dean doesn’t recognise all of them, but he waves hello to Sheila and Lou, two women who’ve been at the camp for the last month.
“And that’s all you remember?” Cas looks at him, and Dean can see concern in the crinkle of his brow.
Is this always what it’s like for humans? This terrifying free-falling? His breath catches in his throat, like his airways are constricting by the second, and any moment now he’ll cease to breathe.
“It’s quite a view, isn’t it?” Cas asks, stopping next to Dean. Dean thinks he sees Cas’s eyes linger on his face for a long second before turning back out to the horizon, but he can’t be sure.
“You’re my family, Dean. My friend.” He knows he’s being blunt, and the wince on Dean’s face is all the confirmation he needs that he should have just kept his mouth shut.
Dean sighs, his expression pinched. He sits against the arm of the sofa, which creaks under him. “I let an angel possess him,” he says.
“Oh yeah,” Dean continues. “Cursed objects, magical items, a library with books on books — Sam is in nerd loser heaven right now.”
The answer to his happiness, Nora seems to think, lies in finding someone to share his time with. After the first ill-fated time he’d thought she was interested in him, he’s relaxed around her. And after seeing him climb out of Dean’s car in the previous night’s clothes — as Nora had noted with a pointed smile and a whispered “good for you, Steve” — she has infinitely relaxed around him. When she suggests that he try a dating app to meet someone new, he recoils at the thought initially. But Nora is kind, and good, and probably right.
It makes Dean nervous, getting what he wants. Having Cas whole and here and unharmed. He licks his lips, shuffles closer to Cas across the mattress. Cas tightens his arm around Dean’s waist. Dean slots their legs together more tightly. He leans in, and Cas’s mouth is soft and warm and inviting. It’s a comfort, and Dean feels a flood of relief at the absence of heat in his chest. He feels warm, but it’s different; it’s softer and rounder and a good thing. Cas’s hand slides up to gently cup the back of his head. He can do this.
They’ve been driving for hours, north across Kansas and into South Dakota, hunting some witch who’d gotten too big for her boots with some pretty heinous blood magic, wreaking havoc in Rapid City. Dean has a crick in his neck, and a light throb in his lower back that reminds him he’s getting too old to drive eight hours at a stretch. But he’s wired on rest-stop coffee and the adrenalin of a hunt, and he and Sam had decided to tear in to the warehouse anyway.
Dean looks wrecked already, his lips red and wet, colour breaking out across his cheeks. His breath is coming fast, just from this, just from the anticipation. Cas considers him for a moment.
“Okay, okay,” Dean mutters, tipping his head to catch Cas’s lips with his own. Cas kisses him, wet and hungrily, until he hears the whisk Dean had been holding clatter to the floor at their feet, Dean’s hands coming up to grip Cas’s shoulders.
Cas brings his hand up to grip Dean’s jaw, applying the slightest pressure to open Dean’s mouth wider. He licks between Dean’s teeth, feels Dean shiver as their tongues meet. He nudges their kiss towards something deeper, wetter, catching Dean’s lower lip between his teeth. Dean moans beneath him, shifting restlessly on the mattress. Cas’s cock throbs between his legs, still hard. He can ignore it for now; this is for Dean, to see how far Dean can go.
Is Castiel happy? He sometimes sits with the muted nothingness that churns softly in the centre of his chest, as he passes hours in the half-dark of his apartment. He doesn’t hurt anymore, not unless he really thinks hard about Dean and digs his fingers into that singular bruise. But he doesn’t...
He picks up the bottle and tips it into his mouth. Whiskey floods his tongue, sharp and acrid and wholly unpleasant. He coughs, swallows, coughs again. It tastes different this time, as a human.
Dean takes a deep breath, looks up and meets Cas’s eyes, which is hard considering Cas seems to be having a hard time looking at Dean directly.
He recognises that he’s probably depressed. But the depth of human feelings — the sheer pain that comes with knowing that right beneath your feet lies a cavernous nothingness, while everything you’ve ever wanted lies just outside the grasp of your fallible hands — is new to him, so maybe this is just the way everyone feels.
It feels better to have it out there, like ripping off a band-aid. And now Cas can realise that Dean has no chill, maybe has never had chill, and they can move on and just go back to seeing each other at the gym. Or maybe Dean will switch gyms, and then he can pretend he was never this overtly uncool.
Cas rolls his eyes. “No, Dean. We’re just two people that are having coffee and are interested in each other. Nothing hell-bound there.”
Dean thinks about rolling his eyes and making a scene, but for once in his life he lets himself relax. Just for a moment. After all, it’s safe here, and they’re alone. He slips out of his own outer layers, leaving on his boxer briefs. It’s hot, and the sun is high in the sky. He’s going to burn if he’s out there for too long, so at least he figures he has an excuse if he doesn’t like it in the water.
“Because I’ve been checking you out since day one,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. Cas has turned a delightful pink in two high spots on his cheeks. “And you’re basically the hottest guy I’ve ever seen, and you asked me out and now I’m worried I’m gonna be an asshole and scare you off.”
“Bagels, cream cheese, chicken salad, and raspberry muffins,” he says, counting them off as he passes them to Manny.
is laying open across his chest, and there’s a tepid cup of coffee resting on the bedside table near his head.
Cas smiles, nods. Dean gets behind the espresso machine and prays that he doesn’t set it on fire or anything else impossible but unlucky and therefore probable.
“I’ve been reading, but blood magic is old, and complicated, and almost limitless. We don’t know what hit you, and we don’t know if it’s even still affecting you.”
If he’d thought that the view couldn’t get better than the pristine calm of Sunshine Beach yesterday, Dean is man enough to admit that he was wrong. After grumbling his way up a couple of hundred steps carved into the steep rock of the headland, he stops to catch his breath at the top and looks back down the beach, stretching white and wide for miles down towards the south. The sky is pure and blue and open above them, with the endless ocean laid out below, glittering in the sunlight that’s burning the skin on the back of his neck. It’s hot, even though it’s early. He feels a trickle of sweat slip between his shoulder blades and soak into his shirt at the small of his back.
He considers. He wants to believe Dean. He wants to cling onto that hope like a drowning man clutching onto driftwood at sea.
Dinner, it turns out, is mountains of giant shrimp (“king prawns”, the menu says), potato salad and pale ale at a small restaurant overlooking the water. It’s casual and friendly and unhurried, and Dean feels himself relax further into the wicker chair as the evening carries on.
Castiel hums. He can picture it: the bunker’s warm light, the gentle hum of the generators, the arch of the ceilings, and Sam hunched over a book in the library learning everything his delightful brain can absorb. It’s a wonderful image.
Dean sits heavily on the side of the bed again. He doesn’t know how he got here. He doesn’t know why he left, but he has a pretty good idea. He stares down at his phone, the message box with its unread notifications. Messages from Cas.
Castiel smiles to himself. He likes to think of Dean in the bunker’s kitchen, moving comfortably around the space, making food for himself and Sam, caring for his family. His mind glosses over the empty seat at their table that he’d hoped would be his.
Dean sighs, relief flooding his face. His hands tighten on Castiel’s shoulders, thumbs pressing into trapezoids. With a gentle pressure from his fingers, Dean pulls Castiel forward, just slightly, until they’re hovering even closer into each other’s orbit.
They kiss for some time, there in the kitchen of the home that Dean built, the home Cas didn’t think he’d come back to. They’re not frantic, not hurried, but something lush and deep, something they’ve been waiting for. Dean’s mouth is warm and wet, and the slide of Dean’s tongue is making heat pool low in Cas’s groin.
Dean likes to pretend that he doesn’t need to work out, that exercising is terrible and only something his awful health-freak of a little brother would do. But he will concede to lifting weights three times a week, as he argues that he can spend some of that time sitting down, and definitely none of it running or, heaven forbid, doing
The burning in his chest gets worse, deeper as he pulls the door shut behind him, heading out to the Impala. He can feel it in his arms now, starting to make his fingertips twitch. It’s too hot, too much. He jams the key in the ignition, pulls Baby out of the lot with a screech of tires. He heads back the way he assumes he came, back home.
Dean’s face feels hot. He turns in his chair, swallows against the heat in his throat, reaches out softly to grab Cas’s shirt. He fights the urge to bury his face in the fabric. Cas’s other hand reaches down, fingers pressing under Dean’s chin, forcing his face up to meet his eyes. Dean doesn’t like the sadness he sees there.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel says, because he doesn’t. He hates not understanding, not being able to grasp a concept in an instant, intuit feelings and realities with a tilt of his head.
Dean smiles. This he can talk about, easy. “That’s Sammy, my giant baby bro. First customer we ever served here, so there’s the photo commemorating it.”
In the dark, he replays the moment he walked into the diner and saw Dean sitting in a booth by the back wall, the green canvas of his jacket like familiar foliage, the softness of his eyes drawing him over to the table. His senses have been dulled by mortality, but he knows that if he’d breathed in deeply enough through his nose he could have smelled it, as soon as he walked through the door: leather seats, salt, that particular mix of sweat and deodorant that means
“Gone, for now,” Dean says. He runs his fingers over the top of the metal kitchen chair, stopping to rub his thumb over a knot where the metal’s been welded into place.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean whispers, before Cas has even asked, eager to agree to anything Cas wants to give him.
Right now, for example, the guy is on his second set on the hack squat, ten reps in, not that Dean is counting. He must have close to three hundred pounds stacked on, and his thighs are just
When they get back to the cottage, it’s after dark and the crickets are chirping loudly in the trees outside. Dean wends his way to the bedroom and flops down onto the crisp white sheets with a sigh, all loose-limbed and easy from the beer and the sun. Then he feels the mattress dip beside him, and he whips his head up to see Cas stretching out on the bed next to him.
“Uh, sure. Yeah. Thanks, man.” He’s really trying to save some face here, voice coming out rough and masculine in an attempted recovery.
“No, of course I want that,” Dean scoffs. “We all want that—present company excluded,” he adds at the disgusted twist to Charlie’s mouth. “But not like that. I don’t want a hook-up app, Charlie. I don’t even really think I want a hook-up.”
He kisses back. Of course he kisses back. He reaches and rests his hand on the small of Dean’s back, pulling gently, the softest pressure, pulling Dean to him. He opens his mouth, feels Dean do the same, feels the slide and softness of Dean’s tongue against his own.
Cas smiles, reaches over the table and lays his hand over Dean’s. Dean immediately wants to turn his hand over and lace their fingers together. Cas’s hand is big and warm and solid.
“I’ll go sleep on the couch,” he says, face red. He grabs a pillow and stalks out to the lounge room, ignoring the soft way that Cas says his name as he goes. He sleeps fitfully under the breeze of the ceiling fan.
“Gonna come, Cas, gonna—” Dean warns him. Cas doesn’t stop. He lowers his head to Dean’s chest, taking one of Dean’s nipples between his lips. Dean gasps as Cas sucks on the tender flesh, bites down with a scrape of his teeth. He feels Dean’s back try to bow beneath him as Dean’s dick jumps in his hand, growing incrementally harder in the last second before Dean’s coming with a soft groan.
In heaven, Castiel was a masterful tactician, inspired in his planning and ruthless in execution. Cas, as a human, is delighted to find he still possessed those innate skills—even if he applies them in slightly different ways these days.
Castiel swallows. He knows the power it can take to cast out an angel who doesn't want to leave. “How?” he asks.
“Nah, ‘sall good. I got it,” he replies, balancing two armloads of food and trying to navigate his way to the front door. Charlie sighs at his stubbornness and runs over to open the door for him. She waves him through with a little bow.
up like that. He tries so hard not to lean in. He blinks against the warmth he sees in Cas’s eyes. He blinks.
It’s not enough like this, he knows. Dean sighs above him, blissed out and content as Cas slowly slides a second finger in, lowering his head to drop wet, open-mouthed kisses along Dean’s hips.
Manny nods. “Yeah, Cas is cool. He should be back soon, I think he said he’d drop by again tomorrow.”
“And if you’re going to have the option, well. Always go for pie,” he continues. “Even if there probably aren’t enough candles in the world to hit your actual age.”
He remembers sleeping in the back room at the Gas ‘n Sip, and, before that, he remembers the homeless shelters, and, before that, he remembers the bite of the wind and the cold of the rain as he’d been alone in the elements.
Dean is mostly just red-faced, embarrassed as fuck, and concerned about the bruising he’s going to have across his upper thighs.
Lying in the dark with Dean wrapped warm around him, Castiel feels his future laying itself in an open path in front of him. They’ll leave for Lebanon in the morning. He is, for the first time in a long time — or maybe even just for the first time — happy.
, fingers shifting down and through and into Dean’s chest cavity. Dean can feel his fingers groping, gripping.
He pulls out of Dean gently, rolling Dean over onto his back again. He leans over Dean, kissing his forehead, his eyelids, his cheeks. He can see Dean’s heart beating steadily in his chest. Dean’s eyes are closed tight, his hand curved around Cas’s arm.
He cracks. Of course he does. “Man,” he says, reaching a hand up and rubbing the back of his neck, before remembering his grey-shirt-sweat-stain situation and lowering his arm again. “I don’t know what’s gotten into me. I think you intimidate the shit out of me.”
He hears Dean groan and drop his head back to the pillow. Cas leans back in with his mouth, kissing the tender flesh of Dean’s hole, licking gently, then more with more surety as Dean sighs above him. He tastes his own spend, bitter and earthy on his tongue as he stiffens the muscle and pushes it in, just a little, into Dean’s rim. Dean’s moaning in earnest now, nonsense words and sounds slipping from his mouth as Cas seals his lips around Dean’s hole and
Cas groans, feeling Dean tighten around his cock. A few short thrusts is all it takes before the dam breaks, and he’s coming in wild spurts inside Dean.
He pictures it, Dean strung out and trembling, overwhelmed and begging. They’ve been doing this for months now, taking each other apart with heated touches and long-ignored desire. He loves bringing Dean pleasure, driving him wild with it, pulling him down over the edge. Warmth begins to eddy in his gut at the thought of it, of seeing how far he can push it.
He has no proof that it even is Dean, of course. Just the car, the familiar smile. The fact that it’s a gay dating app in itself isn’t surprising — he knows Dean, has seen the parts of him that he tries to keep hidden. Castiel has pieced him back together, shred by shred. He knows the very core of him.
“You could take it all, couldn’t you?” he murmurs, sliding his fingers out and then in again, slipping brutally over Dean’s prostate.
Dean blanches. He really, really doesn’t want to be trapped here with Cas. Stuck in a single room with nowhere to go, nothing to do but stoically ignore certain
It’s still early in the afternoon, so they leave their heavy, weather-inappropriate clothes in the cottage and head back towards the beach. At the end of a wooden walkway, the sand spreads out in a warm, white blanket. The ocean, up close, is turquoise and clear, the waves playful and non-threatening. The beach is busy, with families and couples and all sorts of people ducking in and out of the water between a set of red and yellow flags.
Dean doesn't message again that night, even though Castiel lies awake in the dark, waiting for the buzz and the chime from his phone that will doesn't come.
“You look a bit shell-shocked,” says Cas. “Look, I know that maybe a man of God is not at the top of a lot of peoples’ lists of ideal partners. But, I like you. I’d like to get to know you better. If you’d be amenable.”
And just like that, it opens: the box that he’d pushed shut, then sat on, then jumped on until it closed firmly, then hammered secure with nails of repression and lack of self-worth, then chained fast and dropped into a bottomless ocean hoping to never see it again.
“Jesus, fuck!” Dean exclaims, stopping in his tracks as a naked old man steps proudly down the sand.
Castiel doesn't know what to do with this message. He doesn't know how to tamp down the great well of sadness that's bursting forth within him. Dean's drunk, he's not thinking clearly, he doesn't want...He can't want...
Cas strokes a hand down the length of Dean’s spine, and the heat abates a little. It’s still there, though. Constant, like a dull throb.
“Please come home, Cas,” Dean says, his voice soft. “I need you. I can’t take it anymore. Please, please come home.”
Cas sighs, leans forward to brace his arm on the table, swaying into Dean’s space. He’s smiling faintly. “Dean, I’ve seen you fall over and drop weights and slip on your own sweat on the gym floor. And I’ve still always been incredibly attracted to you. It took me weeks to get the nerve to ask you if I could spot you. If anything, you intimidate me.”
He hears more from Dean over the next couple of weeks, like some small crack has appeared in the dam and a faint trickle of water is making its way down to quench parched earth.
“I –“ Dean starts. Castiel feels his fingers flex in the muscles of his arm. “You’re here,” Dean finishes.
“We should go somewhere less likely to end in injury,” Dean murmurs, pulling away just an inch, his forehead resting against Castiel’s.
The next morning, they sleep late. When they wake up, the sun is well into the sky, so they head out to one of the small cafés on the main street. Dean stares at the coffee menu, confused.
He’s lonely. He’d felt loneliness before, when he’d been called away to heaven, or, worst, when he’d been forced to keep secrets from Dean. But he’d always had a greater purpose then, he’d always been chasing something, planning something, twisting the fabric of the world to make something important happen.
Cas’s hand releases his chin, fingertips trailing up to brush lightly across Dean’s hairline. “We’ll figure it out,” he says.
It creeps up on him this time, ushered into existence with Cas’s gentle hands, and Dean’s whole body arches, his back bowing, his feet kicking into the mattress, his hands grasping at Cas’s shoulders, his back, gripping him and pulling him up and into a deep kiss. Dean sobs against his mouth, and Cas kisses him through it as Dean curls into himself, coming hard and dry, his orgasm pulsing through him like a sudden wave.
“I couldn’t. Sam needed his power to stay alive. If I told you what had happened, Gadreel would have left, and Sam would have
Dean’s cheeks flush pink, and he drops his eyes. “God, you’re really outdoing my declaration here, Cas,” he says, although his voice is warm.
He wakes with a start. He’s back in the bunker, resting his head against the soft back of a an armchair in the library that’s been pulled up against the heavy table. Books are sprawled open on the table’s surface; spell books, lore collections. Cas is sitting across the table, looking rumpled. His face looks soft with concern and concentration. Dean takes in the disarray of his hair, the casual roll of his sleeves. Again, the suit jacket is nowhere to be seen.
It’s getting quiet, late in the afternoon, so Dean starts removing leftover bagels and muffins from the display cabinet to take over the road.
“Now, I imagine, we’ve got a lot to learn about one another,” Cas says, squeezing back. “If you can be patient with me.”
“Two, when I was younger, if I was lucky.” Dean shrugs. “I’m over forty now, dude. I don’t like your chances.”
Dean looks over at where Cas is seated in a leather-backed chair, shirt sleeves rolled up, tie abandoned. He looks tired, even though he’s back to not sleeping again. He looks like he’s been reading all night. Cas is staring at Dean with concern and appraisal. His eyes are sad when he speaks.
He heads back into the café. Charlie is stacking cups, ready for the morning rush. He peers out the window and looks over at the tent city over the road. He can see a few people he knows over there: Manny, the sort of camp leader, is talking to El and Leigh, a couple of younger rough sleepers who barely look old enough to be out of high school. Dean makes a mental note to head over with some more food this afternoon.
“Stay here,” he commands, and Dean moans, pushing up just to feel Cas lean into him and hold him back down.
Cas kisses Dean’s shoulder, wraps him tighter in his arms. Dean will probably wake up again soon, sticky and uncomfortable and feeling gross enough to prod Cas awake, demanding that he find them a towel, or just drag him into the shower.
. And now, when it’s here, when Cas is here, warm and solid and real, with hands that have gripped and held, he still doesn’t have it. Now that Dean knows what Cas’s mouth tastes like, knows how the rush of air from Cas’s sighs feel against his skin…and he
At this point he is actually backing away from Cas, even though his knee is starting to scream with every awkward shuffle.
Cas smiles wide, and then promptly removes his shorts, standing in his underwear. Dean’s brain full-on short-circuits.
He feels his erection spring out from under the fabric of his boxers as Cas pulls them down his legs. He kicks them off his feet and loses them somewhere among the sheets.
, Dean realises, and he can let himself have it. It’s not often that he can relax like this, not ready to jump at the next shadow to shift in the corner of his eye, not waiting to fend off the next apocalypse. There’s just this: the water, the sand, the sun, and Cas.
Dean laughs, running his palms over his face. “Oh, boy. Oh, brother. Well, there’s not really a good way out of this, is there? Now I’m on a date with a priest. Amazing.”
He doesn’t get into the Impala. Some part of him can’t stomach the thought of sliding back onto the smooth leather of the seats. Not when he’ll have to just get out again. Not unless he’s going home.
From there, it doesn’t take long for Dean to acknowledge feelings he’s left unspoken for far too long, to say it out loud for the first time. Cas is cautious at first, aware of the hole he’d blown in his cool façade when he’d been taken by the Empty in the first place. Confessions like that don’t come easily, not for the Winchesters, and not for Cas either, who’d learned a particular type of reticence from Dean, a need to hold back what he’d wanted to say.
He’s not sure what Dean’s motivation for that would be: assuaging his own guilt, maybe, at not letting Castiel stay at the bunker. Or maybe he’d do it to try and buoy Castiel’s spirits, as the bags under his eyes don’t exactly fill anyone with confidence that he’s happy and well-adjusted. Or maybe he’d say it just to be polite, or because he’s proud that Castiel has come this far alone and hadn’t just immediately ended up dead in a ditch like they’d all feared he would.
That hot guy, though, is definitely no slouch. Dean sees him there once or twice a week when their schedules overlap, and the guy’s always sweating but working effortlessly, busting out set after set of pull-ups, chest presses, deadlifts. He makes Dean feel like a bit of a lump. And definitely self-conscious about how red his face gets when he pulls through a heavy lift.
But Cas is there. Cas is leaning over him, chanting in what sounds like Enochian. Dean feels the heat in his chest spasm, flash. Cas keeps muttering, sleeves rolled up, reaching one hand over Dean’s chest, and then Dean cries out as Cas pushes his hand
“Really,” Cas says, solemnly. “I did actually want to show you Hell’s Gates. There’s a beautiful walk just along the headland here.”
“Yeah,” Dean huffs a laugh. “I mean, not right now. But…god, you just make me feel…” He trails off. “It’s never been so intense as it is with you.”
The loneliness he’s been feeling has become like a warm bath. It’s comforting, it’s contained, it’s familiar. He knows where its edges lie. He can sink down into it and just be there, steeped in it, safe within it.
“There’s more to the human experience than living in a backwoods town like this, you know,” Dean says.
“This is Tea Tree Bay,” Cas says, dropping his bag on a fallen tree trunk set back from the water’s edge. It’s so quiet here; the bay is sheltered from the breeze and the surf. The water is impossibly still and clear ahead of them, and the sand is white and clean beneath their feet. There’s no one else in sight.
But Dean surprises him, after all. He takes Cas by the hand one evening in the kitchen, not long after his return to the bunker, and holds tight to his fingers and says: “Me too, by the way.”
He looks up and catches hot guy’s eyes in the mirror over the room. Hot guy raises an eyebrow. Dean is so fucking busted.
But he does wait. He sits in the Impala in the parking lot, fiddling with his phone and drumming his hands on the steering wheel in time to the radio. Castiel watches him while he pretends to clean the windows by the sunglasses display.
Cas does not, to Charlie’s disappointment, choose the floral loveseat, but instead slides into one of two worn green armchairs around a small coffee table.
“Do I what?” he manages, realising that he’s staring probably a little too long at the fine sheen of sweat on Power Thighs’s throat.
Cas grins and leans up and kisses Dean, fucking his tongue into his mouth in slow, lazy thrusts. It’s graceless and dirty, but he can feel heat start to pool low in his belly again as Dean moans into his mouth.
It takes longer than it usually would—more often than not, Dean is easy for him, follows the path of pleasure that Cas lays before him with sure steps. But tonight he’s already come once, and the next orgasm is harder won.
Dean shrugs, but he’s worried. His chest hurts, he swears he can feel the edges of a burn in the back of his oesophagus. Heartburn, maybe.
“Cas,” Dean says in a sigh, reaching and and pulling Castiel to him. He feels Dean’s arms circle firmly around his back, feels Dean’s fists pressing between his shoulder blades. He raises his own arms and awkwardly hugs Dean in return before pulling back.
Dean huffs angrily, standing up and pacing to over to the table where Castiel stands, his hands clenched into fists. “I’ve always wanted you to stay. Like I said, I don’t care what you are. You’re
“That’s it, that’s it, beautiful,” Cas murmurs, stroking his hands over Dean’s belly, his chest, his biceps, his waist. “So beautiful, Dean, so beautiful.”
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean smiles. “You just—I—come here.” He sits up, pushes at Cas’s shoulder, follows, leaning over him and grinning. “Don’t want it to, you know. Finish.”
Castiel breathes out, a shaky exhale from the very foundation of his lungs. He hadn’t realised he’d been holding his breath.
It goes like this for a few weeks. They nod in acknowledgement in the locker room, trade pleasantries, spot one another on the chest press and barbell squat. They don’t trade numbers, they don’t exchange much more than names and mild inoffensive conversation about gains and reality TV.
Dean doesn’t really know what to say. Thankfully, Baby is parked on the verge nearby, snow already melting off her and sliding onto the sandy gravel in chunks, so he doesn’t have to get mad at Cas for leaving her behind. But still, t his wasn’t what he expected, precisely. “Uhhh, why?”
He hears hurried footsteps and then there’s a strong hand gripping around his arm, helping to haul him to his feet. Dean looks up into blue eyes that are kinda squinty with concern, and wants a hole to open up in the earth and swallow him. There’s a manhole in the middle of the road about thirty yards away, he recalls. Maybe he can just walk up there, pry it open, and pitch himself into the sewer.
Dean pushes up onto one elbow, looks down at Cas lying back among the pillows. He recognises now that they’re in Cas’s room. The clock says 11.32 – he’s not sure if it’s night or morning.
He looks up at Cas, who’s six feet of tanned skin and bright smile standing over him, hair streaming wet, body firm and toned like every fantasy Dean’s ever repressed in his miserable life.
Dean tries very hard to fight the urge to crush his phone into a tiny brick. “Yeah, yeah, Sammy. I’m
“Soon,” he says again. He twists his fingers, seeking out Dean’s prostate like a homing device, pressing firmly over and over. Dean keens, his cock starting to grow hard again. He tries to curl onto his side, needing to do something, anything, in the face of overstimulation. Cas brings his free hand up to Dean’s hip and pulls him flat against the mattress again, pinning him in place.
Dean thinks back. “Bunker library. We were looking for some intel on whatever curse that witch threw at me.” He looks around the room, confused. “Why the fuck are we in Wyoming?”
Dean breathes in, a deep, shuddering breath to the very bottom of his lungs. He lets it out in a rush.
“Of course. Let me just clean us up.” He starts to withdraw his limbs, meaning to roll out of bed in search of a hand towel, but Dean grips his wrist with a strong hand.
He wants to laugh, dry and aching. As if he’s been doing anything other than waiting, all this time. Castiel calls Nora and, for the first time since he moved here, excuses himself from work. And then he waits.
The weight of it all lifts off Dean’s shoulders in an instant, and he immediately rolls his eyes. “I never should have let you watch those movies.”
Except speaking of wobbly steps, Dean seems to somehow forget that there is a step from the front of the café down onto the street, and he trips, arms pinwheeling in a way that he really hopes isn’t as uncoordinated as it feels, and falls hard on his knee, palms scraping the sidewalk.
that just makes him want to let go, to shrug it all away and just see what happens when he doesn’t have a constant death grip on the fraying edges of his life.
He jolts at the sound of Cas’s voice, looking over to where he’s leaning against the bed head, feet bare and legs crossed at the ankle. He’s got an old-looking book cracked open in his lap; two more are stacked on the bedside table.
He opens it without hesitation. There on the other side, his eyes wild and breath coming hard despite the short climb, stands Dean.
“In your case, you’d probably offer to show them your delicately located Princess Leia tattoo and just let things run their natural course from there.”
“I don’t want to not kiss you,” Dean barely whispers. He tilts his face forwards again, kissing Cas softly on the mouth.
Cas looks down at Dean’s hand, down at Dean’s face, blue eyes searching. He closes the book softly. Reaches down and covers Dean’s hand with his own.
. His fingertips ghost over the keyboard on the screen, imagining writing it, sending it. Why not? he thinks. Why shouldn’t he just say it? It’s not going to change anything between them. It won’t bring Dean magically to his side, across that vast distance that they’ve let grow between them. But the words would be there, a life raft in the empty sea. Something he could cling onto in the rolling dark.
“Hey,” he says, reaching for Cas’s leg, resting his hand against Cas’s thigh. “Hey, are you okay here?”
Cas reaches over him, grabs him by the side and tugs him in until they’re chest-to-chest, although Dean is very aware of the sticky mess between them.
And Dean does, with a strangled shout that’s ripped from his throat. His whole body tenses, each muscle screaming as his orgasm courses through him for the third time that night.
He comes to on the kitchen table in the bunker, and everything hurts. He’s pretty sure that’s his blood he can see dripping onto the floor. He can’t move his left leg, and a panicked glance down shows him ripped jeans and what looks horribly like a bone shoved through the skin of his shin.
“Get the comfy couch,” Charlie hisses. Dean knows that she’s referring to the floral loveseat at the back of the café that has a busted spring, so the seats sink in towards the middle and when two people are sitting on it, they end up inevitably squished together. Dean kicks her swiftly on the ankle. She glares at him.
Dean runs the conversation back in his head, cringing at the most awkward parts. Oh shit, it’s almost definitely a date.
They stay up late into the night, squashed together on Castiel’s air mattress, blissfully, finally naked. Castiel can’t stop running his hands over Dean’s perfect skin, tracing freckles with his fingertips, running his thumbs over the softness of Dean’s stomach and the firm curve of his buttocks. Dean rests his head on Castiel’s chest, one arm slung low around Castiel’s waist.
Sam nodded, as though he hadn’t expected any less, and Dean was practically overflowing with pride. He didn’t miss how Sam sought out Castiel’s gaze though, their gazes locking together for a long moment before Sam nodded, letting out a pent-up sigh of relief. Sam relaxed into Dean’s hold and slammed his book shut, pushing it away.
“Uhm,” he stammered, glancing between the phone and the woman. “Define ‘okay’? Are you my Sam? What the
Hoping for the best, Dean crept up to the doorway and knocked as hard as he could. If this really was 2020, then was Bobby even here anymore? By the looks of the place, he doubted it.
“S’okay,” Dean mumbled into his shoulder, avoiding eye contact. “Wasn’t your fault.” Mary winced at that; he had no idea how much of it actually
“Sure, honey. Is a diner okay?” She didn’t wait for an answer, and Dean didn’t give her one. She was already pulling off the highway and looking up and down the main street for a suitable place. She found one after a few minutes and parked, then started rooting around in her glovebox. She found a pack of wet wipes and handed a few into the back seat so everyone could clean the blood and grime from their faces, hands, and clothes in order to look presentable enough for society.
After about ten minutes, their waitress appeared again, setting a plastic bag full of Styrofoam packages in front of them with a smile. Castiel took the bag gratefully, wrapping a hand around Dean’s shoulder to tug him along after him.
,” he whispered, tearing the room apart until he found a flashlight, flipping it on and waving it around frantically. There was red paint all over the floor, covering it in strange symbols. It looked like there had been some kind of fight there, with holes in the walls and things knocked over onto the floor. Shoving his worry away, Dean kept moving, praying that he might find Bobby or his brother hidden away somewhere safe. Something must have happened while he was away; there was no way Bobby would have done a ritual like that with Sam in the house.
Dean had screamed into a pillow for a few minutes, trying to vent his frustrations, but it hadn’t helped much. His insides were squirming uncomfortably, and it felt like a million ants were marching beneath his skin, and he was having trouble focusing. This whole jump into the future was freaking him out, more than he had realized.
Dean gave Claire a long-suffering look, raising his brows at her. “Sorry if you forgot, but I got no clue who the hell that guy is. Who’s Cas?” His face screwed up in confusion, looking back at the picture. “Kind of a weird name for a dude, right?”
He stared at the back of her head as they walked. He was still having trouble finding the mother that had kissed his skinned knees and read him bedtime stories in the hunter he had seen decapitating vampires with blood splattered across her face.
Dean shook his head, a little life returning to his eyes now that he could talk shop, instead of feelings. Cas rolled his eyes at how predictable he could be sometimes, how easily manipulated. It had gotten him into trouble more than once. “Didn’t even know vamps were a
There was a long, tense silence, followed by the sound of banging and things moving around on the other end, before Rowena finally answered. “Why is it every time you call me, it’s because something’s gone wrong?” she asked, sounding angry and put-out. “
Dean’s eyes dropped first, squirming uncomfortably beneath her gaze. He could stare down the anger in his father’s eyes without blinking, but as soon as someone looked at him with disappointment, he was a cowering, blubbering mess.
“Shut up, you and Eileen are worse.” Sam flicked Dean in the forehead in retaliation and Dean reared back, still grinning wide like he had won some great argument.
“Oh, come on,” Dean groaned. “I’m no newbie! I may not have ever gone up against vampires, but I know how to fight. I don’t need a babysitter.” He turned to Cas with wide eyes, holding his hands up in defense as he tried to backpedal. “No offense, buddy, but seriously. I’ll be fine.”
There was a long silence, and then another, lower voice, much different than Sam’s, said, “No. It went to voicemail.” Dean didn’t know what that meant, but something was buzzing in one of his pockets. He pulled out a similar device to Jody’s, showing it to her as a little notification lit up the screen.
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean crowed, moving up behind his brother and pinning him into a headlock, ruffling his long hair playfully. Though Sam could have easily broken his hold, he let Dean mess with him until his big brother was throwing around a real smile, too.
He heard Jody opening the front door and sat up a little, peeking over the back of the couch until he could see what was going on. Jody, standing there in her pajamas and wrapped up in robe, was letting in two men. The same two men from Claire’s pictures, earlier. They were trying to be quiet for Dean’s sake, he was sure, as they whispered with Jody in the foyer. Sure, he was awake, but he wasn’t sure he was actually ready for any of this. He hunkered back down on the couch, rolling over until his face was smushed against the back of the couch, and tried to even out his breathing. If they thought he was still asleep, maybe they would leave him alone for a few more minutes, while he tried to work up the courage to interact with his brother.
He loved these moments, but nights were long in the bunker, and they could get boring without anyone to interact with. He had taken to falling into a sort of meditative mindset, letting his mind wander through his memories, his thoughts, his fantasies of the future. He let his hand continue moving through Dean’s hair, scratching at his scalp, enjoying the happy little sighs he released at the feeling.
“This is my cell phone. Everybody’s got one now and they’ve gotten a lot better, a lot faster. Kind of like a little computer you can carry around with you.” He turned the phone so John could see what he had pulled up. There was a picture there, of an old, leatherbound book. He couldn’t make out the title, but it looked ancient, probably rare, and he wasn’t sure where the hell the boys thought they were going to find it.
Dean ripped his eyes away from the smoking bowl to blink up at the witch in disbelief, before loudly growling, “
Crossing his arms, John leveled Sam with his most unimpressed look and waited. When all Sam did was continue to stare at the floor, John broke first. “Wanna try that again, without the bad attempt at lying?”
?” John asked, calling bullshit all over this. Why did the boys think they had to continue lying to him? “Yeah, and I’m the Easter Bunny.”
“You didn’t have to do this, Dean,” Jody continued, letting Claire go in order to wrap a soft hand around Dean’s shoulder, instead. She gave him a warm smile that Dean didn’t know what to do with. He looked up at her; she was only a little taller than him, and, once again, he felt like a little kid being praised and coddled by his mother.
Dean grumbled under his breath, cheeks still tinged red, but nodded. Sam sighed and disappeared out the door, leaving Dean alone with Jody and an oddly clingy angel, who kept creeping closer and closer to his side of the couch.
Dean rolled his eyes, Sam looked about two seconds from waxing poetic about how much they loved him, but Castiel was the one that stepped forward, wrapping their son up in his arms and tugging his head close to his body. Jack held out for about ten seconds, stubbornly refusing the comfort, before finally sagging against his father, a few frustrated tears leaking out of his eyes.
a little confused about how open he was being about it. So, for the moment, he was going to shelve it for later, like so many other things he had over the years.
“You’re our kid, Jack,” Dean told him gruffly, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and tugging him close. “We’d do anything for you, you know that. Blast to the past wasn’t the worst thing I’ve ever had to do,” he said with a laugh, ruffling Jack’s hair before finally letting him go.
look, but Dean just shrugged. Castiel sighed, rolling his eyes, and John figured that was probably his cue to enter the conversation.
He just wanted to be at Uncle Bobby’s, with Sam bugging him about whatever new book he was reading, and working with Bobby on cars the locals brought in, and just be
Sighing, Sam nodded and reached into his pocket, pulling out a sleek piece of technology. John watched him closely as he swiped a finger across the screen, then began poking at it. When he caught John’s grumpy, curious gaze, he stood and moved closer, showing John what he was doing.
did that mean? “Now,” she said, sounding breathy and a lot less drunk, “what’s wrong? What happened to him? You don’t sound like the world is ending, so it can’t be too bad, can it?”
Dean waited for the name to mean something to him, maybe knock something loose in his head that he could recognize, but he didn’t know the guy. Nothing sounded or looked remotely familiar about him. He was kind of adorable, though, in an old-man kind of way.
“You take care of yourselves, boys,” John said, feeling a little choked up all of a sudden; damn dusty house Bobby kept, no doubt. They nodded, turning as one to take Jack’s hands. Castiel moved towards them both, pressing two fingers to each of their foreheads, and they collapsed to the floor. Castiel laid Bobby out on the sofa and dropped John into the armchair, then placed a few half-empty beer bottles around them. Upon waking, he was sure they would just assume they had drunk too much the night before.
Something shifted beneath his fingers and Castiel let his hand relax, resting it against Dean’s head. He shifted again, more agitated than before, and Castiel blinked back to reality.
They waited long enough for John to gather up his things, then they all piled into his monster of a truck, Sam up front with John while Dean and Cas squeezed together in the back seat. John thought that was a little weird, but didn’t point it out; he wasn’t blind, he had seen the way the angel and his oldest looked at each other. The way Dean kept touching him, drawing him close, the way the angel allowed it. The guy was apparently a warrior of Heaven, and he was just letting some human man-handle him like it was nothing? No, there was
Dean whirled on his heel and headed the opposite direction, knowing more or less where he was going now that he had somewhere to start. The town dwindled away, and he followed the road until he caught sight of the sign for
“Okay,” Dean said, voice tight and frightened. He watched her hands warily, but eventually her hands were pressed lightly to either side of his head, and she closed her eyes as they began glowing faintly green. His insides were squirming, but he thought it might be better if he closed his eyes, so he slammed them shut and let her do her thing while he focused on the weight of Castiel’s hand on his shoulder, instead.
Moving up the stairs, and hoping they wouldn’t give way beneath his weight, Dean catalogued all the other differences, lending some credence to the newspaper’s claim of the year; there was a different picture hanging on the wall leading up to the staircase, there were a lot more books laying around, and a very complex array of phones with weird labels on them in the living room that
She puttered around for a few seconds, letting him get comfortable, before she came to stand beside him. She reached down, running a gentle hand through his short hair, scratching at his scalp just how he liked, but never admitted. He watched her carefully, wondering who this woman could be that she knew where he liked to be touched, how he liked to be comforted. She smiled fondly down at him, kind of how he imagined a mother would look at her child. Like he sometimes imagined his mother must have looked at him and Sam.
Sam was sitting at the war room table, stacks of books and glass jars surrounding him while Rowena took over the head of the table, standing over a burning cauldron, glaring at it.
He didn’t think too hard about the date. The only good news was that the newspaper stated it was the local Sioux Falls print, which meant he couldn’t be far from Bobby’s. He headed toward a busier road, probably the main drag, and prayed he would see
“Uh, Dad left us there for the summer, while he was working a few cases out West. It was always nice when he did that, though; we got to stay in one place for a while and Bobby was always awesome.”
It was daylight so Mary wasn’t too worried about the vamps having the upper hand. All she had to do was kick open a window and they’d all be scrambling for cover.
All grown up, big and strong and still hunting. The sense of pride filling Dean’s chest was unparalleled.
“Why don’t you go pack a bag, Dean? I’ll gather some weapons. We can take my car.” Dean nodded, back to barely making eye contact, before pounding his way back through the bunker and towards his room. Sam watched her carefully, but eventually let out a heavy sigh, running a hand over his face.
Castiel hummed in agreement before letting Dean’s arm fall from his shoulders as he turned and dropped down on the bed beside Sam, hands clasped between his knees as he sighed.
Dean didn’t answer, already feeling his head spin at the implications. She had pictures of him on her phone? Phones could
been this quiet. He kept glancing in the rear-view mirror to check on Dean and the angel, but they seemed to be in their own little world, quietly speaking back and forth, heads bent close together as they whispered. Sam seemed uninterested, like this was not new and worrying behavior.
“Hey!” half the table shouted in their defense, and Dean winced, shrinking back down in his seat, feeling miserable. His face was burning red and he just wanted to sink into the floor.
“You enjoy this show greatly,” Cas stated, staring intently at the television set. Dean rolled his head until he was looking at Castiel, the tv lighting up behind him.
Bobby grabbed a book from one of the shelves but held on to it, eyeing Sam carefully. “And just what do you need this book for, exactly?” He sounded suspicious, but when
“Time to go, guys,” he told the others, and they nodded. Sam moved first, stepping up to Bobby and wrapping him up in tight hug. Dean followed immediately afterwards, and even Castiel gave him a warm, solemn nod. Then the boys moved on to John, each giving him a short hug as well. He definitely noticed the difference between how they acted towards Bobby, versus how they had acted with him, and it rankled at his sensibilities.
“Sorry,” he said miserably, folding his arms onto the table and hiding his head against them, groaning.
“What?” Dean whispered. He would deny to his dying breath that his voice cracked, or that he felt about two seconds from tears. “How did
Surfacing for a moment from his shock and pain, Dean’s head whipped up, turning to give the blonde a more intense once over. “You’re a hunter?” he asked, voice higher pitched than he was honestly comfortable with, but he couldn’t control himself. Her, a
“Dean,” Sam said softly, and Dean couldn’t take that tone of voice aimed his way. He shrugged off Castiel’s hand, stormed past the witch, and skirted around Sam until he was speed-walking his way back to the dormitories. He couldn’t face them, not right now, not with frustrated tears prickling at the corners of his eyes.
Dean was grinning so wide he felt his face might crack in two. He had a kitchen, and a fridge, and was in one place long enough to have pre-made burgers ready to fry up whenever. The future
He swallowed hard, leaning away from Sam, letting his arms drop to his sides as he tried to put some distance between them. Sam looked a little wounded, looking up at him with wide, confused eyes.
Her smile faded slowly, quickly falling into worry as she stepped forward, putting a heavy hand on his shoulder and rubbing her thumb against the bone, there. It wasn’t like when Castiel put his hand there, though; the weight wasn’t comforting. It was more alien than comforting, and it made his skin crawl.
“No panic room in the basement this time, but it’ll do,” Sam said with a chuckle, and John couldn’t fight his reaction; he turned and gave Sam an incredulous look.
Dean’s brilliant green eyes were bright with interest, taking in all of the details, like a soldier hearing his marching orders. “Anything else I should know?” he asked with an excited, crooked grin.
, for him. “I love you,” he said, simple as that, and the others smiled, understanding what he really wanted to say beneath those words.
After a few minutes of searching, Castiel peering over his shoulder, Sam let out a sound of relief. Dean huddled closer too, squinting at the book and trying to make heads or tails of the elegant handwriting.
Dad had taught him how to clean and load a gun at eight years old. He had learned to shoot at ten, when the kickback from the gun wouldn’t be so horrible. He had learned how to hold a knife, how to sharpen it, how to wield a machete using his body weight by age six. He had practically been born with a weapon in his hand.
“Hello, Dean.” The corners of his mouth tipped up and Dean felt something tight in his chest relax. “It’s good to know some things don’t change with time.” Dean moved forward a little, wrapping his hands around the back of the chair directly across from Castiel.
Cas smiles, drops a kiss on the head of Dean’s cock, which is flushing deep red and growing firmer again, wet at the tip. He’s never been able to deny Dean anything. Certainly not now when it’s so willingly asked for, so hungrily taken.
And it goes okay. The conversation is light, but not stilted, and Cas is charming and funny and awkward as hell. At one point Dean thinks he actually catches him chewing on the side of a fingernail.
They’re standing on a small, empty road, the hot asphalt sprinkled with white sand. Squat timber houses line the street, and he looks at the small, white cottage in front of them, with its wide casement windows and corrugated tin roof.
Cas laughs, small and sad. Dean had high hopes for him, it seems. Or at least expectations that, if fulfilled, could absolve him of responsibility for Castiel’s wellbeing. Dean asked him to leave, he realises, so Dean needs to know that he’s okay. Dean, always so concerned for the wellbeing of those he loves, needs to know that he’s made the right decision — that Castiel is going to be okay.
“Coo-ool,” Dean drags out. “Well. I’m gonna get back in and…you know. Make sure Charlie hasn’t broken anything?” Manny laughs and waves him off. Dean awkwardly waves goodbye and heads back over the road, trying not to fall into a pothole or do anything else remotely embarrassing.
"Right, Sammy, how had I forgotten. You party animal. Bet you came to parties all the time in Stamford. Bet you know the best spots and chicks to—" Dean says with obscene hand gestures.
“Cas?” he whispers hopefully, although the body behind him doesn’t seem as broad as Dean’s thought Cas’s to be —not that he’s thought about it.
you could do after all the hard work I put in on this beautiful paradisiac reservoir.” Gabe says as he pouts exaggeratedly. "Feed me."
Dean rolls to the other side of the dirty mattress the motel had available. The cars keep running down the street, motors running and honks waking him every time he starts to drift off.
When her eyes widen slightly before she schools her expression, he adds "To go, please. Can't leave my brother waiting" and winks at her.
He was about to move around to explain that he wasn't creeping on Sam and the kid to, probably, a concerned neighbour, when the knocker spoke up. The deep, familiar voice immediately made him freeze.
His phone falls on the floor, the screen brightly looking at the ceiling through cracked edges.  The message lights up the room.
The fourth day in a row, when Dean came back with the treasures he had captured and sat down to the double shot of whiskey and a well-deserved story, the Captain had just sighed.
They drive almost silently, Bon Jovi blaring in the background, and Dean wonders if Cas could help him figure it out.
He doesn't know how long it's been like that. He's been in an emotional turmoil ever since he woke up this morning and besides a quick greeting to Sam, he hasn't been paying attention to his surroundings.
By now, Cas knows something is going to happen. Whether Dean is gonna babble about Sam's food choices, or curse himself for some unknown reason or, maybe, tell Cas to leave again, is something Cas can't foresee. Maybe he'll just be quiet and soak up as much comfort he can get from Cas without any of them doing anything besides standing besides each other. It wouldn't be the first time either.
He gasps and automatically flinches away from it, ignoring the urge to lean into it to soak as much comfort as a simple touch can give.
Dean tries to get up, to look for his gun and take the person behind Sam out. Nevertheless, every muscle and bone in his body feel as if a thousand needles were attacking him, and just getting into a sitting position feels like climbing up a volcano covered in lava.
Dean’s just a breath from summoning Cas when a familiar song interrupts his trail of thoughts, his mind immediately hyper-focused on identifying the song.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean howl's when the shock wears off, voice raspy and somewhat painful. "What the hell!?"
Regardless of his decision of coming back, he missed the sea terribly, and he was terrified of not knowing what to say or still feeling sad besides Sam because of the absence of the wobbly world he had spent so much time in.
It could just be that the bunker's working so perfectly it doesn't creak or squeak every few seconds, the thick walls are doing a great job of keeping the bunker isolated from any ruckus on the outside and Sam's busy somewhere the noise can't travel to Dean's whereabouts.
There were tears in Castiel’s eyes as he wiped his stomach clean of the gel. “Cas?” Dean asked quietly, not sure what emotions his boyfriend was feeling right now.
“Cas?” He gently encouraged, wrapping his arms even tighter around Castiel, making sure he could feel Dean’s reassurance. He needed to know what was wrong so he could fix it.
Castiel sat up, leaning slightly away from Dean. He had stopped crying now but Dean could still see the tear tracks on his face. Once they had finished talking he was going to need to make sure Castiel got cleaned up.
Overall it was a good first date, and Dean was quietly confident that Castiel would want to go out again. Dean certainly wanted to see Castiel again. They held hands the entire drive back to the dorm building Castiel lived in, and Dean walked him all the way up to his room on the fifth floor. Castiel looked a little like he wanted to invite Dean inside, but Dean didn’t want to push it to far too fast, and the slight hesitation that Castiel had made Dean sure that he was also not sure about pushing things to fast. Instead Dean spoke.
When they entered the first thing they saw was the staircase positioned directly opposite the door, a small hall leading past the stairs to the back of the house. To their immediate left there was a large living area with an intricate white stone fireplace and ample room for a family to play together. Past that was a small office next to a laundry with enough space for a washing machine, a dryer and a large cupboard. There was also a small powder room that would be perfect for guest use. To the immediate right of the front door was a large dining room and even larger kitchen. Castiel stared at the kitchen with a look of amazement. It was everything he wanted in a kitchen. Lots of bench space, room for a dishwasher, and a double oven, with a small sized walk-in pantry in the back corner. Under the stairs was a very spacious cupboard for storage, with some shelving as well. Upstairs the master bedroom had its own ensuite and even a walk-in robe, all three areas being quite spacious. There were three other bedrooms upstairs as well, each also spacious but not quite as big as the master bedroom. Jody even showed them the attic which had enough room to be used as either storage or even had the potential for renovations to make it another room. By the time they got to viewing the backyard Dean and Castiel were both falling in love with the house, but the backyard closed the deal for them. There was a outdoor entertaining area, followed by an decent sized area of grass, and in the oak tree in the corner sat a tree house. As soon as they set foot outside Jack started trying to wriggle his way free of Castiel’s arms, and ran to the grass to run and play, pointing excitedly at the tree house.
Castiel’s eyes seem to get brighter, and a big smile spread across his face. “Yes Dean, I would love to.”
Dean and Jack we’re now making there way back to them, Dean struggling a little bit to hold onto Jack as he wriggled about, clearly not happy about being made to leave the tree house.
“Dean, we’re parents. We’re not having sex in a car like a couple of teenagers.” Castiel tried to reason.
“The doctor will be able to tell us.” Castiel said as they slid into the impala and headed to the doctors.
“Well I don’t have any plans for the day, so I can if you want.” Castiel answered, completely misinterpreting the question.
When Castiel reached the seventh month of his pregnancy Dean had developed a habit of resting his hand on his stomach whenever he was close enough to touch him, rubbing his hand in an almost massage across the large bump where their baby was resting comfortably, slowly growing. The first weekend into Castiel’s seventh month was moving day. Everything that Castiel was taking with him to Dean’s apartment, now their apartment, was all boxed up and sitting in the front room ready to go. Other items that were bigger, such as Castiel’s bed, couch, chairs and tables were the only things left to deal with, but as they were being put into storage, and were much too big to be transported in either Dean or Castiel’s cars, they had hired a small moving truck for the day that Sam and Gabriel were going to help them with.
Dean went back to the bathroom and tried on the other pair, feeling a lot more comfortable in this pair of jeans. Jo was just looking up as he reentered the bedroom again.
Castiel and Dean both just nodded in response, smiling as everyone got excited. Jack jumping up and down and clapping. Since he had been told he was going to be a big brother he had been thrilled, constantly asking when the baby was coming and copying Dean when he placed a hand on Castiel’s abdomen, so that there was always two hands on him at the same, one large hand belonging to Dean, and one much smaller one belonging to Jack. Castiel was in turn thrilled that Jack so excited, as he knew that sometimes the first born didn’t like the idea of having to share their parents with another baby, but it was clear they were not going to have that problem.
“Of course.” Castiel replied. “I know that between classes and jobs college can be pretty busy. It can be hard to find spare time just for yourself.”
“Of course. So what are we eating?” Castiel asked, turning the conversation away from himself, and quickly drinking down half his glass of water which settled his stomach, for which he was grateful.
“That is your choice Sam, you don’t have to come around 3-5 times a week. Anyway, can I talk to you for a minute before we go?” Dean asked, nodding his head towards the kitchen and looking suddenly very nervous. Dean headed into the kitchen, knowing that his brother would be right behind him as soon as he had put the kids back on their feet, Castiel would then make sure they knew the rules about how to behave while Sam looked after them. As soon as both brothers were in the kitchen Sam looked back to check that Castiel was indeed occupied with their sons before turning back to Dean.
“Maybe a little bit of both.” Dean mumbled, lips now pressed against Castiel neck, also quirked up into a small smile.
Dean pulled back from the kiss and looked straight into Castiel’s eyes. “I think I may have already figured out one part of the wedding planning.”
All three men walked to the door, where Dean and Castiel said goodbye to Jack and Kevin hugging and kissing both boys, before Sam picked them both up, one in each arm, and let them watch their dads walk to the car and drive away whilst they both waved at them vigorously, before going back inside.
Dean looked up concerned. “Cas? Are you okay?” He asked, then noticing that Castiel’s light grey sweats were a lot darker around the crotch area and looked wet.
Dean maneuvered Castiel out of his bed and into the bathroom, turning the shower on and making sure it is nice and warm. Somehow they managed another round whilst they were in the shower, Castiel taking Dean as he was pressed against the tile wall. When they finally made it out of the shower all the hot water was gone. Dean headed to the kitchen to start some coffee and figure out breakfast. He had the ingredients for pancakes, so he quickly whipped up a batch as Castiel was getting dressed in the bedroom. When Castiel emerged Dean was at the stove cooking, his back to the bedroom, he didn’t even realise that Castiel had entered the kitchen until he felt hands wrapping around his waist.
They were both laughing like they were drunk as Dean carried Castiel up to their door where Castiel tried to reach Dean’s pocket to find the keys. After a few minutes of struggling to try and get the keys, and Dean’s arms were having trouble holding Castiel up anymore, the door flew open.
“His eyes. There is just something about his eyes.” Dean said, looking down at the table. He really wanted to retreat back behind his walls, but he had been working hard at trying to be more open with his brother.
“Actually I’ll just have water for now. Thanks.” Castiel interrupted before Ruby could write down the order.
“It works for me.” They stood in silence again for a moment before Castiel glanced down at his watch. “I should probably get going then, got a paper to finish if I want a day off.”
Dean was barely paying any attention to what he was saying, instead he was just watching the way his mouth moved as he talked, and the way the expressions on his face changed depending on what he was saying. The first half of the class passed that way, Dean basically just staring at the TA, so focused that he didn’t notice Sam watching him occasionally and laughing slightly. When the TA called for the break, Sam nudged Dean and gestured towards the door with his head. Dean wasn’t sure what Sam wanted, but he followed his brother from the room and down the hall anyway. Apparently Sam had needed to use the bathroom, so Dean waited outside for him, watching students rushing around to get to classes, or away from them to start the weekend, some students were sitting in little study nooks doing work by themselves or in small groups. It was fascinating to watch. When Sam emerged from the bathroom he raised his eyebrows at Dean.
This turned Castiel on even more, and he started to pound into Dean as hard and fast as it was physically possible for him to do, making Dean’s eyes roll back into his head and his back arch in pleasure, his fists gripping the sheets so tight it looked like he was going to rip them. He knew that he was not going to last much longer now, the constant stimulation on Dean’s prostate was drawing him closer to orgasm.
“Cas had a little freak out about his apartment not being big enough for the addition of a baby, so I asked if he wanted to move in with me. It’s not like I hadn’t already thought about it before then though.” Dean explained, earning him looks from everyone, including Castiel.
Castiel did believe him. “I know it has, we’ve just both been so busy with work and the kids lately.” He said, slowly sliding his hand slightly further up Dean’s leg to massage his thigh with strong fingers.
Dean went back into his closet and looked for his best shirts, grabbing them out and throwing them on the bed. As he kept looking he came across a pair of black pants in a gift bag that he had never worn, the tag still on them. “Hey Jo, I found some black pants, should I try them?”
Dean was just pushing the door open when he turned around and blurted out what he was thinking before he could process it all properly, so it came out as a jumbled-up sentence that made no sense whatsoever. “Did want go out me?”
“Hey Cas.” Dean said, blinking the sleep from his eyes and slowly focusing on the room around him. “What time is it?”
“It’s okay sweetie.” Ellen said. “I’ve been there. It’s not a fun part of pregnancy. But if you’re in your 12
Dean and Castiel turned to look at each other before continuing to walk to the theatre their movie was playing in. “I’m sorry about that.” Castiel finally spoke as they were taking their seats. “Gabe and Michael tend to be very protective of me. I know I’m only a few minutes younger than Gabe but for some reason they see me as the baby that needs protection more than Gabe even does.”
When the got to the hospital their doctor was waiting for them at the front desk, Dean had called from the car before calling Ellen to ask her to pick Jack up from childcare that afternoon, and got them to a room in the maternity ward as fast as was possible, running through the chart and a few questions once Castiel was settled in the bed. The doctor did a quick check and found that Castiel was already eight centimeters dilated, meaning his labor had progressed very fast and it wouldn’t be very long now before the baby as being delivered. The doctor then left as he had to go check Castiel into the system, not having done so when he first arrived, wanting to get his patient comfortable first, and said he would be back very soon on his way out. Just like with Castiel’s labor with Jack, Dean climbed up on the bed behind Castiel, settling him in the v of his legs and helping him through the contractions as best he could. Everything moved pretty quickly this time around, only an hour later Dean was standing beside the bed holding Castiel’s hand as Castiel screamed and pushed, this time not needing a pep talk as he knew he could do it. Before long there was a loud cry that broke through Castiel’s scream and their baby was there. Dean cut the umbilical cord then returned to Castiel’s side as the nurse cleaned the baby and wrapped it up in a blanket before handing it to Castiel.
“Dean?” The reply was very quiet, practically whispered. But there was something else. Dean was fairly certain his boyfriend was crying from the sound.
“I love you Dean” Castiel whispered when Dean moved back to kiss his neck once again, moving down his chest and stomach as well, to kiss where there new baby was growing.
“Yeah, its pretty good. Two bedrooms, doesn’t cost a fortune to rent and is pretty much exactly half way between work and the college.” Dean said whilst he checked the meat and grabbed the knife to start cutting it up.
“Well so is having a baby Cas, and we are already doing that.” Dean said. “I have the room at my place. I have two bedrooms so we can make the second one a nursery, and we don’t have to worry about you breaking your lease as its month to month. It will also be easier on you financially too, even if we decided to split the rent and bills it will still be cheaper for you than living here alone. What do you say?”
Dean hung up and answered the door. Just as he was shutting the door behind him Castiel emerged from the bedroom, a soft pair of sweats hanging low on his hips, and one of Dean shirts, which was a lot bigger on Castiel, running a hand through his hair, padding bare foot over to the couch. “Who was on the phone?” He asked, sitting down.
“I hadn’t thought about it. I guess I don’t mind as long as it’s healthy. Do you have a preference?” Castiel asked, genuinely curious. This was a question that had never come up with previous pregnancies.
At first there was just silence as everyone processed their words, but then there was an almost simultaneous cheer and Castiel and Dean saw everyone smiling and getting up to hug them. It was a much better reaction than they had thought that they would get, but apparently everyone was fine with it.
“Sorry. Need it so bad” Castiel started rocking his hips, slowly rising up and then falling back down again. He felt like he was being split open, but it was exactly what he needed.
Dean just smiled and wrapped one arm around Castiel’s waist and placed his other hand on his stomach, leaving Castiel to answer this question. “Yeah, we’re engaged and having another baby.”
“What do you want to do to me Cas?” Dean purred into Castiel’s ear. He was so turned on already that he was finding it hard to concentrate and not get distracted, he was also hoping that Castiel understood what he meant, that Dean wanted Castiel to be the one fucking him.
“I will, thank you for all your help Jo, couldn’t have done this without you.” Dean waved back and then disconnected, shutting down his laptop and finding a good pair of shoes, then brushing his teeth just to make sure he didn’t have bad breath, grabbed his wallet, keys and phone and headed out to the impala. His video call with Jo had taken a lot longer than he had originally thought that it would, and even though he had time still, he was worried about being late. Arriving at the college and parking outside Sam’s dorm building, sitting in the car for a few minutes and breathing deeply to calm his racing nerves. When he checked his phone and saw he had about 5 minutes left he got out of the car and walked into the building. As he entered the building lobby he realized he didn’t know what room Castiel was in, and they hadn’t discussed a specific meeting point. He also didn’t have Castiel’s number to call him. Dean was about to freak out about this when he heard someone walking down the stairs and turned to see Castiel there. Dean’s breath caught in his throat, Castiel was wearing slacks just like Dean’s except in a navy blue paired with a light blue shirt.
The nurse that met them at reception led them up to the maternity ward and Dean was relieved when they had a private room. He helped Castiel change into a hospital gown and sat with him for about ten minutes trying to keep him calm and comforted as they waited for a doctor.
“Hi Kevin, welcome to the world.” Dean said, accepting his son in his arms as Castiel handed him over to his other father.
Castiel read the fear in Dean’s eyes and reached one hand up to his face to reassure him. “No, I haven’t. I’m keeping the baby Dean.” Castiel could feel Dean physically relax against him.
The night continued on for a few more hours, everyone enjoying being in the backyard together, Jack going back into the tree house with both Sam and Gabriel, playing games and enjoying the treats of candy that Gabriel kept handing him, trying to hide it from Sam. When Jack started to fall asleep in the tree, they all got down and to everyone’s surprise, only because he was less sure of himself around Jack, Michael offered to put him to bed, and everyone else relaxed in front of the tv in the living room, Dean pottering around the kitchen cleaning up with Ellen and Jo’s help.
Dean smiled, he wasn’t really one for dancing but for Castiel he had always been happy to make an exception. “There’s no music.” He teased though. He didn’t like to make it too easy for him.
Dean crawled onto the bed, slowly moving up till he was level with Castiel, straddling his thighs and looking deep into his eyes. “What do you say we get you out of this suit eh?” He said, as he moved his hands to push Castiel’s jacket off, throwing it over the side of the bed, before moving onto his shirt. Dean was working the buttons on Castiel’s shirt much faster than he had done with his own. Once the shirt had also been thrown over the side of the bed, Dean pushed Castiel back gently till he was lying flat on the bed once more, then moved back enough so that his face was in line with Castiel’s stomach. Leaning down Dean pressed soft kisses all over, showing Castiel how much he already loved the new life growing inside him, and how excited he was to meet the new member of their family.
“You didn’t. You fell asleep on me on the couch, so I carried you to bed. I thought about leaving you on the couch, but I figured you’d be more comfortable in bed.” Dean explained, turning to face Castiel and sliding some eggs onto a plate for him.
“Maybe I could come to the class with you then. I’ve never been in a college class, could be fun. What class do you have?”
Dean sighed, that would be a problem. Dean was pretty sure he could get the bank to agree on the slightly higher loan amount, but he wasn’t so sure they could afford it especially with another baby now needing to be considered.
“Well, what is it that makes you think about him? Anything in particular that keeps your attention?” Sam was hoping that now he was talking, his probing wouldn’t cause Dean to shut down and retreat into himself the way he normally did when Sam tried to talk to him about feelings.
Castiel managed a small laugh, and the movement as he did so caused the baby to blink his little eyes open, eyes that were just as blue as Castiel’s.
“Sure Dean. Now go, don’t worry about this guy. He’s perfectly safe with me.” Sam said, his full attention already back on his nephew.
“Do you have what we need?” Castiel asked, a little breathlessly, his excitement making him feel like he was already close to finishing without Dean having even touched him.
Sam arrived first out of their families, followed closely by Bobby and Ellen, and then Gabriel and Michael, Michael grumbling about how he hated being late and that Gabriel had been the reason why. Gabriel was as cheerful as ever though, completely unconcerned by his big brother’s unhappiness. Dinner was going really well, they all ordered, chatted and ate happily, no problems at all. It wasn’t until after dinner that Dean grabbed and squeezed Castiel’s hand to let him know it was time before clearing his throat and looking up at everyone.
“The last one was 8 minutes after the previous.” Crowley answered, checking his watch. The next one should hit in a minute then I think.”
“Get some sleep Cas, I’ll go call Ellen and let her know she can bring Jack in a few hours. I bet he’s driving her mad wanting to get here.” They both chuckled slightly and then Castiel drifted off to sleep. Dean left the room and went out the front of the hospital to call Ellen and was surprised to see her already walking up with Jack.
Jo was shrieking through the phone so loud that Dean had to pull it away from his ear before the high frequency made him deaf.
“So how does this work? Do you just sit here for two and a half hours and listen to some old guy talk?” Dean asked.
“I’ll leave him here with you for a bit, just press the call button when you’re ready for me to return him to the nursery.” She said, smiling at everyone before stepping through the door.
Castiel just pouted, and Dean laughed, while Sam and Gabriel groaned, feeling that they shouldn’t have to witness this stuff.
“Dean!! Right there!” Castiel gasped when Dean found his prostate, taking care to keep the angle the same so he could hit it on every trust.
