It’s crazy how easy it is to tell Tony all this, when he’s holding Peter and listening with wide brown eyes, sympathy but not pity in them, and after Steve is done rambling his life story to a man he’s known just for weeks. It feels like he’s known Tony
Nick Fury explained this all to Tony with the help of Phil. And the thing is, Tony can understand most of this. He can get that he’s part of and funds a superhero team. He can understand that his life now includes being, something of a
Tony doesn’t reply, just swings an arm around Steve;s shoulder (he smells like lavender soap he thinks Pepper stocks for the whole tower, motor oil, like
“Your stuff, the photos…” there was one, they both knew the one. A bit before their first date, when Steve was still head over heels and no one even
It's not beautiful. Steve plays some random ballad on his phone and sets it on a tiny chair in this empty hospital chapel, and reaches out sore and bruised arms to hold the smaller man, and even battered and a little broken, Steve has never felt anything so lovely as swaying, beat by beat matching the beat of his heart, with Tony Stark In his arms.
to make a choice about taking what he wants because fuck, Tony deserves someone to love. Someone to dance with him.
But that doesn’t really stand well when he tries to walk, and Steve laughs, because he’s in love with this man, he is, really, really is.
“No, that is a misconception that many have. Some are small, but others are like me. Also, my mother was a land spirit, so I am somewhat of a hybrid.
Except, a brown eyed boy walks into the math class, and well. He’s just about the best thing Steve’s ever set eyes on, really. Brown eyes that look like they’re pure liquid amber, nervous smile and long lovely fingers wrapped tightly around his textbooks. He’s just beautiful, and smells- smells fucking
It is very much not 2012. And Cute Stranger is actually Captain Fucking America (he says he doesn’t like being called that, but still smiles when Tony does it, so whatever) and he’s an Avenger.
Tony says that he thinks those things are disgusting, and he hates them, and Steve pictures the two of them walking somewhere, laughing and holding hands, and someone fucking
He closes his eyes for a second and lets himself picture it. Tony wanting him back. Tony seeing him as something
Steve snuggles closer, and Tony feels hope cloud his chest, for the first time, more than the emptiness.
“We’d been together, and I thought you knew- knowing you though, you’ll always doubt- and I just- I was holding you and I thought, I couldn’t stand the idea of not doing it for the rest of my life.”
“We need to talk about this,” Steve says, “But I need you to tell me you love me, and that you know I love you. Because I do, Tony. The last 6 hours felt- I never want to do it again. Please don’t make me.”
this is, to be sitting with a freak, maybe he’s scared of the fangs, and he doesn’t want to look up.
“Steve,” Tony says, voice low and intentional, and there’s that whiskey sweet tone, the man he wants to drink in like a dying man, “Why did you tell me you were single?”
Tony’s known such little peace, and he doesn’t know if he’s ever truly been in love. He knows now, though, that he loves Steve.
Tony places his hands on Steve’s face, and Steve leans into him like he’s drowning, and that’s a testament to how awful he’s feeling. He wouldn’t brush their hands a week ago.
“You don’t smell bad at all,” He says, rushed and impulsively, “you smell- uh- really good, actually.”
“I think that’s the problem, Tony,” Steve says, and on impulse lifts Tony’s hand to his own cheek, tender affection on both hands, “I like it when you’re affectionate to me.”
He and Tony are closer now. They spend every other night watching movies, keeping each other company. Steve had been up one night, punching the shit out of a punching bag, nightmare after nightmare about people he’s lost, waking up to a world where love isn’t there anymore.
the kid from Brooklyn who thought no one would want him, whose fiancé just told everyone he’s leaving him at the same time as him, with no warning.
“I’m sorry,” he says, now that his heartbeat has slowed, replaced by dread. He knows Tony’s here because he wants to let him down easy.
“God, you’re such an old man,” Tony speaks, but he’s so close that his mouth brushes against Steve’s as he speaks.
The team is waiting for him when he steps off the jet. It’s just a meeting, he’s only been gone for days, he doesn’t get why they’d care-
“You were drunk, Steve, I’m not gonna think you meant something you said when you were plastered on Asgardian mead-“
But none of that is going to happen, because Steve came home to all o Tony’s things gone from their shared room, the frame that had a photo of both of them
Steve was sitting near her, on a Sunday afternoon, something like leisure in the air, rare in their home. Tony came in to watch something on the TV, carrying a bowl of popcorn and a mug of coffee, humming what Steve thinks might be
People are going to think they’re together. Tony’s hands are warm and dry and Steve’s hoping his aren’t sweaty.
and he loves coding and inventing. He made a helper bot when he was 10, and tells stories about him.
Tony rambles, and Steve assures him, and he places his hand on the small of Tony’s back (it’s too much to take, Steve, you’re
“Stark is wrong, you will clearly see if you watch with us.” Thor says, his eyes fixed on the television.

Maybe it’s the adrenaline. Or the pride. Or the fact that he’s been in love with Tony since he called a baby an asshole for spitting up on him.
Steve’s a touchy drunk, his hands all over Tony’s arms, and he’s smiling like a kid, and god, Steve is usually so hidden, shy smiles at jokes he makes, so careful with affection. How many times has Steve wanted a hug, and everyone thought he was just the kind of person who didn’t need them?
but that’s not the tone. His voice is soft and reverent, as if Tony’s given him hope of the best thing in the world, “You knew-“
“Pepper got me a ring as a present for our 15th year working together. It’s on my right hand, but the tabloids must have flipped the image. You know how they are. You thought I was engaged?”
He’s too far gone and needs to get a fucking grip, but Tony- Steve’s swelling with warmth, now. Wants so many things.
He expected a reaction, but everyone went silent. Nat looked shocked, Clint dropped his pen, and Bruce just looked sad. Thor had that solemn look he gets after a loss in the field.
to you, Tony. You can tell me now, you can say I’m not what you want, that you don’t want to hear from me again or whatever,” it’s rather comforting that Tony looks shocked at the
When Steve kisses him, it’s unbelievably tender, hands all over him and and smiling when he does, tears all over his face.
“You got your dance,” Steve says, into his hair. It’s addicting, holding Tony so close. He loves it, loves it so much.
It strikes him one morning, when Tony is still in his workshop clothes, a grease stain across an MIT sweatshirt that he’s not sure how he still fits into, and he smiles.
He needs to snap out of this stupid crush. It’s dumb. He’s a Baseliner, he’s going to realize what it entails being friends with him, let alone anything else, and he’s not going to let himself climb this high only to fall all the way back down. He’s just not.
And tonight, they were going to watch a movie together, and Tony might lean on him, and an hour ago that would’v sounded like bliss. Because almost isn’t enough anymore.
There is a photo on the nightstand of the two of them. It’s framed, but clearly taken on a phone. He’s kissing Steve’s cheek and Steve is
the warmth o his chest, that lovely blue glow that meant his world was still spinning on the axis it was meant to.
“I’m in love with you, Tony, even if you build robots and shake my hand with baby formula and never say your last name ever like you’re in the fucking secret service.”
“Steve, want to dance?” Tony smiles, swaying dramatically, getting closer, smiling that flirtatious smile he always does.
She smiles at him, kind and sweet, and then sits up, puts her chin in her hands, and says aloud, “I want to meet him. We all do.”
Tony had been calling him Steve, but the contexts he’d been seeing Tony lately had been different. He’d seen him more in mornings and in sweatpants, more in contexts of coffee and lunch and spare time in lives where that sort of thing was an immeasurable luxury.
Steve’s drunk, and there’s a million ways to tell, the slur of his voice, how wide his eyes are- but mainly, he’s
Tony’s got grease on the edge of his hands, more like stains because it doesn’t transfer when he touches Steve. He smells like metal and he looks like something out of a sketch. Steve wants to see all the different ways Tony can leave a stain.
Tony is a beautiful man, objectively. Dark brown eyes an a smile filled with warm mirth. Steve isn’t blind.
He can imagine the conversation they’re about to have. Steve, begging for forgiveness, for being with (loving) someone else. The tearful look in Steve’s blue eyes, the way Steve’s hands would linger-
“It’s not exactly unusual for you to be in my bed, Tony.” Steve winces, like he’s not allowed to mention that a few weeks prior he and Tony were sleeping together every night. “Sorry.”
It’s the best kiss he’s ever had, and it’s like a dam has broken- what he’s wanted since the moment he met Tony is now in his arms, pliant and loving and
It was the first night Steve had noticed how indescribably warm Tony’s eyes were. The first time he wondered if Tony had chapstick that made his lips look that soft.
“Watch your mouth,” Tony says, so close they brush together every time he speaks, “I’m in love with you too.” Tony says, shyly.
that he’s alright, that it’s okay that Tony doesn’t love him even though he loves him, so, so much, it’s okay that he might be with
this. It’s awful, terrible that he got someone to love him so much that losing him could break them like this.
“Steve, it’s fine,” Tony says, but he sounds tired, even though he’s slept all night. “You didn’t pressure me. You just didn’t sound like yourself.”
“You loved him, once. You were ripped away and- you’re allowed to want him. I wouldn’t blame you. I just wanted to make it easier.”
before any of us. He doesn’t know how to function without you and he’s so scared of losing you he can’t see straight when he thinks about it.”
“I always want you to touch me, to be around me, and it- it sometimes drives me a little crazy when you don’t. When you touch other people. When you call other people things you should call me.”
Tony asks if he’s a teacher, and Steve smiles, because fuck, that’s endearing, and there’s his fangs. And he’s scared him off.
“Your what?” Tony says, when they’ve pulled back, like he’s said the funniest thing in the world, and he is the
He sees a young man in a button up shirt that costs more than his rent, with curly brown hair and brown eyes holding a baby, shushing him like he was meant for it. The man’s obviously young, but he’s a natural- the baby’s just a little thing, only a few weeks old and slumbering happily in his arms, peaceful as though the world is quiet.
“You don’t want that,” he says, mirroring Steve and touching his face. It kind of hurts when Steve leans into it.
He froze for a moment, and hugged back. Tony’s just- small, fits in his arms perfectly, he doesn’t want to let go. He doesn’t.
Pepper stares at him for a second before placing her coffee cup on the table, tapping her fingers on the table in a rhythmic way, her nails tapping almost soothingly.
On a Sunday in May, Tony gets his morning kiss while orange sunlight falls over the two of them, and all Tony can think about is the ring on his finger and how he will be
For a second, he’d thought it was a misfire. A stupid idea, what was a billionaire have with a drawing-
Not tonight, though. Tony is drunk and laughing, smiling sweetly at everyone, kissed Natasha’s cheek and was surprisingly rewarded with a gentle smirk back, and just- happy. He was happy.

alcohol in his breath and lifting a large hand to touch Tony’s cheek, stopping short like he wasn’t sure he was allowed.
“This is mirrored,” Tony laughs, handing the phone back, and putting his stuff down, still got that excited grin on his face.
Some rare mornings, they have time. Steve will kiss him slow, careful, fingers tracing under the tank that Tony sleeps in, languid and good. Eyes closed, Steve would kiss him with a ring on his finger, and the cool feel of it on his skin, its was heaven.
He doesn’t Steve around much for the next few days. For someone who claims to have a weak spot for him, he’s fairly good at avoiding him. When he does see him, Steve’s gaze lingers. They eat breakfast together, Clint talking to him about the work he’s doing and Nat fixing his bed hair (apparently Steve used to be a big part of why he doesn’t look messy around the house anymore). Steve
He doesn’t think he’ll believe him, though. So when Steve leaves to go to his own bedroom for the night, Tony misses him, but doesn’t ask him to stay. Even if they both want him to.
and Tony is kind and brilliant and sweet and he takes care of these kids, and honestly, takes care of Steve.
“I’m sweet on you,” he says, because cowardice isn’t really his thing, and he’s played that card far too much lately, “Pretty sure it’s more than uh, keen. And I keep tryna’ get you to look my way, but I don’t think you really hear me that well.”
He comes home at 3 o’clock and James is waiting for him, and touch starved Tony flops down next to him, instantly cuddling into James, and sighs.
in the real world. He builds prosthetics for kids, visits hospitals and takes care of them. Takes care of Steve.
“I’m telling you, he’s ridiculous. Someone on the news had talked about Vampires being dangerous and he just wouldn’t shut up about how safe he felt, how if anyone said that to me he’d-“
warm brown saucers and pulling his hand closer, like he thought Steve was going to yank it back. That- that has to be a good sign, right? That he wants him near. Hope is such a hard thing to feel, such a hard thing to accept, but it’s welling up in him now and he just. He
“I… I need to go and get something from art class. I’ll see you ‘round, okay. Sorry for- everything.”
Steve drags him down again, kisses him silent and Tony thinks he might be just trying to ground himself convince himself that Tony is here that he loves him, that he’s
“Never better,” he says, even though he’s sure he sounds dejected. He’d just have to try something else.
“No, I only told you. And if you knew a billionaire, you might wear shirts without grease stains once in a while.”
“Watch your language,” Tony laughs, slurping instant spaghetti Steve had made,” That’s great my myour mother you’re talking about.”
Watching realization write over Tony’s face would be really funny if it was under any other circumstance.
in his ear, “You take care of kids and you cuddle Peter and you listen to me and you were the one who picked up the phone when I thought I was going to cry at the hospital. You’re my friend, Tony.”
Tonight, though, they seem to rush in, as Tony leans in close and whispers in his ear, “Will you dance with me? I’ve danced with everyone else here and it might look like I have some problem with you if we don’t.”
He’s sat there with papers he can’t read from there, and Tony- he’s got tears in his eyes, his breath a little shallow, and something has happened.
Tony pauses or a minute, then just kisses him, slow and sweet like he’s making a point, and Steve just treasures that he
“The guy you like,” Tony blurts, too fast and unreadable, clearly unhappy still, “Would he be jealous if he saw you with someone else?”
They kiss again and Steve’s not actually sure who started it, only that this is the best he’s ever felt, the safest haven he’s ever known.
he’s leaning on him and he’s so close, and he keeps thinking about it. How unlikely things happen all the time.
Steve Rogers looks at him like salvation and home, and Tony Stark doesn’t know how to be that, and it’s selfish, but part of him is addicted to it.
“It was just in an envelope. A fucking envelope saved my goddamn mother and I can’t even thank the guy. I mean, do you even know who this Carbonell guy is?”
“You’re okay,” And it sets int hat Tony’s here, followed him to the library and now holding him through an panic and James loves him and he’s about to lose him.
And so Steve follows him into Tony’s room, and doesn’t point it out when Tony’s tears well up. After all, he’s a sure thing.
and Steve- Steve wants to be there so badly, wants to run his hands through his curls, wants to be close enough to kiss his forehead and have Tony take all of his tenderness.
“Bucky came back, and I thought you would want your first love back. Piss poor excuse, but I thought you would be happier. That’s all I want.”
“I can’t,” Tony says, and it hurts, the sadness in his voice, “My dad- I don’t know the first thing about being a father.”
He’s warm and kind and smells like pine, the cologne he uses when he’s just at home. Steve can smell everything more intensely, and normally it’s a bit of a curse. Sensory overload. But he always wants to take in as much of Tony as he possibly can.
The next time he tries to flirt with Tony, it’s barely intentional. He’s drawing in the workshop and Tony’s working with a torch, on something he can’t begin to imagine.
just hugged him and insisted he’d called him by his name and he needs that, “I’ll call you anything you want.”
Two weeks later, Tony’s used his spare key to Steve’s place, sitting on his shitty couch when Steve comes home from school.
amber eyes and strong arms, wearing a rumpled white shirt and curls haphazard like he’d let the other little ones play with it. What a warm man, he must be, to play with kids when he’s dressed head to to in Armani.
“Stop staring, Stars and Stripes,” Tony says, not looking up from his work. The torch is gone and a wrench had taken its place.
was coming to their high school and Steve- he knows exactly what the Baseliner will be like. Knows he’s not going to look at him, knows he’s going to think nothing o him, just on sight.
this is the kind of kiss you never want to lean out of. He tastes like mint and he’s sure he’s not the best to kiss, both because of lack of experience and just having beaten several robots.
His shirt is white, and it’s tight. He think it might be Tony’s, smells like his too expensive detergent, and Steve loves feeling like he’s wrapped up in Tony.
There’s a lot of grunt work, just beating and breaking robots, and when it’s all said and dont, it’s the kind of happy ending they almost never get. No casualties.
And that’s just it, isn’t it? Steve hasn’t wanted someone in so long, and he probably doesn’t even know what he deserves, doesn’t know how to take what he wants. And now, Steve, who’s so young and so sweet and sketches his bots and saves the world has a crush on
“Hi, Tony,” he tried to speak, shit, shit “I’m just gonna sort out the mess, and then I’ll talk to you- although now I’m thinking about it, I’m actually kinda tired, so I might bounce-“
“Where the hell do you think you’re going?” His voice is sharp, and part of Steve still hates that he loves it even now.
“I thought you were leaving me,” Tony replies, and because he can’t himself, he pulls Steve in close and feels so fucking
Meticulous fingers, dancing across his workspaces and over his bots, talks to his robots and kisses babies like it’s the best part of the job. Tony’s- he’s really something.
“A gala,” Steve says. His eyes are so blue. So focused. Tony wants Steve to always be looking at him.
“So I’m Tony.” His voice is sweet like a butterscotch disk, and Steve hates himself for thinking it.
Steve was the one made of iron, before, and it’s like Tony had cracked him open, and Steve was tender in his arms the moment of. He’d made Steve think the 21st century was worth it.
“Congratulations,” And Tony’s brow furrows adorably, which is just gratuitous of the world to do to him right now, I mean, come
The people he love already like Tony. Peggy is showing off her electric shock, Tony’s big eyes are batting at Nat’s red ones, and Bucky seems to like him. It fills him with a lot of pride, that the people he loves like each other.
Tony says this like it’s nothing, like it’s not extremely kind, like he’s not everything Steve wants. His heart’s in his throat.
He sends Tony to bed, because he can’t be sure he wants this, know it’s too big of a decision to make.
The quinjet ride’s quiet, and Steve never lets go of his hand, notice. Tony remembers the last ride like this. Tony had been hurt, on his way to a hospital. Nothing life-threatening, but Steve had this way of holding his hand like he’s a balloon and the only thing keeping him tethered is him.
He remembers when someone tried to kill him, and he doesn’t want to think about it. He’s with Tony, but Baseliners hate him, usually. They’ve tried to kill him, and they’ve hurt him and he’s the kind of guy people fucking
Tony smiles, a quick quirk of the lips, casual like it’s nothing, but his brown eyes blazing the way he always is, burning and warm an affectionate and
“His name is Dum-E and he’s meant to be a learning bot and he doesn’t learn and I hate him.” But he’s smiling when he says it, and Steve warms at the thought of Tony messing with a robot like it’s a puppy. It’s how he talks about him most of the time.
“Exactly. What’s he gonna do when Tony decided an inventing binge is more important than food for days?”
“You sure? When I’ve been around the team you’ve kind of …retreated, and I wanted to know if there’s anything I’ve done, or…” he trailed off.
“This is ridiculous, James,” Pepper says, legs crossed and ginger hair in a delicate pony tail, sipping a coffee cup and giving him a sympathetic look, her eyes soft and good and he knows why Tony loves her. He does too.
Steve blinks, just for a moment, and then, he just- opens up, beautifully. Relief is all over his face, that and love, something beautiful and bright and blinding.
Their first meeting, the yelling and the fighting, to the moving in to the tower. The nights in the workshop, the countless sketches of
Steve considers it, for a moment. Tony, with his strong, decisive hands around his waist, dancing to music that he would never pick, brown eyes trained on
Tony’s free with his affections if he thinks you won’t break it, and sometimes when he’s not even sure of that.
Steve’s not much for affection when Avengers business is on, but he stalls then kisses Tony for a second too long. Tony knows this kind of touch as well. He’s done it before. Steve had told him once, he takes strength from him, and that’s what this was.
“I bet it comes from that donor. Isn’t that crazy? I’ve been volunteering here for years, and now these kids actually have the stuff they deserve. I’d love to meet the guy.”
Steve responds my just hugging him again. Holding the man he loves. God, Tony had wanted to bring him into his
because Tony always seemed like he was just waiting for Steve to open up his arms and welcome him home.
“Well, Mr. Stark, I don’t know if that’s appropriate,” Steve says, and maybe Tony’s about to get his morning kiss.
“Tony, I shouldn’t have been so intense about my…feelings,” and it’s hard not to remember the feel of Tony in his arms, how Tony had cuddled him to sleep, “I shouldn’t have told you while I was so out of it, or been so direct but- I’m not sorry for feeling that way.”
But Tony’s staring at him. He’s staring at him in the debrief and he was staring in battle and he’s staring now, when Fury’s talking and Steve’s not listening.
“You know, if you’re going to keep sitting with me at lunch, you’re only going to ostracize yourself from all the normal kids. They’ll avoid you in the same way they avoid me.”
It’s probably not the best decision. Neither was drinking. He hasn’t brushed his teeth and he really wanted to take Tony out first, but he’s always been an impulsive bastard and-
“I’m making friends. You seem friendly. Ergo, uh, I thought I’d come sit with you. There’s… I don’t know anyone else here.”
Steve scoffs, amused, and his hand does that reaching out thing where he stops short before he can hold his hand.
“You kept me waiting,” Tony says, tearily. He holds Steve back like the bruises will crumple his bones and he’d fall out from under him.
“Yes,” he says, honest, because when Tony’s with him, looking at him, touching him, it’s fine. Everything’s great.
Tony, in one of those suits, the ones Pepper fusses over him to wear. He’d thought about going to one of those with Tony for years now. Tony would look at him with that lopsided grin, whisper
“You ordered this blend a month ago as a gift for me. It’s too light, and you don’t like the cinnamon in it, do you?”
is why this crush is a problem. Tony just keeps getting better, keeps doing things to make him happier and it’s
someone on your mind.” Tony sounds suggestive, teasing, a way he’s heard him talk to Bruce about the coffee girl in the lower level of the Tower.
Tony looks gorgeous in a suit, which Steve already knew. However, it’s an entirely different experience to know that Tony was with
“I couldn’t have done it without you, Steve. I can’t do anything, without you these days. I owe you everything in my life right now. Everything good is because of you.”
Thinking Tony was beautiful is not an unusual thought. He’s an objectively handsome man; he knew it even when he was cocky and rude and reminding him of Bucky that made pain radiate like he’s swallowed a grenade.
“So, I was coming back to the room to tell you I’m not dating Steve,” Tony says, but he’s holding him, properly holding him around the middle and it’s selfish but James
“Yeah, but that’s because you’re new- sitting with me is just going to ruin your chances at making fr-“
And Tony, he just giggles at that, warm and pure and Steve laughs too, because in 2018 he still has the love of his life and his love is laughing att Steve’s stained pink hands because damn those things transfer.
He’s wearing a suit, tailored to perfection. There’s something wonderful about Tony, in his element. This time, he asks Steve to dance as a means to show they get along.
He does look nice, though. Steve’s suit is black, his dress shirt white and his tie a deep blue. The color of Tony’s suit.
“I uh,” and Tony tips up his chin, and there are those eyes, those brown eyes like jewels, “I thought you were leaving me.”
In the morning, he asks Pepper to send a jet to the tower, and he tells JARVIS to tell the team he’s on business. He is, really It doesn’t matter if normally he’d video conference.
“Hey gorgeous,” he says, and he shifts. The IV feels awful, but Cute Stranger might have an aneurysm if he takes it out.
wants him in the way he’d have when he was young enough to always have hope of love, not just when he convinces himself. There’s so much of him that just wants Tony to be all his, to be loved by the kind of man who’s presence fills the room so much you can’t help but adore it.
“Thor gave me a flask of something last time he visited, and I didn’t think you’d be home until later, ’n, ’n, I missed you, wanted you back and thought I’d just take a sip to distract myself. Didn’t really work. Thas’ okay, you’re back now!”
“What’re you thinking so hard there?” Steve says handing him a mug, intentionally brushing their fingers. God, it’s like they’re kids.
“Kinda figured, Cap.” Tony says, rolling with it. He’s so fucking bad at this. No wonder he never got a date, no wonder no fuckin’ dame ever looked at him, what was he even
Steve gets Tony’s number, and after that, they never stop talking. It’s like he takes Tony wherever he goes, now. Tony texts him when he’s in his workshop, or how much grease is in the smoothie his robot had made him.
If he needed confirmation that Steve was done with him, well, it came. When they got back to the tower, Steve marched right into the floor where Barnes was staying, before bidding Tony a quick goodbye.
“You’re so goddamn stubborn, Cap,” Tony says, before dropping his face into his hands and Steve’s heart
He’d been crying, obviously, but there’s something worse than that on his face, pain, raw and deep, tousled hair and crossed arms like he’s holding himself together.
“I don’t want you to fuck off, Tony,” he says because it’s sweet, how worried he is he’s upsetting Steve. He already likes him. I just… you don’t know me, Tony. I could be a piece of shit. I wouldn’t waste your one shot at making friends on a vampire if I were you.”
him, this morning, when he’s made Tony coffee, the way he likes it, that Tony coming up from the workshop and smiling at him and Bruce, that Steve thinks it.
And there had been movie nights. And missions. And nights where he learned what shell-shock was called in the twenty-first century and that Steve wasn’t the only one who had it. Tony became his best friend, the literal meaning of the world. The person he could lean on when the gates of hell were at his door, and with their career line, it came pretty close.
“Tony, I don’t know who your father is or what kind of man he is. All I know is that if you had Peter you’d do nothing but love him. Honestly, knowing you, I’m not sure you know how to do anything else.”
He’d always known Tony might wake up one day and realize Steve really isn’t all that. Tony’s a futurist, and what is he, really? An old man with nothing left, someone stuck in the past and clinging to it. Tony’s a futurist, incredible, and maybe he didn’t know how special he was, but Steve does. He always did.
genuine and warm, “if hanging around with you is stupid, then that’s what I am. Also I don’t think before I speak. That makes me kinda stupid as well.”
ring in Steve’s ear. A million scenarios flip through Steve’s mind. Warm Tony in bed, pine cologne mixed with rose scented hand lotion scent all over him,
They’ve never said it aloud, and Steve does tend to be oblivious, but not about this. He sees the way Tony’s gaze lingers (Steve loves it when he looks, even if it’s almost too warm, even if it makes him feel like the only man in the universe). He sees the way Tony looks at him like he wants to reach out, but he’s waiting for Steve. He’s willing to wait.
It varies, day to day. Sometimes, Steve will turn and face him, warm smile on his face, place a large hand on his rough cheek, and kisses him soft, gentle and tender like Tony’s made of glass. Other mornings, it’s a quick thing. Steve would brush his long fingers through Tony’s curls, press a kiss onto his lips so quick it’s scarcely there, full of love.
But he doesn’t know, honestly, if Tony wants him. So he settles for a hug and Chinese food, and getting a taste of the most wonderful man he’s ever met.
“I knew you’d come back,” Steve says teary against Tony’s mouth, still smiling, still grabbing every bit of him he can reach, “I knew it, I
Shit,” he said, looking down, trying to catch his breath, trying tot understand himself, “sorry, sorry, I’ll just… I’ll go get a dishcloth and- yeah.”
The tower he used to keep for himself is shared. Of course, Tony knew this, but it’s another thing to see it-
“I’ve got this gala thing, for the September Foundation. Was wondering of you’d wanna be my date. Just for PR of course.”
Steve asks him for lunch, one day. It’s the kind of place Bucky’d take a girl if he was trying to woo her. (He can hear him in the back of his head
tonight. Tony’s suit is a deep blue, ever the ostentatious, refusing to be black. His hair is curly, unlike what he normally does for galas. The delight Steve feels- he tries to bury it.
Steve pulls Tony gently up by the wrists, and Tony- innocent eyes expectant, a dance in the next moments. Steve wonders what it’ll be like, to hold Tony, to be his soft place to fall.
Steve pauses, an answer Tony doesn’t know lingering in the air, and Steve swallows as though it’s all his pride.
Steve does not say, “But once I met you, found out you were this stubborn asshole who actually gives that much of a shit about
For a second, he could picture it. The two of them, laughing, it’s easy with Tony. It’s easy to be good and warm with Tony, and he could trick himself into thinking- into feeling-
“Me?” oh, that’s hope in his voice, isn’t it? Tony looks disbelieving, but in the best way. Like someone’s given him the best prize in the world.
One day, Steve had seen Wanda having a chocolate bar, something called Dove. He’d been walking around the building with only, and Tony had noticed his smile, (because Tony was like that, he noticed things like his joy) and listened to Steve ramble about some story about military chocolate, and how when he was a kid, he scrounged up change.
“If you had any sense, you’d avoid me like everyone else,” and Tony frowns, he’s sick of seeing him frown at Steve, he wants to see him
, not when Steve spent nights where the only thing keeping him afloat was weird science puns from Tony and knowing he was listening. That he was there.
Steve huffed, “You left, and my stuff was in Bucky’s room, and you wouldn’t pick up the phone and I don’t know what I did but- I don’t know how to live without you. I’ve forgotten how.”
Doesn’t want to see his brown eyes look at him like he’s about to leave. Steve doesn’t know how he’s become so goddamn afraid of Tony leaving. He knew he would.
He’s not great at love, at this sort of thing, and maybe if they were in a dark bar in 1940, Tony wouldn’t have said yes. But Tony’s here, bright as a star, his light brightening everything in Steve’s orbit.
Steve laughs, pulls Tony onto the couch (super-strength is easy to forget about when Steve’s got that dopey smile) and then he’s in Steve’s lap.
Steve shifts so he’s sitting on the edge of the bed, where Tony stands in the gap between his legs, too close for friends having a spat, and Tony’s hand still on his cheek.
Tony walks out of the apartment and doesn’t give a chance to follow him, and takes Steve’s heart with him.
Tony wants him. He never planned for this. This is Anthony Edward Stark, beautiful and kind and brilliant and built a
He looks…perfect. He’s wearing a button done with vertical stripes that ends just a little bit above his midriff, exposing skin, some pants that seems little too fitted but still look comfortable enough. Yellow sunglasses. Grinning and
He ends up in the library, in a corner he and Tony only know about. No one is ever there. No one’s there now but him.
“You like him.” Bucky says, sprawled out on his couch, smug and sweet, Natasha on his lap, and Steve fucking blushes.
Steve looks up at him, wet lashes and red eyes, and shudders out the most heartbreaking sound escapes his throat.
Tony seems to get shy after that, and Steve doesn’t get why, but if theres’ anything he can do its make people feel comfortable. He knows what it’s like to feel out of it when talking to people.
Tony drinks it anyway,. Alright, that’s fine, Bucky seems to like him, so all is well. Nat reads Tony’s mind, and Steve has to reprimand her, and Peggy and Sharon show off their powers, just a little, and- and-
God. Maybe Tony had never wanted him in the first place. Awful presumptuous to think that Tony Stark,
There’s been many times Steve has thought this since waking up. Sure, in the beginning, some if it was lost in translation, the anger clouding what would eventually become…attraction, of sorts.
“Are you suggesting,” Steve says, drawing in a breath, “We go to a gala to make my…person of interest…jealous?”
Steve knows he doesn’t get to be upset about this. He tends to wait too long, not ask for what he wants even when he wants it so badly it crushes him.
“The first time we met I shook your hand after a baby threw up formula on me and I’d told you so,” Tony says, and Steve laughs at him, tucking his face in the crook of his neck, because he will never get it.
“Peter said Dada to me,” Tony says, eating Chinese food that he’d brought over, sitting on Steve and Bucky’s ratty couch, “to
It’s the kind of thing he’s expecting, really. At this school it’s all that ever happens. He’s a freak, and he knows it. It’s fine.
“Steve?” Tony asks, standing by the edge of the bed where Steve sits up to meet his eye, and then Tony touches him, brushing a hand against Steve’s arm, concern etched on his face.
So it’s not just… curiosity?” Because he hates the idea of that. Because kissing Tony is the best thing he’s ever felt, he couldn’t do it just for the goddamn experience, “You know- ‘I want to kiss a Monster and see what happens’ sorta thing? Because I don’t think I could- I wouldn’t be able to do that, Tony, I don’t want to just-“
Steve always thought if he lost Tony it would be in a battle. But he also knows he’d never let that happen, that if he had any say, Tony would grow old next to him, a retirement looming and one he welcomes.
but Tony- he thinks that he didn’t mean it, and this is the same feeling he gets when asshole reporters give Iron Man shit for saving the world
(Tony had looked up at him with big, brown eyes that could melt him, and in retrospect, he should’ve realized his problem had already started.)
Steve tried not to look at him, tries to tear away his gaze away, because of all things, getting stared at by a vampire, even if you were Unhuman, wasn’t the best of things. But the kid was so, so beautiful, smelled like everything he could
Steve. I’m- I’m interested in someone else.” And Tony’s an open book, written in golden ink in a language Steve was born to read, and he can see it plain as day that it’s
“Thanks for the coffee darling, I could kiss you,” Tony smiles, bright as hell, then winks. Tony is always affectionate with people, and Steve knows it would be silly to point out that
God, it’s a punch in the gut to know when he sees Barnes, Tony is never going to be what he needs again.
“You let me hold you,” Steve says, like it’s a secret. Like he’s ashamed for needing it. “Through the night, and you tell me you- you say that-“
It really hadn’t taken much, just a simple, “Hey, Tony,” and people had backed off,” and Tony had looked at him in awe, like he was the best. It’s a good look.
Not for the first time since waking, he wishes Bucky was there. Wishes he could heckle him about how he stutters when Tony calls him
says “New kid’s feeing brave, or he’s just one of those kinky ones that likes to fuck the monsters.”
Tony is the one who pulls away because unfortunately he does not have enhanced lungs. It’s still a slow break, and it’s that moment he realizes he’s holding Tony by the waist. Instinctive, he supposes.
Because Tony flirts like he breathes, all easy charm and endless charisma, the kind of sweet-talk you could rot your teeth with. And he’d seen it with Bruce, the nicknames and the laughter, how easy touch came between the two of them. He’d seen it with Pepper and Sergeant Rhodes, how Pepper was “the light of my life” and Rhodes was “honeybear,” and it’s just-
He’s not usually the type to push, but Tony’s looking at him, like he wants him to say he means it, and taking leaps when no one else would is kind of his thing.
If only Steve could just stop. Steve tries to get closer, and suddenly it feels like they’re alone, not surrounded by friends, Steve trying to hold him, trying to fix this-
Clint smirks at him, and Steve doesn’t think he’s seen all that obvious about loving Tony, but maybe he was. It’s not like he can help it.
She smiles, when they watch the movie. Tony settles next to him, and he can feel his surprise at how well this is going.
And so now, here Steve Rogers is, in the twenty-first century, trying to figure out how to flirt with his best friend who he kind of lives with and who pays for all his stuff and also happens to be the most eligible bachelor on the globe.
“You think I could take you to dinner?” He says, even though Tony’s so close he can smell the hint of mint he’d had a few minutes ago.
“You’re the one who keeps going out with Pep and Carol,” Tony yawns, and burrows his face into James’ neck.
to take care of himself. He cares so much about everyone else, he needs the care) and this time, Steve had walked in on Tony and
“My mother passed away today.” Years ago, Steve hears, and he wants to scoop him up in his arms and hold him, press him together until all his broken parts come back together.
Steve settles into the bed stiff and uncertain. Tony reaches his arms out, though, and Steve- well, he does what he said he would. He holds him.
Tony’s eyes- they’re something out of a novel, bright and brown and now- they’re teasing and curious. Steve sees the way he looks at Rhodes, at Pepper, at Peter- the people he considers his family. Steve can read Tony like a book. He just doesn’t always like it.
“Hey, ba- Tony,” he says, and winces, and Tony wants to gather him up, hold him until he can fix him. He
If he was the kind of person who said things like that, he’d say that his heart misses him. The heart remembers what the mind cannot.
“They weren’t hunters, Tony, don’t worry. Just kids. Scared kids who saw me on the street at night and assumed that I wanted to try and kill them. So they just tried to kill me first. Not that they did much. Gave me a nice scar from where one of them cut me, but I’m pretty strong. So… It’s fine, it- it happens.”
Tony doesn’t really ask, this time. It’s the first time Steve’s seen him devastated- really, really wrecked. He’s sat by a record player, some Italian opera playing.
It’s slow going, and Steve being around means his memory increases exponentially. The bots love him, and Steve is so good with them, talks to them like they’re real, and Tony- he can see how easy it would have been to fall in love with Steve.
This Sunday is one of those days. Tony wakes up with Steve curled around him. When Steve sleeps, he’s less scared of seeming vulnerable- just
“Sorry, I just had formula on me. Little asshole decided to spit up on me earlier. Although I don’t know if that makes it worse-“
It’s a joke, really. He’s curious. Tony is always that way, and he knows that Tony doesn’t know much abut vampires.
All those lingering touches, the warmth of Tony’s smile, the way Tony looked at him, like there was nothing in the world Steve could do to make him not love him. It’s all there, it never left. He wasn’t too late.
strawberry, He’d thought about this a lot, about splitting a milk-shake with Tony, about how close his mouth would be to his own, about how he would wipe a little bit of pink off of Tony’s mouth, how it’d get caught in his beard and how they’d laugh-
And it stings, the alcohol on the wounds but it’s worth it to have Tony touching him, to have the amount of care Tony gives his creations on
The memory loss was sustained in a battle, and a charming woman named Helen Cho tells him she’s certain it’s temporary, even if they’re not sure how long it’ll take to get his memories back.
“Do you want me there or not, Tony?” Steve says, but he’s smiling. Good. Steve should always be smiling.
Did he invite him here to taunt him, to show him exactly just what he can’t have? “I appreciate it. I know you can’t want people to think we’re together.”
He learns a lot about Tony through these events. When he’s helping making school lunches, Tony tells him how he just graduated from MIT a bit ago, then came back for a family emergency and fell into helping there.
“Wanna get lunch at that hot dog stand near 5th? I know you like to abuse the fact you have a superior immune system by eating trash.”
Steve continues sketching a preliminary suit he’d seen in the workshop once, and tries to get the bitter taste out of his mouth.
(It was Bucky. He knew who Tony was and getting gossip. Steve told him he had to get back to kissing Tony and then shut the door.)
The next day, Tony had bought him a Rolex, and said that it didn’t break their “no gifts over $100 rule” because it wasn’t for him.
Tony knows he loves him. Knows that every time he pulls him close that there’s something more behind it James bets he can connect the dots and see how much he
“Should is a strong word,” Tony says, softly, but his hand is still on Steve’s cheek and Steve leans into it, trained fingers sweet on his face. He wants Tony to always be touching him.
Before he can answer, Colonel Rhodes starts dancing with him, arms around his waist as the music changes, and Steve is still happy, because Tony is smiling.
And Tony laughs, huffs out a small chuckle and Steve eats it up. He wants anything and everything Tony Stark can give him.
“I know we’re young, and I don’t know much about where you live or how much being an inventor makes you know, but I think you’d make a wonderful father, Tony.”
The morning sun sprays golden light over the two of them, and damn it all if Steve doesn’t look like something holy, something divine in the glow of it all.
He doesn’t feel better when Thor lifts him up, and Tony laughs like it’s the funniest thing in the world.
the man who kissed him awake this morning, the man who insists on holding his hand under tables at meetings. This is Tony, whose heart he carries in his own, who’s heartbeat Steve has spent
“This isn’t funny, Tony.” Cute Stranger’s hands slip away like it hurts for him to do it, and Tony doesn’t
And in a second, Steve forced his gaze down to the worksheet. He wasn’t just a Baseliner, but a Baseliner who would want nothing to do with him.
“Tony,” Steve says, pulling him into a hug. Steve is brilliant at that. Steve could hug you and put all your broken pieces back together. “I missed you.”
“Oh hey, didn’t see you!” Cute Guy whisper should, enough to be heard but not enough to wake the baby, gingerly laying him down in his crib, a hand pressed lightly to the infants face, fondness all over his face.
Peggy was Tony’s godmother. He’s fairly certain Tony knows the significance dances hold for Steve. Tony regards little with care, little with delicacy. There’s his work, that his hands run over like they’re honored to do so, and then there’s the way Tony holds the people he loves. The way he hugs Rhodes, the way he held Pepper.
,” Tony’s voice is like expensive whiskey, beautiful and rich like his eyes that look at Steve, and a part of Steve that has been missing since 1940 feels whole again, “Would it be okay if I kissed you?”
(Later, Tony doesn’t stain pink. He’s beautiful and tan and the over-expensive bath oil makes Tony look
“No,” Tony says, tipping up James’ head to meet his eyes, and he loves looking at Tony, “He said it was obvious I liked someone else.”
They sit together every day. Tony’s weird, in a fun way, and quickly the most important person in Steve’s life. It’s not even that he’s pretty, not really. He’s funny and weird and makes him fill out spreadsheets, tries to make everything scientific.
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve turns and smiles, puts his pad down and listens, “I remembered something.”
Bruce chuckles again, sipping his tea serenely, and Tony feels the familiarity of it, like he has known him for years. But there’s something
Normally, Steve doesn’t like it when Tony drinks at parties. It’s a subtle thing, a sip when someone makes a joke at his expense when he doesn’t feel needed. Steve hates when he relies on the bottle as his best friend at a party.
And it’s weird, because he doesn’t think he’s in his bed, or his room, even, and with the serum it’s not like-
Tony’s mouth curls up in that mischievous way (and that’s not endearing, no, not at all) but then he goes shy, kind of quiet, like he’s
But here, and now, all Tony can think is that if there’s anything to thank god for, it’s the here and now.
“I said, my whole life I was waiting for you. That some mornings, before I kiss you, I thank god for time bringing me to you. That it was worth it. You’re are worth it to me, sweetheart.”
It’s a month from when he first decided to flirt with Tony that they’re sitting here, and it’s also a Sunday. They’re alone in the workshop and Steve’s laying on the couch Tony spends most of his nights on, and Tony, he’s leaning on Steve’s thigh, sitting on the floor. He’s tinkering with a fix or Dum-E’s eye-camera. It seems like the right time to say something romantic, but he can’t think of anything. He wants-
Steve, you going anywhere with me, the store, the workshop, watching you play with DUM-E and U, that’s an honor. I don’t think your, fella or whatever, appreciates it. I do.”
Loving Steve makes him better. It makes him stronger, better, and- he’d like to think he makes Steve better too.
“Not even for you.” Tony laughs, but sits down and eats the sandwich, and Steve doesn’t feel the tingle of Tony’s hands on his waist for the rest of the day.
how much he can smell him, everything he notices about him. His hair is never brushed, and his smile is toothy and bright and when he makes other friends, Steve doesn’tt ant to be jealous, he told him to fuck off anyway.
wants to see a ring on his finger and know he put it there. He wants to know what Tony feels like, wrapped up in his arms, how he sounds in the morning when the sun is rising and he’s only awake so he can cuddle him.
There’s a lot of reasons he shouldn’t. Tony’s drunk, they’re in front of all his friends he’s never danced before. Sure, he’s not scrawny anymore but dancing with the guy he’s sweet on is always scary.
something more than anything else, more than fingers brushing out of convenience. When Tony gets hurt, Steve doesn’t stay all night and wait because he’s nice.
He wouldn’t mind hushing the little guy- it’s scary to hear the thunder the first time around, and Steve’s heart already hurts thinking about the little guy crying will wthout anyone to hold him through his first thunderstorm.
him, the kind of love that makes you never want to stop looking, the kind of love that keeps your gaze glued to the object of your eyes.
“Wanna watch you,” Tony replies, as Steve sits up a little, JARVIS opening the curtains. Tony smirks, eyebrows wiggling silly and suggestive, and Steve, god help him, just looks endeared.
He’s also beautiful, brown eyes and permanently messy hair, the prettiest smile and gorgeous. Every time Steve sees him he wants to sketch him, put pencil to paper so he has some proof something like him existed in front of him. And crazy enough, Tony wants him
“My room has a bigger bathroom,” Tony smiles. He has laugh lines. He hadn’t when they’d met, on that quintet, lighting- Steve’s been there, and now he has laugh lines. It’s a beautiful thought. “We can use it in there.”
Steve steps closer, and suddenly they’re a hair's breadth apart, but tony’s gaze doesn’t waver. He’s just like that in the field, determination and focus, center of view like the earth.
Tony was always there in his own way, makes the best coffee in the world and always offers his arms up when he’s had a bad day. Tony loves him in the way he knows how, through saying it a lot and doing as much as he can.
Brushing matted hair out of the way, Steve leans in, and for a second, Tony’s eyes looking back at him, that makes every painful thing he’s ever felt completely worth it.
And Steve- he hadn’t known he was seeing someone, but Stephen Strange had been around more often, and Tony likes smart people, always liked people who could quip back to him, who could keep his attention.
Steve was happy. Steve was overjoyed, rambling and talking over anyone else, Tony had never seen him like this, not ever. Tony had seen what Steve looked like in just about any situation, but this-this was a man getting his heart back. A man in love.
and it was hard to tell the difference between gratitude and love when he first realized the amount of affection he has for Tony.
“Okay, so this is going to sound completely stupid, but he was trying to show me that you liked me,” Tony says, and he wants to kiss him again “ ‘cause you got all sad and stuff after, and that’s kinda when I realized that you didn’t- uh- you didn’t like me kissing other people. And I thought, huh, why’s that? And then… here I am.”
“Tony,” he stops their movement so he can look Tony in the eye. Eyes he can’t seem to stop looking at. “It’s an honor to be here with you. Anyone would be lucky to.”
And that… he’s just- he wants friends, wants to be Tony’s friend, but Steve can’t be, Tony doesn’t want him to be. Not really. And when he finds out, he’s going to walk away.
and Tony is so wonderful to hold, smells like cologne and pine and floral shampoo and Steve hugs back, because this is all he needs,
He needs to be away, now. It’s his first morning in months where Steve is close enough to want and too far to have, and it’s torture. At some point, he’s going to be okay with it, with him leaving him.
“You sure you’re not seeing anyone?” Steve says, once he pulls away. He’s not out of breath but Tony is, and he feels that
The funny thing is, if you had erased the two years before 2012, he would’ve been fine. Nothing would have been all that insane.
Steve walks to his room without saying anything, and it’s shitty and childish but he can’t really deal with this. He can’t.
Tony nods, and dances with Pepper, beautiful and dainty movements across the two of them, and Steve wonders why it doesn’t feel like he’s gotten a good deal.
“I haven’t seen your guy yet,” Tony’s voice is soft, beautiful, but it’s sad. It hurts to hear. “But I know that being seen with me- it’s more to help me than to help you.”
Tony talks through people like he can walk right through them, but Steve stays close. He laughs, and every now and then Tony places an arm around his waist, and he wants it to stay there.
An hour later, Steve hears a knock on his door. It’s all so melodramatic, stupid and silly and he should get over it, but he wants to yell whoever is there to
He lets Tony hug him, stiff because he doesn’t know what else to be, knows he can’t lean into Tony. No matter how much he wants to.
“I applied for adoption. Of Peter. I’ve been around for months, met background check worked out- I’m- I’m a father, now, Steve.”
Steve does, relents to it and leans into Tony’s touch. How many times has Steve needed Tony in the last few weeks and just clenched his fists and beard through it.
the way his eyes crinkled in exasperation and humor at him. He wanted to pen Tony down on paper. He’s an enigma.
“Hoping to be.” Tony smiles, and his eyes crinkle by the sides, and he wants to kiss his eyelids, hold him by the curve of his waist, and now he loves him.
Tony goes soft and pliant in Steve’s arms, because of the many things ever was, being Steve’s was always the best of them.
look, when he goes steely and focused on what he has to say, “I haven’t had you look at me like a stranger in years. I think it’s best we keep a bit of distance until you remember at least a little.”
Steve’s just brought the paper in- some tech conglomerate or something, Stark tech- he stops reading or paying any attention when he sees
When Tony wakes, the first thing he hears is a heart monitor. The first thing he sees a face so beautiful he thinks he might’ve died.
Honestly, if Steve changes his mind, he can’t blame him. He could enjoy this, besides it’s not like he’s allowed to leave.
The next minute, SHIELD called, and the man Steve really loved was found. Bucky Barnes, got himself from Sokovia to New York, was now asking for Steve Rogers.
“I…think you might be the only one,” Tony says, looking down like he’s suddenly afraid of looking him in the eye, “Frankly I’m surprised you like hanging out here at all. But if you uh, wanna look, you can. I don’t mind.”
and be Steve’s. But Steve- he isn’t going to want this in the morning. And he’s probably going to hate him for even hoping.
“I mean- like- if you’re just trying to make me fuck off, then that’s alright too, I get that… well, I mean, I don’t, it’s not like you have any other friends either and I’d like to think we get on okay, but I mean, I’ve been homeschooled my whole life, so what the fuck do I know about friendships? I’m sheltered and weird and you can totally tell me to fuck off if you don’t want anything to do with me. Like. Just so you kn-“
“Uh, because I like you? And kissing you has been something that I have thought about at length since like, the first time I looked at you?
And then he barrels on, jokes about him not eating him, and Steve- really fucking likes him, really. He makes him smile. Smells a little like pop tarts and metal, and he wants to kiss him.
Steve is a good man, and waiting 6 hours outside a door for his ex is, well. It’s something he would do.
