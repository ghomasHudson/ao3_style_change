“Kelly has suffered an extremely rare complication,” he said. “Some of the amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream during childbirth. This can cause a number of complications.” He paused for a moment, glancing at Cas to gauge his reaction.
“I smoke pot and drink occasionally. Dean hasn’t moved into a den of iniquity if that’s what you’re thinking.”
“Oh, shit …” Dean said to himself.
“When did it become a tradition to have the baby smash a cake?” Cas wondered. “I mean, it was adorable, but I just remember all the birthdays when me and my brothers were young. My mother would have been mortified if we touched the cake with anything but a dessert fork.”
“So, Dean, what’s up with Carmen?”
When they finally recovered and gathered their senses, Cas spoke first, “We need to go shopping.” Dean belly laughed underneath him and replied, “For both of us, maybe?” Cas flushed and then grinned down at Dean, “Yes, I think so.”
Dean was confused, but said, “Not much. The stuff I had before wasn’t the kind of quality Carmen wanted, so I got rid of most of my furniture when I moved in.” He shrugged, “I’m not a big ‘accumulator’ of things.”
At the end of the hall, Missouri knocked sharply on a closed door and then swung it open. “Pamela, get your feet off that desk, you’ve got company.” She waved Cas in through the door and closed it behind him.
Dean rolled his eyes and continued, “I had supper out with my brother. His wife called and said the power was out, so he had to leave. Carmen didn’t expect me so early and I walked in on the affair that’s apparently been going on for 6 months.”
Dean swung by the garage again to check in with Cas. He had an empty spot on his key ring and no new address. Cas had finished for the day, so he hopped in his own truck, more vintage than beat-up, and told Dean to follow him.
Cas caught a whiff of grilled meat. His stomach growled and he smiled, though he was still a bit wary. “Actually, I’m starving. Would you like to come in?”
“I want to feel you, Cas.” Dean squirmed under Cas’s gaze. “Fuck me. Please.”
“Did Dean tell you how our dad died?” Sam asked. Cas shook his head.
“Is that all?”
Of course, he was already missing baby Jack as well, but Dean knew that he was a little obsessed with Jack’s father. It occurred to him that he didn’t know much about Jack’s mom. Was Cas really Jack’s dad, was he a guardian or perhaps an adoptive father? Cas seemed upset about Kelly’s passing, but he called her his “best friend”. He didn’t wear a ring or even have a shadow of one. Then again, widows often took their rings off and he might not have worn one in the first place. Dean had the impression that Cas was somewhere in the middle or further along on the Kinsey Scale, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t have fathered the child. The longer he wondered, the more he realized he didn’t care. If Cas felt like he was Jack’s father, it didn’t matter whether the bond was biological or not. Dean was already feeling an attachment to the baby boy himself.
Cas pulled out a pale green album cover with a gold Egyptian eye pictogram in the centre. “You are going to love this!” My favorite uncle introduced me to this album about 20 years ago, and told me it was ‘good toking music’. He was right, as a learned later.” Cas grinned as he dropped the needle on the vinyl and gestured for Dean to join him on the couch.
Castiel had his back to the counter, but Dean watched as his head dropped towards his chest and he let out an exasperated sigh. He finished plating fresh cookies off a tray, then turned and dusted his hands on his apron and started to untie it.
The next morning, Cas kissed Dean awake. He had woken with the sun and already finished his yoga routine. Dean woke up grumpy, as always, but quickly warmed to Cas’ gentle wake up call and kissed him back enthusiastically.
Cas rounded the back of the car and surprised her, “No, that would be me.” He chuckled at Dean, who was still dumbstruck as he circled the vehicle, “and that’s Dean, who’s about to talk your ear off about this car.”
“I was a teacher. When my agent got me a healthy advance for my second fantasy novel, I gave up teaching and decided to write full time.” He smiled at the growing line of books by the wall and then at Dean and Jack together. “It’s been working out pretty well for me, and I’m glad I made that decision a couple of years ago so that it’s easier for me to stay home with Jack.”
“Please, call me Missouri,” the older nurse took his arm. “Let’s get you settled and I’ll let them know you’re here.”
Dean continued to frown.
Stopping six feet away, the man was wearing a dark denim apron with Bobby’s logo embroidered across the top, and a matching mask. He gave Castiel an awkward wave. “Hi, just checking to see if you’re finding everything you need. Can I help with anything?”
“Have I been cramping your style, Cas? Keeping you in every night?”
Dean’s attention snapped back to her. “What are you talking about?”
“My baby brother is about to become a dad and we’re going out to celebrate tonight. Want to join us?”
As always, comments are a joy to me. Tell me if you're enjoying this, ask if something doesn't make sense, and try to guess what happens next!
“I think from now on you need to stick to the whiskey.”
As she led him down the hall Missouri flashed him a friendly smile. “Don’t worry about a thing. Pamela is a real peach, and you know you’ve got everything you need to take that baby home.”
Finally, Dean turned in Cas’ arms, both of them still fully clothed despite the intimacy of their situation. His hands clutched at Cas’ chest and he felt Cas’ left-hand slide around his hip and up the centre of his back until it settled between Dean’s shoulder blades and clutched at his t-shirt. They finally kissed, deeply and with no inhibitions, morning breath be damned.
Cas opened his eyes, “I hope you like it there. We can shuffle things around a bit if you want, but it seemed like a good spot to me.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas poked around a few more of the boxes, “Here it is.” He ripped off the tape and pulled out sheets, blankets, burp cloths and a bumper pad made of cobalt blue fabric with shooting stars all over it.
Castiel’s mind wandered. This was the worst idea, but he really needed the help. “Okay, Dean. To tell the truth I’m kind of at a stalemate with the crib.”
“He gave up a lot. Bobby helped him get his mechanic papers and Dean helped put me through law school. I’m making good money now, but he won’t take a penny of it. Says he’s doing just fine every time I ask, even though I know he wasn’t able to save for a house or anything else all these years.”
“You’re right Cas, that’s exactly who Dean is, but that’s only part of it.” Sam looked at Cas intently. “He’s going to be pissed if he finds out I ever told you this, but you need to know.” Cas nodded thoughtfully and Sam continued.
“You’re saving me from a night of Netflix and chilling by myself,” Dean insisted, “And I’m good with my hands.”
He remembered the gift bag Dean had brought with him, now forgotten on a side table. Cas recovered it and handed it to Dean, gently prying his attention away from Oscar.
As Dean came back to himself and his breathing calmed, he opened his eyes and had a moment of clarity. His most incredible orgasm in years had been triggered by a slightly heated scene in a romance novel and the thought of his neighbour’s hands. And he had no idea if Cas was interested or available.
“Now! Cas, please!”
Cas cleared the glasses and bottle from the table, and then turned back to Sam. “Would you like some herbal tea?”
“So, if you want something more efficient I’d recommend this model. It’s more environmentally friendly than the old builder grade and the tank has a lower profile if you’re looking at fitting it into a small space. You’ll need a new wax seal and hose. I’m assuming it has a shut off valve installed?”
Moments later, another nurse came out. “Mr. Kline, would you come down to the lounge?”
“The Pogues?”
The neighbour’s door opened again and Dean heard a second voice. “Mr. Novak, can you come out front and tell us where to put this next load?”
Dean felt his insecurities rise up, but he kept going. “Well, yeah, I mean we could adopt, or get a surrogate …” He looked hopefully into Cas’ eyes.
“I don’t think so, Sam.” Mary trailed off and Cas realized they were coming back out into the hallway. He backed up a few steps and when they came into view started strolling back towards the elevator. They both looked a little shocked to see him there.
Finally opening his eyes, Dean raised his head slightly and heard a familiar popping noise. “Do I smell coffee?”
When Cas revealed a significant lack of familiarity with movies and TV, Dean made a mission out of exposing him to all the classics – Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Buffy, Firefly, Scooby Doo, and more. Cas paid careful attention, as if understanding Luke Skywalker’s complicated family or a careful comparison of Daphne and Velma would give him some additional insight into Dean himself. “The mythological Daphne was a nymph unwillingly pursued by Apollo. Does that make you think Fred is not as harmless as he seems?” “I certainly hope Mr. Lucas acknowledged his debt to Joseph Campbell.” Dean often learned just as much as Cas every time they had a movie night.
Dean drank his second cup slowly, alternating between the view outside and the better view behind the counter. He was careful to avoid being caught staring, but couldn’t stop himself from looking back towards the other man again and again. Castiel’s shoulders were broad and strong, which became particularly obvious when he took some fresh dough from the mixer and turned his back to Dean to knead it. Dean’s jaw dropped while he watched Castiel’s shoulders flex, but the bell over the door snapped him out of it and he recovered in time to look away before Castiel turned to serve the new customer.
Dean took a moment, and then flashed his warmest smile back, “Can I have a slice of that pie and a black coffee, please?”
Some time later Cas woke with a start when someone shook his shoulder. He immediately looked down for Jack.
“No, she’s been bending my ear about that for ages. She was just ‘window shopping’, if you know what I mean,” Dean’s eyes crinkled a bit and Castiel pictured the wide smile he knew was obscured by Dean’s mask.
By the time Sam arrived, Dean had cleared up all the empty boxes and was completely moved in to Cas’ house. It didn’t feel like his home yet, but he already felt more comfortable than he was in the apartment with Carmen.
The sitting area at the far end of the open space looked almost cozy with his small leather couch and an old mid-century modern chair in cobalt blue, along with a storage chest that was now serving as a coffee table. Between the sitting area and the kitchen counter Cas had placed Kelly’s tall wooden pub style table and chairs. The kitchen counter and island were still cluttered with a few appliances he hadn’t found a place for yet. Cas would still have to weed out a few duplicates between his kitchen and Kelly’s to pack away in the garage and downstairs storage.
Cas was momentarily silenced by Dean’s frank declaration. “Interesting. I’m gay, but I think you knew that.”
The shower became a full production. By the time they emerged, both of them were flushed and relaxed, but they had to rush to make it out the door in time for their brunch date.
“Dean’s not serious about men, Sam, he never has been. I’m sure Cas is perfectly nice, but someday Dean will find a nice girl to settle down with. He can have a family, like you did. Dean would be a great dad. I don’t want him to throw all that away by getting distracted with a man.”
“Is that the famous Jack?” Dean stepped in a little further. “Can I meet him?”
“It was one of the few things he owned of value, and my mom drove it after he passed. When I was old enough, I got Bobby to teach me how to keep it running. I saved up to buy my mom a nice used Toyota and then she signed Baby over to me.” He paused again, “I’m a little attached.”
Dean choked on a handful of popcorn and his eyes went wide. When he finally recovered his breath, he took a deep slug of whiskey before he responded. “Um, maybe …”
“I need to talk to you about something,” said Cas.
There were two boxes left in the room and the men unpacked them together, placing stuffed toys and board books on the shelves. The last thing Cas placed was a framed photo of Kelly that he’d taken when she was almost 9 months pregnant.
“I don’t know if she’s psychic or I’m just that predictable.”
By the time Jack was waking up again Cas had a couple of pages to work with later, a salad with bits of spicy tuna pulled together for his own supper, and a bottle ready.
“Do you know what the difference between you and me is, Crowley?”
Cas grumbled some more, laboriously shifted and pushed himself up to a half-sitting position on his side and yawned as he snatched a mug out of Dean’s hand.
“Drink some water,” Cas said, offering Dean his weird backpack straw. “Vasodilation.”
“Sorry for the interruption. Where were we?” Cas asks.
“Well, look who finally decided to show up,” Mildred said as she let Dean into her apartment. “And black scrubs today? You couldn’t be bothered to wear those tight coral ones that bring out your eyes?”
care.”
Dean breaks the silence. “Where are we going?”
“Cas, what the hell are you–”
Dean never, ever fell asleep at Crowley’s. He would lie in bed and wait until he was absolutely sure Crowley was out, then he would sneak out and head home. Crowley had never said anything about it, so Dean assumed they didn’t know.
He didn’t even say anything when the sound of soft laughter woke him up at 4 a.m., and he had to push a pillow over his head to drown out the subsequent sound of lips smacking.
After cleaning himself up, Dean was just about to click out of the porn when he noticed something. There were screenshots of all the videos, each showing a hard cock. Dean looked at the cocks on his screen and then down at his own flaccid one and realized his was bigger.
Castiel was still ghosting him, so Dean didn’t text him about his foot.
Pati:
There are weapons hanging on the walls – like
Some stress drops from Dean’s shoulders once his mom is out of the bunker. He grabs a beer out of the fridge and downs half of it before joining Sam and Cas in the war room. Sam is staring intently at his laptop while Cas reads an old Men of Letters journal to see if there’s anything about the British chapter.
Dean:
“What the hell is this? Did you find some self-esteem in the past week?”
He thinks he ate a bowl of cereal this morning, but it’s possible he didn’t. Sam didn’t wake up until about 7, so Dean spent the morning slowly drinking coffee and staring at the screen of his laptop. He doesn’t remember anything he was looking at.
And it wasn’t until he saw him, and felt his hand on his arm, and looked up into his eyes, that he realized that the love he had learned during the apocalypse, the reason why he rebelled in the first place, the first real emotion he remembers ever feeling, that this love had grown big, bigger than his grace, bigger than his true form, and it had spread so completely through every plane of existence and every dimension of time and space Castiel knew, and now, here it was. It was such a simple thing. It existed fully in the beating of his heart. And for the first time, he understood it in its entirety.
When they get outside, it’s dark. Dean has no idea how long it’s been since he’s slept or ate, he has no concept of what time it is, but he thinks it might as well be dark, of course it’s dark.
“Yes, well, I enjoy
Gordon ignored him.
“Dean? Is someone else there with you?” Cas asks.
Dean’s phone rings, which he takes as a small blessing to get him out of this situation. He doesn’t bother excusing himself before answering.
“No. Did you?” he responds.
Castiel stood and turned toward the door, saying over his shoulder, “Fine. Then no.”
Charlie looks at Dean and then at Amara. “Uh, you were expecting me?”
“No, fuck off. I jerked off in the shower this morning like some kind of incel.”
“You wanna know something?” Dean asked, still holding Cas, still kissing him.
Dean bites his tongue, resisting the urge to blow up at Bucky. He wants to know how that rumor started, but he’s too afraid of the answer.
“What?”
Dean:
Castiel squeezed him tighter. “I believe it’s called a hug.”
“See Cas, touch Cas. That’s how my brain works.”
He writes in his journal,
Dean puts both hands to his head and yanks at his hair. “Everybody, shut up! Shut up!”
A Friday
Cas put his hand on Dean’s cheek and stroked the pad of his thumb gently across his skin. “Dean.”
“Cas. What can we do to help?” he asks.
Cas sighs and leans against the door frame. “I think our best chance of getting my body back is through Chuck. But, um, whatever he and Amara are doing to fix things, I think we should give it some time.”
He talked more in his videos though, and he seemed to be doing better, happier. He certainly seemed to be eating better at least, so much so that Renee briefly wondered if she had accidentally subscribed to a gainer. His arms and thighs plumped up fast, and his waistline grew thicker, his stomach rounding out a bit. But another week later the softness seemed to have more tone, more muscle, and his body stopped changing after that. It seemed like he had finally settled comfortably into middle age.
They hotbox his room. They sit on his bed together in their pajamas and pass a joint back and forth until Dean feels so sleepy and relaxed that he lies down on his back with his head in Mildred’s lap. She cards a manicured hand through his hair and tells him about all the best concerts she ever attended.
“Yeah. Didn’t you hear us say we were going to play Scrabble like an hour ago?” Dean puts his letter down, and Sam sees the word “bullet” written on the board.
It was intoxicating. With the thought that hundreds of people might see him and enjoy him, Dean felt drunk with pleasure. He pumped his fist up and down his shaft and rubbed his thumb over the tip, biting his lip when he felt precome spill out. He moved his hips in time with his hand and told the camera he wished he had a tight hole to fuck. He grunted and moaned and threw his head back in ecstasy, shuddering as he came all over his wrist and his thighs. He moved his hand languidly, squeezing as much out of his cock as it would give.
“What about your boss? Don’t you serve Death?”
Chuck ignores him. He’s looking at Lucifer with a stern expression.
“Did you rehearse that before you came in here?” Dean asked.
Dean feels himself being sucked through time and space, his body feeling like it’s collapsing into nothingness before he’s falling to the ground inside the house. He hears unnatural screams, and he can’t see anything beyond a blinding light coming from inside the ring of holy fire, so he just covers his face and waits.
After Sam leaves, Dean considers texting Cas and telling him to give Sam updates, but then he admits to himself that he likes being the middleman so all he ends up texting Cas is,
“Please, Cas.” He squeezed him. “Will you please have me?”
He brought a bottle of wine and an assortment of snacks with him and let himself in through the garage.
Dean stalked off toward the Impala without another word. Cas came up beside him after a second and put a hand to the small of his back.
“I think you’re hot, too, by the way. I don’t think I say it enough.” Dean cleared his throat. “You have the most perfect fucking hands I’ve ever felt in my life.”
“Well, let me help take your mind off some things.”
Sam sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “I’ve had other visions, too. I’ve been seeing...I think I’ve been seeing the future, or just, things that Amara is capable of, I guess.”
It’s a joke he stole from Dean, but Dean still lets out an embarrassing laugh like it’s the first time he’s heard it. He then joins Cas in the kitchen, hugging him from behind again and sneaking a hand up under his shirt so he can cup one of his pecs, teasing his thumb over his piercing. He kisses the shell of his ear as he mumbles, “I’ll clean up in here. I know you wanna go work out.”
“Oh Christ, we drove separately,” Dean said instead. “Where we going?”
Jerome laughed and put his hands on Dean’s hips, bending down to kiss him again. He was a couple inches taller than Dean, probably about Sam’s height. “If that was what your bad looks like, then maybe I should stick around for your good.” He pressed his lips to Dean’s neck then whispered, “You’re very fucking sexy.”
Claire snorts a laugh. “I like her.”
“Hm. Sounds boring.” He grabbed a handful of fries and shoved them in his mouth.
The first time Castiel remembers feeling anything was during the apocalypse, when he voiced his concerns to Anna and grappled with the idea of disobedience.
After a pause, Cas says, “I see where Dean gets his impatience.”
“Actually, Dean, I may need to leave in the morning,” Cas interrupts. He makes sad eyes at Dean. “There’s a lead I need to follow up with.”
“You have? Since when? Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Yeah, I was afraid you’d say that.”
Castiel:
Dean sat up quickly, crowding her space and clamping his teeth down on her neck. Right up against her ear, he whispered, “What if I did? What are you gonna do about it?”
Dean:
you ask if you can–”
“Amara,” he says again. “Can you hear me? Can you talk to me? Please.”
“Sammy, what the fuck? Are you OK?”
“Well, I don’t know, I just know he hasn’t.” Dean fidgets uncomfortably in his seat as he thinks about how Cas acted when he was human, how he attempted to date and have sex and how terribly it all went for him. “But I, uh, I’m sorry I didn’t realize how weird all this would be for you. To be honest, it’s weird for me, too. Clint is the only transgender person I know, and I’m not sure I really get it, either. Like, I know he’s a man, but I don’t know what else I’m supposed to know about him and I’m too dumb to even know what to ask,” he says with a laugh. “And yeah, it’s definitely more acceptable now for people to be gay and lesbians and gay marriage and all that, but it’s definitely not everybody. We just threw a lot of ‘em at you at once, but that was an accident.”
They sat together in silence, drinking their coffee for a few minutes.
“So, what’re you saying? Doesn’t matter who you pick, because it’s terrible no matter what?”
Sam and Dean share a look. Sam says, “Uh, how do you know the disease has completely died out?”
cleaner than he’s been since he arrived.
one. And you’re obviously from one where I’m bad enough at my job to land myself in a goddamn wheelchair. That’s real great.”
Google was rather unhelpful about DNA testing, so Dean texted Pati.
but it’s probably rude for us to be talking about this when Cas has never, you know, like, said anything about it. That’s up to him, not us."
And Cas just barely says anything but a quiet thanks. They keep driving toward the bunker, and Sam clears his throat three times over the space of five minutes before he finally says something.
He woke with a start in the middle of the night and found Cas curled up in the armchair, sound asleep.
“They’re in love with you.”
“You don’t sound too sure about that.”
“So our dad did this, too? We’ve all been fighting monsters all our lives?”
He hurls the phone at the nearest wall and is satisfied when it shatters.
“Well, I—it’s odd. My identity is tied to this body.”
“He’s gonna be pissed when he sees the macaroni noodles in the salad,” Dean says with a wink to Cas and a nod toward the table.
Her eyebrows knit together. She puts her hand on Dean’s cheek. “Yes. And you’ve shared this Mark.” She points to her shoulder. “There’s no separating you and me.”
Dean smiles down at the floor. “Uh, overprotective I guess. I’d, uh, love it if you went and got us some grub. Let me just get the keys and–”
“Yeah, hate to break it to you, bud, but this is above your pay grade,” Dean says.
She waves her hands through the mist and makes a swirling ball between her palms. Looking down at it, she says, “I know your heart. What you have with Castiel, you say it’s not broken, and it may not be, but it isn’t whole, either.” She drops the ball and disappears as it shatters to the ground like glass. The cloud ascends in one swift motion.
Cas looks up at them.
Castiel looks back to his TV, propping his chin in his hand. “You could’ve just ignored me.”
“You said you don’t catch feelings. You’ve told me repeatedly you don’t catch feelings.”
“Oh, Dean,” Jody says on an exhale. “Those walls gotta come down someday, hon.”
“Yeah.” A soft smile took over Sam’s face.
Dean turns on his heel and stalks off toward his room.
Dean took a deep breath. “You sure you wanna know?”
Cas opens his eyes and looks over, and Dean’s head lolls to the side as he gives him a lazy grin.
“Yeah, so what?” Dean joins him in the bathroom, taking his towels off his head and waist and hanging them back up on the racks. He takes a piss while Cas stands at the sink messing with his hair.
Clint and Ida May head out before Amara’s up, insisting that they need to get home to their three cats.
Dean barely manages to pull off on the shoulder to puke into the grass.
“Hm. I suppose you’re right.”
Dean narrowed his eyes at him. “OK.”
She waved him off. “I know, I know. Relax. I’ll let you know if I need you to do a paternity test, but I’m pretty sure it’s not yours. If I’m even pregnant.” She ate more granola then threw her hands out to the sides. “But hey, if I am, then I can’t get pregnant
Dean mutters, “Yeah, I’m gonna trust a
He stared at the wall some more.
“What are you talking about? I live by myself.”
“OK, um...who needs a ride home?” Sam asked.
Castiel turned back around, glaring at Crowley. “Thank you.”
“No, Amara,” Dean replies, his voice sure and stern. “You are a child, and you can’t just do whatever you want. You think you know everything, but you don’t.”
Neither of them say anything the first few times Dean pushes the needle through his skin and pulls the thread through, but about a quarter of the way done, Cas says quietly, “You can’t hurt me, Dean, you don’t have to be so meticulous.”
Castiel watched him for a few seconds before looking down at the paper in his hands. It was a business card with “DEAN WINCHESTER” in black text on white background and a phone number in smaller type underneath. Nothing else. Castiel flipped the card over and then held it up like it was wasted time incarnate.
Dean did not sleep well. He was too aware of Cas’ presence next to him and the impossible gap between their bodies. In the morning, they hopped back out to the couch together and Cas left for work without touching or kissing Dean at all.
Cas takes the remote from Dean and quickly scrolls through a list of movies. “I don’t think so. Well, maybe I’ll sleep. I like sleep.”
“You don’t. You’re just desperate,” Amara says.
“Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me!” Charlie shouted, annoyed, as she stalked away from the bar and out onto the dance floor.
“What?” Claire exclaimed, her face lighting up in a rare smile. “You never date, Cas. What the fuck? How’d you meet him?”
So yeah, Cas isn’t exactly impressed.
Dean pouts. “I smoked that cigarette on a different plane of existence than the one we’re in now. How the hell do you smell that?”
Dean flipped through the pictures, finding everything from him and Sam as little kids to his occupational therapy school graduation. There was a picture of his mom and dad that he had never seen before: they were standing next to the Impala, and his mom was very pregnant with him.
“Well, I see, um, visions of Dad. Of him young, like, when we were
Dean stayed put and listened to her rustling movements, trying to figure out what she was about to do. Less than two minutes passed before two small hands gripped his ass and pulled his cheeks apart, then a thumb teased at his entrance.
He and Sam hung out together the rest of the day, talking and looking for cases and waiting for Cas. Sam rattled off healthy foods Dean should eat to put on weight, and for the first time in his life Dean listened to his little brother’s nutrition advice. Sam couldn’t shut up about it, clearly thrilled that Dean had taken interest in one of his passions.
Dean spits into the sink and nods at Sam.
“Yeah. I mean, she can just be in her own little world and not have to deal with any of our crap. Isn’t that better than her and Cas sharing brain space?”
“What are you–”
“Uh, just roasting some vegetables. We went to the farmer’s market right before…well, a few days ago. Everything’s still good. You good?”
Cas sighed. “My grace is not what it used to be. With the power of heaven waning, I’m dependent on Jack to keep me...powered up.”
“OK, maybe it’s
After spending an hour in Vince Vincente’s room, they figure out that Lucifer is planning to gain new worshipers at a private concert that night. They spend much of the rest of the day trying to find out where the concert venue is.
“Uh, today, I guess. You wanna meet her?” Dean asks.
Muffled through the door, he hears Dean say, “Oh my god, dude, I think Sammy thought you and I were having sex.”
“Well, look at this,” Benny said smugly. “You look as soft and spoiled as I always hoped you’d be.”
“Why would you say that?”
“Yes, you, Lucifer,” she continues. “We don’t have time for you right now.”
The third time Cas saw his neighbor, he was wheeling a–an oxygen tank? He was wheeling an oxygen tank into his garage. He looked around suspiciously as he removed the dolly out from under it, and he made eye contact with Castiel from across the street.
Sam sounds worried. Dean does his best to reassure him that he’s fine, that he accidentally hung up on Cas because he dropped his phone, but he can tell Sam doesn’t believe him.
Dean blinks. “OK, uh, Cas and I will…” He looks over at Cas and realizes Cas in a tiny woman’s body won’t have any sway over a group of panicked police officers either. “Sam. You stay here, handle the cops. The rest of us can talk at the Biggerson’s up the road. Let’s go.”
“We’ll be here every step of the way,” Cas adds. “Whatever you need.”
Sam keeps taking care of T-Rex like normal.
“What?”
“Hey, everything alright?” Sam says as soon as he picks up.
Dean breathed,
about his gender, and she said she—he considers her—himself to be a man, so. I guess that would be transgender, too? Because ‘trans’ means ‘change,’ and Cas literally changes gender through changing bodies? Am I getting this right?”
"We?" Cas said, looking back up.
Despite the fact that Dean often accused her of dwelling too much on ancient history, there were plenty of things from the past few years that Prosper didn't care to think about.
"Dean," he said. His voice was low, pleasantly gruff. Emanuel found that he didn't need his gift in order to form an immediate sense of the man. His hand told the story, the weight of his grip. "I'm Dean."
Cas' hand came up, finding its place on Dean's shoulder. "Nothing is wrong, Dean, I promise you," he said, staring into Dean's eyes, unblinking, unwavering. "Sam is perfectly safe, and so is heaven."
" - No, because I listened to Ash and Charlie explain heaven's whole 'open floor plan', and, yeah, maybe I only understood half of it, but I'm pretty damn sure the system don't work like that."
"Wait -" Prosper said, as Castiel reached out with his hand, but there was no time, none at all. Yet another new sensation, this understanding that their time was not sufficient for all that might be said. Castiel sent them to Sam and Temperance, and turned to face the windows, moments away from shattering in response to the outer edges of Raphael's grace.
"Uh." There was the sound of people shouting, of equipment rattling, and of Dean's short, uncertain breath. "Hi, I guess."
, Castiel thought, as he followed Dean and Prosper out of the room and down the stairs. Of course that was what came next.
was really fucking hot.
"No," Cas said, still shaking his head, but with a less distraught expression. "You're here because you deserve to be here, Dean. And you're not an idiot."
So he leaned closer, and cracked his hand against the side of of her face hard enough to send her head whipping to the side.
"You!" The second one said. "You're supposed to be dead!"
"Okay, but - " Dean's voice was also strange, rough, mere shades away from shaking. "I'm not - do you even - "
"We take care of Ben and Lisa," she finally answered.
"Hell yeah, it is," Dean said.
They were so fucked.
"Huh?" Dean managed.
"Well, what if -"
"How about a little coffee with that sugar?" Dean said, because if Cas felt like just rolling over and taking it that was on him, but Dean sure as shit wasn't going to sit here and listen to it.
Alastair had Castiel pinned against a metal column, a hand on his throat. Light was oozing from Castiel's eyes and mouth. On the ground beside them, the silver cat was also bleeding light as Alastair's monstrously huge spider dæmon hovered over it. And Dean was lying alone in the middle of a broken devil's trap.
"Awesome," he said, stepping away, flat-mouthed, hard-eyed. "So what're you doing out here, then? Come back inside and have a beer." Castiel watched him visibly wrestle against something, the Mark perhaps, or accusing words he had every right to speak but chose not to. "It ain't every day we get both you and Charlie dropping in," he said instead, reaching out to clamp an implacable hand down on Castiel's shoulder, a sign that excuses or attempts to decline would not be accepted. His fingers dug in, nothing like the prickling feel of Constant's talons, and yet...
"Yeah, I'd help you Cas, but I'm beat," Sam said, lifting both hands and dragging them across his eyes. Temperance was sitting as upright as ever on his shoulder, but even she seemed a little listless. Sam gestured at himself, then Dean. "You care if we call it a night?"
"We're not just gonna leave them in there, are we?" Temperance asked, twisting her head to watch the diner as they crossed the street.
"...Not mine per se, but it'll do," Castiel was saying as Constant landed. His eyes flickered toward him, then away. He listened, smiling faintly in response to something Dean said. "I'm not sure. But I am an angel." Now he did look at Constant, the lines around his eyes tightening as he listened to Dean speak. Constant could just make him out, his voice reduced to a low, muffled vibration. "No, he's still here. We're." He grimaced and turned his gaze forward again. "We're both okay." Another pause, then, "If we're going to war, I need to be ready."
"No. Pain."
The lioness on his back, snarling as her teeth sought purchase in flesh. She was large, easily matching Lucifer's vessel in both size and weight. Her fur rippled with the heavy musculature beneath; she was instinct and merciless intent, life in all its terrible glory.
It wasn't good enough.
, Castiel cautioned himself.
"Go," he whispered back. Prosper went, turning an ear behind her to check that Evangeline was following along. Ghouls had sharp senses, but they couldn't compare to Evangeline's or her own. Their dæmons might be another matter. She slipped into the thick brush, Dean fumbling purposefully for his blade to cover the sound.
"So. Um." Sam cleared his throat nervously. "Will you help us?"
He went to Kelly's room first, but stopped outside, sorrow welling up as he reached out with his grace. He didn't need to open the door to know what waited for him there: Kelly's earthly remains. She was gone, and Paz with her.
"No," Cas said, casting a longing glance up toward the door, like he was seriously regretting coming by. "Under normal circumstances, a human soul cannot leave heaven."
"Ugh," Dean said, grimacing and glancing down at Prosper.
Rowena was watching them expectantly, bright-eyed and curious, like she would be entertained either way it went down and that was all she could ask for. Lovelace still hadn't emerged from Crowley's pocket, but Crowley tapped the side of his wrist, and Dean knew what he would be saying right now if he could.
breath, "something wonderful is going to happen."
"Yeah." Prosper looked away from Hannah, pressing closer to Cas and Connie. "Let's go home."
Dean waited, but Cas was quiet, turning so that his back was set against the bridge rail, his elbow bumping against Dean's as he squinted up at the trees. "Something special about the memory?" Dean prodded finally. He'd always sort of wondered about Hannah. Cas spoke about her in certain way, like her name had more weight than most.
" - First off," Sam went on, ignoring him, "just to make sure I'm understanding, you think Cas is incapable of love?"
"No, but it should." Fuck, he was such a bastard. "C'mon, a month ago they were an angel and also hadn't even met each other. We should take it slow," he repeated, more firmly.
"It's not because I thought you'd be angry. It's just, I meant what I said. We have what's important, and if you didn't want to push it - "
"I see you're still having problems connecting with your mother," he said baldly.
"Yeah, well, I was wrong, okay?" Dean spoke in the same rough voice that he used when threatening his enemies with death. "The Mark was making me all screwy - "
"You promised to protect our family," they said through Paola's mouth. "You swore it."
"So what's the plan, then?" Dean asked. "Apocalypse take two?"
The mole didn't show, and Sam took off a while later, after finally convincing Dean to hold off on filling the tunnels with gasoline and lighting them on fire. Dean watched him jog away, then cracked open another beer and glared out at the still, silent yard.
"They're not telling us something."
"Made Sam into an archangel," Jack said earnestly.
He would not falter.
"Night." Sam opened the door, closed it gently behind them. Dean groaned and dropped his head into his hands, scrubbing his palms hard across his face.
She caught him as he was going out the back door, the trench coat bunched up small and heavy in one hard hand. "What're you doing with that?" She asked accusingly, circling around to confront him. He glared at her, his eyes dark and turbulent with grief.
"They were living in Texas when we got in contact with them," she said. "After we iced Dick Roman, they decided to retire."
Then she watched the Leviathan pin Cas to the ground, watched her throw her head back. Her mouth didn't open, rather, the rest of her face just collapsed away, leaving only that stretching, jagged maw. Prosper was already running toward them, but she knew how fast a Leviathan could consume a body; she knew she wasn't going to make it to Cas in time.
. Funny that she could feel anything from him; she had thought that all their ties were finally severed. Another perk of becoming a demon, the main perk in fact: finally being free of that stunted, stupid man.
"You won't."
Sam nodded shakily. "Clarimond said something to that effect, right before she vanished."
"Fine. Whatever." He yanked the door open and slammed it shut behind her. Then he dropped down on the side of the bed and dug the heels of his hands against his eyes. If it was going to be like this, if they couldn't at least pretend...he didn't know what to do, didn't know how he would be able to stand it.
"They're alright," Prosper said, as Dean reached over her for his suit jacket.
"What's it look like?" Dean answered, gesturing to his forgotten beer bottle. "Celebrating."
"That was short-sighted of me." Dean was staring at him, growing anger, hurt, confusion. Castiel forced himself to continue. "I'm an angel, Dean. Heaven is where I belong."
Dean turned around and glared at Prosper. "Really?" He snatched his beer glass off the table, swallowed the remnants and set it back down with a thunk. "What the hell was that?"
"We'll save it," Evangeline answered. "You go on."
It was midday when he woke back up. Sam was snoring softly in the nearby armchair, Temperance perched on the back with her head tucked into her feathers. Dean's hand was buried in something perfectly soft and warm; he shuffled his face to the edge of the couch and glared at his traitorous limb where it was clutching Prosper's coat. He let go and swung himself upright, digging his knuckles in against his eyes. He didn't hear her, didn't look at her, but he knew Prosper was awake now too, and standing beside him.
So when he and Dean tangle together in the backseat for the first time and Cas reaches for the other man’s belt buckle, Dean stops him and asks, “You sure you alright with this? It’s going to be messy.”
“Yes,” Cas answered simply. “You look very good.”
Amara says, “Enough. Let’s end this.”
Dean looks at Cas, but Cas remains suspiciously quiet.
“OK, that’s great, but we’re stuck
Dean is about to tell her that none of the prequels are worth seeing but maybe they can watch
“So why are you so pissed at him?” Sam asks.
Cas cleared his throat and adjusted his hands, folding them together and interlocking his fingers on top of the table. “Does it bother you? Sam hunting with another person, I mean.”
She used to be his Wednesday, but only for a few months until her work schedule changed and he couldn’t fit her in any other day of the week. Also, when Benny wanted to come to this bar, Dean knew he couldn’t keep seeing both of them.
“Dean Winchester?” Bucky asks.
“Uh, I think Mom thinks you and Cas are...you know.”
Amara frowns at him. “I can feel it. That bomb in you, I can feel it. You were going to kill me, Dean?”
“So Rowena and Crowley just showed up at the front door, and Eileen is playing the perfect host and making them a pot of tea in the kitchen right now,” Charlie says. “And, uh, they told us what happened, so I started, uh, well…”
Cas flips through book after book, clearly becoming more frustrated with each one, but he doesn’t stop. Sam and Dean look on their laptops, finding nothing helpful, until Dean starts to nod off and nearly drops his head to his keyboard.
“What?”
“I mean, we know Rowena,” Charlie continues. “What about Rowena? Why do we need witches?”
Silence falls over the room again. Cas moves in his chair, angling himself toward Amara.
"Yeah, but - "
"Oh, for the love of -" Meg huffed, following after them.
"Oh." Jack's expression cleared. "We thought that four would be sufficient."
A moment alone in Dean's room. More than enough time to take the Colt. Fulfillment of purpose had never tasted so bitter, or felt so near defeat. "Thank you," Castiel managed to say. They started to turn away, and Castiel knew he should let them go, knew that every moment he spent here was another moment that Dagon and Kelly Kline might change locations. But he still spoke. "Wait. Prosper."
"If they're anything like John and Clementine, then we know they're stubborn," Gallant said dryly. "And we've already come all this way."
And then Sam had done her one better by telling Dean that they wanted him and Prosper to leave them in the Cage with Lucifer.
Once, it would have been the easiest question in the world to answer.
"Dude, come on," Charlie said, motioning with her eyes. "Don't leave us hanging here."
"Thank you. It's very disconcerting, isn't it?"
"There is no reason for anger," Cas said, going on to explain how the Word of God was basically a Bat Signal to the next prophet, and how the angels, of course, were supposed to whisk the guy away to read it some place where it wouldn't do humanity a lick of good. What was the point of that? Why even write an instruction manual that only one guy could read, then take the guy away from the people who needed the manual, to build the whatever-it-was, to take out the Leviathan?
"How's Connie?" She prayed on, determined to believe that Cas was hearing her. "Tell him I said hi. How are you? I can't believe I - "
This was a pointless thought exercise. Also, Castiel was having difficulty thinking. "If - if earth was safe, and heaven and hell were both stable?" Dean nodded, the light moving across the bridge of his nose, his cheeks. "Then I suppose I would return to heaven."
"Huh." Dean thought about it a minute. "You know what? Leave it. I think I've got an idea what to do with it." It sure as shit didn't have anything to do with peace or personal growth, but he figured it would be pretty freaking hilarious all the same, when he finally caught the thing and set it loose in Sam's house.
"I...to be honest, I mostly felt relieved." Dean made a noise of disbelief and Cas' fingers squeezed along his knee in response. "It's the truth. After being in the Empty, dreaming about my mistakes, my failures, and there are many, Dean, more than you know, it - it was an incredible relief, to be able to have that."
Castiel looked up; his arm lifted. Constant landed on his wrist, wrapped his talons around bone and flesh. It was like touching a stranger.
Almost one year later …
“Drink or smoke pot?”
Dean took a quick look and followed Cas further down the hall as he opened a door and waved Dean into the room.
When he settled into a rocking chair the nurse laid the newborn in his arms and handed him a small bottle. “Support his neck and start by just brushing the nipple on his bottom lip. Let’s see how good his instincts are.”
"This is wrong, what are you doing?" the sapling screamed.
attached,” Lilith warned. “I mean, in what, a month or two? He’s set to be airlifted out of here by the flying fuckfaces and then—bye-bye Winchester, hello Lucifer-Michael prizefight.” She leaned back, a glazed look in her eyes. “Damn, that’ll be hot. Seeing one of those uptight creeps walking around in that meatsuit, don’t you think?”
“Is that the guy from the State Farm ad?” Sam asks.
There it was again, and this time it stayed. Alastair's hand clamped around his own, stopping his release, and Dean let out a shaky groan. Desperation, but gratitude, too. Alastair was touching him. His warm breath traveled over Dean's chest. His teeth nipped at Dean's skin, and Dean moved—forward, backward, he didn't know. "I've got you," Alastair whispered.
On the middle of the page, staring back at him, it said, “No take backs, no tricks.”
“Of course, Dean! This is wonderful! Here, let me get the broom,” he said, sweeping up the shattered cup in excitement. When it was cleaned away, Cas turned back around, stopping short when faced with a brand new color shining against the gray. Something wondrous and unexpected. Dean’s eyes were
Dean felt a little guilty. “Sorry,” he said.
Cas tilted his head and squinted at Dean doubtfully, and Dean’s mouth tugged into a smile.
Alastair grunted.
“Are you saying Cas…
food.”
“Remember when I was at work and I heard a shady conversation between Uriel and a man with yellow eyes?”
Cas was dead. The spell had failed, leaving him with less than before they’d started. Even the coat and the handprint were gone, burned to ash.
“Damn it, Cas!” Dean said, suddenly angry. “Why do you always have to torture yourself?” The coffee in his cup had formed into a tendril and was moving, curling as though it was reaching for something—or
“Yes,” Cas said. “But she didn’t want to talk about it over the phone.”
“Dean,” Cas said, and the word was a reassurance.
Dean stared at his husband uncomprehending, before looking back down at his cup. The dark liquid was swirling, looking thicker and darker than it had any right to.
Alastair led him away from the water via cobbled, climbing alleys that barely held a cart, and through a nondescript door into a low room lighted with candles. The walls were a mosaic of green and blue glass in the shape of waves, the tablecloths were clean and pressed and the servers had no tongues. Alastair ordered pure virgin blood, the real deal; and a heaping collection of sweetmeats: marzipan confections in the shape of swans, glittering with coarse sugar and gilded with silver leaf; buttery gold masghati flavored with rose water and saffron; dates; and sugar plums; and konda kavum—glistening red rice oil cakes with kithul syrup and fennel.
“I am, I… managed to project this television frequency to your room. It was the only way I could think of to make contact.”

"Yeah, okay," Dean said. "But listen, what if it doesn't find you? I mean, you can't exactly walk up to it. You've only got roots."

“His,” Alastair said. “Technically.”
Dean tilted his head back, let his eyes flutter shut. He could no longer see Alastair, but felt his nearness like a prickle of want; the heat of skin against the cold. He was moving faster, sweat smooth, a whine caught in his throat, aching for touch, but Alastair only stepped closer. So close the static between their skin tingled. Not touching yet.
Sam leans over to look at the tv, raising an eyebrow. “How can you tell?”
Cas looked at it. “Hopefully,” he said.
“Sure,” Sam said. “One, two…”
The other bank was growing closer, now, and soon the boat bumped up against the mucky edge, silt swirling up where it hit ground.

“Azazel, you worry too much,” said Uriel.

"I thought I was alone," the sapling said, when Dean drew near. One leaf brushed against him in welcome. "I woke up and I was alone, but now the burning one has found me. It will take me to paradise."
“Don’t you think we should fix it?”
After a moment, Dean added, “hate to break the chain, but I think I’m out of toppings.”
“What are you doing at the police station, you’re supposed to be at work!”
“Besties!” Jack said, delightedly.
Dean is taken aback. “Is he real?”
"We were hasty in our escape," Alastair said. "I thought distance was better than stealth, at least to start; figured the whole army wouldn't follow us. It was too much to hope we'd lose them all." He shrugged, and started back down into the canyon. "It smelled us."
“Dean,” Alastair said, and Dean turned back as Alastair grabbed his hand and led their way into the crowd.
“That was weeks ago.”

Dean was just about to come up with a brilliant rejoinder, when the phone rang.
“So you mean I need to…?”

, but either way it was the opposite of pleasant. When he stepped away from Alastair in the new place, he had to focus on not blacking out for a good moment. It felt like his intestines had been pulled out of his stomach while the rest of him was being pressed flat between encroaching trap-walls. The combination was actually a new one, though he'd experienced both on their own before.
A soft wingbeat resonated from nearby as a white stork flew through the open window. It deposited a basket on the table, puttered around for a moment, took the pear from the fruit bowl and flew away.
“That’s me,” Jake admits, gesturing to a pair of khakis on the floor.
“I know, but he’s our baby,” Cas said.
Cas felt an uneasy feeling in his stomach as he raised his pen and slowly signed his name, placing it on top of his previous contract. He grabbed another sheet.
Dean glanced over; Alastair was ignoring the ferryman and instead whistling
“What’s this? On the rack it was all ‘I want, I want, I want’ and now nothing?”
“My apologies,” Cas said, turning to walk away, before stopping and looking back at Uriel. “About Zachariah—I just wanted to—”
“Nothing good,” Cas said, gravely.
“What?” Dean asked, as Cas groaned.
THROUGH ME THE WAY THAT RUNS AMONG THE LOST.
The next day, Cas went to work as usual, sitting himself at his desk next to Balthazar, who greeted him in a friendly tone. “Hey, Halloween is next week, remember?”
Dean looked Cas straight in the eye. Cas stared back. The clock on the wall ticked past second by second, as Dean’s expression changed from panic to incredulity to a formidable, very settled annoyance. “Ok, fudge this, I’m out,” he said. “We are
“…How?” Cas asked.
) "1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. 4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged."
Cas began sliding off the couch, but Dean grabbed his arm before he could.
Sam turned to Dean. “Will you be all right in there?” he asked.
. He knew what that meant in Dean’s mouth.
Then Sam was taking a breath, facing them both, and there was that stubborn bullheadedness in the set of his shoulders, that even now at the end made Dean feel warm, this kid he’d taken care of since as far as he could remember, this man that he’d grown with until they made one creature stronger than they ever could have been apart. “This isn’t about him,” Sam said. “This is about
Azazel hmmed. “Point taken.” He put down his glass. “By the way, if you happen to run across any bright up and comers—a new generation of recruits—send them over. We could use all the men we can get on this.”
“Well, where are you working?” Dean asked.
"Alastair," he said. "You freaked me out. I thought you were asleep."
“Don’t pretend you care,” Uriel said. “We all know he was a dick to you.”
He tipped the sapling into the salted water and held them down. They thrashed in his grip.
“Well you’re sleeping with mine,” says Dean.
Cas put a hand on Dean’s stomach, concentrating for a moment before donning a look of surprise. “It looks like you’re already in your second trimester. That’s concerning.”

“I love you,” Dean said, just staring at them: staring like he might drink his fill if he could just stay here forever, as though the end would never come.
“…Right,” Dean sighed. They walked out into the living room, but as they passed the threshold, Dean redirected Cas to lean against the wall. They lingered there for a while, kissing again, until Dean broke for air, noticing the sunburst clock above Cas’ head.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I know that. I’m not saying I’m gonna charge up to them, waving my arms. What do they even
It’s okay, Dean tried to reassure himself. We’ve got everything we need. We’ll get Cas back. It worked for Nick, right?
He sucked bites into Alastair's hips, dropping to his knees and peering up at him, pulling the zipper down with his teeth. Alastair was into it, gazing back at him, urging him on. Dean didn't need the hand that cradled his head, thrusting his mouth deep around Alastair's cock as he hollowed his lips, but he used it to ground himself in the sensations; he was moaning, the sounds muffled, stopped in his throat. In and out precisely, barely giving Dean room to breathe until at last he choked on it and only then did Alastair come, salty and warm like new blood. He was here. He was here and Alastair was with him, and it didn't matter.
Dean laughed sharply. "Sure they are. C'mon, you said you'd spill."
“Not over the phone,” Cas said. “But he’s obviously having covert meetings in his office. Do you know how to plant a bug?”
… causes… trouble!”
"I can take you to it, if you want," Dean said.
The shadows lengthened, the daeva forming itself from pieces of nothingness; the swirling of feathers and the distainful horse's face glaring at her.
“Alastair, what the fuck is this?” he hissed under his breath, leaning in close. “You’re treating me like a fucking courtesan or something.”
Cas bent his head, and when he looked back at Dean there were tears in his eyes. “Dean, I was trying to save you from this,” he said.
Alastair nodded.
“You’ll see,” Alastair said. He was watching the glow on the horizon. The army was getting nearer.
When he’d finished vacuuming, Dean looked around and frowned. There was still dust on the bedside table. He went and got a duster, and started dusting around a photo of him and Cas. He picked up the photo next to it, one of him and Baby, and dusted under it. Then Dean picked up the photo of him and Cas and found to his surprise that there was a papaya behind it that
The cops smirked, as though Dean had just made their case.
"Nice improvisation," Alastair said with a chuckle.
"Why?" He asked suspiciously. But he glanced behind her, toward the library, because he already knew.
Cas' face was so near that Dean could track every minute shift in expression, could measure the upward curl of his lips as he smiled, even in the low dawn light. "Knowing that it could end is part of what makes existence meaningful. You taught me that." He looked away, his expression faltering. "I'm not sure that I should have told you, actually. It's not a secret, but Jack's hope was that the souls here would come to realize the truth on their own, as they explored and questioned heaven."
The man's gaze darted from Emanuel's hand, to Daphne and Viridius, then back to Emanuel. His mouth moved soundlessly, and then his arm came out in a stiff, lurching motion to shake Emanuel's hand.
Temperance took to the air, gaining elevation swiftly, moving out across the property in ever increasing circles. Prosper watched her for a moment, then put her attention on the ground where it belonged.
"You're talking about the date that wasn't." So they were actually disappointed about that.
That was what he would do. Tonight he would lay in bed beside her, and he would stay all night, no matter how strange it felt to stare up at the fan blades, turning and turning, his body an encumbrance, his mind a reverberating shell. It would make Daphne and Viridius very happy.
"Never underestimate the King of Hell, darling."
It had been a strange year. Maybe the strangest year of their life, and that was saying something. Prosper circled around to the back of the house where the lights from the street were lessened, sat and curled her tail around her legs and turned her focus skyward. She still hadn't worked out what to do with all this inert quiet. Ever since coming here, it felt as if she and Dean were caught in one long exhale, and once they breathed in again it would all come crashing down.
"Shut up!" His hand slammed down on the cabinet shelf as he turned to face her, making jars rattle and fall. "You got a real simple choice here, Prosper, you either stay here or you come with me, but either way you're gonna shut your damn mouth! You got that?" He glared at her, then turned back to the cabinet. "Now what's it gonna be?"
She'd be damned before she gave any indication that Evangeline had managed to hit a nerve. But the truth was, Evangeline had touched on Prosper's most central fear. Cas hadn't been all there, when they killed Dick Roman and got sucked into Purgatory. He hadn't wanted to fight anymore, had apparently been ready to let Hester pummel him to death rather than raise a hand to defend himself. Hopefully landing in Monsterland had shocked him out of it, although Prosper knew that was a terrible thing to hope for. But even if he had resigned himself to fighting again, Cas wasn't a killer, or at least, not the kind of killer that you had to become in order to thrive in Purgatory. He was a soldier; he could be ruthless, relentless, willing to die for a cause he believed in. But in Purgatory, you had to be willing to live, no matter what that made you.
"Mom, this is you living life at slow speed?" Jo asked with a snort. She turned to grin at Atticus, sitting perched on her shoulder, but he was peering around the room, his head twitching this way and that.
Castiel glanced around the room, allowing himself to absorb it, if not enjoy it, the patina of comfort and security that the bunker seemed to shine with. It was undoubtedly a side-effect of Sam and Dean's long habitation. The war room table was covered with Sam's neat handwriting, there was the faint smell of unwashed dishes emanating from the kitchen. Fridge-stale pizza and Dean's attempt at spaghetti. Gunpowder and aging book pages and soap and flesh. They were in every room, across every surface. "Should I..." He drifted off, gesturing behind him at the doorway that Dean and Prosper had disappeared through. "I'll go apologize to them."
"Or some big, bad boss demon," Dean said, looking back up at Flo. "But I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. 'Cause whoever it was, they want me out, and they're a lot stronger than you."
"You can really fix this?" Linda asked suspiciously, watching sharp-eyed as Kevin gave Cas his butchered hand.
"Don't be boring." He circled Emanuel's feet, rippling across the grass. Emanuel turned in place to follow him. "You and I both know you're not boring." Emanuel had no answer to give to that. He remained quiet and watched the lizard dæmon flow up the side of the car, coming to rest on the hood. "I'm cold," he said, apropos of nothing. "You should let me into that sweater."
"I need to apologize. To both of you, but especially to Dean and Prosper. What happened at the crypt -"
"This is wrong," Prosper said.
The man glanced briefly at the knife in his chest, then back up at Dean. There was nothing bland about his expression anymore; instead there was a strange intentness in his gaze, a deliberation of movement as he curled long fingers around the handle and pulled the knife free. He didn't look away from Dean as he dropped it to the floor; he didn't look away from Dean as his arm shot up to catch the iron bar that Bobby had tried to bring down on his head. He turned, controlled and unhurried, and touched two fingertips against Bobby's forehead.
"This tactless manipulation won't work, Mary Campbell. I can see your gamble clearly."
"Looks like a bomb went off," Temperance said, her head swiveling back and forth to take it all in.
Not Prosper. Not when all she had to do was look at that dæmon, that little silver cat that no one seemed to notice any longer. And why would they? It, like the human bodies these angels wore, was simply an extension of Castiel's power.
"What do you mean?"
"Nope," Dean answered cheerfully. "Let's go."
"You got somewhere you need to be?" Dean checked.
"How the - why - we can do that?"
And wasn't that something. The kid was just too good for this world. Any world, really.
," Temperance had said to them both.
"I - yeah, okay. Will do."
Something, they had to do something. Behind them, out of sight but not out of awareness, Prosper and Temperance were still working together, outnumbered, only capable of harrying the dæmons. If they somehow managed to get the upper hand, it could draw enough attention for Sam and Dean to act, to turn this around. But he couldn't count on that, and they were running out of time. The demon was walking up to Jimmy's daughter, kicking Paola away as she clawed at him. He was picking up an iron bar, Jimmy dragging himself after him.
"Yeah, well, fucking tough," Dean snapped, wheeling back around. "He doesn't get time, or am I the only one here who remembers Dick's plan to freaking eat people?" He jabbed a finger at the space in front of his feet, like the force of the gesture might be enough to pin an angel to the earth.  "I need him here and back in the game, now." Sam sighed and looked away, exchanging a tired glance with Temperance, so Dean turned on Prosper. "And what's your deal? Maybe if you had talked to him, I don't know, at all, then we could've convinced him to pull his head out of his ass."
"Whose do you think?" She snapped. Another wave of grace washed over them, pushing them once more against the house. "Inside, inside, inside," Clarimond chanted. "Michael said the safest place to be is near the nephilim. He'll automatically protect himself from harm, so you guys should be shielded too."
"Whatever you're planning on doing," Sam said quietly, "God will stop you, just like he did last time."
"Just - just gimme a second." He stood up and flipped his jeans open, kicking out of them as he walked to the sink, downing his lukewarm beer along the way. It didn't do a damn thing to slow the tight, jangling thoughts currently bouncing around his head, didn't even come near it. He dropped the empty beer bottle on the sink's edge and picked up his toothbrush; he had a nightly routine now, like some kind of suburban nine to fiver, ever since Mom had found out just how rarely he remembered to brush his teeth. Dean didn't know which had been worse, the half-horrified, half-amused stare that she had leveled at him, or the sight of Sammy's smug smirk from across the room as he listened in.
breathe. Prosper had been touched before, of course; demons delighted in breaking taboos, and seemed to get a particular rush from the violating act of touching, grabbing, hurting another person's dæmon. But that was different, that was the risk of the job, just one of the many dangers of the life of a hunter. But aside from that, no one had touched Prosper, there hadn't been anyone who they could have had that with, not even Cassie.
Dean turned a frustrated, terribly weary glare on her. He glanced at his dæmon, then at Emanuel. "Excuse us," he said, turning away. Then, more sharply, "Meg."
"If we can believe anything he said at all. Which we can't, because angels aren't real." They stared at each other, united.
"I guess," Prosper muttered. She turned toward him, propping her paws up on the back of the seat and resting her chin against his shoulder. "It was a good night, wasn't it?"
"I'm going to scout for a bit," Temper said.
Castiel reached between them, wrapped his hand around Dean's fingers where they were entangled in the fabric of his suit. Dean let go only reluctantly, his knuckles blanched white from the intensity of his grip. Castiel lowered his head to kiss his palm. He held it clasped between them as he kissed Dean's mouth again, as Dean allowed him to ease them both down onto the bed. Avaricious, he moved Dean's hand above his head simply for the hedonistic pleasure of observing the stretch of Dean's body, and when Dean smirked up at him and said, "Looking a little hungry there, Cas," Castiel felt perfectly justified in stopping his mouth with his own. Dean's free hand clamped down on Castiel's hip; he used this and his bent knee and the invitational splay of his body to urge Castiel down on top of him. It was entirely too much, this sudden glut of Dean, but Castiel wouldn't balk no matter how overwhelmed, not unless Dean or Prosper bid him stop. He pressed himself into Dean, pressed them both against the bed, his breath huffing out hard and unbidden when their hips came together, his hand, holding Dean's hand, sliding slowly up the bed as he stretched himself down and over Dean, sliding inadvertently under the pillow, bumping against something cold and metallic. A well of still, latent power.
"Are you alright?"
"Don't come then," he shot back, walking past her.
"We're making it up as we go," Castiel told the prophet Chuck, in a fit of recklessness.
"What'd they do this time?" Dean patted the spot beside him; he was sitting at the edge of the creek, cooling his feet off in the water. He had been taking a break from his newest project, building a car from scratch. No cheating allowed, other than getting a hold of the raw materials.
"No," Cas said curtly, already walking past them toward Kevin. He sat down in the spot that Dean had abandoned, half-lifting a hand and holding it out to Nomi. "May I?" He asked, rumbling and low, tires over gravel.
"No," Castiel cut in vehemently, his hands coming down heavy on the wheel. "I won't risk losing Dean's friendship." Constant didn't speak, and Castiel drew in a deep breath, his chest and shoulders rising and falling. "It's better this way, in any case. We have a mission. We can't afford distractions."
Now, nearly a year later, she stepped through it and out into the night.
"This is not a distraction, Castiel. This is important." It was the heart of every decision they made. Constant knew that Castiel wondered over it at times, how quickly and decisively a life dedicated to service and obedience to God had been turned on its head, how swiftly the Winchesters, and Dean and Prosper in particular, had become the sole weighted force in the universe worthy of circling. Castiel looked at him, his gaze troubled, then turned away.
"One way or another," he muttered in agreement, then lifted his chin in a nod as Sammy and Temperance approached. "They good?"
"What, Neosporin?"
"Dean and Sam Winchester," Michael said. He looked at Mary, expressionless in the way only angels could be. Like he couldn't be bothered to manipulate his facial muscles any more than he needed to in order to talk. "And Mary Campbell. This is unexpected." He stared at them, unmoving, incurious.
"But you
"What's going on?" Temperance asked, turning her head to one side, then the other.
"Well, they wouldn't be babies," Cas said. "But I happen to agree with you. Jack should be enjoying his youth, such as it is."
“I—I guess, yeah. Maybe I have,” Dean admitted, “but this wasn’t exactly what I had in mind! I’m a
Dean stepped through the portal, hefting his weapons, but a quick wind passed by him, and by the time he’d walked through the portal entirely, his weapons had vanished. Well, that’s not good, he thought. Maybe I could just grab Cas and run?
All of a sudden, as though it had just appeared. Cas was lying curled up while something that had his face rained down blow after blow, dotting Cas’s face with blood.
They hadn’t really had time to do things like watch movies together after they’d fixed things between them. Dean regretted a lot of things, but nothing had quite the same hollow ache of realizing he’d thrown away his and Cas’ last year together because he’d been angry, because it had made him feel better to lash out. They’d made up; but then with Chuck, and Jack, and Billie and the end of the world (again) they’d never really had a moment to sit down and catch their breath.
“Cas,” Dean stepped forward, as close as he could to the edge of the salt line. “Hang on, buddy, we’re getting you out of there.”
“What is it?”
“I can take some slices, if you want,” Dean said. His back prickled as Alastair’s gaze raked across him. The High Inquisitor generally left Dean to his own devices on the racks, these days; said he didn’t need hand-holding anymore. This unexpected visit made him wonder—had he heard about the free month Dean had gained from Bela? Did he want to punish Dean for it?
•The idea that Cas met Bela pre season 4, when on the way to rescue Dean in hell and gave her an angel blade is taken from the backstory of the fic
by orange_crushed. It's a short fic set during season 9 with Mark of Cain/demon Dean. Bela's the main character, & it follows her & Cas' travels through hell in order to find Dean, who has become king (& hates it).
Sam and Dean stood within the salt ring, the blood from Dean’s hand in the bowl by their feet. Sam threw a match onto Dean’s green jacket, which was carefully folded so that Cas’ bloody handprint was showing, and began to speak as the fire blazed.
“I told you I wasn’t going to leave you,” Dean said, taking hold of Cas and, pulling him to his feet, and focusing on the brightness of the portal. A single step took them back to the glowing line, which was already curling closed. But before they could step back out, the Shadow in the Empty was there too, holding a blade of darkness to Cas’ neck.
“Perfect,” Cas said.
"May your heart be eaten by maggots and your enemies spit on your face," Nanghait said.
“I’ll never understand the taste of your generation,” Dean said. “Whatever happened to the classics?”
Meanwhile, at home, Dean was going just about out of his mind. When he sneaked by Jack’s room to figure out what Jack and his bad influence of a friend were up to, he heard Belphagor say, “Ey, so you’re dad’s like… really hot.”
. The serpent seemed to roll toward itself like a hundred ball bearings, breaking apart as it did, and then it was something humanoid, covering its body with three pairs of wings; it was so tall that its head, before it bent down to her, hidden by the top pair of wings, almost reached the battle above. But it did bend down, almost kneeling, and then two hands were grasping her head, and the wings covering its face opened; the eyes, on a smooth, masklike humanoid face, were staring into her.
Anna grabbed a hairpin from her hair. “We can pick the lock with this, right?” she asked.
Well, except the honeydew on the chair next to him.
“All the signing papers?”
We're kind of busy at the moment so we might not get the next chapter posted by next week, but it's planned out and we're super excited for what we've got in store... :)
"Yes sir."
The entry of a phalanx of angels into Hell was met with screams and cries, of course. A straggle of Hell’s foot-soldiers were wiped away by a subatomic blast with barely a thought. The noise of the angels’ footsteps shook the ground for miles, and the beat of their wings drew the air taut like a thread. From his private penthouse in the city of Dis, the High Inquisitor could see the consistent glimmer of their passing on the horizon, lighting up the accustomed endless night like a blood-red dawn. They were coming closer, inexorably.
But Cas must have. He must have come here alone, sometime when the two weren’t speaking, maybe when things were falling apart between them, and put on the movie that made him remember what was so worth saving about the world.
“We made some progress,” Cas said. “Now we just have to wait and see.”
Then, like a streak of lightning, something hollow rose in those empty tunnels, like a ponderous creature rising from the sea, blind and unaccustomed to the light. Something hollow, crippled—but there. “Fine,” Chuck said, harshly. “You know what? Fine. But you’d better make it good, Winchesters.” He snapped his fingers.
It was an idle fantasy, but it made his heart pound, his hands shake. He would wake hard as a rock in his pants, and half the time Alastair would be there, standing in front of him, his pearl eyes drinking in the sweat across his collarbone—and before Dean could move, Alastair would be stepping forward, kneeling in front of him and pushing his mouth into a bruising kiss that Dean returned in a frenzy, still lost and half asleep, half out of his mind from lust.
At that moment Azazel came outside, looked down at the scene and muttered to himself, “what a dump,” before walking away.

“Cas, come on…”
“No, I don’t suppose you will,” said Uriel.
Miracle was licking Dean’s face. It was still 11:00, so technically morning. Dean was grinning.
“Yeah, Cas, and I was trying to save you,” Dean said.
(See the end of the chapter for
The water ran clearer here than it did near the torture chambers. Looking over the side, Dean could see the sandy bottom of the river, with a small, dark speck that he realized was the boat’s shadow. Fish with lantern jaws swam by, pasty and blind; seaweed twisted like mermaid’s hair. Actually—no, wait, that was a mermaid. Dean leaned back a little, disturbed by the eager smile on her razor teeth and the calculating expression she had, like she was wondering whether it would be worth it to pull them in.
than just friends,” Dean said. “I’m gonna go check on them,” he announced, marching toward the stairs.
“I don’t
Cas accepted the book and stuck it into one of his trenchcoat pockets. He pecked Dean on the cheek and smiled. “I’ll be home for dinner,” he promised.
"I was, before the light show," Alastair said drily.
“Dean. You were talking about Crowley.”
“Cas,” Bela said, rolling it off her tongue. “Cas
“Hold it together, dear,” Cas said smugly.
While Dean is doing research for a case that Garth is working on, Jody calls.
There’s a long pause before Dean cuts it with, “Well, that answers one question.”
“You’re right, Sam. You don’t get it,” is all Dean says.
Bucky keeps looking at Dean. “I met Sam once. Nice guy.”
“Cas,” Dean whispers.
A loud crack cut Dean off, then his other self disappeared out of existence. He looked around the kitchen warily, as if something dramatic was about to happen. Instead, a phone once again began ringing in the library.
They both sighed with relief and moved together effortlessly, a slow shift of hips as Cas pumped Dean’s cock and sucked kisses into his neck.
Dean swung an iron rod through it, and the ghost disappeared.
Cas says, “Yes, but I don’t know why she would set up a barrier between—”
Dean sits in the emptiness for at least a minute. Then, on impulse, he drops his tone of voice and says, “Billie?”
“This looks worn. Somebody give it to you?” Sam interrupted, flipping the book in his hands and checking the page where Dean left a bookmark.
Dean got lost in thought for a minute, trying to figure out where in his schedule he could fit Charlie. He definitely wanted to hang out with her outside of work.
“Look, it sounds like it was crazy, and I know you’re still trying to process it, but everything you just described sounds a lot better than what I expected from Amara,” Sam says, totally calm. “It’s better than the infection, right? Creation is better than destruction, you know? And now we have a lead.”
“I don’t—”
[eyebrow raised emoji]
“No, no, Cas, you need to rest. I’m just—fucking pissed at our situation, but it’s fine.”
“Yeah, uh.” Sam sighs and throws a hand up. “We’re not totally sure how we feel about it, you know, never really planned on…”
“Hey,” she said sweetly, ushering him into the kitchen. “My husband’s at the store, so we have a few minutes.”
“What’s your favorite genre?”
“She feeds on souls,” Billie continues. “I don’t know what else she does, but I know death. And there are a lot of people dying soulless.”
He shifts and feels Cas’ heavy arm draped across his back, his chubby hip squished against his side. Dean shuffles and turns, picking Cas’ arm up and kissing his hand before setting it on the bed and standing up.
lighting up in his brain, and he is at once nearing middle age and 4 years old simultaneously, and he aches with longing for the years he lost in between. He kisses her temple and avoids eye contact when she lets go.
She doesn’t answer.
“I’m thinking, like, Tom Cruise’s typical length? Or like Brad Pitt in
Not that it’s even necessary at all, but Cas still runs his hand through Dean’s stubble and kisses him right on the lips right there in the doorway.
“That wasn’t Charlie, silly.”
“How do you feel?”
Dean blinked at him. “Whoa, sorry. I didn’t mean to make you defensive, I was just joking around.”
