Hopefully, you'll still like it. I should have the last two chapters ready soon, and I have a couple notes for a possible sequel (because of course my brain can't leave well enough alone, and also I can't just finish my five billion other WIPs, nooo, it's apparently time for something (semi-) new). So. We'll see how it goes.
“I would tell you that I was born ready,” Cas commented as Dean pulled out his fingers and slicked up his cock, “but technically, I was never born.”
Sometimes, before Michael, Cas had fucked him fast and hard, rough and dirty like their years on the road and the sheets in all those dingy motels, as if to let out all the frustration and desperation that had build up over the almost-decade of them dancing around each other. But other times, like today, he was just so
Cas sighed.
It barely took a minute before the Prince's chest was rising and falling in a barely perceptible, but steady beat. Dean waited a few minutes, giving the oil time to work its way into his skin, then he pulled a blanket over the sleeping Prince.
to, if you really don't wanna.” Dean gave him his best puppy eyes. He was nowhere near as good as Sam or Jack, of course, but it seemed to do the trick.
“Yeah. My baby brother.” Dean smiled, thinking about how Sam had long since outgrown him. If anyone asked, he was annoyed about it. But mostly, he was proud of the kid.
She shook her head. “Alright, then let's talk about your little adventures in the Harem instead.”
Meg rolled her eyes and grabbed his wrist. “Come on let's go to your rooms, we can hold our little meeting there. Besides, you need a bath. And a comb, not that that helps much with your hair. I've never seen you unshaven before, but I think I like it. Do put on some new clothes though, these are all wrinkled and probably stained.” She smirked.
Dean squirmed a little in his arms. “Figured a human wouldn't have been much help. At least not as much as the King of Hell.”
“Mh,” Dean made, letting out a happy sigh when Castiel settled back into bed, his arms immediately full of sleepy hunter.
Noticing Dean's fixation on the screen, Cas turned in his seat to figure out what was keeping his interest, but the news lady had already moved on to another topic, the singer or whatever they were.
“What- what would that mean?” Dean asked, seeming nervous.
“See? It's perfect. Now, not that this place doesn't spark fond memories, but we really should get going.” Gabriel took a step forwards, but Dean and Cas were still standing in his way.
“Apples, pears...” Prince Gabriel rolled his eyes at him.
Dean blushed, ducking his head. He really should have expected Cas to get sappy right in some greasy burger joint in the middle of bumfuck, Kansas.
“Thanks Cas.”
“Angry? Why?”
That was silly, of course. He was still part of the Harem, and was expected to please whoever took a fancy to him, as long as they didn't ask for anything too weird.
“What's wrong with my old clothes?” Dean grumbled, pulling Castiel from his musing. He turned in the chair, in which he had taken position at Dean's reading table. It wasn't the first time Dean made this argument, if it could even be called that, and Castiel had a feeling that it wouldn't be the last time.
“Hey, kid,” Dean said as they hugged, a little awkwardly, “good to see you.”
Dean grabbed the bag from him, silencing him with a glare. Then he made sure to push the bottle of lube to the very bottom of the bag, under what he now saw were carefully wrapped Christmas presents. “We'll get this to the car first,” he muttered.
While they kissed, Cas started stroking them even harder, and Dean felt the urge the move his hips in rhythm, but managed to stop himself. “Cas, fuck, stop,” he pressed out, and Cas' hand stilled, then fell away from their cocks.
Cas smiled shyly. “Still smoking hot?”
“Oh?” She eyed him critically, “Am I to assume that these influences are of magical nature? I can't exactly cure him of running with the wrong crowd.” She sipped her tea thoughtfully. “Unless we're talking about mind control spells, but I don't believe we are.”
“You're not keeping me. But I-” Castiel sighed. “I'm afraid I'm getting rather greedy.”
Instead of answering right away, Dean took a few seconds to check his own body. No pain, as far as he could tell. “Michael?” he heard himself ask.
“Sorry, I kinda held Lily up,” Dean said, and the person turned to him, revealing a face framed by a well-trimmed beard. As they moved, he also saw a patch of dough spread out on a worktop behind them.
“Yeah, it's only my third day, really. But, uh, about those pies...”
Shaking his head, Dean gestured for Cas to get up. “And you wanna snag the cookies and eggnog before the kid wakes up, so he'll think... you know you'll just be feeding this idea of his, right?”
“Your highness,” Hester called back, frowning as she stepped into the room. The High Enchantress MacLeod was nowhere to be seen.
“What do you think?” Sam whispered to him.
“No, I- it's true, my princess.” Dean bowed again, just so she couldn't see him frown.
“Fuck,” Dean hissed, unable to stop himself from leaning back down to ravage his mouth. Damn this literal angel and his ability to turn even sex into a sap fest. “What- what part of me do you love?”
A small smile appeared on Castiel's face at how grumpy Dean sounded, as if the thought of Castiel clothed was disappointing. Slipping out of everything but his underwear, Castiel said: “Jack is asleep in the War Room. I'm afraid his neck will be stiff tomorrow, though maybe he won't be affected, considering who he is.”
Cas smiled when Dean stepped next to him with his present, leaning in to watch as Dean opened it. At first, Dean tried to be careful, not to damage the paper, but soon there was a tear, and then all bets were off. When the ripped paper fell to the floor to be ignored, Dean stared at the Kurt Vonnegut novels in his hands.
Dean smiled. “You're not mad if I call you that?”
“The others are waiting for us. For their stuff,” Dean argued, but it was a weak protest.
“Cool. One more question before you run off to do your Chief-thing,” Dean said. “Is it always wolves and vamps? Those are the ones I heard about, but are there any other spiced up monsters we know about?”
“Well, then I will address any and all complaints about why the pies are missing from everyone's tea parties to you.”
“Or...?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows and Cas leaned in to kiss him. It was a little sloppy at first because they were both smiling, but after a while, they managed to get it right and Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' lower back to pull him closer while one of Cas' hands came up on his shoulder, the other hand still caressing Dean's face.
“You don't have to do that.”
“Good morning, everyone.” Prince Gabriel bounced his eyebrows up and down while everyone bowed to him.
Cas looked down at himself pointedly, raising his hips a little. “Partly. I thought that was the point of the whole exercise.” Dean opened his mouth, then closed it again. “What?”
Sam let out a sound between a scoff and a laugh, probably wondering what a proper Christmas was even like, considering they had never really had one. But before he could say so, Dean said: “Yeah, a proper Christmas would be nice, wouldn't it, Sammy?”
“Yes to the city,” Castiel said, taking a sip of his tea. “The Academy is a more difficult matter. They're not very fond of visitors, even nobles, if they're not inclined to join. But if you were thinking about seeing Sam, you could simply invite him here. I'm sure he gets some time off during the weekends, right?”
“Dude, we're gonna pick up a shit ton of stuff. And probably a tree, too,” Dean told him, glancing at the people who were talking vividly about their plans for Christmas. Their first Christmas without Michael. “And I am not getting needles all over Baby. Or scratches on her roof.”
“Nope.” Dean rubbed his stomach. “I kinda overdid it with the pie, to be honest. But I could eat again now.”
“Surely, there are other ways to... Apologies. But I'm sure that with your looks you would have no problem working... you know, in the city.”
“How do you feel, my Prince?”
After a few beats of silence, Castiel said softly: “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to turn this into an interrogation.”
Cas looked down at the champagne thoughtfully. “It's... unfamiliar. Not bad, but a little weird.” He had had trouble finding out what he liked and what he didn't these past few days, the whole experience being somewhat overwhelming even though he had gone through it once before. But back then, he had eaten mostly to keep off the hunger, not because it tasted good. Dean still felt bad about that, and he supposed he always would.
“Hm,” Castiel made. “And what are your plans for the evening?”
Castiel smiled in amusement. “I'll tell the guards to be watchful.”
“I believe it's starting.” Cas pointed to the sky, and Dean saw a first rocket go up, then burst into a vibrant red. More rockets followed, and some glowing things that painted shapes into the dark, probably controlled by magic.
“Treating me like a normal person. As far as possible, at least.” Castiel sighed, closing his eyes. “Sometimes it really does feel like everyone expects me to be some kind of demi-god, like I can snap my fingers and solve any and all problems, just like that.”
to tell the world that he, Dean Winchester, was in love with, and being loved by, Castiel, badass angel of the Lord.
“Get to know him!” she screamed. “Why would I want to get to know this- this commoner! Castiel, I know you have too soft a heart despite your pretences, but this is going too far. What are the people going to think?”
They didn't have sex that night, but they drank a lot of wine and made out, Cas pressing kisses like apologies into Dean's skin, mumbling about how sorry he was and about how Dean deserved so much better.
Castiel put a hand on his arm, the first time he had deliberately touched him. “You're going to make yourself bleed.”
Sam and Eileen were a little off from the crowd, sitting on the hood of Eileen's car, signing animatedly. In moments like this, with his face practically glowing from how big his smile was, Sam looked young again, more like when Dean had picked him up in Stanford all those years ago than like a thirty-five year old hunter who had battled demons and archangels and won.
“Then sleep.” Dean got off the bed, righting his robe where it had been displaced by his efforts, and studied the heap of deliciousness currently occupying his bed. It would be a shame not to sleep with him, but he also wouldn't push him. If the Prince wanted him, he would say so, and currently all he wanted seemed to be some rest.
It took Dean a while to fall back asleep, but when he did, Cas' hand was still gently rubbing his back.
“Oh, I see. It's an expression. Like with the guinea pig.”
“Gabriel,” Cas said, and yeah, okay, if he said this was really his brother, Dean would take it.
“Our situation is different, though, isn't it? For one, we're not even the same species. Secondly, I'm almost certain Eileen never told Sam that he is like a brother to her. And-”
“Oh?” Gabriel looked between the two. “I see you have developed a preference. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find someone else for you. There are these two very sexy-”
“I'm an angel, Dean, and it's only natural that they would harbour some reservations against my species given the occurrences in their world.”
“My sincerest apologies. My uncle Zachariah can be a bit... traditional.”
“It's... I did this, Cas, with my hands, I-”
Castiel just nodded. “I know. But our –
Dean hummed. “Because you think it's funny?”
Of course anyone who knew Cas wouldn't have been surprised. After all, Cas didn't sleep. But the lady didn't know that, and Cas didn't have to go out of his way to point out that really, there was no necessity for two, no, not at all, one bed would suffice completely, thank you very much. And then the lady wished them a good night and freaking winked at Dean. He felt like dying. If Billie had turned up that exact second, he might have gone with her willingly.
“Why wouldn't it be? I mean, any more than from any other guy here.”
No effect on an angel, no. But if he had already given up his grace, if he was already human, already retired... Dean barely noticed how Cas led him out of the warehouse, or drove him back to the motel.
“I'm not exactly a reward,” Cas said as Dean left a trail of kisses down to his neck. “But yes, you can have me. Anytime.”
Everyone could see that they were twins. Dean didn't know them very well, but he had seen them work, and it was almost inspiring how good they were. Of course he hadn't seen them have sex, but the way they smiled and behaved around the guests was benign, as if they really enjoyed every second of it.
Oh look, more characters. And sexy times (pretty short again - it's kind of in the middle of the second to last part and there's something pretty significant afterwards, so look out for that).
Except he wouldn't have, because despite the embarrassment, he was actually looking very much forward to what was about to happen. Or what he hoped would happen.
“Fine,” Cas grumbled. “But I will not wear them in public.”
“Tell me about them,” Castiel said.
Cas rolled his eyes dramatically, and Dean stole another one of his fries. Life was good.
“Next thing we know, you'll be yelling at kids to get off your lawn.”
Claire grinned. “Yeah, whatever. I guess I am happy for you assholes.” Then she walked off, leaving behind a completely duped Dean and a still smiling Castiel.
Dean stared at him, dumbfounded that he thought that Dean could be the one to hurt Cas' feelings instead of the other way around. “Okay.”
After a few seconds of silence, Cas nodded. “You're right. Let's call Sam to tell him we're on this.”
“I love you,” Cas said when they broke the kiss, and he smiled down at Dean softly.
Dean grabbed the bag from him, silencing him with a glare. Then he made sure to push the bottle of lube to the very bottom of the bag, under what he now saw were carefully wrapped Christmas presents. “We'll get this to the car first,” he muttered.
. God. Dean didn't deserve him, didn't deserve any of this, and he felt his tear ducts acting up again when Cas pressed gentle kisses to his throat.
“Jack okay?” Dean asked when Castiel sat down on the bed, and he felt a hand reaching for him, grabbing the suit jacket. “Take that off.”
“We should retire,” Dean suddenly blurted out.
“Yes.” Cas sounded sad. “I know that means that I will... I can still fight as a human, Dean. Admittedly, I might need some time to get used to it again and to be able to fight without my powers, but-”
“There is a lot of important work to be done.” Cas stepped up to him slowly, as if wanting to give him a chance to withdraw. Gently, he took Dean's hands in his. “But you are also important. What did Hester say to you? Was she terribly unkind?”
After a moment, Michael nodded. “I will make no statement against you in this regard. Though you may also not expect my encouragement.”
There was something scary about all this, about the prospect of his life changing so drastically. Not that he didn't want that, hell, he had wanted it for a while, but now that it was becoming more tangible, it was actually within reach, Dean found himself afraid of the implications. He didn't know how to live a normal life, without monsters, or... or with garden parties or whatever. He had tried that with Lisa, all those years back, and how had that ended? Well, it had ended with Sam coming back, but even before that, Dean hadn't been able to keep his hunter instincts at bay, to stow the paranoia whenever a floor tile creaked. Not completely.
Right. He hadn't had lunch yet. Looking around in the room, he didn't see any way to get or make food, no lever that might magically produce something edible, so eventually he stepped out into the corridor.
“You too, your highness.”
Dean thought that Gabriel was exaggerating. After all, Cas was often wide-eyed, an open, honest look was pretty much his trademark. Then Dean thought back to the first time they had met each other, and started wondering.
Castiel smiled at him. “That's why I'm here, isn't it?”
“Greedy?” Dean stared down at the Prince, who was still just lying on his bed, arms crossed under his head.
“Are you sure you're alright?” Cas frowned as he stepped into the room, letting the door fall shut behind him.
Castiel let out a relieved sigh. “That's more than enough for me.”
Dean let out a long sigh, then stretched and slowly sat up. “Ask me wha'?” he asked, blinking lazily. He was so beautiful that it made Castiel's heart ache.
“I was thinking of a warning system. Some sort of heads up if she gets close. Alas, I fear the High Enchantress would expect quite the fee for that sort of thing, if it is even possible.”
Castiel gritted his teeth. “There may not even be anything to think through. I'm not sure... I haven't even spoken to him about it yet. He may decline.”
“Yeah, I'm... Hey, listen.” Dean might not have a great track record with talking about his feelings, but the last time he had really done it, it had gotten him a relationship with a freaking angel. So why not try and be a little more open again. “There's something I've been... meaning to... You know, I...” Okay, just because he had decided to try didn't mean he actually knew how to do it.
It might be different with Cas, of course. He wouldn't have to hide any of his suspicions. Cas knew as well as him that a monster might live just next door or break into the house at any minute, and chances were that he would keep his angel blade at the ready, even as a human. Cas was a warrior. He'd been a soldier. He would understand.
“What? No. I like you more, anyway.”
liked this.
“Are you gonna have me punished?”
“Uh, yeah. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause trouble.” Dean grinned crookedly. “I just smelled the best thing ever and saw the pies outside, and I wondered if I could maybe have one?”
He just wasn't sure yet what that was.
“I- what?” Dean asked.
Hester's glare could have melted solid steel bars. “Check him again.”
“Oh. But it was really fun to watch.”
“Did you hold anything back that I would need to know?”
He felt a little guilty. Maybe Dean actually wanted to go with Gabriel. Though he was smiling at Castiel again.
Chuckling to himself, Dean made his way over to the guy and said: “Uh, hey. Thomas, right?” Then he held out the book that was wrapped in a plastic bag. “Listen, we weren't sure if this is a present for someone or not, so just in case we didn't wanna put it on display.”
“I do think some of the things in there are anatomically implausible,” Cas said later, while they were lying in bed. “But others seemed rather intriguing. Perhaps we could try them sometime.”
“Yes, you will.” Castiel took the time to press a kiss to Dean's hair while he tied his shoes. Then he quickly left the room.
“Shut up and let me have him.”
“Yeah, you should have.” But the venom had left his voice, his anger deflated at Cas' admission. “I mean, I still would've blamed myself, but at least I'd have been prepared, ya know?”
Castiel blinked. Yes, he remembered. The dry throat, that parched feeling – it was thirst.
“Right. Since Michael's death, not much has changed, but then not all of them seem to even know that he's gone. It's only been a couple of days, after all.” Sam sighed again, but more in relief than in exasperation this time. “Maybe once they get the info, they'll go back to being more careful, but we can't say that for sure yet.”
“Alright, grumpy, we'll get up. What time is it anyway?” Dean didn't wait for an answer, reaching for his alarm clock. Eight in the morning. Huh. “You let me sleep in.”
“I should leave.” They had talked for a while, but had lapsed into silence a couple of minutes ago.
“In bed?”
“Okay, okay. Now we don't have enough Kleenex in the bunker for all of you, so...”
“What is it?” Dean asked, turning around to see if anyone had entered the room. But there was nothing, no one was even close to the door.
Castiel wondered if said visitor had an appointment, or if she knew they would come by through magical means.
“Don't laugh.” Cas sounded embarrassed, so Dean kept back any witty comments and promised as much. “I'd just like to know what it is like to wake up with you in my arms.”
Kind of a convoluted way of saying 'too much information', but Dean could certainly relate with the sentiment.
“It's exhausting, trying to be perfect all the time.” Dean thought about his childhood for a moment, then realized he had been staring off into empty space. Prince Castiel was looking at him curiously. Dean picked at his toe harder. “I'm sure I cannot even imagine how big the expectations are for a Prince.”
Maybe he could ask Charlie, probe her for advice, but then he would have to explain why he needed info on coming out as queer and, well. That was the exact same problem all over again. And this was the apocalypse world Charlie, not his Charlie. He barely knew her.
“I suppose. And yet, we are usually surrounded by other people and are required to hold up appearances.” Castiel sighed. “This must seem ridiculous to you. A Prince complaining about having to be a Prince.”
And an angel, who was currently holding two cups of coffee and scanning the room for the best available seats. When their eyes met, Dean motioned with his head towards a table at the window front, and they took off in that direction, with Dean getting there first and claiming his preferred seat: With his back to the wall, and the whole room in his sight, including the breakfast buffet and the TV above it, which was set to a local news channel. It was muted, but the headlines were scrolling through at the bottom, even though it took some effort to read them from this distance.
Prince Castiel nodded, turning to him with a grave expression. “Apologies. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.”
“My apologies. I just didn't immediately recognize you as... nobility,” they said, their eyes flicking up and down Dean's body, or maybe his clothes.
The next morning, Dean shovelled bacon and eggs onto his plate in the motel breakfast room while Cas got them coffee. There were few people in the room, but somehow the backdrop of the conversations around him was still a relief to Dean. You would think that with someone else in your head, it would never be quiet, but instead the silence had been deafening at times while Michael was in charge, so this was a nice change of pace. Another reminder that he was back again, among humans.
Dean sat next to him on the bed when he was done, fascinated by the oil glistening on the Prince's strong body. He thought Castiel might have fallen asleep again, but then he suddenly turned his head.
“Yes. I fear that if we do not do something, and soon... Heaven may shut down.”
Libraries? Plural? Gods, the palace must have been even bigger and fancier than Dean had imagined from what little he had seen of it so far.
“It's okay, Dean. It's not your fault.”
“And what?” Dean prompted him gently, his thumb trailing over Cas' skin soothingly.
Cas kneeled in front of the bed, between Dean's legs, putting a hand on his knee. “I'm sorry. We thought it would be better if you... you have a tendency to blame yourself for things that you are not responsible for and-”
Of course, they had had sex that one time, but Castiel didn't think much about it. He didn't desire her and she seemed happy to play around with whoever most took her fancy on any given day, so he wasn't worried that this might complicate their relationship.
“Oh, hells yes.” Dean grinned, shuffling a little closer. “Is that what you want? Did you wake up horny today?”
“Your-” Dean knew about Royal Companions, of course. They were the unmarried partners of members of the Royal Family. “That's like... a boyfriend of a prince, right?”
“We're right there.” Dean gestured with his hand towards what he thought was north, not quiet sure why they were even discussing this. They could already be on their way to gut the thing.
“Hm?” Cas made absent-mindedly, running his hand through the short hair on the back of Dean's neck.
But he had been wondering about this Heaven stuff for days now and he thought that if he knew the plan, he could either keep Cas from doing it or at least help him. Anything was better than have Cas go off on his own, like he usually did when he was on a 'mission'.
The last part sounded bitter, and Dean couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy despite Cas' assurances that he was more important. “We'll find a way, Cas,” he said quietly. “We always do.”
In turn, Prince Castiel put a hand over his face. “Gabriel, please.”
After a few beats of silence, Prince Castiel said: “I don't know what I'm doing here.” He sounded nervous, and wasn't that something? Apparently Dean could make a Prince nervous, simply by being in the same room with him. Huh.
When Cas had fucked him before, Dean had revelled in how strong he was, how easily he could manhandle him. It had been a fucking turn on, even if he would never admit that out loud. But right now, that same display of strength made Dean's stomach churn and he had trouble putting on a smile. It must have shown, because Cas frowned down at him.
“It's good-” more sniffing “-to see you, too, Dean.”
The High Enchantress' expression didn't change, but her eyes were sparkling and she leaned forward a little. “Oh my. Tell me all about it.”
Castiel stayed again that night, spooning Dean from behind. When morning came, he blinked against the light filtering through the curtains, revelling in the feeling of holding Dean in his arms. Then he remembered that he had a meeting at nine and the sun was already up.
Cas sighed. “I can't. At least I don't know any way to... There might be something I can do, but it wouldn't help much in the long run. Besides, Heaven is not my top priority right now.”
Things (finally) get serious.
“I just don't want you to regret it.” Something flickered over Dean's face that might have been fear or hurt, and Castiel squeezed his hand again.
“Yes.” Cas laughed darkly. “Though honestly, for being immortal, all angels seem to do lately is dying. I mean, I've died before. Several times. It isn't exactly a new concept for me.”
“He's not a thing, Hester, and yes, he is the one I chose.” Castiel straightened his back. “I'll not hear a bad word about him.”
He didn't bother putting it on the table, instead opting to sit on the bed as he ate. The meat was amazing, tender and succulent, and even though he didn't like vegetables very much, the peas and mashed potatoes also tasted great with the dark sauce that covered them. He tasted all the other stuff, ate most of it, then finally got to the pie.
Once again, Dean wanted to chastise him, ask him if he didn't know how much time it took to make a freaking mixtape, until he realized that of course he didn't. And he shouldn't. Because no way was he going to tell Cas how much time he had invested to make that first mixtape for him. How long he had brooded over the song selection to begin with, reconsidering over and over again. At first he had wanted to make a Led Zeppelin tape for Cas, and had written down the songs he thought Cas should hear, but that had quickly turned into a selection of love songs, and Dean had found himself thinking of adding stuff from other artists where he thought the lyrics fit. That list should still be in his drawer somewhere, probably at the very bottom where he had stuffed it in embarrassment only to start over again from scratch. At the time, he had been too much of a chicken to give Cas something that packed with emotions, so instead he had settled on compiling his Top 13 Led Zeppelin songs, his mom's voice rattling around in his brain: “...
Great. Apparently, Dean's brain was working overtime and it was currently busy convincing him that Cas didn't want to sleep with him. Maybe he should shut the whole thing down. Hadn't they bought like a few gallons of eggnog or something?
“I'm sorry,” Castiel wheezed, wiping his eyes. “It's just... no one has ever said that to me. Hah!” His body was still constricting with laughter, though he managed to keep it silent. “I have been told many things, been praised by countless people, but that was never in anyone's repertoire.”
About ten minutes into the drive, Cas suddenly said: “You know, if you don't think the set-up is worth it for just one tape, you'll just have to make me another one.”
“Yeah. Yes, of course.” Dean still had a far off look on his face, but he let Castiel kiss him and even smiled afterwards.
“What guinea pig?” Dean asked, slowly coming back to consciousness.
“Yeah. That's the plan,” Dean agreed with a smile.
“Apologies, my Prince.”
“I believe Eileen is currently taking care of that,” Castiel told him, stroking his fingers through Dean's hair. “So you're not... it's not the gift?”
“Well, I was thinking about getting with a few of these lovelies.” Gabriel touched the cheek of one of the women. “If you don't need Dean, I was planning on taking him too. The more, the merrier.” Gabriel's grin faltered at the look on Castiel's face. “What's up, Cassie? Someone piss in your dinner?”
“Tell me every dirty detail.” Meg's grin just grew in size as Castiel groaned.
“Aye, my boy. That is how the Great Goddess intended it.” Rowena sauntered off down the hallway, and Charlie followed her with a shrug.
Michael held up a hand to stop him. “Did you come here to get my blessing for your... whatever he is to you?”
Castiel touched his cheek gently. “Dean. I'm not sure how much Sam's tuition and living expenses are, but if you can pay them with your wages here, I'm sure I'll be able to afford it tenfold. That sounds like a brag. It's not supposed to be a brag, but, you know, I am a prince.” He shrugged.
“Uh. Don't... don't mind me,” Prince Castiel said to the room at large, his voice firm and loud enough to carry to every last alcove. And yet, he seemed nervous.
“And you don't mind that I got you instead of him?” The prince seemed nervous.
to kiss him in the middle of the grocery store while they were arguing over what cereal to get, he
“Dean?” he asked again, and Dean glanced at him, only to look away again a second later, his lips a thin line. “Are you alright?”
“At least one of us is already getting used to it,” Michael said wryly when Castiel walked away.
“Then we don't do that,” Cas eventually said.
Slowly, Cas' hand wandered from Dean's knee to his back, and he allowed Cas to shuffle closer until his head was against Dean's belly. He put his own hand on the back of Cas' head without really meaning to, played with his hair.
“Yeah, I guess. Lots of magic involved.” Dean smiled. “Are you done working?”
Dean's mouth fell open, but no words came out, and he closed it again, gulping.
“Yeah. Guess I've been wondering.”
He got about halfway with pulling the bottle out of the bag before Dean frantically pushed it back in, his face burning. “Don't take that out here,” he hissed, glancing around to check if anyone had seen. But no one paid any attention to them.
“Can't you delegate it?” Dean was starting to think that everyone was just dumping their work on Castiel. What the hells.
“It's afternoon, Gabriel,” the person behind him said. Dean hadn't paid any attention to them when they'd entered, thinking they may be a visiting royal from another land or a noble person, but if they were addressing the Prince without his title, they must be a lot closer to him than Dean thought.
Eileen smirked at that. “Playing Santa?”
Cas chuckled as he reached for him, putting a hand on Dean's cheek. “No. It was a rather weak prayer and might not even have reached Heaven. But even if it did, it was directed at me specifically, so no other angel would hear it.”
He didn't know he had been looking for his brother until he stood next to his table.
“You-” Dean cleared his throat, turning back to Claire. “You happy now?”
“It's okay,” Dean said, clearing his throat. “What's up, buddy?”
“Well, then you better have a damned good reason to be in the kitchens and to harass my colleague,” they said, crossing their arms in front of their chest. When Dean scratched at his face, their eyes fell onto his wristband and they shifted uncomfortably. “I mean. Your highness.” They bowed, clearly displeased.
Dean smiled into his glass. “Maybe I could be convinced.”
At last, his uncle looked equally shocked as Cas had before. “You- you have no right to-” he stuttered.
“Yes,” Cas replied grimly. “I'm entirely sure, since I'm the one who killed him.”
He tried to walk evenly towards the table, but feared it came off rather aggressive.
“Oh, Cas, Cascascas-” Dean moaned, riding down onto his fingers without shame. “Please.”
Dean blinked at him. He had never received a request before. He had been chosen, wanted, but he had never been asked since he started working here. Of course, a Prince's request was as good as an order, but still.
They made out like that for a while, then got out of their clothes slowly, taking their time. Cas kept kissing Dean's body softly, like it was something to be cherished, like having Dean this way was precious, not just a quick way to get off. Sometimes – often – Dean couldn't handle that, couldn't wrap his head around being treasured this way. Being loved.
“What?”
“Castiel,” they said, transporting down from the structure to stand in front of them. “And your... human friend.”
“He's dead.” Cas' eyes turned hard for a second, then became soft again, and he was still holding Dean's hand, neither of them making a move to change that.
“Right,” Castiel said after a beat, looking gloomy. “There never seems to be an end to work. And then there's all that Gabriel is supposed to do.” He shook his head.
Dean felt his expression soften and he pulled Cas to his feet by his hands. “You old sap. Okay, we'll get up early and empty the plate so Jack will think Santa was there. But I bet Jack is still awake and waiting, anyway, so if we go now, he'll see that it was us.”
Dean sighed, reclining further back into the cushions. He didn't usually mind working in the Royal Harem, but on some days, when there was nothing but idle chit chat to entertain them, it was dreadfully boring.
“Oh.” Castiel seemed thoughtful. “I realize I have no idea what life in the city costs.”
Dean beamed at him, sliding their fingers together. “It's different though, right? I mean, Gabriel's not anyone's companion.”
Cas decided to bite and then suck at his chest. “Yes, sweetheart. Come for me.”
“I am not drunk, but you certainly seem to be. How could you let your common sense fly out of the window like that,” the guy bellowed. He was considerably smaller than Cas and didn't bear any resemblance to him. If he was his uncle, then he must be the King's brother, though, Dean realized with a start.
“Well, everyone except me, apparently. I mean, I knew there was something going on, but...” He put all of Cas' clothes onto a chair. “Didn't know they were at that stage yet. Guess I was kinda distracted.”
“Uh,” he made, looking at the guards outside the door, one next to his room, the other next to Cas'. “So, what do I have to do to get something to eat around here?”
Cas kept standing by the table. “We- I wasn't sure how much you remembered. You never talked about it.”
Castiel downed the rest of the bottle, water dropping off his chin, before he stopped to think about it. Now that his thirst was assuaged, his stomach was making a good argument. “I am somewhat hungry. Jack let me eat some of his Crunch Cookie Crunch, but I never took more than a handful and the last time was three weeks ago.”
“What about you?” Dean frowned at him. What opinion did the prince think needed to change, exactly?
It was weird, but not uncomfortable. Usually, physical contact wasn't something that Castiel initiated, at least not with anyone but his closest family. And even then, the hugs were brief. But he had realized lately that he was feeling rather lonely, and actually missing human contact for the first time in his life.
“Deal.” Prince Gabriel grinned. “So which of these lovelies do you want for the night? You know you can get several. May I suggest-”
“Good,” Dean replied around a mouthful of toast, and Sam scoffed at his lack of manners, but if Dean heard him, he didn't show it. Instead, he chewed and swallowed, then added: “'m great. I have no idea who most of the people are running around in the bunker, but...” He shrugged and shoved a forkful of eggs into his mouth.
Cas scowled at him. “We did not make Jack do anything. He volunteered to try it. It was his idea.” He sighed. “He really... Out of all of us, I think he wanted Michael dead the most. I mean, Sam and I, we were mostly thinking about getting you back, but Jack... He saw what Michael did in apocalypse world and he is young and seeing all that carnage...”
Sam sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Dean knew that he was already working himself ragged, was already getting too little sleep, and the last thing he needed was his brother pushing for answers they didn't have, but Dean needed something. Anything.
“Nah. See.” Dean yawned and leaned closer against him. “You're sarcastic, too, but you like people.”
The minute Sam declared that they would start – because of course that had to come from the
Dean's stomach dropped at seeing it. He was hot in his anger, but was he angry at Dean? What had he done?
Dean stared at him. “The fuck are our lives,” he grumbled, letting his head fall back against the wall.
“You don't want to come from my hand,” he stated, and Dean thought he could hear reproach in his voice. Or maybe he was imagining it.
He was in one of the Heavens, after all.
“Certainly.” MacLeod made a dismissive gesture and tucked her read hair behind her ear. “Now, what can you offer me as payment for this task?” She set down her pen and looked to Castiel, who wasn't particularly inclined to offer her anything. Besides, he knew that she rarely worked for coin, being paid by the crown, anyway.
Prince Castiel let out a muffled groan against the pillow when Dean pressed into a particularly hard place near his shoulder blade.
But not as much as Cas jumped. His eyes flew open and his hands almost dropped Dean's, but then he gripped it tighter instead. “Dean,” he said, breathlessly, and a swirl of emotions passed over his face: Surprise, wonder, pain, relief, happiness.
Cas actually did ask Claire if she had read the fanfiction when they had a moment alone, and according to what he told Dean later, she had just rolled her eyes and made sounds of disgust as she'd told him that a friend had told her about the story, and that she had closed her eyes while printing and boxing it. Apparently, she had really just meant it as a tease, and maybe even as a nudge to get them in the right direction. Mostly as a way to embarrass them, though.
Surprisingly, Gabriel and Eileen signed to each other pretty much the whole time without speaking aloud, and Dean was lost to their conversation from the start. “Damn, I need to learn more ASL.”
Soooo, the sex scene in this got more emotional than intended lmao. (insert 'escalated quickly' meme here) (Seriously, though, I don't know what happened, I guess I was in a particular mood)
And then Prince Castiel returned, standing in the middle of the room like a deer in the torch light.
“Very well, your highness. If that is all.” The butler bowed again, then left the room.
“I'm distracting you from myself? That –
“About what?”
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. In the couple of months he had been here, Gabriel had never slept with him, though he had been pretty much sleeping his way through the Harem, never minding the gender of his partner. Dean wondered if tonight would be the night. He wasn't exactly looking forward to it, though he was kind of curious. The others made Gabriel sound like a decent lover, and Dean had never fucked a Prince before.
“Yeah, sure. Say goodnight to Eileen for me.”
“I don't know about this show, Cas,” Dean said, eating his pizza while lying on his side on the bed, with Cas glued to his back. “The doc ain't even sexy. I mean, not ugly, but kinda old and... ya know.”
“You're thinking werewolf.”
She pulled her arm away with a force that belied her slim frame, then stalked out of the room without so much as looking at him. Castiel sighed.
“Happy New Year, Dean.”
“Sarcastic, huh?” Dean asked before he bit into the mushroom-free slice that was dripping with sauce as well as fat from the salami. That might be interesting. He happened to know another guy who was pretty old, sarcastic and good at healing people. But about twenty minutes into the episode, with his pizza mostly gone, Dean found himself disappointed. “He's sarcastic, alright. Or more, like, cynic. He hates people.”
Cas sighed, but rolled over, and they got some wet towels from the bathroom. When they got back, Cas just sat at the edge of the bed, looking defeated. Dean wrapped his arms around him from behind, leaving a kiss on his neck.
Jack nodded, slowly. “It took me some time to understand that, too. I didn't know why you were so sad and angry all the time, thought it was just that you hated me...” He shifted on the bed. “But when Cas came back and you were so happy... I started understand.”
They ended up ordering pizza for dinner and by the time it arrived, the soap had ended and they changed the channel until they came across what looked like a medical drama. Dean thought he had seen at least one of the characters before, but he couldn't quite place him until Cas said that it was called 'House M.D.'. Apparently, he had watched some episodes of it before and had liked it well enough, despite the 'exuberantly dramatic' plot structure that 'always leads to the main cast saving a life at the very last second, and when the patient had already gone through so many cardiac arrests and strokes that they should have permanent brain (and other organs) damage, yet somehow they always turn out completely fine'.
rooms. Plural. In the palace. The freaking palace. What the hells.
“You said there might be something you could do for Heaven, even if it wouldn't help much.” Dean felt like he was breaking some silent agreement by talking about it. They hadn't had much time to themselves as it was, what with the bunker full of strangers. Cas also couldn't stay in his room all day and night without people becoming suspicious, even though Dean was starting to think that maybe they should be suspicious. Maybe the others should know about them. Not that he had shared that train of thought with Cas yet.
Dean had thought about coming out before, knew he would have to do it before settling down with Cas. After all, how would he explain to Sammy that he wanted to buy a house with Cas and live together with him forever, have Eileen and him over for lunch on Sundays, guest rooms always ready for Claire and Jack and whoever would drop by? Sure, being the professional liar that he was, he might have come up with something, some bullshit to tell Sam that kept up his 'totally heterosexual, nothing to see here' image. But again, that wasn't fair, and it also wasn't what he wanted.
“In my experience, it's never 'just' anything, Dean,” Cas grumbled, then sighed. “I thought you wanted to retire.”
“Who said anything about staying? We just want- well. Okay, first things first. Michael?” Gabriel asked.
, and it was better and worse at the same time, similar to when Dean fucked Cas but even more intense, the way Dean could give himself over and trust Cas to treat him like he was precious, like he was worth a damn thing.
Cas smiled at him. “I'm certain we can organize a floor plan for you.”
“I would never do something against your will.” Castiel felt a little guilty, considering what they were currently doing. “You don't need to be afraid of me.”
A prince is glad that I'm not mad at him. Huh. Wait until Sammy hears this.
“Guilty.” Castiel sighed, holding out one of the cookies to her, and she took it with a small smile.
Castiel considered him for a moment, feeling a pang of sympathy and guilt. He shouldn't have occupied his bed, but he was glad that Dean hadn't shared it with him. It wasn't that he disliked the man, but his personal space was important to him and having someone in the same bed usually violated that.
“It's okay,” Cas said, “I'm here. You're okay. He's dead, Dean. You're okay.”
“You kil-” Dean's voice had become loud and shrill, and people were turning their heads, so he lowered it to a whisper: “You killed yourself?”
“Oh, lighten up, Cassie.”
“I can stand up for myself,” Dean said flatly, gripping his glass tighter.
“So are you telling me?” Dean laid down next to him on his side.
Several minutes and lots of duct tape later, the thing was as attached to the roof railing as it possibly could be without a binding spell, so they took off towards the bunker again. It was already mid-afternoon by the time they got there, but after unloading and putting away the groceries, they spent a few minutes unfastening the tree again, then carried it into the library and set it up. On the tables in the middle of the library, they spread out the stuff from the wish list (except what required cooling), then arranged them into piles and put name tags on them so everyone would know what was theirs and what wasn't.
“You looked pretty startled yourself there for a moment.” Dean grinned, more easily this time. “Not that I blame you. If I ran into someone wearing this-” He held up the arm with the wristband. “-I'd be wary too.”
“That is...” Castiel made a face. “Disgusting. Anyway. I do require Dean, if you don't mind.”
For a moment, Castiel was afraid he would see Dean sitting close to someone, maybe in their lap, but he didn't spot him at all. He frowned, then turned towards one of the employees who was sipping on her wine alone, reclined on a chaiselongue next to a magic light. Castiel wondered briefly if the lights were enough, if the people here were warm enough. He hadn't actually come here to plan out their placement as he had with the courtyard, had never actually stepped foot here for the preparation of any previous festival. He wondered if the employees knew and resented him for it.
“Oh, lighten up, Clarence. Don't worry, we're not going to your rooms to fuck, and I won't even try to bathe with you. But we can talk while you're in the tub, anyway, and I can go through your desk and steal all your secrets.”
“How did you choose?”
Dean froze, his eyes widening in shock as realization started to set in. The wolf used that exact moment to pounce on him, and Dean only managed to evade at the last moment, staggering back a bit while the wolf was already whirling around to strike again. If he couldn't pull himself together, Dean was done for, would end up as kebab on the floor, sliced by those claws, but he still couldn't wrap his head around what the thing had said, couldn't, no, didn't want to believe what it had implied...
Castiel blinked at him. “Because no one else will do it.”
“Your highness,” they muttered, trying to bow with the pies still in their hands. Dean caught one as it threatened to fall, and he hissed at the heat of the metal plate, quickly withdrawing his hand once he had nudged the pie back into safety on the person's hand. He only saw now that the other person was wearing baking mittens.
“You did warn me,” Cas mused, but he was smiling.
“You haven't written to him yet?”
After slight hesitation, Castiel held out his glass. “Thank you,” he muttered as the red liquid flowed, and he got a smile in return. It looked genuine.
“Cas.” Dean framed his face with his hands. “I told you, it's not a big deal. No sweat off my back.”
“You're gonna spend the night with one of these lovely birds here and not think about work for once.”
“You don't mind?” Castiel was drawing the curtains closed.
“Good morning, Dean.”
“Royal Fa- You don't intend the marry him, do you?” She looked horrified.
“And you are behaving like a child, but you don't see me chastising you for that.”
Dean smiled at the air quotes. “Do you want wine?”
Eventually, Dean wandered out into the courtyard again, throwing a suspicious glance about him as if Hester could be hiding in the shade of a tree or between some of the big-leafed plants, ready to pounce. That was nonsense, of course, but he couldn't shake the feeling of unease as he rounded the garden on the gravelly path that ran on all four sides of it, pebbles crunching under his – apparently not good enough – shoes.
Castiel glanced back at his papers and sighed. He had wished for a distraction, but this was certainly not what he had envisioned. Still, he knew that when Hester got like this, she would stop at nothing until she had her will, even if she had to cause a scene in front of the whole court. Resigning himself to his fate, Castiel straightened his robe and followed his sister.
“They know. They know now and I-” One of Dean's hands came up to the back of Castiel's head, as if he was holding on for balance, as if fearing he might crumble otherwise. “I don't know how to deal with that. I've never told anyone. Fuck, I didn't even tell them today, they just- I- I don't know if Sam understood-”
“Pity.” Dean was itching to be fucked, but he could wait. Maybe he could do something about it tomorrow, once Cas was gone.
Dean took one of the glasses from him, staring at it for a moment. This wasn't meant for him, but for visitors, the crystal too fine for the employees to use. He was afraid that he would drop it and cost the palace more than he would ever earn.
“Dean.” Castiel took his hand and squeezed it. “I want this. I know you have your reservations...”
“I'm Dean,” he said lamely. “I-”
“But-” Dean made a face. “I know we're supposed to think of the Royal family as these superhuman beings, but you're human, right? So you need a break every now and then, not non-stop work.”
“Like 'fuck'.” Dean punctuated it with a particularly hard thrust. “Or 'love your cock' or something.”
Dean only noticed there were tears in his eyes when Cas hugged him tight and his face was pressed against Cas' hair.
When Cas came by around noon, Dean was stretched out on his bed, a book open beside him. He was just flipping through it, unable to concentrate enough to take in the words, and he got up when Cas entered.
“So you knew, huh?” Dean asked, seeming embarrassed.
“You need new clothes,” Castiel reminded him absent-mindedly, scribbling a few notes for his meeting with the Lady Moseley in less than an hour. Even though the lady did not come from a house of nobles, she had revealed a great talent for the art of trade, and had even managed to replace the previous president of the merchant guild not long ago. Some (mostly nobles) begrudged her low-born origins, but she exuded an aura of authority that most of them lacked. Besides, with more commoners entering the guild and even taking key positions, it had only been a matter of time before one of them took the highest office in their ranks. Castiel was secretly pleased with this development, though he had an inkling that Lady Moseley did not return his sympathies. After all, he was a prince, and therefore essentially one of those who had done their utmost to bar her from the successes she had worked so hard to achieve.
“He ever even come out of your brother's room?” he asked gruffly.
Out of the corner of an eye, he saw Cas turning his head, but then he was jumped by the two wolves again and concentrated back on the battle. Dean also had to focus back on the wolf in front of him, who was grinning, his stance wide open, as if he wasn't scared of anything Dean might throw at him.
Despite himself, Dean laughed. “Yeah, no. No deals, and no one's in danger. At least not any more than usual. Uh... You know how we, like, had sex in the motel...”
“Oh, you like that, don't you?” Prince Gabriel was raising an eyebrow at Dean. “You like seeing your Prince being degraded. Mmmh, I like my men like that.” He had a wolfish grin on his face.
After that, Castiel came back at least once a week, sometimes twice. Dean would sometimes get up without being prompted when he saw him, and the prince never corrected him, never went for someone else.
“What the fuck?” Dean said, because seriously, what the fuck.
“I left a mark on you. Is that even allowed?”
“It's a story,” Cas said after scanning the first page. “About... us?”
Castiel looked up at him with an undecipherable expression. “No?”
Dean looked at him for a long moment, finding nothing but honesty and nerves on his face. “Of course. What do you want to talk about?”
“Don't worry. Just put the pies outside, I'll...” Dean spotted a sink and walked over, then hesitated. “This water is cold, right?”
“Are you okay?”
Cas hesitated, looking between the present in his hand and the corridor. “I'm not sure. Hold this.” He pressed the present into Dean's hand and took off. “Stay here,” he said over his shoulder.
Dean.
A person who Dean recognized as a butler by his uniform came in. “You called, your highness.” He bowed.
“He okay?” Dean asked, barely able to suppress the shiver that ran through him hearing all this.
For now though, he was busy with massaging all that muscle. The oil he used smelled musky and yet a little sweet, making him a little dizzy like always. And all the toned skin he was touching didn't help in the matter. He was kneeling over the Prince's waist, his legs brushing the Prince's sides every now and then. He was careful not to lower himself accidentally, afraid that Prince Castiel might not like to be touched more than ordered, especially by Dean's groin.
“But I would like to watch a Christmas movie,” Cas admitted.
“This it?” Dean asked, and Castiel realized they had just been standing in front of the door for several seconds.
“Another one? Really?” They had already watched a few since Dean's return, because Cas had insisted that it was the seasonally appropriate thing to do.
“You want to hunt it,” Cas said tonelessly.
“It's okay, just...” He grimaced as the tips of his fingers and part of his palm burned.
“I was going to say I'll beat them over the head with the respective books until they behave properly towards you, but I suppose your suggestion might work, too.”
“What?” Dean grabbed the papers, skimmed a few of the paragraphs. “What the fuck- don't-” He stuffed them back into the box, wrestling it out of Cas' hands. “Don't read that. I'm gonna- gonna put this away.” His face felt like it was on fire, and when he glanced up towards Claire, she had the gall to grin at him.
He played around with the lights for an amount of time that he would never admit to anyone, then turned them all off and went back to the bedroom part. There was a small study next to the bathroom, even though there was also a reading table in the bedroom, which seemed superfluous, but whatever.
“Hah! Who's old now?” Dean yelled after him as he walked towards the door.
“Hey guys,” she shouted to the room, “guess who's standing under the mistle toe.”
Claire shouted that it was almost midnight, and they counted down the seconds. At two, Dean turned towards Cas and kissed him to whooping and the sound of the first rockets in the background. Cas smiled when they pulled apart, his free hand curled in the lapel of Dean's jacket, and he pressed another quick kiss to Dean's mouth.
“Oh.” Dean bit his lower lip, evading Castiel's eyes. “Guess I'm pretty transparent, huh.”
“I've been thinking about it for years,” Cas admitted, squeezing Dean's shoulder, “so it is, in fact, well thought out.”
“You said the tree's a pagan tradition,” someone butted in, interrupting the moment between the two. Seemed like more people had been listening than Dean had thought. “Does that mean we, uh, technically worship them by putting up a tree?”
Castiel glared at him.
“Sister!” Castiel stepped up next to her chair. “If you so much as think such a word in his presence, you will regret it.”
Sam huffed. “Cas?”
Prince Castiel let out another exasperated sigh. “Really? You're going there? In front of...” He gestured to the rest of the room, then held up a hand when Prince Gabriel opened his mouth. “No, please don't answer that. Just. For the love of the Gods. Let us keep a last shred of dignity. Just one.”
“Alright. You're gonna have to keep coming by then so I can keep telling you that.” Dean sounded smug.
Castiel glared at her. “I did not choose Dean purely to enrage my family, if that is what you're asking.”
“Yeah.” When they pulled apart again, Dean left his hand on Cas' shoulder, but just as he inhaled to say the words he hadn't been able to say for over six months, the door creaked and they both jumped, breaking all physical contact just in time as Jody popped her head into the room.
“If you would rather have me stay awake...” Cas trailed off, sounding insecure.
Still, seeing the scowl on Dean's face as he tried hard not to move, Castiel decided to indulge him once more. “There is nothing wrong with your clothes, Dean, but they are hardly fitting for the palace.”
Castiel passed the blade and the vial to Dean, who searched his eyes for confirmation. Nodding, Castiel turned his face up, leaving his throat open.
Dean sighed. “Yes, that is the face he makes when he is seriously annoying.”
“Some of them cared. Gabriel was around sometimes. Of course he's been notorious with drink and other vices for as long as I can remember. Ana is closest to my age and was a great comfort, but she left for another kingdom for marriage. Happy marriage, as I hear, but it still pains me to know that she is so far away.”
“Dean,” Cas said, sounding almost as if he felt the same, as if everything boiled down to those four letters like it did for Dean with Cas' name, like nothing mattered or made sense in that moment except each other.
“Separate rooms, huh. So, no sharing a bed?” Dean looked disappointed.
The Prince was even more handsome with his robe pulled down to his waist. Dean had seen that he was broad-shouldered, but he hadn't expected quite this much muscle. Heavens. If the Prince didn't want to have sex with him, Dean might actually be a bit disappointed.
A few hours later, when everyone had had the chance to contribute to the list, Cas and Dean took off. Since it was his car, Cas insisted on driving, and for once Dean found he didn't mind. To his surprise, Cas had a tape deck and an adapter in the car, and when Dean asked what tapes he even had to listen to, he said, as if it were the most normal thing in the world: “The one you gave me, of course.”
“I love you, Dean,” Cas murmured into his hair and it was so perfect Dean trembled with it.
Okay, he had not expected her of all people to have that reaction. She had died in the Regan era, for God's sake.
“Your highness!” the person said, growing even paler, throwing an anxious look around, possibly for a place to set down the pies.
“I'm glad you think so. Though I'm afraid I'll have to be horrible and leave you to it – my next meeting is half-way across the city.” He got up, collecting his notes.
“Cassie! I'd say it's nice of you to come by, but we both know you're not here for me.” Gabriel smirked. “Can't find Dean? Hey, can anyone go and-”
After a few steady breaths, he felt better, though he didn't trust himself to stand up quite yet.
Dean looked at him, clearly more awake than a minute ago. “We barely know each other,” he ventured.
“Shut up. I know.” Dean threw another look at the walls that he could hardly see, covered as they were. “What is all this for?”
“Nothing as crass as that.” Gabriel made a face. “But I'd rather you be honest up front: Do you like my brother?”
“They are,” Cas muttered beside him.
“I didn't mean to-”
“Really need to work on that dirty talk, hon.” Dean winked at him before he sat up and grabbed the lube again. While he slicked up his fingers, Cas looked at him with that frustrating calm of his.
Dean pulled him the rest of the way in.
“I thought he was cold and distant,” Dean said sarcastically, annoyed that Gabriel was talking shit about Cas.
“Hearts?” Cas asked quietly.
“I know. But there's still work to do.” Dean grumbled, but complied, drifting off to sleep easily in his new bed, with his prince wrapped around him.
“We killed him.” Cas was staring at his brother defiantly.
Dean let himself fall onto the bed – his bed, holy shit – and stared up at the canopy above it. Because there was a gods damned canopy above his bed now. What even was his life.
Opening his eyes again, Prince Castiel made a face. “But the preparation for the spri-”
“That's not-” Prince Castiel glared at his brother. “Fine. One night. And then you'll leave me in peace.”
“See, this is why I like you, Dean-erino.” Prince Gabriel sipped on his wine, not a care in the world.
“You sure?” Sam asked, frowning, but Dean could see the wheels in his head turning.
Dean looked down at himself, at the robe he had been wearing most days in the Harem, a short yellow thing without much ornamentation. It would be clear to anyone who saw him that he was a stranger to the palace, and Castiel wanted to change that.
Huh. Another thing that Sam wasn't quite ready to let himself contemplate yet. Maybe he, too, should just settle on being relieved that Dean was back. Everything else would sort itself out over time, or come back to bite them in the ass. But there would still be time to deal with that, then.
Dean sighed. “Guess I really do need new clothes. Then again, if that means people are gonna be scared of me, maybe I don't want it at all.” He scowled, the word 'nobility' repeating in his head.
“Yes.” The Prince seemed hesitant for a moment, then started walking towards the yard. Dean followed him.
“Well, you are only just back, while I have had time to watch their interactions for months.” They made themselves comfortable on the bed while Dean fired up the laptop. “To be honest, I don't understand why it took them so long to get to this point. They appeared to like each other already when Eileen first came here.”
“Of course. When we connected... my memory of the time in my mother's womb is a little hazy, probably because I wasn't fully developed yet. But I clearly remember your feelings about Dean. I didn't understand it at the time, of course. I'm not sure if I fully understand it now, since I've never been in love myself...”
“What's wrong?” Dean asked, or Castiel thought he asked, because he slurred his words considerably.
“Would being cranky make you get me food faster?”
“This is a palace, Dean. All palaces are somewhat of a maze.” Cas squeezed his hand.
“Of course.” Dean smiled at him, a little shyly, as if he was pleasantly surprised. “But, uh, didn't you say you weren't into men?”
Dean got up from the couch and took his arm. “Let's go to my room.”
“Thank God,” Dean muttered, then stopped to consider that. “Literally, I guess.”
Cas sighed, looking at the floor, but eventually he seemed to decide that there was no point hiding it: “She was tortured at that camp we rescued her from. And her torturer was their world's version of me.”
“Don't want me in you?” Dean teased, and licked over one of Cas' nipples before sucking it into his mouth.
“Wait, so you pick up the slack that Gabriel dropped?”
Cas nodded slowly. “That's true,” he said thoughtfully, glancing at Dean. “This might actually be beneficial for both sides.”
“Angels,” Cas finished for him, glaring at the genuinely confused and frightened looking people who came through. That didn't seem right. Angels weren't this timid. “They're angels from the apocalypse world.”
“Oh.” He seemed genuinely surprised, which annoyed Dean for some reason. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- Are you supporting your family?”
“Okay,” Dean said uncertainly.
He felt Cas' chuckle more than he heard it. “Yeah. It's rather high on the list, considering that if Heaven does shut down, all the billions upon billions of souls will fall to Earth, and who knows what havoc they might wreak. But... I am tired of trying to fix everything. It might be partly my fault that the number of angels is so diminished, but as I said, there's not much I can do and it's not like my help would be wanted, anyway.”
“Lily?” someone called from deeper within the kitchen. “Lily, you alright? Did you say something?”
Cas seemed content to fuck him like that for hours, but at some point the pressure was too much for Dean, the urge for release more than physical. Dean barely had to say anything, just keened a “Cas, please” and the love of his life knew exactly what to do, wrapped a hand around Dean and stroked tightly until he came, moaning. It wasn't long after that Cas came, and Dean suspected it wasn't coincidence, maybe helped along by his grace to make sure they were in synch, but Dean barely cared as he held Cas so close it was almost suffocating.
“Very logical thinking.” Dean turned his hand so it was palm up, and Cas took it as the invitation that it was. After giving his hand a short squeeze, Dean couldn't help but ask: “How...?”
“Complicated,” Cas said grimly, but his grip on Dean's hand tightened, a small but reassuring gesture.
Castiel looked to the side. “Does my brother... proposition you often?”
“How do I even address them?” Dean frowned, still looking down at the bracelet.
“My- what?” Cas blinked at him.
Dean frowned at him. “For what?”
“Gabriel,” Castiel said as he had reached them.
Castiel sighed, leaning his head back against the seat. “Yes, Dean, I'm just as sure as the other fifty times you asked.”
But it kind of stung that apparently Castiel didn't think Dean worthy of sleeping with him. Of course there could be a myriad of reasons for this, including Castiel not being interested in men. But Dean still didn't have to like it.
Sam was the first to hug him, and even though Dean complained about getting his bones broken, he was unable to keep a huge smile from spreading on his face. Then there were a lot more hugs, people all but competing with each other to go first, and there were even some tears.
“Respect?!” His uncle shrieked. “To these sirens, these-”
“Cas?” he croaked, voice slurred, the sound of a hand patting the bed in search of the warm body that had inhabited it until mere seconds ago.
Moaning, Dean couldn't help his hips bucking, trying to take in more of Cas.
“I just had the strangest, and yet most entertaining encounter.” She laughed in her mocking way, making it clear that she was in no way happy about it. “There was a boy, a young man I suppose, in the courtyard. Pretty face, I admit, but his clothes – he looked like he came straight from the Harem!” She wrinkled her nose. “Anyway, guess what. He claimed to be your companion. Hah!” She smiled smugly at him.
“Hm. I always knew she had good taste.” Gabriel snorted. “Don't look at me like that. Did you come here to get my help, or to mope?”
Like last time with the massage, Castiel instantly relaxed at his words. “Anything. Anything but my work.”
“The one with the long hair,” Cas whispered back. When Dean just looked at him impishly, he added: “You know full well that I don't mean Sam.”
Or maybe he had just thought that Dean would come out in his boxers, since that was how he slept most of the time.
“Kinda.” Dean decided he didn't mind if Castiel knew about his circumstances. He seemed like a good enough guy. “He's at the Academy.”
At some point, Cas reached out his hand, but couldn't quite reach him. Knowing what he wanted, Dean leaned down to kiss him, slowing down the movement of his fingers.
Another one of the books was about geometry, which Dean remembered from maths class. He hadn't gotten far on the subject before he'd dropped out, so he took some time reading the book, but got bored after a few pages. Being able to calculate all manner of things was definitely useful for something, but Dean didn't really see a career as an architect or a bridge construction worker in his future, so he put the book back, wondering if Cas had put them all there deliberately. He didn't seem to let many things to chance, but it was difficult to imagine that he had found the time to decorate Dean's room next to his regular work, and in the span of a couple hours.
What if this was just an elaborate prank? But no, Cas wasn't like that, Dean was sure. What if he changed his mind, though, what if he didn't come and Dean would sit here at noon, waiting and looking stupid?
“Yeah, sure. I've seen them before, but that doesn't mean I know 'em. Besides, that was six months ago.”
“But it is a perk?” She raised an eyebrow.
Cas was silent for a moment. “You appeared to enjoy that in the past. But if you don't like it anymore, I can refrain from it.”
They did talk about anything and everything. Dean told him all about the employees in the Harem, who was fancying whom, all the gossip he had heard. He didn't think that Castiel was particularly interested, but he smiled at Dean as he talked, his eyes fixed on his face, sometimes darting down to his lips.
“Let me be the judge of that.”
“Yes, your highness.”
When Dean hadn't come back for several minutes, Castiel went to look for him, leaving behind Sam and Eileen who were deep in a half-signed, half-whispered conversation. Castiel hadn't paid enough attention to be sure, but he thought that Eileen was trying to convey to Sam the meaning of Dean and Castiel's kiss, that it hadn't just been for tradition's sake. For some reason, Sam seemed to have trouble grasping the concept.
Cas only gave him a few seconds like that before he shuffled off him, though he immediately pulled Dean against himself as he hit the mattress so both of them were on their side, Dean's face to Cas's chest.
“What do you wish to convene about, my Prince?” Dean asked sweetly, hoping it would annoy Gabriel.
“You knew,” Dean said, feeling as if someone else was talking, and shivering at the sound of his own voice. “You knew that Michael enhanced those monsters. That's why you didn't want me to hunt.”
“True, but inevitable.” Cas smiled, then seemed to remember something. “Oh, do you want wine?”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably while Hester gritted her teeth audibly. “He must be under a spell. There's no other logical explanation.”
A smile stole itself onto Castiel's face. “No promises. Though I imagine that if he behaves any way other than cordially towards you in this regard, Eileen will be quicker to beat him upon the head than I'll be.”
Dean drew his gun. “Who are these people?”
that stuff.”
“You made this?”
“Lady Margaret! How nice to see you,” he said jovially, squeezing the man and the woman he had his arms around.

“I already noticed last time. You say 'my mother', but 'our father'. Why is that?”
“That's not what I asked.” Dean rolled his eyes, knowing Cas couldn't see it, but he could probably hear it in his voice.
Sam knew what it was like to be possessed by an archangel and it wasn't pretty. And almost seven months of that... He didn't really want to think about it too much.
“What do you want to be doing, my Prince?” Dean asked, trying for his best silken voice, though it probably sounded like a tease or a challenge, anyway.
“Yeah, no. It's just you were gonna, like...” Dean's face burned with embarrassment. Doing it was one thing, but talking about it... “You were gonna... gonna top.”
“Cool. Christmas saved.” The guy gave Cas a quick smile, then went over to the tree to hang up some more glitter balls.
“Thank you, sweetie. I think with everything that's happened lately and with all the hunts, no one had really been thinking about Christmas yet, even if it's just a few days away. Maybe after all this time of fighting, we can give these people a proper Christmas.”
But Cas pulled him flush against himself, one hand travelling down to squeeze Dean's ass. “I don't want to fuck you, but I can still make you come.”
Cas pulled back with another sigh.
Cas looked at him for a long time. “If you're sure.”
“I suppose you know why we're here,” Hester said, seating herself with a back so straight that it was too stiff to look graceful.
Dean was sure he was going to die of embarrassment if he so much as glanced at those pages again, but he couldn't deny Cas when he looked at him with such an innocent, hopeful expression.
Cas smiled back at him. “Whatever you want.”
“Good.” Dean leaned against Castiel's side. “I hear it can be kinda weird for kids when their parent starts dating someone. But maybe that's more a thing when the parents are divorced or one of them died or something.” He frowned. “Not sure how kids usually react when two of their parents start dating.”
Dean and Cas have an important conversation. There are more Star Trek references, because I cannot help myself.
“Maybe I'm being unfair to our father, but I think my mother did most of the work in the palace.” Castiel frowned. “No, that sounds wrong. Of course the staff did most of the work, but my mother oversaw it all. And after she died... our father expected us to take over from her.”
Castiel shrugged, then pulled Dean close to him again. “I have had sex before. It was pleasant, for the most part.”
Sam turned to him, and he ignored Dean's laugh and his disbelieving repetition of the word to listen to Thomas' status report and give him directions to pass on to the hunters currently on a case. By the time he turned back to the others, Dean was almost finished eating, and he was grinning widely.
When he knocked on Dean's door, he heard his familiar voice call: “Come in!”
So Dean swallowed down his protest and just said: “Yeah, maybe.” Maybe it really was time to make him that other mixtape, after all.
Castiel didn't make it back until after seven, and he feared that Dean would be angry that he was late. Or perhaps he wouldn't even be in his rooms, instead choosing to explore the palace. What if he got lost? Castiel hadn't procured any maps for him yet. But if he lost his way, he could simply ask someone for the way back to his rooms. Would he, though?
She cocked an eyebrow, seeming entirely calm. “Am I happy that you kissed the possessed body of my dead father?” she asked coolly.
“You ate his cereal? Why?” Dean frowned at him as he made his way over to the driver's door.
“It's fine. You've probably got more important problems than...” He gestured vaguely to himself.
“Go back to sleep, Dean,” Castiel said gently.
“Castiel called us.” She threw him a small smile. “Well, he called Claire to tell her you were back, and then we came over as soon as we could. Only arrived a couple hours ago. Alex has to work, so she couldn't come, but...” She let out a deep sigh. “You have no idea how glad we are to have you back.”
“Happy? For what?” Sam blinked at them in confusion, making Dean frown.
Dean nodded. He had heard about the Princess' death all his life, how it had been a day of mourning for the kingdom.
He tried to take measured breaths to ease his nerves, but it wasn't working. Just as he was about to throw his bag off the bed, there was a knock on the door and then it opened before Dean could say anything.
“Not necessarily.” Cas was leaning in the doorway. Other people had been on their way to the kitchen before, but had chickened out when they'd noticed Sam and Dean were having a serious conversation there. But Cas didn't seem to be concerned about butting in. “The werewolves we fought knew Dean wasn't Michael's vessel anymore, and yet they were still careless, maybe even intentionally so. Their leader might be gone, but in all honesty, I don't think they care much. Michael was an angel. Whatever deal they had, whatever he promised them, monsters still hate angels, and I don't believe for a second that they actually looked up to him. They might have been scared of him, or tempted by his promises, but that would have been all.” Cas took some steps into the room, towards Dean, who looked away. He had wanted to avoid talking to Cas about this again, so he wouldn't be more worried, or angry than he already was. What they had together still seemed so fragile, as if any fight between them could end it, so Dean had tried to keep the air between them clean. “It's possible that some of the monsters may go back into hiding because they're not on their way to taking over the world anymore, or whatever Michael had told them would happen. But they're still stronger and faster than before, and that will surely have gone to their heads.”
That got him a laugh from almost everyone, and an eye roll from Claire. Cas was still looking at him with a fond smile, as he had for most of the hugging session. Eventually, Jack let go and everyone decided that they should give Dean some space to rest, so they started filing out of the room.
After locking the door behind them, Dean let himself fall onto the bed face first, then tested the mattress with his hand. Not exactly memory foam, but not bad for a cheap motel, either. It seemed pretty clean, too. Before Cas could even ask him what he was doing, though, Dean got back up and declared that he needed a shower, then fled into the bathroom.
“What?”
“Then I will not partake in it. Good day, High Enchantress.”
Cas smiled and Dean realized that he wasn't even looking at the fireworks, his eyes trained on Dean. “Very beautiful.”
Almost a minute went by without any of them moving, except for Hester tapping her foot impatiently. If MacLeod was disturbed by it, she did not let it on. Eventually, she dropped Castiel's hands.
Carefully, Castiel extricated himself from the blanket that he didn't remember getting and sat up. His eyes were slowly adjusting to the dark, vague shapes forming in front of him. Despite the early hour, there was stray light peaking through the drawn curtains, undoubtedly the magic lights lining the walkway outside. After a while, Castiel could make out enough to see Dean, wrapped in his own blanket, half-sitting and half-lying on the couch closest to the fire place.
Dean's face was in flames, or at least it felt like that. “I d- How could I n- Listen. I like him, okay? I have no idea if I can be what he wants, or what it even is he wants. Is he gonna change his mind in two weeks? What if I embarrass him in front of his family? What if I embarrass him in front of the Crown Prince?!”
When Castiel awoke the next morning to the blaring sound of his time piece, it took him a moment to realize that he was not in his own room, and that the warmth on his back was Dean. He reached for the time piece and turned it off, but jostled Dean in the process, who just grunted and grabbed him tighter.
“If you come to me for this, it must have a political component.” Michael's voice was cool and even. “Is this about your frequent visits to the Harem?”
Prince Castiel sighed. “I know how sex works, Gabriel,” he said, then turned to Dean and  added a murmured “But thank you.”
“Is it true?” he asked, his throat tight.
“Shit. I'm gonna have to send him a fruit basket or something.”
“At the risk of sounding like Sam,” Cas said, studying the contents of Dean's plate, “shouldn't you add a few more vegetables to your diet? Or some fruit, at least?”
Some guy was bothering Dean and he didn't even know who he was.
Castiel blinked at him for a moment, then his eyes widened. “The Academy of the Golden Sun?”
– that's... an accomplishment, I suppose?” Cas' breath was going faster again, now that Dean's finger was all the way in and he started pulling it out only to push it back in.
“That's what I was told, too. But sometimes I wonder if that story is a fabrication to hide the truth.” Castiel sighed. “It wouldn't be the first lie the palace has spun to keep up pretences.”
