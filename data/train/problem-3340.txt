Dean tightened the strap on his pack. He hadn’t expected the day to end like this, to put it mildly, but he kept an emergency kit at the Roadhouse just in case. In the wallet he always carried in the interior pocket of his canvas caballero jacket, he had a daguerreotype of their family from forty years ago when they were last all together, and a more recent one of him and Sam. If he had that, he really had all he needed. He checked the hex bag in his pocket, the gear secreted about his person, the bandoleer beneath the jacket, the angel blade in the hidden sheathe in the back. He fitted the black cavalry hat on his head, adjusted the angle. All ready to sin.
Cas shook his head convulsively a couple of times, and then looked at Dean. The angel was so white in the face - a dead man’s pallor. His eyes searched Dean’s features as if he was seeing him for the first time, in something like growing horror.
“Are you sure you trust Rowena on this?”
Dean patted him on the shoulder- Sam pulled him into a gruff hug and then held for a few seconds, but it was time to go.
Sorry, Dean! He leapt up at me and I- I pulled the trigger without thinking, I was aiming for the legs but I didn’t realize how sensitive-” She’s too young to have been given gun practice yet beyond the basics, she’s a bow and arrow girl.
Dean, making his way through the early evening street, deserted at this time, opened up the pages and glanced through the letter section as he walked. Nothing jumped out at him. He could run back and give it to Serena for another reader. He could, he should, he wasn’t going to. Instead, he was going to put the paper down on the same parlor table later, even though he didn’t have a clue if or when Cas would be back to enjoy it.
Dean pulled away, a little regretfully, ignoring muscles that were battling the warmth and residual pleasure to complain about the unexpected work he’d just put them through. He sank down next to Cas and relaxed against the covers for an instant, ignoring the way both their bodies were still dangling half off the bed. His finger idly traced sigils, meaningless and kind, on his husband’s chest. His eyes closed of themselves. But then he shook his head.
was scritched on the bottom of the paper once she’d retrieved it.
“What-” Cas looked as close to swearing as Dean had ever seen him, his eyes turned inwards. “What weapon was that?”
“If you kick his majesty out of the castle, it will just be a big mess, so I'll be happy do it for you instead,” said Sam in a voice like steel caught in ice as he watched his wife’s fingers, yet not at all alarmed by what she was doing. "I have that right, as he's gone and insulted not just one but two people in this castle that I truly appreciate. My wife has a message for you, Michael. She says: Surprise, guess what, the vacant cow can talk.”
went the scribe’s scriptorium, sent flying with a savage kick. Vellum rollers clattered to the floor, quills, a box of seals, an inkwell spun like a weathervane and splattered its storm-black content onto the throne’s ermine. The mess garnered Robert’s heavy look that suggested that this right here was why he didn’t want Dean tearing through the castle.
into a baby. The arterial purple of the skin has given way to a blotchy pink, the blood, fluids and weird cream-cheese goop are gone, the features aren’t so swollen now, though the baby still looks like it’s had a rough night out on the tiles. While doing the ‘midwivery’, Rowena also gave the boy a once-over. He’s passed the ten-fingers-ten-toes test, and also the no-hooves-or-horns one. On the minuscule arm is a teensy tiny version of the Mark of Cain. But a puzzled Rowena said it feels dormant. How long this state of affairs will last is anyone’s guess. The whole situation is FUBAR...
He tenses as Dean lifts his gun and pulls back the hammer.
The angel reached for him. Sam flinched away and then gasped raggedly at the spasms in his abdomen. In the background, he heard Uriel bite out a name, a name Sam should recognize but his head was aching too much. Uriel was saying- saying Sam was guilty of-
“Oh? What’d they call it?” Dean asks indulgently, because he’s had nine months of listening to Cas tell him everything under the sun and he’s got no problem listening to nine months more.
“Both,” Dean decides promptly. All betas are curious, though for a lot of them that curiosity is, shall we say, very
His step is strong, purposeful, and he takes out his phone to look at the picture again and again. They might actually do it, they might actually have a future together as long as Castiel keeps Heaven appeased and the Earth safe.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “Samuel J. Colt, why do you pretend to be some drunken caballero tosser who has never held a book? You and I both know that’s horseshit. You were well brought up, well educated, and if your childhood sweetheart hadn’t been killed by a - sorry, sensitive subject, do put that piece away. Fine, so you’re a hunter. But a hunter can be sober, educated and refined.”
“His Royal Highness Adam the Jouster? Don’t make me laugh,” Dean laughs sourly. “He’d be more in the way than Swan Prince, even without wings and a beak.”
“I see you know what’s going on,” Castiel concluded slowly.
Castiel, for his part, is not amused. “I thought your advertisement said you were a no-kill service.”
There were checks and balances. The humans had had to create them in order to simply spiritually survive this- this killing kindness the angels had imposed on them, this perfect world. Even more so to survive the occasional snakes still left in the Garden, snakes like Uriel.
Next chapter: The Mysterious Mr Smith
“Trust me on this,” he said briskly. “I know where this is sending us.”
“Can we just leave?” Dean whispered.
Fucker’s fast, dodged -
“Are they after us?” Dean craned his neck, tense. “What’s going on with the sky?”
Ordinarily Dean’s pretty damn proud to be one of the top fifteen beta hunters authorized to use a rifle rather than a bow, he’s even more proud of his gun modeled after the old-time Colt revolvers, but not right this minute. “Right. I’m the spirit of gunpowder economy from this day forward, I swear.”
“Wanna join us, dog-bait?” Adam and Marcos, both in Makers, are roughly the same age and have been good friends since they were both out of swaddling.
“You didn’t make sense, Dean, you were-”
“You have impressive human mannerisms.”
~~~ * ~~~
Lutecia’s nostrils flare. “You are facing six demons, you foolish man, and you’re nothing but a soldier. Are you delusional, that you believe you can surmount these odds? You may be-”
Castiel nodded, but Sam had turned away and was staring out the window, peering through the lace.
Finally Cas leans back with a last caress. Shivers of pleasure chase his fingertips along Dean’s jaw and neck. “You must be tired. And hungry. I’ve put on some soup, I was hoping you’d be back today.”
“No…” Castiel began to formulate words - short words, as devoid of noisy consonants as possible, that would not further pound in his head. Or maybe he could write the explanation in a letter. Yes, a letter. Then Dean could read it quietly, and-
Dean takes the runt off the exhausted tit between two frantic sucks and latches her onto the good stuff. He puts the bully behind Mira and lets him holler, serves him right.
Even an angel didn’t stand a chance of coming out of that unscathed. Cas went down like a bag of flour hitting the floor, the vessel out like a light, the higher being equally stunned.
“That was not a suggestion. I’m the one who dug those out of your back, that makes me your doctor and I can damn well tell you what to do until you’re better. Your turn to shut up and follow orders.”
Sam’s expression was bleak, but he fitted on his cap, handed Dean the latter’s cavalry hat, and got up with a finger marking his page. Dean moodily kicked back his chair and got a reproving ‘Oi!’ from the kitchen at the scrape of wood on wood. Ellen had ears like a cat when it came to the mistreatment of anything in her saloon, and she did not abide it, even though Dean could bust every article of furniture in the place and the Machine would rewrite them as pristine in a day or so.
The interjection came from Balthazar of all people. They’d almost forgotten he was there, he’d been so quiet.
Despite the rabid pain in his shoulder, Dean’s left hand shot up, palm flat to intercept. He knew before he even saw it that there was a fist coming at his face, because that would have been his own follow-through.
“Not you specifically - thank Heaven. But doesn’t it bother you? How she died? You say you’re our guardian. You keep harping on about it. You and all the angels and your-... and the God Machine whose decision was the root cause of it all.”
“Then it can wait. I have hunted down-”
“Yeah. Wish I had Dad’s option.” Gabe’s words were short and sharp like glass. “Turn into a Machine without ears, without eyes, without a heart, so I don’t have to-... Michael was surprised when I didn’t object to his order. He’s been trying to destroy our brother for the past two years, while being the most- most self-righteous ass about it. And when I bring up all of our
In the criss-cross of betas making tracks to various parts of the compound, the omega’s gaze flinches left and right and then quickly fixes on a familiar brown uniform, crafted on the same loom and identical to his own other than the arrow symbol on the shoulder. Cas looks at Garth carrying Clancy towards Vic’s cabin, a mildly perplexed twist to his brow. Garth doesn’t walk or talk or stand or do anything like an omega. He does them like Garth. Though come to think of it, the other hunter omegas are pretty eccentric too.
have put you two through a few more miles on this recent itinerary than was strictly required. A small number of angels have defected and eventually found their way to my side over the centuries - usually the scrapings of the P342 barrel, since no one cares if they disappear. They
Another good verbal jab, completely unlike Cole. Where the hell is this coming from…?
“You are right.”
“The Demons go well with the name Lucifer. A bit too on the nose,” Cas says with an unimpressed sniff as he starts to tidy up, slipping the medical scissors back in their case. “I'm surprised you could take him seriously.”
“I know it, boss-man. Night, Cas!” Jo strides off in the direction of her sleep roll. Dean follows her with his eyes, wondering what she was doing - or, being a beta, who she was doing. That’s the problem with having Tyler’s team around, and Sam’s guards too; there’s been a scuffle or two every night as betas unfamiliar with working with each other find their balance, and then after that’s done, there’s been a bit of sorting themselves out the other way; the strong making a point of jumping each other’s bones, taking the conflict into the sheets in pure beta tradition, while the day’s losers have to sit out in the cold, simmering with jealousy. Children, thinks Dean with a patronizing huff (which may go to show he’s got a short memory… but even if he’d be getting up to the same shenanigans this time last year, that don’t signify, he’s matured since then - look how he sorted out his small rift with Sammy with words, like a grownup, see?)
“Don’t blame him,” Jo snorted, “everything gets known here sooner rather than later, this place is a village.”
“It’s apricot season.”
“Crowley is the landlord and nothing more,” Gabriel said, finally glancing fully at Dean. “Don’t worry about him, he’s just-“
“Blind, head spinning, lungs heaving, half delirious and bleeding all over the floor, I know, I was there, but my memory of that nightmare is just fine. My savior didn’t say anything - certainly nothing in that pretty voice of yours, nor did I hear any of the bodyguards you said helped you away afterwards. But
“Looking at the times logged, and knowing what I know of report routing, this is what I would bet my Grace happened. Remember when you stormed in here two nights ago asking pointed questions about the railroad, the resistance and how he could get away with such shoddy oversight?”
Dean braced his hands against the sink and stared out the kitchen window at the moonlit garden.
“WHAT?!”
“The angels will be weakened, your forces have a chance now,” Cas told Panic as he walked at Dean’s side. “But do not trust Crowley anymore. He has his own designs.”
for all he was worth, and waiting for reality to catch up with the illusion.
His words washed over Dean as he stared. This was all good information and this was an amazing weapon he’d been handed, but all he could think of was his mother’s expression as she stepped out their door the last time, in those tough canvas clothes, gaze forward, not back. He could almost feel her fingers on it, as he held it, and he didn’t know how to feel about that.
sounds like Paradise’, was what Dean would have said once upon a time, or more specifically, two months ago and before he’d gotten married to an angel who’d willingly followed him down to hell to save his brother.
...That attack is a little more intellectual than Dean expected from the likes of Cole. He’d have put down a bet of a thousand to one the puppy would lead with a punch. But the hit is a good one, Dean has to struggle to hide his wince. The mood, the shape of things that’d seemed so rock certain a second ago, shifts a trifle.
Lydia’s just come around the corner of Dean’s cabin. She sashays up to the porch, giving Cas an incurious glance before dismissing him from consideration. She’s cleaned up, got fresh clothes on but a shirt only half buttoned over her cleavage, and a smile on her face that’s not hungry for moose.
“If Zachariah had told me something I think a human should not know, I would say so,” he finally announced. “He had nothing to say.”
“Yes! The smart something! We’ll go together - or we should involve Rachel - or better yet-“
From her favorite spot under the porch, Ginny leaves whatever noisome piece of long-dead hide she’s been chewing and comes bounding up.
They have to go to the far end of the river in their territory, downstream from where other omegas are washing sheets. Dean nods at a guy - Caleb? Yeah, Caleb Lobell, one of Sam’s Rancher guards on watch duty with a rifle he better not fire off randomly to scare off crows and boredom, or else Cas will have
“But since I couldn’t see worth a damn and my savior never said a blessed word, I got nothing to really remember.” Dean sighs. “I mean, I remember the dress, and the light of her hair, and I’m almost sure I remember her holding something white or silver - or maybe it was on her dress. It was thin and straight like a long cross, but it might have been a flower, who knows. All these hopeful girls bring out lilies because it’s a symbol of purity and royalty... I wish she hadn’t disappeared… But that’s okay. Even if I have to fight my way through an army of pretty women dressed in white and barring my way with bouquets, I’ll find her one day.”
“Why not?” Castiel asked, puzzled.
out there, and babies! You can’t-”
Dean and Ginny follow at a trot in the hallway barely illuminated by the light through busted panes, until Cas plunges down a set of stairs leading underground. At that point Dean puts his foot down, gathers the omega close, lights both kerosene lamps they brought, and sends Ginny sniffing out ahead. They're deep enough that there’s not much root damage and too far from the river for water infiltration to have cored the foundation, but there are plenty of other reasons this venerable font of knowledge could fall on their heads.
“Like I needed your ‘go get em’,” Dean sniffs, but the way tension leaches out of his arm and shoulders, Castiel figures Sam’s approval mattered anyway.
Cas was still facing the other way, towards where Dean had slept. Mouth dry, Dean turned so his body hid the note in case the angel glanced around.
There was a sudden movement from somewhere up the street. The angel was right there, Dean caught a glimpse of him as Castiel spun to stare up at the sky. Then he was gone in a blink of an eye.  Dean smirked and ran on. He’d have to light another rocket soon, or leave a trace of his passage, because he needed the angel on his trail. It was his duty to be chased right now, distract him and the others from Bobby and the runners.
Dean grunted. “And with dad back when he was here. Whew, I thought they’d kill each other at times, and decrees be damned.”
miss, but this bastard has a mate and he or she is lurking in the woods… Then every one of Dean’s team is gonna die hard and bloody.
Cas flashes him a smile. “In a minute, I’m just putting away the pots.”
The thing jumps just as he is about to hit it, and if an empty shell of metal could look startled at having its ambush turned on it, then this suit of armor looks startled. Dean hits it again, ignoring the click-clank-ting of the three other suits jumping to attention and rallying to their comrade. Yeah, as if he was going to wander around and turn his back on these things while he examines the room more closely. He’s not a rank novice, by god. In the line of his hunting duties, he’s been attacked by a whole range of inanimated objects up to and including a dancing, singing wardrobe, though he’d rather not remember that particular instance… Suits of armor? Coming to life and attacking intruders? Obviously this warlock hasn't been outside his tower much in the last hundred years, or he’d realize his trap is utterly passé.
“The sooner the better.” Annabelle’s gaze wanders back to the door. “Vic agrees too. I can’t- soon, it has to be soon if there’s trouble coming from the east, and I need to focus- we need - we can just focus on his recovery if- when-”
“Of course it would, I’m sure she covered her tracks before she ever showed up here, but-”
That finally gets Luke to stop ignoring him.
“You don’t understand.” Cas rubbed his eyes. “Everything I believed in... is a lie.”
The brothers stare at him. “A nephilim? A baby angel? Er, hybrid thing?”
The guy on the floor gives his strewn belongings a swift look but doesn't complain. Either Dean put the fear of god in him or… Dean himself goes over to check, moving goods brusquely aside without regards. There’s bundles of woven cloth tightly wrapped in twine, colors you don’t see around here. Fist-size oil-skin bags peek out amongst the folds of cloth, maybe the dyes used, a good item to trade. There’s some average-looking skinning knives, a small keg of gunpowder, a folder of stiff hide that contains decent-looking paper. A bag tied to the saddlebag goes clink when Charlie toes it, that’ll be the trader currency: strips of copper, tin, lead and such, as well as bits of gold and silver, turquoise and sea-shells if this guy visits packs who can afford a lil’ luxury like that.
“I have to go through them, but it shouldn’t take too long, the indexing is still readable.” Cas’s eyes fish towards Dean a little tentatively. The beta is in charge of this expedition, naturally, he’s the one who decides how long is ‘too long’.
...Maybe one of the Croats had infected him and he’d gone insane...
Then his spouse grinned raggedly and saluted as he stepped back. “Yes sir, boss, won’t say that no more. Wouldn’t want to get my ass smote.”
In which Castiel decides to make Dean’s life even more complicated, which is the best bad idea ever.
He expected caves of doom beyond the dread portal, and was rather surprised to find a tidy space the size of a large barn, a typical looking railroad waystation with benches, blankets, camp beds in a corner for potential refugees, a cheerful fire crackling in an open hearth in the center - because it turned out, it
“Yes.”
“Okay. Slow down.” Dean leans back abruptly. He looks down with a frown as if he’s only just now realized their position, and is startled and somewhat wary of it. “We gotta make shit clear. Is this okay?”
Dean looks up. Castiel looks down, hands tightening nervously on the broom, waiting for the words he’s heard most of his life, whispered at school, shouted in the street, shot at him over the internet...
“The lookouts say they saw a flash of light up in the north hills,” Victor starts tersely. “Yes,” he adds immediately, voice overriding the chorus of groans, “I’m aware of how bored they get, but you know the drill.” Just because those Rancher bastards cry wolf a lot (sometimes literally crying ‘Wolf!’ after seeing, say, a lonely porcupine cross the trail and look at them sideways) doesn’t mean the Hunter pack won’t rally. It just takes the one time for it to be real, to be real bad. Victor is not the kind to take that risk, one of the reasons he’s alpha.
“What the heck- what’s wrong with him?” He was still close enough where he could hear Sam’s confused question. Barely. He could have easily blocked out their conversation, but he found himself listening intently instead.
“Right this moment? Staring down at you in wonder. Never thought I’d see the mighty Castiel flat out on his stomach.” Balthazar had his customary amused drawl firmly in place.
Cas sighed. “I just need some rest now. It will be better in a few hours, when my Grace-“
“S'all good. I feel better already,” Dean says gruffly, his smile soft and tension leaving his body like a ripple before the water stills again. The arms uncross, fingers catch Castiel’s wandering ones, intertwine. Dean raises both their hands above their heads, palm to palm, like Israel wrestling with his angel in slow motion, and Dean’s forehead touches his gently.
“Oh right, sorry. But no, come on, isn’t there another way of breaking this curse?”
“There are only four traders there at present, and you won’t even see them. You’ll be working on the roof. Only Cas is going into the roadhouse, and beta Ellen Harvelle has been warned to keep the foreigners out of our way the whole time. You have no need for concern.”
“...Adele. This is Maurice. I’ve seen you in the barracks. You’re a Maker, right?”
Dean swallowed the first five replies that came to mind, and realized that left him nothing to say. Nothing to say, just a stray thought... that oddly enough, he kind of liked this Cas more than the Cas that had been tiptoeing around him these past few weeks. Well no, not quite true, it mattered that Cas had been patient, had tried to understand... but Dean liked seeing this side too, it was the guy who’d fought him by the well, the stroppy bastard who’d silenced him with a gesture afterwards, and who felt so strongly about Dean not being in the world that he’d lost that otherwordly calm of his.
Near the northern wall is where the king’s wake changes from organized resistance to a breadcrumb trail of bodies; most of them are the quickly-rotting corpses of once-possessed dead humans, but here and there are members of Dean’s guard. The arrow of violence points to the barricaded entrance of a barbican. There are ten demons there, hammering at the door, while two more try to breach a small high window reinforced with metal bars and boards. Their gestures are frenzied with violence, fury and impatience. They know they’ve failed. They have not taken the castle in their first deadly push, their offensive has not broken the kingdom of Lawrence, they’ve lost many of their numbers already… their last chance at a pyrrhic victory is to take down the king. They’re too maddened or stupid to realize that it’s not the door that’s holding them back, it’s the line of salt behind it. One of them does knock open the wood shutter of the small murderhole and toss something inside, but he cannot follow even in his smoked-out form due to more salt applied there. They all rage around like impotent cats around the mousehole until the last one in line notices Castiel standing right behind him.
Castiel was silent until Dean prompted him again, voice tightening with tension.
A rap on the door brought everyone’s attention there. A guard, one of Michael’s retinue, stuck his head in, gave it a shake and departed.
Castiel turned his attention back to the mechanism, following with his eyes the whorls of the spring and the sprockets. Dean seemed to drag his thoughts back from a very long distance. Castiel wondered briefly who that conversation had been about, but since Dean had told him to not mind, it must not have been important.
The head chambermaid caught Castiel’s steady look, lost two inches of height and found something very interesting to contemplate in the flagstones.
Castiel looked around the circle of faces and then back at Rufus. “You... hadn’t told them? They don’t know you were born several years before the Apocalypse?”
When Castiel doesn’t respond, Sam glances from him to his brother, a little unease starting to show. Dean hasn’t looked away from Castiel.
“Its connection to other computers. Somewhere in the world, there is almost certainly a computer that has the exact knowledge I’m looking for." Cas lays his hands on the plastic frame as if an act of grace could bring it back to life. “It might even be on the network, it could be right here at my fingertips… except that every link of that spider’s web that could have brought me that information has died and turned to dust decades ago.” Particles and fine grit lift around them and dance in the light as Cas, gestures heavy, lays the computer flat against the wood again, slips down from the counter and moves away.
… Besides, he’d spent the entire hour of the betrothment with his head spinning, unable to believe this wasn’t some fever dream. There was no way a dull, cold fish like himself could be looking at a marriage with this… this young, splendid, powerful king. Had he unwittingly walked into a ring of toadstools and found himself in some fairytale romance by mistake? One of those stories where the suffering princess or angelic prince labored under a dismal disguise, some dirty animal skin maybe, but the monarch from a wonderful far-off land could magically see past this unprepossessing exterior and still fall in love…? It wasn’t as if Castiel had nothing to offer, after all. Sure, he was uninteresting, but he was noble, well-educated, with a strong heart beneath the princely clothes that never seemed to fit quite right. He was serious, steady and true, and he was sure he could somehow make this amazing man happy if he was given the chance...
“We all been there, Cas,” he wheezes.
? This- this shit-stain? This trainwreck?!
“Bloodlines may be important, but the appearance of royalty itself is paramount, so a prince you will be! You will be
The blade twisted half an inch clockwise and now the alien look on Michael’s face, that was shock and the beginnings of pain.
“...Not the same thing?”
when I’m about to take a nap before you start kicking up a fuss?” Dean grouses.
The smile had hardened on Dean’s face, vanished from his eyes, but he seemed casual as he bent forward, picked up another ball nearby and tossed it from one hand to the other. “S’okay, I get it. I’m not about to tell you about last night’s railroad meeting either.”
“- and if everything is okay with Dean’s spleen-”
“A silver sanctified bow- And your brother is bringing it
Dean himself isn’t as sure as he’d like, but he’s damn sure of one thing: he’s not letting Cas anywhere near his kid.
Dean had the decency to put away the smile and look repentant, as repentant as he ever did which was not all that much, rubbing the back of his neck and rolling his eyes so he could glare at the corner of the room. “Shit, I know… I’m sorry, Cas. I… I should have said something, but after Dad lost mom and Kate, Sam lost his first fiancée ages ago, and I lost Lisa… Even if I didn’t feel the same way towards her, it still seems the moment one of us Winchesters bares our hearts, some evil fate snatches away the person we care for. I thought… I thought you knew what I felt, how good and loved I feel around you… Er, you do… you do care for me, even if I’m a bonehead, right?”
Dean looks at him as if he expects Castiel to say something more pertinent.
Benny kept the gun on Cas but his eyes flitted towards Dean’s, measuring the growl in that last order, and his lips quirked. “Y’know, y’r brother’s got the same temper when poked.”
Then Cas looks down, shadows from the dim fireplace light covering his face like a veil. “Ah,” he says dully. “I see I’m not as welcome as I thought. I can… I can go-”
As is hopefully clear in the story, all progress stopped back in 1836. I love that my writing hobby forces me to do research on such things as the date of creation of the trenchcoat ^___^ (In case you were wondering why Castiel is wearing a duster here, not his usual garb.) There's some historical inaccuracies here and there, particularly about the history of gun research and development in a much later chapter, but I tried to keep on target. This way I get to dress Dean up like a pre-civil-war cowboy, which I'm sure he appreciates and makes up for the fact that I otherwise have him stuck in a vegan booze-free caffeine-free angel-ridden hellhole. And I have another hammer to drop on the poor guy's head next chapter. Sorry Dean!
Gordon, he was almost sure of it. Not the Joker, or the railroad, or Charlie or Benny or any of Dean’s friends. Fucking Gordon-
“Rowena?” Castiel casts his mind back. “You mean, the witch?”
Finally, in the kind of hush you use in churches, he says: “… you found-... that?”
Castiel’s perception - wobbling on the edges from the emotions thundering through him as well as a bit of hemorrhage - finally catches up to events.
Alistair wrenches free of the hold on his right hand and steps back. They’re four feet apart now. They stare across that narrow space. There’s a red tear over Alastair’s left jacket shoulder where a shot scored him in passing and a spot of red around a hole in his lower abdomen where another shot found a home -
- was the dome, the same one they’d just entered. It was right behind them, its entrance dark, looking even smaller here in the middle of this wide open space. As Dean watched, Cas made a gesture over his shoulder, and the hole in the side of the metal disappeared once again.
“Or with any share of the care,” Charlie says, rolling reddened eyes.
That in mind, Dean dodges a stab, whips around in a pirouette and brings his sword across and up, knowing just where his prey will be but aiming not to kill, just to disarm -  whether that means sending the weapon flying or a more literal arm depends on how fast his opponent is, either works for Dean.
For his part, Castiel briefly contemplated sharing some of his own few leisure activities with his spouse, but the way Dean looked at the book in Castiel’s hands - as if the tome of poetry in an ancient language was a dead rodent Castiel had found in a trap - discouraged him before he could even open his mouth.
“Sure,” grunts Dean, ever generous, “but first things first. Let’s go kill ourselves a bastard.”
“No. Any attempt to corner these people could put Sam’s life in danger. Dean and I are going to go alone. We’ll follow this trail they’re leaving. If I need you-“
Dean doesn’t take long to think. The barrel of his rifle sinks.
Castiel lunges at her -
The hands left Dean’s skin, leaving tingles in their wake. Cas stirred. “That’s-”
“Please?” Samandriel asked, even though gathering outside at this time was mandatory for bachelors.
Sam is silent, staring at the traffic up ahead, eyes wide and unblinking.
In which we learn that a fairy-tale, like nature, abhors a vacuum, and will seek to fill in its lack of happy ending by any means necessary. Results may vary...
Dean scrutinized his expression as he walked. “Are you serious? Yeah, of course you are.”
“I see you found your Colt again,” said Gabriel, motionless with his hand outstretched.
“I see,” said Cas gently.
Dean’s breath rushes in and out. He’s frozen with his hand on the hilt.
“Here, in the sentence below the one mentioning Lucifer. I have a lot of experience deciphering faded and incomplete texts,” Cas adds as an aside.
Halfway through the angel’s description of a group of tamarin that decided to use Castiel's Lada for target practice, pelting it with - at best - leaves and twigs, Dean is fast asleep, and he doesn’t dream that night.
It gets to the point where he trembles inside when someone turns to him with that certain kind of smile. He wants to feel that red-hot beautiful flush of lust again, he really does, but he’s living in dread of finding nothing there but cold darkness instead (but there’s nothing wrong with him, really-) At this point he’s working hard at being unsociable with anyone other than his team, who know that Dean’s off limits for reasons of discipline. That way he dodges the question for a little while longer, avoids putting it to the test.
”...Cas, I repeat, it’s stuck in bone. I’d have to use a hacksaw to-“
Rain started to patter on the lean-to.
Dean freezes. The hackles of the wolf are raised, but the eyes of the human move past the ever-so-punchable Cole, skip over a scowling Benny, a smirking Tyler-
“Make sure you keep Garth and Benny with you.” Castiel still doesn’t trust these people, though they do seem to be on the side of angels (or rather, against the demons, which is close to the same thing these days.)  He breaks into a jog and goes back over the hill. The sound of battle rises all around him, a familiar knell of violence. Castiel quickly rounds up a runner and prepares the next stage of deployment, which is to bring the Hunters back in an ordered retreat to allow clear range for Sam’s forces to fully attack the horde’s flank and catch the demons in a pincer movement that will annihilate them. Dean’s normally by his side for this… but that’s alright, Castiel knows what to do. Let Dean investigate these strange crusaders that cropped up out of the north or wherever, and Castiel will carry out their plan.
Not from the look on his face, though. He’s scowling at the nail still standing half out of the wood as if he’s cross with it.
Kudos, comments and questions much appreciated :) Especially with some upcoming chapters that still need work and are busy fighting me tooth and nail *sigh*
“And how many others creeping up behind me? Maybe with a gun to my head - or to someone else’s head - forcing me to go up to you and disarm you?”
“You keep saying that. That he could manipulate the Machine.” Cas’s voice was oddly measured, even Dean had a hard time figuring out just how much emotion was crawling beneath. “How is that possible?”
Under his audience's scrutiny - Cas confused, Dean suspicious - Luke shrugs. His weatherbeaten features are still twisted in a mou of disdain. “Those lunatics are useful tools - no, no, I stand corrected, since I’m here and they’re not. They’re not only smelly, undisciplined, primitive, brutal and shortsighted, they’re also pathetic. They-”
“Hah.”
“Whoa. The old basilisk trick… What happened then?”
“No, the dragon is another story.”
There is a twitch from Cas. It’s never easy when your mate and your family get into a tiff...
“And yet you’ll still let them get away with this? What is to stop them from trying again? What if they succeed in killing you next time. Or Sam!”
When he wakes up at the odious hour of seven AM, his head is oddly clear, but his stomach feels like the bottom of a werewolf’s kennel. He gets up abruptly, irritated at this sudden human frailty he hadn’t had this time yesterday - and ends up hunched over the crapper, hurling out whatever remained of last night’s liquid comfort. Shit, drink’s not done that to him in over ten years.
Dean’s step faltered as he glanced around at the darkening landscape, then up. “Whoa, lotta clouds.”
“I swear, Cas, at the slightest sign of weakness in the ceiling-”
to the depth of his being. Dean had only ever been straightforward with him, it was the kind of man he was.
Runts are drowned.
Something, perhaps a faint stress on the ‘me’, reminded Dean that Cas was a Seraph, one of the few left, and even Michael had to be careful not to dick around with them too much; they were his front-liners if the Levis decided on a full-scale attack again. That felt like a tenuous shield right now, when faced with that power that had shaken the room just because Mike had decided to drop a word in personally.
Panic staggered over, detouring around Michael at a prudent distance yet unable to look away. Finally he squawked, threw his arms up in the air and did something with his hips that might have been a victory dance, or at least a victory wriggle.
The candlelight darted sideways and then up, and up and up and vanished. Only a faint outline of light remained to guide a panicking Castiel forward, where he found an archway breaking up the small narrow passageway. An archway leading to corkscrew stairs so narrow and tight he had to move his shoulders sideways and lean down to worm his way up. It went up two turns and then opened onto a landing. Another spring door had once concealed it, but it’d fallen off its hinges ages ago, almost invisible beneath a layer of dust. It creaked under his feet as he stepped on it.
“You got it, angel. As I understand it, while you’re down there, you’re weaker and can't bring in the cavalry. Can’t fly out, can’t call for help, can’t even use your full powers. Still wanna come?”
Dean’s eyes flickered sideways. Castiel followed his glance, saw Bobby stare at the ground, and Sam look perturbed. Rufus appeared unaffected.
“Right,” says Dean distractedly, busy not thinking about what he’s definitely not thinking about.
A swan, an actual bird? The white ones who float around harmlessly on ponds and-”
Dean chuckled, he seemed to have relaxed again. He bent and took aim, but then stopped and straightened. Sam Winchester had come walking around a corner of one of the buildings surrounding the open area. When he saw them, he did a double take.
“Yeah, they’d kill for it,” says Dean, who has good cause to know. “Right, well, I see why John stitched that hammer on your sleeve himself.”
Dean’s glare could have melted the walls of the metal dome around them, and sent the squirrel, who’d poked a cautious nose out of a knot in the tree’s boll, scurrying for cover.
“More friends coming? Awesome,” Dean said jovially. “The more the merrier. Say, Kevin... Hey, Jo!”
A flicker interrupted him. Dean twisted on himself, staring up at the clouds. It hadn’t been much of a discharge, but his eyes were round. Three seconds later, thunder rumbled.
Oh god!
‘I stopped that when I got here’ would be a remarkably weak argument. “Uriel was wrong, I have already admitted that, but he is fighting the resistance,” Castiel said steadily, weighing each word. “Dean, I know you don’t want to face this, but your railroad is killing people, intentionally or not, by letting them get to the Wilds. And that is nothing to the crimes against men and angels that the resistance itself gets up to. Uriel is trying to stop them, he is trying to protect Paradise and the people living here, and he’s… lost sight of certain moral boundaries that he should not cross in his pursuit of what he sees as a necessary cause. I admit, he should not have done that to your brother, but taking dubious moral shortcuts is something humans get up to all the time, especially the resistance. Dean, these people, if they could, would dismantle the whole system. Then you would have your bloody history back, not just you but everybody else, including those who are presently happy. Do you feel comfortable making that decision for everybody?”
“You don’t-” Dean rolls his eyes and speaks with utter assurance. “Cas, what did we say about words like that? We got each other’s back, we’re family. Fine, no need to harp on it. That’s what you meant. Right?”
“I’ll look for a piece of chalk,” Crowley whispered in the still air.
The situation was simple, really. Whatever Dean’s thoughts on the matter, it was Castiel’s mission to make sure this union was happy and free of strife.
“Um, I don’t know how. I’ve only been studying sorcery for a year. I didn’t even know this kind of magic was possible, Crowley is the one who actually created this arcana and showed me how to draw it. I know the barebone mechanics, but not enough to completely change the direction of- we would definitely need Crowley for that.”
“Omegas are the basic workforce of any community,” Cas says in a didactic tone, “providing labor without any say in the leadership of how that work is applied and what for. There’s only two ways to keep that kind of system going. Our natural passivity and the hormonal control exerted by the Hierarchy can only go so far to control us, especially since omegas tend to be the most numerous in a pack. So you either enslave them, keep them down, constantly destroy their morale with institutionalized beatings, rapes-”
“I meant if it were a man, moron,” Dean snaps, then his lips pinch. He’s not looking at Castiel, he’s walking straight onwards. Castiel follows obediently.
It could be that.
And yeah, even if they were gunning for Dean, Gordon and his men would have packed weapons that could kill angels too, just in case they got a shot at any. I hope they didn’t run into Alfie or Balthazar, was the thought that dashed through Dean’s mind too fast for his loyalties to stop and examine closely.
Dean froze with a log in his hand, blind eyes fixed on the far end of the yard as he waited for the hammer to fall. He knew what Cas was referring to. And he knew what an angel could do with that incident.
Dean took out the few things he needed from his pack and then left the latter abandoned on the floor. So far, the day was going exactly as planned. An angel had rapped on the door thirty minutes ago - waking Dean up from a deep pleasant slumber and interrupting Cas from his occupation of, it seemed, staring at Dean’s face intently all night long. Bartholomew wanted to see them. Dean noted that Bartie had sent someone rather than summon Cas mentally or send half a dozen celestial toughs; hopefully their ruse still held and the angels were trying hard to be polite with the muck-ridden human in the hopes he would quickly accept to become the Michael Sword.
me to come?”
Castiel frowns, fishing through his memory for that term among Metatron’s downloaded information.
That night, and the many, many nights that followed, clarified a few things. Yes, Dean did indeed have an appetite for men, even, it seemed, for Castiel. And the chaste prince who’d once wondered, as he grew older, if the illness in his youth hadn’t put out all his fire and truly turned him into a sinless angel, found that no, an angel he definitely was not, and he was quite happy in this discovery. His heart was still pining, lonely and confused, but at least he was enjoying the pleasures of the flesh to counter his emotional pain. Enjoying them rather a lot.
Dean glances at him, wonders if he should come down hard on the pup, but he doesn’t want to. He’s going to have to use Cole in the future, and the guy’s so prickly. Giving him a good slap will be necessary in the coming days, he knows that sure as hellfire, but not in front of everybody, no, that’d do more harm than good.
Castiel looks at him interrogatively.
Too goddamn familiar.
“Oh, get your wings unbent. The unions are there to get us to crank out babies or to give us someone you can use as leverage against us. Or both.” Dean turned away, rubbing his neck, and headed towards the door.
“No,” says Dean (almost entirely truthfully), “my question is more, was it you and another big guy my size, or was it the collective omega ‘we’ that you’re using, that covers a whole lotta tiny formats who could fit into Ginny’s spot by the fire in a bundle of five?”
“You can’t do that!” Sam shouted. “You can’t torture a confess-” he made a hollow choked noise as Uriel sent a shockwave down his nervous system.
Castiel was silent for a few seconds, then said, “I don’t eat.”
the complete guide to childcare it claims to be. But that’s a whole other ball game.
Bobby made a face at his herbal tea, then leaned back and rocked a few times, looking around. “I need to get some more tables outside at the Roadhouse,” he declared. “Ellen says proper eatin’ and drinkin’ are an indoor business, but it’s so fine of most evenings that-“
“All I know is- ” Dean’s words trip over a punched out ‘oof!’
“Right.”
Dean shakes his dad’s hand, feels the portent, the shift in their dynamic. The strength of the ol’ man’s presence, Jesus, tone it down a notch, dad, I ain’t challengin’ or nothing…
“Isn’t he… uh… we sure the baby is okay? Don’t we need… a hospital? An incubator?” Sam asks dazedly.
“They say that when it comes to the soldier’s respite, wine, women and song, the only thing anyone’s ever seen you do is sing.”
Whatever, Dean says. Or he thinks he said it. Did he say it? Everything is calm and comfortable.
Dean waves absently at Aiden, helping Garth fix one of the listing palisade posts. The snow’s melting fast, heralding the time for repairs of the winter damage.
Castiel had been on the fence about staying, but that made up his mind. “I shouldn’t keep this saved soul at the garrison any longer, we need to show his fellow citizens that nothing untoward is going on beyond this unexpected event. I will take him home, it is time for humans to sleep.” He’d let the delayed night fall ten minutes ago already. “If Naomi says anything relevant, please send me the information.”
Dean stayed kneeling for two minutes, letting the pendulum swing.
Sam looks troubled.
Rowena performed what she swears isn’t magic, but with a snip, some washing and a blanket, she transformed the
Lutecia’s self-satisfied smile slips. “Con-...? Can’t you see what you’re facing?”
“Good grief, people actually live up there?” Jo craned her neck to see past the small crowd that Samandriel and Melod had shooed out to meet the visitors.
In the background, Sam makes a rude noise.
Most of Donna’s bounty ended up in the larder, but Dean indulged himself with a cup of coffee and a slice of her pie right there, and who cared if it was three in the afternoon, it broke no decree. Actually the coffee did, so he’d let Cas understand that his absence would be much appreciated. There was something of a gray zone for minor transgressions like this, so a thing with no name had evolved between them. Dean made a minimal effort to keep his little rule breaking out of Cas’s way and Cas returned the favor by ignoring them.
“Magic is foul, I would never touch it,” Castiel snaps. The very thought of his Grace being compared to that- that parody, that sick twisted perversion-
It’s not the first time Hannah's made a pointed remark about his attachment to Sam and Dean. It’s not even the first time another angel - or demon or monster - has mentioned it either. Castiel doesn’t normally dwell on it. Sam and Dean are his charges and his friends. When they’re in danger, a frequent occurrence, he tries to help. And if he can’t do that, at least he can be there for them. There’s nothing strange about loyalty in an angel. It's what they were made for.
Ben rubbed his soggy nose on his sleeve and nodded; still upset but also triumphant as he stood on the field of battle, the vile dragon vanquished and chased off.
“Nope. Don’t even know for sure it’s a man, actually, could be a gal. My dad knew him - or her - decades ago, but he never said anything. Come on.”
The vision changes.
“You won’t make me uncomfortable.” The words caressed his lips, made them even more sensitive.
Because right now they may be in different sections, like others before, Benny and Andrea among them, but far, far back of his mind, Dean knows that unlike those others, their situation won’t last. There is absolutely no hurry, however. When Vic starts to get a bit creaky, maybe, or if he and Annabelle skip pups one season, then… well, then Cas will have to apply those lessons Dean’s been giving him from time to time - tracking, hunting, fighting - to become a beta hunter so that one day-... truth is, it makes Dean feel weird thinking about that. Him taking over as alpha was always never-never land, but thinking about it when Cas is in the equation makes it so damn real-
“Right.”
“I guess,” Dean hears himself answer.
“Calm down, calm down.” It’s a storm in a teacup, but Dean remembers not to sound patronizing or dismissive (learned his lesson last time.) Even though he can’t remember what they were fighting about half an hour ago. Cas called him a brute at the end there and a few other unflattering things - not all entirely off base, honestly, but what started it? They were talking about this new omega who’s come into camp and joined the Ranchers, and somehow it snowballed, Dean can’t quite remember how and it really doesn’t matter.
The angel went from staring at nothing to staring at Dean.
“So you do gamble. Didn’t think you had it in you.”
Dean stares at her wordlessly.
“Uh- uh, wait, um…”
“That’s the plan.” Crowley was focusing a whole lot on his decoction. “Heaven lost a lot of angels during the war, but Michael’s power is holding the spheres together. Now, if the bloody bastard flinches…”
“Oh, Dean. You’re around early.”
Giggles and a snort of “Don’t be a chamber pot!”
Castiel frowned. “This person
“Aw c’mon!” Charlie whines. “Oh fine, at least we’ll have one more for the photo album.” Click.
Crowley and Drew Neely are proof that somebody out there has somber designs on the midwest, yet any nebulous plot they might be a part of has yet to materialize. All the patrols John and Vic sent out have so far turned up nothing but dust. Crowley and Neely must be part of something bigger, stands to reason, yet the group they belong to might as well be smoke and shadows.
“...he’s not fine, we’re almost three months short of the due date, and he’s, I mean, look at him, he’s tiny and all, uh, squashed, and- and limp-”
But moments like these? Worth it.
“Cas-”
A man gets out, bowlegged in jeans and a flannel shirt with a hint of confident swagger to match. Castiel almost expects a cowboy hat. The man glances at the address… and becomes fascinated by the sight of Castiel, nice and tidy in his Hugo Boss three piece and tie, framed by the bay window and standing on his table, broom in hand.
Click-click-clickety-click-click-
More dirt is shoveled out of the hole in a flurry of sod and pebbles.
It’s not the presence of any of the others that makes Castiel break every speed limit known to man.
for… you’re looking for a mate, after all, as well as fine tuning the pecking order amongst your immediate peers. Yeah, some dudes prefer chicks and vice-versa, but that doesn’t mean they’ll kick a really good-lookin’ fella outta their bed if he happens to wander in there. Dean should damn well know. But now that he’s thinking of it, are his appetites all that representative? And with the Novak stricture on same-sex couples, this is the one area where Cas would probably know even less than Dean does. “Hmm, what about the Cuevas? They’re dudes.”
There was a moment of silence.
“Sounds like they were.” Dean grabs the paper and starts to skim over the details.
Then Cas talked for what felt like a long time - any time feels like a long time when you have an angel half crushing you down in a chair - and told Dean -... well, he said a lot, but it essentially boiled down to, ‘we both made mistakes, but to err is human, to forgive is divine and between the Righteous Man and an angel, we should have that covered. Now shut up about it, at this point you’re just needlessly beating yourself up and making us both miserable.’ He wouldn’t let Dean up again or take that mitt off of Dean’s mouth until the latter grumpily nodded agreement, and the subject has now been permanently shelved.
Dean’s still planning to beat himself up over his mistake for the foreseeable future, just not out loud. Maybe that’s why he let loose that ‘dog’ jibe, though; maybe a part of him wants to stress test this connection between them, this ever-more solid bond, just to see if Cas really meant it, if he’s not going to hit Dean upside the head with the latter’s lack of trust if push comes to shove.
That did not mean they could stop. They had a duty.
“Guess that tells me who’s higher up the totem pole for sure.”
They both turned quickly as the far door opened. “Did you find him?!” they barked as one.
Then something very strange happened.
“I’ll be right here,” Dean says quietly.
He’d probably said some of that out loud. At least the swearing. Because Cas said, “Dean?” in somewhat concerned tones (but otherwise not sounding breathless for a bent penny.)
“Nope. Sorry. But I’ll let you finish before I jump you.”
“What is going on?!”
“I don’t sleep.”
Everybody he crossed in his corner of the city seemed to be doing the same. Inis Milligan, all prim and proper in lace, asked him pointedly about Dean and Castiel as if these were any two perfectly ordinary brothers he might have. Right. All fine.
He expected a servant with a last-minute problem, not his husband. Dean hardly ever visited Castiel’s rooms. When he did, he came through the private rooms that connected their two suites, hammering on the door like he was trying to break it down, yelling something like “Cas? You decent in there?” (Michael would be ten manners of horrified at the carriage of this warrior-king, but Castiel, damn his stupid heart, found it strangely endearing.)
“Michael!”
Castiel felt a rearranging of matter on his chest; at his side, Dean jumped. A metal badge had appeared on their coats, a five-pointed star inside a circle. On the top rim of the circle was engraved the word Marshal, on the bottom was an Enochian word for patroller that Castiel hadn’t seen used since they last had a Garden, a long, long time ago.
“Yeah, you’re so very religious.”
That determination is as serious as a vow, but still he doesn’t move right away, keeps his arm around Dean’s shoulder. Dean is warm against him, breathing softly, and Robert is burbling and pulling at his father’s shirt. He still smells like apple sauce, and a bit like Dean now - and also like a coil of demonic energy, and the reek of the Mark, which is going to be a problem one day, even if a cambion will undoubtedly have the power of a Knight of Hell to control its corruption better than a human could. But that is just part of what he is. They will ‘figure it out’ as Dean would undoubtedly say.
“What did you do? When the rabbi heaved a brick at you?”
… Now Castiel pauses because the thought of educating Dean (who is a warrior king rather than a scholar) in the higher mathematics required to understand the distance between Heaven and Earth is daunting.
Dean ended up on a stile, staring blindly at the rich earth of the field before him. Crows hopped about, pecking at the new corn, and occasionally taking a break to shit on the ineffectual scarecrow.
“He looks worse than when you were hiking through purgatory.”
Until this problem goes away and he’s free...
Four days spent running, walking and hauling moose meat would send Sam’s patrol guards whimpering to bed, but Dean’s got shit to do. First and foremost, he checks Ginny over for burs, ticks, scratches and problems in the paw pads, then he cleans his gun and rifle. After that he circles around and checks his group. Finally, the day being lovely, he takes the small table in his cabin out to his front porch to savor the afternoon breeze while he has a go at cleaning and polishing his boots, a short break before the rest of his travails.
“You mean the human?”
The next half hour is full of shouting, denial, assurances by Rowena, shouting, talk of mystical texts, insults and shouting, a seer spell that casts a lightshow over Dean’s arm and abdomen which could mean anything, and a lot more shouting.
“Yes,” Luke agrees snidely. “They’re the envy of ape colonies everywhere.”
“...I can’t tell you to end Paradise, I can't make that decision for everybody. It’s not my right,” Dean finally said stonily, and looked away.
“Uh? Yes, that’s right.”
He finally manages to stop coughing and clears his throat enough to talk after a couple of tries. “...I am very confused.”
Castiel reaches for the transmission, but pauses with his hand on the knob. “Wait, what are we going to do when we find them? The mother and the child?”
And her regret was genuine when she told him that she did not think she could remove the Mark from him before it transfers completely to the cambion now rounding out his abs into a small pot belly (which Dean tries hard to ignore 99% of the time, and feels self-conscious about it when he fails.)
Dean and Sam shot each other looks of sudden concern. Castiel, who this has been specifically directed at and who had the social ineptitude of a couple of bricks, said “Thank you” as if there had been nothing odd about her tone at all.
But maybe Castiel’s faint unexplained irritation has finally reached a peak or else the temptation he passingly felt to come clean has tipped the scales at long last. Instead of ignoring the subject as he usually does, he finally comes out with his own opinion. “Assuming you ever find this person, why would you do anything more than thank them and move on?”
“...Right.” Dean isn’t great at handling this sort of thing. Beta instincts come to his rescue. If there is something troubling his omega (that is, his pack’s omega- you know what he means) then remove it. “So, you don’t need me for this bit, right? I’ll take Charlie with me and go for a walk.”
Bobby tipped back his hat, slipped his hands in his waistcoat pockets and made his way out of the junction as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Dean wondered if he’d have balls of that consistency when he got to be ninety, assuming he made it that far.
Castiel realizes he’s going to have to explain himself now, tell Dean the truth and the devil take the rules. He drags the words from inside like a weighted anchor. They are going to change everything as surely as a Lutecia would.
Balthazar’s face was unreadable again, the angel poker face. Bobby looked at him as if he’d never seen the guy before, even though Balthazar had been in P342 for well over a decade. He didn’t usually show that side of himself. The celestial being’s eyes flickered up to Castiel and there was a moment of silence.
Castiel’s focus lands on the first man, the one who just spoke. A little taller than Castiel’s current form, taller than Castiel expected (size is tricky to judge for a celestial Being existing in several dimensions), dressed in a tough hauberk covered in a surcoat of rich chestnut-brown cloth. Panels of black velvet sewn onto the skirt, lower arms and chest lend the clothes a touch of luxury, which is solemnized by the embroidered sword and rifle crossed over a field of rye, the Winchester coat of arms. That and a thin gold circlet around his brow are his only outward identifiers, not that Castiel needs those, for this is the man he expressly came to see. Dean Winchester,  the human who killed Alastair after years of a difficult campaign and great personal danger. Castiel recognizes him instantly, even though he only saw him for a brief instant and at a very large distance during a skirmish. But the light of Dean’s soul shone bright, it snared his attention and called to him… Castiel came all this way to confirm what that brief glance suggested; that this man with the shining light in his heart, however rough around the edges, is as strong, upright and tough as any angel, a true Righteous Man. Castiel came all this way just to verify this, and now he has, staring enchanted at the quality of the soul before him. Hardship has sharpened the edges of that tenacious light; there’s a faint tarnish there of a dozen minor sins cheerfully embraced; there’s mortality and a hard history and bitterness and dogged faith in the future all blended together, unique and precious. It is beautiful. It seems the guard at the gate was perfectly correct, Castiel’s met Dean - and he doesn't even have the coin yet.
Sam, riding shotgun, rolls his eyes and goes back to scrolling through his phone.
“Any idea why they did it?” he muses, and (since Cas has already told him a couple of times he refuses to speculate) he immediately answers his own question with: “Bet they wanted to be super alphas or something. Kings of the ruins.”
set up?”
“Tch, how long have you been in the army- don’t you know what that means by now? I mean for, you know. You
“Right.” Dean touches his back cautiously, lets a little twitch pass, then comes up and slides his arms along Cas’s. Dean’s chest comfortingly covers his mate’s back, a thumb massages the tension he finds in the forearm beneath his hands, the coil of muscles. After a few seconds, he feels them relax a tad. “I’m glad you didn’t get into a throwdown with Cesar. Him and Jesse… they’re alpha for a reason.”
“What is it, Ellen.”
Dean remembers how he felt after he’d been broken down in hell, started torturing souls under Alastair's tutelage. How he couldn’t see a single solitary way he was worthy of being saved by Castiel. That feeling of shame, of being a weak, breakable human who’s fucked up time and again, clings to him. The Hell Knight thing? Part of Dean believes he actually deserved that, for getting conned into the Mark by Crowley, for not finding a better way to heal Sam and take out Abaddon, for getting Kevin killed. On a bad day, of which there are still many, he can’t see how he possibly deserves his angel at the best of times, but with this clusterfuck? Thinking of revealing it to Cas makes him want to die… He reaches for the booze instead, wishing his old coping mechanism was still functional.
