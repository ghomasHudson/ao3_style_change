“and you’re going to storm in-riiiiiiight-now.” Sam was leaning on the car but dean was pacing around the car waiting for cas to come back out. See sam knew that dean and cas would get over themselves and finally resolve thier issues and-other things but for now dean was in worried boyfriend mode and was very predictable in this state, hurt cas get hurt. Seriously they are so oblivious, sam thought, wait this was supposed to be deans moment to shine, oh well, you’ll keep listening to me complain right? Sam thought now at an audience he really didnt know he had, aaaand in stormed dean, with an eye rolling sam behind him. “Hey, feelin a little left out, scoot over.” Dean said smushing into the booth next to cas who decidedly didnt move. “Oh do moove over” dean said, who was that girl-oh hermione, that’s who he sounded like, god he let cas and sam make him watch those movies, dean thought. Sam sat on the edge of the booth facing out, only a sliver of the booth was left for him so pretty much the second he sat down he got back up and grabbed a chair,
“Hi boys, hows everything going?”
“Yes you can.” Dean kissed his cheek and turned back to the pancakes. Cas waited until the pancakes were ready to be taken out before swiping one for himself, giggling.
“Pretty sure? Really that’s all you got?” cas’ face split into a smile,
“Charlie’s here.” Dean said with a smile, running off to greet Charlie.
Their lives didnt totally revolve around thier marriage though as cas had to keep miracling new bedrooms in thier house as thier family members seemed to keep moving in. Each family member had their own room, separate from their room of course, for...reasons. Most of the family had a closet full of clothes, pictures, and mementos, in their room, and claire and kaia seemed to constantly be painting. Their family spent lots of time with them as they could only spend so long away from them, but they did have thier own homes and their second favorite place was Jodi’s.
“Twigs.” Claire said as they walked out of the precinct,
“Hey Rowena!” The one Magnus pointed out as clary skipped over to them and wrapped her arms around jace,
“Please dont go.” Sam said crying,
They didnt return to the cooking until much later
“Sam I’m death.”
“Dean! Its not that I dont love you, I love you so fucking much, but I cant see you get destroyed every single time I leave. ”
“I broke you Dean, I couldn't watch you suffer because of me.”
Love you all!
“Love you Sammy.”
The next morning (Sunday) dean got up early, for a given value of got up as he could barely sleep and it really did take all his will power for only those few hours, and made breakfast, pancakes with chocolate chips on top with strawberries and blueberries in little ramekins next to each plate, and three slices of candied bacon on the side for the kids and, normal pancakes with syrup with a similar spread of fruit and bacon for the adults. Dean had let cas sleep in because he hadnt slept in days and he only sort of needed it, but as he pushed all the library tables together, cas walked up behind him and turned him around.
“Hi.” Dean said sleepily, he slowly and sleepily shifted to face Cas,
“Jack, its a vacation, you have to relax.” Donna said rubbing his back a bit,
“Thats what I’m here for.” Sam was glad dean was learning to communicate and learning that he didn’t have to do this all alone, “you’ll talk to me when you need to right?”
“Wha-no! We just started dating a month or so ago but he has to help Jack so I have seen him in forever.”
“What he said.”
“Stay for a bit?” Dean asked pulling the blanket cas put on him closer,
“I was able to put two and two together.” Cas said squinting menacingly, he was grateful dean was too absorbed by the cookies to care about the conversation.
“Where are they going to go?”
According to the couple, the group was on a road trip and hit a pedestrian, he was in a coma for weeks and was, until recently, still on life support. They spent 6 months in the town he lived in to pay for his medical bills, help the family in any way they could, they were good people but this wasn’t their first accident. Each one had gotten into separate accidents in their time in their hometown, a few drunk driving accidents, a couple were accidents where a sibling or friend wasn’t being looked after and it didn’t end well, anyway this wasn’t the first time something bad happened but every time they were responsible and did all they could to help. Though when they moved, they told no one they knew each other, changed their names, disappeared for a year between the accident and when they moved.
“What, why not?!” Dean asked looking offended,
“Bye Jodi!!” He said cheerfully, ending the phone call.
Much love
“They’re obviously looking in the wrong place.” Dean scoffed,
“Okay that ruled out vamp and werewolf. What about ghouls, witches, etc.”
“We have to go talk to the families. No clear connection, no live witnesses, nothing.”
“No I dont.” He turned away to hide a blush,
“Alright so where are we going?” Rowena asked as they walked down the busy New York streets into the bar, they had gotten a cab and driven to a bar called The Hunters Moon.
“No, nothing like that, just wondering if you’d sit with me for a bit.” Cas fidgeted, “its fine you dont have to, just wondering, g’night cas.” Dean said sadly, turning to get in bed, he didn’t even bother to change his clothes. Cas walked over to the bed and sat down next to dean.
“There were two more hits, is that a good enough excuse for you to take cas and go back?” Sam said pulling out his phone, of course he came prepared.
“No.” Dean said sheepishly, Sam put his head in his hands as Gabriel jumped off the table fuming.
“Youre sort of stuck with us-“ Claire said with a smirk,
“Bitch.”
Eileen shook her head, a bit exasperated as Sam came running out of the hallway shrieking, Dean running after him. Sam jumped onto the table and swung around the curtain rod from the bathroom. He stepped on her work and had almost knocked over her water before she got up and moved all her stuff to the room.
“What is that supposed to mean!”
“Hi honey.” Dean said sleepily, kissing Cas chastely,
They watched Pride and Prejudice and cried pretty much the entire time. Dean felt like a teenage girl, but he didnt care, he was cuddling with Cas, and they were watching a movie, and-wait...they were on the couch, watching Jane Austen, cuddling.
“I know.” Dean rubbed his thumbs over Cas’ cheeks, “I know.”
“Remember that guy you had a quick fling with that one time the world was ending? Wasnt he sweet, he was nice too. Good body, very good in bed.” Clary said,
“Hi.” Dean said leaning on the doorframe,
“Dean! I can't watch you do this to yourself, end of story.”
“Like you’re any better.” Dean said rolling his eyes.
“You haven't done anything yet.”
She placed her hands gently on his cheeks and she gasped as he not so gently pulled her into a kiss. It quickly escalated and when they finally parted, they were out of breath. Sam pressed his forehead against her’s before chastely kissing her again.
They sat down to breakfast and continued chatting, all four of them planning out a new and improved heaven.
“I’m your huckleberry.” Cas said gruffly in his best cowboy speak and smiled softly at Dean. Dean hastily wrapped his arms around Cas’ neck as the notebook fell off his knees and onto the bed, the picture however gently floated to the floor as Dean cupped Cas’ face, swearing that if he got his way, he’d never let go.
“He’s still in his room, I can go ask.”
“SAM!!!! DINNER!!!!” Meg shouted from the dinner table.
“How do you two know each other?” Gabriel asked,
“Sorry about the apparence girls-ah ladies-sorry,” he said sitting down in his chair,
“Then, yes, of course, I’ll marry you.” Cas said, pulling dean into a breathtaking kiss, he tasted like strawberries and chocolate.
“Then why did we break up? If you love me so much, then why couldn't we have gotten through this together?”
“Jerk!” Dean grabbed the newspaper from the shelf and rolled it up, repeatedly trying to hit Sam with it. Sam ducked and ran away, screaming like a little girl before finding his own newspaper. Eileen watched in amusement,
“Then why do you think you're broken?”
Cas felt Dean start to pull away, just as Dean thought he wanted.
“Claire found the case?”
“Thats an empty threat.” Alfie said in barely a whisper,
“Oh, right, yeah, um I- iwaswonderingifyoudallleavesoicanhavetheweekendwithcas?” Everyone stopped talking, stopped eating, and stared at dean,
“Um, hello I’m dean and this is cas, we just wanted to ask you a few questions.”
“All of everyone goes on trips at the same time so that cas and I can have a bit to ourselves?”
He made breakfast-brunch- in only his sweatpants, he danced around the kitchen singing Jo’s REO playlist. After the pancakes were ready, the strawberries were cut, and munched on slightly, he heard cas scream, a very un-cas like scream, so he went running back to thier room. Dean ran into the bathroom to find cas, a towel around his waist and another in a forgotten towel turban in his hair.
“No, no hex bags.”
“You think I would care?” Rowena responded with a scoff,
A day later sam stormed into deans room, very early in the morning and found cas sitting on deans bed drawing on himself and stroking deans hair,
“Hey, you want a pb&j or something?” Dean asked, cas chuckled quietly, “Whats up? Why aren’t you with everyone else?”
“yes Cas, I love you too. Everything’s going to be okay, alright? You guys didn't break up, he cant have moved on. Cas this isn't like you.”
“Sorry about this, we should let you be-“ Alec said pulling Magnus away a bit,
This stated out as just a really long fic but I added and deleted a bunch of stuff and now I think I might have a plot coming up.
Robert Singer
“Or someone already cleaned the scene.” Sam said raising his eyebrow. They walked away from teh car to save cas from the sheriff who was now talking about his wife and how they met.
“It's been three months Row, we know. That's the one question we’ve been asking, what's next purgatory falls apart?”
“He’s gone for so long sam, he rarely if ever responds, and I’m worried in too clingy. I’m a mess sam, he deserves so much better” Sam gave him a pitiful look, “Just go away alright.” Dean walked back to his memory foam mattress and pulled on his headphones, singing to the song that was playing quietly. Dean leveled Sam a look and took one headphone off, “It's fine sam.” Sam turned away thinking that maybe he hadn't really spent all this time praying.
“I don't want to leave Dean again but I will finish heaven.”
“WHAT?”
Cas, sitting up on the wall, carded his fingers through deans hair, as he sighed happily and cuddled against him,
“I’M TRYING!” Dean yelled, Sam nodded and calmly walked out of the room. Dean whispered under his breath a quiet and terrified prayer under his breath.
“I can't just be friends with you, I can't. If you make me, I don't know what I’ll do, but Cas, I cant live without you.”
Its the end, but is it really?
“I do believe you Dean.” Cas said quietly, barely a whisper,
“He’s your pizza man?” Cas chuckled at her,
“Well good, because I’m pretty sure-no I am sure, i love you too.” Cas smiled again and dean leaned in to kiss the edges of the smile, he pulled cas into a hug and kissed his neck a bit. Cas pulled away and kissed dean again, this time lifting him up and walking him down the stairs and attempting to get to the hallway, he almost tripped on a chair in the war room and they giggled, cas put dean down on the table and kissed him again. Dean jumped off the table and grabbed his hand running like an infatuated teen towards his room. Cas leaned him on the door and walked them in kissing dean and closed the door with his foot. They spent most of their break making out, watching movies, cuddling, talking, and trying to make eachother laugh and smile, oh and one more thing 😉
“All I did was get Cas back.” Gabriel nodded thoughtfully,
“Thanks boys.” Donna said sweetly,
Anyway, I hope you like it.
Bal paid for thier coffee and led Meg down the street to a bar. It was almost empty as only the day drinkers and the ones that had passed out from the night before were there. Bal tapped the bar and a very short but very cheerful man popped up from behind it,
“You’re going to have to leave again, aren’t you?”
“Nonsense, they don’t mind.” The blonde one named jace clapped both Alec and Gabriel on the back,
“It's mine.” Donna quipped back as she followed, rowena just smiled and turned back on Gabriel,
“I-I’ll be fine dean, Isham’s healed,”
“How’d you know?”
“Hey that's my look,” Jodi said walking past,
“Yeah, alright, we’ll come with you.” Sam said standing up, cas their brother-his brother?-family? Sam shook the thought out of is head and noticed cas was glaring at dean,
“He’s not abandoning me Sam, he's just helping our son. OUR son, you know the kid that became GOD!”
“Who?” Eileen answered
“Night guys.”
“Thank you love.” Dean blushed as cas came up behind him and kissed his neck. Dean turned around and looked at cas, seeing the lust and hunger in his eyes, he moved so that he had both hands on the angels shoulders and pulled off the trench coat. He swiftly and forcefully switched places with cas and lifted him up onto the counter, dean was stronger than he looked and cas was lighter.
Their lives didnt totally revolve around their marriage though as Cas had to keep miracling new bedrooms in their house as thier family members seemed to keep moving in. It sort of turned into a TARTIS, bigger on the inside. Each family member had their own room, separate from their room of course, for...reasons. Most of the family had a closet full of clothes, pictures, and mementos, in their room, and Claire and Kaia seemed to constantly be painting. Their family spent lots of time with them as they could only spend so long away from them. They all did have their own homes, but their second favorite place was Jodi’s.
“I know Dean but this isn't good for you.” Dean thought in silence, then said quietly,
“Do you think that means we can get out of here?”
“What?!”
“You’re going home Cas, now.” Jack said, Dean heard a snap and the bed sank on one end as a disheveled Cas bounced into being. It only took Dean a moment but he launched himself into Cas’ arms before he could say anything,
“Yes-no-I-“
Cas appears on the edge of the meadow watching dean sit in the middle, just feeling. He sees the emotion pouring off of dean, the colors spilling over the meadow. He watches as bubbles of emotion pours off of him, changing color with his emotions. He watches contemplating whether or not to answer the prayers. He slowly walks through the meadow to the tree and silently sits down next to dean.
“About what sam?”
“Pizza?”
They only got a few days together before Jack, who had said he wanted to leave them alone, came by. Jack walked into the kitchen and sat on the counter watching Dean cook, like he used to when he lived there full time.
Sam continued researching about the empty and the spell they used, but he found nothing as this was unprecedented like most of the things that had happened to the brothers and their family. He pulled book after book off the shelves trying to find any shred of a solution. After many hours of silent research, a few pots of coffee, and still no helpful information Dean shuffled out of his room. Sam looked up from his computer and was met with Dean, sitting on the chair across from him, face red and puffy, his eyes bloodshot, hair sticking up messily, and only wearing his undershirt and sweatpants.
Oh my gosh! Thank you all so much for reading. If you stuck with this through the long breaks and the grammar mistakes, thank you so much and if youre here because its finally finished so now you got to read it all the way through(i do that) then thank you and i hope you liked it!
One after another, angels and demons were spit back to earth, and into new and old vessels.
“Gabriel!” Magnus pulled him into a hug. As he pulled away he brushed off the glitter from Gabriel’s jacket, “how have you been?”
“I know what i said.” Sam raised an eyebrow and continued walking,
“No sam, you dont.”
“How old does that make Cas?” Sam asked more to eileen than anything,
“I’m not planning on it, but I’m sure cas would get to me first.” He says chuckling. A similar exchange takes place between sam and cas, though that conversation had been had a few times already. On one memorable occasion, after dean had yelled at cas, sam had locked them in a room together and screamed at them that they were family until they stopped fighting, he had let them out of the room only after he threatened to kill them if they hurt each other, in any way, again.
“No, it's not okay? If I’m going to be the only one fighting for this relationship then we were done before we started, but if you care so fucking much about me then why cant you stay? Why can't you just see what Jack can do? Why can't you stay with me?”
When the angel left the diner sam moved to sit across from them,
“Hey, it’ll all be okay, I promise.” Dean kissed him and pulled him into a hug before pulling him down onto the bed, entangling their legs as Cas wrapped his arms around him better.
“You think you got soft.”
“Worst idea you’ve come up with yet squirrel.” Crowley said sipping his breakfast gin,
“I’m stuck with you two for the next three weeks, I’m not dealing with this.”
“Hi.” He said sheepishly. Cas pressed their lips together and then looked fondly at dean,
“Of course. I love you too. What's wrong Dean?” Dean hastily pulled his hands away from where they had settled on Cas’ shoulders and walked away. Cas  followed him to the dungeon, he looked around confused before he saw a vampire strapped to the chair in the middle of the room. He had puncture marks where Dean had been injecting it with dead man's blood.
“One more day, what are we going to do?” Eileen asked shifting slightly so that her legs were slung over one side of the chair. She flipped to the next page in the book she was reading,
Mila burst through the doors to the bunker and behind her a container of cookies and two suitcases were floating,
“YOU AREN'T BROKEN CAS!” Dean took a shallow breath then continued, “you told me that I wasn't broken, that I wasn't the person my enemies saw me as, you said that I was the most loving human being you’d ever know. Why cant I tell you that, why cant I tell you that you are perfect the way you are, that you fought for what you thought was right even if it wasn't, you did bad things, you made mistakes, but you never changed, you were always you. You are and always will be the love of my life. Why cant I tell you you’re the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen, why cant I tell you I love you just the way you are, so you’ll believe it. Why don't you believe me?”
“If you want pizza night and a movie, you have to stop complaining, you aren’t five.” Kaia said with no anger, just fond exasperation.
“I can't stay here, I’m sorry.” A look of realization dawned on Cas’ face, “No, I have to help you finish.”
“I’m so proud of you Sammy.”
“It's okay.”
“Why did you create the spell anyway?” Sam asked,
“Hello Dean.”
“Okay so we go talk to the vics freinds and relatives, see if they know anything.” Cas nodded and strode out of the door, shutting it behind him. Dean grabbed the coffees, pastries, and cas’ trench coat and walked over to the door, patting his pockets to make sure he had everything. The door swung open just as dean was about to open it,
“Dean we’re sure this is a witch right?” Sam asked, turning to face dean who insisted he keep driving,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cas?” Dean called out to a seemingly empty house, “Cas?” He called again, this time cas walked down the stairs and around the corner with two swimsuits, a bottle of whiskey, hand cuffs, and a few pairs of flip flops.
“You think I’d know?” Gabriel asked, raising an eyebrow, “You did this didn’t you.”
“You’ll have to tell me about it.”
“No.”
“Yur a wizard Harry.” Eileen said with a mock Hagrid accent and they dissolved into childish giggles. They kept walking as sam talked about how he was too old to go to hogwarts, he had finally worn himself out as a bunch of red headed small children ran past them, two of the children smashed right into them,
I love you ❤️
After talking to the couple for a few hours they managed to find out where the last surviving two of the group were. They drove there and found a seemingly abandoned house, they knocked twice then dean started to pick the lock,
“Yes please.”
“I did this to you.” Cas said sad realization dawning on him,
“You couldnt wait for me?” Dean said laughing as he sat down and stole a piece of bacon back from claire who had attempted to steal it from his plate.
“Im not either!” Jack squawked as he fell off the bed.
“I got it, you guys go plan and get ready, anyway I have a way of doing things.”
I think there will be three more chapters. I hope you liked this one, kudos and comments are always appreciated! Have a fantastic day!
“Would you believe it if somebody else told you?” when Cas didn't answer Dean sighed and turned away,
When they got home, Sam and Eileen retreated to the store room while Dean dragged Cas to his room and practically threw him against the wall. He looked at him for a second before kissing him senseless, Dean barely registered the lightbulb on his side of the bed shatter. He pulled off his jacket and helped Cas out of his as they walked to the bed, still connected at the lips, toeing their shoes off. Dean pushed Cas into the bed as he placed himself over him, he pulled away for just a second, smiling at how Cas chased his lips. Dean started to work Cas’ tie off, kissing Cas’ neck, he managed to get the oddly tied tie off but he pulled away all the way this time. He sat over Cas’ legs, his hands on Cas’ chest looking at him, they had been dating technically for a little more than a month but even still, without the trench coat, suit jacket, and tie, he looked very scantily clad. Similarly, Dean in only his undershirt, instead of his many many jackets and flannels was slightly new to Cas.
“What!?”
“Sam!”
“Really?” Cas said rolling his eyes and then nervously glancing at dean who seemingly hadn’t noticed the writing showed up on his palm too.
“How very nice to meets you Rowena, this is my husband Alec, that’s clary and Isabella, and jace is the one playing piano, simon is the one singing and playing the guitar.” Magnus said pointing to each one.
“What about him?”
“Im tired but i cant fall asleep.”
“Cas I- I think i like you.”
“Wait yes? That was a yes?” Sam asked maybe louder and more surprised than he should have been,
“Oh go talk to Ian, red head, tall, looks like a cinnamon roll, will actually kill you. He lives with his husband, looks like he’ll kill you is actually a cinnamon roll. I set them up too, anyway here’s the address, give me your hand.” She said grabbing his hand and writing the address on his hand,
“The ‘oh I’m Sam winchester, I can waltz in here all innocent even though I was the one who started this all!” She said, losing her Sam impression by the end as she shouted at him.
At that Cas sat up again and looked at him quite seriously,
“I’m going hands off remember?”
When dean awoke, cas was still with him, not asleep but thoroughly zoned out.
“I love you too.” He whispered.
“I love him and he's gone again.” Gabe looked confused and turned to properly face Dean,
“Cas, it’s our anniversary, sort of, still havent gotten used to the time, but you didn’t have to do all this.”
“i love it when you call me husband.” Cas said smiling. He went and opened the door, even though it was already unlocked.
“Hi.”
“Why?”
“You’re my best friend cas.” Cas gave him a heart breaking look, “no no no, that’s not what i meant, i meant that you’re my best friend and i dont want to ruin anything and-“ dean stole the pen back and furiously wrote three words on his palm.
“So what you’re just gonna keep walking past eachother in the kitchen and not saying a word?”
Dean was in the kitchen getting out some ice cream when he heard a knock at the door,
“Hello dean.”
Dean walked through the bunker doors behind cas, carrying their bags and shouted at Sammy that they were home. Sam walked out of the library carrying a book,
“Inturuppting moose.”
“I was doing the right thing,” cas walked into the war room sounding pissed,
“So are you.” Cas said walking to Dean and pushing him against the wall gently. He hovered his lips over Deans, feeling Dean shiver against him as his breath ghosted over his lips. Cas smiled and pulled away, grabbing his hand and dragging him to where Sam and Eileen were.
“Forgot something?” Dean asked, holding out the coat and cas’ phone.
“Bobby said you helped.” Dean said, steadily ignoring the heat rising in his cheeks from cas’ arm pressing against his,
“I killed a bunch of those assholes in the empty and now we have to figure out how to kill them again! “
In heaven, things would be different. Under the knew god, things would be different. Now sam could live happily ever after, he could leave hunting, marry Eileen, have kids, a white picket fence. Dean looked out over the river and felt the life drain out of him, he was dead, he couldn’t die again. He felt a presence behind him and his heart fell out of his chest. He put on a brave face, concealing the horror he felt,
“I-what?” Rowena asked confused.
“Can we kill them yet?” Kaia asked thumbing through the witch killing bullets in the purse,
They had finally made it back to a bedroom, it was Sunday, cas got back late Friday, time flies when you’re having fun huh? Dean was curled up against cas again, asleep and peacefull but still holding tight to cas. He buried his nose in deans hair and pulled him closer to him. They were happy, finally.
“Wow, I didn’t think of that.” Dean said sarcastically.
“Cas, its our anniversary, sort of, still havent gotten used to the time, but you didnt have to do all this.”
“Yep.””
“I wouldn’t do that.” Jack said genuinely concerned that Cas actually thought he would, he continued to look at him before realizing, “just a saying?” Cas nodded, smiling,
“You’re sneaking around now?”
“Should we just try to break out, we probably could.”
On the second to last night before Cas and Jack were going to leave, they found themselves in the library, sitting on the cushy leather arm chairs Dean had brought out from storage a while ago.
“We are going to the Field Museum First, its only 30 minutes away from the house and we dont have to stay long, but I’m going to make this a relaxing vacation if it kills me first.” Kaia ignored Claire’s grumbling and pulled her out of the Uber and up to the front desk of the rental car place, “Carry Bradshaw.”
“Jace just gets like that sometimes, where’s Fergus?”
“What are you doing?” Jack asked yawning,
“Alright, alright, we get it.”
“We don’t even have a case, what are we going to do?”
“i thought i told you to come alone.” The angel sitting across from teh boys said, dean barely could control himself, he wanted to beat him to a pulp just for loooking at cas like that, like he was the scum of the earth, like he was a ‘hairless ape’, that’s what bal called it right? No one snarls at cas, no one tries to double cross or hurt or-anything his angel dean thought,
“Not a witch then.”
“Dammit Cas.” Dean said to the empty room, tears falling silently onto his cheeks.
“I don't want to kill you.”
“Told you!” Clary clapped her hands, “You owe me twenty bucks.” She said to Izzy and simon,
“You deserve it.” Dean said, his voice muffled from where his face was pressed against Cas’ shoulder,
Sam and eileen walked out of the little London restaurant hand in hand. Sam led them on a stroll around London, not the whole of it of course, but his tall, eileen can walk for a long time, it works out. They passed shops and cafes and sam looked at everything with admiration and awe, he was like a kid in a candy shop-How’s he going to act at the book shop?- Eileen wondered, she pulled him into different stores and cafes and they always came out with atleast one more bag.
“Hungry, you can wait a bit right?” Dean grudgingly shook his head,
“We’ll let you out when you’ve talked!”
“What is like me? Angels don't sleep, angels don't eat, or drink, or love, or heck god doesn't sleep. What happened to the universe. In every other one, Dean and I weren’t together, maybe we aren’t meant to be together, maybe we are meant to be friends.”
“I dont-I dont quite remember.” Sam chuckled a little. Crowley walked in carrying an empty bottle,
“Many.”
“Just a-no, you cant get me to do that.” Claire pursed her lips in defeat,
“Yes dean, I know. Point?”
“They’re your family too, even if you didn’t spend that long with them.”
“Probably something neither of us want to know about.”
“I-I dont know.”
“I guess that is pretty cool.” She said as she sipped her drink.
“We have two.”
Anyhoo, I hope, if anyone cares, that you can accept this apology and look forward to the impending chapters. You might have to stick with me through some craziness but I hope I can promise that I will go out with a bang.
“Hey dean?” He asked as dean was about to turn away. Dean put his hands back behind him on the counter again and looked at sam, “Other than for obvious reasons-god we’re children-“ he said as dean snickered,
“Why do you need Cas?” Sam asked from the table where he was watching with a smile.
A tired writer
“You won't, I know you won't.” He kissed his nose before clasping their hands together again and walking back out to the party.
“You spent weeks after he died that time stabbing things constantly.” Izzy continued,
He made breakfast-brunch- in only his sweatpants, and danced around the kitchen singing along to Jo’s REO playlist. After the pancakes were ready, the strawberries were cut, and munched on slightly, he heard Cas scream, a very un-Cas like scream, so he went running back to their room. Dean ran into the bathroom to find Cas, a towel around his waist and another in a forgotten towel turban in his hair.
Yay, next chapter, watch the next 2 chapters show up all at once. Hope you like this next part.
“Yell if you need help.”
“Heh, baby, you’re leaving in the morning, you could get some sleep?”
“I know when all meteor showers are supposed to happen, i can feel each star as it comes into the world and when it dies-“
“Well for one, I get to kiss you now, and cuddle with you, and we can go on dates, and be a cute couple, and-I’m getting ahead of myself aren’t I. I don’t want to pressure you.”
“No but I do, that can't be nice for you.”
“Jeez just wait.” Sam crouched down and placed a kiss on Eileen's lips, “Sorry.” He said in a cutesy voice, she patted his cheek and then seemingly out of nowhere smacked the back of his head. “I deserved that.”
He paced around for hours trying to clear his head, trying to avoid punching yet another hole in his wall, when he collapsed on the floor. Nothing serious, just done. He laid there, his back against the cool floor, his arms and legs sprawled out, and he felt tears pass the walls he had tried to build up to protect his facade. He curled on his side on the floor, his body wracked with sobs, and finally as he sobbed on the floor he prayed. Just a quiet mantra of sorts to begin with,
“I just-I love them all so much and I was so horrible to them, and then i died for them, and those kids-oh those kids, theyre just wonderful! Did you know that dean was thinking about adopting a kid at some point. He already has jack and the rest of them but of course that silly man with such a big heart would want to pick up any stray kid he saw. Krissy dropped by the other day, you know, and dean made her and her boyfreind breakfast and grilled him on the relationship. He did the dad stare until the poor boy was practically shaking. Hes such a perfect person, and then Sam! Oh sam!”
“No this is-personal.” Oh well that wasnt-nope-not what he should have- that will only make dean grumpier, sam thought,
“What Dean?” Cas said tiredly,
This is getting long so I’ll wrap it up. Last thing, I have a ton of WIPs and if you’d like I could think about finishing them up and posting em. Let me know.
“Oh that star you saw cas, wasn’t just a star. You’ll find your person soon enough, though it seems like you knew that already.”
Dean woke up and rolls over expecting to find cas only to meet a cold, empty side of the bed. He jolts up and grabs his gun from his nightstand drawer, old habits die hard. He runs around the house, panicked and no longer tired, it only took him 10 minutes but even that was too long. He found cas standing in their kitchen humming to himself, his speaker playing quietly, as he tries to make breakfast. He looks up as he here’s the quiet click of dean placing the gun on the counter, he didnt look up from the pancakes but could feel the worry coming off of dean.
“Cas I know you’re not fine.” Cas gave him his bitch face, and scowled a bit,
“Breakfast?” Dean asked cas, walking into his space and just barely barricading him against the counter, he dragged a finger along cas’ jaw making him shiver. He started to pull away but cas grabbed deans t shirt and pulled him into a quick kiss.
“Cas you already destroyed him.”
“No.”
“Mostly, having a nurse for a daughter comes in handy.” Jodi laughed a bit,
“I see what you mean.” CAs said looking over his glass at dean. “Alright, night honey.” CAs said kissing the back of deans neck as he walked out.
The couples around the table turned to one another and engaged in differing pda, cas separated from dean and said.
“Anyhoo, the whole empty thing is quite unhelpful.” Donna said,
“Yeah you guys must be idiots.” Gabriel said as he walked away laughing to himself. Dean continued to look sadly at the place where Cas had gone,
“So are we?”
“Is he appealing?”
“Two can play this game.” Cas whispered, his breath playing over deans lips making him shiver. Dean then snaked a hand around cas’ neck and crashed their lips together, leaving no room for teasing or games.
“Ready for movie night?” Sam asked as dean grabbed his and cas’ coat, along with a large container of cookies. They got into the Impala, dean and eileen in the front seat, still sharing ice cream, and drove to jodi’s.
“What do you mean?”
“I have to go, I have to tell him I love him, that I’m not going anywhere, not really.”
Its been 12 years since Dean was raised from hell and put together again atom by atom. 12 years since Castiel fell for a human. Its been years since Cas noticed he had renounced heaven for dean, years since he figured out that he was no longer an angel of heaven, he was deans angel, deans protector. It’s been years since Dean noticed he loved his best friend, years since he’d decided to squash his feelings away in a dark corner. It has been almost a decade since Cas betrayed dean, since Cas crushed Dean’s heart. Its been 8 years since the leviathans killed Cas, 3 years since Lucifer killed him, 12 years since he died the first time. Time and time again they were killed and resurrected, death was never final. They had been there for each other through everything, they broke when the other died, cried when they came back. They’d come back so many times, they never thought that one day it would be permanent. After 12 years of friendship, of unrequited love, of pining and longing gazes, of bitching and hugging, of dying and living, after 12 years together, they knew never to take eachother for granted. That didn’t mean they were prepared for when death did stick. They never thought they’d have to. Death was an idea, it was something that happened to other people, you can’t die if you’ve already been dead, right? They learned the hard way that they were wrong. After 12 years of being practically married, 4 years of raising a kid together, after betrayals and redemptions, after grief and comfort, after everything they’d gone through they didn’t get the life they deserved. Dean had died so many times but he never dwelled on the thought of a world without his angel because he couldn’t. Cas had died many times too, yet even living since the beginning of time, he couldn’t bare to think of a world without his hunter. Neither wanted to see the other die and yet they both would, they’d both live in a world without the other. Dean would see Cas sacrifice himself yet again for him, and Cas would see Dean die for the world he loved, and yet maybe there was still hope...or maybe not.
“So...”
“Hello dean.”
“I dont think we have the type of mom who will stay home and make us chicken soup for dinner.” Mary winchester had said she’d ‘got it’ when she rushed back into hunting after Billie almost reaped her and of course dean was worried, sam was too but if she said she was fine, she was fine. “Talk to cas yet.” Sams expression softened as he asked,
“Cas. Go. Home.” Jack groaned pulling Cas back to standing position and turning away as he disappeared.
“Do you looove him?” The three said one after another,
“Only one body was recovered in the last 20 years, a woman named Rosalind Webber.”
“I am not whipped.”
Finally in nicer clothes, a flannel, a tee and jeans for dean and cas’ usual get up without the trench coat.
“I am in no way going to apologize, and what? Did you think I was going to deal with your pining until you got your shit together? Hell no!”
Meg and bal arrived at the airport, took one look inside at the hoards of people and turned tail. Bal grabbed her hand and they disappeared, landing in Paris under the Arc de Triomphe.
“Somethin like that yeah.” Cas smirked, grabbed his hand and walked out to the kitchen,
“Yeah, yeah. You can’t take me on anyway!” He yelled, swinging the curtain rod out in front of him like a sword and putting the other hand on his hip.
“Years Dean!”
For a life of suffering, they all deserve an afterlife of rom coms and family dinners and weddings and happiness, and after everything they’d gone through they didn’t get the life they deserved. That never meant they couldn’t get what they deserved in the afterlife, that didn’t mean they couldnt get their happy ending-or shall i say, beginning.
“Um, yes, who are you exactly.” Dean asked still standing confused,
“Yes. Yeah, I love him. Dammit, I do, I love him. How did that happen.”
“Sam, just stop. I’ll talk to him when he gets home.”
“And?”
“You kissed me!”
“We aren’t starting the meeting just yet apparently.” Jack said, walking into the library and hugging Sam and the others.
“Sorry about them, they never remember that you all can still be bowled over.” He chuckled and was ushered away by a curly haired women and another red headed woman.
“He made a deal Sam and the empty-it took him-and Billy- he sacrificed himself for me.” Sam pulled his brother into a hug,
“We’ll look into it, thanks Jack.” Sam said sweetly,
“One hour till we get to the airport.” Sam said biting his lip a bit.
“Well then,  who is this?” Magnus said changing the subject,
“Hey dean, whats all this about a trip?” Balthazar asked with his mouth full, what, he liked champagne didnt he, of course he had a soft spot for breakfast foods,
“We never got a proper honeymoon so i decided now is as good a time as ever.”
“Sure, what ya makin?”
“That's the thing sam, I’m not desperate, and he doesn't want to come back. He;s happy helping jack so we can keep it that way. I’ll ask him if he knows anything and that's it. K?” Dean asked getting up abruptly from the table and going to his room.
Dean scoffed, “Bitch!”
“Then bad ones can get out.” Dean said,
Jody Mills
“We get that a lot, good genes I guess.” Kaia said sweetly as she flung an arm out to stop claire from tearing the man apart, she smiled at her and then continued, “The case?”
Jack Kline Winchester
He appeared on the war room table, where Dean and Sam were sitting, startling Dean enough that he was sent flying off his chair. Sam chuckled as Dean scrambled up to standing again.
“I will, I promise.”
“Ah Magnus, good to see you again.” Gabriel said to the glittered man,
“Hiya Sammy.” He said, he turned and hugged his little brother and tried to conceal how horrid he felt, how angry, how sad, he felt that his brother didn’t get all he deserved.
“You bought me a book on boat building, of course I didnt read it!” Rowena said avoiding the obvious question in their words,
Time is different here, in heaven a sun and moon rise and fall but on earth seconds or years go by. On earth it could have been two seconds or twenty years, but Dean and Cas didn’t care. They lived together now, as Cas spent most of his time at Dean’s house anyway. He had officially moved in a while ago, but they still hadn’t gotten used to it.
“Yeah, like come on, i love you so much, and we already bicker like an old married couple. I just want to marry you so badly, because-well because we can and, cas, we have all of eternity.”
Sam was always concerned when Cas left Dean, for many reasons but the most prominent was when it got bad enough, Dean wouldn’t leave his room for days and when he did he’d be mumbling a prayer under his breath all day. This time when Cas left, Dean had hoped that he could make it through, he’d managed it once, but alas life doesn't ever seem to be on their side. Dean hibernated in his room for two solid days and on the next three, only came out to eat and collect more beer to take to his room. It got to a point where Crowley would buy fancy liquor and leave it at his bedroom door so that he would stop drinking swill. With the bunker so full, the worry spread like wildfire. Every couple of hours a different person would come to try to coerce Dean out of his room. The farthest they got was a mumbled ‘go away’ and the door opening a crack to accept cookies and a burger. After five days of moping Dean still hadn’t come out of his room for any length of time so Sam decided it was time to go in. He knocked once and then quickly picked the lock, bursting into his room before he could get off of his bed.
Joanna Harvelle
“Did you-“ Jodi asked,
After late lunch they watched tv for a bit, dean sitting on his bed and cas on the other, both trying to ignore the tension. Dean looked at his watch, got up and grabbed his coat and keys. Cas turned off the tv and followed him out the door.
“Dude, you cant just say stuff like that.”
“Yeah sure, I’ll check with the mom of the first Vic, she wasnt telling the whole truth-“
“She said it’d have cosmic consequences, do you know what that means?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Clary how wonderful to see you! You have to pop on by sometime and have tea. I’m at the bunker with the boys now but feel free to show up unannounced they love that!” Rowena said smiling and pulling clary into a hug,
After weeks of cases and research and new arrivals, of visits from Cas, and smaller breakdowns from Dean, and quite a few hunts, the boys still had no leads. They had created quite an army of old allies and acquaintances and they had been popping around the world locating and tracking all their previous kills, with seemingly nowhere to go that was their best bet. Dean prayed to Cas every night, telling him about his day and anything that was on his mind. He liked to think that they were like little love letters, so by the end of each he’d get sappy and cute and address it with things like
Cas watched them appear on his own palm and drew a little heart next to the same words. He watched as dean smiled and closed his hand, dean closed his eyes, shook his head, then opened his eyes and looked at his hand.
“That pocket watch the last two of the group had, its in the picture they have of him in the newspaper article.”
“I don’t mean it literally. Did you get my point?”
“Just trying to help.” Dean put his head in his hands, his breath coming in short breaths. Sam ushered him to his room and sat him on his bed, “Breathe Dean, breathe.”
“Hey!” Sam said from the chair across from Dean. He was sitting oddly close to Eileen and his hands kept twitching from where they were clasped in his lap. Dean gave him his bitchface and continued,
“do you?” Clary asked, more sincere this time.
“Jerk.” He said as he sat down to read. “There’s a new case by the way.”
“No. You are coming back here and we are talking about this!” Cas shouted at him,
“Hell no! I’m going to look into those cases. We haven’t been on a case in weeks, I just want to punch something already.” She half signed half spoke, Sam looked at her fondly and this time Cas gave him a bitchface.
“Yes, he is technically. He fell.”
“Sam he said it.” Dean said still crying, Sam nodded knowingly and continued to hug him.
“We are doing it the old fashioned way, its more fun.” Jack looked to Alex to see if she agreed and she nodded without looking up from her computer. Jack then settled into his chair and closed his eyes,
As they walked through the doorway from the kitchen to the hall, Dean stopped to kiss Cas lightly. Cas responded by pushing dean against the door frame and kissing him, quickly licking past Dean’s lips. He threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair a pulled gently, Dean groaned into his mouth while working Cas’ shirt off. He separated from Cas, leaning against the doorframe further, smiling as Cas chased his lips, he licked his lips and stared at Cas’ chest, then his eyes flicked back to the angel’s lips. He pulled him back into the kiss, and hummed appreciatively as Cas kissed down his neck, pulling back the faded band tee from his shoulders.
The end
“knock knock who’s there?’’
“Yes, I’m coming with.” Cas said laughing, “I’m going to bed, you don’t blow the house up.”
They had dinner and discussed the fruits of thier labor, it seemed that each of the vics were involved with accidents that left someone dead or gravely injured, dean had talked to the mother of the first of the vics and she told him about how each of the current vics had moved to the town together years before.
“Hi.” Cas wore a dopey smile and kissed him again, much less chaste, he ran his tongue against the seam of Dean's lips and Dean moaned quietly as he opened his mouth slightly. He propped himself up and positioned himself over Cas then pulled away, now much more awake. Cas pulled him back into another kiss but Dean made a sour expression and Cas tilted his head, “What?”
“I’ll only be gone a bit, k?”
“Sorry I wasnt there.” He said quietly as dean wrapped his arms around cas from behind and kissing his neck.
“Meeting adgourned.” Jack said, pronouncing the word wrong,
“Are-are you okay?”
“I-i dont know, you guys live here now, its not fair to kick you out.”
After the most awkward two hours in his entire life, consisting of dean barely talking, cas ignoring dean and also not speaking, and sam barely not taking out hi pocket knife to try to cut the tension, he finally got them to atleast talk to him.
***They got back to the bunker ready to sleep for the next three days. Dean still hadnt come down from his protective mode completely and sam was still reeling from cas’ allowance of lily killing him if neccessary, though beers, beers would help.
“Oh yeah um here.” Dean took out the notebook he kept in one of his many pockets. Chuck materialized a pen and handed it to him, he wrote down about a dozen names and handed it back to chuck. “Thank you.”
“have not.”
“I’m sorry.” Sam wispered, pulling away from dean, then he said in his normal voice, “have you seen everyone yet?” They got in the car to do their rounds and talk to their enormous family.
“So you want us out of the house, together?” Rowena asked,
The obligatory kudos and comments line :)
“What the heck are you doing?” Sam said, making dean jump,
“I’m so confused.” Dean said turning to cas, Who rolled his eyes,
“You know when i knew Castiel he was a warrior, a soldier, he was an angels angel” dean looked at the angel in distaste,
“The bitch is fine. Shes on a date with little old Gabriel.”
“Not now Claire.” She snapped as she signed a couple of documents and then dragged her by the hand to the car. Caire leaned over and kissed kaia lightly before she turned teh car on,
A classical rendition of Stairway to Heaven plays in the background of Dean and Cas’ first dance, as they sway back and forth, their arms around each other. They fit together perfectly, Dean’s head on Cas’ shoulder, his arms around his husband’s neck, while Cas burries his face in Dean’s neck, holding him close. After the song ends, they part slightly, foreheads resting together, basking in their happiness. Dean places a gentle kiss on Cas’ lips and pulls away, their hands clasped between them. The next song plays and Cas gets pulled away by Mary, and Dean by Ellen. Each mother figure gets a turn to dance with both of their boys, and no one complains, though Rowena hogs Dean a bit, and Jodi just rolls her eyes and twirls him away from her. After Jodi, Donna, Rowena, Ellen, and Mary have danced with both Cas and Dean, Bobby shuffles over to the dance floor and pulls them into a hug. He grabs Dean’s shoulders and yanks him away again as Sam steals Cas.
“Sorry I wasn’t there.” He said quietly as dean wrapped his arms around Cas from behind and kissing his neck.
“IM TRYING!” Dean glared at him and crossed his arms, “I’ve already told you, I love you so damn much, but you don’t need me. You dont need me dragging you down. You don't want me breaking your heart every time I leave. I liked not having you because I was the only one getting hurt. Now I can hurt you and I don't want to hurt you!”
“Where are they going to go?” Dean said frantically,
“I get to help with the wedding!” Eileen said, only barely keeping her composure,
“I don't know yet, I’m figuring it out though, because the vamp died normally once I did the wave thing, but I destroyed the shifter.”
Arthur Ketch
“Purgatory.”
“Flustered! I would never!” Dean exclaimed sarcastically. Cas  wouldn’t let him escape though so with one hand wrapped around deans wrist, cas pulled him back within reach and gave him a look so filled with love and lust that dean could almost melt. Instead he placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders and waited with one eyebrow raised. Cas leaned in and pressed a kiss onto the corner of dean’s mouth,
“I just bought souvenirs for the family-residents of the bunker in which i begrudgingly live-and am now sitting in a coffee shop that smells of leather and college essays. Of course I got soft.” Samandriel just hummed and sipped his coffee.
“We need you to reverse the spell.”
“Hun can I get another glass of whiskey, I have to talk to these three nosy little bastards.” She said with no venom in her voice. Gabriel nodded and took the glass from her,
“What are we going to do?”
This time Cas didn't come back, Dean didn’t speak to him, and Dean moved on, sort of. He stopped moping and put on his mask of happiness, and cooked, and cleaned. He went on reckless hunts and drank too much, but he always kept himself under control. His will to live had burned away, but he would do his best not to show everyone that. When Cas finally did come back, heaven was finished and Jack forced him to take a break. They avoided each other like the plague for a few days but after a week Dean barged into Cas’ mostly empty room,
“Need to rebuild heaven, need help.” He said with his mouth full.
“Good morning dean.” CAs moved to get off the bed and let dean have his space. Cas hadnt meant to stay all night and into the morning, but he got sidetracked in his thoughts.
“You get used to it.”
“You. Quite.” Dean mumbled and then pulled away again making cas whine. Dean shook his head again, “They’re going to be here soon, cant.” Cas nodded and ran his thumb down deans jaw and smiled when he leaned into the touch.
“No!”
“Dean!” Cas shouted as he ran through the halls of the bunker, “sam where’s Dean?!” He practically shouted in Sam’s face. Sam jabbed his thumb towards Dean's room, Cas nodded and ran to the door, “Dean, can I come in?”
Crowley collapsed into the velvet chair in the corner of the cafe and heard a small squeak. He looked up and saw a very terrified angel in a red and white stripped hotdog stand uniform.
“He’s got a point dear, he cleans after all of us almost everyday.” Eileen remarked,
“another angel called out for help and it just- stopped. I need to know if he’s still alive.”
“He’s a demon.”
“No, you know what, no, for once do a normal hunt not one that’s crazy or emotional or has someone you care about getting hurt, I’m going alone to help Jodi, you and cas are finishing the case.” Dean sighed and sat on the bed,
“Okay, say its a ghost, all that does is make our lives easier.” Dean said looking back at the street and maneuvering the car into a parking space. They got out of the car and dean checked his pockets, caught the badge sam threw at him, and tucked it away. Sam tossed cas his badge and straightened his jacket as they walked across the street to the crime scene.
“He killed Billie to protect us, to save mom.”
“A while.”
When Dean had let everything out, every memory, every emotion, everything, the colors floated around, filling the meadow and coloring the flowers and grasses around them. Cas touched Dean’s arm and watched as Dean stared in wonder at the colors he could now see. Cas got up to allow Dean space as the prayer had gotten quieter, not silent but quiet. Dean stood up with him and out of nowhere pulled cas into a hug, not a platonic pat on the shoulder and handshake kind of hug but a meaningful, chick flick hug. Dean’s arms where wound around Cas’ neck, while Cas’ were around deans waist. Dean pulled away slightly but didn’t loosen his grip on the angels neck, he looked at him, looked straight into the ocean of blue that he easily got lost in. Cas met Dean’s piercing green eyes and saw the emotions behind them, the thoughts, the feelings, but he couldn’t quite place them. Dean saw the flicker of hope in the angels eyes that quickly faded into sadness, to pity. Dean dropped his gaze and turned away, his hand trailing down Cas’ arm as he did. As his hand reached Cas’ wrist he felt Cas yank him back around, facing him. They stood close together, still staring into each others eyes, Dean had planted his other hand on Cas’ chest when he spun. Cas still held deans wrist with one hand and the other was gripping his waist. He held dean’s gaze and broke down his walls, letting Dean see everything he was feeling in that moment and pressed a tentative kiss on his lips. Dean just continued to look at him, slightly shocked, then he grabbed Cas’ face with both hands and pulls him into a heated, open mouthed kiss that didnt break for quite a while.
“What? We beat up a bunch of assholes who were attempting to assault a couple underages.” Sam let out a breath,
HI! Did you like it? I dont care either way, I write for me but I always love it when people enjoy my writing even when its a bit meh at times. :) Have a splendid day!!
“he’s gone sam, he’s gone.” Dean said, his face red, his eyes shining with tears.
“what do you want to know?”
“All of them, sam, Eileen, jack, claire, Chrissy, aiden, bobby, Ellen, everyone.”
“Are you okay?” Eileen signed.
“Swim suits on everyone! Beach time!” Donna called cheerily from the other room.
“You’re very pretty.” Cas blushed and dean twirled around and walked over to cas. They were planning to make cookies and dinner for thier family for the night, but this derailed all thoughts of cooking from cas head for a bit.
By the time they decided to get out of bed it was late afternoon, their family and freinds would be back soon so dean put on his best pajama pants, these ones had little ghosts on it, sam thought they were funny, and wandered out of their room. When cas glanced at him, he did a double take and cas gasped a little,
“You two have been pining for years and you finally get together, and now you wonder if he loves you?! Of course he does.”
“Dude, come one.”
“That wasnt how i intended to do it, but I-uh- sort of hoped it would be gone by the time you got done.” He said looking at the ground,
Cas and dean walked out of the room and back into the kitchen where chuck, amara, and jack were in one corner talking, Ellen was sitting with her feet on Bobby’s legs across from her giggling, eileen and sam were still inseparable but now they were giving eachother fond looks and sam leaned down to kiss her, rowena was making the fire turn different colors while Kevin and jo watched fascinated, and Crowley and charlie were sitting on the counter. Dean smiled at his family, then at cas and he intertwined thier fingers and walked in to the middle of the great room,
Dean got up and limped after her, he was getting old after all and he had quite unceremoniously collapsed on the floor. Not paying attention, he ran into Eileen almost sending her flying. Who was he kidding, he could have ran her over with a car and she’d still be standing there, rooted in spot staring at Sam from across the room. Dean picked his way around her, trying not to cross the path of the gaze while also trying to avoid all the tension.
“Oh! You’re going to teach me how to make those brownies right?” Jack said, bouncing on the balls of his feet like an excited puppy.
“It is much too early in this rom com for the makeup speech.”
Dean did some research into the last accident they were involved in, the one with the man in the coma, his life support was pulled a month ago, and two days after that the first murders were committed.
“JERK!” Sam yelled back.
“Uh I guess Friday afternoon?” Sam nodded,
“Yeah, yeah, I get it.”
“What do you want to do?” Dean asked closing his book as Cas turned over, pulling Dean down to kiss him. Dean pulled Cas up and onto his lap properly, kissing him again and licking past his lips. Cas placed his hands on Deans neck, gently pulling his hair, smiling slightly as Dean moaned into his mouth. Dean dragged his hand down Cas’ back and the other hovered over the tie of his sweatpants. Cas shook his head and kissed him again as he got off of Dean and pulled him down into the bed and wrapped his arms around him, tangling their legs together.
“Do you like it?” Gabriel asked twiddling his thumbs.
“Hm?”
“Girls! Stop fighting!!” Jodi shouted, twisting around in her seat to face the group in the back of the car. Jodi had ended up in charge of taking Donna, Claire, Kaia, Alex, Patience, Meg, Bal, and Crowley to the airport.
“If you’re not here then there's nothing to live for.” Dean said opening the door and walking out into the hallway,
“Thanks cas, you want breakfast,” dean knew the angel didnt eat but sam and dean did so it was more a curtesy.
“‘You’re not.” After a brief moment dean said,
“You answered!”
Eileen had been ignoring them for about an hour and a half and was researching the cases Jack had talked about. Around noon she went to the kitchen to get herself a sandwich, still ignoring Sam as she opened the cabinet he was in, pushing him out of the way and grabbing a plate.
“Yeah it’s all of Dean and Sam’s family and friends, that’s the first drawer I organized.”
“food.” Dean groaned rolling himself off the bed and landing on the floor.
“What were you saying about teenagers?”
“Dean, are you coming or what?” Claire whined simultaneously punching Dean in the shoulder. He plastered on his brightest smile and shoved Claire through the doorway into the kitchen.
“I’m going to say yes of course.” Eileen said with a smile, she crossed her arms and nodded to the angel and the demon to come out from where they were unsuccessfully hiding.
“And you wouldn’t have me any other way.”
“Kitchen.” Dean nodded and slid out from under the table with a whole lot more cursing and hobbled as quietly and as quickly as he could towards the kitchen. He turned each corner cautiously, jumping into every door brandishing a knife honing rod.
“Oh he speaks.” Come on dean with the quips,
“ITS A MOTHER FUCKING CAR RIDE! BEHAVE!!” Jodi lost it, scaring the entire car into silence, she didnt shout often but when she did, she meant business.
“I dont get it dean, you were so pissed at me, I-“
“You dont get it.”
“Oh i think your angel knows that. I did say sit.” She said the last bit forcefully and waved her hand, two squishy arm chairs appeared behind them, knocking the backs of their knees making them sit. Cas looked at her tilting his head,
“My world needs stars.” Cas said simply and continued to trace shapes on deans face, who blushed furiously and tried not to move as to not mess up the drawing. When cas had finished drawing he was about to close the marker when dean grabbed it and took cas’ hand, he drew a little heart on the base of his thumb and did the same on his own hand. Dean intertwined their hands and the hearts touched, he smiled brightly and looked at cas who was still gazing fondly at him. Cas cupped deans face in his hands and dean kissed his wrist, a little heart appeared on his skin and it glowed blue. Cas blushed embarrassed but dean just kissed him again and again, watching as the little hearts appeared where he’d kissed him.
“No! Angels don't have panic attacks!” Cas shouted, he suddenly slumped against the wall and slid to a seated position. “What have I done?”
“Fine, we killed the wolves and she wants us over for dinner this weekend.”
“I’m not planning on it, but I’m sure Cas would get to me first.” He says chuckling. A similar exchange takes place between Sam and Cas, though that conversation had been had a few times already. On one memorable occasion, after Dean had yelled at Cas, sam had locked them in a room together and screamed at them that they were family until they stopped fighting. He had let them out of the room only after he threatened to kill them if they hurt each other, in any way, again. The song ended and Sam and Bobby walked off the dance floor, the later muttering ‘Idjits’ under his breath.
"Alright?"
Charlie turned off the main road and went south. "We're almost at the hotel," she informed them.
The younger brother opened his mouth to answer but Dean put a hand over his mouth to prevent him from speaking. “Nothing much,” he told his mate. “Just the usual.”
We welcome any kind of feedback (but the good one is obviously better, duh) and will love you no matter what you have to say to us :)
"Exactly," the senator said pointedly.
“You’re so certain it’ll pass?” Dean questioned as he led them into the house.
It was Cas’ turn to chuckle. “Sweetheart,” he interrupted the spate of words, “it doesn’t hurt to have two different kinds of beans."
"Yeah."
John sat down. "I am very interested in the man who my son is spending so much time with," started John slowly. "What exactly are your plans?"
His father raised an eyebrow at him. "What's wrong? Where's your head at, boy? You should already be down here making dinner. Sam needs to eat regular meals to grow up properly; you know that."
Gobsmacked, Dean could only stare at them. Cas wouldn’t have blindsided him like this… would he? With how worried his husband was about him, the young man suddenly wasn’t sure.
, son.”
Sam didn't look too happy about it though. The boy shuffled his feet uncertainly as he refused to meet Dean's eyes.
I remember having that much energy once.”
“Dad?” he said hesitantly, unsure of what the man wanted.
Dean shrugged happily. "I guess. Next time though, we should go somewhere even you haven't been yet."
The most wonderful thing about the whole house, however, was the rooftop. There was a whole garden up there with real grass, trees and flowers, none of which could be seen from the street because of the way the rooftop was designed. From the front, the house seemed to have a normal roof, which in reality only covered about a fifth or a sixth of the whole house, shielding only a small room with the access staircase from rain and other nuisances.
Dean shrugged. "Sammy's not really interested in it anyway, so Dad might end up giving it to me in the end. I don't really know. I could've used it a few days ago though."
Dean nodded. "Yeah. I mean, I never had problems before; people always treated me nice."
“I guess I don’t want to go against Castiel,” he murmured.
It had been four days since he last saw Castiel and he was actually kind of missing the guy. He could do a dinner, thought Dean as he replied to Castiel that yes he would be glad to meet him, before he deleted both the received and the sent texts just in case John decided to snoop.
"Cutting it close, are we?" was the first thing Bobby said to him when Dean entered the garage.
“And everything else,” the political expert asserted confidently. “Especially if any of you Novaks are involved.”
Castiel gave him a gummy smile. "You mean outside of serving the people of our nation to the best of my conviction and ability?"
Dean grinned, still a little breathless but happy to see Gabe. "Thanks."
“dean that wasnt a star.”
“Please?”
“We’re engaged! I’m engaged!” Sam squealed jumping up and down,
They made it to breakfast after about another half hour as either Cas or Dean would make things take longer. The walked into the kitchen hand in hand, talking about their month apart, and didn't notice sam and eileen staring at them until sam coughed pointedly,
Rufus Turner
“I did.” They sat in silence for a while, cas letting dean emote. He tried not to say anything but he couldnt, “dean youre praying to me.”
“Goodnight dean.” Cas said, a little sadly? He wandered back to the table to review the accidents, he would double and triple check his notes to make sure he didn’t miss any freaky accidents as dean called them.
“Thursday?” Sam asked quietly, almost expecting jack to come in wanting to know the ‘deets’, or was it tea? He didnt know anymore.
About a month later, Dean got himself under control, he buried his emotions deep enough that they wouldn’t come out, he built his walls and prepared himself for his heart to break a bit every time Cas left. Cas too was preparing himself for the inevitable, he knew there would always be something Jack needed him to do, always something the world needed, or the boys needed. He knew he couldn’t just stop working, at least not in the near future so he readied himself for the next departure. He bottled up all the emotions he didn't want to feel and he hid them away, he salted and burned them and then buried them in concrete. Cas knew it was temporary, but he couldn’t bare to face Dean like this, he was a mess. He had listened to every single one of Dean's prayers and cried every time he cried, laughed at his stories, and murmured unheard ‘I love yous’ every time Dean did. He would never wish to not feel those emotions, would never wish away their love, but they’d spent so long apart and he needed it to be perfect so that they could part happily, excited to see eachother again instead of focusing on the time apart. He needed it to be perfect for Dean, so as he flew back from heaven, he readied himself for both the impending separation and the wonderful week he hoped for.
“Yeah, yeah, what do you want?”
“Now youre just being difficult.” Dean pursed his lips and glared half heartedly at the group seated around the table,
After hours of watching classic rom coms, dean steals teh remote and turns on LOTR, no one complains so they end up watching all of them. Since they were watching movies with god, in heaven, in a house that on the outside looked like it couldnt hold that many people, sitting through 10-24 hours of movies is the least interesting thing. After watching all three hobbit movies, they scroll through netflix and find a fantasy YA show and they watch that, the argument being, that its a mix of the genres and no one has to speak of that night again.
“I love you. I know that's a lot but, its true and you dont have to say it back and-shit I made you cry!” Sam rushed over to her and pulled her into a hug and then hastily pulled away. She pulled him back to her and then pushed him away again, shaking her head and smiling. Sam watched her confused. She signed something and he looked back up at her, tears in his eyes,
“Fine.”
“Years!”
“If you call it sexy times, I might kill you.”
They spent the next week being the most stereotypical, fluffy, chick flick family they could. Dean drove them to Jodi’s, Cas in the front and Jack and Sam in the back of course. They had meals together, went on a hunt together,  and Jack and Cas spent a good long time messing with their powers while Sam and Dean were researching.
“You know cas and i may not agree all teh time, but atleast he knows who his real freinds are.”
“The kid, he’s taken mine and amara’s powers. List dean.” He said impatiently,
“I haven’t found anything.” Sam said dejectedly,
“Yes.” Crowley shot him a look and Aziraphale kissed him in apology. Crowley grumbled but proposed that they go to the ritz and celebrate.
“You’re insufferable.”
“These here are Mr. Colin Barnes and Ms. Marianne Smith, they go to teh college just up the road, just started datin apparently, my daughter was good freinds with Ms. Smith and-“
“Shut up and eat your rabbit food.”
“That part of our healthy relationship?”
“No, i dont.” They gave her matching eyebrow raises, “What? I dont!”
“Cremated?”
“Jerk. Now go put on a shirt, the rest of them should be here shortly and maybe put something nice on.”

“Cant.” He said squeezing his eyes shut in an attempt to find proper speech again, “If we keep going, I wont be able to stop.” Dean said with effort, he shook his head a bit and smiled down at cas, his eyes still closed,
“I’m going to be up all night, you get settled i can research.” Cas said pulling off his trench and rolling up his sleeves, he sat down at the table and thumbed through a lore book,
“We’re coming back of course.” Rowena said,
“Hey!” Sam whisper yelled at her. She just half heartedly glared at him and continued to make her meal.
She walked out of the kitchen, ignoring Sam’s frantic signing. She sat back down to her research before kicking Dean squarely in the face as he crouched under the table she was working at. He swore a bit before tugging at her pant leg. After long enough she caved.
“Dean!” Sam shouted, tossing Dean the knife. Dean caught it and plunged it into a crocotta that was barreling at him. The blade went through but didn't kill it and the creature grabbed him by the neck throwing him at the wall. A wave of energy surged through the room as it came up to Dean again, Dean grabbed its hand as it reached for his neck again, and he dissolved into a screaming pile of ash. Dean stood there dumbfounded, Cas and Sam stared at him astonished. Dean barely had time to react as two crocotta came up behind Cas, he shouted at Cas to duck but instead he twirled around, grabbing one creature’s arm and plunging the blade it was holding into the other creature while running the other through with his angel blade. Now it was Dean's turn to look shocked at Cas, but really he just stared, his mouth open slightly, as he raked his gaze over Cas. “Dean you're drooling.” Sam said as he passed Dean to check on Eileen who could be heard stabbing three crocotta repeatedly in the other room.
“Can't we just be happy you're here now?”
“Oh its simple really, one of each couple ended up liking to write on themselves occasionally, sometimes it takes quite a while but someone will make the first move if you will, anyway the writing shows up on the other person too, eventually someone will write something important or they’ll notice, that’s where being good friends helps because when your best friend that you spend all your time with writes a reminder on their hand and it shows up on you, you’ll notice. Its quite a famous thought around here, used to just be a legend, but it said that one day your soulmate will write on themselves and it will show up on you, i just made it come true.”
“Just wondering. What with the whole dean business and the cas business and the-“
“What mick?! Oh hello, sorry about him.” The other man said, “Go put on pants.” He said rolling his eyes.
“You sure?” He knew where this was going,
“You do know, and I never would.”
“Holy fuck youre hot.” Dean breathed, not totally expecting Cas to hear,
“yeah, why did you even let him talk to you like that?” Dean’s voice wa trembling a bit, no one talks to his angel like that.
That night dean and cas were sitting on opposite sides of the library not speaking, cas was taking notes on lore on his arm and dean, who was supposed to be researching reversal spells, was staring at the writing. Sam walked in, groaned, and pulled dean and cas up out of their chairs and into deans room.
“Say it.”
“Jace, how are you?” Jace said shaking rowenas hand
It took forever but the couple had finally finished making dinner, both were clingy and kissy and had obviously been focusing a bit more on making out than making food at times but they had finally almost finished. The cookies were in the oven, a bowl of cookie dough still un baked sat on the counter,
“No.”
After that, they all dissolved into conversation about who was going to go on which trips and when they were all leaving. When breakfast had been had and empty plates had been abandoned, they had managed to decide on plans.
“What dean wants to ask is if you are experimenting with people not just cookies.”
“See ya.” Sam said rolling his eyes and grabbing a beer,
“Can you get the door? Key is in my left back pocket.” Cas nodded and pulled the key from its spot, both tried to ignore their blushes. They got into the motel and dean immediately started to do research,
“Hello, Mila sent us.”
“Find it?”
“Hey guys sorry I’m late. Urgh.” Sam stopped in the doorway as everyone burst out laughing.
“I’ll check the library records.” Cas said nodding, he blipped out of the room, then back in again. He strode over to dean and plucked the beer away from him, “No more until tonight, its 10 am for god-chuck-for whoever’s sake!”
“Okay Shakespeare whatever you say.”
“Hex bags?”
“Dean!” Sam shouted sliding to his knees next to his brother, “dean, where’s cas?” Sam shouted shaking a sobbing dean.
“You watched it. You said you werent going to watch it.”
“Its been three weeks dean.”
When dean had let everything out, every memory, every emotion, everything, the colors floated around, filling the meadow and coloring the flowers and grasses around them. Cas touched deans arm and watched as dean stared in wonder at the colors he could now see. Cas got up to allow dean space as the prayer had gotten quieter, not silent but quiet. Dean stood up with him and out of nowhere pulled cas into a hug, not a platonic pat on the shoulder and handshake kind of hug but a meaningful, chick flick hug. Deans arms where wound around cas’ neck, while cas’ were around deans waist. Dean pulled away slightly but didnt loosen his grip on the angels neck, he looked at him, looked straight into the ocean of blue that he easily got lost in. Cas met deans piercing green eyes and saw the emotions behind them, the thoughts, the feelings, but he couldnt place them. Dean saw the flicker of hope in teh angels eyes that quickly faded into sadness, to pity. Dean dropped his gaze and turned away, his hand trailing down cas’ arm as he did. As his hand reached cas’ wrist he felt cas yank him back around, facing him. They stood close together, still staring into each others eyes, dean planted his other hand on cas’ chest when he spun, cas still held deans wrist with one hand and the other was gripping his waist. Cas held deans gaze and broke down his walls, letting dean see everything he was feeling in that moment and pressed a tentative kiss on his lips. Dean just continued to look at him, slightly shocked, then he grabs cas’ face with both hands and pulls him into a heated, open mouthed kiss that didnt break for quite a while.
Anyway, adding to my list of excuses, i write train of thought so organizing it can be difficult especially when i made a huge plot change in the middle of writing the 5th chapter, I know its crazy to think Ive actually written that much, sorry its not out, minus insane errors its a good chapter. But back to my point, sorry this is rambly, ive organized and created new docs and notes and pages and alas I cant organize it properly so I should upload the next chapter then go back to organizing so i get some semblance of sanity.
“He has a lot to do and he probably doesn’t want to.” Jack said dejectedly,
“It’ll be fine, the reapers know what they’re doing, if they have questions Jack can help.”
“Hello Dean. I didn’t mean to wake you.” he said quietly,
“Couldnt get out of here sooner?”
“Cas you don’t get it, I love you. I love you more than I've ever loved anything. I know you don't love me, but I can't live without you.”
Cas has to leave for a week but dean can handle it because he has a something planned for when he comes back.
“No! Eileen!” Sam shouted as his girlfriend got stabbed through the heart, in his shock and grief he didn’t notice as his own vision faded to blackness.
“Ugh, clothes.” Dean groaned, having gained teh power of speech once more, he heaved himself off the bed and reached for the pants he was wearing before, yet again abandoning a shirt. “Like what you see.” Dean said with a smirk when he noticed cas staring,
“YOU GET BACK HERE YOU WINGED ASSMONKEY!” Dean hit the wall and flung things, he broke many things he wished he hadn't but it payed off as Cas reappeared,
“Good point.” Sam said nodding, a tad concerned,
“Better than my proposal?”
“Very.” Cas said smiling as he leaned his head against the back of the chair and closed his eyes. After a few moments of silence, Jack spoke again,
“Do you need help? You have a house full of overbearing family for the next week, we would be happy to help.”
“Thats later, this is now.”
“Yes.” Cas said quietly, “I have to finish heaven and with the empty we have to fix that too, and-“
“How long have you known eachother?” Sam asked raising an eyebrow as Crowley turned into a snake and wrapped around Aziraphale,
“Its a self fulfilling prophecy.”
“What?” Jodi asked,
“Do I want to know?”
“You’ve been avoiding me, you haven't responded to any of my prayers, you broke up with me and then disappeared! I can take a hint Cas.”
“Wait, you dont have the constellations on your face, the spell is fixed.” Dean said happily,
“We’re going to talk about this later.” Dean said so no one but cas could hear,
“Yes actually there's-“ sam gave Dean his bitchface, “no, no there aren’t.”
“Atleast 600 years ago, I think, I took you to that little chocolate shop and you said that orchid reminded you of eden.”
“Lore books mostly, thought you might have something.” Sam answered glancing at a book that claimed it was nice and accurate,
Shortly after Eileen followed to her room, leaving only Jack and Cas alone in the library.
They loved thier family and thier famiily loved them but they were close to dean and sam and could tell when something was wrong. They saw the facade dean put up, saw the emotions threatening to spill over, they said nothing but gave small sad looks to sam and even sadder looks to dean. When dean had had enough he hastily said goodbye and left sam with their family. He drove for a while, not knowing what he’d find, only hoping to be further away from his emotions, to try to out run his thoughts and feelings. He knew it was only a matter of time before he had to stop running so he parked the car on the side of the road and walked through acres of prairie to a large tree growing in the middle of the flowers and grasses. He sat, leaning against the tree and thought about everything, he felt everything, he experienced everything. He let the tears fall, let the emotions wash over him, and before long he was shaking, wracked with sobs, unable to close the gate he’d opened. This is the first time in his entire life, and after life that he’s really let himself feel and understand everything and its overwhelming. He turns his thoughts towards cas, thinking about the happy memories they made together, thinking about the way his smile lights up the room, about how hes an angel the size of the Chrysler building and yet he is the most awkward being dean has ever met. Dean let out a watery laugh, feeling himself calming down with every memory, with every thought. He feels his scar burn, but he pays it no attention.
“Personal affects?”
“How long did it take us to tell eachother?”
“This never goes right for us dean, how do we know this won’t end the world, again.”
“He;s been working non stop trying to finish before he comes home.”
“Good, use them.”
Im starting some knew stuff with a couple knew fandoms but i dont know if I’ll post it, but stay tuned!
“You’re shirtless.” Cas said kind of questioningly, he was blushing as if that was the first time he’d seen dean devoid of a top,
“Hi.” Cas said quietly,
“Im just perfect that way.” Gabriel said with a smirk as he wrapped his arms around her form behind. She smacked him away and turned around, “I love you too.”
Hello all 👋
“I guess not, but I took you away from Dean and he needed you, he’ll be upset.”
“They’ll all be okay right?”
“Dean, if we are friends, our parting would be easier, that's all.”
“It's a friend hug, bitch.” Dean scowled,
“I don't want to be friends!” Cas said, throwing his arms up, “How many times do I have to tell you that I love you, I will always be there even if I’m not really there. I will always love you if we are friends or family or even if you throw me out, I will still love you. Please Dean, we’re just hurting ourselves more.” Cas turned away, when Dean didn’t answer, expecting that he had walked away but he felt an unmistakable touch on his hips as he was spun around, face inches away from Dean’s. Dean looked into his eyes for a second before placing his hands on Cas’ neck and pulling him into a passionate kiss.
Over the next week Cas only left once and even still it was only for a few hours. They cuddled and kissed and cooked and laughed, they went on a double date with Sam and Eileen, and they had a party with their family. As the week came to a close, Dean pulled Cas aside and kissed him hard, when he pulled away he asked breathlessly,
“No!” Dean cut her off,
“Im 300 years old, if I hadnt found someone to love by now then theres no hope.”
“need help?” Cas asked as he got out of the car,
The brothers cycled through various other weapons, makeshift or otherwise, that they found around the bunker and after a few hours had found hiding spots. Dean was under his bed and Sam was curled rather uncomfortably in a cabinet in the kitchen.
“Nothing.” He said innocently, he smiled sweetly and used Eileen’s flusteredness to push her fully into the room. “Now, you two, figure it out!” He said folding the shelves back to their spots.
“You’ve been thinking about me. Why?”
“Crowley, shut up!” Jodi said in her scarily calm mom voice that didnt allow any argument, so he shut up,
“What?!”
“So sam, why did you really come here?” Aziraphale asked, sitting in a comfy chair and conjuring hot cocoa for them. Sam sat down across from him, he jumped up and pulled a wine bottle out of the crease in the chair, “Sorry about that, Crowley usually sits there.”
“It’s okay dear!” He shouted back as he appeared again in front of them, sam winced at the noise level, “Crowley go show eileen those orchids you got from the Aztecs, when was that-“
“Hey cas!” Sam said walking through the door and hugging him, Eileen stood behind him, very pregnant. (Why can’t the afterlife be normal?)
“They should have, they always eat at the dinner a few blocks away and they leave at 6:30 sharp.” Dean said as they ran into the house, dean in front of cas, his gun already out. They burst through the door and found the man on the ground, his head bleeding, the women didn’t seem to be in the house, until someone screamed.
“He cleaned the bunker top to bottom 6 times, I walked in the door after that vamp nest and forgot to wipe my feet and he almost chopped my head off.”
“I dont think many of us do, kenma.”
“We’ve been practically married for years, what difference does it make?”
“I’m not.” Dean said slightly confused,
“Yeah. I think so. Its a work trip this time, a definite start and end time, he has his phone so he’ll call every night. The whole, sappy couple bullshit.” Sam shrugged, trying to stow his worry,
“You told eileen.” Dean remarked,
“Ssssorry, it’ssss warm.” Crowley hissed and hid his head in the crook of aziraphales neck,
“Did you talk?”
“Anyway he did really well this past week.”
“Youre death?” Dean nodded, “that explains what happened back on that hunt.”
“We havent seen you in ages.” Jack tilted his head, just like cas,
“I can too.” Aziraphale was heard grumbling in the back room,
“What are you doing?” Patience asked after a couple of minutes,
“Then why-“ sam asked gesturing to the mess,
After a couple of hours he heard the door click and he aimed for a couple steps away form the door and landed centimeters away from cas.
“Oh the adorable couple from down the street, the Pendragons, they are such sweet young men, they’ve know each other for years, died for each other a few times too. Oh and that merlin, he thought Arthur didn’t know he had magic! He became my student, their wedding is in a month. See Arthur’s father was the mayor for years until his death-“ dean looked at her questioningly, “well he was a horrid man, someone had to off him at some point.” She said shrugging, “Anyhoo, Arthur decided that him and his sister could share the responsibilities, oh that reminds me! Morgana and Gwen were what my third subjects, after the pastor and his wife of course, I’m always better at friends to lovers, 50 k slow burn type of things.” Dean nodded knowingly until cas glared at him,
"Omega rights? What does that mean? Do you have some like" - cough - "different rights?"
Feeling another wave of tears coming, Dean felt pitiful. He had literally just thrown himself a pity party and he was disgusted with himself. Castiel wouldn't want someone so dramatic. He decided to pop a sleeping pill in the end, as to just fall asleep and forget his gloomy mood.
Dean gave him a smile. "No, it's okay. Give me your phone and I'll type it in."
The omega’s eyes softened. “Would you want to?”
Castiel looked appalled. "Dear heavens, Dean!"
He had just got a job and while Bobby didn't seem to mind he was an omega, he didn't want to prove people right by mating with an alpha and getting knocked up as soon as he met someone. That wasn't what he wanted. He had always thought he would be the one to work and make money; even after he presented and everyone told him he would be a good father and what beautiful kids he was going to have, he still thought he would work one day.
Castiel sighed, leaning back in his chair. "I understand that, Dean, but where do you suggest I get the money to do what you want me to do?"
A week after the ‘intervention’ - as Dean now thought of it - found the omega in the kitchen, humming along to
Dean chuckled throatily and took a sip of his beverage. "Well, it doesn't have to be used only for nostalgia," he said. "A fire might be romantic, don't you think?" he finished a bit shyly.
Crowley sighed and stood up. "I'm sorry, Dean, but I can't offer you a position."
"I swear to God, he did. I mean, he posed it as a completely theoretical question and told me in confidence, but... you know."
Dean grinned, saluting his boss lazily and walking over to grab his toolbox. He then headed towards the silver Ford that stood at the back of the yard, crawling underneath to have a look at the damage. The driveshaft was all bent out of shape, and in the back it was almost separated from the rear differential. There was no way this car drove here.
The omega ruffled Sam’s shaggy hair. “Great. Whatcha doing?” he asked, nodding at the opened textbook on the table.
Dean disentangled himself from his father's grasp, shrugging him off. "It's not like it has much to do with you, Dad. This doesn't really change anything."
into the recycle bin, where it belonged.
The omega felt a thrill running up his spine at his mate’s position, the back of his new panties getting wet slowly.
An indeterminate amount of time later - it felt like five or six hours but probably wasn’t nearly that long - only Charlie and Dean were left in the kitchen. Meg had departed, saying she needed to get ready for a date, which left everyone else with unhinged jaws since she’d never shown any interest in anyone before, at least not around Dean or Castiel.
He bit off almost half of his burger in one go, his cheeks bulging out. He must've looked stupid but he didn't care. Not like there was anyone around to judge him.
Aaaand I come to you with another chapter (I know, I know, it took forever). I was a tad busy over Christmas because I had to have my wisdom tooth extracted on the 25th :( Imagine all that wonderful food on the table and me sitting in the corner with a bowl of yoghurt :D
The video cut to a footage from the Senate's debate, where Balthazar Roche was standing at the lectern. If asked, Dean would say he looked a bit desperate.
"Right," was the deadpan answer he received.
Dean sighed, exasperated. "Okay, come on, let's get you back to bed. You're gonna take your temperature and if it's over thirty-eight degrees, I'm gonna give you some Paracetamol, okay?"
"Yeah well." Dean shrugged. "I really liked what you were doing but then you got too close to my- ehm, you know."
Dean sighed. "Well, Cas is... he is a..."
Dean did as he was told, weaving through the people blindly to go back and sit down on Charlie's blanket. He felt off-kilter after the conversation he just had and he wasn't sure why. It wasn't like anything really happened; they just literally spoke about speaking together later on.
“You are young and pretty, so it’s going to take time to change the public’s opinion of you and other omegas. The best way to do that, love, is with your attitude, especially when you accompany me at public appearances,” Castiel stated seriously, looking his young mate directly in the eyes. “I couldn’t be prouder that you chose me as a mate, you know.”
“Here,” he told Gabe, giving him the bottle, “this is yours.”
Dean scoffed. "Like what? Money?"
Head buried in his arms on top of the kitchen table, eyes shut tight, Dean could still see the blazing headline.
“Years and years of practise,” the alpha informed him. “I’ve tied a tie every morning for the last twenty-two years.”
“Cas?” he yelled again. “Where are you?”
Castiel gave him an answering nod and a smile. "All right. Just remember that you can still change your mind."
Dean rolled his eyes, sitting beside Sam on his bed. "Didn't you hear what they said about omegas? They made it sound like we wanted nothing more than an alpha's knot and his stupid babies. Do you really think that's true?"
Not wobbling in the least on her three-inch spike heels as she strode over to the table, the formidable woman insisted, “It’s time to snap out of this. I tried to head off the worst from the airport in Ivato-”
Dean bit his lip self-consciously, shuffling his feet forward to start moving again. "Can I tell you something?"
“Dean-o, are you okay?” Gabe’s brow furrowed in concern.
“You should,” Cas confirmed, tilting his head. “I think it’s good that you stood up to Meg, though,” he continued. “She could use a bit of a challenge, I think. And you, my dear,
Dean grinned at the words, hearing both the political coaching as well as the genuine passion in Castiel's voice. The guy really knew how to talk, though that Roman guy was quite persuasive as well. Had Dean not read so much about the issues omagists were trying to solve, he might have even believed him.
Dean turned to look at his brother, noticing the boy's eyes glittering with unshed tears. "Don't cry, you wimp. This is a good thing."
“You’re sick of me.”
“Because I’m bored and Jodi says I cant use my powers.” A couple people passing looked at him funny,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are they going to go?” Dean said again,
“No-no not going to do that. Not again.”
“And i brought cookies!” She said, the container floating into deans hands. She walked down the steps and hugged dean and cas, then floated up a bit and wrapped her arms around sams neck, “Hi sam!” Sam stood a bit stunned but then returned the hug.
“Sure dean.” Cas pulled out the file from the glove box and flipped through, “Bunch of newly weds and new couples are getting offed, they have no connections, and they all died in weird ways, really witchy.”
“Haven’t gotten around to decorating yet.”
“No Dean, that's not what I mean. I-“ Cas disappeared and within one breath Dean was shouting at the top of his lungs,
“For what?”
“Sorry dean, whats up.” He said turning to away from the window a bit.
As the bunker bustled with the buzz of the morning a bright light came through the vents by the bunker door as Jack and Cas landed behind it. Jack cursed as a loud thud reverberated around the bunker. Everyone went silent for a second before a voice Dean could never forget could be heard seemingly assessing the damage. Dean shot through the bunker and up the stairs, throwing the door open and enveloping Cas in a bone shattering embrace. Dean gathered himself again and let go of Cas, turning to face jack,
“I-uh-we havent gotten too much time alone recently what with the family staying here-dont get me wrong its great that they’re here, but I-um.”
“Donna are you guys okay?”
“says someone who puts a good quarter cup of sugar in his coffee.” He said under his breath making cas smile despite himself, hes pretty when he smiles thought dean.
“Thats what ive been telling you for quite a while now.”
“Sam thats in a book-“
“Well we could just you know-“
“I’m not a kid anymore!” Claire shouted at them,
“I love you too.” Dean relaxed again and kissed his unicorns neck lightly.
“Oh whatever.”
“No it wasnt.” Cas said pulling out the books, he waved his hand again and paper, pencils, and tea appeared on a large antique desk. “We have to finalize the plans so we can get started.”
They had a small ceremony with just their family and friends in the woods near the bunker. They got matching wedding bands and they each had their own engagement rings, one with braided silver and green jewels and the other black with blue, but still under their rings were the marker ones, made permanent by cas, the week after they drew them.
“Night Dean.”
“What? Are you okay?” Dean said pulling Cas into the room by his shoulders,
“Where’s Sam?”
“On second thoughts, I do sleep, goodnight.” Balthazar said seeing something down the hall and getting up quickly.
“I like you.”
Kelly Kline
“Jerk.”
“What?”
“Why? How many times do I have to tell you all that I’ve been asked that so many times, be more specific please.”
have to help.” She jabbed a red fingernail at the newspaper, which was flat on the table, unfolded to reveal the entire front page. “You know the newsies exaggerate for sensationalism, boy.”
wouldn’t dare since that could lead to a lawsuit.”
“Came to keep you company, didn’t I? Heard you were alone in this big ole house and decided you needed some baking lessons.”
Dean grinned at him, going over to help with Gabe's bags. "Tell me, what exactly
Dean clambered out of the car as soon as Cas pulled into John’s driveway. Thankfully, the drive from city hall hadn’t taken long at this time of night. After knocking on the door to alert John that he was there, Dean walked in the house, calling out, “Dad?”
He woke up some minutes later to Charlie stepping over him - kicking him in the shin in the process - while trying to muffle her squealing. He looked around and noticed that only Rufus and Jo were sitting on the blanket with him, the others having scattered around the perimeter sometime during his sleep. Suddenly a ruckus from the other side of their picnic gathering caught Dean's attention. "What's happening?" he asked Jo as he heard the excited chattering.
Ten minutes later, Dean was waving at his father and brother riding away in the Impala, grinning at Sam who had his face pressed against the passenger seat widow making funny faces at Dean. He kept at it until the black car turned a corner and Dean went back inside.
“Nah, I’ve got it,” Dean assured him. “Enjoy the break,” he then teased. “I’ll put you back to work after your birthday.”
Castiel sighed. "It's not going to be easy, with the majority of people voting against the merit scholarships - and they
Dean narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Would you? Don't you want to mate me?"
good.”
Setting down his fork, Dean exploded, “I read this online article about us getting mated last night, and it’s complete bollocks! It makes me sound like a helpless ninny.” Practically vibrating with anger, he snorted, “It reads like a badly plotted romance novel - like I needed a white knight to swoop in and rescue me.”
“It’s good to see you,” Charlie greeted him, giving her friend a hug.
"Then why are you telling me this?"
Once they were in Cas’ car, the older man didn’t even dare to take a hand off the wheel because of how fast he was driving, meaning he couldn’t rub Dean’s thigh calmingly like he was used to him doing. He did manage to inject some reassurance into his voice though. “Sweetheart, you need to stay calm for Sam. Breathe.”
Castiel also apparently kept a small bee house in the far back corner of the garden, but Dean didn't get to see it since Cas told him the bees were already asleep and he didn't want to disturb them.
Castiel didn't smile but he did tilt his head in a cute way, so Dean counted it as a win.
He was just putting on the finishing touches when he heard a car pull up out front. Dean ran down the stairs and managed to open the front door before Castiel could knock.
Catching on, the omega grinned. “I won’t tell if you don’t,” he said in what was hopefully a seductive voice.
“Okay,” Sammy readily agreed, reaching around his older brother to snatch one of the tomatoes Dean had just pulled out and popping it into his mouth.” His eyes went wide in surprise as he exclaimed, “Oh! These
,” Dean spluttered, grimacing.
“I’d forgotten how abrasive Meg can seem when she meets someone for the first time.” Cas chuckled. “She doesn’t mean it in a bad way. You should be honored she called you an angel, I think the nicest thing she ever called
The politician took Dean's face in his hands, kissing softly his pouty lips. "Of course I do, Dean. I love you and I have no reservations - which is a first for me, as you know. I just want you to be sure."
Dean felt ashamed. He knew it would make an even bigger difference if he appeared with his senator husband - and they gave some kind of sound bite to the press. He wasn’t up for that, but maybe he
Castiel seemed a bit taken aback - no wonder, he was most likely not used to being spoken to that way. "I'm not sure I understand, Mr Winchester."
He still wasn't completely sure what sort of laws could help them because he wasn't educated enough in omega rights but he was determined to change that. Clicking on the appropriate link, he went on to read about the new Voting Bill and other laws that supported omegas' equality as well as the laws that restricted it.
He flopped down onto his bed, burying his face in his pillow, and cried.
Gabe kept babbling about how his brother had schmoozed the picnic gathering the night before and how he was proud of him for talking to all those starstruck omegas without flirting even once. Dean couldn't explain the feeling that came over him at those words, both relieved and disappointed that Castiel apparently hadn't been interested in him after all.
As Castiel pulled away from the curb, Dean sighed. “At least he seems to be bouncing back from John’s latest drunken rampage. I’m still worried though. He was whimpering in his sleep when I checked on him last night.”
Frustrated, Dean closed his notebook and flopped down on his bed. It was a lost cause. He'd be a virgin until the very day he died. An old wrinkled excuse for an omega with a dried up channel and a shrivelled-
Dean almost blacked out. He couldn't see, couldn't hear and could barely breathe as the orgasm overwhelmed him. He wasn't aware of anything his body was doing let alone of anything Cas was doing.
Dean chuckled. "Of course she does; she has class."
Castiel chucked. "This is not an interrogation, Dean. Can we at least order before we start?"
“No worries, son. There’s no way a drinking problem is going to beat a Winchester,” John asserted firmly. “It’s not like I can get hold of the stuff in here anyway…”
Dean struggled to catch his breath as he heard his heart pounding in his chest, his temples pulsing. He loved Cas. He loved him.
The politician looked taken aback. "I don't think I understand that, Dean."
"Wake up, Charlie," whispered Dean.
Now Dean was offended. "No, of course not. We were fine. He was nice. I was nice. Everything was nice."
Dean’s cheeks pinkened at the pun. “I’m doing great, Gabe. I really love Cas,” he assured the other man.
him - but the reasonableness with which Cas had spoken grated on his nerves. Worried out of his mind about Aaron after he guzzled Windex, the omega hadn’t registered what the paediatrician said about kids drinking toxic substances not being uncommon.
The omega shrugged. "What? I'm not allowed to tease you anymore?"
Dean tousled his hair. "Yes, cheese platters," he repeated.
“Thanks,” Dean responded, starting to walk away.
Dean finally began to relax when five days had passed and no more mysterious sightings of either himself or Cas at the rehab clinic made the news. The day of Castiel’s speech to the senate about abortion rights for omegas, however, the situation escalated.
Dean read the text twice, grinning at Charlie's no bullshit attitude. What she said sounded really plausible, so Dean decided to believe her. He could always ask Cas about it if he wasn't sure. He wrote back:
"A person fighting for their rights, I suppose. Sometimes a situation calls for a heartfelt speech and I need to give examples of people and their life stories to drive my point home."
His little brother stared at his mobile phone sitting on the night stand. "But I don't think you're just a thing, Dean."
“Okay, I’ll try again,” the omega mumbled, his heart beginning to beat faster as Cas’ hand drifted lower.
"Wait," blurted out Dean when they got up from where they were sitting in the living room, "I have something to show you, Sammy."
Bobby shrugged. “Of course, she’s yours.”
Dean tugged at the offending material in frustration. "Uh, take it off, Cas."
“Everything going okay?” the omega asked, a bit concerned by the tired note in John’s voice. “You getting enough rest?”
He was given a shrug in response.
His lover leaned closer to kiss his lips. "You are so beautiful, Dean," he whispered. "What you just did was the most perfect thing I have ever seen."
“Did anyone actually accuse you of abuse?” Charlie demanded. “The ER doctor or the police?”
“Are we idiots?”
“good to see you Cas. I would hug ya but-“ he said chuckling, as dean launched away from Cas.
“I love you too.”
“You really love me?” Dean asked, having seen cas’ fond and loving look,
“Oy! Look where you’re going!” He shouted at the man, he was about to turn away when he saw the women next to the man turn his way and give him a death stare. He was frightened even though he knew it would be difficult to kill him, though, he thought, she did seem like someone who could pull it off. As she turned around again he looked at her properly, stowed gun in her waistband, frizzy hair barely kept off her face, she smiled at the man in the fez like he was most of her world. While he was staring, he felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up and turned to find a couple standing staring at him,
“How would you know.”
“What were you looking for?” Crowley asked much nicer this time,
“Why not Dean, you need to move on sometime.” Yelled meg as she passed the doorway,
“Shut it Kuroo, shittykawa wanted you all to come along.” A tall-nope too many of them-one of them said.
“You know I’m still right here.” Gabriel grumbled,
Throughout the night cas stayed as far from dean as possible, dean was so happy that his family was back he barely noticed, I said barely, he did notice but left it alone for a while, enjoying his family being together and happy. After a few hours he went to talk to cas who at this moment was sitting on a chair in the corner of the living room with a glass of whiskey that dean knew he’d never finish,
“Probably.”
“please come home Cas, I can't function without you.”
“Have not.” Dean snapped, his cheeks flaring bright red,
Dean noticed how Cas would spend the times when he was peaceful, the times when he didn't know he came home, the times when they couldn't talk or go out together to come back to him. Dean thought that Cas was done, that he was holding on to something that was fading. Everyday he worried that maybe he talked too much, maybe he was too clingy, maybe he was just hard to deal with. Then one day he thought that maybe he was a mess and Cas deserved better.
“Hes an angel!”
“I-uh, bed.” Dean said pointing out the door,
“Ravish me on the counter huh? Better than a wall i suppose.” Cas giggled a bit and pulled dean into a kiss.
Dean was walked down the aisle at his own wedding -at the Roadhouse of course- by Rowena. Cas spends the entire ceremony trying not to cry, and Dean starts bawling when Cas reads his vows. Both of their vows are simple, not showy but sweet, just a confirmation of their love for one another. By the time they said ‘I do’ both were in tears, and when they kiss they can’t let go of one another, not because either is afraid of loosing the other, but just because they don’t have to let go if they don’t want to.
“Morning breath.”
See you at Chapter 3!
“Ooh look theres the reaper!” Claire said pointing at the reaper who was materializing in front of the pyre. Kaia nodded and pulled claire away as she pulled off her suit jacket.
“No Cas, you need to be with your family.”
“You go on a trip, we go on a trip? What?”
“I love you too dean.” Dean closed the space between them, their lips pressed together in a chaste kiss, they had time, they could take it slow.
I do hope you guys like this, I’m mostly just finishing this because I want to, so if no one ever reads this, I dont really care, just had fun writing it. If you did read it, thanks! Much appreciated!
“Hello love.”
That night Cas left again.
“I’ll make it disappear before the maids come.” Jodi looked at him and then turned away nodding,
“Claire found a case in North Dakota-“
“So, what are you gonna do to heaven?”
“Of course I do, always have.” Cas said, resisting the urge to break eye contact and stare at his feet. He tapped his fingers on Dean’s waist nervously before Dean grabbed his collar and pulled him into another kiss.
“No” dean said a bit too quickly.
“I most likely do.”
The End
“Mhm.” Dean nodded before pushing the chair off him and getting up. “I’m good.”
“Oh do come out dear.” The man at the door to the bookshop grumbled, as both men could be called odd, this one can only be described as well, lets see, he had dark round shades that he had scrambled to put on as he shuffled out from the door concealing yellow eyes, he wore a black suit jacket and his red hair seemed to have been styled at one point but was no longer.
“Good morning dean, sleep well.”
Within half an hour everyone was in the car again in swimsuits and coverups. Alex was rummaging through the tote bag filled with sunscreen and blankets and an umbrella, Jack was halfway out the window, the wind messing his hair up, patience was reading Charles dickens in between them and steadily ignoring everyone around her. As they walked onto the beach and picked a spot they heard what sounded like an obscene number of people practically flooding onto the beach. It was probably only 20 people but they managed to spread out. A small ball of energy with insane orange hair bounced after a very tall man with grey and black hair, they crashed into the water and a few others followed.
“Dean are you talking to sam about our lack of intercourse?” CAs asked as he walked to the fridge to get milk. Dean pointed to cas while looking at sam,
“Yeah, fine. How are you?”
“Isham, was that girl human?”
“Hm.” Cas leaned into dean and buried his face in deans neck. “I dont want to leave.”
“Because, with the entire family in one place some of the adults need some time alone.” Cas explained patiently,
“Why did you kiss me?” Sam looked at her slightly taken aback,
Also I have a serious question for anyone thats going to read this. I have an idea for something that might be fun but I cant decide the name.
Cas appears on the edge of the meadow watching dean sit in the middle, just feeling. He sees the emotion pouring off of dean, the colors spilling over the meadow. He watches as bubbles of emotion pours off of him, changing color with his emotions. He watches contemplating whether or not to answer the prayers. He slowly walks through the meadow to the tree and silently sits down next to Dean.
About a month later, Dean got himself under control, he buried his emotions deep enough that they wouldn’t come out, he built his walls and prepared himself for his heart to break a bit every time Cas left. Cas too was preparing himself for the inevitable, he knew there would always be something Jack needed him to do, always something the world needed, or the boys needed. He knew he couldn’t just stop working, at least not in the near future so he readied himself for the next departure. He bottled up all the emotions he didn't want to feel and he hid them away, he salted and burned them and then buried them in concrete.
“Hey cas.” Dean said stretching and sitting up against the headboard,
“I could never-I couldn’t live without you,” dean had sat down on the arm of the couch close to cas, “without any of you.” Dean scooted away,
“Is no one in their old heavens anymore?”
“wow, I thought you were joking.” Dean looked at sam on eyebrow raised, sam just sipped his coffee and shrugged.
“You’re done with me, anyway by the time I had existed for this long I was already leading my own troops, it's only natural. It's better if I’m far away from you all anyway.” Cas said dejectedly,
“You dont have to be, its fine dean.”
“We tried Cas, you said you didn't want to see me broken, then leave, if that's what you want, we can be friends.”
“Crowley? We have a Crowley.”
“What?”
Dean sat on his bed, his back against the headboard, knees pulled up to his chest, his notebook balanced on his knees as he scribbled something. He smiled and finished writing with a flourish, he looked the page over and nodded. The approved page then was turned to a fresh one, this one adorned with drawings and notes. He turned the page again and brushed his finger over a small heart next to a scrawled and hasty letter, it ended,
“Yes, that stuff.”
“He said he’d be fine.”
“Thank fuck.” Dean sighed, pulling Cas to him and wrapping him in a hug, “You’re back Cas.”
“Hey you leavin?” Sam said bringing his attention back to cas,
“You broke the empty?”
“I know you better than you think.” Dean smiled and walked over to sit on the other side of the couch. Cas, anticipating his movements, shifted to be able to face Dean, he spread out his legs, barely allowing room for Dean to sit without sitting on him. What he wasn’t anticipate was Dean pushing him further down the couch and placing himself so that Cas was leaning his back against him. Cas shifted to a slightly better position and rested his head in the crook of Dean’s neck,
“Bye old men!” Shouted claire, presumably from across the house, making dean laugh, a chorus of goodbyes followed from the rest of the group,
“Oh-well-you can go to hell.” Dean said not breaking eye contact,
“IAN!!!” The man screamed behind him, “GUESTS!!!!” The baby somehow just turned to look up at the man before curling back into the mans arms. The man just cooed at the baby and tickled its chin, it giggled happily.
“Flattered, but really I don't like that title.”
“Yes darling” rowena said elegantly turning away from magnus who was talking to jace and Alec.
“Fine dont tell me. Just know, I know about the socks.” She did the universal sign for ‘I’m watching you’ and the brothers shared a flabbergasted look,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mkay, see ya’ll in the morning.” Dean said placing a kiss on Cas’ head then groaning at the domesticity of it.
“I call bullshit. We have hurt each other time and time again and yet every time you came back, you never left me. Never. I knew you would always be there, no matter what we did to each other. Do you not believe I'd do the same for you?”
“Witch?”
“Dean-“ As Dean started to walk towards the door, “I tried fighting for you, I tried responding, and coming home when I could, I tried to be there but that just made the inevitable parting that much worse. You kept pulling away so I let you go, I thought that was what you wanted. I can't leave you like that. I can't do that to you, I can't do that to me. I can't watch the man I love almost kill himself when I’m gone.” Dean stopped and took a deep breath,
“Of course.” Crowley said gruffly, he got up and exited the cafe without a second glance.
“Yes you do.”
“Hi.”
Dean and cas went to go question the women the couples had talked to last before the accidents. They drove up to a large stone house, ivy covered its walls and the circular door was painted bright green. They walked up the brick path up to the oddly shaped door and knocked once, the door swung open to reveal a short women with a sheet of cookies in one hand,
“Such a tease.” Dean whispered, as they fell asleep.
“WHats the fun in that?” Jack said with a smile.
“I’m sorry, I have to go.” Cas said disappearing again.
“I'm getting there, jeez. She had bruises on her wrists and stomach and she was bleeding from a deep cut in her neck. She died of blood loss not exsanguination.”
“Of course, win-win, I get to finally use that-“
“I think we should break up.” He said quietly, taking Dean by surprise,
“But you love me.”
“What do you mean?”
Night fell and everyone slept or did not fitfully, anxious for what the next day would bring.
“Uh-yeah. Well, um, boys never really ever become mature do they?” Sam laughed,
“Trip?” Dean asked almost pleading,
“No, i dont know where the watch is or the ghost. Stay close.”
“We have to tell jack.”
“No, it's not-you haven’t showered in days! Is this what you’ve been eating?” Cas asked as he Cast his eyes around the room, plucking a mostly empty beer bottle off the floor he said, “You’ve been drinking again.”
“Where will they go?”
They loved their family and their family loved them, but that meant they were close to Dean and Sam and could tell when something was wrong. They saw the facade Dean put up, saw the emotions threatening to spill over. They said nothing but gave small sad looks to Sam and even sadder looks to Dean. When Dean had had enough, he hastily said goodbye and left Sam with their family. He drove for a while, not knowing what he’d find, only hoping to be further away from his emotions, to try to out run his thoughts and feelings. He knew it was only a matter of time before he would stop running so he parked the car on the side of the road and walked through acres of prairie to a large tree growing in the middle of the flowers and grasses. He sat, leaning against the tree and thought about everything, he felt everything, he experienced everything. He let the tears fall, let the emotions wash over him, and before long he was shaking, wracked with sobs, unable to close the gate he’d opened. This was the first time in his entire life, and after life, that he’d really let himself feel and understand everything and it’s overwhelming. He turns his thoughts towards Cas, thinking about the happy memories they made together, thinking about the way his smile lights up the room, about how he’s an angel the size of the Chrysler building and yet he is the most awkward being Dean has ever met. Dean let out a watery laugh, feeling himself calming down with every memory, with every thought. He feels his scar burn, but he pays it no attention.
“Dont watch with out me!” She called and claire paused the movie hat was rolling the beginning credits.
“God you're hot.” Dean said still admiring Cas,
“you think I don't love you?”
“Cas!” Dean whined, “such a mood killer.” Dean kissed him once more before curling his legs around Cas’ calves and cuddling up on top of him.
“Hey honey, I’m taking you on a vacation.” Cas said stuffing the items into an opened bag,
“Next order of business.”
“It's okay.”
“I dont have a halo.” He snapped. Rowena got off the bed and walked up behind Gabriel,
“Hey Ro?” Clary asked, when did she get here? Gabriel thought,
It would only be a matter of weeks before a resurrected Cas would have to watch Dean die too.
“BITCH!” Dean yelled,
“You said it was important.” Kaia said rilling her eyes and backing out of the parking space, “Can you turn on the GPS?” Claire did as asked and then laced their fingers together.
“Are too.”
“God, deanmon.”
“Thank you”
“Don’t do your puppy face at me. Dammit.” She stood up and shook Dean off as she walked to the dungeon.
“How many angels and demons do we have on our side? How many hunters do we have?” Gabriel asked as he walked past the kitchen,
“Clarence is leaving again.” Meg said plopping into bal’s lap, dean raised an eyebrow and cas just chuckled knowingly,
“He says it helps him sleep.” Sam just stared in shock at dean curled around cas as the drawing appeared on his skin. “I’ll talk to him at some point, go back to bed sam.” Cas said and continued to draw.
“Go to london.” Clary said matter of factly,
“Scuse us!” One shouted, Sam just smiled, he’d want kids someday. He was jolted out of his thoughts a second later when two grown men ran around them, one blonde, one black haired, followed by a red head who was going considerably slower, he stopped and said,
Dean Winchester’
“Um-hello, I’m Sam and this is Eileen, we called last week-or rather um Rowena did.” The beige clad man’s smile got bigger and pulled the two inside the bookshop, it had pots of large plants between the bookshelves and vines that wound around the pillars and walls.
“Neither do i.”
“Hey!”
“Neither do i but i dont think it’ll all be jelly beans and g strings,”
Castiel Winchester
Little did sam know that he wouldn’t be okay.
Thanks for making it this far, one more chapter to go! Yay! I hope this was tolerable :)
“Like yeah but I guess better late than never.” Sam laughed, then sat across from her, their knees touching,
I hope you like this chapter!
“I dont know.”
“Fancy as in pizza or fancy as in steak tartar and gowns?” Claire looked guiltily at her feet,
“No like really, I am sorry, i mock you, i practically question and judge every decision you make, and that’s not fair, its not-youre family cas, more than that,” dean noticed what he had said and looked at anything but cas, he also backed away a bit noticing how close he had gotten as he spoke,
“You like me” dean said quietly, smiling and blushing a bit-well okay-a lot,
When the three of them made it back to the house the lights were on and people were talking inside. Sam and dean shared a look and pulled out thier guns, Jack got a little scared and there was a faint breeze as his powers surged,
“Solution.” Dean answered as Sam jotted it down on a pad.
“It will be better for both of us.”
“You son of a bitch, bring him back! Bring them all back, Kelly, Kevin, Mom, even Crowley.” Dean stood at the back of the fast food restaurant, he was praying, praying to Chuck. He felt tears slide down his cheeks thinking of the light leaving cas’ eyes when Lucifer stabbed him, his wings burning an imprint on the sand. He continued to cry, feeling the anger at Chuck, at himself, at Lucifer, swelling, he suddenly turned and punched straight through the flimsy door. He composed himself and examined his hand, his knuckles were bloody and he could feel that he broke a finger or two, if John was here he’d get on his case about form but he wasn’t, that calmed dean down a bit. He turned his attention to the prayer he hadnt quite finished, “You did this, you wrote this story, you can fix it, please, please fix it.” He felt himself collapse onto his knees on the ground, still crying. He stayed like that for a time, as he started to get up, he leaned on the door,
“We’re getting close, can you run through the the case please.”
“Yep. Where’s he buried?”
“Alone! You two!”
“You would have been fine dean.”
The next chapter i mostly written but if it took so long for this one, I dont know how long it will take for the next one. Anyway I hope you liked it! Feel free to leave kudos and comments, they are greatly appreciated! :)
“Its okay sam, i love you.” Dean said, taking his last breath.
“1) food first, 2) we cant just grab it and burn it, we have to sneak in while they’re out.” Cas shrugged and sat down at the table.
“Are you being safe?” Jodi asked stealing the milk carton from cas as she walked into the kitchen. Both brothers groaned, embarrassed,
I did like writing this one, well the whole thing was fun to do, but this chapter and the one before it were just fun. Its nice to write the boys having a huge supportive, alive, family. Anyway(I say that a lot dont i) I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
“I dont have morning breath Dean.”
“More alcohol?” There was a cheer and cas materialized a case of beer and some fancy whiskey. Dean and cas walked into the living room and sat on the floor leaning against the couch as everyone else settled around them.
“Mhm, and?”
“I love you.” He whispered.
“What do you mean?”
Dean walked to the kitchen with cas still not letting go of his hand, he picked up two plates, balancing one plate on the forearm of the hand cas had claimed.
“This is weird, it's really formal, you don't do formal.” Claire said kicking her feet up on the table,
After watching all three hobbit movies, they scroll through netflix and find a fantasy YA show and they watch that, the argument being, that its a mix of the genres and no one has to speak of that night again.
“Yeah. How’s cas by the way? You two talk yet?”
“You know what he said about you was complete bullshit right? You’re not weak cas.”
“I’m not complaining, I was just going to say that I loved you.”
“And now we get to be happy without any miscommunication, or doubting, and you thought id say no?”
“It seems that since Jack closed purgatory to execute the next phase of our plans, the monsters we usually hunt have taken on the qualities of the angels and demons that can't get to the empty. I can destroy them though, I can make them die.”
“I can try but i think your best bet is leaving town, maybe it’ll go away after that.”
“What do y’a need me for?” Cas asked grabbing a plate of bacon and putting it on the table, he gestured to the stack of plates and silverware next to Jack and raised an eyebrow. Jack sighed theatrically and started to set the table.
“I made you practically speechless.” Cas said, proud of himself.
“Man the pda in here,” bal said coming to a stop slightly behind dean holding megs hand.
“Let’s move on before your brain explodes shall we?” She asked ushering him across the street and into a taxi. They arrived at the bookshop and stopped at the door. The old sign said A.Z. Fell and Co. another one detailed the schedule very unhelpfully,
“I’s okay, I need to spend as much time as I can with you before you leave.”
“Dean and Cas got together before us!”
“I will.” With the telltale signs of wings, Cas disappeared. Dean sat on the bed for a moment before walking out, closing the door with a slam and stomping down the hall with purpose.
“Yes Dean, I know, that's why it's a case.” Sam said irritably, “This isn't the first time either, 8 people every other day, ever 5 years for 20 years like clockwork.”
“Chuck.” Dean said simply, he gave sam a look and they walked further into the room, putting thier guns in thier waistbands again and greeted everyone else. They made thier way around the room, hugging lost loved ones, Kevin, Charlie, Mary, Bobby, Crowley, Bella, Jo and Ellen, Meg, and Balthazar(dean had to cover all the bases), the boys introduced jack to everyone as they made thier rounds. Bal and Crowley miracled alcohol and food onto the dining room table, and they all sat to have dinner as a family. Amara and chuck stopped by bringing rowena and the wayward sisters along.
“Hm, its kind of comforting occasionally.”
“We have one.”
“Dean?” Dean looked at him slightly pathetically,
They talked the night, and most of the morning away. Later they’d do a proper hunters funeral for Kelly and everyone else they’d lost for good, then they all drove to the bunker and got settled into their new life.
“Was that-“ eileen started to ask,
“For now you boys have to get to bed.”
“And you’ve been with us every step of this crazy ride and no matter how crazy it got you never backed down.”
“Nothing.” She signed and grabbed her own dinner.
“Love you.”
“Why?” Alex asked feigning ignorance,
“Im glad you like them, i do enjoy experimenting.” With that dean quickly chewed the bite he already took, but cas beat him to the question he wanted to ask,
“Only four more hours.”
“I-yes I did.”
“Did we just-“
“Guess not.”
They sat in silence for quite a while, always staring when they thought the other wasn't watching, never making eye contact, pretty much completely ignoring each other's existence.
He awoke the next morning, his face tear stained and red and assessed the damage. He combed his hair and took a hot shower, attempting to wash last night's outburst from his mind. Dean found himself, yet again sitting on his bed fresh tears threatening to fall.
