"You can relax, Anthony. I only mean to reclaim this…" She gently tucked her fingers into the collar of his shirt.
“I mean if you weren’t strapped down to that gurney, how good would you be at, you know, fighting and running considering the extent of your injuries?”
Steve just kept going, running like he never did before. Eventually they saw the end in sight. Just a few more yards and they would be through the wall. He could just make out the glow of the Human Torch as he flew about securing the perimeter.
“Oh no, oh God, you have that look about you. Like the one Steve got when he came up with a really stupid and suicidal plan.” Bucky commented almost exasperated.
"Oh? Do you mean me?" The Rhododendron sneered. Suddenly, that pink rabbit was face-to-face with Tony.
Our genius began to mutter every override code possible. Still the suit was dead. Jarvis had been booted from the system. He could not figure it out. He was on manual, the suit was still on, he should be able to regain control. His override code should be working. Suddenly, the full morbid reality had presented itself when his arms began to move… without his consent.
“Okay.” Tony replied simply. He waited a few more minutes before continuing. “Are you okay to continue?”
He was referring back to the incident where Tony had, in fact, fallen asleep standing up. And where, of course, Barnes took pictures and sent it to everybody. It was inadvertently the incident that began their burn war.
“Thank you, Father.” Thor replied with a scowl. He somehow managed to make it look respectful, considering.
He trailed off though knowing he may have said a bit too much. There was a big difference between being afraid to go home because no one would be there to greet you and being afraid because someone was…
Thor and probably the rest of the room, to be honest, could sense Steve’s distress and calmly came up with an alternative.
The moment he got to the door however he hesitated.  He did not even know what he was going to say. He did not know if Tony would even speak to him.  He groaned as he began to pace nervously in front of the door.  He tried to get his thoughts and order but they were a jumbled mess.
So Steve did. He thought about how he would find a way to ensure the safety of the kids. He would have to find someone who he could trust. Being targeted by the government made him a huge liability. He would want to ditch the kids but they are foreign here. But they had extremely useful abilities. He’d be able to avoid detection with them by his side. So he could travel nearly anywhere almost unseen. But where would he go?
“We’re several thousand feet under the surface! I don’t think even I could survive that kind of pressure! Dumb ass!” Bucky retorted.
“I don’t know how to be around you without fucking up somehow.  Either I’m going to give in and tell you or something worse.”  He admitted clearly distraught.
She returned his laugh, "It would take some millennia to regale all that I have learned about the great mother. Most, you are not meant to know anyway." She replied cryptically. "But I can tell you this. Yggdrasil is existence itself. She is everything and nothing. Everything that was, everything that is, and everything that has yet come to pass is Yggdrasil." She said reverently.
A/N: Yes, Yes, I know that I am a horrible person. If you really want to know why there was such a delay, you are welcome to ask. However I thought it best to just get this show on the road! Hellz Yeah! All general declaimers apply.
The genius coughed and hiccuped as he desperately tried to pull it together. His constant consumption of coffee and alcohol combined with his desperate lack of sleep made the nightmares all the more hideous, and as time went on made them incomprehensibly worse. He was truly afraid he was going to lose it, that he
He took a shuttering breath, "This was why it was so difficult to figure out your code. Why there were large quantities of code I could not hope to read."
“You got that, Jarvis?” Tony said instead, pulling his phone out again. “Put Graham on the tracking algorithm.”
"Ah, to thwart my nefarious plans. I suppose that is as good as a motivation is any. Your current chance for success does stand at a solid 98.8 percent." She replied almost exasperated.
He looked down at the child only to be met with the most extraordinarily devious puppy dog face in the history of ever. And that’s saying something considering that he had seen the business end of the Incredible Puppy Pout
"Power to do so, yes." She sighed. "However, even I am bound by the laws the great mother has bestowed upon this universe."
After Peggy came back from checking on the child making sure she really was asleep they made idle chitchat for a time.
Her hatchlings dropped dead out of the sky. The last of the chrysalises shattered in a mess of putrid ooze.
“If you hated so much stop reading it!” Steve retorted trying to unpin himself and failing miserably.
“I know it’s difficult for you to trust anybody with something so important to you, please…” He whispered as he leaned in and gently pressed a chaste kiss on Steve’s lips.
“Omm. Ritchie’s parents are going to be mad.” Tommy said after Steve opened the door and saw the damage.
Steve thought about how the man had appeared suddenly and disappeared just as suddenly. Since the man didn't know the year Steve idly thought if the man was a time traveler.
“Eleanor, darling, why don’t you go show Daddy your other drawings while I get dinner started.” She suggested with a wink.
This was his absolute last resort. He could blow the suit up from the inside. The only thing that gave him pause at this point was if he went through with this there would be no one to stop Calamity. But then again there would be nobody left to save
"It's you! You've come to help me. Please, those fools over there-" he pointed an accusing finger at our group of heroes. "They spoiled our plans! You must smite them!" He raged.
“I couldn’t trust them. My team that was sent to find you had direct orders from the president to kill you on site. To seek and destroy was their exact order.” Steve thought back to the transmission he heard on the Shield radio he borrowed from Coulson. It was that very order that cemented his decision to defect. “I was banned from active duty and not allowed to participate in that mission. I knew they were wrong, that you didn’t do what they said you did. No one was going to listen to me based on a hunch.”
“Ah, that’s the question isn’t it?  Can you save everyone from me?”  She smiled easily reading Steve.  “If you stop me they wake up and all will be as it was before, as if I were never here.  She answered.
Unfortunately, what I found on other planets was more of the same. The inhabitants finding inventive ways to subjugate, conquer and kill each other.
It took an obscene amount of concentration, pain and effort to finally heave himself through the window.  He lied on the floor in a heap for a moment trying to will the haze away.  He also took that time to steel his nerves knowing that in order to continue he would need the use of his legs.  The pain was going to be so intense, he knew that there was a possibility that he wasn’t going to make it.
He sighed. He tried to will the idea away but now that he had thought of it the more he realized that this was the next best course of action. He hated himself so much right now. But if it got him closer to Bucky before the others, well, then whatever.
God, this child was so beautiful, by far the most beautiful creature he had ever encountered in his entire life. He was sure even if he couldn't remember...
As soon as the bomb launched Bucky suddenly lurched into its path. He knocked it just right to send it on a new trajectory to the second unit sub. It detonated and sent the sub spiraling away. Tony cheered as he made the rest of the distance. Sub number one was about to retaliate when an actual explosive detonated near the little unit and sent it careening sharply.
“I completely agree with you! I mean no one has figured it out yet and they have had centuries to do it. Unfortunately, you only have weeks at the most.”
The Captain entered the specialized meeting room and realized there was only one other occupant. Recognizing the identity of the other person he was quick to introduce himself.
"You still had to get passed Tony." He said in realization. "But why? Why didn't you claim everyone the moment I said yes."
Tony was taken back to his childhood where he recalled stories told about this hero. Each story, comic book, and film depicted an imposing figure that couldn’t possibly have existed. This Captain America character had always been too strong, too unyielding, too noble, and too
Barnes saluted jerkily then twisted his hand around to flip Tony off before sitting back down. He smiled charmingly at Natasha then winked. Clint rolled his eyes, Wanda smirked and Nat… Blushed?
“Forgive me. I underestimated the work Calamity left for you. I truly did not comprehend the level of enormity and complexity you were working with.” She explained in contrition.
Steve really should have learned by now how Tony was when intoxicated. Something as innocent to Steve like removing Tony’s clothes to make him more comfortable as he slept meant something entirely different to the horny genius. He remembered almost too late as he felt Tony’s hand slip beneath his shirt. As much as every fiber of his being wanted Tony to continue he put a stop to it right away.
Steve was brought out of his reverie by a squeaky floorboard. Moments after, the bedroom door creaked open. His grin became impossibly wider when a head of unruly golden curls peeked through.
Steve was shocked out of his thoughts as Bucky cried out waking up suddenly in a fit. He sat up rapidly looking around wildly before his eyes settled on Steve. He huffed in relief for a moment, realizing finally where he was. His respite was short-lived however when he got a good look at Steve’s torso.
“And of course Mr. Stark, we shall sit down together so we can discuss thoroughly the force energy and presence I felt when encountering this foe myself through the minds of these patients.”
The next day and a half passed in a flash. Tony made sure to have all preparations completed by noon. Barnes was scheduled to have the first skeletal prototype mounted at 2 o’clock. The genius wanted to give him ample time to heal. The soldier’s healing rate had nearly tripled from what it was when Tony rescued him from the Raft. Constant good nutrition and exercise did wonders for him. After he made that first breakthrough and decided for himself to help, he had begun eating more and even took up exercising in the gym and sparring with whoever was brave enough to take him. Tony would never get tired of watching Natasha fold Barnes into one of those unique pretzels Tony himself has had the pleasure of experiencing. Our genius absolutely delighted in it.
But Tony didn’t have shrapnel in his heart. He stared at the paper, throat tight. There wasn’t a guarantee that it would work. But, God, he had something that might help him. Getting thrown here was already more than worth the pain. Jarvis would be overjoyed. Hell, Tony himself was clutching the paper to his chest, heart beating painfully against the plate. This was possibly going to change his life. He didn’t know how to thank Stark.
Steve dropped to his knees next to Tony, grabbing his hand. It was almost as cold as the ground. Steve stifled the panic, looking around for Jarvis. He found him in a corner, his glow even fainter than earlier. Steve took him in hands, feeling the faint beating of the heart.
He jumped into the air, whirling with the shield, kicking the suit of armour that was holding James in its chest, sending it careening backwards into the one holding Strange. Steve landed in a crouch, and when he saw that Jocasta was bringing the heart closer to her mouth, he didn’t think.
Steve tried to start a conversation with Jarvis but got pointedly ignored. He walked around the kitchen, looking for something to do. There were no customers to help, he’d cleaned the whole castle already, and dinner was still a long time away. What could he do?
Jarvis pulsed, once, twice, three times, sending out a powerful wave of compressed air right at Steve. It knocked him over, just as Stark threw open the door, completely surrounded by the blue glow. He flew to Steve, made a complicated gesture with his fingers, screaming something.
When he’s in the workshop, he takes care to disengage every part of the armour except for his right gauntlet. The blood on it hasn’t even dried yet. If he tilts his hand, there’s a faint glimmer, the slightest hint that there is something coating the deep red of the armour. To the naked eye, it might look like water. But the liquid is too thick, and the darkening of the wet parts of the gauntlet betray that it’s blood. Tony should wash the gauntlet, disinfect it, burn it. He can’t leave highly classified super-soldier DNA on his suit.
Right now, Steve was thinking about how hopeless his situation really was. He wouldn’t get any help from Stark, not after being that disrespectful towards him, which meant his only hope was to break the contract. But in weeks of searching, he still hadn’t come any further. Jarvis was of no help, never answering any questions that would aid Steve on his quest, choosing to remain silent or deflect instead. It was beyond frustrating, but Steve couldn’t blame Jarvis. After all, his contract prevented him from breaking it or helping anyone break it. And now, Steve didn’t even know if Jarvis would honour his part of the pact even if Steve somehow managed to break the contract. Jarvis was fond of Stark, and he was rightfully angry at Steve for insinuating that he practised black magic and ate people’s hearts.
He can’t help but ask for it and dreads the answer as soon as the words leave his mouth. He scrambles to cover it up.
“I guess I didn’t imagine the angry mermaid screaming? And that it’s the reason why the marks have grown so fast in so little time?”
There had to be a loophole Steve could use. Maybe he could play a game of “yes or no” with Jarvis, and hope that if he guessed right about what Tony had given him, Jarvis would say “yes” and that would break the contract.
He just needs a little time. Just needs to find a shred of motivation. Just needs a little push and then he’ll face the day. Steve will understand.
He stopped in front of the dining table. There was a stack of papers, several pieces of charcoal on top, left there by Stark a few days ago when he’d rushed out in the middle of drawing diagrams and complicated designs.
It didn’t really surprise Steve, to be honest. He’d been surprised at first when he discovered that Stark wasn’t charging them enough, but it made sense in a weird way. Steve himself was essentially living in Stark’s house for free, eating and sleeping without paying anything. Stark had even given him clothing after a few days spent in the castle. “To be more presentable”, Stark had said, but Steve suspected it was because the wizard had seen that he had worn the same clothes three days in a row.
He really was lucky that Tony didn’t exude this air of importance. He’d never have dared to talk to him otherwise.
There was at least some truth behind Potts’ words, since his drawings had animated themselves some time ago now. But the jump from some cosmetic spells to breaking a powerful curse felt too far, still.
Steve tied a rag around the lower part of his face, to help against the smell (it was revolting. How did Stark wash himself in these conditions?), and armed himself with a bucket, a block of soap, and a sturdy brush. It was time to clean the bathroom.
If Tony survives, on the other hand, he’ll either get executed, or taken by SHIELD to be experimented on. Tony doesn’t think he’ll be in any state of mind other than bliss after sucking Steve dry, he’ll be easy to catch. But on the off chance that he escapes, what will he become? A fugitive? A beast roaming dark alleys and abandoned houses? A new urban legend, the kind that kids whisper to others late at night? An uptick in statistics for bloody anonymous murders?
It wouldn’t hurt anybody but himself. Steve will never know, and Tony can live with a little extra shame. He already knows he’s not a good man, after all.
Thirty seconds later, a suit flew out through the black door. Steve wished he could fly, too, fly high and forget about his problems for a while. He didn’t want to sit in the shop, welcoming clients and pretending to be happy while all he wanted to do was cry out in despair.
The door was yanked away from him, Steve barely avoiding losing his balance. The scarecrow was there again, trying to get past Steve. It was fast and strong, but Steve had the advantage. He put the shield between them, pushing with all his might to make the scarecrow lose its grip on the door. (How it was gripping the door in the first place, Steve had absolutely no idea.)
It should be said again: Steve was doing everything wrong. Or rather, he was too caught up in Tony to think about all the other things he was supposed to do.
Steve, still coughing his lungs out, couldn’t protest as Tony used magic, clearly using his last reserves, to ease the burn in his chest. The cough abated, and it was Steve’s turn to put a hand on Tony’s back, easing him into a lying position. He was sweating profusely, his hair plastered to his face, his eyes electric. The scales were covering various parts of his body, reminding Steve of the toll that using his magic took on Tony. With the marks and the scales and the feathers, Tony didn’t look like himself anymore. He looked more beast than human.
When Jarvis didn’t answer, Steve put the flowers on the table and started making two bouquets. There were delicate white flowers that would fit well with the dark blue ones, and the yellow flowers would complement the red and orange ones perfectly.
Steve had hoped he would get useful information about the man’s physique, but the women couldn’t seem to settle on one look. He stood up, having finished his pastry a while ago, and walked past them just as one of them told the others that the man went by the name of Anthony Stark.
The two last sentences weren’t meant for Steve, but he heard them clearly, nonetheless. It seemed that the King and Stark knew each other well, because the King was broadcasting light-hearted annoyance and not anger.
There’s no coming back from this, even for the two of them, who’ve defied death more times than should be allowed.
He stares back at Steve, who’s entangled in the sheets, one elbow braced under him, the other hand outstretched towards Tony. Their eyes lock.
They entered the castle together, Steve careful to put himself between Tony and the scarecrow. Tony was still sleeping, he was vulnerable. Steve would protect him. He trusted James to be on his guard as well.
Had Steve heard that right? Was Jarvis telling on him? He turned to Jarvis, outraged, but his budding anger turned to confusion as the fire demon made a puzzling grimace at him. What did he mean? Had Steve done something dangerous? Was this something Stark should know? And if so, why?
When he was done, he sat on the chair, observing Jarvis. Jarvis, who was glowing red and orange, just like any ordinary fire. He’d been so different the day before, glittering in the colours of the rainbow. Thinking back to it, Steve came to the realisation that Jarvis had glowed and shined just like the stars that Steve had almost caught. There had been the same explosion of colours, the same colours even.
Yinsen told him something when he died, but Tony couldn’t hear him over the sound of gunfire. He’s sure they were inspiring words. It could have been anything. A man’s last words, and they were lost in the fight around him.
There were sounds, too, he realised, muffled by the thick wall of ice around him, but there. Deep sounds that reverberated through his prison, the vibrations traveling all the way to his core. Thrumming sounds. They had to be very loud, for Steve to feel them.
He took Stark aside, thanking him again for the help with the heart. He also made sure to add, loudly enough that Cap would hear them: “I think you and Cap should talk about your feelings. They’re more reciprocal than you might believe.”
He smiled at Steve, snapped his fingers, and the musket was suddenly back in the soldier’s hands, whole and unmarred.
When the kitchen was spotless again, Stark flicked his finger, and Steve floated to the couch. He could move again as soon as his back hit the cushions.
Steve latched onto the words of the man. She wanted to know about him? And Tony had been looking for him?
“So, I made you a thing! Your adventure with the frying pan got me thinking that you need something to protect you if you ever get into danger again. I can’t let you destroy all our pans either. And what better than a shield? I got some good metal and made this for you. Here!”
Steve, who is silent, mouth twitching, eyes turbulent. He’s having a hard time accepting what Tony’s saying. His voice is rough when he answers:
He’s shivering again. The temperature hasn’t changed. It’s so, so tempting to close his eyes and let sleep take him. He knows he would fall asleep in minutes; his mind is heavy with exhaustion.
Tony stood up, feathers fluttering to the ground as he stepped towards James, and said, in a terribly quiet voice:
Was there no way that he could convince the King? Appeal to his clemency? But that meant that Steve would have to explain why Tony had to stay away from the Witch of the Waste, and that was something that only three people in the whole kingdom knew. If miss Potts didn’t, then the King couldn’t be aware either.
If he’d been strong, he would have found a sturdy bag of rice and punched it until his knuckles hurt. But now, he couldn’t do that, could he? What was he going to do? He needed to get this anger out, it was infecting him, festering in his heart, and he hated it.
“It’s too late for that. You can’t. Not even like this. You know it’s not real, and you won’t let yourself pretend all the way. I don’t know why, to be honest. I touch you, and I speak to you. I could kiss you, I think. Do you want me to kiss you?”
Instead of trying to come up with a strategy to fight the Witch, Tony had left to chase after Strange, who might be dead, James was eating raw bacon, and Steve was sulking while chewing on a piece of bread.
The force of the explosion threw Steve off his feet, hurling him at the nearest wall, and he braced himself, curled into a ball and hoped that the shield would protect him from the worst.
Seeing as the Director was about to adjourn a meeting; she had to interject mournfully before he had a chance to.  “Director, there is something serious that we all must consider here.  It came to me when Clint was pitching a fit.  If this alien is picking people with horrifically tragic backgrounds, what stopping it from picking any one of us.  If it can come and go as it pleases…  You said yesterday Steve that we knew absolutely nothing about its capabilities that anything and everything we can do to stop it would be useless.  Loki by himself was nearly impossible to overcome what if this thing can easily take any one of us down regardless of any of his or her special abilities.”  She stopped obviously getting her point across by looking in everybody’s stricken faces in the room.
But before any of them could react further, Bucky launched out of the elevator swiftly and efficiently knocking all three of them out without warning. Tony stared at the scene dumbly. All three officials hit the ground even before he could raise his hand with the wristwatch to stun them. Tony walked out of the elevator, awkwardly stepping over the men. Bucky took a deep breath before teetering sharply and bracing himself against the wall.
“There’s a different program that is connected to your restraints that Jarvis hasn’t infiltrated yet. If it senses the removal of your restraints without the authorization code the alarm will sound.” Tony replied as he continued to examine the stats.
Tony looked up at him slowly, his hands falling away from his face. “And what position would that be?” He bit bitterly.
This was his life. This was his beautiful family. When the child realized Steve was awake she bounded to him merrily.
After a few short hours of travel they made it to California. Luckily or unluckily whichever way you want to see it, Von Doom was still wreaking havoc, searching for whatever it was he was looking for.
They… They could have been together. Tony could have been sharing his love with Steve but instead he managed to completely and utterly drive him away.
“The ‘Trans Cosmic Tele Communication Device’ will be fully operational within four hours, and we will be talking to Asgardians that are millions of light years away.” Tony said almost giddily.
"How can this be real?" He whispered to himself. "I know I've drawn this man and his armor. What is happening?"
Barely he could hear something in the distance.  He felt something akin to indifference before the white turned to black and he felt no more.
The Crazy genius almost backed away from the beautiful intensity of Steve’s smile. Is it wrong to admit how horribly turned on the billionaire is right now?  Probably. ‘Hmmm…I wonder how he would react if I told him so.’ Tony thought mischievously. Well as they say curiosity killed the cat, good thing Tony is not a cat.
He didn’t even have time to utter a sigh in relief when he saw the twins disappear before he was suddenly reacquainted brutally with the asphalt of the road. He wanted to curse himself for being right yet again as his mind processed a red and gold blur as his face met the pavement. He rapidly forced himself back on his feet and desperately tried to get a handle on the situation.
Calamity moved to sit on the crates as Steve began to pack his things swiftly. After he heaved the pack onto his back he turned to her.
“Oh yeah, Thor said the same thing when I showed this to him.” Tony said. “He was able to confirm that it was an accurate representation of Yggdrasil but could not ascertain much else, even after consulting the historians of Asgard.” He shrugged tiredly. “I’ve personally explored as much as I could about the lore. I honestly have no idea how to fit anything I found into a working key for the data.”
Tony grabbed Barnes and exited the Raft with impressive force. As he ascended in the waters he realized he was being tailed.
Tony's only response was to bite down on his bottom lip resolutely resolved to allow nothing to distract him. He hooked together his face plate and arc reactor to what he had already managed to assemble. He repurposed the HUD into the function the tablet provided. He then deftly attached is deconstructed gauntlets using the focusing power of his repulser technology to act as a makeshift spatial disorder. He had already plugged that part into an iridium core he salvaged from the original device.
However, when he opened his eyes and looked out the window again, the man was gone. Steve blinked in surprise a couple of times before darting out the back door hoping he would catch the guy and hopefully get some answers.
He quickly left the room. As he made his exit he bumped into Natasha and Clint who were clearly eavesdropping. He said nothing as he sidestepped them and continued to leave the compound. He was happy to learn that his imprisonment had been lifted. He needed air and miles to run. He did not have a destination in mind, not in the least. All we wanted was to feel free.
He held the paper up for all to see. There staring back at them was the woman from the video. Clearly visible upon the intricate ancient etching.
“Tony, I’ve known you for nearly fifteen years now. We’ve lived together and we were even in an honest to God relationship. I know you, Tony.” She pulled up a stool and sat next to him. She gently grabbed his face. “I’m not going to pry you for details but Tony, I can see it as clear as day. You’re in love with someone.” She smiled sadly at him.
“I had Jarvis search everything he could so that we may know that we’re dealing with the possibility of just one alien.  Since the cases were so random and so far away from each other at times I was afraid we might have been dealing with a few of them all working together.
His entire being was screaming at him that he knew the answer, that he knew the answer weeks ago. But he refused to listen to himself, desperately trying to remain in blissful ignorance. Because, if it was true… No it can’t be!
"That's right!" Natasha said with a sharp intake of air. "She said 'You have seen the worlds I have created for them. They are happy and at peace.'"
“Professor, you, Hank and Scott will remain here and protect our fallen comrades. It would be the perfect time for someone else to strike now that we are so vulnerable.”
Then, unexpectedly, a shrill alarm sounded and Rumlow got distracted. Bucky sprang for him. Brock gathered himself enough to retaliate. He gave our soldier a nasty uppercut to his wounded abdomen. However, Rumlow was too late to realize that it was Bucky’s intention to take the hit in order to get past his guard as our soldiers knee collided brutally into Brock’s stomach. The impact landed perfectly in the soft spot just below his rib cage, thrusting upward excruciatingly. Brock hit the floor hard on his knees and began to vomit and choke all at once. The impact was so intense it sent his internal organs on the fritz, his stomach trying to expel everything it could and his lungs spasming, completely unable to retain air.
“Ok here’s what we can do: You contact Thor with your, uh, ‘space phone’, he and Asgard has abundant knowledge of other alien races. If there is an alien behind all of this then the Asgardians would likely know. We should also get Dr. Banner in on this, you need to send him the information that you have gathered and have him look at the patient files and see if the ‘specialist’ missed something as well as get his general opinion on the situation.” Tony perked up at the Captains commanding tone.
"Hell no!" Bucky exclaimed. "No way in hell! That is Steve's thing. I- No, Nope." Barnes backed away.
Tony's head snapped to her as feelings of shock and dread washed over him. There she was standing there next to Steve's IV drip, ever still and ever serene.
She sighed heavily, "I suppose I should explain further. As forthcoming as I had been, there were perhaps a few things I may not have been entirely clear or honest about."
The child twisted around in Steve’s arms and aimed the sonic pulse at the immense wall of zappers. The pulse shoots out and immediately the zappers start to disintegrate. Realizing with a thrill what he was capable of Kevin wiped his tears and started to wave the pulse around madly destroying all the zappers he could. He started screaming and laughing and crying all at once. It was vastly cathartic to the child but immensely unsettling to the others.
“If that is all anyone is going to contribute then we will proceed. Barton and Romanov, you two will be on standby—“
"Yes, well, the Asgardians do have a somewhat solid grasp of the concept." She conceded. "And as to how I went from seeking the secrets of the universe to harvesting souls, the answer is quite simple really, empathy."
“It was my hands, my bow that did them in. I know, I know logically that it’s not my fault, that there was absolutely nothing I could do but it was still me. I will never forgive myself for that, not really.”
Ten minutes later he reemerged clean and comfortable. Pepper looked better but still a bit disheveled. She had spent most of that ten minute window on the phone trying her hardest not to make death threats. She sighed deeply when Tony sided up to her.
“I’m so sorry Tony. But I couldn’t let you die. I couldn’t.”  He choked down a sob. Tears were trailing down his own cheeks now.
In the infirmary of the tower in an isolated room, the sound of a heart monitor echoed throughout the facility. The sole occupant lied upon the sterile gurney, deathly still. His once Golden hair lay dull and listless upon his forehead. Cuts and scrapes marked his beautiful face. Deep lacerations marred his arm and abdomen. Bruises littered his body, the ones on his neck were shaped like fingerprints. His lips were cracked, his muscles were torn and his bones were broken. Yet, despite the horrors his body endured, none matched the agony of his heart.
“And here’s Ellie Rogers and Rocky coming up on the left passing GallantFox on the outside just past the third quarter pole. SeaBiscuit still in the lead but Rocky gaining fast.”
“Okay Rogers, if that’s how you want to play it, then fine, you may do the dishes. And,” She smirked. “Since you suddenly love doing them so much you should really do them after every meal.” Uh oh… “What kind of wife would I be if I begrudged my dear husband of something he ‘loves’ so dearly?” She smiled wickedly as she patted his cheeks.
“Yes I did. But you know what? It was all worth it. Do you know why?” He asked looking her in the eye. Peggy’s eyes he noted.
It did not escape Tony’s attention that if he had given into his hate, anger, pettiness and petulance, he would have failed. The exact same way he failed Steve. It was Calamity’s intention to use Tony’s anger and insecurities to drive Steve away so that she could be in the perfect position to claim him. It was also her intention to use his rage and hate to eliminate the one person in the world that could help Tony save them.
Just throw a bunch of random villains at him all at once. That’ll do the trick. Well, if he stayed out of sight for as long as he could maybe he’d put that off for a little bit longer.
On the other side next to Maria were Bruce, Natasha then Clint. The Director was at the relative front walking about as he continued.
Steve obeyed dutifully taking his seat quickly, whilst Tony took his sweet ass time to find his seat next to the Captain. The Professor remained where he was near the head of the table. Beside him were Steve then Tony and Coulson.
"Of course, Babydoll." He assured with a winning smile. "Let me finish this first." He said picking up the mower and pocketing the whetstone.
Steve slowly slid his left hand into Tony’s soft, dark hair still cupping his face as he moved his right hand to the small of the genius’s back to pull him closer.  Tony brought his hands up to rest on Steve’s waist.  Their bodies were pressed together almost intimately and still neither broke eye contact.  Both almost wanted to moan at the profoundly personal exchange of body heat.
(Maybe it’s the media. He hates dealing with the media. After all the flashing lights and cameras and microphones, he
He can see it behind his own shut eyes, the few strands of hair that tend to fall down against Steve’s forehead, and Tony’s tempted to brush them back with the assumption that they’re there, but he isn’t sure if Steve’s that light of a sleeper or not, so he opts not to just because he wants to stave off any awkward conversation. He does need to talk to Steve, and this is the

that trouble, it still doesn't get to pay off. "Damn it..." He's occasionally glancing toward Steve, whose gaze is directed forward out the glass. "So close." He's whispering to himself for the most part, though he knows Steve can hear him with that super-soldier hearing all the same. Besides, being in the middle of space? Silence. Dead silence. Everything else is loud in comparison.
fugitives on the run? Tony can’t say that he’s against the help, because they all need it as this threat is bigger than anything they’ve ever imagined (false, he’s seen this outcome before,
Steve tilts his head toward the kitchen. “There’s some leftover tacos.” The way he speaks, fond and considerate of those damn tacos.
A few moments pass between them, and Tony’s kind of zoned out of their environment. No birds, no idle chatter from passer-bys, nothing.
With his help, Tony stands up. It’s the first time he catches a look at Steve’s face since being pulled out of the water, and what he sees?
There's a moment of silent, though not remotely uncomfortable or stiff. Instead, both of them break into a chuckle and he swears, he really does just fall a little bit more in love with him all over again.
The memory that this would be the hour when Steve would be up, leaving for his run, is what settles deep in the crevices of each wire connecting to and from his heart. One would think he's got a flaw in his code.
As the silence settles between them, Steve is rather nonchalant in the way he speaks, "Ah, at least it's a good view."
A voice in his head echoes, “Occam’s razor.” There’s truly only one reason, and though Tony originally doubted Steve’s potential of loving him, that doubt is fading.
They’re having an Avengers movie night, because that’s a thing they do. And then later, they play some other kinds of games, like Monopoly and Jenga, and they are all
He’s just created more trouble for himself, and he isn’t sure if he wants to see what this next message consists of — doesn’t want to look at it and find himself sending another message.

(He always did think he'd have more time with Steve. An always or a forever or—no, he'd just been foolishly optimistic.
"I know. I read your diary," he retorts swiftly, and the chuckle it gets out of Steve is like music to his ears. Oh, how he's missed Steve's laughter, his dry humour and sarcasm. The world thinks he's pure, nothing but the golden boy picture that he's had to paint in his time, and sure, he is sometimes, but—
things. Tony is to blame, too, but he's never been good at this, and he's not sure he ever will. If Howard taught him anything—bastard that he was—it was to keep his emotions in check, because
Steve breaks the silence with a quiet, “I appreciate it, Tony.” He looks… well, he doesn’t look uncomfortable, but there’s a furrow between his brows that’s all too familiar now. That’s his thinking face. “I do, trust me. I guess I’m uh—” Steve sighs and this time when his arms crosses over his chest, it’s a defensive mechanism. A shield itself. “— it’s complicated. I don’t think you’d understand.”
, but there’s this weight pressing him into the ground telling him that he absolutely does not belong around any of them. They’re the ones who walked away from him. If they want to talk to him, they’ll have to come find Tony themselves, and quite frankly, Tony doesn’t actually want that.
no, anyway. He's Tony Stark. Iron Man. He helps fund SHIELD operations. Besides, it's not as if they've told him he can't stay in the room or anything…
moving on. Do you know how terrifying that is? To just… let it all go. All I’ve ever known, just to become history. That’s… that’s something, Tony. I don’t know how to describe it, but…” He clears his throat and shakes his head. “I can’t shake the feeling that I should feel more
Steve turns, and there's a hint of a half-smile brewing there, barely lit enough to notice, but Tony notices. "Your jokes, I just don't get 'em."
His fingers loosen their grip on Steve’s shirt. Steadies his hand on his waist entirely, leans his forehead against Steve’s. “That…”
Although Steve’s quick to adapt and learn, it doesn’t make it any easier on the brain, or more specifically, matters of the heart.
As if his thoughts are spoken aloud, Steve shifts, grunts, and then a quiet, yet hoarse voice utters, “Tony?”
) She calls him, and he picks up, and they talk, albeit briefly, and then the conversation is over. It feels like only a second between them before the call drops, something about having to deal with PR. He takes notes of the way her voice shakes, imagines the redness of her eyes and panic that had probably seized her chest before everything turned to absolute fucking shit.
to compromise, tried to appeal to Steve in every way he could under the pressure of Secretary Ross breathing down his neck, but it hadn’t been enough then.
When the phone lights up an hour later, it turns out that Steve Rogers, in fact, did not just roll his eyes and get back to his secret world-saving duties, but decided to
Tony is uncertain of the path he's walking down. He's usually always chosen to do things intentionally—or not, really, he's been reckless and impulsive way too many times to count—or for particular reasons in mind, but this time? He doesn't know exactly what he's doing. All he knows is that AIM isn't what it presents itself to be, and if there's any inkling of the desire to serve justice, it's the time to do it now.
"Glad to have you back." He then clears his throat and—are his palms getting sweaty?—looks at Steve before eyes dart back to the photo of Peggy as Steve sets it down. He watches the way he wipes his own hands, wringing the towel around each finger. "You know I just…" The photo reminds him of something. Something he found out a few hours ago. "…I found out that the satellite you were in was under my name. Or, well…dear old Dad's name."
“If you had something to say,” Tony starts rather carefully (surprisingly), “now would be the time to say it. I don’t have all day to be consciously aware of your overbearing presence while I try to make some repairs.”
, but when Tony takes a plunge into the ocean, he can already feel the cold water seep into his skin and bones through both the hole and the slashes to his armour that leave him and all systems exposed. Funny. It soothes over the burn at his side, though he has a feeling it’s not doing him any favours in reality. Tony can’t swim deftly in the suit, so he has to get out at some point, but he’s roughly fighting Red Skull in the water. Gravity and water and a heavy metal suit don’t exactly cooperate, but when he manages to finally get one fluid punch against Red Skull’s face with his gauntlet, it knocks him out.
Begrudgingly, Steve’s plan, to an extent, works. Tony can’t seem to get rid of the damn thing. Two days with it, and all he can think about is how incapable he is at permanently keeping this piece of junk out of his sight. He can shove it in the drawer of his nightstand, dump it into the trash, and he still finds himself returning with the solid weight in his hand, cursing under his breath as he wipes it off with a cloth. He subconsciously thinks about it all the time, how it could buzz while he’s in the shower or when he’s off making sure Peter doesn’t get himself killed. It doesn’t ring or buzz, of course. He’s had it for
Tony can make an a hundred-slide slide powerpoint with names of all the people that have betrayed him and left him to dust. He knows what it’s like to be laying alone in bed, feeling like he’s both drowning and flying thirty-thousand feet in the air. He’s no stranger to ghosts and skeletons in his closet or the blood on his hands. Most would much rather flee before they have to handle all the monsters under his bed and the shadows outside his window.
Rawness, in any sense of the word when it came to things like feelings, were just outside of his arsenal. He could program and code and invent the newest damn clean energy source, but when it came to expressing how he felt? Immediate error in his code causing him to malfunction; and it's quite embarrassing, at that. It's always made him feel incredibly
guilty than he already is. "Yeah, look, I just—I know I'm not directly linked to that in a way, but I sorta am? Anyway, I should've known. It was Stark Industries property to begin with, and even with the company liquidation, I should've thought about looking into that earlier. The point is, I'm—jeez, you know I'm not good at this—sorry. I'm sorry." The way the words just come tumbling out of his mouth, letters and words rolling off his tongue faster than his brain can even process it.
Kamala stalls for a second in silence, but he's not sure if she's unconvinced or just trying to remember what was asked of her. "Yup, uh...oh! Bruce just wanted to talk to you real quick about something JARVIS picked up. And…um…
Tony wonders what the look on Steve's face is right about now. He can’t really see much of a proper reflection on the glass. Well, he’s
Tony cracks a sly little smile, an attempt to lighten the mood. “Why, you didn’t think you’d get rid of me that easily, did you, Cap?”
It’s hard to not smile at that, to not be pleased by such a turn of events. While he may not have been able to take that jump himself, it seems at least Steve has the gumption to take action.
Steve’s brows raise, and when he takes a look around, he lets out a quiet laugh. “You know, it sure does seem like it.”
Put on a fake face, of course. That’s the obvious answer. He should be thankful they’re here to help, and he

). If he'd been the one to fly some ship into the cold water, he sure would've died. Not even the Iron Man suit would’ve saved him from that, but Tony knows better than to compare scenarios. Regardless of what they’ve both been through, it’s
A sigh, something between disappointed and exhausted. Tony knows it even after two years of missing out on it, finds himself reacquainting himself with every bit of Steve’s ticks and tells. “I … heard that kid was with you. The one from Queens?”
when he’s not (and yet, he believes the words himself). He’s made his mistakes, has far too many years of blood staining his fingers. He’s followed by the ghosts of the deceased who’ve fallen victim to his weapons and his shortcomings, the skeletons that pile up in his closet, already threatening to spill. There may just be a graveyard out there full of people he got killed with his weapons and the people he
The dog was Lord Fury’s? It made even less sense. He wasn’t the kind of man who had dogs, Steve thought. And why had the dog attacked Stark? Was there some bad blood there as well? What in the world could Stark have done to anger a
He thanked Lord Fury and asked for news about his sister. She was as hard-working as she had ever been, striking a quick friendship with one of the other apprentices, the lord told Steve. She was very promising and had already climbed the ranks of the guild in the short time she’d been here. She had immediately understood that there was more to Stark than met the eye when the wizard had first approached her and she had reported to her superiors with surprising insight. She’d even assured them that she would never fall in love with him, because her heart belonged to someone else already.
“No, the shrapnel, I need to keep the chestplate on to keep the shrapnel out of my heart. This is way worse. What happened?”
Steve likes Tony, and Tony likes Steve. They’re avoiding each other like teenagers. Does Steve write Tony’s name in his notebook? Does he draw little hearts with T+S in the middle? Does he dream of Tony, does he lust after Tony as Tony lusts after Steve? Does he think back to their sparring session when he’s in his bed? Does he touch himself at the memory? Does he thirst after Tony, does he want to taste him like Tony wants to taste Steve?
He was right. If the King sent him on a mission to fight the Witch, she would have more chances to kill him or curse him further. Steve had to help him.
Steve had brought the mandrake root into the castle, and Tony had cast the spell to make it grow a child. It had been a team effort, a dark part of Steve’s brain pointed out and laughed.
“Leave me alone,” Tony says. He regrets his words almost instantly. The quiet hurt on Steve’s face is almost too much to bear. With Steve like this, so close, so crisp, Tony almost forgets. He screws his eyes shut again. Sometimes it helps.
Steve looked around him, half expecting to see a wolf lunge at him, but he was completely alone. The snarling was coming from the bushes a little further away, just next to where a sturdy stick was jutting out of the shrubbery. It would make for a good walking stick, Steve mused, as well as a possible weapon against the animal. He inched nearer, and on his third try, managed to pull the stick out of the bushes. It wasn’t a stick, however, but a scarecrow that had gotten itself stuck somehow. The scarecrow was strangely clad, with a dark red robe of sorts, adorned with swirls and symbols that Steve didn’t recognise.
But Tony was already convulsing, the marks spreading over his whole body, until his skin was covered by their black mass. He jerked silently, then fell limp. Across from him, Jarvis cried out as his flame died. The only part left of him was his core, black as coal, a very faint blue glow the only sign that he was alive.
Instead of hurting him, the spell bounced back from his shield. His shield could protect him from magic as well, then. He could use that to his advantage. If he managed to get Tony behind him, he could act as a mirror and wall at the same time, reflecting the Witch’s spells, protecting Tony.
“It was a stupid coincidence. I was in Brooklyne, trying to find an empty building for us to move into, and I got distracted when I saw your painting supply shop. I thought, hey, you know what, that could work, and then I—”
Tony turned around, reaching for a piece of metal, and any inappropriate thoughts of Steve’s died a pitiful death.
“I’m not telling you to kill yourself, Tony,” Steve sighs. “We both know you can survive a heart attack.”
“Of course I do! You can never be too careful with men like him. I hear he bewitches every beautiful young man or woman he comes across. They fall in love with him instantly, and follow him back to his castle, and then he rips their heart out of their chest and eats it. I told my daughter to keep her older children off the streets after nightfall, and you should do the same.”
Sharon presses on the wound, and now that he turns his head, he can see that she’s asking for help. They’re alone on the court steps, now, the bystanders long gone. A few U.S. Marshals are standing around them, guns drawn, but there’s no EMT in sight.
Whatever he was doing, it worked, because the dog started to shake himself, almost closing his eyes, the picture of utter concentration. With a low grunt, he started shifting, growing and darkening into the man that Steve had seen before.
He woke up at dawn, his body aching and tired. He had to sort through Natasha’s clothes until he found a shirt and pants that were small enough for his new stature. His red leather shoes still fitted him, which was a small mercy, since Natasha had taken both her pair of shoes with her. He took his own coat, the warmest piece of clothing he owned. It was too long on him, reaching almost to his shins instead of mid-thigh, but with the sleeves rolled, it did its job. He took a small bag with food and the meagre amount of savings he had scraped together over the years, wrote a note that said that the shop would be closed indefinitely due to urgent personal matters, put it on the door, and locked all the doors and windows.
He could fly for hours. Or more accurately, he could be flown for hours. Because there was no mistaking that Jarvis was the one in control. It didn’t bother Steve; he was more than happy with being flown around as long as he could enjoy the view. It was one less thing to think about. He could enjoy the flight, let his thoughts wander where he wanted, all with no fear of crashing or missing his destination. Speaking of, how far where they from Shield?
Which was why he was here, staring down two soldiers who had had too much to drink, to help the girl, who clearly wanted nothing to do with them. His shout made them look up, and the men’s faces turned angry when they realised, they had been caught. Now came the tricky part. They could back off, or turn their anger towards Steve, or worse, towards the girl. So he made himself a big target, puffing up his chest, frowning—Natasha called it his “I’m disappointed in you” frown— and made his voice carry loud and clear.
Tony came back long after lunch, his skin pale and clammy. It looked like the marks were having a greater effect on his health, then. He didn’t bother covering them up, the collar of his tunic half-open. There was an air of disheartenment about him. He dropped down on the chair near the fire, gazing at Jarvis.
Though a grand and profound part of him yelled and screamed at him to get up and to find his primary team, begged and pleaded for him to find Tony; he could not move.  He was too devastated to the point of non function.  He was broken into so many pieces he did not know where to start to piece himself back together.
Only when Tony's chest began to burn from lack of oxygen did they part. The moment they were no longer caught in love's embrace they were swarmed by their teammates. Their cheers of celebration and congratulations and triumph could be heard from miles around.
“Wow… So by being able to sense the other mutants you were able to tell that they had nothing to do with the victims?”  The Captain blurted out truly fascinated by the Professor’s ability.
Barnes gave a sharp nodded in acknowledgment before running off to show the world the Captain America was not giving up on them.
After a fairly epic and daring rescue that involved a god, a man with breath taking anger management issues, and a couple of master assassins, Captain America and Iron Man got out of the tunnel relatively in one piece which eventually led to a magnificent phase of stunning, wholesome team bonding. Most important though was Steve and Tony’s relationship.
“It’s all based on unique reoccurring patterns they found by observing astronomy, the cube, and nature itself. The universe is comprised of these patterns that occur when certain elements interact with one another. They manifest in sequences like the helix formula, Fibonacci numbers, golden ratio, divine proportions, and fractals.” He explained as he continued to type.
“Our team.”  Tony clarified as he was rapidly going through information on his phone.  “Jarvis says everyone is still in good health.”
"It's all right, dear, you didn't wake me." She said stifling a yawn. "It's about time I get up anyway."
“Nope, bad move. Don’t mess with my music...” Tony said irritatedly as he looked up at the intruder of his sanctuary.
Natasha had successfully pinched her fingers onto Clint’s left ear and proceeded to drag him out of the room.
“Stop being a baby. I need to see if your bones and the bone anchors are merging well. Your assessment of pain is highly unreliable.”
Bucky would spend days cooped up along with Steve, reciting wild and epic tall tales, coming up with weird verbal games and even producing a small collection of baseball cards to play with. Once Bucky realized Steve had a real knack for reproducing the likeness of the players on the cards he left for him, he did everything he could to dig up things Steve could draw with.
"Don't worry Ellie, I am happy to report that the battle with the dust bunnies was a no contest. Avalon slayed them effortlessly."
Steve gave him a broken smile, “Aren’t we all.”  The Captain sighed.  “It’s just that’s how I feel, useless.  I was useless my whole life before the serum, even after…”  His mind flashed back as he watched uselessly as his brother fell to his death.
Fury’s expression changed from indignant irritation to god forsaken horror for a fraction of a second before he took on a stoic face.  Nobody but Steve caught it. The Soldier concluded that Xavier must have told Fury something in his mind, some sort of threat likely.
Tears slid down the Soldiers cheeks and Tony knew in that moment that it wasn’t his sacrifice alone to bear. Everyone who knew Steve would also be making this sacrifice and forced to live with the outcome.
Steve almost wanted to smirk when he entered the kitchen to find Peggy with her arms crossed. She tried to look serious and threatening but was almost all lost due to her chubby face and large protruding belly. Her eyes remained deadly sharp, however, and Steve knew she meant business.
“What? No! Come on, Pep, we’re okay!” He said quickly. “It wasn’t that bad. It was mostly percussive. Hardly any flame at all.”
He shut the door on the genius, making a statement.  Tony stood there for a moment trying to grasp at what happened.  He was trying hard but failing at trying to understand the situation.  Steve did not deny that this was a date.  He did not become all flustered and demand that they were most certainly not on a date.  All he said was no.  Did that mean simply no to the kiss, or did he mean no to the entire statement or…  Tony was at a loss.  He shook his head vigorously and started to walk away.  He will just have to mull it over some other time.  He smiled to himself as he made his way to his own quarters.
The soldier stood there somewhat awkwardly, with the metal skeletal arm still hanging limply from his left shoulder. Tony turned to Barnes and took him in appraisingly.
Besides, if she hadn’t cursed him, Steve would never have walked into the castle and right into Tony’s life. They wouldn’t know each other the way they did. They wouldn’t have spent all this time together. Steve wouldn’t have found a—
“That will be the day I’m ten thousand days old. And by the curse, it will be the day the Witch of the Waste claims me.”
It was too fast for Steve to make out a coherent sentence, and seeing Tony so agitated only increased Steve’s nervousness. What could they do? What was going to happen now? Should they flee? Ask the King or miss Potts for help? Could they even help?
Steve laughed out loud, hugging Tony close, revelling in the slighter man against him. They’d done it! The Witch was gone, she hadn’t managed to kill Tony, they could still make it out—
? Running headlong into my domain, just because I told you I had Tony. What exactly did you think you would accomplish? Were you planning on glaring at me until I dropped dead?”
“Well, I’m sure he had very good arguments as to why he should refuse a King’s request. Please, enlighten me.”
Steve was on the streets of Ma’Hattan, in front of a grand shop window with golden letters proclaiming this was the consulting office of the Great Magician Potts. Around him, expensively dressed people walked, drove, rode to their respective destinations. A tram sped past. Steve looked down at the paper and noticed that the arrow was pointing left. It was a magical arrow. Of course. Steve was probably meant to follow the arrow to the given address.
It sounded almost too good to be true. Tony was essentially promising Steve that they would work together for the foreseeable future, they could even live together—not like
A lot of things happen during the night. Luckily, when you’re a drunk, people leave you alone. They know you don’t have anything worth any money, except for the booze. They know you won’t meddle. You ignore them, they ignore you.
The sight on the far wall was even stranger though. Several shelves were filled with small machines that made noise and moved slightly. They were glowing the same blue light as the castle and had a life of their own. Steve had seen automatons before, but these had a fluidity that the others had lacked. They looked almost alive. They were
It took a while, but when Steve was done, he had two beautiful bouquets. He realised with a start that he’d made one with the colours of his shield: white, marine blue and dark red; and the other one was a mixture of red, orange and golden yellow, with delicate accents of bright blue, just like Tony’s suit of armour.
“And maybe, when Stark comes back, I’ll tell him about your request. I bet he’d be happy to learn that his fire demon wants to escape.”
Steve doesn’t know what he does to Tony just by standing in the same room. The scent is so strong that Tony can smell him from three floors away. Tony has to breathe through his mouth when they’re in the same room, or else the smell clogs up in his nose, entering into his every pore, and drives him insane with want. His breaths are measured, in, out, in, out, until Steve leaves and Tony can almost relax again.
Steve comes to stand before him, looking down on him, keeping the power imbalance. It’s petty, and Tony wants to be petty too, wants to order his suits to restrain Steve, wants to stun him, keep him in a antigravitational field, make him stop hurting Tony, but he knows he won’t, because he doesn’t really want to, does he.
Sure, he could do that, piece of cake. He just needed to find a falling star first. And catch it. Who hadn’t done that?
His breath shudders out of him. He’s not crying anymore, but his eyes are heavy and prickling. The slightest trigger will be enough to set him off again.
His heart was still beating, but it was getting difficult concentrating enough to wait for each beat. How many…?
He didn’t turn his head, or even shout back, but he started directing the fight lower. Bit by bit, they descended, until they were nearly at ground level. It was still moving very fast, but Steve could keep up with them now, he was strong and quick enough for that. He jumped between the two just as the Witch directed one of her electric rays at Tony. The ray bounced back and hit her in the chest. She howled, convulsing, and Steve ran to Tony. He was barely standing now, every inch of his skin covered in scales or feathers now. His breathing was ragged, but he batted Steve’s hands away when he tried to support him, or at least give him a hand.
Steve stared at Jarvis, and Jarvis stared back, made out of a myriad of colours, so powerful he was almost blinding.
The worst part about this was that she was, irrevocably, right. Tony’s time had run out. Whatever happened, it would happen tomorrow. Tony would succumb to his curse, or fight the Witch and die, or, and Steve was hoping with all his being that it was this last option, he would fight the Witch and win. And find a way to stop the curse.
Good old Jarvis, who knew what to say to channel Steve’s anger into something productive. He was right, they needed to put the shop in order. And since Tony was gone, Steve would do it himself. Which was fine; he needed to let out some steam.
“Why exactly don’t you want to approach the Witch, Stark? Because from here, it looks a lot like cowardice. But I don’t think that’s the reason, is it?”
times, half of which he doesn’t even remembers. He can’t let the panic rise, because otherwise he won’t be able to concentrate on anything other than that number and the growing litany of whys.
He took a too deep breath and promptly started coughing all over the place. He doubled over, cursing his bad luck and ill-timed spells of coughing. Why was this happening right now, not two seconds after he’d said he could manage on his own? James even had the nerve to smirk, the cheeky jerk! Tony, on the other hand, had a look of concern on his face. Good, at least
, they're in. But it's one that doesn't stand a chance against Extremis 3.0. Tony congratulates himself on a coding well done, and spares a moment to laugh at the pathetic attempt to cage him.
He’s not drunk enough for this trip down memory lane. He can’t… He can’t deal with memories of Steve. Steve, who told Tony he gave him a home and then left him, Steve, who took off the Captain America mantle, Steve, who could be anywhere.
Tony was still chanting, eyes closed in concentration, sweat beading down his face. His hair was billowing, his feet a decimetre from the floor. Around him, the castle started to morph, walls changing shape and colour, bangs and clangs indicating that it was happening everywhere in the castle. Pans and pots were changing places, the very chair Steve was sitting on changing form and moving to another corner of the room. The whole interior was changing, until Steve realised that it was taking on the appearance of the places they were going to move to. Steve thought he recognised one of his own pots at the kitchen window.
Tony walked very carefully into the centre of the biggest circle. He put his feet together, standing tall with one arm outstretched sideways and the other holding Jarvis in front of him. The circles were pulsing blue now, the light having dimmed as Tony had walked into the circle, but steadily growing stronger as Tony chanted under his breath. Tony’s hair spread out, his tunic billowing. The pulsing light grew stronger, and Jarvis swayed where he was, burning brighter and brighter until he let out a hiss and
His eyes scan over the message once, he blinks, and then reads it again. “Could’ve said the same shit to my face,
In one second of quiet, which feels like it's difficult to get now with a helicarrier full of people from all over the place, he's beginning to feel that overwhelming urge of———
Call him a sentimental, nostalgic piece of work. His laughter is nothing but breathless, a tilt of his head back as eyes slide shut. He can’t believe this— the immediate response his mind and heart comes to. He doesn’t know why this seems to be the case, how carefully he can play his cards and still fall into Steve Rogers’ hands despite it all, how he thinks he’s always one step ahead but seems to end up right behind instead.
He doesn’t know what to say aside from that, to deflect, to reassure that he’s perfectly fine, that it’s just another day of being an Avenger.
, because they can’t just become the two they once were before everything went awry, and yet, Tony wants it. His heart wants it more than anything, but his mind won’t allow it. Refuses to let it become truth, become reality, because he doesn’t know how much longer he can suffer when it comes to this sort of pain. It’s an old friend, misery and sorrow and abandonment, but just how much longer can he go with always expecting the worst possible outcome to come to life?
“Let’s get you warmed up and to a medic,” Steve says, and it’s not loud, but it’s gentle and mostly just spoken directly to
Just because something ends, doesn't mean it can't start again. A rather rousing speech from the kid. Get their spirits in check.

He wants to go in—he could—except he feels like it'd be a breach of privacy in some manner. Steve would say he should
He blinks through the fog of whatever the hell that’d been, clears his throat and smiles. “Hey, hoped to catch you. Was afraid I’d have come by too late, but clearly not. Anyway, you want a breakfast taco?” Tony lifts up the paper bag he’s got. “Don’t tell me no. You’re running on an empty stomach, and at this point, I think you might’ve already run three laps anyway.”
With the way the tower has now been turned into an Avengers hub, everybody filters in and out as they please, and they always come together when the alarm goes off. He hands them all an Avengers ID card, which grants them access to essentially every facility and their fully-customized bedrooms. Tony keeps his lab on lock, though, because he’s not the type of guy who wants
on him. The numbness stings, but it eventually fades and he rounds the corner, leans his thigh against the end of the infirmary bed. “You alright?”
Then he has to handle everybody else. Everybody else as in all the original members of the team and some new additions.
Steve drops his head back down and pushes himself off the edge of the bed. “You're… Tony Stark. Like… you know…”
