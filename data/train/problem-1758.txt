Bang. Bang. Bang.
John sighed, looking down at the note sadly. "I don't think he's going to come. You heard what he said. Weddings aren't really his area."
John snorted. “Well that’s just great to hear. You just didn’t want to go to… dinner with me?”
“John. Would you marry me?”
After a few moments, Lucky snapped back to attention and grinned widely. "I know you're probably mad right now, but it will totally be worth it when you see who I have found." She quickly pulled Sherlock in front of her as a shield, grinning like the half-Irish mad woman she was.
"Yes. There have been some last minute complications, so I am running quite a bit late. I can't just-"
John slumped back in his seat. "You’re not really getting the hang of this game, are you, Sherlock?"
"Not at the moment. No."
John grinned, blushing and pressing another soft kiss to Sherlock's mouth. "I love you too Sherlock." He licked his lips before kissing the detective again. "I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you."
"What kind of favor?"
John laughed in delight, causing Sherlock to melt. "Nope!"
Sherlock took a deep breath one last time before unlocking the bathroom door and creeping back into his room, grabbing all of the clothing off the floor and swiping a clean suit from his closet. Slipping into the living room, he gathered all of John's clothes and brought them to the bathroom, dumping them unceremoniously onto the floor. He took a quick shower to both get clean and plant evidence, using John's shampoo to leave a faint smell of it in the bathroom. He dried off a little with a towel, leaving puddles on the floor before carefully walking out of the bathroom and into his room, being careful to leave wet footprints all the way to the bed where he dropped the towel, stepping carefully backwards in the exact spaces until he reached the bathroom again. His feet weren't the same size as John's, but it would have to stay that way as he pulled on clean clothes and quietly rushed into the living room again to erase any evidence of his being there while carrying the suit he wore the night before over his shoulder. He carefully removed slips of paper from the floor to return them to their box, taking the ones that they had used and slipping them into his pocket. Sherlock grabbed the almost empty glass of whiskey that rested on the floor by his chair, dumping it down the drain and cleaning the cup before replacing it in the cupboard exactly where it came from. He looked around the flat for signs that anything happened before pulling out a sheet of paper and a pen, needing to cover his tracks, so he wrote John a note. Sherlock looked at the clock quickly to see that it was almost 3:30. He couldn't do anything about the evidence on the bed without waking John up, but he could only hope John assumed something that wouldn't include Sherlock.
"FUCKING." Neck.
John just grinned. “Who told you that I ever wanted to be safe?”
John frowned. "Who ever said that I was going to jump from anywhere?"
“What are you talking about?”
John groaned, the bloody face of Sherlock Holmes blurring and swaying, barely being registered as the watery voice making its way through the ringing in his ears. “Who’s up here? Did you see anyone?”
“John, I can hear your blatant jealousy from here and I don’t understand why you are so upset about me dating Janine.”
"Of course Sammy. We can go see Mommy right after we're done."
"Well, I might do just that." She kissed his lips lightly, wrapping her fingers into Sherlock's hand. "Maybe I want everyone to know I'm dating the cleverest on Earth." Sherlock smiled lightly into her mouth before she turned her head away from him to look at John. "Oh, don't tell Mary, it's supposed to be a surprise, but I'm sure we could have you over for dinner real soon."
Sherlock leaned back, sighing. "I don’t know who you are. I don’t know who you’re supposed to be."
“I own half of Aisa.”
Sherlock couldn’t think right. Freak. John had called him a
He ran towards the voice screaming for him. "Dad! Dad!"
"About a day before I… came back." Sherlock sighed, turning back around, tying the jumper around his waist to block John's view. "Now if you don't mind, would you look away?"
mean?”
Mary smiled up at him softly. "You will be there, Sherlock?"
She shook her head lightly, obviously having a hard time processing the information. "I don't know what to tell you. He's just a man you barely know and- you said he didn't know about the pregnancy? How did you find out?"
John smiled to himself, putting a secretive finger to his lips. "I'm not telling you quite yet." He opened the door for Sherlock to reveal a taxi waiting outside.
"I know you're gay. Don't lie to me."
Putting down the pen, Sherlock read his note once before placing it delicately on John's chair to stand alone in the middle of the silent flat. He moved back to his own room, looking over the sleeping form of his friend and pressed a feather-light kiss to John's temple, having placed all of the evidence he could and finally preparing to leave. Sherlock walked through the flat, grabbing his violin, and padded silently down the stairs and out the door to cast one last look up at 221B Baker Street. "Goodbye John Watson."
John could hear the upset tone of voice when Lestrade next spoke. "Listen John, this isn't funny. We all care about you deeply and we would really miss you if you were gone. Molly's almost there so hang on a little bit longer, just don't do it. Please John, don't jump."
Sherlock scowled before standing up and clutching his violin case to his side firmly so she didn't steal it. "Eloise Charlotte Barnes, I have no time for your ironically uncharacteristic homophobic jabs and I do believe we have a deal."
"I want Mommy."
Sherlock nodded. “I have to do this. It’s what I want to do.”
Lestrade grinned, raising his glass in a toast. "Well, I can’t wait." John, who had just put his jacket on, smiled round at him. Sherlock stood up and walked across towards the far window, putting down the glass he just poured, his stomach clenching painfully.
Nobody thought that there was any danger.
Sherlock let out a shaking gasp when he felt John's mouth touch his painful erection, the feeling having surprised him while sending heat through his body, shocking him into momentary sobriety. His face turned red and his eyes widened when he heard the moans passing his own lips, clapping a hand over his mouth in an attempt to stifle the noises, but failing when John sank his head down and Sherlock let out a cry of pure bliss. He grasped desperately at the sheets of his bed, letting out whimpers every time John bobbed his head or moved his tongue. Sherlock felt his whole body tense up and whispered John's name a few times, half terrified, half drowned in euphoria and alcohol, completely at John's mercy. He was about ready to collapse when John stopped, Sherlock looking down to see him hovering a few inches away from where he previously was, a confused look on his face.
He approached her with a grin as she stood up, holding out her arms. "Sherlock! Thank you again for allowing us all over." She gave him a quick peck on the cheek as he embraced her gently. "Mrs. Hudson and I were just discussing how to announce the engagement between John and I to the press. After news got around that you came back and John was immediately engaged, your wedding became the topic of papers all over the world."
"Yep."
“Get out of my flat Doctor Watson.”
John grinned at her with love. "Yeah." Sherlock smiled at Mary kindly, catching her eye quickly.
Sherlock nodded. "Just a little bit."
John chuckled briefly, shaking his head. "Sherlock, just last month I caught you in your pants dancing in the kitchen to Mozart with a biscuit in your mouth and looking at a biology test filled out in bright pink glitter pen. There's nothing I haven't seen. Besides, if I have to go out there so do you."
“Then maybe stop being one all the time!” John stomped forward towards Sherlock angrily.
Fontaine was breathing heavily, sobbing. "I had to. I didn't kn-know what else to d-do." His lip trembled as his hands clawed at Sherlock's suit desperately. Sherlock pressed a hand firmly to Fontaine's stomach where blood was leaking out, his eyes wide as tears splashed onto his hand. "Please. Dad. I don't wan- I don't wanna die. Please. Please."
"Sherlock?" John's gaze flickered over towards Mary hopefully.
Sherlock nodded softly, not moving his arms away from his head, but he pulled at his hair less. "We got drunk. Very, very drunk. It was… after the stag night with John. There was this… woman."
"I don't think anyone would want to. He just did what all of us were silently wishing would happen." Gregory.
“I made a horrible mistake during your stag night.”
Sherlock sat back to think, taking a sip from his drink. "Your go."
Sherlock raised his head again, squinting at John like an old man and leaning forward in his seat. "No, you’re not a vegetable."
"There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. I would kill a man if it would make you smile."
Molly waved brightly as she pulled at her scarf. "Hello, everyone."
Sirens.
There were running bodies. Falling tables. Spilling candles. Burning flowers. Sherlock was panicking, searching.
Sherlock glared. Why didn't John trust him anymore? Snatching the box away, he held it close to his chest. "No. It's the letters that remind me why I'm not overdosing right now in a cheap hotel room and leaving my empty husk for Mycroft to find in a dumpster." He hadn't meant to say that and immediately wished he had kept the little truth to himself when John's face turned pale. "I… didn't mean to say that… I… I'll… I'm going to go take a shower." Placing the box carefully onto his desk, Sherlock stepped away, throwing a glance over his shoulder as John stared at the floor, chillingly still. “Don’t go into my room.”
Sherlock walked into the room quickly, trying to close the door before John could get in, but he slipped in right before the door slammed shut. John noticed that the second they were shut in the room together, Sherlock became stiff, tensing up and shuffling a few inches away. "What's wrong?"
John nodded. "With a man, right?"
Sherlock smiled at John sadly. "There's no such thing as heroes. Even if there was, I wouldn't be one. Not me John." He knew that he would never be a hero because heroes save people, but he would only ever be willing to save one person.
Janine giggled, pushing Sherlock's head away and making herself more comfortable on his lap. "Behave Sherl! I still need to know where you've been for the last few days."
Sherlock sighed in relief. "If you could put them somewhere near Molly or Mrs. Hudson it would be great. Thank you John. I have to go. I'll see you in a bit, I'm pulling in right now."
Everyone expected the day to be perfect, and it was. The ceremony was perfect. The pictures were beautiful. Nothing was spilt. No toddlers were poisoned from eating flowers. Nothing ripped. Nobody tripped. There were no broken high heels. No popping buttons. No falling candles. No breaking glass. No seat confusion. Mary was radiant. John couldn't see how anything could possibly go wrong.
She immediately stopped, looking up at him with worried eyes. "Where?"
Sherlock let his head fall back. Waiting.
John stared with wide eyes and breathed heavily as Sherlock licked his fingers slowly, letting his mouth fall open with clear want when Sherlock reached down between their bodies again. Sherlock picked up at the pace he left at, causing John to moan and throw his head back, gasping and mumbling incoherent sentences, but clearly begging for something. Begging for more. Begging for Sherlock. He could do nothing but oblige when he heard John gasp his name, pleading and grabbing his arms desperately panting. "Sherlock! Oh god- oh fuck. Please. Oh god please!"
Bang.
Sherlock looked at his glass as if it had all the answers and lied to him. "Don’t we?"
Sherlock trapped John's mouth with his own again, rocking his hips in rhythm with his hand and felt John tense up, shaking and gasping. With a choked sob, he let go, releasing all over Sherlock's hand and collapsing to the bed. Sherlock kept moving against John until his own orgasm was inevitable, shuddering with pleasure as heat rushed through his body so furiously that spots danced before his eyes and his back arched painfully. His head was spinning as he choked out a repetitive string of "John" when he moaned from the pleasure, collapsing onto the bed.
She rubbed his back and held him tight in the arms of a mother. “Love never makes sense. It’s supposed to be wild and reckless, throwing yourself completely into the arms of someone else and hoping that they don’t break your heart.”

Sherlock patted her back lightly. "If it makes you feel better about slapping him, he was cheating on you with three different men." John shot him a 'shut the hell up' look and Sherlock grimaced. "Not good?"
Sherlock nodded quickly, looking up and down the alleyway before sliding out of his corner. "You should know me better than that. I always take care of myself." Silently walking away from her, Sherlock stepped over druggies sleeping on mattress and drunk men slouched against the brick walls of the narrow alley until he got back onto a main street twenty minutes later. He took the long way to avoid cameras, not willing to risk calling a cab, and made his way slowly over to the flat owned by Molly Hooper, the last piece of his puzzle. Talking to Molly wasn't necessary, but there was one question she could answer to ease his mind and any truth, even the bad kind, was better than an unanswerable question weighing unnecessarily in thoughts.
Bang.
John nodded, looking more confused than ever. "And Quiescent?"
Sherlock played the song slowly until hearing a door open behind him, causing him to stop and put down the violin. "Hello John."
Molly froze, the very air in the room feeling a few degrees colder. She slowly took a few steps forward towards the chair, the seconds it took feeling like hours. "What happened to you?"
After what seemed like a lifetime, Sherlock dropped the knife, looking down at a mess of blood and bone chips, completely numb. He sat still as pain caught up to him because of the fading adrenaline, limply falling over off the mangled corpse.
Sherlock glared at her, drawing himself up. "That is none of your business. Part of the deal was no questions."
"YOU." Nose.
His eyes close reluctantly, shutting heavy with exhaustion.
Sending John running to tackle him. Causing Sherlock to sprint after him into the running crowd immediately.
Sherlock winced. "Of course I know who did it."

John looked down at his feet, taking a deep breath to steady himself as the light breeze pushed at his back, rustling his hair softly, small pin pricks of water landing sharp on his cheeks. He looked through the darkness for anyone around as he searched the street far below him and bit his lip softly as he examined the soft yellow lights illuminating the road through the gentle misting of rain, eventually satisfied when he didn't find anyone out this late at night to witness his fall. John shuffled closer to the edge of the hospital, his bare toes hanging off of the edge and dangling stories above merciless concrete that was soon to meet him. He rubbed his arms as a wet chill threatened to seep into his bones and he swallowed stiffly, scared out of his mind. John's head was a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions as he closed his eyes against the sharp smelling rain and terrifying prospect of death, building up his last thoughts. It was a horrifying thing, death, but despite shaking in terror at the thought of never waking up, John wanted the pain of hitting the sidewalk and freedom of letting himself slip from his burdening body more than anything in the world. Everything in the past month had been numb, dull, pointless. He hadn't gotten out of his bed for two weeks after Sherlock, but even after that, he had just ended up curled up in his best friend's chair the whole day until he could move back to his bed. Now, John just wanted to join the man he cared about the most in the world, so his eyes snapped open and he took a deep breath, leaning forward to let himself fall.
The peony has become a major cultural tradition in some countries, while most people consider it unlucky or a sign of
Mary laughed, patting the lace on her white dress. "I'm sure that it's fine just this once if we break the rules a bit." She looked around at the empty room, face immediately falling. "He isn't here? I thought he agreed to be the best man."
Sherlock shrugged, his back facing John as he buttoned his dress shirt, standing in his underwear. "It has been three years three months three days. Exactly."
Sherlock tried again to straighten himself up on the chair as he grinned. "Yes."
Sherlock shrugged again, pulling at his sleeves nervously in a way that John felt was rather strange, but left it alone to fix the tie. "Well, whenever I tell people, they treat me as if I don't know what I'm doing. I would rather be treated as an asshole with no emotions than a child unable to be trusted with a pair of scissors. And… I didn't want you to know because you were the only one who never believed that I was a fr-" Sherlock's mouth froze up a bit, unable to properly form the word he was trying to say.
John nodded. "Yeah. It was." He paused for a moment. "We need two more seats next to Mrs. Hudson, one with a toddler seat on it."
Sherlock heard a quiet choke of shock from John's side of the room before he smiled blindingly at Janine. "Now don't you go letting on Mångata. We can't let everyone know." He brushed his thumb lightly over her cheek, staring into her eyes.
"I kissed you and liked it."
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.
friend, and leaned forward. "Am I allowed one last question?" He leaned closer, heart thudding behind his ribs in suspense, brain flooding with heat and want. It was thrilling to watch every centimeter that John moved closer, both of them leaning towards each other until there was only a little bit of space between them.
Both of them noticed the lack of ring on her finger as she breathed heavily, tears in her eyes. She looked up at Sherlock sadly as the door closed behind her. "You're a complete ass." She paused a moment, looking down at the ground before slowly leaning into Sherlock's chest, shaking. Sherlock gingerly wrapped his arms around her, rubbing her back comfortingly as she let out a few hiccuping sobs before taking a deep breath to calm herself. "Thank you. I almost married a gay man."

Molly groaned. "Great. Just
Sherlock paused before taking another step to see if John was actually listening. “I’m dating Mary’s best friend.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, standing a bit straighter. "I have to change."
"Yes. I know. I know."
John paused for a few moments, looking into Sherlock's bright eyes again. "Am I… pretty?" He pointed up to the paper stuck to his head. "This."
John nodded, forcing a smile. "Of course! You shouldn't be here though. It's bad luck."
John bit his lip. "Well, he is-"
Two weeks later, outside the door to 221B, reporters and photographers milled around on the road, waiting for Sherlock to tell them their story. Sherlock was on the phone, talking to Mycroft in his room while slipping into a shirt. "Mycroft, you were the one who offered them the tickets. It is only fitting that you are the one to take them."
"Something's not supposed to…?"
John smiled. "Go on, then."
John chuckled softly, drifting slowly into sleep. "We are? That's nice."
Sherlock flailed a hand towards another part of the room. "Ah, but I picked it at random from the papers."
She looked up from where she was sitting on the couch. "Yes Sherlock?"
Sherlock let his smile fade out a bit and stepped closer to the doctor, only a few inches separating them. “It means that I almost came back. So many times. I came back to London to tell you, but I couldn’t. Not until you were safe. Not until I could make it so that Moriarty couldn’t hurt you.”
“Police!” he yells, flashing the badge he stole from Lestrade a week before. “Open her up!”
“John, concentrate!”
Jim chuckles and pulls at the hair, puts it in his mouth and suckles.
“Why not?”
“You started it,” John growls.
Sherlock lifts his hands against the steady bark.
Broken syllables streaming from John while they wait for the paramedics wash the phone clear out of Sherlock’s mind.
No need for that really. Sally Donovan comes in, hands Sherlock a phone and another stolen voice on the other end informs him that they’re on the right track.
“They all care so much,” Sherlock says, almost disgustedly. “Do you ever wonder if there is something wrong with us?”
“I guess they were making up for my father.”
They both exhale at the same time.
He looked down at the mattress.
“Mrs Hudson has been an angel. She knows we can’t really afford the rent anymore, so she lowers it just the right amount every month or forgets about it altogether.”
“You look sad. When you think he can’t see you.”
And since Sherlock now has no business being in or outside the courthouse, John sits through the rest of the trial and brings back news of the proceedings.
The people gathered around the buffet smirk and giggle, eager for a show. Sherlock calmly pours out two glasses of champagne, before even glancing at Donovan’s bleary eyes that seem to have a difficult time concentrating on him.
“God, I hope so!” John growls into the pillow.
John’s expression has not changed.
He would give so very much if he could just pass out right now, sleep for 14 hours and pretend none of what is going to happen ever happened.
John shows him a blue and white ball of mush that used to be his note and over which he poured boiling water in the hopes of having Earl Grey with his breakfast. Not Uniball Eye UB157.
John chuckles and beams at him.
“Nice touch, this,” John continues. Sherlock knows he can’t help it and yet he almost screams at him to stop. “The pool where little Carl died. I stopped him. I can stop John Watson, too.”
He squeezes John’s fingers (John snuffles against his neck softly and squeezes back reflexively), gets up and pats into the kitchen without bothering to put on his dressing gown. He fills the kettle with water and rummages around in the fridge that Mycroft has stacked full of necessities the day before.
She takes him into the rich Belgravia, to a white house with marble columns by the front doors. He wonders if her pimp keeps a decent house or whether it’s just a show for the outsiders.
John loved the forest. He would disappear into it and appear again from a different part, making his own paths through the undergrowth. He came back and told Sherlock off for smoking again, went to one of the cupboards and took out a tin box, explaining he had found mouse droppings in a corner in the kitchen and hid the sugar in the box.
After two officers had driven him home, another one had arrived almost immediately and driven him back to Diogenes Club. Certain that he was to be dismissed, that someone more suitable had been found, he had stepped in Mr Holmes’s office with more determination than before, ready to defend his position in the operation.
“Rye bread traditionally does not have any seeds on it.”
And down they went.
Sherlock huffs, annoyed by the idiocy of the people who have found their way into his television.
“It is a high time you listened to reason. We would not be doing this if you really didn’t need help. These…
“And in all those minutes you have not once said a bad word against John.”
The speechlessness and the way John is fisting his hand tell that something did happen, something new and terrible, something he didn’t have to experience even in the war, and Sherlock wants nothing more than to shake the answers out of John.
Irene’s fingers brush over a bitemark on his shoulder and he shivers.
“Scratch my back,” he repeats sitting down by John’s chair. His attempt to lean against John’s legs is stopped by a foot that presses hard against his shoulder blades.
He sweeps past Sherlock in a slide of patent leather shoes and a whiff of a shiny new briefcase. He is at the door when a breathless voice says his name.
He really was Mr Holmes’ last hope.
“It is time for my rounds anyway.”
He drained his cup, grimacing at the bitterness of the last cold drops, then whimpered pitifully when the stretch made pain flare in his nose again.
Several people jumped up and hurried out of the door.
“Because of

The dust of the huts rested in his lungs still. He moved his head towards the wind, breathing it in deep. It caught a hold of his hair, pushed it against his scalp and swept through his mind.
He raises an eyebrow.
“Victor Trevor,” the man introduced himself. Sherlock offered him neither his hand nor a generous expression which Mr Trevor did not seem to take too direly.
John stays. Sherlock makes an effort the next day when they meet at the flat on Baker Street by starting to clean up the place the moment John points at the mess. John sits down heavily in the ugly armchair and is instantly at home. Sherlock can breathe a little easier. Looking at John from the corner of his eye, he thinks there can’t be anything too bad seeing this man sitting in the chair reading the paper from now on. He is comfortable, he is cotton, he is vanilla, but he is sturdy and thick-skinned.
Sherlock dives in to his pocket and pulls out his lighter along with a cigarette, lights it and allows the woman to light hers from the hot end.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something had shifted between them last night.
“You looking for a good time?” she replies.
The map enlarges automatically to Westminster, then Marylebone, then to 221 Baker Street. All of a sudden, the loud buzzing has moved inside Sherlock’s head. His phone chimes and while John and Lestrade are concentrated on the map trying to figure out how the phone can be in the building with them he opens a text that has just arrived, stares at the invitation to follow the shadowy man standing on the landing where Mrs Hudson has left him after she had come up to simper something about a taxi.
“There is only one bed,” he informed John, who glanced up, his brows furrowed but not looking too worried.

Parts of the ceiling drop down and John thanks his lucky stars that though abandoned, the warehouse is still in decent condition and doesn’t cave in completely by the force of the explosion. He coughs, looking round for the source, looking for any movement behind the cloud of white.
a toga,” Sherlock growls at John’s smirk. “It is a sheet, I was asleep, and then you woke me up with a case. I am not going to dress for something I don’t even have to leave the flat for. This is a six. We agreed it has to be at least a seven for me to go out.”
, John Watson,” Sherlock introduces quickly before Sebastian has had the chance to even look at the man.
John kisses her forehead and shakes Josh’s hand. Sherlock keeps rocking the sleeping baby-Lucy until she wakes up with a slight squirm, opens her eyes and stares at him with her deep dark eyes.
He didn’t know where he was.
“You are my best friend,” he says. “Now clean up your mess and stop sulking. You’ll get there eventually.”
“Don’t ask questions now, please, John,” Sherlock begs as he pulls out a suitcase from the closet and begins to stuff John’s jeans and underwear in it. He pulls the shirts out from the closet with the hangers still on them, stuffs them into the suitcase as well and goes to the bathroom to get John’s toilet bag. When he returns, John has gathered his wits and is throwing his stuff out of the suitcase.
“This is not a clever crime, Sherlock,” Doctor Mortimer says gently. “This is your life, you cannot catch the illness like a criminal and lock it in jail.”
“Or are you too sentimental? Too
“Doctor Watson!”
He babbles on, bragging about how clever he has been, how easy it has been. At the mention of the victims John shakes his head and Sherlock’s eyes flicker back and forth between him and Moriarty advancing steadily, chirping constantly.
The room fell silent around him. Both brothers stared at him, the younger one looking delighted once again while the elder began to look more and more like he was sure his mission was going to fail and thinking whether it would be too late to find anyone else for the task.
John dropped his gaze. He looked small and ashamed.
Sherlock smiles to himself.
He disappeared fast through the door and Sherlock knew he would never see his liver again. He would have run after John but his lack of eyebrows made him too self-conscious of his appearance and instead he stayed home to set fire to John’s chair.

but which seemed to include more options than it was ever necessary for an everyday shopper to have when they just wanted something flat to smack their jam on top of.
In the end, John doesn’t catch him out but figures all this is one of Sherlock’s ways of making fun of him and tosses the last paper drone in Sherlock’s eye.
insisted on taking one after jumping in to a manhole, and now none of them will take us!”
So he trudges home, takes out John’s medical bag and sitting in the tub sews the wound as best as he can.
Squinting at Irene Adler:
His speech scratched the quiet air. Sherlock pouted.
“Sherlock…” Irene breathes on the other end.
“Shut up!” Sherlock snaps. “I’m not your sniffer dog,” he snarls at Lestrade.
“You promised to marry me.”
He throws himself into John’s arms and cries.
He stomped his boot on Sherlock’s chest. The air escaped his lungs and he groaned in pain. The whip of the gun barrel across his face was like an explosion. Blood gushed from his nose and torn lip and he gasped in a gulping breath of air.
He closes his eyes again. He seems to be having a hard time coming up with stuff.
They have lived together for three months and already there is such easiness on John’s part. Sherlock has to remind himself that John is used to living in army quarters where there is no space for modesty. He has to keep it realistic, has to remember that John is overprotective of his privacy in general.
The giggle.
“Or perhaps,” she edges closer, and without noticing, Sherlock leans in as well, better to hear John described in that voice trained on reciting fantasies, “he sees a side of you the others don’t and it turns you on that you alone can show him what you are truly like?”
Sherlock doesn’t phone again but texts every hour with small messages.
“I actually got to 1895. Then I fell asleep. Guess my powers of concentration aren’t very good,” he chuckles.
After that, there has been no reason to charge the phone.
Later that day, Sherlock learns from his mother that Mycroft is suffering from something called a broken heart. It means that he was in love with a girl who was not in love with him, which made Mycroft very sad. Sherlock asks his mother if he could take Mycroft to a heart doctor. Maybe they could fix his heart like the dentist does when your teeth have cavities. Or take it out, if it’s too broken. He knows dentists can also take teeth out. His grandmama had all of hers taken out and now has false teeth she pops out and back in to entertain him.
Sherlock wanted to make him bleed.
“Then it must be my natural talent for things.”
John ascends the stairs and stops to stare. Then he turns on his heels and is out of the door.
“It’s just a bit hard to concentrate what with the... medication,” Sherlock says, and his hand hovers over his temple. “I try to get as much done in a day as I can, but it makes me feel fuzzy and I can barely sit down for half an hour before I’m all out of ideas.”
Sherlock has been throwing darts.
It made him want to be horrible to him, to smash him to pieces.
“You idiot!” he screams. “You should have known he had a knife!”
), about to leave at the last minute, hasn’t packed, has only told Mrs Hudson, not John. Is irritated.
. John with his shirt sleeves rolled up, elbow-deep in warm water, foam between his fingers, a dishbrush in hand, Sunday afternoon filling the whole flat, the sun always warmer and somehow brighter then than any other time of the day.
“Why?” Sherlock asks, voice suddenly rough.
“Overprotective paramedics,” he muttered at the kettle.
“As we are speaking, our troops are launching a raid on the Nazi occupied French port, St Nazaire. If successful, this raid will ensure that at least part of the coastline will be taken back, which will mean trouble for the Germans. They will have no means of repairing their larger warships there, but will have to send them back. This kind of setback won’t be taken lightly, and more than likely measures will be taken to repair for the losses made, quite possibly by attempting to occupy the British coast.”
“Sherlock,” he whispers, “have you been taking your meds?”
Usually John’s laugh is like cotton candy, soft and sweet, and it still has that edge to it when he tries to hide his embarrassment behind a stern expression but there’s something so very far away in his chuckle.
“Sherlock!”
Mycroft tries to look politely baffled.
“How many bombers do you think that includes?” John asks absently.
He is in London, in Westminster, at the door of another grubby little bedsit, opening the door, and John kisses him, then punches his cheekbones so that he falls to the floor. John kisses him on the cheekbones, then punches him on the jaw. John kisses his jaw, his eyelids, his nose, his ears, and doesn’t punch any of them.
John walked back in a moment later, his wallet in his hands, his eyes cast down to stare at his fingers fidget on the leather surface. He looked up to see Sherlock push one of the tables under the window, the feet scraping horribly on the floor, and begin to unpack and arrange his radio equipment on it, the kitchen table still full of boxes and crates with their food supplies in them.
One of the young men blushes and his friends bellow with laughter.
) after it had been slipped on for the first time and never having seen a clean day since, what with all the running in sewers and dirty alleys and probably being covered in dirt and suspects’ blood more often than was necessary.
He blew into the muzzle. It let out a hollow, humming sound.
“What are you doing?” he asks the clothes flying across the room and hitting the window.
John finds a bowl and a clean towel, fills the first with lukewarm water and places the latter into it to get it soaked. He retrieves the loot to his bedroom where the pile of sickness and dressing gown looks more like a miserable wet dog than a consulting detective.
Sherlock sniffed again and turned around to peer at his radio equipment.
John smacks him on the head with a pillow. Sherlock escapes the next punch, scrambling towards the end of the bed and pulls the blanket from under John, who goes down on his back and is buried under the same blanket as well as everything else that they have on bed, including both their dressing gowns and a forgotten sock. Sherlock snatches the pillow from the fist peeking out from under the bedding and once John is securely tied up, he begins to pound him on the sides with it. John hurls insults at him and attempts to get away from his stuffy prison. Sherlock throws the pillow away and attacks John’s sides with his fingers. The cursing turns into howls of laughter and when Sherlock finally allows John’s head to poke out and the man to draw in a gasp of fresh air, his face is red as a beetroot. Secure in the knowledge that he has won this match, Sherlock releases his hold and attacks John’s face instead.
At first, John did not realise he had spoken. So intense was his stare that he had been enraptured by it, unable to move or register anything but the burning globes in front of him. And the voice was so deep and velvety, John could not believe a human being had produced it.
After a moment of silence, Jim stops his snuffling and moves up to balance on his elbow to give Sherlock space.
“Rifles?”
Sherlock stands in front of him, naked and shivering, surrounded by clumps of dark black hair. His head looks smaller now, his skull delicate under the mere inch of hair, and John takes a step towards him tocheck for possible damage on the scalp. Few older scars and nothing more. Sherlock’s brain is still protected by unbroken skull, and John lowers his hand gently on the back of it.
His phone is ringing when he makes his way back upstairs.
“I told you,” Sherlock croaks, “I need to lift my feet up ---“
Little by little, they form habits and work out how to live with and round each other. Sherlock learns John’s schedule which has stayed the same since his army days and is the reason why he still wakes up on an ungodly hour every single morning (even though he doesn’t have a job to go to) and trots downstairs, grumpy and in need of tea.
He’s in a foul mood rest of the day.
John lets him sleep in his room after they get home from the pool in the small hours of the morning. For the first time John declines Sherlock’s offer to call Lestrade or Mycroft or both to come and collect them as well as the lack of evidence Moriarty’s men have left behind. Sherlock texts Mycroft the details fast and discretely while they are walking home, eyes glued to the tense muscles in John’s neck. Lestrade will be furious they have left, but Sherlock can deal with him later.
Sherlock shook his head.
“There’s only 42 jars, not a million. And I need them for an experiment. The nuts are on the upper shelf.”
“Allergies?”
“I never replied!” Sherlock yells. “I didn’t tell you, because it has nothing to do with the case! He gave no clues as to who he is and where he was, so what does it matter?”
Sherlock's chest heaved painfully as he struggled to breathe properly, collapsing next to John in exhaustion. He let his lips tilt softly into a small smile directed towards the man next to him who was grinning wildly, out of breath and thrilled about it. John's eyes were soft, his pupils wide, but still there was such a beautiful blue shining through that he seemed to be staring right through Sherlock and into the brain that he thought was remarkable. John propped himself up on his elbows and leaned over Sherlock's chest, kissing his lips lightly and slipping in just a little tongue before pressing their foreheads together gently, both of them grinning and drunker than they thought would be possible without passing out. Sherlock was dizzy with delight, nearly delirious as he looked into John's captivating eyes, his own becoming heavy with satisfaction. He shifted a little, moving his arm up to his chest to hold John's hand that was resting there lightly, his fingers running over a gold band. Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind and his smile dropped. "John?"
“What should I do?” he asks John.
John comes home eight hours later and the moment he walks through the door, he knows something is wrong.
A photographer jumps out from the crowd.
“I’m so sorry to get you mixed up in this,” he says to her. “I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry.”
There is no ring on John’s finger. The shoes in the corner look brand new, but they are just well-kept, used with care. So John does not go out or buy new clothes often. His clothes scream the same, his old jacket on the hook of the door.
. The sitting room is filled with policemen and Lestrade, who sits in Sherlock’s chair like it’s a throne.
, but Sherlock just continued his story on how he had accidentally fallen into a well and how Mycroft had practically bungee jumped in to rescue him, always the protective big brother.
“Others have seen him. They were at our wedding!” Sherlock cries out.
He thinks about the smile on Sherlock’s face when he first saw him together with John. Sherlock was positively glowing and he had his presumptions even back then. But couldn’t believe it of Sherlock, not his Sherlock.
Sherlock scowls and turns to Lestrade with a pleading expression but the photographer drags him away from the Detective Inspector and John standing giggling next to him.
When the vest is safely away from them both, Sherlock is ready to break down and cry against John’s chest. Instead he runs after Moriarty, not to catch him, he knows that’s useless, but to gather himself, lean his head against the nearest wall and count to ten.
, the despicable word that it is, should not be associated with him, should not be in the same sentence with his name. But there it is. Verbatim to what he himself said to John at the graveyard.
He never texts. He wants to hear John's voice.
He has tried to mop up the mess with the handkerchief in his pocket before realising what he is doing. Offering the sodding mess back to its owner, John had just chuckled and asked him to keep it, to bring good luck. So the handkerchief is back in his pocket, as wet and dripping as his hair.
Mycroft sighs and starts to gather his papers together.
Under the crow’s watchful eyes, they disappeared among the trees.
And it has suddenly gotten very dark indeed.
him again. The desperation is gone, replaced by insistence and need but he is still as gentle as before and pushes against John with the caution of a lover. But what really makes John feel like he is going to break from the gentleness of it is that now the constant repetition of his name is surrounded by endearments muttered into his bad shoulder.
His face is the same as on a good crime scene, but his eyes tell John that he knows this is not a game and he won’t treat it as such.
“They have it here,” Sherlock stammered.
“You do not say his name, you do not think about him. And you do not think for a moment that you could be half the man he was. You can keep your feelings and your condolences. You are
“You are too hard on yourself, Sherlock.”
Jim finds him from the library three days later, sitting on a window sill with the panes scribbled full of his spidery handwriting.
Sherlock looks up, sees John and grows worried. Then he must realise it is a smile and not a frown on John’s lips and he gathers his notebook and magnifying glass one of the constables has been twiddling, says goodbye and starts down the path towards John, stretching his gangly legs as he goes to shake off the prickling feeling of having crouched down for so long.
“We have to get you away,” Sherlock hisses, dumps the small bag into the suitcase and begins to collect the trousers and shirts lying on the floor.
His eyes skimmed over the holster before rising to John’s face.
On a morning, Mycroft phones with a case. In order to avoid his brother, Sherlock decides it is best to run out of the flat as fast as possible and hide at the Yard until Mycroft gets the message.
From the corner of his eye, Sherlock followed Mr Trevor’s easy retreat back to the sitting room. He did not turn to look behind himself but once he had turned round the corner, his fingers lingered on the wooden frame of the door, as if they would on a lover’s wrist.
“Because it said so in the book you gave me.”
This surprised John even further.
“He killed again,” Lestrade tells him. “Right in front of our faces. Blew up a nursery. Everything in shambles, blood all over the place. It’s going to be in the evening news.”
She looks terrified.
Policeman, mail man, Jehovah’s Witness. He feels like a child in a costume shop choosing an outfit for Halloween.
common to invite one’s girlfriends over to meet your flatmate. So bugger off, Sherlock. I’m having a pint with Miranda and then we are going to go see a nice movie, all without you.”
What had John said? About a tree? No, a rock?
But he must never know.
She doesn’t look irritated or disappointed, only neutral and calm as she pushes him against the bed, his legs dangling over the edge, and climbs to sit astride over his hips. Her hand goes to the pocket of her dressing gown and draws out a square tin wrap.
“Terrified. Mortified. Petrified. Stupefied by you,” he mocks, sitting down opposite Victor and picking his phone from his pocket. “Better text John that I’ll be late or I’m in big trouble.”
in here with you pestering me constantly!”
“John,” he purred, “we’re out of condoms.”
He turned around and walked inside. Sherlock heard him set his mug in the sink and begin to rummage around in the cupboards.
Something sad flashed over Mr Trevor’s eyes, but he smiled kindly.
“John?”
“Sherlock,” John steps closer to him.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the great Sherlock Holmes!”
“Oh, I’d love to, but I don’t know the code,” Sherlock says, slowly raising his hands over his head.
John stopped.
John catches the clippers before Sherlock plucks out an eye and stands still, waiting for more instructions. He stares at Sherlock’s hands, grasping at the sides of the sink with his knuckles white, the rest of him swaying from side to side again.
“Morning, Sherlock,” Doctor Mortimer calls from a distance.
The case finished, he goes directly to the fridge and if there is any rice left over he will eat it from the pot. Cold. With his fingers. As was the case with the yoghurt, John goes through stages of emotions and settles with endearment this time. He is only glad to see Sherlock eat.
Sherlock follows Anderson’s brisk trot towards the men’s, hoping again to see Jim emerge. But no one exists when Anderson bangs the door against the wall.
The silence was broken by a knock on the door, followed by the entrance of Mycroft’s personal secretary who, without further ado, gave him a very perfunctory thumbs up. Mycroft nodded and the secretary exited the room.
“Shh!”
Sherlock snaps his head up, ready to retort something clever, decides against it and tries to get up to go. Victor’s finger on the pawn Sherlock last used to eat one of Jim’s rooks stops him.
“That’s okay,” John sniffs.
“Not again!” John throws his hands in the air.
“Yeesh. Mummy had alcohol. I took so many.”
A hand shoots out from under the covers and clutches him painfully.
He leaned down to sniff the jacket Sherlock had intended to use as his pillow.
One of Sherlock's earliest memories is of John Watson in dungarees, tottering across the playground towards him, eyes set in determination.
“Sherlock, love, what is it?” he rubs his eyes against the bright lights of the loo.
“We could try,” the woman says. “Do you remember my name?”
“To be fair,” he says, “the food was rather limited. I don’t know about you, but I much prefer a greasy take-away over caviar any day.”
“He smells of almonds. It’s his hand cream,” Sherlock continues.
“Okay, then.”
it here. I am not qualified for anything. I know everything there is to know about chemistry and physics and criminology but without a degree I am nothing. So I’m stuck. I have to go through meaningless lectures and get credits for years before I can graduate. Because I don’t know what I want to do.”
At dawn, with the last traces of the narcotic only making him spasm and squirm every once in a while, he feels a hand on his forehead and scrabbles for it desperately.
“So you are blaming this all on me?” Mycroft asks.
“I found wolf tracks,” John said, hanging his riffle up on the wall, ruffling his hair which lay sweaty over his forehead. “Nothing to worry about unless you have chickens or perhaps small children. And since we have neither and are both rational adults, we know how to stay alive with one canine companion.”
“You want that cuppa now?”
“Oh, God, she’s looking at Holmes!” Wilkes whines.
He had been so scared of the forest in those lonely summers at his grandmother’s place in France. The forest that began from the back door of the house, like a gaping mouth. At night he would shiver in his bed, torch in hand, listening to the forest etching closer, the branches of the trees covering his window, swallowing him into the darkness.
But it ends with John smiling across the room, looking at him and only at him. It ends with John laid bare in Sherlock’s bed, all the joy, all the pain, all the scars, all the perfections showing.
, and without you in it, Bletchley Park will still be standing when the war is over.”
“Phone him, explain the situation - “
He takes the ashtray he stole from Buckingham Palace and throws it at the opposite wall. It collides with the bookshelf and breaks neatly in two. A few books, unbalanced on top of the others as they are, drop to the floor where Sherlock pounces at them and starts tearing pages off of them. He claws at the Penguin classic and gets it to pieces in no time, but the hardcover copy of
Sherlock stares at the item John is pushing at him.
“Perhaps you should shut up,” John blushes, hoping Sherlock won’t decide to steal the plate of biscuits he had planned to enjoy with his tea. They are the last of the box, they are his favourite, and Sherlock
“Should have known it’s just a game for you. Just a bit of fun.”
“Shoot!” he bellows.
“Remember what you promised when you were eight?”
“You always get the best bits of her,” John says and kisses him on the mouth.
The nightmares he had witnessed in the previous months were nothing compared to this. Before, Sherlock might have woken up to a silent sob or a creak of the bed boards as John got up to drink a glass of water or open the door to stand a moment in the cool breeze of the night air.
“Don’t get excited. It was the cheapest one on the menu. I can’t believe how some people can afford to spend so much on books, no matter how old.”
“Sir?” the boy stutters.
The worst comes when he deduces Molly’s gift, just for laughs. He knows it has to be for someone special, and isn’t that what you are supposed to do, tease your friends for having a crush? He only hears the sting of his words when they die in his throat as he reads the card on the box.
“Shut up. I don’t even own a scarf.”
is an entirely wrong expression when they both know why Mycroft has let the most insane man on the planet walk free from the torture cell he locked him in two weeks earlier.
Being a smart man, he chose the first.
Only the instinctual sensation one gets in the back of their head when they know for certain they are not alone saved him from the blast of the rifle. He dived down to the moss, the bark flying from the tree raining over the spot he had stood in. But he was already crawling away.
Sherlock shook his head. The coffee helped. The comforting smell of it allowed him to pretend that nothing was amiss with the world. He was one again the cold-hearted thinking machine Mycroft said he was, unaffected by emotions and desires unlike other people.
So it’s still about the dos and do nots of gift-giving.
John (who has now crammed himself under the sink to see if he can fix the pipes after Sherlock has drained the latest experiment which in no case should have been thrown down there to torment the old pipes, asks for the screwdriver and Sherlock hands it to him, brain still jammed in the past when John’s feet sticking out from the cupboard weren’t part of his Sunday morning) sparked something inside him the moment he stepped in. He can’t remember feeling that kind of
“I gave you my number.”
He would go with the strawberry. He always did.
After the pot of mostly chamomile and a piece of toast partly shoved down his throat, Sherlock is snoring like a steam engine and drooling into John’s pillow.
“What?”
He fills the gun, puts it in the pocket of his dressing gown and goes back into the sitting room to wait.
“Then why did you agree to help? What possible reason could you have to continue supporting it?”
The question is not unexpected and Sherlock has had time to form his answer. Glancing over his shoulder at Jim, Irene and Harriet walking slowly some distance away, he says truthfully,
Mycroft crosses his hands on the table.
He imagines himself next to John in the bed, his limbs sticking out from under the duvet, his frame lean and sinewy like a sighthound.
Mycroft Holmes turned towards him and, not minding his brother, continued to explain,
“I’ll take it.”
“We’ll just leave them outside to air.”
“I’m just looking for them, I bought a bag and I know I put it in the cupboard,” John informs him.
“Sherlock. I’m sorry about him. About Vic---”
“You got me a book?”
Sherlock fiddled with his radio, pretending not to hear.
“Element of surprise. The code they have been using is something no one has been able to break before. We are one step ahead them.”
John looks at the notebook again and touches his finger on the leather gently. He picks the book up and leafs through it, presses it to his nose and says shyly,
John walks heavily up the stairs as Sherlock is reading an email from his old acquaintance from university, now an executive in a posh bank and suddenly in need of a detective. Sherlock glances towards the kitchen when John, reassuring him that he can manage, bangs his hip against the door frame and lowers the grocery bags on the table with a grunt.
Somehow, this mutual feeling of being uninvited to this place did not make John feel closer to the man.
Sherlock, not hearing or not listening, takes another sip while reading the file over John’s shoulder and almost spits out the tea this time.
His posture doesn’t look stiff, like he will run away from the first rash move, so Sherlock dares a look at his face.
He must have fallen asleep, for the dawn was beginning to colour the horizon, painting the sky in gold and pink. He stretched as best as he could, glancing at the two sitting next to him. The sergeant driving the car looked quite peaked, his eyes bleary and bloodshot, his posture a shadow of his usual military stance.
Back door.
Uncomfortable silence. John has to get used to those with Sherlock.
“When he was dying he was always cheerful, he was lovely, except when he thought no one could see. I saw him once. He looked sad.”
Sherlock hopes it will not come to that. John crouching over him while his brains leak out, or his blood bubble out of his intestines, or every bone in his body broken, or his hair wet from the Thames water and skin covered in seaweed. Or in the worst case scenario, everything all at once.
“Just staring at me. Like I was a freak.”
“Irene, please go.”
“I was afraid of wolves as a child.”
Molly’s voice disturbs him.
“What would your mum do?”
“But that’s not used for schizophrenia!” John gasps.
“But I’ve already got you a present. You’re gonna like it, I know you will!”
The trial is a farce. Obviously Moriarty has scared the jury to death before the thing even had the chance to start.
He has reached his one-year mark a mere week earlier, and hopes dearly that John will do the math and figure out how long Sherlock had actually sat on the floor of his flat after he had stormed out before seeking professional and filial help.
He focuses his eyes on the face in front of him.
“Bet you never saw this coming,” John tries to smile a little.
“Well, it wasn’t all too bad.”
She pierces the needle through his skin and presses the piston down.
is shoved in his face, followed by Sherlock's bony bum that falls painfully on his lap and cold hands that slither under his shirt.
“Getting bored already?” John spits out without looking at him.
Moriarty turns to look at him again.
Sherlock stiffened.
“Lestrade,” John clarifies. “You relaxed the minute he stepped in. You practically leaned into him.”
“We have information of a massive scale threat. The messages were decoded by my dear brother here, and their originality cannot be doubted. The threat is real.”
He gives John a last smile to assure him that if anyone could talk Sherlock Holmes off a ledge it would be John Watson. John can’t see it, he’s too far, but Sherlock hopes he feels it, hears it through the phone and remembers it instead of all the horrible things he is saying, has ever said to him.
When Sherlock is not reading John out loud from his book, he teaches him to walk.
“No.”
“Yeah, right. Why don’t you just use your skull then?”
He goes to see Molly before he leaves.
John smacks his arm with the book. He is still looking at it lovingly, when Sherlock goes down on his knees with a rush of cloth and is suddenly very close.
“This has got to be an eight, at least?” John encourages. “A man killed on a marooned field by a single blow to the back of the head from a blunt instrument which then magically disappeared along with the killer.”
“I found the notebook. I called the number,” John says quietly.
He really didn’t. Of course he knew John would by now be interning in one of the many hospitals in London, but for once his fantasy of John in his white lab coat had been just that, a fantasy, not something that could be made real by cashing in a long-standing favour a woman in the university registry owed him and to actually find out where John Watson had directed his interest.
“I could have got them anywhere,” he says and tosses the stick to his left.
Then he turns to look at the three standing behind him. First, he goes to Jim and looks at him for a moment.
She snatches the collar between her teeth just as John walks through the door.
“186.”
John looked up from his breads, horrified that he would actually have to find something like that from the miles and miles of shelf.
He turned to look at the cottage. The lamp on the table was lit, but despite the cold weather no smoke rose from the chimney.
But John is still not awake, only buries his face deeper into his arms, revealing even more of his neck as he turns to the left, like he is inviting Sherlock’s fingers to touch.
), eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
John comes home after a few days, arm in bandages and on a sling. Sherlock sees him through the window. But John doesn’t climb up the stairs the moment he walks in but knocks on Mrs Hudson’s door instead and stays for hours. Sherlock sneaks behind the closed door and presses a glass against it to hear the quiet murmur of voices better. He doesn’t hear his name being mentioned, but Mrs Hudson’s voice is so soft, so understanding that they must be talking about him.
“Our dog.”
Sherlock peeked at the cover (he had to crouch very, very low).
They walk into the warehouse, the doors closing behind them with a loud clang. Several armed men are standing at ease around a magnificent car, its front door hanging open and a large dent on the bonnet.
The phone rings.
“The sun will take care of that,” John consoled him.
“I want a copy of this one,” he says to the camera man, who clearly doesn’t mind at all about the moment going on between this unknown man and the one whose photo will ensure a nice commission for him. He lifts his camera slightly, pondering whether a picture of the man now stroking the handkerchief in place would sell.
But Mycroft doesn’t budge, doesn’t spare any details about his secret missions concerning her futureso Sherlock chases him out of the room with a flawless rendition of ‘God Save the Queen’, which makes John smile.
But John lays a hand gently on his shoulder and stops him. Well, tries to, since he can’t do anything with his other hand, so Sherlock’s right side keeps pushing against his left, trying out for a more lopsided kiss.
At that moment, the cab skidded to a halt by the doorstep of Sherlock’s flat. Cheeks deep red, his mind running amok, Sherlock stumbled out, only to have his coat tails caught in the door handle from where Mr Trevor untangled them, slower than was necessary, his fingers lingering on Sherlock’s wrist as he wished him good night.
When Sherlock woke up, his eyes bleary and his hair tousled, the water in the kettle was already cold.
“But if you were clever, really clever…”
The static muttering on the other end hurts his eardrums, so he moves the phone further away, whispers a goodbye into it and ends the call.
“Data? Proof?”
“Why, Sherlock! I have never seen you eat so much,” Mrs Holmes exclaimed one evening when they were having their supper.
has decided that actions need to be taken in order to prevent certain outcomes this country could certainly live without at this stage of the war.”
When he was little, he thought busses just went round the same route all day, changing the driver in the middle, but otherwise going on, round and round. He loved the city. He wanted to live on a bus so he could look out the window and see the ever-changing landscape while he did his schoolwork.
Sherlock looks down.
The first thought that passes through Sherlock’s brain after the blood returns sends warning lights blaring and plan after plan to flip uselessly inside his skull, only to drop to the bottom.
Jim’s eyes gleam as he explains how the car was started by pulling out the wires and then trying to make the hit and run look like the car just smashed into a wall.
“What kind of people are we then, Sherlock?”
“It was not a suggestion, Sherlock.”
“I think I broke my spine.”
He walks even slower on the tiles, making sure there are no splatters anywhere to make it difficult for him to move fast if needed.
He whips it out without looking at John, who is hovering near him, and offers it over his shoulder. Eyes still glued to the photos on the wall, he barely registers the swift kiss John plants on his cheekbone and is out of the door.
“Don’t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don’t exist and even if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them.”
Doctor Mortimer looks very angry but collected. Mycroft, however, is furious.
Sherlock snatches another of his pieces fast, wanting to have the game over and done with.
She moves closer and touches his hand.
John sighs.
John steps between them and the camera and takes out a white handkerchief from his pocket. He folds it into a square and places it in Sherlock’s breast pocket.
Turning to John to get his opinion on the gruesome puzzle in front of them, Sherlock is stunned to notice John is pulling his jacket tighter over himself, looking round like everyone at the crime scene suddenly has their eyes on him and that he would like to be swallowed by the dirty floor.
“You – want to take the case? After three months of giving me the stern and all in all vulgar answer which in its simplicity goes ‘no’?”
“Sherlock, it’s dripping wet. You’re dripping wet! The scarf is not going to do you any good right now.”
There is a family crying in the hall behind the glass doors.
In the safety of his flat, he slipped out of his dinner clothes, his skin burning so hot he soon stood completely naked in the middle of the cold room. Catching a sight of himself in the mirror, he stopped to inspect his nudity. In his opinion, he was nothing if not skinny, angular, and weirdly shaped. His face was large with a long jaw and sharply cut cheekbones. He hid his face behind his hands and peeked at his body from the slits of his fingers, inspecting one body part at a time, but could not see any improvement. Same imperfections that had made him queer and despised in the eyes of his peers in school were still there. Looking at them individually did nothing to help but merely emphasised each sharp angle more. Frustrated, he turned his back to the mirror and slipped into bed, his skin still so warm he did not bother with any clothing.
But John’s touch feels nothing less than electrifying, blood-boiling, wonderful.
After all, he does know where to look. Away, never at the same time as John, never let John catch him looking, never let him see inside his heart.
The air rushes out of his lungs and he slumps down on the rug.
“Like you’d know. I seem to remember that you barely attended classes in the end and you didn’t even graduate.”
Sherlock appears by John’s shoulder, takes the cup of tea from his hands and takes a sip, then grimaces at the sweetness.
have no idea. It’s like all the data has left my head.”
“I wouldn’t come home, you know. They wouldn’t let me,” he says without looking up.
John turned around slightly so that Sherlock saw his chest, the bullet wound only a small dot on this side, merely a scar to mention except the obvious blotch of an entry wound that had swallowed the bullet neatly.
Sherlock’s brain kicks back in.
“I am very normal,” Sherlock answers.
He moves to the next book, Shakespeare, and it looks like his heart has stopped at the sight.
He makes Mycroft promise not to tell John about her rehabilitation. What his brother doesn’t promise is not to test John to see how freely he will give Sherlock the truth, even though it might hurt him. So he tells him Irene is dead and enjoys the look of grief John gives for his brother.
“He’ll kill us if you let John use the phone,” Irene whimpers, cheeks striped with tears.
“Right then,” John said cheerily, placing the jar of strawberry in the basket. “What’s next on the list?”
