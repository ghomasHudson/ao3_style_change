The soldier he had been tending to, actively pulling off the field, had survived just narrowly. John’s leg had shielded his face from the blast. He’d lost an arm, all the same, sent home in roughly the same shape as John had been.
Clara hadn’t come with her.
Sherlock looked at John again.
Alone.
He didn’t call out.
His new flat was small, though clean. His cane stood nearby, one of the most aggravating changes he was having to get used to. Harry had been by earlier, distraught enough to forego her usual drinking in favor of wailing and moaning over the sight of him. It was funny how that happened, sometimes. It was a habit of hers from when she was a kid – back then, it had been her being the one injured. Distracted from one obsession or another by pain or tears. She had once been dragged down a street by an improperly contained dog, but it had stopped her from arguing with him about something to do with school.
The IED had come not too long after the bullet, with no choice but to continue working to save a life while bleeding from the shoulder. The bullet had gone straight through, so he hadn’t been risking damage, but he had needed to keep going. There had been a life at stake, there had been risks he needed to take to ensure that others survived. He would never have been able to forgive himself if he hadn’t kept moving. The soldier had been in the military for a year, young and stupid about a number of things, but he had a fiancée at home. A daughter on the way, thanks to his last leave.
The building was being swarmed by people with badges, however. He had been advised, by his therapist, to seek out some continuing education classes. The school he had started to look into, had started to lean towards choosing, had apparently been the scene of a crime the night before. Something to do with the suicides, if what he was hearing could be believed. They wheeled a man out on a cart, dark hair falling in curls around closed eyes and John winced.
Huffing, he turned to look at the police surrounding the building. Some of them had the typical signs of magic users – magic was such a fiddly thing, he had never seen much reason to bother with it – and some of them were simply detectives. That one, John noted, was the one who had been investigating the serial suicides. He recognized the man’s hair, then his eyes. The sigil on his wrist was also a nice tell. He worked, commonly enough, with a magical entity of some sort.
“I am, in fact, much older than you. I am smarter than you like to allow for, more experienced than you like to think about, and I am capable of solving crimes you would never think to be able to,” Sherlock turned on Lestrade and John watched his shoulders tense up.
John frowned, watching from a distance as the body was wheeled closer. Were they not going to cover him up, then? They were just going to let the poor chap’s body be exposed to the elements, not even going to give him that last bit of privacy?
“Perhaps a mixture of both.”
Lestrade’s head tilted back and John had just enough time to see the exasperation on his face.
With a laugh, John covered his mouth. “Well, yes, but I don’t know the first bloody thing about you other than you’re an immortal of demonic origin and you just woke up from being dead. Or something close to it.”
Groaning, John turned over and shoved his face into his pillow.
John stared back at him, raising his eyebrows at the pale blue eyes that looked at him. The man was a face out of time – he hadn’t thought faces like that were still around. Immortals were not something he’d had much experience with. “You alright, Sherlock?” Lestrade prompted again. “And don’t just give me the deductions and the figuring it out bits. I will go grab a shock blanket if I need to – the boys’ll take pictures of you.” He cuffed the back of Sherlock’s head gently. “I shouldn’t need to threaten you with that to get you to tell me if you’re alright.”
Lestrade winced. “Yeah, sorry about that. If we could have scheduled it, we would have. I can see if there’s any of the staff or lecturers or anyone nearby – we stopped a few from going inside. We’ll see about getting your day back on track, but it might be tomorrow or something.” He rubbed at his face. Behind him, John noticed, the man stirred up from the cart, hunching over and coughing a few times. “Ah, hell, Sherlock,” Lestrade moved to his side, a hand on his shoulder.
Serial suicides.
“I’ll call you later,” Sherlock tossed over his shoulder. The way he said it made John laugh. It reminded him entirely too much of a teenager shouting at his parents. “Come along, there’s a café nearby. The restorative properties of tea are a wonderful thing, although,” he hesitated, tilting his head. “You do seem to prefer coffee.”
A man in a suit was walking down the path ahead of him and John frowned as he studied the man’s hair. Something about him was familiar, but he wasn’t in the mood to see someone who might know him. Who might be expecting him to be something resembling himself.
They were all just people.
“And you’re still refusing to tell me if that damn poison has done something like put a hole in your gut,” Lestrade argued back. “So until you stop acting like a damn teenager, I am going to act like you’re one.”
John had made certain he would make it back home to them.
Sherlock curled his hand around John’s elbow, taking some of the weight off his feet easily.
Magical could die, same as non-magical.
“Go on then, you git. Tell him what you see.” Lestrade gestured at John. “Maybe you’ll learn to stop looking at stray people and telling them their life story. You found a potential flatmate the other day and by the time we came to see you about the body of Jennifer Wilson, he’d already fled the bloody premises.” He stepped back, sending an apologetic shrug towards John.
The man, Sherlock, looked up. “I told you,” he muttered. The expression on his face was an odd sort of gleeful, his eyebrows raised just so.
“An army man, discharged recently, left with an army pension in the middle of London with a flat he’s not sure he’ll be able to afford.” Sherlock clicked his tongue, looking John up and down. John looked down at himself, at the line of his clothing and what shape his shirt was in. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
In the comments on the article, there were mentions of theories, people angry and scared the way people always were.
In his flat.
“I was looking into continuing education,” John gestured up at the building. “I made an appointment to speak with an advisor on the matter. I would hazard a guess that it’s an appointment I do not get to keep, today.”
The man was bristling like an honest-to-god cat.
For the most part, they were left alone. They co-existed with humanity, they were people just like any other.
(See the end of the chapter for
His mind reeling a little, John glanced back at the man. “Wait, so he’s an immortal, then?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Lestrade groaned, rubbing at his chin. “Are you alright?”
There was already a body bag in the ambulance.
It was the same now.
Getting sent home from Afghanistan with a partially missing leg was, John decided, a frustration he would rather live without.
The details had slipped, over the years, but he remembered her clinging to him as he helped her back home. The argument had been forgotten, after that, and she hadn’t brought it back up again.
He curled his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, protective, and glanced back at John. “Besides, you’ve got an audience to your little strop, here.”
“Sherlock bloody Holmes, don’t—”
“Can I help you?” a man’s voice spoke up and John turned, raising his eyebrows.
“John Watson,” John looked up at the man, nodding. “And yeah, coffee. Lestrade was saying he didn’t have any on hand for you.”
Immortals were rarer, even, than demons. On the scale of commonality, it went from magic-user to demonically influenced to demonic to immortal. Least to most. From where John was standing, there was also another marker of how strange the situation was.
He knew what was happening with his leg.
“I woke up hearing you be worried over a complete stranger and offended on his behalf that his body was uncovered,” Sherlock met his eyes and John froze. “It’s a better start than the other options that have come along,” Sherlock turned to look at Lestrade, who had his hands over his face. The two of them bickered for a moment, just quiet enough for John to not hear. He thought he heard the word, ‘brother’ thrown in, but he wasn’t certain. Sherlock turned back to John, ignoring Lestrade’s attempts to drag his attention away again. “Shall we get to know each other, then? Lovely.”
“Poison,” Sherlock reported in. “Forced the victims to take it at gunpoint. If it hadn’t been for someone cheating, I would have correctly deduced the bottle with the pill made of sugar. Whoever set him up,” he jerked his chin towards the body in the ambulance. “Lied to him about there being a safe bottle this time. He knew he was going to die – short time left, fatal diagnosis. Pity such intelligence went to waste. We know a name, however, and he—”
A demonic immortal.
Flopping back, John pulled out his phone and scrolled through the news, trying to ignore the inscription on the back of the device even as the texture of it brushed his fingers. Clara was going to divorce Harry and that was just one more item on the list of things he felt like he would go mad if he thought too long about.
Yes, poor Gregory Lestrade has dealt with Sherlock Holmes for a very, very long time.
“Yeah, you certainly can,” John scoffed. “You can cover that poor man up – being dead isn’t enough? You’re going to sit there and make a spectacle of his body, as well?”
Well, he had just chosen the absolute wrong day for such a thing, hadn’t he?
John settled into a slow enough pace to keep the pain from flaring up. They were still discussing amputation of the limb – physical therapy had proven that he could still walk on it but they were still discussing whether or not the nerve damage would be progressive. If his life would be made easier by the loss of the deadened leg.
Hang on.
Sherlock stopped, turning to look at John.
Shutting his phone screen off, John set it to the side of his head, sinking into the pillow and closing his eyes. Everything was too soft, too comfortable. The flat was colder than he remembered living being. His dreams didn’t help either, dragging him back to the battlefield and the scorching sun and the pain. The sound of the IED and the ringing of the shot that connected with his shoulder.
“Well, John Watson,” Sherlock grinned. “Sherlock Holmes. Welcome back to London.”
The park was nice enough.
The IED had been a surprise.
“He’ll—” the man frowned, then hissed between his teeth. “He’s ancient as he is and we don’t exactly have coffee on hand. Poor bastard’ll be up any minute and be tearing us apart for not figuring this all out sooner. Is…That’s what you’re concerned about?” he looked John up and down, narrowing his eyes. “I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade. There was an attempted murder, last night, and Sherlock is never going to let us live it down that he was right about it being so. He told us and we didn’t listen and he’s going to give us all hell for it.”
At least he still had a good portion of his leg.
A man had died.
Even he wasn’t sure.
The shot to the shoulder had been bad enough. He’d been certain he’d almost finished out his military career with that one.
Shock and trauma made things worse, he knew that as well.
Sherlock is an immortal of demonic origin. Yes, the magic system of this world will be explained in some more depth later. Yes, there is a hint about Lestrade written in this chapter.
Grabbing his cane, John moved towards the door, making sure he had his keys and his wallet before he left. Wouldn’t do to get locked out, after all.
John stared at the apple on the table in front of him, sighing deeply as he closed his eyes. Shaking his head, he picked it up and set it back in the fridge. He had no appetite for the damn thing, he shouldn’t pretend to. John took a deep breath and stood up slowly.
His walk took him over an hour. Before, it would have taken him twenty minutes to cover the same ground. John closed the door to his flat behind himself, practically tossing his cane into the corner next to his bed as he sat down and covered his face. The length of the walk hadn’t been the thing to set him off – that honor was reserved for the fact that he’d needed to sit down for thirty minutes to regain enough strength and wind to keep going.
Then people were talking to Sherlock, but the ringing was still faintly visible, and the fact that neither himself nor John was dead made the stillness more unbearable.
" John, your the patient, stop doing the work of the bloody Doctor." John looked down at the off white sheets and began to pick at a loose thread. Sherlock though that maybe he had been to hash.
"Here. Now down you go. There you are. All stretched out."
Another wave of sadness swept through him, an emotion that had been almost alien to him before this week. He could almost picture the doctor having the bench made and positioned. This was Harry's favourite spot, he would have told himself. This was where he would want to be remembered, overlooking the castle and the loch.
"You may have no intention of hurting me," he said quietly, "but you also have no intention of seeing out the consequences of kidnapping me either. Or at least not in the legal sense. You could promise not to hurt me, because in the end it wouldn't matter if I reported the abduction or not, the outcome was always going to be the same.
“The players shake hands at the net, but it’s the Frenchman and world number three who marches into the semi-finals. John Watson, the Wimbledon Champion, is on his way home.”
"Nope," the doctor said.
He would never grow tired of seeing Sherlock’s small smile every time he referenced the distant future, the future they were going to have together.
He turned his head as the doctor slumped beside him, the pair of them lying on their backs, only partially touching.
The doctor frowned. "Of course. Why, should I not of?"
"Most of them," the doctor admitted. "Or tried to, at least."
“Why don’t you deduce,” he said slowly as he ran his hand leisurely up the strong thighs and onwards, his thumbs brushing the flies and the stirring interest within, before resting on the button.
“Git,” John muttered, but after a small shake of the head started the walk down the corridor, leading Sherlock out into the bright sunshine.
After a lifetime of travel and adventure, he had devoted the last years of his life to the quiet sorting and publishing of his many findings and observations. It had been a peaceful, pleasant time, one I have only fond memories of, but with his leaving there was nothing to hold me to such an existence and the desire to be once again amongst my own people gripped me.
Walk or stroll, Sherlock certain had more than enough energy to take the driving position, tipping his head back as he finally sank onto John’s length. He took it slowly at first, almost teasing, rising and falling with a grace and ease that had John almost mesmerised. There was no hurry, no deadline to keep to, nothing but the two of them. A change of angle had Sherlock leaning into him, their foreheads resting, their noses brushing, their mouths pressing together, lips parting, tongues mimicking the movements lower down.
And with those words, the day - and the tournament - which had been going to well before then, suddenly plummeted. False sense of security was about right. Contentment built on sandy ground.
It was only a matter of seconds before the breathless response came.
That probably wouldn’t be too bad. A bit wet, a bit weird, but he could do that. Probably. It wasn’t exactly something he had much experience of, but the mechanics looked simple enough. Mouths, lips, tongues – apparently.
“Clara called again. She wants confirmation of your tournament schedule.”
“Watson doesn’t question it, just wipes at his forehead and goes to collect the balls for his serve.”
“So what now, back to the hotel?”
The doctor looked momentarily surprised.
“That happens to everyone.”
Before anyone gets too excited, it's not the quarter finals just yet. :)
He couldn't stay here forever.
"The slanted, uneven ceiling and exposed old dark wooden beams says period property," he started. "The colour and warping pattern of the beams suggests oak, which says well-built and so likely initially expensive. The furniture is mahogany, in a Georgian style. From the wear and slight fading on one side I'd say original not mock. From the scratches I'd say used but not constantly. Fading on the wallpaper suggests pictures have been removed, some more recently than others. The room has been stripped of personal artefacts, but the rug on the floor shows that effort has been made to keep it comfortable. The sheets and duvet are clean but slightly faded from repeat washes so not new, but they match the curtains suggesting the bed has been slept in regularly so unlikely to just be a guest room.
He broke into the packet of ginger nuts.
Hands, lips, skin. Manual stimulation. Hands in particular. That was… not too alarming. He was no stranger to his own hand after all, even if the desire to do that was far less frequent than for some of his peers.
"You're going to rape and then kill me."
It wasn't about him – Sherlock – after all. It wasn't him the doctor really wanted. It was about the doctor. About Harry. About what had been. He had just been caught up in someone else's story. Here, no doubt, because of his uncanny resemblance to someone dead and gone. The doctor could have chosen to kidnap anyone who matched the right criteria. Being here didn’t mean he was special.
"Out. Walk," he said.
Sherlock, the know-it-all, pig-headed arse, thought he knew better, and after a round of raised voices and clenched fists, had challenged him to reach the quarter finals at the US Open. And for some unknown but completely mad reason he had accepted.
"He seemed to have some things to say to you."
He served.
Sherlock’s curls were soft as they slipped soothingly through his fingers. The high of their matches had faded, leaving them sprawled on the sofa drowsy but sated. Sherlock had been right about dinner, they would have had time to go out after the sex, but that would have meant moving and making themselves presentable to the wider world. In the end it had been an easy mutual choice to order room service and stay where they were.
It was just a man of average height and build, of nondescript looks, and carrying a tray while being engulfed by a beige Aran jumper.
not enough... not, ahhh, god, yes... more... good... so good...
There was no apology on the doctor's face, and his confession was just a statement of fact absent of ethics or morality. It was... odd. Normal people didn't act like this. At least not the
Pressing back, he searched for more and was given it, the strokes going deeper and harder, every one rolling against his prostate in a building wave of pleasure. His cock bounced with every thrust and he wanted to touch it, or have it touched, but also didn't want this to end.
Their chests heaved as they both sucked in deep breaths, although for different reasons. A faint sheen covered Sherlock’s face as he wiped at his mouth and John didn’t need to look down to know that he was similarly covered. He felt hot, and desperate, and so much alive. His hand automatically reached for his cock, only to be caught by Sherlock who laced their fingers together.
Perching on the bed, he studied the pistol. It was nothing particularly special and far from unique. Despite its age, there would still be hundreds of its like around. The most obvious course of action would be to destroy it. To take it apart bit by bit. Or to put it somewhere it would never be found - like the bottom of the loch, for instance.
I was originally going with the Beatles' "The Long and Winding Road", but then "Unchained Melody" was just so perfect that I switched them, especially since everything about "Unchained Melody" just screamed this Sherlock and John.
"Oh aye," the stranger said the whole exchange moved from odd to downright uncomfortable. "Chì mi.  Chì mi," he said before breaking into a broad toothy grin. "But by devil's teeth, Hamish. He still naught but a wee bairn."
So not a torture room or a prison then.
The first finger caught him by surprise. There was pressure and then there was more, and he could feel it inside him. It was strange, but not painful. More like a steady presence, then his awareness was distracted once more by the cleaver tongue and he barely noticed when the second finger slipped in.
The doctor's smile was brilliant. "And now we dance."
"What about you? Do you like to dance?"
There was no notebook, no advice, no fool proof tactic that would give him the upper hand. He didn’t even have an elaborate game plan to fall back on, but that did not mean he was without a plan. He had a plan all right.
“Yes, that’s it, John. Come on. Hard as you want. Deep. Go deeper. God’s sake, you’re not going to break me. That’s it. Ça fait du bien*.”
made it work, but it wasn't perfect."
"Well," John said, sucking in a deep breath, "I've done it now. For good or ill. It is done. No going back now."
He slipped the key into the ignition. Somehow he wasn't surprised when the engine failed to turn over properly. The red blinking light on the dashboard told him that in one thing at least the doctor hadn't been lying.
"Perhaps," he conceded with one of his no longer so rare smiles, a warm twinkle in his eyes. "But I in turn do declare that you, my dear Watson, are merely improbable."
John.
“No,” he said slowly, “I’m just a tennis player.”
"Hamish?" he asked pointedly.
It could be-
Grinning, he typed back ‘
The quarter finals. The bet had been that he should be able to at least reach the quarter finals if he put his mind, shoulder and belief into it. It was the challenge Sherlock had thrown down at him, and like the headstrong, impetuous person John could be – especially when any form of gambling might be involved – he had risen to the bait and been reeled in by his cunning, wily boyfriend.
He got to his feet before Sherlock could register what he meant by that.
"Shush, I've got you.”
"Sherlock?"
He jerked to his feet, violin bow automatically rubbing at his neck.
It could be-
“You know, one day you’re going to have to tell me the full story of how the two of you met.”
No, he knew exactly what he had been thinking. He had been thinking that he couldn’t back away from a challenge. He had been thinking that maybe things would start going wrong with them again if he did not start making the later rounds of tournaments.
"Despite your warning to me when we first met, you maintain the appearance of a reasonable sleeping habit, but do not on the whole spend that time sleeping, yet your appearance and temperament is unchanged despite this.
Although not particularly heavy, the rain was constant and insistent, soaking through his clothing and dripping down his face within moments. What had been a beautiful scenic view less than an hour before was now a monstrous wilderness, stretching outwards from him and ending in a haze of poor light. Behind the clouds the sun was already nearer the horizon than its zenith, stealing away the last of the natural light.
He rolled over to his side.
*-*_-*
He set off carefully down the hill, striking out for the valley and the ruin.
The clock chimed the third hour less than ten minutes after they returned. For a moment, Sherlock froze, trapped between action and inaction.
"And then?"
Sherlock straightened his shoulders. This was not how he had been planning to broach the subject, but he had started now. This was where he was now going from and he would only settle on one outcome.
"This was a broch," the doctor said as he led them to the ruin. "A stronghold for those who lived and defended this land. A place of shelter for those under attack. The perfect plot to be able to see for miles, but still easily overlooked by new invaders. More than one ambush was orchestrated from here. More than one massacre as well."
"An old friend."
“Watson bounces the balls and lines himself up for the serve. Good serve. Zhi Zhu returns, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu and Watson closes it down at the net with a tidy volley.”
was about to go in him.
"It's kept very well. Good... sound."
"Loch Lomond"
"Why would he have done that?" the doctor asked.
Mechanically, he gently plucked the G-string, hearing the discord, before tightening the corresponding peg and repeating until the note rang clear and true. At once the instrument seemed to quiver in his grasp, as if desperate to be once more fully heard.
“I thanked them and they left. Two weeks later I received a note by which I took it that the deed was done, and indeed I have found no trace of this individual since, and there have been no further bodies.”
“Yes,” John said. “Which I believe was the aim. At least for you. It was a good match, and until that last set, was quite a close one as well.”
His first realisation was that the vast majority of the pieces were either original pieces or unique arrangements of familiar tunes. His second realisation was that the main handwriting was not of the deceased lover.
With his late breakfast and terrible eating habits, he had hardly noticed the missed meal until the doctor pointed it out. He also recognised a deflection when he heard it.
preoccupied with his phone.
Wordlessly he got to his own feet, looking down at the sticks in his hands.
If the door was unlocked there might be a spare set of keys in the vehicle itself.
Or at least what passed for a town while in the middle of nowhere. Large enough for a small petrol station, a church, a laundrette, and a few shops, including the butchers from where the steak had most likely been purchased.
"Drink?"
it simply said.
"How long have you known?" I asked.
Sherlock offered a nonchalant shrug.
The doctor was gone.
“Trust me, I’m more than happy to share,” John said. “And since it’s my birthday, don’t I get a say?”
Laughing. Reading. Sleeping. Walking. Sitting. Lying. Stretching. Standing.
Floor to ceiling, the shelves held a collection a small library would have been proud of; fiction and non-fiction; plays, poetry, novels; essays and text books; what looked to be an early publication of
“He’s got to be careful that he doesn’t let his frustrations show too much, or have them affect his play. He needs to harness it and turn it into something good, not cause him to throw it away.”
Practice had gone surprisingly well.
That and the fact that he really did want to have sex with him.
The doctor’s lips were a touch swollen and pinker than they had been. Had he done that? Was that the kisses?
I understand equations, both the simple and quad-rat-i-cal,
"Would you be as kind as to enlighten me as to how you are aware of such things?" I asked him with some curiosity.
“And what’s that?” Sherlock said.
He grinned noticing the way Sherlock was now shifting in his seat. “Problem?”
“Just doing my job.”
Happy. Glad. Ecstatic.
“The inside and outside of the ankles are one of those surprisingly sensitive spots,” Sherlock was saying, his voice low and soothing as his fingers stroked their way across the first of John’s feet. “The multiple nerve endings correspond directly to some of the most important erogenous zones in the body. A steady application of pressure can stimulate the blood flow not only to the feet but also to the penis, testicles and prostate.”
He rolled his eyes to signal his exasperation as much as to hide his nervousness.
Now what? What had they been doing?
It was only then that he realised that he had simply presumed that the bedroom he had awoken in would be his.
The doctor offered nothing more, just continued to sit calmly at the table, newspaper spread, mug in hand, just watching him.
Notes:
"No one connected these events, no one except me.
Together those all pointed to a plausible eating disorder, but there was more when other factors were added in.
That had been about four years ago.
"Sleep, mo ghaol," he heard as fingers gently brushed his curls. Then he remembered no more.
“So she’d lie, is that it?”
“That there is. So let’s talk about Watson in that last set then. He won it, and he won it, if not easily, at least proficiently in the end, but there was a moment of possible concern early on.”
“Watson was able to take advantage of that.”
"You don't know what it's like. To live feeling as if you're missing something. It's not living. It’s barely existing. Trying to find something to fill that hole within you. But this,
"Will I see you again?" he asked, looking first at their hands, then down and away. "When all this is over?" When the doctor had gotten what he wanted and Sherlock walked away with the violin. "After we- after I leave here."
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring again,
“Irrelevant,” Sherlock muttered.
The fine weather did however give the opportunity to escape the confines of the property. Fresh air would do him good, and it would help him to judge the likelihood of escape on foot just in case it came to that.
The robe was warm and soft against his bare skin and as he heard the rattling in the water pipes stopping, he hoped he had made the right decision.
. If you are not aware of how much I ardently respect and admire you, then you are less than half the great detective we both purport you to be. Equally, if you truly believe, regardless of my own inclinations, that your confession be so abhorrent to me that I would both quit this residence, and place your life and reputation in the brutal unfeeling hands of Scotland Yard, then
“Right idea from Watson, just played it a little too low and Zhi Zhu is let off the hook.”
Poetry this time, rather than a song:
It was another side of the doctor, one he hadn't seen up until now; a carefree, almost younger side, unconstrained by the loss that fell like a shadow over him. Seeing him unreservedly strut his stuff to
He jerked as reality crashed back in.
“Look, Clara,” he said pointedly, leaving Sherlock with his mobile and his own problems, “was there anything else? I’ve got other things to do you know.”
“Obviously, since you already had a key to Baker Street, that one is a duplicate, but the gesture did not seem complete without that one, more so than any of the others.”
at him.
He was expecting the darkness and stillness. He was not expecting the soothing voice of Vera Lynn.
The note was on the centre of the table. Just five words and the initials.
Sherlock frowned, eyes darting around before they settled on the doctor. "You want me to-" he made a vague motion with his hand.
“God yes.”  A little rearranging and fumbling later and he was sliding back in with a contented sigh. Sherlock was warm and supple following his orgasm, easily accepting the thrusts now he was past the point of overstimulation, whispering encouragement but more than happy to lie back and take what John was giving him.
The doctor was on his feet now, but hadn't made a move to get closer to him.
It was utterly perplexing, illogical even. The man downstairs was a kidnapper, an abductor, his actions far beyond what society would consider acceptable, and yet he was intelligent, funny, surprisingly unpredictable, and curiously easy to spend time with.
“Happy Birthday,” he said, his voice cracking a little around the words he obviously hadn’t been planning on saying.
2) Later folklore: monsters similar to vampires and succubi that seduce young men and then feed on their blood.
"Uh, yes, yes it is."
"Could do the temple, but that runs the same risk. Chin, ditto."
Would he try and come after him?
"The first time we met," I said, my voice surprisingly hoarse.
Stripping out of his now wet things, Sherlock changed quickly and quietly in the bedroom before heading back down into the warmth. It was the second time he had done this now. Maybe the doctor had a point about him bolting out into the rain. At least this time he had managed to have shoes on.
That was at least what he told himself, even going so far as to decline food because he was busy. Perhaps the bigger surprise was that the doctor allowed him to.
“And here comes the tie-break. Holmes to serve first.”
“What? Oh. That,” Sherlock said, snatching up the little notebook as he flung himself down onto the sofa again. “Dinner tonight. Wanted to check what I’ve worn in the past.”
He automatically reached for his forearm, pressing his thumb against the puncture mark. Had it really been that simple?
It had all suddenly made sense. The floating facts that hadn't quite fitted together into a coherent image had finally slotted together; the jumpers that were too big; the comment about not eating properly; the complete lack of snacking between meals.
"Now?"
Sherlock swallowed. Teasing, that was teasing he realised. Teasing was... good. Although that was teasing about sex, and while sex didn't alarm him - it didn't! - he did recognise that he was not without... issues. A lack of practical experience, for one. A lack of
"Sex," Sherlock confirmed. "That's what all of this is about, is it not? Ultimately that's why you kidnapped me. You want to have sex with me. Well if that's the case, I want something in return."
"This one?" The doctor picked it up, turning it in his hand. "Harry probably got it somewhere. Unless, no actually, I know, it was part of the stuff that came from the cottage in Sussex. There was a whole load of things in the attic when we cleared it out. Harry liked the sound of it, so he kept it. Why? What's wrong?"
Even taking into consideration body language and gestures, and his knowledge of other languages, he had little chance of following what was being said. The doctor, however, had no such problem, responding in kind and without hesitation, the words falling from his tongue as smoothly as if they were his first language.
" Allright boys that's enough" Hugo told his men. "It's just a reminder, no long term damage. "
Finally he looked down into the eyes of the his old land lady and said. "Mrs. Hudson, I need your help to rob a bank." At first Mrs. Hudson was as white as a sheet, then her face turned into hard set resolve. "If it helps you get that boy back, then off corse I'll help. You too boys need each other. You where so quiet before John was here." Sherlock's lips turned up in the corner ever so slightly, and he though of what John would say. Sherlock could picture him standing here. His face turning slightly blushed, the nervous shuffle of his feet, the way he clenched and un-clenched his hands. Then the words would come. Those three words he said so often that they had almost lost there meaning.
NUMBER I.D HIDDEN
When John emerged into the living room, Sherlock was sitting on the couch with his knees tucked up under his chin, his black hair a wild mess of curls. John sat down beside him and handed Sherlock the parsle. Sherlock took it begrudgingly, and began to meticulously take of the wrapping. When he was finally finished, he was left with a small cardboard box. Sherlock looked up at John in confusion. "Open It." John prompted. Then he whispered under his breth, "And you claim to be a genius."
Mrs Hudson was a little woozy. She looked at the water overflowing from the open water manes at the base of were each toilet had been. Water beads hung on the walls, and Mrs Hudsons greys was soaked. She lifter her fingers to were she felt a stinging pain, and drew her fingers away bloody. She looked down and saw a piece of ceramic sticking into her skin. This was perfect. Exactly what she needed. She pushed herself up, careful not to put her hands on any ceramic shards.

As his vision became clear, John looked around at his new surroundings. He had been moved from the small dimly-lit torture chamber which he had inhabited for the past few hours, and now lay in a large, empty, Warehouse. He was on the floor, and as he made a move to sit up he realized his hands were bound together. The man who had captured him, the one who had taken him from 221B Baker Street, was standing close bye, with three men standing behind him. Two of them John new. The tall one with a bald head was the one who knocked out John's tooth. The shorter one with the muscles was the one who shattered John's foot. The third one he did not know.
" Here we go." Maggie said finaly, hitting the enter key with a flourish. "Private vault number 322 under the name David Hung. Account number 54298876, access code 2908." Maggie listed these facts out loud, and they where repeated to Sherlock again after the hungry noise of the printer had once again commenced and then abruptly stopped and one more piece of paper was handed into Sherlock's possession. The paper was cover in black numbers, some circled in blue pen, and others indicating other technological and unimportant information, where left unmarked.
"Sherlock Holmes! You came! How marvelous." Said a red haired man with glassy eyes. " Dr. Watson said you would. But he also said that we were dead men. Is that true? Have you got some trick up your sleeve, Mr. Holmes? " The man cock ed his head mockingly at Sherlock. From the instant Sherlock walked through the door, he knew that this man was a psychotic mess. Obviously he he came from an abusive family, and he clearly had more than one extreemly mental disorder. Schizophrenia most likely. Why else would he have cut off his own hand. But clearly the meds -wherever this man got them- were helping. He seemed almost stable. But Sherlock knew he was not.
For the next half hour, John lay in Sherlock's arms, their breathing slowing to a regular pace, the red in their skin slowly subsiding. Neither of them had ever experienced anything like that in their life. As they lay in silence, they could think of nothing but the feel of eachother on their lips. Loving Sherlock was like nothing he had imagined
Sherlock thought of the time he had gone to Buckingham Palace wearing nothing but a sheet, and how John had found this quite an amusing excipad. He thought of the time that he and John had laughed untill their stomachs where sore in an abandoned tube compartment that contained an extreemly powerful bomb. He thought of the night he and John had been at the public swimming pool, dim and full of shadows, and how they had laughed after the world's only Consulting Criminal had threatened Sherlock's life.
Sherlock extracted a set of keys from the pocket of his oily costume, and aproached his borrowed company car. He loaded his gear into the passenger seat and then climbed in the drivers side. Sherlock did not often drive, but he could do it well and in a few minutes he was we into the thick of London traffic. Just as the traffic slowed to a crawl Sherlock turned into the small lane way that led to the back gate bank security check.
"Why? Why can't I watch telly?" John sounded genuinely confused.
In an instant Sherlock had whirled himself into the bathroom and locked the door. A pit began eating it's way at Johns stomach. He realised now what a supid idea this had been.
John gave him a confused look. "Um- I don't see how-" Sherlock cut him off.
arest me. Well not really. Just follow me. I'll give them the bomb, they give me John, then you and Donovan come and arest them. You get the credit and you can blame them for the bank bombing. It's simple. I'll text you the adress now."
"I have had enough of watching you waste your time and miniscule intelligence on exceptionally dull television programs. Do something else John. Your driving me insane."
"Ready or not?"
That was all it took. In a moment Sherlock was bent over the Hospital bed, his lips soft against John's.  John pushed into the kiss, feeding a hunger he didn't even know was there. In those moments Sherlock felt the tension he had been carrying for the past ten days slide away, a desperate desire for John taking its place. All the feeling Sherlock had for John, and god knows how long he has has them, were pored into that kiss.  A burning that had no parallel. It was like nothing he had ever felt before.  The two of them kissed like one was air and the other was drowning. Like nothing in the world had ever mattered as much, and in a way, that was true.
Penelope led Sherlock briskly down the hallway, then turned into another. Sherlock visualized the hallways in his mind. Pulling the blue prints out of his mind palace and verifying them with the route this woman was leading him on. Everything seemed to be correct. Soon Penelope stopped at a grey, heavy looking door, and knoded with her head sharply toward the it. " This is the security room. I must watch you as you work for security reasons. So get to work! I'm a busy woman with not alot of time." Sherlock did not hesitate on her offer. He immediately opened the door and walked inside.
Sherlock also could not understand how the idiot in the security chair could pass this as a "heating duct inspection". He was alarmingly think, even for Sherlock's standards. As Sherlock moved to the third wall to search for the final wire, Jackson sat there twiddling his thumbs. Sherlock was preparing to rob the bank right in front of the moron's eyes. He was quite baffled by Jackson's ignorance.
But Sherlock knew that wasn't right.
After another couple minutes, John had regained more of his senses, and he began to make an effort to sit up. Sherlock quickly came to his side, propping him up with pillows and making sure he was comfortable. Once he was in an upright position, John, being the doctor that he was, began to take his own heart rate, and read his own monoters from where he sat. Sherlock quickly realised what John was doing and put a stop to it.
"Uh.... Sherlock... I.... Uh..... I just wanted to apologise." Sherlock raised an eyebrow, unsure what she was referring to. " For... for insulting your humanity. Not for the sanity part, I still think you mad, barking mad, but I'm sorry for calling you a creep... and inhuman. You see I genuinely believed it. I though that you were a sick son of bitch, getting off on murders and crime scenes. But then I saw you back at the warehouse, ready to give your life away, and your incredible mind with it. All for the sake of a man, the love of another human being. And that made me realise that you really are just a high functioning sociopath, who by some miracle found the one person on this plaint who could love him despite it." This seemed to remind Donovan why Sherlock was in the hospital to begin with. "How is he?" She asked, a note of sadness audible in her voice. "He will be fine if he wakes up." Sherlock said in a toneless voice. As much as he appreciated the apology for the years of scrutiny he had been under from this woman, all he wanted to do in this point in time is be by Johns side. So after a quick nod of thanks, Sherlock turned on his heels and headed back to John's hospital room.
I would like to thank all the visitors who gave my work kudos.
" Sherlock " John said, breaking a silence he didn't notice was there. "Can you do something for me?" Sherlock looked skeptical. " What is it?" He asked, hesitant to say yes. "Will you go to sleep?" Sherlock looked at John as if he had asked him to cook dinner.
John new the detective well, new him better then he could ever imagine. And for the tall man folded up beside him, John knew the past ten days had been hard. John had had the leisure of sleeping and dreaming, while Sherlock had been sitting by his bedside, fretting and laboring at staying calm. And John, being the empathetic man that he was, felt sorry for him.
crazyer than most people. And he
Sherlock relized what an emotional train wreck he had been over the corse of the day. One minut he was confidant, the next he was stressing. One moment he was angry, then he was sad. This wasn't right. This wasn't natural. This wasn't Sherlock.
The moment he spoke, John knew he had gone too far. Hugo's face contorted in an ugly rage. His eyes narrowed and his mouth curled unevenly. With a slow and menacing walk he closed the distended between John and himself. John knew that whatever came next, it wouldn't be good. His blood began to move more rappedly through his veins, his heart quickening. However he took deep breath and refused to let his fear shoe on hid face. He even dared the slightest smile, only lifting the corner of his mouth slightly.
I apologize for taking so long to post this chapter. I had some Internet problems but they are sorted out now.
Sherlock's skin began to ich with anxiety and a pulse of impatience rushed up his spine. He no longer sat reclined in the large chair, but rather sat rigid and up right, ready to leap to his feet when the time was right. Sherlock's toes curled in his shoose as he watched the seconds tick by on the clock. 8:10 , 8:11, 8:12. Sherlock's whole body was now tense with anticipation. Every muscle under his skin was stiff. If something didn't happen soon, Sherlock feared he might explode. To his luck, exploding was unnessisairy.
The woman's name was Maggie. She used to be a part of Sherlock's homeless network, but unlike most of his network, Maggie came into some money and got off the streets. She now lived 15 minutis away and made money by working at a local corner store. As a side job however, Maggie was a hacker, and was very skilled at the art. Sherlock allways vaguely envyed her for her tallent. He could hack into low security websites,  and high security ones if he had the time, but Maggie could hack into even the most secure government archives without leaving a trace. Maggie owed Sherlock a favor or two, and Sherlock was sure she could get him the bank information that he needed.
*****
Sherlock had a plan. It was simple really. Fool proof if he did it right. People where stupid. Stupid enough to get married and have children. There was no reason they wouldn't let this one slip right under there nose. It was a wonder people didn't rob banks more often. It was probably fear of the law that prevented it more than anything else. He did a few quick calculations in his head before he set to work. It was now 7:14. That gave him 7 hours and 46 minuts to spare. That meant he had to send the photo of the vault content by 3 o'clock. That meant that he could, if he played his cards right- and he always did- have John home before dark. Now that would be an amazingly successful day. Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed in one deep breath of mild sitting room air before setting to work. The first order of business was getting dressed.
"I suppose you want to come in." She said, stepping back to clear the entrance of the door. "No one visits me for socializing, so I assume you are here for business."
"I don't know."
Sherlock hung up, giving Lestrade no time to argue. Then he forwarded him the adress giving to him by John's captor. Judging by the map of London in Sherlock's mind palace, he had only a seventeen minut drive.
" So, do you work on the monitors all day?" Asked Sherlock, who was trying to make convorsation, as a means to distract this, already quite cluelessn Jackson.
Head bent as if to listen better, Sherlock's brow furrowed as they both listened to the sound of the Righteous Brothers.
Hands held him without moving, a solid figure supported him without somehow adding to the maelstrom around him. It was like an unmoving force to which to anchor against. And he sought it out, sinking his fingers into fabric and muscle, clinging on with all he had.
This was their place, their getaway, where they could live and be lovers without fear or condemnation.
He continued to play as he thought, moving from one piece to the next, his fingers dancing over the strings as if they belonged there.
Touch starved would have been another way of putting it. He couldn't remember the last person, other than his parents, he had physically embraced.
He served.
He looked back at Sarah, fixing her with a rueful smile. “Not anymore apparently,” he said, because with that final shot they both now knew exactly who he was going to be playing in the next round.
"It wasn't perfect."
So was this just another gamble with weighted odds? Had the doctor left the keys and vacated the property solely because he was betting that Sherlock’s drive to uncover the unknown was stronger than his desire to escape?
Scrubbing his hands over his face, John turned and returned to his walk. It was a path he had done countless times over the long years, one that only he currently knew of.
"I want to build you up, and up, and up, and up... and then I want to tip you over and watch you soar.
"Yes, but I told you, I'm not going to force you. If this was just about sex then, god, I could have plied you with alcohol or drugs or something back in Cambridge. But that's just wrong."

Swallowing, Sherlock accepted it with a nod, averting his gaze in an attempt to lessen the built up intensity.
While this might have been true - deep down, this Sherlock was a surprising romantic at heart - I was far from appeased by his reassurance, but bade him to continue.
But me and my true love will never meet again,
Sherlock’s look was almost shy.
"I don't-" he stuttered, even as his eyes darted around for possible exits. "I don't understand."
“You know it means you’re even less likely to be able to get rid of me now,” John joked.
He yawned.
After that he was unsure. Should he dress fully? Trousers, shirt, that sort of thing? But that seemed a little ridiculous considering what was going to happen. Why dress when you were only going to undress again? Yet just wearing pants was a step too far in the opposite direction. He needed something that said ‘here I am, I'm ready’, but not, ‘here I am, leave the money on the dresser’.
Day two of the agreed week. Day one had been… informative. Unexpected in a lot of ways. Almost… pleasant… in others.
The remaining words were lost to frantic movement and heated kisses. His knees hit the bed before he even processed they were moving, and then the dressing gown was on the floor and they were on the bed and there was skin and heat and sensation and sound and someone asking for something, someone asking for more, and it could have been him, or it could have been anyone, and the touch of his groin against a thigh was enough to have him rearing up, arching his back, thrusting forward, searching for more.
"There you are," he heard murmured.
“Probably straight sets. Four if Zhi Zhu is more trouble than expected, but Watson all the way.”
The evening was spent quietly.
Meal finished with, the doctor looked up from the newspaper he had spread beside him.
noticed then. For all his mild persona and easy going attitude, the doctor was intellectually sharp. Not perhaps at his level when it came to making deductions, but certainly, despite what he claimed, far more attentive than the average person.
Yes. Yup. Yeah. John could believe that. He could definitely believe that.
"I know you have no reason to trust me," he said finally, lifting his head so their eyes met again. "I haven't exactly given you reason to, but this is the truth. I will not purposely harm you, I will not touch you without your permission, and I will provide you with everything you need to leave this place the morning of the eighth day from now. All I ask that you give me a chance."
Kissing was not going to be the sole act, though, this he was certain. Even with penetration as the ultimate goal, Sherlock was certain there would need to be other activities that would bridge the two extremes.
The view from the window had revealed hills and heather, but nothing in the way of other buildings or people. Doctor Watson had likewise not offered anything tangible other than to say that there was tea downstairs and to come down when he was ready.
He leant in, chasing the sensation that was suddenly racing through his body. It wasn't like the drugs, and yet it was, and he liked it. He wanted it.
He sorted through his clothing, separating out his from what he had borrowed. His repacking lacked the precision neatness of the doctor's original, although he did manage to get it all in his bag. Just. The doctor's estimate of what and how much clothing he would need had been near spot on. It was almost as if he had cleverly planned and engineered this whole endeavour.
They lingered for a moment, foreheads pressed together before Sherlock pulled away and got to his feet.
The confusion melted into something that Sherlock couldn't quite recognise.
The room was warm when he got there, but somehow empty. All his things had already been packed away leaving the room even more bare than it had seem when he had first woken up there.
Slowly coming back to himself, he found the doctor perched between his parted legs, topless, trousers undone, looking down at him as if he was the most amazing thing in the world. It was a look that was almost hungry in raw need, a faint flush to the doctor’s cheeks that Sherlock had never seen before.
The man who did not age.
"May I?" The doctor asked, ever the gentleman, but the question only brought other words to mind.
Positive mental attitude and all that.
I like to imagine fourteen year old Sherlock cloistered away in his bedroom playing this over and over again, while his parents leave him tea while shaking their heads.
“I don’t doubt your ability to get
Drying himself off for the last time, he discarded the wet towel for a fresh one, briefly considered slipping on a bath robe before deciding that since anything he was going to put on was going to some off rather quickly he might as well keep it simple.
, he read,
Having only just recovered from her silver fox comment – what was it with Clara and animal based nicknames? – John closed his eyes as he registered just what exactly
The doctor angled his body towards him but somehow managed to keep their legs from touching.
Now he once more had to face the reality of what he had lost in a fit of stupidity. It had been easier when he had been losing, easier to believe he once could have been someone. Now he was competing with the best of them, but that didn’t stop him from feeling like an imposter, and it was only going to be temporary anyway. It wouldn’t be that long before his body gave out or people realised that Wimbledon truly had only been the last fluke in the twilight of his career.
Three, Sherlock threw the match and purposefully lost, something that had no chance of happening.
“Wonderful lob there from Holmes. Considering that Watson isn’t the tallest of players, it’s surprising that Holmes hasn’t tried for more of them so far this match.”
"No one hired me to bring you here."
The doctor's expression took on a curious tone. "How did I know you were attracted to men?"
Considering that this was his third shower of the day, he wasn’t exactly dirty, but as requested he took his time, cleaning every part of his body while trying not to think exactly why he had been told to do so.
Single bottle chosen, Sherlock turned back to him with a flourish, a broad, proud smile on his face. “Massage. Let’s see if we can really get you in the mood.”
He fell silent. Despite the fact that this was the outcome he had been going for - he had already concluded that the doctor would not relinquish the violin for anything less than the very reason he was here in the first place, and highly likely not even for that - he still felt taken back in surprise that the doctor was so readily agreeing. Truly the doctor must be unaware of the origin of the instrument.
No, the desk was the most likely place. So far he had only given it the most cursory of interest. Partly because what he had seen in it had been completely straightforward. And partly because by it being located in the main room, it was impossible to show an interest in it without the doctor knowing.
Low Road - n. Behaviour or practice that is deceitful or immoral.
"Now," the doctor said, breathing in deeply before tipping his chin so their eyes met straight on, "I believe I promised you the full oral experience."
“Yeah,” John breathed out, “god help me but I do.”
Offering a small smile and his hand - because that was what you did - he was taken back when the stranger ignored both, slapping two strong hands onto his shoulders and looking deeply into his eyes.
“His royal pain in the arse is back at the hotel,” Greg said as a way of explanation as he took some of the bags. “He gave me a list of tasks to do, the last of which was to bugger off, so here I am. Figured I might as well do something useful with my time.”
Sherlock nodded, averting his eyes from the doctor's arousal, thumb absently following a scar diagonally up from navel to lower rib. Something sharp, possibly a blade of some sort, but not a surgical scar, his mind helpfully supplied, but he pushed it aside in favour of grasping the waist and pressing his mouth back against the parted lips, picking back up from where they had laid off.
~ The End ~
Giving in would mean he would want
"I want the violin," he repeated firmly. "And some of the sheet music," he added motioning to the pile on the table, "but mainly the violin."
“Good hold there by Watson. He had to fight for it, but when it mattered he did it. He survives and Zhi Zhu may never have a better chance than that in this set.”
“Yes.”
They ended up in the pub. It was a warm, cosy offering, all dark wooden beams, comfy armchairs and open fire that was as reassuring as it was stereotypical. The name proclaimed it to be The Cock and Fiddle. No doubt a corruption of something lost to the winds of time, but the hanging sign embraced it enough to at least show a cockerel clutching a violin.
"The highlands were once ruled by Clans," the doctor said as they walked. "Mackenzie, Frasier, McDonnell, Chisholm, Grant, this area has seen them all. Been fought over more than once. Of course that all ended after Culloden."
The rest ended back in Scottish Gaelic and then the stranger was off, firm slap to the shoulder for Sherlock, clasped arm shake for the doctor, before a near bellowed greeting to the bar lady, and then off back into the cooling afternoon.
The warmth, the drink and the concerto was more than he needed, and he allowed himself to sink into a pleasant meditative state where he could sieve through the recent events, marking them and sorting them so they could be stored.
He slipped his arm around Sherlock, who wiggled a bit until they could find a mutually comfortable position.
He continued to plod onwards, the road running in a not disastrous south-easterly direction. Two miles at least covered and he still hadn't yet seen any other sign of civilisation, not even a telegraph pole.
I had not, however, counted on the man who was Sherlock Holmes.
"Is that him?"
He almost regretted the choice the moment the bass started on the opening track and the doctor raised an eyebrow at the choice.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but slowly turned his hand over so they were palm to palm, their fingers sliding together.
“John.”
“Watson still very much in this as he lines himself up for his next serve. He readies himself, freezes and now serves. Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson backhand crosscourt, Zhi Zhu backhand, Watson down the line, Zhi Zhu, but he’s pushed it wide and Watson clenches his fists as he realised that he’s held his serve after what had looked like a very dangerous moment for him.”
The fire was considerably larger now, adding brightness as well as warmth to the room. The doctor was once more crouched beside it, carefully feeding additional logs, seemingly mindless of the heat it was throwing off.
"You're bound to be hungry," the doctor said after a moment. "There's plenty to eat in the kitchen, but I'm guessing you'd prefer to talk first."
He tried not to look so surprised to see her. With the success that she had found with Molly Hopper in ladies doubles he should have expected to see her. He had just been so caught up in other things that it had not crossed his mind that she might still be around.
He sucked in deep breathes.
The junior mentioned that trains with John is Oliver Golding, 2011 US Open Boys’ Champion and 2010 US Open Boy’s Doubles finalist. Unfortunately, he never made it on the adult tour.
“Hmm. Thanks,” he said, then pulled away from the kiss as the words filtered past the cloud of arousal dominating his mind. “Wait. What?”
Reaching over, John placed his hand over Sherlock’s giving it a gentle squeeze. “Sounds perfect,” he said. “So, tell me about this place. I’m guessing family run, right?”
Three days following his last case - a trifling affair involving missing silverware from a local church, neither interesting enough in setting nor remarkable enough in the solving to warrant setting down on paper - I left Holmes lying listlessly on the sofa in his dressing-gown, having determined that other than using less ethical means I would be unable to rouse his interest in anything. He had barely spared a word for me in days, and unable to do little else, I left him to his mood.
That was definitely different.
"Stop it."
What the hell?
It didn't stop with that song though. The doctor barely paused as he plucked out record after record, leading them through Stevie Wonder, The Jacksons, and then the Bee Gees.
In the end it was four words that slipped out in an almost strangled tone.
Awareness creeping back in, Sherlock lay still, eyes closed as he once again tried to take in his surroundings. He was in bed, the covers heavy and warm over him. Not
"Good."
Sherlock shuddered, fumbled to press kisses against his face, and then seemed to just give up, still rocking, head tilting sideways and then back, mouth open until, “John, I’m… I’m….”
The waiting was intolerable.
Indeed, so fascinated by my differing physiology, my previous Sherlock had discarded his initial shock and scepticism in favour of in-depth scientific exploration. That it had taken so little time for that exploration to take on a more
"Is this about the drugs?"
“Try my kit bag.”
"It's a perfectly valid question," the doctor continued, his tone now serious. "But the answer is no. I'm not asking or expecting that of you."
One near the end caught his eye though.
It was late September when the event finally occurred. It had been a little over nine months since we had taken the rooms together and six months following the events laid out in what has become known as "A Study in Scarlet".
“Love Really Hurts Without You” was one of the first songs attached to this story, although I ended up using it in a slightly different way than I had originally envisioned.
Borrow it? As if he would ever be able to give it up.
"You bought steaks," Sherlock said slowly.
“That wasn’t what Watson wanted and it looks like he knows it.”
John was in him.
John nodded back. “Good. Now do something with that,” he motioned to the postcard. “Bin it, shred it, even burn it, just get it out of my sight and out of your mind.”
The doctor's hands felt cool as they gently caught his and held him. Nothing intrusive. Nothing encroaching. Nothing compared to what Sherlock had just done to him.
“You’re disappointed.” Narrowed eyes, furrowed brow, unnaturally still lower face; this was more than Sherlock’s usual confusion.
“Amazing. Just think how far Watson has come in the past few months. Three months ago most people had forgotten who he was. I admit, even I had forgotten what he was capable of. Now look at him. He’s back, he’s up there, and he’s taking on the big boys.”
His legs hit the cupboard behind him.
Oh, he was angry now, because Sherlock had promised, the lying git had fucking well promised that he would share anything that happened in regards to Moriarty, that they would never have a repeat of Toronto where Moriarty would be able to use them, their relationship, against them. Sherlock had looked him in the eye and promised. The bastard had even sealed it with a kiss.
"You, uh, might find it more comfortable to unzip yourself," the doctor said, then he was sinking to the floor, holding out a hand in invitation.
The doctor beamed as he motioned to the object he was now standing beside. It was a portable electric space heater, Sherlock realised after a moment. Not massive, but designed to plug into the wall and would certainly make a positive difference to the temperature in the upstairs bedroom. It was also obviously the primary reason for the doctor deciding to go out.
“It looks like we’re getting ready to start, both players now back at their chairs, going through their final checks. Watson is at the far end in blue and white, while Holmes is in white with blue pin stripes, and it will be Watson to open the serving.”
Sherlock frowned. “So… good?” he said.
Despite all the jokes about Sherlock having had the easier match, it was John who found himself the last awake that night, Sherlock out for the count not long after crawling under the covers. Maybe it had been the match, or the sex, or the good meal, or maybe it was simply that Sherlock had far less on his mind than he did.
"I, John Hamish Watson, swear on the blood of my ancestors and the memory of my lost lover, that on upholding your agreement to actively and willingly participate to the best that you are able, activities of a sexual nature as mutually agreed upon, you William Sherlock Scott Holmes will leave this place, freely, in sound body and mind, without obstacle or restraint, with all that you came with and in full legal possession of the violin you are currently holding. This I solemnly vow."
Jerking up, he looked around, searching for his companion, but found only still emptiness. He could hear the hiss of water through the old pipes, the gentle hum of the fridge, the soft crackles of a dying fire, but little else. He certainly couldn't hear any sign of shared occupancy.
“Case in point though. Want to try the truth this time?”
"You alright?" the doctor asked, honestly looking like he wanted to know the answer regardless of what it might be.
Sherlock’s voice was partially muffled by the way his head was tilted to nuzzle at John’s neck.
The sheet of paper was on the table when he went down that morning. Beside it was the nib pen that had been obviously used on it. Catching his name amongst the plain but flowing script, he paused with a frown.
The word surprised even him.
“He’s got to concentrate and trust his instincts. It all came together in the last set; can he do it again now?”
It was… surprising.
"Shush, I'm here, my love."
Sherlock snorted. "You would remember if you had," he said.
"Don't wander too far from the paths," the doctor called as Sherlock finished lacing his boots. "And back by three, remember."
It really wasn't working.
Apologies in general to anyone who is Scottish. I honestly tried my best when it came to accents and phrases. One day I will learn not to have a main character speak even temporarily in another language or dialect.
“Yes. Definitely. Definitely a, uh, groan.”
It wasn't far after that, and then the doctor was parking them up and opening the door. He shouldered the rucksack himself, shaking his head at the offer to share, and then led them onto a near hidden path and upwards.
Could it really be as simple as that?
Sherlock gave a short nod. "Eight months," he admitted. "It... helped... with my coordination."
famous actress and all that.
"Hamish, ye auld wee bastard!"
"Yes," the doctor said, eyes fixed on the pictures but seeing something more.
Joining to doctor at the table, he took the offered plate and started to eat. The food, cottage pie with veg, was warm and filling, and although they shared conversation, the doctor didn't mention the time he had lost while he had been organising his thoughts.
And two-
Lifting his hand, he reached out to press his fingers against the doctor's face, but then his hand was caught, lips pressing against it in a kiss, and then the doctor was back with him, momentarily sucking on the soft skin on his wrist before layering kisses down his arm and onto his chest.
"But where? Not the front of the head. Gun that old, underpowered bullet like that, you're more likely to simply damage the cerebral cortex, which may not be life threatening."
Twilight or not, it was less than an hour to sunset and he had to decide what to do. This was the only shelter he had seen since setting out, so staying the night in one of the still mostly enclosed rooms would not be the most outrageous idea. He could do with a fire though, as the night would not be kind. He also needed to do a sweep of the immediate area to make sure there was nothing untoward that he might have missed.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Blue five. "Uno."
“Whose birthday is it?” John asked jokingly, raising an eyebrow.
“Nothing.”
Lily-livered: Elizabethan slang for cowardly.
"Yet you let me go anyway."
“Wrong,” he said. “All very, very
Could he? Should he?
The eyes stayed a little longer, until Sherlock gave a minute nod.
They returned to watching the fire, time slowly ticking away.
The doctor offered a greeting smile as he looked up from his mug and book. "Sure," he said. "Your boots are by the back door. Coats and waterproofs are under the stairs. Help yourself. There should be something that fits. There are thermal flasks in one of the kitchen cupboards. Take food and water with you, especially if you're planning on being out for more than an hour."
"Must be the truth." I shook my head in shared amusement. "I do declare, that you, Holmes are sometimes something quite impossible."
Of course this was planned. Sherlock had probably gone through his wardrobe and picked out the outfit most conducive to seduction. As usual he was pretty well spot on, wrong only on the account that the clothing barely mattered. He could be wearing a bin liner and John would be happily seduced.
The doctor held out a hand. "Dance with me?"
This Harry - a genius by his own hand, unacknowledged by his peers, an outsider in society on account of his sexuality – had had a home, pastimes, and a devoted lover who had adored him and who he had adored in return. In additional to all of that, he had also owned a unique piece of history, the pinnacle of musical perfection.
Springing to my feet, I paced to the window. Despite the many times of having such a conversation, I found it to never get any easier.
Maybe it was the sounds, or lack thereof. Maybe it was the smells that were somehow unfamiliarly familiar. Or maybe it was the weight across his supine positioned body that spoke of a bed with covers that his mind had no recollection of reaching. Maybe it was all or nothing of these, but by the time his conscious mind reassert itself, he knew for certain that something was not right.
The hand rested squarely on his chest, palm over his heart. The second hand slid around his waist and then the lips were against his neck, his collar bone, his throat, and the sensations made him gasp.
exactly did you deduce that?”
It was... fascinating.
"If you want an excuse for a closer look, you could unpack that box, if you like."
At some point Sherlock had stripped away the duvet and had spread an extra sheet over the bed, but the pillows remained and John stretched himself out, head on the pillows, upper body tilted slightly so he could see what Sherlock was doing.
A small smile. "To start with."
Oh god,
"Also known as graduated exposure therapy," he replied automatically. "A type of behaviour therapy used in the field of psychology to help effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders...." He let his words trail off as the facts filtered into their current situation. The situation where he had just agreed to have sexual contact with someone he had barely had any physical contact with up to this point.
His opponent didn’t even try for it. That was good. That was very good.
“It’s fine,” John said, reaching across to rest his hand over Sherlock’s. “It’s all fine. I don’t want anything special. It’s going to be a long enough day as it is, so you and me is more than enough. Alright?”
Grabbing his towel, John sank into his chair and reached for his water bottle. His shoulder was a little sore, but that was to be expected, and his pre-match nerves had settled, partly helped by Sherlock’s distraction technique in the corridor before they had been called courtside.
So what was he waiting for?
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
It was his birthday in four days and he had never felt so old.
But god help him if he met Moriarty any time soon.
“You have complained no fewer than five times in the past fortnight of not having enough socks for both training and matches, particularly due to the practice of wearing two pairs at a time to avoid blisters. Also, of the ones you do have, a couple have been lost to our, uh, extra curriculum activities, so it seemed prudent-”
Used manuscripts for Elgar, Schubert, Vivaldi, and all of Paganini's Caprices, amongst others, belied the doctor's comment regarding Harry's abilities. Out of practice Harry might have been perhaps, a novice unlikely. He was, therefore, loathed to pick anything that Harry might have played.
Nothing was quite right.
"So, uh, what was he saying then?"
It wasn't a particularly good plan, he conceded, but it was at least a plan.
without full approval, which she’s unlikely to get.”
“Watson punches the air in celebration, acknowledging the crowd, drawing on their support. He knows that unless he does something stupid then this set is his for the taking, and that would take him one step closer to booking himself that all important ticket into the quarter finals.”
"Not to speak of," the doctor replied. "Only child. Older parents. His mother passed when he was nine, his father when he was in his late twenties. It was different then, but I don't think they were particularly close. He had a cousin, ten, twelve years his senior, who he kept in touch with, but that was about it."
“Your partner must have good taste. I’m sure you’ll find the retailer to be one of good reputation.”
For the amount of time and investment Clara was putting into his case – for half her going rate of course thanks to his crafty negotiation during Wimbledon – he had to wonder how she had time to fit in the rest of her clients.
Life was surprisingly good.
in Arabic.
He was safe. It was just the doctor. He was safe.
“Yes,” John said mildly.
He knew the facts. Until then he hadn't heard anyone converse in it.
"A Scot."
, but he couldn't give in to it. Giving in would be a mistake.
He considered the likely consequences of each option, and then he considered them even more.
Sherlock took the second armchair.
"Did you- yes?"
He looked back down at the gun.
It was like when Daddy had tried to explain things when he had been a child. When they had moved to that new house and suddenly they were being introduced to other children. And it had been horrible and all, 'it's not
The cupboards were slammed shut again, an annoyed but determined look on the face.
"Do you want me to come?"
He breathed in deeply as Sherlock’s voice brought him back, and opening his eyes he found his lover looking back at him, all knowing smile and arched eyebrow.
“Of course I know it’s your birthday,” Sherlock said back with a hint of sharpness in his tone.
The one that had been lost in the fire.
“That’s good to know. Won’t be cheap though. Should I ask how much this is going to cost on such short notice?”
Then another book, even more intimate than what had gone before; asleep nude except for the falling sheet, light streaming through the window; off angled, upper body close up, neck strained, mouth open, head tilted back from unseen pleasure; two hands clasped together beside a turned away head.
"What then, was I to do? I could not, in good conscience, involve the authorities in such a matter, for even if they believed me as to the true nature of the club and to the nature of the members - none of whom, I had determined, other than this individual, were responsible for anything untoward - there was a good possibility the authorities would judge all as guilty and thus treat all the same.
An hour passed and another ticked ever closer. It was gone midday, so if he was to return to the cottage he would have to turn back now to have a chance of returning even by sunset.
Those were not the words either of them were expecting.
They had been having sex. The doctor had penetrated him. It had felt surprising good and he had been just reaching climax when-
"Sherlock-"
And he breathed in the scent that was both comforting and somehow familiar. And for that moment he never wanted to move. He just wanted to stay there, warm, safe… loved.
Still he wanted more.
He tore his hand away, turning and fixing a smile to his face.
He nodded, rising to his feet. Match bag, racket bag, shoe laces done up – tripping over them and falling flat on his face was something to be avoided. Other bags securely stowed away – no postcards to be slipped into them at least. Mobile relinquished to the safety of the locker. He took a deep breath and joined the steward by the door.
It took him longer than he had expected to eat and get ready, but everything was where the doctor had said it would be. With the coats he found a small rucksack that was big enough to take his sandwiches, crisps, biscuits and drinks. He filled a flask with black coffee and slipped it into the side holder. He added two of the small unopened bottles of water, then threw in an extra packet of ginger nut biscuits when the doctor was out of the room.
He frowned.
"Amazing."
“The noise from the crowd has just gone up another notch. Watson collects the balls and bounces them as he makes his way back to the baseline. He’s just one point away here from being broken. Holmes has two break points.
Then with a blink the moment was gone, the air releasing from the doctor's lungs as he pulled in on himself and looked away.
"To be fair," the doctor finally added with what was undoubtedly going to be the justification or explanation, "you drugged yourself." The doctor nodded towards him, towards his arm. "I just switched the bags. But in essence, yes, I drugged you."
“There’s a reason why Zhi Zhu has got this far in this tournament and having lost the first set on the tie-break he’s managed to find something to step up his game and take it right back to Watson.”
"No really," the doctor reiterated, "that was something, something really quite special. What made you choose that one?"
Small drops of rain made their way through the gap in the window, some trickling down the inside of the glass. Sherlock barely registered them as he sat, the steering wheel gripped tightly in his hand.
“Good night, John.”
“Eight hundred and forty-three acres,” Sherlock said as they walked. “The first public landscaped park in all of the United States. Larger than Regent’s Park and Hyde Park combined, and larger than the principality of Monaco. Admittedly Richmond Park is nearly three times the size of Central Park, but probably best not to tell the locals here that.
“Better,” Sherlock declared as their lips parted. “Now, go to sleep.”
He afforded me the curtesy of raising his eyes above his book, but did not lower the text.
Between the foot of two not insignificantly sized would-be mountains, he found himself facing the unenviable question of whether to follow the river and brave the forest, or go high, risking non-existent paths on treacherous terrain but staying in the open.
"So beautiful," he heard the doctor say. "You're doing so well. Now, just let me-"
The doctor looked impossibly tired as he rubbed the side of his head. "Sherlock, look, I'm really not in the mood for-"
"I want the violin."
"Yes," the doctor replied, tongue flicking at his lips to moisten them. "You don't need to confirm now, but if you have sex with me, then yes, you can take the violin with you when you leave."
Head hanging, he panted as once again the doctor stopped. The stretch was more intense now, not painful, just intense.
"Morning," the doctor greeted, half turning to offer him a smile. "There's some hot water if you want a shower. Tea and coffee are on the side. Help yourself to whatever you want for breakfast. There's cereal, bread, eggs in the fridge if you're feeling adventurous. Fruit if you would prefer."
was his next.
Until this point he had rightly and obviously refused to consciously consider the doctor in a sexual manner. Five days ago the doctor had been nothing more than an abductor, a kidnapper and a potential rapist. Today he was still all of those things, and yet he wasn't, because now he was also a man, a bereaved lover, and a surprisingly easy and interesting companion.
Had he?
Lifting Sherlock’s hands, he carefully wiped them with the warm, damp flannel, removing the last traces of lube and massage oil.
It was not what he had been expecting. Jammed full of all sorts of things it was a preverbal treasure trove; paintings and pictures, but also books and journals; display cases, both large and small; a moose head and a skull; a wardrobe with a faded red uniformed arm poking out; far more than he would have thought.
The intensity of his arousal shocked him, dwarfing as it did even those first moments from his early teenage years. One kiss, that was all it had taken, one deep, proper, all-encompassing kiss.
A childhood classic, my then four-year-old nephew actually managed to beat me at this once without me actually choosing to lose. Couldn’t congratulate him too much on it or he’d realised I’d thrown some of the previous games, though.
"You really don't need to-"
He threw the statement towards the doctor without warning to see how he would react. True emotions tended to be shown when someone was caught off guard, and if he was to predict with any sort of accuracy how this was all going to end, he needed to know who the doctor really was under the layers of beige coloured mildness. It was time to prove that the doctor didn’t hold all the cards in this game.
"What happened here?" he asked, motioning to the ruined castle as he caught the doctor up. It wasn't the question he most wanted to ask, but it was the one that seemed safest.
room. True, he hadn't then been looking for what he was certain to exist if his deductions proved right, but it was hardly something he might have glossed over had he seen it.
John watched as the vehicle drove away, his eyes closing only after it had been lost even from his sight.
“You're a bastard, John Watson."
Again there was no reaction.
There had to be something here. Something he could use.
The 23 Hilbert problems
Pencil was scribbled across the backs of each frame.
"That may be," I said with some shortness, "but even your skills could not foresee what I am about to tell you. It is unlikely that you will even believe me, but it is of the honest truth, and I beg that you at least let me finish before declaring my sanity suspect."
He turned away at this, preferring to focus on anything but me, even as the words continued to pour from his lips.
had been. Just perfect.
The warm puffs of air were joined by a gentle caress down his cheek that was somehow both soothing and sustained the sensations lower in his body. He leant into it, wanting more, but was confused when he didn’t get it.
The rest of the meal passed in a haze of good food and even better wine, all slowly consumed and savoured along with the company and conversation.
Could he possibly be lying?
The doctor turned back to his book. "Take a torch with you, just in case," he added. "And a compass. There should be one around. Oh and dress warmly and eat before you leave."
“All will be revealed in good time,” Sherlock said. “But first breakfast, then we have a match to play.”
He didn't answer and the doctor didn't press.
It confused him how readily the doctor seemed to be allowing him to go, but the other man made no move to either follow or stop him. Yes, he might have given his word that he would stay seven days, but surely the doctor was not naive enough to believe that he would necessarily keep it, especially when given the opportunity to escape.
"Well, yes," the doctor agreed. "Last night was a late one and you were up early, going through the room."
"Aye," the stranger said with a tone of amusement. "So ye haena forgot me then." The stranger didn't stop there though, but whatever came next was lost in a stream of vowels and guttural noises that took Sherlock a moment to realise wasn't English, and another moment to realise was good for honest Scots Gaelic.
Sherlock stared at the keys while he ate his cereal.
“How’s your shoulder?”
This Sherlock, I had hoped, would be no different, being that he had the curiosity of a scientist and the open mindedness of a detective. That said, I found myself, at least initially at first, content to simply get to know the man he currently was.
“Smart side of casual will be fine. Shirt, jeans, that sort of thing. I’m sure anything you chose will suit.”
“Watson to serve, with two set points. All he has to do is take this point and the first set is his. Watson to serve… it’s good. Zhi Zhu returns, Watson forehand, Zhi Zhu again, Watson closing in at the net with the volley, Zhi Zhu gets it, second volley Watson, Zhi Zhu, Watson again, Zhi Zhu, but he pushes it wide and Watson takes the point, the tie-break and the set.”
"Not as such," the doctor admitted. "But we were Highlanders once. It's definitely in my blood, so to speak."
“You think I might be feeling some sort of pre-match contrition given the most likely outcome of the game and so I’m pre-empting it by striving to alleviate your physical suffering prior to any emotional distress you may later find yourself under?”
Improbable or impossible?
The doctor held his gaze for a moment before putting down his own mug. "I'm not going to lie," he said, "yes, I want to, as you say, penetrate you. It's not for everybody, but I want you to be willing to at least give it a try. But more than that, by the time we get that far, I want you to want it too. If I've done my job right, then you will. If not," he raised his hands, "we will stop and try something else."
The doctor frowned. "Am what?"
“I know he loves me. Is
Then all the contact disappeared and Sherlock was rearing up away from him.
The doctor was quiet for a moment, taking his own seat, studying his own drink.
Then there was the fact he had rather come to enjoy it.
“And you’re making me joint owner of Baker Street.”
John gave a mock sigh. “Okay, fine,” he said, reaching out to tug Sherlock back down onto his lap where he belonged, “but you can do all the work, Mr I-walked-my-match-in-one-hour-twenty.”
“Good,” John said, “because you and time are two things I very much plan on taking.”
“I’m sure,” John replied.
Sherlock.
Because words are easy, but love was not. Love wasn’t easy, but it was worthwhile.
The doctor would just have to take him as he found him.
He shoved the first ball into his pocket and balanced the second on his racket head. Sherlock was already at his baseline, twisting his upper body in his final warm up. No different from practice really.
Moriarty.
hate him; his genius, his art, his flawless fucking violin. And your
“Have you finished protesting now?” Sherlock asked.
Perhaps the question of why was unnecessary considering the command had been followed by a reason, but also because lying listlessly with his head hanging off the sofa was perhaps reason enough for the doctor to suggest a change of activity.
. I find myself at an uncharacteristic loss. Having never dared to fully consider that even if you might share the same... affliction... you might also consider me to your liking, I now know not what to do or say."
This was it, he realised. This was the moment.
They mixed with other images; of a dog that wasn't a dog, a house that no longer was, and a young girl who didn't exist.
Rushing into the bedroom, he made directly for the bed, thrusting his hand desperately under the pillow even as he mentally berated himself for letting his guard down. He had completely forgotten about the weapon and the danger it represented.
There were no games that evening. Instead, Sherlock browsed the bookshelf while the doctor read through the copy of The Sunday Times he had bought while out. It was... nice.
Clearing his throat, John pointedly raised his eyebrows in the direction to where Sherlock’s fingers were tapping on the table top.
It wasn't the warmest weather wise, but the tea was hot and the view was stunning. They spoke little and stayed until the chill caught up with them.
The doctor had taken the space heater to the room and set it up under supervision and had then hummed to himself as he made lunch for them both.
The doctor's laugh was one of delight, then the fingers flexed again and the sensation only increased.
John went for the kiss the moment the door to their hotel suite shut behind them.
“Oh, for god’s sake.” He stormed out to the main room to where Sherlock was lounging on the sofa, fully engrossed in the match on the screen. “Sherlock, your mobile.”
Another step forward.
Music: A Modern Major-General
He trailed off as the doctor, who as he had been speaking had risen to his feet and moved across the room, tugged open the heavy curtains. Pale light flooded in, and although dampened by the greyness of the cloud cover and the light but steady rain, it did little to obscure the sight of the rugged sweeping landscape that was definitely not part of the Home Counties.
He had grabbed the doctor and kissed him.
"Which means you want something."
"And then, there was this," the doctor said as they finally reached the top of their ascent.
Chapter notes:
The violin, he thought, and the experience.
The tale doesn't quite end here though. I have a one-shot prequel that I'm going to post tomorrow which tells the tale of John and Victorian Holmes, written in the style of one of John's Strand stories.
Then came the pain. John felt the blade of the knife slice effortlessly through his skin. The cut started just underneath where John's collarbone met his sholder, and continued to slice in a slow, parallel, line to where the bone met his sternum . The cut felt hot and sharp. John could feel his blood over flowing from his opened veins, slowly running down his chest. But he never broke eye contact. Not once did he look away from the torturous man. He showed no sign of pain. And just as Hugo finished the cut, John horked up some phlegm from the back of his throat, and spat it directly in Hugo's eye.
The next step was going to take a little more time. Sherlock must find the head of security and learn the password to the security maintenance room. The room was secured with a simple metal key-panel, but if Sherlock entered the wrong code, the bank would go into lockdown. Sherlock had considered putting on a 'bad guy' face and holding a gun to the manager's head, but then he remembered the rules from John's captor. No one can know until after it's done. And plus, this was only phase one. Sherlock still had to return to Baker street and get Mrs. Hudson.  So Sherlock had to play by the rules.
His stomach dropped with a cold lerch, and his heard rate doubled in seconds. It was 11:17.
The circled numbers had small scribbled notes writen beside them, informing what each group of circled diets meant. They where in information Maggie had just relayed to Sherlock.  Account numbers and access codes where circled on the piece of fresh printer paper. Sherlock folded the paper carefully and sliped it into his coat pocket.
Sherlock pulled his chair up to the bed side, and sat down quietly trying not to assault Johns senses with too much noise. John rubbed his eyes and looked over at the tall detective in the chair. He gave a weak smile. His skin was still a ghastly colour. The I.V that had been replenishing his blood had not completely revived his complexion.
When it finally happened, it came from Sherlock first. It was Christmas eve. John was sitting on a cleared patch of the kitchen table, Sherlock kissing him with tentative lips. John had decorated the flat with red Christmas lights that cast a delicate ambiance through the room.
- No authorities
Then John was in the ambulance and they were stopping the blood. That was the best part. No more blood. And Sherlock was in the ambulance with them. They made it seem like Sherlock wasn't wanted near John at that moment, but Sherlock had a secret feeling that they only let him stay with John so that they could keep an eye on him as well.
Sherlock ran the information over in his head.
A/N: I am currently out of the country and the place where I am staying has shitty Wi-Fi,  so I apologize for taking so long to update chapters. It will be a while before I can post the next one for this reason.
"Yes." Maggie said, abruptly turning to her computer. "I am capable. I am more than capable. Give me 10 miniuts and I'll have your floor plans, and another 15 to get your codes. Is that good enough for you?" Sherlock checked the time on a clock that hung on the office walls. It was quarter too. Even though he grew impatient, and didn't want to waist time, Sherlock knew Maggie was the best hacker in London, and only an idiot would say no. "Yes Maggie that's good enough." Was all he said in reply.
