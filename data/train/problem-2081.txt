"You should come out with all of us one night instead of locking yourself up with those books."
fan.”
, which I thought was strange.”
“I know. So tell me why
“Oh my god, that was your ex.”
He tried to take some comfort in knowing that he walked the same floorboards, stood at the same windows, but somehow it all felt hollow.
“Don't worry. He can see you. He can. I promise.”
“Seriously?”
I survived war, he would tell himself, I can survive this. But so many nights he wasn't so sure, and he grew to wonder how he survived the war at all.
Irene smirked. “Well it certainly wasn't your warmth and likeability.” She shrugged a shoulder. “Moriarty was good, but he was heartless. He was unstable. The public doesn't root for a man like that. All they want is a good show. Consider yourself lucky. If it weren't for John, the public wouldn't have even noticed if you had died.”
They turned.
The fallen logs became monsters, teeth snapping at his feet. His feet pounded on what should have been solid rock, what should have been the ground, but instead the world gave way beneath him, tilting on an axis before falling away from under him entirely. Impossible. He knew that was impossible. But it kept happening, and all he could do was run from the growling, run from the teeth, run from the splashing sound of blood in pools under his feet.
When he did, he made himself some tea, catching himself in time before he made a second cup, and sat down at the table in the living room, the phone in its plastic bag staring back at him. He leaned his arms on the tabletop and unwrapped the phone. It had scratches across the back from where Sherlock had dropped it onto the rooftop. If he'd been alive, he would have been furious at the scratches. He was much too meticulous to allow such imperfections on his mobile.
The shock of it had frozen
“If you didn't believe me you likely would have called in law enforcement at least fifteen minutes ago. Or you would have guaranteed some sort of defense for yourself, but instead you sat down and talked to me. I don't believe you have any doubt in your mind.”
John was on the verge of passing out when he finally let himself into his tiny room. It was little more than a hotel, just a bedroom and bathroom, but he had been incapable of handling much more since returning from Afghanistan. He set the painting down on top of his dresser, pulling his coat off and draping it over a chair. He turned on every single light, as if that would somehow make the evening more cheerful.
help you a little.”
Sherlock was awake hours before John, his head pounding and cloaked in a terrible brain fog. John was asleep next to him, a fact which at first only drew the reaction of
"Feeling. Definitely feeling."
“Rather tense,” she said.
The night had been long, cold, and laced with intermittent panic. But no other tributes had crossed his path. He had survived the first day, and as far as he knew, so had Sherlock.
The living room had a few chairs, a sofa, a wall of bookcases, and a fire slowly dying in the hearth, left alone with no one to tend it. John paused there, kneeling down on the bricks, adding wood himself, stoking it until it grew to a blaze again. This place was doing all it could to tame his mind on this anxious night.
“Who?”
“Yeah, but I can't just actively hunt people down. It goes against everything I've ever believed.”
“Do finish eating, John. We have a case to attend to.”
of acting decent. Of course, John knew what intentions were worth when it came to Sherlock Holmes.
“What comes after you put this case behind you?”
The silence seemed to last forever. “Have you been drinking?”
“Some days it feels that way.” He shrugged. “No sense in sugar-coating.”
Sherlock suddenly noticed John standing beside him, hands braced on the railing.
And all John could think was,
“For a relationship that you are supposedly happy in, you don't sound all that happy.”
With the balcony doors finally closed, the room cooled off quickly, the chilled brush of cotton sheets soft on their hot skin. The sound of the awakening city outside became muffled and distant, background noise to their deep and even breathing. They had maybe three hours before the alarm on John's phone would go off, sending them off to meet the client. John was tempted for a moment to shut his phone off as Sherlock had, to forget the client entirely. In lieu of doing so, he decided to just accept these quiet morning hours.
"So?"
“It's a sick game.”
“I told you it was amazing, even if you didn't think so.”
“For what?”
“What was your favorite exhibit?”
John turned around to find Sherlock watching him, his hands clasped loosely over his chest.
“You were incapable of climbing stairs.”
“You looked like you wanted to say something.”
Sherlock looked down at him. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock pulled his phone out and placed a call, talking quietly into it, and John sighed, resigning himself to the fact that they would be here a while.
"You don't have to have that intention. It comes naturally to you." John gave him a pointed look. It was difficult to forget the travesty that was their previous Christmas together. In the shadow of Irene Adler's first "death," and because of the cringe-worthy things that Sherlock had said to Molly, that Christmas had at least set the bar very low for this one. It wouldn't take much to be an improvement.
It wasn't as if such a scenario was ever covered in med school or basic training.
People were often described as being like drugs, but knowing John Watson made the comparison even more confusing to him than it already was. Drugs led to addiction, addiction led to pain, pain led to resentment, and on and on and on. But how else could people convey the sense of
“Pass me that bag, would you?” Sherlock blindly reached out to grab it as he stared at his phone in his other hand. He swung his arm around to John. John reached for it just as blindly, and brushed Sherlock's fingers with his own when he took it. Cold, always so cold. Sherlock didn't notice, never did when things like that happened, and he crossed the room, throwing open the doors and stepping out onto the balcony, muttering about reception. “Room service, or are you planning on venturing out?”
Sherlock said nothing. His brain felt too foggy to form anything eloquent. He imagined it was how normal people felt every day.
All the times he'd coped with Afghanistan, he was coping only with loss. Sure, he was friends with many people who died, but none of them were Sherlock Holmes. As much as he convinced himself he was coping well enough with that loss, he still reached a point where pretending to function at work everyday became far too exhausting. How the hell could he be concerned with yearly physicals and prescriptions for antibiotics and flu vaccines when there was constantly a crushing weight on his shoulders of everything he'd been through?
“You're not a drug. Not literally, anyway. Besides, it's a risk I'm willing to take.”
this was.
John paused, trying to come up with a way to prove it. But he couldn't find his phone to text Sherlock, and any other method of proof available in this flat would likely complicate the situation further.
"All of it."
"John?"
“It's a piece of Romantic music, Brahms.”
“Why do you wear your gloves with this one?”
“I can't lose him again. I've already lost him once, and I barely survived it. I can't do it again.”
“Are you sure about this, John?”
“It doesn't matter what you see, or don't see, in my work.” Sherlock paced, feeling a bit more crazed than he would have liked.
me things instead of expecting me to just figure it out."
“You’re allowed to have time off, Sherlock. They can cope without you.”
“I’ve lost my appetite for anything happening at this table, or after it.”
“You’re early,” she purred as John set foot into the large hotel room and closed the door behind. The smell of lilac and leather crept into his nostrils. The silhouette stood before him, whip down at her side. “That usually means anticipation for what’s about to happen or more time for negotiation. Either reason increases my fee.”
that they were both wearing ways too much clothing.
He pulled both his jumper and undershirt off in one solid motion. Then the sound of metal softly clinking filled the room as he ripped off his belt and, shortly after that, his trousers and pants. He left the freshly knitted socks on, only because it made Sherlock smirk. Then, with desire burning a hole through his stomach, he reached for Sherlock's clothes. He did all the work, only needing Sherlock to lift his hips off the sofa long enough for him to yank his trousers and pants down to his knees.
The deluge of debauchery has begun once more. At least four nights this week, John has rushed out of the flat come nightfall, only stopping to mutter a “Don’t wait up!”. I never see him for the rest of the evening, except for the crash of him bringing a partner home and the creaks and moans of his late-night activities. The next time he emerges is the morning, with hair tousled and a satisfied smirk on his lips.
John isn’t sure how to absorb what Sherlock has revealed. The gesture is nearly too altruistic and at odds with what he has come to terms with the
The spectre sways as if in a gentle breeze. The haze of whatever is left within those darkened eye sockets flash a muddled version of Irene’s piercing blue, before Sherlock hears a whisper that is being created by a mouth that no longer has proper lips.
Sherlock shifts the belt around to show a small rounded ball near the middle and almost laughs out loud again at how John’s face becomes a brilliant shade of scarlet.
“He had the audacity to spout out his inane theory about the case,” Sherlock spat out. “As if I needed any assistance that has his fingerprints all over it.”
To watch Sherlock's muscles move with every thrust was a sight beyond anything John had yet imagined. Under those well-tailored trousers and tight shirt, he'd been hiding a lithe and powerful body, which gave John a brilliant idea. Without warning, he used his legs to push Sherlock away from him. And though he instantly missed Sherlock's cock inside him, he needed to have his legs under him in order to execute his plan.
Sherlock fought to keep his face straight; unwilling to let the hurt slip through his carefully built mask. His Sherlock. John made him sound like a pet — or worse, some lingering presence that he couldn’t wait to get rid of. Had he missed something? Were they not calling each other partners any more?
John looks up into Sherlock’s face as his heart catches up with his breathing. From all sides of the flat there are images of him in every painting style known to man, and yet all he can do is try and fail to wrap his head around the very notion that Sherlock wanted to create every last one of them. Because he thinks that John is lovely.
“I would really like that.” John said, giving Sherlock’s hand a gentle squeeze. “We can figure it out together, yeah?”
Present tense. God damn it, why the hell had he used present tense?
With a smirk, Sherlock points to one of the pages. There is a small list of numbered tasks and he watches as John’s smile falters.
All of a sudden, his body melts, and before he can think about it, Sherlock slides out of his chair, kneeling at John’s feet. He places his hands on either of the armrests, leaning forward slightly, scanning John’s face. John’s lips part slightly, his pupils dilate, and when Sherlock brushes a finger over his wrists, his pulse has quickened. There’s no lie here.
The man who followed her in was older and struck a much more fatherly figure. He had laugh lines that were well worn with age and hair the colour of freshly fallen snow. He could have been the age of John’s father if he hadn’t taken that bottle of bourbon night after night over the last couple of decades. So, splendid. John was trapped in a room with uniformed embodiments of a past he’d been escaping in various degrees. The conflicted army days. The pressures of consistent heterosexuality. The ghost of a parent whom John would never be able to make proud.
"I thought that I dreamt that," Sherlock whispered, taken aback. A shiver ran down his spine at John's words. His arms wrapped around John and held him tightly as he could.
Followed up by a cheer as the doctor threw the still sealed up envelope back in the face of Mycroft Holmes.
“But we’re not dating this time,” Sherlock quickly answers. “And even if we were, my brother feeds off the self-guilt and insecurities of others. He’s in the government for a reason, John. Whatever he said to you, don’t play into his mind games.”
that should be doing a fuck of a lot of explaining.”
Maybe she could tell him more about their
John glares as the taxi driver pulls up to The Honey Pot, but he gets out with me. I give a small smile to a few of the folks waiting in line, and they return subtle nods. I tug gently at John’s arm and he follows me, his tight black t-shirt clearly the source of quite a few whistles and smiles.
Jesus Christ, he is still so in love, and fuck Mycroft for putting a spotlight on it.
"Maybe that's why the sex is so good, or maybe," John's voice was temporarily muffled by his shirt as he lifted it over his head, "we're just meant for each other."
There was a tweet about how @FuriousForensic would like to kill anyone who woke him up before ten am that made John chuckle. He was more of a morning person himself but had adapted due to the nature of his job. He replied with a gif of some Disney princess drinking from an endless vat of coffee, then went on to the obits.
(See the end of the chapter for
John wakes up, and his eyes immediately flutter closed again. The sun streaming from his window helps him recall that he did indeed make it back to his room after last night. His exhaustion ripples through all of his limbs as he stretches, yawns and reaches over to the bedside table to grab his phone. With a press of a button, he sighs with relief that it’s barely past 9:00am, then drops his mobile back in its place on the nightstand.
There was an answer. There was always an answer about how to quiet his mind, and it was currently clutched in his hand, hidden within the depths of his pocket. Just one hit. One dose, carefully controlled, then he could solve the case and go back to John. Because as much as the man frustrated him, as much as he wanted to pry John Watson out of his mind, he wouldn’t. He couldn’t. John had become a part of him, as integral as the cases and deductions, something he couldn’t live without. So, if he couldn’t focus with him, but couldn’t live without, then this was the only way.
“Oh, no. I’m, um — I do locum work now. Y’know. As a GP. My hands—” He trailed off, holding out his non-existent tremor. Sherlock knows that’s not why John doesn’t do surgery anymore, but he bites his tongue. Who was this woman? Why was John lying to her?
“It’s exhausting sometimes," Sherlock continues. "I can deduce when something’s wrong, but I can’t read your mind. You actually have to talk to me sometimes.”
"Ah, apparently he found a gun," Mycroft said in an infuriatingly casual tone. "You may want to see to that, Gregory."
Chapter two makes an appearance! Thank you so much for your comments so far. They are fueling me more than you know. Again, a huge thank you to WritingOutLoud for their beta reading assistance.
indeed.
“Didn’t you solve that weeks ago?” Lestrade chimes in, but his face slowly drops at the glare Sherlock is giving him. The DI finally seems to notice the art-based carnage around him, and his eyebrows lift to his hairline. “Ah. Well. I’ll — I’ll meet you at the crime scene. I’ve texted it to you both.”
“But I don’t understand. I re-assessed, I’m not wrong but--”
them they were after.
“Nearly there,” John chokes out, his hand between their bellies as he strokes hard and fast and
“What?” John says as he turns, but there’s a wide grin on his face.
For the next twenty minutes, John described Mary to the best of his ability how she went from cheery and pleasant to obsessive. Then angry, when John slept with another nurse. In very basic terms, he told Greg how their last case for Mycroft had ended in betrayal, how he'd thought her dead. Then he passed on Sherlock's insight regarding how Sherlock thought this was all some sick and twisted premeditated string of events to draw John out.
“You’re in your mind palace early today.”
Harry’s mouth makes an almost perfect
“I have the address,” John said quickly. “We can get there in twenty minutes if we get ready now.” A pause. “Okay, see you there, Greg.”
Sherlock gives a small cough and rolls his shoulders, trying to relax his now tense shoulders. This is John; he’s safe here.
That’s what Sherlock called her, and John hated the fact that she was given a title at all - let alone one with such a formidable hue. Now with close to two and a half years removed from when Sherlock deduced that the final problem would begin with a phone call and end with a fall, John realized that it wasn’t hate that fueled his fury towards her. It was something bone-deep that scorched jealousy marks on everything that it touched, and John was just another victim.
The next time Sherlock had noticed John’s scent was after they’d chased the American Tourist through London, unknowingly letting the real murderer get away in the process. When they’d stumbled through the door, giggling, Sherlock had caught a whiff of a rich, earthy smell. John’s sweat. It wasn’t unpleasant, and Sherlock knew that he probably smelled the same way, despite the heavy-duty deodorant he’d become accustomed to wearing during cases. Yet, there was something about it that drew him in. He paused. He deliberately catalogued it.
“Do you make afternoon tea for just any girl?” Molly can feel her face burning red, but she clenches her stomach and forces herself to look Irene in the eye. Irene gives a sly smile, placing her plate on the table and turning her body to face Molly.
Sherlock can sense his entire body tightening up, but he makes himself relax. Her tricks and wit are both on full display, and he doesn’t need any of whatever this is. He wants to escape, and feels as if he can’t catch his breath.
Sherlock could practically hear the blush creeping up John’s neck. Scuffs on the floor indicated John had shuffled his feet, a particular nervous habit of his.
Irene places the hourglass on the coffee table, gently flicking the glass with her nail as she continues to walk past. The ringing echoes through the room as she approaches the dresser on the far wall, opening the first drawer and reaching for something inside. Sherlock strains his neck to see, to no avail.
John opens his mouth to make an excuse for Sherlock’s absence. That he was in the middle of a murder investigation, and John was ultimately fine and just being kept for observation. However, before John can manage to say anything else, Sherlock takes hold of John’s hand with his own and gives them a gentle squeeze. John patiently waits for Sherlock to speak, pushing down the anxieties growing inside. They may be making an effort to communicate, but that doesn’t make it easy. Sherlock lets out a deep sigh and turns to face the ceiling, as if remembering some important information.
“So, to what pleasure do I owe this visit?” she asked, her voice silkened at the edges. “You rarely ever go anywhere without a motive.”
asleep, all throughout the night since they had moved into 221B. When John was with Mary in their shared house in the suburbs, their little girl had never slept through the night without making one of them get up and gently talk her back into going to sleep.
"It’s my will," John says, and unfolds it.
Like the captain of the rugby team, who happened to be dickhead Mr Halesworth’s son. Olly Halesworth was without a doubt, a carbon copy of his father in meanness and power but not in the sense of ambitions - Olly’s doing PE, Geography and Drama for his A-Levels. His drills make John want death each time he completes them - that’s not how you motivate a team, that’s how you make them despise you. It’s clear that Olly knows little about actual leadership and teamwork, just how to look good and play well (albeit not fair). The headteacher had some influence in him being Captain (personally, John thinks it should be Lestrade even though he’s slightly biased). Lestrade, after all, didn’t have his father at the school. Greg didn’t even have a dad, but he was still a much nicer leader than Olly. Their drills had been exceptionally less painful when Olly was ill and Greg took over that one time in October.
"No, I assumed Mycroft had it sorted." Trust Sherlock to make his government official brother do all his personal legal work. Maybe Mycroft has hired him a secret PA that he doesn’t actually know about, and just assumes Mycroft himself does all the work.
John had contacted a lawyer he’d known from working on Sherlock’s cases, a guy who seemed less of a prick than normal and had occasionally dallied down to the pub, although they hadn’t really had any heart to hearts. Just a wave from across the room would do it.
It was bizarre, how she fell asleep, and
Sherlock was back, and there had been no time to update the will to include him in it.
Mostly, he attempts to sneak in quietly and manages it, but John sometimes doesn’t want to disturb her and her peaceful dreaming, and so attempts to kip on the sofa. Like tonight. But he never ends up on the sofa, because Sherlock will notice as he comes and gets a glass of water from the kitchen and rub a hand against his shoulder gently just as he’s falling asleep.
A man by the name of Mike Stamford had approached him when he was entering the building, a kindly chap who had just wanted to talk. In this time, Sherlock had disclosed that he was looking for a flat mate, male, and was certain that Stamford would be returning later in the day. Hopefully the flat mate would be nice - Mycroft had been an awful person to live with, he wanted the person he was going to share his new flat, 221B Baker Street, to be the complete opposite of his brother.
"You take Sherlock back home." She kisses his forehead, as though the goodbye is meaningful, and whispers, "talk to him," into his hair, as though Sherlock wouldn’t be able to hear. Or at least wouldn’t be able to deduce it. But he can.
Why was he bothering to think about rugby? There was no point, anyways. It wouldn’t be on...well for months if John’s mum was right in assuming so. Quarantined, with his family, with no rugby, no friends and constant school Zoom calls. Great. Just fucking perfect.
And then there is audible quiet as Mr Halesworth clicks away and sends an email with the zoom link. John desperately wishes, suddenly, he had a proper friend in this class he could be texting to moan about all the shit happening. But no - there’s just Mike and his beaming smile of nothingness. He’s too nice, and you can’t text someone who is too nice because they’ll never talk any shit about anything. Even Mr Halesworth. Even Olly Halesworth, who is the biggest piece of shit ever.
"What if it doesn't? What if I meet him when I'm dying? What if I meet him when he's dying?"
So maybe he doesn’t have much to weep about in terms of quarantine. His A-Levels have not been cancelled - that’s the Year 13s, and neither have his GCSEs, but he feels stuck in the middle, as though his year fits in the void somehow. And they’re going to have to teach themselves the A-Level content if the school doesn’t shape up and commit to teaching online. Right now all they have is a slightly pathetic homework uploading system, where the teachers put work on and most people ignore it.
"What's so funny?"
He’d known that Sherlock was fully committed to loving them, and would not be one for loving them halfway. John had moved in with him before he knew anything about the genius, and he’d moved in now because he loved Sherlock Holmes, Twitter obsession and all.
"We got along so well, right from the beginning. And I was a wreck when you...left, even though I hadn’t known you that long." John nods, certain. "Definitely soulmates."
He was lucky, he told himself, calmly. Lucky that he had a family to take care of him (okay that wasn’t working), lucky that he had a home at all, lucky that he didn’t have the virus, didn’t know anyone who had died from the virus. John Watson was lucky.
And he’d just been accepted into the rugby team, as if things couldn’t get any more ironic. Damn Boris for wanting to protect the country from a deadly virus. Damn him.
"What is?" Sherlock was puzzled.
When John’s carrying on with his tangent, looking away from Sherlock, he surreptitiously takes the dog tags off his chest and places them in his blazer pocket, ready to return later. The blazer comes off too, until it’s just his shirt.
"Sherlock, we all have the same problem! We can't all just 'find' the one when we want to. It will happen."
The weekend is painful. His mum stocks up on food (the shops, he’s told, are chaotic). John himself is shut up in his room to prevent contact with his less amenable parent, and only comes out for occasional snacks and to greet Harry when she arrives (Clara-less) late Saturday evening. As he is stuck only with the comfort of his phone and Netflix, he binge watches a show he watched first when he was 11 and reflects on Friday, which was his last day at school for the foreseeable future.
"Well, you
"So let me get this straight," Sherlock let go of John's hand and placed his own two hands on Lestrade's shoulders, "Your soulmate is my brother?"
"I know someone who's been looking desperately for a Greg recently," he started to walk out of the room.
"Well, you should check with him," John says, and Sherlock rolls his eyes in despair. Still a child, even if he does have his fatherly tendencies.
Sherlock's world stopped. John Watson. John. John. This was his soulmate, surely.
Clearly Rosie computes this knowledge as well because she turns to John and says, "Daddy, do you think Uncle My and Uncle Greg should get together?" John coughs, and then stares at Greg fretting over him. "Yes, I...I think it would be good for both of their sanities."
"Well, we’re not lovers." Sherlock snorts.
Sherlock glanced at his wrist once again, out of habit. The name there had been etched onto his skin since birth, the name that would haunt him forever, the name of his soulmate.
So no.
The day after that, Mycroft is kidnapped. It’s out of the blue, but he seems to have a walkie talkie on him and is using it to communicate back to them.
"Keep it," Sherlock waves a hand, pointing at the door. "Mycroft has spares, I’ve got a new one. New chapter, so to speak."
He shuddered, thinking it through. Being in that year? With all the druggies and not having done his GCSEs and still having to do work? Nah, he’d rather not. They could smoke all the weed they wanted, he’d be a doctor if it was the last thing he could do on this planet before saying Adios to it.
"And...." Sherlock drawls. There’s one more. One big one.
Well, Sherlock reflects deep down. There’s only one real answer isn’t there? He’s not interested. John doesn’t want to have a relationship with him, even if he is bi. Sherlock is simply not his type, or...or, he’s lived with him long enough to discount Sherlock as a potential suitor, or he doesn’t want to date a man long term.
Sherlock grasped the concept that John really didn’t understand what he’d been doing. "John."
John is in Year 12: a fresh new batch of A-Level students at age 16 and 17. John is 16 (he despises the fact that he will be so until mid-August, for he hates being the young one). He was close to being put into the younger year but he just scraped past. Anyway, he’s glad he was. He’s got Lestrade and other mates in this year, a solid rugby team and is surprisingly intelligent all considering.
"You’ll mess up your neck and back sleeping there," Sherlock reminds him, as he does every time when he sleeps here, on the sofa.
It takes all of five minutes before he’s interrupted, but not how John expects it to happen.
And he’ll never have to be again.
"Oh I agree, but let's continue the facade of hating it....oh god I can't watch that how am I ever going to get used to that?" Sherlock's face was disgusted as he watched 'Mystrade' kiss.
"My name. And there is a body in St Barts you can take a look at, ask Miss Hooper, he's 51, name's Julian. He took a bad hit to the head from his wife, Jane, and it killed him."
And Lestrade would smirk and walk up to Mycroft, and say, "I don't know about you, but I find that amazing."
"And you decide to drop that bomb now? That your soulmate's name is Mycroft? Not, I don't know, when you first met me? I asked you if you had met a John, you looked around and couldn't find John Watson so obviously you didn't find my soulmate, and the whole time you knew me, you could have said the words, "Mycroft is the name of my soulmate?" And I would, after laughing my head off and then feeling slightly sympathetic for you, actually arrange a meeting between the two of you?" Sherlock asked, incredulous.
John doesn’t need to know the details now, and no way is Sherlock up to explaining them to him in any level of accuracy that John deserves for the disappearance. The death, the grief, the pain, the hurt. His scars don’t forgive that - will never forgive it. They just help give him reason.
It would’ve been nice if he could’ve believed it.
"God, John. It’s okay if you want to move out but please just- just don’t leave me."
And then the boy comes back on screen, and he himself seems to be plucking his feathers in annoyance at Mr Halesworth’s rebuttal. “It’s wrong. The benzene ring is too wide in electrophic substitutions mechanisms. The ring should be ⅔ of the diameter long, how could you even make that kind of mistake? Aren’t you supposed to be a chemistry teacher?”
The next day awaits yet another question for John. It seems Rosie is That Phase. This time, Sherlock is prepping dinner for them (pasta) and John is finding something for Rosie to watch on TV.
It’s late, though, for them, and a father knows this ritual well. If he goes and settles into their shared room, Rosie will wake and struggle to return to slumber for at least an hour.
Now John stares at him, clearly thinking he should also be committed to psychiatric ward. "What’s Bastardian?" John is clearly ready to receive some kind of long insulting tirade of how idiotic he is that he wouldn’t know the concept of Bastardian, but it is something that only he and Mycroft share knowledge of, so that wouldn’t apply.
But his anger filtered out as Sherlock stared at the floor, unsure of what to retort with. Well. He’d calculated 13 responses to that statement but none of them would be constructive or contribute to the already confusing conversation.
"Hey kiddo. What’s on your mind today?" "Why don’t you kiss Sherlock like Uncle Greg and Mycroft?" Sherlock winced. Thinking of Graham and Mycroft kissing was painful at the worst of times. Luckily he had a sink nearby if he felt the desperate urge to vomit.
Then Sherlock had died, and John had contemplated it. Death - and therefore the will had been removed, never updated, just staring at it. Thinking about it. There was no changes to make to it, necessarily, although he’d probably do a donation to charity instead of gifting all the money to Harry in assurance that it would go to waste.
It started with a bottle of whiskey and two shot glasses, as many things did.
"I love you," he blurts when they separate.
"Ah, yes, your Detective Inspector friend," Mycroft paused, "Are you sure he isn't John?"
"Gavin," Sherlock interjects mindlessly. It’s an instinct, now. Rosie will get terribly confused if he continues to alter his name in her mind.
He’s correct on that front. Sherlock is 100% sure that John is his soulmate, if such a fantasy exists. There’s simply no other worthy candidate. "
Mycroft nodded. "To not just see, but to observe."
John took a breath and ran his hand through his still damp hair. It stuck up at all angles, but he didn't have it in him to care.
“That hardly needs a toast,” Sherlock smirked. “Instead, I toast to our ever-growing partnership.”
smooth," Mycroft said, sounding very put out. "But my brother has never been normal about anything."
“And you don’t have to, Sherlock. Asexuality is a spectrum, not a category. Everyone’s different, and that’s okay. But you can want closeness and romantic intimacy without wanting sex. Asexuality and aromanticism are not intrinsically tied, perhaps you are more alloromantic that you previously thought.”
“It’ll match our best lead then,” Sherlock grunted back, but he still picked up the tea and took a few sips before looking back at the photos of the Jacob Nelson crime scene. Sherlock’s eyes widened at the photo John’s elbow was rested next to.
“You were at most slightly tipsy,” Sherlock corrects, and he ensures that his grip around John’s waist is tight just in case he decides to make a break for the front door of the shop. John may have shorter legs, but he’s quick when he has a motive to be. “And you’re worrying too much about it, John.”
Sherlock can feel his brow furrowing in confusion, and he never has liked that sensation —
"DI Lestrade has my overnight bag," John said once he'd straightened back out and was closing Sherlock's door. "Any chance we can get that delivered to Baker Street?"
Sherlock began to search through his mind palace for the names that were mentioned in the tweet. H. Pillet didn’t ring any bells but the name Bushe certainly did. Lestrade had been upset about his death for quite a while, but there was no concrete evidence to lead to a real investigation.
Panic was setting in, and Sherlock shifted up to meet John’s gaze. Eye contact. Openness. John liked that. He needed John to be happy again. Pleased with him.
“That isn’t fair…” John settled on, his face very tense. “This is all new and—“
“Isn’t it obvious?” She turns and walks away from him, and the purple shirt has begun to hang off her now, waving ever so slightly as she moves. “You have to really want it.”
“No.”
about you,” John whispers. The context of the words feel somewhat familiar, and Sherlock races through the files of his mind to link them to a previous conversation. Then, there it is. Mary. John’s talk about Mary and her questions about all of John’s sexual past. “And I told her...she knows.”
She was a doctor, and a good one. She was a friend, and a great one. That’s why when John Watson called her out of the blue to invite her to lunch, she said
Two drinks later, John is slightly closer to Sherlock’s seat. His bright blue eyes flick from the small stack of papers now on the wooden table to Sherlock, busy looking at his own, private notes once more.
It had been a simpler thing when Mycroft’s people had abducted him in broad daylight and dropped him off in a seedy warehouse. There had been a less personal ambience to it all; the lines in the sand much more straightforward. The fact that the elder Holmes had found the audacity to set up an appointment at John’s surgery with the direct purpose to tell John to leave Sherlock alone was bad enough, but it was made worse by the weighty realisation that as much as John tried to fight, Mycroft did indeed have valid points.
Before that kiss, John thought he knew what pleasure was. He'd enjoyed countless romps with various partners, walked away (or watched them walk away) satisfied. But this kiss brought pleasure to a whole new plane of existence. Sherlock's lips somehow tingled against his, the connection electric and terrifying in all its glory.
Mary waited for John to come back to himself. Her eyes glassy with tears that seemed to be not falling only by her own sheer iron will. Gravity be damned if she would cry anymore over someone who was never hers in the first place. She could live with being second best. To be dwarfed in the shadow of a ghost whose eyes lit up the starry sky and whose voice still called out to John beyond the grave.
John rolls his eyes playfully at Sarah as he grabs the chart from the wall outside the room and heads inside. His shock at who is sitting in the chair beside the examination table is such a punch to the gut that John is amazed he’s still standing.
Sherlock tugged at the bottom of John’s jumper until he got the hint and quickly pulled it over his head. The sight of John's naked chest was enough to stall Sherlock's inner monologue for the moment. In its place there laid a simmering need to get John to a bed. John's bed. His own bed. It hardly mattered right now.
John motions an index finger at the man in the photo.
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders, but John pointedly ignores him. Instead, he strides over and picks up a pair of blue, purple and pink socks, then grabs a small flag sticker on the shelf right above it.
John started to turn towards the fridge, but he stopped suddenly after only a single step. He turned around with a curious look on his face and stared down at Sherlock as if he were trying to dissect a bomb.
John doesn’t begin to know how to answer that, but he quickly searches his brain for references.
“Not interested in what you have to offer.”
That was enough, and the power of the realisation quaked Sherlock onto the precipice of tears. He shuddered into John’s stilled form as the comprehension of his emotions settled into the empty spaces on the mattress, and thank God John wasn’t awake to witness this weakness. Sherlock flaunted his intrinsic expertise to deduce all of the data into inevitable conclusions, and yet here in the dozy caress of a wounded army doctor, the confirmation blindsided him.
“Why can’t I hear John anymore?”
“I’ve been waiting, I didn’t want to shock you…”
Greg ducked his head as a chair went sailing through the air and hit the far end wall. Sherlock's voice was roaring out several expletives, and some were not in English.
Sherlock snorts out a laugh. “So, a point to me already?”
John plucks the mobile out of his sister’s hand and is greeted by a much clearer photo of the very same man from the night before. He is wearing a crisp white button-down, dark trousers, and a Belstaff coat that probably cost more than three months' rent at John’s horrible bedsit.
John’s chuckle turns into another gasp as Sherlock opens his mouth wider and sucks the delicate skin of his sac. The steady pressure is already getting John so hard that he almost feels dizzy.
I pull him into my bedroom, and as soon as the door closes, John is all over me. My back hits the smooth wood behind me and his hands are on either side of my head, pinning me into the closed door. His lips are parted, panting slightly, and he leans forward, hovering centimetres above my lips. I whine, wanting him to close the distance, to take me like I’m one of his late-night conquests. My hands find his waist and slide up his back, relishing the feel of lean muscle beneath.
“Common, yet powerful in its own special way. Much like other substances of the world. Air. Soil. Fear.”
He gasps as I place his hand on my crotch, and give him what I hope comes off as a sultry look.
“Then let me go,” Sherlock screams, his hands flying towards the morgue door and twisting hopelessly at the doorknob. His hands are slippery with sweat as the knob spins round and round but refuses to open.
“Sherlock,” John growls again. The edge of warning there, but Sherlock savors dancing on the edge too much to not draw this out a tiny bit more. He flicks his tongue in a series of angles and loops that have John twitching like mad. “Want you.
” The cracking is getting louder now, echoing against the inside of his skull like a migraine. His ribs have begun to ache in his chest, and the numbing cold is returning, sending waves of shivers through his body. His teeth rattle against each other as he brings his hands to his ears, trying to block out the steady
The memories of it all felt faded like photos left out in the sun. The edges muted into warm shades of sepia tone, and somehow this made Sherlock look softer and more approachable. The coolness of his presence easier to swallow when recollections floated in and out of the last half a year.
"I'm a former military who had the misfortune of having to report to Mycroft Holmes if you catch my drift," John said after he'd gotten up, ordered them both a pint, and returned to the table. Most of my record is locked up to anyone other than someone of Mycroft's clearance or higher because most of what I did was intel gathering or… morally ambiguous. Does the name Greville Wynne mean anything to you?"
“No,” Lestrade says quickly, and John hears the squeak of an ancient mattress as Greg appears to be getting out of his bed. “I’m fine for a night out. Been ages since I did anything after nightfall not connected with work. Which pub are you heading to?”
Sherlock hissed out a breath through clenched teeth before taking John's lips again. His tongue licked at all of the guttural moans that tried to tear themselves out of John's wettened mouth, and Sherlock gulped down them all.
“Lestrade is on holiday with Molly,” Sherlock answered. “It’s most likely Mycroft. I pulled down the camera he’d hidden in the hallway yesterday.”
“You’re making all sorts of faces,” Harry mutters, before dropping a large mug of coffee next to the burnt toast. “Want me to chuck it in the bin?”
“Right...screaming happens regardless, but a man can dream can’t he, John?”
Eventually, Sherlock gets back with what looks like half the files of Scotland Yard. The giant boxes of paperwork from the Michael Pierce case quickly begin to overpower the living room, joining the rest of the boxes they had yet to return. Sherlock settles himself in the centre of them, his dressing gown draping across the floor as he pulls out file after file and mutters to himself. John stays out of the way and bides his time. He’s had enough rows with a severely concentrating Sherlock to know not to throw in a comment unrelated to whatever Sherlock is focused on.
own guide. The woman who was able to make the great Sherlock Holmes second guess everything he thought he understood.”
“I’ll grab us a couple of seats?” John whispers loudly into Sherlock’s ear. “Whatever you get at the bar is fine by me.”
I think, therefore, I am. All of this, Irene, the morgue, his mind palace — this is all just neurotransmitters being released in his brain. Something is registering them; some portion of his brain is still alive. Maybe he can stop this. Maybe he can find a way back.
But tonight would be a different story indeed.
Sherlock tosses a blank stare at John as if he can just vanish these ludicrous wings with a snap of a finger. John chuckles.
“Damn right, I did.”
His eyes fluttered shut when Sherlock's lips ghosted over his ankles, and his voice faltered. This was what it was like to come undone bit by bit. It was terrifying and utterly perfect. He'd never had a partner pay so much attention to him. Typically it was just what he could do
John blinks a few times but fails to dislodge the visual of Sherlock Holmes in glistening nudity. No matter. A true soldier can still fight while dealing with distractions.
. Well, that just happened, and yet John is still in the same spot. He is regarding me as if I just belched out a show tune in the middle of a five-star dinner, but at least he is still here. That should count for something, I suppose.
One could describe he and Sherlock as lovers if not for the minor mishap that they simply weren’t like that physically. Or emotionally really, no matter how many hugs were enjoyed. Surprisingly the two British, stiff-upper-lip men had become quite accustomed to the occasional hug. It hadn’t been an outcome that he’d expected but was one that John eventually learned to appreciate, when Sherlock reached out, arms wide, no words needed.
That was all it took - just a kidnapping. If Sherlock had known that, he would’ve kidnapped Mycroft ages ago, sped this whole thing up so there was no need to deduce them with their unrequited feelings. He suspected that was how Mycroft saw him.
Yes, one could describe himself and Sherlock as lovers. Both of them loved each other deeply, dearly, and would do anything for each other and to protect Rosie. John would, and had, shot men for him in the past. Sherlock in turn had nearly died. So many times, and in so many ways. (For John, but that was left unsaid).
He’s still unfairly handsome, but in that adorable morning way where he remains slightly dazed, his curls frizzy from friction and eyes thick with sleep. It makes John love him even more. Rosie, blissfully, seems to still be asleep and he’s in no hurry to move from this position.
John turned to Sherlock and said, "I don't know why we complain. Johnlock is the best thing that ever could have happened to me."
He gets a text from Greg whilst he’s eating his cereal. Well, actually he reads the text during his breakfast. Greg sent it at about 2am. His idea of a sleep schedule during quarantine has essentially gone to hell. John, who typically stays up late, has somewhat retained his routine. Otherwise he’d just sleep through his alarm and the loud noise...well, loud noises weren’t typically welcomed in his house.
Yes, documents, documents. He should give Mycroft a call in the morning, delight him with some paperwork to do. He’s fairly sure Uncle Myc wouldn’t mind if he was legitimately made Rosie’s uncle. Thinking on it, he’d probably had Sherlock’s adoption papers ready for months now.
, and everything in between.
They sat in front of the fire, on the cold winter’s day, and chatted and laughed and talked. It was - lovely, John had realised, to be back here. Watching Sherlock fill out as they both ate three meals a day - although the Bastard could eat chips for every meal and never gain more than an ounce of fat somehow. To watch them start taking care of each other and Rosie. It was far better for his mental health than it was to pootle around that flat that had Mary written all over it, even though she was gone.
He sat in the lab again, examining a chemical compound because the boredom was taking over and he didn't want to have to start shooting the wall in Mycroft's house yet.
Oh the ramifications of this - Harry would have to come home from University - probably with Clara, as well, her girlfriend which would go down so well with their dad. Dad. Dad would be here, the whole time, constantly. In the house, where they couldn’t escape him. And he’d be trapped where no one could come and save him from this wretched home which was actually just the same as the last one. Broken.
"Just a few things. Er...your scarf, for one thing. And the cushion from my chair." That explains why John keeps shifting uncomfortably.
"Your coat. It’s at my place. I’ll have to bring it back to you-" John looks vulnerable, as though it was something he’d prefer to avoid. The look on his face was twisting the cold dagger further into his heart so Sherlock blurted out:
"I like girls and boys," John smiles at his daughter, who seems unfazed, and this time Sherlock does drop a plate. Luckily, it’s in the sink, and he quickly manages to cover it up by claiming he wasn’t holding it right, not because of the sudden surprise about John’s sexuality.
Mystrade Bonus:
Sherlock’s been mentally packing John’s bags in the palace, so this causes a total brain shutdown in order to return things to where they belong. Especially when Sherlock repeats the same sentiment back to him and their faces collide for another embrace. So he mentally drops everything in John’s wing which is rapidly expanding as he gains information from the kiss, and the
"Do you know how many John's there are, Mycroft?" Sherlock said in exasperation.
John scoffs and nods silently along as he reads the text, composing a quick agreement text and sends it, realises he made an error and quickly correcting it with an asterisk. Fucking autocorrect.
Sherlock had simply finished his tea and continued to compose his music until they found the abandoned warehouse Mycroft was being housed in. He’d brought the companion to the walkie talkie that Mycroft had had embedded into his breast pocket which held the family crest somehow, and could hear everything he was saying.
Sherlock, on the other hand, puts it away in chaos. Glasses on the bottom drawer, plates askew, knives and forks messed up and upside down and hell, why not. He’s a scientist, sure, but a messy one. And it’s a dishwasher, not a pastry competition. Nothing had to be that neat. But he’s putting it all away, even though it’s John’s, because he feels nice, and John has had a long day at work. And it’s easy to pick up the knives and forks in their clearly laid out way.
John was listening to the walkie talkie, Rosie standing by his side. She was well engaged in a small book Sherlock carried in his coat in case situations like this arose. John had just picked her up from school, which is why they hadn’t got Mrs Hudson to babysit. Normally that would be the routine, on cases.
And Sherlock thinks of James Sholto, the man John was so desperate to see at his wedding. The man who showed him and Mary that
Our school prides itself in being worthy and exceptional at educating all of our students no matter whether in school or learning from place of residence. It is for that reason we have decided to set up learning via Zoom, with live action of the teacher so it is just like in class….
John’s mouth is touching the ground, it’s so wide.
Domestic bliss. Sherlock would never admit to calling it that, especially not to Mycroft, but it’s true. John, back at the flat, back
"Well, hopefully," John’s breath hitches and he stands up. "Dating my soulmate."
It’s not directed at him, he can infer from her glance to John, before she goes back to playing with her Legos. John hesitates and Sherlock attempts not to feel wounded. "Yes, yes, I like Sherlock."
But soon the yawning begins to creep in, and John pads over to the kitchen to turn off some of the lights, knowing Sherlock won’t protest. His sleep schedule too, has been regulated more.
"Daddy, who do you like?" Sherlock barely notices as Rosie says it. The question is directed at John, who is ironing on the decrepit but well-used board with floral print. Sherlock is allowed to sit smugly this week, feet resting on the coffee table even through it’s ‘unseemly’ and ‘bad influence for Rosie’. It’s his turn, next wash, however, and John will be able to gloat by reading the newspaper whilst he grumbles over the crumpled shirts.
As though Rosie knew this place, this flat, was truly her home.
that he normally echoed. It wasn’t worth it anymore, denying it. They’d both used swishy signatures, although John didn’t own a pen that was quite as fancy as the one he had, and then that was that.
"Detective Inspector." Mycroft called out to the man. The tired man stopped and said, "I won't be taking any questions, thanks."
Sherlock’s mouth is agape yet he still remains speechless, attempting and failing to process this information, this data John is spewling at him like he’s not going to ever stop.
"John." Sherlock repeats, closing his eyes. There’s only one way for John to fully understand, fully comprehend what he was doing and why.
He blinks and waits for the sarcastic remarks about them not being a couple and "whatever will people think" but nothing comes but spluttering as he undoes the first button. John is staring at him intensely now and he’s not sure how much this has become a strip tease.
Dear Class of Year 12,
Ah yes, quarantine, the very bane of John’s existence.
Not that he’d be opposed to getting married to John. Hell, he’s pictured it in his mind palace for years, a forbidden fantasy he’ll never be able to actually have. He’s planned it down to the flowers, venue and guest list. If it was his way, there would be a murder, somehow, but that would be rather difficult to arrange.
THURSDAY
Granted, it was never quite the same. Starting again. None of the same scents as before. He’d have to get it used to London again, but then, he’d also have to acquiesce himself with London again. Sherlock had been away from home for far too long. Away from John for too long.
Sherlock is fairly sure that when Greg and John take a trip down to the pub, much of the complaining is about the Holmes brothers instead of the latest failures of a supported football team. Greg gets to complain about how Mycroft is so smart but so oblivious and John gets to complain about all of the experiments Sherlock does and other annoying habits of his. Frankly, he’d really rather not know what happens down at the pub and wishes to delete it from the mind palace but somehow it finds its way back in every time John emerges into 221B looking slightly guilty from his exploits. He will then nurse a painful headache, the next day, which Sherlock has decided is his penance for clearly talking shit about him with Greg.
John.
But what did John’s opinion matter? He was new and didn’t have any sway with the team aside from his friends. Maybe if Olly got injured, then Greg could be Captain one day. Or even him….
“What do you mean, wrong?” Mr Halesworth’ tone is suprisingly flat, suggesting he’s used to this kind of behaviour.
Held out for Rosie to be born, and then Mary had died, and then Sherlock nearly died
Too many questions with so many variables to answer, so maybe it’s a good thing that Sherlock wakes up and puts his bony chin decisively on his chest to look up at John.
In ten years he might feel guilty for lying to her. But not now. Not when it’s all so fresh in his mind palace. Her shooting him, her jumping in front of a bullet for him. John grieving, like
"I can assure you," Sherlock said quietly, wishing for a glass of scotch to be in his fingers so he could sip out of it lazily. "Mycroft has been keeping a close eye. What else did you take?"
John Watson is army regimented, likes it all neat and tidy. The knives and forks lined up on the top tray so they are easy to grab, the spoons too. Plates of the same sizes shelved as though they have already been put away, and the same with glasses.
"Oh, so your brother, Molly, and 100 tramps!"
Sherlock remained silent and John took that as means to continue.
John didn’t like getting up at 8am, but he had to dredge himself out of his bed to get a bowl of cereal and look vaguely presentable before the first Zoom with the year 11s who definitely didn’t deserve to be there.
And rugby, oh, how John would miss that. He’d been the captain of the team at his last school because he was pretty decent at it and aggressive at times, but here he was the newbie and the runt of the group. They’d been getting closer, though, he thought, through their practises. Greg assured him they were thinking about asking him to hang out with them soon enough, but nope, because quarantine.
They take it in shifts, normally, because John is driven mad by how he packs the bloody thing.
"John and Greg have got it easy," Sherlock sulked, "A name like Sherlock or Mycroft is going to be obvious once they meet us."
"Come on, Graham, there has to be something."
His daughter. Sherlock had never clarified what he was to Rosie. He was obviously more than an uncle, because he was a constant presence in her life. But Sherlock had made her call him by his god given name, and put a stop to any pursuit into calling him a rendition of Father or Dad. He wasn’t John, and he isn’t John’s partner, never will be, so he doesn’t get to be dad. Or Papa, or Father, or any of that. Just “Sherlock."
Not just any Year 11, though. This boy is the epitome of beautiful - he’s like a Greek god in stature, alabaster skin contrasting with black (or is it very dark brown?) curls that he focuses on for a split second before going immediately to his Cupid bow lips - yes, John knows what Cupid’s bow lips look like, he’s read enough romance novels in his early teen years thank you very much.
As Sherlock readjusts in his chair to steeple his hands together metal scrapes across his chest. It’s not cold, because the chain has had a permanent residence on his clavicle for two years. Dog tags, John’s of course. They lay claim to Captain John Watson being in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and Sherlock clutched then whenever he felt a desperate need to float into his John wing.
"I do go out! I solve Lestrade's cases!"
stop crying, as though she knew her mum was dead. But then, he couldn’t have found another woman he only half loved to look after his child, and no-one would want him with all his baggage.
Why doesn’t John kiss Sherlock like Uncle Greg kisses Uncle Mycroft? Well, simple answer, Rosie. They do now.
SUNDAY
If Sherlock tells John about the dog tags then he’ll subconsciously have to know that it is basically a love confession. Neither of them is ready for that, a feat that only they can say. What, 4 years of knowing each other and they still can’t bloody talk about their feelings.
He made a few deductions about the body, sending them in a rather large text so he didn't have to go and see Lestrade again later.
, they really have slept in haven’t they? It’s lovely though, simply heaven.
"Mycroft Holmes. It's a pleasure." Mycroft pulled up his suit jacket to reveal his wrist. Greg Lestrade looked up at him in fear and he gradually started to smile.
"You'll have to, love. They aren't going anywhere, in fact it will probably just get worse and worse," John reminded him.
It was almost as weird and wonderful as he had left it. Except he’d been gone a long time, and even his neglect on cleaning wouldn’t develop to this standard.
But at the end of the day an email pinged through on his school account and he rolled over to look at his laptop, chewing slowly on a packet of crisps.
"But you don’t really like Sherlock," Rosie hits her father with a piercing look, almost a smirk. It’s an odd angle to see from a 6 year old. "Not like I like him." John starts on Sherlock’s signature purple shirt. He’s clearly perplexed with what Rosie means. Sometimes things she says doesn’t make the most sense, and even Sherlock is lost with this conversation, but trying to nod along to encourage her to continue with it. Maybe then they can understand, god help them.
In another life time perhaps. If there was no Mary. Maybe the companionship that once developed into friendship could have developed further into a relationship. Sherlock’s first proper relationship, because he couldn’t count drug-addled trysts as meaningful, not really. John’s companionship in that way would complete him as a human being.
His doctor places his head in a hand and murmurs, "Not a holiday."
"Monthly meals at a secret pub, all wearing disguises, perhaps? Or Mycroft just buying them off. Talking about what you were up to, you regaling them with stories of posh pretentious clients whilst you were in disguise."
“Sure.”
The migraine that John's kept at bay all day makes a return appearance.
Greg eventually intervenes, ordering them both into a taxi until they can ‘sort their shit out.’
Good. A question that John could easily answer.
“Since not long after the car accident.” John sucks in a breath. That was months ago. “The day that you left, I went...to put it mildly, somewhat mental. I was certain that it was shock at first. Felt like all the classic markers of it, anyway. I needed to talk to you. Convince you that what you thought about the spreadsheet was wrong but, upon reflection and playing back the incident through my mind palace, I could have easily come to the same theory. John...you were
“Once more, for me.”
It’s been exactly five weeks since John came out as bisexual. Five long, weird weeks. It isn’t that I’m not happy for him — on the contrary, I am delighted that John has finally come to terms with his identity, it’s just that — well, he will not stop having sex.
“Angelo’s? What are you—“
My hands are balled up into such tight fists that they hurt, and yet John is coming closer. His tentative steps are just what I need at the moment. I’m the only fully dressed person in the room, yet I feel so exposed.
“It was nothing,” she mutters, forcibly glancing anywhere but at Irene’s alluring face. “I’m sure that the cashier was...having a bad day, or maybe they just haven’t ever run across someone like us...or—“
Sherlock positioned himself so that he stood just out of John's reach and placed the scissors at the third button of his shirt, and slowly pressed down. The sound of smooth tearing of cotton through the room as Sherlock's shirt was completely cut through and fell off of his shoulders. Bare chested and pinkening in enticement, Sherlock opened the scissors just a little wider and put them at the top of his trousers. The thicker material was no match for the skill of the shears, and within seconds Sherlock was fully in the nude and showing off his blossomed arousal.
With a small chuckle, John is released from Sherlock’s embrace and looks around the shop with a little less wariness. His eyes linger on a few promising key chains before settling in on a tiny area filled with pride centric underclothing that include pants and very comfortable looking socks.
“It becomes almost endearing after a while.” That infernal shuffle again.
“Sherlock is an adult, as you seem to continuously forget. What we do is no one’s business but our own, and despite your needless concerns, we happen to be doing well this time around. So your meddling and threats are not welcomed, Mycroft.”
And that was it, that was all the warning he was able to give Sherlock before his thrusts became erratic, and he fell forward onto Sherlock's chest. His body was completely boneless. If he'd needed to escape from a burning fire, he wouldn't have been able to move even a single toe. He was undone, fully and completely, and only vaguely aware that Sherlock hadn't come yet.
The chapters got longer towards the end. I would apologize but honestly why? ;)
Sherlock angled his hips so that John's index finger made contact, and the groan that ripped out of his throat belonged in the back of sex alleys, but Sherlock hardly cared. He needed John to hurry up before he lost whatever was left of his mind completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, that’s right! You went to Iraq, didn’t you?”
John breathed in and out too much now as if what Sally told him became the cure to three years of aborted respiration. He was a drowning man, and the realization of it all broke through the surface of his waterlogged lungs and cracked ribs along the way. Yet this was the type of glorious torture that John felt when bullet fragments so long ago had splintered through the tissue and bones of his shoulder. The type of misery that caused the body to fight for every heartbeat until there was no blood left. John refused to die alone on that battlefield.
, if that’s what he needed. Always a step forward, reaching for the next step ahead, more of a father than anyone could’ve expected him to be.
It was just his luck. Just his fucking luck that a few weeks into his second term in a new school they get put in nationwide quarantine by the Prime Minister. Oh this is rich, even for John Watson who was used to things fucking up his life like rain clouds on a game day.
soulmates," Sherlock says, sipping his wine. Hating the word. Spitting it out.
Mycroft made an annoyed face and stood up, walking over to Sherlock as he swung his umbrella, "You're thinking about him again, aren't you? You need to stop, this is getting out of hand Sherlock."
It’s not often that John’s deceased wife actually falls into conversation topics in 221B. She’s an awkward topic, only safe when Rosie has a few questions about what kind of things she liked, like sports and hobbies, and Sherlock and John have shared meaningful glances in which they both express the sentiment to not explain that Rosie’s mother most enjoyed "killing people for money" and "lying to the people she cares about in order to travel the world under a pseudonym". Instead they told her she really liked cats and played tennis.
"What?" Sherlock is alarmed - he’s snapped his head over to look at John.
"If you concentrate on something else, actually go out sometime, then maybe you'll find him!"
"Erm, yes, sorry about that, Sherlock," Lestrade looked around for something, spotted it, and started walking over to whatever it was. "Bye Johnlock."
It’s nice to know that Mycroft still remembers the dialectal tone his older brother always bastardised the language with, and continues to use it even when bloody kidnapped.
Sherlock’s back is roped in scars from whips, lashings, more. He’s covered with marks from stab wounds (no gunshots, surprisingly), and punches and deep purple bruises that will take a long time to recover.
WEDNESDAY
"You...you said that...I’m not trying to make fun, here. I do think you are my soulmate."
It starts with a question from a 6 year old.
And Sherlock has never been more fond of one of John’s girlfriends ever before.
"I think it’s time to start running the bath," John says, swooping Rosie up in his arms. He’s forgotten to unplug the iron, though, so Sherlock has to get up. Bath time, he thinks. That’s normally something Sherlock doesn’t help with, but then every so often he’ll go in and they’ll paint bubble moustaches and beards on each other.
, he’d deigned not to care about it.
John makes a quick dash into one of the boxes outside his and Rosie’s room, trying to find a specific collection of papers and simultaneously attempting to not make very much noise. He’s placed his glass down on the coffee table before exiting so not to spill the expensive scotch.
Parenthood for you.
"Positivity, Brother Mine."
to be loved by John Watson, to love John Watson. There was no way, simply no way, John Watson held the same love for Sholto as he had for any other commander. Not if he was bi.
, and then he had a secret sister. Never any time to do something as mundane and boring as update the will, no matter how important it pe"Do you have one?" John queries, and Sherlock shakes his head. It seems stupid, infuriating really, that he doesn’t have a will despite have nearly died so many times.
Mary departs and they stare at each other for another minute before John balks and decides it’s too creepy. Sherlock thought it had been rather fun - that was undoubtedly the longest eye contact they’d shared, although it didn’t have the fondness that the glances they shared had held previously. Another swallow, deep this time. It’s his fault, this rift between them.
By different from my day? Doctor, Army Doctor, trained at Barts.
Sherlock didn’t like to admit that it was still up in his keepsake box in the loft, so that was often left out of the story. Although he suspected Mycroft, at least, knew.
But soon the Year 11 disappears into distance, Mr Halesworth answering another question and John quickly remembered he’s supposed to be learning and writing this stuff down, and the boy with his curls and suit and genius disappears back into the depth of the other students and John doesn’t even know his name.
John had been aware that Sherlock was tweeting during the ceremony - everyone was, especially when they’d heard Siri’s prompt apology when he’d slipped up. And he would have been concerned, for Mary’s sake at least, or one bit annoyed, except it was so quintessentially
John’s eyes fall to the floor, his left foot tapping on the floor. "You know."
It applies, really, to all in his life. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper. God, even Mycroft, probably, although he’ll repress that till the day he dies. And then the stars, the cherries on top. Rosie and John Hamish Watson.
"What, pray tell, will you be doing instead?" Sherlock’s face, although he’s attempting to maintain a level of composure, is exuding fondness and happiness and a beaming smile that only John ever gets.
"Well, get ready to raise Rosie if I die," John gets up and slaps the papers onto his laptop, in a reminder to do that tomorrow. Too exhausted tonight. He goes back to his whiskey promptly.
He’s not trying to get Sherlock to invite him into his bed, but that’s what happens anyway. Almost every time, John stumbles blearily into Sherlock’s satin pillows and falls asleep, to wake up entangled by Sherlock.
Sherlock stands up too, and they are closer than before, closer than he could have ever dreamt they would be. And when John kisses him his mind shuts off into nothingness and it’s bliss.
All in on love. Redbeard, of course, applied to this. Even if he had thought it had been a dog, a foul substitute for a best friend he knows he would never really remember.
Sherlock cast a curious glance towards the blond. He really was beautiful. Those eyes turned to Sherlock and Sherlock stared right back. They shared an intense stare for at least three minutes, Stamford looking on, completely weirded out.
He could hear a pin drop. The boy is blinking as though waiting for a response and John drinks in his appearance again, hoping it won’t disappear. He’s wearing a suit (who does that, it’s school?!), with a full on black blazer and buttons slightly undone, and his shirt is purple and god John can’t. He just can’t even with this boy.
"I’m in love with you, you fool." John let’s out a chuckle, although it’s tinged with a nerve Sherlock can relate to.
But yes, they had gotten together over the kidnapping incident. A confession over a cup of tea in the cafe, Mycroft recording his statement.
Hopefully Mycroft will fast track that as quick as he did the adoption papers.
John ignores it, folding up a shirt. "I like you, of course." “Sherlock?" Rosie asks.
Well, maybe they wouldn’t have moved house if he’d been in a different year, but the same principle applied.
"No, 'fraid not Sherlock," Lestrade bit into a doughnut.
Obviously, Greg had gone full Boss mode in order to find the government official, almost tearing his hair out whilst being on the phone to the nearest SWAT team, or, well, the English equivalent of it.
Later that evening, when Rosie’s in bed, they’re sat on the sofa. John swirls a beer in his right hand and Sherlock’s wine glass rests on the coffee table. The TV has nothing too interesting on, so they are mostly just chatting, but it’s...nice.
Mrs Hudson was asleep, and thank god for Mycroft who had given them a key. Both of them knew where the creaky steps were and avoided them - Sherlock setting the way out for John in case he had forgotten. Like a silent ritual.
"Oh no, Lestrade's first name is Graham, Gary, or something. A name beginning with G. Mycroft, I'm going to Scotland Yard, see if they need my assistance, which, let's face it, they always do," Sherlock tied his scarf round his neck and strode out of the room. Mycroft smirked and started to swing his umbrella again, "A name beginning with G, huh?"
Secretly though, he harbours the idea of Rosie calling him some kind of paternal endearment. He holds her close when they’re alone, knowing that if John saw he would think it weird. But of course he loves her, as much as he loves John. Rosie is a Watson, and that means he loves her unequivocally.
Sherlock nods back, settling into his chair with discomfort. It’s not as used to him as he’d like it to be - harder and less worn. John’s, too. They have a lot of catching up to do.
"Lestrade. Any cases for me?"
"No, Inspector, I wanted to introduce myself." Lestrade stopped. He looked at the man, who was holding up a pass, a pass that belonged to the Government, and immediately backtracked himself.
Sherlock’s brain screams.
John didn’t think he’d be able to step in an aquarium ever again, and had almost thrown up when Rosie showed somewhat interest in it. It was - heartwrenching, the idea of it, and Sherlock seemed to notice that, so he enticed Rosie with going on the London Eye, instead. The picture from that day was on the mantelpiece, now, and John could look at all three of their grinning faces for the rest of his life and be happy.
Other than Sherlock. Sherlock, who had been there to hold shopping bags or Rosie or even
"A cabin up in Scotland, maybe? You being all by yourself would drive you insane, so maybe not then. You’d have shot yourself out of boredom."
