Sherlock is sleeping in bed. John exits the bathroom in pajamas and gets into bed as well. Sherlock turns to spoon John. John waits a few moments before speaking.
Eurus goes to retrieve her violin. Sherlock and Eurus begin their duet and Mycroft quietly sits down to listen.
Sherlock?
Sherlock presses in further, letting John get used to the fullness. John whimpers out his pleasure. Sherlock puts his hands gently on John's waist.
He stands up and walks over to Mrs. Hudson and hugs her.
John chuckles.
I've fantasized about taking you like this... from behind, in the shower, just like this John. Just like this.
Er, yes, of course... Rosie and I can do our music lesson. Right, Rosie?
IRENE
INT.  SITTING ROOM - NIGHT - AN HOUR LATER
Thank you, Dr. Herscher.
(sighing)
SH:  IT WENT—
Sherlock hurries up the steps. Mrs. Hudson follows.
By the glow of the night-light, he opens the mirror cabinet and takes out a small container of lube he's stashed there. He cautiously looks over his shoulder at the frosted glass door separating the bathroom from Sherlock's bedroom. He gingerly pulls down his pajamas and frees his painfully hard cock, inhaling through gritted teeth.
Precisely. This is John Watson we are talking about! And we must have you looking your very best for him.
And you, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
Don't worry yourself. It was all handled very gently; but that doesn't mean it hurts any less.
Hello John. And good morning to you too, Rosie.
SHERLOCK
(impatiently)
(pressing fingertips together)
If you prefer that I find live subjects, I'm sure Bill Wiggins can rustle up some volunteers for us.
It was the least I could do.
Irene’s stony expression holds firm, but she's nonetheless satisfied to hear this. Sherlock nods to her again before exiting.
May I clean you, John?
(finally, a bit exasperated)
No bees!
(studying the tissue)
MYCROFT
SHERLOCK
Rosie go?
(screaming out his release)
Sherlock sighs sweetly in his sleep. John waits a second before trying again.
DR HERSCHER
Yes, well, that would explain one night, but what about the subsequent night? That is to say, last night, hmm?
ROSIE (V.O.)
We'll find a time. Please, I need to sleep.
SHERLOCK
(tapping his own chest)
(sternly)
(shuffling closer to John)
SHERLOCK
Let's start with the kitchen.
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were forgetting it on purpose.
John looks like he's about to blow a gasket. Sherlock has finally lost his patience.
SHERLOCK
I sent a bloody copper to her rescue, in case you didn't notice!
Sherlock doesn't answer, he's clearly perturbed with this line of questioning.
(usual disparaging tone)
Thanks, I appreciate it.
John looks embarrassed. Sherlock picks up a toy and examines it. He frowns.
SHERLOCK
ROSIE
What?
Yes, I am aware. It's precisely why I haven't told you that it's John I've been dating the past few months.
Do you want me to stick around, just in case?
Well, Dr. Watson, that's precisely what I would like to know. How are my clients being mysteriously drugged? It would appear that someone is attempting to frame me.
They calm me down.
MOLLY
SHERLOCK
Rosie giggles from the kitchen.
SHERLOCK
(clearing throat)
I'm Rosie Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
FLASHBACK ENDS - RETURN TO PRESENT
AUDREY
Outside 221 Baker Street, Sherlock asked the cabby to wait, pre-paying him to drive Lupita home. Lupita was happy to see them, but equally happy to be getting home and did not ask much about their evening. Sherlock accompanied her downstairs and helped her into the cab.
SHERLOCK
What's going on in here, Watsons?
"Thank you, John," Sherlock said, looking up at him with a gracious smile.
Please.
John stops pacing and fixes Sherlock with a vicious stare.
He doesn't seem that into me, Audrey.
One year.
Sherk!
The teacher's phone rings.
DR HERSCHER
John's shoulders relaxed slightly and his mouth loosened into a frown.
Sherlock disappear with Rosie. John stands in the middle of the aisle and looks up at the ceiling and groans in exasperation. His fellow shoppers give him the stink eye. He grabs the pink My Little Pony potty and tosses it in the trolley.
You. Kissed. Me.
SH:  THANK YOU, IRENE
Sherlock looks away demurely.
John smiles happily to himself.
Sherlock isn't going to like that one bit.
SHERLOCK
Okay, then. Are you sure you two want to pursue this relationship considering your history together?
Er, okay?
ROSIE
MOLLY
Baaaah!
SHERLOCK
No, that's not happening.
You didn't come here to show off your new... marital aids.
Well! That's enough reminiscing for one day, isn't it?
It is.
I'm afraid my sleuthing days are behind me, but thank you Mrs. Hudson.
(laughing)
We should stop by the clinic and get tested.
Sherlock inserts a second finger into John's hole. John immediately rocks himself back onto Sherlock's fingers with desire.
Sherlock!
May I go a little further, Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
They aren't dirty just...
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
How tedious!
I think you have that wrong, John. I'm better at repelling people.
In my mind you are an immortal being that never grows old.
John?
John scoffed in reply. Sherlock, filled with mischief and bile, leaned over until his mouth almost touched John's ear.
Okay, okay, Sherlock. Give it a rest.
No, that's not it.
Sherlock rubs the end of John's penis ever so lightly.
Sherlock, it's not necessary.
Sherlock points to a couple options.
That much blood, it should have soaked through the carpet and stained the wood floor underneath... quick, hand me my phone.
(looking at watch)
(rubbing his head and eyes)
John begins to lightly stroke Sherlock's long penis from tip to base and back up. Sherlock closes his eyes momentarily with pleasure.
Well, that clears up everything.
I'll go slow.
NAZIR
(blinking)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock and Mycroft are strapped in the seats, wearing headphones with microphones.
Only two more chapters to go!
It's all right, John.
(still a bit worried)
What else is there, John?
John's mouth falls open, gobsmacked. Sherlock grunts in annoyance and goes to an antique wardrobe and pulls open the doors. Irene and John, not wishing to be near each other, stalk to opposite corners of the room and watch Sherlock intently. Sherlock begins picking up sex toys and equipment, sniffing them each individually. John is clearly uncomfortable by all this.
(after a sigh)
Dr. Herscher smiles at Sherlock's self-deprecation.
I've missed this, John. Going on cases with you.
Sherlock strides down the path. He spies Molly and Nazir on a park bench, possibly the same park bench where he and John had their initial relationship discussion.
(scoffing)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock re-enters looking annoyed, but curious despite himself.
ROSIE (V.O.)
(with a little disappointment)
I'm having the best sex of my life Sherlock, that must count for something.
God bless Mrs H for renting you the basement for your experiments, 'cause Rosie toddling around teething on decomposing toes and spilling cyanide all over the place wasn't going to happen.
Sherlock texts back, it reads:
Molly sets down the tray on the table. Everyone gathers around. She takes off the towel with a flourish. A severed arm lies beneath. John and Nazir take a step back. Molly smiles happily, but notices John and Nazir's reticence.
Points well taken.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM - SATURDAY NIGHT
Nazir frowns.
I'LL PICK UP ROSIE TODAY. SORRY FOR CHANGE OF PLANS. I NEED TO PREP FOR MRS H BABYSITTING.
MYCROFT
(coldly)
SHERLOCK
Nothing.
Sherlock swallows his pride and faces her.
SHERLOCK
(with hurt in eyes)
Well, it IS a girl's name.
What would I do without you?
SHERLOCK
No. Stop. It's okay. Just experiment on me today.
But it's ever so much fun.
CLERK
You're welcome.
Absolutely.
It does! Can't go about cheating myself out of two months or giving myself two additional months by mistake. This requires precision, Molly!
(still looking outside)
(back to reading)
AUDREY
(growing serious)
(checking the trouser hem)
You've worked your way up over the past months to take my entire cock, and now look at you. Begging for it, John.
(carefully)
Visiting my dear friend Molly is all.
I really don't think this is a good idea.
You should get those! I'm not just saying that to make a sale. You really should buy them.
John and Rosie have now made it downstairs and enter the sitting room.
MRS HUDSON
I meant 'yes' to all the important things, of course.
Sherlock.
(rolling eyes)
Molly and Lestrade give each other a knowing smile. Nazir notices but is puzzled.
John's smile falls, disappointed Sherlock isn't responding to his blatant flirting.
Sherlock, obviously surprised by this, sits up and takes notice. He texts back eagerly: ANYTIME IS FINE I'M HERE ALL DAY
SHERLOCK
I wouldn't mind if you stayed. Actually... please stay.
(yawning)
"What's this?" John asked, spying a cardboard box next to the chair.
(shouting)
Sherlock? You there?
That's right. Get yourself hard for me.
All I know is I did not purposely kiss you.
Yours?
Really!?
MYCROFT
(whispering)
SHERLOCK
(grinning)
Audrey's eyebrows shoot up with surprise.
If you are steady and gentle, it will settle my heart. You'll see. Only refrain from any fancy tricks, embellishments with your tongue... that sort of thing.
Right, erm, Lestrade... Well, I, too, am concerned about the imbalance I see in my own relationship with John. I don't know what I bring to the relationship either, at least on an emotional level. Especially on an emotional level.
(dismissively)
John looks away self-consciously. It registers that she didn't merely say "go spend time with your daughter"... she said "family".
Ah! Who's that, Rosie?
You could help, you know!
Later that night, another sexual encounter, this time with less clothing.
(chucking)
Did you ply her with biscuits all night to keep her tame?
(impatiently)
So much fun.
(sarcastically)
Sherlock puts an ear to John's chest, analyzing.
, he thought,
Sherlock sighs and begins scrolling through his phone. John walks over to stand behind Sherlock's chair to read over his shoulder.
John looks over at Sherlock sternly.
John?
Meow!
(fussing about the waist and legs)
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
And how do you think that went?
John, watch your voice level. You'll wake Rosie.
AUDREY
(sighing with desire)
SHERLOCK
(long pause)
(shocked)
Sherlock gently puts his finger under John's chin to tilt him up so he can kiss him properly. They snog under the umbrella. Audrey notices and smiles.
Tea party!
Oh thank you, Audrey. And please thank your husband profusely for me. I owe you both a million.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John nods, remembering. He casts his eyes around the kitchen in thought, not quite able to meet Sherlock's eyes.
LESTRADE
No, I'll go.
glance over at John's booth, whispered something to the shorter man, and scooted him out from behind the bar. The short man pouted dramatically, but there was a glint to his eye that didn't escape Sherlock’s notice. Sherlock abruptly stopped dancing, announced "I’m going back to my friend now" to his dance partner, and promptly walked away. The mesh-shirt man called him an angry slur that Sherlock didn't recognize—something that ended in 'tease'—but Sherlock didn't care: it was high time to wrap up both this ridiculous case and the equally-ridiculous flirting experiment.
JOHN AND SHERLOCK
(with distress)
Erm. I suppose I have a lot to apologize for. Losing my temper the other night...
(nodding)
AUDREY
ANGELINE
Sherlock, in pj's and a housecoat, sits in his chair with his hands steepled. There are the sounds of muffled voices from upstairs as John and Rosie go about their morning routine. As they come downstairs and into the kitchen, their footsteps and voices can be heard more clearly.
SHERLOCK
John and Rosie are coming!
SHERLOCK
They both think hard.
Sherlock stands up quickly. He walks to the front door.
SHERLOCK
Ah. But does it give you any hope?
That's right... so clever. Good work.
(smiling back)
(also smiling)
Sherlock yanks John's trousers down and whirls John to face him in an instant. Sherlock's mouth is on John's, hungrily exploring his mouth with his tongue. Sherlock has both hands down John's (navy, not red) briefs, each kneading an ass cheek greedily. John grinds up against Sherlock, craving him.
And no other texts from her until today.
See ya, Sherlock. Say hi to John for me.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Help you find anything?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
As predicted, I was too convoluted, too problematic, and no match for his goodness in the end.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
I even determined that he has, in fact, experienced romantic love before by obtaining confirmation that he did indeed love his deceased wife.
Only trying to be prepared, Molly.
SHERLOCK
(furrowing brow)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
MRS HUDSON
MYCROFT
SHERLOCK
Sherlock hands John the lubricant. John squeezes a generous amount along the length of his condom-covered cock. Sherlock settles back on his back with a wry smile and spreads his legs again.
Molly is flushed with embarrassment.
Rosie claps her hands happily.
(chuckling)
John holds Rosie's hand walking down the stairs and pushes open the kitchen door.
Uhhhhh...
SHERLOCK
"You mentioned you felt like stealing an ashtray, so I did. For you."
AUDREY
I really want you to orgasm with me inside of you tonight, John.
This is a work in progress and I intend to finish.
"I tried to tell you. I mentioned it was unlikely we’d ever meet again," Sherlock replied. He attempted to lighten the mood, "I believe I even tried to get you to name your daughter after me."
Nope. No chance.
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
(calmly but firmly)
Sherlock, Irene, and John enter.
I don't know what that means, nor do I want to.
John Watson.
Mwah!
But you still commute into the city for work. Baker Street would be much more convenient for you.
"Look. Whatever you wear will be fine, John. We'll go Saturday night at 9pm before the crowds arrive," Sherlock explained quickly and calmly, "I'll arrange a babysitter for Rosie and everything."
Hello Dr. Watson! Thank you for calling us back... Yes, that's right, he never showed up... I've got Audrey here and an Officer Greg something...
Hello Molly. No, not as such. Is this an okay time? Just returned from lunch with Nazir?
Yes, please.
(to self)
SHERLOCK
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
Yes... we live near you... you've been to my place even, with that nice police officer. Remember?
So sensitive. And eager. But please do relax so you don't knock me unconscious in your enthusiasm, John.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock-
With Rosie eating, John writes a note on a post-it and puts it on the kettle. It reads:
Shut up about the bloody kiss already!
Yes, just give me a moment.
SHERLOCK
(abruptly, formally)
John rests his head on Sherlock's chest, with one ear listening to Sherlock's heartbeat. He glides a hand across Sherlock's torso, caressing him with his thumb.
You can call me Greg. All right, apologies for all the disruptions. Glad it is sorted. Good evening, everyone.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John guffaws with a shake of his hiead.
Cuff them. Here, let me show you.
And I slowly enter you... very slowly... so that I can watch the expression on your face as I push into you a centimeter at a time... so slow... until my entire cock fills you up. Just envision that, Sherlock.
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
Sherlock turns only slightly at the sound of his voice.
(getting loud)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
That's right! You should be. I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but I'm a pretty good detective when I put my mind to it.
(with a small smile)
You are having second thoughts about where our sex life is taking us... It was never my intention to push you into anything you don't want to do. We're moving too fast, is that it?
John straightens up and approaches Sherlock.
Was it Omar Sharif? He was so dashing, wasn't he?
Oh yeah. You are going to absolutely love it, Sherlock.
(breath ragged)
Feel free to, but let's not let my brother catch wind of that. It'll go straight to his already overdeveloped ego.
NAZIR
Sherlock glances at his watch.
John, I want you inside me. I want you to penetrate me.
Oh my God, John!
Will do.
Er... yes, of course.
(sighs)
(studying John)
No, I checked.
(confused)
"You were the best thing that ever happened to me, Sherlock."
You don't seem like yourself.
(throwing back head in embarrassment)
Dorian runs by Sherlock and John. Sherlock picks Dorian up and twirls the kiddo around; Dorian squeals with glee. Dorian's flailing legs hit John, knocking his coffee out of his hand.
Mycroft ponders this.
(breezily)
SHERLOCK
Okay now, quit it. Quit it!
John wafts his hand near his nose.
So, your young thief's got no relations... what about the roommate?
TEACHER
(absent-mindedly)
You could speed the process along by telling him how you feel.
You're in luck. This one doesn't vibrate.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock was too agitated to wait for an answer and propelled himself out of the booth and onto the dance floor, which was growing more and more crowded as the night wore on. He girded his loins for the multiple tasks at hand:
I got your text.
Always so loud when you climax, John.
Oh Sherlock, John'll come around. You'll see. Give him time.
SHERLOCK
Like what?
Sherlock rises and heads to the kitchen.
John carefully placed the ashtray back into the box. Then he gazed down at his hands in his lap. He sniffed hard to stifle the rising wave of emotion. Sherlock continued to build towers for Rosie.
John...
(quietly, in reverie)
That's a good one... I'll have to borrow that analogy.
Always scheming something...
A little smile surfaces on Sherlock's face and he turns and disappears down the hallway.
SHERLOCK
And I regret losing you as a client. You've made great strides with your addiction and recovery over the years. I've watched you grow as a person, tackling your emotional issues. I'm very proud of you Sherlock.
John takes the suggestion. Sherlock tries one more angle.
(snippy)
(quietly to Sherlock)
You heading out this afternoon?
Yes. Especially since it is with you.
SHERLOCK
(deeply)
He'll steal them.
MOLLY
(sighing)
"Give me that!" Sherlock growled, swiping at it angrily.
Ha! I don't believe that for a moment! You sent me in there --
She missed you. A lot.
Oh yes, Scotland Yard already has a suspect: a first year uni student, international student, from Cambodia. But they haven't been able to pin anything on her yet. That's where I come in. She's clever this one. She does this trick where she changes her shoes at the crime scene... well, half a block from the crime scene. Cheap Chinatown shower slippers. A different pair every time. It makes it impossible to follow her footsteps as she flees--
Audrey and John both start laughing.
Fun fact: I accidentally pasted this entire chapter into a spreadsheet of a shared Google Doc for work, and then spent nearly an hour trying to fix it and cover my tracks! Whoopsies.
John turned it over in his hands. It most definitely was the same ashtray Sherlock had filched from Buckingham Palace. John didn't like the tight feeling that sprang to his chest upon seeing it again. He tried very hard to maintain a neutral expression in order to mask the turmoil taking place in his heart and mind.
(anxiously)
(snippy)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
But I catch your drift. Nonetheless, this recovery thing has been easier to take with you two here. A welcome distraction, you Watsons are.
Well, it always happens when the weather gets particularly nasty like this. People decide they can put off their nagging little health problems until the skies clear. You know how it goes.
MYCROFT
NAZIR
That was no "little episode", Sherlock. An untreated heart condition can become quite --
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Where exactly are these precious children that you are supposedly supervising right now? For someone so keen on childhood welfare you are being rather neglectful at the moment, aren't you Audrey?
Sherlock is in a crabby mood all weekend long. John and Sherlock have a row in a Tesco. Sherlock has a hard time mind palacing. Sherlock finally finds some release Sunday night.
Sherlock belatedly realizes he's used the "L" word and freezes.
John rotates in Sherlock's arms to face him and resumes, with some difficulty, stripping Sherlock of his tight shirt. Sherlock, amused, watches the look of concentration on John's face. Once the shirt is off, John regards Sherlock's long naked torso with desire and some envy. He lightly runs a knuckle down Sherlock's chest and stomach.
He stalks to the bathroom and gets out the lube.
EXT. ROSIE'S NURSERY SCHOOL - FRIDAY - EVENING
(with guilt)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock can't meet John's eyes.
And you think that would be a good match for me?
SHERLOCK
Oh fuck!
MOLLY
John's phone sounds with a text alert from Sherlock. John reads it and exhales in annoyance.
SHERLOCK
You had me worried there for a moment.
John rests his head on Sherlock's chest for another moment. Sherlock strokes John's hair.
I had things on my mind, John.
(perplexed)
Fewer people than you think, Sherlock.
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
No, Sherlock. It's Monday, and Rosie and I have to get going pretty quickly here.
(muttering)
I have had to endure years of witnessing both men and women fawning all over you, Sherlock.
John stands up straighter, not knowing what to expect.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
A date? A real date?
SHERLOCK
John is well into his masturbation routine already. He doesn't notice the figure at the frosted glass door.
You're supposing she's an herbalist, but no. Herbs weren't one of the healing services she provides... I mean, provided.
SHERLOCK
INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Sherlock's head appears with a smile.
(fibbing)
Oh Christ. Again?
MRS HUDSON
(with a small chuckle)
Sherlock has his eyes squeezed shut, but nods enthusiastically.
He's right, I did.
"I’m not concerned with her at the moment," John answered firmly.
I really wanted to... I prepped and cleaned and everything.
In the dark, they spoke softly about the evening's case and a myriad of other inconsequential things. Sherlock felt nearly overcome by this sweet and idle pillow talk—this tender, commonplace intimacy that the whole world took for granted but that Sherlock hadn't had the opportunity to experience until that moment. It was lovely.
(eyes growing big)
Smut Alert for the second half of this chapter. It will be labeled.
Audrey, gobsmacked, looks back and forth between John and Sherlock.
MYCROFT
"Audrey has Rosie. John will pick her up later. Don't come."
SHERLOCK
I'm not actually g-
Sherlock, perhaps a shower and a nap are in order, before we meet up, hmm? Rosie! Time to go.
He instructed me, in no uncertain terms, not to hand her off to anyone but himself.
(embarrassed)
Hello, Mrs. Hudson!
John rolls his eyes, turns on the TV and starts folding laundry.
Where to?
Yes, Mycroft has been avoiding Eurus as of late, and he's overdue for a visit with her. Somebody needs to make him do his brotherly duty.
Only the very smuggest.
Irene, we will take these to the lab and analyze them for cocaine and whatever else is on them. I know it isn't much, but it's the only lead we have at the moment.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(very loudly)
Well, I am the relationship expert, after all.
John grips a little tighter and slides both his hands up and down Sherlock's shaft excruciatingly slowly.
MYCROFT
(shaking head)
With any luck, he'll forget all about us in the next five minutes.
Sorry?
Sherlock nods his head and holds John even tighter.
Sherlock's eyes grow wet with emotion.
INT. KITCHEN
"A minor, very safe, stakeout, John. Come on, it'll be fun."
MYCROFT
"Mary," John uttered, "Hospital sounds like a good idea, could you call an ambulance?"
SHERLOCK
(throwing head back in dismay)
SHERLOCK
(talking a mile a minute)
See? Very stylish.
Scar tissue could be interfering with the heart's functions. You don't know.
So, off to lunch, I see? A lovely lunch date. Not afraid to be tipping your hand with your new friend Molly, hmmm?
(with shoulder sagging)
So, got any dirt to dish up on John and Sherlock?
OUTSIDE FITTING ROOM - TEN MINUTES LATER
You may be able to wash and hang those, but these formal ones you'll need to dry clean.
He collapses on his stomach dramatically. John sits back on his heels and regards Sherlock with mild worry. John quietly strips the condom off himself.
(very intrigued)
Right. Lucky girl.
MYCROFT
Well, size isn't everything. Unfortunately.
DR HERSCHER
John closes the door and walks towards the middle of the sitting room. He pulls out his mobile and sends a text. It reads: RU HOME?
John enters, turns on the baby monitor, and gets into bed on his usual side. He sighs happily and settles down to sleep.
Then Sherlock makes short work of undressing John. He finishes by taking off John's reading glasses and giving John a kiss.
I looked at those, but they're too long.
One, watch the bar, particularly the till and the fedora'ed barkeep.
No. Not really. Only to demonstrate that things are perhaps a little mucked up already, so to speak. Why not throw another spanner in the works?
I... I've never done this before.
Hmm. Since you seem to like it so much, we'll schedule a full session of analingus in the future. But today...
Then we should get you to bed. Should I join you tonight?
SHERLOCK
John, wait.
(cranky)
Small talk has never been my strong suit.
Sherlock's face morphs into a pout as he takes out his phone.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock's face hardens as he drops the act.
SHERLOCK
"Mycroft, what are you just standing around for?" snapped Sherlock, "Shouldn’t you be out getting me a pardon or something? Moriarty’s back! Didn't you hear?"
SHERLOCK
I had a half day at the clinic --
John's sad expression betrays his true feelings. But he's willing to soldier on. He carefully places the violin in its case and clicks the case closed. He turns off the lights in the sitting room as he leaves for Sherlock's bedroom.
Don't panic. Absolutely no reason to panic. You are already the best parents in the world. Look at all the practice you've had.
Don't keep me waiting in agony, John.
AUDREY
MOLLY
Your husband getting his uni students to help out is bloody brilliant.
John plops down in his armchair, glaring at Sherlock. Sherlock, busily texting, ignores his surroundings. Mrs. Hudson watches John and Sherlock with growing concern.
SHERLOCK
They continue the unbuttoning.
Er... what are those?
Right. Ciao.
John pulls his head back in shock. Then his brows knit with growing anger.
Oh, I see, okay...
SHERLOCK
(after a pause)
SHERLOCK
New house, same neighborhood? Doesn't seem particularly wise.
of this, Sherlock, then you're completely and utterly mad."
(then curious)
(to Sherlock)
Okay, big girl, here we go. Say goodbye to Sherlock.
Who says I'm fretting? I'm not fretting!
SHERLOCK
See? We've got new pink wellies, and everything.
That's not how it works, Sherlock. You don't get to be M.I.A. for days on end and then come back and say you miss me.
Sherlock leans off his chair and sniffs the jeans heartily.
John groans and stands up reluctantly. He holds out his hands, gesturing with annoyance.
John goes searching in the bottom basket of the stroller.
I'm exhausted, Sherlock...
SHERLOCK
No, we're pretty sure we're having a girl.
AUDREY
Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink!
I said, it must be a tricky case if you've needed to have a big think about it all morning.
SHERLOCK
MOLLY
(rolling eyes)
We don't have to do this Sherlock.
Really? Is she single?
Sherlock works on his laptop in bed. John enters from the bathroom in pajamas and observes him curiously.
not conducive to chatting, knowing John wouldn't appreciate it in his present black mood. Instead, he nodded and leaned his head towards John to both see and hear him better.
And you don't, of course.
SHERLOCK
Nooo. Let go of me, you arse.
That might work. It would save time.
SHERLOCK
-- An open invitation for me to peek in!
SHERLOCK
Get started without me. I won't be long.
John, you are so hard right now. I do believe you are enjoying this... I best move us onto the sofa before you nut.
Sherlock doesn't know how much time has passed when he opens his eyes again. Sherlock's gaze falls on John's face. John is concentrating on his work, but there is more in his expression, which Sherlock attempts to deduce.
You ARE normal people. You have a bigger heart than you let on. You, too, are capable of recognizing your mistakes and learning from them.
John gives him a questioning look.
MRS HUDSON
I won't be afraid to make my feelings known, when the time's right, that is. Molly and I are still getting to know each other, and I'd appreciate no interference in the meanwhile.
Mycroft!
(without taking his eyes off the telly)
LESTRADE
What's wrong with that?
Red pants.
SHERLOCK
Occupational hazard.
John waits for Audrey, pushing Dorian in the stroller, to catch up. They continue walking together.
Okay, okay. I've obviously struck a nerve. I'll go see if Mrs. H is available. You don't seem to be in the right frame of mind for contending with a small child.
Molly?
John headed to the kitchen.
(sighing, coming clean)
You can't be getting a lot out of these... little sessions, Sherlock.
Yes, you'd think so. But that just adds to the mystery. Irene, do you mind if I have a look around?
Under the covers, now, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
How's the pace?
Fuck.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
ROSIE
AUDREY
Sherlock gets that faraway look in his eyes again. He suddenly looks incredibly tired. John tempers his disappointment and sweetly rubs Sherlock's shoulder.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock redoubles his efforts, focusing on licking and sucking the shaft and end of John's cock steadily as John comes closer and closer to climaxing. At last, John's fingernails dig into the back of Sherlock's hand as he orgasms quick and hard.
John's face softens at the thought. John texts back: SEE YOU
Well then, I need to tend to some things down in my lab and Lestrade sent me information on a promising new case, but I'll come back up for Mrs. Hudson's visit... I'm sure she'll bring biscuits.
Well, Mary said "I love you" first, and at the time it was very easy to say it back.
What?
Smut alert for last two-thirds of the chapter.
I don't know what to do anymore!
He bites into a biscuit he finds on the kitchen table and ponders things.
SHERLOCK
I see. Sort of. Why does it frustrate you so, I wonder? If you are being sexually satisfied, then why --
Rosie makes kissing noises. Sherlock walks over and plants a kiss on the top of her head, to her delight.
They leave. Sherlock moodily contemplates his tea once again. He sniffs his shirt to see if John is right. Yep, a little too ripe.
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
Sherk!
Rosie and Sherlock exit through the kitchen. John watches them go, fondly.
Yours aren't exactly tight, leaving absolutely everything to the imagination.
Sherlock pulls away from John's kisses and gently shakes his head no.
Great, I'll join you.
"So, I would end up losing you. Again. Unwittingly. Permanently."
Oh, I'm sure Lestrade can put up with a bit of convolution. He's put up with my sorry arse mucking about in his cases for years and years now. That must count for something.
a voice in his head chided him. But yes, that's exactly what Sherlock wanted to do. He was belatedly realizing he didn't appreciate watching people flirt with John any more than John liked people flirting with him.
It has a slight sulfuric acid burn and...
Please be sure those besotted horses stay together, Sherlock. For everyone's benefit.
It is so little to go on... but we'll get to the bottom of this.
No worries. Maybe it'll help whet her appetite, even. But she needs a little time to get composed before seeing visitors. Hope you two don't mind waiting here for a few.
Why don't you go mind palace in your room, then? Or in that bloody mad scientist laboratory you have going on in the basement, hm?
Stationed outside all twenty possible venues at the ready to take pictures of every single patron picking up tickets over a five day period? Yes, yes I did.
John is clearly angry.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - LATER THAT SAME NIGHT (FRIDAY)
(raising an eyebrow)
You are most welcome.
Tell me now.
TEACHER
MYCROFT
I'll stay until five or so. See if you happen to need me then.
I have some things I want to talk to Mycroft about anyway.
(scornfully)
DR HERSCHER
I thought our date would be a good step... good for our relationship. It seemed good. To me anyway.
SHERLOCK
He's your intellectual equal, I suppose?
Hello, sister mine.
But did you really need to be such a drama queen about it and give yourself a heart condition over it?
"It's for a case, John."
Being you.
(warningly)
But --
Sherlock suddenly pulls away from John and roughly turns him around, pressing John face-first up against the shower wall. Sherlock squeezes a generous amount of lube on his right hand as well as on his cock.
(pause, in thought)
Mycroft's rubbish surveillance you mean.
(less grumpily)
TEACHER
John smiles at him again before disappearing into the kitchen. Sherlock watches as they collect their things and prepare to leave. John and Rosie appear in the archway again.
Wha -- careful, Sherlock!
Do you mean to tell me that at the exact moment I finally held you in my arms, you were deciding there was no hope for us?
Don't mind if I do.
John, look, I said it was fine. It's nice knowing that you missed me so much.
Smut Alert for the second half of the chapter. It will be labeled.
SHERLOCK
(affronted)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - TUESDAY EVENING
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
Stay warm in there, Rosie.
Ah! Yes, thank you, Greg. You and Audrey pals already, how charming.
(grinning back)
Ask your question, Sherlock. But just one. It's getting quite late.
Several dangerous substances aren't hazardous until they are heated to the point of vaporization. Nazir, you have photos of the crime scene?
Er... a dollop?
MOLLY
I'll endeavor to do better.
Well, here you are! Audrey, how lovely of you to bring dinner, so thoughtful! Come with me, let's pop it in the oven. And Rosie, I bet you'll be wanting dinner. Come dear, I know exactly what you like.
Jesus, Sherlock!
Oh, I'm not here in a police capacity at the moment.
"John."
Does this happen a lot? In the middle of the night like this?
SHERLOCK
I’m good at tending to things, even tedious ones, if they are important to me.
(with some frustration)
(batting Sherlock's feet away)
Good idea.
Sherlock explodes from his chair and runs for the front door.
Well, that figures, but it won't work for tonight. Pick a side, Sherlock.
Rosie nods her head and Mrs. Hudson starts drawing.
(in distress)
Uh-huh... right... hmm... thank you.
Sherlock turns to his chair and clicks open the violin case.
MYCROFT
He points the dildo at Sherlock's crotch as emphasis before dropping it into the shopping bag.
(reading out the text exchange)
The door swings open and Officer Nazir enters, making both Sherlock and Molly jump.
NAZIR
Lestrade looks up at Mycroft in surprise.
(softly still)
SHERLOCK
No, I'm usually a complete tosser towards them actually.
Fine. You can just drop me here, then.
The clerk smiles and hands over a medium grey tweed waistcoat and trousers set.
Rosie looks expectantly towards the back hallway.
I'm not afraid to show my feelings, unlike some people I know.
Well, it certainly is flattering.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks at Rosie in the stroller.
Yep. Just getting used to it.
(in agreement)
And yours is the biggest I've seen.
Sherlock comes out of his reverie, a bit disoriented, but spies John folding laundry and smiles.
SHERLOCK
You may be a bit sore tomorrow though.
(intrigued)
Always! Although I've seen him pick up Rosie from school a couple of times in his pajamas... it's either one extreme of the other. I bet he's never worn a pair of jeans in his life.
Any radiators?
I thought you might say that.
Excellent. You go ahead. I'll join you in a few.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(resigned)
(speaking through door)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks relieved by the suggestion.
John hears Sherlock's bedroom door slam. He exhales sharply and stares up at the ceiling, wondering what to do about Sherlock. Wondering if his own actions may be a bit wrong-headed as well.
Yes, they are old. Musty under the fragrance of laundry soap. A slight scent of naphthalene, yet mothballs have been banned in the EU for over a decade...
SHERLOCK
Irene did not disappoint. It was a rather simple case, actually, but the setting could not be more perfect: she had heard from one of her clients, an owner of a gay night club, that the bar's till mysteriously came up short a couple hundred pounds each and every Saturday night. That would
At least I don't think I reciprocate.
MOLLY
John smiles sadly.
Jesus, Sherlock!
He settles back into his chair and takes up his book again. Sherlock tunes up and begins playing his violin.
Okay, let's look in.
Sherlock freezes in the archway when he spots John preparing tea in the kitchen: an act Sherlock has seen John do hundreds of times before, but has never fully appreciated until now. He marvels at John’s comfort and ease in the kitchen, how he fits in so perfectly. Sherlock’s eyes fill with emotion.
MOLLY
Bullshit.
INT. BARTS DISSECTION LAB/ MORGUE - DAY
Sherlock was beginning to wonder this himself.
I'll go. That gives you a moment to regain your composure and --
MRS HUDSON (O.S.)
SHERLOCK
I'm sorry.
Sherlock peers down sheepishly at his large erection.
I plan on telling Mycroft about the situation. His people will take it on and ensure my source's immunity in the process. I'm not certain your department can offer them the same amount of protection.
(flustered)
(quietly)
(exasperated)
Stay here.
John couldn’t hold back a smile breaking across his face.
I don't wish to leave any stone unturned. Now, I need to inspect the tools of your trade, if you don't mind.
So soft and cozy... but what's going on underneath those jumpers, that's what's always intrigued me, John. I've always wanted to see.
A wave of relief crashed over John.
Sherlock. Okay. Then promise you'll listen to me, please. Actually listen.
MRS HUDSON
Look. Gotta go. The case... lots to think about... may need a patch...
Sherlock, is that necessary?
(drowsily)
Yes! One of your most favorite people in the world. Right?
(strained, breath erratic)
(on phone)
Yes, he is.
Here they are.
John splashes water out of the sink in frustration and glares at Sherlock.
Sherlock smiles briefly at John's response, but his own carnal desires are taking over.
NAZIR
SHERLOCK
seeing John look so miserable had ceased to be fun, and Sherlock very much wished he hadn't taken Irene Adler's stupid suggestion at all. What was the point of manufacturing this useless jealously when it only made them both terribly unhappy in the process?
(trying to put on a practical front)
That's right, taking me all in... I want to feel you on my cock, I want to know how it feels to be completely inside you.
AUDREY
Then he's smarter than you give him credit for.
Mrs. Hudson assists Rosie in hanging the ornament.
INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - JOHN'S OFFICE - MONDAY
Don't think of it as spying, think of it as helping me solve a mystery. The mystery of "where John is taking me on our date tonight."
What? That's what people do.
(a bit sharply)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
Sneaky bastard!
SHERLOCK
(grumpily)
Oh well. Next time then.
SHERLOCK
My what?!
John walks away down the pavement. Sherlock watches him go for a few moments before turning back to Barts.
Stand up.
SHERLOCK
LESTRADE
(following close behind)
SHERLOCK
We are heading to the park today, care to join us?
Er... three. You've kissed me three times in the last 47-hours. Twice here in the kitchen and once half-asleep Friday night on the sofa. Three. It appears that there's someone else here that enjoys kissing, as well.
Sherlock stalks out of the room and John lies back on the bed, massaging his erection as he waits. It doesn't take long; Sherlock returns in a flash with the bag, searching it for exam gloves. He finds one and dons it, and promptly climbs back on the bed.
No new interesting person in your life, Molly?
Lestrade. Have you seen Molly around the station by any chance? I need to talk to her but I didn't see her at Barts. I wondered if she might be fraternizing with Nazir somewhere?
Yours, however, are always skin-tight.
(shaking head no)
For how long?
(sigh)
(from inside tent)
"Ah, good."
For starters, we'll need to decide if this little interaction we just had was a one-time thing, or something we'd like to continue in the future.
I've been meaning to ask you, has Molly finally agreed to go out for drinkies with you after work?
Smut Alert for the entire chapter. They are a couple of horny fools, bless their hearts.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
I missed you as well, Rosie.
Sherlock looks away sadly.
Rosie gave out a cry of joy upon spotting a crate of building blocks that Sherlock had stowed under the table for her. Sherlock bent down to help her retrieve it. John returned his focus to the cardboard box where something shiny immediately caught his attention. He carefully pulled out a crystal ashtray. It made his breath catch. Sherlock glanced over.
"There's no rush, you know. We can go slow... take all the time we need so it doesn’t become too much.”
Don't mention it.
Are you sure?
I feel bad that you two started off on the wrong foot... you know... the incident.
"Why not?" The query was voiced with both kindness and insistence. John muttered a curse and knitted his brows together as his distress accumulated.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM - WEDNESDAY NIGHT
"Ahhhhh!"
SHERLOCK
Here we go again.
SHERLOCK
"Sherlock, I apologize. I am really, really, sorry. I don't know how it happened." John looked absolutely scared to death.
John stands, places Rosie on his hip, and moves all the dishes (except for Sherlock's) to the sink. Sherlock scrolls through his phone while finishing his breakfast.
SHERLOCK
INT. IRENE'S TOWNHOUSE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
I know, Irene. You took great care of me at a particularly low point in my life... perhaps the lowest. For that, I will be eternally grateful to you.
Sounds lovely.
John reaches down and rubs Sherlock's arm in appreciation as he watches Sherlock work on him from both ends.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock thinks on this, and slowly nods again.
SHERLOCK
Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting.
Sherlock is on his feet in a flash.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(wry smile)
Sherlock glances at John and rolls his eyes.
John nods and returns to preparing breakfast. Sherlock may be thinking, but he is also carefully watching the going-ons in the kitchen at the same time.
Now, John.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John leans down to kiss Sherlock in the middle of his chest, making Sherlock gasp. Sherlock pulls John up to kiss him properly, even though John must release Sherlock's prick to do so. Sherlock kisses John hungrily over and over.
SHERLOCK
(sighing)
All clients of yours?
Have you never tasted it?
(more seriously)
Sherlock closed his eyes and his own memory kicked in. He recalled a trip to his mind palace: a very interesting one involving John and himself, and an incident at a waterfall in 1894. The Reichenbach Falls. Moriarty. A struggle. An unexpected rescue.
(bitterly)
MYCROFT
ROSIE
Good lord, that's convoluted.
Boyfriend... well, it's perhaps more serious than I thought, then.
I have to look after Rosie.
(trying to cover it up)
Bye-bye!
MOLLY
(with disdain)
Ut-oh. Waaahhh!
AUDREY
People can send their texts labeled "high importance" or not. And I've simply set her urgent incoming ones with that alert --
John, intrigued, looks questioningly towards Sherlock who seems a bit lost.
We need to start walking before Rosie mutinies. Here, let's switch.
Like I said, Sherlock. It's a lot. There's probably a thousand other things I've not thought of, as well. Each one of them warrants a discussion... although usually not all at once. Relationships tend to evolve over time, you know.
What? Not good?
Why don't you come join me? It's a lot warmer in here.
What? Again? Really?
(rubbing forehead)
Sherlock wipes away a tear. John looks pretty choked up as well. There are a few moments of John quietly holding Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
"Do jog my memory, if you don't mind," he requested with all politeness. He steepled the fingers of his hands and rested them against his lips in preparation. John exhaled loudly and glanced up to the ceiling, gathering strength.
Poke fun at you? Never. Molly is a dear friend of mine and I would very much like to see her set up with someone "nice", as she herself would say. Someone who can appreciate all that is wonderful and good about her. Someone stable... not a sociopath, basically.
John leaves the flat. Sherlock gently puts down Rosie. He collapses into his chair with a huge dramatic sigh. Rosie, in attempts to copy him, laboriously climbs onto John's chair, plops herself down dramatically, and mimics his sigh. Sherlock looks over at her with an amused smile.
(darkly)
Sherlock snaps his head to look at her.
Thank you... that was...
Sherlock smiled brightly at the scattered dancers collecting under the disco ball, pouring on the charm. A gleeful trio of young men pulled him into their dancing group, and he shimmied along with them briefly before excusing himself gracefully. He exchanged smiles and barely-audible pleasantries with more club goers as he made his way around the noisy dance floor, while covertly watching John in the meantime. He was happy to note that John was keeping a keen watch on his antics. When Sherlock made it back to the booth, a little out of breath, John pulled a face.
That's not what I meant.
God, I hope it will be soon.
SHERLOCK
Yes, well, if you try hard enough you may recall these two. One a dapple-gray, the other a bay. They were constantly together.
Yes, I suppose it is.
Sherlock bends his knees to make room. John sits down heavily on the sofa, leaning his head against the wall.
(diving right in)
Quiet John, you'll wake the whole house.
Lestrade looks up at him dazed and doesn't answer for a moment.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(folding hands)
John nods with understanding, taking in all this information.
"Flat is fine, luv," John replied. The waiter nodded and headed to the bar with their order. Sherlock hoped John hadn't seen the color in his cheeks when John had used the endearment "luv" on him. The man was only play-acting after all, Sherlock reminded himself.
Very much so.
You know what? I'll finish these tomorrow.
SHERLOCK
Holding his cock in his hand, John rubs his bellend against Sherlock's perineum and hole. Sherlock's head lolls at the erotic sensation.
Sherlock studies her crying face, frowns, and points to the mess on the ground. He grabs a tea towel and crouches down to sop up the mess.
You know, hopefully soon you'll start using a potty chair like the big kids at school. Wouldn't you like a potty?
That's right. Come, John. Come.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John's lips press together in an angry line. Rosie is watching their expressions closely.
SHERLOCK
... Some other people.
What's that you've got there?
So, can we do the relationship talk now?
SHERLOCK
John sits cross-legged on the bed with his reading glasses, typing on his laptop. Next to him is a towel laid out with a row of sex toys carefully lined up by size: small butt plug, larger plug, small vibrating dildo, large dildo.
Ut-oh Mycroft.
That's because you have an active imagination, Sherlock.
You honestly think John and I can't be separated?
Bullshit! You are sneaking out. Just like last night, and the night before, and the night before that. All week you've been fine one minute, and the next minute you flip out and go running off!
(pausing)
Eye contact...
SHERLOCK
Are you game?
(blasé)
Nevermind. Did you get a chance to eat?
Well... I appreciate that.
Ut-ut-uh. I'm undressing you first, remember? This is me, playing out MY fantasy.
Close. Madame Imelda.
NAZIR
John grins naughtily up at Sherlock. Sherlock smiles back.
MRS HUDSON
I've checked all the venues. The names Watson or Holmes aren't on any of their will-call lists. John isn't very inventive so I also checked the usual suspects: Hooper, Hudson, Sholto, Stamford... there is a Morstan on one of the lists, but I doubt he would use that name.
John is speechless at this. He walks over and sinks into his chair. They both look at each other with a mixture of shyness, affection, and nervousness.
John reaches a hand to Sherlock's backside to give his bum an appreciative grope.
She stands up and extends a hand. Sherlock leans over her desk to shake her hand.
SHERLOCK
(rolling eyes, lowering voice)
SHERLOCK
MRS HUDSON
(yawning)
(huge eye roll)
SHERLOCK
Shall I regale you with my other fantasies, John? About how I plan to shag you... up, down, and sideways... in every room of this fucking flat?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John nodded as his fingers sought out the top button of Sherlock's button-up.
She's been Rosie Sherlock ever since I picked her up from school. Rather convinced Sherlock is a girl's name.
MRS HUDSON
Er... bones of the human body?
Mmmm... Sherlock. This is... ahhh.
(from in the stroller)
SHERLOCK
So, tell me, how's your love life?
SHERLOCK
One could say that, yes.
(whispering darkly)
Sherlock continues until John is knocked on the floor. John stands up and tries to shove Sherlock over.
Sherlock continues to work John open with his two fingers as John squirms and presses against Sherlock's hand.
And you don't seem to mind being taken from behind. Unlike myself, apparently.
Sherlock lies on the sofa, reading on his computer. John walk in the room with a laundry basket. Sherlock looks up at him.
With the little amount you just put on your hands? No. But for Marta and Irene's other clients who use it habitually... very possibly. That's why we are going to Barts to find out.
See? Savory.
See? It's still in its infancy. Give it time.
Then I don't think you are being framed. At least not on purpose. You see all your clients here, correct?
A serial art thief, nothing too serious, just hitting up private residential collections of French Impressionists... but very well researched. She's cased them out meticulously; studied up.
SHERLOCK
Are you getting sick, luv? I think we'll have to put you to bed early.
I bet! Hasn't worn you down yet?
DR HERSCHER
I can be okay with being on the receiving end... and never giving back.
NAZIR
There's nothing here. Too sanitized. Let's check the bed.
John enters the bathroom. Sherlock lies in bed, eyes opened, listening to every noise from the bathroom and hoping John doesn't sneak out the other door.
SHERLOCK
Vivienne shakes her head in admonishment.
Sherlock's breath hitches. He thrusts into John's hands over and over.
Sherlock's phone pings again.
Dr. Herscher studies him over the top of her glasses for a moment.
I remember being utterly knackered and you telling me about a case. I think I fell asleep partway through.
Sherlock, you may be aware I have a policy against working independently with members of a relationship. Only couples counseling.
ROSIE
You are allowed some irrationality once in a while. Especially when it comes to jealousy.
MYCROFT
Barley.
"Another drink then? Hardly likely since you don't seem all that interested in your current one."
(relenting)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock sighs impatiently and rustles through the side table drawer until he finds it, and squeezes some lube on the gloved hand.
SHERLOCK
Ready?
John adds a little more pressure to the hand-job, never changing his fingertip’s position in Sherlock's bum. Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut and lolls his head against the headboard with pleasure.
Whose brilliant idea was that?
MRS HUDSON
Finally. It's been nearly a month, wouldn't you say, John? Took you long enough to figure it out, Mycroft. Shall we chalk that up to your usual shoddy surveillance?
SHERLOCK
A waiter approached their table with her pencil poised over an order pad.
I suppose. But please remember to be gentle while you insert that bloody thing, will ya?
Irene texts back: I KNOW
(sarcastically)
John, I want you to masturbate yourself while you finger my hole. Please.
Sherlock finally nods. John is relieved. They recommence walking.
Molly grabs the shopping bag and presses it into Sherlock's hand.
(warningly)
John sits on a bench looking around expectantly. He spies Sherlock approaching. Sherlock has spruced up considerably: showered, clean-shaven and wearing a dark suit with a cobalt blue shirt. John immediately feels inadequately-dressed and furtively fusses with his own outfit and hair.
Irene frowns, bested.
(confused)
ROSIE
John storms off. Sherlock watches him go, indifferently. Sherlock hears his bedroom door creaking open.
It's going to be fine, John.
INT. SHERRINFORD WAITING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
SHERLOCK
John sighs and wanders off to join Rosie playing in the sand. Mycroft and Sherlock stand side by side and observe John and Rosie.
(clearing his throat)
(calling out)
(calmly but darkly)
Well, there's no reason to be nasty about it.
You have no idea how fucking amazing you look right now.
SHERLOCK
John hands her another ornament.
In my bed. Obviously.
SHERLOCK
One finger only...
SHERLOCK
Rosie found my wedding album.
I'm too tired to be goaded, John.
John dares to press his finger deeper into Sherlock.
Sherlock sniffs a container of lubricant.
Thursday. You just have to hold out until Thursday and I'll be all yours.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock begins unbuttoning John's shirt from the top.
SHERLOCK
Ella folds her hands in her lap and stares sternly at Sherlock.
I know what you're trying to pull here.
(exasperated but gently)
John strips his coat off and throws it on his chair. He walks into the kitchen.
(sighing)
MOLLY
Sherlock suddenly sits back on his heels and cocks his head, studying John.
"Oh really?"
The medics are gone and Sherlock and John are indeed in their own little world on the sofa.
CLERK
(chuckling)
John sets Rosie in her booster seat and gives her some blueberries to tide her over while he makes the waffle batter.
What?
EXT. GOLDEN JUBILEE BRIDGE - FRIDAY - MIDDAY
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John stares at his phone in thought after hitting send. A moment later, it pings again. It reads:
Oh please, John. Like I'm not going to figure it out. You're rubbish at keeping things from me.
They had decided to get a quick bite to eat before heading to the club, not only to feed John (and grudgingly, Sherlock) but also to discuss their plan of attack for the stakeout. However, their posh outfits, general giddiness over their mission, and not having a two-year-old in tow
"Oh, just some things I've found around the flat that belong to you," Sherlock said casually, as he followed the toddling girl around the front room. John, his curiosity piqued, opened the box. He pulled out a book.
And Mrs. Hudson does lover her Chicken Tikka Masala.
John. Rosie and I have been discussing it, and we feel it is high time she had a potty chair of her own.
Entertain your clients.
(loudly)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock is delayed, and asked me if I might be able to pick up Rosie for him. I'm good friends with John... known him for years. Surely you could make an exception for an officer of the law?
SHERLOCK
That's right. I'll be back soon.
That's exactly what I've texted him.
Sherlock...
Sherlock stared intently at John before responding.
Yes, by all means. We can measure a dollop later.
Well. Perhaps so.
Upstairs? We'll if you'll excuse me. I'll only be a minute...
SHERLOCK
I hate this already.
(with glint in eye)
Not again!
FLASHBACK ENDS - RETURN TO PRESENT
SHERLOCK
Taking care of a baby is tedious work, Sherlock. You’d find it boring.
Ohh, our little visit to Ms. Adler's... Yes, now it's all perfectly clear. You were inspired by her collection.
Will you sleep in my room --
She sips her tea. Sherlock glares down at her from his perch.
(small smile as well)
What's going on in there?
What's wrong Rosie?
SHERLOCK
Your closet, top shelf, storage box, left-hand side. You may want to give it a good airing before wearing it though.
LESTRADE
(quietly)
(staring down in his lap)
Of course. Thank you, Molly. As always, you are wonderful.
Shall we draw a pig now, Rosie?
Calm down, Rosie. Calm down. You're all right. Back to sleep.
Why? Has he said anything about us during your sessions?
Fine. I'll treat it as a thought experiment.
Oh, you sneaky bastard, John. That's when you'll get the tickets. Hm... maybe I can get Rosie to spill the beans.
If you weren't so nosy --
SHERLOCK
John, if you really don't want me to know that you use my bed when I'm gone, then you ought to remember to turn off the baby monitor when you leave.
John sits down on the bed, peering over Sherlock's shoulder at crime scene photos on the laptop.
You two have been best friends for years and years and years, and, well... you are bloody awful at matters of the heart.
(quietly)
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
Eurus doesn't look at Mycroft.
Now that was interesting, Sherlock thought. He tapped a finger to his lip. The cogs in his mind began to whirl.
NAZIR
So it has.
Condoms?
ROSIE
I got bored.
"No."
Who knows?
AUDREY
(provocatively)
Precisely! Two mind-blowing orgasms for me, and zero for you.
Breathing heavily, John stays on all fours as he recovers. Sherlock pulls out slowly, degloves, and wipes his hands off with a wet wipe. Sherlock eyes John's back, covered with a sheen of sweat, and his round bum encased in his red pants. Those red pants.
A night out?
(conceding)
SHERLOCK
(stammering)
Sherlock's eyes are brimming with strong emotion. Mrs. Hudson pats his hand reassuringly.
John looks away, overwhelmed.
"Or if you'd like, we could just dance together," Sherlock offered. Perhaps if he could convince John Watson to join him on the dance floor, he could scrap the whole ridiculous flirting enterprise altogether.
Molly beams up at Nazir, impressed. Nazir looks chuffed, but then turns serious.
SHERLOCK
See? Absolutely no interest in potty training.
Yeah, well, it gutted us both, didn't it?
(over mic)
(grinning ear to year)
This is a whole chapter of “porn with feeling” with some flashbacks to when Sherlock talked John into moving back in to 221B Baker Street. So, I’ll put a SMUT ALERT on the whole chapter.
SHERLOCK
I didn't mean...
SHERLOCK
Bye Rosie darling. Bye John.
SHERLOCK
I see my detective skills have been rubbing off on you.
I can't imagine what her reasons would be.
John steps into the room to let Sherlock pass by. Sherlock departs quickly, with a brief glance at John, but John's eyes are downcast.
Aw, look at that. They're all happily in the same paddock.
(quietly)
God! Yes, Sherlock! Fuck!
But, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought goldfish were your type? There was Anthea, and then your other assistant, I forget his name. Lady Smallwood probably came the closest to your IQ level--
Sherlock fully sits up and wraps his hands around John's upper arms in a comforting manner.
(deeply)
It's fine.
He's fine.
Rosie starts crying. John rubs his face in despair.
SHERLOCK
No, not yet. Strictly twice-a-week-lunch at this moment. And funny how you only bring that up when you want to distract me or poke fun at me.
Oh Rosie.
I'm going to go put away the shopping.
(darkly)
Anyway, we'll eat waffles and then I'll take you to the Docklands Museum to help us take our minds off the whole Holmes family, and how incredibly good they've been to both you and me, in their own odd ways.
SHERLOCK
It's hardly a heart condition.
SHERLOCK
Oh Sherlock. Forget the tests. This doesn't mean we must jump in the sack for a shag the minute we get home, you know. We can take it slow.
Sherlock's phone dings.
MRS HUDSON
MRS HUDSON
(scolding quietly in his ear)
SHERLOCK
Suit yourself.
Uh-huh... I see... I'll put her on.
Angeline and Mica head off.
(enticingly)
Fine! Spoil her rotten.
NAZIR
MOLLY
SHERLOCK
Daddy!
MRS HUDSON
VIVIENNE
All the same, I like the balance Gregory provides in my life. I just don't know what I give him in return.
John picks lint off the duvet since making eye contact with Sherlock seems too difficult for him.
SHERLOCK
Yeah, I should say so.
I think he's still sleeping, dear.
LESTRADE
Yes, Sherlock.
John and Sherlock are asleep in bed. Per usual, John wakes up with a start... and an erection.
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively.
Well, I would very much like to do it again. Thursdays are good a evening for me, you know.
But Scotland Yard's got jurisdiction in --
Sherlock did not waste any time plunging his hand into John's underpants, while his other hand reached around and nestled under the layers of jeans and pants to cup John's buttock. With deft fingers, he fondled John's balls, moved up to trace the underside of his shaft, and delicately massaged the tip. John let out a deep moan and Sherlock smiled in satisfaction. As Sherlock continued to explore and please John, he came to the conclusion that touching John like this was one of the most exquisite experiences of his life. He felt his own erection growing steadily in response.
(smirking)
I plan to lower myself down onto it oh so carefully... I’ll take you in bit-by-bit... down to the hilt, Sherlock... until I'm impaled on your cock.
INT. DR HERSCHER'S OFFICE - FRIDAY
John walks out the door while Sherlock, Nazir, and Molly fall to discussing how to conduct their experiment on the arm. Molly catches sight of John leaving, and gets a worried look on her face. Molly nudges Sherlock.
(softly)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock rushes out of the door before John can say anything.
Rosie's nursery is right near my place.
SHERLOCK
Your concern for the matter demonstrates that you may have a kernel of these feelings in you already, and you need to allow yourself the time to let them flourish.
Now, let's see what we have here.
Who's Audrey?
They are nearing the door of the prison. Mycroft pauses and turns to Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
(amazed)
Do you remember the neighbor's horses at Musgrave Manor? Two horses in particular, Lucky and Thistle.
Then get on with it, already!
SHERLOCK
Hope? Why would it give me hope?
Off to the loo, be right back!
SHERLOCK
(blowing a kiss to Audrey)
"Oh. Yes. That," he said.
Sherlock is texting wildly again.
Very true. But the tapering should help with the insertion process.
SHERLOCK
"My head's feeling a little funny, I’m afraid…" Sherlock's voice filled with distress. "I worry that I won’t remember this, John."
SHERLOCK
You really aren't very good at this, you know?
"No?"
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
Really, John, no. That won't be necessary.
Molly’s expression softens.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John! Sherlock! Welcome home. Did you have a nice time?
Okay, I apologize. I'm sorry.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock opens the drawer and pulls out a packet of biscuits with a flourish. He fixes John with a look of feigned annoyance. John scoffs, but with smiling eyes.
Er... I already tried her. She must not have her phone on her. No response.
He searching through the stroller pockets and produces a bee toy stuffy.
Everything okay?
(bashfully)
(softly)
(alarmed)
I was so sure he was in love with me already. All the evidence was there. Apparently, I was very wrong. So stupid of me!
LESTRADE
(yawning and closing eyes again)
SHERLOCK
(commandingly)
I'm not...
"What about Mary," Sherlock asked as his eyelids grew heavy.
What do you mean?
(smirking)
Then why the sad face, John?
(glowering)
John, before we begin, you must know a few things. It is very hard for me to get an erection, even harder for me to maintain it, and extremely difficult for me to reach orgasm.
"Day in day out"? Oh, I see. Of course. All day long, even... as one does with their girlfriend.
Quite a big one, too.
LESTRADE
I suppose you're wondering why I can't say I love him back.
"Okay, time to get you off the plane, then," he insisted, "Ambulance will be here any second now."
Sherlock's mouth is on John's, kissing him roughly, with such need. John places his hands on Sherlock's waist, but Sherlock bats them away. He holds John's chin firmly.
John?
Sherlock had stopped building. Rosie lay on her back conducting her own experiment of banging two blocks together over and over.
AUDREY
So, we’ll not use the police for now. And as it turns out, Molly may have some candidates who won't mind participating in some topical drug testing.
Then why not turn in for the night?
MOLLY
John, fighting embarrassment, places one hand at the base of his cock, and massages the tip with his other hand. Sherlock watches intently. John begins stroking the length of his penis in earnest.
You don't think I'm being framed?
Ready, AJ?
(ignoring him)
John grabs the lube off the shower caddy and oils his hands.
There are a myriad of reasons to get cardiovascular exercise other than weight loss, you know.
John, all set for bed, gets in and pulls up the duvet. Sherlock breezes in, also looking ready for bed.
(snickering)
SHERLOCK
Remember John. Keep it light. I can't handle too much pressure.
Sherlock accepts John's suggestion and settles back on the bed. John tosses him the bottle of lube which Sherlock catches.
(quietly)
John bends his knees and lifts his hips so Sherlock can slide his pant off him. They are tossed on the floor with the rest of the clothing. Sherlock kisses John's right knee while his right hand lightly caresses John's hungry cock.
(smiling shyly back)
(settling in his armchair)
Sherlock reaches up to give him one more luscious kiss, and John returns to business. His thrusts are deep, strong, and fast as he approaches orgasm. He grunts on every exhale. Sherlock moans and holds on with a steel grip.
John and Audrey stop walking, alarmed. John bends down to check on Rosie in the stroller.
It has recently come to my attention that you like this.
Oh my! I will look into that. But...
But you were too tired to talk, remember? You needed your beauty rest.
Sherlock smiles affectionately at John.
I know I'll risk sounding like your therapist, but how does it make you feel, watching these people flirt with me?
John leans over to peek through the archway to spy on Rosie napping on the sofa.
You're incorrigible.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
ADLER:  HAVE TO GO, DARLING. CAN'T KEEP MY CLIENT WAITING. DO KEEP ME POSTED THOUGH
What are you doing, John? He's clearly asexual like Audrey said... or there's some other underlying physical condition. He's not manipulating you, John. So why are you trying to manipulate him? Stop trying to trick Sherlock into having sex with you.
Thank you for a lovely evening, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Rosie smiles.
(on edge of seat, excited)
No. Any new, interesting people in YOUR life, Sherlock?
(mockingly)
SHERLOCK
Of course not. Audrey, he's been doing this all day long.
ADLER:  NO, FORGET FLIRTING
(with a smile)
The website said it should stimulate the prostate.
John rummages through a rack of trousers, picking up a pair and inspecting it uncertainly. A SALESCLERK (20's, mod haircut) approaches.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock throws back his head and groans. John sighs again.
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
John paces the bedroom, trying to listen to what's going on upstairs. He finally turns the baby monitor on and sits on the edge of the bed in contemplation.
John catches up to them at a jog.
John's in love with me but I'm not sure I'm capable of loving him back.
(slyly)
Oh, I didn't expect to find you two home.
John stops walking and looks down dejectedly. Audrey stops short, too.
You'll find nothing. The sheets are changed and everything is cleaned thoroughly after every use.
Why don't you do everyone a favor and just get fat instead of inconveniencing us all with your running?
(nodding)
SHERLOCK
What then?
Ha! I beg to differ on both points. The relationship has only served to highlight how emotionally and sexually stunted I truly am.
That is, in fact, why I insisted you come over, isn't it?
(whispering)
SHERLOCK
I have someone I'd like to refer you to, if you are amenable.
(sniffing hard)
I abandoned you for two years, of course you would find someone new to spend your time with, but I had no idea how much it would affect me, seeing you with her.
SHERLOCK
Vivienne shrugs.
TEACHER
Mmmmm.
"Your plane took off, and within minutes it was turning around again and landing. Mary, Mycroft, and I boarded and you were gibbering on about some cold case involving a Victorian ghost woman killing off horrible husbands..."
MYCROFT
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
LESTRADE
Understood.
I worry there is a mismatch in feelings towards each other, though.
With concentration, he undid the button on John's jeans and pulled down the zip. Sherlock let out a ragged breath as his hand skimmed over the hardening bulge hidden beneath John's underpants. For the third or perhaps fourth time that evening (Sherlock was losing count), he found John's
MOLLY
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
No need.
So, how was everyone's day?
The wet wipes would work better for this sort of thing.
I'm fine now. As you were, captain.
Could we see how much damage the lotion does first before we fight over who gets to take down drug lords, please?
I hated myself. I was so tired. Hopeless, really. Utterly hopeless. Despairing. Especially about us, you and me. I didn't dare hope - that hope had died.
(to the kids)
Boyfriend.
John carefully pulls down his pajamas a bit to free his erection. He reaches for the lube on the side table, and squeezes some out on his hand.
MOLLY
MYCROFT
"I stole it for you." Sherlock's tone had softened, although his attention was now on setting up a tower of blocks for Rosie to gleefully knock down—a favorite game she and Sherlock had devised.
Oh, you like that one, do you?
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT (SUNDAY)
SHERLOCK
(tauntingly)
SHERLOCK
John grabs the bottle and hides it behind his back. Sherlock focuses next on John's midsection.
I'd really like you to continue therapy.
The room was too hot, the music was too loud, the dancers had become uncoordinated with alcohol and who knew what else, and Sherlock Holmes was not having the best of times. However, occasional glances over at the booth showed John having an even worse go of it: frowning moodily into his drink and generally looking very cross with the world. The surprising thing was, there seemed to be a segment of the gay population who found middle-aged malcontents irresistibly attractive, because on three separate occasions club-goers had approached John's booth to chat him up. John eventually shooed them off, although there was one burly fellow in leather who seemed particularly keen on getting John's attention, and Sherlock had resisted the urge to pull himself out of the dancing crowd to come to John's rescue.
"I'm wearing somewhat formal. You'll be mismatched in pj's."
Shit! Shit! Shit!
John suddenly notices a small packed suitcase standing in the corner.
Sherlock holds up the bottle and John's hand.
Sherlock and Mycroft gaze out over the water.
Sherlock tries to hide his extreme pleasure behind a small smile.
IRENE
SHERLOCK (V.O.)
(stressed & annoyed)
Really. They're up all night.
I didn't know you two were close.
"Thank you," he squeaked.
SHERLOCK
John looks very pleased with himself. Mrs. Hudson smiles on him fondly.
SHERLOCK
MRS HUDSON
Angeline and Audrey, who have watched this whole exchange, glance at each other knowingly.
Audrey nods slowly. Lestrade whistles in surprise and appreciation.
SHERLOCK
(mumbling with exhaustion)
SHERLOCK
You know this already?
AUDREY
(a little annoyed)
John enters and finds Sherlock standing a bit awkwardly in the middle of the room. John holds up the baby monitor.
You actually called out my name during sex with her?
SHERLOCK
John leans down to retrieve it, and Sherlock is quickly at his side, picking it up as well. They both hold the spoon and Sherlock attempts to gaze deeply into John's eyes. John glowers at him.
Yeah, we're friends.
(grumpily)
A well-dressed Sherlock sits a bit bored and out-of-place on Irene Adler's sofa, texting on his phone. Irene, dressed comfortably, is using her laptop at a nearby table, doing her monthly finances (as every small business owner should do). She looks up and smiles pleasantly at Sherlock. He smiles pleasantly back.
SHERLOCK
(while typing)
(sighing)
Sherlock lies on the sofa, head against the armrest, fingers steepled in thought. John approaches the sofa.
SHERLOCK
It isn't a problem. Your job is to keep that big brain of yours from getting in the way.
John begins to unbutton Sherlock's shirt from the top.
Go ahead and say it, Audrey. "John, you are a big, fat coward."
(alarmed)
John turns and raises an incredulous eyebrow at him.
There's nothing here. We need to check the other rooms where you...
You Holmes boys are better with children than you let on.
INT. HELICOPTER - FRIDAY - DAY
Isn't that so, brother?
Augh! No, Molly. This is unacceptable.
Which will all come to a screeching halt when I can't return his love.
Naaa... us bobbies are more trained for fast, hard sprints. We're rubbish at the long, slow stuff. But I'll be there to cheer you on at the finish line.
(turning to her)
SHERLOCK
(smirking)
What brought all this about, Mrs. Hudson?
Look, the cashier just tossed them in the bag and said "you'll be needing these". I would have inquired more but I sensed I had outworn my welcome at the sex shop. And I would have done my own research, but after the afternoon with the little SVT episode...
Scoot over.
But let's have some ground rules here. There will be condoms, lube, and wipes at the ready...
Right you are, Rosie.
Sherlock enters carrying Rosie.
One is good enough.
MEDIC #2
SHERLOCK
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
Er... 'yes' to which?
(cheekily)
Sherlock! Wait!
(under breath)
SHERLOCK
Yes, sir.
(pointing to a pair the clerk is holding up)
I thought you were breaking up with me.
You stay there. I'll get you a flannel.
John, in a suit, sits at a table by himself. He looks around worriedly. He pulls out his phone and texts.
John exhales with relief. He pulls out halfway and thrusts deeply into Sherlock. They both moan.
John heads out the door again. His footsteps on the stairs can be heard. Sherlock doesn't move from the window and plucks the strings softly still. When he hears John's footsteps coming back downstairs, he stops and turns to the door expectantly. However, John enters through the kitchen door and proceeds down the back hall to Sherlock's bedroom. Sherlock moves closer to the kitchen so he can watch John. Outside Sherlock's room, John adjusts his outfit nervously (wanting to look his best for Sherlock). Sherlock grins softly to himself: amused, touched, and flattered. John knocks quietly at Sherlock's door.
You aren't the only one who works. I have a job, too, you know.
Oh, yes, I heard some of that, too. You must count your blessings, Sherlock. To have a man that virile, and at his age, too! Believe me, dear, I can relate. My husband was the same way... ten years older than me and well into his sixties still wanting it three, four times a week. This one time --
John approaches the reception desk with a smile. VIVIENNE (a decade older than John, female, any ethnicity) gives him a terse smile back.
Could you pretend to be a bit more surprised, please?
I tried to psych myself up for it... but I honestly don't know what I'm doing, Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
But still, you kissed me.
SHERLOCK
(deeply)
We share it.
(joining in)
He tiptoes out of the room, closes the door silently, and heads downstairs.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
We're bound to get some walk-ins though, right?
Sherlock gingerly climbs into bed. John turns off the lights and gets in on the right side of the bed, pulling the duvet over both of them. He settles in, lying on his back.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock narrows his eyes, judging.
(to Mary)
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
John looks up at Sherlock curiously. Sherlock panics. His heart begins racing, not in a good way.
(hiding surprise)
Sherlock resumes his snuggly spot beside John.
Rosie is running around the sitting room and bouncing on furniture, wearing Sherlock's funny hat.
And who holds the power in your relationship with John, I'd like to know.
Fine. Do be kind, though. No snickering.
(looking amused)
NAZIR
That I did.
Uh-huh.
Sherlock, you need to give it some time... some time to fall in love or figure out if you’re already in love, perhaps. The relationship is not very old, after all. Maybe only a month or so...
Never mind all that now, I have a new address for you...
That's right... you'll come in your red pants, and you'll come hard. With me pounding into your lovely arse, do you hear me?
(furious)
AUDREY
John glances at a new text.
Sherlock plasters a smile on his face as they leave the flat. As soon as the door shuts, he drops his smile and stalks to the window to watch Rosie and John head down the pavement. Then he flounces back on his chair with a loud groan.
Mild angst. Apparently, people have a lot to say on the subject of love... it's a long chapter. Smutless.
AUDREY
Good morning, Rosie.
Perhaps we need to take a step back, Sherlock.
(hands on hips)
(yawning)
SHERLOCK
Yes. They're fine, Sherlock.
Yes, you really like Mycroft, too, for whatever reason! Mycroft is Sherlock's brother.
You can practice on me another time. Just not tonight, I'm afraid.
Sherlock Holmes, I will make you come tonight, if it is the last thing I ever do. I don't care how long it takes. Now, your job is to stay in the moment and not let your heart rate race away again. Do you understand me?
SHERLOCK
Eurus walks over to the hatch in her cell, motioning to Mycroft to follow. Mycroft places the candy in the hatch and closes it. Eurus picks up the packet on her end and squirrels it away under her mattress. Mycroft exhales in relief. He reaches into his suit jacket pocket for a smaller packet of Maltesers. He opens the packet and pops a candy into his mouth. Eurus hears the sound of the packet opening and strides over, standing right in front of Mycroft behind the glass. She holds her hand out expectantly to him.
I'll get you some apple, Rosie.
John, pushing the stroller, struggles to catch up.
Anyway, nice surprise seeing you home... we aren't often home alone in the middle of the day together, you know? Could be fun...
(yelling)
Rosie continues to pull Mycroft to the sand pit. Mycroft sits down carefully, not wanting to get even his running clothes sandy. John joins Sherlock's side to watch Mycroft and Rosie begin building their castle.
Is it time to schedule another date night, Sherlock? Hmm? Spend some quality time together? I believe it's your turn to pick the venue.
(annoyed)
Bleach... Irene, the client who sent the lotions, where are they from? No! Don't tell me.
(shocked)
the ins and outs of this place, particularly when the till is left unattended."
Obviously.
(holding up a piece of paper)
ROSIE
The fact that you BOTH have kept this hidden from me for so long...
John grins and licks his lips.
Sherlock looks up at John in surprise. It takes all his willpower not to blurt out "You! I'd get my best friend back, you ninny." Sherlock decides on a more subtle route.
Love?
Okay, I'll join you tonight.
MYCROFT
Maybe to keep YOU from becoming all jealous and suspicious... but, it appears we have BOTH those boxes ticked off already, don't we?
I've been willing to take you at your word, John --
Why don't you let me decide how much I'm getting out of our "little sessions"? Hm? There’s a fallacy in judging my level of satisfaction based on the number of orgasms I may have, John.
SHERLOCK
MYCROFT
They both look away awkwardly.
(sourly)
But Sherlock is there swooping her up safely in his arms.
(glancing up)
(subdued)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock eyes light up.
Well fine. It’s true he's yet to verbalize it... but...
Hm? Yes?
Not at all.
John peered into Sherlock's eyes, checking his vital signs.
Mycroft chuckles.
John unconsciously licks his lips in anticipation, making Sherlock melt.
SHERLOCK
John jumps at the sound of Sherlock's voice. He rolls his eyes and exhales sharply, not pleased. Sherlock pops his head into the kitchen. He is already in his pajamas and a robe, or perhaps he's worn them all day.
Hm. I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.
SHERLOCK
John and Rosie enter and spot Sherlock sitting in his armchair, typing. He smiles brightly and puts down his laptop. Rosie races over to him.
(stressed out)
(carefully, but still teasing)
Oh no. No. We aren't going to have you fully dressed and sticking who knows what up my arse. I don't care if that's your biggest fantasy or what...
SHERLOCK
What's eating at you, John?
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
really
(to self, an idea clicking)
Sherlock departs and Lestrade rubs his forehead and sighs.
John! After the initial push it went right in on its own accord!
SHERLOCK
IRENE
Will do.
No luck, they close in ten minutes. It'll have to wait for tomorrow.
there had been the whole debacle over Sherlock's fake engagement to Janine. Even when Sherlock was on the receiving
If you break her heart again, I'll make sure you never step foot in here ever again.
(another small nod)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John turns in surprise and sees Sherlock in the sitting room. He blushes and smiles and walks down the hall, through the kitchen, and joins Sherlock in the sitting room.
(annoyed)
You mean, like I'm dumb arse?
(surprised, but keeping cool)
I'm not ready for this... none of it.
SHERLOCK
than just Sherlock's eyes. The bloke began monopolizing Sherlock as they danced, grinding up on him and touching him excessively. Sherlock really wasn't enjoying it; however, he used the situation to his advantage by positioning their dancing bodies so that he could observe the bar without being seen, although it also unfortunately blocked his view of the booth where John sat. When Sherlock could catch the occasional glimpse of John, it only made Sherlock's heart pang unpleasantly:
(chuckling)
SHERLOCK
Dorian
John looks out the window at the nasty weather. He quickly types back: BRING UMBRELLA!
SHERLOCK
(gesturing towards Barts)
John closes his eyes as cum spills over his hand. He carefully opens one eye and peeks at the glass door again, afraid his cry has woken up Sherlock. After a few moments, he feels he's in the clear and washes up.
I believe you'll need to clarify for me.
Sherlock stands up and casually strides to the kitchen.
John, we're off! 'Til tonight.
(enticingly)
Sherlock complies, inserting the toy gently as John inhales through his teeth before relaxing.
As Sherlock inserts the toy an inch, John's head falls back on the pillow with pleasure.
(back to reading)
Let's put you on food prep instead.
A buzzer rings, a door opens, and Mycroft and Sherlock enter quietly. Eurus, behind thick blue-tinted glass, sits motionless on her bed. Sherlock and Mycroft approach the glass. Sherlock gently puts down his violin case.
SHERLOCK
I'm John Watson! I know everything about relationships, I've had a million of them!
John exits and Vivienne watches him go with a tiny motherly grin.
Too late, he already has!
SHERLOCK
Sherlock continues to hold John tightly to himself as both men pant out and recover. Finally, Sherlock rises gingerly.
No one is debating that fact, John.
(huskily)
(smiling)
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
How dare you? Distracting me like this.
Not to mention rather demanding in the bedroom to boot...
Sherlock nods and rolls up his shirt sleeves in anticipation. John sets up a cutting board, knife, and vegetables.
SHERLOCK
John?
John ups the ante by grinding his arse into Sherlock's groin. Sherlock nearly swoons. Using his hand as guidance, Sherlock reinserts his cock into John's hole. They both gasp at the pleasurable sensation this new position provides.
Too close to the heart.
Sherlock, scruffy and looking knackered, lounges in his chair and sends a text. It reads: WHY NOT COME OVER?
(with ragged breath)
I'll come right to the point. John Watson is in love with me but I don't reciprocate.
(pumping his fist in the air)
Great.
Sherlock holds John tighter and is too flattered to speak. After a moment, though, a dark look of self-doubt crosses John's face.
Special Smut Warning: Somewhat Rough Sex. Followed by very gentle sex.
"I'll remember for the both of us," John whispered and deposited one more kiss on Sherlock's lips.
They resume walking. Audrey glances over at John who still looks very worried.
(not convinced)
MRS HUDSON
Sherlock registered the presence of his older brother looming nearby; which did not sit well with him.
Sherlock yawns and is about to pour himself some coffee when he hears noises emanating from the sitting room. He walks over to investigate.
Oh... okay.
SHERLOCK
I don't know what you mean.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock flushes at the connotation. John can't help but smirk, but then grows nervous.
John giggles again, prompting Sherlock to giggle, too.
Sorry to be so horny.
Er... nothing much. Anything new with you?
They continue walking together down the sidewalk side by side, pushing their strollers. John signs and looks about, agitated.
"Rosie finally, finally went down for her nap," he announced as he rubbed his face with parental exhaustion, "But not without a fight. That's toddlers for ya."
SHERLOCK
There's a giggle from the stroller and a boot goes flying.
It's so fetching, and you don't even realize you're doing it, do you John?
SHERLOCK
CLERK
(smirking)
SHERLOCK
John looks up at Sherlock with intense desire, but not knowing what to expect. Sherlock gazes down at him with a lopsided grin. He carefully kneels in front of the sofa and slowly unbuckles John's belt. With precision and care, Sherlock unbuttons and unzips John's tight, fancy trousers. John gasps as Sherlock frees John's hard cock from the confines of his pants.
Okay. But there's all these dishes to do.
You are perfectly capable of walking there on your own.
Stinky!
Probably not.
I'll keep that in mind.
John scurries to cover the toys. Sherlock enters the room. John looks very guilty sitting in the middle of the bed.
SHERLOCK
Sherk!
The two brothers walk together down the pavement with their minds on chips.
MOLLY
LESTRADE
But John is giving Sherlock the soft look of love again.
(pause, lost in thought)
John shook his head no.
Sherlock, wait --
Just checking.
Did your boyfriend say --
SHERLOCK
"Just as you've always done, John Watson... looking after both of us," Sherlock said with a quiet smile. John licked both his palms generously—in lieu of any available lubricant, it was the best nature had to offer—and placed a hand on each of their cocks. Sherlock gasped again at the feeling of John's hand back on his erection, now
Whatever you like. But be gentle. I require a light touch.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
As would I.
Sherlock turns his head away self-consciously.
(trying to keep cool)
John has reached the final bottom button of Sherlock's shirt.
Sherlock thrusts his hips up again.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Yes, Rosie, I kiss you. Not Sherlock.
John felt a rich, pleasant warmth spread through his body. John wondered if Sherlock had felt something similar when John had said those same words to him.
SHERLOCK
John, please.
Oy vey, Eurus. THAT one I remember.
John?
MYCROFT
One year.
AUDREY
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - LATER SAME DAY
Sherlock turns and walks back into his room.
John looks away again. But Sherlock does not. He watches John carefully, making a decision.
We'll start with the vibration off. Perhaps we'll add it later, don't you think? Now spread your legs a little wider for me... thank you.
You aren't wrong there. Well, as safewords go, it's bloody awful. But we'll use it for now. And let's just pray we don't have to resort to it, all right?
Sherlock still has the soft and wistful smile. John is definitely overcome. Rosie gets a little bored and starts to turn a page in the album. John blinks away emotion and helps her turn the page.
Shut up, John. Ahem, now about these trousers of yours...
SHERLOCK
Yes, John.
Let's ditch some of these clothes.
(concentrating)
(quickly)
(annoyed)
Not your doctor, not in this case.
DORIAN AND ROSIE
SHERLOCK
Listening to see if you've woken up the household, or the neighbors, or perhaps the whole block.

SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
I won't be available to play nursemaid to you Sherlock. I have work and a daughter to tend to, you know.
Well, we built up to it. You are particularly fond of sticking things up my bum, you know. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.
Oink! Oink!
(perplexed)
I can't... This was a one-time thing. I can't go on cases with you anymore.
(sweetly)
John turns and waits for Sherlock to catch up.
John carries Rosie quietly down the hallway.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT
(incredulously)
I really do need to go, Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson has been watching Rosie for hours and she needs a break.
you want to do, John?"
Quiet, I said! Do you hear me?
IRENE
Maybe I mistook you for Mary tucking me in. Or anyone, literally anyone else! I was sleep deprived after a week from hell while my friend nattered on about shower shoes and fencing stolen art...
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(holding up a big bottle of booze)
Of course, Sherlock. Of course, I'll share. They said I'm all clear.
(hoarsely)
All of the above, actually.
You asked me about my love life, Sherlock.
(picking her up)
And we could even combine some of these activities. Perhaps we could bathe together, indulge in some hanky-panky in the process?
SHERLOCK
Jealous?
No, John. Please. Lie back down and rest.
Or not-so healing vapors. Brilliant, John! Some mystery substance has been painted on those salt lamps and has been slowly releasing poison into the air.
How do you know that? Did she tell you?
Er...
SHERLOCK
Fuck, Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
Go home, Dr. Watson. Spend time with your family.
Sherlock smiles slightly sinisterly.
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
Some arts event? An evening lecture series? John, it will take me all of ten minutes to scroll through the London events calendar to find it.
You left this upstairs.
"Yes, but... I still want to try," Sherlock replied, trying to keep the pleading out of his voice. John stood up from the booth and smiled fondly down at Sherlock.
Sherlock shifts his angles, methodically trying one after another.
You don't really want me --
The warden leaves. Mycroft and Sherlock sit down on the waiting room chairs.
Exactly.
(calmly)
It will happen someday.
The flashing lights and sirens, of course, Nazir! But nooo! Apparently, according to you, there are rules about such things. Why must you be so law-abiding?
(interrupting, happy to show off)
John finally gets in bed and Sherlock immediately turns to spoon him.
Control, turn off recording in waiting room 5B.
One year, Sherlock. A year to figure out that you've been in love with John Watson since your first meeting here in this very lab. I know. I was there. I never stood a chance, did I?
(gesturing to snacks)
How do you know he used an assumed name?
SHERLOCK
Oh, it most certainly counts.
John turns his head away shyly, but nods in response. Sherlock beams.
Sherlock nods in response and closes his eyes, trying to focus on John's movements and the carnal pleasure it is bringing him.
John thought about that for a moment and nodded.
So much dirt!
I will keep that in mind.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
TEACHER
I'll stay like this, face up. I like watching you work.
(See the end of the chapter for
My God, Sherlock!
NAZIR
Have an erection? Yes. Well, half of one now. I was trying to take care of it before you interrupted, thank you very much.
NAZIR
SHERLOCK
(furrowing brow)
DR HERSCHER
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Well, I'm not dead yet, Sherlock.
(nodding)
All three.
(fervently)
John enters the flat carrying Rosie. He looks around with a bright smile on his face. Sherlock enters, pleased as well. John heads to his chair, picks up the stuffed toys and shows them happily to Rosie. Sherlock looks even more pleased.
John wakes up with a start in his own bed.
So delicious...
(sighing)
SHERLOCK
Rosie toddles through the kitchen and into the back hallway.
Right. We'll start with the perineum.
“And so,” Sherlock said, rising from his chair with a small smile, “This one, in fact, will be our fourth.”
This is ridiculous. You are a bit sensitive, you know.
SHERLOCK
How much time, Molly? Give me a concrete figure, please.
John and Rosie climbed the stairs of 221B Baker Street for one of their monthly Saturday visits. The visits were ostensibly Mrs. Hudson's idea, as she insisted she couldn't go longer than a month without seeing her goddaughter Rosie, but John had his suspicions that Sherlock was behind it, or at least working in cahoots with the landlady. Honestly, John didn't know how to feel about it: the visits in general, seeing Sherlock, sensing that the man wanted to see John more than John wanted to see him. It wasn't that John didn't
Are you hungry? Let's get some breakfast.
SHERLOCK
(gasping)
John's praise stirs up both arousal and deep emotion in Sherlock. Sherlock's kisses on John's shoulders and neck get more desperate. He holds John to him even closer.
If you don't like It, I'll stop immediately. Please?
SHERLOCK
Is there anything I can do for YOU, Sherlock?
Oh, uh, there's a wall socket by the dresser.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John attempts to put his ear to Sherlock's chest but Sherlock puts up his hands to block him.
Really Mrs. Hudson, that's hardly necessary. John knows what I look like.
John gives him a deep kiss of fondness as he strokes Sherlock's penis more firmly.
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
(growing more upset)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock awoke from his reverie, finding himself once again in his leather chair at 221B Baker Street, in his proper timeline this time. He looked up at John curiously. John remained at his post standing behind his chair, possessing the same look of fear on his face, but a measure of hope had crept into his eyes as well.
SHERLOCK
(hollering)
John let's out a surprised and grateful laugh. Sherlock is pleased with his decision: this small joke, this final gift of laughter between John and himself before they never see each other again.
Oh God!
(pause)
We are NOT having this discussion here! In the middle of Tesco! Do you hear me?
A cosmetics firm as a cover for a cocaine processing plant, sounds pretty handy, don't you think? An unexpected raid causing them to dump their illicit product INTO their benign products...
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - TUESDAY MORNING
John moans in response.
Do you want to come like this, John? With me tonguing you, hm?
Telling this story over and over has become quite tiresome.
Mycroft feels a tug at his sleeve. He looks down at Rosie. John is nearby smiling.
Let's get that nappy changed, shall we, Rosie?
ROSIE (V.O.)
Very nice indeed.
(annoyed)
Well, sure, there's some arguing.
(big inhale)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
You purposely kept the relationship hidden from me, Sherlock. How long were you with Irene Adler?
John!
Research shows that intense sex can bring about a strong emotional release.
Mycroft, you were much more into the whole horse thing in your youth than I was... fancied yourself a knight on your charge. I wouldn't have bothered to remember two specific horses, let alone their names.
I don't know Sherlock, I've got to get Rosie to nursery--
It's not. Separating out our emotional attachment to each other --
Now for some pajama bottoms...
MONTAGE - "JOHN IS RANDY" [IMPLIED SMUT]
I don't find it unfair.
MOLLY
John idly plays with Sherlock's hair while they are both lost in thought. John's eyes suddenly fill with emotion. He exhales an erratic breath.
While you are up, can you retrieve my phone from the my bedroom?
(from upstairs)
How can I help? Shall I go get Rosie from the nursery?
My heart...
SHERLOCK
Mycroft straightens his suit.
Literal tools, John. Or, as they are more commonly known, "toys."
(sarcastically)
SHERLOCK
It's him!
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - SUNDAY MORNING
AUDREY
Pink one!
Not really.
Sherlock, just tap my arm or something when you want me to move again.
(gruffly)
You were the one that got married.
Unbelievable. Do they look at you strange when you drop off your dirty socks and sopping wet towels?
AUDREY
SHERLOCK
What is it? What did you find?
LESTRADE
Anal beads.
SHERLOCK
John begins eating but Sherlock still stares at him with suspicion.
I spend all day listening to people go on and on about their health problems... which reminds me, how are you feeling?
Rosie missed you, too.
I did not! That's a lie.
Sherlock?
JOHN (V.O.)
You're a good friend to him, Molly.
Okay.
So...
Ten minutes later, the two of them were in Sherlock's room, teeth cleaned, pajamas on, and ready for bed. John plugged in his phone and a baby monitor on the side table, and then got into bed next to Sherlock. Sherlock turned off the lights.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John leans over and plants a hand next to Sherlock's ribcage to brace himself. He uses his other hand to help guide himself into Sherlock's anus. He presses the tip in and they both let out a gasp in unison. Sherlock grasps onto John's forearm.
(wiping his lip with a finger)
God, John!
(gently)
SHERLOCK
Absolutely not.
Irene composes herself and exits soon after.
(smirking)
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
Audrey shakes her head no.
INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
In here!
SHERLOCK
Please do.
Mary and John stand before Sherlock and Mycroft on the tarmac by a small plane. Some security officers and vehicles standby. Sherlock is about to board the plane, on what can only be considered a suicide mission.
SHERLOCK
Unbelievable.
(giggling)
Oh God, Sherlock. You feel absolutely amazing. I'm so full like this.
Mrs. Hudson enters with a tray of snacks.
I would know.
Sherlock sips some tea and grabs yet another biscuit. John looks on disapprovingly.
I dislike this imbalance in the relationship SO much. We can't go about with him potentially in love with me and me not reciprocating.
(thoughtful pause)
Shut up and take me home, Gordon!
MRS HUDSON
(picking up his clothing from floor)
So sorry about that. I apologize Sherlock. Here, share my umbrella.
SHERLOCK
Okay, bye.
Sherlock and Lestrade stand on the porch and ring the bell. Sherlock impatiently rings it a second time and Lestrade rolls his eyes.
SHERLOCK
One more question.
SHERLOCK
(feeling her forehead)
John followed his suggestion, sitting down heavily on the sofa.
SHERLOCK
(throwing head back)
Both men stare into the middle distance, remembering the moment acutely.
SHERLOCK
(bristling)
What are you doing?
How did you know?
John obeys and Sherlock carefully strips him of his shirt, tossing it with the jumper. Standing behind John, Sherlock spread his hands across John's strong compact back, exploring, observing. John is stock still, taking in the sensation of Sherlock's touch. Sherlock's eyes focus on the scar on John's left shoulder.
Sherlock... I'm coming soon... please, a little faster. Sherlock.
(embarrassed)
John strips off his and Rosie's raincoats and wellies and hangs them to dry.
(frowning deeply)
Yep. All good up until you open your bloody mouth, that is.
Sherlock looks down and gestures at John's new erection in surprise.
(surprised)
Not buying it, you stole her phone.
SHERLOCK
INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sorry?
Separating out the emotional attachment?!
SHERLOCK
You let me comfort you. Hold you even. I said "it is what it is."
Sherlock, can you bring over the dirty plates from the table, please?
SHERLOCK
You should get that, it's probably the clinic.
customer—a regular who comes weekly and knows
Sherlock sadly takes John's phone out of his pocket and places it gently on the coffee table. Sherlock watches John sleep another moment, considering things before heading to his own bedroom.
Oh my God! Can you stop being a hopeless romantic for one second and entertain the idea that Sherlock Holmes is NOT in love with me?
SHERLOCK
Yes, we need medics at 221b Baker Street. Possible heart attack. Please hurry!
