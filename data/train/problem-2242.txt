There is a knock on the door and John gets up to go and welcome the third Lestrade. He finds himself in the presence of a young woman with a sad expression, covered by long straight hair dyed black.
<< Do you mind if I analyze another sample by myself? >> he asks, receiving an even more surprised look.
<< Ms Ford's new course started in January. Since March, episodes that could be defined as stolkerage have started. Episodes that Mr Ford has completely ignored but that Ms Ford took into great consideration. To the point of trying to save her son in case the stalker physically enters their home. Ms Ford was scared, because she understood that someone stalkers her. The same person that  killed the family dog. The same that destroyed the windows with a stone wrapped in a sheets of paper carrying a messages for her unknown to us. The same that terrified her with continuous anonymous telephone rings >>.
Sherlock takes one of Morgan's nibbled balls, abandoned on his armchair. He twirls it in his hands and sits down. John imitates him by taking his place.
Sherlock grabs the 'parrot', saing a tested and submissive 'Thank you'. The woman turns away to give him a moment of privacy. Not even his mother and all the nannies Sherlock has had, have managed to get so much from him and in such a short time.
John goes to get the first aid kit in his bag and takes care of Sherlock’s injuries with a safe hand. Sherlock sets an unspecified point before him and is too silent.
<< At 10 in the morning! I think I should be satisfied with how my tax money is spent if the government starts its important job so early >> John turns around, ready to walk the room in the opposite direction. The door opens leaving in mid-air.
<< If there is nothing between you and your flatmate, you will not have anything against it if I try to become more 'intimate' with him >> the ex soldier had told John a few minutes after meeting Sherlock. John stomach tightened at the idea that someone, especially someone like Bryan, might have the intention of flirting with his flatmate. Yet he did not object, by citing his interest in the consultant.
<< This is impossible, doctor? >> exclaims Hataway. << You also saw where the car was and I can't believe that someone would risk their lives to help a stranger or to rob him >>.
<< Yes >> John whispers, who wants to think of everything except that evening, especially at this moment.
John knocks on the front door and at the same time he feels himself an idiot. John opens it slowly without waiting for an answer and finds Sherlock sitting in his armchair, his eyes closed and his hands joined under his chin. John takes advantage of his flatmate's stay in his Mind Palace to quickly look around. There isn't the backpack in the kitchen and there isn't the guitar at the foot of the sofa. Only many notebooks and sheets of different types of paper bearing drawings and sketches scattered almost everywhere. They must surely be Rosaline Jackson's drawings, diligently delivered by Lestrade's men.
<< The sauna master, however, does not convince me >> said Lestrade, who, although he is part of the idiots, must recognize a particular intuition for him.
<< She has been determined >> Sherlock says, the hands joined to the chin in that reflective and calm pose that indicates the frenetic work of his brain. << She first traced the drawing, sitting at the desk using that red pen >> he says, pointing to the girl's work surface, where the pen pointing towards the body, like an arrow. << Then she retraced the line with the razor blade. It was a slow, painful job, yet she didn't stop. She managed to complete the work diligently before being seized by the weakness of bleeding >>.
The documents were in what was that woman's bedroom. A room that does not have to be very different from the one where Mary are sleeping now. A simple bed, a small wardrobe, an old desk, few personal effects, few clothes and all worn and many years old. Mary Abbott gives the idea of never having had anything. Nothing except five dolls. The dolls stood next to each other on the window sill. Porcelain dolls with ancient and well-worked clothes, with glazed eyes, pink cheeks and heart-shaped lips. Needless to say, they contributed to making the environment even more disturbing. These dolls must have been Mary's companions in those long days spent isolated from all sentient life. John's heart had tightened and he hadn't understood how he could feel tenderness and pain for the woman who almost killed the man he loves.
<< Sherlock would not be the case we went home? Greg should have already sent you the drawings of the girl >> John exclaims, crossing his arms over his chest, intimately annoyed by Sherlock's attitude.
<< Don't waste your breath on him, John >> advises him the consultant. << Giles, here is the address of this woman. I don't think I have to tell you what to do now. If the chief does not trust my dog's nose, you can get everyone else to contact and send someone to do the inspections. Of course, you will waste a lot of time, but if it is for the sake of traditional methods ... >>.
The burning of tears comes back to his eyes, but he pushes it away. He opens his eyes and meets John's gaze that appear infinitely sad.
<< Sherlock! >> John calls him, who does not find it very appropriate to take sides of one parent rather than the other.
<< Exactly! Here's what struck me about her. Her face wrapped in a scarf and huge hands held in gloves kept coming back to my mind. Even in a dream ... >> John stops abruptly at the memory of what then turned into a nightmare. << Sherlock is there, Mycroft. That woman found him and God only knows why she didn't say anything >>.
<< That woman >> says Mycroft, ending his silence. John barely sharpens his hearing. << She had a nervous breakdown, or so they said. She sent three guards to the hospital, one of whom is dying. They managed to contain her only after they shot her with calming bullets >>.
Morgan jumps on the bed barking. He grew a lot in these three months and his paws are not more such cute balls, but real uncontrolled weapons. The crazy thing that is their dog nibbles their elbows and pulls away the sheet. His personal way to say them that is time to get up.
<< Too fast >> Mr Holmes repeats seriously. << So is this what I should explain to those who should ask me the reason about my son's behavior? I should tell them he's not a drug addict, but that he only uses cocaine to stop his mind too fast? >> Mr Holmes thunders, clapping his hands on the desk. The impact creates a gloomy sound, which Sherlock still hears now ringing in his chest.
<< Yes, I recovered it and kept it here >> says William, opening the first drawer of the desk. He rummages in it and pulls out a sealed pouch with the piece of cloth inside. << I saw it done in the movies. The sachet was new. I hope it did not contaminate the test >>.
<< I don't see what else it could. I mean, you have a reputation to being with women on three continents! >>.
<< Our daughter attends art school. She has always loved drawing, since she was a child. She has notebooks full of her drawings and is organizing a portfolio to be able to take them around publishing houses, fairs and in all those places where it is possible for a young artist to present her work >> says the mother with a whisper.
<< I didn't see him in the face. I could not keep my eyes open, my head was so dizzy. I only remember his hand on my wrist. The left one. He has a stain right here, on the wrist >>.
The presence of this version of Mary alerted him at the beginning. Over time, however, and with the succession of sudden awakenings, Sherlock got used to her, to her smiles, to her cares, that reassured him a lot. He told her his dreams feeling the need to speak and Mary listened to him kidnapped, like a little girl listening to a fairy tale before going to sleep. Except that Sherlock's stories are not fairy tales. Those dreams are shreds of his childhood. The brutality of his father. The death of his mother. The absence continues of his brother and his way to made fun of him. Bullying suffered at school.
<< I wasn't expecting anything like this when I left Morgan with William >> Sherlock whispers, looking at the road.
John shakes hands in one another. Curl his nose several times, while shifting weight from one foot to the other. They did not expect anything like this. Indeed, things seemed to be taking a positive turn for Mary. In particular, John did not expect to witness what is happening and that leaves him stone, unable to say and do anything.
<< Immunity is given to me by the simple fact that whatever that woman can say or do ... simply does not exist for me. Who does not exist cannot harm me >>.
He suddenly stops at the entrance to the tube. A couple of people send him to hang out for that sudden arrest, but he doesn't mind. John sees Sherlock standing in an alley not far away. He is not alone. The person he is talking to, however, is in the shade.
<< Exactly, and from June to December of last year the roads that connect this area with those two cities have been closed for works. The newspapers have spoken for months about the protests of the local hoteliers for the bad season that this inconvenience caused them. There are no other beaten roads that connect the pit with those cities and this leads us to exclude them with a 98% probability. We could always deal with a serial killer so self-confident to go around Bassenthwaite to reach Penrith and from there go down. I don't want to limit human madness >>.
John looks up from the flyer and turns to the beautiful woman who looks at him smiling from the table behind him.
John sighs. It annoys him to have to agree with her. John sits on the sofa and absently looks at the object that triggered the quarrel. How many times has he found himself sharing a bed with a friend? What's wrong, then, if two men both sleep in a bed. Sherlock, in fact, doesn't sleep when he works. No. John is wrong. He's giving Sherlock reason and taking all the blame for himself and that's not fair. Sherlock wants to be a drama queen? That it is!
John looks at the board on which he pinned all the information he managed to obtain in these four days of research.
<< December 10, 1999. Reginald Connery. 38 years old. Unmarried. No living relative. Exposed fracture of tibia and fibula. Withdraw £ 20,000 from his checking account and 4 well-listed stocks. Settled on December 30, 1999 >>.
Mary gently takes Sherlock's right hand, tight on the shawl, and holds it between hers, so unexpectedly warm. She nods, inviting him to open up.
George takes his cell phone out of his jeans pocket, fiddles over it looking for something and then shows it to them. << I think you know this. Dad told me that the girl's family has entrusted the case to you. This, however, is what I know >> he says, sliding his finger on the screen of the smartphone, to show a previous image of the same design.
"Of course you could have warned me," he thinks, going back to the living room. John stops beside his armchair and looks up at the sofa. He must admit to himself that at this time Sherlock has a valid reason for not giving news of himself.
<< Ok, ok, I understand that at the moment the landlord is him, but I have a kidnapping investigation in progress and I already have an arrogant child to bear. Two are definitely too much! Sherlock, the chief commissioner are coming. I give you ten minutes, not one more. I want to know all you think is going on. It's an order! >>.
<< Sherlock, are you listening to me? >> John's authoritarian tone arouses Sherlock from his thoughts.
Greg takes the pager out of his pocket and checks it. << I have to go. I'll wait for you at the Cooper house, Sherlock, okay? >> he says, reaching the door. The consultant nods and with a gesture from the chief the detective greets and descends the stairs. As soon as the door is closed, Sherlock leaps to his feet and starts pacing back and forth across the living room, his hands clasped under his chin.
<< You are one of them, aren't you? I lost my boots to pick up a godless gay >> growls, grabbing Sherlock's the neck. Sherlock puts his too weak hands on the big and strong one of the woman and tries in every way to free himself.
They take their leave of him, who takes them back to the lift smiling cordially, until the doors close.
<< In case it serves, our government will be happy to make itself useful by making available its ... means of persuasion >> says Mycroft and it is really strange to see him so willing to help others.
<< I see a woman almost one meter and eighty tall, with thick and muscular limbs as I happened to see them only in men who are used to splitting wood. She has a square face, a broad forehead and very fine hair held tight in a tail that makes her head seem even bigger. When she wore the fur hat I struggled to define its gender. The hat is old, although it is well kept, as are all the other clothes she wears. A clean person, nothing to say, but scruffy. She was cold. She continues to pull up her scarf to cover her cheeks reddened by the cold. She wears a pair of leather gloves that, although they are large, for men, are small for the huge hands that she finds himself. Hey… wait a moment >>.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims, drawing his attention. The man laughs. A terrible laugh. He turns slowly, still clutching the knife.
<< This place is full of cameras >> says Sherlock, who pulled up his sleeves and unbuttoned two more buttons of his shirt. << There is one at each entrance >> indicates them. << But there can only be one place where there aren't >>.<< The changing rooms >> John nods, snatching a satisfied smile from Sherlock.<< Exactly >> he says, going to the men's locker room. << Stay there still and don't touch anything! >> intimate them entering.
<< Guys, come on, get out of here. Go home and do your homework! >> order to them Greg, pointing the door. The two young Lestrade abandon the 221B one still red, the other crawling their feet. When he hears them go down the steps, Greg approaches Fox.
push yourself to suicide. They do it with all those deemed dangerous for the real purposes of the portal >>.
<< So either from Castlerigg or from St. Johns in the Vale. Maybe even from Keswick or Threlkeld >>.
<< Why? >> he asks, amazed by this characteristic that unites them. Although he, in truth, sleeps little not never.
The rest of Sherlock is something too big to be supported in its entirety. The sensuality that shines through every movement when he lets himself be carried away by the music he plays and composes. The rapid movements that make him so similar to a hound when he follows the track during the investigation. The rigidity in moments of embarrassment or uncertainty and the laxity of the endless days of boredom. John would go crazy if he took all these things together. For this reason, his attention always goes to these three elements: eyes, lips and hands.
Sherlock grabs the fork and realizes that he is weak enough to struggle to hold it in his hand. Pinch a potato taking a significant amount of time and bring it to his mouth.
<< Oh yes! >> Mary replies, as he expected << They are good to me. They could have killed me, they always said it, and instead they never did it >> laughs cheerfully. << You, on the other hand, don't love your dad, do you? >>.
<< I know, and I admire you for this. Two days have passed since we found the car and, despite the research, we have not come to the head of anything >> sighs Greg, passing his hand over his tired face.
A painful stab pierces John's stomach who barely holds back a moan. He brings his hand to his aching belly and Sherlock turns to him with a strange expression of frowning concern. John try to reassure him, by sketching a smile, which however has no effect.
<< The certainty came when we compared the messages sent to the children who committed suicide with those received by Daisy Cooper, Rosaline Jackson and Elisabeth Lestrade >> says Fox.
<< Sure. First of all the duty and then ... sorry, bad choice of words >> chuckles to dissolve the tension always so palpable between them.
<< No, Greg >> sighs again. << Alcohol has nothing to do with it. Not the way you think, at least >> John just glances at the detective. Greg watches him for a long time and though John keeps his eyes down he can imagine his left eyebrow arching as he tries to make sense of his words.
<< Thank you, Inspector >> John says, holding out his hand. The man squeezes it in passing and then goes to the car.
John'a abdomen is contracted. What this Mary-child telling him in tears it is terrible. He turns his gaze to the guard, looking for support, but finds only a grim and disinterested look in that woman. The doctor realizes how serious the situation is. More serious than he imagined.
John only now realizes the deep affection and mutual respect that exists between the detective and the consultant. Although Sherlock constantly gives Greg an idiot, by never guessing his name, and Greg questions Sherlock's deductions, by screaming at him against the worst things, their balance is perfect.
<< Yes, Billy, I  struggle too to accept that nothing ever escapes to him >> says John, chuckling. << Let's see the war wounds, soldier! >>.
The woman slowly hits John's hand and snatches him from his thoughts. John sketches a smile ready to reply with a laconic 'Yes, of course', but he stops. Her impeccably made-up eyes show a clear nuisance, equal to what John felt for the whole day spent together in front of her continuous talk.
A strange atmosphere has arisen. John feels it on his skin, like a kind of warm and protective hug. As absurd as it may seem, it all seems to be born from the change of Mycroft, imperceptible to the naked eye but felt by the belly and skin.
<< I authorized him to help us >> says Greg with perhaps a little too much emphasis. He doesn't like Mycroft's seraphic and feignedly friendly being. << Mycroft, I ask you to allow Fox and his team to try to destroy that portal. It is not enough for me to have brought in prison those who risked pushing my daughter to commit suicide. I want to prevent those who created that abomination from reaping other innocent victims >>.
Sherlock gets up from the sofa laughing, with the laptop in his hand. He staggers on shaky legs and John is already afraid of seeing him collapse on the ground, destroy the computer and maybe even break himself something .
Sherlock does not reply, which is unusual. He reaches the trays and lifts the first lid. Smell the air and wrinkle his nose.
<< Tomorrow the three men are at work in the morning. Only one of them, however, will be present at the Aufguss session, just like today, and it is not said to be him >>.
<< Because he's wrong, it's true. He has committed an ignoble lightness, but he sincerely cares about you, Sherlock >>.
<< Especially for him >> John underlines, glaring Martin with his eyes. << However, it would be better if you go to the hospital, Sherlock >> John says, turning to him a clinical and worried look.
John hears Sherlock laugh. A free and cheerful laugh that Sherlock rarely allows himself and that John had deluded himself that the consultant dedicated only to him. The punk in turn laughs and hands him the cigarette again. No, it definitely cannot be simple tobacco. When Sherlock gives it back to him, the man grabs his wrist, the same one that John squeezed. He seems to be asking him something and when Sherlock minimizes the man turns on. John tends his ears, hoping that the wind is favorable and brings him some excerpt of conversation. Unfortunately, however, the air is still and John must be content with looking and he doesn't likes what he sees. Sherlock seems to be saddened by the punk's excited words. He shakes his head, dejected, and the punk reassures him by caressing his face. The consultant gladly accepts that cuddle, as well as the man'sface that comes closer to his more and more. Although John only sees the back of the punk's neck, who impales his flatmate's face, what he is doing is eloquent.
<< Oh, really? >> the woman happily asks him, changing her attitude completely. She sits on the chair, planting her elbows over her knees and her square chin in her cupped hands. << Tell me >> she says and Sherlock's stomach closes in terror.
surrounded by his  black curls. John sighs, lost in contemplation of his beautiful flatmate. The puppy wakes him up from his (not entirely innocent) dreams with his eyes open, nibbling his fingers.
<< I'm also afraid of losing you, Sherlock >> John whispers, looking at those big hands. << I had it when I saw you here with that boy. When I saw you by chance in that alley with what I believe to be Peter and now ... I'm afraid that for fear of something happening to me because of Moriarty you can decide to go away from me >> John says, raising his eyes to meet those of Sherlock, full of emotion. << You didn't save only Lizzy from suicide, you know? >>.
<< Chocolate and cream? >> repeats evaluating the proposal. He doesn't care, he notes. << Why not? >> he says sketching a smile, just to make her happy. That's how he sees her reacting to his words. With happyness, in fact.
<< I can't believe you don't have even the slightest idea. Three or four always come straight to your minde! >>.
<< He treated me like a whore, Mycroft. You can not even imagine how it feels >> he whispers, the voice broken by tears that strives to tame.
<< I should make you a list of things you do not know about me, John >> says Sherlock and the doctor notices in his voice a strange tone that could define mischievous. << What are you waiting for, get undressed >> adds Sherlock and John embarrassment reaches peaks so far never reached. << Will we spend the next few days shooting half-naked between strangers and are you having trouble changing in front of me? >>.
The man leaves the room at the same time as the cell phone notifies John of the arrival of a message. John remains motionless, as if he had heard the click from a weapon aimed at him. John approaches the phone uncertainly and looks at it for a long time before picking it up. A message from Sherlock and the stomach contracts.
John does not know what is going inside his partner's belly, but he feels that this case has gone to touch old and out of tune strings. What Sherlock said to William, after Milton's arrest, confirmed John's hypothesis. He would like to ask Sherlock many questions, but he knows he won't ask for anything. John'll wait for him to want to talk, if he'll ever wants to do it, and if he doesn't, it will be fine.
John had kept those documents in his hands. Simple lined notebooks with hard cover. Its had seemed innocuously packed with the data of a first note. Only when John had brought attention to what had been noted in it, did he even feel like breathing.
<< Do we want to go? >> Mycroft asks the three men with the same tone of false courtesy. They follow him on the road, where the dark car is waiting for them. Anthea waits for them diligently at the car door and John finds himself, despite himself, sitting between the consultant and the journalist. The short journey proceeds in a silence made of gazes and silent conversations that completely cut off John, who feels uncomfortable and out of place.
<< No, Mycroft. Mary would have brought him to Hataway as soon as possible >> John intrudes. << Her family killed people who were alone. If Sherlock had told her that he had been sent there for an investigation, she would not even have tried to rob and kill him, as his family used to do. Finding herself teased has infuriated her >>.
<< Oh. What's happened? >> here is the inevitable grip on the maternal and female protective side. John usually pats himself on the shoulder mentally when he manages to attack from that front. This time, however, Annette's hand immediately placed on his hand annoys him. John must make a real effort not to retract it.
<< What kind of job? >> she asks, observing him wary. Sherlock decides to continue playing the role of the fictional character who invented when he reached the Lake District Ski Club undercover. Such a woman may not like the idea of having a consulting detective at home.
"Not yet, but you're almost there" Moriarty chuckles, standing on the edge of the pit. His hands in his pockets, his dark glasses covering his empty eyes and his mocking smile on his lips. "It's nice to die, Sherlock" Moriarty says, jumping into the pit. "Nobody comes to bother you," he adds shrugging. "Look at all these corpses," he says, pointing with his finger at the corpses around them. “They have remained quiet and safe here for sooooo much years. Then, yes, people came to disturb them, in fact, but their situation is also unusual, don't you think? ”.
<< Obviously >> echoes John. << I don't have a photo with me, but we can retrieve it from my blog >>.
<< That's how it goes >> Sherlock growls, holding her still. A loud snap announces the breaking of Sharon's arm. She pass out due the strong pain.
<< Mycroft said you're his favorite Holmes >> says John, trying not to show how important that information is to him.
<< I don't doubt it. However, I am obliged to notify social assistance when there are minors involved in a case >>.
The plans for the new ski resort include the construction of a 5-star hotel, a restaurant and an equipped area near the station from which the chairlifts will depart. Hugh Paddington is an ambitious man who has done his counts well and does not want that in any way those bodies found during the excavations could hinder his plans. He contacted Sherlock precisely to entrust him with the case, since the local authorities gave orders that nothing was touched until the investigation was resolved. The consultant accepted the case, finding it fascinating from the first words spoken by that arrogant and careerist man.
<< No, stay here >> John whispers, putting the puppy back down. He jumps back onto the bed and John, tired from the walk they've done, brings his hand to his eyes, just like he usually does in front of Sherlock's follies.
<< Fear of him >> repeats Greg amazed. << That he wanted something more? A recognized relationship? >>.
Their looks meet for a long moment. John shivers in front of those eyes of ice so serious and severe on him and in response he wears the captain's uniform, stiffening his body ready for battle.
<< The trust you place in this group of investigative journalists is admirable. I must admit that although I do not approve of your methods, I recognize you are capable of carrying out excellent investigations, to the point that I could propose to hire you. Too bad that I, unlike my brother, don't trust journalists. "Nunca confìes en un periodista
<< Apparently, Mr. Holmes! >> says George, moving nervously on the chair. << When Lizzy told me about it, I went for a ride and it didn't seem so bad. Later, however, I saw her get worse. At the beginning, she spoke continuously of the tutor who had been entrusted to her on the site. She had a crush with him and I tought that it was a good thing. At least it was something vivifying. Then the invitations began to arrive >>.
An even more acute cry than the previous ones startles the consultant. Slowly Sherlock continue his walk. Go through the gate, crawling through the space that is already open. He doesn't want to move it. He can't stand his screeching squeak.
<< Completely wrong >> retorts John. << Greg is not a pusher of investigations for Sherlock, but a friend >>.
<< Ours is a mutual exchange of needs >> Greg replies, turning his gaze to Sherlock who reciprocates him. << Sherlock needs unusual cases and trust and I need help to solve them. I allow him not to have to resort to ... external chemical agents to eradicate boredom; Sherlock avoide to make my liver rotten not knowing where to go banging his head to get out of certain situations. We save each other's ass, in short >> chuckles and Sherlock smiles in turn.
Apparently, John and Mrs. Hudson worried in vain when they realized that they would both be missing from 221B for part of their respective commitments. Ms Hudson visiting her sister and John engaged in that boring course. Apparently, the consultant must have decided to take the opportunity and fly away in turn to who knows what shores.
In anger, Sheron destroys the other wall lamp and open with a kicks the door of William's bedroom. Check under the bed and a noise coming from the closet catches her attention. She smiles satisfied and leans the baseball bat on her shoulder.
<< Little boy, the men of the scientific departmentare are looking for clues in the living room. I could not make you run around at your leisure >>.
<< Nothing, forget it >> John says, letting his hands slide along Sherlock's back, hot and wet with sweat .
John takes a deep breath realizing that he has been in apnea for the whole long Mycroft's monologue. He returned to that cold winter evening in which he saved his first life: the life of his sister. John was the same age as George and, like him, he was scared to death. Despite the terror, however, he had used the first aid lessons learned in school and had induced her sister to vomit the countless pills that she had take with an exaggerated amount of alcohol. Harriet, just 18, was exhausted by the accusations of her mother, by the people's gossips, by the bullying she suffered in school. She, so apparently strong, had collapsed revealing the fragile soul that still characterizes her today. That soul that made it difficult for her to separate from the bottle for so long. Maybe only now, finally, the strength of the past has returned to her allowing her to get back on her feet. Now that their parents are no hurt her. Now that there are no more classmates that accuse her of being indecent and monstrous. Now that, perhaps, the world is starting to be more open to all forms of love.
<< It is a tempting proposal, Mr. Holmes >> to laugh at the woman. << I will use it, however, as a last resort. It will be a real pleasure for me to invite you to dinner as soon as I have settled home >>.
Sherlock is struck by this last sentence. A different perspective which he had not yet taken into consideration opens up before him. He now understands what his mother meant by those simple words. "Love saves", she said, and now Sherlock seems to understand that the first thing from that save is by themselves. From the distorted idea that you have of yourself. From the beginning, John has shown enthusiasm in front of Sherlock's deductions, giving him the opportunity to appreciate them himself in a genuine and not ostentatious way in defense of the negative judgment of others. Now the doctor has told him how unattractive and idiotic he think to be, which is light years away from what he really is. Sherlock knows about John self-esteem problems, but that they were so marked he hadn't understood.
<< Mary, dear, are you all right? >> he asks her, just leaning towards her. Suddenly the woman comes to life, moving with a speed that is not expected of a person of her size.
<< Have you never dealt with a furious woman, Sherlock? >> John asks him. The consultant thinks about it for a few moments. More than once he seems to be about to respond and then falls again into reflective silence.
"She is reasoning without becoming catatonic" Sherlock notes, fascinated by this new and unusual thing, but fortunately without danger and pain.
<< Those are nice side effects >> he admits, doing shrugs. << I am not pissed because since you moved with Sherlock to 221 B you have removed a significant amount of stress from over my shoulders. I no longer have to worry about chasing Sherlock to get answers to my messages or to know where he ended up and where he is with the investigations, because I just have to ask you. And you promptly answer me. I no longer have to worry about him being too cold and direct with the witnesses or relatives of the victims or with my men, because you just have to glance at him and he gets in line. I no longer have to fight to make Sherlock accept a case, because, in order not to see him fall prey to boredom, you persuade him to give me a hand and within an hour everything is done. I owe you the well-being of my liver and my coronaries, John, and for this reason I cannot be pissed off for the loss of commendations, promotions and economic bonuses >>.
<< What do you owe it to? >> asks John amazed. << Shouldn't you already know of it, as everything about your brother and anyone else is under your strict control? >> growls nervously, shifting the weight from one foot to the other.
<< Yes, he approached her. Peter is very good with words. He hasn't convinced her yet, though, but I'm confident. I still give him some time >>.
<< This is just a hypothesis, Greg, and I don't like not having at all certainties! >> John says, standing up again. << Jesus, how is it possible that, after the first ten years of the new millennium, there are still problems in communicating because of the weather? >> blurts out, kicking a chair. From behind the venetian blinds, pulled down but open, John sees the agents peeking at what is happening in their boss's office. They are curious to see the usually calm and patient doctor alter, since there is not even the 'freak' to justify his behavior.
“Of course, because you doesn't get involved. A one-night adventure and then everyone on their way. "
<< It wasn't my idea >> says the man, turning his accusing gaze to the consultant. << But you've already understood that, Dr. Watson. I am of the opinion that ,in the face of desperate situations, acting in the shadows, hiding what is being experienced to the friends, is both more harmful and beneficial. The lie deteriorate the  relationships, my dear Holmes, not the truth and you should know it >> Fox scolds the two brothers, who close in an unusual mutism.
<< How can you implore me by showing off your lie, damn wanker with no respect! >> she shouts, putting more emphasis in her shake. Sherlock force himself to not vomit all the lunches he has been forced to eat in these days.
<< Sharon Milton is a 23 year old young woman. She works as a warehouse worker at Tesco in the night shift and spends the day partly sleeping, I guess, and partly at this pc, writing his delusions. O'Hara is one of her favorite authors and is a well-known mystery writer. Her best-known best seller is 'Mater misericordiae' and there are even three copies in the library: the cheap one, the first one she purchased and the most consumed by countless and repetitive readings; the reprint to celebrate the million copies sold and the gold one, that she will surely have presented to her favorite writer to have it autographed. I would say that it is elementary to deduce that the pc password of this crazy girl of ours can only be the title of her favorite book >>.
Mycroft wears a brown coat that goes down to cover him up to the ankles. The hands, protected by leather gloves of the same color, are resting on the inevitable umbrella. A burgundy scarf protects his throat from the cold and loosens it just when he sees them coming.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims. << I don't want she know what happened! Nobody needs to know, ok? >> cries and new tears fall from Sherlock's eyes and do not stop, despite his attempts.
<< Your hands would never hurt me >> he whispers sleepily and a sweet smile as a child is drawn on his lips.
John stifles a laugh, bringing his hand to cover his lips. Note a similarity in the tone of the voice, in the expression and in the way the boy moves ... but he puts it away shaking his head. Sherlock glares at him.
<< In fact, it is a little long >> he stammers, bringing his hand to the face, covered by the unkempt beard of almost a week.
Finally the woman lets him go and Sherlock noisily sucks large mouthfuls of air, massaging his throat. A thousand bright dots blur his sight and a long and continuous whistle echoes in his ears.
Sherlock looks at the footprints in the snow. The man was not alone with his assassin. There are other footprints, smaller, some very small.
"Please, please, please!" Sherlock thinks intensely, his hands clenched into fists. The woman wakes up and throws the razor on Sherlock's lap. Fortunately, the reflexes, although slowed down, still work and allow him to move his left arm away just before the blade hits him. Sherlock dares not imagine what would have happened if the blade had cut him. With a razor in hand, Mary's explosion of anger could only end in a very tragic way for Sherlock.
<< Because they discovered that you are the daughter of the best Scotland Yard's detective currently in charge >> Sherlock replies. Greg and Lizzy look at him in amazement.
The door opens and the violent light that enters the darkness in which he is trapped snatches Sherlock from its Mind Place.
Sherlock glances at the man and John realizes that they are communicating without opening their mouths. A series of small nods and expressions just mentioned, those that never escape the insightful sight of the consultant and apparently also that of Fox.
<< Because it wasn't just an adventure for me, Greg! >> he blurts out, standing up, leaving the detective with his mouth open for the third time. << I am also ... in love with him >> whispers, bringing a hand to his mouth, as to keep hidden a secret too big even to pronounce. << That ... wow, it was already crazy what had happened. Hearing him say those words ... seeing him so serene and at peace ... it was too much. Too much for me. I ... I felt I didn't deserve it and ... >>.
John invites Sherlock to follow their client. His gaze is uncompromising. Sherlock snorts, looks up to the sky but obeys. They enter the lift and the director takes a key from the pants pocket and inserts it in the lock on the button panel. The lift moves slowly to the top of the six floors of this super luxury hotel. The corridor in which the doors open is illuminated by many fan-shaped wall lights, which cast yellow beams of light on the white walls. This creating a contrast with the burgundy carpet that the consultant dislikes. The temperature, however, is definitely cooler.
<< You are the best and only consultant detective, I expect to spend hours there not days >> retorts, entering the bathroom again.Sherlock snorts and walks nervously back and forth.
<< I ... I still apologize for that >> John says, looking away. << I guess Fox didn't like this. He thought that I was the a man prone to violence >>.
<< Well, he can do very well without us >> says Sherlock, sitting down in his chair. Morgan crouches on Sherlock's feet and
Sherlock also says nothing. What could there be to say? There is no trace of the child-Mary in that rough statue that looks at him sternly.
<< No, I've never prostituting miself. Not even when it would have been convenient for me to be >> whispers, staring at the inert cocoon.
<< What was different? >> asks John, who is struggling to withstand the tension generated by having just mentioned the name of Moriarty.
<< I met Mary >> the doctor tells him regaining his attention. << I thought that there was a logical sense if you woult like to have to help her. I went to her house yesterday and I found many notebooks like this >> he says, handing one of the documents to Sherlock. The latter sits up and leafs through the notebook.
<< Sherlock, I also live in this house, don't you think he has the right to have my idea about it? >>.
<< A 16 year old girl took her own life, God only knows why, Sherlock. Any human being with a minimum of empathy would be emotionally involved >>.
The old man explains with difficulty what he feels. The right hand at stomach level is a pained expression in which John finds himself. From the visit, John hypothesizes the presence of a gastric ulcer, which joins the hiatal hernia and Crohn's disease located at the height of the colon.
<< Nobody will know anything, Sherlock, you have my word >> he promises and Sherlock nods, knowing he can trust his doctor.
<< Leave me! >> growls Sharon and she is so full of energy that it is difficult to keep it against the wall.
<< I'm sorry, Mycroft >> says John awkwardly, patting him on the shoulder. Mycroft doesn't even seem to notice. He looks at his brother with such intensity that he frightens the doctor. Although his face is impassive, Mycroft's eyes contains all his despair.
<< I have not connoted, but simply observed. Yes, be surprised! >> John chuckles in turn. << I don't understand why this strange game you are playing, where it seems you want to reduce a friend to a simple useful object >>.
<< You do not see what ... >> John blurts, raising his hands to heaven. << Do you want me to believe that while a stranger was sleeping in your bed you were awake working on the case? >>.
<< Not someone encouraged by you, this time >> Sherlock mumbles, trying to stand up. The leg, however, does not hold him and he falls into Moriarty's arms.
"I will be useless and strange, but for a fuck I am more than good, right?" John would like to tell her, but he bites his tongue trying to be kind in spite of everything.
Sherlock left the Ski Club at three in the afternoon on November 10th. The storm began half an hour later, with an hour ahead of the forecasts. It takes an hour to reach the police command from the Club and therefore, taking into account the road conditions, the car Sherlock was driving and his driving style, John deduced (thanks to Mycroft's infallible mathematical calculations) that Sherlock's car accident occurred around 3.40 pm. The streets were already whitewashed, but not yet completely impassable. John tried to understand who could have gone there, assuming that, given the season, they could have been only locals. That track, however, was a hole in the water. All the people whom John and Mycroft asked if they passed by that road, sayed that they was there but either long before or long after the time found.
<< Oh, what poultice you are! Come on here! >> the woman says loudly, taking the fork from his hands. << Starts from the broth >> she says, fishing a piece of chicken from the bottom of the other dish. She pulls it up and pushes it violently into Sherlock's mouth.
<< It was enough for me to read the titles of the chronology and the source. I don't look at that stuff! >>.
John is amazed at Sherlock's sensible and adult speech. The boy shakes his head in annoyance and clenches his fists, giving the idea of not having acepted what he has been told at all.
<< Why idiot, John? Not very careful because of alcohol and in a situation that I don't envy you at all, but why an idiot? >>.
"You fear that if you bringing women here, they might be interested in him by forgetting you, isn't it?" Harry continues in her hateful tone. John nods and runs his hand over his disconsolate face.
Without deigning John a glance Sherlock closes himself in the bathroom, leaving the doctor there with his paranoia and that answer so difficult to find. John cannot live peacefully despite people's judgments. It is a limit for him, perhaps, but it is a situation to which he must find a solution and, as soon as possible, too.Sherlock comes out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe tied at the waist.
<< Thank you >> he smiles, stamps the badge and disappears beyond the door. John walks to the tube, with one hand on the hip and the doubt of having to start worrying about these sudden pains.
<< I don't know who the fault is anymore, Mycroft. I only see what is happening. Lizzy is desperate enough to think about ending her life and George fought for her, taking the place that should be mine. That's no good. It is not at all good >> Greg sighs and collapses a little more under the weight of his sorrows.
<< Eh, but that's how he was raised. With animals it's like with children, John, we use the educational methods that parents used on us. Luckily you have John, little one >> Angelo says, giving the giant bone to the puppy.
He brings his hand to his head and realizes two things. Someone attached him to a drip saline solution, a smaller one of antibiotic and another of morphine. The second thing that Sherlock realize is that his head is bandaged. He try to sit up and notices the third, not negligible, detail: his right leg is in traction. He looks at his leg as if it belonged to another person. Sherlock's leg is in plaster from over the knee at the ankle. The leg  is hang on small weights that keep it in traction thanks to pulleys.
Sherlock brings the violin under his chin and closes his eyes. He stay for a few moments with the bow on the strings, listening. Then he hears a sound. Greve, prolonged, which spreads from the shoulder to the left arm and on the face. When the vibrations reach the chest, then he takes a deep breath making them expand from there to the totality of its being.
<< I don't know what to think, Mycroft >> John shouts, beating his fists on the desk. << I just know Sherlock's not anywhere. He might have really gone off to chase a case, or he might float on the bottom of the Thames with concrete shoes on his feet, as far as I know at the moment. I am as accustomed as you to his ways of doing and if I tell you that I am worried, please, take it into consideration >>.
<< If he continues like this, his heart will burst, Dr. Watson. We have to do something >> the nurse try to take him off. John realizes how much the situation is deteriorating, but the idea that Sherlock may fall prey to an induced sleep again scares him. Unfortunately, the nurse is faster than him, that attempt to propose alternative solutions, and injects the sedative into the IV.
<< I'm sorry >> whispers, melting in tears. Warm tears, which spread a pleasant warmth on his face. Sherlock dries them with his fingers and they too begin to heat up. This good fire that feels slowly spreading within him is intoxicating. << It's late now >> he says serene, turning his gaze to his mother.
<< It shouldn't have happened at all, Sherlock. We do not solve the criminal investigation in this way. By not becoming victims >>.
<< Er ... wait, how was it? Sitz und still >> John says in the captain's tone of voice. The puppy immediately sits silent. << Better than many soldiers >> John says caressing the puppy's head.
<< Are he a policeman? >> asks the woman, coming out of her silence. She approaches at the photo and looks it again.
John mechanically nods to the inspector's words. The hands of this woman, huge and full of calluses, totally capture him. She leaves the shop just as Hataway scrambles the last pin on the fourth corner of the poster.
<< It's like a stab, doctor. I feel it strong here and then it radiates from all sides, taking my breath away >>.
<< How is it going between you and Sherlock? >> Greg asks him. They had little opportunity to talk to each other, not only because of the hard work John had to stay behind Sherlock, but also because the doctor didn't have the courage to face the detective after the lecture he did to him.
The child doesn't know how to get the news. He turns his gaze to Sherlock and John, who, in unison, invite him to obey.
<< This time I haven't been alone >> Mycroft says, looking at the empty chair. << I didn't really want to consider the possibility that you had disappeared. I couldn't believe there was something so crazy behind it. John, however, has not thought about it even for a moment. He remained clinging to the belief that you were alive, always >>.
<< Stop it with these bullshit! She would have thrown herself from the balcony of the library if it hadn't been for your intervention >> insists Greg holding him tight.
The doctor runs his hands over his tired face. He shouldn't have allowed that evening to take place. When Bryan started playing the fool with Sherlock, John would have to take sides with his friend and put a stop to his ex-comrade. Instead he did nothing. John stood there watching, while Bryan forcefully dragged Sherlock out of 221B, merely rolling his eyes and snorting. This is because, after all, he liked the idea of also having Sherlock at one of their evenings in the pub. Although he knew how much Sherlock would have felt like a fish out of water in that environment. The John's desire to see Sherlock in a common place, to do common actions (such as drinking a beer, listening to music) was stronger than common sense.
<< Just to do this >> John replies. He quickly leaves Sherlock's wrists and starts to run with his fingers along the consultant's hips and abdomen in search of a sensitive point.
<< It seemed to me that you too had stopped with that stuff >> John says, looking at him wrong. Sherlock hands him the cigarette.
They perceive Morgan's small great absence, while, kiss after kiss, they reach the bedroom. They had become accustomed to diligently abandoning the clothes on the back of the armchair, or on the chairs, or on the door handles, after so many shirts and socks had become prey to the little dog, who destroyed them with his sharp teeth. Now, however, they throw everything where it happens and it is a sweet feeling of freedom, although it is bitter.
"It is terrible not to be welcomed for what you are from your family," Harry's voice whispers in his mind and John really struggles, this time, to hold back his tears.
<< Not really >> answers John, who just wants to get out of there, where he are wasting too much time. Mary groped to read Sherlock's name, making the pronunciation blatantly wrong, which. John can't stand her any longer.
John sees Greg silently thanking Mycroft, who just bows his head in response. Margaret keeps her gaze down, completely devoid of the strength to reply to those sharp and true words.
<< Oh, stop it! I'll stay here and wait for your return as a good boy, happy? These semples are extremely important and equally important is that nobody suspects who we are and what happened >>.
"Shut up, Johnny! You need this job!" reminds him his sister's voice and John immediately turns on the best of his smiles.
<< I don't give a damn, Fox. She is a young girl and she takes a moment to be enchanted by one of your smiles. And I takes me two to destroy you, even if you only do it for work. Lord, what do I have to say! >> he adds, rolling his eyes. << You, Sherlock, other quiet friends like John don't, huh? >> he says to Sherlock, giving him a sever look.
<< So bad? >> she asked him and, relieved, Sherlock realized that the little girl was now in front of him. He had nodded, unable to say anything and had happily accepted the ice and clean towel she had given him. For the first time he had been forced to use the 'parrot' and the burning during urination had been such as to tear cry.
"I'm a bloody idiot!" sighs, passing his hand over his face, tired of the hours of travel. John walk slowly to what he has always considered the Mind Palace doormat on which Sherlock is used to lie down to access it. John sits down in the exact center. Rigid, as if he were embarrassed to touch the sofa's surface. He hesitantly places both hands on sofa's black skin and the memories come stronger.
<< It's something we do without realizing it, Sherlock. Perhaps our way of understanding each other perfectly without the need to speak. Maybe because I call you back and you listen to me in your own way. Maybe because people see something that we are not yet able to see >>.
<< Sherlock! >> shouts the child, flying into his arms. << I was so afraid >> he says, crying desperately. Sherlock holds him tightly and cradles him gently, caressing his tousled hair. Morgan approaches to lick Sherlock's hand, seeking comfort in turn.
<< Exactly >> John nods seriously. << Now that we have restored the responsibilities, let's take that asshole >>
Sherlock picks up an excerpt of what appears to be a conversation. The voice is very low. He cannot say whether it belongs to a man or a woman. This person insists on how angry was for not being taken seriously.
Time has flown. It is the dusk when John decides to have a dinner at the Angelo's. A way to allow Sherlock to sleep peacefully for a while longer. Here too the puppy is well known.
<< A nightmare. A damned nightmare >> John mumbles, rubbing his lips on which he still feels the pressure of those of the creepy woman.
<< Hi, little one, hello >> Sherlock says. The puppy answers the greeting by licking his nose. << Hi John >> sais to him, hugging the puppy.
<< I ... I don't know. I think so. In her way. She ... she wasn't very affectionate. She liked my hair >> Sherlock says, sketching a smile.
<< It must be a characteristic of the sociopathy behind which he hides >> shrugs John, pouring himself a cup of tea.
<< What was the case, for example. The police station databases are all connected and I don't think it would be so difficult to access and verify them >>.
<< You are right. Is it really true what they say about you, then? >> chuckles, wiping the bald again. << That two men decide to give vent to the passion in the changing rooms, although it is not an adequate thing, it can also be there. We are in a Spa: they relax, they walk wear a bathrobe and similar episodes can happen. The members know this and turn a blind eye. If there was, however, a maniac on the loose ... >>.
<< No, no, John, this is not my intent >> reassures him, pushing away what he said with a quick gesture of the hand. << You will agree with me, however, that you have a remarkable resistance to the effects of alcohol, while Sherlock definitely does not >>.
<< Yes, he has a funny name and wears a funny hat and if you also lived with him you would notice many other damn funny things >> John growls and this time the inspector also feels he has to put a hand on his arm.
"You got into a lot of trouble, Johnny!" Harriet tells him in his head and John feels all the embarrassment of the world collapsing on his shoulders.
Mycroft calls him from the floor above. John takes a moment to recover from what he has discovered and order his legs to reach Mycroft. He finds him on the threshold of one of the rooms on the floor.
<< Worthy father's daughter >> he says, making her blush. << I'm sorry to have lied to you, but if I hadn't acted incognito you wouldn't have trusted me and I couldn't risk you deciding to make that bad jump. Do you think you can forgive me? >> he asks her with a soft voice and a bewitching look. The girl blushes even more, sketches a smile and nods looking away.
<< Greg >> John whispers, feeling crumble the mask of cold and logical rationality he has worn so far. He accepts the shoulder that the detective offers him and puts his forehead on it. It takes him a while to explode into tears, to cling to his friend with nervous gestures, shaken by convulsive sobs. Hataway and his men take a look at him and then turn respectfully to the other side. John doesn't care what those people are thinking. His best friend, the man he loves, is dead. This stupid way to died makes him angry. After all the stunts and the dangerouse adventures he has experienced.
"Seen from outside, sexual intercourse is violent" James whispers in Sherlock's ear. “It is almost difficult to distinguish rape from a consensual relationship. The facial expression of pleasure is completely similar to that of pain. Also the cries that are produced. Then, when the two subjects are so tight against each other, it is even more difficult. Does one squeeze the other to prevent him from running away or to keep him pleasantly to himself? And the other sinks his nails into the flesh in a desperate attempt to defend himself or for a voluptuous animal gesture? But I'm asking too many questions" Moriarty laughs, his warm breath touching Sherlock's face," I just think you're beautiful. So free, without any inhibition, devoted to the exclusive pursuit of carnal pleasure. Alive! Oh dear, yes, you are alive for once, at least, in your life made of continuous deductions ".
<< I just don't want that he have dysentery, John. He is a puppy. Everyone try to feed him! And try to caresses him! ‘Could I touch him? He's so cute', everyone repeat, over and over. I would like to see how they would react if someone asked them 'Could I touch you? You are so cute ’>>.
<< No! This no! >> Sherlock growls, punching the blankets with a fist. << I don't want him anymore! He no longer exists for me! >>.
John should stop. He knows he should because his friend is drunk. In more sober circumstances they would both sit in front of a movie or each in their own beds. But John doesn't stop. He doesn't want to stop!
<< Do you and your friend live together? >> Mary asks him, suddenly changing expression. A shiver runs down John's back, in front of those serious eyes and tense face. There is no longer any trace of the shy girl in this woman now, and what has taken her place calm down the doctor.
<< As you prefer >> retorts Greg. He calls his men. The chief of the scientific session murmurs something bad against the consultant and, in particular, his dog.
Greg sighs at his side and tries several times to say something, but stopping before pronouncing a verb.
Inspector Hataway puts his hands on his hips, to emphasize  what the two Londoners have just asked him is light years away from being able to be achieved.
<< You finally opened your eyes >> she exclaims, placing the tray on the desk. << I was starting to fear you wouldn't wake up anymore. You slept for three days and I had to throw a lot of food because of you >>.
It is not even ten pm when John arrives at 221B. Bach welcomes him, by announcing that the great  consulting detective is meditating on the case from which he raised him. The curiosity to know what Sherlock deduced that morning in the girl's bedroom grips John. On the return journey he thought of many valid arguments to convince Sherlock to participate in the investigation. From those calmly exposed to those imposed with a big voice and threats. John already knows that he will compose a sort of medley starting from the first and then going to ruin on the last.
<< Oh my God! >> he exclaims, capturing the attention of the inspector, who indulges in a colorful curse when he sees the furrows on the wood, surely left by human nails.
Sherlock can't keep his eyes open, his head is spinning. From those few flashes that he catches, every time he tries to open them, Sherlock sees part of the white shirt worn by the staff members.
Squeezed in John's arms, after the pleasant oblivion that the proximity of their bodies can give him, Sherlock expects that Morgan climb up on the bed and crouch between their intertwined legs. When he realizes how impossible this is, the heat of tears rises to his eyes. He sinks his face against John's chest, which reflexively squeezes him even more, perhaps lost in the same thoughts.
<< Too long! Mr. Holmes, I must ask you to continue the investigation and give me a certain answer as soon as possible >>.
<< It is an ointment for bruises. It must be freezing, Sherlock >> John explains, continuing his work undaunted.
The conversation with Fox leaves a bad taste in Sherlock’s mouth. He and John shouldn't have split up. Now that Fox and Juan have confirmed that there's a sexually  assault behind the victim's death, the theatrical behavior of Sherlock look like even more stupid and useless than it already was It seemed.
The van suddenly stops. Mary slams down the door. Sherlock hears her heavy footsteps, muffled by the snow, go around the van and open the tailgate. Sherlock tightens even more in the blanket lowered on the face. Mary huge hands grab him. Sherlock offer no resistance as he pulls him out of the van. She holds him in his arms and he barely sees her serious, concentrated face. Mary then stops and remains still for a long moment. The wind is strong and makes the blanket dance. Sherlock trembles and teeth chatter.
<< It was a pleasure to see you again Fox and I thank you for what you have done for my daughter >> says Greg to the journalist, offering him the hand that Fox shakes vigorously.
John puts on the table one of the register he brought away from her home, which seems to cause a slight reaction in Mary. In fact, she opens her eyes wide and moves slightly back. The guard, on the other hand, comes forward slightly.
<< We will have a nice chat with this 'master' >> says Sherlock, standing up. Dizziness makes him stagger and John grabs him just in time.
<< When I saw that phoenix engraved on that girl's skin, I shivered. Even Lizzy often draws it on her wrist >> says George absently, caressing the veins at the base of his hand. << Mr. Holmes, I am really worried about my sister. Sometimes I can't stand her and I would like to eject her out of the window with my hands, but since I saved her ... >> he lets slip away immediately, biting his lip. << I discovered that I have a terrible fear of losing her >> he says and a lonely tear escapes his control and draws a trail on his cheek still hairless.
John cannot help noticing the use of time in the present. A sign that they have not yet realized, nor do they want to realize, that what is lying on the floor a few meters from them is a corps now lifeless.
<< Then it would be better if I remove this urgency immediately. I may not be so available anymore. I have a diplomatic meeting soon >> says Mycroft, looking at the clock. << Want a ride, detective? >> Mycroft asks Greg, who hesitates about what to do for a few moments before accepting.
<< I have no idea, John. Maybe we'll find out in the next few hours. I stay here, you bring the tests to the laboratory >>.
<< It is morphine. It's starting to open the secret drawers of my Mind Palace >> he whispers, between sobs.
In these five days, however, Sherlock has not contact him and John has hesitated several times on take the initiative and write to him. He also jotted down many texts, which were saved in drafts for a few hours before he decided to delete them entirely.
<< I didn't call him, John, far from me to do this. I think he did two plus two and he found that it still does four >>.
"Please give this drama queen an Oscar!" Moriarty exclaims. The fact that his voice insinuates his thoughts even now that he is not in his Mind Palace should worry him, instead he does not give him much weight. Sherlock carries on that shower that barely heats him, aware of the fact that Mary will soon return to bring him back to his cell, whispering the need to hurry. Sherlock wraps himself in the rough bathrobe and crouches on the tub board and that's how Mary finds him.
<< You reacted like this because in reality it wasn't that woman who killed all those people, didn't you? >> John whispers, holding the back of Sherlock's hand very close to his lips. Mary's eyes. The sudden way in which they changed after that moment of freezing. John reminds them well. << If your desire to help her is so strong, there must be a reason that goes beyond the banal Stockholm syndrome. You fight for justice to be done and evidently she is not the culprit to be executed >>.
The bell rings by tearing him from his thoughts. A long and prolonged sound, quite annoying, to be honest.
Once again Sherlock is speechless. A hot flash feels exploding in his face. Imagines that he is blushing like a schoolgirl, which irritates him even more.
The cry of a woman takes him by surprise and turns in the direction from which he comes. Sherlock sees a gate in the distance and a car a few meters from it. A lifeless body equidistant from both.
<< That stuff had to be badly cut >> Sherlock mumbles, passing a hand that feels very heavy on the face.
<< The weight of culture! >> chuckles, noting how much lighter the trolley is now. John's laughter echoes in the room, creating a strange effect. He has never been so alone in this apartment. When Sherlock was out for who knows which of his cases, was Mrs. Hudson downstairs. The noises coming from the landlady's house kept John company. When, however, there was no Mrs. Hudson, the apartment was prey to Sherlock's chaos, capable of making his presence felt even when he was lying on the sofa, immersed in his Mind Palace.
<< I knew you wouldn't give up >> Sherlock chuckles, shaking his hand << Nothing good, unfortunately >> sighs appearing even more tired. << It is such a big thing that I don't even know if it can really be stopped >>.
<< Oh my God, I prefer to keep him as a last resort >> Greg retorts, twisting his nose. << I have to go, I have a mountain of trouble to manage. Please, try to understand what happened to him and, if you find him, call me! >> he says, opening the door. << Although I don't know the reason for the quarrel, Sherlock is giving me so much trouble that I am on your side regardless! >> he adds, heading to the car.
He looks down trying to regain control of himself. John turns his gaze to Sherlock, who does not distract his from the boy, while giving him time to compose himself and continue.
<< It should be used as a shampoo, but you must keep it on for at least twenty minutes. Please don't mess around >>.
<< Last month was also thanks to Morgan if we caught those diamond thieves. Two weeks ago, Morgan gave me a remarkable hand, finding the right track that allowed the blasters to defuse the bomb carried by the kamikaze . If the chief commissioner wants my help, he must accept  you, John, and Morgan >> Sherlock says and the puppy snorts, confirmating his words.
<< You are really very devoted >> she says. Mary put a bucket of water on the floor and a basin on the chair. However, it is not bath time. Sherlock quickly moves his eyes in every direction to deduce as quickly as possible what to expect and how to organize a possible defense.
<< I won't take advantage of you, don't worry >> Sherlock says, kissing John’s neck slowly. << I don't even know if this suits you >>.
<< It is not of my interest >> he interrupts him. << It wasn't when I tried to hire you as a spy inside Baker Street and it's not now. The only thing I hope is that you will have the opportunity to clarify yourself and to do it we must first find him, John >>.
<< They were brought here in different periods >> says Molly, leaning in turn from the edge of the hole. << The stages of decomposition are different >>.
<< Finished is a rather big word, Dr. Watson >> replies Fox. << Let's say that we have reached an excellent turning point in the investigation. Once the brain of the organization is found, turning off the neurons one by one will be easier, but still exhausting. We have already blocked the cells that had been created in Spain, Germany, France and here in England. Gray, my boss, is still controlling the presence of similar suicides in other nations, and now that we put our hands on the mind of the portal, even this process will be faster. Always assuming that he wants to collaborate >>.
Sherlock looks at the child, that watching them attentively, pretending to pamper Morgan. The consultant go to the child and crouches down near him. Morgan doesn't waste time showing Sherlock how much he missed him.
The doctor, who remained diligently as always on the edge of the crime scene, approaches the consultant, who is standing a few steps from the body lying on the floor. He kneels beside what was a beautiful girl of just 16 years old. He sighs trying to remain as professional and detached as possible, as taught him the years of specialization in medicine first and those on the battlefield then. John bring his gloved fingers close to brushing the girl's left arm on which she has engraved, with a razor blade, the strange draw that then killed her, staining the bedroom carpet with her blood.
Mary had torn the bandage on the forehead with a sharp blow, regardless of the possibility of hurting him. She had sprayed the wound with disinfectant and dabbed it vigorously before covering it again.
<< No. I hate him. It's like being deaf. The points of reference are lost and it always seems that something must happen at any moment. I am never in the silence, never >>.
<< What's reaction? >> John asks. The two women exchange a glance, making each other courageous and turn to look at the child that eat his breakfast by sharing it with the puppy.
<< I believe it is better to put things back as they were. What do you think, Mary? >> Sherlock suggest to her.
<< I don't know where is your mom >> Sherlock says to William. << I know that I will do everything to find out what happened to her and also to find her. I want you to know that I'm not foolproof. I will give my best, as always, but I may also fail. Do you think you can stand it? >>.
Lestrade gave him a summary report of the interrogations made to the staff and patrons present at the time when Howard Byron died. Apparently nobody saw or heard anything.
“The person falled against it. The person was running, looking over the shoulder, and stumbled against the cushions "
he thinks, chatting amiably with Clarissa, that he doesn't like it too much, but right now his company is more than welcome.
<< Leave me! >> Sherlock screams, pushing him away. He begins to hyperventilate and looks up to seek the help of his doctor.
<< It is known how alcohol makes you uninhibited, even more if you are not used to it. But you are a doctor, I really don't think I should explain it to you >>.
"You need to distract yourself," John thinks and knows Sherlock won't tell him. His friend hates when the obvious is underline.
"Bad idea, Sherlock!" John says. “Try to resist. Maybe the good thing is that you will put on a few pounds. She doesn't cook that bad. "
<< I didn't know you were able to think, Anderson? >> Sherlock replies, moving undisturbed towards the study of William's mother, located at the back of the living room. Morgan follows him, trotting with the same carelessness.
<< Why? Do you think you can be immune? >> Greg asks. << No, because if you really are, tell me where you got vaccinated that I run to do it >> adds ironic. Mycroft smiles and seems pleased with Greg's jokes than annoyed, as John usually sees him in front of the manifestation of human idiocy.
<< Mum keeps the important things here >> says the child, coming down from Sherlock's back to run to the first drawer of the desk. He pulls it but it is locked << Uff! >> snorts.
<< The situation, my dear doctor, seems somewhat obvious to me >> Mycroft replies, rolling his eyes. << My brother has been contacted by this Paddington to handle a case. Sherlock recognized it interesting, decided to leave and during the investigation he found himself stuck up there by the storm. He will be giving a hard time to the patience of those poor people >>.
John is furious at the idea that they may have arrived late. He quickly descends the stairs and moves like a fury toward the big woman.
The fire crackles in the fireplace and a few sprigs of lavender must have been added to the wood. The sweet fragrance expands into the small guest room.
<< Punishment! >> shouts Mary, finally saying a word of complete meaning. She grabs Sherlock by the broken leg and drags him off the bed. Sherlock feels a dull but bearable pain and just grumbles when he falls off the bed. The drips to which he is attached detach from the support and and crawl on the ground behind him. The woman mumbles meaningless words, as she drags him down a flight of stairs. Sherlock holds the trolley close to his chest and tries to put strength on his abs so as not to collapse with a dead weight on every single step. From the stairs Sherlock is then dragged onto the dusty carpet that covers the entire corridor. He hardly feels the tingling it causes on his bare buttocks and surely scratched by rubbing with the ground.
<< Would you like to keep it up for me? >> asks and sees her cheeks blush with embarrassment. Sherlock fears that he has used too seductive a tone and bitterly regrets it. Fortunately, however, the woman just keeps the mirror half a meter away. Sherlock moves her hands a little more to his left and struggles to recognize the face reflected in the mirror.
<< Sure, how could you? You are not able! >> blurts out by taking a step towards him, his fists clenched and his jaw clenched. Sherlock does not make a turn. His eyes remain steady in those of John, who feels mounting too explosive anger.
<< Of course, she has committed murders and has to pay, but one thing is to have killed five people, guilty of murdering 35 and used all kinds of violence against her, another to be accused of the complete package, Mycroft! >>.
<< Why did he tell you to come here? >> Greg asks her. Lizzy rubs the toes of her heavy  amphibians against each other, her face completely hidden by her hair. It seems that the chair she sits on has suddenly become uncomfortable.
<< I don't want you to do other scenes in front of my son, he has already seen too many because of you! Say another word and each of these people will be a witness in my favor >>.
<< Sure, sure. So now, with this little thing, more jokes will come >> John says and the little thing turns his gaze on him, feeling called into question.
<< Her ‘friends’ have started giving her over >> says George in disgust. << They accuse her of wanting to sabotage the organization, of being a spy for the system and that she should be ashamed of having tried to damage a portal that does everything to help young people in difficulty. They put some photos on the net… embarrassing >> he says, blushing. << They even advised her to commit suicide >>.
<< It is the only thing that I have not been able to teach him. Maybe because I like to  have him here >> Sherlock admits, sinking his face into the soft fur of the dog. << When I was a child I had an Irish setter and we always slept together. The bed seemed less large and more warmer >>.
<< Bah, these women are really strange. I wonder what you find in them! >> Sherlock blurts out with a very equivocal and completely unusual flourish of his hand, which embarrasses the other three.
John sighs and a smile is drawn on his lips, one of those that make Sherlock’s heart beat faster. John sits beside him on the bed.
Sherlock sketches a smile, taking a sip of the tea and takes time. John lets him do it. Patience isn't what he needs, no matter what the journalist says about anger management.
<< I know their methods better than you, I collaborated with them for a year in Madrid >> Sherlock says and John is amazed at his words. Sherlock, so attached to his London to the point of abandoning it only if it is necessary for small and short periods, has been away a whole year in Spain with Fox and his colleagues.
John sighs. He has Sherlock's hand clasped in his again, John hopes again that  Sherlock will wake up early. Yes, because he wants to be able to talk to him, try to contain him, if necessary, and ask him to explain the reason for his words.
John laughs first slowly then louder. He gives him an amused look, involving him in his laughter. They both abandon themselves tired of laughter against the backs of their respective armchairs. The heads leaned back and the breath excited.
<< I thought that in these days I have moved seas and mountains to save the woman who tried to kill me and I totally ignored the man who saved me >>.
<< Oh God, Mary ... it's beautiful >> he whispers moved. A knot tightens Sherlock's throat and his hands tremble as he caresses the live wood, the strings stretched. << Can I, really? >> Sherlock asks, to the woman, who nods looking at him with big and surprised eyes.
<< I need a shower >> he says standing up. Another dizziness makes him falter. John's strong hands grab him. Sherlock has to admit he's not feeling well
<< Be good, ok? >> Sherlock says caressing Morgan's head. The puppy licks his face and then follows the child who shows him what their next game will be. Sherlock feels a strange sensation in seeing those two little pirates run together, understanding each other perfectly, despite speaking different languages.
<< The employees of the Spa are actually hired by the sauna master >> he tries to unload the responsibilities.
<< Let me at least try, please. I'm stuck here and I'm not used to all this stillness. I think it would be good for me to be able to take care of myself at least with a shave >>.
<< Oh God >> she whispers, bringing both hands to his mouth. << I came out indirectly thanks to your work, Dad >> she says, placing her hand on her father's knee.
<< Now you're the one who says things that don't make sense! >> he exclaims annoyed. << I go away to spite John >> repeats teasing. << I am certainly not the one who made 'spite' >> he points out, by crossing his arms over his chest.
John is amazed and sees his own amazement reflected in Greg's proven face. It is not only for the long monologue held by the English government, but for the many awards in favor of the detective. The sentence with which Mycroft closed his sermon, then, will also be put there to get the right effect, but summarizes many things. Things that John does not know, some that he may have guessed and others that perhaps will remain unexplained .
<< Officially by my side >> Sherlock replies, taking John's face in his hands. << I would be lost without my blogger >> he whispers, sinking his hands into John's hair, involving him in a kiss full of passion, which extinguishes reason by letting their bodies speak silently.
<< I wouldn't be the first to go around the hotel naked, John. In fact, since you wanted to be here so much, it will be up to you to ‘show off some meat’ >> teases Sherlock to him, wearing, however, the shirt. << I don't understand why you wanted to accept that suite >>.
<< Yes. I also had some photos taken at the meetings, but a few days after they threw me out they stole my phone >>.
<< No. No I can't, John >> growls furiously between sobs. << If it were only this I could do it, but there is also that woman, that abominable woman >> and the crying explodes. For too long Sherlock had stood still between tension and forced relaxation.
<< My kids >> he smiles at them. << I know that in the last period the situation has been nothing short of disastrous. I want you to know, however, that I will always there  for you, even if mom and I are no longer together. Lizzy, we'll put an end to this bad situation, I promise you. You, please, promise me that you will tell me about anything that happens to you, especially those in which you need help >>.
"No" Sherlock replies. Red in the face, Mary torments a nail with her teeth, while insisting on not looking at him.
<< I'm done >> he whispers, feignedly embarrassed and the woman reaches out her hand protected by a latex glove. She
<< What an honor! Sherlock Holmes the  consulting detective! Break my arm if you want. You will never find out where I keep them hidden >>.
A deaf and sudden noise snatchesm Sherlock from his Mind Palace. It usually takes a lot longer to get him out of there, but in recent days, his defenses are apparently much higher than usual. Mary is bent over Sherlock again, intent on straightening the bed.
John is right. Mary gives the idea of being able to stand alive stoically for a long time even unloading an entire loader on her, let alone what can do with a simple razor.
<< Lestrade back here? He will have forgotten something ... >> he stops, by refining his hearing. John looks at the door, amazed by the consultant's behavior. He hears footsteps slowly climbing the stairs.
Sherlock says thet his desire is desperate, but his kisses are slowly. Kisses slow and loads of passion, so different from those of that night. John lets himself be completely overwhelmed. In the flood of emotions that he feels, he tries to take the lead, but Sherlock immediately moves away from him.
<< If someone helped him, he would have survived. This is an aggravating circumstance for that bastard >> John says punching the table. He approaches Molly and kisses her on the forehead. << You are exceptional, as always >> he says and runs away leaving her speechless.
<< Hey, John, what's wrong with you? >> Greg asks him, who immediately rushes to help him get up back.
"I'm sorry to tell you, but I think that Mary only managed to get this blanket from your tormentor" Moriarty tells him, appearing sitting against the hatch. Sherlock ignores his irony and, with movements made less secure and slower by the tremor, wraps himself in that knitted wool rectangle. It has the scent of burnt wood and a lavender aftertaste, just like that of the fireplace. The slight warmth helps Sherlock to quell the chills, although at almost regular intervals they return to shake him from head to toe. He crouches in a fetal position just as he had done that Sunday morning, when he felt the sweet weight of the blanket resting on him by John.
Sherlock would like to tell her to stop talking about her family of sadistic madmen, but Mary seems to have removed the cap. Sherlock is afraid that by now she will consider him as one of her dolls, forced to stay there to listen to her tell her nightmares. Except that those are not dreams, the result of a tormented unconscious, but the cruel reality.
<< So you would like me to help the hacker of a group of investigative journalists, known for their action on the limits of legality? >>.
<< Lestrade, allow me to make an observation >> says Mycroft, catalyzing the attention of those present. << I think that you are proving to be a good father or better, to say it as the literature of the sector wants, a sufficiently good father >>.
'Music helps you not to hear the silence inside', Johann Sebastian Bach said. Something different happened to Sherlock, though. In silence he brought out the shouting of a thousand thoughts and the many emotions that swirled inside him. That silence, created by the snow that had frightened him so much, now that he has created it within himself thanks to the violin, leaves him ... so. He should be frightened or even just amazed and instead it is simply ... so.
<< Gentlemen, I renew my request: can you accompany me and my son to Mr. Ford's house? >> asks Sherlock and John.
Morgan barks and draws Sherlock's attention, who quickly approaches him and William, crouched against the wall.
When they arrive at the Spa they ask the reception employee to participate at the midnight ritual and she gives them bathrobes. Sherlock and John look around for the three men, but none of them are there. They head to the crowded changing rooms and chatter and wear bathrobes. The heat is less intense, tempered by the cold temperature of the autumn evening. Dressed up in this way, Sherlock and John head to the crowded relax area and sit on the windowsill of one of the large windows open onto the beautiful panorama of a London at night, from the sky strangely clear of clouds and full of stars.
<< Still in time to fix >> Sherlock says, his eyes closed again in the contemplation of The Beatles' 'Help!'.
<< Yes, John, I can be done >> he whispers, more to satisfy John's voice and hope that he will shut up. In fact, he is not convinced of it. There is something about that woman that worries him. Something that leads him to think that his stay in this place will be not easy.
<< We are facing a single kidnapper. Sherlock come  through the main door. There is no signs of intrusion, so Ford opened the door for his kidnapper. It is possible that Ford knew him, because his footprints are regular >> Sherlock says pointing to the signs on the floor. John, Greg and Morgan follow him closely. << At this point something must have happened >> Sherlock says, stopping near the footprint of the kidnapper's feet, distant from each other and more marked, as if he wanted to anchor himself better on the ground. Sherlock looks around, embracing the whole room with his eyes to analyze every corner. << Here it is! >> Se says, pointing to the ceiling.
<< Here I am! >> Mary enters the room cheerfully. Sherlock feels the blood rise to his head and looks up ready to scream at her. The cry, however, dies in his throat. That scary big woman holds the dusty custody of a violin in her hand. << It belonged to my grandfather >> she says cheerfully. << I don't know if it still good, it's been thrown there for years. Maybe you can do something about it >>.
<< Come on, I thought you understood. My friends weren't that much between the lines on Saturday >> says John, taking on the same absurdity and tone as Sherlock's obvious.
<< Shut up! >> Sherlock exclaims and the heart rate monitor starts playing. << What do you want to know about how relationships work? You have done nothing but encourage me to stay away from any form of emotional and physical involvement with anyone! I don't accept lessons of any kind from you on this kind of thing >>.
<< Perfect. Let's go back to the central, then. We will print some to distribute in the districts and hang them at the meeting points. If your friend is alive, Captain, we will find him. Rumors are running fast in such a small country >>.
<< Too many undigested things >> John says, realizing too late that he has spoken out loud. The patient nods and curves himself even more.
<< But now, you are not my doctor >> Sherlock says, running with the finger the chest from the collarbone to the navel.
<< You too >> says John kissing those always too cold fingers. << See you soon William >> John greets the child by ruffling his hair. John quickly walks away to join Greg, followed by the adoring gaze of his consultant.
"When did I fall so low that I wasted my time with such subjects?" he wonders and the expression of disgust that Sherlock assumes in front of human idiocy comes to his mind. John does not realize that he is replicating it very well.
John blinks several times and a funny expression of amazement is drawn on his face. Sherlock does not wait for an answer from him. He walks the streets of the Pall Mall neighborhood, where the Jackson reside, headed for Trafalgar Square.
"You are cooked, dear Johnny!" Chuckles Harriet in his head and John chuckles in turn, barely looking away from the consultant and then bringing him back. He discovers that Sherlock is looking at him in turn. John smiles at him without realizing it. In fact, he usually represses this spontaneity, especially with Sherlock. John sees him wavering. His eyes widening just a little more, before answering him smile. Everything around him could even break out right now and John wouldn't even realize it.
<< Why on earth? Do you think it would really make a difference? If she decides to open the door, this is where she will take me. She has already decided it. She is just waiting for the storm to end >>.
<< Then it is possible that what you call 'sensation' is actually a detail that your eye has caught, but that your conscience has not registered it.
<< There's everything in here, John. Pedophiles, exploiters, blackmailers, drug dealers. They lure these kids by promising them a happier life under the sign of the phoenix >>.
<< Yes, but that's not enough! >> insists the consultant, returning to sit at the pc. << Maybe by scrolling the others novels we will get more clues >>.
Sherlock and John watch him go and when the door closes behind Mycroft they find themselves in a silence full of tension.
<< They are things that are part of the past. They hurt me, of course, but they are gone and I am able to manage them >>.
<< Then Sherlock returned here >>, Greg continues, << and after a while he calls me asking me to join him and who do I find with him? >> he says, turning to his son with an expression between the angry and the worried. << When will you two decide to tell me what is happening? >> asks the detective and Sherlock turns his gaze to John again. He wants that John inform Greg. John, who is much more prepared to give bad news. If had it been anyone else,  Sherlock would have briefed him
<< If I'm not the one to ruin your reputation, who is it? >> Sherlock presses John, going against him.
<< Where did you take him? >> he asks her, trying to overcome the instinct to grab her by the collar of the flannel shirt that pops out from under the shawl.
<< Oh god, Sherlock. If we had a son what would you do? >> laughs John. The consultant pulls up on his elbow and looks at him in amazement.
<< I can't stand rapists. I have seen too many in war >> he answers with a half lie and a half truth.
<< Oh, your brother thought about recovering them >> says Sherlock, continuing to send and read messages from his cell phone. Lizzy looks amazed at her brother, who smiles contemptuous of the danger. She doesn't yell at him this time. Lizzy shakes her head in resignation before smiling at him.
<< Thank you, dear. I will have more time for the research that I am carrying out with Captain Watson. He is a doctor, you know? As was your father >>.
<< A dog makes family. You and I makes mess. Or rather, you make mess and confusion and I try to keep everything up >>.
<< So I leave you alone for two days on a case and you turn it into the plot of a James Bond film, complete with an investigative journalist, quick-witted, accustomed to being on the front line and with a skill in disguises like Diabolik >>.
<< Really? >> Fox chuckles. << The involvement of Lizzy and Greg has upset you, as well as realizing how Moriarty can act to accomplish his purpose >>.
The sound of a masterfully played guitar reaches them. It comes from the fountain in the square, beyond a small group of people grouped around a young street artist. Sherlock heads towards them attracted by the music.
<< You mean that ... >> John says, pointing at Fox. << Are you part of the team of investigative journalists of 'El Mundo'? >> asks in amazement. Sherlock nods and Fox barely smiles at John.
<< Obviously it hurts. It is broken >> she replies, indifferent to his pain. Sherlock stares at that frowning face, the huge body, the hands anchored to the hips and cannot help but laugh. He laughs because he could have made that joke in a similar circumstance. Why reaffirm what is obvious? A broken leg can only hurt. He himself would have been in the same way insensitive. Feeling how bad it is to reiterate the obvious with an air of sufficiency and annoyance, causes him an even greater pain than he feels in the leg and belly.
<< He's passing >> he replies with a smile. A true lie, but Sherlock learned that her benefactress does not like complaints and whining. In fact, the woman nods satisfied.
The boy glances at the chair that they usually offer to customers and Sherlock takes it. He put the chair to form the top in a perfect triangle with their two armchairs and with a gesture of the hand invites the boy to sit down. Sherlock sits down in his armchair and John, who realizes only now that he is still in his pajamas, takes his place by putting his hand in the faithful notebook.
<< Sherlock >>, John exclaims exasperated, << we are in front of the corpse of a desperate girl who has made an extreme gesture pushed by who knows what suffering. I will not allow you to minimize what happened, recognizing it as interesting only for an element that caresses your need for complicated cases to solve! >>.
<< I know that you are not what dad said you were. That you never did sex in order to earn something >>.
<< I think I have never thanked Sherlock enough for all the headaches thatn he takes me off >> adds Greg, wiping his eyes. << If you, John, who know Sherlock better than anyone else, are worried about him, then I think something is really happened there. The least I can do is help you. The case I am following is at a dead end and only Sherlock's brilliant and absurd mind can unlock the situation. So I think I will accompany you on this crazy adventure. I stand rusty behind a desk >> Greg says, standing up. John is speechless and it takes him a few moments to realize what Greg has proposed.
<< Yeah >> John agrees observing the movement. << Maybe this was his job. Make me open my eyes, get us together and meet, thanks to us, William >>.
<< I'm afraid I have not explained well >> says Sherlock, joining his fingers under his chin. << There is no competition, John. That evening it was raining and Fox and I we were wet to the bone. So when you arrived I was in dressing gowns and he was in the shower. You, however, saw a part of the story and mounted it for your use and consumption, even thinking that I was neglecting the case and give myself a very trivial adventure, when, instead, I spent the night in the social media of that girl. I would say that if there is someone who should feel offended and humiliated that is me. You really believed that I could bring perfect strangers to bed. >>.
The nurses break into the room and invite the doctor and politician to move away and leave the patient in their care. Except that Sherlock seems to become more and more energetic and more and more stubborn from his desire to get out of bed and run to save that woman whose name screams and invokes. Only when John hears about sedatives does he shake and go back to his friend.
The woman falters in front of John's fury and seems to be about to say something, but stops completely, as had happened to her in front of Jo's shop.
"This, however, does not change your situation, my friend," says the man, clapping him on the shoulder. Moriarty leans in turn to observe the corpses frozen by the cold. "Solved or not, soon you too will find yourself part of this cheerful gang."
John's stomach closes. For Greg's words. For the accusation that he do to him. For the guilt he further touch with those words. Words that give way to Sherlock's, whispering in John's ear, blow on his skin, scream in the highest moment of pleasure.
<< Do you want to tell me that's why he didn't answer me on the phone these days? >> asks the detective, holding out his hand to the puppy's muzzle, which grants him a little sniff.
<< Also to mine >> John agrees, glancing at his man. << Do we want to go on? >> he adds, inviting the consultant and the child to carry out the investigations. William nods, intimidated by John's seriousness. He takes Sherlock's hand and drags him into the hall. John and Morgan follow them.
<< Yes, really >> he says with a whisper. << I ... I'm engaged >> increases the dose, ashamed of how much this situation is making him fall down.
Those clear and clear eyes are so innocent and at the same time aware of the answer. John smiles at him and realizes Sherlock doesn't know how to answer his question. Sherlock has decided to be brave and denounce what that bastard has done to him, facing what will be the people's judgments. This criminal investigation made John understand even more, if ever it were needed, how strong he is for this brilliant and courageous man. It's up to John now to be brave. He approaches Sherlock’s lips and places a light kiss on it.
<< I do not believe that you never made a shot >> insists. John takes the cigarette with uncertain fingers and takes a long mouthful of it, spitting out the smoke with a cough. It makes him disgusted and annoyed by his smile.
<< I help him when I can >> he answers, staring at that damned clock's hand that is taking too long to move on the 12.
<< Do you respect her? >> shouts the woman, pulling her head up. Her clenched fists lead Sherlock to nod convulsively.
As he had foreseen, she spreeds the cream on Sherlock's face with the same care with which a bricklayer would spread the plaster on a rough wall. Mary pinches Sherlock's nose with that damned brush and he must resist sneezing, which is far from easy.
<< Of course it's okay! >> John retorts in tone. He sighs and raises his open hand in front of him. << Ok. That's enough. We are definitely exaggerating. No! >> exclaims preventing Sherlock from replying. << I am happy you stayed here. I apologize for not thinking you did it >> he says in one breath.
<< Not now >> Sherlock says, standing up. He put his hands on the armrests of John's armchair. << Now I just want to sink into your arms, captain >> he says, approaching his lips to John's one.
<< Thank you, Mary, it was all excellent >> Sherlock increase the dose, trying to shape a convincing smile.
Greg rolls his eyes and doesn't know if Mycroft Holmes want to do a compliment or a mockery to him. He decides to wait for the rest before figuring out whether to thank him or get his hands on him.
They laugh out loud like two little boys who get lost in chatter instead of doing homework. They look at each other for a long time, returning serious.
The detective then approaches the consultant and holds him tightly in an embrace, catching him completely off guard.
<< Mary, I will do everything possible to help you, but they will indict you anyway for killing your brothers and your mother >> he says and Mary burst into tears. She rub her eyes before hiding her face with her hands.
Greg takes John by the arm and drags him out of the office. They reach the dormitory, which consists of six beds, and the doctor throws the bag, in which he has putted few things, over one of them.
<< Did the weather alert predict the duration of the storm? >> Greg asks, completely changing the subject to prevent a cataclysm of blows and kicks from breaking loose in that office.
<< I understand >> Mycroft says with his stretched smile. << Sherlock, on the other hand, wallows in excess. He exaggerates not to eat, even going to pass out in the worst cases. He exaggerates not to eat, even going to pass out in the worst cases. Exaggerate not to sleep until it completely collapses. I certainly don't have to tell you about all the times he was found deeply asleep in the most unusual places. I think you know exactly what I'm talking about >>.
On the other trips that John has made, every time he has been away from him, his flatmate hasn't missed an opportunity to contact him. Sometimes only with a text, others with many texts, even obsessive in the peak moments of his explosive boredom. Of course it also happened that Sherlock did not show up for a whole day. In that situation John must admit that he was the one writing to him, worried that something had happened or he had made some disaster.
<< Sherlock must have crashed into that tree >> says Greg, pointing to a tree with a large stem hovering between the road and the precipice. He goes to remove the layer of snow deposited on the trunk and finds the marks of the paint.
<< We also found a pair of boots, presumably the same that she wore to kill the dog and kidnap the Ford >> says Greg, appearing on the screen next to John. << Ah, I confirm you that both, you and the child, were right: the autopsy on the dog confirms that he was poisoned >>.
<< Lizzy, now stop it! >> Greg thunders with a tone so impressive as to frighten everyone present. His daughter looks at him in amazement before melting into tears.
, don't you know?" The consulting criminal, sneaking into Sherlock mind, laughed. Sherlock also joined in that meaningless laugh, surprise by Moriarty's presence.
<< Our kidnapper is small in stature, judging by the distance between one foot and another, and thin, given the lightness of the footprint. After the shooting the situation changed >> says Sherlock, returning to analyze the scene. << The kidnapper punched Ford and he fell here, where the table and chair are overturned on the ground. There are bloodstains. The analysis will surely say to us that is Ford's blood. These destroyed knickknacks on the right indicate the escape of Mrs. Ford. What's on that side? >>.
John didn't hold up. He went up to his room, put on the first clothes that came under his hand and went out on the cold Sunday morning of November. When he returned, Sherlock was not at home. John hasn't seen him since. The last things he has left of Sherlock are that sentence and his exit from the scene.
<< During the Aufguss timetable there were seven other people besides the sauna teacher: four women and three men: Christian Robinson, Martin McNeel and Robert O’Hara >>.
<< He was here ... he was here until a moment ago >> John exclaims horrified, trying to free himself from the her grasp. The more he tries, the more, however, he falls on her, making her laugh, laugh louder and louder.
<< I ... I don't know which rule I may have violated. I do not understand. I was so happy that they had invited me to a private seminar >> whispers, wiping new tears. << Daisy Cooper, however, when she saw me there she didn't take it well. She asked me what I was doing and then I saw that she was talking about me to one of the Masters >>.
John stands at the edge of the precipice. He cannot take his eyes off the car that is barely visible, half submerged by the snow. Men, ensured with climbing ropes, are digging the car up in an attempt to find out who occupies it.
Sherlock loses his grip on Mary's hand, however. The arm falls inert on the mattress, producing a little reassuring thud. Sherlock surrenders to the only chance he has of getting out of there: being able to have a clear mind capable of reasoning in the absence of pain.
<< You too >> whispers Sherlock and his hand rises slowly to caress John hair darkened by the hair lotion.
<< Thank goodness, little one, you also have a permissive dad >> says the girl, cuddlessing the puppy, that hopes for an encore.
<< I am a  consulting detective and I don't need a license to carry on my work >> Sherlock points out seriously. << John, go with Gawin and keep me informed. I will go to analyze those footprints, in order to go back to the place where William's parents are >>.
<< So what can we do? >> Sherlock asks regretfully and a cramp claws his stomach. He vomit in the toilet just in time. He still spit that foamy, smelly substance.
George's face squeezes like a sponge and in an instant flies to Greg's chest, hugging him tightly while giving vent to tears. Greg supports him, cradles him with the same sweetness with which he held him in his arms just a few years ago. In the nights of fever and ailments. In moments of fear and nightmares. Following quarrels and tantrums. But even when he simply fell asleep peacefully feeling safe and protected in the strong arms of his dad.
<< Hey, what's going on? >> asks her, blinking her long false eyelashes. She tries to put her hand on John's again, which, however, quickly pushes her away.
Proud too, although Sherlock doesn't know why he is. With a gesture of the head, John encourages Sherlock to go ahead and ask to the child the most important question.
"I'd rather die here, instead to see her another time!" Sherlock thinks, wondering how it could be possible that in just two days spent with her, since him awakening, he already feels this way.
The furnishings in the room are in perfect order. Only a few chairs fallen down and some pendants lie broken on the ground. A series of clearly visible footprints on the wax-polished floor, indicates the unexpected presence of only one individual.
Mary arranges the dress and stands up straight and with her hands reaches one on top of the other in front of her chest, like a diligent child who is preparing to recite the Christmas poem. With an unexpectedly clear, intoned and beautiful voice, she begins to sing about this Irish girl and Sherlock follows her, slowly recovering from his Mind Palace the chords of this ballad that he discovers to knows.
"It's not for me," he says, while the huge woman gets up from the bed, making him sway like a boat in the throes of the rough sea. “Rather, I struggle and die in an attempt to defend myself. I'm not like you, Mycroft! ".
<< Yes, Mary had shown them to me. The day before that 'the other' took me to the pit. I had already understood that she had nothing to do with the other murders. These have given me proof >>.
<< Yes, Molly, his fiancée! Edward understood that 'the other' wanted to kill him. He understands everything, looks like a magician! >> informs him amazed. << Edward had said that Molly would find someone else capable of loving her more than he did, but I didn't find him right. Molly would have cried a lot and I didn't want her to cry. Women cry a lot, I always see them on television. So I tried to save him for Molly >>.
<< Okay, for once you should both survive. After I will teach you some things. Be careful he do not eat his own poop or that of other dogs. Remember that you have to collect the poop, there are bags attached to the leash. Be careful of the dogs you meet, if they bite him now that he is little, he could have long term behavioral damages >>.
<< My sister did it. Draw that damned phoenix everywhere now! >> says visibly shivering and John with him.
Silence falls over the doctor's whispered words. Sherlock doesn't know what to argue. He doesn't know whether to argue.
"What's wrong with that?" Harriet asks him in his head. John shakes his head to chase her away once more. His sister with her questions almost as sharp as Sherlock's. She with her hidden truths that when they come to the surface do harm, above all harm him. Just like Sherlock's hidden truths. Apparently, the consultant and his sister have many more things in common than he ever thought. They are both homosexuals, both victims of an addiction they cannot handle, both selfish and both born, it seems, to drive him crazy.
John frees one hand from his grasp and leads his to stroke Sherlock’s pale cheek. Sherlock's eyes grow large in amazement. Then he close to listen to that caress. He presses John’s hand against his cheek and, moved, John realizes that he is relaxing at the touch of his fingers. Sherlock places his hand over John’s hand and slowly turns his face slightly to place a kiss on John’s palm and then better accommodate his cheek.
<< I recognize that look, doctor. I know I should do my own business, but I'm old enough to give a damn and you is still young to be able to save yourself. Anger. This is what kills us, by making us burn. Let it go. There is no use keeping it here >> he says, pointing the gnarled finger towards John's belly. << Try to look at what this covers. Because we men cover everything with anger. Often a deep sadness or a great fear. Sometimes even a great love >> the old man says and John's stomach contracts. << Sorry if I allowed myself, but I see a lot of me in you and if I can do little for me, by now, well ... maybe I'll be less of a useless old man if I can do something for you >>.
<< I apologie so much if I interrupted your reflections! >> John bursts on a war footing. << Why don't you continue as if nothing had happened, as you usually do? I'm used to being ignored >> he says, entering the kitchen. A hot tea to engage his hands and prevent him from getting into a fight is what it takes. John feels Sherlock's gaze behind him. Strangely, Sherlock does not reply. 'Mister last word' does not reply. Nor does he go back to playing.
William turns to indicate them at his mother. The woman stands up and, hand in hand, they head towards them. Without half measures the woman throws her arms around Sherlock's neck and squeezes him tightly, inundating him with new tears.
<< No >> John answers, by crossing his arms over his chest. Sherlock watches him silently for a long time and John lets him doing, not at all intimidated by his inscrutable poker face.
John lets him go and, with surprise, Hataway touches the ground from which he had been separated by an abundant number of centimeters. The detective adjusts his jacket, by looking up at John, who hasn't looked away from his face for a moment.
<< Just because Peter arrived on time >> she confesses, by squinting her eyes. Greg is short of breath at the thought of that escaping danger. He turns his gaze to Sherlock in a silent thanksgiving that the consultant welcomes by barely tilting his head. << All those messages ... all that badness ... those rigged photos that put around saying it was me ... I was about to collapse >>.
<< I ... I don't know. The news of their suicides surprised me too. The private seminar was held at Rosaline's home, who took advantage of the absence of her parents to make her home available. The Master was very kind to her and covered her with attentions ... too many attentions, in my opinion >>.
<< I want to see the scene first and understand what it happened. So, if I consider it, I will have to talk to them >>.
<< Well, you are an ex soldier, it seemed to me the least to honor your past in your first undercover experience >> he says and then bring a hand to caress the fake beard, while studying it carefully. << Come with me, come on >>.
<< Dad's one >> answers confidently. << I stopped believing in mom from a long time >> the boy whispers, looking at the tennis shoes.
<< We will talk about what happened face to face. It is a delicate situation >> John had said every time he canceled the texts, tormenting himself, at the same time, with Sherlock's stubborn mutism.
Sherlock takes his pencil case from the inside pocket of his coat and kneels in front of the desk. He looks at the drawer lock and pulls out the burglary tools, followed by the curious gaze of the child. William lets out an 'oh' of amazement when, after a few attempts, the lock snap. Sherlock brings his finger in front of his mouth, letting him understand not to tell around what he has seen. William nods, bringing his finger to his lips too.
<< I'll take you to the train station, colleague >> Hataway intrudes, giving one of his men orders to prepare the car.
In dreams Sherlock returned to many episodes of his past. From some of these he woke up panting, from others in tears, from others even screaming. Sherlock always found Mary- child sitting on the chair. A wet handkerchief in one hand, ready to wipe away sweat, and a glass of water in the other.
<< However >>, adds Sherlock, << nothing prevents us from listening to what you have to tell us and then decide if it is appropriate to load him with this additional weight or not >>.
<< Oh, shut up! >> the chief blurts out. << Lestrade, do as he says. But know, my dear detective, that if you are wrong I will have you remove your license and I will throw you in jail for life! >>.
Mrs. Hudson surprises them embraced, but there is not the usual smile of someone who knows a lot about her face. She became very interested in the case of 'that poor girl', as she used to define Mary, and immediately senses something happened to her. Ms Hudson sets the tea tray on the table and takes the letter. She read it, crying in turn and without saying a word goes to the door and from there goes down to her apartment.
With a little difficulty, Sherlock pulls the violin out of its housing and plucks its strings. As he imagined it is completely without tuning. Sherlock start tuning it by plucking the strings and turning the keys. When he is satisfied, he takes the bow and spends a few minutes passing the wax over his hair. The first long sound it produces by sliding it on the strings pleasantly touches the skin. Mary exclaims an 'oh' of surprise bringing her hands to her face and Sherlock smiles at her. Sherlock give a turn of the key to the string and once again pass the bow on the strings producing a lower sound. Mary claps her hands against each other, amused. She looks at him ecstatically while playing some chords.
Sherlock was eight years old. He takes the run-up, determined to make a nice jump. Mycroft is so kidnapped by his book that he realizes what is happen at the last moment, or so he lets him believe. A funny expression of amazement and resignation in front of Sherlock's childish idiocy is drawn on Mycroft's face. Sherlock jump and his thin, small body impacts against Mycroft's fat and soft body. They fall to the ground, one to snort and the other to laugh happily. Mycroft was fat when he was a kid. Fat and soft and it was a pleasure for Sherlock to stay on him. He found reassuring the mass of fat that surrounded him from head to toe.
<< It must have snowed a lot if you call here the army, Mr Inspector >> she observes, continuing to stealthily look at John. These short and elusive glances annoy the doctor, which is rather strange, given his renowned patience with the weakest people.
Sherlock comes out of the bathroom, relieving John of the embarrassing situation. Lestrade illustrates the case and John listens to them, taking his seat in his chair. Seeing Sherlock return to the role of the  consulting detective fills him with joy. Sherlock was locked with the plaster in his leg so long time that John  feared he would go mad. Luckily helping Mary had distracted him enough. Now, deprived of the plaster, Sherlock can move, albeit with crutches, and return to investigate. John already sees his eyes light up at the idea of investigating. He definitely needs a new case.
John also thinks their landlady's attitude is strange. In reality there is no one thing that is not strange related to this case. They are all crying over the death of the woman who almost killed Sherlock. Perhaps the only sane is Mycroft. Or maybe he's the only one whose empathy works as a switch capable of turning on only for some people and not for others.
<< But aren't you a bit frail to be a ski teacher? >> asks the woman, ignoring the outstretched hand. She scrutinizes him attentively, with a light in her brown eyes that is not at all reassuring. The only vital and mobile part of that shapeless mask that is her face. Sherlock is afraid he made a big mistake in lying to her. << My brother was a ski teacher >> she says, without waiting for a reply from him. << He got fooled by the fresh snow and fell into a precipice, damn idiot >>. She points at the fork. << Eat! >> sort to him.
<< That damned pit. Mr Holmes speculated that it may have been the work of one of my former attendants, the old Stilton. I sent him away because he had opposed with all his might at the beginning of the works, saying that the area where we wanted to build the new branch of the Club was friable and everything would collapse. The architect disagreed and neither did the geologist that I contacted. When the pit was discover, Hataway also went to knock on Stilton's door to find out if he had to do with those corpses. The man denied it and the inspector was agree with him. "Stilton's a little screwed up, but he isnt a killer, Hugh," he said to me. Mr. Holmes, however, took the matter seriously and therefore decided to investigate undercover. Or, at least, so he told me >>.
<< You have no fault, Lizzy. The faults are of those men and women who have set up all this mess >> John try to remedy.
<< Nobody outside this office will know about your presence within these walls >> says the manager << Just say at the reception that you have booked the 'Ocean Blue' suite >>.
<< It is not her fault. She ... oh, leave me alone! >> shouts, rebelling against their hands that insist on holding him down. << You don't understand anything! >> he exclaims, while the devices around him ring, highlighting an abnormal acceleration of the heartbeat.
<< Oh my God, but you is not well, sir! I immediately call an ambulance >> the little man yells. << Even for him, I would say >> he adds, turning his worried gaze to the Martin.
He turns and sees himself standing in front of a large mahogany desk. From the fine leather armchair his father watches him sternly. The elbows resting on the armrests, the fingers of the hands joined at the height of the chest. Standing beside him, a younger Mycroft makes his gaze travel from father to brother. Invisible drops of sweat bead on Mycroft's forehead betray his tension.
<< Shut up! >> shouts the girl, trying to pounce on her brother. Greg springs and, with a speed proven by years of experience, tackles one and enters defense of the other. John and Sherlock look at him in admiration.
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly. The light in the room hurts his eyes. He twists his nose by puffing. His disapproval does not go unnoticed and the lights are dimmed. Encouraged by the twilight, Sherlock opens his eyelids and meets his brother, sitting on the chair beside him.
<< You are such a drama queen >> he chuckles, placing light kisses on Sherlock's completely inert pale hand.
He takes the crutches and slowly, putting his foot carefully on the ground, he heads for the bathroom.
He grabs Sherlock's face and bites his lips to force him to open them. The tongue that enters his mouth causes Sherlock to gag. The man walks away as abruptly as he threw himself on him. Free from the weight of that body, Sherlock falls along the wall and finds himself seated. The smell of the attacker's sperm reaches Sherlock’s nostrils and vomiting finally finds its outlet.
This, however, does not come. Sherlock barely opens one eye, wary, and finds Mary motionless, her hand raised fifty centimeters from her face. The vague gaze, the grim expression. It almost seems that someone has stopped time, as they usually do in the obvious and banal plot movies that John likes so much. Sherlock is almost tempted to raise his hand and touch her, to realize if all this is really happening or is the result of a hallucination. Suddenly, however, the woman recovers and leaves the room, leaving him alone.
John nods, since he has found himself having to load Sherlock on the back, force him into the taxi, reassuring the driver that he is not dealing with a drug addict and his babysitter. Then, John drag Sherlock up the 17 steps, let him fall on the bed. And, finally, transporting himself to his room to take care of his aching back.
John brings his hand close to cover his eyes and tries to breathe slowly. Very slowly. So slowly it seems almost an apnea.
<< And here I am >> says John, making Sherlock laugh again and, god, now he knows he will do everything to continue to hear him laugh like that.
When it does a profession that empowers to take care and 'fix' these human machines, everything becomes more difficult. This professionist feels compelled to heal them, to save them. The impotence is even stronger because this professionist have a greater knowledge of what is happening to them. This knowledge on the one hand helps to take care, on the other it is a boulder on the chest for the one who cares of the others.
Inspector Hataway proved to be an incompetent capable of making to Sherlock even regret the Yardes with which he usually has to deal. The policeman looked at him from head to feet, immediately saying that he did not need a London dandy playing the modern Maigret. Sherlock silenced him with a precise deduction on his unprofessional relationship with the only female agent chosen in the district << By the way, she grants herself to you only for the promotion that you promise her >>. Sherlock didn't earn the inspector's sympathies, of course.
<< And you saw well falling into a snowfield >> she says disgusted, shaking his head. << You come from the city, don't you? >>.
John leaves the pub followed by the half-sleepy puppy. He stroll slowly, enjoying the cold but pleasant evening. When John reaches 221B everything is still shrouded into the silence. He climbs the 17 steps holding the puppy in his arms.
<< She was arrested, Sherlock. She is in prison now, where it is right that she is for what she has done to you and to all the others >> Mycroft explains to him and in a slightly too peremptory way, notes John.
<< We will go out the kitchen door, skip the fence and reach my car, parked on the street near the mailbox, okay? >> Kelly whispers and the child, clinging to his reassuring arm, nods in terror.
The memories of those terrible days spent between cramps, retching, high fever and hallucinations invade Sherlock mind. He doesn't want to go back there. He doesn't want to fall prey to his nightmares, not yet.
<< Your brother is missing and you are wasting time making me an interrogation? >> John screams, pointing the finger at him. << Why don't you call someone of yours and ask him to check the phone records, so that it can find out if Sherlock has received phone calls or text messages or anything else that can help us understand where he is? Do I have to remind you that a madman who claims to be a consulting criminal has decided to elect himself as Sherlock's huge fan? >>.
<< There is no one here! >> instead shouts one of the rescuers. John quickly pulls away from Greg. He dry his face, by leaning over the edge of the ravine.
<< Finally dressed in a decent way >> nods Sherlock. John glares at him. << With these you are perfect >> he adds passing a pair of glasses with a large, thick and black frame.
<< Can't you take me to Hataway? We will tell him that you found me while I was wandering the street. I won't get you in trouble >> Sherlock says, putting his joint hands under his chin. Mary seems to think it over for a few moments. Then she shakes her head, vigorously.
<< I thought so too >> George nods. << Since then I have seen her get worse. She hasn't said anything to me anymore. She stays closed for hours in her room. She doesn't go out anymore. She doesn't eat anymore. I tried to tell mom, but she >>, George says between his teeth in a bad expression of anger, << She only thinks of herself and that idiot of her lover >>. He growls by sinking his nails into his thigh. << Mom says that it's adolescence, which will happen to me and all these bullshit. All Lizzy has been doing for two months now are normal changes due to adolescence! Mom does not realize, however, that Lizzy is sinking more and more >> he says, the voice broken by emotion. << Dad noticed Lizzy changement and tried to talk to mom and she ... >> George sighs, closing his eyes for a long moment. << It ended as always. With a fight between them and dad was thrown out of the house, accused of not being a good father, of seeing the rottenness behind everything, of being a detective even in our home >> he concludes in a whisper.
