bright costume, the helmet had little wings on the side of it, so when Tony found his first photo of it, he laughed and the name stuck.” Steve stretched out and crossed his legs.
“Why.” Peter tried not to sound too shocked, he was honestly surprised he even waited this long to ask again, Peter had tried to keep Tony’s mind away from his own life, letting his Dad make his own decisions.
Tony finally was able to full taking in the state of Steve, reaching automatically for a cut on his forehead, checking him over, “God, Steve, what have they done to you? Is that your blood?!” Steve just continued to laugh, short of breath and overjoyed. Tony finally relaxed, gripping the back of Steve’s suit tightly. Gripping the back straps and refusing to let go. Steve’s laughs reverberated through Tony’s body.
“Yeah, well, fell out with the old man… again… I have like the million dollar account there if I need it but, like I’ve never really had to struggle away from Howard so, Steve encouraged me to ditch the flat in the city, try my hand at actual student living, and yeah it’s nicer than any other student has but it’s mine and Howard doesn’t know where it is… so bonus. I guess he does now, Steve has probably told him already…” Tony sighed and turned to take the cleaning cloth from Peter’s hand, Tony was proud of himself for at least for having a space away from the name Stark, on those nights where it was just him and Steve in the flat, trying to stay warm and having dinner around candle lights before Tony had fixed the wiring of the flat. (he broke it in the first place so it’s only fair) “Anyway, Whose your family like brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, like I already know ‘Uncle Rhodey’ which I’m super glad about, what about Uncle Stane or Uncle Robertson?” Peter raised his shoulders at the last two, he’d never heard of those two before.
“Oh, how strong you are! You really remind me of Tony’s polite friend, have you met Steve?” Peter was just caught off guard with the question, “Yeah I’ve met Steve, he’s helped me while I’ve been here. He’s super nice.” Ana gave his hand a squeeze, whispering closely in his ear. “You are a very lost soul right now Peter, do not worry.” He relaxed into her grip, the pair continued to work in silence, almost dancing around each other as they made the dinner.
His Pops ran over to his Dad, Peter could only watch as his Pops skidded the last part on his knees, hugging his Dad’s waist tightly. Gripping at the fabrics of his cotton t-shirt. His Pops looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes, something he’d never seen before. He lifted his head from Tony’s waist, looking up at his husband, “We are getting him home and when we do…” Steve looked over onto Tony’s desk, “We will find those joggers and spend the entire… month. Just holding onto our boy. Ok? And we’re going to just not let him out of our sights for the next ten years!” Tony gave a wet chuckle, “more like twenty!” The recording ended. “End of Message.” Karen spoke gently. She could sense his wet face, Peter’s hands fumbled and struggled to pull off his mask, gasping for air when he finally did.
“Yeah, I know Uncle Rhodey.” Peter frozen for a second, Tony pulled his head out of the cupboard, with a beaming grin, “Good to know I got Rhodey to stick around for a while!”
Barton walked out to the living room, his waterproof coat and hair dripping water onto the floor. He called back out to Steve and Natasha, “Place stinks of bleach except for the bathroom sink, he wanted us to find the blood, we can send the sample back-“ Steve could hear it before he could see it, the sound of a bullet zipping through the air, ruined the silence of the apartment, the shatter of the glass as it burst into the room, the computer exploded in a flash. Steve leaned over Natasha’s body to protect her from the shot. He heard another bullet ping off the shield on his back. But he knows he’s a big target and before Barton can get an arrow fired back, Steve’s upper thigh is grazed with a bullet. He let out a cry of pain. He grits his teeth and pull them both to the floor.
“I’m trying really hard not to throw you out that window in this moment.” Peter turned to Peggy, “What did you want to ask me then.” Peggy gave a sympathy look to her godson. “We took the sample from Tony without his knowledge but yes, Your DNA was fascinating according to our science department,” Peggy lifted a clip board and check the file underneath the first page. “You’re DNA flagged the parental match to both your parents, Tony and …” Tony lifted his head to stare directly at Peggy, who assessed the situation and with a quick look at Peter’s slowly shaking head… “and other parent. Which should genetically be impossible.” Tony let out a disappointed breath.
The group smiled gently at the camera, unsure of what words are the most important to pass on. Thor however looked on to Barton’s words. “I have an idea of how to communicate to my young Nephew.” Thor walked back away from the group and shot up through the air and through the ceiling with a loud crash.
“I’ll be coming back home and I’m bringing our son with me, this had gone on too long. Besides,” Steve curled his fist and called his shield to his arm using the magnetic technology in his glover that Tony had developed. “It’ll be fun to see you swoon when a handsome fella like me walks through.” Steve winked and did a short but quick jog back from Tony’s wrath, Tony opened his mouth to start an argument, finger raised and pointed at Steve’s chest. “Swoon?!” Steve raised his eyebrows as a challenge. “I’m pretty sure you’ll be dropping to your knees when you a twenty one year old me, rocking in my jeans and band t-shirts.” Steve laughed loudly, walking over to the desk to grab his watch. “Nah, I prefer the fitted suits anyway.” Tony smiled and tilled his head, like he’d did whenever he couldn’t quite believe his luck, stood in his workshop, which had been demolished in areas to steal cabling from the walls around the house, to power and develop the transporting to Peter.
“PETER!” Peter’s head and everyone else’s in the room shot up to look at the orb which had created a wide-open crack where one Tony Stark stood on the other side of calling out to his son. Peter ran forward before anyone could grab him behind the safety glass. “Dad!?” Peter stopped just before the crack, his hair blowing in every direction due to the winds the crack was causing. His dad looked exhausted, he was still wearing the shirt he wore when he left his time, his trousers switched out for joggers, his goatee and hair looking particularly shaggy with lack of care. “Oh, thank god, Peter! Are you ok!? FRIDAY get the team down here now!”
“Peter, please don’t go to Barbados. And please, don’t let me say I hate him… he was always a dick, but I said I hated him the last time I saw him. It’s one of my biggest regrets. If I say nothing… it will be better than I hate him.” His Dad his tears, grabbing an oil rag to his side, wiping his face, Tony stared at the family photo, “I really miss you buddy, we both do, its really quiet here without you. I haven’t been into your study, so I don’t know if you have any hot chocolate mugs stacked up. I should probably give you into trouble for not cleaning them but you’re not here.” Peter could hear the boom of something heavy hitting the floor behind his Dad. Enough for the camera and the entire desk to shake.
“I’m glad you know about me being here Aunt Peggy, but I want to go home, to my parents as soon as possible, I’ll do anything to help but I won’t tell you anything about the future.” Peggy was watching the pair closely, she turned and whispered to him, “You may look like Tony, but your determination is all Steve.”
“Boss, sir and younger sir, Thor has arrived outside the complex,” FRIDAY informed. Peter climbed up over the couch to stand behind his parents. “If he burns up the front lawn grass again he’s paying the gardener bill this time!” Tony yelled out to FRIDAY. The elevator binged as the sleek doors opened for Thor. “Tony, Captain and young nephew Peter! I am pleased to see you are doing well. I stopped by to bring you the gauntlet from today’s enemy!” Thor bellowed to the family. Peter ran out from behind the couch to jump and give his Uncle Thor a hug, but before Peter could take the final leap for a hug, his Uncle Clint appeared from behind Thor’s large body and stole the hug.
Left with his own thoughts again, Tony focused on the digital black clock on his desk. When the clock ticked over to four am, Tony snuck out of his bed. He slowly opened the door, stepping carefully across the hallway. He carefully turned the doorknob into Steve’s room and shut it behind him. He turned on the bedside lamp.
He held out his hand to help Clint off of the the machine’s metallic board. Clint reached forward and groaned at the stiffness of his bone. “Next time we go camping, I’m pitching my tent at least three miles away from yours.” Steve chuckled lightly, “Next time I think we should just get a motel.” Clint stretched a little once he stood up, reaching down to touch his toes and back up. He smiled at Steve, “Ready to bust out of here?” Steve nodded enthusiastically.
“HEY NEPHEW! YOU MISS ME?!” Peter tried to stick his arms between himself and his Uncle’s sweaty tactical suits creating some distance. “Help!?” Peter cried out, “ He hasn’t showered for like 3 days!” Steve used his good arm to prop himself off the couch, as Tony held out his arms to help Steve if he needed some balance. “Bird-man drop my kid!” Tony called out as he walked over to inspect the gauntlet left behind by the villain, that Thor held out to him. Peter managed to push himself away by slipping out of his navy hoodie.
“To keep me and everyone else safe, blah, blah, blah, whatever helps you sleep at night ‘Captain.’ I’ve heard all of this before, instead I’ve got my best friend spying on me when I’m not even allowed to know where in the world, he his or if he’s coming back home to the shared apartment, we rent even though he’s not been here for 5 months!”  Tony took a large swig of his coffee.
“Anyway, long story short, got into the databanks. Biggest computer rooms I’ve ever seen, so I look up Peter’s file.” Steve shook his head and sighed. “What did I say about looking into the kid?” Natasha jutted her chin out, slightly annoyed that she had gone to all this effort to find out more answers for him. Just to be rejected. “I know mostly everything about the kid now. He had blood work taken by Tony when he first arrived, the system came back with a match. Well, more specifically two matches for his parental lineage.” Steve shrugged one of his shoulders, he really couldn’t care about this anymore. He wasn’t going to deal with his feelings for Tony right now.
He pulled out a white box or at least It was white a long time ago, now faded with many years of life protecting its valuable content. He carefully lifted the lid off the top of the box. Pulling away a small tufted of cotton as well. “This was Steve’s pocket watch.” Tony pulled it out, holding it in his palm out towards Peter. “His mom couldn’t afford much at the time, but she saved up for a year for this one.” He flipped it over to show the back, it was engraved, the tarnished silver hadn’t lost its message.
“Jarvis called, gave me a heads up that he  has been in touch with Steve while on his mission. Steve heading back to the US now but Howard is going to come ‘visit’ in 2 days’ time. So I’m sorry but I need your help to move all my shit out to a new apartment.” Peter’s mouth formed an ‘o’ and his eyebrows furrowed. He relaxed his face quickly, “Of course, uh why are we moving?” Tony walked back round to the cupboard in the hallway pulling out boxes. “When Howard finds out where I am living he comes to ‘visit’ and judge and just ruin where I live. He doesn’t know I live with Steve or I lived should I say, with his greatest creation. This place and me for that matter would ‘never be good enough for Captain Rogers’ so, when he finds out where I am stay we need to move.” Tony had already thrown all the papers Peter had stacked up on the kitchen chairs into a box and had moved on to the kitchen area with another, haphazardly chucking items in the boxes. Peter quickly stood up, not quite sure what to do with himself. He decided the best course of action, Peter walked over to Tony stopped him in his place by grabbing the side of his arms till Tony faced Peter, and gave him a hug.
Tony had asked him to protect the kid, Tony knew about Peter, who he was, and he made --Tony happy. But right now, this kid, was just that, he was a kid, who was as lost as he was last year when he woke up from his years in the ice. “Peter, I’m not going to say it will be ok but… I’m here, so is Tony and I promise you I will find a way to get you back home.”
“Ready Boss?” Clint typed the last of the code, holding his hand steady over the enter key for the all clear to start.
Tony walked around to the other side of the bed, next to the desk and turned on the lamp, to create a soft glow of light. He flopped down on the grey duvet and gripped the navy throw between his fingers. Steve walked over to the dresser and pulled out two sets of pjs, chucking a pair at Tony, they landed on his head. Too lazy to move them Tony just groaned. Steve decided to jump into the bathroom, quickly change out of his civilian clothes. By the time he’d changed and walked back into the room, Tony had changed and set himself in the bed, the spot furthest from the door. Steve offered to get them a glass of water for the night, which Tony accepted.
They both knew how to put on the fake, interested and corporate glam smile, Tony knew it well. Maybe he should get to know him, see if there is something behind the name. Tony shook himself out of his chain of thought. Back to the moment, sitting in front of Peter James Stark. Possibly Peter James Stark- Hammer? Ew. No… but … maybe? Focus! Tony thought to himself.
Natasha watched as Barton dug around in the wound to find the bullet. She hadn’t received access to Steve’s file, but she could guess that this needed to happen and fast if Barton’s jerky motions were anything to go by. She watched as he suffered through a front-line surgery without painkillers. He was something. She schooled her face to not show the admiration for his ability to suffer through the pain, jealous even, but that skill requires practice and it wasn’t worth the pain.
Clint peaked above the nearest desk, spotting a beat up blue pickup truck parked just at the corner of the hanger bay. Bingo! Clint quickly dropped back down behind the desk, using his sign language to inform Steve of his plan. Steve got it, they snuck up to the side of the truck, Steve pulled himself up and over the edge of the truck bed. Pulling a large tarp to cover himself, hiding under the shield to break up his human body shape. Clint snuck up and into the driver’s seat, poking around in the glove box and the sun-visor he found the keys to the truck. Looking in the back seat, Clint pulled forward a shield hat and jacket. Pulling the jacket on and zipping it up to cover the Hawkeye badge. Clint assessed the situation outside the truck, whispering down into his shoulder, knowing full well Steve could hear him.
Peter woke up with a blanket partially annoying his face, he lazily reached up to move it and raised his head to survey the area, Tony must have been up already because there was a space where he had been next to Peter. Peter could smell the Chinese leftovers just in front of his head, he turned around to pull down the blue blanket down from the ceiling of their fort. He sat up and checked the room for Tony. Tony was sliding boxes down the hall towards the door, using his shoulders help.
“Hello Peter and Boss. How can I help today? Is everything ok?” Tony changed his mind, he was in love. Technology is amazing. “Hey Karen can you search the local area for an apartment immediately available to rent that are reasonably priced.”
Steve had wandered into the Barnes family preparing a stew dinner in his apartment, Steve broke down crying in the hallway. Buck scrambling forward to catch him. Begging his friend to let it all out. Now his best friend was still alive, after all this time, just in time for him to come to terms with the fact that he’d lost his best… who was he kidding now, he could say anything he wanted to about Tony, his crush
The loud thump of six knocks of the door echoed through the flat. Followed by a loud, “Tony, It’s your old pal Obadiah!” Tony let out a sigh and reshuffled his hoodie. He muttered to himself, “Let’s get this over with.” He shut the door behind himself, leaving Peter standing in the middle of his room with nothing to do. He decided it was time to figure out a way home, he searched around his room for his wrist band shooters and the suit. Pulling off the covers of the bed on to the floor frantically searching for them. He pulled the large pile of new clothes Tony bought for him off the chair on to the floor. Turning a full 360 degrees around, He finally looked up on the ceiling, the shooters were still attached to the blanket hanging off the light fixture, he must have climbed up with its last night. He could hear the faint polite chat between Stane and Tony, the shuffling of paper work. He pulled out the suit mask and wrist bands and sat them up right on the desk, turn to check the blinds were still shut and the door was closed, Peter turned his attention to Karen.
“ So if Peter brought a dame or fella back tomorrow, you’d let them sleep in the same bed?” Steve placed his hands on his hips. Tilting his head up and slightly right, raising his eyebrows.
Home, something that until now, Steve hadn’t even realised he’d given up on. His Tony, was alive and well, he needed a shave but other than that he was living his life. “Tony. I thought you were dead, If I had known, I’d have come straight home! … You thought I would have left you alone?”
The lack of conversation filled the room with the sounds of the news broadcaster and the yelling of a couple outside the door. Peter leaned back, pulling up the pillows to the backboard to give him a comfortable place to relax on. He rested his head back looking up to the ceiling. He let out a soft whistle.  He let the world embrace his senses. He could smell the petrol fumes from the car outside, the smell of the hotdog vendor a block down the street. He turned over on his shoulder, pulling the blanket up over his shoulders, he needed sleep, he’d get prepared for washing and packing for the next week, if shield protocol was the same, then they were going to send out the best spies to find him.
Tony slowly walked around the edge of the desk, his head tilted slightly as if he were approaching a frightened child. Steve’s jaw was slack, Tony’s beard had grown out, he had on one of his roughed up mechanics top, clearly oil stained, as it should be. His beat up painting joggers, falling slightly off his right hip. His breath left him, just for a second, filling that away for another day. A very different man from the one down stairs dressed in his three piece suit. Tony Rogers, he shivered at the thought. He raised his arms up towards Tony, Tony Stark who stopped to question Steve’s intentions, but the frightened Captain really just wanted his friend back.
Tony had been debating the idea in his head before dismissing himself once again. Tony made it three steps beyond the desk on his one hundredth and sixth loop before he stopped. Scrunching up his face, turned round to face the desk and stared down at the spare (prototype-untested possibly unreliable)
Tony’s smile fell as the large wooden doors clicked shut. Turning back to his computer he inspected his coding. Out-sourcing development is a bullshit title if Tony had ever heard of one, like his father’s almost daily five o’clock ‘
Tony whipped his back up, effectively pushing Natasha off of his back and out of his space. “My Kid?! Huh! I’m twenty-one! I’m nobody’s father, I’m just four years older than him! I can barely take care of myself, let alone care about him! He’s just going to disappear one day anyway!” Tony paced the length of his desk and back, Natasha took two steps back, cautiously towards her chair, slowly, taking her steps slowly as to not creek the floor boards.
“Secondly, my days off?! I’ve hand 1 in the last 6 months!! It was yesterday by the way! I’ve not even had time to call anyone and now you’re suddenly offering me a holiday? You are just full of its Howard.” Howard screwed up his face as if he didn’t understand anything Steve was saying.  “Phone call? Who the hell are you calling Steve all or friends from the war are dying or dead! Who wants to talk to you?”
Peter shook his head clear of the memory, looking up to his future Aunt. She smiled softly, “Your Dad took it as well as he could, he thought he’d lost Tony and you. For a guy that doesn’t have much anchoring him to some sort of a normal life, it was a lot to lose at once. Tony for him was a life line, but you were they possibility of so much more.” Peter didn’t quite know how to feel, to see his Pop’s as someone that couldn’t live without his dad, he didn’t know what it would look like. To see his Pop defeated.
Tony was the image of a young man in his father’s clothes. It it was her own fault, she could have been here for him, she could have taken some time to check in on him rather than chasing after Peter and Steve. God she’d fucked up. “He’s…” She could do this, tell the truth, “I’ve been keeping his busy… I’m sorry Anthony, he wasn’t ignoring you, i’ve kept him in the dark about most of this. He. He produced the best results for Shield without you in the picture to…distract him.” Tony’s face dropped, his mouth slightly open is shock, his eyes wide, raw emotions that he couldn’t quite understand yet. “I was a part of that Anthony. And I truly am so sorry that I hurt you with that decision, I kept him away from you and that hasn’t been good for either of you to be perfectly honest. I’m sorry it took me this long to realise this.”
Steve watched as the father and son made their way into the back of the truck, silently shutting the door behind themselves. Steve, Clint and Natasha followed suit. Steve and Clint jumped in the back with Bucky, on hand to watch, just in case as Natasha jumped in the driver setting. Steve sat down cross legged next to his best friend. He glanced into the back seat of the truck. Peter and his Dad, were curled into each other. Steve wished he’d have someone like that. He couldn’t make sense of his emotions right now, he wanted to scream, cry and break something. He wanted to go home and curl up in his bed.
Peter woke up on auto pilot, he wrapped the duvet round his shoulders, his parent’s voices muffled through the walls. Peter could barely open his eyes, rubbing the tiredness out of them as he walked into the hall way. Peter yawned stumbling down the hallway to his parents. Peter heard the voices raise as he got closer.
“Well, we will need to speed up production on the travel suit and Peter’s return suit. Thor, come with me, I’ll need the lightening to test the material.” Bruce called out to the group and turned to head toward his make shift lab at the back of the garage. Natasha and Clint were rotated out to sleep and left to go upstairs to their floors. Sam took the material list off the the top of Tony’s desk. “I’ll continue to look for more of the elements to stabilise this thing.” Steve nodded in response.
“Peter!?” Tony called out “Steve have you found Peter?” Peter turned to face Steve as he pushed off of the wall, he looked up the gap between the U-turn stairs, “Yeah, just needed some fresh air, we’re fine down here, Tony maybe some more Ice cream is needed, this time with Churros?” Peter perked up at the mention of churros and ice cream, “Churros?”
“Peter, god kiddo, your Pops and I were worried sick! Right quickly while this holds, I need to test its stability.” Tony from the future quickly looked frantically round the room for something to send when Uncle Bruce came sliding into frame of the crack’s window to home, “Here, send these! Hello Peter, I need you to step back!”
Steve noted that the kid was rubbing his temples as if he had a headache, Steve had felt bad about being so rude earlier, he thought he might as well ask if he was alright, “You ok kid?” Gesturing with his eyebrows and tilt of the head toward Peter’s motions on his head.
“Oh joy! Two professional secret keepers, a cadet who was assigned to put up with me as well as the world war veteran for friends and a family I pay to keep around me, What life do you think I have! I’m living the million dream.” Sarcasm practically dripping for every word out of his mouth, “besides, I don’t see you rushing to tell Steve that I’m alive. Fuck me and Fuck Peter, He’s not my son, not yet, I don’t want kids, I want to get blackout wasted and just wake up in someone’s bed and build robots! I want to live!”
Tony sat legs stretched out in front of him, relaxing on a bench in front of the atrium’s fountain, playing on his phone, waiting for
Steve hadn’t moved. Tony was dead. His best friend was dead. He could feel the burn, running from his knees down his legs, he needed to move, he needed to see… he didn’t know what to do. Tony was dead, Howard got Tony killed. He clasped his hands together. Closing his eyes. Steve used his hand on his knee to get up from the floor. Natasha took a hesitant step forward as Steve stepped towards the door, she held her hand up in a stop motion. He let out a soft gasp of breath, his tears silently flowing down his face. She reached up, gently swiping her thumb over his cheek to wipe away his tears. “He was my best friend.” She nodded for him, whether it was for Tony or Howard.
A shiver ran down Tony’s spine. He was speechless. Steve is and always would be soldier and Tony knew that being the best soldier, came with a lot of secret baggage when talking about what happens in the battlefield but the thought that Steve, the precious, church going choir boy, was ‘effective’ in war. Tony stepped to the side. Walking around his aunt. Tony blinked repeatedly to hold back the tears, his lower lip open, pouting. “Let’s go. I… need some time to think about this.” Tony shut his mouth. Turning quickly to march his way towards the entrance.
“Director Carter, where is our son? You promised to take care of him, yet as far as I hear it, he’s in some shady motel?!” Tony shrugged in response, Peggy looked on, hiding her fear as best as she could. Her future Godson and his Husband were rather terrifying when they wanted to be. “Huh. A shrug little me?! Where the fuck is, he?” Tony looked ready to jump through the portal to attack himself, Steve grabbed Tony’s upper body to stop him. Steve turned to place Tony behind him, gripping his hand before turning back to Peggy and young Tony, “Let me make myself clear. Either you find Peter before we open this portal up again, Or I come through and get him myself. I don’t care who gets hurt while I get him home.” He flexed his back muscles and shoulders. “And Tony, Young Tony I mean. You’d regret putting the kid in harm’s way. So, do yourself a favour and find him.” Tony was taken aback by just how… sincere Steve was. He took a very small step back at the ‘almost disappointed in you’ face on Steve’s face.
and Peter’s gaze flew up to Tony as he quickly approached the pair, Peter let go of his Pop’s sprinting towards his Dad, he let the blanket over his shoulders drop to the ground.
“Have fun playing dress up with my dad as a glorified spy. I hope you two are very happy together! Don’t call me again. Bye asshole and for the record it is none of your concern who Peter is!” Tony slammed the phone down on the holder on the wall, breathing deeply. Peter just stood in shock, he’d never seen his parents argue like this before.
Tony stood hunched over the desk, hastily, he typed the final line of code into the program, glancing behind his shoulder as Bruce and Clint helped Steve attach the small devices under the armour pieces of Steve’s suit. Steve exposed his neck back ever so slightly, so that Bruce could place a small device on the inside of the neck lining of his suit. Steve looked over and made contact with Tony’s eyes giving him an anxious smile. He nodded slightly, and Tony grinned and nodded back. The screen alerted Tony to the devices connecting to the system Whipping his head back round to accept the start up of the program. “All operational on my end.” Steve rolled his shoulder and neck, he nodded his thanks to Bruce and Clint.
Peter woke up to a pillow being slapped against his face, he tried to wake himself up to react a bit better but before he could get his bearings he was hit once again. A deep voice called out, “Now, I didn’t know Tony let his … overnight guests stay over, in Roger’s room no less.” The pillow once again headed towards Peter’s face but this time, Peter used his super speed and strength to grab the arm in its place. Peter glared at the man standing above his bed. “Obadiah, leave him alone, here,” Tony poked his head round the corner. Holding out a brown A4 envelope towards Stane. “Look I’ve signed off on the new rocket propulsion system and I fixed the wing design on the series 53.” Stane turned round to face Tony with a devious smirk, “There was nothing broken about the wing design Tony, but thank you for your contribution to this month sells on the army contract.” Stane turned round to look Peter up and down. “When did you start letting them stay round? What does Rogers think of this, In his room, even?” Tony frowned at Stane’s feigned interest and point towards the door. “Thanks, for the monthly visit Stane, time to leave me alone again.” Stane chuckled, as he walked out the door he turned once more to look back at Peter. “Strong for your size boy, impressive…” nodding to himself. Peter held his glare at Stane until he left the room. When Peter finally left his room Stane was almost out the door. “Tony, remember what your father said, enjoy,” He gestured towards Peter at the end of the hall. “… this life while you’re at college but come May when you graduate you are a Stark Industries owner, you can’t be seen keeping company with these types of men.” Tony held a stare at Stane “Yeah, yeah I got it. Leave now, report back to Howard or whatever it is you do.” Tony shut the door loudly behind Stane. Peter jumped at the noise, he then pulled his blanket cap back up his shoulders. Tony turned and leaned his back against the door, closing his eyes he leaned his head up to thump it behind the door. Tony turned his head looking towards Peter, “you know he’s only 28?” Peter’s mouth opened in shock.
Peter remember the trip when his parents went to fight somewhere in Australia, he wasn’t left to the care of a kind old butler, he was left with 2 of his Uncles and his Aunt, he realised that this was now the longest time he’d ever been away from his family. Ever. His tears began to stream down his face, Tony held open his arms as he met Peter, gripping him tightly. “You, are the hope I had that I would get more than 2 people to care about me.” Peter gripped Tony’s back tightly. Lost for words on his Dad’s joy. The sat together on the couch for the next half an hour in silence, enjoying Tony’s embrace, not as strong as his Dad’s but the emotion behind it was.
Peter coughed awkwardly, “hi me again, right here still, didn’t move, wasn’t involved in the hug. But could I get like a glass of juice or something?” Peter stood like a bit of an idiot at the corner of the hallway, “Of course Peter here,” Tony opened fridge grabbing the carton of apple juice, Steve grabbed a glass from the shelf above Tony at the same time, Steve noted that it was the same juice as his favourite brand, he silently hoped there was still some left for him once Peter had some, It had been so long since a glass of juice or even water was guaranteed for him. Peter thanked them and sat down on the couch but before he could say anymore, someone knocked on the flat door.
! Multiple! Who needs more than one island!” Steve let out a chuckle, Natasha called through the small window between the truck and driver, “I wouldn’t say no, Stark jr still single right?” She gave a cheeky wink to Clint, who laughed, when she turned back to focus on the road, she gave herself a knowing look, watching Steve in the rear-view mirror.
drawer on the wooden chest of drawers and selected the first pair of PJs that he could grab. Throwing his clothes over the already full hamper, Peter pulled on his PJs and dived into bed. Wrapped in the red and blue tartan throw Peter drifted off into his dreams.
Tony placed his hand into his pockets, playing with a little bit of lint nervously between his fingers. Howard took a slight step towards his wife. Peter watched as Howard and Tony stood side by side, appreciating the similarity of their posture. Peter shuffled slightly to stand in frame of the mirror across the room, comparing himself against his Dad and his Grandfather. He could spot similarities between all three of them, the shape of their hairline, the jawline and maybe their ears at a push.
“Karen you still alive?” He pulled the suit out the backpack side pocket, “Yes Peter, status update battery at eighteen percent, No communication with Stark family servers. Where are we now Peter?” He moved to sit the mask on the desk, leaning up against the empty pen pot. He grabbed the kettle and poured it into his dinner. “Georgia. I think, some lucky Shield agent spotted me outside of North Carolina, so I’ve just stopped now. I think I’ll be in the clear for a couple of days.”
One day he’d get her cook book back. It was his after all, if only the world didn’t think Captain America was dead. Steve held his hand up to the glass, smiling at his mother’s personal notes, reminding herself to make double if ‘Baby Barnes’ came round for dinner and Not to listen to his grandmother and give the sauce ten minutes extra. Steve closed his eyes. Giving a short prayer for his mother under his breath. For just a moment of peace in this crazy world he found himself in, he just wish she could be at home, that he could come back and show her how proud of him she could be.
“Sure” Peter walked across the ceiling opened the cupboard, and dropped two boxes down on the counter below. Tony was taking this extremely well, he was just glad that his son was healthy and had this under control, like it wasn’t killing him which was good and maybe he could make advancements in genetic mutation if he had the time.
Jarvis caught the pair off guard from coming from the direction past Howard’s office. He looked up at the pair, who were wide eyed, Peter looked over his shoulder to Tony, Tony shrugged and mouthed out to Jarvis, ‘This isn’t the worst thing you’ve seen me do.’ Jarvis tilled his head slightly, rolling his eye he stepped into the kitchen, “How may I help Sir.”
“Are you two quite finished?” Peggy’s sharp voice called out to the elevator crowd with a gentle but persistent tone. Once again, the Captain returned, coughing into his fist and stood to attention staring at the wall. Tony frowned at Steve, trying not to look too hurt at the 180, Steve can take when it comes to Tony.
He threw his head back on to the cushioned head rest. Time to himself, for the moment at least, time alone with his own thoughts, his mind wandered, he wiggled his toes in his boots trying to get the feeling back. When he wiggled his fingers, he heard the distinct sound of paper crinkling in his glove. His eye shot open. The photo!
“Now, I distinctly remember asking you to take care of him the last time we spoke, but right now my husband seems to have gone looking for him. Now, I’m usually forgiving but I need you to help me understand how this happened.” Tony stood face to face with the director with his arms crossed. Head tilted to the side, frown permanently etched on his face behind the sunglasses.
“I’ve done something to change the future.” Tony watched Peter’s face as it twitched subtly, fear flashing only for a second, he was gaining a poker face and Tony didn’t like it. This kid wasn’t getting a choice, he was going to have to make tough decisions on behalf of Tony and Tony didn’t like that either. This kid… his kid thought he knew what was going to happen but now it was all up in the air for both of them. Peter could disappear like in Back to the Future or just get to a future where he doesn’t exist. Tony had to help him.
He needed a plan.  If he could get in touch with his Pops, bring him home (somehow) and make the pair see that this was just a nothing moment of their lives and get them to fall in love with each other, then everything would be alright! Right?
“He knew they were going to die …He stood by and told me to say goodbye to my dad, knowing! Knowing he was going to die the next day!” Steve let out a sigh, this wasn’t a conversation for Peggy’s office, he understood why Tony was mad, at the same time would he have changed anything? Steve studied Tony’s face closely, the slight cut on his neck likely from shaving this morning.
Steve had to play up the acting, he needed to give himself enough time to get to Clint and then leave this place. Just enough to give them a head start against the Shield agents. Guess it's time for retirement or would it be dis-honourable discharge?
Steve blinked himself awake when they hit the tarmac roads, he’d have to say goodbye to Peter, the son he barely knew through the little time they had spent together and was never going to have the pleasure of meeting for himself. He’d find himself alone with no future to keep him grounded.
Wipe away a couple of tears in his eyes. “Ana, I just … I can’t get this equation to work and I need it to finish my thesis presentation and Obi called and...” Ana quickly made her way over to Tony, wrapping her arms over his shoulders, covering his eyes with one of her palms. The other gently running through the front of his hair, she let out a gentle shhhs, in Tony’s ear. She gently pulled him up and out of Howard’s chair. She let go of his head but took one of his and lead him through the house to the kitchen. Jarvis heard the pair coming in, he’d set the table for three, just in case Tony ever joined them, but quickly placed the pot down to grab an extra plate. By the time Tony had been placed down in the chair, Jarvis had begun to plate up dinner.
She finally was satisfied that Tony was alright and health enough for her to turn her attention to Peter, “Ah and you must be Peter!” Her Hungarian accent rang out through the halls of the main entrance, “Tony’s friend from school! Ah, you are adorable! Come here, Come here!” Peter blushed a little, he shuffled forward nervously, she took in his appearance and gave him a polite hug, patting down his hair. “Aww bless you are a young thing. Right you two go get unpacked, Tony you can show Peter to the room across from yours! I’ll need to get the key for it but come meet us in the garden and we will have a drink before dinner!” Tony gave Ana a small peck on the cheek before grabbing his duffle bag, nodding in the direction of the stairs for Peter to follow.
Steve hesitantly walked towards the group, his steps slow, feeling the crunch of the branches under his boots. He tried his best to school his face and features to be confident and less stressed
Steve shook his head of his train of thought, not possible. The kid would have told him? Maybe? Would he even want to know more about his future with Tony or without, he was close to Peter, that would have to be enough he guessed, but Peter took after his mannerisms…and the way he stood—
“Obi, what do I owe the displeasure? Stealing my father’s best rum again?” Obadiah had his arms held up at the height of his head, using his forearms to lean against the door frame, crossing his legs over one another. “Tony. My boy, been a while since you even set foot into the office, how would you know if I’d had a glass or two?” He smirked. He’d drank it. Tony always knew when he’d been drinking.
Tony turned around to Peter whose eyes were glassy with possible tears. Peter knew his dad had been lonely growing up, he hated Howard but to make it worse his mother was non-existent, she never knew where Tony was or what he was doing. Like now, they are moving flats in case his parents come visit but for Peter any length of time away from his parents was consider extremely strange.
Tony pulled down his white top that he’d fallen asleep in to make himself more presentable, he opened the door, and smiled kindly to the man behind the door, “Ah Robert, good to see you again!” He shook Robert’s hand firmly, “Good to see you are well, Young Master Anthony, I’m going to assume by your general appearance that you and your guest are not packed for the journey home.” Tony lifted his head proudly, “Ah, Robert, you know me so well!” Tony invited the older gentlemen into the apartment.
Tony and Steve slid down the faded grey cabinets to the floor. Tony holding Steve’s upper body against his chest as they heard Peter dive out the window when a piece of glass hit the floor. Tony shifted himself up to reach for a kitchen tea towel, so he could apply pressure to Steve’s arm. Steve set in motion a plan to try and get up, “Steve What are you doing?!” Tony called out, trying to pull Steve back down to a sitting position.
Tony was born from wealth, not class. He knew that, he could spend money like nobody’s business but not quite on the class stuff, like this dinner. Hammer insisted he pay even though it was practically a joke in poor taste, maybe two, three hundred dollars for them to have dinner, the last time he spent that on dinner, Tony took the engineering year and professors out for dinner and a couple of drinks at the end of last year. Different ways to spend a couple of hundred dollars change in your pocket. “But yeah, sure why not, that’s why we hire nannies and staffers anyway, so you don’t have to see the brats.” That’s when Hammer was pretty much a write off for Tony. But was that just the persona talking?
When Tony finally realised where he was, he immediately gripped the door frame to stop him entering the apartment. Rhodey walked into Tony’s back after opening the apartment door. “Tony come on its late, it’s time for bed.” He took a deep breath and stepped in. Rhodey watched, two steps behind him, cautiously as Tony made his way into his and Steve’s shared apartment. Steve’s leather jacket hung on the back of an old and battered red kitchen bar stool. Tony to the collar of the jacket in his hand, running his fingers along the seam.
“Well, with a little stop at the – “Howard was cut off by Tony, “at the Pentagon, right?” He leaned over his mother shoulder to ‘whisper’ in her ear, “don’t worry you’ll love the holiday menu at the commissary.” She tried to hide her smirk at Tony’s attitude. Peter was just amazed that a man who pushed his son into a mirror, can turn around he chat politely like this. But then again, this seemed normal to everyone.
“Either this ends well, and I strike 4 lines of murders off my ledger, that Shield are currently in possession of or in the worst case, I will be sent to prison in some backdoor and murdered by some inside guard or inmate.” Clint couldn’t make eye contact with her, she knew he had fought hard for to even have a benefit to doing this, 4 lines wasn’t much but she would take it, he wasn’t able to convince Shield of anything other than her murder though, so it drew a heavy line for her not to cross.
Steve turned quickly away from the device, “If something happened to him or Howard and I was in contact with them, I could be held responsible, if that device gave away their location. I really should just destroy it I… I just can’t quite do it.” Natasha raised her chin up slightly, as if she understood his situation, “what if it cheers you up though? This is a lonely career to be in, for all of us.” Steve turned back to look at the device. “One last time Wing-head, you there? What? Shut up Peter, you’re not in heaven, Ana’s stew does that to people!”
“Yes, sir, just a headache from the noise, my ears are just really sensitive to it.” Steve nodded, if he was honest with the kid, he would have been doing the same, he’d asked the DJ to turn down the music a bit when he walked in, it helped with the pain, but it wasn’t brilliant for him, especially after a 14-hour flight in the back of an old war bomber aircraft.
just laughed, hoping it was sign of some good luck, nodding down he sprinted up the stairs. Steve sprinted down the hallway. Stopping short of colliding with Nick Fury, he stood to attention, catching his breath, the only noise in the long office hallway, long free of its workers, only Fury and Steve stood in the environment . Fury titled his head inspecting Steve’s current state, shaking his head to himself, he sighed. “Director Carter’s office.”
Steve was taking in the appearance of the apartment and its current state of un-packing when he heard a soft whimper from Tony’s room, gently stepping his way down the hall and slowly peaking round the door to Tony’s room. Tony had completely kicked of the blanket covering him, his legs whipping from side to side from his position on the bed. Steve sighed and walked in the room and gently sat on the edge of the bed. Steve raised his hand to rub Tony’s back, hesitating just for a second for before running his hand up and down Tony’s back.
The closest thing Peter had to his grandparents on his Pop’s side was his wrist watch, the strap was new but the watch itself was his grandfather’s past down from his Pops to him. He never really expected his Pops to own and use a pocket watch, but Peter knew they had been poor, so this watch must have been a big deal to have at the time. He’d need to ask about it more once he was back home. Because he was going to get back home. Peter looked up to Tony, Peter must have been staring at the watch for some time, Tony had already packed his duffle bag and dropped it by the door. Only to re-enter with Peter’s, all packed and ready to go.
He flipped the page again, Tony let out a laugh but quickly covered his mouth. A quick, rough sketch of their ratty yellow couch and all of his paper work, dumped onto the couch. He chuckled again, running his fingers over the page. Tony flicked over the page again, half finished, a family photo of Steve and Sarah, Steve dressed in his Sunday best, perched on Sarah’s hips, her dress unfinished. The official photo tapped to the opposite page, next to a photo of Tony and Steve moving the couch into the apartment, well, Steve carried the couch and Tony directed from in front. Tony placed the book back down in its place. He looked towards the door and decides against leaving, pulling out Steve’s military made bed sheets and wrapping himself up in the bed. Determined in the morning to find Steve Rogers again.
Peggy took a single step back and turned. “Prepare my office. Do NOT allow young Master Stark to enter my office while Mr Stark is here.” One of the many scientists in the room scrambled for the phones on their desk to comply with the order.
"Run with it. What did they do that was so bad to you?" I lean in closer, I feel his breath on my face.
"It's okay baby?..." he trails off waiting for me to finish his sentence which he always does when he doesn't know my preferred gender.
"Well we've already been preapproved to adopt so, yeah basically. We'll just read over her file, sign a few things, get her stuff and get out of here." MJ sighs, her smile not disappearing.
"It's mad that you've lived there for so long but still haven't met her." MJ comments as we jump down the stairs.
We spent around 3 hours like that before Bucky woke up. Just singing and laughing. It was nice and warm. No strings attached. Around 1pm Bucky stumbles into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes, going straight for the fridge, pulling out the orange juice and drinking straight from the carton.
"Ty I found it." I know exactly what he's referring to. The half drank bottle of vodka sitting under my bed next to a pack of cigarettes.
The fight was gruelling. Nat let Cap and Bucky get away in a jet so we were only able to catch 4 of them, better than nothing though I guess. They've all been put on house arrest while the search for Papa continues.
"Boys, boys! We're having Chinese. We already decided this." Steve says, wrapping his arms around each boys shoulders.
"And you two must be the ones Steve talked my ear off about. Hi, I'm your uncle Bucky." Pete says hello back and I just wave shyly. Bucky smiles and hands us each a bag.
"Tyler!" He yells simply. It was enough though as the person he was looking at disappeared from out of sight. The hero looked around, confused as to where they had gone. A hand touches his shoulder and he jumps, letting a surprised Yelp escape his mouth as he turns to face his attacker. He comes face to face with a girl. Blonde hair framing her small face, her big blue eyes standing out against her pale tone, a smirk dancing across her dainty lips as she folds her arms.
Steve threw himself down on the couch next to his son. Peter almost immediately slid down, placing his head down to lay in his father’s lap. Steve ran his hand through Peter’s much longer hair, random lengths cut into it, they’d fix that once he was home, his hair was slightly blonder, maybe it was exposer in the sun from all his traveling, it left a bitter taste in Steve’s mouth, he’d hoped it was from him, that his genetics had finally shown through in his son, strands of blonde hair mixed with Tony’s appearance. Steve let a soft smile grace his face, running his hand up and down Peter’s arm a comforting gesture from when he was just a toddler. Peter shuffled his head to nuzzle into the heat.
“Romanoff, there is nothing to find. Just… leave it, he’s just a kid. There’s nothing special about him, he would have said something by now.” Steve rolled slowly over his shoulder to effectively end the conversation. Crossing his arms and preparing to take a nap. Natasha scoffed, “Alright then, when I find out, I’ll let you know.” The silence sat for a minute or so, the sound of the ambulance making its way through traffic to the head office. Steve turned ever so slightly to speak over his shoulder. “Why do you even care?”
Peter played with the computer on his wrist. flicking his wrist up towards the ceiling, the photo projected up on to the ceiling, Natasha’s eyes widen as the gallery slowly rotated through. Photos of her and Peter relaxing in the sun, a large family photo of Peter, his parents, Barton, a couple of unknown people and herself, all cuddling on a large couch. “Huh. You have a big family don’t you.”
“Well aren’t you a little trouble maker after your own dad.” Natasha hissed out through the pain. Peter took a step back, crossing his arms over his chest, frown clear on his face. “Natasha what are you doing here?” Natasha rubbed her ankle and contorted her face in pain. “I was sent to find you and bring you in, two days ago, I found your track before I could even report in, Shield raided my room, orders to bring me in, alive or dead. I don’t know whats going on Peter but it isn’t good.” Peter sighed. He knelt down next to Natasha’s ankle, “So, Cats out of the bag then?” Natasha laughed and squeezed her face in pain. “yeah, want to explain the webs and the sticking to the walls and such?”
“You made her you know?” Peter said with an ecstatic smile at Tony. Tony let out a happy breathe of air, widening his smile, watching the program run flawlessly.
Usually if they fell asleep, it was on the couch watching movies and that one-time Steve accidently broke the heating in the apartment. Steve would bundle Tony up in his arms, he’d use Tony’s lack of body heat as an ice pack for himself, but he couldn’t help but notice how… comfortable Tony got, they both slept peacefully which was rare for both of them. Before he was shipped out, before he had to tell Tony he was shipping out. He’d make excuses just to see him, even Tony noticed his behaviour, but he was a good friend and never said anything.
“Where is he?” Natasha was very …angry with Tony, “Don’t know.” Natasha, fell back into the chair, gripping the leather arm rests. “I’m guessing I’ve to go find him then.” Tony took another drink. “Why did you let the kid go?”
Peter stood by the door in a row with Jarvis and Tony, Ana was straightening up his appearance, shaping his hair and eyebrows, she had been kind enough to cut his hair down to a reasonable length last night after dinner, she sat him down on a closed lid toilet seat and went to town with the scissors, he felt more like himself again, if he had to be honest. She straightened up his checker shirt, flattening out the pocket on his chest before taken a step back to appreciate her own work. She moved on to Edwin, smiling at him, giving him a kiss on the cheek before moving on to Tony. Jarvis side eye glanced a Peter, giving a proud, ‘are you jealous of me’ smirk to Peter, who pulled a face right back at him, clear annoyance on his face.
The pair made their way down the path of the national mall, passing a few couples and students lounging in various areas across the grass, heading towards the American history museum. The pair made their way onto the grass to cut across the gravel path, keeping their noise to the minimum, Clint cut sharp to the right and made his way to the side of the building. Checking the alley way left and right he fired his arrow up onto the roof. After it anchored in, Clint began to repeal up the side of the building.
He looked up to Tony, who was admiring the view from Peggy’s office. “Must I remind you Captain that this meeting has Level 10 clearance and also not to keep Director Stark waiting.” Steve face turned to stone, “Sorry Ma’am.” He turned and walked down the hallway, waiting on the elevator.
“Captain and Birdbrain. Landed at 11AM, ahead of Shield transport I made my way to Stark grounds.” Steve raised his head quickly to look at Clint’s letter. “I paid my respects.
The small family were sat around the kitchen table, laughing at Tony’s stories of Dum_EE, Tony and Peter had spent the afternoon, helping set up and prepare dinner with Ana, as Jarvis set up the desserts, it was late, but it was nice, shame it had to end.
Peter was getting frustrated, he’d barely seen Tony the past couple of weeks, throwing himself into his final thesis paper. A lack of communication from Steve and the two spies had left Tony in a sour mood, Tony thought Peter didn’t know, but with the super hearing from the serum Tony would call out through the paging device that he and Steve shared but his calls were left unanswered. It was giving Tony a cold shoulder. Thor reached out as if he was going to touch Peter but stopped when he realised, he couldn’t. He sighed, “Young Peter, I am truly sorry for what has happened to you. Where is young Tony? Is he not usually with you?”
His breathing was picking up in a panic. He’d lost his best friend because of the assassin, that he failed to catch. He was responsible for his own loss. He’d never see the look on Tony’s face when he would finally pluck up the courage to ask his fella out. Now knowing that it would have worked out, they’d be happy enough to get married and have a family. Did he retire from Shield? He and Tony could easily retired tomorrow if they had wanted to. Steve with his back pay from his time in the ice and Tony because he… he had been a Stark, enough money to have retired the day he was born.
Steve and Peter took one look at each other and ran out the door after Tony before he accidently ran into his father. Peter forced himself to fall behind a bit as to not tip off Steve that he could keep up with the serum speed. Peter even decided to throw in a couple of deep coughs and gulps for air. He was barely even winded, Peter was used to him and his Pops going on evening and sometimes morning runs to burn energy and just talk about anything that was on his mind; school, friends or even homework.
“Barton, keep your newest recruit with you, she can help with surveillance and defence. If she tries anything out of line, bring her in.” The screen went black. Barton turned to look over the back of the centre console. “You ready for your first taste of espionage on the American side?” Romanoff leaned forward and smirked. “Ready for the challenge, bird brain.”
Peter couldn’t contain himself, he’d almost paced a hole in front of the double bed his parents were currently lounging on, “And then! You and I had just met
The black digital clock bounce on top of the table, bumping into the sketchbook, Tony kicked his foot out to slam it on top of the alarm, silencing it. reaching round he pulled the sketch book on to his chest, re-organising his hands he held the sketch book above his head. Picking up where he left off, Tony flicked to the next page, a hastily sketched portrait of a man, the only clue give as to who he was, was the ‘Barnes.” patch on his front shirt. Likely a buddy from the war. A time long forgotten by many but not for the man who only left it behind a couple of years ago. Flipping the page over, Tony was gently hit on the face by a wrapped, specifically, the local vendor that stood outside their apartment every day, Tony pulled the white paper wrapper off his face, inspecting it again, the slightly smudge doodle of himself, his hair flopped over his eyes, taking a oversized bite of the the fully load hotdog, grinning ear to ear the corners of his mouth cover in mustard and relish.
Shoving them down into the wicker washing baskets, Tony shook the dust off the red throw and folded it across the bottom of the mattress. Tony picked up his headphones from the floor, sitting them on top of the textbook pile, he turned his attention towards the trainers. He kicked them gently across the floor until the toppled over the edge of the wardrobe so he could shut it with a soft click.
"And because of that they've been avoiding you like the plague huh? Treating you like it's your fault?" He asks, his fingers playing with the ends of my hair.
"Pepper, words cannot describe how I feel about you. I want to start my speech by saying that I love you. I love you more than words can explain. I love you more than I love building things in my lab. I love everything about you. I love the way you smile, the way you laugh. The way that you dance with my daughter when your baking and the way that you help my son with his homework. I love you when you get mad that I spend all my time in my lab and I love you when you don't. You're the glue that keeps this family together and I know that we'd fall apart without you. I don't know what I would do if you weren't part of my life. My kids call you 'Mom' we love you. We're a family. I wouldn't change any of that for the world. I promise I'll try and come up with a stable sleeping pattern and I'll make sure that you're all protected. I've got to protect what I can't loose and that's you guys. I promise, I'll do everything in my power to protect you. I love you." I wipe my eyes once dad finishes, cupping a hand around my mouth before yelling.
"I'll call them later and get back to you." She turns to leave. "Bye Tyler. And for god's sake, be good." She closes the door behind her. Mom smiles at me, placing the girl on the floor who instantly latches onto my legs, looking up at me with a cheeky smile. I crouch down so I'm at her eye level.
"Come on Ty, open it." I pull on the bow hesitantly, opening it slowly. There's a ring sat upon a black velvet cushion. It's a simple silver band with a small heart on top.
"Sure you didn't birdbrain." I shoot back with an eye roll. He grasps at his chest like he's been shot.
Everyone's been away on missions more and more recently. And Dad and Papa are always fighting over the accords. Divorce is hanging in the air.
"It's okay Buck. I know what it feels like to not be in control of your own mind. But really I'm fine. You didn't even hurt me that much." He sighs in relief before enveloping me in a tight hug, whispering thank you over and over again. I pull away standing up.
"As for eating, we want you to eat at least 2 meals a day and a snack, 3 if you can. As soon as you can eat 3 meals a day for a week solid, we'll introduce Shadow Knight to the streets again." I grimace but agree to Tony's rules none the less. I want to be Shadow again.
"Okay," Pete starts, pausing whilst he thinks of a question. "Never have I ever kissed a girl and liked it." Me, MJ and Pete take a drink. It was MJ's turn now.
"My mum brought me a tiger like that when I was little but my first foster home ripped it up in a drunken rage. Tigers are my favourite animal you know?" I smile sadly and Tony wraps his arms around me.
I start strumming along to the chords and can't help but start to sing. The song holds so many memories.
"Morgs, can you go save Dad?" Mom asks her once she'd finished her final nugget. She nods, jumping out of her chair, trying to reach the sink so she can wash her greasy hands but falling a few inches too short. I snigger at her before walking behind her and lifting her up high enough so she can reach the water. Once I set her down, she gives me a toothy grin and grabs my hand in her tiny one, pulling me wordlessly outside.
"Did they make you do this?" I nod slowly. He begins cursing under his breath as he stands up, placing me gently on my feet, grabbing my hand in an iron grasp, leaving no room for argument.
"Honey? We're home." A deep voice cuts through the semi peaceful house, followed by the pounding of tiny school shoes hitting the wooden floors.
"He's not so bad." Wade raises his eyebrow. "He's, got a temper. But, deep down, he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anyone I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, who spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows that he'll win."
"Bucky. You're hurting me. Get off." As if something snapped, he instantly released his grip, setting me gently on the ground. He moves as if he's seen a ghost, his hands covering his mouth. I'm not phased. I move closer to him, wrapping him up in a hug when I get close enough. He mumbles his apologies into my hair but I brush them off.
"Don't touch my brother again." With that I walk back over to my friends who look shocked. I smile at my brother.
"Define lunch or be incinerated." She threatens, struggling slightly with the big word and unable to see due to the helmet on her head.
"Yes." I throw my arms around the girl and slide the ring I brought onto her finger, pulling her in for a passionate kiss.
"Tyler," He begins, throwing the rules at me. "Right now you're breaking rules 6, 7, 18 and 20. We just want to help kiddo. Please let us." I look up at them. They both look at me, hope evident in their eyes. I shrug my shoulders. Steve gets out of his chair and I feel him sit in the one next to me. He takes my petite hand into his bigger one and holds it tightly.
"That's me kid." I nod my head, deep in thought. I snap my eyes up to meet his. He seems a little intimidated so I soften my steel orbs slightly, offering him a smile.
"Dad!!!!!" I groan as he pulls me and Wade apart. Papa appears by Dad's side, his arm wrapped around his waist. Wade does the same to me and I snuggle into his side. Papa clears his throat.
"Mama! Mama! Look! Look!" Both girls were trying to get their mom's attention while Sean goes over to Brooke. He looks up and notices me.
"Night Momma." I yell back from my position on the couch waiting for my dad to join me. It doesn't take him long to. He passes me a bottle of water and sits down opposite myself, staring intently.
"Me and Tony are just doing our best to make sure we can keep our daughter." Clint laughs at his response.
"Holy Shit." I say as I take in what's in front of me. It's completely full. From jeans to jackets and shirts to boots. Everything I could ever want is in here. I step inside and set out on looking for work out gear. I spot a collection of sports bras and pick out one that says bitch please on the front. Pairing it with some brand-new leggings and a pair of Adidas trainers. I retie  up my hair, grab my headphones and leave my room.
I slam my elbows onto the keys and put my face in my hands, allowing the silent tears to cascade down my face. Is it my fault? I hear sniffling behind me so I whip my head around to find the avengers, minus my dad's and Peter, crowding round the door. I hastily wipe away my tears.
I sit in my biology lesson, watching the seconds tick down. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. RING!!!!!! There's a rush as students scramble to grab their bags and rush out of the door. I'm one of them. MJ waits for me at the door of the classroom as we begin to walk to our lockers. Peter, Wade and Ned are already there, ready to leave. I open my locker and pull out my homework and books that I'll need, slamming it shut before turning to my friends.
"I don't mind really kiddo. You want to wear boys clothes and be called a boy, I don't mind. You want to wear dresses all the time and be called a princess, I don't mind that either. All I, hell all any of us, want is for you to be happy. I don't mind what you are or where you fall as long as you're not hurting yourself okay?" Tears well in my eyes as I hug the woman in front of me, the feeling of acceptance is overwhelming. She pulls away and wipes my cheeks with her thumbs.
"God Tyler, I need these." We start play fighting as the mechanical doors ding open, revealing a very tired and relived redhead. Her green eyes land on us and her arms stretch out. I waste no time jumping off Pete and running into her awaiting arms. She looked like she needed a hug okay?
"None of this is your fault Tiger. None of it okay? You don't deserve this." He stands with me in his arms. "Let's get you cleaned up them there's some people who really want to meet you." I sniff again and he wipes my tears causing me to smile. He takes my hand in his and pulls me into the EnSite bathroom, gesturing for me to hop onto the counter whilst he searched for a first aid kit. I do as he says, my cries subsiding into small hiccups. He pulls out an antiseptic wipe and presses it to my arm gently. A hiss escapes as a stinging sensation makes its way up my arm. Tony works quickly. Not making a sound as he wraps the bandage around my arm, securing it with tape, placing a small kiss over the top. I sniffle once again and he takes me into his arms.
"That my little spider is a surprise." She says, annoying the now 17 year old even more than he already was.
"Done." Wanda announces as she straightens up. "Nat, you start on her hair, I'll carry on with the outfit search." I sigh as I think about my hair. It's grown out again and with the three different internships I've got going on (Pepper, Tony and now Natasha) along with school, assignments and homework, I've not got around to cutting it again. Maybe..
I get back to the floor we live on and find Steve passed out on the couch. Looks like he tried to wait up for me. I have an inner battle for a few moments before deciding to wake him up and get him into bed as the position he was in did not look comfortable. I shake his shoulder lightly and he bolts up, his hands out in front of him ready to attack which makes me jump back in fear. His eyes soften when he realises it's me and he drops his fists.
reaches. I will not ask again.” Steve out stretched his arm over the edge of the eighth floor glass barriers to the wide open atrium. “Where is Peter.” Steve was surrounded by Shield guards, weapons aimed at his head. His back was vulnerable, the shield attached to his outstretched arm. Peggy pushed through the guard’s semi-circle of aim and cried out, “Steve, please stop!”
Director Carter was getting agitated, Steve could see she was near an outburst, why was this kid so important to this portal? They aren’t actually going to force the kid near that thing? Are they?! “Peter, I need you to understand…” Director Carter was interrupted by Tony again. “No. He doesn’t get hurt, end of.”
“I have an old man who should have probably retired 2 years ago and gone to spend the rest of his life sitting in the sun, who I consider my family. Before you came here, all I hoped was that I would have enough friends who actually liked me enough to have thanksgiving or Christmas with.” Tony’s face broke into a big smile, “Then you’re here, I’m presumably happily married, we have a BIG family or people we consider family and I have a son, who is exactly like me but genuinely happy with me as their father.”
“Thank you, delta seven leader, mission filed a success, bring the Captain and Hawkeye to the facility upstate.” Peggy aimlessly stepped around herself, moving without a care between her feet in a small circle. “What evidence did you find?” She looked out the window of her upstate office, appreciating the view of the vast forest landscape. “So, he has been made aware…” She sighed, turning once again to look down at the file on her desk, “Do it. The board of Directors will agree to this, wipe their memory of the event, call it a Hydra ambush. Burn the Letter and any evidence of Peter Stark.”
“I told him to leave.” She sat up straight, crossing her legs and gripping each end of the chair. “He knew it was going to happen. Peter, he just sat by and told me I should say goodbye, I didn’t realise why until Peggy told me and he just… he just sat there, he couldn’t even look at me.” He drank again. Natasha gripped the chair a little tighter. “Do you blame him?” Tony rolled his shoulders, he hadn’t made up his mind yet, On the one hand, he didn’t truly believe Peter knew the entire time he was here that his parents were going to die. Part of Tony’s thinking process was that he just couldn’t talk about his parent’s deaths at least 20 years on. He’d gotten married, had a kid and still couldn’t talk about that day. On the other hand, had he just sent his son to 1991, he maybe never knew this was going to happen. But Peter made the decision to not tell him. It still hurt.
Peter shoved Natasha out of the way. The group turned to look down the street. Peter’s heart stopped, he held breath, he couldn’t quite catch it again, he stumbled backwards, it was him, the Winter Soldier. He’s here. He’s going to kill him, his Pops, his family.
She smirked to herself. Enjoying the peaceful moment, that were few and far between these days. She’d gotten word from Clint that they were inbound, Peter, desperate not to waste time, demanded they be packed to immediate turn around and start making headway to get home. Steve didn’t necessarily agree but Natasha could see that even Papa Steve Stark was getting restless. Peter bounded out the door, energy radiating off of him in every little jump down the stairs, he sat himself down on the second to last step. Ready to go, now he just needed to waist for the ride.
Tony double tapped his finger near the end of his cigar, the ash glided down into the clear crystal ash tray, taking another swig of his whisky, rolling the ice cubes around in the glass. He let out an angry gruff as he inspected his blue-prints once again. Gripping the stalk of his desk lamp he pulled it closer to the design. Flipping the pencil between his fingers, he erased and re-drew a wiring component. A knock at the door drew his attention from his work. He raised his eyes briefly before returning to the design, “Come in.” Ana pushed open the door and stepped inside the room, using her back to hold it open for Jarvis. Jarvis carried through a tray with toast, eggs, bacon and a glass of orange juice. Ana coughed at the stench of the cigar. “Édesem, please eat some breakfast this morning. You look very tired…” Jarvis set the tray on the side of the hand-crafted wooden desk, careful not to lay the tray on top of some of Tony’s work.
Steve found himself sitting on the floor in his mother’s flat, the day after he had finally held her funeral. Finding himself lost, not sure what to do with his life, he now had bills to pay by himself and his art wasn’t going to cover it anymore. Bucky had found him, dressed up in his Sunday best surrounded by newspaper job listings, all circled in red for various labour intensive jobs, the failed interviews crossed out. Bucky shook his head, inspecting the papers, he nudged Steve awake with his foot. Helping him up off the floor he took his friend through to his room, putting him to bed. Steve woke to his mother’s hand knitted blanket over his body and two papers circled with newspaper’s graphic artist and enlistment for the army.
"Tyler, we're taking you to counselling. We think it could help." I say nothing as I nod my head. I want to get better, don't I?
"Peter Stark-Rogers, Level 10. Welcome back Peter, I shall Inform both bosses about yours and Tyler's arrival."
"It's only been mentioned once or twice but I think I've got the idea." I shoot back Sarcastically causing another sigh to fall from his lips.
"Hey guys." I say wrapping my arms around my two best friends. Me, Pete and MJ go to school together. We've been close since we started Midtown Tech.
"You're good, kid." He says, handing it back. I smile and mumble my thanks before silence consumes us.
"Hey Ty, ready to go?" I nod at the 22 year old, pulling him in for a hug and landing a kiss on his cheek.
"I am well and truly saved." I smile at the adorable scene in front of me before turning my attention back to the adults.
"Hey. You ready to go." She pulls away and I nod, running into the kitchen, picking up my bag and Lily. Steve and Tony are talking to Nat so I go and hug Pete first.
"This wont do. It's so last season and it really doesn't go with that outfit." I just sit there dumbfounded.
"Thanks Jarv." He continues to drive down a clearing with grass either side, a small lake and a boarder of trees and.
"Your name is Peter and you're a boy." It was like his mantra for when his dysphoria got too much to bare. I crouch down next to him, running my hand through his hair.
"Would you guys stop arguing? I'm trying to sleep here." I mumble, my face buried in the pillow. One of the voices scoffs.
"How've you been Tyler?" Natasha's voice cuts through the almost awkward silence of the elevator. I shrug.
"Good." With that, she pushes the door open and I gasp. It looks like the room was made for me. Light grey and turquoise walls, a king-sized bed in the centre, a wardrobe up against the far corner, a small but spacious desk along the back wall, underneath a half wall window, a corkboard on the wall for me to stick pictures and stuff on. I look at Natasha.
"Sure." I reply. Pepper smiles at me and clears away the plates coming back with a massive bowl of strawberries, cherries, blueberries and more along with a cup of sugar to dip them in. I pile up a small plate full of the fruits. I see dad looking at me in approval as I eat what's on my plate, even going in for seconds.
"Okay so tell me if there's anything you guys want to add or want to be modified slightly." We nod in understanding and he produces a list of neatly written lines. Peter skins over it and looks horrified and passes it to me when he finished. I couldn't believe my eyes.
"I'm 17. Almost finished high school. And one year away from taking over as the CEO of Stark industries."
The party ends and people start filing out, the only people left are my parents, Pete, MJ, Clint and Natasha. I hug my Mom one last time.
"Flash, did you forget what happened in the lab already? Did that bit of the day wriggle out of your tiny little brain? I'd gladly put it back in, rebreak your nose. Especially now I have back up."
"Daddy." I pull away from Nat and straight into my dad's arms. He picks me up with ease which puts him off slightly.
"What did you just call my kids?" Tony asks, his voice dangerously low. It was in that moment that Flash decided to turn around to see Natasha spinning a knife in her fingers, Clint with his bow and arrow, Steve trying so hard to persuade Tony not to call the suit, Vision taking Bruce out of the room to avoid a code green, red floating at Wanda's finger tips, Bucky Loading his riffle and Sam summoning Redwing. Flash gulps.
"It didn't have your birthday on your file, we just assumed it was an unspeakable day." I laugh at my Papa's reasoning.
I wake again a few hours later. Groggily rubbing my eyes as I mumble about how mornings are a curse from Satan.
"Welcome back Miss Tyler, Master Peter and Miss MJ. Shall I alert Boss of your arrival." Jarvis asks as he opens the gates allowing us to drive through.
"As for training," Steve begins making me turn my head at an awkward angle to see him. "You are more than welcome to come on my morning run with me, it seems like you have some good stamina and it would be nice to run with someone who can keep up for a change." He glances at Tony who throws his arms up in the air in defeat.
"Sorry Mom." We mumble, picking up our drinks and sipping at the sweet beverage. Can't wait to get home.
"You speak Russian?" I nod my head. "That's awesome. Now, why don't you come sit? I want to get to know you." I do as she says and sit in the vacant seat next to her. We talk about anything and everything and by the time she had to leave, I felt like I'd known her my whole life. I rose from my seat to wave the two adults off. As we approached the door Bruce gave me a curt nod and stepped over the frame and Natasha drew me in for a hug.
"They will never, ever hurt you again прекрасный. We'll make sure of it." Clint nods at his wife's words as I curl up in her lap.
"You dickhead." I wring the jacket out over the tub saying silent praise that my Manchester United shirt wasn't wet.
"Peasant, I have arrived." I joke as I step over the threshold. He rolls his eyes under the heavy frame of his glasses.
"I know you all hate me but. He holds a bag up. "I went to get some things. I'm so sorry for storming out. I support the pair of you wholeheartedly. It was just a shock. I know I screwed up. I'm sorry." I just stare at him for a while before looking at Pete, we nod and jump out of our chairs, attacking Steve in a hug which he returns.
"Sorry Underoo's but no phones at the table. Same goes for you Ty." I hold my hands up in defence. Steve walks over and puts down a plate with a stack of pancakes on it and a different stack of plates, which I'm presuming are for us to use. They both pull up chairs opposite us and hand us each a plate. Everyone grabs a pancake or in Pete and Tony's case, several pancakes. I put one on my plate and begin cutting it up so it looks smaller, like I have less to eat. Tony seems to notice and glances at me. I catch his gaze and look down, picking up a piece of my fork and shoving it into my mouth, forcing myself to chew it and swallow. I continue this until the whole thing is gone. I stand and take my plate to the sink, rinsing it off and placing it in the dish washer. I sit back at the table and wait for the others to finish. When they finally did, Steve said we needed to talk. So me and Tony make another cup of coffee each and fight to stay awake as Steve gives the whole this is your house now speech. Once the torture is over, he tells us to stay put as he goes to get something. I look at Tony who just shrugs and at Pete who was still pouting over his phone. I jab him I the ribs and he glares at me. I stick my tongue out at him just as Steve walks back in.
"Hey kid." Peter's voice breaks the young woman out of her trance. "We did it." Tyler looks over the city, a small smile tugging on the corners of her mouth.
"Hey guys, I was wondering what you were- Fucking Hell Tyler. It's a tip in here!" I didn't even look up.
"Go get dressed. We'll leave in 10." I cockily salute her and all but run to the room I was occupying for the day. Opening my bag I sigh at the clothes I had, an AC/DC shirt and a ripped pair of leggings, both from my days at the orphanage. I change none the less and throw my MIT hoodie over the top, shoving my feet into my converse. I'm busy running my fingers through my unkempt hair when Natasha peeks her head around the edge of my door.
"Who hurt you?" Her voice was laced with venom. I open my mouth to speak but I couldn't. The words weren't coming out so I did the only thing I could. I raised my shirt, exposing my right side where the words "PROPERTY OF HYDRA." Were carved. Her hand flies to her mouth and she pulls me tighter into her arms, whispering how sorry she is that any of this happened. I reassured her that I was fine and even though I could tell she didn't believe me, she didn't push the subject any further, just instructing me to get some rest which I plan on doing anyway.
"Steve's here." Peter says as we all just watch the youngest Stark eat her chicken nuggets, not knowing the history or depth of the situation that's going on around her.
"Listen to me Tyler. They are not going to kick you out okay? And if either of them say something negative about it, you and Pete are coming with me for the foreseeable future okay?" I nod at what she says, feeling slightly more confident to know that even if they don't support me I've always got Natasha and Clint to rely on.
"Oh I don't know. We're odd socks." I joke. "Can I go take a look outside, I didn't really see much of it driving passed."
"Hoping to be. Depends if dad needs me in the lab or not." I'm interrupted by my brother tapping repeatedly on my shoulder.
Once I'm satisfied with how I look, I leave my room to try and find anyone else. I didn't get very far before I got bored.
The ride to Stark Towers seemed to take a life time and a half. But before long, we were pulling into the private garage of the Stark-Rodgers. With claims to collect our bags later, we set off to the entrance of the tower, stepping into the elevator. I look around in complete and utter awe. I've never been in a place this big. I can see Tony and Steve staring at me and my brother, small smiles tugging at the corner of their lips. We ride up to the 34th floor. As the mechanical doors open, I gasp in amazement. Tony smirks at me.
"It's fine. You're here now." We stay like this for a few minutes, swaying slightly to the imaginary music playing. I sigh pulling away from him.
"What are you all doing?" He asks them, groaning in frustration when he doesn't receive an answer. I cower further into Natasha's side as Clint gets angrier by the second. Steve eventually speaks up.
"We'll only be a few floors apart if you need my Ty, you've got your phone so you can call any of us. Nat won't let them hurt you. I promise." I nod my head against his shoulder. This is the first time in more or less 10 years we're spending the night apart, even if it is by a couple of floors.
"No, I'm not mad Ty. Just upset that you didn't ask me to do it. I did hair and make up at college. I know what I'm doing. Now shush and let me work." I comply with his request as he begins snipping away at my hair. I feel my head become lighter and he places the scissors down next to me. I'm too scared to look at my reflection. I hear the buzz of a shaver before it gets placed against the side of my head lightly.
"I can't lose you прекрасный. I've lost too much already. None of us could bare the pain of losing you. Please try."
"Oh kid. I know it's not been easy recently but that's going to change okay. Papa's just being an idiot. I promise I'm going to help you okay."
"Pete, this is when you stop talking." I say patronizingly to my older brother. Tony cleared his throat.
I sit for awhile, staring into the water in the pond, wandering what it would be like if Papa was with us now. Probably boring. Mom's way better than he ever was. But do I miss him? Do I still love him like dad says I do? I think it's impossible to stop loving someone completely. Me and Wade broke up a year ago and yet sometimes, late at night I have to force myself not to dial that all too familiar number, just to hear his voice. I do the same thing with Aunt Nat as well. I really miss her. But she turned on us that day. I might ask dad if I can visit her soon.
"I'm not hungry." I'm lying. "I ate at the orphanage before you came." I haven't eaten in 3 days. Please see through my lies. Peter scoffs as he finishes his third slice.
"If you must know, your 'best friend' was having a nightmare and woke me up, and I know what it's like going through them alone, so I went to calm him down, I managed to, I sang to him and we both fell asleep. It's called being a decent human being Steven!" Silence came over both of us and before I could really process it, Steve was pulling me into his arms, gathering me into a massive hug which I was quick to return. Tears well up in my eyes as I rest my head on his shoulder.
"It's just hard not to do something when I know what it feels like. I had to help him because once upon a time there was no one there to help me." Steve shushes me softly as he rocks back and forth, playing with the ends of my hair.
"Don't use that tone with me young lady. Why were you in Bucky's room last night." I spin on my heel to face the blond, my eyes hardened.
"Yeah. I'm sure I can find you something that you won't deem as lame." We all head towards the kitchen, dragging our feet the whole way there as Papa and Dad stand there with shit-eating grins on their faces.
"Come on. We've got movies and ice cream and chocolate and sweets. I got some house friendly arrows so we can have a go inside. We can do whatever you want." Nat chuckles at her husband's enthusiasm.
"Yeah. Why wouldn't I be. You're getting married. That must be pretty exciting." She chuckles at my enthusiasm.
"Umm I love art and science, chemistry and physics mainly. Also music. Lexie likes it when I read to her so I spend most of my days doing that. I like sports and umm, I can't think of anything else." I smile at her. I glance up at MJ to see her looking at the pair of girls with adoring eyes. I wonder if this is what it felt like when dad adopted us?
"Lot of dedication, love, alcohol and sex." I joke nudging MJ's arm. Everyone laughs. "But seriously, wouldn't have been able to do it with this woman which leads me onto my next point." I shift my position so I'm on one knee in front of my girlfriend.
"Hey! Where's my hug?" Pete asks as he walks over to me. I roll my eyes but embrace the older boy anyway.
"I'll be right back." He returns with the Iron man gauntlet on. Soon enough Rhodey is trying as well.
"This is Melody." I look up at Steve to see him stare at my baby. "Uncle Ben got it for me on my 7th birthday. Just before he." My voice trails off as I think about the man who me and Pete both considered a father. All the times he took us to the park and brought us ice cream as long as we promised not to tell aunt May. All the times he comforted us after a nightmare. All the times he was there when nobody else was. I wipe the tears away and look back up at my dad.
"The Stark-Rogers family. The judge is ready for you." Everyone get to their feet. Dad and Papa holding both of my hands in one of theirs each. Everyone who came with us wished us luck before leaving to take their seats in the stands. I have a death grip on both of my dad's hands as the doors were pushed open inviting us through. The three of us take a seat on the raised platform in front of the judge.
"If you don't mind me asking, what's your dead name?" Natasha asks, completely not phased that Tyler isn't my birth name.
Later that night, I was sat in my new room, on my new bed reading an old book. My copy of Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde was still intact though barely so. Tony had offered to by me a new one countless times before but I'd always denied. It was Uncle Ben's book that I 'borrowed'. Don't judge me, I was grieving. A small knock on my door makes me loose concentration on my book.
"Yikes!" I yell, covering my eyes like a 3-year-old. They jump apart, crimson spreading across their cheeks.
"I umm." I try to explain but it's hard. I put my head in my hands and start mumbling to myself. Steve starts rubbing my back.
"Oh she can? That's great. Yeah she'll be there on time. I'll make sure of it. Tell them I said thank you. Bye." She ends the call and turns back to us.
"Hey прекрасный." She smiles so I smile back. I walk through the door with Peter making a beeline for the table where the other three are sat.
"You weigh nothing прекрасный." I don't say anything as she places me down, grabbing my Hawkeye pyjamas out of my bag, passing them to me. I cautiously pull my hoodie off and put the shirt on. Natasha gasps.
"Should you even be drinking? I'm pretty sure you're like, 19." Bucky says, slurring on his words slightly. Who knew he could get drunk?
"Umm. I have something I need to tell you." I say over everyone else's talk. Pete looks at me encouragingly and MJ gives me a thumbs up. I grab Wade's hand tightly under the table.
"We just did. Now, Tones," He picks up the phone and throws it at his partner who catches it with ease. "You call the place and kids, you go and get changed." All three of us salute him as we set about the tasks that were given to us. I walk up to my room with Steve on my trail. When I finally reach my destination, I turn to look at the man, questioning why he was here.
"Sure." I pick Brooklyn out of her chair as she was already making grabby hands for me and allow the girls to pull me into the living room. I sit on the white leather sofa with the toddler on my lap. Cameron looks at me. She's a spitting image of her dad. Dark hair, bright blue eyes and cute nose whereas Emory seems to be a mix of the two, like me, with moms blonde hair but striking blue eyes like her father, moms noes but her dads smile.
"No nothing like that. Orphanage never asked. And I've got to say, you guys adopting us was the best birthday present in the world." Tony wraps his arms around me.
"Hey kiddo. You ready?" I nod my head frantically. Today is the day my therapist decides if I need any further steps taken, such as medication or a different type of therapy. Personally, I don't think I need therapy anymore but everyone else thinks differently.
5 minutes went too quick for my liking. Soon enough I'm sat back in that seat, holding my dad's hands in a bruising grip, eyes screwed shut, praying to heaven and hell that it will weigh to our side.
