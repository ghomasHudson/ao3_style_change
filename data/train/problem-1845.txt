Sherlock's the first to push the door to the living room open naturally, so Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson stumble into him when he stops abruptly.
The day's been a total disaster just like John knew it would be.
John gets the picture and he spreds the man's cheeks and then he's fucking Sherlock with his tongue. Three, four, five times and then the man stills for a couple of seconds and then shudders.
"I think that's quit enough, don't you think?". John smiles thinly at Victor and flicks his eyes Sherlock who's cupping his bloody nose, watching John with indecipherable eyes.
Speaking of direction, John's turned and turned the music off on his laptop, as well as the floating speakers. The DI's heard John complain about them before, apparently Sherlock's brought them in for an experiment. Looks like they're good for something.
Mycroft's face is priceless, almost gaping. John's never before seen his control slip so spectacularly. Sherlock seems awed, face undescribable to John, though he thinks he can detect the slightest flickering of pride and dark satisfaction in his eyes..
," Sherlock spits out, "to you idiots. I told you, I'm on a -"
John shudders at the feeling of those lean, strong thighs surrounding his own, squeezing him closer towards the promising bulge in the detective's posh trousers.
Gerrick faltersa bit under everyoe's attention but he hasn't caught on and gives a little laugh, ignoring Lisa's touch on his arm and wary look.
The doctor tilts his head, lips slowly twitching into a smile promising danger.
1 & 3 Prop
Sherlock blinks and seems startled at  this, as if he can't imagine why in the world someone would smile at him. John's protective instincts rise again and his right hand tightens against the wheel to stop him from flying out the car to hug the young man.
"You've had this done before, did you say?"
"Um, could you maybe, uhh, pull your trousers down a bit?" John said awkwardly. Sherlock blushed and undid the button and the fly. John took the massive needle from Sherlock and pushed it in. Sherlock winced slightly but otherwise didn't say anything.
"I sustained five broken ribs, internal abdominal bleeding, and I broke six bones in my legs. I was dead for six minutes, but then I was resuscitated. I'm here, John, see?" Sherlock guided John's hand up to rest on his chest so he could feel his heart beating. "It takes more than a fall to kill me, John."
"I know this woman don't I?" John asked.
"I don't know. You probably wont be running around after criminals, your joints won't be up to it. I thought you said you wanted to retire to Sussex to keep bees?"
Sure enough he found his boxers and his pyjama trousers stained with dark red blood. Sherlock was expecting to start menstruating in about another month or so, so unfortunately hadn't purchased and pads or tampons. He thought about his options, which consisted of John, Mary, or Mrs. Hudson. His watch read 3:15 am, so he couldn't exactly ask Mrs. H to buy him tampons without a reason, and now was not the time to come out to his eighty year old landlady. Mary would most likely know more about which brands to buy than John, so Mary it is.
The couple sat down on the sofa and Sherlock sat opposite on his armchair, exactly where they had all been sitting three days ago. They looked at each other awkwardly in anticipation of how the night would proceed. Mary broke the uncomfortable silence by asking Sherlock, "Have you changed your mind about being a surrogate or an egg donor?"
"Honestly, all of this gamete collection business is a lot more pleasurable for all you cisgender males." Sherlock joked. It earned him a smile from John and a twitching upper lip from the other doctor.
"Me, a prude? Seriously? I can't drink alcohol at the moment. That's all. You enjoy your posh wine, I enjoy my children's menu apple juice."
"My friends are John's friends, and my family are fine with whatever I do as long as it doesn't involve too much cocaine or morphine or jumping off buildings."
"Well, first with the pills, then the injections, and now you saying you just had an operation! You once came down to a crime scene with a temperature of 39 degrees and a broken arm! It sounds like you're seriously ill!"
"You could be pregnant by dinner time."
"I went up to the Yard this morning to collect the file on your daughter's case. I haven't looked at it yet, because I want to talk to you first."
The other end of the line was quiet for a moment. "Okay, that's fine. Do you mean now?"
"I have something very important to tell you. It's not bad news, I promise. In fact it's the very best."
Throughout Sherlock's little speech Mary hadn't left her place on the sofa. John's anger had vanished away faster than a breath on the wind, and what was left looked like a mix of curiosity and disbelief. He allowed himself to be guided back towards the sofa by the detective, and once Sherlock himself had sat down he turned to Mary.
"Yes! Just a minute!" Sherlock yelled an answer. He stood up too quickly though, and he knocked the syringe onto the floor and it rolled out from under the stool. "Shit!" he hissed.
"I will." Sherlock replied sincerely.
"Will do. Bye, Sherlock. Hope you feel better soon." the line clicked off. Sherlock went into the kitchen to get some ibuprofen, a hot water bottle, and a cup of tea. He then lay down on the sofa, and went into his mind palace for the next six hours.
"If everything goes according to plan then I will tell you on the 13th of August, and not a day earlier."
He knocked very quickly on the door until Ben Grayson answered. "What the hell is your proble- oh, hello Mr. Holmes, do come in."
"Yes, I am. And you must be John Watson, pleasure to meet you." She stuck out her hand for John to shake.
Sherlock clicked his mouse over send. "It's sent. If what I know about how much the media wants an interview with me is correct then I wouldn't be surprised if I get a reply by the end of the day."
When he got home he called the chinese takeaway down the road and asked them to deliver their food at quarter past seven this evening. Then he cleaned and polished his Violin, and preceded to play. Sherlock zoned out whilst he was playing, and before he knew it the time was seven o'clock and the doorbell was ringing.
"Turn to the side, I want to see." John instructed. Sherlock turned himself so he was perpendicular to his friend. John let out a little gasp.
After listening to all of what John had to say, Sherlock was somewhat surprised to hear just how dire Mary's fertility situation was. In theory they could treat her, but it could take a while and pregnancy at her age came with a higher risk of a miscarriage.
"They're dead. Mycroft shot them all after I was safe. It was the most emotional I've ever seen him since he was a child."
Mary and John looked to Sherlock. "This is going to have a bigger impact on you than me and Mary. Are you sure you want to do this? And next week?"
"This is the hardest thing I've ever done." and it was. He already felt himself starting to bond with the child inside of him, and that bond would only get stronger. He thought he could keep his feelings separate, his body was just transport after all.
"All done. Now I've got to go now, but John can do the next bit for you. If you don't feel up to your appointment tomorrow I'll come round here after my shift. Go to the hospital if you throw up what the feeding tube gives you. Bye Sherlock, I hope you start feeling better soon."
"Laters!" Sherlock walked out of the door with the file tucked under his arm.
"Umm, it's okay Sherlock. How about you go down to the yard tomorrow and solve it? I'm sure Lestrade can pull some strings."
It wouldn't matter though, because he or she isn't his child. They're Mary and John's, who would make better parents than he would ever be. And Sherlock would just have to except that.
"Yes, we are. And it's surrogate father, not surrogate mother." Mary spoke up. Sherlock shot her a grateful look.
"Wilton Crescent."
"I have the necessary components of a female reproductive system to carry a child. When John and Mary said they were looking for a surrogate and egg donor, I volunteered. We talked about it, and a week later they had made their decision, and I had made mine.
"Ahh, I see. Don't worry Sherlock, it won't make a difference in the long run." Sherlock took all three of them at the same time.
John stopped preparing the equipment. "I wasn't expecting that."
"Definitely Doctor Who. I believe that John and I both have had too many hours at the clinic today, I can't bare to see another patient. Even if they're on the telly." Mary replied.
He walked up to the bed where Sherlock was now standing up, and hugged him. They had only hugged a few times in their friendship, and this was one of the best.
"Are you saying that you would just be a surrogate or are you willing to donate your eggs too?" Mary said.
Please take the time to kudos and comment, those of you who have posted their own work before will know how much it means!
"How?" Sherlock asked.
"What are you thinking about?" John asked Sherlock.
-Irena. N
"Okay." John put down his croissant. "Which media company?"
"Where is she?!" Emily demanded.
Sherlock thought that it was better to be safe than sorry, so he called John.
"Lestrade, I want you to find Jasmine Whitley's family. Interview them. I've got a feeling that they've got a lot to do with the Grayson kidnapping." It was the day after the operation, and Sherlock was at home.
"I don't mind." Sherlock replies.
"Many of them say stuff along the lines of 'I hope you get better soon', some other ones say 'Does it hurt?', and a couple say that your faking it for attention."
Sherlock did not like this man. Not one bit. "The amount of people who regret sex changes are minuscule compared to the number of people that don't regret it. And even amongst those people who do regret it, it is often because of other people's bigotry and bad reactions. It is no secret that trans people have a harder time finding jobs and even accessing their basic human rights than cis people. And despite this people still want to transition and live their lives how they want to. Teenagers and children may be young, but they're not stupid. If they want to transition, then they should be allowed to transition. At the bare minimum they should be allowed access to puberty blockers."
"Yes. Two, in fact. Intersex people can also have something called an ovotestis, which is an organ with both ovarian and testicular tissue. That is the most common form. I have an extremely rare case of true hermaphroditism, I have a complete female reproductive system, and a partial male one."
"Are you Sarah Hobbs?" John asked her.
John was silent for a moment, taken aback by Sherlock's words. "You deserve to live, Sherlock. You know that, right?"
"Why on earth
"I want to check your blood pressure. If it's low then I'm taking you to hospital." John's tone repelled an argument.
Sherlock held up the newspaper, which showed a picture of himself coming out of New Scotland Yard with his collar turned up. A red arrow pointed at the tube coming out of his nose. The title read 'Is Sherlock Holmes Sick?'
"I'm afraid that there was no plan, John. You couldn't feel a pulse because I didn't have a pulse. I don't remember you even coming near me, because I wasn't alive, John, I'm sorry. I had to make sure you were safe, so I did what Moriarty asked. I died."
At some point Sherlock fell asleep, so John lay a blanket over him and turned down the tv. Sherlock was gone before he woke up the next morning, so neither man mentioned it.
"No, he hasn't. Hurry up with the tube now, I don't have all day." Sherlock shuffled forward to the edge of the sofa.
"I have an immense fear of there being an afterlife. Not just hell, I mean I don't want there to be a heaven or paradise or whatever other nice plane of existence you can think of. I'd prefer that to hell, of course, but it terrifies me. Immortality. Imagine how bored you would get! You stay there for a millennium, and then guess what! You've got an infinite number of millennium after that. Time would become meaningless. It's terrifying, simply terrifying."
"Yes, what would make you think otherwise?" Sherlock said suspiciously.
"We can go home now. You're not allowed to drive so I'll drive you back to baker street. We can get a cup of coffee in Speedy's if you like."
"Hello, this is John Watson. Yes, that's right. Would you be able to bring round some IV fluids and everything needed for a feeding tube, Sherlock's got Hyperemesis Gravidarum. Yes, I am a doctor. His blood pressure's 68/37. Thank you." John hanged up the phone.
He knows his choice, and in two days time he'll know John and Mary's. Until then all Sherlock can do is research more on pregnancy in non-cisgender people, and hope that John wants him do this.
"Sherlock!" he heard. The man stood up swaying slightly, and walked out of the bathroom. John was outside looking for him.
"May I ask, what does your daughter look like?" Sherlock asked. He made a conscious effort to keep his tenses present and not past.
"Thank you. I have had sex, though. I didn't particularly want the sex, but the man gave me 150g of cocaine. That would cost about four and a half to five and a half thousand pounds. I was desperate, and he said he had a 'fetish' for 'trannies'. I was too high to bother to correct him, so I agreed to go back to his place.
"What's wrong Sherly?" Mary slurred sleepily over the phone.
Short chapter this time, sorry. Thank you so much to any one who has commented!
"Isabella Grayson is five years old. If she's not dead, which I know is likely at this point, then she must be terrified. They know I'm the best, so they have to let me take a look at it. She deserves that much at least."
Sherlock pondered it. "Yes, I like that. Post it, make the media seem nosy."
"Not really, I consented. He paid me what he promised. Basically just prostitution." Sherlock looked plain sad and ashamed.
He felt the end of the catheter go in and saw a white stick thing go inside him on the screen. A few seconds later the doctor said, "All done."
"Yeah. Oh god, Mary and I need to start shopping for baby things. We need so much stuff! When we find out the gender in about three weeks it will be easier to shop for clothes and gender-specific things, but at least we can stock up on nappies and dummies."
"Come with me, Sherlock. We are ready to start collecting the ova. Because of your hermaphroditism and your age we are expecting to collect ten eggs if we're lucky. If you were freezing them then that would be problematic, but I understand that you're going to have them implanted this time next week? That means that you won't lose any in the liquid nitrogen tank." she stood up.
"Well, I'm lost," John says, scratching the back of his neck.
John grits his teeth, but isn't deterred. "That you're ... a virgin."
-paper," John explains, then frowns. "For the game."
"No, seriously, what?" John asks.
Oi! It's nice. Really nice, John.

Mycroft studies him for a long moment, before nodding to the driver, discretely watching them in the rearview mirror.
"Oh, you're brilliant," John murmurs as he works a hand over himself (the thin layer of latex not dulling the sensation enough to distract him terribly), and John shortens his strokes, rubbing back and forth over Sherlock's prostate, and Sherlock makes a noise not unlike a sob.
John's laughter brings an answering twitch to his own lips, and John's gaze is steady, unchanged. "Naturally," he says, lightly. "Speaking of story-telling," he says, and he pauses to tamp out his pipe, "I can't help but notice," he holds up his left hand, "that I've never worn a wedding ring."
Sherlock pauses behind him, bending low to read the screen over John's shoulder.
"Of course you do," he agrees, and Sherlock smiles back at him. Then, as if it's taken a second to sink in, he leans forward, squinting at Sherlock. "

This particular torturer Sherlock felt was one of the best and worst for different reasons. He was less imaginative with the pain than most of the others which was an obvious plus, but what wasn't so good was that he was endlessly boring.
deal, but to them it was unexpected, yes, but not nearly as much as some of the other things that have happened within the last few years.
Today, Sherlock, John, and Mary were going to tell Lestrade and Molly about the pregnancy. They (John) had prepared a roast dinner and apple crumble for the event. While they were eating Sherlock was going to tell them all about his intersexuality, and then his decision to be a surrogate.
"Tell me all about it."
From the front Sherlock looked like an average bloke, except for being a bit skinnier and more muscled. Then he lay back down on the bed and turned over so the whole of his back down to the hem of his shorts were visible.
"I didn't know which ones you would prefer. Keep them all and you'll find out which ones are best. Now go and try one of them, I assume you don't need me to tell you how to use them?"
Sherlock knew this was underweight. He was six foot two, and the healthy weight ranges for that height was 65.4 to 88.4 kilos. And it should be more anyway because of the pregnancy.
"It all started two years ago when Mary and I decided we wanted to have a baby."
The three if them walked out of the room and into the hallway. "John, you can wait in the waiting room, or in your car if you are worried about being recognised. It's a simple procedure, so it should only take forty five minutes at the most."
12 July
"Did it involve poetry?" Sherlock asks, somewhat warily.
He works his tongue along the underside of John's cock, spreading his thighs to get a bit lower.
Sherlock smiled at her. "I'm sure Mary. Are you?"
"I know. I thought you would be uncomfortable asking me, so I did it myself. We should be able to find out the gender in six weeks, if you want." Sherlock was kind of dreading the possibility of a gender reveal.
Sherlock knew that there was no question that he would put his body through all of the changes that come with being pregnant. He knew that he would love the child and his priorities would forever be altered, but he would do it.
"Since when did you care about personal safety? Or any safety?" Lestrade's eyes just kept on getting wider.
Except for the fact that John and Mary might (probably would be, if his nearly non-existent dating life was anything to go by) be horrified and disgusted by the very thought of having their precious offspring being nurtured in a man's womb, Sherlock would suggest his solution immediately. Everyone except his close family had avoided him after they found out about his inner workings, but perhaps John and Mary would be different.
-Irena
"Yes. Four months gone. Look." Sherlock pulled his top up to his chest. The skin below was noticeably rounded, and dozens of tiny purple stretch marks had begun to form on the ivory coloured skin. Someone else might be upset about the scars, but Sherlock really couldn't care less.
! The case was solved as soon as the owner thanked him for coming to investigate on a Sunday. The old man had been drugged with enough sedative to make him sleep through Saturday night, the whole of Sunday, and Sunday night. He was very confused when every one told him it was Monday, but after a lengthy explanation the old man understood what had happened. That left the thieves a whole day to steal the Piano. They simply had to look on the CCTV footage of the road outside on the right day to find the license plate of the van the criminals used.
The doorbell rang. Sherlock was lying on the sofa with his eyes closed, asleep now nausea had finally died down slightly because of the injection. John went downstairs and helped Dr Clarke with the stuff she was carrying.
"Oh, you're that famous one. Come in, come in." Sherlock was led into the house. He went through a wide corridor and came into a kitchen where he sat down at the kitchen table.
"You are...?" John spoke.
"During my time away I wasn't exactly on holiday. I made a stupid mistake a year and a half in to the mission, which led to me getting captured in Serbia. They held me in a cell for a month, and then they transported me to another base. Mycroft tried to rescue me on the journey, but unfortunately failed. I was kept and tortured there for four months."
"Are you going to except the money?" John asked.
"I know. I'm sorry that I have been rude to her in the past, or inconsiderate of her feelings. I just didn't know how to act."
Sorry if I get anything wrong medically, still not a doctor.
"How many are you hoping to implant?" Sherlock and John stood up. Sherlock pulled the blue and white hospital gown he was wearing further down his legs.
"And the little girl?"
"Don't worry about the money. It's been taken care of already." Sherlock sat up in his hospital bed and ripped the blood pressure cuff off his upper arm.
"Why are you even asking us if you think you can solve it?" the mother asked.
"I need you to go and get me anything I need for a period. That includes lots of painkillers because
There was a pause on the other end of the line, then "Okay. I'll get a warrant and bring them both in. Do you wanna come down here?"
"I am free at six-thirty. I would quite like to see you every day at that time if that would be alright with you? I want to see you on weekends as well." she said.
"One could also have a testis instead of an ovary, or vice-versa. It is a lot more common than you would think; intersex characteristics are about as common as having red hair. Most people with the gene go through their entire lives without knowing, but for some, like myself, it is more obvious.
"We want whatever you feel comfortable with."
"What do you want to do about it?" the doctor asked.
"Are you angry?"
"I assume that you didn't notice anyone following you." Sherlock had his hands in his prayer position under his chin.
"Yes, just fine." Sherlock couldn't wait for it to be over.
"Yes, that's okay. I've had feeding tubes before."
"And could you tell us just how it's possible for you to be a surrogate, Mr Holmes."
Thirty seconds later Lestrade was coming through the door looking a tad out of breath and far too stressed for this early in the day.
This is just one example, but there are many more different combinations that all come under the heading 'Hermaphrodite'. Anything you'd like to add, John?"
"Oh my god, seriously?" John tightened the cuff around Sherlock's bicep.
"Since thirty-two days ago. Do you have anything for me?" the consultant had his hands interlaced over his stomach. You couldn't see anything now, but in ten weeks time there would surely be a small bump there.
"I haven't managed to keep anything down for a while either. Will that hurt baby Watson?"
"Okay then. Lay back and relax, this shouldn't hurt." Sherlock watched the lab technician pass over the embryos to Dr Clarke.
"I'm pregnant." Sherlock said.
"Just remember, you need to take the injection at two o'clock every day. Goodbye! I am really happy for you." Dr. Clarke beamed.
"What are we going to tell everyone?" John asked to nobody in particular.
"So you're saying the Whitley parents kidnapped her?"
!" With that John stood up and went to get his jacket from the coat rack.
"Would you like a cup of tea? Or coffee?" Mrs Grayson asked.
He hoped the boy or girl didn't look like him. That would make it harder for Sherlock to watch. A young girl with curly, raven-black hair down to her waist comes to mind. When he was three that was what he looked like, until he shouted at his mum and dad that he was definitely a boy, not a girl. He got his first hair cut that day.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Usually I would say no, but you can put it towards the new baby things. I'm going to email her back."
"Tilt your head back..." John dished out instructions to Sherlock who promptly obeyed. Twenty minutes later John was finished, and he taped the end of the tube to Sherlock's cheek.
"Honestly, I have absolutely no idea." John responded. And it was true. How on earth do you decide what to think when you have been given so much information in one go? First of all, his male flatmate is capable of carrying children. That alone is a huge shock. Secondly, said flatmate is willing to carry his child. Sherlock Holmes is not often described as selfless, and he has just offered to do one of the most selfless things John can imagine.
"Sherlock! Are you in here?" Lestrade's gruff voice belted.
John cast his eyes over the bottle and picked up the folder, then began reading. Mary turned her attention to Sherlock instead.
"Isn't that someone who's a bit half and half between genders?" She pulled her purple cardigan closer to her. It was always drafty in this flat.
"55 inches is quite big for even a nine months pregnant."
"No, it's fine. I'm going to bed now. Goodnight, dad. Bonne nuit, maman." the French rolled off his tongue as easily as English.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gradually the pain retreats from excruciating to bearable.
Sherlock also realised that the baby might grow up to be bullied about this. The vast majority of children lack the capability to understand things like gender dysphoria and intersexuality. And when children don't understand things about other people, they bully them.
"I'm sorry, bump?" John looked shocked.
"I don't remember much from that day, but I distinctly remember how dark and dingy this man's flat was. It smelled like damp and drugs and sex. He took me into his bedroom, and had sex with me. Even now I still remember his body above me. He smelled like cocaine and weed. He had a scar from a knife wound above and to the left of his navel. His teeth were rotten.
"Can we have a copy of the ultrasound?" John asked.
"I'll see you soon." Greg said.
"Yes?"
"Now before I say anything," Sherlock started, "Please know that if you like you can stop me at any point and shoot down my idea. I will not be offended." Mary nodded. "Basically speaking, a Hermaphrodite is an organism that has a reproductive system comprised of both male and female parts. He, she, it, they, or whatever other pronouns I'm missing may have a complete reproductive system of one sex and just a small part of the opposite, such as a man with a normal outer appearance but an extra ovary inside of him.
"I've got to get back to the clinic, I've got a shift." Mary replied.
"John?"
"No. I assume this is morning sickness?" Sherlock's voice was raspy.
It felt rather intimate to Sherlock, John's hand on the baby. No-one except himself and Dr Clarke had touched there. It was something that couples do all the time, in fact it would be unusual for the partner not to touch the baby bump that housed their offspring. But no matter how much Sherlock wished it were different, his and John's relationship remained platonic.
"Umm, well, uhh, could you get me an Indian takeaway? I've been fancying one all day. My usual order please." he backed out of what he wanted to say at the last minute.
made up your minds your mind about me being a surrogate or an egg donor?"
"Yes. I used to take testosterone pills to make sure my body didn't become female-looking. I don't anymore though."
"So have I. Remember the cabby?"
She hanged up. Sherlock felt relief that they took it well. He went to bed and fell asleep within ten minutes.
"Oh there you are. Shit you look bad. Here, let me help you." John wrapped his arm around the detective's waist and helped him over onto the couch.
"Good news. You can start taking the injections now. I'll show you how to do them, and if you get stuck then just talk to John or Mary. I understand you are both in the medical profession?" Dr. Clarke placed a thick file down on her desk whilst she was talking.
"Thank you, and first names are fine." John replied.
"Yeah, tell me about it. This story is rather unusual, and pretty much guaranteed to stir some strong opinions. We will explain more in a minute." John pushed open the door that lead into the lounge.
Now Lestrade looked at him with worry. "You're not on the sweets again, are you Sherlock?"
"Oh my god. That's my baby. I can see where my baby is." John's voice was quiet. He stepped forwards until he was right in front of Sherlock, looking down at the evidence that his child was growing.
The young woman -probably no more than 20 years old- said "Six. How about you?"
"What would you want me to do if something like that happened before the baby's born?"
"At the time we were considering already considering surrogacy, but even so when Sherlock offered to be a surrogate for us we were, needless to say, surprised."
"I didn't realise you got lonely."
For the main course, Sherlock ordered a ham pizza, John a lasagne, Mary a salad, and Greg a pizza topped with an egg. They all started eating, but Sherlock had something else on his mind.
"Thank you doctor. When do I see you again?"
The newsreader lunged at Sherlock, but John quickly stepped out in front of him and threw the man to the floor. Then, he crouched down to his level and grabbed him by the collar, bringing his face in close. "Don't you even
"So like, a vagina and a penis?"
"We are going to look into a combination of surrogacy and donor conception now so if we did have a child then he or she would at least have genetic relations to one of his parents. If we don't find a surrogate we like then we are going to adopt. John and I are desperate to have a child Sherlock, I can't believe that it is going to be so hard!" Mary's eyes then started to water again, but she quickly wiped them with her sleeve.
"Well, John and I tried to have children for a long time, but unfortunately about ten months ago we found out that I would never be able to."
"Yes, why?"
"Do you want to know? You may hate me afterwards."
Whilst he was tucking in to his crispy duck, John suddenly thought about what everyone else is going to think about Sherlock. From what he'd gathered, only Sherlock's family knew that he could have children. Unless they all move to a quiet spot in the countryside, once Sherlock starts to show people are going to talk. Considering the fact that they were now celebrities, the press would probably take an interest in his new figure.
"No, I'm not from the press. I'm a detective, but not from the police. My name is Sherlock Holmes, you might have heard of me."
"What, both?"
Nine months after they first share a bed, Sherlock proposes at a crime scene in front of the whole of Scotland Yard. Despite it being completely inappropriate, John says yes, and three months later they're married.
John checked the counter and saw that it had a fifteen-thousand view increase since before the latest post went up.
They both fell into a fit of unmanly giggles at how absurd that sounded. Sherlock, pregnant?
"I'll need to take some of these files home to look at fully, but I'll have caught you a killer by tomorrow. Laters!" Sherlock left the room and headed home after he snatched the file from Lestrade without an apology. At least it would give him something to do for the next day or so.
"Yes. You'd be surprised on how little rights we have. I want to talk about it to the media when I come out, you know, raise awareness."
When John and Mary came in they looked around with open mouths at the state of the flat. Sherlock suddenly felt self-conscious about how over prepared he was. He drummed his fingers against his leg and greeted Mary and John with a rare warm smile.
An unbidden thought springs into Sherlock's mind. He knew that he was born a rarity. A freak, is what anyone who has come anywhere close to sleeping with Sherlock had said. He had been born with two sets of reproductive systems, both male and female, one behind the other. He was a True Hermaphrodite, intersex, whatever you want to call it.
"John!" Sherlock yelled. He had gotten back from the yard half an hour earlier.
"Off and on from age thirteen to six months before you met me."
Sherlock finished the story. "I was told when I was a teenager that I can't father children. It was also said to me that I might be able to, well, mother them. Long story short, I am three months pregnant as a surrogate and egg donor for John and Mary."
"Where? I can't see her, where is she?" Sherlock sounded panicked. Everyone in that room knew how to read ultrasounds except for him.
John hesitated, then let out a big sigh. "Okay. Tell her, but if something bad happens it's on your head."
"I know. Still, this is the first time I forgot." Sherlock said.
John face-palmed.
"Of course, love." Mary said. "I found out a while ago that I cannot have children."
"We do have something to tell you all, that's why we invited you. Sherlock, do you want to start?" John spoke up.
When he was done heaving, Sherlock leant back against John's chest in exhaustion. John pulled some toilet paper out and handed it to Sherlock so he could wipe his face off.
"Me, oh yes, just fine. Was that a bit not good?"
"Now Mr Holmes, would you please sign here to say that you consent to having this procedure done." The doctor handed her patient the form on a clipboard and a pen. Sherlock signed it quickly in big overdramatic strokes that had made John raise his eyebrows the first time he saw it.
"Of course it is." John got to work typing up the next page of his blog. He hadn't updated it in a while because Sherlock hadn't been taking as many cases. It only took John fifteen minutes to get the draft done.
"Thank you Jenny. Goodbye." he schooled his expression to look blank.
After he went to the library he continued his research at home. Sherlock found several more stories from parents who were non-binary, trans, and a few intersex. There was a mix of promising results and negative results from all genders.
"Could you tell me my options?"
They all left, John with Mary, and Sherlock alone.
"Has this happened before?" he asked gently. Sherlock flushed the toilet.
"I'm just going to the bathroom. Do not move anything!" Sherlock instructed. He went out of the glass door and down the corridor.
"If the kid starts breaking into crime scenes then don't blame me, okay?"
"Is your bladder full?" she asked. A lab technician was also in there looking at some slides on a microscope.
"You are the best friend a guy could ask for. Thank you so much, Sherlock." John said into his mate's ear.
"Well then, are you ready?" Dr Clarke asked. Today was the big day.
Mary continued, "Thank you. Anyway, we went back to Baker Street for a cup of tea and we told him what we'd just found out.
"She's alive." Sherlock let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding.
Over the next few months, John begins to sleep in Sherlock's bed a lot more often. After a while he brings his clothes downstairs into Sherlock's room, as well as a few of his possessions. John stops dating, and Sherlock sleeps a lot more often. When they go out on their first date and have sex for the first time, neither of them have ever been happier.
"Oh no, that was quite enough. I was just ruling out that you could have anything to do with it." Sherlock said nonchalantly.
"Well bye then. I'll drop by after my shift with the formula to make the food. See you then." John put on his coat.
"You tell me."
"This," John says, lips brushing the nape of Sherlock's neck as he crouches behind him, "is the most ridiculous position I've ever tried."
, pulling off a bit to tongue at the head of John's prick, to trace the slit, to purse his lips in a filthy kiss against the glans.
21 July
a pleasure, John," Mycroft replies, without looking up from the file in front of him.
"What?" John asks, glancing up from his laptop, and Sherlock's gaze darts away.
Sherlock pulls off a bit, opening his mouth and making room for his other hand to wrap around John's length; he wanks him, quickly, the head of John's cock resting on Sherlock's tongue (and
"Greek God of the East Wind," Mycroft says, absently, and - off John's look, "Eurus."
"Just this," Sherlock says, leaning down again, "for a little longer."
"Oh," he remembers, "Furniture. Clean-up. Dull." Those details hadn't seemed particularly important, but he dutifully rolls the condom on.

"The clown," he says, "and the girl on the plane."
He sucks in a noisy breath, John still moving slowly inside him, thumbing Sherlock's nipple, almost idly. Sherlock pushes himself up on shaky arms. "Now you," he says, voice not much steadier, and John pulls out, sitting back on his heels, as Sherlock turns around.
Mycroft presses his lips together for a moment. "You plan on proposing. To
John fucks him through it, gentling his thrusts, as Sherlock shakes, trying again to lift up, and John follows him, rocking into him, and his toes squeeze together as he clenches down on John through the aftershocks.
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him, but follows him into the kitchen, hopping up onto the clear(-ish) tabletop. John steps into him, grabbing his hips and tugging him towards the very edge of the table.
17 July
Sherlock waves a lazy hand at him in reply, and something about the flourish of his wrist makes John smile again.
Hmmm, something else? Give me a minute.
"John," Sherlock says, apology written in every line of him (sorry for not
Sherlock makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat. "Hurry up," he frowns, and John laughs against his mouth, pausing to kiss him again, mouths open and soft, and Sherlock reaches his free hand up to cradle John's cheek.
Sherlock's forehead makes him see red, literally and figuratively.
"You're a disgrace, quit embarrassing me and my date and leave." John thinks that he sees a flicker of hurt Sherlock's face at this, so ex-lovers probably, and the drug addict seems to still carry a flame deep down, he muses.
He tended to mask that side of himself, from early on as taught by his mother and her side of the family. And that was the arrow that drove a wedge between him and Harry, the fact that she's always been aware of something not quite right, of a secret being kept from her.
Finally he puffs and opens his mouth. 'You even washed the jar. Figures, the only time you ever bother to  wash something is when you bin an entire, perfectly fine jar of jam to grow
'John was in the army, Lestrade. He had bad days..' Sherlock doesn't bother to offer anything else, and John is now too busy obessing over the meaning of Sherlock's hold on him and his reaction to it.
Successful surgeon, eventual Sugar Daddy John. Takes a younger, drug addict Sherlock off the streets and nurses him back to health. They slowly develop a wonderful relationship, with its ups and downs and all sorts of conflicts.
John gritts his teeth and is preparing  to excuse himself from Lestrade who'd meanwhile called Donovan over for something, but he shortly tunes them out because he thinks..

Sherlock blushing.
Grabbing a hold of the copper's collar, he one handedly manages to pull the huge man from over and across Sherlock, and throw him half-way across the room. Pulse pounding in his temples, John ignores everything and stalks over to the giant form struggling to get up on the floor.
Mycroft's gasping, face in a grimace of pain, and his other leg gives until he's kneeling at John's feet, completely at his mercy, hanging by his hand in John's crushing grip.
threw him across the
He almost wails, one hand slipping agaist the door and he has to catch himself. For his part, John's head feels hazy at the taste of them both combined. His cock twiches against his leg but he ignores it completely, focusing and lavishing all his attention on his detective.
Over the steam from the kettle and the usual chemicals, he can just sense that heady scent of a freshly showered Sherlock, emanating from those damp, dark chocolate curls.
at least another week..
Tonight has been hard, cases involving kids are always the most difficcult. Hoggins, the serial kidnapper and murderer had been a beast of a man, and John shudders to think what wold have happened to Sherlock had John not been there. The thought makes his heart shrivel and drop to his stomach. How has it come to this, how has he let himself go in such a spectacularly fucking way he hasn't the faintest. He's never been so gone on someone before, never. And it's over a man, of all.
When he wakes up, he realizes he's never before had more need or had it been as crucial that he keeps his cool.

While stopping their side of the scrum from moving backwards, the props also support the hooker's body weight, allowing him or her to see and strike the ball when it is put into the scrum. In the lineout, props should be able to support or lift the jumper to prevent the opposition winning the ball.
Sherlock's half laying back, resting on his elbows  with a startled look on his face.
'John, move away!!!!' Greg shouts, but John can't focus on his words and he's angry.
Soon people come knocking at the door, and John starts to feel a bit alarmed not only by the number of Holmeses, but also by the sickening shade of pale Sherlock's face takes by the time they're all seated.
, going through mild withdrawal, probably hasn't had his dose in at least a day.
He's wound up tight, and he spares a second to think, at the back of his mind, that if he unclenched his teeth he'd snap. Sherlock is tense in front of him, gun trembling slightly, though not a lot. John spares another second to think he needs to teach Sherlock how to shoot and keep his cool better. But the younger man is determined and despite being afraid, and for once John can see that he is, he's very brave. He also saw the tiniest effect his actions and words had had on Sherlock, before the detective locked the bothersome
John coughs, embarassed but shrugs. The scum tried to shoot Sherlock, John doesn't need to explain himself, although he knows he's contaminated the evidence around the room, including some..parts of the body which ended up being kicked about.
'Listen, you little prick. I've had to listen to you yap like the dog you are and mouth off about my partner all night, but that's enough, do you understand?', John's voice had turned firm and stern, what his friends used to call his 'Captain Watson' voice. He pauses briefly, leaning slightly forward towards Gerrick who looks insulted and stunned to be addressed in such a way.
'You are being utterly unreasonable today John but of course, I could tell this morning by your choice of clothing. You always wear that ridiculous jumper when you're having a bad day, have you noticed?'
'Let me see.'
Victor stalks forward, enraged and his arm readies to strike for a second time, but John's had quite enough.
Some time passes and soon desert is served, which is delicios, John quite enjoys the hot cherry pie with vanilla icecream and chocolate syrup, which he sees Sherlock steal a couple of bites of when he thinks John and everyone else's not looking. Inevitably, the other shoe drops.
Turning his head, John's nose smudges against Sherlock's neck, and his mouth opens to mouth greedily at that wonderfully soft skin there, making the taller man moan breathlessly.
"Belt, please." Sherlock scoffs at this but does it up and they're soon off to Baker Street. They don't speak but it seems like they are communicating somehow. John's hormones are playing with him, he's feeling some deep sense of anticipation and he has a myriad of questions. But he knows he soon has to see to the young man. He needs a bath, he needs a thorough check up and help with his withdrawal.
'Today I've heard Sherlock's head crack on that pavement a thousand times, and I've been unable to look into his eyes for fear they wouldn't be looking back. And I've only been seeing red, and red and red. All,
"Your
'John, i'm fine.'
The young man,
'Remember that time Lisa, when poor Sherlock took that rugby ball to his face?', John's eyes narrow as he calmly sips his wine and he makes a decision, lowering himself a bit in his seat so he can reach out and squeeze Sherlock's knee in between his thighs.
The footage was captured by the cameras at the pool, and Mycroft had taken care to destroy them, especially after specfic instructions from Jane Watson. John's going to try to convince Sherlock to destroy this one too. But seeing Sherlock's smile die and shoulders tense up once the John onscreen slumps over on top of Sherlock, blood pooling everywhere, he thinks he won't need to do much convincing.
He plucks the blue satin handkerchief out of his suit pocket and hands it to Sherlock, who takes it hesitantly and gently wipes at his nose. He ignores him when he hands it back.
Sherlock gives a deep moan and opens his lips to John, who licks inside, tongue sliding wetly against the other man's. He grunts at the delicious feeling of it, the sweet, wet, warm taste of Sherlock. The feeling of his elegant hands, one fisted in his hair to keep his mouth fixed on his, the other on his arse, pushing him closer between his spread legs.
John doesn't bother to get up to offer a cuppa since Mycroft leaves as soon as he places the disk on the coffee table, no words said.
John's not aware of anything else other than the tosser in front of him, who'd been the cause of their pain more often than not. To John, it still feels like Mycroft was the one who fed Sherlock to that wolf, Moriarty. And here he is, on this blasted day, hurting Sherlock again and making John want to grind him to a pulp. He's often wanted to, and now he's finally snapped. So John's not aware of anything else, he;s not aware that everyone's stopped what they were doing to watch the going ons. Lestrade, who was already making his way over to them, runs over and makes to interfere but Sherlock, still cupping his red cheek, stops him with an arm.
Lestrade wipes his face with both hands before peeking through his fingers at John.
'Right, Sherlock I expect those papers to be on my desk tomorrow at 9am sharp, or I'll make sure you don't get another case for three weeks. Donovan, Anderson, let's go.'
They soon pull up in front of 221B Baker Street. John takes a moment to hunt for his wallet and phone before he steps out of the car, door gently clicking shut. Sherlock joins him as they step up to the door.
Lestrade's going to enjoy the hell out of hearing John's taken the Holmes brothers down a peg or two, in Russian.
Victor's snatched his writs back by now and is rubbing it, hissing in pain. John takes a curt step back, positioning himself almost subconsciously in front of Sherlock.
His eyes are scrolling up and down John's body, Lestrade can't tell much obviously but he gets the gist of what's going through the man's mind. Lestrade's almost tempted to look closer at John's shoulder wound but he can always ask John at the pub later.
This should be good, note the sarcasm.
Licking his lips, he siletly steps forward and feels his body go numb and tingly at the same time, like a limb you've sat on for too long. He can see his bright future stretch out in front of him, like the cheesiest romcom he's ever watched, but it doesn't matter anymore.
John is sitting on the side of his bed watching him through wet eyes.
Stunned silence followed.
Dimmock looked uncomfortable for a minute, scrambling for a good response. The doors opened before he could think of one though, and Sherlock walked out.
"I'm pregnant."
"That's great. Now, I need you to tell me everything you remember about the day she went missing."
"I understand if the BBC won't cover our story. LGBTQ issues very often result in people being unsupportive and sometimes disgusted. The only reason I want to do this is to raise awareness of what it is like to be trans or intersex." Sherlock spoke.
"Mary and I have been trying
Sherlock hesitated. "Anorexia Nervosa."
"You actually know her name. Now that's surprising. I'll go now, just wait there." Lestrade left.
"No. We have rich relatives and very large inheritances. My grand-mère had lots of properties across England and France, and when she died she left everything to us. Remember that hotel by the sea you went to for your honeymoon for free because I said the owner owed me a favour?"
"Yes yes, it's awesome, etcetera. Now pass me over."
"You should buy clothes with different gender-targets. She might grow up as a Tom-boy."
Sherlock struggled for about ten seconds with his trousers and then quickly pocketed the box. He pushed the door open.
"Are you sure you're alright?" John stood up.
"What the- Sherlock! Get out here right now or I'm breaking this bloody door down!"
"I do know that."
"Why are you staring?" Sherlock asked without turning his head away from his book.
"John, you are the only person who has succeeded in living with me for a period of more than two weeks, excluding my parents and Mycroft. The odds of finding someone willing to live with me are slim, and that is without even factoring in the romantic elements. I don't know how to do romance. And anyway, most people around my age will have some level of disgust towards my body."
Sherlock got a text from Mycroft. It read
"Of course. There are lot's of different factors, so I'll just list some elements you should consider. There's pain relief, which can be an epidural, gas and air, or even just meditation. You can have a water birth, which many women say can help ease some of the pain. There's the choice between at a hospital or at home. And, if you don't want any natural births, then you can always get a cesarean. That'll leave you with a scar though."
"I think we should tell Mrs Hudson I'm pregnant. I know it's early days, but she's really worried, I can see it written all over her. She's bringing me cups of tea every hour and chatting to me and holding my hand and saying that if I ever need to talk to someone then she's there for me. It's awful, John. Awful!"
"I'm good, love. Do you need something? Or have you just come for a little chat?" She shut the newspaper and put it to one side.
John left Sherlock in the sitting room while he collected the food.
He had asked Dr. Clarke when he was 16 about the likely hood of having children. She said that it is possible for him to father his own offspring barring any complications that the rest of the male population face, like bad swimmers. In order for him to mother children though he would have to either use a surrogate or go off of his testosterone and start on some Oestrogen for a half year at least before attempting to conceive. After his last cocaine-morphine binge Mycroft took him back to Dr. Clarke, who was now a lot older than when he last saw her, and she said that despite his reckless behaviour there was no damage to his reproductive organs. The detective was immensely lucky in this regard, most people have their chances of parenting greatly reduced after taking as much drugs as he had.
Sherlock went up to the kitchen and opened the tin with the crackers. He took two plain ones out and went back to the sofa. Once sitting he took the tiniest bite out of the corner of one of them. The detective chewed it, swishing it around his mouth and trying not to gag.
"Yes, bump. I started properly showing about a week ago, but I have been able to see something there for about a month. Why? I told you all of this three days ago." Sherlock signalled to the barista to get him the bill.
John opened the door.
"Bye Jenny. Thanks for this." Sherlock said.
"Yep."
"I'm sorry?"
"The takeaway is arriving in about fifteen minutes. Make yourselves at home." Sherlock said.

He nuzzles John's groin through his trousers, and John leans forward to grab the edge of the table. Sherlock rubs his cheek against John's cock, likes, John assumes, from the tiny smile, the way it twitches against his face.
"Shut up," Sherlock murmurs, without heat. He's

Sherlock pulls back a little, panting, soft and warm against the inside of John's thigh. "Not good?" he asks, warily, and John lifts his head from the pillow for a moment.
haha awww.
It's not a cipher.
"Shut up," he whispers, nose brushing Sherlock's cheek, and Sherlock turns his head into the kiss, slow and sweet and full of promise.
"Victor Trevor," he finally says, eyes darting between John and Mycroft (and if John didn't know better, he'd call it self-consciously).
"Very clever," John says, drily, and Mycroft tilts his head to the side. "Look," John says, bracing his elbows on the desk, "He's your brother. I

He leans over, bracing one hand on the bed beside Sherlock's side and drags his cock back up and down again, and Sherlock shuffles, spreading his legs, just a little. He pushes against Sherlock's entrance again before pulling away.
John sighs when the black car pulls up beside him, but reluctantly climbs inside. It's been a

"You know this isn't doing much?" John doesn't really ask.

Stop that.
Reluctantly, he wraps his hands around Sherlock's top leg, presses a quick kiss to his ankle, before moving it back down, so both of Sherlock's legs are hanging off the side of the table again. Sherlock pulls himself up and drapes an arm around John's shoulders as he tugs him into a sweet, light kiss.
"Yes," he finally says, softly, barely moving his mouth, and he certainly didn't intend to say

"Oh, that's lovely," John breathes, lifting his head a little to watch Sherlock again, and Sherlock presses his forehead to the inside of John's thigh for a moment.

He reaches up to tease the slick head of John's prick with his fingertips as he places a series of sucking kisses down the length of his shaft, and John's knees lift up, restlessly, at the teasing touch.
"I have," he says, driving his lower body harder into the carpet, "tight hips."
Sherlock scowls at him. "'Maybe he doesn't take his ring off when he's unfaithful, Sherlock'," he mimics, "

Sherlock puffs on his pipe for a moment; collects his thoughts. "I would've said," and he pauses, because he's said it so many times, in so many ways, in so many

Sherlock pushes up from his forearms, straightening his arms and balancing on his palms, to frown at John.
Sherlock laughs a little (embarrassed, proud) into the fold of his arms, and John's breath is punching out of him through gritted teeth.
John lets him open the door. "You
he miscalculated this; "Forgive me," he murmurs, pointlessly, to the John sitting in front of him.
Sherlock, we're all waiting for you to figure it out.

, mouth against John's and, "If this is happening," John says, deadpan, "I'm not touching anything," holding up his hands like he's being mugged, Christ, but he does get a bit stupid, sometimes, around Sherlock like this.
Mycroft's smile is thin, strained. "I think not," he finally says, with remarkable restraint.
No. :)
I doubt you'd be able to figure out how.
"Miss me?"
"Eurus," Sherlock says again, agitated.
," Sherlock says, vicious and triumphant, and John blinks.
"Of course not," John says, lifting his right arm in invitation. "But you knew all that, anyway." Sherlock rolls into his side, presses a quick kiss to John's shoulder through his thin pyjama shirt as John wraps his arm around him. There's a pause. "Except."

"I," Sherlock says blankly, blinking, rapidly, "That is-" he swallows, and John loves him all the more for it, reaching up to kiss along his jaw -

He moves up and down John's cock, his mouth tight and wet and John reaches for him.

"Mmnn," Sherlock hums, a little dubiously, and John laughs, incredulous and delighted.
"You haven't asked anything," John points out, and Sherlock shrugs, reaching for his glass.

"Do you have anything to say?" he prompts, and John pretends to think.

"The outside of the ring is shiny, polished," Sherlock says, rapid-fire, running his thumb over the ring in question, "State of his marriage right there. He's sentimental-"
Leave it, Harry.

"What girl, Sherlock?" Mycroft asks.
"Oh," Sherlock says, quietly, then - "
John hums in agreement, pecking at his keyboard. "Red herring," he murmurs, turning slightly to look at Sherlock, who gapes at him, before turning back to the screen.
"When you were - away," John says, and Sherlock glances back up, and,
I just told you how to solve it. How could you not figure it out?
?" John mouths, and Mycroft ignores him.
He braces himself on one forearm, reaching over to the bedside table with his free hand, groping around in the top drawer for the lube, and John strokes his side, languidly, before turning his hand palm-up for the lube. Sherlock squeezes some into his hand and tosses the bottle aside, not bothering to check where it lands, and John doesn't quite bite off his laugh as he slicks them both up.

If you're asking what I think you're asking, then yes.
There's a lot to take in, there, but - "Relationship?" John asks, and Sherlock, Sherlock rolls his
21 July
It's been three days...
John grimaces. "I thought you were the smart one," he needles, off-hand and only barely derisive, but enough to get under Mycroft's skin a little, just a little, "Bit obvious."
"You think," Sherlock says, dully, "that-"
Sherlock's eyes widen momentarily, one of his elbows bending slightly in surprise. He processes that. John lets him.
Really, John?
"You've never ... deduced her," he points out, and Sherlock tilts his head to the side.

than this," John says.
already that he's trembling.
"John," Mycroft says, reluctantly, and John doesn't lift his head.
He eventually speaks,  voice even deeper than usual.
Interrupting the irate man, Sherlock snorts derisively and he cocks his head in a strange reptilian manner, to gaze at the date in question for only a fraction of a second. He looks at her from top to bottom so fast then takes a breath and straightens up. John looks on with baited breath, eyes flickering back and forth.
Not even half an hour later, John's had enough. Mycroft and Sherlock are engaged in their favorite game of one-upping one another and speaking about John as if he isn't in the room.
Gerrick smiles condescendingly, 'Well, there wasn't much we Holmes weren't good at, barring some exceptions,' he pauses slightly to glance at Sherlock meaningfully, 'I was quite enamoured with rugby and-'
The sight that meets his eyes make his blood boil.
The haze still hasn't lifted form John's mind, it feels like he's in a dream. His movements are a bit slugglish and yet his body is still tense and ready to go in overdrive.
The day went by fast in a constant buzz, and John would have appreciated being able to enjoy a bit more quiet, however the sleep had been good the night before, and he'd enjoyed a brisk walk around the beautiful Manor grounds before it was time for tea.
John hates Wednesdays as a rule, but that's been amplified today due to the date. Four years now and still he can't help the sickness in his stomach on 16th of January. He's been having flashes of blood running on the pavement and sightless eyes staring emptily into his soul all day, at the most inopportune moments.
John's form is perfect, he's pushing himself up and makes it look like it's the easiest exercise in the world. Clapping once is hard, Lestrade remembers from his police training days, but three?!
John turns his head. His baritone voice is like smooth, golden honey. If his eyes weren't so dilated, John thinks they could be green.
Mycroft had sent his apologies, quoting work and a terrible business with Iran, forcing Sherlock's hand, and consequently John's, to attend the Christmas do instead.
'Christ how am I going to explain this?! Jesus John..fucking hell Sherlock, are you okay?'
Sherlock sighs before swirls around and stalks out of the room, John in his wake, shouting behind.
John had almost  taken the train back to London but had forced himself to reconsider. He had no business behaving like a jealous fool, Sherlock was free to get with homever he liked. They weren't in a relationship..they haven't even kissed.
Yeah, John doubts this prick knows anything about rugby, so he cuts him off. 'Oh, I imagine you'd fit the position of a
Growling, he steps forward to press his whole body to Sherlock's who moans and pushes back against him. Long fingered hands drop the cup of tea John forgot he was holding and they ignore it and don't care when  it doesn't break as it splashes in the half full sink. Sherlock's hands fist on the edge of the counter just next to John's and he pushes back, drops down to push back and up, back and up on John's thin clad erection. He is maddening, he could devour him, John thinks.
'No sweetheart, I want you to come just from this. Just from me.' Sherlock groans and puts his hands back against the door, head hanging low.
Later they'll both watch, to Sherlock's great satisfaction, pride, arousal and burning curiosity as John tears Moriarty to shreds. Much to John's embarassment. Okay, and dark satisfaction. His mouth pools with saliva when he remembers cutting into that snake's throat.
The thought of it drives him mad, makes him growl, and he breaks off and pulls away, ignoring Sherlock's protesting 'Jawn!'. He roughly turns the detective around and drags his suit jacked off, thankful for it being warm enough now that he no longer needs the Belstaff. He then presses Sherlock against the door, hand fisting in his hair again and pulling his head back to whisper in his ear from behind.
Once back from the army, when his surgeon career had properly taken off John had made a proposal to invest in 221 Baker Street, as a way to partially repay Mrs. Hudson for all she'd done for him. He managed to convince her after some effort, and now the house is state of the art and they have joint ownership. All the flats, including C are elegant but modest and he's also bought the properties adjacent and behind 221, so they are now connected and there's more space.
