“You fell? You need help?” Cas’s voice started to get that edge it usually had when he was stressed about something, and Dean felt awful for upsetting him.
“Dean- o!” Gabe yelled and Dean flinched at his loud voice. His friend was sitting on the counter between the two sinks, nursing a half empty bottle of Jack Daniels and giving Dean a lopsided smile. His eyes were drooping and the smell of cheap alcohol hit Dean in the face like a hammer.
Dean laughed. Leave it to Cas to ask nicely about someone's day while insulting someone else in the same sentence.
Dean was about to ask if he was okay when he heard Cas exhale shakily before he turned around to face him.
Dean shoved it aside. Cas didn't need him to drool all over him. It was clear that Cas needed a friend, and Dean wanted to be that for him. If something else came of it in the future he wouldn't complain, but right now earning his trust was more important.
Dean thought about it. The streets were silent, there was barely any traffic at this time of the night. They were at an intersection, the
Heaving chests pressed together as they carefully removed their hands, Dean reaching for a napkin before noticing that Cas was licking his own hand like it was the world's best lollipop. His brain stopped functioning for a moment while taking in that sight, and Cas raised an eyebrow while licking a stray drop of come from his wrist.
A weight has been lifted off his chest, and he feels giddy now about what he created. “Can I show you around?”
I decided to start this exact story again,  because the original idea is something slightly different than what I created here. Since it went off the path that I had imagined for it, I find myself unable to continue working on this. No chapter ideas are working because it just doesn't fit what is in my head.
"Bed sounds great," he mumbled against Cas's lips. Cas responded by stroking Dean's cock for a moment before letting go and nudging Dean away to stand up.
Dean shrugs. “They said they’d pay extra, like, big extra. I told them yes, it’s their first order with us, could turn into more. I’ll take care of most of the work, and Charlie said she’d help.”
"Oh, you got a pretty man then? No worries darling, we're good folks here. You should bring him with you to chose the wall colors next time. Bet you two are real cute together." She winked at him and Dean reddened even further. "There we go sweetie, you're good to go. See you then"
“Yeah,” Dean says, and gives him what he hopes to be an encouraging smile. “At least we must be friends
"No idea but I think so? If heaven has urgent business I'm pretty sure there are ways." Dean leaned back in his chair again, staring at the table.
He sighed before running his hand through his hair one last time, artfully tousling it as per usual. A spritz of the special aftershave Sam had gotten him for Christmas, and he was good to go.
"California. He's at Stanford, full ride and all. That kid's crazy smart, and I'm fucking proud of him. I just wish..." Dean interrupted himself to rub his eyes."Just wish he'd call, you know. I spent so much of my life taking care of him. Our dad was gone a lot and he pretty much only had me. He bailed as soon as he could to get far away from his disappointment of a family, and I get it. But that doesn't mean it didn't break my fucking heart. Now he calls for the big holidays, but he forgot my birthday this year. Not like I'm a child or whatever, but man."
Dean finishes sweeping the floor, then rearranges the string lights that wind their way all along the wooden beams of the partly open ceiling. Some have glass snowflakes hanging off them that are turning gently and glinting in the light, and Dean loves nudging them. As he turns to pick up a stray receipt from under a table he sees the man from yesterday walk past the shop. He stops for a moment and they look at each other through the glass, but then he hurries away again.
"Quit hovering Sammy, I got this," Dean gave him a strained smile while trying to maneuver Cas into the backseat. He had to be careful not to hit his head since Cas apparently decided that taking a spontaneous nap in the middle of walking would be a great idea. When every limb was safely tucked inside and Cas was sitting in a way that wouldn't give him any weird cricks in his neck when he woke up, Dean shut the door and then got into the driver's seat.
Then, finally, it’s time to go home. Cas needs a bit longer, sitting in the young hunter’s room he had been taking care of earlier. The young man looks like he’d been crying, and Dean leaves them to it, Cas’ gentle words floating out of the bedroom after him.
He smiled then and walked over to the light switch on the wall. He flicked it on and voilá, the room was in a bright but nice glow. Dean specifically looked for the kind of lightbulbs that imitate sunlight, since Cas enjoyed being outside a lot. "Hey, you wanna go make some food? I'm starving," Dean proposed while throwing away the old lightbulb and the packaging of the new one.
Dean ground down into Cas who was cradling his face carefully, in stark contrast to his answering hip rolls. With a kiss to Cas's Adam's apple, the hollow of his throat and down his chest, Dean tasted every inch of his skin. A quick flick to one nipple, a pinch to the other and on he traveled over Cas's soft stomach. His tongue followed the trail of hair from his belly button pointing downwards before nudging against Cas's cock with his chin. He pulled back and looked at Cas to make sure he was alright, and he looked wrecked: spit-slick lips, his chest flushed and heaving. He stared at Dean with wide eyes before swallowing audibly.
“I did.” Cas shifts slightly but stays put. “I’m still a bit confused about why we didn’t start with the first one, though.”
“I cleaned up your face and hands, brought you the blanket and pillow and made you drink some water. I tried to get you inside before that, but you were very stubborn and I didn't want to accidentally hurt you. I wasn’t sure if you needed to go to the hospital, but from the vomit I figured you’d be okay, and you reacted when I pinched your arm.”
He takes Cas’ hand and squeezes it, intertwines their legs and turns his head slightly to meet Cas’ eyes.
“What?” Dean laughs, but as he sees Cas starting to look uncomfortable he throws him a lifeline. “Like cock? Absolutely. My favorite thing right after pie.”
"No problem, kid." Ben was wearing his usual jeans and a polo shirt, and he was driving them to a family-owned bakery a couple streets away from Cas’s house. They had ordered the cake almost two weeks in advance, simply because Dean had been way too anxious for something to go wrong, and so he figured the earlier the better.
“I do want to. I really, really want to. I miss you,” Dean said and now Sam’s eyes looked awfully shiny.
They talk about Cas’ shift and mundane things, and Dean makes a mental note to ask Cas if he has any plans for New Year’s Eve. Gradually people get up and migrate to the kitchen until they’re the only ones left.
Dean was awoken by the warm gleam of sunshine on his face. He rubbed his eyes with his hand and opened them, blinking against the brightness. Sam was still dead to the world, his head and floppy hair buried into one end of the couch, his feet hanging off the other.
"Dean.. I don't know what to tell you exactly, but if you don't start trusting Sam to make his own decisions, you will end up in another fight with them, and I'm not there to pick you back up then. I'm still in Maine with Crowley."
Angels and humans weren't supposed to be together, yet there were countless love stories scattered across the world, told over centuries. Heaven's soldiers weren't even supposed to feel anything at all besides the importance of their duty and loyalty to heaven, yet Castiel knew firsthand how strong emotions were and how they dominated his decisions every day since the day that he met Dean.
Cas took it in stride, pulling back slightly but not pulling off. He kept Dean in his mouth after his orgasm faded and he started to soften. Only when Dean squirmed with too much sensitivity did Cas pull off. Dean let his neck relax and his head dropped to the pillow. He felt Cas's warmth leave him for a moment before Cas crawled back onto the mattress and pulled the blanket up with him. Dean turned to the side, burrowed his face in Cas's neck and rested his arm over Cas's stomach. Cas pulled Dean as close to him as possible. His strong arms held him tight and he pressed a series of featherlight kisses to Dean's head.
They circle back to the car, several full bags in their hands. They bought a little stand with several fresh herbs in little clay pots, and it was absolutely Dean's idea, and he can't wait to put fresh basil on the homemade pizza later.
They walk slowly, hyper aware of their surroundings in case their intel was wrong, and there is more than one Djinn working alone. The hope to find the missing teenage boy alive pushes them forward in the unforgiving weather, and soon enough they reach an iron door with rust creeping in around the edges.
“Dean? Why aren’t you at work? What’s wrong?” Concern written all over his face, Cas pulled him inside and closed the door. He walked him to the couch and gently nudged him so Dean would sit down, before sitting down on the coffee table himself, facing Dean.
Dean takes a box cutter from his pocket and slices through the tape. “Take a look,” he says, and Charlie squeals as she pulls them out of the package.
Dean grinned and got up. "Right back at you. I have to get some stuff done today, so I'm gonna have to leave now, but I'm really looking forward to Friday. And white wine has been noted. Text me if you think of anything else."
A minute later a tall man wearing scrubs with an impressive jawline comes up to him. “Can I help you?”
“Yeah!” Dean’s imagining it all; warm lighting and good music, food and his family, and he feels happy. “We got enough space to invite people, like Jody, Donna and the kids.”
Warm summer rain soaked Dean's shirt within seconds. He ran through Cas's garden and knocked on the door, glad to be safe from the sudden outpouring.
They pull apart after a small forever, far enough so Dean feels like he could breathe if it wasn't for his chest imploding, close enough that his eyes strain to focus on Cas.
A gloved hand holds out a five dollar bill, and Dean drops one dollar fifty into his hand as he takes the bill. “Enjoy,” he says.
Dean drives him home a few hours later with a Tupperware box of decorated cookies on Cas’ lap. The comfortable atmosphere had Dean smiling all evening, and his cheeks feel sore when he drives home again.
The greenhouse stands a little over 15 feet high, oak beams criss-crossing and framing window panes. There’s a little gravel path leading to the small off-road where he always parks, and a light blue bench sits to the left of the door. He planted a cherry tree to the right of the greenhouse; it’s still small and only reaches his hip, and he hopes to watch it grow tall and old.
"Yeah, I did.” He leaves it at that, and Cas doesn’t push him for more. They watch the sky together for a bit.
Dean jumps into the lake ass first. Sam laughs at the splash, kneeling behind Eileen and  rubbing sunscreen on her back.
"Sound good," Dean said. Cas poured a capful into the running water before placing the bottle back on the adjacent shelf.
He sat cross-legged with the blanket still around him, watching a bee buzz from flower to flower next to him, while he could hear Cas rummage around in the kitchen.
The sleeping Dean screams as if in unbearable pain, and even though he doesn’t remember this, the present Dean tenses against the waves of nausea hitting him over Cas’ description.
Dean rubs a hand over his face. “I’m really fucking sorry Cas.” Dean thinks for a moment, and he remembers something. “Has the VA been any help?”
"Yeah," Sam mumbled and sat down heavily. "I just..what happened? Did he mention anything about angel stuff that we missed?"
"I know you do," Sam replied and smiled, then he picked up his clothes again and went to the bathroom to put them on. After a minute, he came back out and lied down on the couch.
The sun beats down on his neck, and Dean grabs the rag from his back pocket and wipes the sweat from his forehead. He’s been here since sunrise, and with an ache in his back he looks at the house, and a quiet peace fills him as he sees what he created.
“You were gone,” Dean starts. “Sam said they’d bring you back, but I needed to do something. I couldn’t sit there waiting. It was—” His voice breaks, and he shakes his head, straightens his back.
“The fuck is this?” Dean murmured, grabbing a black book with dark red enochian symbols on it. He turned it over in his hands, but didn't recognize any of the symbols. He sighed, stood up and batted the dust and spiderwebs from his jeans that seemed to be permanently attached since he started looking through the room. Grabbing the book and his phone, he went to the kitchen to get a beer.
The club's walls were also just bricks but plastered with posters and stickers from small bands, to an extent that the underlying wall was barely visible anymore. To the right of the staircase was a beat down door that led to the club's bathrooms, and between the door and stage a gigantic, dark red couch was situated against the wall. When the club was crowded the couch usually didn't offer any free spots, even though it could easily seat ten people at a time, twelve if everyone was tipsy and personal space became less of an issue.
“Alright,” Dean said. He was too tired to actually have this conversation with Ben, and even though he had sobered up some in the past hour, he didn’t feel up for it.
The cake was round and two tiers, a mix of dark and milk chocolate frosting covered the mousse, strawberries, and soft fluffy cake on the inside. Ben had told Dean to go nuts, and Dean did. He had picked the best kind of every ingredient, and personally selected all the details of the decoration. There were sliced strawberries on top, arranged in a beautiful pattern that seemed to weave in and out of itself. Between them were little floofs of vanilla frosting in every shade of the rainbow. In the center it said in an elegant blue script 'Happy birthday Castiel!'. Dean absolutely loved it, and even though he winced internally at the price, Ben paid it happily and had reassured him before that it was part of the money Castiel's friends had collected.
"One of the vampires took my angel blade and attacked me," Cas says. "I have trouble healing it because of my weak grace."
He heard the shower creak and Cas' content sigh, apparently the water pressure was better than the service.
“Are you alright?” The voice sounded less gruff this time, still deep but softer, and concerned. Dean hated it.
Brain on standby as he went through the motions of changing someone's oil, he hit his head on the hood and dislocated the prop rod. He could only watch in seeming slow motion as the heavy lid fell shut and closed on his right hand. Pain exploded through his fingers, and he heard a loud clattering noise.
"I fucked up, but I didn't know what to do. So that's what I did in the end. I hope you can look past this, maybe."
"Hey," Sam called softly as he saw Cas' expression. He quickly got up and sat on the edge of the matress next to Cas, careful to put enough distance between them. When Cas' looked at him and Sam saw the tears in his eyes, he grabbed his hands and held them tightly in his own.
Ben snorted a laugh. “I was wondering when you’d be surprised about that. This is the hospital he was treated at, so he knows pretty much everyone here. Apart from that it’s generally pretty safe,” Ben said and nodded to a nearby security guard doing his rounds. “He doesn’t get triggered leaving the house alone. It’s other stuff, but the details of that he’s still kind of figuring out he said. Didn’t surprise me that he’d try and come here ASAP, though.”
He was sitting on the ground, his wrists bound behind his back and his coat lying next to him on the filthy ground of an old cabin. It was completely dark and icy wind was blowing in from between the uneven planks of the old walls. He shivered and tried to wiggle his fingers, without success.
Dean threw the third pair of pants in the floor. Every single pair he had picked up ended up looking ratty or had a surprise hole somewhere. He had one last hope, a dark wash pair he had worn to Sam's graduation.
Cas seemed unsure what to say. He turned the Kindle over in his hands, then reached into the bag and unfolded the list of favorite books of everyone he knew. He carefully placed the Kindle on the table and looked at his lap for a moment, before meeting Ben’s and then Dean’s eye.
He opened it with a creak, stepped through, and immediately closed it behind himself. He turned around and his mouth fell open.
He turns and sees the back seat covered in blood. There's vomit on the floor, dirt all over the other end. His brain tries to make sense of the amount of blood he sees, tries to make it fit into how well he's feeling and the fact that neither Sam nor Cas look seriously injured.
Dean shakes his head. “Don’t worry about it,” he says. “The others can be a lot and kinda just entertain themselves. You’re great, they’ll like you, and if not they gotta fight me about it.”
Dean’s chest loosens a bit. He didn’t realize the amount of anxiety he’d piled on since he’d come up with this idea, and hearing Sam confirm it’s a good one helps.
Dean nodded and skimmed the plan. He mostly saw the things Ben had mentioned, although one thing caught his attention.
Dean, meanwhile, tried to let go as much as possible, relaxing into the soft pillows while Cas worked him open. Hours seemed to pass before Cas grabbed the condom and leaned over Dean to kiss him slowly.
Sam opened his mouth to interrupt him, but Dean held up a hand. "Please, just let me.. this is hard Sam, okay? I can't concentrate around these dickbags because I keep thinking about what they did, and when I can't concentrate I can't do my job right. I'm scared of what will happen but I don't have it in me to just let it go or whatever. That's not me. That's never been me."
“Oh, you mean this old thing?” Dean grabs his coffee cup, a double shot espresso for his upcoming night shift in the Bunker, and he knows the sapphire sparkles in the lamp light.
"Sure Cas, coming right up," Sam winked at him and opened the door, letting the fresh morning air in. "I'll be back as soon as I can."
“I'll go and look for him then,” Dean said, threw another wink in Andrea's direction and turned around. He let his gaze roam through the room that was packed with students; the stage was empty and his friend wasn't on the couch either. Dean decided to check the bathroom and made his way over to the door. Pushing it open he nearly ran into a couple that was making out in the small room which led to the men's and women's restroom and held only a ratty loveseat and a dim and dirty lamp on the ceiling. The women both ignored him and continued to happily suck at each others faces, and Dean just shot them a curious look before entering the men's room.
Dean contemplated for about half a second if it was worth pissing this dude off, but decided against it. He set the box down gingerly, then stepped back from the door.
“Sam helped us with a problem,” Daniel makes a face, and Dean remembers the issue they had with a rogue demon trapping Daniel. “We granted him a favor, and I’m here to fulfill the debt.”
Dean does a fist pump and doesn’t even feel silly about it. Another comfortable night in with Cas. There are little butterflies in his belly, and he needs to put more effort into focusing on his work.
“Friends do that,” Dean says without hesitation. “But I’m asking because I know what PTSD looks like. Bobby’s a vet and so was my dad. I went through this with both of them. I just wanted to know if you’re okay, because it worried me.”
"JESUS FUCK!" Dean yelped as he was startled by the greeting. He lost his balance and fell down on the floor. "Thanks for the warning Cas. Real smooth."
Dean scratched a particularly nasty mosquito bite (a perk of spending so much time in Cas's garden) and waited for the porch door to open. He felt practically giddy with excitement to see Cas again; last week, Ben had taken to delivering Cas's box since he had to talk to him, and Dean hadn’t had any time for a visit since then.
“I trust you too.” Dean licked melted butter from his lips after the last bite of steak. He drained the glass of juice and pushed everything to the side.
“Hey, Cas,” he said and showed him a spoon with different kinds of fruits on it. “Look, they’re all cut to be heart shaped!”
The next day was filled with phone calls and emails and more phone calls. Cas called Ben to get some information on clinics, therapists, detox processes while Dean and Sam wrote down the details for their Christmas visit. After many hours they had everything together; there was a rehab center about thirty minutes away that helped patients with drug addictions, including alcohol, to detox safely and under medical supervision. They offered an in-patient program as well as an extensive support system after the program ended. Ben said he’d help them with anything they needed, and also told Dean about the AA meetings that took place in one of the rooms of the VSI held. All in all, Dean felt slightly overwhelmed by the things that needed to be done, but grateful for the immense support his family and friends were showing him.
Dean raised his eyebrows at that. Gabriel could be obnoxious, but he usually never yelled and preferred to fight his battles with annoying passive- aggressive behavior. The two of them had been friends ever since Gabe became the co- owner of the bar and moved into the old house above it, which had been used for storage before that. No one had ever seen the original owner, but rumor had it that his name was Lucifer and no one who valued their safety should mess with him.
Dean nudges him gently. “I’m here for any talks you want to have, whether it's feelings, dicks, cars or plants, though I know absolutely nothing about plants.”
“I thought your grace wasn’t strong enough to heal?” Sam looks between Cas’ furrowed brows and Dean.
"Thank you," Cas said and Dean nudged his nose against his. "I can't believe... Dean, are you sure? I know I didn't tell you anything, but-"
Dean feels his grin fade slowly, and the picture in his head morphs. It’s just him and Cas, slow-dancing, socked feet on the hardwood floor.
Cas waves back, and a gentle smile spreads over his face. They’re 20 feet from each other and waving like idiots, but Dean’s just happy to see him. Cas slowly walks up to him, and Dean remembers he’s still wearing the Santa hat.
Twenty-two minutes later, they pulled up in front of Cas's house. "Here we are," the driver said. "Have a good night."
"Not really. I presume that we were given false information. I am gonna start to head home tomorrow though, as I see no point in continuing my search here. Crowley isn't the best company either."
"No, no thanks," Dean sighed. His eyes burned because in all honesty, he would love nothing more than to be with Cas right now. He didn't want him to spend money on Dean’s sorry ass, though. "'s like a thirty minute drive from me to you. Very not cheap," Dean said and popped the ‘p’.
They get each other rings a few weeks later. A small Etsy shop owner listens to their wishes for details on the phone for over an hour, and they send in photos of Enochian letters.
“Yes,” Castiel says. “Please. Could I also get uhm,” he peers around Dean, “something to eat? I’m not sure what you have this early.”
Cas reaches out to him, his hand hovering palm up and his eyes so gentle Dean wants to curl up in the warm look he’s being given. He takes Cas’s hand, grabs it firmly and lets himself be pulled up.
“So, does your garden look like your front yard?” Dean chewed on the half-melted Snickers he’d found in his jeans pocket. The patio was warm through his pants, hot from the morning sun that had now wandered and was blocked by the roof. He had come to Cas’s straight from work, starved from missing breakfast and eight hours of physical labor. If you had no money for groceries, breakfast wasn't on the schedule.
He walks into the ER that’s busy as always, and he feels monumentally stupid with his hat. He walks up to the reception desk and waits until the woman behind it has finished her phone call. She seems stressed.
He zoned out during the most of the announcements, fiddling with the hole in his jeans or fingering the table's scuffed corner.
He stood with his back to Dean, clad in jeans and a teal shirt that stretched over tense back muscles. His hands were balled to fists at his sides, his head lowered slightly.
“Yeah, like, get sober, check. Start jogging, maybe. Sleep more, not with you looking like that. You know, healthy stuff.”
Time seemed syrupy-thick, the hands of the clock on the wall creeping along slowly. Dean stared at it, shaking his head a little every time his eyes started to become unfocused. He really wanted to talk to Cas, see what he was up to. Today’s picture was Hannah sleeping on the porch, Cas’s hand visible in the picture as he was stroking her back. Dean had ached so much looking at it he forgot how to breathe for a moment. He contemplated how much work it would be to go to the bedroom to fetch his phone from the nightstand, then decided it was worth the effort. He got up slowly, winced as he put too much pressure on his hurt hand, and rounded the couch towards the ajar bedroom door. He steadied himself by touching the sofa and wall as he went, but miscalculated grossly when stepping over a stray dirty plate on the bedroom floor. His knee did a weird thing. He stepped
"Enough!" Cas slammed the book he had been reading in shut and stood up. "Both of you have a point, but both of you fail to see the others. You continuously fail to communicate about the most important things and this has been your issue since the day that I first met you." Both hunters looked at him, surprised.
He knocked twice. "Hey bud, you wanna watch sense8? Charlie told me it's great and I feel like watching something right now. I can make us some popcorn if you want?" After a few seconds of silence, Dean frowned and knocked again.
There are things in this chapter that are not tagged (there are NO untagged archive warnings in this fic), if things regarding to referenced homophobia (no slurs) are an issue for you, skip to the bottom to find  more info there. :)
"'Our'? You livin' with a pretty lady then?" She smiled while tapping in the code for the couch delivery.
He shook his head and looked away from Cas. "I know I told you some stuff, but I don't want to talk about him. It took me a long fucking time to accept that there's nothing wrong with me, and I don't want to think of him right now. I'm sorry."
None of them said anything for a few minutes but resumed looking at the sky or around the clearing, neither commenting on the fact that Dean's hand was still lying on Cas' arm.
They’re on their way out of the café, Dean holding the door for Cas, when they hear a gasp. They stop and turn, and Charlie stands a few feet from them.
The limited edition Star Wars ornaments had been hard as fuck to find, and expensive, and they took a month to arrive, but they were finally here.
Family. Dean sighed. He didn't look forward to facing Sam's bitchface about his sudden departure the night before, nor did he want to discuss anything related to his mother or the British Men of Letter. He starts typing a reply to Cas.
The soft sounds of their kissing join the whisper of the wind in the trees outside, and after a while Dean takes Cas’ hand and guides it between his legs. Cas grabs his cock, but Dean shakes his head, pries his fingers off and guides him further.
Dean looked at him and couldn't help the surge of protectiveness, right behind his sadness over what had happened to Cas. He found himself studying Cas's face, in awe of how far this man had come, what obstacles he had faced and how truly amazing he was. Dean felt privileged to have Cas trust him like this, and he swore in that moment to never let him down.
"You'll have a job here when you come back, but this won't work right now. I'm sorry. Do you want me to drive you home? Or to the hospital because of your hand? I really think you should see a doctor for this."
"Okay, now dip your head back to wash it out," Dean instructed him and Cas immediately reached out and grasped at his arm, scared to fall over. He leaned back into the water and let the shampoo rinse out.
A step further and he saw the pillows. At least a dozen spread out, different shades and shapes and sizes, converting the unforgiving wood into a sea of softness. Two plaid blankets were folded up next to the door, set behind an expensive looking laptop.
In the same moment Sam wanted to suggest sleeping a little, his phone buzzed with a text message and a tiny blue light popped up on the table's map. Dean jumped up immediately to look at the exact location and Sam took out his phone and checked the new message.
They turn on the TV, let it run in the background and they make fun of whatever’s on, talking to each other in between. Cas has his socked feet folded under him, sitting slightly turned towards Dean. There’s tomato sauce on Dean’s henley, Cas
He gets the money counted perfectly, and he watches the man to see if he spots the festive design on the milk foam.
Sam was almost done rinsing off the cutting board and knifes, while Cas threw away the empty packages and then went to find plates and cutlery for the three of them. As he set down the third plate, Sam dried his hands on a dishtowel and threw it over his shoulder.
Dean put his beer down by the door and checked the lightswitch, since most of the lightbulbs didn't really work anymore. He had stopped working on the room and had never replaced it after it became clear that Charlie wouldn't be visiting. After a few clicks, nothing happened. A trip to home depot it is then, restocking on some lightbulbs. He could also check out some of the furniture the shop right next to it had, maybe look for some decoration to make Cas' room more inviting. He grabbed his phone and shot a message to Cas, asking when he would be home while walking to the garage. He wanted this to be a surprise for him. He didn't even have time to put his phone back in his pocket when it buzzed with Cas' replies.
"I'm sorry for not wanting to do it sooner. I just didn't want to spend our first night after a date together being all—" He gestured around as he was looking for words. "All... Sad?"
They clean up and walk upstairs together. Dean starts brushing his teeth as Cas undresses and walks into their shower. He turns on the rainfall shower setting, and turns on the hot water. Dean stares unabashedly.
was lying to his feet, tumbled down from a laundry basket that had gone untouched for months. In that moment it occurred to him why he hadn't tried harder to keep their plans, to change Sam's mind, to find a solution. Dean was missing him so much it hurt him physically.
"They started hitting me. I tried to defend myself but I couldn't. When I broke one of their noses, they got very angry. They had empty beer bottles, and before I could do anything they hit me on the head with one."
"I'm happy for y’all. I think you're great together, and Cas even mentioned coming to one of the group sessions again someday. He never used to do that before..well, before you."
"I like that stuff Cas. Ain't gonna grow old enough to die from cholesterol anyways. Not in this line of work anyways", he replied, taking out two plates and placing them on the table.
of the car’s blinker interrupting Dean’s thoughts over and over until he gave up on forming anything coherent in his head.
“Thank you,” Cas says, and he seems a bit surprised. He takes a big bite of his muffin, and there's a little crumb on his lower lip. Cas’ tongue darts out to take it away, and Dean’s eyes snap to the small movement. “I work in the geriatrics ward, and I take work home with me most days. It’s difficult.”
Somehow Cas sneaked his hand towards Dean's lower stomach, which Dean only noticed because Cas had pulled back.
"Yes," Cas said. "We'll find you a therapist—" Dean winced, "and a good physician, and we'll get you to a better and healthier place. I promise. I will be there with you, as long as you want me."
Cas hummed in reply, and Dean heaved him upwards. Cas' feet came to stand somewhat safely on the slippery floor of the tub and he clung to Dean's shoulders for extra safety.
“You want to tell us, or are you gonna bore us to death instead?” Dean is tense, combing his brain for stray lore on why and how this Djinn is different.
“Figures,” Dean says and laughs at Cas’ unsure expression. “I only have it because Sam loves it. You guys need to meet.”
"Shit." Sam sighed and rubbed his eyes. Looking defeated, he shouldered his duffel bag. He gave Cas a sad smile, then turned and walked out of the library. Cas watched him leave, then he picked up his book and walked to his room.
and the strong smell of antiseptic drowned Dean’s senses. He hated doctors, hospitals, anything that fell into these categories.
After some shuffling Cas lay down next to him, and Dean turned to the side fully to look at him instead of the stars. Cas's long dark lashes skimmed his eyebrows. Their afternoon would only deepen Cas's golden tan, and maybe give Dean a couple more freckles.
“Water would be great,” Cas says, and Dean gestures for him to sit on one of the barstools at the counter.
“Well, Dean, we’re just going to clean the wound, stitch it back up and do the same with your foot. Stellar job on that, by the way, injuries there are quite annoying when healing. Prepare for a lot of itching.” The doctor closed the tablet’s cover and nodded at Dean. “Nurse Alex will come by in a few minutes to do the sutures. Alex will administer a local anesthetic for it, so don’t worry about pain or anything.”
Together they watched a documentary about white sharks, while Cas occasionally made remarks about the evolutional history of different kinds of fish, and waited for Dean to come back.
“-although you probably want to try out one of these nerdy clubs here. Can’t believe you’re going to my uni now, little bro! Gotta get you some new clothes too, got some spare money I can give you so you look a little less like the snot nosed ubernerd that you secretly are.”
“I sincerely hope you don't know what it feels like. Please believe me when I tell you that it's not out of spite or being silly. There are only two people that really know, please don't take it personally.” Dean noticed his hand fumbling with a loose thread of his pants.
“We need to discuss details for your wedding as long as I can fit into a regular dress,” Eileen says and she takes a sip of her water. “And sorry Cas for rescheduling again.”
"Good morning Sam. How has your hunt been?" Cas asked while not so subtly looking at Dean's face. The older hunter just stared at his computer screen.
Cas grimaced. He had to swallow before he could voice the next part.  "As I said, I was trained to kill you. They forced me to actually kill you, copies of you, tens and then hundreds and then thousands, warehouses full of you and I had to kill you every single time. Different weapons, different scenarios."
The story from the small green novel ended horribly and sadly, yet Cas had read it countless times already and kept it hidden under a couch pillow at all times, afraid to misplace it. He was clear about his own feelings; he knew what he wanted but he also knew the impossibility of his feelings being reciprocated, not to mention that stories of angels and humans never ended well.
The man nods to the right. “He was called into a patient’s room a few minutes ago. I know he hasn't taken his break yet. You can wait here.”
Cas looked around the cabin, seeing nothing but a few broken pieces of furniture lying around. Squinting, he could make out the small wooden door of the cabin at the end of the room. It was closed and the few windows were so dirty that barely any moonlight came in.
Dean successfully created their makeshift back rest and plopped down next to Cas. The laptop showed the DVD menu for Star Wars, and a huge smile snuck onto his face.
Cas looks at him briefly before his expression changes. “Wait,” he says. “What does that mean regarding my soul?”
“Let’s get you out of this coat,” Dean says, and slowly stands up. His knee pops and he grimaces. He holds a hand out to Cas and wiggles his fingers. “You’re all wet. You’re gonna get cold and then sick.”
"Alright then," Ben said and got up. "Is it fine if I leave you two? I have a crap ton of stuff to do tomorrow, and if you don't need me I'd like to go home. Also because my wife will murder me otherwise." He winked at Dean.
Cas almost drops his coffee. He saves it and looks at Dean, all soft and open. Dean grins. He gets up and pushes his chair back.
Dean’s hands tightened in his lap. He tried to not let his face betray what he was feeling, didn’t want to make this any harder for Cas than it already must be.
Eleven dollars and fourteen cents. That's what Dean had left after having to repair his toilet. The old pipes just didn't hold up anymore and even though he DIY'd as much as he could, he still had to pay someone to help him.
Cas nods and writes his number down on a napkin, adding his name and a little bee next to it, and Dean feels warm.
“It's so beautiful.” Dean let his eyes roam over the garden. There was an old tree in the back left corner, and the sides and back were protected by the tall hedge.
“Though it took many tries, I’m finally certain you will complete your task. Dean Winchester must die, and you will be the one to execute it.” Her voice is cruel, cold and sharp. The Cas squatting next to her raises to full height and nods briefly.
The sparkler eventually burns his fingers and he drops it, winds his arms around Cas’ waist.The hand on Dean’s cheek moves to his neck, tugs him closer.
"You're pretty hot too," Dean said and Cas’s expression shifted to one of surprise, then to a smile. The scar pulled at his lip a little, making it a bit lopsided but Dean loved it anyways.
“I’d like to meet him,” Cas says as Dean hands him the lemonade. “You speak so highly of him, he must be great.”
Dean stretches as they get out of the car. He feels strangely good, there's a warmth in him and his muscles feel relaxed as if someone had just massaged them. Sam and Cas both eye him, but look away when he meets their eyes. The third time it happens, he’s had enough.
As Dean closes the laptop with a heavy sigh, his stomach rumbles. He decides on a BLT and gets excited to bust out the fancy sauces Sam had gotten him for Christmas. While the bacon fries he uses his favorite knife and slices the tomato, and carefully puts everything together once it’s done. Leaning against the island counter he takes a big bite and sighs. The rich and smoky flavors wash over his tongue in a wave of caramelized onions and garlic, and he hums contentedly as he chews.
Cas shakes his head. “Maybe a few bruises,” he says, and his voice quivers a bit. “Nothing serious.”
Sam opened the bathroom door and looked at Dean, dripping wet and in his boxers, holding a half conscious Cas.
When he opened his eyes, Cas was looking at him with pride. He leaned over and kissed him, before suddenly thinking of something he had wanted to talk to Cas about for a while.
It ends up being almost six when the door opens and Cas stumbles in. His cheeks are pink, his hair peeking out from under his hat and he looks chaotically cute.
“Are these your drawings?” Castiel asked and couldn’t help but touch the yellow paper. The feathers looked so real he
There’s honest confusion in Cas’ eyes. “With you?” He looks down at the paper, reads everything again and takes another look at the pictures. Dean tries to remember to breathe as he waits for a reply. When he looks up at Dean again there’s warmth and happiness in his face. “Really?”
"What's your favorite one?" Dean asked, looking at Cas' face from the side. Cas turned his head and looked at him, then looked away again, his eyes quickly scanning the sky. "This one," the angel said after a second and pointed to the far right, "it doesn't exist in human constellation books, I found it myself. It looks like a flower to me."
He accepts Dean’s hand, and his fingers are warm and dry as they slide into Dean’s palm. Cas steps towards him, and Dean breathes him in.
“Nah, I’m good. Uhm, I’m honestly not sure where to even start, man. Everything’s just kinda fucked.” Dean rubbed a hand over his face and let his head fall backwards, letting it hit the door with a thump.
Zep IV accompanies them on the first part of the drive, and when Dean gets hungry, he swaps with Sam to eat cheap cherry pie from a gas station. Cas is in the back, using Sam's laptop to read about God knows what, and it feels soft. It's content, it's familiar, and Dean aches with the pleasant weight it creates inside of him.
After a truly immeasurable amount of time, he heard noises at his apartment door. Scraping? No, some kind of clattering? He spent time deciding on the perfect word and discarded each one, before settling on rummaging. Perfect.
Cas set an agonizingly slow rhythm, but with a depth that had Dean desperate for more every time he disappeared a little. Dean met Cas for every thrust and buried his hands in Cas’s soft hair, where he was making small noises against Dean’s throat. Cas sped up slowly, and Dean didn’t try to hold back his breaths and groans at it, quickly feeling his orgasm approach. As if reading his thoughts, Cas lifted his head and brushed his lips against Dean’s.
Dean thought about it for a second. A discount could come in handy, especially considering how much stuff he still needed. "Sure. And yeah, I'm remodeling some rooms in our..house" If she noticed his slight hesitation, she didn't show it. Accidentally telling the cashier that he was living in a huge mystic bunker maybe wasn't the best idea.
Dean woke to sunlight warming his back, a painful wrist, and a fuzzy feeling in his mouth. Within a few seconds the pounding in his head tore him out of the last remnants of sleepiness, and his stomach felt cramped.
Throwing his wallet and phone on the passengers side of the front seat, Dean slipped behind the wheel and drove out of the garage. It was a nice autumn day, fresh air right after it had rained for days, colorful leaves scattered over the roads. He rolled down his window a little and turned on the radio. To the home depot, accompanied with some good old Zep. Yesterday a badass hunter, today a housewife remodeling the bedroom. Well, anything for Cas, right?
Dean crammed the rest of the cookie in his mouth and toed off his boots and socks. Cas was right as always, the grass felt smooth and cool under his heated feet, and he wiggled his toes. He leaned back until his head was cushioned by the small mountain of pillows. The sky had turned a darker blue, edges of pink still visible at the horizon. The sparse buildings didn't produce enough light to drown out the sky, and Dean looked at the stars.
“Cas? Are you there?” Dean's voice sounded as wrecked as he felt, and he forced himself to cough a couple of times. “Cas?”
Cas laughed softly. “I assure you, my skills are limited. I had to practice a lot to be able to cook in a manner that wouldn't burn everything. It was a challenge,” he said while Dean started laughing.
A dark wooden fence wound around the front, meeting the hedge at the sides. Everything looked well loved and cared for, undoubtedly the work of a devoted gardener. Dean opened the little gate holding a light blue mailbox on one of its posts, stepped through and readjusted the box under his left arm. He carefully made his way across the yard, up the stairs and knocked on the heavy oak door. As he waited for a reply, he noticed more flowers: carefully trimmed roses sitting in huge pots all around the patio. The door had a smaller, well-concealed frame at its bottom, and Dean guessed it to be a cat flap.
Dean did a double take looking at that message. Surely Cas meant the comfort of the bunker, his home, right? Or being reunited with him and Sam? Before he could reply to him, a second text came in.
Apart from the weekly visit with boxed goods, Dean was at Cas's house almost every day. If it wasn't dinner, they'd work in the garden together, watch movies or just keep each other company while reading or sorting through emails. Dean loved spending his time with Cas, but slowly the fear of imposing crept in on him. What if Cas was just too polite to send him away every once in a while? Did
Dean enjoyed the hot water running over his back, relaxing for a moment before grabbing the small bottle of lube he had brought in the bathroom with him. He wanted to surprise Cas with some Grade A romantic birthday sex, and so he was taking the necessary precautions. He prepped himself quickly and without much teasing, not wanting to rile himself up too much.
"So, uh, about, you know, today. I uhm." Dean scratched his neck and had no idea how to actually do what Cas had suggested. Sam had put his pen down and leaned back in his chair, giving his brother his full attention.
"Never apologize for telling me things about yourself. Thank you for trusting me with all of it." Cas paused with his hand at the nape of Dean's neck when Dean let out a sob. He buried his face deeper into Cas's shoulder, smelling laundry detergent and soap and the warm, comforting scent of Cas’s skin.
Cas takes off his wet and snowy boots, and Dean takes note of the jeans he’s wearing today. He offers to take Cas' coat, and tries not to stare--he's never seen Cas without scrubs
Cas is so close; Dean feels the warmth radiating from his neck and face. When Cas looks at his own feet for a moment their temples bump, and they slow their movements before keeping their heads together.
He came to stand a few feet behind Dean, who was still sitting on the ground and staring at the stars. The night sky was astonishing; there was a complete lack of light from the ground and it was clear of clouds, the countless stars visible, blinking and shining, forming constellations all over the black of the night.
“I was thinking,” Cas says. “I want to be. Trained, I mean, for this kind of thing. We both know plenty of combat and lore to help hunters, but we’re missing the scientific knowledge on dealing with the mental health side of hunting. I want to take care of that.”
"You could've just yelled, Cas. Could've helped you." Dean studied his friend's face while Cas was taking a careful sip of his drink. "What are you drinking?" Dean leaned over and sniffed at the cup, then raised his eyebrows.
He feels weird knowing Castiel’s name but not vice versa, so he introduces himself finally. “I’m Dean by the way,” he says.
Cas just pulled him back in for a moment, then nudging him around until he was able to close the front door. He took Dean's hand and led him upstairs and into the bedroom’s en suite. A litany of candles flickered on the bathroom counters. Cas walked to the claw-footed tub in the center of the room and turned on the faucets.
“This is for you.” Dean nervously watched Cas’s fingers wrap around it. The carton was a nondescript light brown, and Cas opened it.
Cas mumbles into his shoulder. “I figured I’d just cherish every moment we have until—” he stops talking and Dean’s eyes water.
A dinner with Sam and Eileen happens a few days after the rings arrive (which fit perfectly of course, since Cas had insisted on getting measured multiple times). Dean makes a show of giving Sam the salad bowl, who stays oblivious until Eileen starts laughing.
He closed the distance between them in two large strides, cradled Cas's face in his hands, and after giving him a moment to pull away, finally kissed him.
Cas then continued with his mission, paying a bit more attention to a nipple here, teasing breaths over the tip of Dean’s cock there. Cas settled down on his knees between Dean’s legs, nudging them apart slightly more before stroking him a few times again. He moved his hand further down slowly, caressing his balls before stroking over his perineum and then snapping his head up so quickly that Dean was concerned for a moment.
"Dean, you're going to ACTUALLY kill us with this," Sam said after inspecting the calories on the "Ready-to-go"- alfredo package, but Dean just chuckled.
He shook his head. "Not gonna happen. But I'm not going to make you kiss me if you're not ready yet. It's okay," he stressed and pulled Cas in for a closer hug.
"I can't tell you how glad I am you're saying this," Cas said. "I was ready to let you go, and it would have been torture, but... Here you are."
"I don't have anything specific in mind. I usually order in and read, or watch something. Could you help me for a moment? I need to trim the hedge but the flower beds need tending to. There's a lot of weeds starting to grow between them." He stepped around Dean to the patio and grabbed a big pair of garden shears.
Cas looks at him disapprovingly, most likely for the sarcastic tone, before nudging him into the bathroom. Dean sits on the toilet lid while Cas flips on every light in the bathroom, and they stare at each other for a second in the harsh halogen light.
“I know.” Ben sighed and pulled into the brightly lit hospital parking lot. He turned the car off, but didn’t make a move to get out.
The drive to Cas’ is short and quiet. At a stoplight Dean looks at him. The lighting makes his nose look sharper, the fullness of his lips seems more pronounced. He wishes he could stare at him all the time.
“Order for Hannah?” The barista called out a few minutes later. Castiel got their order and walked over to their table.
“Oh geez, way lower. Three.” Charlie and Cas both looked a little surprised. Charlie expected more and Cas expected less.
“Sam it’s alright that you’re curious, I’m not offended. Dean apparently lives next door to my friend, they’re acquaintances. She offered to Dean to watch tv with us. We both stayed the night there.” Castiel explained calmly.
“Well whatever. Now, are you ready?” Dean had found the remote and was curled up in a blanket. He was sitting up in anticipation, he loves this movie and was excited to show it to Cas.
About an hour later Castiel is long finished with his lunch but still sipping on his coffee so the cafe won’t make them leave. Hannah and him haven’t had many conversations while working, but they everyone once in a while will ask each other questions.
Maybe he thought it would be the same as speaking aloud while alone. Like the darkness of the room would eat up his words like they did most nights when Dean talked to himself.
Sam had never seen Castiel smile like that. If he didn’t know better he’d say he was... blushing? And Dean called him Cas?? Sam would definitely ask Dean about that later.
“Wait wait wait, Cas you’ve smoked?” Dean laughed for a minute straight. Charlie and Cas just looked at each other amused.
His current apartment didn’t smell like much when he moved in. Though since he’s been here it just smells like him. His clothes, his shampoo, his deodorant, him. He hoped it wasn’t a bad smell. He hadn’t ever gotten complaints.
Once they’re out of the building and into the fresh air she takes in an over the top deep breath. Sam grins at her theatrics, and she starts swinging their hands between them. He mostly just lets her drag his hand but he contributes a little.
He’s shaking his head at that weird interaction as he walks back to his friends. College students are weird.
“Uh, sorry to interrupt. I don’t think we’ve met.” Dean started, moving around Hannah to stand next to Castiel, very close next to him.
“I have friends! I just don’t know them all that well...” Sam trailed off, he was now realizing that Castile was probably hearing all of this. That’s embarrassing.
“It’s just, well, um.” Sam stumbled through his thoughts, now and embarrassed to say any of this in front of Castiel. He was friends with him sure, but he’d never talked about girls before. Neither of them had brought any back here, or even discussed what they would do if the other wanted to.
Castiel was confused, he thought the drinking was the fun part. He tilted his head to the side in confusion.
He and Sam had left the previous day, it was kind of a blur for him. His dad had left town a few days before, to go on a bender most likely. The fight between the three of them was still haunting Dean, and he had that nice faint bruise on his face to remind him.
Right? Neither of them thought of each other that way? He was almost certain of it. But why only almost? He laid down in his bed, staring at the ceiling.
He walks into his room, the lights are all out but he knows his way around. He glances down at the shirt. It’s one of his favorites. Why had he let Cas borrow this one? It was the closest one to him last night, his brain tries to rationalize. But it wasn’t really. He could’ve grabbed anything but he went into his drawer and chose this one. It wasn’t buried or anything, but He could’ve picked the one next to it, a Pink Floyd shirt. He didn’t care about that one as much.
“Alright, well I gotta get back to work. Are you coming by later today?” Dean asks, referring to Charlie’s place.
With a sigh he stands and starts cleaning up. Throwing away garbage and recycling old beer bottles and cans. He just closes the door to his room, he doesn’t have the time or energy to clean any of that.
“I’m Dean, Sam’s older brother.” Dean moved Sam to shake the new guy’s hand. Dean noticed the sincerity in his handshake, a firm but not rough shake. He also noticed the curiosity in the man’s eyes. The bright blue eyes, he noted, that were staring right into his.
His family was pretty... weird. There was his eldest brother Michael, who was pretty controlling. And his younger sister Anna, she was kind of obsessed with religion, more so from an artist perspective though.
He debated texting Dean. He is his usual go to whenever he’s confused. But he needs to move away from that now. Not that he was supposed to completely stop all communication with Dean, but maybe lean away from completely depending on him. That’ll take a while though.
“Uh hey man, are you Castiel?” Sam asked excitedly. Dean could see his brother’s smile and could practically feel the excited energy coming from him. To be honest, it kind of bummed him out.
He was happy to be friends with Dean. He almost never was friends with men, but Dean was kind, protective, funny, and kind of gave him a hard time. He had this weird obsession with cowboys and old westerns, which Castiel almost adored about him. He loved food, especially pie. Castiel could listen to him talk about whatever for as long as Dean wanted.
“Hey Charles, what’s cracking?” Dean said as he entered Charlie’s apartment. She had yelled for him to enter, she was in the other room.
“So you like her?” Dean asks, giving him a knowing look. Dean was always so annoying about these sorts of things.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m just distracted, not your fault.” He could feel himself flushing, he usually would avert his eyes to keep from embarrassing himself further. But he thought he might as well take her in as much as he could.
“Well, if you ever are feeling lonely without your weird roommate, text me. Most likely, I will also be away from my weird roommate.” She stops walking and smiles. Sam smiles as, they exchange phone numbers and she goes into her dorm building.
“You can tell me anything, you know that right?” Sam offered. Dean plastered on a smile and leaned back in his chair, picking up a pen again.
The quietness of the night outside soothed Cas to peace, though his heart rate wasn’t close to resting.
“Don’t worry about it.” Dean says. They watch a couple episodes together, talking during it cause they’ve all seen it before.
“And I had a one time hook up with a woman named April, it was a while ago.” He remembers April almost fondly. It was his first time with anyone, and he was incredible nervous. He was eighteen at the time, which he’s aware is considered late nowadays, but he grew up sheltered. April was nice and they had a good time, but she kind of kicked him out the next morning, rudely.
When Castiel walked in, he saw she was watching Princess Bride. She and Gilda would watch that at least every month. They could both quote the entire movie. This meant she was just letting herself drown in her own sadness.
“No, just got distracted.” He told her, she smiled and picked out her own drink. While she wasn’t looking Castiel made big eyes at Dean that read ‘save me!’. Dean nodded like he understood.
“Um, hello?” Sam and Dean turned towards the deep, rough voice that came from the door of the dorm. In the door stood an awkward, shorter, and dark haired man. He was wearing a button down tucked into slacks, and had a weird tan coat on over it. He had one roller suitcase and one big duffle bag thrown over his shoulder.
“My roommate is pretty cool. He’s quiet, and mostly hangs out with his other friends.” Jessica nods.
“You’ve been spending time with me for eighteen years, you need to make new friends.” Dean was always trying to get Sam to make friends, he was such a mom that way. Well, Sam thought that’s how a mom would act, based off tv shows.
He’d been a steady drinker since he was sixteen. He and some shit to figure out but he didn’t want to, so he drank. He’s since then developed a strong tolerance, he almost never gets drunk unless it’s on purpose.
“It’s very interesting. But I won’t bore you with the details.” Castiel says before finishing his paragraph.
“I went to a party in junior year and got so high I slept with a girl that was super homophobic towards me in previous years. She came out a month later.” She laughed to herself. Dean laughed along.
The lot of them were all pretty homophobic, so Castiel was almost estranged from the majority of his family. He kept in contact with Anna obviously, and occasionally got a call from Gabriel. His cousin Balthazar had moved to Britain, but he got a text from time to time.
“I’m offended you think I would do anything creepy, I respect women dude!” Dean defended himself. Sam scoffs and says his goodbyes.
He didn’t finish high school, but he was pretty good with cars so he was confident he could find a job as a mechanic somewhere close to Sam’s university. He worked briefly as a mechanics assistant for his Uncle Bobby while Sam was finishing up high school. How hard could it be to find a job and a place to live close to Sam?
This was his own victory, his own body that he owned and loved. And he wasn’t going to let anyone tell him how to live his life anymore.
“Oh geez, give me a second to count.” He proceeds to mouth names that Cas can’t read. “I believe it’s in the thirties, but I can’t pinpoint an exact number.” Charlie whistles in amazement.
“I guess we’ll see then.” Dean locks eyes with Cas, neither look away. Charlie has to start the show herself.
He shakes his head of these thoughts and walks into his living room. Cas is sitting on the couch with his coat slung over the arm rest, and he’s still wearing his shoes.
Castiel walked home the next morning. It was a bit chilly at eight am, but he found it refreshing. The night was warm and comforting, a stark contrast to the now windy and bright morning.
“He signed up for the army actually. We broke up for several reasons but that was the main one.” He nodded and so did Dean. Charlie gave him a supportive smile and Cas thought it was time to move on.
“You don’t have any friends to get an apartment with?” Dean asked bluntly. Sam put his head in his hands, but Castiel just laughed.
Castiel couldn’t stop thinking about his family as he walked to his friend’s apartment. It was pretty shitty, but she had moved in there with her girlfriend Gilda at the beginning of the year.
“Yep, just gotta jot a few things down before I head out.” Dean figures he can do the rest tomorrow, it’s already been a long day.
Dean sighs and throws his phone back onto his couch. He had put on an acdc shirt and pajama pants after his shower, so at least he was comfortable. And not smelling of grease anymore. That’s always a plus.
“I’d include more about the how that point connects to your thesis, but that could be done in a sentence or two. Besides that it’s wonderfully worded.” He says before handing it back. They often would read through each other’s work before turning anything in.
He slipped the shirt back on and entered the living room. It was almost completely engulfed in darkness. Cas had been there a million times but in his less than perfect state of mind, he stumbled around quite a bit. Running into tables and walls.
“Heh, yeah. I think his parents were super religious or something? So like, an Angel name? Not sure.”
He couldn’t help but smile as he saw the man he had only met once. He was wearing a buttoned up red flannel and jeans. He had an empty beer in his hand, and slowly put it in the recycling bag.
“Hi, I’m Ruby.” The friend says, she seems surprised that Meg doesn’t do it for her. She holds out a hand for Sam to shake and he doesn’t hesitate to take it.
“Nothing, just uh, can you come over?” Sam sounded fine, but the way he was talking was weird to Dean.
“My friends are all living with their significant others, I’d only be a third wheel I’m afraid.” Dean seemed to accept this answer and let Castiel finish his packing with out any more questions.
“Yes, let’s get to studying. The portfolio is due in what? Three days?” He asked her as they started walking towards their favorite coffee shop.
“Sorry, yes I am ready for this western film that you love.” Cas amends his previous statement and Dean gives him a satisfied smile.
“That would take a while Dean, maybe when we have more time.” Dean smiles and nods. He finishes up his lunch quickly, he’s always been a fast eater.
“How long have you guys been together?” Hannah asks him. Cas forgot for just a moment that they were supposed to be dating.
“His brother asked him over to our room today to ask for girl advice. Okay? He’s an expert on women or something. He strikes me as the sort of person who sleeps around a lot. Which is fine, but he sleeps with women, not men!”
“Okay, here’s the name of the game. We drink anytime Angel makes a bad decision, anytime we’re annoyed by Darla, whenever our favorite character says something stupid, If Cordelia gets a vision, and if the bad guy of the episode is a vampire.” Dean rattles off.
“You’re at a college party? Sam said you didn’t go here?” Castiel asked him, trying not to sound rude.
“No problem Cas.” His smile got bigger as he patted Castiel on the back. Castiel tilted his head and squinted his eyes. No one had ever called him that.
Dean just chuckled softly, and said “Aw Sammy’s growing up.” Sam was so tempted to punch his brother.
“What’s your body count?” She asked him. Cas was fairly certain she knew, but it seemed only fair since she had asked Dean the same. Though Cas and Dean had wildly different answers.
“Yes, but it is your home.” Dean liked the way he phrased that. Dean usually just called it his apartment. So did Sam and Charlie. But Cas calls it his home. It’s nice.
Dean is working on the last bit of a repair before he heads on home. It’s about six right now, he’s working a little overtime today. The boss won’t care though, he hardly notices the workers.
“Not too bad, worse than usual though.” He explained. Dean laughed, then couldn’t stop laughing. This led to Charlie giggling her ass off, which led to Cas chuckling.
A well of fury built up in Castiel’s chest when he thought of it. Really about any parent hurting their children, but he’s never known a child of abuse like that. Dean and Sam are such amazing men and the idea of someone hurting them made Castiel’s blood boil.
He has a whole shelf dedicated to cowboy movies. He had been obsessed with them since he was a kid. The adventure and the cheesiness of them was priceless. Where else was he supposed to watch two guys have a shoot out in a quite ghost town, with the entire town watching on.
He was walking back to his apartment after work on another boring Tuesday. He got in the elevator, and held the door when he saw a red headed woman trying to catch up. She nodded and thanked him when she got in herself.
“Sounds fun. I’m Meg, by the way.” She puts out her hand for him to shake. Sam looks at it quickly, then back to the Professor.
“Whoa Cas! I’ve never heard you laugh like that!” Dean exclaims, his eyes wide and bright. Cas just shrugs. He supposes he doesn’t laugh that much, but he never took note of it.
“Yeah it probably is. I’m going to get a drink, would you like anything?” He quickly changed the topic. She didn’t seem to notice his discomfort and nodded. He waded through the many bodies and arrived in the messy kitchen. Solo cups littered the floor and countertops.
“You ever been with a guy?” Dean lifts his eyebrows in surprise. Charlie shrugs. Dean looks at both of them individually as if to see if he could trust them.
“Good Morning Sam,” he greeted as he walked in. Sam barely looked up, he was getting his books and laptop into his bag. His class was in about fifteen minutes, he was already late. Sam waved quickly, but then did a double take as he noticed Cas.
As soon as he got into his apartment he took a shower. He washed off all the car oil at the shop but he could still feel it all over him.
Once everyone else arrives they start their class work almost immediately. Jess starts quizzing the rest of the group on some terms that’ll be on the upcoming test. Sam sits that out in favor of rereading the most recent chapter.
“Three months.” He spit out with no thought. He’d known Dean for about two months, so he could stretch another month in there.
“I actually went to a cafe. Right by your campus. Saw Cas there with his friend Hannah.” Dean is obviously distracted by whatever he’s working on.
“I don’t think anyone has ever considered me a nickname person.” He looked at the ground, barely blushing.
“Right, I hate to be rude, but I gotta date with my shower so...” Dean puts down his form and collects all of them into a folder.
“Sammy, how much stuff did you bring? For Christ’s sake.” He muttered as he unloaded yet another box of stuff.
“Sammy, it’s a Friday night! Aren’t you supposed to be partying right now?” He said when Sam called him that night.
“Nah, no one special.” He decides. If he tells anyone he has to be sure first. And right now he isn’t even sure what he’d be telling them.
“Nah, those are just one time things. They know that too, so we’re all good there.” Dean explains. He always feels like he has to explain that the women he sleeps with are aware it’s a one time thing. He doesn’t want people assuming he goes around breaking people’s hearts. He never would intentionally hurt someone like that.
“Yeah I know,” he grumbles to his stomach. He’s going to grab some food- but only after a nice and long shower. That last car left him feeling especially covered in grease.
“Okay but briefly. Cassie was my first actual girlfriend, we dated for about five months before I moved away. We were about sixteen. Then Lisa was just a couple years ago, we dated about a year, but it was kind of difficult cause she had a kid. Loved that kid, little three year old named Ben. We were both twenty I think.”
“It’s probably quieter outside?” She said, with her eyebrows raised. Castiel knew that she wanted to talk to him more, and he wasn’t exactly opposed to that. At least he wouldn’t be alone. But he was aware of how Hannah saw him, and didn’t want to give her any ideas that he might feel the same.
“Yes Dean?” He answers, sitting next to him. He liked sitting with Dean. He’d never been friends with men. Not really at least. He found most of them obnoxious. Dean was kind of obnoxious, but he was mostly sweet. He just hid that part of himself. Cas could see it though.
“Dean, it’s nice to meet you again.” He said, almost yelling over the loud music and yelling people. Dean smiled at him and nodded.
“Thank you,” he presses play on the film. The trailers start. “I can never get anyone to watch this with me, it’s brilliant though- you’ll see.” Dean claims as he tosses a blanket at Cas, who was sitting awkwardly.
“What? I can’t spend time with my older brother for no reason?” Sam asked, almost offended. He sat on his bed and crossed his arms.
“Sam, you’re an idiot. A cute idiot.” Sam tilted his head confused. “You don’t have to be embarrassed Sam, you distract me too.” He smiles and they share a kiss. It isn’t long, it isn’t full of passion, just happiness.
“Oh don’t worry about me. My girlfriend and I kind of broke up, but it’s fine really.” She averted her eyes like she didn’t want him to see she was sad.
Sam was still nervous to talk to her about this. He didn’t want to lose one of his only friends. But Dean was right, she’s cool. She’s not gonna stop being friends with him just cause they had different feelings.
“Oof, three coffees? I thought you said you were having a good day?” Meg teases him. Sam rolls his eyes, he wasn’t exactly enjoying her company.
“Slept with a friend’s sibling” Dean said and Charlie put a finger down. Cas rolled his eyes at her, he didn’t want to know.
“Here, I washed it too.” Cas handed him his folded Led Zeppelin shirt. Dean looks down at it and grabs it with a smile.
"Nah, 's just...This is so fuckin' weird, man." Dean sighs with the joint still in his hand. He rolls it idly between his thumb and index finger.
When he pushes inside both of them know they're not going to last very long— they're getting older, angel powers or no. Cas isn't as spry as he used to be, a result of losing and regaining his grace so many times over the years; Dean, for himself, is ageing. Cas looks at him, sees the way time has marked him and how crows feet show up when his eyes shut now, notices the way the skin between on his forehead folds when he fucks him harder and he knits his eyebrows together. Time looks good on Dean, he thinks.
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. Sam is looking at him the way he does when he knows his brother has fucked up but he’s still giving him the benefit of the doubt, and he’s seen it a hundred times but it always gives him a headache.
Dean's phone starts ringing, long-forgotten somewhere else in the backseat, and that snaps him out of it somehow; the moment shatters, spell broken.
He tries for an answer for what feels like too long; Cas has been alive for centuries and has seen more than Dean will ever dream of but he's asking him like he genuinely could learn something from him. Dean swallows before he answers. "It chills me out. Makes my brain shut the fuck up for once. 's'nice."
Cas pulls some rolling paper and a rainbow pot leaf-patterned grinder out of his pocket. "Before you say anything," he starts, "this was somehow the least hideous one the store had."
He forgets about the weed until there’s a knock at his bedroom door one afternoon a handful of months later after Sam leaves with Eileen on a hunt Jody needs backup for. The door opens to reveal Cas, who’s got a jar full of nugs in his hand that's labelled 'Colorado #2' in his neat handwriting.
Dean wouldn't call himself a stoner by any stretch of the imagination, but he knows his way around a joint. Money means he's never really bought his own weed but he's found himself in plenty of back alleys and parties where a joint or a bong got passed around; sometimes a pot brownie.
Dean looks up from his scrambled eggs. "Eh, routine stuff," he sets his fork down and winces at how his shoulder aches when he moves to pour himself more coffee. "Cas found a weed plant."
“Okay,” Dean says, and for the first time in eight years, he kisses Cas. The truth is, he doesn't know how to do this either, but Cas is right. Last time he walked the streets of Seattle he had no idea what to do with the way he wanted Cas, but now it's been nearly a decade of "almost", of almost going for it, of almost dying, of almost kissing each other stupid before the latest catastrophe reared its head, and Dean refuses to let the window close again.
xiii. they say it was written and you are so fucking angry. all you ever wanted was to be safe and loved and warm but what happened to you was written. you were the rifle on the wall and it was always going to end like this.
Dean's laugh mixes with the pool of arousal in his gut. "You've fucked me in worse places." With that, he grabs at Cas' tie and pulls him down, revels in the flash of surprise in his eyes before it's replaced by the predatory gaze that always makes him lightheaded. One of Cas' hands moves to circle his wrists while the other one grabs Dean's chin forcefully, holds his mouth open so he can spit in his mouth. Dean bucks his hips, his dick forming a wet patch on the front of Cas' pants.
Just then as if on cue Cas’s stomach seemed to agree with Jack. He decided to call the front desk, maybe there was a nearby open diner or something that they could walk to. He picked up the phone and heard Jody’s morning greeting.
