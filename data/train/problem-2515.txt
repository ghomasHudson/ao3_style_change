Castiel of course made sure that Kelly was okay with Dean being in her home and with her child, and after that Castiel led Dean to Jack’s room, to where the boy was asleep.  And from what he saw on Dean’s face, Castiel could only assume that his...that Dean loved Jack as much as he did.
When it’s Sam turn to ask his brother, Dean chooses Truth this time. Knowing Sam, he would probably dare him to kiss Castiel right there and that’s a risk Dean can’t take.
Dean steps back, ready to hide from Castiel’s anger, but it doesn’t work. Barely a moment later, Cas is already in front of him. His hand closes tightly around Dean’s arm, keeping him from turning away.
“Oh, okay. Nevermind.” A blonde in a low-cut shirt catches his sight next. He nods his head towards her, while keeping his eyes on his friend. “At 11 o’clock, blonde hair, black shirt. She seems nice.”
“I fairly doubt Chuck’s birthday is going to end up in an orgy,” he tries to banter, but there’s no punchline. It feels like a summary of his entire life now: an endless joke, with no payoff in sight. Cas finishes his joint in silence, while Dean opens a second beer.
“Great, so what’s next? You and Sammy going to play house for some more weeks, until we finally got our suspect?”
Dean will never forget the first time he noticed a gay couple in public. He is around nine years old, and they just finished hunting werewolves in Massachusetts. John even allowed Dean to help with the hunt; he was so proud when the young boy shot the approaching monster right in the chest. Dean feels the pride for the next few days until it all comes crashing down in a little roadside diner. He doesn’t even pay attention to his surroundings, too caught up with his cheeseburger, until he hears an angry grunt from his father.
“Huh… Daniel, his name is Daniel,” Dean stutters, and when his brother looks at him confused, he adds “We went to High School together for a few weeks”
It’s shortly after 2am, when he finally finds it. Sam went to bed already, but Dean wouldn’t give up. Not now. Not after Cas had said…After Cas had said what he said.
Dean is silent beside him, his green eyes regarding the night sky intensely. “I didn’t know humans also get stars.”
It’s almost like he said his thoughts aloud, because the crowd of people move slightly, and Dean sees the angel sitting alone in an armchair. Well, he is not an angel anymore, his grace was the price to get out of the Empty. Castiel seems even smaller in the big chair, like he is trying to hide in plain sight. As a new human, this party must feel overwhelming, Dean thinks to himself. He takes a step forward, as Cas catches his gaze. Only a second, then he inspects the wrinkly skin at his fingertips. They used to stare at each other for minutes, now Cas can barely look at him. They haven’t been alone since Cas’ mysterious return, but their last conversation still haunts every one of their interactions.
Dean starts walking. It’s not a topic he likes to discuss, especially not with the King of Hell. Behind him, Crowley lets out a bitter laugh.
He starts moving at a slow pace, so Dean gets used to the penetration. It’s not long until the ex-hunter asks for it faster, as the sound of moans and slapping skin fills the room. His dick is straining for attention, where it’s brushing against the cold porcelain. Dean’s whole body feels like it’s on fire, and he can tell he’s close. He wants to speak, but he can’t find the words anymore. Ty gladly needs no words, because he can read his body like an open book.
Some angels try to find meaning in their placement in the night sky, but Castiel was never interested in it. In the end, he always considered them to be fantasies to pass the time. Why would he ever wear a crown, only to throw it away happily? It didn’t seem logical to him back then. But here and now, where is he sitting with Dean on the hood of the Impala in the middle of the night, it all seems to make sense.
This is the song that started it all! I remember listening to it over and over again, until this story came to mind. I wanted to write about Endverse since forever and I'm glad I finally got around it. Kudos and Comments will literally brighten my day :) Thanks for reading
The only time he manages to escape from his own thoughts is when he’s alone with Cas. Once the sun goes down, he finds himself at the back door of his cabin, knocking with shaking hands. Every night, he expects Cas to leave him standing in the dark, and yet Cas opens the door with an honest smile every time.
“That’s roughly the number of the Milky Way, there’s countless more in the galaxy – How do you even know that number?”
Newly human, Cas tries his best to cope with the new situation. Even if this means coming up with questionable ideas to find a home for the night.
“Why would the gender of my partner have any influence on their orgasm?” Castiel replies instantly, and Dean can almost hear the head-tilt.
With their lives in the bunker, it’s easy to find a routine. Cas stays over so often, Dean automatically grabs a third coffee mug for breakfast and hands it over the moment the angel appears in the kitchen. Sometimes Dean looks over to Castiel and wonders how a celestial being ended up at his dinner table. And sometimes, when he is sure Cas isn’t paying attention, he looks even closer. Vessels might not be supposed to age, but there are clearly the first wrinkles in his face. Whenever Cas looks sad or frustrated, the hunter can spot them around his eyes or on his forehead. And whenever he catches sight, he feels bad. If it hadn’t been for him, Castiel never would have rebelled. And he’d still live a normal angel life.
“You alright?”, she asks, already knowing the answers. The Winchesters, and especially Dean, did not really talk about their feelings. She fully expects Dean to brush her off with a lame excuse, but finally he speaks.
“I may not know you for a long time, but as far as I can tell, you are a good man. You should die at the age of 90, in your own bed, surrounded by your family. You deserve a life.”
The subway makes its way through the city, but it’s still going far slower than the thoughts in Dean’s mind. He tries his best to calculate his route to the train, but the resolution doesn’t satisfy him. Even if he runs, there’s no way he’s making it in time. But he sure as hell ain’t staying any longer in this city than necessary. He should at least try to get the train, maybe it also got delayed in the process. The speakers announce his stop, and both Dean and the stranger place themselves in front of the door.
Cas finally breaks the eye contact; only to stare at his glass instead. Dean is still trying to figure out why he looks so sad, when the former angel rises from his seat.
“It’s true. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.”, Dean says in a quiet voice. Cas is so close, he could almost lean forward and kiss him. “I love you, Castiel”
Whenever people teased them about being too close or being a couple, Dean just rolled his eyes at them. Their stupid comments weren’t even worth an answer. But it got harder once he and Sam attended the ridiculous musical about their lives.
Dean wants to throw a punch at his little brother, who smirks at him so knowingly. He specifically asked about a “partner”, not a woman. Sam must have noticed the change of behavior. It takes Dean a moment to answer, his eyes are pinned to a little scratch in the table.
It’s hard to catch glimpses of the movers, but she catches a few sights as she stretches out of her bedroom window. One of them has dark hair and is wearing a tan trenchcoat, the other one seems to be taller and is coated in a flannel shirt. Not really the type to be moving into this street, but they might turn out to be nice. She tries to keep an open mind, she tells herself, even though she doesn’t understand how somebody could possibly move while wearing a trenchcoat.
“What the hell do you two think you are doing?” he yells loud enough to attract the entire house to the hallway, where they are watching them closely. Dean and Cas are still on the floor, slowly stumbling back to their feet.
Cas already opens his mouth again, probably wanting to ask Dean if he’s okay, but the hunter won’t let him do it. Instead, he ducks his head, and licks a long stripe along the shaft. Cas’s open mouth releases a moan, as Dean slowly swallows him down. Drool runs down his cheeks, as he tries to bop his head a few times. Dean makes a mental note to look up blowjob tips, not thinking about the implication there. He, Dean Winchester, sucked a dick and lived to tell the tale.
“Please tell me your stupid charade is at least getting you somewhere,” Dean groans, once Cas is settled in his seat across from him. They decided to meet up in a close diner to discuss their next steps, while Sam is hacking the public security cameras from their house. Dean refuses to call it their “home”, hating the implication it’s setting.
“Rocky’s Bar” looks shady and as a human, Dean wouldn’t be caught miles near it. It’s clearly seen better days, but that’s not stopping him tonight. Dean opens the door with a squeaking noise, before immediately regarding the men inside. Most of them are a lot older than Dean; some are even wearing leather clothes. As he walks in, he can feel their eyes following him. Dean is by far the hottest guy in here, and he fucking knows it.
Before Dean can even spell his thoughts out, he is already halfway over to the couple. The guy is currently laughing at something Cas said, and the noise just sounds wrong in Dean’s ears.
Castiel’s blue eyes are still scanning him, as if he’s trying to figure out if Dean is serious. But the more Dean thinks about it, the better idea it is. Having sex with another guy was always one item on Dean’s bucket list, and now seems the best possibility for it. It wouldn’t even count as gay, since Cas is only inhabiting a male vessel. And this way, Dean doesn’t have to drive the Impala back home in his drunken state. Dean and Cas keep their eye contact, not caring or noticing the bar or the crowd around them. Another handful of seconds passes by until Cas finally gives in.
Purgatory is…it’s something else. It feels like a constant hunt, and as much as Dean enjoys it – he only got one thing on his mind: finding Castiel. Being the Most Wanted in Purgatory sure doesn’t help with his mission, but after a while he meets Benny and things start to look better. They slaughter their way through every monster that crosses their way, and Dean only asks one question: “Where’s the angel?”
“Why the hell aren’t we driving?” Dean exclaims as he checks his watch with an annoyed glance. It’s been five minutes since he entered the cart, and they still hadn’t moved a single inch.
“I’m not forcing him to do anything. I’m just asking him to take one for the team, and it’s not like having sex would be the worst experience in the world for him.”
“Ah, sorry – this is Castiel. He’s a – he’s my friend,” Dean stutters, before introducing Elliot to him. He thinks, he can see his former lover give the angel a second glance, but it might as well be his imagination. Everyone shakes their hands awkwardly, before standing in silence again. Luckily, neither Cas nor Luke have any idea how their companions know each other. Another moment passes quietly.
They spend the rest of the day gathering supplies for the spell and preparing them in the dungeon. It hurts Dean to see this room again, but they both agree the spell will probably work there the best. When Sam asks which of Cas’s belongings they should use, Dean hands over one of Castiels trenchcoats. After his time as a human, the men had taken Cas to the mall and bought some new clothes for him, including a second trenchcoat. Sometimes Cas would switch between the coats, especially after messy hunts. Castiel had the option to clean his clothes with his grace, but he preferred the fresh smell of their washing soup. After the Empty had taken the angel, Dean took the trenchcoat into his room, chasing Castiels light smell in the fabric.
“Okay, you do that thing, where you shut the hell up. Forever,” snapped Dean, while his brother just laughed at him. Getting angry sure felt easier to Dean than acknowledging whatever the unspoken thing between him and Castiel was.
Just three little words, it would be so quick to say. And he knows his brother wouldn’t judge him for it. They’ve literally been through hell together; what’s a coming-out compared to that? And yet, Dean never speaks up.
When they drive at night, Cas will sometimes catch a glimpse of the star constellations. He still recalls how some angels cursed God’s decision to also assign stars to humans, thinking only angels were holy enough for such a thing. But whenever Cas catches sight of Dean’s eyes light up with joy – what could be more holy than this?
“Absolutely,” Sam replies. “She was already one of our suspects due to some lucky incidents in the last few years, but when I was at her house, I clearly saw some witch supplies.”
And he loves Dean. Dean singing behind the wheel of his beloved Impala. Dean enthusiastically talking about his favorite movies. Dean moaning as he takes the first bite of pie. Dean wrapping his loved ones into tight hugs, and fighting heaven or hell to keep them safe. He even loves him, when Dean is angry at him or if they are once again at the brink of death. No matter how much time they spend together, watching Dean will never bore Cas.
“We’ve been waiting for ages, no way we’re going to object now,” Sam shoots from the side, making everybody laugh. If Dean wasn’t close to bawling his eyes out, he’d probably throw a witty remark at his brother.
“What’s next? You’re gonna kiss goodbye on the porch when Cas drives to work?” Dean snaps at his brother, who seems confused by the sudden anger.
“Oh, poor Sam,” Tammy sighs, fiddling with her wedding ring. Being cheated on must be awful on its own, but having your husband fool around with your own brother? That’s a new level of tastelessness.
“He’s good, he…,” Dean hesitates, but decides to test the waters. Sam was always very different to their father, but some habits are hard to let go. “He just moved in with his boyfriend”
“Slowly and then all at once?”, Dean sighs, cursing Sam for recommending that damn tear jerker of a book.
Dean nods along, while Eric tells him the whole story about the night: the mom wanted to leave him, he had a few drinks, and he slapped her so hard she hit the side of their stone fireplace with her head. He also tells him it’s not the first time his dad used violence.
Cas takes a moment, looking like he is calculating all possible risks of his answer. Finally, a little smile tugs at the corners of his mouth.
Dean happily agrees as Cas leads them away from the central station. He knows the owner, he tells him on the way, and they spend the next hours just talking about their lives. They almost miss the next train too, both of them too invested in their conversation. The sun is slowly setting at the horizon, and once settled in the comfortable chairs of the train, Dean can feel himself grow tired. Cas sits next to him, a magazine about what appears to be bugs in his lap.
“Well, I’m not going to give you this “I’ve always known” crap, because I didn’t know…Thought of myself as straight as an arrow, until I met Lynn. My vey best friend. We were inseparable and I fell in love the way you fall asleep…”
The night air is cold, but at least the sky is crystal clear. Cas is staring at the constellation, while the moon reflects slightly in his eyes. Deans heart feels like he is bursting with feelings, but he can’t bring the words out. Instead he talks about something he knows: his car.
Dean saw it coming, of course he did.  He had tried cracking a joke in the presence of the angel a few days prior, but he was not amused.  Neither was Sam. Clearly, Cas had more than enough reasons to be pissed at him.
Before he could talk himself out of it, which had been done pretty easily in the past, Dean reached down and took Cas’s hand, holding it lightly.  His thumb traced the still visible marks over his wrist.  Dean didn’t look away from the angel’s eyes.  Neither had been sure, while they’d been separated, that they would get to look at each other again.  But they were together now, and they were fine.
Order seemed to be restored, back into that overly affectionate and disgustingly in love state they went.
"Dean," Cas breathed out.  No matter how many times the hunter said it, the words always brought a beautiful flush to Cas's cheeks, and his eyes always became a little misty.  And no matter how many times Cas said his name like that, Dean could hear everything in it. He could see it all too. Though it astounded him, he could see and hear and
Getting out of Hell was a blur.  They tried not to pay attention to the noises or the light coming from Lucifer and Asmodeus.  Luckily those two seemed to be more focused on each other.  It was a relief.  Sometimes Sam and Dean, compared to others, were normal.  Seemingly not a threat, despite their past victories.  They’d had many losses, too.  But they at least didn’t have baggage going back millions of years or more.  And that?  That was nice.  Sam wondered if, were they to stay alive that long, or if they'd spent enough years in Hell, they would become like these ancient beings full of hatred, carrying grudges with them for each of the other old entities that were still around.  Maybe that’s why there were humans.  God figured out that no one should be alive that long.
As Castiel turned towards his brothers with his brows furrowed, about to explain the situation to their father, he heard a small intake of breath.
The prince gave a small laugh and said, "I desire another dress.  The one you have brought me is lovely, but now I must have one that glitters with jewels...like the stars."
From the darkness where Castiel had first entered, the tunnel, Dean emerges.  His eyes widen once he sees Castiel, and he goes through a journey of facial expressions.  Relief, that Cas is okay.  Some curiosity, at the fact that there seems to be no harm done.  And something else, at the lack of space between Castiel and the djinn, the way that she is completely turned towards him.
Often, Castiel was one to be blunt.  Maybe not with his feelings, but it was time to get some clarification.  It couldn’t hurt at this point.
He figured Cas had some kind of Christmas surprise for him.  Though he wouldn't admit it to anyone, he was really excited.  The only thing that bothered him was that Cas was spending a lot of time alone in their bedroom, and not with him.  Wrapping presents shouldn't take that long, and all of their gifts should have already been gathered in the kitchen.  It was a pretty small pile, but it was something.
Maybe it shouldn’t have been expected, everyone being as selfless as Castiel was in love.  He for one didn’t expect it, not really.  He was actually certain that no one had loved like him.  He wasn’t sure if it was because he was an angel, and he even questioned if it had anything to do with his pride, but Castiel just couldn’t imagine anyone loving anything as much as he loved Dean.  And he didn’t think about it, how selfless his love was, how it lacked any demands.  It just was.
Though Dean was a prince, he had hardly any manners.  He never said please or thank you, and he always made a point to look disgusted in the presence of Castiel.
It was not necessary for Kelly to bribe him, of course, but she promised Castiel that he would be getting a full tray of brownies before he said yes.
Castiel is led by the man to what he is told is a temporary home, which he knows is most likely a dark cave in the woods.  He wonders what the clan is doing in America.  The whole way to the hideout, in the man’s car, which by Sam’s standards must be even crappier than Castiel’s car, he is silent.  He wonders if he should tell Dean that he will not be able to return with the groceries for quite some time.  Looking down at the bag in his lap, he hopes that everything will be okay in the car.  He still does not know exactly what must go in the fridge, or the counters, or the freezer, how quickly things expire—he knows that honey does
Castiel continued to tell Dean not to stop, to never stop, and his hands were pushed down against the bed as he got what he asked for.  It did well to satiate him, to satiate both of them, and his mouth hung open until after they were both finished, still trembling.
“The way that you feel about me, I feel about you.  The things you want, I want them too...I know I’m no good at showing it, and I’m so sorry.”
Dean had to take a moment to collect himself.  The little guy had caught him off guard, not that he would have readily admitted that to anyone.  Sam had left him alone for hardly a minute and some beautiful creature had already found him.  He was pretty sure it was his lucky night.  And getting paid sounded pretty cool too.  Dean grinned and took off his jacket, putting it around Castiel’s shoulders.  He liked the way this guy looked in his jacket, a little too much.  After slipping an arm around his waist, he began to engage in conversation with him.
So no, Dean didn’t leave until Kelly came back and wished them a goodnight, and he was able to get Castiel to accept a ride home this time.  Not their home, not just yet.  But it was something, a start, and when Castiel set his head on his shoulder once they were settled in the impala, Dean thought he might cry.  He didn’t, but he did set a protective arm around Castiel, and pressed a kiss to his hair.
Castiel had just been there when the brothers had returned to the bunker after defeating Chuck, and the conclusion they’d come to was that this was Jack’s last gift to them.  Dean remembers how when he first saw him, his first thought was
Dean looked absolutely disgusted.  Compared to the face that he was now making at Lucifer, he may as well have been giving Castiel bedroom eyes upon their first meeting.  "No, it, it doesn't fit, man!  I mean look at your foot!"
Standing up, Dean figured he needed to get the angel’s wounds cleaned up.  He’d be as gentle with his wings as he could.  He began by taking off Castiel’s shredded clothes.  Not only did Asmodeus cut into Cas and bloody him up, he had to go and destroy his most prized possession, too.  Dean would get him another coat.
Dean didn't even knock, he just threw open the door, which had been slightly ajar.  The sudden action caused Cas to drop something. A quick look down revealed that it had been the mixtape he'd given to Cas years before.
“So? You had sex with April, right?” Dean would never admit it, but the thought alone is enough to leave an uneasy feeling in his gut. He should have taken Cas right into the bunker the moment he found out he was human. But no, he left him out on the streets, only for that treacherous bitch to find him. He still remembers his friend’s expression when the reaper stabbed him, and how cold his skin had felt under Dean’s fingertips. And after all of this, he threw his best friend out of the bunker…
“Hope you put on your running shoes,” the other man jokes, and Dean shoots him a quick smile. They are both in suits, the stranger is even wearing a trenchcoat over it. Not exactly workout clothing, but it’ll have to do.
Dean and Cas depart soon enough, leaving Sam to deal with the rest of the concerned neighbors. Everybody seems to be too caught up in the drama to notice their quiet leave. They end up back in the diner, this time holding hands on the table. Surprisingly, everything feels the same and yet, completely different than before. Dean can’t put it in words, but for the first time in years, he knows he’s truly happy.
“Hello Tammy, Harold. Welcome to our humble home,” Sam greets the guests, as the couple enters their hallway. Cas takes their jackets from them, hanging them in the biggest coat closet Dean’s ever seen. Well, at least the house got some perks. Before he can think more about the architectural features of the house, his brother calls for him.
Would Cas even kiss back, if Sam initiated a kiss? The angel doesn’t seem the type for physical affection; hell, he only lost his virginity a few years ago! The image of Cas pressing Meg against the wall, kissing her passionately, popped back up in Dean’s mind. And then the image changed to Cas and Sam in the same manner…God, Dean’s gonna have to swallow some holy water to get rid of that mental image.
Jack and Mary greet them happily, and even Sam can’t hide his grin as he approaches his brother. “Well, if it isn’t the homewrecker himself.”
When Cas parts his lips, letting Dean enter his mouth with his tongue, a small moan escapes from the hunter’s throat. When he agreed to the thing, he thought it would be hard to get turned on by Cas, no pun intended. But now Cas is kissing him with such a burning passion, his hands roaming over his body without hesitation, and Dean feels himself grow hard in his jeans.
“That’s nice,” Sam replies, before turning his attention back to his laptop. He doesn’t notice Dean walking down the hallway and entering the small bathroom. Dean closes the door carefully behind him. In the dirty and cracked mirror, his reflection is staring back at him.
“Guess it’s lucky then you aren’t here with a woman,” Dean jokes, trying to chuckle away his nervousness. It doesn’t work.
Every star in the night sky represents either one angel or one human. None of the angels know why God did this, just another one of his unexplained miracles. But Castiel finds comfort in watching the stars and knowing it represents his brothers and sisters. He never counted how many angels there are in Heaven, but just like stars, the number almost seems endless. And somehow, Castiel managed to get almost every single one of them to despise him.
The words sound muffled, but Castiel gasps slightly and Dean is sure, he must have heard them. Castiel’s arm feel stiff around his body, so Dean pulls slightly back and cups one of Cas’s cheeks with a hand. As their eyes meet, Dean can’t hold himself back.
Dean takes a look at the person in question and shakes his head instantly. There are tattoos all over the person’s hands and neck, and his boots are drenched in dirt. Why would Cas even consider a punk like this? He probably drives a piece of shit car and lives in a sketchy basement.
Past-Him might have felt ashamed of his attraction to men, but now he is free of any guilt. It’s a good feeling. Dean can’t remember a time, where he didn’t live a lie and now he finally couldn’t care less. He gets drunk if he wants to, he steals if he wants to and he fucks who he wants to. Sometimes, Crowley gives him an annoyed eye-roll about his behavior, but he never speaks up. He wanted Dean to be a demon in the first place, so it’s not his place to judge. And luckily, Crowley isn’t always with him; he still needs to run hell after all. Sometimes, Dean feels like a kid with a babysitter. Tonight, Crowley mutters something about taking the hellhounds to the vet, and Dean doesn’t even bother to ask before his companion vanishes in thin air. Dean waits for another few minutes, before hitting the road himself.
“We could throw another party. Maybe celebrate a birthday or a wedding anniversary. And you and Mom could handle the house in the meantime,” Sam suggests.
Castiel gives a hesitant nod as an answer. “Gabriel was one of the few angels who fornicated with humans. There was this whole thing about the Virgin Mary, I remember... But in case you forgot – he’s dead.”
Before he can put his mouth back on Cas, the angel pulls his face upwards. His breath tingles against Dean’s lips, before he kisses him again. The kiss feels softer and sweeter than before, and it sends shivers down Dean’s entire body. He can feel Cas’s hands graze across his body, halting at the hem of his underwear. Dean just nods as an answer. His friend doesn’t hesitate, as he pulls the boxers down, freeing a throbbing erection.
You really thought I'd write a whole story about Dean kissing and making out with other men, without giving you some Destiel in the end?
“You two make the cutest couple,” she explains with a sappy smile. Dean’s mouth is still full with the last bite of his burger, so Castiel answers for him.
“This is Luke, my husband. Luke, this is Dean and…,” Elliot pauses while shooting Cas an unsure glance. It’s only now, that the hunter finally finds his voice again.
Dean’s fingers halt on the car keys. Part of him wants to run away, but it wouldn’t help. He looks over to the passenger seat, where Elliot is still looking at him. And Dean wants to kiss him, he realizes. Fuck it, he already made it so far.
“I can’t imagine what he’ll do to me, once he knows…,” Eric starts, but immediately shuts his mouth. The sudden silence makes Dean suspicious.
“Never mind, it’s a stupid joke. Not even true, if you ask me. But that doesn’t matter right now” He finally faces his friend again. By the looks of him, Cas is just as nervous as he is. Another step towards. Their faces are only inches apart, Dean notices, and when Cas speaks again, the warm air tingles against his lips.
“And since then you never…,” Dean starts asking, already suspecting the answer to his question. His brother and his friend just regard him with raised eyebrows, before Castiel shakes his head in a stern motion.
“What the hell is that supposed…,” Dean starts, but when he looks over, the passenger seat is empty. A moment later, Dean looks over to the backseat and finds his lover there. Castiel’s body is cold and broken, his white shirt seeped in red blood and his beautiful blue eyes forever closed. And somehow, Dean knows it’s all his fault.
Cas has felt the punch of disappointment several times over the years; he had no idea it would be so much more painful as a human. He should have seen this coming. Without his powers, he’s useless to the Winchesters. It was already kind enough of them to give him some clothes and food. He tries his best to keep his composure, as he leaves the bunker with a heavy heart. Dean’s gaze is prickling at his neck, but Cas doesn’t turn around.
Dean wastes no time and holds her arm gently, pulling them into the quieter parts of the Bunker. They arrive at Deans room and Charlie closes the door behind them. When she turns around, Dean already took place on the bed. He stares at his feet, when he finally breaks the silence.
Half a mile away from the bunker, Cas starts crying. All he wants to do is go home, wherever that might be.
“And before you left, you said…you said all those great things about me. And I didn’t even say anything. I am so sorry for not saying anything, for just letting you sacrifice yourself for me and not even thanking you for it…”
“He’s not trustworthy, he’ll double-cross us the second he gets the chance,” Sam counters, confirming Dean’s suspicions only further. They sit in silence for another moment, weighing their options. They need the portal to get the weapon, so far it’s the best shot they got at defeating Chuck once and for all. Finally, Dean has enough. The answer is so obvious, but neither Sam nor Cas are accepting it.
“It’s just – every time I see a bee or something, I have to think about you,” he admits. “Remember how you collected honey yourself? Or when you showed up covered in bees?”
“How is your friend? What was it – Daniel?” Sam asks him immediately when he returns to Bobby’s house.
„Most of them are good and true, and... how could anyone know them and not love them?” Akobel asked them more than a hundred years ago, but Castiel didn’t understand him back then. He didn’t understand why Akobel would die for his human family; now he’d sacrifice himself for Dean and Sam in a heartbeat.
Humans are fragile, Castiel soon realizes. If he doesn’t eat enough, his stomach twists itself in pain. If he’s too cold, he ends up shivering so hard he can’t even fall asleep. Not to mention all the little cuts and bruises he ends up collecting over time. He couldn’t feel any more different than during his time as an angel, where he could heal and kill with a snap of his finger. Now he finds himself searching dumpsters for some food and sleeping in freezing alleyways, hoping to live another day.
“Sammy, I can explain…,” Dean starts, but now Sam turns his attention to Cas. He steps closer to them, his pointed finger slapping against Castiel’s chest.
And here we are. A big thank you to every single person who read my weird self-insert coping story, a big thanks to every kudos and every comment. It's been a crazy few months and I can't wait to see what will happen next. This was the biggest writing project I've done in years, and I had so much fun with it.
When they enter the room, Dean’s eyes immediately focus on the bed. The bed, in which he and Cas are going to fuck soon. Otherwise, the room has only a basic interior. Dean can’t even spot a minibar, so there goes his chance of some liquid courage.
He even made Dean write a bucket list with his personal plans. At first, Dean had laughed at the idea. What the hell was he even supposed to write down? But after a while, more and more ideas popped into his head. He carries the folded piece of paper in his jacket’s chest pocket and adds to it from time to time. Most of it will probably never happen, but the visual image is somehow comforting.
And as Dean watches his happy and fucked-up family, his hand tightly holding onto his husband, he just knows truer words were never spoken.
Cas’s face nuzzles into Dean’s neck, as they both slowly come down from their orgasm. Dean is still breathing heavily, as he pulls his arms around Cas. “That was fucking amazing.”
Jody invited all of them to her cabin at Lake Alvin, just outside of Sioux Falls. They are celebrating Claire’s graduation from college, and Dean couldn’t be prouder of the kid. He talks Cas into buying her the cheesiest greeting card they can find, paired with the most beautiful gun in the entire bunker. It’s got engravings all over and Dean even finds somebody who puts “C.N.” onto the side of it. He would rather have Claire live a normal life, but he knows it’s not going to happen.
“Dude, I’m sorry, but I think…I’ll drive you back to your car,” Dean stammers. The whole thing with Daniel back in High School was an accident, and the night with Marco also took him by surprise. But this right now – this was planned and now he really feels like an idiot.
When he opens his eyes, all he sees is purple. The room seems to be painted in the color, reflecting on every surface possible. And in the middle of it all stands Jennifer, glaring at them with violet and angry eyes.
“I have an idea…well, actually Claire had the idea, but I think it’s kinda awesome. And since everyone we love is already here, it would just be such a good opportunity and…”
And there, sitting next to the flowing river, is Castiel. Part of Dean wants to yell at him, be angry, maybe even punch him – but for the most part, Dean is relieved. Cas is alive.
Dean can feel a blush creep up his neck, as he stares at his brother. It’s the reasonable thing to do, but it just feels wrong. Nobody ever questioned their status as friends, and Dean can’t even picture the both of them acting in love. When he thought his stomach felt bad before, he’s now actually feeling sick.
Dean doesn’t even know what the hell a bear is or if it’s something he would be attracted to. But he knows the guy in front of him is looking rather handsome. He is blond, just like Daniel, but he is wearing glasses and is a bit shorter than Dean. Still pretty cute.
It took him a while to get used to the angel with his weird staring and lack of understanding for personal space. But at the same time, Dean was drawn to him. Castiel was a warrior and soldier, just like Dean. And just like the hunter, he had doubts about the world he was told to believe in. Falling in love with Cas crept up on him. Surely Dean realized quickly that the angel’s vessel was an attractive guy, but that was only half the deal. Whenever the angel tilted his head in confusion, Dean’s heart skipped a beat. There was something endearing about him, but Dean couldn’t name the feelings in his chest. He dismissed it as friendship and for several years, it made sense to him. Growing up, Dean never had a best friend and his little brother was only a cheap substitute. But Cas took him just the way he was: the good, the bad, and the ugly.
When he finally rises from the bed, Cas just gives him a sad look. Whenever he leaves, words collect themselves at the tip of Dean’s tongue. He wants to tell Cas how much those nights mean to him, how much
“Sorry to interrupt, but I don’t think this will work,” Dean chimes in, putting his hand on Cas’s arm. He gently grips Cas by the elbow of the dozy trenchcoat, pulling him away from the stranger and back towards their table. The other man yells something after them, but Dean won’t hear it. Castiel is far too good for somebody like that.
“Sure…,” the hunter answers, trying to sound calm. He can only hope this time will go smoother than that night so many years ago when they were thrown out of the brothel. “We shouldn’t waste any time. Give me 15 minutes and we’ll head to a bar.”
“Dean?”, he whispers, and the hunter feels the ground beneath them shake again. His hands hold Castiel tight, afraid he might lose him on the way between the worlds. The next second, they are back in the bunker, Sam staring at them with open mouth. Cas tries to stand up and Dean still holds onto him, like Cas is his lifeline. When Cas finally stands steadily, Dean falls into his arms, hugging him close. In the corner of his eye, Dean sees Sam sneaking out of the room. Dean takes a deep breath, before he speaks again.
He waits until Bobby and Sam are grocery shopping to open the computer. Dean even opens a private tab, before he starts typing with shaky hands.
“Sex wasn’t really one of my priorities in the last few years, I was rather busy trying to save your asses all the time.”
“There’s things, there’s people…feelings that I…I want to experience differently than I have before. Or maybe even for the first time.”
“Wow, look at that beauty…I might not seem the type, but I love old cars,” Elliot exclaims, as he regards the car. “Damn, I really envy that lucky bastard who owns this one”
“Sometimes I don’t even know who I am anymore,” Cas says one night, his arms wrapped around Dean in a tight hug. It’s still early and Dean allows him a few more minutes in the embrace, while Cas strokes his hair softly.
Sam and Cas just look at him with wide eyes, indicating Dean clearly missed some important chunk of the memo. Castiel is the first one to speak, as he regards Dean with a raised eyebrow.
This story wouldn't have been possible without the amazing support from my clown queens. I love y'all so much, and thanks for accepting me with all my weirdness.
“I don’t want some homo as my brother, you can die for all I care,” yells Sam at him. Dean knows it’s only an illusion, a simple mind trick, but the words still break him. Before he can start crying, the image shifts again to a dark alleyway. There is an unconscious person on the concrete ground, but no one is around to help. Dean immediately recognizes the dark hair, before he even spots the man’s face.
“This could be real, you know? If you’d just let it happen…,” Castiel suddenly says, and Dean jumps a little in his seat.
“I-I’m glad you are here,” Dean says instead while raising his beer in a toast. Castiel meets it with his own bottle, a strangely intimate gesture. He gives Cas a warm smile, before taking a sip. He’d rather have him as a friend for the rest of his life than to lose him as a lover.
Meanwhile, Sam had grabbed the old leatherbound book and reads through the mentioned page. He reads it longer than necessary, probably to give Dean the time to wipe away some unwanted tears. After a while, Sam sighs and nods.
This must be the tenth time or so i wrote about the scene in 15x18, and I still got many more coming...This song made me think so much about Dean, I'm not even sorry. It's a short one, but I think it holds a lot of weight.
“Take off your pants and lean over the sink,” Ty demands with a smirk and Dean obeys at once. It crosses his mind to give the guy a bit of a fight; maybe he’ll get some slaps for it. But with the Mark, it’s still a risk. One bad move, one bad remark, and he’ll crack his pretty skull open on the tiles. The sink feels cold against Dean’s skin, but it’s solid and he can see his face stare back at him in the mirror.
Dean’s brain stopped working a while ago, and he takes out Ty’s hard dick without hesitation, before sliding onto his knees. Dean Winchester faced monsters, demons, angels, and gods, and yet he’s never been as intimidated as he is at this moment. He has no idea what he is doing, but he starts with a confident lick along the length.
“He can’t be older than 25, he probably has no idea what he’s doing. You won’t have a good time with him if you have to lecture him the whole way through.”
was the man he’d wanted to grow old with. Lost deep in his own thoughts, he hadn’t even noticed that Dean had come back and was sitting next to him.
“Yea Cas. I’m here. I deserve whatever you were thinking.“ Dean walked over to Cas taking his jacket off of his shoulders and hanging it up on the hook by the door. “The chili needs to simmer for a while before its ready so how about you and I sit on the porch and talk while the kids burn off some of their energy outside? I’d really like a chance to talk to you” Everything in Deans body language portrayed his remorse and shame.
“Sam? Sam knows too? Well, what is it, Charlie? What is it that apparently everyone knows about my husband that no one felt the need to tell me??” Dean was starting to let his anger overtake his concern. Cas was his husband if anyone was supposed to be the keeper of his secrets it should be Dean, not Charlie and definitely not Sam.
So lost in his own inner turmoil he didn’t hear Jess call his name nor see her standing in front of him with a sandwich and the telephone. Only when she set down the plate and snapped her fingers in front of his glazed over eyes did he come back to reality.
“That’s okay Aidan how about we go set up a movie in the living room so it will be ready when Daddy and Claire come down the stairs.”
He skimmed through the brochure a little more before hopping in the shower. He was pleasantly surprised that the towels were fluffy and soft, almost like drying off using clouds. He looked at the bottle of scent blockers peeking out his bag, then he pushed it down, it’s his vacation if people didn’t like the way he smelled then too bad for them.
“Enjoy your lunch. We can head back to the office after this, I want to run some other tests and make a few phone calls. I want to be positive before I give you anything to worry about. Then you are coming to dinner at my house, I know Jess has been dying to dote on you. We can talk about the rest of this then. I just wanted you to get a little special treatment today.” Sam tried to sound upbeat hoping Cas knowing he wasn’t dying today would help with the news he had yet to deliver.
“Alright go get Cas, and I’ll meet you guys at the car once I get our tickets for the tour.” Sam got up to grab his wallet out of the jeans he’d been wearing before.
“You know Dean, I’m starting to look forward to these runs so I can spend time with you.” Cas was never one to beat around the bush. “Yea Cas, I like spending time with you too.” Dean wasn’t one to talk about emotions, but down here in what quickly became ‘their place’ he could speak without being judged. “I don’t just want to be your friend anymore Dean.” Cas grabbed onto Deans' hand to further emphasize his words. “Me either Cas, I just want you.” Dean stared into those sapphire eyes and smiled. There were secret notes left for each other almost every day after that. Cas would tuck notes in the windows of baby while they were at school. Dean would tuck notes into books Sam let Cas borrow to study.  They managed to have full conversations using only a few words, everything coded for Cas’ safety.
“Okay so yea we sort of did that night at the roadhouse, but we haven’t talked about it since then. I mean yea we agreed that we didn’t want to get mated that night cause well, we just didn’t. The problem is he hasn’t said anything about it since then. I mean don’t get me wrong, neither have I, but I figured with graduation happening and his new job making him have to move closer to the office he’d mention it. Or maybe he really doesn’t want me.” Deans scent turned sour and acidic. “What if I was just like a crush he needed to get out of his system? Now that he’s had me he’s ready to just move on? What if—”
The shift in Deans demeanor didn’t go unnoticed by Cas, he felt horrible knowing he was the reason behind the shift.
"OKay so, I know this isn't the most romantic place in the world, but I have something special planned for you. I just hope you like it." Dean grabbed Cas's hand as they got out of the car and pushed through the doors.
It seemed like no matter how long they were together ‘Destiel’, as Charlie had started calling them, just can't seem to see the truth for what it is. Dean still had a habit of assuming the worst instead of talking, and Cas had decided that if Dean could still assume the worst then that meant he still either didn’t trust Cas or somehow still didn’t love him.
When they pulled up to the roadhouse, Cas was slightly saddened, it was their first anniversary after all, and he was hoping for something more....intimate.
“Well…” Dean couldn’t think of any words to say to explain exactly what was waiting behind that door.
“Papa? Papa don’t cry the snowman didn’t eat me up I’m right here Papa.” Claire was looking over at him, the smile on her face replaced with concern.  Claire cupped his face with her foam-covered hands in an attempt to comfort him, if only she knew how much pain he really was in at that moment.
“You rest up now, your doctor will be in any moment to check up on you now that you’re awake.” She fluffed the pillows under his head, tucked the blankets around his body and on her way out, she pulled a chocolate pudding out of her pocket with a spoon and handed them to Dean.
So many times before, he could see the way travel and stress was wearing on him. There was something he wanted to talk about, maybe they should get it over with before the kids woke up, or more likely decided that they needed food beyond cereal and the yogurt that they could reach on their own.
“Earth to Dean” Charlie was snapping her fingers in front of his green eyes. “You alright man? I asked you a simple question and not only do I get no answer you go all
Sams part of the whole plan is very simple, deliver the note and wait. His note had three simple words,
Anyone with eyes and half an ability to scent could tell those two were pining after each other, but neither would make a move. Dean had too many self-esteem issues and Castiel, well he was so gone on Dean he’d rather just be friends than risk losing him.
Gabe searched the crowd for Sam only to see him turn and walk away with a smile on his face, he had no clue how exactly but Sam had to have been responsible. He was going to figure out how.
“I will find some way to redeem myself to you, Dean.” The words were softly spoken as a single tear fell down his cheek. “I will find a way to redeem myself to everyone else as well.” Cas grabbed Deans hand bringing it close to his chest, the closest he can get to hugging at the moment.
They both knew Sam was not going to win the battle this time, he had already convinced Jess once before that they were not ready. There was no way she would be swayed to his opinon a second time.
The phone rang and rang and eventually went to the voicemail. Deans heart sank, what if this was the last time he heard his husbands voice? A recording, a cold impersonal recording.
“I trusted Ellen….I trusted Ellen because I believed she had no ulterior motive in helping me. She just wanted to help. There was no obligation, no expectation, no judgment in her eyes.”
Seven times, Cas had managed to survive an Omega run seven times and no one could figure out how he did it. The first time had been right after he presented, his family wasn’t the most well-off so this was the best way that they could think of finding a ‘suitable’ mate for him.
“You’re not going to lose him, we’re going to get him through this together, all of us. You’re not alone Dean. We’re all going to do our part. All you need to do is be the annoyingly loving, doting husband that we all know you are.”
“Mind if I join you?” Dean looked up to see an older man with shoulder-length salt and pepper hair and steely blue eyes.
Castiel sat down and let his mind go blank. Once a week he had to design a new piece, with the promise that he would eventually make these creations for Pam to sample.  This week's creation turned out to be a
Sam told Castiel of how Dean had broken down and the kids seeing their own counselors. For his part, he did feel guilt but knew it was for the best. The most surprising piece of information Castiel got in that short 20 minutes was that Dean was seeing a psychiatrist and not being dragged screaming and kicking. Just maybe things would get better.
No sooner than Castiel walked out of the door dressed in his suit and lucky trench coat Dean had his phone to his ear.
“That’s insane, Cas loves you almost as much as you love baby, be real.” Charlie tried but couldn’t resist the urge to smack Dean upside the head.
“OH!!!! Chuck!!! Cassie has found his omega!!!” Castiel winced as his mother started yelling without taking the phone away from her mouth.
“Oh uh yeah, looks like we’re sharing a room.” Dean held up the key for Cas to see. “Why don’t you go ahead and I’m gonna go talk to Sam, and so he knows when to meet us for food.” Castiel nodded and grabbed the key. As he walked away, Dean, for lack of a better word, melted over the way the muscles in his back rippled with each step. Only for a brief moment did he allow his eyes to drift lower and take in his butt.
Cain looked at his patient while continuing the conversation about the options they had left before a transplant was their only option. Dean listened as intently as his emotions would let him, but even then all he could hear was transplant and death. He knew that Cain had already submitted Cas for the transplant list, they just weren’t going to tell Cas and cause him to stress.
Castiel decided he’d rather be sitting when he got whatever news was coming to him. Luckily Sam didn’t make him wait too long. “Hey Cas.” Sam popped his head in the door.” You’re my last patient before lunch. What do you say we take this appointment on the road and get you a good meal? My treat?” Sam didn’t wait for an answer he turned and headed for his office, presumably to grab his jacket.
“Everything that Cas is going through? What are you talking about?” Dean took a step towards the kitchen door to peek in the living room. Was there something that he had missed? Yea Cas looked a little more tired than usual…
Dean was doing what he could to keep up with the schedule that Castiel had built to keep the kids busy, but he was so focused on trying to fix Castiel that the kids always seemed like an afterthought.
After checking in and getting the appropriate kitchen gear (aprons, hair nets) each of them was assigned to their own guide and walked through the process of making their own bar. Sam went with a simple dark chocolate bar with caramel. Castiel mixed in some peanut butter chips to his classic milk chocolate. Dean, however, tried to fit as many different things into that bar as they would let him.
“Cas…” Dean sat next to the bed searching for the words clinging to his husband's hand as solid proof that Cas was in fact still with him. “Please can you, can you at least tell
Sam was more shocked that the next scent to assault his senses was omega slick. Before he could utter one word, Dean was up and out running back to his room.
“The princess is all clean and ready. Go ahead and start the movie, I need to put on something….dry.” Castiel couldn’t help but laugh at his husband. He’d learned long ago that Claire took baths like splashing was an Olympic sport and she was going for the gold.
Dean snuggled back trying to get in the last few minutes of rest before the alarms went off for the day.
“Dean? You usually call in the middle of the day, is everything alright?” Dean could hear his brother shuffling around, no doubt the moose was sitting up. A groan let him know Sam had just looked at the clock.
“Wow, umm ok well that’s all we need for the files. Next time I see you, I’ll be in scrubs.” Gabe stood up and walked away from his baby brother determined to save him if it was the last thing he did.
Castiel couldn’t help but stare, but he still glanced away, keeping an eye on the kids. Dean noticed his wandering eye and smiled. “The kids are building a sand wall to protect Aidens castle, they are away from the water and safe. Plus how could you ignore this?” Dean stood up and started flexing muscles like he was part of the Mr. Universe pageant.
Sorry its taken me so long to update, I'm having a little writers block and I want to make sure the story is perfect for you guys. I hope its up to par for you.
“Dean, I’ve loved you for years, but you’ve been so adamant about never having a mate I couldn’t push it. I would rather have you in my life as a friend than risk losing you because I couldn’t control my emotions.” Castiel cupped Deans cheek in his hands.
Aiden adjusted by doing what he had always done best; he went numb. Pushing away from the parent he viewed as not wanting him was a defense mechanism he learned and perfected after realizing that daddy Dean wouldn’t be around as much as he wanted him to be long ago.
“Ha, Sammy is so screwed, he might as well pick out a crib and start painting the nursery.” Dean chuckled while he started filling his thermos full of coffee.
“Cas?” Dean strolled up to the bedroom not thinking much of it, he was probably taking a nap after his session, afternoon naps weren’t unusual. The lights were off in the room but he could see the lump under the blankets. Dean decided to toe off his shoes, slip out of his jeans and t-shirt and join his angel. When he slipped into the bed and wrapped his arms around Castiels' midsection he noticed the tremor that seemed to have control of Castiels entire body. Dean trailed his hand up to Cas cheeks and forehead. Cas had a high fever.
If it wasn’t for the eruption of applause from the other guests at the steakhouse, they might have made it happen right then and there.
Standing in the shower, he continued attempting to piece together his night. They’d only gone to the bakery…it gets fuzzy, but he vaguely recalls shots….lots of shots. His memory was clearing up slightly. Standing and letting the water cascade down his body, another memory came to him. Sharp and biting at his conscience. He let the water wash away his shame as well. He couldn’t believe that he had spoken to Dean so harshly. Dean may not have been the most considerate roommate at times, but he didn’t deserve that. He’d let his raw feelings get the best of him.
Jess sat at the table staring down the envelope sitting on the kitchen counter. She sipped her tea and thought about what was hanging in the balance. Could she really bargain away her children? Sams words weighed heavily on her as she sat down her mug and ripped open the envelope. She had to know could she help. Jess was sitting tense staring down at the lab results when Sam came home from work.
“After looking over the notes from your previous sessions I have decided that we need to make this a ‘whole body’ experience.”
Once Dean got Castiel settled on the swing and laid a blanket across his legs, Dean walked down off the porch to catch the kids. “Aiden!! Claire!! Come put on your jackets and then you can go play!!”
“Oh umm, okay. Good luck with your paper Dean.” Hannah wrapped her arms around herself and shuffled towards her apartment complex.
Sam wanted so much to be angry with Dean and to yell but he just couldn’t. “Dean, you know you did what you thought was right. And the fact that you’re here now indefinitely shows you’re trying. How long did they say that they could hold that spot for Cas up at Glenwood Springs?” Sam knew half of what he said he didn’t believe but that last thing he needed right now was for Dean to decide to fully check out leaving him to take care of both kids and put back together two grown men.
where they are as well.” Cas couldn’t help but chuckle. “Dean we need to talk.” Cas took a moment to sit up completely in the bed and fold his hands in his lap. “No, no we don’t. Right now we need to enjoy a relaxing evening eating the best burgers in town and….” Dean reached down into his bag and pulled out a DVD ” watching this documentary I picked up for you on bees.”
Dean knew she didn’t mean anything by it, all of the registering of school and most interactions had been taken care of by either Sam or Castiel. “I believe your husband informed us that you were out of the country. Welcome back.” But it still hurt, just another reminder of how much of a ghost he’d been in his children’s lives.
Dean was floating on air, but you’d never know it just by looking at him. He was headed to the library for a little research on a paper he’d been putting off. It was due in a few days, and he had to get a good grade now that he had a chance with Cas.
,  to your front door first thing in the morning. Is that acceptable?” Gabriel knew this would be more than enough but after Sams threats, he would go to the moon and back to make things right.
“Thank you Dean-o, and for your joint cooperation, turn to your right and lift the first lid.” Gabriel pointed and they both turned just now noticing that there was a row of covered dishes just behind the bar.
Claire had no reason to doubt her brother, he always seemed to know more than her and understand what the adults were talking about a little bit better so she decided that Aiden must be right. Claire remembered that night of uncle Sam driving them to what he called a hospital and meeting the nice nurse that told her papa was sleeping.
“So….safe to say we need a new plan?” Gabe waited for the scent of Sams’ fury to dissipate before he broke the silence. “Umm…yea…” Charlie barely made a sound her body still tense from the tongue lashing they received from the giant puppy.
“Hello…earth to Cassie…Hello….” Gabriel was snapping his fingers in front of his brothers face. Castiel snapped back from his daydream. “Oh Gabriel, when did you get here?” Castiel looked over at the clock on the wall. He’d meant to clean the apartment but he’d gotten sidetracked thinking about the future and what could be.
take our responsibilities seriously. Now I promised that I would be the one to fill the order and that’s exactly what I plan on doing. I’m going to get the kids to school and hope they haven’t missed too much. You can do whatever the hell you want with your day, but we all have places that we need to be.” Castiel had gotten eerily quiet towards the end of his rant. He pinched the bridge of his nose, took a deep breath and went to finish getting dressed.
“I’m not one to trash talk anyone. I’m a firm believer in everybody should march to the beat of their own drum, but she’s….” Charlie searched for the right word to explain how she felt about the one woman that had twisted Dean up so bad he was only a shell afterward.” Well, you saw what he was like when he first moved in with Castiel.
. Not his typical cartoonish flowers and animals but it was what he was feeling. This particular creation would have three flavors. The leaves would be flavored apple, the stems would be pear and the trap itself would be pineapple. Castiel chuckled to himself at the thought. Pineapple is said to have enzymes that try to eat you as you eat the fruit. It was too perfect not to use.
“Seems to me it might not be as hard as you’re making it out to be.” Cain squeezed Deans shoulder for a grounding moment and walked away.
“Another time.” Castiel nodded at her and went back to writing in his notebook, not paying attention to when exactly Hannah walked away.
The doctor told Dean that he would speak with Castiel about getting him on the visitation list and possibly bringing him in for a few joint sessions.  All Dean could do was sit on the sidelines and wait until his husband -
Cas rolled his eyes, it was karaoke night, Couldn't get anymore unromantic than spending the night listening to a bunch of drunk Co-eds sing off-key to the top 40s.
“So has anyone heard from the crazy couple yet?” Gabriel was the first to break the silence.” Everyone looked around holding back chuckles. Everybody knew what was happening.
Being the brother-in-law of one of the most respected doctors in the hospital has its perks. Sam managed to get Cas his own dialysis machine at home along with his favorite nurse doing home visits for every treatment. Although Dean was sure Sam only asked Missouri to do home visits because he saw how much Dean was rattled by her. Cas, however, was enamored with the woman and her motherly tough love.
Dean watched he walk off shaking his head, he felt bad but at the same time, he was protective and possessive of their new relationship.
“I forgot bro its been a while since you went back for a visit. Mom and dad are no longer uptight, stick in the mud people who raised us.” Gabriel finally looked up.
“Does this mean that when papa comes home you won’t leave again?” Aiden played with the button on Deans shirt while waiting for the answer.
Among his favorites had to have been the Moroccan Chicken bastille, a mix of sweet and savory that he didn’t know existed before and would never forget. He even asked for the recipe as something he could make for Castiel and the kids once he was retired from this stressful job. A year ago, even a month ago he couldn’t imagine not working as a contractor but talking to Sam smacked him with the reality of the situation. Castiel was done dealing with his prolonged absences, Sam sounded truly afraid of what might be going on in Castiels head and the only way to truly fix the situation is to physically be there.
To say that the next morning was awkward would be a gross understatement. Castiel didn’t bother to show up to breakfast, he just texted Sam to bring back a snack to his room. Castiel was embarrassed for his actions, he was ready to buy a bus ticket and end his vacation early, the last thing he wanted to do was cause tension on their family time. It was clear that Dean didn’t want to be near him and he wasn’t going to force him to be.
“Thank you, Gabriel, really I appreciate it.” Sam locked eyes with Gabriel hoping that his few words and honest eyes could convey his gratitude in ways his words just weren’t ready to work.
Getting the kids dressed was no problem, everything went smoothly as it does most other days. Where the problem came in is getting to school. What should have been a 10-minute drive, turned into an hour. There was an accident right at the only exit to their subdivision and of course, no one knew how to get around it so they sat still forever.
When they pulled up to the front of the inn, it seemed as if they were in the middle of a movie set. The large picturesque home was sitting in the middle of a pasture reminiscent of a classic Christmas family special. There were wildflowers everywhere and a walking trail. Across the front porch were old fashioned rocking chairs some painted white, some still in their natural wood coloring. While the brothers took in their surroundings, Castiel snuck away to check in, he didn’t want either of them to know exactly what he’d paid for the three of them for the next few days.
The nurse popped her head back in the door winking at Cas in the process. “You ready darling? Looks like I get to stick you with a needle.” Her eye brows danced in a suggestive way that made Cas skin crawl. “So do you have a preference? Left or Right arm? Or are you one of those people who prefer the hand?” She was setting up her tray with a number of tubes each marked with a distinct colored cap and all the necessary labels.
Castiel had previously wondered how Ellen had gotten it, but now he knew. Dean had brought it for him. It wasn’t the first time someone had offhandedly mentioned Dean or called him his husband. Maybe they didn’t know that he had filed for a divorce, maybe they didn’t know how much Dean was the reason he had been there in the first place. Either way, it didn’t matter. Castiel sat and stared out at the flowers, they never let him down.
Sam felt so guilty and so stupid. He should have seen this was coming. Castiel had changed his will, placed himself closer to Sam and included him in their daily lives. He was always close to his brother-in-law but this……this was unusual and he should’ve seen the signs.
“Oh honeybee I didn’t know you would be home so I went to have dinner with Sam & Jess. Sam is trying to soothe Jess’ case of baby rabies by having her dote on me. I highly doubt it’ll work but I wont argue with fresh baked cookies and pampering.” Cas chuckled and shook his head. He was in the process of making oatmeal for breakfast although instead of his typical bananas, Dean noticed he was adding apples.
When he got to the end of the contract his hand hovered over the final line that still required his signature.
“Gabriel, what are you doing? Unlock the doors and let us out!” Castiel wasn’t even sure that he could be heard but it made him feel a little better.
“Hello Hannah, I decided to pick up a few more hours to get more experience as well as help guide young students such as yourself.” Castiel looked up with nothing more than a professional smile in her direction.
Castiel refreshed their mugs with coffee, his sweetened with a little honey and a touch of milk. Deans just black. ‘
Charlie is leaning on the desk talking with what looks like a new client. Dean sized him up before he got to the desk, short, animated and he looks like he’s trying to flirt with Charlie, Dean chuckles thinking how bad this guy is wasting his time. Must be some spoiled rich guy who’s too concerned over their car.
They’ve only been there a week but it’s easy to see that Castiel will be a staple at the shop for as long as he wants. He’s already starting a fan base of customers who normally pop in once a week but are coming every day just to see what he creates for that day. One guy in particular never seems to buy anything but always stays for a chat.
The longer he sat and woke up, the more he started to notice.  His boots were missing, meaning so was his lucky knife, whatever they used to tie his hands was not the same material used on his legs and there are enough bottles in this room to fund both kids college funds plus some. Just by looking at the construction of the place he’d only need a few and he could be set for life.
“Papa!!! Did you know if you get a bow and arrow enchanted then you can use it hunt the giant monster?” Aidan babbled from the back seat of the SUV.
Gabe took the concoction off the heat. Grabbing a bowl and some organic berries Gabe moved over to the counter top to face his brother.
And with that thought, he would slip into being ridiculously horny. Cas would start thinking about their many nights under the stars before they had the kids. The way they could take each other apart. Their honeymoon.
"Could you imagine if they have a girl?" Sam was laughing at every scenario that was playing in his mind.
“We’re not here to blame anyone Castiel and you’re getting off-topic. We’re talking about trust. But I can sense you need to get this out, why didn’t you trust Dean to care for you?”
“Okay so I’m looking at your labs and I have a couple things to discuss with you.” Cain pulled a file out of his briefcase and set it on the table in front of him. There had to be enough papers that the stack was at least two inches thick. Dean stared in disbelief if this was lab results for one patient. Why didn’t they just issue laptops to all the doctors it had to be cheaper.
“I umm got us an apartment right off campus, and I got a job already waiting for me when we move. I told you I was going to take care of you and I meant that.” Dean pulled Cas into his lap, the same way they sat for so many hours in their little hideaway.  After what seemed like a forever silence, Dean pulled a small box out of his pocket.
It was moments like these that Castiel would try to focus on every part of Dean, the sparkle in his emerald eyes when he was up to no good, the lines around his mouth that only form in a true smile. His strong jaw. His broad shoulders that broadcast his feelings. Muscular arms wrapped in his favorite grey Henley. His physique clearly from hard work. Calloused hands that are amazing working out tense shoulder muscles.
“Oh, yea they made that bet back when you guys were in high school. It was so obvious to the rest of us but you two were the champ of low self-esteem and king of obliviousness.“ The way Gabriel talked meant that none of what was happening between him and Dean was an unexpected development.
10 years ago today the two of them stood on the edge of the cliffs of Lovers Lane in Monterey, California. They pledged their love to each other and promised to cherish, support and always be there for each other.
“you know what Sam, you’re an idiot. I don’t have the time to orchestrate another shut-in so I’m gonna fix this in a jiffy. Gabriel has done everything except ride you into the sunset.”
“Yea I know what you mean, so Jess wants to know when you’ll stop turning down her attempts to come up here and baby you.” Sam and Cas knew it was the last thing standing between her and convincing Sam that they are ready for a baby. “You know Sam, it’ll be easier for all of us if you just give in, you’re going to be a great father.” Sam looked down into his lap, his insecurities starting to surface. “That’s what everybody says but I don’t know. I mean what if I mess up? I didn’t exactly have the best example.” Sam always had the fear of turning out like..
“Papa!!! Are you going to play with us?” Claire wrapped her arms around his neck in one of her oh-so-right hugs that she’s given since birth.
“Sam” Dean couldn’t say much more his voice was already starting to break like his heart which was shattering more with every minute.
“I think what Dr. Mullen is trying to gently say is that its time to start mentally preparing for surgery to be a strong possibility. We knew this could be a possibility from the beginning.” Sam locked eyes with Dean, he knew his brother wouldn’t take this information well. Dean was doing everything he could to remain strong. As the group continued the discussion of how the next steps of Cas treatments would go, Dean was beginning a mental spiral.
“No Dean it’s ok… I’ll sit in the back. I’m already intruding on your sibling ritual.” Cas nodded his head and reached out for the door handle.
“Lawnmower accident?” Dean laughs, as he re-reads the headline again. “Well, if this isn’t our kind of thing, I really don’t know what is.”
Carefully, Cas pulls on top of him, pressing Dean into the mattress with his weight. Between them, their cocks slide together and they both hump forward in the search of some friction. Dean’s hand wraps easily around them both, stroking them in a fast and desperate pace. He can feel he’s getting close to orgasm, and judging by Castiel’s fast and heavy breathing, he isn’t too far behind him.
“There’s no rush,” Dean simply answers, trying his best not to settle on the thought. If he’d ever marry someone, it probably would be Cas. His eyes are still fixed on the laughing figure when Claire continues speaking.
It’s like a slap; the echo still ringing in Dean’s ears. There are tears streaming down Cas’s face and Dean can’t help but shake his head. He can’t do that, not now. It was supposed to keep an unsaid thing, but now Castiel had broken the silence.
Dean might have prepared for the worst, but the terrors of hell are much worse than he ever could have imagined. Every day, they hurt him in new ways. And today, Alistair got a special surprise for Dean. There are no knives in sight, and Dean already knows it’s a bad sign.
After some discussion about clothing choices, Cas also strips down to his underwear. Cuddling in jeans and a dress shirt would have been awful, and Dean luckily managed to convince the angel of it. The bed is more than big enough for the both of them, as they lie facing each other in the dark.
“Welcome to Sunday Brunch, Agnes,” Sarah announces, as the women settle down at her dinner table. It’s been a while since they had another brunch, but it was long-awaited. Today, a new face sits at the table with them.
They all settle in the living room: Cas and Dean on the couch, Mary and Sam seated in each of the armchairs, and Jack sitting cross-legged on the floor. It may not be much, but it’s their own little screwed-up family. While Sam gets them beers from the fridge, Dean considers putting his arm around Cas. They haven’t had time to label their relationship yet, but they’re both too old to play games. So, Dean decides to go with his gut and wraps his arm around Castiel’s shoulder. The returned smile lets him know it was a good decision.
Dean takes a deep breath, looking over to the familiar blue eyes, and the truth slips easily over his tongue.
The blue eyes in front of him blink shortly, before glancing down towards Dean’s lips. Alright, that’s a start. Before he can overthink the situation, Dean leans forward. He can hear Cas make a surprised sound as their lips crash in the middle. The first touch feels strange. It’s been a while since Dean’s last kiss, but Castiel’s lips feel surprisingly soft against his. It’s not until Cas finally kisses him back that the kiss turns from
“Dean? Is it really you?” asks the familiar voice, and Dean freezes in place. Elliot looks pleasantly surprised, before walking over to him and Cas. He points at the car with a smile. “I should have recognized your car”
Everything Dean left behind, after being stabbed by Metatron. As a demon, life is simpler. If he wants something, Dean just takes it. And tonight, he wants to do something, he’s been curious about for quite some time:
Cas looks beautiful, Dean notices as he watches his best friend talking to his guests. He’s wearing a light blue dress shirt and a pair of dark jeans, and Dean makes a mental note to thank his brother for finally getting Cas out of his usual outfit. Then he remembers it means Sam took Cas shopping at some point, and Dean’s gratitude turns sour in his mouth.
The young woman at the reception barely glances away from the little tv, as they ask for a room with a single king-size bed. The key feels heavy in Dean’s hand, as they head towards their room. Cas must feel his discomfort because he puts his hand on the hunter’s shoulder.
“Guess we're heading back to the motel,” Dean finally decides, before clumsily standing up from the couch. If it weren’t for the awful neighbors, this place might actually be nice. The furniture for one thing is comfortable enough. And the closet sure gave him a few ideas what to do with Cas in the future. He takes a few steps towards the door until he notices something is missing. “Cas, you coming?”
“Well, tell Sam I said hi,” she comments cheerfully, as she finally leaves them alone again. Silence falls over the table, only disturbed by the noise of the diner around them. Dean can feel Castiel’s watchful eyes on him, but he’s not ready to face them yet. He might not believe in fate or destiny, but the disturbance came just at the right time. A few seconds more and he might have destroyed the best friendship he had his entire life.
“That’s so disgusting…,” John exclaims with a sour look on his face. Dean thinks about arguing, because he truly enjoys the food, but realizes in time his father wasn’t talking about the food. His eyes are fixed on two men, who occupy seats at the counter. Their legs and shoulders brush each other, and they exchange knowing smiles. Dean doesn’t know why, but their behavior reminds him of his parents; back when they were still a happy family. But now, his dad seems everything else than happy.
Castiel grunts in frustration. “What are you suggesting then, Dean? There must be something we can do…”
“Whatever, old man. But if you ever want to tie the knot, just call me,” she says, shrugging with her shoulder. When Dean looks at her with a raised eyebrow, she continues. “I’m actually a licensed officiant, not that it would matter for you two anyways. Could marry you just like that –“
“Can I talk to you about something? In private?” His voice sounds strangely scared and shaky. He is afraid of something, Charlie realizes, before she nods.
It’s the closest he has ever gotten to admitting it. He came close with Charlie one time, both of them drunk on the crappy ale sold during the LARP-Event. But the words got tangled on his tongue, and she thought for the rest of the night he was bi-lingual. He never corrected her. Sometimes, when he and Sam drive through the night, the confession sits on the tip of his tongue.
Eric was part of one of those cases. Dean remembers the nerdy little kid, barely sixteen years old, and how they had to interview him about the death of his mother. Sam suspected a demon, but Dean wasn’t that sure. He might not know the family, but he surely knew the signs of an angry family father. He knew them far too well…Dean decided to talk to Eric, while Sam would interview the younger siblings.
“You and Dean? Don’t worry, I’m not judging. Can’t really judge, you have no idea what happened since I left heaven…”
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel replies before taking a seat in the other chair, where Dean already offers him a beer. Their movie nights are comfortable; it feels easy. Sometimes Cas joins him while watching the British-Sci-Fi show, and leaves comments about the historical errors. But today, Castiel is awfully quiet. The Doctor and Rose fight Daleks and Cyberman in London, and Rose ends up in a parallel universe. Dean would never admit it, but his heart breaks a bit as they say goodbye on a cold and lonely beach. Dean doesn’t dare to speak, not knowing what to say, but luckily Castiel starts talking.
Back in the Bunker, Sam is looking for his brother. Dean went out with Cas a while ago and they have not returned yet. Even through the world was safe, Sam still got anxious. Just as he thought about calling Deans phone, the door opens with a creaky sound. Dean and Castiel enter the Bunker, both smiling. Sam immediately notices their interlinked hands and smiles too. He always suspected their “profound bond” would be even more special.
“This is my brother Dean,” Sam introduces him, and Dean tries his best to give a fake smile and nod politely at the boring stories the neighbors tell him. This is going to be a long evening…
“Fags,” he scolds, before turning around and leaving the diner with Sam and Dean. When Dean turns his head, he sees one of the strange men crying, while the other rubs his back in a comforting manner.
Dean’s hands shake when he slips the ring onto Castiel’s finger. It’s only now that he realizes they only got one ring, but before Dean can freak out, the angel pulls another golden band from his pocket.
The biggest smile flashes over Dean’s face, and Cas returns it just as much. A moment later, a loud shout draws their attention over to the cabin, where Claire is cheering in a way, that reminds them far too much of Dean. And when they tell everyone else, the mood just keeps going up.
Crowley waits by the door when Dean finally leaves the bar. He looks rather displeased, almost like they had a date and Dean missed it. The demon ignores the sour look and gives Crowley a half-hearted wave instead.
“Don’t worry, Dean. I’ll watch over you,” Cas whispers and it’s the last thing Dean hears before slipping into sleep. He doesn’t feel the trenchcoat gently being laid over his body, or how his head later settles on Castiel’s shoulder. Dean may hate taking the train, but this journey turned out to be one of his best yet.
Quietly, Cas slips out through the back door of the cabin. The cold night air sends goosebumps down his body, but it’s a welcome change from the forced happiness inside. With a sigh, the ex-angel finds himself sitting down on the patio and starting to roll a joint. His hands seem shakier than usual, and he has to start over several times. Usually, he only shivers like this after nightmares find their way in his dreams again. When he finally manages to roll a decent blunt, the door behind him opens with a creak. From the corner of his eye, Cas catches a familiar figure, which moves to sit beside him.
“You don’t have to believe me; I just need your support for this. Most hunters don’t even know what they need for the spell. But it’s all in this book!”
Dean almost feels guilty, whenever he leaves the cabin in the early morning. The camp is still mostly sleeping, and the few guards don’t pay attention to the insides of their grounds. Sometimes, Cas asks him to stay, only for a few minutes longer. But Dean refuses every time, knowing the first people will soon stalk the area. If they saw Dean coming out of Cas’s cabin…
If he hadn’t acted like a child, he might have been the one standing beside Cas at that moment. He would have been the one holding his hand, laughing at his jokes, and maybe even pressing soft kisses on Castiel’s cheek. Nobody would even question their act, he’s sure of that. And then his mind kept wandering, back to the memory of Cas showing off his kissing skills. Except now it wasn’t Meg, but himself getting pinned against the wall.
Dean shakes his head. All his life was black and white, not really a place for a middle ground. Dead or Alive. Monster or Human. Gay or Straight.
It appears like everybody in the hunter community got the invitation: Sam and Eileen, Mary, Donna, the Banes twins, even Garth and Bess together with their kids. It’s not often hunters get to celebrate something, so everybody immediately jumped the opportunity. It’s a beautiful day, and at some point, Dean finds himself standing next to Claire.
Later, as Dean drove away from the school, with Castiel’s number in his phone, he explained over a call to his brother the situation with Cas.  That as far as anyone at the school was concerned, Dean was Castiel’s boyfriend, and that he would be there whenever an event of Castiel’s required his presence.  He made sure to let Sam know that he was handling it great, that he was getting paid.  Basically, that there was nothing to worry about.  He got it.
from the Winchesters, couldn’t you?  I have no reason to kill you, Castiel.  But if those brothers come after me, they’re going to see the state you’re in and know that I can do worse.  That I’ve got your life right.  Under.  My.  Finger,” he said, pulling out a feather to emphasize each of his finishing words.  Castiel didn’t try to say anything back.  He knew of Asmodeus’s capabilities.  He knew it was all too possible that he had no way of escape or of receiving help.  His only comforting thought was that Lucifer might receive worse treatment soon enough.  After all, no one cared about Lucifer.
Melinda rolls her eyes at the hunter before turning to Castiel.  “I wasn’t aware that you were already in a relationship.  This explains a lot...I think you can do better, though.”
Dean pulled away after a few more minutes, and looked down at his angel.  He looked adorable, all out of breath, and with rosy cheeks. If you asked Dean, Castiel himself was a Christmas miracle.
The first thing to do is pretty obvious.  Or so Dean thinks, as far as he can think while not knowing where Cas is, if he’s okay.  Dean drives to the store, because he’s lucky that they only have one that they regularly go to.  It’s
Oh.  Dean didn't think he'd get anything out of him.  He wasn't sure if the question was a good thing or a bad thing.  After asking, Cas bent over to pick up the mixtape and then placed it on the dresser by his bed.  The action gave Dean the perfect opportunity to stare without being caught. Every feature of the angel was lovely to him, from his hands to his eyes to the shape of his shoulders.
He continued to enjoy this view until Castiel was blinking up at him, which Dean found adorable.  It was impossible to resist kissing all over that sleepy face.  Castiel enjoyed this very much, and after he was woken up enough to fully reciprocate, he led Dean’s mouth to his and parted his own lips as an offering.  Morning breath be damned, Dean took it with enthusiasm.
His hands are tight on the wheel, and there’s no music.  When he arrives he’s in a rush, and he isn’t sure anymore what he asked Cas to get, though he imagines pie must have been on the list.  Not that it matters.  Dean hopes that he is going to walk in and find the angel examining labels and ingredients with squinted eyes, making sure that he gets the best option available to him, not that Dean knows what would actually qualify something as the best option.  He walks quickly once he’s inside, checking every aisle.  This gives him nothing, so he starts to talk to all of the people at the cash registers, which are thankfully not too many, and the second one Dean went to had seen Cas.
The table is quiet once more. Everyone is pretty drunk at this point and Castiel seemingly forgot it’s his turn to ask. Dean can’t look away from him, while Cas looks everywhere but him. Charlie clears her throat.
“Uhhh – Lunch break,” Castiel answers stiffly, his eyes shortly glancing over to Dean. The hunter seems to have grown smaller by the second, as he fiddles with the menu.
crosses Dean’s mind. He is just about to turn around and leave, when the door opens, and a young man walks out. He is around Dean’s age and doesn’t even notice the hunter, until they crash together.
“Well, next time you look over to him, give him a small smile. Not too extreme, just a little hint to show you’re interested. But don’t constantly stare at him, just look over every now and then.” Dean tries to sound confident as he explains the 101 of flirting to the angel. If he could walk Charlie through this, he might also be able to help Cas.
Carefully, Dean opens one of his eyes and looks at his brother, who just shrugs his shoulders and mouths “
“Didn’t that lady get ditched on an island?” Dean asks with a smile on his lips, and Cas can’t help but raise an eyebrow. He didn’t take Dean for the type to know classic mythology, but then again, the Winchesters know a lot of old lore. And Dean is always good for a surprise.
The men moved in today, only a few days after the last tenants died in a horrible and tragic accident involving the lawnmower and a malfunctioning electric wire. Tammy doesn’t like to admit it, but she always knew those two didn’t fit the neighborhood. Sarah brought it up several times at Sunday Brunch, and as it turned out, the entire neighborhood held a grudge against the deceased couple. At least the house still looked well enough to get sold almost immediately again.
“Maybe one of us could team up with Mom?” Dean suggests but cringes once the words leave his mouth. “Urgh, never mind. I’m not very strong on the Oedipus thing.”
“He’s not a good mate, trust me,” Dean simply states, drowning the rest of his beer shortly after. Finding a suitable man for Cas is surely not a task he can do sober.
“Uh-Uh, no way I’m getting fake-married to Cas!” Dean protests once he finds the ability to speak again. His reaction was apparently a bit harsh, judging by the looks both Cas and Sam give him.
“I’m Castiel, but Cas works fine,” he explains. “There’s a nice coffee place around the corner, we could wait there.”
He isn’t even wearing his trenchcoat; instead, Cas is clothed in a white button-down and jeans. Without hesitation, Dean steps closer. His hands find Castiel’s cheek and their lips meet in the middle. The motion feels normal; like they’ve done this a thousand times over already.
“Will you marry me? Tonight? I know, you actually deserve a much better proposal and a wedding that doesn’t take place in flannel, but I love you so very very much”
“If I were only twenty years younger…,” Beth starts, earning a peal of laughter from the women around her. “He’s very handsome, that’s true.”
It’s been two months since Cas’s sacrifice and his love confession. Two awful months filled with alcohol, and tears, defeating god, and nearly getting impaled on a rusty nail. The stitch on Dean’s torso still hurts, where the nail grazed his left side open. Luckily, it had missed all important organs and Sam was able to rush him into the hospital for stitching. None of them want to mention it, but Jack is probably still looking out for them.
Castiel used to love watching Earth. There’s something peaceful about observing humanity evolving, something he could never put in any words. After decades of regarding humans, some things should be considered dull. And yet, he still loved watching the sunrise, or the carefree laughter of children. He loved how there’s no way bumblebees should be able to fly and how they still do. And then he pulled Dean Winchester out of hell, and everything changed.
“Bet you still did an amazing job without me,” Dean returns, an honest smile on his lips. He holds his beer towards her, and she clinks it with her own.
It feels like yesterday, Dean thinks to himself, while he just orders a slice of apple pie. Castiel happily orders the same. They sit in silence for a while, but it’s not awkward. It’s the comforting kind of silence you only have with your loved ones. Dean looks over at the angels neatly folded hands on the table, and he must look away again. It would be too easy to just reach over and hold Castiel’s hand.
Retiring might be not something Dean ever considered, but it surely seems nice enough if Cas would be by his side.
Retiring was never something Dean seriously considered. Their lives were too busy anyway, and how would retirement even look like? Dean tries to picture a little house with a white picket fence and a bench on the patio. Now add a beautiful wife and some screaming kids, and it would be the perfect dream for most men. But Dean knows it’s not for him. He’d always be a hunter first, no matter how much he would try to leave it all behind. Normal people could never understand why he’d keep a gun with silver bullets in his drawers or buys salt in bulk packages. He tried with Lisa before, but normal life doesn’t do it for him.
It’s been months since the case that started their relationship, and they never spared another thought to those nosy neighbors. Dean suspects the rumors they started that night, but he couldn’t care less. Once the town disappeared from the Impala’s rearview mirror, none of them ever spared another thought to the neighborhood. Dean and Castiel couldn’t be happier, and that’s all that matters to them.
Tyler's business card is still in one of his drawers, neatly tucked away behind some old shirts. Sometimes, Dean looks at it, but he never calls. As a demon, he did a lot of things he regretted. His bathroom-adventure with Tyler might not be one of those, but he still tries to forget those months of his life. They still haunt him in nightmares and calling the guy would feel like a flashback to those times.
“There are one hundred billion angels?” Dean asks surprised, his eyes shortly wandering over to Cas.
it. Sam is sitting with his arm wrapped around Eileen, laughing at one of Bobbys jokes. At a different table, Charlie shows Claire something on her phone, before both burst out laughing. Some people slap Deans back as he walks by and mutter a “Congratulations” to him. Dean is happy, happier than he has been for a while. But why does something inside hurt when he sees Cas?
This chapter came very close from my heart, some sentences and situations are directly taken from my own life. I can count on one hand how many people know i am bisexual, so this chapter (and maybe the entire fic) feels sort of like therapy. There is still some story left to tell and i hope you'll be there to read it :)
“This got nothing to do with Fernando, this is about me and Cas!” Dean replies with an angry voice, before taking Castiel’s palm into his own hands. Cas gives him a quick squeeze, and Dean decides to have at least a little fun with the situation.
“Aren’t you supposed to be at work, Cas?” Beth asks, an obnoxious tone hidden under her sweetly sick smile. Right, Dean remembers, they told everyone Cas works at the library. Good enough of an excuse to spend their time there.
The quotes for the letters are taken from songs, that remind me of Supernatural (Florence And The Machine - No Light, No Light; Orla Gartland - Oh God; Avicii - Hey Brother; Amber Run - Heaven Is A Place)
“Yeah - This way, we know you’ll survive it, won’t get any diseases, and get at least the attempt of a good time,” Dean shrugs, trying to make it sound like it’s not a big deal. Which it really isn’t. Cas needs to sleep with a human, Dean is a human – it’s a genius plan.
“Uncomfortable?”, chokes Dean. His heart is racing. Castiel said it again like it’s the easiest thing in the world.
In the end, they just needed to pray. Turns out, Jack already saved Castiel from the Empty and they started rebuilding heaven together. And there he is, Castiel, angel of the fucking lord, just casually standing in their kitchen.
, he wants to answer, but the words get stuck in his throat. This isn’t the time or the place for romantic feelings or committed relationships. Any day could be their last, and nobody knows this better than Dean.
Castiel looks shocked, his mouth slightly opened. It honestly looks adorable, and Dean can’t help but laugh. Still smiling, he pulls the angel into a tight hug.
“Because I was too stupid to realize it for the longest time. And then I just didn’t know how to say it,” Dean admits. He came close to confessing in the diner, but Beth interrupted them and afterward, Dean felt ashamed and stupid.
Once again, Dean is surprised by the refusal. It’s almost like Cas doesn’t even want his help in the matter, and the hunter can’t help but feel slightly offended. After all, Cas asked him for his help and now he won’t even acknowledge his suggestions. The door opens and a gorgeous redhead enters the bar. Her curly hair falls perfectly over her shoulders, as she walks seductively towards the counter. On her way, she catches sight of Castiel, and even shoots a hinted smile in his direction.
There’s the beginning of a bright smile on Castiel’s face, and Dean swears his heart skips a beat when the words finally dawn on him. Before Dean can overthink the situation, he presses closer to the angel and is relieved when Cas is doing the same. And then their faces meet in the middle. Kissing Cas is the easiest thing in the world, it turns out. Whatever Dean was so afraid of, is right forgotten once their lips slot together.
It's a normal Thursday night when Dean finds his way into his Dean-Cave. They might have the whole bunker for themselves, but even so he still sometimes needed the quiet of this room. He doesn’t even realize Cas followed him until Dean spots him in the door frame.
“Why would you show me this?”, Dean yells, his voice hoarse from his screams. Alistair just gives him a raised eyebrow before a bitter laugh erupts from him.
If Dean’s lungs weren’t burning with pain, he might have shouted after it. But it’s no good. The train slowly disappears in the distance, and they are left standing at the emptying gate. Slowly, Dean tries to catch his breath again as the other guy does the same. It’s only now he’s realizing they are still holding hands, and Dean gently pulls his hand away.
In this moment, Dean couldn’t care less about any portals or weapons or defeating God. He doesn’t care if Sam believes their lie tomorrow, or if he and Cas will ever share a bed again.
“I’m just glad you’re finally out of the closet,” Sam shoots back with a grin. Dean already knows it’s a joke he’ll hear a thousand times in the upcoming years, but when he looks over at Cas, it sure is a price worth paying.
Castiel seems surprised and manages to nod a little. Dean knows, Charlie is looking at them leaving, but he will not look back. It’s time to finally look forward.
“You good?” Ty asks, still holding still. His hands are caressing the exposed skin, circling in smooth motions. Dean nods slightly and presses out a short “Yeah”, as Ty presses a soft kiss onto his neck.
The thought crosses Dean every now so often. He remembers how John used to talk about gay people, and it still hurts almost 20 years later. But then again, his Dad would have hated a lot of things that became normal for him
Next thing he knows, there’s a steady hand on his back and he feels something big push inside of him. It probably should hurt, but Dean’s pain tolerance isn’t on a human scale anymore. Or the guy just knows what he is doing. It’s a moment until the push stops, and he just feels the pressure. Dean has to admit, there’s certainly an appeal to the whole thing.
Once in the Impala, Dean is glad Sam decided to stay in with Jack tonight. Nothing is a worse mood kill than Bigfoot preaching about consent in the passenger seat. Still, he and Cas drive in silence, only letting the music play in the background. Soon enough, Dean parks the car in front of one of his favorite bars. A few years back, he visited it weekly, always taking a hookup back to the Impala or the nearby motel. Cas already wants to leave the car, but Dean grabs his arm in time.
“What is wrong? There are so many beautiful women here and you aren’t looking bad either today, pal. Just choose one, and I’ll start the conversation for you.”
“We can’t be sure yet, but I bet something is going on. Dean surely looked rather unhappy every time he saw Sam touching his hubby. And Cas got some serious heart-eyes for his brother-in-law.”
“So…”, Charlie begins and looks at their little group. “Since it’s Castiel’s first time playing, I’m gonna let him start. Castiel, truth or dare?”
“What? It’s not like we are going to screw him. We’ll just go to the bar and find him a nice lady. Simple as that.”
Dean’s breath stops for a second. He spoke with a lot of people about his upcoming death: Sam, Bobby, Jo, Ellen, and other hunters. But none of them ever said they were sorry about it. When Dean doesn’t reply, Elliot keeps talking.
And wow, that just fucking hurts. Dean never understood what “heartbreak” truly meant, until he lost Castiel. With every loss, his heart felt a little more broken. But seeing the sadness in Castiel’s face…it feels like his heart isn’t even capable of more damage; it’s just completely gone. Jack says something to Castiel, who answers quietly.
Cas doesn’t even try to hide the sharpness in his voice. They haven’t seen each other in ages, and this is the first thing Gabriel wants to talk about? Gabriel looks at him with raised eyebrows, as if his intention is obvious.
“I thought, we could take a little trip down memory lane today…,” Alistair purrs with a fake smile. Dean doesn’t answer. Whatever is coming next, won’t be nice. “Let’s talk about your boyfriends”
“Whatever you need, buddy,” Dean replies, while trying to hide a winning grin. Besides him, Sam just shakes his head in disbelief. If they survive their upcoming fight with Chuck, Dean will forever tease his brother about him winning this argument.
He also knows Cas’s vessel is very attractive. But those two things – his attraction to men and his profound bond with Cas – were never something he considered might be related. But thinking about Cas kissing him – it’s something Dean never knew he wanted that much. When the sight of the happy couple got too much for him to bear, Dean excused himself to get a drink. Only then he remembered they are actually on a job, and he’s supposed to be on the watch out for possible bad guys.
“There must be someone in your family who did the deed with a human - What about Gabriel? I’m sure he made some, uh, bonds with humans.”
means to him. He wants to assure it’s not just random hook-ups or pointless distractions, but none of this ever comes out. Every morning, he is left standing speechless. Every morning, he leaves without saying as much as a thank you. But not today.
The suggestion takes Dean by surprise. Cas wants to go to a brothel? With a sigh, Dean remembers the last time they visited a place like that, and how uncomfortable Cas was. In hindsight, it might’ve been just gay panic. Are there even male prostitutes, who sleep with other men? Dean is sure they exist, but he has no idea where they would get one in the middle of Kansas on a Thursday night.
Cas just shakes his head, before heading outside. Dean joins him moments later, still laughing over his own joke. The bar is rather busy for a Thursday night, but they manage to find an open table at the side of the room. Dean sends Cas ahead to save the place, while he grabs them drinks at the bar.
“Fuck Cas – I’m…”, the hunter stutters, but his words are cut off by an open-mouthed kiss. Moments later, Dean comes with a muffled moan. He can feel his cum hit his chest; except it appears more than usual. Castiel’s body is shaking under his hands, and Dean finally realizes Cas also came. He’s never climaxed at the same time as his partner before, and the feeling is monumental.
“How long are you two been together?”, she asks while handing out the menus. Dean almost chokes on his beer, but Castiel just gives the waitress a kind smile.
“I’ve had a voice like you in my head my entire life, whispering awful things about myself,” Dean tells her, keeping eye contact as he pulls the angel blade out of her bleeding chest. “But now, that I’m finally happy, do you know what happens to this voice?”
Sam’s harsh breath snaps Dean’s attention to his brother, who waves him and Castiel over to his place in the library. “Check this out, guys!”
The man in the trenchcoat is a few steps ahead of him, throwing worried glances back every now and then. Dean probably sounds like he is dying soon, his wheezing drowning out the noise around them. He’s ready to give up here and now, but suddenly a hand closes around his and he is pulled forward. Usually, he’d overthink holding hands with a stranger, but the adrenaline rush puts his focus only on their common goal.
Nobody cares to comment about it, but Dean can see Castiel shift in his seat. The topic makes him obviously uncomfortable, but he tries to keep it cool. And Dean – Dean just drowns his liquor and pours himself another glass. They play some more rounds, until Jack is up again. Of course, he picks Castiel and when the former angel chooses Truth, Jack looks at him with big eyes.
“Thanks for having me,” Agnes replies with a shy smile, as she glances around at the other women. “It’s wonderful to have such nice and caring neighbors, my old neighborhood was so scandalous…”
“No, they threw Sam out of the house and then had sex in the bed Sam used to sleep in. How tasteless of them,” Sarah corrects her immediately.
Dean is taken aback for a second. Who the hell is Fernando? It’s only then when Dean remembers their lesser-used codewords. He can still recall how he wrote it down in his own leatherbound journal:
“I don’t know. Part of me probably knew for years, but I never allowed myself to think about it. There was always another apocalypse, another hunt, another big obstacle in our way. Losing Cas as a friend was already hard enough, but to lose him as a…partner? That would have crushed me. But then he said he loves me and all I wanted to do was scream at him “
“Umm, okay. I can do that, okay…,” Dean mumbles, more to himself than to his friend. Once again, his eyes scan the room before them. He quickly notices a few men, who could be considered handsome - at least as far as Dean can tell; he’s straight after all.
“I killed her, and I let her blood covered me like an embrace that she never would have given to me by choice.  And I cursed all of her daughters, and all of their daughters, and so on.  I am certain...that they all must have had her beautiful face.  I cursed them, so that they would all meet their deaths by the hands of a demon.  It’s still out there, her blood.  I can feel it.  Just a little bit of it, now.  A small child, it must be, a little girl.  She could be the end of it.  Or she might not be.”
Castiel feels at a loss as he regards the pies at the store, knowing that Dean had asked for apple specifically.  There is no apple.  Years ago he would have burned the entire establishment to the ground, but he has developed more respect over time for people in general, and understands that it is no one’s fault.  This is not an attack against him.  He gets cherry.
Dean smiled.  “I’m glad you’re okay...So um, we need to get your wings back in uh, back in your back, right?”
Castiel’s cheeks were pink.  “Yes, that was very okay.  And, it’s okay.  You don’t have to...say anything.  You never have to say anything.  I want you to feel comfortable.”
“That would be best.  Unless I were to stay in the bunker at all times, which of course would not be ideal.  I should probably stay here until we figure out how to put them back in the correct plane of existence.  If that would be okay, of course,” Castiel added.  Not that he would really need anything, or be noticed, but it was hard not to feel like just existing was a burden.
It was because of this that he didn’t feel too overwhelmed with guilt when, while holding Jack one day, the little guy babbled to him, and then something came out of his mouth that Castiel was almost certain was a variation of
Castiel is staring right at Dean.  It means a lot to him, that Dean has come to get him.  To save him, it seems, not that he needs saving.
Dean made sure to dispose of the rest of their clothes as quickly as possible before picking Cas up and carefully depositing him onto the bed.  While he may have come off as impatient before, Dean made sure that Castiel was more than ready for him by the time he was sliding into him, touching him reassuringly, telling him that he loved him.  Castiel gasped a little bit at first, but soon enough he was craving more and more of Dean, his appreciative noises urging him to keep going.  At some point after the thrusts developed a steady pace, Cas asked if Dean still had some of the raspberry jelly that he loved in the fridge.
The blade plunged down, and it made its way almost completely through his wing before it was pulled out, revealing shining grace beneath the skin.  Still, Castiel continued.
And then it was Dean at the door, of course, and before Castiel could even say anything, he was being told by Dean that he had started going to therapy, and finally, finally that he was sorry.  And then he wouldn’t stop talking.  Castiel wasn’t sure if he even had any specific words to respond with, but if he had, he didn’t think that he would’ve been able to get any in.  It looked to him like Dean was struggling to breath, and maybe the reason he would hardly give himself a break was because he was scared that Castiel would ask him to leave as soon as he gave him a chance to.  Dean explained that he got Kelly’s address from Lucifer after going to the Novaks’ place in search of him, and begging them to tell him where he was.
Castiel shrank in on himself.  “I’m sorry...I’m sorry.”  Dean blinked, and then moved forward in the chair.
Despite the attitudes of some of the Novaks, the inappropriate jokes from Gabriel, and Ruby, just in general, they had a nice dinner, and Michael put on some classical music after while they chatted.  The conversation bounced around from when the wedding might be, to the prospect of Anna moving out and in with Ruby, and then to questions directed towards Lucifer about whether he and his girlfriend were currently on or off.
It was hesitant, he was tired, when he did eventually agree with his counselors’ demands, and a new law was passed.
"Hey, Cas?" His voice was already uneven.  His gaze went from their hands to the eyes of the angel that had saved him from hell so many years ago.  The angel that would never abandon him.
Dean parked far away enough so that no one would be asking why they hadn’t come or left together.  He offered Cas a ride home, but was declined.  Politely, but it still stung, and he sat in his car, watching Castiel from there until he was picked up by an Uber, since there was no way he would have left Cas out in the dark by himself.  And because Dean still was worried about him, since he wasn’t sure what kind of a driver Cas might have gotten, some of them could have been creeps, or crazy, he texted Cas and asked to be let know when he was home and safe.
“Oh,” he whispered to no one.  His wings were like tree branches with only a few leaves left, unfit to bear fruit.  The shame he felt when picturing how Dean must have looked at them, at him, was unavoidable.  He relaxed his body again and brought his eyes to Dean, who was shifting in his seat.
"Castiel, huh? That's a pretty cool name...sounds kind of familiar, actually...I think I'll stick with sunshine though, that all right with you?"
While the dresses were being made, Castiel, with the help of his animal friends, had made a giant disguise made of feathers and fur.  He put it on, took a bag of his things, snuck out the window, ran, and never looked back.
Castiel made sure that it was known that he loved every part of Dean too, turning to face him, still in his arms.
Castiel just nodded.  Not much else happened for them that night, and Dean wanted to punch himself for not making more happen, but he simultaneously felt like he didn’t deserve more, and like he was definitely going to be miserable if he kept letting that be an excuse.
The hope was, of course, that the law would be cancelled out, and their father would be unable to marry.  Only Chuck knew how far the law went, though.  Desperate enough for power not to care, Lucifer grabbed the ring from Michael and put it on.  Or tried to, anyways.  His fingers were too thick, and the piece of jewelry was only halfway on before it could go no further.
Whenever they were given the opportunity, Lucifer and Michael pulled on their little brother’s hair, pulled at his clothing, shoved him, and nearly anything else they could think of to try and have some type of control over him.  Somehow, Castiel managed to stay kind.  He would never stoop to their level.  Of course, though, he would not mind if those two somehow ended up locked in the cellar.  For a week, at least.
Lucifer did not look at him.  His eyes were trained on the people.  “When someone does, it will be nothing but a slap in the face...Surely there must be something we can do.”
The hand on top of his went completely slack for a moment and Dean was pretty sure he stopped breathing, but then the grip tightened and he was given the most gigantic smile he'd ever seen on Cas's face.
It all started at a party.  It was kind of a party, outside, it was a gathering, really.  At Sam’s college.  Dean had tagged along, looking for drinks and possibly someone to give him a rush.  Soon after arriving, they got a call from their dad, who still treated them like they were kids.  Less than that, tools.  And he was angry that one of his tools was no longer at his disposal, and concerned that he would fully be losing the other one soon enough.
Asmodeus looked over the symbol that he’d carved into Castiel’s back with interest.  It had been done quite well.  All he had to do now was say the right words, apply the right amount of pressure at the circle right there…
“Hello, Dean.  Sam.”  Castiel’s eyes settled on Dean, as they often did, though with some hesitation.
Dean paused as he asked this, and Castiel did not appreciate this.  He forgot about the jelly completely, squirming a little, spreading his legs even further apart, if possible.
On the first day of the new year, Dean went over his resolutions.  He had never made a list before, but his wishes all centered around a very important part of his life, so he decided that changes would have to be made.  He'd never wanted anything as much as he wanted Cas. Cas's happiness. Cas's permanent presence. Cas.
Castiel then asked Dean if he ate any of the jelly, and then he cried out, proceeded to ask if Dean preferred strawberry or raspberry, and praised the cock inside of him, all in rather quick succession.
Dean managed to get into his room without his brother’s assistance while still carrying Cas.  He laid him onto the bed, putting him on his stomach because he was still concerned about his wings more than anything else.  His back was also injured.  His left wing was worse than the right one.  It looked tired, and lacked feathers for the most part, like it was never capable of being used.  They were still beautiful, though, Dean couldn’t help but think.  They were giant wings!  Dean would be freaking out over how cool that was if he wasn’t so worried.
Once they were out of Sam and Eileen’s place, Dean had been heading back to his car and thinking of what he could say, when he was stopped by a gentle hand on his shoulder.  “We can go on foot from here, Dean.”  Castiel turned and began to walk away.  So Dean followed.
Then Dean started coming home late, drunk, and angry, always angry, or just delirious.  Castiel took care of him.  He always took care of Dean.  Later, he found out that Dean had been going out drinking with some guy named Benny.  Just a friend.  And Castiel trusted Dean.  He really did.  But it was getting harder and harder to go on, going to bed without Dean, he couldn’t sleep.  They weren’t really sleeping together much at all any more, in any way.  Castiel wanted to give Dean what he wanted, space.  But...that wasn’t what he truly wanted, what he, the way he saw it, selfishly, wanted.  What he selfishly wanted was to feel loved again.
“I’m his wife,” she supplies, looking straight at Dean now, her chin raised, lips a straight line.  She allows the dark markings on her skin to be visible.
Castiel comforted her of course, considering Kelly a good friend by this point.  Eventually, she asked him if he could babysit Jack while she went out with some friends, which she clearly had not done in quite some time.
Castiel wasn’t sure what it was that he was pretending Jack had just said to him.  But Jack sort of giggled up at him afterwards, so he figured he had said the right thing.  Jack suddenly looked away from him when there was a knock at the door.  Castiel squinted his eyes, confused since the only person he could think of that might be seeking Kelly out would be Lucifer, probably to seduce his way back into her heart somehow.  He moved to go set Jack down in his crib before going to open the door, still not entirely sure what to expect.
Allowing a wave of happiness to overtake him, Dean imagined a future with Cas, where they're together and there are never any doubts about where they're meant to be.  Because they're there now. Looking down at his hand, he wondered what it would be like if there was a ring there. If they could be married. Perhaps he would have to add that to his resolutions list.
Castiel turned to Dean and tilted his head in that way of his that over the years never ceased to be adorable.  “Yes, Dean?”  As always, Castiel was ready to do anything that Dean wished, give him whatever was missing that was preventing his Heaven from being complete.
Slowly, Dean sat down on the edge of the bed, and brought two fingers to Castiel’s temple.  There was a heartbeat.  Not terribly faint, either.  Dean sighed.  He kept looking at Cas.  The angel looked so exhausted, even while asleep.
"I've been in love with you for years as well.  After what happened between us, I had lost all hope of reciprocation."
“You know where Cas is.  I know you do.  You think you’re believable?  After that evil twin crap you just pulled?  No.”
One night, Castiel stayed up, sitting on the couch until Dean came home, and when he did, he just stared up at him.  Dean raised an eyebrow at him, almost as though he were insulted to find Castiel in their home.
Dean just scoffed.  And without really realizing what he was doing, he started to highlight why he didn’t think the idea was ridiculous.  Cas was pretty great, talked really smart, oh, and he was a literature major, why not throw that in.  Cas was really great at maintaining a conversation, and even if what he said lost any flow that it might have had, it was always more than funny enough to make up for it.  The things that dude talked about.  And Castiel’s hair was really soft too, Dean sure wouldn’t have minded getting to touch it again.  And again, the way he talked, the way they talked with each other, there was a rhythm to it, and the way they touched too, or just looked at each other.  There was nothing else like it.
Eventually, there was a three-nights ball being held in the castle.  Dean, being the heir to the throne, was expected by his parents to eventually find a wife...or husband.  They didn't really care, but they didn't want him to rule alone.  Several women and men flirted with him throughout the night, but he dismissed them all.
“Hello, Castiel,” he says, voice firm but his eyes a little nervous.  He’s staring.  And then, he remembers something, perking up a little.  He’s young.  “I am Oliver.  The Queen has requested to see you.”  Oliver wants to say more, but he has done his part.
As soon as they were inside, Cas closed the door and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck.  Their noses were nearly touching. Dean wanted to look around the room to see why his angel had been in there for so long earlier, but he was completely captured by Cas's loving gaze.
While Castiel was cleaning a staircase, Dean went to go sit by him.  After spending so much time with the...creature, there was no one else that he would be more comfortable to talk about his feelings with.  Sam would only tease him.  And his parents were simply not an option.
Sam laughed softly and nodded.  “Don’t worry, Dean.  I’ll give him plenty of time with you first.”  With that, Sam retreated into the hallway, likely going to his own room to sleep.  Even with no audience, Dean rolled his eyes at his brother’s words.  It was just because it was Sam, not actually because of what he’d said.  Dean was less and less bothered by the thought of other people thinking of him and Cas as...well, as something.  The eyeroll?  Well, Dean just didn’t like it when someone else had the last word. It also bothered him when Sam was right, or when Sam was acting like Dean was wrong or didn’t know that Sam was right.
He walks out of the store, the plastic bag rustling a little in the wind, and as he makes a turn he finds himself face to face with a man with red hair going to his shoulders, too red to be natural.  The man’s clothing is black, and his shirt is a little too big on him.  Castiel can immediately tell that he is not human.
Castiel nodded, and they found themselves swaying to a soft melody.  He liked having his hand on Dean's shoulder.  It felt...like it belonged there.  Dean's hand on his waist was making his breathing faster, and their other hands being joined made his face feel warm.  The two fit together perfectly, and they held a steady gaze the entire time they danced.  Some guests turned, apparently drawn in by the evident connection that existed between Dean and Castiel.  A connection that required no speech.
Though he was somewhat thrown off by this, Dean just admitted that yes, he still had the jelly.  He couldn’t have brought himself to finish it.  He was aware of how much Cas loved his peanut butter and jelly.
Dean couldn't stop thinking about the man from the night before.  He regretted the fact that he never even got to touch those dark locks, which looked incredibly fluffy.  Or feel those pink lips.  He hoped to see him at tonight's ball, and he kept telling himself that he would.  Smiling all day, he barely even gave Castiel any work.
Castiel is shaking his head even before she is done speaking.  “I am not in a relationship.  Dean does not have those kinds of feelings for me.  I am his best friend.”
The Straggled Hag was not allowed to be at the ball, they were too disgusting for the guests to look at, so Dean couldn't even humor himself by messing with him.  The bored prince was just about to go get another slice of pie when finally someone arrived that got his attention.
Castiel directed Dean on where to go, how to get to where Sam would apparently reside with Eileen.  As he drove, Dean couldn’t help but wonder where it was that
They were holding hands and smiling, but Dean was still scared.  What if Cas still didn't understand? He knew that, according to holiday etiquette or whatever, he had the whole year to complete his resolutions.  But he'd already waited for
Maybe, as Sam assumed, Cas was just different, and he was wrong about the effects of old age on the kind of beings Lucifer and Asmodeus were.  Maybe they were just like people, because as he knew, some people just sucked.  And some people didn’t.
Asmodeus picked up his blade from where it’d been resting on the table and ran the tip of it down the length of Castiel’s wing.  It could be felt most when it went over the uncovered areas, that vulnerable flesh with no feathers as protection.
“I’m sure you wanna fanboy all over his wings.  But when he wakes up, don’t freak him out with all your questions right away, alright?”
Castiel smiled and gently set his hands on Dean’s torso.  He loved Dean and he loved the flowers.  He thought they were beautiful.
Castiel sighs softly.  “I do not see myself marrying again.  I am hopeful that it won’t be necessary.  And that I will not lose my memory again, and for some reason decide to marry the first person I meet.”  He has made various questionable choices over the course of his life, but he’ll never truly never understand that one.  Although, he’d had nothing at the time.  And all that mattered was that he had been reunited with Dean eventually.  Castiel wonders if Daphne has married another strange man by now, and now questions her rather than himself.
“I miss you.  Every goddamn day.  Why aren’t you here with me?”  That one was sober, or at least Castiel really thought it was.  He didn’t call him back, though.  To him, the answer to Dean’s question was rather clear.  And he hadn’t heard what he needed to hear.  But he missed Dean too.  Not the one that he had seen last.  The Dean that had proposed to him, that was who he missed, that was who he was struggling to sleep without.
Asmodeus reached forward and began to undo Castiel’s shirt.  It was all too familiar, getting exposed, for the purpose of one to cut right into his skin.  At least it wasn’t being torn open.
Asmodeus tossed a few shreds of Castiel’s clothing onto the floor, and then drove his blade into Castiel’s back.
Or he thought he did.  When he heard quick steps approaching, he wasn’t quite as sure about anything at all.  He wasn’t thinking about Asmodeus anymore.
Lucifer screamed when Dean pulled the shoe off and passed it over.  It might have just been from the physical pain, but who cared, really?
Waking up with his angel in his arms was already the best present that Dean could've gotten on that special day.
The party was at Sam and Eileen’s house, naturally, and it was a crowded thing, music playing.  A Led Zeppelin song played at some point, and Dean tensed, Castiel stoic besides him, but putting on a smile for the sake of their company.
.  He hugged him.  He hugged the angel that had inspired him to be a better man, no, to keep being the good man that he had been all along.  Who loved him.  Any tension melted away, and Castiel said nothing about what had occurred between them.  He was being kind.  Dean knows this, and now he sees how Cas has always been kind to him.  Not that he hadn’t known it, that Cas was kind, but knowing that it was love behind it, that made him revisit several of their past interactions.
Dean ended up leaving.  He took his time as he made his way back to his car.  Castiel didn’t stop him, but he did make sure to make himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  And another.  And another.  They were comforting.
Castiel paused, a piece of bread in his hand, as he watched Dean finish the last of his ice cream and throw his own trash away.  Once he was looking at Cas again, Dean raised an eyebrow at him playfully.
And then there was a smile on both of their faces, and Cas was wearing a light blue sweater with a penguin on it—underneath the trenchcoat of course—and this was seriously the best Christmas that Dean's had in a long time.  Ever, actually.
It was specifically the thought of Dean’s friend Garth talking the ear off of the most stoic Novak sibling, Michael, when Castiel said it, when he just couldn’t not say it.
"Castiel?!" the brothers both yelled at the same time, and then they stormed out.  The two princes were still looking at each other.
“Cas.”  It was a whisper.  Dean moved quickly, past Sam, and then he had Castiel in his arms, chin hooked over his shoulder.  He felt him tense up at first, but then tentative hands found their way onto his back, like Castiel wasn’t quite sure if he was allowed to touch Dean now that his feelings were out in the open.  It made Dean’s heart ache, and he tightened his arms around the angel.
But then Cas stopped and looked shy once more and added, "unless my vessel makes you uncomfortable.  I will happily be with you in any way that you like."
Dean showed up at the Novaks’ doorstep a few days after he left the first message.  And because he actually had seen this coming, what with the messages, Castiel answered it, to find his...to find Dean, flowers in hand, and a smile that was hanging there by a thread.  It was immediately obvious that Dean hadn’t been doing much better than Castiel.
And as they went to Jody and Donna, Claire and Kaia, who looked quite content together, Patience, Alex, Garth and his family, Charlie and Stevie, Dean had plenty of time to think.
“To wish for suffering, and on one’s descendants as well...I do not believe that stems from love, love cannot, it can’t be controlled, it wasn’t her fault she didn’t want you.  You should have—”
"It's selfish because I know that you deserve better.  Much better than me, maybe if...maybe if you left you could find someone that didn't lash out at you, someone that would let you know every day what you mean to them.  How important you are. But I don't want you to do that. I want that person to be me. I want to be better for you."
These words make Castiel pause, and then blink a few times.  He understands what she means, of course, but he does not want nor know how to answer.  Swallowing, he suddenly wishes that they were not so close.  And he misses the bunker.
Eventually Castiel told himself that it was okay if he asked for things that he was allowed to.  They were going to get married, weren’t they?  He should feel comfortable asking his future husband for things.  But when he asked if they could spend more time together, Dean got defensive.  He needed space.  Castiel realized that he couldn't remember the last time Dean called him sweetheart, or angel.  One night when Dean was actually home before he decided to go out, Castiel tried to get him to let him come with him.  Even though he was definitely not a drinker.
Castiel woke up with a strange blanket on his back, and something else too, sticking to his skin.  He was also on a plush, firm surface, though, so he wasn’t too bothered by it.  Air was directly touching most of his upper body, so he knew he was shirtless.  The blanket was very strange, only covering portions of him.  He made a soft sound and slowly opened his eyes.  The first thing he saw was a sleeping Dean, leaned back in a chair.  It couldn’t have been very comfortable.  Castiel’s eyes shifted to his own back, and he blinked as he saw them, his wings.  He was starting to remember what had happened, why his back felt strange.
So Sam blasted Christmas music through the bunker, and Dean did his best to teach Cas how to make Christmas cookies.  Dean called dibs on all of the ones shaped like angels.
Regardless of all of this, Sam kept his distance, watching as his brother looked at Cas like he looked at cherry pie.  But it wasn’t just attraction, desire, there was fondness there too.  As far as he knew, Dean had never had any real close friends, and so had never seen him smile like this with anyone before.
As far as Dean was concerned, this was all the more reason to warm them up together.  Soon enough he was gently grabbing Castiel’s face and crushing their lips together.  The bread fell from Castiel’s hand.  They ended up surrounded by ducks as they continued to kiss.  Their lips ended up getting very warm.
Sam is much more put together in regards to love, currently on his way to Eileen.  He wanted to do this one, this visit, on his own, with the intention of proving that what he has with her is indeed real.  He doesn’t know that his brother is having a near breakdown in the bathroom, he doesn’t know that Dean knows that Cas loves him.  He does know that Dean loves Cas.  And that Cas loves Dean.  Hope that they can work it out exists alongside his hope that he and Eileen can do the same, though his situation is less complicated in comparison, which in some way comforts him.  He lets it.  They’re all going to be okay, he tells himself.  Their last war has been fought.  This he knows as well.
Dean’s face becomes pained.  “Me, me neither.  I mean, about you...I don’t want you to be...I want it to be me.”
So he was a little bit surprised, but incredibly pleased, when Castiel reached up a hand and cupped his cheek.  Dean leaned into that hand like it was his lifeline.  Maybe it was.  Maybe if Cas let go of him the rain would have dragged him down into one of the big puddles surrounding them.
Castiel blinked and then walked forward, waiting until Michael had backed off to inspect the situation.  The ring was on pretty tight.  With some twisting, and several complaints from Lucifer, Castiel was able to pull off the ring.  It happened to be just at this moment that the brothers heard footsteps.  Their father.  Who would certainly not want anyone to be messing with their mother’s ring.
A knock at the door made him feel nauseous.  He opened it and it was exactly who he'd expected.  If he recalled correctly, and he was certain that he did, the man's name was Crowley.  Castiel clutched his stomach as the planner started talking.
“You...are a being of lust, Asmodeus, not love.  That is how you have been remembered and that is how you will always be remembered.  You are incapable of proving anything else.”
They both attended, of course, and when Dean went right up to Cas as soon as he saw him and explained to him quickly that everyone thought that they were fine, it was understood, and there was no protest when Dean kissed his cheek.  It was cherished by both of them, for they hadn’t touched in quite some time.  Which reminded Dean that it was his fault, that he hadn’t been treating Cas right, that he could’ve touched him so many times when he didn’t, that Cas had felt alone, in what had been their home, because of him.
This was not how Castiel had imagined Dean seeing his wings for the first time.  Which he had only ever imagined in certain fantasies where his wings had somehow recovered, full, and soft.  Glossy, large.  He’d have full control over them.  They wouldn’t be limp and stained with blood from his back.
“You’re gonna have to drive,” Dean mumbled, distracted, as he took his keys out and threw them at Sam.  As he did this he never took his eyes off of Cas.  “He’s gonna be fine, it could have been worse.  He just needs to rest, and, and we’ll figure the wing thing out.”
A tall man, just a little shorter than Dean, came in.  He was wearing a beautiful silk gown that made him look like moonlight seeping into the room.  As the prince was admiring him, he got stuck on his eyes.  Pale blue, framed by dark lashes.  They were out of this world, Dean thought, especially in the lighting.  They looked...familiar, somehow, but he couldn't think about it too much before he felt his legs moving him, all thoughts of pie forgotten.
It was pretty late when they decided it was time to go to bed, with Castiel taking Dean by the hand and eagerly pulling him to their room.
"I want you in every single way Cas, and I've already waited way too long to kiss you.  Can...can I do that now?"
Not too far away from where Dean stood alone, watching his brother leave to answer the phone, were Castiel and Meg, who were both somewhat antisocial, but stepping out of their comfort zones for entirely different reasons.
“You should have been happy to see her with the first husband!  It should have been enough to just know that she was happy.  Just because, just because you want someone, and you want to give yourself to them, do anything for them...you don’t have the right to them at all.  They could feel nothing for you, and you just have to accept that.”
Sam bowed his head a little, pleased to hear this.  He wouldn’t have expected anything different from Heaven.  A good Heaven, crafted by people he loved.
“Sam and Dean Winchester.”  Asmodeus dropped Castiel’s wing, and the blade on top of it, before turning away from the chair.  “What a surprise,” he said.  It clearly wasn’t.  Now that they were there, it was all too clear to him that his usage of Castiel’s voice would never have been enough to keep them away.  Especially with him relying on Ketch to keep them occupied.  He never trusted humans.  Never again.  He’d made a mistake, though not an awfully detrimental one, he thought, as he wasn’t
Jack was perfect, one of the cute, well-behaved babies that made Castiel think that maybe being a father wouldn’t be so bad.
Dean took Castiel to his bedroom and they exchanged stories, him holding his lover tight after he talked about his father.  And then Dean opened up more about his own father, the effects he had on him.  Dean apologized for being rude to Castiel for so long, and Castiel said that he would have plenty of time to make up for it after they were married.  And they both liked that idea very much.
A week after their trip to the park they were arriving at the Novak household, to celebrate the engagement.  Another man in Dean’s place might have been nervous, but he honestly did not care about what Chuck or Castiel’s siblings would think.  They were in love, and happy, and getting married, and that was all that mattered.
“Castiel was playing with the ring,” Lucifer immediately accused, with Michael nodding his head in agreement.
Melinda, also known as the Djinn Queen, keeps touching Cas on the arm and smiling at him, flashing her bright teeth, almost predatory.  He keeps trying to scoot his chair away from her while also maintaining as much politeness as he can.  He had agreed to their union, after all.  Though he had not foreseen that any follow up action would be required.  He had just done what needed to be done.
He was in too much pain to even want to try turning his head, but Castiel knew that Dean was there.  And naturally, Sam must have been there too.  But with Dean, he knew for sure.  Even with his wings as damaged as they’d ever been, and some of his grace exposed, he could feel the flare of Dean’s soul.  He wondered if being in Hell allowed him to feel it more.  It was always so bright, though.  So he couldn’t really tell.  Castiel always felt it pulling at him.
After finishing washing the dishes, Lisa glanced up and out of her window to see two men who appeared to be very caught up in each other.  Why they were locking lips right in front of her home, she had no idea.  One of them looked familiar, she realized.  But it would be wrong to stare, wouldn’t it?  She looked down, ready to walk away from the sink so she wouldn’t be able to see them anymore, but then she remembered.  She was pretty sure, anyways, that one of them had hit her with his car.  When she looked out the window again, the couple was gone.
Their youngest son Samuel didn't speak to him much, at least in the beginning, possibly because he was afraid.  This was because Castiel looked like a beast, covered in the feathers and fur that his animal friends had kindly provided for him.  Castiel was grateful that Samuel was at least not cruel to him, as Lucifer and Michael had been.
The poor prince sobbed while petting some rabbits in his room.  He looked down at his hand and he wanted to just throw the ring into the pits of hell.  Stupid brothers.
After the proposal, they entered a very blissful period.  Almost always blushing around each other, feeling as if they had achieved all that they would need in their lives.  Staring at each other for so long that if anyone were to see, they would write them both off as creepy.  But they were so happy together, talking about wedding plans whenever they had the free time.  Whispering words of adoration at the end of every day, wrapped around each other in bed, they felt more than ready to commit to being together forever.
They made their way out the tunnel where they’d come.  It was dark outside when they emerged, and the air was cold, biting at their skin as they moved as quickly as they were able.  Dean was really paranoid about hurting Cas, but it was really important that they got him somewhere safe, and fast.  Meaning, inside of the car.
When Dean headed towards him, Castiel was afraid for a second, before the Winchester bowed, took his hand, and asked, "May I have this dance?"
“Where were you when I actually needed you?”  It was a quiet question, but Castiel knew that, especially given the gesture that Dean was trying to make, that it may have been harsh.  He also felt like he had the right to ask it, though.  He was still hurt, and as much as part of him just wanted to accept the flowers and fall back into Dean’s arms, and though the effort was appreciated, he was still upset.  And he needed more.  This couldn’t just keep being enough.  Especially not if he was still thinking about how they were supposed to be getting married.
The man’s name was Inias, which he had no problem with revealing to Castiel as soon as he went up to him, reaching out to brush something invisible off of his shoulder, his hand ending up sliding down his arm, following it even as Castiel moved backwards.  This was what Dean saw as he exited the little store and started making his way back to the car, jaw tense.  It didn’t take long for him to reach them, just long enough for Inias to pull some cash out of his pocket as he started to explain...something, when he was yanked by the back of his jacket by Dean.
Still holding his hand, Dean leaned forward and kissed him.  He had already been able to hear the doubt, the same kind that had been bouncing around in his own head for years.  He wanted to get rid of all of it, for the both of them.
And then, of course, Asmodeus started to move his blade down the back of Castiel’s trenchcoat with erratic movements, blade stabbing his back as it was moved back and forth.  Castiel was able to stay silent, but he closed his eyes.
"I do not care about the cake, but...I do have a request."  At Crowley's enthusiastic nod, he straightened and continued.  "I want a dress.  A dress of the finest silk...for the wedding.  I want it to shine, and I want it to be pale and silver, like the moon."
Sam had seen the two and had no idea what was going on the rest of the night.  He thought that Cas, who he had seen around the school as well as in his philosophy class, was pretty far from his brother’s type.  Since he was a guy and all.  And they sure looked like the convincing couple.  He seriously couldn’t comprehend Dean being with a guy and not telling him.  In fact, he was pretty sure that on the way there Dean had been fantasizing about the sorority girls he could mess with.
This was basically as soon as Castiel was fully moved back in with Dean.  Which didn’t really take much, he hadn’t really needed to bring much stuff over.  Just himself, along with some trust.  Castiel had barely set his laptop down at its old place at his desk before Dean was behind him and mouthing at his neck, telling him, voice low, that he needed him and wanted him and couldn’t wait any longer to have him in bed.  This was all met with a shudder.
The wedding planner nodded and left.  Meanwhile the prince talked to his animals, making plans of his own.
Sam acted like he was grossed out by their sappy stares, but he was truly happy for them.  This was definitely his favorite Christmas. They were all safe, for once. All completely in control of their own bodies, all together, and all content.
Castiel shrugs slightly, looking down at his feet before lifting his head again to look at Dean.  “I would have told you when it happened, but you were so focused on being like Scooby.  Also, you had been so focused on um, Daphne, in that universe, so I just didn’t really feel like telling you.”
It didn’t take long into their visit for Castiel to learn that Lucifer wasn’t exactly father material.  Not that he was surprised.  He watched as his older brother argued with Kelly for a while longer about whether or not he
Dean wants to reassure the boy in front of him, but he doesn’t even know what to say. Hell, he wished he could take the kid and his siblings out of his house, so they don’t have to stay with this dick of a dad. But he doesn’t. He continues the interview as normal, but gives the kid a friendly pat on the shoulder at the end and mutters something about “everything will turn out okay”. Only a few days later, they get a call from the local officers. Eric is in the hospital, and the other kids were taken into a group home.
Once Dean starts speaking, the words don’t seem to stop rushing from his mouth. Cas just regards him with those hauntingly blue eyes, his head tilted in a way that always makes Dean’s heart melt. When all is said, Dean feels like the air was punched out of his lungs, as he awaits his friend’s answer.
“Cas!”, Dean shouts, before quickly approaching the angel. And he says it once more when he is only a few feet away from him. “Cas”
They invited their neighbors under the premise of Castiel’s birthday, even though the angel technically doesn’t even have a birthday. It doesn’t matter anyway, since Sam promised some BBQ and apparently that’s enough to motivate everyone to show up. Dean watches the spectacle from a distance, occasionally sipping his cold beer. He planned to handle the grill, but some bored husband hushed him away to deal with it instead.
His voice sound hoarse and shattered, but he still yells the words. Suddenly, Dean feels the ground shake under his feet and only hears a loud gasp from his brother, before he feels…nothing. When he opens his eyes again, he sees only blackness around him. He knows he is in the Empty and sighs a short breath of relief. The spell didn’t immediately kill him, that is rather positive. He turns around, thinking
“Those are a lot of rules for something as simple as sexual intercourse. Why can’t I just go over and ask him to have sex with me?” Cas asks, his head angled to the side.
“His name was David- or Daniel – maybe Damian?” Truth to be told, Cas doesn’t remember. So many people, so many bodies, so many names. They’ve all blurred together in his tiny human brain. In the end, they’re all just distractions, warm bodies to pass the time with. He just remembers that said guy ended up infected only a few days later. “Doesn’t matter, he’s dead.”
“I thought Eileen and I could maybe do it, but her leg isn’t healing as we hoped,” Sam thinks out loud, wincing at the thought of his injured girlfriend. The recent werewolf hunt was tougher than expected and left Eileen’s leg badly hurt. Cas tried his best to heal her, but she was still struggling.
“Our hunter lives are already so sad, don’t get in the way of your own happiness. You should tell them how you feel”
“The portal can only be opened by an angel who bonded with a human,” he sighs, leaving Dean just as clueless as before.
He swallows the rest of his Whiskey, before stepping close to him. Their faces are only inches apart.
„What do you mean, you never played Truth Or Dare?!”, Charlie yells from the library, where she sits with Castiel and Jack. Surprised, Dean turns his head to look over and already sees the redhead waving him and Sam over. With a sigh, Dean places the dirty plate back into the sink. Whenever Charlie stays at the bunker, trouble is already around the corner.
He’s talking about Heaven now, but there’s still a flash of pain when he remembers the Winchesters did the same to him. When he needed him the most, Dean cast him out of the bunker. Castiel expects to be met with silence. No one could possibly understand his complicated life and the choices he had to make. Or could they?
After Gabriel, Balthazar is the next one to mention it to him. And then Crowley. And Hester. And…The list goes on and on. It doesn’t bother him at first, but the more he falls for Dean, the more the comments make him uneasy. How many more remarks would it take for Dean to figure out they’re telling the truth?
“Of course, would be weird to stay with your husband now that you scored the hotter brother,” Dean replies, pressing a gentle kiss on Castiel’s cheek. He never knew angels could blush, but it’s a sight he will never get enough of.
“That’s almost sexual harassment, Dean!” Sam yells in response, clearly trying to remember some legal basis from his Stanford days. “You can’t force him to have sex with someone!”
“As your brother, I wish you all the happiness in the world,” Sam speaks, his eyes fixed in the distance. When Dean turns his head, he spots their mother coming in through the entrance door, breathing heavily but otherwise seems okay. She gives them both a small nod, signaling them she took care of the altar.
As a hunter, Dean always tries to keep his cases far away from him. If he thinks about them too much, about his regrets, he’d go mad. That’s at least what he told himself a hundred times before. And yet, some cases he can’t forget.
“You are beautiful, Cas,” Dean says while pressing soft kisses onto Cas’s bare chest. His mouth sucks eagerly one of the nipples in his mouth, which results in a long moan from Cas. He can feel Cas’s hands grip around his neck, one hand reaching upwards in his hair. Those hands, which killed countless angels and monsters, now gently caressing Dean’s scalp. Backward, they fall onto the bed, Cas straddling Dean’s lap. When they kiss again, their hips start grinding together in a desperate search for friction; making them both moan into their kiss as a result. Carefully, Dean flips them over, so the angel is on his back.
The first rays of sunlight creep into the cabin, and Dean closes his eyes to ignore them a moment longer. Just for a minute, he wants to forget their hopeless situation. He pretends they are living a normal life – or as normal as it would be for a hunter and an angel of the lord. They could’ve gotten a place on their own somewhere, with Sammy nearby and a big garage for Baby. Maybe even a kid, that would be something. The thought of him teaching a teenage boy driving in Baby leaves a sad smile upon Dean’s lips.
“Dark or not, it doesn’t change the fact I’m probably going to miss my train,” the stranger jokes, but Dean can’t laugh. He’s gotta catch his train at the central station as well, and it’s not looking good for him. The transfer time was already very short but with this delay, it gets right impossible. Dean can feel the anxiety bubble in his gut, as he scrambles his papers from his bag. With the current delay, his transfer time will cut down a lot. Leaving him at…
The look on Castiel’s face is everything and without even words, Dean knows he feels the exact same about him. The room is quiet around them, and from the corner of his eye, Dean spots Jennifer amongst the watchers. At least their little distraction worked well enough for her to stay.
Whenever Dean's hands slip into his boxers, he wonders if he would ever bottom again. Years ago, this would have seemed impossible. But then again, Dean also never would have thought he'd identify as anything else than straight. He even tries to watch gay porn a few times, but the actors moan too much and make sucking a dick seem so much easier than it actually is.
“I’ll drop by the community center first, they asked me to take over a case at the Harley Charles prison today,” Castiel says casually. Right, Castiel became a social worker, how could Dean forget that? He presses another chaste kiss upon the chapped lips, before pulling back.
He hits the solid ground hard, but he barely notices the pain. Cas still looks at him, a sad smile upon his lips. The black goo forms around him, before swallowing his still smiling face and dragging Castiel into the wall. Dean barely notices Billie entering the room, but she also gets swallowed by the emptiness.
Carefully, he watched the way his brother and his friend interacted, and the sight made him feel uneasy. He thought it was a stupid idea for them to fake a relationship because it would just be weird. But now that he was watching the way Cas’s hand rested on Sam’s lower back, Dean realized it’s something entirely else: he’s jealous. It’s not a feeling he knows very well; after all, none of his relationships ever lasted long. But as he watched Cas laugh at one of Sam’s stories, their sides pressed together – it’s setting something inside of Dean loose.
“Okay, we’re going to be easy on you…Hm, how about you take off your flannel?”, Charlie asks with a kind smile. Dean knows exactly what she is doing, and takes a sip of his beer. In situations like that, she will at first be so sweet and innocent, only to later ask the kinkiest stuff of you. But Castiel can’t know that yet, so he takes off the green flannel. Underneath, he is wearing a black tank top and Dean takes a glance at his arm muscles. They look surprisingly well trained, Dean notes. But he his thought gets interrupted by Castiel.
“She wanted to leave him,” Eric tells him almost immediately. “Dad is – he’s a complicated person. And when he drinks…he just gets angry…”
“I’m not gay”, Dean whispers against Elliot’s lips, as they part for a moment. At this point, it feels like he needs to reassure himself of it.
“Well then,” Claire says, clearly holding tears back herself. “I shall pronounce you officially hitched!”
“What’s the matter with you, Dean? You’re acting like a child,” Cas hisses when he catches him in the hallway. It’s enough to make Dean angry again, as he pulls his arm away from Castiel’s tight grip.
“How about the brunette gal over there? She is pretty…,” the hunter starts, but Castiel interrupts him sharply.
“Yes, and I think Castiel would agree with you there,” Sarah speaks, before taking a long sip from her teacup. The reaction is immediate, as all the women start talking at once. The Winchester barely lived a week in the neighborhood, but they already produced the best gossip they had in a while.
It’s not long until the other angels catch up with his sympathies. Gabriel is the first one to comment it to him, right after he finally released the Winchesters from the so-called “tv land”. The Winchesters have long left the abandoned factory, but Cas returns as soon as possible. He has a fond memory of Gabriel, they were close friends a few thousand years ago. It seems like his brother had the same idea since he is still sitting where they had left him earlier.
The boy picks truth, and Castiel asks him about his favorite color. What a shock, it’s blue. Dean thinks about just emptying the liquor, to make this a little bit more interesting. At the next turn, Sam gets picked and in true Winchester fashion, Sam picks Dare.
