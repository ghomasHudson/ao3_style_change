“They seem happy.” Jack observes, his smile turning benevolent. Some moments, Dean sees the confused kid in him, others – like now – he’s suddenly aware of how
Cas rakes a hand through his damp hair. Dean is a long line of tension next to him, but he seems to think this is for Cas to answer. Cas locks eyes with him for a second, to make sure it’s okay to share with their brothers. Dean nods minutely, brows drawn up, as if he’s curious too what Cas will say.
So, new chapter. Warning for Michael being a period-typical bigoted asshole in this and some violent images, though nothing too graphic. Let me know what you think?
Castiel will be bound to Dean forever. He knew that beforehand, when he was ordered to leave heaven and save the righteous man. What he didn’t expect is the depth of that bond, the surge of protectiveness and a deeper emotion, one he can’t quite name yet. And he didn’t expect Dean to feel it, too.
“What? You gonna kill me? Your own father?”
Cas holds on for dear life.
Dean laughs humorlessly. He does that when he finds the answer to a question unpleasant but can’t ignore his urge to at least try to be honest. Dean Winchester, Castiel finds, is a complicated man.
“The Sunset Plaza in June is the place to be for LGBT singles, Cas. Wait, you didn’t know?”
All of a sudden, the hall around him seemed too big, vast and empty, and the hopeful anticipation that had filled him only moments before turned sour. His eyes burned with unshed tears. The soft sounds of sleeping boys around him should have been a comfort, but he couldn’t help feeling utterly alone. His throat constricted and Dean turned his face into the coarse fabric of his blanket to stifle a sob. When Garth came around to wake them for vigil, he hadn’t slept at all.
Cas does as he’s asked, eyes open now but unseeing, that dark blue glazed over. Cas’ hand wraps around his own cock. He gathers the wetness at the tip to spread it over himself.
His arm is heavy as a log when he slips his hand up to cup Cas’ jaw. The light stubble rasps against his skin. Dean’s drowning in the reality of it, the dark blue of Cas’ eyes. He’s dreamed of this, so many times, waking with his chest aching, chastising his unconscious for wanting something he can’t have.
What Lucifer does when he’s outside remains a mystery, until the second night turns into dawn. The difference between night and day in this world is nothing more than the difference between pitch black darkness and enough weak light to make out contours. Dean’s never imagined he would miss the sun this much, but it’s like he can feel the lakck of vitamin D on a physical level. He’d give a non-essential limb to stand outside in his world and bask in the warmth of a mild summer sun.
now and then. It’s easy and comfortable, to sit here in the middle of the night with Dean and forget for a while how royally he fucked up. Cas eyes start to droop in the middle of another one of Dean’s work stories. Dean gently bumps his arm.
With a last long glare that Cas can feel like a physical touch Winchester pushes himself up and strides to the door where he turns for a last comment, because he has to have the last word, of course. “It was a delight to make your acquaintance, Lieutenant Milton. I’m sure we’ll meet again.” With a tip to his nonexistent hat, he exists, leaving Cas flabbergasted and still infuriated. His hands curl into fists on his desk, crumbling a piece of paper.
Milton & Partners.
Jack doesn’t seem happy, but he follows Dean to the library, opens the portal and stares into the black space for a long minute. “I really wish I could help,” he says. What he doesn’t say is that he wants Cas back too, that he, too, can’t let it stand, and that’s why he helps Dean on this suicide mission.
„Oh my god, it’s him!“ Gabriel whispers loud enough for the elderly couple next to them to turn their heads.
“I put them on for someone special,” Dean tells Cas’, low, as if he’s sharing a secret.
Dean perks up, straightens to his full height and squares his shoulders. Adrenaline still pumps through his veins from the fight earlier, and he realizes it’s been way too long. The brunette waves a little and bends to whisper something in her friend’s ear, before she walks over to them in long, determined strides. When she reaches the bar, she clunks her whiskey hamper against Dean’s and smiles.
“I thank you for your hospitality, Father, but I’d like to be alone now.”
Cas takes his time in the bathroom. When the first high of the frankly mind-blowing orgasm ebbs off, anxiety takes its place. He opens the door with his heart beating in his throat – not sure if he fears Dean being there or him being gone.
Cas’ eyes are closed, but he can hear and he can feel the first draw of the saw, he can feel the vibration in Dean’s body when the metal teeth drive into his bone. It takes longer than he thought, longer than he hoped to sever the sick half of Dean’s leg from the healthy one. And the worst part, he know, is yet to come.
When he rearranged his weight on his hands, the tip of his erection brushed against Cas’. Their still wet skin translated every small movement into a sensual glide and Dean couldn’t help experimenting with it, pushing just a fraction up Cas’ body and his elbows nearly gave out at the sensation of their lengths against each other. Cas tensed again but otherwise didn’t react.
“I want to be close to you, talk to you, and be at your side when you’re in danger. I want to watch you while you cook and cut the onions for you because I know you dislike the smell.”
While Castiel ponders all this, Dean sleeps fitfully. Castiel watches him, the cuts and bruises on Dean’s skin, his eyes moving behind his closed lids, the way his hands tense into fists now and then. The unnamed emotion surges at the sight. It’s tender and protective and coveting … and something sharper, something selfish.
Dean’s hand finds Cas’ head and fingers sink into his hair, tugging, as if Dean is searching for something to hold onto. The sharp pain shoots right into Cas’ groin. With a start he realizes he’s getting hard again. Heat pools deep in his stomach. Cas bobs his head and sucks, delighted by the new raw groan he discovers when he tongues against the underside and sinks back down.
And Cas is painfully aware that he overreacted that morning. He should have stayed. He should have asked Dean about the phone call. But there’s still the fact that it all moved way too fast for him. His feelings for Dean had grown too fast. If he’s being honest with himself, that’s why he ran, because he’s a coward and he’s not good at this. He hangs his head.
He never told them his name.
"Yeah,“ Dean croaks against the surge of emotion, the hope and the bubbling joy and all the nagging what-ifs, and he closes his hand around Cas‘.
Gabe scratches his chin as if he’s seriously considering it, but shakes his head. “Sorry, bro, no can do. This is too delicious.”
. Adrenaline’s already rising inside Dean’s veins, the need to
Dean cleans each and every weapon they possess.
“No, I will not. I’m sure I can get some kind of sexual gratification just from staring at him if I try hard enough. It worked fine before,” Cas shoots back, sharp even as he’s trying to keep his voice down. “And you won’t say anything either.”
“But as I said, coffee first. You’ll have to wait.”
They had saddled up when the first orange hues of dawn had crept through the trees behind the house. Now, the sun rose higher above the horizon, a sickly yellow, too weak to dissipate the moisture and the mist.
Dean starts the engine to let it idle, and turns up the heater. Cas realizes only then that his teeth are chattering and his hands are numb with cold. He rubs them against his pants.
They talk about nothing in particular while they wait for their dinner. The conversation flows easily – when Cas falls silent, Dean picks up the threat and entertains Cas’ with his never-ending supply of anecdotes from work. The food is delicious, but Cas can’t really concentrate on the rich flavor when Dean is sitting in front of him and eating with delight. His sensual mouth closes around every bite as if he’s starved for it, and he moans his appreciation in a downright filthy way. Cas has an inkling Dean does it on purpose, but he enjoys it too much to mention it.
Dean can’t help but shoot back. “No shit,” but Cas shakes his head, tips his head as if he’s listening to a sound only he can hear, so Dean shuts up.
Cas shakes his head to clear it, but it’s foggy. He scrambles to his feet and waits for his equilibrium to get back online. Grabbing blindly for Dean’s shoulder, he squeezes it lightly. Dean’s startled inhale is loud in the sudden silence of room.
The drinks arrive and Dean makes his way over to Grace and Sam who seem to be in the middle of a discussion of … “State laws, really?” Dean hands over Grace’s drink. “Don’t tell me you’re a lawyer.”
“Bet you were leaking already when you came into the bathroom,” Dean muses, and Cas breaks. He wraps his hand around his cock, tight, just like he likes it, and groans a
Bradbury’s head appears, starting with the shock of red hair, followed by a face that tries to hide any hint he’s listened to the conversation (and failing). “The harbor master is here to see you, sir.”
“Dean? What…? Dean!”
Castiel was a good teacher, patient but full of enthusiasm for his topics. Dean was impressed by Castiel’s vast knowledge and his willingness to consider every perspective before he made up his mind. As a soon-to-be-monk, this open-mindedness seemed like another contradiction in Castiel’s character. One afternoon, Dean asked him about it.
“Why are you so tense,” Cas inquires, and fuck if Dean knows the answers to that. He plotted this for weeks, some time alone with Cas between one apocalypse and the next to finally talk a few thing out, set a few records straight, exchange an apology or two.
And with that, he’s diving under the surface and pushing his body forward in one powerful motion. Cas is allowed, even encouraged to watch him, so watch him he does. Dean’s broad shoulders push through the surface and roll into another stroke both graceful and speaking of physical power. Strong and well-proportioned muscles roll with the motions, and Cas couldn’t tear his eyes away if he wanted. His neck is warm from the sun, his cheeks are hot as if he’s catching a fever. He is both detached and completely aware of the situation, acutely attuned to each movement of Dean’s body while the rest of his surroundings seem muted and unreal.
He wondered how he could ever have thought of Cas’ face as static and inscrutable. After nearly two years, he knew to look for the subtle movements. Dean could read every hint of a smirk and the probably involuntary lift of his lips that followed Dean’s lewd jokes. And so he noticed the smug little tilt of Cas’ mouth or the almost inconceivable squint that told him Cas was sure he would win the round, and Dean would be oh so careful to overthink his next move. Sometimes it worked, and he figured out what Cas planned soon enough to discomfit it.
Dean still doesn’t move. Cas weighs his options. He could slap Dean and hope it will bring back his memories. He could leave and search for another way to break the spell that made Dean forget who he is. Or he could follow his instincts.
“Oh,” Sam answers slowly. “I see.” He decidedly does
Cas  wipes the mental images Sunny’s words conjured briskly from his mind. Or he tries to.
Dean chuckles. Because he’s got to find some outlet for what he’s feeling. Because if he didn’t laugh, the burn in his eyes would lead to tears, and he can’t have that right now. If he breaks down, he will stay down.
Ellen came to St Mary’s Well after the death of her father, a barber-surgeon who traveled the country and taught her his trade. The monks feared her at first, and didn’t know how to react to her directness. She found work in the kitchen and kept to herself. Cas doesn’t know when she and the former abbot fell in love, or when they made the decision to leave the safety of their life at the monastery behind to find a place for themselves.
The ringing of the bell that calls them to lunch chimes through the window, and the blood is pounding in his ears when Cas says goodbye to the boys and follows them out of the room. He tries to keep his steps even - left, right - in time with his labored breathing, as he walks over to the infirmary. Sam is already there. Charles puts a rolled-up blanket in Dean’s back to help him sit upright. They’re talking, Cas is aware of that, but he can’t hear a word they’re saying.
Cas feels each word like a blow to his chest, most of all the words Dean leaves out. “I know you, Dean.”
of Cas, how warm and firm those muscles feel under Dean. The adrenaline of the ambush courses through him and makes him lightheaded. His left palm is still pressed against Cas’ throat. Dean can feel Cas’ blood pumping just a little bit faster. Or maybe it’s his own.
Cas holds out his hands to stop Dean’s rambling. “Wait, hold up please. You… knew that Sam is working at my firm?”
Sam decipher what’s Dean’s trying to say. Sam comes up blank.
“You said I should look for a suitable sexual partner since you were occupied.”
He smiles more easily, now that Sam explained the soul-travelling to him and he can make sense of the memory flashes that seem to come more often and get clearer by the day. Sam thinks it’s because Cas doesn’t fight the intrusive thoughts anymore but accepts them. It’s weird to watch that transition. One minute Cas is not!Cas and surprises them with recollections of battles they weren’t a part of, or cocks his head like he’s waiting for a message from his squadron before realizing he can’t hear them. Other times, Cas asks about what happened in Game of Thrones while he was gone, and for a moment, it’s like he never left.
“Bye Cas,” Dean answers. He sounds old and tired all of a sudden. Cas closes the door behind him carefully. It almost doesn’t make a sound.
want that? His cock seems to like the idea, jerks in his hand and a new kind of heat settles in his gut. He reaches up and curls his free hand around Dean’s neck, to steady himself and because he needs the contact, feeling untethered with his climax rushing forward to meet him.
They part ways two miles from the bunker. Mary sets out with Garth in the direction of the rift to go back to Sam. Dean and the fighter he met that first day, a scrawny guy who goes by the name of Danny and doesn’t talk if he doesn’t have to, will follow Bobby’s trail. His group has a head start of a day, but Dean’s sure they will be able to catch up.
That's it, guys. Thank you to everybody who stuck with this for the last two years, for having faith that this story would one day be finished against all odds. You're amazing!!!
Dean’s mind is reeling. He’s got absolutely no right to throw such a fit, of that he’s sure. He’s a fucking idiot, but what else is new. All the moments between him and Cas, when he was so sure what he felt was one-sided, could it be – could this mean it wasn’t? All the times Dean hooked up with someone and Cas’ face did the thing that makes Dean feel like a chastised schoolboy – Dean had been positive it had been disapproval, what else could it be, honestly, since Dean is such a fuck-up and no one in their right mind would want that, least of all Cas …
“Tell me.”
Dean’s shoulder pops when he straightens again. He’s not getting any younger here, literally.
Cas puffs next to him, and Dean doesn’t need to look to know he’s doing The Face – angry squint, lips a thin line, eyes glaring as if he’s about to smite someone. It’s been a long time since Dean had to worry about that possibility. Not for the first time, he wonders why Cas gave it all up just for the chance to hang out with his brother and him in greasy bars like this. Right now, Cas might ask himself the same thing.
, Cas thinks.
A hand lands on his shoulder, light like a bird, but the warmth of Cas’ palm soaks into his skin nonetheless.
“I think you made me see the light,” he murmurs and licks away the fresh drop of precome that’s beading from the head of Dean’s cock. Cas might have formed a small addiction for the taste, but even more for way Dean’s stomach trembles under his hand when he does it.
“And in our everyday life, what would you say is better: something that exists or something that doesn’t exist? I brought an apple for this. This apple is better than an apple that doesn’t exist, right?” He smiled when Jo agreed wholeheartedly, and threw the apple over to him. “I’m sure you can make it disappear, Jo.”
Hey guys, I changed the title, hope it's not too confusing. I'm planning to get another chapter done this weekend, but I can't promise anything. Unbeta'd.
It’s the underwear model from the fashion catalogue his mom got every few months. Cas blushes while cold sweat break out on his neck. He didn’t know his body could do that.
“Yes,” he rasps, which seems to be the exactly right reaction, because Dean puffs out his chest and grins wide at him.
face.
Cas lifts his head and lets go of Dean’s cock with a wet pop. It looks obscene as it flops back against Dean’s belly, shining with spit, dark red, swollen.
“What am I to you, Cas?”
“So, which side of the bed do you want?”
Dean chuckles, still a little out of breath. “Well played, Cas.”
learn a thing or two over the years, even if some people would disagree.
The students nodded, some whispered “yes”.
Now he looks at her fading form as she makes her way up the hills next to Garth. He will head out east with Danny, over to Olympia, and kill the devil. He tries to ban the news about the angel from his thoughts, but fails miserably. It’s a version of Cas that never met Sam or Dean, most likely never really interacted with humans.
The pounding in Cas’ head is back with force. Black dots flicker in and out of his field of vision. He focuses on Dean’s hands.
Cas growls in answer and tugs again. “I’ve been very, very dumb, and I apologize, but right now…” He looks up into Dean’s eyes, lets out a steadying breath. “I can’t believe you’re here. I just need to…”
When he looks up, he wishes he hadn’t. Castiel is shackled to a wall. His wings hang limp and broken down his back. Deep gashes on his chest, barely closing in his weakened state. Dean swallows his gasp at the sight. His stomach turns.
“Jack.” Sam says it with a fond smile. “He grew stronger every day. At first, I could hold him back, but one day he came to me and told me he knew where Cas is, that he needs to save him.” Sam shrugs. “I didn’t believe him at first, so we went to Rowena. She came over through the rift with us and located Cas with a spell. And then Mary told us that you two went after Lucifer.” He doesn’t say why he made the decision to take the kid and come after him, but Dean knows anyway.
The hunters from the other side came with them to get patched up and regroup. A few days ago, Sam went back with them, through the rift that Jack holds open with the sheer power of a Nephilim. Dean still isn’t sure he trust the kid, but even he can’t deny that his heart seems to be in the right spot. Jack promised to rebuild the alternative world as much as he can, clear the debris of the battles and bring the landscape back to life. When Dean had started packing his things to join them, Sam had stopped him.
“’s nice,” Dean murmurs sleepily. Cas wants to say he could get used to this, to waking up next to Dean, but it might be too much, too soon. He doesn’t know where they stand. It’s only been two days, he reminds himself. Having Dean in his arms feels so right and easy like breathing.
Dean stands and throws up his hands up as if to shield himself. “Woah there, Cas. I told you that’s not okay. No invading other’s minds and picking their brains! Stop it!”
Cas walks into the room behind Dean, lets his bag fall onto the small couch, and rakes a hand through his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
In his motel room, he gets out the book. It falls open on the marked page.
When Dean looks up again, he licks his bottom lip like he just saw the most delicious meal in the world. “I will go up to my room now and take a shower,” he mumbles, almost casually, but the hoarseness of his voice betrays the attempt at nonchalance. His hand is still on Cas’ hip, burning and possessive.
“Or course I did. Found out about 30 minutes after you’d left the hotel. Charlie’s a genius with computers, you know? I had your name, wasn’t really that hard to piece it all together.”
“That’s possibly a good idea,” Cas answers, mesmerizes by the movement of Dean’s lips.
Cas masks his chuckles with a cough. “Exactly, Sergeant. I trust you to keep this mission quiet.”
Cas nods. He’s lost all sense of time, staring at Dean’s groin and listening to his recollection of that first morning. He’s almost painfully hard, his cock throbbing with every pulse of his blood, but he refrains from touching himself. As much as he enjoys watching Dean, he’d feel awkward doing it himself.
“Dean,” he chokes out, just when his stomach lurches.
The phone in Dean’s hands buzzes with an incoming call that Dean accepts with a sigh. The voice on the other end is agitated and quite loud.
“Next time,” he whispers like he’s sharing secret, “next time I’ll let you fuck my mouth.” He underlines the promise with a wicked twist of his hand that makes Cas see stars. “Can’t wait to get a taste of you.”
Cas buries his head in his hands and sighs.
, and he would have shaken his head and said it again, different this time as if a change in tone could make Cas
"I still missed you. Would you hurry up and get over here.” Dean opens his hands invitingly, beans up at Cas. “If I remember correctly, we had an appointment.”
Cas’ body tensed and then fell limp.
Dean watches him from the front porch, a book or his laptop forgotten in his lap. The black patch where he burned his friend is still visible halfway between house and shoreline. The sight brings with it a stab of grief and then a mix of guilt and shame. He hasn’t quite wrapped his head around the fact that Cas lives on in another person. Who happens to look exactly like him.
Dean hasn’t seen him yet and Cas slows his steps so he has time to stare a little more. The crisp white shirt glows against the sun-kissed skin on Dean’s neck. Dean fiddles with his hands and tugs his cuffs out of his jacket in a nervous gesture that makes his shoulders strain against the material of the suit. Cas mouth waters at the sight. As much as Cas likes this outfit, he can’t wait to peel if off Dean later this evening.
Gabe gesticulates with one arm, careful not to spill a drop of his hideous concoction. “Me? I wasn’t the one who told a room full of strangers about my gay awakening!”
“Hello, Dean.”
They need a moment to find the right angle for their mouths, noses brushing and chins bumping, until Dean grabs his head with an impatient sound and tilts it to the left and then… it’s perfect.
Castiel took a few hours out of his busy schedule to tutor Dean on all the topics that hadn’t been part of his education but were assumed for any student at the monastery. Latin, bible studies and catholic law filled their Thursday afternoons.
The ground shifts slightly under his feet. The stranger assesses the situation, takes his hand back slowly from Cas’ arm as if he’s careful not to anger Dean, as if Dean’s some kind of frightened animal, and excuses himself.
Now his heart beats faster every time he thinks back to the moments he shared with Dean, not just the sex (though that was amazing), but the little things. The way Dean would smile at his best friend when she wasn’t looking. The way Dean tipped the waitress generously and waved her away with a blush when she thanked him. The way Dean talked about his little brother, pride evident even in his snide remarks about Sam’s haircut and his too big heart. Cas has a feeling he knows where Dean’s brother learned that empathy.
Dean, completely overwhelmed by the contact, only had one conscious thought,
“What’s so funny?” Cas grumbles.
Dean stirs in his sleep and Castiel loses his focus. In a blink, he’s back in his seat by the bed, darkness encompassing him once again. He lets his head fall back against the chair and takes a deep breath of the stale and sterile hospital air. Machines are beeping somewhere. Down the hall, an old man waits for the relief of death.
“Your heart beats very fast,” Cas observes.
Dean squeezes his hand. “Forgiven,” he murmurs.
The old-fashioned clock is ticking in the background. The smell of over-cooked vegetables wafts from the kitchen. Dean’s cardigan feels both soft and scratchy under his palm.
Dean had often imagined how Cas had been before, when he was a soldier, a leader in heaven’s armies. He remembers the other-worldy coldness, the detached stare of Cas when he had first met him, the smooth façade that had crumpled with every action of free will until Cas had been unfit for the heavenly host.
Dean licks his lips. “You know what’s even better than giving blowjobs?” There’s the eyebrow again, followed by the obnoxious wink that sends shivers of anticipation down Cas’ spine. He’s in serious trouble, it seems, every time that wink is directed at him.
“No.”
With his heart pounding in his throat, he leans in the last inches and presses his lips to Dean’s.
“Inherited, more precisely,” Winchester shoots back.
Cas nods, a barely there motion, but it’s enough. Dean’s lips are cold from the tap water, firm and confident. Cas melts against Dean’s body, hands on Dean’s hips to feel the warmth of his skin through the t-shirt. The sink is digging into his side. The kiss is nothing more than a brush of lips at first, but it’s already enough to make that well-known flame inside him flare again. Heat is spreading where their breaths meet and mingle.
I feel like I should apologize. We're back to smut in the next chapter, I promise.
Dean rips him from his musings.
“He’s back in the cage,” Sam says. “He won’t hurt us anymore.”
A lone figure is occupying the parking lot, leaning against a sleek black car and breathing clouds into the night. It’s a guy, broad-shouldered, bundled up into a leather jacket and a thick scarf. He looks up when Cas curses his clumsy fingers as he’s fishing for his phone in his slacks. Cas concentrates on his screen, tries to unlock it three times in a row and goes for the fourth when a deep voice speaks up next to him.
Cas comes first. His climax runs along his spine like lightning in slow-motion, touching each of his vertebras with electricity. He shakes with the force of it, and gasps when the tension snaps. His cock kicks in his hand as it spurts out his release all over Dean’s skin. Dean talks him through it, nonsensical encouragements between high moans.
“Okay, so Sunny and Conrad had an affair.” Dean’s voice is hoarse. Cas wonders why. “We’ll talk to her tomorrow.”
The server comes, picks up their order, and leaves.
“I know,” Dean sighed.
He leaves the two alone, intend to make his way back to Cas, but the stool Cas occupied just a minute before is empty. Alarmed, Dean looks around. He finds Cas’ familiar silhouette near the pool table, standing very, very close to a guy Dean doesn’t recognize. He’s over by Cas’ side in three long strides.
“Wait, what? Slow down, okay? Milton & Partners? That’s a good firm, isn’t it? Great news! I knew you’d make it!” Dean laughs. “Congrats, Sasquatch!”
Sam rolls his eyes and laughs, leans his arms on Gabe’s shoulders and presses a quick kiss to his forehead. “Whatever you say, babe.”
Dean doesn’t say thank you. He claps his brother on the back, much weaker that he would like, and uses the leverage to get on his feet. Sam acts like he doesn’t know Dean needs the support, but he stands up slowly so Dean can hold on to him. Once they stand, Sam turns and hugs him tight.
Cas spent the whole day making plans and discard them. His goal is to get solid proof of Winchester’s crimes, but he’s shown his hand and Winchester will not be dumb enough to come back here with whatever prize he’s taking. No, he’ll sell the goods somewhere else and come back here to rub it in Cas’ face. Cas can’t follow Winchester’s ship either. He’ll be spotted and most likely Winchester will lure him into a fight, a fight Cas knows he can’t win with his meager troops. So when Bradbury’s note arrives, he’s stuck with his last, the most harebrained and reckless plan of all.
“Can I kiss you?” Dean asks.
Gabe points to the spot next to him. “Sit down, Cas, and have a drink with us.”
Dean parks the car on the curb and rounds it to open Cas’ door like the gentleman he is, trudges alongside him up to the steps that lead to Cas’ house. Cas fumbles out his keys with clumsy fingers. It takes long enough that Dean sighs and grabs the keys from him to open the door himself.
. It‘s what they came here for isn‘t it. This is exactly why he orchestrated this whole pointless trip, why he wasted ten hours already and still can‘t bring himself to say his piece.
Cas struggles to compose himself. His voice is only slightly trembling when he answers. “The abomination you are currently preparing is for my brother, Gabriel, and the real coffee is for me. I’m Cas.”
Blood, Dean finds, is so much redder in a world of grey, as if painted with a careless brush over the dust and the grime. Two angels lie at his feet, wings burned into the dry ground. He just wiped his blade on the jacket of one of his opponents when he looks up into the blue of Castiel’s eyes, the same blue, stark and deep and other. Castiel is in shackles, left behind by his guards. He stands in the midst of the chaos like a marble statue.
He’s so hard he’s aching with it. The first touch of his hand against his cock feels like heaven, and he swallows the sigh that bubbles up in his throat. With swift movements, he shoves down his underwear and takes himself in hand. He tries to be quiet about it, just curls his hand tight around his cock and pumps fast, squeezing at the tip and rubbing the drops of precome down his length to ease the glide. The scent of Dean’s orgasm still lingers in the air, and it’s spurring Cas on even more.
With a silent thanks to that bug in the reservation system that made their paths cross, he holds Cas just a little bit tighter.
Ellen gave more tasks and more responsibilities to Dean. Come summer, he took the carriage and his own horse, which had been given to the monastery by his father, to the nearby village, and traded goods on the market. The monks produced most vegetables and fruit themselves. They sold the excess and bought meat, fish and salt from the local merchants. Father Bobby and Ellen had undertaken the journey every Wednesday until now. Dean felt a warm surge of pride at being trusted with such an important responsibility.
If you enjoyed this story, please let me know, and maybe share it? Rebloggable tumblr post will follow soon.
Dean pulse slowed down and his breath evened out eventually. Warm and sated, he cherished the moment of peace and the fact that he could share it with Cas. With a silly kind of happiness bubbling through him, at first he thought Cas was laughing when he felt him trembling in his arms.
– it pushes against the back of his eyes. Unrelenting.
“But you–,” Cas squints at him. Dean knows that look. It’s the squint that says he’s peering at Dean’s soul and right into his thoughts.
When he hears footsteps approach, he doesn’t stop, instead arcs into his own touch a little for effect and lets a soft moan fall into the silence.
Dean lets his knife fall to the ground. It lands with a metallic clank. It’s loud in the silence of his bedroom.
Dean lets go of Cas with a smack and a blinding smile, before he faces Gabe and Sam again.
Dean’s hips move in wanton waves under his palm, the motion so carnal that Cas can’t help but imagine what Dean would look like beneath him, taking him into his body. He groans into Dean’s open mouth and rubs his cock against Dean’s thigh in aborted thrusts, mimicking the act he’s picturing in his mind.
Sitting up, his blood rushes down and leaves behind a dull pounding in his head. His tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. He’s parched and dizzy and…
Beneath it, there’s doubt and a life-old rage, and desperation. Sometimes Castiel wonders if he did Dean a favor to rescue him. For Dean carries his own hell with him wherever he goes. Determined, Castiel pokes and searches for an image of himself. He combs through Dean’s recent memories, the torture of Alistair – a fresh wound, still bleeding and raw, interspersed with pictures of the flaming pit. Flailing souls and anguished screams.
Cas’ lips are dry and soft when they finally meet his. With trembling fingers, Dean weaves his hands into Cas’ hair and holds on.
“Gabe,” Cas groans, “please.”
Unbetad, so sorry for the mistakes.
Without her cheerful presence, an awkward silence falls over the table. Cas eats a few bites of his fruit and Dean finishes his sandwich. Cas looks around to watch the other guests. After a few minutes he chuckles under his breath.
, Dean thought, and Cas whimpered into the skin of his neck before he tensed and came in hot spurts over Dean’s balls and thighs. The thought of Cas’ release dripping from his heated skin, filthy and oh so forbidden, staining and marking him with proof that Cas was just as lost as he was, sent Dean over the edge without warning. Back arched, hands still fisted in Cas’ hair, he threw back his head and cried out. Wave after wave of pleasure had him shaking, while Cas’ body blanketed and tethered him.
Sam is back in his line of sight, blocks the view. Hands him a flask. “Slowly,” he warns, as if Dean doesn’t know that. As if Dean hadn’t taught him that. He snatches the bottle with shaking fingers and forces himself to take small sips.
The doorframe darkens from the sheer mass of a tall man with long brown hair and wide eyes. He’s clutching a manila folder to his massive chest. “I hope I’m not interrupting?” the newcomers asks, eyes flicking from one brother to the other.
Cas’ chest heaved with his rasping breath and Dean let his gaze drift down his body, over the dark hair between his pec to his ribs and his stomach…
“I didn’t know you were with someone,” he finishes the sentence lamely.
The urge to speak up, to challenge Zachariah clenched his fists, but he knew it would be useless and might result in an even harsher penalty. He sealed his mouth and forcefully relaxed his hands, head bowed, and nodded.
“Care to explain what’s happening here, Dean?”
“I would have come back tomorrow. I just wanted to share some of my knowledge with Bobby and the others to help them fight. Lucifer is still on the loose.”
“Please what?” Gabe turns next to the door. “Please hook me up with a handsome guy so I won’t sulk anymore and drag the mood of the whole firm down?” He tips his imaginary hat. “Consider it done.”
Cas nods, because it apparently only takes a few minutes to learn that one doesn’t say no to Charlie.
He hears Cas’ inhale, and stops him with the lifted spoon. Drops of milk land on the table and run down his hand. “Don’t bother,” he mumbles around a mouthful of cereal, before he swallows and turns to look at Cas.
Dean shakes his head, more to get Lucifer’s hands off him than to negate his questions. He’d rather die than let Lucifer know he’s asked himself those exact questions. Considering the grim outlook he’s facing, he might just get his wish.
Dean hangs his head and tries to open his eyes again without drawing attention to the fact that he’s conscious again. His head thumps like someone planted a jackhammer in his skull, now worsened by the familiar rage brought on by Lucifer’s ridiculous antics.
Dean fell into the rhythm of the monastery with ease. The early services were challenging, but he learned to value the cold and the hard floor of the church quickly – they kept him awake and made coming back to his cot even sweeter.
And he liked the singing, even if he would never admit it. When the chorus of young voices echoed through the church, it left a feeling of togetherness, a common bond, that Dean hadn’t had at home in a long time. And so he sang, loud, with all his heart and his eyes closed. The “Gloria” had always been his favorite, even as a child. The melody rising up and down, clear, full of hope and purity, let him step out of himself and his sorrows for a while. When the last notes trailed off, Dean opened his eyes again and felt refreshed.
“The hell you won’t go,” Gabe interrupts him when Cas tries to explain. He sits on the edge of Cas’ desk, a habit Cas despises, but doesn’t bother to point out. “It’s your firm, too, and you have an obligation to show up.”
“I had a few ideas.”
“Yeah,” he breathes and sinks to his knees.
This Castiel reminds him of the early days, with his unblinking, cool expression and the calculating squint. This is a Castiel that never learned to smile or laugh, that didn’t pout or smirk, because in this world, there’s no Dean to teach him. The thought hurts more than anything. It’s not just Dean that lost something irreplaceable on that day. Cas lost the chance to so many new thing he still could have experienced, so many ways to grow into the person he wanted to be, away from heaven’s duties and hell’s schemes. Did this Castiel carry that rebellious streak, too? Would he break away from the host to follow his own moral compass, given the chance?
“You’re angry,” Cas states and his eyes are laser-sharp on Dean while Dean is rooted to the spot, having an existential fucking crisis. Dean rubs a hand over his head, not caring about the fact that he’ll ruin his hair. Pressure thumps behind his temples, a migraine in the making. How did this happen again?
“Talk to me, Cas,” Dean murmurs, finally giving in to call the angel by a name he dreaded to speak again, “any idea how we could get out of this?”
, Castiel had said, and called him by his name. Dean stares at the lonely figure as if he can coax the answer out of him.
He looks over at his brother and tries in a small smile which goes unanswered. Gabe radiates worry and not a little anger, all covered up with a carefully neutral expression that may fool everyone but Cas. Gabe is loud and boisterous all of the time, and you know you’ve got a problem when he gets quiet.
“Yes, I told you that,” John said, irritation clear in the clipped consonants. “I can’t do anything about it. If the church wants one of my sons, this is the one she gets.” John hadn’t dismounted and didn’t show any sign that he would. Dean blushed, embarrassed by his father’s rude behavior.
Cas didn’t answer for a long time. Dean nudged him with his right foot. He tried for a light tone.
Cas sighs. He’ll get nothing of worth out of a man who makes his living lying and plundering. The order to bring him in was given rashly, and Cas usually doesn’t do rash things. He plans, and he researches, and then he strikes. He’s ill-equipped to have this conversation, even if Winchester is only half awake and obviously still more than a little drunk. Against his better judgement, Cas raises to the bait. “Inherited it? From your father?”
Dean kept the figures simple but different enough to discern. By end of February, he surprised Cas with the finished set for their usual Thursday afternoon meeting. Cas had the more strategic mind, so he won most of the time. Dean, on the other hand, learned to anticipate Cas’ plans by watching him.
“No.” The light grows stronger. Dean blinks his eyes. “I’ll send you back where you belong.”
He listens to the sounds from the front door where Cas sees the last guests off. From the pearls of laughter, it must be Charlie and her girlfriend. The barbeque was fun, and Dean’s heart still warms at the idea of their friends and family getting along so well, but now Dean’s happy to see them gone and be alone with Cas.
Cas said what he said, and is hangs there, in the spot he occupied until moments ago, a spot that is now empty like the darkness at the bottom of a grave, a thick and solid absence of life where Cas stood and breathed and said what Dean didn‘t want to hear, although he‘d longed for it, and the greed with which Dean listened shocks him even now.
Cas wants to
Dean put those panties on yesterday.
“This is not about me, Sam, it’s about Cas. I—he seems to like it. A lot.” He shoots Sam a glowering look as if he could
“That was quite enjoyable,” Cas murmurs, and yelps when Dean smacks his ass with a lazy clap.
It’s a long and hard and garish business. Dean doesn’t regain consciousness throughout the procedure, but he screams and wails and whimpers all the same. It takes Samuel, Charles and Cas to hold Dean down, even in his weakened state, while Ellen works. She cuts open the skin above Dean’s knee, slices through flesh and muscle and sinew, until she reaches the bone.
with him.
Winchester will take on a passenger, and when they reach the next harbor, Cas will bring the famous pirate captain to justice. That – or he’ll die trying.
“After this morning you thought I could withstand your charm for a whole day? I’m flattered by your confidence,” Cas shoots back and feels the corners of his mouth curl in to an answering grin. His lips still tingle from Dean’s stubble. They must look as puffed and well-used as Dean’s.
“It’s in my blood. You should keep away from me. I’m here because my father thought the monastic life would cleanse me, but it’s not working. The evil in me… it’s still there.”
sticking in his throat. Dean might tease him out of his shell, but suave is a something Cas will never be.
“I lost contact to them since Lucifer first took my grace.” So Cas does understand, and isn’t that odd, when the Cas he knew took years to get Dean’s idioms?
Cas’ mind reels. Images of shared Sunday afternoons pop up unbidden, Dean smiling while they cook together in Cas’ small kitchen. Cas shakes his head. Even if distance might not be a problem, he shouldn’t get his hopes up.
Silence.
“Be careful, it’s the only dress shirt I packed.”
Cas reached for the bowl and the candle. He rose to his knees, coming eye to eye with Dean, only an inch of cold air between them.
Castiel digs deeper. Hallways full of memories. Dean’s brother, Bobby, and further back, his mother. Castiel steps around them all gingerly, retraces the paths he’s walked before, until he reaches a door he hasn’t encountered yet. The wood is old and beaten. Rust flakes from the hinges. A sign, handwritten, battered, says “Keep Out”. Castiel wonders what Dean could stow here, when all of Dean’s worst memories lie so close to the surface. Castiel tries the handle, shoves against it, till the heavy door budges.
The first sweep of Cas’ lips is sweet and careful. Dean’s heart thunders against his ribcage. Cas is right, he thinks, as the last weeks fall from his shoulders like a heavy weight. Maybe this was inevitable. He’s long ago said goodbye to the idea that what happened to them had any rhyme or reason to it, that there was some kind of plan behind the suffering and the sacrifice. But here, where one world ends and another begins, it feels like their paths lead to this exact spot.
Dean looks up as if he feels Cas’ gaze on him.
Cas stares at the screen, at the picture of himself as he‘s sleeping in the back of the Impala, arms curled around himself, hair even more a mess than usual, lips slightly parted.
The accusing finger found Dean.
Others, Dean finds himself kneeling on the kitchen floor with his jaw stretched around Cas’ cock, and Cas looking down at him with that shimmer in his eyes that makes Dean feel wanted and adored and completely used at the same time. He’s still bad at dirty talk, but Dean gets a specific thrill out of it when Cas can’t help himself and tells Dean how good it feels, how beautiful Dean looks when he gets his face fucked by Cas.
Dean’s eyes fly open, pupils blown wide, and meet his with laser-sharp focus, and he doesn’t make a single sound when he spills hot over Cas’ hand, his own stomach. They keep looking into each other’s eyes while Cas strokes him through it, until Dean’s gets too sensitive and softens in Cas’ hand. It’s more intimate than everything they did before, and the wonder in Dean’s gaze tells him he’s not the only one who feels that way.
So Dean shrugs, and scans the table for something to occupy his hands with, grabs Cas‘ phone and turns it between his fingers.
“Well, Cas, that vest wasn’t doing you any favors.” Dean smiles, a little strained perhaps, because he remembers that night and can recall the fervent wish that Cas would dress up for him, to go out with Dean instead of some lady he worked with.
Cas’ face is losing its contours when he leans closer, but Dean tries to keep it in focus the whole way, until their noses are bumping and Cas smiles wider, and his eyes crinkle with happiness and wonder, when Dean gently brushes his lips against Cas’.
Bradbury stands even straighter, too small for his uniform which is immaculately plated but held together with a leather strip that’s seen better days. Excitement shines from his eyes. Cas remembers the first time he was given an important assignment, so he’s not about to make fun of Bradbury’s eagerness.
Cas had to go there, hadn‘t he? It‘s typical of him, that fucking gravitas that always breaks out of him in dire, hopeless situations. This need to waste his dying breath on declarations he‘s got no right to make, while Dean can only stand there and listen and not comprehend.
They steal each other’s breath and swallow all the small sounds of pleasure and delight.
Dean has a feeling that Lucifer is pointing at him and Cas, because Jack – Jack the Nephilim, his mind supplies, Lucifer’s freaking son – gasps audibly. Yeah, well, he guesses he doesn’t look much better than Cas.
Dean’s eyes are on him, he can feel it more than he sees it, and suddenly, Cas gets self-conscious about his old swim trunks that look ridiculously out of date against the colorful, tiny briefs the other men are wearing. He steps into the water slowly, eager to flee the calculating, judging eyes around him, but anxious to slip on the steps at the same time.
Black spots dance in Cas’ vision. What the hell is this ...
and nods. “Sweetheart, why don’t you go and get everything ready for lunch?”
“No, Father Robert.”
“Don’t be,” Dean smiles. “I like it.”
He turns and pushes his way through the throng of people between the bar and the exit. He can’t breathe properly. His vision is blurring. A big guy with tattooed forearms huffs a curse when Dean stumbles against him, but Dean keeps going, one step after another, until he’s barging out of the door and into the night.
He will. Or he’ll die trying.
“Thank you for taking me home, and sorry I ruined your evening.” The door is still open and cold wind sweeps into the room. He doesn’t close it, because that would mean he assumes Dean wants to stay. He isn’t even sure that he
“Better?”
He posts Bradbury by the harbor, to observe any comings and goings on Winchester’s ship. Sure enough, by evening Bradbury has sent note that the crew is getting ready to set sail.
that will haunt him for the rest of his life. He’s nearly running when he reaches the library, but smiling nonetheless. The leather-bound book is still open where he left it. He marks the page and puts it in his backpack.
“How should I know? Maybe? What does it matter? She broke her promise before God and she betrayed her family.”
The kid at the desk hacks away at his keyboard, a frown creasing his forehead. “Uhm, I have both your reservations here, and they state that you wanted single rooms, but there must be a bug in the system.” He looks really uncomfortable now. “I’m very sorry, but we have no other rooms available at the moment. I can give you separate rooms tomorrow.” He doesn’t meet Cas’ eyes, so Cas turns his anger towards the man next to him.
He should care about the image they make in broad daylight in the middle of the pool, and he should care about the fact that this feels so much more profound than a playful hook-up, but all he cares about is the way Dean’s fingers curl around his shoulder blades and how he tastes like coffee, chlorine and sunlight.
The usually light brown sandstone that made up St. Mary’s Well monastery was dark and slick with moisture. An open gate led to an inner courtyard surrounded by simple but well maintained buildings. The small church took up the whole left side of the compound. The main portal was to be entered from outside so that the monks and the people of the nearby village didn’t have to mingle. A small door at the back led to the courtyard. When Dean and his father entered, that door opened. An older monk emerged and came over to greet them.
At night the rustling of blankets and muffled moans whispered through the halls of the dormitory. Dean had no illusions about the source of those sounds. While the chilling terror of last night still reverberated through his bones, now, in clear daylight, he just couldn’t believe that Zachariah’s verdict was a good one, or even viable.
“Are you afraid of me?”, Cas whispers, and it breaks Dean’s heart to hear the hurt in it.
Cas stares at the ceiling, and chastises himself for the surge of disappointment at Dean’s reaction. They spent the night together out of necessity, and Dean will be glad to get his own room later, maybe share his new bed with someone else. He will forget the night with the weird guy. To him, sleeping in Cas’ arms will not be the most intimate and wonderful experience he’s had in a long time. He, unlike Cas, will not try to hold on to the feeling of their bodies close together, the flash of desire at feeling the other one’s erection. Cas is pathetic, and maybe he should just leave now …
And in between, stretches of quiet anticipation.
“And what do you think?” For some reason, Dean needed to hear Cas’ thoughts on this.
His mind might be playing tricks and he might be gone mad over the last few days. All of that are possibilities he has to consider. But in a world turned upside down, and after all the times they played against the odds and seldom won, this might be the one time his cards are actually worth something. A tiny smile curls Cas’ lips, just like it used to when Cas ate his first PB&J sandwich as a human, just like it used to when Dean explained a plot twist in a movie to him.
“Prostitution is tolerated to prevent men from committing even greater sins, as far as I know.”
“It’s not about what I want to know, Dean. It’s… Maybe it would help you if you talk about what happened to your family…” Cas let the suggestion rest between them.
Instead, Dean makes a soft sound. It’s the sound he makes when he turns on the TV and one of his favorite Star Trek episodes is on. It’s the sound he makes when he opens the cookie jar and finds out that Cas left the last one for him: a little surprised and very much pleased.
“What.” Dean says again, wheezes it out along with a shaky breath.
He started visiting the classes of Brother Zachariah, an older monk, whose chosen field revolved around those exact questions. Zachariah was a sturdy man with mean little eyes and a deep hatred for every kind of ungodly behavior, most of all everything sexual. Like everyone else, he had heard about Dean’s family history and his face lit up with a nasty glint when he found Dean in his class.
“Cas,” he smiles, and lets his eyes roam over him. Cas straightens his jacket in a futile attempt to make it sit properly on his frame. “You look sharp,” Dean adds, and he sounds like he means it.
“Please bring him back.”
“And who appointed you to the rank of an officer in the Royal Navy?” Cas keeps his voice level, but inside he’s seething. Yes, he ordered the man here, but the fact that his men could be found easily in one of the town’s taverns speaks of the self-confidence Winchester seems to wear like a second skin.
Dean screams and screams until his throat is raw and tears are running down his cheeks, dripping onto the dusty floor beneath him.
“I said he asked me to help him groom his wings.”
The light explodes, searing Dean’s vision with a brightness so absolute he’s not sure if he’ll be blind when the world turns back to its sick grey baseline.
The pressure builds fast. Cas whole body hums with pleasure, heightened by the knowledge how much Dean is enjoying himself. Cas never cared much for blowjobs – giving or receiving them, because there always seemed to be something degrading about it. Dean’s uninhibited enjoyment of the act wipes all those doubts away though. The trust and pleasure on Dean’s slack features moves something deep inside Cas just as his gut clenches with every thrust of his hips.
Cas can’t help but be enchanted by Bradbury’s innocence. He hides his smile. “Roll in the hay?” he offers, and Bradbury nods gratefully.
"Yeah, I know,“ he says just as softly and looks up, waiting for Cas to meet his gaze, meet him in the middle, find a new common ground between them. Cas takes his time, but finally his eyes meet Dean‘s unguarded, with all the questions and the doubt for Dean to see.
Putting on his coat proves to be too much of an obstacle. He gets stuck with his left arm halfway in and gives up altogether when he can’t reach the fabric behind his back. So he bundles the coat up into a ball to stuff it under his arm and makes a beeline for the exit, bumping into warm bodies right and left, murmuring apologies. It takes hours to get to the door.
“Marriage”, Cas continues and watches the open faces of his pupils, so young and innocent still, “is holy. When-“ he pauses. Nobody will ever know if he changes the words just slightly, and today he feels defiant. “When two people truly love each other and are willing to spend their lives caring for each other, that is a true gift. Marriage is an oath that shouldn’t be taken lightly. And the oath to abstain from marriage should not be taken lightly either.”
“Oh, please do.” Winchester pushes off the wall and takes two steps in Cas’ direction, until he can lean over his desk, hands placed next to the ink bottle. Cas resists the urge to lean back, but barely. “And send Dick my best regards.”
Dean laughs against his lips. “Impatient, huh?”
“You could come over,“ Dean muses, “maybe in half an hour or so?”
Cas never shared so much about himself before… before that night. Dean loves to hear stories about his life before they met, always meant to ask about it, but the moment never seemed right. Now Cas tells him about it without prompting, and Dean can spend hours just listening.
Cas does what he does best. He buries himself in work. He gets up early in the morning, goes out for a run while the mist is still clinging to the ground, eats a bowl of cereal, absentmindedly, leaning against the counter, gets a large black coffee on the walk over to the office and then – there’s no room to think of anything but work.
“I remember the night I went on a date when I was human,” he starts as soon as he’s near enough for Dean to hear him.
“It was my fault,” he says, quiet, and more to Dean than to their brothers. “And I’m sorry I ran away.”
“My dad has always been… well… principle and discipline are very important for him. He says the family business can only succeed if he leads with an iron hand. No taking the Lord’s name in vain, no loud laughing. Everyone in the family had their tasks to do and mistakes… uhm, you do well not to make them.”
But who‘s Dean to throw stones.
“Dean?”
Dean grins. "Ah, but you love me."
He can’t. Others might be able to draw a clear line between fun and love, can have sex without a deeper connection, but Cas is broken somehow, he can’t have one without the other. He loathes himself for it, in this very moment, but he can’t change how he feels. And Dean, if he saw even the slightest chance this could turn into something serious, would have told his brother, wouldn’t he? At least that he met someone, even if he didn’t mention the name. Dean had looked at him when Sam apparently had asked about his vacation, and made up his mind to keep quiet.
Everywhere they touch, his skin lights up with sensation, heightened by the wet cotton that rubs against his sensitive skin. His hands travel down over Dean’s broad back, the dip of his hips to cup his ass with both hands. The motion brings their bodies closer and Dean arcs into him with a wanton little sound. Their lower bodies brush against each other, a dance almost, and Cas feels Dean filling out through the layers of wet clothing just as he hardens with each beat of his heart.
“Now that was fun,” he singsongs and walks over to Cas, blade already in his hand. “Too bad we don’t have champagne to celebrate. I’ll settle for next best thing, though.” He slices a new wound into Cas’ throat without the slightest hesitation, and it makes Dean sick to watch it. The old wounds don’t close as well as the first one, and Dean can see the tissue around the cuts redden with infection. Cas won’t make it much longer.
Dean had always planned to ask Cas about the old times, when they had time for things like that, when they would share meals at the bunker and buy a couch and swap stories. His heart clenches. He will never get to ask him now.
They don’t talk. They sit down and eat, and they still don’t talk. Cas gets up to make coffee, because Dean didn’t. He felt intimidated by the Italian machine, he tells Cas. Cas putters around with the freshly ground beans. He doesn’t use the machine often since the coffee shop is right around the corner, but now he’s glad he spent the money on this monstrous contraption. It gives him the chance to turn his back and look busy while he goes over the facts again. He feels calmer when he sits back down, but none the wiser.
“I like it.” They stand like that for a long moment, just looking at each other.
The mist clung to the slope of the hills with the bone white fingers of a drowning man. Dean was thankful for the horse under his thighs, warm and alive in the dim half-world of the early March morning. He lost sight of the figure in front of him from time to time. The broad back of his father, stiff and proud, was swallowed by long tendrils of fog whenever they fell more than two horses lengths apart.
His last words were barely more than a whisper and Dean strained to hear them, he needed to hear them, grabbed them like a life line. He started shaking again, not from the cold this time, but from the emotional turmoil and the overwhelming feeling of gratitude. Against better knowledge, Cas had faith in him. That had to count for something.
, she had said,
“Well, well, if that isn’t the cheap copy of the angel Castiel,” he taunts.
From a strategic point of view, that’s a good idea.
“Oh, I didn’t know –“
The small lift at the right corner of Castiel’s mouth didn’t qualify as a smile. If it had, Dean would have called it sad and bitter.
When Ellen’s rough laughter droned through the hallway to the cellar, Dean realized that he couldn’t remember when he had last heard such a sound at home. He grabbed the burlap sack full of onions tighter and swung it over his shoulder before he reached the narrow staircase.
Dean feels Cas bristling beside him at the name, but chooses to ignore it.
Gabe pipes up. “Okay, okay, stop it please, my blood sugar’s a problem as it is.”
– it beats his blood inside his skull,
Dean closes his eyes, as if the barrier of his lids could keep Castiel out. Dean has walls upon walls built around him, some of them old, some new since he came back from hell. Since Castiel gripped his soul and brought it back to life.
Over the sound of the shower, they hear Sam actually
Sam Winchester knows his brother well. It’s clear there’s something on Dean’s mind. Any day now, he will spill the beans. Until then, Sam will have to be patient.
She nods. “I knew right away you’re not local. This place doesn’t offer much … variety.” Her smile is wide and brilliant. Dean orders them another drink, mostly to have time to think of something interesting to say. His social skills are not as smooth as they used to be. While he waits for his drink, Cas leans against the bar next to him.
Dean grins and straightens. “You like what you see?”, he slurs, but he doesn’t sound too inebriated.
“Look at me, Cas. I know you want to. I can feel it,” he murmured, shocked by his own brazenness. He knew he would feel shame later for his behavior, but right now Cas’ hot skin and his trembling body filled his whole world. Dean rocked against him slowly, encouraging him to reciprocate. Their cocks slid together once more.
“I … could make coffee,” he offer lamely and points in the general direction of the kitchen.
A soft yellow light illuminates the walls, paints shadows on the crumbling bricks.
A slow buzz is building from the cocktails, his limbs are loose and relaxed, but anticipation is simmering just under his skin. He lets his free hand wander aimlessly over the inseam of his shorts, just to enjoy the way his skin prickles under the touch.
, he thought with a bitter kind of humor. His fight against sin seemed lost before the first attack.
“Yep,” Lucifer grins. “As is most of her kind. This is my world now,” he turns with his eyes glowing a deep red, “and I’ll do with it as I please.”
Dean remembers all too well the first time they had this conversation and chuckles despite himself.
Cas’ heart swells with the words, and he regrets his offhand reaction. Dean’s breathing evens out while Cas still ponders what he could say in answers. His lids grow heavy. Despite the stickiness of his cushion and the way the soft hairs on Dean’s thigh tickle him, he’s actually quite comfortable. The warm afterglow of his orgasm makes his limbs heavy. “You too,” he murmurs at last, and he’s too tired to feel silly about it. It’s true, even if it’s by far not all Cas could say about Dean.
Cas had meant to soothe him in a frightening situation a few weeks ago, and Dean had reveled in the warmth and the closeness like some wanton bitch. Disgusted by himself, he gripped his hands tighter and bowed his head until the tendons in his neck screamed. He could still tell exactly where Cas’ hands had lain on his back, how they had moved and centered him.
Cas doesn’t want to listen in while Dean speaks to his brother, but he’s not sure what he’s supposed to do. Dean gives no indication that he wants Cas to leave, his back is still turned to him, so Cas lies still and waits. It seems like Sam has a lot to say about his new job, while Dean just nods and hums in agreement. At one point, Dean turns quickly and meets Cas’ gaze for a second before he averts his eyes. Cas can’t decipher the look for the live of him.
He stops in his tracks.
Cas takes a slow step closer, until there’s only a few inches between their bodies. Dean’s heart stumbles before it picks up speed and thunders in his chest.
Cas leans back and holds out his hands. “Alright, alright,” he smiles, and Dean sets to work again, peels Cas out of his shirt and undershirt and drops his hands to Cas’ belt. Cas stays still and watches Dean, lifts his right foot when Dean taps against it to get him out of his shoes and socks. After a small eternity, Cas stands completely naked in the middle of the room while Dean’s eyes move over his skin.
It’s only one night and they’re both adults, he tells himself. Slowly, he nods.
Dean wriggles around in his seat.
Jack and Cas stand a few feet away. When Jack reaches out his hand, Dean shakes his head. Sam might trust the kid, but even if he got rid of Lucifer, Dean is not yet ready to trust him, too. Jack’s arms sinks slowly. Dean nods. His wounds will heal on their own.
Cas knows that voice, reacts to it on a molecular level, but his mind played tricks before. Warily, he lifts his head and faces the man next to him. Green eyes, full lips and a worried frown, all a bit blurred around the edges. Cas throat works, clicks around a name.
A voice drifted slowly into his perception.
This other angel – he wasn’t Cas and couldn’t be. He’s just a pale copy, Dean thinks, a replica. He fiercely hopes he won’t have to talk to him or even face him, afraid the bottled up rage behind his ribs will explode and let him tumble into the darkness he can feel lurking and pacing since Cas sank down in front of him, since Dean had gone to his knees on that beach. He will have to keep a safe distance from that danger.
Zachariah went on and on about the weakness of the flesh and the various ways to jeopardize one’s soul. Over the next weeks, Dean learned about the teachings of famous scholars on the matter and he couldn’t help but find a lot of them lacking.
Dean clears his throat. “I thought maybe you could dig something up? We’ve got to have intel here somewhere about wing grooming.”
“Yeah. How about tonight?” Dean asks and puts a finger under his chin to lift his face. His eyes are warm and sated, and they glow with something deeper than physical satisfaction.
Cas pushed up and turned them around in one quick motion. For a second, Dean was sure that Cas would get up and leave, that this terrifying and new thing between them was lost, and an apology started to form on his lips when Cas surged down and pressed his mouth on Dean’s. Cas hands found his and pressed them into the soft earth while his hips ground down. Dean cried out. Cas swallowed the sound.
Sam elbows Gabe at that. “Hey, my brother’s not a rapist, okay?” He turns back to Dean. “But, yeah, Dean, why’d you change your mind? And why the hell didn’t you tell me?”
“I slept on your couch, man. Making breakfast is the least I could do.”
“I want to,” Cas hears himself say, eerily detached from the scene around them.
Closes it.
Dean doesn’t seem to have a problem with the proximity. He leans closer and throws his arm around Cas’ shoulders in a casual gesture without really touching him, just restsing his arm on the back of the bench. Cas can feel the heat of Dean’s skin even with that inch of space between them. He hasn’t yearned for a touch like this in a long time. Dean’s breath meets his cheek when he speaks again and Cas tries not to shiver.
Dean mumbles something accusatory under his breath, and his obvious embarrassment somehow loosens something in Cas. He sits back and chuckles. “It was a very special night,” he agrees, making it clear he won’t say more. “Wait, you are Charlie?” he asks, because he just realized that – this is Charlie.
Rising.
And so he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Dialectics.”
He gets back to the room and packs his suitcase, pausing now and then to look at the bed with its still rumpled sheets. On an impulse, he lays down on Dean’s side and tries to make out his scent on the pillow. It’s still there, faint, but unmistakable. He inhales deeply, shocked to find his body responding to the fragrance. He doesn’t do anything about it, just lets the soft hum of arousal flood through him.
Dean saw his hands trembling. He had focused all his anger on his mother for so long that he somehow hadn’t realized how much he missed his brother. Now the ache came back with so much force it took his breath away. He pressed his shaking hands against his ribs, suddenly dizzy.
“Duh, Cas. We were just invited to a pot roast. No way I’m missing that.”
He turned around and squared his shoulders.
“What?”
He shuffles back against a beam, grateful that the rope allows him that much range, and leans against it with a heavy sigh.
Hubris. He had been presumptuous again.
Soon it’s clear Cas can’t concentrate on what he’s doing like before. Not when Dean swirls his tongue like that. The vibrations of Dean’s moans add to the sensation, so Cas takes Dean deeper to make Dean moan more, until each bob of his head brings a double reward with it. It looks like Dean is following the same plan, hell-bent on making Cas lose his mind in no time.
Cas stares at it for a long time. Then he pushes the phone back to Dean, ghosts his fingers over Dean‘s open palm in the lightest of touches.
“I see you’re still not the talking kind.” Lucifer sounds disappointed. He sure likes to hear himself talk, but without anyone swallowing his bait, he loses interest quickly.
The answering silence is deafening.
But before Cas reaches the door, Dean curls a hand around his wrist to stop him. “We’ll face him together, okay?”
“You should do well to remember that, given your family’s history.”
Something moves over Castiel’s face just then, something warm and longing that makes Dean’s heart beat faster and his palms sweat. But it’s gone as soon as it came and Dean’s not sure if it was just a trick played by the dying light of the day.
Castiel edges closer to examine the memory. Just like he did that night in the kitchen, he can see Dean’s rapid heartbeat, and the way he licks his lips. But it means something different now. Now that Castiel has learned more about human nature and more about Dean.
Cas wants to stay with him.
When Gabe catches up with him, Cas pokes a finger in his chest. “You–!”
Cas’ eyes are wide while he stares at Dean, and Dean holds his gaze, wondering how he could have been so blind. He wants all those things, too, and more. He wanted them for a very long time, but he’d never … ever even dared to hope Cas’d want them, too. His hand is shaking when he lifts it to put his palm gently over Cas’ heart, a thrill running down his spine when he realizes the touch is not only allowed but will be welcomed. Cas closes his eyes as if he’s hurting. Cas’ heart thumps steady under Dean’s hand, solid and real, but his breath is coming fast.
He has to go.
“Thank you, Jack.” He wobbles on his feet and grips Sam’s shoulder. “What did you do to Lucifer?”
The light is dim, but Sam’s almost sure Dean is blushing. What on earth is Dean trying to tell him here?
Dean’s arms come up around Cas’ neck to pull him closer. Heat rushes along Cas’ spine and pools deep inside him, and that’s before Dean opens his plush lips and darts out his tongue to get a taste. They meet hesitantly, just a slow tangle, but it sets Cas’ nerves on fire like few kisses ever did. There’s something about the way Dean explores him, sighs against his lips and presses his whole body against him, that makes him forget that they’re technically still strangers, that Cas is an uptight laywer and Dean a sexy mechanic, that they have next to nothing in common – right here, right now, they’re just Cas and Dean, who fit against each other like two pieces of a puzzle.
“It wasn’t even an hour since we’ve seen each other. “ Dean’s eyebrow lifts at Cas’ no-nonsense tone of voice, the one he uses in court and, with much less success, with his brother. Dean is just as immune to it as Gabe, it seems.
“It’s you,” he murmurs, and he reaches out with his bound hands as if he wants to touch, to make sure Dean is real. Dean’s stomach heaves.
Dean cleared his throat but didn’t answer right away.
“A few scholars believe it to be the effect of an overactive imagination and deep emotions,” Cas told him in a voice that betrayed his unease.
“What are you doing here, Dean?”
Cas reached out but Dean ducked away.
He had set out to defeat the sin in his veins, the inherited evil. He had been arrogant in the face of Zachariah’s older years and better education. How could he know that the monk had been wrong? Pride was a deadly sin just like the lust his mother had bequeathed to him.
Dean’s not sure if Cas means Dean wouldn’t be fast enough or if Cas trusts him that much. He ignores how the second option lets his heart swell, even as the first option hurts his pride.
“I vomited,” Cas clarifies, and earns a grin.
Dean didn’t look up.
“He ran away a few weeks before I was sent here. He had huge argument with my dad, said he didn’t want to become a merchant. He went to school a few years, since I could help with the daily work. His teacher got him a scholarship in Oxford. My father forbade it, and said Sam’s insolence was a sign of evil. After he was gone, my father never mentioned his name again. I… I try not to think too much about it.”
“After you left, at the Sunset Plaza, I waited. Wanted to see if you’d work through whatever made you run off. Patience is not my strong suit, but I tried, I really tried. But then … then my stupid brother tells me your brother wants to set you up with someone, and I … I snapped. I had to see you, see if you…”
He huffs a laugh. “Work. We’re just stopping by on our way home.”
“Yes.” Cas’voice is firm and solid. “Would you want to be kissed?”
,” Gabriel emphazises. “No need for me to feel bad, too. You seem to have that covered.”
“Like a real spy, sir?”
The doors burst open ten minutes later, and in strolls a very self-satisfied Lucifer. Dean’s hands clench with the urge to wipe that grin off his face. Lucifer squares his shoulders and shakes himself like a boxer after the final blow.
Dean rolls his eyes. „Dude, you came around the corner five seconds ago.”
Cas feels like he’s falling. He’s falling far too fast for this wonderful, funny, hot man he just met, and there’s no safety net to catch him, only Dean and his warm green eyes and his strong hand stroking up and down his back. There’s a good chance his heart will be crushed when he reaches the ground. He swallows down his fear. And jumps.
Dean is only half-listening. “Ah yes, poor Conrad. An aneurysm, the doctor said.”
There are still ten or more people waiting in front of them. Cas counts it as a small blessing that he’s not standing eye to eye with the man he spent half his teenage years jerking off to. He shoots his brother a look. Gabe grins from ear to ear. Cas realizes in a moment of perfect clarity that won’t get out of this, even if every fiber of his body screams at him to run and never come back.
Whenever he glances over at Dean, he finds him smiling a little, and Cas’ heart jumps every time he sees that curl of his lips, that warm sparkle in his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
He does the dishes, feeds a few scraps to Miracle.
“You are a very good swimmer,” Cas said.
“Thank you,” he murmured.
He rummages in his drawer for a pair of old sweats and a black t-shirt to wear, and when Dean slips into the clothes – a little too tight around the shoulders, a little too short on the legs – he can’t help the surge of possessiveness at seeing Dean in his clothes, in his bedroom, lips still a little puffy and wet hair sticking up in all directions.
“His prizes must be worthwhile if he can spend every night at a whorehouse,” Cas muses. Unbidden images of Winchester, naked, in the embrace of an equally naked woman arise somewhere in the back of his head and are pushed down immediately. He clears his throat and loosens his collar. He still isn’t used to the Caribbean heat it seems.
An hour later, Cas can’t say for sure his time with Dean ever happened. Could he have imagined it all? Is he losing his mind? He rips small pieces from the label in his bottle – a task that’s taking all his concentration at this point – and tries to remember the details of their time together. They come in bits and pieces after he denied himself to think about it for so long. The color of Dean’s eyes. The small wrinkles when he smiled. His smell. The softness of his skin.
Sin, he had always thought, had to be something that hurt somebody, that jeopardized your soul because what you did was evil. Why should this indulgence, that he was sure was more than common amongst young men, be wrong? He hadn’t realized he’d spoken aloud until Zachariah’s massive body filled his line of vision completely. The monk looked down at him with pure hatred in his eyes.
The darkness envelopes him when the portal closes, slowly cutting him off from the world.
“I … could smell you,” Cas stammers as he strokes along his length and tightens his fingers around the tip.
Dean finds a nice restaurant in walking distance from the hotel and sends Cas the address. There’s a smiling emoji next to it, so Cas sends the same back.
want?”
Sam’s face settles into what can best be described as the universal
Wednesday mornings became his favorite just after Thursday afternoons, which he still spent with Cas. Dean didn’t need the mentoring anymore since he had long caught up with the other students, but neither of them pointed that out. When autumn drew nearer and dusk came earlier, Dean fell back into his brooding mood. Cas picked up on it instantly.
Dean thinks back to their meeting on the battlefield. For some reason, the angel recognized him, didn’t he? Did someone tell him about Dean? In that moment, Dean had been too shell-shocked to ask about it. Now the question burns in the back of his brain, insistent like a buzzing fly.
And he throws up.
“What are you doing here? You’re ice cold.”
“Your mouth,” Cas manages to say.
He presses his hands against the cool wall next to the entrance and leans forward, not sure if he wants to scream or throw up or both.
“Come in, Dean, and sit down. We will have time to talk later.”
Cas had said what he said, leaving Dean no chance to respond, no chance to wrap his head around it.
And then, then Dean’s lips close around him again and Dean’s hand picks up the speed. A shout rips from Cas' lungs at the sudden stimulation.
Thank you guys for your comments and for subscribing. That really means a lot!
Cas needs a moment for the words to register. The sun is streaming golden through the window, bringing with it a breeze that smells of the first harvest. Dean’s head is turned to the wall, and his fingers are fisted into the fabric of his bedding as if he’s trying not to punch something.
Cas is no better off. His suit had grown a myriad of new wrinkles, forming an uneven landscape that no iron in this world will ever get straight again.
This war isn’t like anything he ever experienced. The lines are unclear, the factions seemingly fighting for the sake of bloodshed, a constant rage pulsing thought he empty streets with no clear goal or gain. Angels against the demons, against their own kind, and the scattered humans smack in the middle, trying to get rid of both invading armies. Dean has only been here a few weeks, but the desperation and the hopelessness of their endeavor already seeped into his very bones. He’s got no idea how Bobby, Ash and the others find the strength to keep going. And Lucifer’s arrival just tipped the scales even farther down on the wrong side.
Dean didn’t want Castiel to heal him, and Castiel will honor Dean’s wishes, but he can ease his pain without Dean ever knowing. For every rule, there is a way around it, Castiel learned. He learned it from Dean.
Dean tries to turn around to see what’s happening, but his neck is stiff and his shoulder hurts like hell.
Cas makes his way through the throng of people waiting at the bar and finds Gabe in a booth next to the snooker table. Sam sits next to him, long legs stretched out under the table. Cas can’t be sure in the low light, but he thinks he can see a hand that’s definitely not Sam’s resting on his thigh. Covering a smile with a cough, he greets his colleagues. So Dean’s not here. The sudden ache in his heart is piercing, but he tells himself he’s relieved.
He packs his bags, trying not to think about what happened in Dean’s room and refusing to look too closely at his decisions. When he takes one last look around the room to make sure he didn’t miss anything he realizes his cheeks are wet with tears. Cas wipes at them angrily and shuts the door behind him.
Dean licks his lips and Cas can practically feel his gaze on his own mouth. “Hmmm, yeah. I might even tell you that I’m a little bit disappointed that you straightened your hair. You looked gorgeous this morning, all tousled and turned on.”
Mrs Smith is as brightly dressed and unsettlingly cheerful as the first time Cas saw her. He gives his condolences – that’s what FBI agents do when they speak to the grieving –, but Mrs Smith interrupts him.
“Come on, Dean, really? I’m a grown person, you know –“, but Dean talks right over him, pointing a finger at Gabe. Cas, relieved that the focus shifted from him, watches his brother closely, curious how this will unfold.
Gabe clears his throat as if he’s only now remembering they’re not alone in the room. “I wanted to introduce you to my brother anyway. He came back early from his trip.” The brown eyes of the young man flicker over to Cas, a smile on his lips. Cas stands and walks over, extends his hand which is met with a good, tight grip. His heart thunders in his chest, but he tries to keep his gaze levelled and his breathing shallow.
The drink leaves a sour taste in Cas’ mouth. He swallows the bile that rises in his throat. “Can I talk to you for minute? Alone?”
It’s a wide and luxurious room. Dark wood and deep red tapestries give it an intimate impression. Small memory bubbles hang in the air like Christmas decorations, each one clear and sharp like glass.
“I’m an idiot,” Dean mumbles without leaving Cas too-soft lips.
Mrs Smith eyes Cas dubiously, but puts on a smile and leaves with a flourish of underskirts. Cas takes a deep breath when he’s finally alone with Dean.
He upends the bin over the bed and reads through each and every one. Dean must have sat here this morning, trying to find the right words, and he started again and again. With each letter, something inside Cas’ chest unfolds and spreads. There’s nothing casual about the way Dean wanted to make sure to get this simple note right. When he read them all, Cas sits on the bed, crumpled sheets of paper in his trembling hands, throat tight with emotion.
The phone is chipped and mangled, has fallen to the ground in one fight or the other too many times. It was cheap to begin with, a kid‘s phone really, that Dean picked up in a rundown store one day and gifted to Cas with a tense “It‘s time you have your own, just in case“ that Cas answered with a huff and a crooked smile.
His ribs hurt. Lucifer might have cracked a few, and every breath brings with it a stab of pain that sears through his whole right side. He’s much better off than Cas, though, who slips in and out of consciousness and lost the ability to hold himself up in his restraints somewhere between nightfall and now.
The strain of the day weighs his shoulders down, his muscles ache with fatigue.
Cas sighs. It was worth a try.
The panties are wet from Dean’s desire and Cas can smell him, can smell them both in the warm air of the room, fresh sweat and spicy musk. He needs to taste more, wants to lick the sweat from Dean’s skin, so he moves down, bites the sharp curve of his jaw, the soft skin of his neck, dips his tongue into the hollow of his collarbone. Dean is urging him on with broken gasps that turn into a soft cry when Cas find his right nipple and closes his lips around it, sucks it into his mouth and rolls his tongue around it. Dean’s hand comes up to curve around his neck, tender almost, holds him while Cas nips and licks the sensitive nub into hardness.
Father Robert’s gaze moved between the two of them. He sighed and let go of Dean’s hand. “Well, we will see what we can do with you.” His big palm landed on Dean’s shoulder. “Say goodbye to your father, child, and then go to the kitchen. You look like you can use a bowl of hot broth.” He turned and shuffled over to the door of a drab stone building. Its chimneys added tufts of white to the still misty air.
With his hands framing Dean’s face, Cas leans in again, until he’s whispering right against Dean’s lips. “But I found you again.”
Dean has already lost his shirt and busies himself with the buttons of his jeans. He curses under his breath, but then he finally manages to open it. The soft blue fabric reveals something … purple? Cas’ breath catches in his throat. Dean shimmies out of his jeans, and yes, okay, he’s wearing lace panties. He’s really wearing dark purple lace panties, and Cas is too young to die.
Cas’ head snaps up. “Why tomorrow? Are we staying?”
Dean stirs at his side, and now Cas feels that he’s not alone in this uncomfortable situation. Dean is pressed to his hip, and he’s hard just like Cas. Dean smacks his lips and then seems to realize what’s happening. He rolls away and mumbles, “Oh sorry, I’m gonna…”. He points to the bathroom and shuffles out of bed and over to the door.
“Nothing.” Cas looks down on his folder, rearranges his pen in a straight angle to the edge of his desk.
He kneels down on the bed and moves over Dean’s body, not touching yet, until he’s bracketing Dean’s hips with his thighs and holds up his upper body with his hands next to Dean’s head. Dean leans up to capture Cas’ lips again, and it’s more hungry this time, darker and sensual, and Cas gasps when Dean’s teeth sink into his lower lip and bite him, just this side of painful. Dean tugs on his shirt, and he falls down onto Dean’s waiting body, close from head to thighs, the contact shocking a moan out of him.
“I don’t usually do this,” Cas hears himself say, though that should be obvious by now. He’s completely out of his depth.
The fight drags on until the weak sun settles behind the horizon. They have won, but at a high cost. A dozen fighters dead, twenty injured. Lucifer is still holed up in the city somewhere with the largest part of his army. Dean slumps next to Ash and takes the offered bottle without asking what it is. Battery acid, from the smell, but Dean isn’t picky. He forces down the booze, lets it burn his throat and warm his stomach.
Jack really is. Powerful. All-knowing. It doesn’t scare him anymore. They taught Jack all they had to teach him, and now they have to have faith that it was enough.
, because it would sound wrong, even though it is true. It’s his fault that he developed feelings like teenager, it’s his fault that he can’t enjoy the good thing they had without ruining it. He tries on a small smile that feels brittle and sad. “Would you tell him that I had to go?”
The flush of her cheeks isn’t just from the hot shower. Jack and Dean share an awkward smile with her. “Thanks for this,” she mumbles, before slipping back out of the room, already taking a bite of toast on the way. Dean’s glad for them, he really is. He’ll have to live with the pang in his chest that goes along with it.
Cas mumbles something. Without turning away from his new companion, Dean asks, “Cas, why don’t you stop bickering and take a look around. Maybe you’ll meet someone you like?”
His brother’s voice pops into his head out of nowhere.
“What the hell, Cas? Warn a guy!”
“I’d love that.”
There’s the fact that this Cas knows things he shouldn’t know, knows Dean’s vernacular and stuff from their world. And there’s the fact that Cas looks at Dean as if he knows him. He looks at Dean as if he
“I know. Heard a lot about you. The name’s Ash. Saw you fight today.” He grabs the bottle and drinks before wiping his mouth and burping.
“Yeah, I’d really like to know, too.”
“I came all over the sink, a few drops even hit the mirror,” Dean tells him. “I came so hard, thinking about your mouth and your hands and that angry squint you gave me at the reception, as if you wanted to bend me over your knee in front of all those people and give me a good spanking.”
“But-“ Bradbury beams at him. “I overheard a few of Winchester’s crewmen talk about having to take the chance for a good… uh…”
“Dean.” Cas circles his hips, his stomach flexes with it, the grip of his hands almost painful. “I need you – ah-“
Sam would eat that shit up, Dean thinks, and smiles a little, careful not to reopen the cut on his lip. For all the years he spent hunting monsters, Dean was never one to ponder the theoretical ins and outs apart from what he had to know to kill something. Of all times to start diving into it, this was definitely not the best one.
“Oh yeah, we have. You should see mine.” He smiles a small smile that feels fake but Danny returns it genuinely. They delve into stories about cars; Danny tells him how the oil fields and the refineries and the stations stopped working after the first wave of angels vs. demons and how everything went to shit after. They pass husks of burned out and stranded cars now and then, stripped of everything useful, silent and constant reminders that this world is nothing like the one Dean left behind. Danny seems wistful but he is starved for stories about a better place, eager to tell him about the time before when he had a boyfriend and a family and they met to eat burgers and beers.
Cas never wanted much from life – a job that fulfills him, his own space, enough free time to read, maybe house with a garden someday. He likes to be on his own and can spend hours looking at a wall and daydream. The kind of happiness he saw in others always seemed like a distant dream. A dream he stopped himself from dreaming years ago.
After a long while in which she seems to look right through him, analyzes his behavior on a molecular level for all Cas knows, Charlie nods.
They didn’t talk about a dress code, but Cas digs into his suitcase to find his suit at the bottom of it. It’s wrinkled and a bit too large since he lost some weight over the last stressful moths, but he wants to dress in something special for his first real date with Dean.
The motions stopped and Dean looked up. He could see that Cas tried to school his features, but there was fear beneath the leveled gaze. Cas’ eyes wandered over Dean before coming to rest on a point over his shoulder. The fact that he wouldn’t meet Dean’s eyes hadn’t bothered Dean in the last months. Now it hurt again.
He cocks an eyebrow and licks his lips. “You were gone an eternity,” he shoots back.
Cas turns his head, which brings his face dangerously close to Dean’s. “Would you now?”
And now, of course, Cas had found the solution, had cornered Dean with that confession out of the blue, all packed into a description of Dean that he couldn‘t possibly mean, even though Dean knows that Cas is crazy like that, faithful enough to mean every word, that he really sees him this way, because that‘s part of who they are, aren‘t they, of why Dean loves him, for the way he can see a better version of himself in Cas‘ eyes; he gets up in the morning to finally live up to that image, to be worthy to stand on that fucking pedestal Cas had built for him; failing, yes, failing time and time again, but nonetheless trying.
“But there’s not much else I could do. Bobby led a few of his fighters to search for Lucifer, but I stayed back because I wanted to come back to you first.” She underlines something on a sheet in front of her, distracted, before her head snaps up and her eyes twinkle with excitement. “Oh, I totally forgot. I met their Castiel! He’s an angel warrior, you wouldn’t recognize him.”
Dean reached out and took the offered goods.
He finds a dive next to the highway, not much more than a shack, but with a neon sign outside promising a pool table and cool beers.
Except sometimes, he does.
“Don’t touch me.”
of it all, works wonders to get his erection under control, while the cold water does the rest.
“Sir, I’ll ask you to step back.” Something flickers in Dean’s eyes, there and gone in the fraction of a second, but Cas sees it. He’s seen it before today, but he never called Dean out on it. This situation, though, demands desperate measures.
Cas rolls his eyes.
Cas has never been good at taking orders, but he finds that he doesn’t mind following Dean’s, not when it shuts Dean up like that. Dean’s erection is a heavy weight on his tongue. He’s done this before but for some reason it feels like the first time. Dean’s reactions to everything he does heightens the experience into something completely new. Dean’s vocal about it, too, a fact that Cas learns to love, and he maps out every sound that falls from Dean’s lips, proud that he’s the reason. His tongue against Dean’s frenulum results in gasped out groans; when he dips into the slit he’s rewarded with a sweet sigh; when he opens his jaw wide and sinks down, down, down, until the head nudges his throat, broken, hoarse curses tumble out of Dean.
, Zachariah had said. Cas had been attending his classes, too, a few years before Dean came to the monastery. Did Cas believe this? Did he think… that Dean was a bad influence? Or did he not trust himself enough to find out what would happen if he let Dean in?
“Put your head between your knees and try to breathe shallowly,” Cas told him, concern clear in his voice. Dean obeyed and waited for the fog to clear. Cold sweat broke out on his neck.
He goes through the motions.
He swallows down the tennisball-sized lump in his throat and nods his thanks, before he turns and runs from the lobby.
“You mean the holiday you came back from so heart-broken that I wondered if I’d have to plant surveillance in your house?” Gabe asks back through his teeth, and Cas senses Dean’s head turning to him, his gaze intense like a touch on the side of his face.
“So Garth told me a joke the other day.”
Even now he hoped they could be this close again. When he let his mind drift, it fled to images of him and Cas in a tight embrace, keeping each other warm and safe. Their closeness hadn’t felt wrong. Their friendship was grounded in this comfort.
It feels like the beginning of something, and this time, Cas will be brave enough to grasp it with both hands.
“See something interesting yet?” Dean asks.
“I will let him know the next time I see him,” Cas bites out. He always prided himself for his ability to stay calm in the most heated arguments but something about Winchester’s arrogant demeanor gets to him and infuriates him more the longer the conversation lasts. Winchester’s bright green eyes follow his every movement, surely making all kinds of assumptions about his abilities as a leader.
The orgasm ripples through Cas in a long wave, starting at his head and moving of his chest and stomach, until he pulses in his own hand, clenches long and hard around Dean. With a positively filthy groan that will haunt Dean’s favorite dreams, Cas is splattering his release all over Dean’s shirt, and Dean can’t do anything but thrust one, two more times before he’s right there with Cas, coming hard and with a guttural moan that rips right out of his lungs.
“I don’t mind being looked at,” Dean answers and wriggles his hips a bit. “And it’s not like I have to be afraid you’ll jump me. It’s like … changing in front of a doctor.”
Falling.
“Honey, I’m fine.” Mary turns to a guy he doesn’t recognize. “Could you bring us some water?” She goes over to the big table in the middle of the room, covered with maps and notes. Dean sees Mary’s handwriting on some of the papers.
So. Much. Fluff.
Bradbury does as ordered. Winchester is brought before Cas the next morning. He’s wearing the same black clothes as the last times Cas saw him, rumpled now and smelling like booze and small dark rooms with too many unwashed men in it. Cas curls his nose.
, Dean thinks almost fondly – but he smiles back.
Dean has feeling Lucifer doesn’t expect an answer, so he doesn’t give one.
Robert Singer built a house at the edge of the monasteries’ land, a small stone house for him and his wife to live in. The heavy oak door is closed this early in the morning. Cas knocks against the wood and waits. It doesn’t take long until the hinges creak and a face appears. Brown hair, bound into a practical bun, piercing eyes surrounded by crinkles that only grow from laughing.
Dean’s grin widens at what must be a slightly stunned expression, but doesn’t comment.
Cas smiles. This whole situation is ridiculous, but he has to admit, he hasn’t felt this good in a long time. In a few minutes, he will clean this mess and leave the bathroom and Dean will be there.
Every day for the next four days Dean spent an hour on his knees, hungry, cold and with bruised skin. Every single one of these hours he cursed his mother and prayed for guidance to avert the same fate. Every hour led his thoughts to Cas and how he seemed the only living soul that really cared for Dean.
Gabe and Sam go dancing at one point, and Cas doesn’t mind staying behind alone. He drinks and he wallows. A few beers in, he’s convinced that Dean was invited but didn’t show up because he didn’t want to see Cas. Two shots later, he’s sure Dean wouldn’t know Cas would be here, because let’s be honest – would Sam talk about his sorry ass when he told stories about work?
The phone vibrates again.
Dean doesn’t seem to mind, though. “Yeah, I thought so.”
They should undress, he thinks hazily, and take this to his bed. He’d spread Dean out and cover each inch of his skin with his mouth and hands. Growing up in a catholic household, he never much cared for the spiritual. But here, with Dean in his arms, he might see the appeal to worship and loose oneself in it.
They’ve talked about this. Jack had asked him to wait, to give him some time to find out the best way to handle this. And Dean trusted him enough to stay put. Mostly because he didn’t want to screw up their slim chances by just confronting the Empty. He
as Dean sets the phone down. The small sound echoes through the room with a sense of finality. Cas grips the door handle with a sweating palm, the other hand holding the shirt so tight it hurts. He can feel Dean’s gaze on his back, and fights the urge to turn around and tell Dean it’s been a mistake, of course he can stay.
Dean swallows the rising panic in his throat and takes a deep breath to calm his stumbling heart. Cas needs his help, and however uncomfortable that makes him, this isn’t about him. Seeing how close they are … were … whatever, it might be understandable that Cas has questions about the nature of their relationship.
He turns it on.
“Yes sir. I would think that means they’ll have to go without for a while.” He tips his index finger against his temple. “Don’t you think?”
Silence falls between them again. Dean is drowsy, likely from a blow to the head, and he reminds himself to stay awake. He blinks when Castiel speaks up again.
As it turns out, Dean doesn’t get the time to talk to Castiel.
Cas reaches out his hand – his arms weighs about a ton – and wipes a drop of come from Dean’s bottom lip. “I’ll never doubt you again,” he answers.
Cas closes his eyes halfway through, bites down on his cheeks hard enough to draw blood, to keep himself from throwing up. He fervently wishes he could close his nose and ears, too. Nevertheless, he doesn’t let up in his task. Both his hands are curled around Dean right thigh, digging into the clammy, trembling flesh, dusted with soft auburn hair that tickles the sides of his hands. Sam and Charles hold down one shoulder each. Sam whispers reassurance in a steady stream. “I’m here, Dean, everything will be alright, I’m here.”
Sam made it his habit long ago to state the obvious when nobody else seems inclined to. In these matters, Dean tends to be a little dense. “Have you considered asking him?”
When he comes to, he finds him self in a dimly lit warehouse. Of course it’s a warehouse. Concrete and steel, abandoned years ago, the usual. The weak sunlight filters into the building through busted windows. Dust motes dance in the long streaks. The air smells like mildew, dust, metal and blood.
“I couldn’t help but notice that you’re wearing panties,” he muses.
The events of the last days are a jumbled mess in his mind. He tries to sort through the new facts he learned but his thoughts are hazy and sluggish.
Knowing that they’ll spend the night together does nothing to soothe the tension between them. Cas wants to draw it out, bottle the feeling of possibility up to take it home with him. He gets lost in Dean’s eyes for long moments and lets his mind wander to what will happen next. He wants to explore more of Dean, find out more about what he likes and give it to him with abandon. Dean promised there would be oral sex involved, and Cas’ dick twitches at the thought of those sinful lips wrapped around him. It’s like Dean can read his thoughts, because he licks his lips again, slowly and deliberate, even though the dessert is long gone.
More nodding.
Cas stayed silent for a long time. Dean eyed him from the side, unsure if his friend was appalled by his confession or disgusted that Dean still had good memories of her. Cas’ face looked thoughtful, though. At last, he spoke.
He’s not. Can’t be.
Castiel perceives all of it, but over the last weeks, his perspective shifted. He’s no longer an impartial bystander. The life of one single human, no more than a mote of dust compared to his existence, shifted the very foundation of what makes him the angel Castiel. Castiel knows what is happening to him, he has been aware of it for some time now. To raise a soul from hell comes with a price. Once an angel takes a human essence inside him to lift it from perdition, a bond is formed.
. It reminds him that Dean cares. Even if it’s only for Cas’ professional appearance.
Sam smiles at the words.
Charlie’s eyes are wide and full of sympathy. Cas has to look away, because the pressure behind his eyes rises again and his throat feels like he’s being strangled.
Dean’s hand slides down slow, slow, mesmerizingly slow while his words sink in and Cas’ pulse picks up speed. Cas watches as Dean mimics the position, head hanging low, bottom lip sucked back behind his teeth.
“If you can’t draw them, maybe you can carve them?”
Cas rubbed his neck.
Even if he felt miserable, he knew he had gotten a chance here. John could have decided to throw him out on the streets, or hire him off to another merchant. Here, Dean had a choice. He could learn and maybe even go to university.
Cas tilts his head.
“Anything on Cas?” he asks, before turning around. The question has been asked quite a few times by now.
Dean’s fingertips glide down his side in a torturously slow pace, over his ribs, into the dip of his stomach, over the bump of his hipbone, leaving Cas shivering. Dean’s gaze falls into the space between them and Cas follows it. The water is clear enough to make out the contours of their tented shorts.
The bits and pieces of what Cas said echo through him, out of order, jumbled. His muddled brain picks them up and tries to lodge the edges together in new ways to make the whole picture less daunting.
Cas clutched at his sides and inhaled unsteadily. He wasn’t laughing. Hot tears fell onto Dean’s shoulder and a viscous sob wrecked Cas’ body. Dean wound his arms around him and held tight. He had no words to soothe him. While he watched the soft white clouds pass over the summer sky, Dean drew small circles on Cas’ back and waited for him to cry his heart out.
The last building was the school. Like the church, it could be entered from outside the monastery’s outer walls. About twenty children from the nearby village attended the classes and learned to read and write. Garth passed two rooms and stopped in the doorway of a third. Dean came up behind him and peeked over his shoulder. About twelve students – aged between ten and fifteen – sat on the floor and listened, obviously enraptured by their tutor's lecture.
“There’s nothing for you to feel sorry about. He got himself killed – I guess you’re aware of that impulse you get to play knight in shining armor since you just pulled the same stunt. Cas,” it hurts to speak his name, but Dean pushes it out from his chest, “he had that dumbass hero complex, too.”
Dean felt his throat tighten all of a sudden. Unable to get a word out, he nodded. When Cas was gone, he didn’t even know what he would have said.
Dean’s shoes, well-worn dark brown work boots with one of the black laces frayed at the end, – what an interesting detail to notice –, are the last thing Cas sees before his eyes squeeze shut.
Dean shakes his head. “Don’t be silly. Nobody wants to leave this place. Why would they?”
He feels like he could burst any moment, more turned on than he’s been in a long time, but he’s unable to tell Dean, or do something about it other than push into Dean’s touch. Dean seems to sense his need, and tightens his hand with a low chuckle against his lips. He turns his head slightly to mouth along Cas’ jaw and along the sensitive spot behind his ear.
