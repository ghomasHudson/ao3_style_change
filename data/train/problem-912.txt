‘Well, that was certainly weird. Back to you, don’t let him get into your head and mess with what he sees in you. He will always take advantage of that.’
‘No worries about that, we knew it would be hard. Funny that now even the nurses agree with me being here rather than his family. Has Mary been here?’ The thought had occurred to him that she’d be interested in making an appearance if she was indeed involved.
Sherlock was happy. Everyone could see it when they retired for the night. Getting ready the lilo in Sherlock’s room, their parents where in the guestroom, they joked for a bit before surrendering tired. ‘Thank you for being my friend John.’
‘Don’t be dull John. My brother warned me about respecting the lab time schedules, so there wouldn’t be enough time to do that many. You can do whatever the professor is asking during the session, just let me do this side project.’
‘What do you know that are not willing to tell me? Are you leaving me out of the investigation because I’m dating her?’
‘Is John not coming?’ Sherlock moved from his position by the window. He hadn’t noticed that he had moved there in the first place.
She left with mock exasperation as John and Sherlock headed back. It’s not often that Sherlock feels out of depth but right now he felt like drowning. Mycroft needed to be aware of the situation and Lestrade had to be on the same page. A body was about to appear in the next couple of days, and they would have to hope it didn’t belong to Miss Adler.
‘No wait! It’s me who you want. Who will send a message to Mycroft if you get rid of him? He tolerates John because he’s important to him, but if you really want to have power over Mycroft you need me. Send John to carry the message.’ Mary stood still waiting for an order as Moriarty looked pensive as if he was pondering the situation even if he wasn’t. Sherlock could see how the decision had been made the moment he passed John as if he was nothing but a pawn in the board. Disposable, a mean to an end.
‘You say adult but I’m certain you’re only a couple of years older than me. How much are you getting for getting rid of a couple of accountants? I’m sure that they weren’t aware that whatever job they were doing was part of a criminal network. I also hope you were able to study for tomorrow's exam.’
‘Whatever are you talking about?’ Trying to half-smile as in disbelieve, he left a nervous sigh. It didn’t go unnoticed and John turned to face him so fast that for a moment he thought he’d give himself a concussion. Sherlock new right then that he was about to hit a dead end.
‘No! Please don’t, I can help you with chemistry, biochemistry, and physics. John can come and help you with the rest. The thing is that I need this instead of the other option, which is rather awful if you think about it.’
There was nothing Lestarde or I could say to make him change his mind. It was after an hour or so that Sherlock came out from his room. I hadn’t noticed his absence until that moment, and I noted just how silence the room had been for a while. He was in jeans, blazer and a blond wig with a hat. He looked nothing like himself. Up to this moment I hadn’t seen his disguise.
‘Will she be able to see John? His family did give me permission after all. Has she got any clearance? Do they know they were dating?’ Questions were fired as soon as they appeared in his mind, Mycroft could see how he was getting anxious as his brain supplied every possible scenario. There was still a possibility that she thought Sherlock had passed on the information as of who was the murderer.
Hello everyone, I've underestimated my school load and have been unable to upload. Sorry for that. I'll be trying to keep up with my weekly uploads so as to keep the story moving. I wanted to do it parallel to this time, but I've messed up my own timeline. Things will be explained a bit later, I mentioned a case, but won't be giving out more. Hope you like it!
Harriet stood from her stool in the corner when Sherlock turned to John when he spoke, and was immediately at his side giving him a cup of water. There was silence as John sipped slowly and Sherlock tried not to scream, jump, run and press the button 20 times for a nurse to rush into the room. Harriet was a bit more composed and Sherlock was thankful that she never mentioned his anxiety the moment John stirred. He could listen her calling the nurse and someone taking John’s vitals. Everything was going to be alright. Except it didn’t.
The answer came barely above a whisper and his brother saw his pained expression before he could speak up even though it was a feeble attempt to communicate. He could see his baby brother as the child he was, a boy trying to understand a world that has been unable to stop for him to catch up in a society that moves far too slow to keep up with his brain. This was the small boy that would cry in crowded places and hide behind him when there was a loud unknown noise. It was close to a torture to see his brother so closed off after years of hard work and being home-schooled. He could still see echoes of that awkward boy that tried to fit yet never truly understood how to act.
He wanted to hide somewhere and perhaps die, with that statement he had revealed his weakest point to one of his enemies. It was up to her to take things as they were said and use them against him, or demonstrate her worth and show him that she was on his side. Whatever that might mean at this point as she could very well be like The Woman and just be looking for a way out of a business that got out of control and ultimately threatened her life. Yet she smiled at him and went to release him from his binds and cuffs.
‘What is going on is that he didn’t commit the past three murders. He’s far taller than the assailant, if it was him he should be at least your size. You are letting the situation muck your thinking and observation skills!’ He turned to Mycroft towards the end, that statement was clearly thrown at his in a despective manner as he often reminds John of his inability to see things as clear as he did. Both went silent for a moment, Sherlock was still fuming and his exasperation was as tangible as ever.
‘First, if you must really know, it’s not dog’s hair, it’s human. Second, I just wanted to see if it is possible to identify pigments from single strands. Separate the components that stick to the hair and identify the different brands of dye there are.’
Sherlock’s mind was working constantly, he remembered being suspicious of her. No one else saw that it made no sense for someone to be so prepared if she was not the murderer, or even to know who it was really. She had appeared at the police line and asked to talk to someone.
Sherlock leaned back against the wall, there was nothing to do now but wait. He was surprised to find that John's beads were still wrapped around his hand. He ran the tips of his fingers over them, hoping that whoever received his instructions would bother to heed them, the letter was not sighed after all.
The smell of sex and sweat hangs in the damp air of John's bed chamber. He lies with his head pillowed on Sherlock's chest and Sherlock plants little kisses in his hair.
The body lies sprawled on the bare concrete floor, vacant eyes staring unseeing at the patchy ceiling.
“I sent for her when I was recovering from my injuries, but she never came. For two years I sent her letter after letter, begging her to come home to me, but she kept on insisting that she could not leave her post. Eventually she wrote me to say that she no longer wished to marry me, that the work was too important to her and she could never give it up; not even for a crown— not even for me.”
I terrifying yet invigorating thrill races through Sherlock's body and he feels his throat constrict.
He forces that horrible thought from his mind and strides purposefully out of his apartment, completely ignoring the guard he collides with. Determined to clear his head, John makes for the garden doors, perhaps some fresh air would do him good. He steadies his pace and takes slow, deliberate steps, drawing a calming breath with every stride.
So Sherlock waited eagerly for John to come and occupy his nights with anecdotes and closeness. On one particularly memorable night they had taken turns telling tales of their childhood adventures. Sherlock told of learning to climb the jagged cliff walls surrounding his family’s ancestral home and how the vista provided an impressive view of the canyons below. And John relayed tales of tearing through the lush country side on horseback, racing his sister over hills and through the forests, their horse’s hooves pounding as fast and furiously as their hearts. When one found himself drifting away on the sadness of either a childhood lost or a childhood never truly experienced, the other would mouth at their neck and shoulders until they were breathless, flushed, and laughing.
‘There’s a new body. I’m messaging you the address. Lestrade won’t want to keep you on the case after he sees this.’ She sounded anxious, something far from the centred woman that he knew.
‘But you promised to spend New Year’s eve with us! My parents are coming tomorrow.’ He could practically see Sherlock standing from his sit by the window in his demand. Anxiety was evident in his voice, he hated having his plans changed. He couldn’t avoid a small chuckle at the image of a distressed Sherlock. How could people not like him?
‘Nah, they’re just here because Captain Watson has been sitting indoors for the past couple of days. The term is just beginning and you got a new fans club!’ Everyone in the table laughed, Sherlock felt like a fish out of water.
Sherlock turned to John and looked for any sign of deception. He wanted to be sure that he was all in on this and wouldn’t let him down. He made up his mind. ‘Ok fine, just write that we’ll go after classes. I can’t miss a class.’
‘I’m leaving the U.K. and you should do the same thing. The spider in the middle of the web is about to release Moran on your trail. That’s considering that whatever happened to you wasn’t just a warning from him.’
Several things happened at once. A gun went of, Sherlock screamed as if in pain, and without hesitation I shot down the man with the gun even though we were cornered and outnumbered. “Don’t even think about moving a muscle.”
The rest of the class ran smoothly. Sherlock was unusually quiet and John was worried about that. He tried to joke a bit with him, but it only worked for an instant of two. He practically ran from the room the moment the class ended.
‘Hi Sherlock! Sorry I’m late, what are you doing?’ Upon being brought back to reality by Molly, he hastily closed his diary and shoved it into his bag. Mycroft must have let her in the moment he was leaving for the office, apparently his new position meant that they could call him in at any moment. That, and a PA that sometimes doubled as what he could only describe as a babysitter as she wouldn’t allow him to go out when John wasn’t there.
‘Thank you for clarifying that I’m a fun sight! Remove yourself from my working station, I’m busy.’ He took out again what he had thrown into his bag plus a bagged glove. His expression was now closed and reserved, John could practically see walls being built in seconds. He tried again by asking him about his experiments, it was like walking on eggshells and trying not to break them.
It didn’t take us much to get into the gang. Sherlock asked 5 of his network members for their help, they would be following the main subjects and gathering information on specific things Sherlock asked them. As for ourselves, we decided to gain their trust through a disguise and the usage of our skills. I was an underground doctor recommended by Sherlock’s people, and Sherlock gave the information regarding enemies and whatnot.
“Sherlock! What did you do?” Almost screamed John at Sherlock. At least he looked bashful enough about the developments.
‘Oi! I’m right here standing behind you! It’s not my fault that she decided to take a completely useless topic in social sciences when she wants to go into medical school, although you have to work up some character or they’ll eat you alive, I’d advise you to be a pathologist so you don’t have to manage and interact with the living.’
Sherlock just turned around and left without mustering a word. In his experience, this was far from good.
‘Sherlock, what are you working on?’ He eyed him warily sidewise, almost as if he was expecting scathing comments or vicious remarks. It surprised him to know so little from this boy that had taken a liking in him, and yet he knew almost everything he considered important with just a glimpse.
“Girls, calm down. Now what on Earth is going on here? You do know that Wiggins is here, right?” They both went silent. Sherlock regarded me with an exasperated look as if asking
‘Just say that you want an overpriced coffee and a chocolate treat.’ She crossed her arms waiting for an answer as he looked surprised as she outed him.
‘You have no idea how glad I am to hear you say that you love me. I was worried that you would find out and end our friendship.’
He turned back to see John as Molly sent him a message. “Don’t look like you are going to a funeral. Trust me on this Sherlock, you two could be brilliant. A dynamic duo. Just tell him how you feel. I texted Mycroft, just so you know.”
‘Tell.’ The whole table went quiet with the sound of his voice. ‘for starters, it’s you’re scaring, and it’s not told, the correct tense would be “tell”.’
This rendered Sherlock speechless. People normally saw things, but never observed. ‘You might just be earning the right to know my name.’
‘I was just about to get to that John. Please do keep up. As I was saying, you’ve been out for an entire month, before the whole incident, you met Miss Morstan and decided to date her after a couple of weeks.’
'So, this is beginning to get awkward. Are you ok? I just wanted to know if I had missed anything.' He shifted a bit on his chair in nervousness. Sherlock decided that it was now or never. Better now than later.
‘Jim Moriarty! I’m so glad you finally came out to play. We haven’t been properly introduced Sherlock Holmes.’ A shiver ran up his spine, he was about to find the man that lurked in the shadows moving everyone as a puppeteer. He took his stance and tried to look defiant while all he wanted to do was grab John by the sleeves and pull him until they were outside.
“I’m sorry, but I have something to say.” Said Wiggins. I was relieved that he talked for I had nothing to reassure Lestrade. I knew the plan was mad, and dangerous, but he didn’t need to hear it from me. “I know what I’ve gotten myself into,” he continued, “but it is my decision to make.”
Sorry for the delay and any confusions this chapter might bring. I changed how he met Molly deleting it from a past chapter.
‘We’re going out through the window.’ He stood packing his things in a hurry as Molly was left to catch up on what was going on.
That’s when John noticed the reflection. Without thinking he ran to push Sherlock out of the way and tripping in his haste. They barged though the window and fell from the second floor, John tried to move their bodies so that they were in the right position so that their bodies could absorb and redirect the impact. Once on the ground it took him a moment for his adrenalin to go down for him to realise that he was in pain.
Sorry it's mostly a conversation, and sorry if I'm getting rid of Mary this fast. Just give it a try, she'll still be here a bit.
‘Oh! Come on Mycroft, it’s not remotely close to that. In fact, I’ll have you know that in such case you haven’t noticed, I’m gay.’ Sherlock noted his voice rising and composed himself back to how they were at the beginning.
‘Donovan!’ The three of them turned at the same time as Lestrade entered the room, ‘what were you thinking bringing them in without asking me?’
‘Yes, well, how was I supposed to know it wasn’t the right time or the right way? She was there, the evidence was obvious and, if anything, by leaving she gave away her guilt. I thought it was better to save him future misery. Isn’t that what friends do?’
‘Oh please, cut the act, I know you’re only faking’ Sherlock opened his eyes and glared at his captor. She simply sat there with a smug smile and a makeup that made her look a couple of years older. ‘Well, hello! There you are. Such beautiful eyes shouldn’t be kept hidden, you knew I was following you. Why not cut the chase short?’ She was wielding a firearm as if it was nothing. The weight was familiar on her arm as if it was an extension of her and no longer a tool. Sherlock could see that she was agile and to some extent invisible. She smiled.
‘A case? How come?’ At this he looked sheepish, bashful even. This gave him away that is was a “bit not good” situation.
A heartbeat stretched into a year. He just wanted the call to be over. It was one thing to hate yourself, loath directed to nothing but yourself, and the other is having an outsider tell you how much you should loath yourself. Now, Sherlock’s greatest fears were forcefully thrusted in his direction and he was unable to move. After all, she was right. John had been shot because he was an extension of his being, Molly failed a subject because he was a terrible tutor, Mycroft was trapped with him because of blood, and his parents were unable to leave because he was their responsibility. Even Constable Lestrade from the Met had problems because of him and they weren’t even close. As of now, he could count himself responsible of a wound, a failure, pain, loss, and a heartbreak.
‘Sherlock.’ John stared sternly at him as if he could will him to move or say something. Sherlock turned to face John and noticed his expression. Curiosity morphed into annoyance and then into acceptance.
Sorry for the delay! Here's a new chapter, next update either Monday night or Tuesday morning. Cheers!
‘I’m sorry that your family doesn’t know how to appreciate you.’ Said Sherlock after a moment’s hesitation. He knew that his father was a heavy drinker and that his mother blamed her problems on him leaving for medical school. He never spoke about his sibling, he supposed brother because the signs that he had taken after their father were apparent. Women have always been less likely to fall into the addiction and fake warmth of alcohol. John avoided drinking if possible, but the way in which he regarded some of his friends when they were drinking spoke of a sibling’s worry.
John could see Sherlock’s barriers come up as soon as the words were spoken. His usually warm eyes now regarded him and Lestrade cold and calculating. He was no longer the energetic teenager they knew, but a person capable of seeing your darkest secrets and turning your past demons against you. For the first time since I met Sherlock, I was afraid of him. I could see that Lestrade wasn’t any better than me.
‘Did they hurt you when they took you?’ He was brought back from his musings with the question, she noticed the slight confusion. ‘Your kidnappers, did they hurt you?’
Sherlock didn’t take the comment lightly, and John could see that as clear as the day the moment he schooled his expression. He was suddenly sitting with his back straight, and had turned his whole body to the front of the room. Perhaps the conversation was over even before it had begun.
‘Just about to turn 16.’ Answered Sherlock eyeing John suspiciously. Why was he so interested on him?
‘All right, cool. No problem. Finish that while I put everything into my sports bag. Nothing is explosive, is it?’ Sherlock’s mock laugh was enough to reassure him. Sort of. He saw Sherlock in his peripheral vision. He dabbed a swab through the gloves fingers and then sprayed some of the liquid into whatever sample he had just taken. From the expression on his face, he knew that his theories had just been proven right with the reaction.
He is now lying supine with his arms restrained and Moriarty is straddled over his hips. He’s not an idiot. He vows to himself he will not make a sound, he will not beg, he will disappear into the depths of his mind until it’s over.
This is what he has to look forward to. To being raped on his wedding night likely to be followed by a honeymoon of nightly beatings. Very well, he could endure it. He would have to, he had no choice. He would endure this life of fear and degradation if it meant there was even the slightest chance that John's life would be spared.
,” she directs this comment at Lestrade but she clearly intended for Sherlock to hear. He rolls his eyes.
Sherlock had suffered through every violent shudder and each horrible blow alone, cut off entirely from the world around him. Aching deeply for some kind of human connection. Though he would never admit to it.
One of the men that has accompanied the former general gasps, “Un-fucking-believable! Is that—?” he cuts himself off, pointing dumbly at the still figure as if he can’t be certain of what he is seeing.
John could still feel the force of Sherlock’s large hands on his chest shoving him away— rejecting him— as he went about his day. He could feel the softness of Sherlock’s mouth against his own as he sat with is councilors, running his fingers absently over his lips. He didn’t notice the way Greg was staring. What had he done wrong?
When at last his bleary eyes focus he is startled to see a face he has had memorized for nine years grown handsome with maturity.
For two interminable nights he firmly did not allow his mind to wander. He kicked off his heavy blankets and allowed the northern autumn cold to sink into his bones until he was too distracted by his body’s violent shivering to be transported back to that warm, safe place he would never see again.
John had been devastated when he woke to find Sherlock had gone without a final goodbye. He had scrambled out of bed only to realize it was nearly noon and he was too late.
“We missed you at dinner, my dear,” he drawls. “Your brother was all set to announce our wedding, but you were absent.”
“Before this nation was divided, back when the conflict was still being referred to as a civil war, marriages did not require contracts. All that was necessary for two people to be bound together was a simple exchange of vows. Most folks in the country side still marry in this way.”
He closes his eyes and listens to the ticking of the time piece which filled the warm, wet air around him.
“I hoped I would get to see you today,” the king whispers, placing his hands on Sherlock’s hips. Sherlock, as though he had been doing this all his life, lets his long arms drape over John’s shoulders.
Everything becomes a blur then as they begin pulling and tearing at each other’s clothes. John yanks the hem of Sherlock's shirt from his waistband and runs his palms up Sherlock's middle. Sherlock arches into the touch, relishing the feeling of John's hands on his skin.
“This doesn’t mean that he’s—” she couldn’t seem to bring herself to say it. “For all we know he’s perfectly safe and unharmed.”
is the word often used. They don’t realize he only totes it around to use like a weapon, striking anyone he sees fit for any stupid reason.”
John is thoroughly dumbstruck by the prince’s words, even more so by the thinly veiled desperation in his eyes. “You do not want Mycroft to learn that you still live.”
Sherlock feels a familiar gaze on his back and tears his eyes from John's to see Mycroft looming at the altar, his face like thunder. John pulls Sherlock around to stand behind him, one hand on the small of Sherlock's back, the other on his sword.
Talking was perhaps not the most accurate way of phrasing it, it was more like flirting outrageously and unapologetically at every given opportunity.
Sherlock's voice catches when he stops to really examine the woman’s throat. Gouged so deep her spine is visible, and she lay in a dark lake of her own blood. Sherlock was not easily unnerved, but the victims on this case had been subjected to a kind of violence the average person simply wasn’t capable of. Something animalistic; bloodlust.
Despite what he tells himself the fear burning in his stomach only worsens as Mycroft’s speech ends and the justice steps up to the altar, inviting Sherlock and Moriarty to join him.
John thought that even if Sherlock had decided an affair with him was not what he wanted anymore, John wouldn’t mind. So long he as didn’t lose Sherlock’s company. This prince, who had come to him a total strange, had become John’s closest friend. The idea of losing his easy conversation and companionship made John ache deeper than the thought of never being able to kiss Sherlock again. He did not want to be alone again.
I was only eighteen when I enlisted, and when all was said and done I was to become king. I always knew Mary was ambitious, but I would have thought being queen would be enough. But who the hell wants to rule a drowning kingdom?”
Placing the frame gently on the desk he assembles the writing paraphernalia and takes a seat. It’s only after Sherlock has dipped the pen that he realizes he has no idea what he wants to say. What was there to say? He has done very little since John left, spending most of the day draped over furniture— not always pieces appropriate for draping oneself across— and wandering the grounds after dark. What could he say? What did he need to say?
And John knows life cannot continue as it has been for much longer. Rosie is growing so fast and soon there won’t be enough room in the upstairs bedroom for the both of them. He will have to leave Baker Street again, leave his home again.
“We’ve made a cake,” Mrs. Hudson says and John looks up at the work top to see it covered in flour and a crushed egg.
Sherlock opens his eyes and the rocky creek fades away. He realizes then that the roaring he’d heard in his sleepy memory had actually been the pounding of rain as the skies had opened.
Then he’d met Sherlock and suddenly the pretty girl and the pretty house no longer appealed the way they once had. He had quickly realized that normal could never satisfy him, could never complete him the way his life with Sherlock did.
“We must keep moving,” he says, eyes darting back and forth on alert for anyone who may have followed them. He opens his mouth to encourage Sherlock again to stand but words seem to die in his throat when he sees his face.
“I am sure it does,” Sherlock deposits the beads back into John’s waiting palm without turning to look at him, his fingers linger on the skin of John’s wrist.
The figure is tall and thin with a mess of dark hair. It looks like his Sherlock, but it can’t be. A hideous growl scratches out of this Sherlock's throat, coarse and beastly. His eyes flash dangerously, blood dripping from his lips.
“Oh, brother dear, come now. I’ll make you a deal. If you do as I say and marry without a fuss as I have asked, I will spare your paramour’s life.”
A squeal of pain wrenches itself from him and he tries to pull away from the touch; only to feel another horrible pang. He’d forgotten about the damage to his arm in the storm of other discomforts.
Sherlock arches and gasps at the first strokes and John sighs beautifully, Sherlock can feel the exhalation against his neck. They are slick with sweat and the sheets stick to Sherlock's back, tangling beneath him as he writhes and thrusts up into John's fist.
Sherlock hates his legs, the absurd length of them makes it impossible for him to angle himself toward John without their knees knocking together. His attempts to arrange himself have him fidgeting in a way that he knows makes him look gangly and awkward.
“Well, when you’re on the front lines you… see things— terrible things. The sort of things that come back to you in the night to haunt your dreams.”
“No,” he says, attempting to school his features into something unreadable, “nothing, I slept poorly.”
“My father arranged it before the war. When the conflict escalated, Mary was retained as a spy for the south, her noble family made for a good cover, and she was sent north to Mycroft’s court. She remained there, gathering information and relaying it back to us.”
He was concerned when he first observed this back when they’d first met. But John has since accepted that Sherlock's lack of desire to take proper care of himself will inevitably result in bouts of poor health. No that Sherlock would has even once admitted to being ill.
Weeks later, Sherlock would not remember exactly what happened next. He wouldn’t be sure if Moriarty left the room after he placed a soft kiss to his neck. Or if he had bolted from his own apartment.
John moves closer to the window as the sound of a piano begins to pour forth from it. His heart clenches almost painfully, he would recognize that melody anywhere, and it was being played so beautifully that John’s eyes pricked. He felt a sharp pang of unease as an image of his mother seated behind the grand comes back to him, clear as day. Before he can consider his actions, he is barreling through another pair of glass doors, skidding around corners, and bounding up the west staircase two or three steps at a time.
John and Sherlock finally come to an understanding, and then Sherlock gives us a glimpse of what happened to him before John found him.
“Tell me then,” Greg says, hands clasped behind his back, “does that sound right to you? We were trying to avoid war, not start one. I was a goddamn General at the time, David’s right hand, and I can tell you the south would never have done such a thing.”
But there was no sense in making any decision on the matter until he knew what had become of John. He felt so helpless trapped in this place while John was lost somewhere. He could do nothing for him, nothing at all.
“Rosie, love, why don’t you go and play in the sitting room for a bit? I’ll come and get you when the cake is ready.”
Greg then seems to realize that his king had not been wondering what to do, but rather how he would survive once it has been done. Once he has been parted from Sherlock Holmes.
He waits quietly in his chair for an hour or so to ensure John is asleep before putting on his coat and shoes and padding quietly down into the foyer.
He feels as though he is submerged in freezing water. He can hear the roaring of his blood in his ears. He is trembling.
“But you’re so accustomed to life at court, you’ll climb the walls anywhere else,” Moriarty says, advancing slowly.
There are three people in the image. The one in the center is obviously Mrs. Hudson. The figures on either side of her appear to be men younger than Sherlock. They obviously share her features. He feels a heaviness settle in his stomach. Mrs. Hudson had never made mention of any family, and she definitely seems the sort to go on and on about those she’s closest to.
Something wet presses against his lip, and the resulting sting pulls him from his thoughts. Irene’s face is passive but not cold as she holds a wet cloth to Sherlock's face. He takes it from her and she looks down at his chest, silently asking permission to touch him; he nods.
He feels Sherlock’s fingers tighten fractionally around his as the bed itself, with its massive carved headboard, comes into view. John stops at the corner of the mattress and pulls Sherlock around to face him. Their lips meet as if drawn together and Sherlock’s free hand, the one that hasn’t grabbed hold of John’s collar, grips the thick wooden bed post.
The journey back from the boarder was hell on John, he was in so much pain, we feared we’d lose him before we had even returned home. That night after he had rested for some hours, I finally told him of what had happened.”
JIm tips Sherlock's head back, and he feels a spot of cool touch his lip before something trickles into his mouth.
Screams erupt from the wedding guests as they frantically search for a way out of the room, but there is nowhere to go. The spaces on either side of the pews are rapidly filling with southern soldiers.
“Sherlock,” he whispers. No response. “You’re alright, breathe. You’re alright.” He keeps his voice soft and slow.
“No, no!” John cries, “Sherlock, open your eyes. We’re going home, and everything will be just as it was. We’ll be together again, we’ll be so happy, I promise.”
“I won’t ask anymore of you tonight,” John whispers, breaking the peaceful silence, “not unless you want me to.”
He places a hand on Sherlock's chest to feel it rise and fall beneath his palm and he stifles a sob in his elbow.
No matter how hard he tried, Sherlock seemed determined to keep even John at a distance. And even though it hurt, he had accepted that fact long ago.
Sherlock doesn’t wait, not another moment. He tears himself away from John’s distressed gaze and disappears down the tunnel.
Sherlock is having difficulty drawing his breath, his chest feels tight and his head swims, he feels feverish. He trips on a step and falls against John who catches him around the waist and carefully lowers him to the stairs.
Sherlock forces John over and straddles him, claiming his mouth in a kiss so fierce it hurts. He kisses him, and kisses him, and kisses him.
The world fades away and leaves only the sound of his own blood pounding in Sherlock's ears. He draws in a long, slow breath and lifts his head, his shoulders straightening the way he’d seen John do so many times.
The cat is watching them, pale eyes fixed intently on John. It’s almost as if its looking right through him. Even though he has been seeing this cat for years every time John is caught under its gaze he feels his hackle rise a little. All cats are a bit creepy, but this one could be particularly unsettling.
A darkness crept into Greg’s lined face and his eyes grew distant. “David and I served together before his own father died. We hatched such schemes together, he and I; said that when David sat on the throne we’d find a way to bring peace to this world. As if two boys could do something like that all on their own.”
“I haven’t come up here since they died. We used to gather around this old thing after dinner and spend the whole evening playing and singing to each other.” John allows himself to feel the sharp edge of nostalgia before he thinks to question why the hell he just said that.
Sherlock gave John a puzzled look and asked, “You want me to listen in on your talks with foreign diplomats? Me?”
Surreptitiously he glances out at the sea of faces to see that not one of them is smiling and he barely suppresses a laugh.
Also, i feel i should mention that I'm imagining the Sherlock of series one (slightly younger) and the John of series four (the hair!), just so you understand where I'm coming from.
They stay like that for a long time, not speaking; just breathing together, being together. John’s heart hurts, he knows all too well the fear that grips this dear man. He has seen glimpses of it in him from the day they’d met. The knowledge of it has restrained John, prevented him from pursuing Sherlock the way he so badly wants to— for fear he may cross some line and shatter the fragile trust between them.
But those few days turned to weeks and soon the blaze of summer began to give way to autumn. Nothing seemed to have changed between himself and John, if the king were indeed preparing to marry, he certainly wasn’t letting it effect his time with Sherlock.
Beyond the main hall there is a gallery lined with family portraits dating back hundreds of years. At the far end of the long room there is a pair of enormous doors, before which stands Mycroft, flanked by Jim Moriarty and four knights in full regalia.
“He will be soon if we don’t get him back to the manor,” says John, deftly running his hands over what little of Sherlock he can reach, checking for any obvious injuries. The prince’s eyes are half open but unfocused, John is sure he doesn’t have any idea where he is or what is happening to him.
Dread chills Sherlock to his core and he imagines he can feel the painted eyes of his ancestors boring into him as he makes his way down the gallery. One wall of the portrait hall is lined with high, narrow windows that flow into the chapel beyond the doors. As he walks, he steps in and out of rays of light that stream across the cracked stone floor. The sun never truly rises in the north at this time of year, and the light that hangs in the air in gauzy and grey, it almost seems to cling to Sherlock's skin, making him feel as though he is underwater.
A two women wait for him on the low front steps, skirts sweeping elegantly in the wind. Anthea, right hand to the king, he recognizes; the other dark haired woman in the fitted white gown is a stranger to him. Anthea steps forward.
“Yes, Greg, I did read it.” he drops his head into his hands and releases a long, slow breath. “Who is to say he will not invade regardless. The bastard has been looking for an excuse to do so for years.”
John exhales deeply and straightens himself to sit back against his plush chair. A chill slithers through his veins as the memory of icy eyes flashes before him.
This became ritual for them, evenings spent in one another’s company. When John retired for the night he would send for Sherlock or come to him in his own apartment, where they would settle in and Sherlock would listen avidly as John recounted the day’s events. There wasn’t much he could say, and what he did tell Sherlock was redacted considerably, as John surely was not able to share matters of state with anyone; much less a northerner.
He travels back to where John stands at the piano as he tunes the violin and comes to stand a few feet away from him. In the following hours John will try to reason with himself that he could have prepared himself for what was coming, though will know it in his heart to be false. For when Sherlock pulls the bow over the strings John is instantly and completely entranced.
It took every ounce of Sherlock’s considerable self-control to clamp down on the sheer panic that erupted in him.
Sometime later, lying entangled in the stillness of the dark room, John listens carefully to Sherlock's breathing. He knows the prince isn’t sleeping, but he doesn’t want to disrupt this moment.
He wanted John, he wanted to see him, to know he was alright. It was completely irrational, John had gone to meet an Earl, he was perfectly fine wherever he was. But Sherlock wanted to look into the king’s eyes and see that warmth that made him feel safe.
Sherlock pulls a freshly rosined bow across the strings and chuckles at the screech it elicits, “Horribly out of tune, though.”
Remember last time when I said I wanted to get these chapters out to you more than once i month, well, check the publication dates-- we are just shy of one month. I am so sorry!
Unfurling the thick parchment John is assaulted by the header which informs him he is holding Mary Morstan’s death warrant. All that is required is his signature.
They crash together, a blur of questing mouths and fumbling fingers before they fall back together against the mountain of pillows and loose themselves completely.
Sherlock gives a kind of sardonic laugh, “Why stop now, we’ve finally arrived at what you truly want to know. Just how far into the recent past does this
“Fuck,” he gasps in utter disbelief. He blinks hard and even shakes his head, but the sight remains. There was no mistaking those features. The thick, inky curls, the blade-sharp features, those eyes…
His body aches and it seems the last of his will has gone with his breath. The greenery around him blurs and begins to fade; and so does he.
“Oh, god!” John breaths and scrambles out of the dirt, gun forgotten. He crashes clumsily through the leaves, carelessly neglecting to check his surroundings before throwing himself onto the open path.
The dark wine washes bitter and bright over his tongue as he takes a deep pull. He fights to hold back a grimace; northern wine is appalling. Sherlock hands the chalice back to the justice who then presents it to Moriarty.
“What gave it away? Did I forget to smooth down my hair, is there a lipstick stain on my collar, what was it?”
“Have you received and news from Sarah regarding the annulment?” Sherlock asks, wanting to fill the heavy silence.
“Wait,” John calls. He places a quick kiss on Sherlock's lips and says, “You’d best go. Come to my apartment tonight, I’ll explain everything.”
“I meant to tell you this yesterday when we got the news, but everything was so chaotic that I simply lost track of time.”
Warm blood trickles down his arm from where his hand is pressed against the tear along the side of his neck. The room begins to spin around him but he cannot take his eyes from the form before him.
John has stepped into the water, his feet breaking the stillness and he holds out a hand to Sherlock who takes hold and steps in himself. The water is blissfully cold, providing relief to their overheated skin.
Sherlock sneers and the man, late thirties, blond, average build, former smoker, with a chestnut Labrador mix, seems to take this as a yes.
He had forgotten how low the sky hangs in the north. The plumes of an approaching storm thunder angrily overhead as the carriage trundles along the uneven road. His back aches where its pressed into the hard back of the bench. He is certain he would have been sick by now if he’d bothered to eat a single bite in the last three days.
“I cannot know what the future holds for us, but I can promise that so long as you remain with me no harm shall come to you, my sweetheart.” The words pour forth from his lips unbidden. “And I promise I will do my best not to treat you with kid-gloves now you’ve trusted me with this.”
John’s kisses are gentle, his mouth careful and his hands firm, caressing Sherlock without trapping him. Sherlock, freed from restraint by the security of John’s embrace, pressed in further. The angle of his hand on John’s face makes his wrist throb, so he slides his arm around John’s neck, long fingers splayed across the king’s left shoulder. The skin beneath the fine silk shirt feels wrong somehow, raised lines fan out like rays from a central point which dips beneath Sherlock’s finger tips. A scar?
John presses again and again against the place inside Sherlock that makes him gasp and writhe. He could feel how close he was and he begged for more.
He says nothing and slips into the flat through the kitchen door hoping his flatmate is too absorbed by his thoughts to notice him.
Sherlock’s throat tightens. Even when the weight of sadness has his shoulders curving, John’s fist thought is to reassure someone else. Sherlock hates himself a little for it. This wasn’t about him; why did he always have to take up all the air in the room? Why did he always have to be so selfish?
I want you to know that I am 100% committed to completing this fic, i have a full outline and am working on it whenever I can. I hope that you will stick with it until the end, i promise it'll be worth the wait.
The door slowly opens and Irene Adler tentatively peers around it. something like pity crosses her face when she sees him, but she quickly rearranges her features to something kinder as she enters. Irene places a thin hand against Sherlock's cheek and her eyes speak volumes.
The room is large with a high ceiling and a plush bed on a platform against the far wall, tapestries and paintings of all sizes obscure the pale stone walls. Someone has lit a fire in the hearth and the atmosphere within this familiar space is almost welcoming.
“Good morning, brother mine,” Mycroft drawls. His face is completely blank, no need for sarcasm or threats anymore, not when he is about to get exactly what he wants.
Upon inspection, box reveals itself to be Mrs. Hudson’s letter set. Sherlock traces the letter’s engraved in the lid,
He feels himself calming slightly, anchored and soothed by John's presence, their separation at last concluded.
When he cannot undo the buckle Sherlock abandons his attempts to undress John and grabs his face, forcing his head back and crushing their mouths together. John is at first surprised when Sherlock's tongue pushes roughly between his lips, but soon relaxes and permits Sherlock to do as he will with him.
Sherlock feels a surge of daring overtake him and he clasps John's hand and places it on his growing erection.
“I understand,” she says, clearly forcing a smile, “I suppose there’s a certain someone in your life who keeps you rather busy at the moment, anyway.”
John makes the choice to explain himself to Sherlock in person, give the man a day or so to prepare to leave. It's the least he can do. Though John had not seen or spoken to Sherlock since that first day, his housekeeper had told him that the prince had been nothing but cordial and amenable.
Early mornings spent in the boats in search of water fowl, and afternoons spent in the fields watching dogs tears across the grass to flush out their targets. Even with a rifle under his arm and surrounded by laughing men, Sherlock was all John could think of.
“Absolutely,” John has dropped off of his horse and swung his rifle over his arm before the word has fully left his mouth.
“John,” Sherlock breathes as he is pressed back against the wall. John laves open mouthed kisses along the column of his throat, firm hands skimming over Sherlock’s body.
Rosie is perched on Mrs. Hudson’s hip, begrudgingly allowing her to clean her little hand with a wet flannel.
Her overly formal tone did nothing to calm him. It was as though she were forcing herself to remain composed
Hours could have passed and John would never have noticed, so focused was his attention. Abruptly the music ends with a shriek across the strings and a pained sound curls out of Sherlock’s throat. John is at his side in an instant, taking the violin from his suddenly shaking hands and depositing it on the piano before turning his attention to Sherlock.
It wasn’t until they reached the boarder two days later that the reality of what was happening finally dawned on him.
Mycroft was not a stupid man by any means. Stubborn and cruel, but not stupid. He could see Sherlock's distaste for his betrothed from the moment it had taken root, and he delighted in it. he had no reason to care what became of his brother, so long as Lord Moriarty came through on his end of the bargain.
Sherlock doesn’t respond, he only sits there in that high-backed chair, staring straight through John.
Greg, and at least two other men by the sound of it, clumsily haul themselves up the rise calling, “Majesty, what’s happened?”
“Well, then,” John breathed, making every hair on Sherlock’s body stand to attention, “you should return to your bed.”
Sherlock clears his throat and shifts uncomfortably. “It isn’t as though I’ve never given his cause for the corrections. As I told you before, I have always been horribly self-involved and destructive in my habits.”
Irene’s voice is soft as she wraps the cold, wet linen around Sherlock's middle to ease the swelling. Sherlock now understands that the gentleness of her touch is that of a mother.
“That isn’t quite what I meant,” John says, shuffling closer, “yes, there is a pattern, but it’s all just empty words unless you pray them honestly.”
As they reach the second floor the scent of fresh blood reaches Sherlock and a low growl rumbles in his chest.
This past month has been ridiculous. I've had weird hours at work and i've been so tired from work and holiday prep, not to mention doctors appointments and other annoying life maintenance, that this chapter is a bit later than expected.
There was nothing he could do for his people in this moment, and he could carry on hating himself for it in the morning, but Sherlock was one problem he could solve. John forces himself off the wall and makes for Sherlock’s apartment. If he’d been wrong, if Sherlock did not want him the way he’d thought, then at least he would know one way or the other.
Sherlock recalls the conversation he’d had with Greg Lestrade shortly after his arrival, and the timeline of John's life as he knows it begins to unravel like a spool.
John slips an arm around his waist and pulls Sherlock onto his lap. He wraps his arms around John's shoulders and holds on as their bodies rock in unison. Panting into each other’s mouths, their moans and gentle words fill the sweetly-scented air around them.
The sky hung low, clouds heavy with impending rain, and thunder rolled ominously overhead. Listlessly he craned his neck to get a look at the clock on the mantle, it was after midnight. Ordinarily he would have quit his apartment the moment the manor was still, but tonight he couldn’t be bothered. He wasn’t even particularly bothered by the idea that his lethargy meant it would be another full day before he’d be able to move freely about the grounds again.
However, this month is going to be incredibly busy for me as i have to finish out this term, get all my things packed, and return home all within the next three weeks. So if there aren't many updates in that time, I hope you'll forgive me. The good news is that most of the chapters will probably be up during the late spring and early summer when the story itself takes place, provided you live in the northern hemisphere.
John gets low as he ascends the ridge, tucking himself beneath the foliage. Then he hears it, a quiet rustling followed by a thud. Deer or not, John is interested. He crawls like a spider over the crest of the rise and finds himself at a thick line of shrubs that completely obstructs his view of the path beyond. He carefully pulls the rifle over his head and lays it down before doing the same with his body, flattening himself on the damp earth to peer under the growth.
“Daddy!” she cries when she catches sight of John and demands to be put down. John's face breaks into a huge grin as she races to him and kneels down, opening his arms to her. He scoops the little girl up into his arms and kisses her hair.
Sherlock restrained himself for a full five minutes, watching the little clock on the mantel as the endless seconds ticked by. Later he would not remember standing or reaching the door in three strides. He ignored the servant’s tunnels and hurried through the wing in the direction of the audience chamber, the soles of his leather slippers
John makes and effort not to let on how ruffled he is, though he is sure it is pointless. This is not the first time he’s come face to face with the Holmesian deductive capabilities. But there is something distinctly different about this display. It has been a number of years since John's last one on one encounter with Mycroft Holmes, but he can still recall the arrogance on his foxy features. The way he took people apart was a show of dominance, no question. Coming from Sherlock, however, it feels more defensive than aggressive in this moment; despite his stony demeanor.
“He made no secret of it, John. He is a monster, and he takes what he wants. Upon her death, arrangements were made for our wedding. At first I was willing to go along with the whole thing. I have no real objections to the institution, and I hadn’t yet found any major fault with my fiancé. Jim is a highly intelligent man, and not altogether unappealing. Despite his brutal reputation, he had never harmed me the few times I’d interacted with him, and I hoped that once we were married I could go to live on his father’s estate, away from Mycroft.
“But you see, I wasn’t thinking of myself, or even what would become of my realm without me. I was thinking of you.”
“Your features are eastern but your accent is northern. You’re from a well off family, perhaps the daughter of a lord. How did you end up in the employ of Jim Moriarty?”
I am so very sorry for the delay in this chapter. I have been very busy and more than a little stressed. Like i've said before, i am 100% committed to completing this fic.
The gallery was still now that the chapel doors were shut and a guard of southern troops stood watch, the small number of northern soldiers, as well as the few servants, that had accompanied the late king to his family’s ancient home had been quickly rounded up and subdued by Greg’s forces and shut up in the chapel with the wedding guests.
John clears his throat. “Right then. I have observed that you are reluctant to be touched by most and, on occasion, you flinch away if someone near you moves without warning or you are come upon too quickly.”
Slowly he leans down and presses his forehead to Sherlock's chest, taking fistfuls of his coat and simply holding on.
So when James Moriarty enters the great hall with his lovely sister Janine on his arm, Sherlock is out of his seat at the head table, making sure that the feet of his chair scrape as loud as possible as he stands, and striding out of the hall before anyone can stop him.
Mrs. Hudson had met him on the front steps, though she had been visibly saddened that they had to part ways, she had done her level best not to weep. The guards that had been gathered to take him to the boarder had been understandably shocked to learn that he, the prince of the north, had been living under their noses for so long. He listened to them speculate amongst themselves like schoolboys during the first leg of their journey, speculating as to why he’d been in the south and why their king has hidden him.
There is a long silence wherein Sherlock relishes the solidity of John’s presence as he attempts to calm his racing heart.
“Oh, I…” Sherlock feels his face flush. He had forgotten about the beads. He hadn’t wanted to put them away but they were becoming a nuisance wrapped around his hand, so he’d decided to wear them.
The long room is empty, mourners will not be permitted in until morning, but John insisted they come down now so as to have this over with before Sherlock must lead the funeral service for his brother.
Another silence falls between them. John observes that Sherlock’s tension has eased a little. Down in the courtyard, people have begun filing out of the ballroom in pairs, arm in arm and laughing as though they’ve not a care in the world. A few of the musicians follow and establish themselves on the patio and begin to play.
John smiles and leans his cheek into Sherlock's palm. He opens his mouth to speak when there is a knock at the door.
When the love of his life had miraculously come back to him, John had not come clean. And that was still a mystery to him. He couldn’t bring himself to regret his silence the way he had before the fall because he couldn’t imagine life without his beautiful daughter. But even still. Mary has been gone for over a year and John can feel the pain of that loss easing more and more every day. He knows what he wants, but he knows he cannot have it.
“Enter,” he snaps. His mind has been racing so fast since being sentenced to exile in all but name, that he doesn’t notice someone has approached him until they speak.
John has a think about his relationship with Sherlock and encounters Mrs. Hudson's bizarre cat on the steps of 221.
She was unfazed by his scathing tone. “I find that when I can’t decide what to write in a letter I start with how I’m feeling and go from there.”
“John, is that you?” Mrs. Hudson calls from behind her door, he can hear her clattering about in the kitchen.
“Do you think they will believe that? They believe what I tell them. They believed me when I told them the south assassinated our parents, they will believe me now. Though truthfully, I do not need my people’s approval. Once I have the eastern troops behind me I will destroy the southern kingdom, burn it to the ground and salt the earth. And when the smoke clears, you will watch John Watson die slowly; as expiation for your betrayal.”
I tried to finish this for you last week, but Word was giving my sass and deleted half my work and, being as busy as i am at the moment, i didn't have time to rewrite until the other day. Thank you for your continued interest nonetheless.
Sherlock's back snaps up off the dock and he cries out. Sparks dance along his nerves and something hot and delicious erupts from within him.
Without the distraction of conversation, the pain in his gums flares up and demands to be heard. Sherlock rubs at his cheek and flexes his jaw, lips curling back over his teeth. The throbbing pull at the back of his tongue and burning dryness in his throat has been steadily worsening for nearly a week now. He hasn’t let it get this far in a while, not since Rosie was born— he couldn’t risk it. It was not unusual for a case to take priority over sustenance, but this had gone on long enough.
They exchange farewells. John expresses his wish for her to stay at the manor for the night before undertaking the journey back to her family’s home, and then Mary Morstan is gone.
Sherlock reaches over and ignites the lamp beside the bed and the room fills with flickering light. It only takes Sherlock seconds to read his brother’s demands. John watches, aching, as the color drains from his husband’s face.
He had enough forethought to pause outside the large doors of the chamber. He pressed his ear to the wood and listened for any sound beyond. When he heard nothing, Sherlock shouldered his way into the room.
Hardly about to turn down an opportunity to spend time alone with John outside the manor walls, Sherlock grabs the king’s hand and climbs up behind him.
Its chaste, really, as kisses go— but the thrill that moves through John at the tiny sounds escaping Sherlock’s milky throat is unlike anything he has felt before. Their breathing is shallow when they break apart, neither taking their hands from the other. Sherlock’s long lashes flutter against his flushed cheeks as he tries not to meet John’s gaze. He bumps his nose against John’s in what could only be described as a nuzzle— so light and gentle.
John wants to take Sherlock’s hand, to hold him close, but he can see in his ridged posture that it would not be welcome. Sherlock sits with his arms crossed tightly over his chest, body angled away from John, eyes fixed unseeingly on the rug.
Mike spoke next, “She was arrested at her old family home this afternoon. According to the warden, she’s been quite accommodating, offering up any bit of information she’s asked for.
The air in the room seems to grow very still as Greg takes a moment to read over the letters contents. John has already memorized it.
Everything becomes very still after John puts Rosie to bed. The volume on the TV is lowered and John is careful to avoid banging into anything as he moves around the flat. Even Sherlock who usually can’t be bothered to respect other people’s rest seems to slow down and make an effort to be quieter.
” Sherlock huffs through gritted teeth, indignation flaring in his gut. “I see,” he drawls, “you think I’m the king’s new whore.”
He gingerly nudges the door, allowing it to swing open on its hinges, which are blessedly silent. Sherlock is a bit taken aback by the room on the other side. Pale morning light streams in through long, narrow windows, and the ceiling stretches up and up into shadow through which he cannot see the beams. Before him sit long rows of wooden benches leading to what looks to be some sort of altar space adorned with statues and draped in richly colored fabrics. Figures line the high walls, looming over Sherlock from their pedestals in such a way that makes him feel small.
John witnesses in Sherlock an obvious sign of past mistreatment. When he works up the nerve to ask the prince about his life, he is told of a not-so-distant-past much darker than he expected.
“Your advisors wish me gone,” Sherlock says, and John is brought up short. Not only by the statement, unnerving though the observation is, but by the voice that delivers it— no longer rasping and broken, but deep and sensual.
John's body heaves with a sob. “Yes, love, we’re going home right away.  But you must stay awake, do you hear me? Don’t leave me.”
John takes both the prince’s hands and stands on his toes to press the lightest kiss to his lips, thumbs running over prominent knuckles.
I had a bit of drama uploading this chapter, but its all sorted now. I ran back from class to get this up before i tuck in for the night to do some homework.
It had not been Greg that had returned to his aid in that damp stairwell, but a woman with dark hair. She had introduced herself as Irene Adler and laid a gentle hand on Sherlock's cold cheek where he lay on the crumbling steps. A regret so deep had filled her eyes that John had been taken aback to learn she was in the employ of Lord Moriarty.
Sarah interrupted Greg, “But instead of sending her payment by messenger he sent a letter detailing their dealings by post, knowing we’d intercept it and she’d be caught.”
A small bit of context: Sherlock in this universe is a little younger at age 32, while John is 40. Sherlock got engaged at age 12 just before his parents deaths and the assassination of John's parents. John enlisted at 18, and took the southern throne two years later when the conflict worsened. the war lasted for 15 years.
‘Sherlock! This way!’ The moment he heard John’s voice, it was as if someone had thrown him a lifeline. He instinctually took hold of it and didn’t let go. It was easy to pinpoint from where it was coming, and easier when John raised his hand for him to follow. And while Sherlock Holmes never followed, he’d trust John any day.
I had to bring down the door in order to get to Sherlock, the racket it made was what got the gang tripping on their way down the stairs with withdrawn weapons. The image of Sherlock beaten and passed out on the ground was what kept me on the move. Hauling his arm by the back of my neck in order to support his deadweight and still have the chance to move around. I moved to one of the rooms by the stairs in order to have time to get on the move once they passed me.
Sherlock takes a breath and crouches low over the body. Carefully he removes his glove and brushes her hair aside, placing his hand over the woman’s forehead.
A small sound reaches him through the fog of his thoughts. From somewhere beyond the chapel doors there comes the sound of voices.
He feels a flicker of anxiety as he hears the stopper pulled from the vial with a small pop. John shifts to kneel between Sherlock's legs, which fall open willingly for him, despite his nerves Sherlock trusts this man.
The feeling of another person against him is strange to Sherlock. The sound of the mingled breath, the hand kneading his waist, the heat of John’s body. A kind of abandon Sherlock has never known is driving him to delve deeper into John’s mouth and hold tighter to him with fistfuls of his shirt; wanting more, more, more…
Something dark passes over John's face, tightening his features. Sherlock wants to reach for him, but he can tell the gesture would not be welcome.
She takes his left hand in hers and examines it, first checking to see if he could still move his fingers correctly. He had all but forgotten the shard of glass buried in his flesh.
He would have expected Moriarty’s face to be triumphant and smug, but where he anticipated arrogance there was only stillness; this was business to him.
“It was a chore for a long time, something to be got through so I could hear a kind word,” Sherlock’s tone lightens a bit, “but I soon found real joy in composing.”
Instantly he is on his guard. The footfalls grow louder until they come to a halt on the other side of the door. There is a brief murmuring of voices before the door opens without warning and Mycroft steps through. He curses himself for not realizing, if Anthea is here, of course Mycroft would be as well.
Despite John's request, Sherlock found that words eluded him. He sat to write a reply but he just didn’t know what to say. He had never spoken to his own people before so he could not council John on that matter. Nor had he any idea how to respond to John saying that Sherlock kept him going. John had expressed similar sentiments before, but Sherlock got the impression that this meant more. This was a confession of sorts. John was trying to communicate how he needed Sherlock, and Sherlock was struck dumb.
The air bites at his face as he climbs the steps from the station onto the street. He is tired and his body feels heavy as he trudges along Baker Street.
“I rather like you like this. Addled, sweet, and pliant. I think I’ll keep you like this always once your mine.”
For a moment, Sherlock experiences a feeling of unreality, as though he is floating weightless outside himself. When he regains his awareness he tries to speak, to answer John, but his throat has grown thick and words will not come.
John sits beside him as runs his fingers lightly over Sherlock's cheek and down his neck, slipping them beneath his collar. He hooks his finger around a strand of beads he finds there and pulls free a familiar chair of silver prayer beads; he may be sick.
Everything freezes then, the world slowing and shrinking down to that secluded place in the dark of the tunnels where there is nothing but the two of them. John has pulled his mouth away from Sherlock’s neck and now they stand pressed together, lips only an inch apart. Sherlock is shaking.
Bit of a short one, but i wanted to get something up on Valentines Day... because lurv and schtuff...
Even after so long, Sherlock remains such a mystery to John. One moment he’s snappish and maybe even a little aggressive, and the next they could sit companionably together over dinner, with John's daughter sleeping upstairs.
Sherlock is staring unblinkingly at the floor, his body jerks as his breath, fighting to free itself from his lungs, stutters in and out before finally breaking into long, pained gasps. John shifts and places his forehead against Sherlock’s temple, taking his hands.
Well, at least he was eating tonight. It didn’t happen often, but when the detective’s appetite did kick he became absolutely ravenous. Sherlock was half way through his meal before John had made a dent in his own.
John in on his feet and in Greg’s face before he realizes he has stood. “Do you think I want to? Do you think that after fighting tooth and nail all these years to keep us from war, I would give in now? That after everything I have sacrificed for this country, I would throw it all away?”
Moriarty makes a sound like a wounded cat and glances briefly over his shoulder. the hulking form of Moran sidles over, his face is unsettlingly blank. Without a word Moran kneels by Sherlock's head, taking hold of his wrists and securing them against the floor under his knee.
Lawful or no, he knew what was between himself and the man writhing beneath him was as true and right and predetermined as night turning into day. This was inevitable, Sherlock thought, that they should end up here.
The manor house had once belonged to his mother’s family, of which there were few surviving members. It was usually used as a holiday residence for those Mycroft did not particularly care for. It was a grand house, to be sure, but it was old and badly neglected. The house was drafty on good night, but when the weather turned harsh in winter, Sherlock was sure on more than one occasion that he would freeze to death. Perhaps that would not be such a bad thing.
Now it is Sherlock’s turn to huff, “I can’t explain. No, honestly, it’s just something I do— you know that. There were a dozen small tells, but for what it’s worth, I don’t believe there was ill intent behind it. Am I correct in assuming the Major hails from the east counties?”
The look Sherlock gave him meant the world to John in that moment. He could see the pain written across Sherlock’s face and was surprised by how unguarded his expression was. It was as if he was seeing him for the very first time. He couldn’t properly understand his afflictions but in that moment, he knew his friend needed him even though he was not voicing it, or making any notion to show it.
‘Sher?’ He turned to Mycroft, his resolution crumbled and tears threatened to run freely. Mycroft noticed this before Sherlock could collect his thoughts and put back his cold and indifferent mask. Things were bad indeed.
Sherlock decided to just nod and left. They were in the same lesson, so they surely had to see each-other at least twice a week. He was definitely looking forward to the laboratory session.
‘Well, games don’t end late. He goes with us and leaves when the pub turns into too much of everything. Still, the team enjoy his company and his wit. He’s smarter than all of them and he’s about 4 years younger!’ They all laughed good before proposing a toast and welcoming the new year with light and happy company.
“Apart from the obvious that even your team would've been able to see, the first stab is always the one on the back. Whoever is doing this is most definitely part of the gang. You want to solve the case? We have to go in and leave all your rules behind.”
It didn’t take Sherlock longer than he expected to see again the rugby captain. He knew they would undoubtedly meet at the lab on Friday, but hadn't considered the older student to have several more pending subjects. He met him again on Tuesday at his second period.
Trigger warning! I'm raising the rate to 'mature' because of the descriptions in this chapter. Although I should probably done so when John got shot...
‘My brother loves to see me suffer. I had the worst weekend in my entire life because of him.’ He was clearly sulking, and aware that anyone with half a brain would be able to notice. He couldn’t care less.
‘Come on Sherlock, that’s not fair, you’re my friend. It’s not as if I don’t enjoy our small adventures and the stakeouts with Lestrade. It’s the most fun I’ve had in a while. I was completely engrossed in my studies forgetting to live a bit.’
After the short interaction that she had witnessed between John and Sherlock, she was certain that he was way out of his comfort zone. He hadn’t chosen her while he had the chance to choose John. Realisation hit her, that his exasperation came from the fact that she was a trespasser in his mind; while he wasn’t conscious of this decision, she acknowledged that their introduction was forced and strained making their acquaintance a dull point of existence. She was an outsider and an intruder to his mind.
They are just dancing around each other. Irene makes a fast appearance to warn them. Is that jealousy?
The moment he raised his head and John saw his eye, his whole demeanour changed. He was suddenly the young adult he was supposed to be, rather than the carefree person Sherlock knew.
He smiled at the text, trust Molly to know what he needs to hear, or read in this case. Taking a deep breath to release some of the tension, he closed his laptop and placed it in his bag. It was his chance, if he was just about to do this he would do it right; no hesitation or insecurities. He grabbed his cup almost defensively and took a moment to gather his wit. It was as if he was preparing to battle. When he raised his head to see John he saw what Molly saw, it was obvious that he was John’s favourite person.
‘You have to stop prodding the matter. He’s not coming after you but you’re turning into a beautiful block in his way and he will not hesitate to eliminate you. Age and all be damned, he’ll just murder you in a way that looks either an accident or a suicide. Stay away from everything that’s going on.’
John is more than a little disappointed. They’d had such a lovely evening talking at the table but he’d hardly seen his flatmate since. It was embarrassing how much time john spent just trying to be near Sherlock. It was beginning to feel like the early days when he’d wanted to be near him all the time just to bask in that brilliant light that seemed to shine from some place deep inside Sherlock. That heartbreaking thing about it all is that Sherlock was utterly unaware of it.
As always thank you for your continued interest in this tale and your continued patience with me as i write it. I look forward to your comments!
His wrist aches horribly. He’d been wringing his hands most of the day— a ridiculous habit— which he suspects had aggravated the injury that had not yet fully healed; despite John's attentions. He scratches at the bandages that bind the offending joint as he unwillingly recalls the feeling of Moriarty snapping it. He shivers.
The door opens to reveal a tall man with dark blonde hair and a chiseled face, Sebastian Moran. Sherlock's hackles rise as Moran crosses the threshold wordlessly and steps aside to allow someone else to enter behind him.
I'm a big fan of a more 'feminine' Sherlock, as far as I'm inclined to buy into gender norms-- which is not very. Regardless, I can't help but picture him as slight and sort of pretty. A bit like a dancer. Also, the version of him I want to write for this fic is slightly broken, and I'm trying to find a way to balance that with his pre-established bravado and the way he is known canonically to wear his intelligence like armor. Obviously, he and John will be falling for each other in this story, but I don't really have the patience, or desire, to have them dancing around it, you know? As far as I'm concerned, I just want our boys to be as happy as possible together as soon as possible, without rushing things. They both have their obstacles to overcome, but they're smart men, they should be able to see beyond that.
John pushes in to the second knuckle and all the way a moment later. He begins to gently work the digit in and out, opening Sherlock with deliberate slowness.
John's heart sinks. “It’s alright, honestly, it’s all fine. I just don’t know what you’re comfortable with.”
Sherlock honestly didn’t know if he could bring himself to go home, back to that dismal palace where nothing but pain and endless isolation awaited him. He wondered briefly if it wouldn’t just be easier to die.
“John,” he says with the adorable determination of the slightly drunk, “if you believe marrying that woman is what’s best, then you should accept.”
“Flatterer,” Sherlock chides, but there is no bite in it. Truthfully he loves the way John always has a kind word for him. It’s a novel concept, these pet names.
Sherlock forces himself to nod in understanding, though he feels himself growing heavy with sadness.
As he lay in bed regaining his strength, John beside him, Sarah and Mike had come and gone from the room as they put together the most effective plan for the most peaceful transference of power from Mycroft to Sherlock as the new king of the north, a title that still sent a rush through him. His first act as king had been to insist his brother’s advisers be sacked and sent on their way.
Sherlock is a thing of beauty, an angel made flesh. John can feel a deep sorrow in the music that pours from the prince’s fingers, but also a secret longing; a tiny flicker of hope behind the misery.
John remembers it. It had been in the northern king’s hand when last they’d met several years back. It had made Mycroft appear older then he was.
“He’ll turn up,” Sherlock mutters, “somehow he always does. He’ll find a way to ruin our happiness again, or something else will.”
Sherlock crosses his knees and glares up at John, his entire demeanor shifting to something icy. He leans back against the chair and brings his steepled fingers to his lips. John suddenly feels exposed.
The tunnels are so dark that Sherlock can hardly see, but the feeling of John pressed against him is so familiar he doesn’t need to see to know its him.
There is a pang in his chest because he knows it cannot always be this way. Very soon Rosie will need her own room, and she and John will have to leave Baker Street again; leave Sherlock again. And after that Sherlock knows it can only be another few years at best before he will need to disappear from the Watson’s lives altogether.
