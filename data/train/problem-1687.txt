“Yes.” He said tersely, a friend, a ghost, a bother maybe. Now he wished he had never opened the door, he should have waited, she would have gone away, then he wouldn't have to deal with this, instead he could be watching bacteria go through asexual reproduction, maybe he could even be laying down resting, but instead he sat there tense and alert wondering when John would be back so he could take his lady and leave.
"Did you think you could get away from me?!" Moran snarled as Sherlock collapsed onto his side. He weezes out a breathe as Moran begins to kick him viciously in the stomach, legs, and ribs. Pain explodes through Sherlocks body with every blow.
From what Sherlock can see, his wrists are the worst. Rubbed raw by the rope and bruised from being so tightly restrained.
John stared at the sight of London from where he stood just a few feet from the doorway, his heart pounding in his chest as he began to move slowly at first, one foot in front of the other, before he fell into a steadier stride with his shoulders squared and his head held high as if he was silently daring Moran to close the door in his face.  Instead the sniper just offered him a toothless grin that made him feel uneasy as he stepped over the threshold and into the cool London air.
“You tell me.” He said as she leaned forward slightly, her eyes scanning over the words that had not been black out by the marker. A small feeling of satisfaction settling in the older man’s chest as her eyes widened as she began to realize what she was reading.
Sherlock’s lips pulled up slightly around the corners in a smile and he went quiet for a moment, shifting his weight as he uncrossed his legs before crossing them again.
The creaking of the steps grabbed Sherlock’s attention the dark haired man turned his attention to the door as his brother did the same, he knew the steps and the gait of the person well enough and his heart stopped. How much had John heard?
"If you don't comply, I'll have someone put a bullet in his head. John watched as Sherlock stopped once more, his body tensing at the fact he was trading something he had yet to give to anyone for his friends life.
Sherlock didn’t remember falling asleep, the last thing he remembered was laying his head on the pillow Mycroft had placed on his lap and the feeling of his brother running his fingers through his curls. It had been years since anything of that sort had happened, well at least since Redbeard had died. Usually he didn’t seek out his brother for any sort of reassurance and affection though things were different now, he was willing to admit that he needed someone to help him cope and at the moment it wasn’t John. He wasn’t even certain if John would have showed up if he had called him anyway.
He refuses to look at himself in the mirror as he peels of his coat and suit jacket, tossing them on the chair by the shower. His tailored shirt is ruined, bit he doesn't care as he unbuttons the few fastenings left and tosses on the floor. The detective falters as he undoes his trousers and it takes him a moment to shove them down to the ground. His heart pounds as he slips his thumbs under the waist band of his pants and tries to slip out of them, wincing as he has to literally peel them from his skin
“Tea is on the top shelf in the cupboard over the sink.” He said as Mycroft turned around to look him over. Sherlock knew he wasn’t much of a sight, his curly hair a mess, his clothes wrinkled from sleep.
“Come alone John. You and I have some business to attend to, I believe.” He stated as he turned his attention towards the Doctor, the look on the younger man’s face telling him that was not what John had in mind. “Sherlock will be fine, I’m sure. My Brother understands the severity of the situation.” He lingered for a moment before turning to make his way to the Mercedes. The last thing John wanted was to come with them, however the doctor needed to be there for nothing more than to understand why Mary had targeted Sherlock, why Sherlock was a target to begin with.
The brunette gradually pushed himself into a sitting position, his eyes scanning around the bedroom as he heard noise from the kitchen, his body tensing before he realized that it must have been Mycroft, unless there was someone who had broken into his flat to make tea and at this hour John would have been at the clinic. The floor was cold under his feet as he stood, padding his way into the kitchen, pausing as he saw Mycroft looking through the cupboards.
It had been nearly two months since he had last seen or heard from Moran and while that filled him with relief, he knew that the man would be calling soon to collect on his promise.
“Yeah, well that isn’t want this headline or the picture say.” John replied as he held the paper out for Sherlock to take. The paper crumpled around his hands as he snatched it from John, his heart pounding as he stared down at the image of him standing by Greg behind the Police tape, most likely taken seconds after Lestrade had gotten off the phone with Mycroft and they were heading towards the curb to wait for the car.
Perhaps it was the declaration of feelings on his part, the fact Sherlock had not said a word afterwords and left him hanging that made him reluctant to go back. He didn’t want things to be awkward.
"I should be going, I have paperwork to finish." Greg said sheepishly as he dug into his jacket. "I shouldn't have this, let alone give this to you, but I think you'll do a better job at finding the bastard who did this."
“They are terminated from their position and it goes on their file that they breached doctor- patient confidentially, why do you ask?”
“That was a nice game you played out there, but don’t you think it’s time to come back and rest for a bit dear?” Sherlock asks, his eyes dancing over the others face as they begin to scowl.
Though now, he wished he had been slightly rude and told her to go, to leave him be, if he had then maybe he could be sleeping, instead of dealing with the thoughts running through his head at a thousand miles an hour. Was Sherlock sleeping? Was he sitting up awake? Was he calling for John because the Moran in his mind was viciously attacking him once more? Or was he just lying awake so he didn’t have to deal with anything of the sort? Had those media hounds staked their claim to his doorstep once more, standing out there like wolves waiting for their prey? Or had one been brave enough to find out the street door was unlocked and managed to make their way inside and were hounding him with personal and private questions he didn’t know how to answer?
He came without warning less than ten thrusts later, his ejaculate coating cupboards under the counter he had braced himself against. The clenching of his muscles brought Sherlock over the edge a few moments later, the brunette thrusting four more times before burying himself deep inside his lovers body as he came.
"Its alright John, I'll find you. I promise."  there was a sincere tone to Greg's voice and John had no choice but to believe him.
Uncertainty filled him as the metal doors slid open as he stepped on, pressing the button for the fourth floor.
A sneer appeared on Mycroft’s lips as he crowded John’s space. “It’s not what I think? You have no idea what I think Doctor.”
Panic began to rise in the pit of his stomach the more John talked and the more he avoided his question about what happened.
“Let me explain, please.” He begged as the taller man continued to come closer until he was backed against the wall. “Please it’s not what you think.”
John was about to turn when Mycroft looked up from whatever he had been looking at and the look on his face turned from the usual expressionless mask to one of distain before he stood.
Sherlock stood there for what seemed like an hour but it couldn't have been more than a few moments until the nurse came back with a wheel chair.
Sherlock looked up at Greg as he paused between files, the silver haired man filling out the incident reports and case files from the murders that had crossed his desk in the days prior. His eyes moved towards the single file in the in tray on his desk and his fingers were itching to grab it. It was new, fresh, something he could dive deeper in, something that could provide something more than a slice of normalcy for him. However, he knew Greg would tell him no, that he couldn't be involved with the new case and that until things were sorted, the mostly finished stack of cold cases were all he was going to get.
“Sherlock, things like that are going to happen, you saw someone that reminded you of him, so you are going to react accordingly. There is nothing to be sorry for.”
When the blows stopped, Sherlock unfurled himself and looked at Moran and his heaving chest. It wad against better judgment that Sherlock moved to crawl away, placing one hand on the carpet and began to pull himself away.
“It seems as if one of your employees took it upon themselves to release sensitive information about my brother, including a photograph of him while he was at your facility undergoing treatment and I am not very pleased.” Mycroft stated
He bolts towards the his bedroom, if he can get a head start he can get out the window and down the fire escape. He won't be hurt there. He refuses to be harmed in his own home. He's supposed to be safe there.
John took a deep breathe as he stretched Sherlock to the best of his ability, he knew they didn’t have much time to properly prepare the curly haired man as he would have liked. This was going to be unpleasant. He worked all three fingers inside to the third knuckle and stretched him to the best of his ability before removing them. His heart was pounding as he undid the button and fly to his jeans, swallowing loudly as he tried to relieve the dryness that was occurring in his mouth. He shoved his jeans and pants down to his knees, the cool air unpleasant against his skin, but it gave him something else to think about other than the fact he was a few moments away from taking his best friends virginity.
John's hand flexes around his phone "How is this my fault?! I have a life outside of just him, since when is it my full time job to be his babysitter?"
The doctor pulled the second packet of lube he had been given and tore it open, squeezing it’s contents into his palm before placing the trash into his pocket. He closed his eyes as his hand closed around his partially limp cock, the cool lube making him shiver as he tugged at his flesh, coating himself well enough while making himself hard. His heart stopped and he felt sick as he realized there was nothing more that he could do to postpone this so he shuffled forward.
The water was more of a gel, most likely mixed with something to thicken it up so he wouldn’t choke on it, it was unpleasant both in taste and texture however at the same time it was welcome to ease the dryness in his mouth and throat.
"No, you don't. I called them before I called Sherlock. I told them you were sick." Greg stated and both Sherlock and John looked at him for a moment.
“I’m sorry.” He muttered as he looked at the older man. “I can’t handle this, I thought I could, but I can’t”
"M-my hands are tied." John mumbled and Greg moved slightly to dig the pen knife he had in his pocket to cut off the rope binding him.
"Your Johnny won't be able to help you now." The man replied as he grabbed Sherlock's arms and pinned them above his head as he threw a leg over Sherlock's waist, moving to straddle the other man, leering down at him as he spoke. "And to think I was going to go easy with you."
The night was quiet as John laid awakes staring up at the ceiling in the darkness, the arm across his chest serving as a reminder that he wasn’t where he was supposed to be, with Sherlock at Baker Street. He had hoped and prayed that Mary wouldn’t linger and that she would eventually saunter off back to her own place allowing him to sneak back off to the second bedroom he had been staying at for more than a few days a week since he had looked Sherlock over. He wanted an actual chance to talk to Sherlock, fill him in, talk things over and make sure that they were on the same page before things got too out of hand and Sherlock reverted back to his old coping habits. However Mary did not give him that chance, she had made it rather clear she wasn’t going to leave him alone. She had stayed until it was too late for her to wandering around and it wasn’t necessarily polite to tell one’s future wife to scram so he could watch over his best friend.
The noise startled him, it was the last thing he was expecting, John, Mycroft, and Greg had keys so they had no reason to knock and no reporter would be brave enough to actually come and disturb him themselves, at least not after Kitty Reily. He stopped and stared at the door, hoping that it was just his mind playing tricks on him, he didn’t want anyone to be there, he didn’t really want to see anyone or have a stranger in his space. He paused and looked at the door, silently praying that there wouldn’t be a second knock, though when there was, he felt his stomach clench.
It seemed as if they knew he was calling as the phone rang and rang but he doubted their phones flashed with a sign that read ‘pissed off Government official line 4’ though they might was well have one by the time he was finished.
“Sherlock… please” John begged , breaking the kiss for a breath. The pleading in his voice is something Sherlock rarely hears, and when he does it is usually in these kinds of situations.
All of his mail went to a postal box, there where no checks, credit cards, or debit cards in his name and if there where, they hadn't been used since just after He was discharged.
“Let go of the door John.” Mary stated as she turned to face him but not really meeting his face, her hand still on the door knob.
“Why am I here Mycroft?” He asked as they trekked inside the building, his fiancée now flanked by two of Mycroft’s people that seemed to be hiding in the shadows, waiting for them.
Anger was surging back through Mycroft’s veins as John went quiet, it was obviously not the detailed version of events, but it was enough to get a clear picture and it matched up with Sherlock’s admission that he had been forcefully taken by two different people on James Moriarty’s orders.
“Mary did.” Mycroft answered and went on to explain before Sherlock could interrupt. “She faked a medical release form and sent it to the hospital after you had been discharged no doubt. She would have found out some information from John and used it to her own advantage. “
The younger man slipped in without a sound, remaining quiet as he did his seatbelt before slumping against the window to hide his face from most of the world. Neither of them said a word as they pulled away from the curb and into the traffic, instead sitting in a somewhat comfortable silence.
Mycroft offered him a small smile before standing, the hands on his face falling away as he turned to make his way into the kitchen to turn on the kettle. Sherlock looked down at his hands before looking up at the man in his kitchen, it was almost like when Sherlock was in Uni and had just begun to use, Mycroft making tea to get his nerves to calm slightly before they begun any discussion on why he had chosen cocaine over studying.
The government official followed the nurse behind the double doors and down a long hallway to where he suspected lead to the patient's rooms. Their footsteps echoed on the tile of the floor as they walked and Mycroft's heart began to pound as they paused in front of a door. The hand written nameplate underneath the room number reading. Holmes, S.
The detective groaned in discomfort, pain shooting up his spine as he was stretched larger than he was prepared for.
“Hello, John?” the sound of Greg’s voice filtered through the speaker and into the dark silent alley. “what’s up?”
The detective shifted in his chair, watching his friend as he still slept. He had thought about going to get John's clothes himself, but he would still have to answer questions and that meant he had to leave John alone.
The eldest holmes took a deep breath as he tossed the last paper onto his desk before leaning back against his chair, running his hands down his face as he exhaled. They had been thorough when it came to getting Sherlock back for Moriarty’s death and despite the fact many did not expect the detective to live through his captivity they had come up with a backup plan that would ruin him if he did.
“Move” John panted and Sherlock complied by pulling out slightly before pushing back in, his hands gently grasping John’s hips for balance as he worked himself into a decent rhythm that had the doctor moaning and gasping under him.
“It’s alright Sherlock.” John reassured him, the hand on his hip moving to rub his side in some sort of comforting gesture as the other man stopped. They had yet to properly begin and Sherlock wanted none of this, this wasn’t alright anymore. Sherlock took a deep breath, willing his body to relax.
“She did.” He nodded once, his voice coming out softly as he spoke, as if it was catching up with him now, all of this. “When she came over before you came back, she voiced that I was keeping you from your life and making you rather miserable, and that is the last thing that I want for you.”
John focuses on the sound of supplies being set out: sterile gauze, suture kit, and latex gloves. There is the sound of gloves being snapped on before Sherlock comes into his line of sight. Latex covered hands pushed away Johns own from the wound he has been applying pressure to while Sherlock examines it.
Mycroft huffed, he was getting annoyed, it really wasn’t that hard to say it was it? He could do it, he had always been the one to tell people things that hurt them to shove them away.
“Who told you that you were a bother to me?” John asked again and Sherlock shook his head before he stood, wiping his sweaty hands on his trousers.
The months following her entry into John Watson’s life were rather pleasant, and the fact she had a job to do was the farthest thing from her mind, though it occasionally surfaced as she received updates from Moran on the detective’s whereabouts as they all patiently waited for his return to London. The night he returned to London, Mary’s anxiety spiked, however, it didn’t last long, there wasn’t much of an uproar. No one even seemed to notice and that was all due to the plans they had been carrying out. The home stretch of this plan happened after they knew that Sherlock had been taken, all they had to do was wait for the message saying that the detective had been taken care of once and for all before they could all finally move on to bigger and better things.
The bank account he had had been closed after his last check from the army had been cashed and the place he was staying had been vacated the same week. There was no forwarding address.
Sherlock was attempting to keep his heart from beating it's way through his ribs as he felt his legs and back exposed to the cold air of the room. John's hand slowly rubbing his sides, reassuring him that he will be okay, it'll be fine and Sherlock wants to believe it.
John makes that decision for him as he gently pulls him until Sherlock is laying on his lap, his head resting against John’s shoulder.
Sherlock felt a tightness in his chest as he tossed the paper off to the side, of course someone was bound to notice him while he had been out the day before. How could anyone miss him? He hadn’t changed anything about his appearance what so ever.
That was all that had been said on the subject, until last night after dinner had been eaten and the dishes stacked up in the sink to be done later.
Deeper in the box, were what he was hoping he honestly wouldn’t find, and as he pulled out the manila folder from the box and placed it onto the desk, his blood running cold as he flipped open the file to find papers he had seen before, some of which he had signed off on, others had only been seen by the physicians that had treated his brother after he had been taken up to intensive care. He flipped through the papers, eyes scanning the notes and such she had most likely read, though what she would have done with the information was unknown.
He's quiet, reserved and exhausted as he emerges from his room the next morning. Sherlock couldn't sleep. He was afraid to. So he didn't. He wants to shower again. But it's early and John is home.
He turned quickly as the kettle began to whistle, rushing over to turn it off before he disturbed Sherlock’s peaceful slumber. Though as his tea steeped it appeared as if he was not quick enough as he heard Sherlock’s mattress squeak as he rose. John turned to watch as his friend came down the hall and stopped by the fridge, his curls were mused as his rubbed the sleep away from his face.
The government official stared at the smug look on the man's face, memorizing it, burning the image into his brain with the knowledge that the vile creature leaving his brother's flat had assaulted Sherlock just moments before.
Mrs. Hudson rolled her eyes. “You’d better go up and see him, dear,” she advised, and bustled away. Bay shook his head and started to climb the narrow staircase.
The question gave Bilbo pause, which he was not successful in concealing. “Oh, I don’t think so,” he finally answered, trying to sound casual.
“You’re very loyal, very quickly,” the man observed from behind him. Bay decided he couldn’t rely on him for a ride and pointed himself in the direction of the warehouse exit, which seemed a very long way away. “You’ve had little reason to trust anyone in your life, John Watson.” The use of his real name made him slow for a moment, but then he kept going. “Can it be that you’ve decided to trust Magnus Holmes, of all people? Despite your lack of memory? How interesting.” He quite liked the sound of his own voice, apparently. Well, the warehouse did give it a nice echo effect.
Aquamarine looked at the pill in his hand. He looked at the pill in the man’s hand. Had he made the right decision? Had he played the game correctly? There was only one way to find out. Kneeling on the hard-packed earth, he raised the pill up to the moonlight, as though he could see some difference in it.
Bay tried to breathe regularly, in and out. “My master says I was hit on the head as a child,” he conveyed.
Was it a trap? Everything was a trap. He opened his eyes anyway, or one; the other was swollen shut. The man was kneeling in the dirt now, careless of his expensive suit the way people were who could afford more. “That’s it,” he coaxed, opening the good eye a little wider with gentle fingers. His hands were huge. “Lovely shade of blue,” he murmured, half to himself. “Think I’ll call you Bay. What do you think of that?” There was a curious smirk on his full lips, like he was telling an inside joke.
He stood, waiting to become used to it again. His eyes drifted up to the ceiling of the tent, to the soft golden lights in the corners. Where did those
, but he knew Master was looking more for an acknowledgement and acceptance of his order. Finally he nodded tightly.
Molly was in charge of the socks and she made Aquamarine sit down in one of the deck chairs near John, kneeling to drag the socks onto his unwilling feet. They were long and elegant, like his hands, and apparently just as capable of mischief, if Molly’s noises of frustration were anything to go by. “There, now don’t take them off!” she insisted.
Aquamarine froze in the middle of sucking olive juice off his fingers. Irene seemed equally apprehensive about the order, which was an unexpected mood for her. Apparently she preferred her dangerous toys to be unarmed, at least.
After a moment his posture changed subtly and he said dismissively, “Well, I’ve a mess to clean up. Dr. Watson.”
was the dream—nightmare, more like—and those other things were reality. Such thoughts were pointless, though, as long as beatings in
Ivan grinned at him slowly. “You might make a very effective spy,” he suggested, and Nico’s head snapped up, eyes wide. They held a tinge of fear.
fellow, and he wasn’t a violent person, despite being in the Army. But now he was some kind of conqueror, sweeping across the peaceful kingdoms in his path like a farmer scything wheat, turning his back on his rapacious followers and facing ever forward, to the next land. He was searching for something, something he was desperate to possess, and he knew he was getting closer to it, and that proximity spurred him on, lashing his horse to slog through the mud, over the mountains that they said could never be breached, across the mighty rivers. He had never felt so driven and single-minded before, and there was an exhilarating clarity to it, a simplicity. He knew, vaguely, that his men admired him for it, admired him even as they feared him, even as they wondered how he could reject the generous offers of settlement that came his way, how he could face the mightiest armies without hesitation. And then, in a drafty medieval castle, once the property of a now-cowering king, he found—people whispered about a boy, well, a teenager, adult enough in this day and age, and as he turned in the firelight his eyes blazed blue with defiance—
“I’m still right here,” she pointed out sardonically. He pushed his head under her hand anyway to confirm her scent, conscious of not getting blood on her. “Honestly,” she huffed, but she ran her hand through his hair anyway.
Aquamarine tipped his head back to look up at him then, blue eyes filled with confusion and perhaps even a little fear. That would go away soon; he couldn’t allow himself to show that for long, but John took it as a certain amount of trust in him, that he was witness to it at all.
, despite his intrusive behavior, so Aquamarine didn’t deliberately wipe blood on him like he wanted to. The slave deduced several other facts about him after a quick perusal, including the likely location of his office, the number of children he had, and his favorite sport. Probably not relevant right now.
“Ah.” Magnus was not the military type, he was too much younger to have met Bay in med school or uni, and they couldn’t have been childhood friends, again because of the age difference but also because Bay didn’t
“Her name’s Jennifer Wilson, according to her credit cards,” Lestrade went on. “We’re running them now for contact details. Hasn’t been here long. Some kids found her.”
“Sorry,” he man said, as Bay struggled to lean against the chair. He sounded sincere but not overly distressed. “I needed to make sure you weren’t faking.” Bay gritted his teeth and crawled into the chair, and the man deigned to hand him his cane, evidently not afraid it would be used against him. “This does change things somewhat. Why don’t you remember?”
Aquamarine pouted; but he held still while Irene put the other shoe on him. Then he slowly swung around until he was sitting upright in the chair again, getting used to the feeling of the heavy boots on his feet. Irene tapped her foot impatiently behind the chair, but John merely watched, letting Aquamarine adjust. Awkwardly he pushed himself out of the chair, standing in the boots and trying to get more comfortable all over again. Irene sighed loudly and John held out his hand to her, letting her settle gracefully on his lap.
Anderson and Donovan blanched with horror while Magnus smirked smugly, before disappearing inside. Bay moved to follow, dropping his gaze and biting his lip a second too late, and Anderson glared murderously at him. “What are you looking at?” the policeman snapped menacingly, raising his arm.
Magnus did not believe him, but Bay clung to his bewilderment stubbornly. “Did you say London?” Bay asked, by way of distraction.
“Yes, I’m sure you do,” his master remarked dryly. “Enough with this ‘sir’ nonsense. No more ‘sir.’ Call me Magnus.” There was an expectant pause.
“Clean,” Aquamarine finally responded, blurting it slightly. It seemed a stupid answer in hindsight.
missed you, though,” Magnus told him, stopping to gaze at him with utter sincerity. He lifted his hand to caress Bay’s cheek. “I always miss you. It’s been quite a long time, this round. More than ten years.” He seemed very sad all of a sudden, and very serious. “I suppose I sound quite mad to you,” he finally admitted, with a dry quirk of a smile. “I hope you’ll understand in time.”
“Don’t—fall asleep,” Magnus warned, throwing himself down beside him as the transport began to rise. “We’ll be cruising soon.” He did
Finally Master began walking towards the Jeep. Aquamarine scrambled out to meet him partway, then remembered he needed to watch the girls and returned to them, then couldn’t help himself and ran back and forth between them until Master snagged his collar and stilled him at his feet.
Well-dressed, money, free. What was she doing dead in a dump like this? Magnus was convinced it was murder, not suicide, and that this was the fourth one by the same person. A serial killer, preying on people who had every reason to think they were safe in this world, who had no reason to be wary. It made Bay terribly sad all of a sudden, thinking about the people who would undoubtedly miss this woman—and more selfishly, that no one would miss
Magnus had pulled his long black coat on and was heading for the door. “Are you going to call the police?” Bay wanted to know, in case they would be showing up any moment.
He walked away from the conversation a few minutes later with a bag of freshly-picked tomatoes, still warm from the sun. Well, actually Aquamarine was carrying them, because that’s what slaves
It had to be the most slapdash and pathetic collar Bay had ever worn. But hey, it worked, and he looped the tag over the neck band. “Acceptable?” Magnus couldn’t help asking, slightly smug as though he’d done something quite brilliant. He tumbled into the seat beside Bay.
“Good boy. You were very impressive tonight,” Master finally praised. Aquamarine bared his teeth to underline the point that he was not only clever, but also fierce. Master grimaced slightly. “Yeah, you do still taste like blood,” he admitted, which was apparently a problem. “Go brush your teeth and come back here.” He glanced significantly at the pile of pillows and blankets that served as a bed, and Aquamarine tried to kiss him again, hungrily. Master gave in for a moment, then pulled back abruptly. “Brush your teeth,” he repeated, letting Aquamarine go. He hurried off to obey in record time.
She gave him a fond smile. “That’s right, dear. He said you wouldn’t remember. It’ll be so nice to have you back, he can be such a pill on his own,” she added conspiratorially.
She gave him a slightly disbelieving smile, like he was being cheeky to expect an answer. He double-checked her throat; definitely a slave collar, twisted gold strands with an oval tag dangling from them, though at this angle he couldn’t read the writing on it. “Anthea,” she finally told him, which might or might not be true. Obviously she knew who
“John!” his mother called from the back door. She wanted him to come in before the neighbors—who were probably still sound asleep—saw him holding the man who was having a nervous breakdown in the yard.
“You’ll like where we’re going,” Magnus told him, with some enthusiasm. He was like a child with a new pet. “I’ve got a flat in London. Have you been to London? Possibly my favorite city. Here and now, anyway. The energy, the people—you’ll like it, too. History, food, shops. You like that kind of thing.” He sounded very confident on this point, and Bay nodded when he looked at him. “The flat at Baker Street, of course, with Mrs. Hudson. I went a bit more upscale this time, a bit larger. Not ridiculous, but very comfortable. I’ve been looking for you for quite some time, and you know how I start messing about if I have to wait—“
His master saw through that and smirked, but there was something sad in his eyes. Bay pondered that as they resumed walking. Sad that he would have to punish the slave later? Sad that he’d led a life of slavery? It was an odd reaction. Some people had odd reactions, though—odd people, whose actions couldn’t be predicted because something wasn’t right inside their heads. He’d had masters like that before, too. With them you could only endure, or die.
a bit mad, eccentric, brilliant, with several large gaps in his social education. He was mercurial—today it might be showers and hot tea, but who knew what tomorrow would bring?
, though not what he had assumed it would be, was quite cozy, especially because it seemed to be cold here all the time, even at the sun’s height during what Master claimed was summer.
Master knelt to restrain him better. “This is Detective Inspector Lestrade,” he told Aquamarine. “He’s a friend. Give him your hand to smell.”
The remark was meant to provoke, but Aquamarine stayed in place and just bared his teeth, still bloody, and gave a low growl. The pale Westerner in his fancy suit might be powerful, but he didn’t like to get his hands dirty; Aquamarine spotted his almost imperceptible grimace. But, he didn’t look away.
help?” Sherlock asked idly. “Alcoholic,” he judged, when John started to pause before a thirtyish woman.
“Unlikely!” Magnus declared confidently, popping out of his chair. Bay was not sure Magnus was really the right person to comment on what was likely among normal people. Then again, serial killers were not normal, either.
There was a knock on the door. “Bay, are you alright?” He couldn’t catch his breath to answer, and Magnus slid the door open a couple inches, to see Bay’s hands braced against the wall as the treacherous, glorious water stripped the grime from him. “You’re making noise.”
“No, not at all,” Magnus assured him. “In my dream I was a Man, and so were you, and we lived together in a big city, and we solved crimes!”
Magnus was crouched beside him, eyes probing his face as though he could read his mind. “There you are,” he remarked when he saw Bay focus again. “The transport’s here.”
, the truth,” Magnus proclaimed grandly. “Which can almost always be worked out using observation and logical deduction. Physical evidence is part of that,” he conceded, “but I don’t need a
He was on the point of shutting the door to undress when Magnus spoke again, his voice still safely situated in the kitchen. “You’re very agreeable and polite,” he judged, not sounding entirely thrilled with this.
“That’s not as much fun!” Magnus declared, as if it should be obvious. “Do you go through a deck of cards, pick out all the best ones, and say that’s the hand you’re playing with? No, there’s no skill in that, no challenge, no interest.”
John was at the kitchen table having his morning coffee across from his mother when he heard the noise. He turned in his chair to look out the back window, then jumped to his feet. “S—t,” he swore, hurrying outside. His mother was always worrying about what the neighbors would think; a man screaming in the backyard just after dawn was probably a bit not good. He could hardly blame him, though. “Aquamarine!” he called as he crossed the back deck.
“Yes. These murders should keep him happy for a while,” the man observed, as if this was a silly little quirk of Magnus’s. “We wouldn’t want him to get bored, would we? But
Bilbo felt there was something Magnus wasn’t telling him; but how could a dragon, asleep in his treasure hoard for two hundred years, know anything about Bilbo that the Hobbit himself didn’t know? Unless dragons had some kind of future-sight. Or past-sight.
“Stay up on your knees, please,” Master said, fingers grazing the back of his calves and thighs. “You had whip marks on your legs, fairly fresh,” he reminded him. “Those have healed nicely.” Aquamarine reached back and felt only the smooth unmarked skin. Quite amazing. Master’s satisfaction suggested that this was not always the expected result, advanced Western medicine or not.
Irene nodded, appreciating the praise. “He wouldn’t wear pants, though, Master,” she smirked, “but I didn’t think those were essential.”
He waited to see if the umbrella would rise again but the man merely rolled his eyes. “A bank account could be set up in your name, cash on demand,” he continued. “A meaningful sum every month. You look more like someone who would save it up, though,” he predicted.
Molly joined them, watching Aquamarine worriedly. “Should he be climbing that tree, Master?” she asked, and Irene looked smug.
Magnus closed the door in his face. “Yes, thank you for your input.” His attention was still on his phone.
to be a slave, but rather my forensically-minded colleague.” Bay turned to him slowly, trying to decide how serious he was. He feared he was very serious indeed. “On second thought—which I don’t usually bother with, by the way—I see that would not go over well.”
Magnus stood fluidly, Bay less so. His new master watched him struggle to rise, with his cane and the wall, but did not move to help; that was alright with Bay. Sometimes with helping, or hurrying, he ended up in worse shape.
“See, he’ll get it,” he soothed Irene, who was still looking peeved over the whole adventure. “You picked out very nice clothes for him. Mrs. Hudson gave you the sizes?” Somehow the housekeeper always seemed to know the proper fit.
“Okay.” Bay pushed himself up and tottered to the bed, lying down on his side facing Magnus. It was not a fast or painless process.
Magnus hesitated, but kept walking; the lemonade stand faded into the distance. “Don’t call me master.”
His master nodded slowly. “Yes, I expect that would be novel for you,” he agreed seriously. “I like my slaves to be clean, I expect you to bathe and change your clothes regularly.” Aquamarine nodded in agreement. “Take your shirt off and come here,” his master instructed. “I want to see how your injuries have healed.”
Magnus let out a sigh, and caressed Bay’s cheek with his thumb until he relaxed marginally. “I’ll get you a warmer jacket,” he finally promised, “and we’re actually going to a restaurant. You can eat whatever you like there. Will you please come with me?”
Master was coming. Master would help him. Aquamarine stopped screaming and dropped to the ground, wrapping his arms around his legs and burying his face against his knees, trying to blot out this new world that made so little sense. Maybe it was just a hallucination. Maybe he was sick, injured, finally losing his mind.
a lot of things, and also curiously few, compared to his observations of other people. His master would want a useful answer, he decided, not a perfunctory one. But did he want to know how Aquamarine felt physically, emotionally? What sort of answer was he expecting? Did he want something overall positive, to validate his treatment of Aquamarine so far, or something negative, indicating what was still needed? Not that
“Done? Good,” he noted when it seemed safe. “Now get in bed before you freeze.” The nights were remarkably cold around here.
In fact, he grinned manically as Bay realized this. “Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe the murderer took it from her for some reason,” Magnus speculated. So she couldn’t call for help, was Bay’s grim guess. “Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.”
Molly tentatively walked out into the yard with the tube of sunscreen, trying to motion Aquamarine over. He changed direction too abruptly and landed in a tangled heap at her feet. John could see he was frustrated with himself but he stilled when Molly knelt down to help him, mindful of hurting or startling her. That was a good sign; Molly had been through a lot in her life, more than John liked to think about, but she still retained her kind heart somehow. She could just be a little skittish sometimes.
“Dr. John Watson.” He froze at the woman’s voice, the name and title sounding so shocking and yet familiar to him. He tried to tell himself it didn’t mean anything, his birth name and career history were a matter of public record. Still, they’d managed to look him up so quickly, and with the phone thing, obviously they had resources…
As they reached the pavement a man wearing coveralls stepped outside, the permanent sneer on his face deepening as he spotted Magnus. He had not made friends for himself on the police force, had he?
“Your master, who abandoned you at a crime scene, without even a proper jacket?” the man asked archly.
“Nico,” the boy replied, without further games. Ivan found it interesting that he gave only his familiar nickname, and not all the other names and titles to which he was due. Maybe he realized he wasn’t due them anymore.
They were stopped at the yellow tape by an official-looking woman, whose expression contained nothing but displeasure. “Hello, freak,” she said to Magnus acidly, and Bay’s eyebrows rose fractionally in surprise at the disrespect.
Magnus hadn’t mentioned how her makeup was streaked with tears; obviously she’d realized she was going to die. And yet she’d had enough time, presumably alone, to scratch those letters into the wood floor—wouldn’t the killer have stopped her, if they’d been together? And if she could scratch letters into the wood floor, could she not have called or texted for help? Bay accepted there
to calm down. He meant to keep fighting. “That’s it, good boy. You know I just want to help you.” He couldn’t give in, just because the man’s voice was soothing, his touch gentle. Anyone could fake that temporarily. He heard a whine and was ashamed to realize it was coming from his own throat. “I know, you’re safe now,” his new master assured him. “You’re injured and I’m going to help you. Molly’s going to help you. You’ll let Molly help you, won’t you?”
Bilbo treated the endearments like a cultural quirk, something that didn’t translate quite right. “Fine, thank you,” he replied politely. “And you?”
flirtatious looks; Aquamarine had seen plenty of bad things happen to slaves who drew too much attention to themselves.
Magnus chuckled at the pun—dragons liked a bit of cleverness now and then—but somehow Bilbo knew he was not going to let this drop. Still, the dragon got Bilbo on his head again and picked up the basket, and made his way to the laundry room without further comment.
John resisted rolling his eyes. He was glad they were concerned about Aquamarine; sometimes they didn’t take to new slaves well, even those who seemed more compatible, on the surface, than a wildling. “He’s fine,” he assured them, though he found himself watching Aquamarine’s ascent closely. It was slower this time, and his shoes occasionally slipped on the branches the way his bare feet hadn’t. He disappeared behind the leaves, portions of the tree shaking to indicate where he was. Only when he reemerged on his way back down did John relax slightly, and realize he’d been tense at all.
"I was... I just..." she backed away from him, knocking a vase off in the process. The flowers in it dropped on the rug, the vase turned into shards as the water slipped away from it onto the ground.
Another loud groan was the only answer she received. Joan looked around and called out for help but the back alley was quiet and there was no one in sight so she reached one of her hands into her jeans pocket for her phone to call an ambulance while still applying pressure to his wound with her free hand.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter. I hadn't had the motivation to post for so long but a few friends cheered me on and here we are. Kudos and comments appreciated 🥰
He took some time to consider it; "I won't lie to you. Lies break trust and I want you to trust me so I'll always be honest with you. You just simply can't leave this flat for now. You'll just have to accept this fact as it is."
"I don't think she's in a fit state for talking," Joan whispered to Sherlock as they all walked towards their seats, making sure that Sophia wouldn't hear her.
"I couldn't let you go out and get yourself food on your own so I had the boys from the café below bring you something to eat while you were asleep. Thought you might be hungry."
"You must be tired." He said, interrupting her thoughts and breaking the silence. It was only then that she noticed the darkness outside and that he'd turned the lights on. The night had fallen without her even noticing the passing of time.
He shrugged his shoulders. "I never really believed this myth enough to do actual research about it but from what I've heard, yes."
"The man who had stabbed me would have finished what he'd started if you hadn't intervened. It would cause too much trouble for him to kill me in front of a witness. So he'd be forced to kill you too. But he couldn't risk killing a human because, while a vampire may get away with killing another vampire -which has happened before- they would never get away with killing a human and the risk of exposing our secret to the police and then to the public. So he was forced to postpone his plans and to try his chance with me another time."
Sebastian was being kept in a mostly dark cell-like room under heavy chains and locks."Joan Watson… what a surprise," He looked up once she opened the door. "To what do I owe the pleasure?" he asked curiously with a grin.
Cold and dark: that's how the old cemetery was on that dreadful night. There was no one in sight save for Sherlock himself. He felt the cold pierce through his skin as he tried to wrap himself further up into his coat, and that was when he noticed that his hands were red with fresh blood. It wasn't his own, couldn't have been; he wasn't injured. There was no wound nor pain.
"What for? There are hospital’s full of people dying, Doctor. Why don’t you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them?"
"Every time I held you, that's when. I'd ask you about it indirectly but you'd never reply. He would text you in the middle of the night and you'd just go. You'd always go to him, you'd never say no, not even once. You introduced him to me as your cousin but I didn't buy it. Despite all of that, I still stood by you. After we got engaged, it just got worse so I did some digging. I found out what he really was. When you told me you were pregnant, I couldn't take it anymore, I flipped and then left. But I still loved you."
Joan was struggling to drift off that night, as her mind wouldn’t rest. It was three A.M when she jolted awake from a nightmare, awoken by her own screaming. As usual, the nightmare was about the war. She'd had many nightmares about her time in the army since she had returned to London but they had stopped abruptly after she had met Sherlock.
"Some are, but not most of them. It's rather difficult to explain. The myth is that the vampire is drawn towards their companion, even if they don't quite realise it. There is a subconscious bond… an unseen but everlasting link between the two of them."
Suddenly a scream was heard from the dance floor and it drew her attention to itself. She'd been so caught up with Sebastian and this new vampire that she'd lost her focus on the case.
“Slight change of plans,” Magnus announced, eyes glued to his phone. “There’s been another killing—another suicide, which is really a murder—and Lestrade wants me to come straight to the crime scene.” He looked at Bay. “Are you up for it?”
The man nodded with interest and actually made eye contact with Bay. “Oh, nice. What do you call him?”
The large vehicle loomed right in front of them and Magnus gestured for him to get on first. The cabin was spacious and Bay sat in one of the seats automatically, reaching for the restraining belt to pull across himself. Magnus tapped at the control panel on the wall and the door slid shut, sealing them off from the heat and the dust of the market. The interior was cool and clean; Bay felt like he was soiling it. Well, it was just a transport. He leaned his head back and closed his dry eyes.
New name, didn’t matter, people got excited giving new things pretty names. It wore off quickly, became a curse instead of an endearment.
Ivan gave him a moment. “Finish what you were doing,” he prompted, pointing towards his foot. Looking slightly embarrassed by his outburst, Nico complied. Ivan decided to stop toying with him, at least for the moment. He’d had a hard day, after all. Even if he hadn’t actually been
. “But I’ve desperately wanted a lot of things,” he added more softly, eyes downcast, “and I’ve never gotten any of them.” Not through any means he considered unexplainable.
“Were you listening to what the salesman said?” Magnus went on, with some amusement. “Bad attitude, that’s what he said about you. Sneaky and intractable!” He laughed suddenly, as if this assessment was hard to believe. “Not a very good seller, is he?”
“Yes, well, the car bit is not always required,” he allowed. “Applies here, though.” After a moment he suddenly turned his mobile facedown and rested his full attention on Bay. “I’ve neglected you. I promised to make you comfortable.”
Funny, usually “Nico” was the one causing massive destruction and loss of life, and shrugging it off as unimportant. But Ivan had been born and raised in a brutal place where only the strong survived—true, his perspective had changed somewhat as his memories had returned, but they didn’t alter the character he’d developed here and now. At least, he chose
But then the dragon started to rise. “But, I suppose I really ought to go, um…” A dragon at a loss for words was an interesting sight. “Patrol the entrances,” he finally finished. “Thought I felt a draft the other day. We don’t want anyone sneaking in and bothering us.” He bared his sword-like teeth in a grin.
“Very evocative,” the man agreed, again looking at Bay. It was phrased almost as a direct compliment.
Any amount he’d relaxed, Aquamarine tensed up again. “You might have to sleep on the couch in the living room,” John pressed on helplessly, “or in the tent, in your own room, or mine if you prefer—” He was not really addressing Aquamarine’s concern directly, he could see. Well if the bloody man refused to
“My name is Magnus,” the man told him. “I’ve just bought you. Absurd, really. Interesting idea, to preserve the institution, but quite indefensible on a moral scale. Not that I care about that, really—you’re usually the one who gets worked up about such things.”
“Yes, indeed,” Irene agreed, lasciviously. She waited a beat, still reclining against the pillows, and when Aquamarine didn’t respond the way she wanted—however that was—she rolled her eyes and went to get some bowls of food from a cabinet. Aquamarine stepped around his master’s feet and knelt down on the floor between him and Irene, not sure how wise it was to get close to his fellow slave, even when she was just preparing a bowl of food for him.
“Here, have a drink,” his master offered, pouring a cup of tea. He held out the cup and Aquamarine stared at it, then him. Then his master set the cup on the ground, leaning over slightly to put it just beyond arm’s reach.
A couple of police officers hurried up the stairs past Bay, seeing him no more than they would a post once they’d spotted the collar, and one of them actually knocked into him as he took the turn too wide. Neither even glanced back and for one horrible moment Bay thought he might fall, painful and humiliating, but he managed to steady himself.
Bay perched on the edge of the booth and Magnus handed him a plastic bottle, cold from the mini-fridge. He opened it immediately and took a sip, grimacing slightly at the chalky flavor, then examined the label.
Aquamarine dressed quickly—just trousers and a blood-stained shirt—and left Master’s room. The tent was eerily quiet. None of Master’s belongings were packed or missing. Same in Molly’s and Irene’s rooms, except for a few toiletries. Aquamarine let out a questioning yip into the stillness. There was no response.
The scene was lit by police car lights and delineated by yellow caution tape, the sort of thing Bay had learned to shy away from. Magnus looked back over his shoulder at him then, tall, sleek, and imperious amid the chaos, and Bay kept limping towards him.
Anderson rolled his eyes. “Oh, don’t pretend you worked that out,” he said, unimpressed. “Somebody told you that.”
After breakfast the girls got dressed to go out, and Master tried to introduce Aquamarine to what he called ‘the conveniences of modern life.’
“Yes, where is it?” Magnus wanted to know, looking around. “She must have had a phone or an organizer. Find out who Rachel is.”
In front of the man was a chair and he pointed at it with the umbrella. “Have a seat,” he suggested, his demeanor affable. Bay walked past the chair and stopped, gazing at the man with a neutrality that masked his assessment—something he’d learned years ago, when meeting new people who had power over him. “The leg must be hurting you,” he observed, more sternly. “Sit down.”
Bilbo scooted to the edge of the mattress—it was big enough to hold several of him—and lowered himself onto the small stepstool, then to the stone floor. For once the oversized furniture was not the result of a Hobbit trying to maneuver in a Man-sized world; it had been built for Dwarves, who were not much bigger than Hobbits. But a Dwarven king’s bedchamber still had to be ridiculously grand, as befit his status.
Bilbo took a deep breath, then sagged with relief. Finding no chair nearby he sat down on the stone floor. Sometimes he chided himself, saying he needed to calm down and look at the advantages to his situation; but inevitably another part of him would yell, “But there’s a DRAGON!” and panic seemed the only logical response.
“Four people are dead,” Magnus reminded him unnecessarily. “There isn’t time to talk to the police.”
“I am a consulting detective, the only one in the world,” Magnus announced, “brilliant, eccentric, antisocial. You are my new slave who assists me in cases—your medical and military background is invaluable in the field, and because you’re a slave, you just have to put up with the misanthropic things I do.” He grinned, so cheeky and self-aware, that Bay chuckled involuntarily. “But I’m going to be a good master,” he promised sincerely. “I know you don’t believe that either. But you’ll see. Only, you might have to remind me of things sometimes,” he conceded, “or just take care of it yourself. Can we start with that?”
And the archenemy? Well, deliberately messing with your head—and Bay hadn’t forgotten the very real pain he’d caused him—seemed like just the sort of thing archenemies did.
Magnus gave a short sigh, having predicted this. “You might have dreams that are really memories of our previous lives,” he went on anyway. “Something historical, or sci-fi or otherwise nonsensical.”
The two vehicles stopped side by side in the road and the back side window on the SUV rolled down, revealing yet another pale Westerner in a fine suit. “Dr. Watson,” he greeted, with a kind of secret amusement, as though he wanted you to think he knew much more than he was saying.
The man smirked more, but his eyes were troubled. Bay—whatever—closed his again, too uninvested in this reality, even with the presence of a beautiful stranger. The name might indicate he was serious about purchasing him, but it was hard to get excited about that anymore. More interesting was the hand that slid from his cheek to the back of his head, cool, strong flesh willingly burying itself in his sweaty, grimy hair. Prelude to a pull or a jerk? Apparently not, as the hand merely drifted around his scalp.
On one wall was a massive fireplace, green like all the carved columns holding up the roof. The area before it had been swept clear of flammable treasures, the floor of golden bits stamped relatively flat, and a table and chair set up. Of course they were the most ornate table and chair Bilbo had ever seen, and the large table was laid with a truly Hobbit-sized breakfast, which for once meant
Genuine question, or couched command? Oddswise the latter, though odds went out the window with this fellow. “Alright.” Magnus released his hand and Bay lowered himself to his knees with the aid of the nearby wall.
Finally she took a seat, opposite him, clutching her coffee cup nervously. John knew she didn’t understand certain things about him, hadn’t understood them in his father either. John couldn’t blame her, he didn’t understand them himself, not really—that’s why he had to tell Aquamarine it was magic. Functionally it
remember such luxuries as indoor plumbing and bio-pools. “You’d better wash up, too, boy,” he advised Nico, who was huddled in a corner out of the way. “You’re not sleeping in my bed covered in grime.”
There was a shout and the man’s slave furiously rushed them, moonlight glittering off his knife. Without another thought Aquamarine threw himself at the man, between the attacker and his master, sinking his teeth into the flesh of the other slave’s throat with a ferocious snarl. His scream was cut short in the still night air, and then he too was bleeding out on the dry earth beside his master.
Aquamarine was content with his tomato and a bite—literally just one—from John’s roast beef sandwich. And actually he didn’t want the bite of sandwich, but John made him take it because he needed a
Well, this was a new one for Bay, he had to admit that. “You’re going to attempt to solve the crime?” he confirmed.
Bilbo did not believe that, because why would he have such strange and nonsensical images in his head, of worlds he’d never seen and things he couldn’t identify? Surely it was more dragon magic, just meant to unnerve him—to what end, Bilbo couldn’t say, but he supposed dragons got bored, and had to amuse themselves somehow. He could think of worse ways.
“Oh, mud probably,” he claimed. “He can be rather messy. I’ll get him cleaned up after breakfast.” Aquamarine made a soft whimpering noise, trying to look innocent.
Aquamarine edged into the tent, scooting around its edges, never turning his back on his master but taking quick, darting glances around the room. Wealthy Westerner, military and medical background but traveling independently, sensible, not planning to stay long, respectful of local cultures. Aquamarine did not think he seemed like a cruel man. But he had been wrong before.
A flap in one wall was the way out. Bells attached to it jangled when he pushed through, startling him. A way of alerting the occupant to a visitor, perhaps to request permission to enter. Was a slave afforded such courtesy? The bells appeared easy to remove; being left in place suggested significance. Now he stood in a fabric hallway, also mysteriously lit. Rather elaborate engineering for a tent. No one else passed through but he heard murmurs here and there.
Master was looking at him with his chin resting in his hand, partially covering his mouth. That usually meant he found something amusing but knew he shouldn’t and was trying to hide it. He raised his eyebrows expectantly at Aquamarine. Well, nobody
The boy stood suddenly, though Ivan merely lounged in his chair. “I’m neither,” he insisted hotly, like it was a matter of honor. “He didn’t have any choice, did he, he
In the room he had lamps casting a warm golden glow over everything. There was an overstuffed chair with an ottoman, right next to the bookcase half-full of books; there was a dresser and a trunk and two nightstands, a full-length looking glass, a huge closet, a writing desk and chair, thick rugs scattered about the floor. For décor he had a king’s ransom of treasures: crystals larger than his hand were lined up across the mantel, his soap dish was gold and encrusted with gems, a silver bowl on the dresser held odd jewels like cat’s-eyes and fire opals, a tapestry of silk and gold hung on the wall.
“Perhaps the country would rather have their heads on pikes, and write ballads about their brave defiance,” Ivan suggested, watching Nico’s work with interest.
Magnus sighed; fortunately he wasn’t facing directly into the room and Bilbo’s bedclothes only fluttered, instead of being blasted off the frame. “You don’t believe me,” he surmised. “That’s very disappointing. It’s been a whole month, I would’ve eaten you already if that was my goal.”
Approaching sirens distracted him. “Okay, okay, come here,” Master ordered. “Are you alright? Are you hurt?” Aquamarine spat a mouthful of blood, not his own, onto the ground nonchalantly. “Try to—clean up a little,” Master suggested, as the sirens and the vehicles that bore them came closer. Aquamarine swiped his shirt across his face, not really sure if that would reduce the grisliness of his appearance. He didn’t
“Yes. Sorry.” Appropriate punishment. Swift, too. But he was uncomfortable with it. Inexperienced at owning slaves. Did well enough dispensing imperious attitude to other free people, but managing a slave was different.
A large black car was rolling slowly along beside the walk, too slowly, and now it turned sharply to cut Bay off as he tried to cross the street. The back window rolled down to reveal an attractive young woman, who at second glance was wearing a necklace-like jeweled slave collar. This did not give him comfort. “Get in,” she told him.
Magnus clearly hadn’t thought of this. “Yes, an alibi, how novel!” he commented, turning the case sideways to examine the corners. Bay could see how some people—Donovan, for example—might like to assume Magnus was the murderer. Suddenly he stopped messing with the case and turned to stare at Bay owlishly. “You may sit,” he allowed, indicating the other armchair. Magnus was crouched rather precariously on the one Bay had been using before.
“Anthea,” she repeated and he looked over at her again. Her smile was different now, like there was nothing she was allowed to do or say that would help his situation, but she wished it could be otherwise. It was at once comforting and not.
, definitely a lot of science that Aquamarine was ignorant of—chemicals and technology, like Master’s glowing folding thing with buttons that he wasn’t to touch. Master never said
“Bye.” Bay maneuvered himself out of the car and watched it drive away before he limped up to the door, which was labeled 221B. It seemed like a nice neighborhood, though Magnus’s luxury transport would stand out; the sandwich shop would be convenient for meals, if his master allowed it. After surveying the area around him Bay gave the door a determined stare and rang the bell.
would cause his new master to beat him, and the sooner Bay discovered it, the sooner he could avoid it in the future. He preferred his tests to be
“Of course she’s not,” Magnus declared. “She’s from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night… before returning home to Cardiff,” he added with a smug smile, finally looking up from his phone. “So far, so obvious.”
Then John caught sight of Aquamarine, who was digging through a bag and chucking items of no interest over his shoulder, much as Taffy would have done but at least without the drool and teeth marks. “Aquamarine—“ The slave was twisting a blue lace bra around, trying to figure out what it was for.
Location: tent, floor, blankets, pillows, dimly lit but not dark, cool, dry, interior room, good quality, unfurnished, alone.
"Are you going to make any more trouble?" He asked, looking at her. Unlike Joan who was looking around the room, he was merely leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes scrutinizing her suspiciously.
"If you start to feel that I'm going too far, you'll stop me with whatever means necessary. I don't mean to frighten you, this is just a precaution."
"He'll be fine by tomorrow morning," Mycroft said, "He's very lucky you were the one to find him in such a state and not someone else."
"This is not a one sided thing, It's a bond and if we have one, I'm one half of it. Don't you think I deserve to know if I'm a part of a supernatural bond or not?"
She shook her head. "Those two are completely different things. I wouldn't want anyone, including you to be accused of something they haven't done or to be punished for a crime they're innocent of."
The next morning, Joan woke up to the beautiful sound of a violin playing, it was an old classic melody which she was sure she'd heard before but couldn't quite remember. She remained laying on the bed for a bit and wished that the events of the last twelve hours would magically disappear, or turn out to be a horrible nightmare which she would eventually wake up from...
"You're the one who turned him? Into a vampire, I mean," she stated. The words hung in the air as if they would stay there forever.
Joan returned from work at 4:15 P.M the next day. As she stepped into the living room, she saw piles of evidence and papers.
*'Sophia, If you're reading this, it means that you're seeking out my secret which in turn means that I'm dead. So you should know that I've left you all my belongings in my will. You may ask why. To be honest with you, I'm scared; I'm scared of what might happen to you and Emily. Please be very careful. I'm writing this to let you know something very important. There's a poison for vamps like me, a dangerous one. Julia and David are working on an antidote. They've asked me for help. Not everyone wants the antidote to be found, though. And some of these people are very dangerous. And if you're reading this, it means they've got me. Run away, start afresh. Make yourself a new life with Emily somewhere far away from London. You're both very dear to me and always will be. Benjamin '*
He looks at me with a sceptical gaze, he knows something is up but doesn't know what and he hates not knowing.
"What do you exactly want from me? To obey you like a sheep? To spend my entire life locked up in your flat?!"
"The police don't consult amateurs." Suddenly she frowned. "Why would the police even accept help from a civilian?"
"No. I'm going to meet the Venenum. I'll be back in an hour, more or less." He sprang to his feet and moved towards the door but Joan quickly blocked his way.
"Look. I don't know much about companions and bonds. I don't know how it's supposed to be, how it works. I'd never cared about it. But I can tell you one thing."
"Oh. No. We weren't a couple. I had a boyfriend four years ago. Benjamin wasn't really happy about it but as always, he put my happiness before his own. I never told Jackson anything about Benjamin however. I didn't want Benjamin to come into harm because of me. But there was always this fear in his eyes; like he was expecting every single time we met to be the last one and Jackson would hurt me in some way at one point. A year after me and Jackson met, we got engaged and a few months afterwards, I found out that I was pregnant but he wasn't at all pleased to hear it. He said he wasn't ready for a baby yet. But I didn't want an abortion and he got very mad about it so we separated. I was devastated at the time. I thought that I couldn't handle being a single parent so I was going to put the baby up for adoption once she'd be born. Benjamin knew it wasn't what I truly wanted for my child; that I was very scared. He gave me all the support he could. He was a much better father to Emily than her biological father ever would have been. He was ready, eager even to give her his own last name just to make everything easier for me and her, so that she wouldn't feel any different or feel the absence of a father in her life. He adored her and she loved him just as much in return," she explained with a sad tone which made Joan wonder if Sophia would ever recover from this loss.
"But Sophia and Emily need somewhere safe to stay." Joan sighed and affectionately stroked the baby's head who was still asleep in her arms. Sherlock could clearly see that she felt bad for the little girl.
He rolled his eyes. "And what were you doing with your 'life' anyway? You constantly saved the lives of unimportant people who wouldn't even bother to say 'thank you' in return, ate crap hospital food and drank it's horrible coffee on a daily basis and lived alone in a matchbox sized apartment."
Sherlock nodded; "Alright then," he turned to his companion, "Joan, in the meanwhile I want you to talk to Sebastian. He won't tell me anything but maybe you can get him to talk. Any bit of information you can get out of him about the case or about Moriarty might be crucial. I've arranged everything with Mycroft. He will send you a car in a few minutes."
It's awkward between Sherlock and Joan for the next couple of days. Sherlock thinks he never should have fed on her blood, though he knows it's an absurd regret because she was absolutely right about everything that she'd said to him and he'd stopped in the perfect instant and therefore she's perfectly fine.
Nothing criminal happened for another forty five minutes. Joan ordered a lemonade, she needed to be sober and have a clear mind tonight for whatever that was about to happen and she's never been one to drink too much anyway. Sherlock didn't drink anything at all. When she looked up again, a young looking man, dressed in a black suit was walking in through the entrance. He had dark black hair which he'd combed to the back.
Sherlock cursed himself for not nothing it sooner but he was blinded by rage and fear. This definitely wasn't a good time to discuss what had happened as she was sick and there were too many emotions blocking his mind from thinking clearly at the moment as well. They had to postpone their conversation for now.
"Sophia's life is in danger. Sebastian tried to kill her. Tell us everything from the beginning or this will get so much worse. A lot of people died because of him and more still may, including Sofia."
Joan only regained her senses when she noticed Sophia looking at her."I know you think that I'm mad but I don't mind you thinking so. Benjamin didn't deserve to be murdered. He was a good man. Please, don't let his death remain unavenged."
She slowly re-opened her eyes at his words but didn't yet dare to look up at him. "Then what is it that you want from me? Why don't you let me go?"
"It's the formula of the antidote. After Julia and David's deaths, Benjamin was the only one left who had the formula to stop the poison and these killings."
It took Joan a moment to put the pieces together. 'One of my family members turned me.' Sherlock had told her. He was very old (according to himself) and he'd told her that Mycroft was his brother and also a vampire. The only conclusion she could came to was…
"Vampires tend to see themselves superior to their companions so no, it's unusual; except for a few vampires who wish to support and protect their companions financially even after their own death but I don't think Sophia would need Benjamin's money."
He looked away from her."I had no choice. We'd discussed this, Joan. If I set you free, both of us will die. Why can't you see that I had to do it, not only for myself but for you as well?"
"Our bodies don't use much energy, our hearts don't beat and we don't necessarily need to breathe. So we have a lot of energy stored away for when we may have need of it."
He turns to look at her."I found a series of texts on his phone. I have a theory but I need you to confirm it, Sophia."
"I don't see a point of that and therefore don't find it necessary." Oleander's words made him angry, though he didn't know exactly why.
"Thirst makes vampires weak but also mad; it's one of the reasons for the war that had existed before the peace arrangement between our two species. They lose control and they don't really know what they're doing. It's just instinct and reflex, not actions based on thought. When they feed, things change... heighten. They still have control but they tend to act more like a savage animal. They see themselves as superior, common sense and emotions are lost to them to a great extent. They see humans as blood bags, slaves and nothing more. This is when they most tend to go too far and get out of line."
All the vampires vacated the bar almost immediately in the fear that whether their companions or themselves would be the next target. After informing his brother about the matter (who would ensure that no human, not even the police or the press, would be involved with this incident), Sherlock started to analyse the murders on the way back to Baker street.
She sighed; "Alright. You want to talk? Fine. Go ahead. I'm all ears." Joan was still tense but deep down she was also curious to hear what he had to say.
"Benjamin's folder. He used it for work but...  there is a note for me. I think you should read it too though," she said and handed the it over.
"Emoticons blunt my mental abilities. I've chosen to use my intellect to save lives instead of mourning for those that are already lost or worry for those that are in danger."
Now, after God knows how long he'd been wandering the streets, he was on his way back home. It was late so he expected to find Joan asleep but the lights were still on. He walked steadily up the seventeen steps and saw her sipping a cup of coffee in the kitchen.
"Well, then I suppose I should clarify things for you, as much as possible, at least." He walked over to the kitchen and sat down on a chair behind the dinner table.
Sherlock spent that night and the following day gathering data about the case. He was so lost in it that Joan wondered if he's aware of his surroundings at all.
"I have asked the companion of the case's last victim to meet me here. I intend to question her and I'd be glad if you could join me."
What surprised the DI most was when Sherlock introduced her as his 'colleague and flatmate'."Doctor Watson has been kind enough to help me with a few cases lately," Sherlock introduced her as he sat down.
Sherlock texted Sophia and asked her to meet him in half an hour. After she texted back that she would, he dialled Joan's number.
"Are you sure?" Mycroft shot her a doubtful glance. She knew exactly why he was sceptical about this but she didn't care about it. Sherlock would never hurt her, she believed it whole heartedly.
"Don't!" He yelled and reached out to stop her but this sudden movement made him wince in pain and he had to lie down again."Don't do... that," he protested, the words coming out of his mouth in bits and pieces due to the sharp pain and he was breathing in small gasps.
He nodded in confirmation. "It's like an engine, racing out of control, tearing itself to pieces. I can't switch it off and on but I can direct my focus onto something else, put it into a different path."
Joan had her doubts about the contract at first, but it actually made everything easier - except for having to make up an excuse for her absence at work to her boss (flu and a broken phone- which couldn't be considered a complete lie really) - she didn't have much difficulty. Sherlock had returned her handbag and he'd had her stuff brought over from her flat alongside anything else that she might need. She had to clear the fridge to make space for human food in it (and to limit the blood bags to one of the drawers) and she also had to make Sherlock put his books and papers -which were scattered everywhere in the flat- into at least some form of order but none of these changes felt unpleasant to either of them.
These long and quiet walks through London's usually crowded streets have always managed to soothe him somehow and that was one of the many reasons as to why he couldn't bear to live anywhere else. He could feel its beating heart and that made his existence almost bearable.
"What are you going on about?" He asked but was cut off by a slap from Sophia to the side of his face.
It's not easy for either of us; he's been on a mission for my safety and I've been grieving for him for two years. It takes a while for us to become comfortable with each other again, to understand what the other went through and to get back to our normal routine.
Then came the guilt. How could she -a doctor- let a wounded man in need of her help walk away in a state like that?
She looked towards the man and then suddenly everything that had happened earlier came back to her; how she'd been attacked, how this man had come to her aid and what she'd seen afterwards... She jolted up and started to back away from him. "I saw your eyes... They were red and you had... fangs! I saw it while you were fighting with the guy who attacked me. You're not human. I know that. And neither was he. So what are you?!" She backed away further, still keeping her guard up.
He shook his head in disagreement."You see but do not observe. The blood tests showed no sign of alcohol or drugs. The bottles were planted by the murderer to distract the police, even if for a short while, an absurd and childish trick to buy themselves a little bit of time to escape."
"Trust me?" Joan was terrified but she had promised that she would try to trust him and so she nodded. "Good. Now just follow me. It'll be fine," Sherlock walked through the crowd effortlessly and she followed him.
"We've heard some rumours and therefore wanted to discuss them with you face to face," Oleander replied.
The only time I feel a bit of peace is when I'm by his grave. I talk to him, pour my heart out. I beg him to take me along. But I see his answer as if he's standing before me. He would tilt his head to one side, give me a sad smile and then look down.
Where he was going or the fact that he was soaking wet by now didn't really matter to Sherlock. All he cared about was that his head felt less heavy and the gentle breeze in the air and the rain had somewhat cooled down his skin. In London, he never even needed to have an actual destination as he knew the city like the back of his hand. He could simply find his way back when he was ready to return.
He explains everything about that day, how Moriarty had planned to kill me, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson, and how he's spent two years dismantling his web. "I had to do it, for you. There was no other choice. I couldn't -"
"Protection. Not for myself, but for my companion. She was attacked last night by another vampire. I let him get away because I dislike having blood on my hands and he seemed scared and sensible enough not to repeat such a huge mistake ever again but I won't hold myself back if there happens to be a next time."
"I'm surprised Benjamin didn't tell you about him. Our community is small. Everyone knows everyone," Oleander replied.
"Not if I'm careful enough about it, no. Plus, I also take clients and a few private detectives come to me for help as well. Gregson, Lestrade, Jones, Dimmock, Hopkins; they all seek my help, although I don't think Donovan and Anderson like the fact that their boss works with me. I solve whatever mystery that dazzles them."
His body was urging him on to drink it, each cell was screaming and itching with the need for the warm liquid in front of him. He could smell it before and it was already difficult for him to keep his composure around her but now? This was a whole different matter. He wndered if he had ever craved a human's blood more and he couldn't recall having such a strong need before.
"When he confronted me about what happened and I had to tell him about you, he said that's exactly how I'm supposed to feel about my companion. It was as if he'd been expecting this to happen for a while."
Joan knew that there would be a punishment for her later and yet she couldn't help but wonder what it was going to be. Despite her curiosity, she refrained from asking further questions and went upstairs.
Her first instinct was to call an ambulance but Sherlock is a vampire and there's nothing a hospital could do for him. Plus, the night they'd met, he'd refused an ambulance so she dismissed the thought entirely.
He shook his head. "You'd seen what I am. You found out my secret. It's too great a risk to let you just walk away with that: a risk that I can't afford to take."
"It's not my story to tell. It wouldn't be right. I think you should ask him yourself when he wakes up if you really want to find out," he looked at his brother's sleeping form, "Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars. But when you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield. You’ve seen it already, haven’t you?"
Joan, on the other hand, remembered every single detail. How he'd held up her wrist and inhaled. Then his eyes had turned red and she'd seen his fangs come out for the second time. They were sharp, pointy and long. He bit her wrist gently but effectively and she could feel his lips wrap around the wound and suck the blood that was pouring out of it.
Hi! I'm back with a new chapter! This is actually where things really start to get interesting. 🙈 kudos and comments much appreciated. I want to hear what you all think! Hope you enjoy reading my fic 🥰
"I never meant for her to get hurt. I loved her-" he looked at Sophia and continued, "but I wasn't blind. I knew you were cheating on me with him, Sophia."
"Look, as you said you'll be honest with me, I will be honest with you in return. What you're doing to me is worse than death. You took everything I had: my ability to make choices, my job, my life-"
"Benjamin is dead but Sophia is still a part of our community. The Venenum will protect them," Sherlock looked at Oleander who nodded in return.
"I heard you talking to Mycroft, Sherlock. I know you refuse to drink blood because you don't want to hurt me. And I didn't tell you I'd heard you because... how could I?"
Joan's dead body was at the bottom of the grave. Her neck was ripped open and her eyes were shut. The blood had turned her golden hair red and the white nightgown she was wearing was stained with blood almost everywhere.
"You're his companion. The feeling in your gut was your subconscious bond with him, it warns one of you when the other one is in danger. It's an advantage nature grants vampires with companions, a reward of sorts I suppose."
Joan was already halfway home when she heard a loud scream. It wasn't really difficult to find the source; a young man was lying on the ground and squirming in pain. Joan didn't think twice before rushing over to him, her medical instincts had immediately taken over her. Once she was by his side, she could see that his white shirt and both of his hands (which were trying to apply at least some amount of pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding but failing horribly at doing so) were tainted with his own blood which was pouring out of a wound to the left side of his abdomen.
“Oh, there’s a whole other room in the back!” Magnus revealed. “Bathroom, too. Well, traveling is tedious,” he complained. “The transport has so many needs… The body, I mean,” he clarified. “Just transport for the mind. Bloody nuisance sometimes.”
“Oh, about four hours, I think,” Magnus decided. “Sit down. Here. I promised I would get you a drink.”
“Alright.” His master left and he whimpered, involuntary really, he felt dizzy without the anchor of the man’s voice, touch, scent. That was foolish, dangerous, but right now he would cling to anything. Then his master returned, pressing a cup of earthy liquid under his nose. “Drink this, Aquamarine. Come on, drink it.” He drank, messily, suspecting what it was and welcoming it. “Shh, you’ll feel better when you wake up,” his master promised, as an unnatural heaviness suffused his limbs. “Good boy. Good boy, Aquamarine.”
Magnus shook his head, though. “She has a string of lovers and she’s careful about it,” he insisted. “She
Master abruptly put a hand over his eyes and turned his head away. “Don’t stare at the lights,” he ordered. “You’ll hurt your eyes. I’ll show you how they work later.” He removed his hand cautiously and black spots danced in front of Aquamarine’s eyes. “When you’re at the bookstore,” Master added to Irene and Molly, “get him some books. Children’s non-fiction with lots of pictures,” he suggested. Aquamarine was already learning how to read the language Master’s books were written in; Molly was
It was all deliberate—Bay was not fool enough to miss that. But he also knew he couldn’t play mind games with a mad man. So he laid back down, still facing his master who was pretending to ignore him, and closed his eyes.
The kitchen was close to the laundry room, which Bilbo supposed made sense, and connected by a back hallway so he didn’t have to go through the main hall with its ankle-breaking treasure. A month ago Bilbo would not have called an enormous room filled with gold an annoyance, but there you go.
His gaze flickered between Nico’s eyes and his full lips and he moved in slowly, brushing the boy’s mouth lightly with his own. Nico inhaled sharply, but didn’t pull away. Ivan pressed a little more firmly, trying to stay conscious of the mechanics and not get carried away. His tone snaked out and trailed along Nico’s lower lip and his mouth parted slightly; Ivan plunged in. After a moment he felt his shoulder being shoved and he broke off, nuzzling the boy’s jaw and neck while he panted for breath. Forgot about that whole breathing thing, oops.
Since Master was right there, Aquamarine met Irene’s gaze suddenly, boldly, and raked his eyes down her body, immodestly presented in the black lace gown. Wildlings had a reputation for being wild in
“I do seem to heal well,” he conceded, which he didn’t consider much of a concession. Some people just
Aquamarine did not want to obey; he was still mad. Master raised an eyebrow, repeating the command silently.
“The three of them work better as a team,” the salesman explained. His tone tried to make this seem normal, but it finally attracted even Sherlock’s attention. “They were raised together from childhood, like siblings.”
“Her phone, yes,” Bay agreed quickly. “She didn’t leave it at home?” Magnus shook his head quickly. “Perhaps she lost it once she got to London, or it was stolen by someone”—Wrong track again. “—stolen by some unrelated person who found her body first—”
“Aquamarine.” He looked up from contemplating the boots. “Come here.” He scooted closer to Master, ending up between his knees with his arms resting awkwardly on Master’s thighs. Awkward, because he was still feeling resentful, and didn’t want to be this close to him.
,” Magnus tried to explain. Sometimes his explanations did not help much. “A little stray Hobbit who came to my door.” He grinned, or so Bilbo thought; he showed his teeth, anyway, which were enormous. “I feed you and keep you warm and give you nice things, don’t I?”
Magnus bounced up while Bay struggled to his feet in the background. “Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes; I’m guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink,” Magnus judged. “Traveled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It’s obvious from the size of her suitcase.”
Taffy, the little black dog of the house, didn’t like him at first, but that made sense to Aquamarine; he was invading Taffy’s territory, and he was quite a bit larger. But Aquamarine made the appropriate submissive noises and gestures to him and he and Taffy reached an understanding. Then together they chased off an intruder who was trying to put
There was a bowl of water on the floor in the corner, and next to it a bowl of dry brown chunks. Convenient, Aquamarine thought, crawling over to investigate. Master snagged his collar. “No, your food is on the table,” he reminded Aquamarine. “Leave that alone.”
A woman came out from behind the screen, but not Molly. Older, plain clothes, no collar, understandably startled by him. He dropped to his knees quickly and bowed his head, expecting a cuff on the ear for the intrusion.
to Bay. “That must have been interesting.” He seemed to expect a response, and Magnus was just going to let Bay dangle.
Magnus did a double-take, then laughed. Genuine laughter, no undercurrent of menace. “I’ll have your leg fixed up soon, too,” he promised, ridiculously. “Your room’s on the third floor, can’t have you limping up and down the stairs all day. Plus, I need you out with me,” he went on excitedly. “Racing through the streets and alleys of London—oh, I’m a detective, I solve crimes. No committing them this time!” he chuckled madly. “Though of course some people always think I’m on the point of doing so.” He rolled his eyes at this. “Sally, Anderson, Mycroft, Lestrade, all the usual suspects around. But
“The dead woman’s missing suitcase, which you predicted the murderer had accidentally kept,” Bay reiterated, and Magnus nodded. “How, and where, did you find this?”
“People often think it seems simple once I explain it.” Magnus’s tone was dismissive but his eyes strayed back to Bay.
“The Loic never leave their lands,” the boy said suddenly, and everyone turned to look at him. “Not even to help us.” He sounded only slightly bitter.
; she just bought into the stereotype that wildlings were untrustworthy and violent, and owned only by people with dangerous, kinky tastes. Not really something John was comfortable with his mother thinking about, frankly.
Aquamarine stared at him blankly. He seemed so… firm was the word that came to mind. Very matter-of-fact, as though he expected that
“Oh. No, I have to solve this,” Magnus denied after a hesitation. “The police will never get it. I’m a private detective, I told you that.”
Master nodded at Molly, who tugged Aquamarine closer to the Jeep. “Hold still,” she told him, trying to wipe his face with a damp cloth. “I don’t
“Aquamarine!” Molly chastised, putting her hand on his shoulder. He continued to glare at the man, who prudently decided he could take another route wherever he was going. It was rather obvious the man was having a secret affair with a slave owned by either his mother or an aunt, and Aquamarine didn’t want him getting any ideas about anyone from
His name-dropping worked. “Lady Englethorpe?” John repeated in surprise. The—um, the archaeologist’s wife, right? Before that she was the oil baron’s widow—um—”
“You know why he’s here?” she went on suddenly. “He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it.” She was crude, but not amused. “The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what?” Bay just stood there, accepting her rant. “One day just showing up won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Magnus Holmes’ll be the one that put it there.” Bay had a sudden flash that it was
“When we get back to the tent,” Master told them, raising his voice over the wind, “start packing. We’re going home tonight.”
to tell me the white hairs on the murderer’s coat match the victim’s cat, it’s perfectly obvious from a glance there can be no other explanation, given the rest of the evidence.”
“You’ve not taken very good care of him,” the man accused; for a moment Bay thought he was talking to
Aquamarine gave him a quizzical look, but Master declined to explain further—the girls apparently knew what he meant. Their home was somewhere in the West, but Aquamarine didn’t know exactly where yet; surely it wasn’t someplace you could get to in one night, though, especially since it was already after midnight. Some people preferred to travel the desert in the night, under the stars; but it was closer to sunrise than sunset, and they’d all had a long day already. Maybe they were taking a late train or ship.
Fortunately Aquamarine was shaking it off and getting up before John even made it out to him. He plopped back down when he saw John coming, though, sitting flat on the ground as he discovered the shoes made it difficult to kneel comfortably.
“You’re a clever boy, ain’t you?” the man said, his smirk slightly twisted. “Cleverer than all them fancy masters with their shiny boots and loose cash. Well go on then, if you’re so clever. Swallow it down.”
On the final branch Aquamarine lost his footing before he could grab elsewhere with his hands, and he thumped to the ground—only a couple of feet, but still. “No, I’ll go check on him, you stay here,” John told the girls, rising from his seat. This was another one of those times when the slave would
“What’s wrong?” his mother asked intrusively when Aquamarine didn’t move. “Why isn’t he listening to you?” Obviously her mind was going to
“Her coat!” Magnus insisted. “It’s slightly damp. She’s been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London at that time.” Amazingly. “Under her coat collar is damp, too. She’s turned it up against the wind. She’s got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket but it’s dry and unused—not just wind,
This had the opposite effect of what he’d wanted, snapping John out of his daydream. “No, Baker Street is fine,” he said, determined not to be sidetracked further. “We’re going to buy Mrs. Hudson some domestic help and then get out of here. Back to the country,” he specified, just in case.
The contrast with his new master was obvious. Taking everything Magnus had said and done so far at face value, he’d been interested, respectful, considerate, and attentive, in his own eccentric way. Of course, Bay could never take anything at face value. But it was something to think about.
Well that sounded—An image flashed through Bilbo’s mind, of a dark-haired Man with sculpted cheekbones and a dragon’s smirk, racing through the streets of an exotic city, contraptions Bilbo had never seen before dodging and protesting his carelessness. After a moment he came back to himself, a half-eaten egg in his hand, blinking rapidly. He dared to glance over at the dragon, who seemed to have expected this reaction.
to let your man take me—” He broke off, no doubt replaying the scene in his head, searching for evidence.
Worst case, Bay would give the driver his master’s contact information, and the man could bill him. Obviously drivers hated doing that, though; it was one of the main reasons many wouldn’t even stop for lone slaves at all, because it wasn’t uncommon for masters to not trust slaves with money. That, and the somewhat apocryphal fear of being charged with helping a slave’s escape attempt. Masters could be very belligerent sometimes.
“Must keep an eye on the local excitement,” Mr. Holmes replied, feigning boredom. “Especially when it involves a citizen.” He said the last word like it was particularly significant.
slavery in this world? And then the head injury. Bad luck, that.” He stopped suddenly, making Bay stumble, and turned to the slave with a sober expression. “I suppose you’ve had a rough time of it,” he suggested seriously.
“Thank you,” Bay responded again, and shut himself into the small room, drink in hand (no way would he leave that behind). There wasn’t much room—just a toilet to one side of the door and a sink to the other—but it was the first place he’d really been alone for what seemed a long time, and he sagged back against the sink. Just the necessity of being so alert was exhausting, hence why his daydreams or whatever they were held such an addictive quality—he wasn’t sure he actually
It was dark out when he left the transport, the cool, moist air of London washing over him. Had he ever been to London? If Magnus had bothered to study his history he would’ve known Bay had spent years there, at uni and med school. The city held good memories for him, mostly. That might be about to change.
Slowly Aquamarine did so, and John let him sit up. “Those clothes do look rather good on you,” he told the slave, then leaned in close to purr in his ear. “I think they’d look better off, though.” Regaining his cheeky attitude somewhat, Aquamarine raised an eyebrow in challenge, evoking the ’no sex’ rule John had just mentioned. “Sleep in the tent,” John decided, “and maybe I’ll come see you tonight. Now pick up your shoes and socks, and go inside.” No doubt Molly and Irene would love to get him cleaned up before teatime.
As he started to leave the telephone box, however, the phone rang. Maybe Magnus was calling him back already? Bay picked up the receiver gratefully. “Hello?”
“I’ve been neglecting you,” Magnus stated regretfully. “I’m sorry. I just got so caught up in the case—” His eyes strayed to the pink suitcase, then snapped back to Bay. “But that doesn’t matter. Not like
to let them; it was a conscious choice on his part. He didn’t know if his companion really understood that or not.
something—and Master angled his head to look down on him. “Sit up here if you want to eat,” Master encouraged, patting the empty chair next to him. When Aquamarine didn’t move, just stared at him, he shrugged and went back to his own breakfast.
Magnus was playing with his phone. Compulsively unable to keep still, to keep going without some stimulation—boredom would be a problem with this one. It would be on Bay to keep him entertained, then, or risk being discarded. Hard to say at this point if that was better or not.
Magnus watched every movement closely. “How did you get back here?” he asked curiously. “Couldn’t have walked—taxi? Should’ve been faster. You’ve been in a car, a nice one, too nice for the police—” He broke off.
“Oh, for G-d’s sake, if you’re just making this up,” Lestrade accused, and Bay was glad to know someone else was thinking this too, because it rather reminded him of the rambling phrases Magnus had rattled off in the market.
not going to do it,” John denied. Immediately Aquamarine looked to the girls on the porch, who were just waiting for the signal to pay attention to him. “No,” John told him firmly. “You can learn to take them off and put them on yourself. The laces have been tied, see? Irene didn’t even make them very tight.” She’d been unable to see what she was doing at the time, after all. “And, keep them clean,” John added, as Aquamarine picked at the knots. “Don’t track dirt into the house.”
“Yes, sir,” he answered, voice thick with thirst. This was an appropriate answer. “If you like, sir.” This addition was, somehow, verging on cheeky.
. He sniffed at them avidly as they walked into the house. “Tomatoes from Mrs. Rogers,” John announced to his mother. “Yes, you can eat that, but let Mrs. Hudson wash it off first,” he added to Aquamarine. “And wipe your feet.”
“Oh, you gave me quite a turn, young man,” Mrs. Hudson chided him, not severely. “Now you shouldn’t be in here, should you? This is Molly’s room.” She turned his face up to hers. “You are skin and bones, aren’t you?” she tutted. “Here, have a biscuit.” He took it from her and ate it before she could take it back.
The dark-haired man reached out a hand to him and he flinched, closing his eyes, his innate survival instincts not quite dead yet. Instead of a smack, though, he received a caress on the cheek. “Come on, open your eyes,” encouraged a voice, deep and rich and soothing.
to believe this story—like a pauper pretending he was really an abandoned prince. Everyone, slave or free, had difficult times when they dreamed of being magically rescued, or able to escape and effect change in impossible ways. They were fairytales. Maybe they helped you cope sometimes but they were dangerous to rely on, addictive—like the daydreams Bay vanished into. They simply did not stand up to the harsh light of reality.
musicians,” Nico responded, and Ivan smirked. He really shouldn’t let the boy get away with so much. “Thought you were all warriors.” This was not a compliment.
“I thought maybe you and Molly could do some shopping,” he responded, which was exactly what she wanted to hear. The girls started to plan which stores they would visit—the most expensive ones in his mother’s mid-sized city—and John caught her eyes flickering away from him. People had slaves—not everyone, they were a bit of expense and trouble, but they weren’t rare. People didn’t usually let them go on shopping sprees, though, especially slaves like Irene, because that
Magnus ducked his head and Bilbo slid to the ground—he mostly landed on his feet now—then the dragon settled down to stare at Bilbo while he ate. How the food was prepared and conveyed to the table, Bilbo didn’t know; Magnus dismissed his question with “dragon magic.” Same about where the fresh ingredients in the kitchen came from. Dragon magic was only extended for breakfast and supper; other meals and snacks Bilbo prepared himself in the great kitchens. Magnus spent a great deal of time sleeping buried beneath the gold, and liked to stick to his routine.
His mother stepped out onto the deck. “John, they seem to be a bit—excited,” she pointed out nervously.
? Sure, mostly it was children who climbed trees, but he wasn’t bothering anyone. “Are you scared of that noise?” he asked instead, indicating the mower next door.
Another Western stomped over authoritatively, while others rushed to examine the bodies. “John, what the h—l?!” he demanded aggressively, and Aquamarine snarled and tried to lunge at him.
“No, never,” the man assured him contradictorily, with a friendly smile. “Detective Inspector Lestrade, Scotland Yard.”
Obviously he was interrupting Magnus’s text conversation and the man started to walk away, into the other cabin. “No. Forget about it. We’ll get one later.”
“Making sense isn’t the same as being simple,” Bay countered, which seemed to be the right thing to say. “So, you’ve got the case—is there something about it that will lead to the murderer? Were there security cameras near the dumpster, or—”
“Aquamarine?” his master prompted. He was not impatient, just bemused by the long contemplation this question had inspired. “How do you feel?”
“Come closer, please, Aquamarine,” his master repeated, drying his hands on a towel. The ‘please’ was polite, but not pleading.
Magnus set him down by the laundry room, then proceeded to curl up on the floor outside, his head positioned to see straight in. Like watching an insect maintain its nest, Bilbo thought idly. He’d found a book on fabric maintenance in the library and consulted it carefully, as well as his notes, before starting a large pot of water on to boil. Some items he could stir in hot water and soap, and rinse clean; others needed to be sponged and laid out to dry. Eventually he might have to figure out how to make his own clothing, from the bolts of fabric in the treasure hoard. Assuming he lasted that long.
Bay thought he might indeed remember that from the string of nonsensical prattle earlier. “Oh, yes. How exciting.”
? Western medicine was more advanced that the local version, then, Aquamarine decided, which was not exactly surprising.
“Pity, we could have split the fee,” Magnus said seriously. “Think it through next time.” He did at least seem to believe Bay. “He wouldn’t have freed you, you know,” he added more soberly, and Bay nodded along. “Not once he realized—” He tapped his head and Bay somehow knew this referred to his supposed memory loss, or whatever.
“Do you have dreams, though?” Magnus asked him, probingly. “Dreams of other lives, other times and places? Dreams of
“Sorry, excuse me.” Bay interrupted the stream of random nonsense his master was spouting. “Could you slow down a bit, please?” The man had sped up walking as well as talking.
“You’re very bold,” Ivan observed. He would have to go slowly, then, if the memory wasn’t there yet. Otherwise he would never be forgiven. He turned and eased himself down into a chair, wincing as the day’s efforts caught up with him. “Take my boots off.”
When he thought he could stand it he introduced soap and shampoo to the mix. It was agony, but in the way of disinfectant on a wound, where you knew it was doing good. Then he rinsed for a long time, letting his muscles relax as much as he dared.
“Alright, I’ll tell you,” Magnus proposed, again. He paused as if to give Bay time to object, but the slave just looked at him. One of these days he was going to vanish into his mind and never return—maybe that day was coming soon. “You and I are immortal beings of great power, who play out lives over and over in various settings. We have fairly typical childhoods, but then as we become more adult we start to become aware of our powers and memories of previous adventures—and of the pull we feel to find each other. We always want to be together. Oh, and other familiar characters often pop up, like Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.”
What was important to him however was the current inhibitors of the place. Ten ancient vampires inhabited inside this building now, each had adopted the name of a poisonous plant as an alias to hide their true identity… Azalea, Oleander, Aconite, Belladonna, Larkspur and five more which Sherlock never really bothered with. They had been chosen a long time ago to make a very few but essential rules to ensure the safety of the vampire kind and to end the conflict vampires and humans were engaged in. Neither humans nor vampires are happy with chaos, it's one of their rare similarities. Afterwards, these ten vampires were tasked to make sure that the current peace between the two species would maintain, no matter what would happen to guarantee it.
Why would vampires do that? It was a bit odd, unless they wanted humans as pets and… "They use humans as living long-term blood bags." It was a statement, not a question because she didn't even feel the need to question it as she was certain of its truth already.
"You know what? It's actually exactly the right time. Moriarty and his people are extremely dangerous. You can't take them down if you aren't at full capacity. It's plain suicide, Sherlock. We both know it."
"I am so sorry, John. I wish there was another way. I hated the idea too but I had to do it. There was simply no other way. You had to grieve so the world would think me dead and it had to be believable. I never thought it would take this long to come back and I didn't think my loss would affect you so much. If I could save you any other way, I would have." His voice is barely a whisper and he's looking down, just like he had when he'd come back.
"Just the way you hold yourself and your conversation was enough to let me know that you have a military background. The way you examined me when I was attacked showed me that you work in the medical field. You're slightly tanned which shows that you've been abroad but not enough tan for a vacation or sunbath, it's also still visible so you can't have been back for too long either. I think you came back due to a recent injury, most likely on your left shoulder because you're too cautious and self conscious about it. Afghanistan and Iraq are the only two countries in which a british army doctor may get injured like this."
"It's rare. Most vampires wouldn't like it but it's a matter of choice," Sherlock replied, confirming her assumption.
"I know..." She had already disobeyed him once and had suffered for it. She wasn't very keen on repeating such a thing.
Where did Sherlock go? Who texted him? And what will Joan do while he's away? This is gonna be a wild chapter!
"I trust you, Sherlock. As you said, we've been working together for a very long time now. Find whoever is doing this. Bring them to us. Justice will be done and the peace will be restored. This is no joke," Oleander said cautiously.
"I can't trust you like this even if I wan-" She coughed and then sneezed. The cold was getting worse by the minute, her eyelids were heavy and her whole body ached. Her voice had been hoarse too and she was sweating.
"There's something I need your help with. I'll send you the location. Can you be here in thirty minutes?"
"Why do you think there'll be another target at all? Maybe that's all there is and the murderer will just stop."
"You're not well. You can't just walk away and pretend that you're not injured. You're gonna bleed out," She shook her head in protest and tried to ease him onto his back again.
Thank you for reading! As always kudos and nice comments much appreciated. ❤🥰 I hope you enjoyed this chapter
"Alright then. Tell me, Were you expecting something like this to happen to you or were you just taking precautions after the night you were attacked?"
"And you thought that was a good idea? Yes, blood bags may make you feel more like a vampire than a human and yes, you may not be sure if you can stop at the right time if you feed on her. But now you're starving, you were slowly going mad with hunger and I'm not even sure if it's safe to leave you alone with her anymore."
He went over to the kitchen and came back with a food delivery bag and handed it to her. "Here; your breakfast."
"I understand how difficult this situation is for you and it means so much to me that you agreed to this," she smiled.
"Oh, they can but this is extremely rare. He's the only one I've seen with my own eyes so far. I have solid reasons to believe he's the only one alive."
"Of course you are," he rolled his eyes. By now he was used to being watched by Mycroft through the CCTV.  Not that this had stopped annoying him; but nothing could be done about it really so he just generally ignored it. "What do you want then?"
A couple of days later, It was seven P.M when Joan felt well enough to finally leave the bedroom and descend the stairs.
He tells me it's all a trick, that he's a fraud, that he created Moriarty, the most dangerous man on the planet, for his own gain. I don't believe it for a second. I tell him so but he laughs at me through tears. He tells me that I'm to tell everyone about it... his words split my heart in half. How can such an extraordinary man doubt himself? Say something like that about himself? Destroy himself?
"You're not going anywhere unless I allow you to," he said calmly as he got up and slowly walked over to her with steady steps.
"Yes. THE knife. Obviously your security is corrupt," he emphasised as if he's talking to a 3 years old.
"I think the poison might be undetectable, not that anyone would have been looking for it anyhow given the easy solution of alcohol," Sherlock picked up the pictures
Sherlock cleared his throat and John’s attention shifted from the hand on his arm to the other man’s face. There was a look set on his features that he had never seen before, there was a softness to his sharp features that seemed to make him ever more lovely.
“No.” John replied firmly as he tightened his grip on the door knocker, pulling it firmer against the jamb, fearing that it just might be ripped from the door.
Mary had just taken a breath to speak when something caught John’s eye, though he tried not to allow the glimmer of the pristine car to catch his full attention. He did however, watch as the back door slowly opened and out stepped Mycroft, and needless to say, he didn’t look very happy or anything close to it, in fact the look might as well have been classified as murderous,
Thank you everyone for your kind comments on this story. I am sorry it took so long to update and I hope to begin to update regularly.
Usually he would send the photo back to Anthea with orders to have one of his men search a database of photographs for a match,but this time He wanted to it himself. He at least owed that to Sherlock.
The doctor began to stack up his books, placing them into the closest box, placing things that belonged to Mary off to the side on the couch. He was being careless with her objects, though careful enough not to damage them. He turned slightly to toss the novel of hers into the couch, the hard bound bouncing on the couch before falling into the floor. He sighed as he grabbed the last few books of his before making his way to place them in the box before bending down to pick up the book. The pages dragged along gently on the floor as he grasped it by the spine, closing it as he went before placing it on the couch next to the other items of hers when something caught his attention.
"Sherlock, I read your medical file" Mycroft stated, his voice had taken on a soft edge as he spoke the next part. "It says there are previous signs of assault. Why didn't you call me if someone was hurting you?"
Sherlock repeated his ministrations on the other side of his lover’s neck, though this time John tilted his head to the side, allowing for easier access to that expanse of skin.
"Can we not do this now Mycroft?" Sherlock asked as his hands clutched at the blankets covering his body. "Just...please don't make me talk about it right now. Please" Sherlock's voice sounded hallow as he spoke and Mycroft could see the tears in his brother's eyes.
“Probably, love, my leg is beginning to ache a bit.” John replies as he turns his head to place a kiss on Sherlock’s temple. “Thanks for the good game guys, but as you can see, My boyfriend thinks I should probably take a break and I agree.”
His heart pounded against his ribs as he pressed the answer icon on the screen, trying to remember the last time Sherlock had called him.
The heart monitor behind him began to slow down as he looked around and take in the white walls of the hospital room, the monitors he was hooked up to and of course, Mycroft standing next to his bed
John didn't believe a word sherlock said as he shifted his weight slightly before slowly climbing up on the bed. This was the last thing he wanted to do, even for his own life, but there was always the premises that if John didn't fulfill his part of this, the criminal would would just send someone else, someone who wouldn't be kind or considerate to the fact sherlock had never engaged in any type of intercourse before.
"It is not okay." The detective repeated, more to himself than to John who had told it otherwise. It wasn't okay to cry was it? that was all he seemed to do, allow tears to stream down his face. Society had always claimed that a man showing anything resembling emotions was considered weak, but he wasn't was he? John didn't think so, Mycroft didn't think so, Greg didn't think so either...
The kiss was broken as Moriarty's right hand man pulled away, leaving Sherlock panting for breath as he closed his eyes. The feeling of calloused hands running up his sides made his skin crawl and stomach churn. The hands traveling up higher than John's had in his attempt to soothe him. This was being dragged out slowly, for his pain and humiliation and for someone else's pleasure. It seemed as if Moran was inspecting his body with his hands before he finished undressing him.
"You're safe now Sherlock." John said as he watched Sherlock slowly made his way into the kitchen with him. the younger man depositing himself in the chair that he usually occupied while experimenting. "No one is going to hurt you.... we won't let them."
“She said that to you?” He asked Sherlock, the man turning to face them again, he looked tired, worn out the more John looked at him, the way he did after a nightmare.
Sherlock breathes in the dust from the carpet as Moran's thrusts become harder and more erratic as he climbs closer to his climax.
Not to mention John still had a hold of one of Greg's sleeves and It didn't feel right to wake him up.
John slipped into the car seconds after he did, and Mycroft didn’t fail to note the fact that the doctor chose to sit closer to him than his fiancée. Mary didn’t look at either of them as the car pulled away from the curb, and no one spoke as they headed towards the outskirts of the city towards the warehouse he favored for this sort of rendezvous with less than savory individuals. It was the same one that the rest of the web was taken to and questioned in the days that proceeded Sherlock’s rescue, and there was no need to change the location now.
"Greg....over here." John called and Greg lifted his light to see a figure lying on the ground less than ten feet away from him.
Sherlock continued to struggle, trying to pull his hands from Moran's firm grasp. He didn't want to be tied down and if he had to be, he didn't want it to be like this. He did not want to see the face of his attacker as he was being violated. He didn't want to see the joy Moran got from causing him pain and humiliation once again.
He moved methodically as he grabbed clean clothes before walking into the bathroom attached to his room. It wasn't used as much as the one down stairs near Sherlock's bedroom. He preferred that one most days because of the deep tub was perfect for a bath and was big enough that he could stretch out and sink down into the water. But today, that was the last thing he wanted, using that bath meant going down stairs to face Sherlock, and he couldn't do that yet.
He had managed to shower and get himself dressed, hos body unnaturally achy and he was tired from lack of sleep, but Sherlock was determined to be a little more productive than laying on the couch allowing the nightmare from hours before to consume him. Instead he perched himself at the table, his Microscope set up and several dishes of bacteria that had been growing in the petri dishes that Mycroft had provided him were stacked up next to it. His goal was to stay away from the windows with John out doing the shopping, despite the fact that no reporters had come to camp out in front of his front door, no one really needed to see him anyway.
“I just wanted to see how he was doing.” The doctor began. “I know I shouldn’t have said what I did when he was brought in. I blamed him, and it wasn’t his fault, none of this was his fault and I treated him like it was.”
Silence follows as Sherlock slowly unfurls himself enough so that he may sit up just enough for John to slip under him and Sherlock falters slightly as he decides if he should sit up completely or lay down once again.
The lamp on his nightstand stays on. He has no intentions of turning it off either. Afraid that perhaps the monster who ripped him open is hiding in the shadows.
Sherlock rolls his hips first, drawing a low moan from John’s lips as he rolls his own hips in return. The sound and the friction go straight to Sherlock’s cock, which is growing harder with each movement. He leans up to press his lips against John’s, swallowing the sounds he other man makes.
Sherlock moves gingerly to the shower, trying to ignore the pain between his legs that is traveling up his spine. The shower springs to life as he turns on the water and waits until a plume of steam develops before stepping in. The movement makes his body scream as does the hot water. But it's a welcoming feeling.
The officer had followed the instructions Mycroft had send him on his way over and took the lift to the third floor. He spotted the other man almost immediately.
The air is cool and crisp and salty as Sherlock sits upon the beach towel that had been laid out just for him. His long pale legs are stretched out in front of him being warmed and dried by the sun as he hides the rest of his pale body under the large beach umbrella in an attempt to stave off a sun burn.
Sherlock screamed  out in pain as John came deep inside him, his mouth wide open as if the sound was too high for a human to hear. John’s body practically came crashing down on his, the doctor’s chest rising a falling against his back.
He didn’t have an answer for Sherlock’s question either, he didn’t know why they had done this, he didn’t completely understand why Moran had done everything he had done to the man he was holding, but he had told the brunette no one was going to hurt him, and he had failed to do that.
"I-I don't know. Maybe I thought you would make things worse. You aren't the most tactful person, Sherlock and the last thing John needed was someone barking orders to the nurses and asking questions that he's not ready to answer."
In any other situation, John would have refused to be carried like a small child, however he didn't have it in him to argue. Not as Greg began to walk back to his car.
Sherlock find himself leaning into the warmth of Mycroft’s body as he buries his face in the crook of the others neck.
“He is very much dead, he hurt you enough and I would have been damned if he did anything else.” Mycroft stated “In fact I will be damned if anyone else hurts you in the manner he has.”
That was not what Sherlock had been expecting and for a moment everything stopped. John wanted to move back in, he wanted to stay. He looked up at the man standing before him, his hands slowly coming to rest on his lap.
Of course before he could do that, he had to address Mary of course. He still had yet to talk to her, he had spent the last two days avoiding her why he thought of a way to breach the subject. But it didn’t matter how long he thought about it, the end was still going to be messy, more so than the end of his other relationships, but when it came down to it. Sherlock was worth it.
“I can’t do this” Sherlock answered. “I-I can’t do this anymore John.”  Sherlock’s voice broke as he spoke and his breath came out in a huff followed by the sound of muffled sobs.
He was awake now, quickly throwing the blankets to the side as he got out of bed, phone pressed between his shoulders and head, talking as he moved to get dressed.
The sound of his mobile vibrating against his nightstand startled Sherlock awake and it took a few seconds for his sleep muddled mind to realize what was making the buzzing noise.
Sherlock stands under the hot spray with his eyes closed for a moment, allowing the hot beads of water turn his alabaster skin pink. After what seems like forever he opens his eyes and sets grabs the flannel he leaves on the shelf and his soap and gets to work scrubbing his skin. He works the flannel into a lather before dragging it across his skin, the scent if the soap washing over his senses, drowning the smell of blood, sex, John, and Moran. It provides a momentary comfort.
The maliciousness is his voice made Sherlock's blood run cold, and the moment of stillness gave way to struggle as the detective attempted to throw the other man off of him. He thrashed around to the best of his ability, ignoring the pain in his lower body in an attempt to rid him of the weight holding him down. But it was no use as Moran dug his knees into his side and gripped his wrists painfully together, moving them to one hand as he reached for the rope with the other.
John looked up at Sherlock for any kind of defense but it was obvious he had silently handed his matter off to Mycroft as he leaned against the wall by the fireplace. His arms had wrapped themselves around his torso and his looked down at the ground, his eyes half closed as he tried to fight off the exhaustion that was slowly creeping into his body. So instead he just nodded and took his leave as Mycroft got up from his chair, and as John made his way down the stairs he could hear the older Holmes say.
Sherlock has stripped off his suit Jacket and the sleeves to his powder blue shirt has been rolled up to his elbows. He is uncharacteristically silent, undoubtibly berating himself for the fact John is bleeding.
Sherlock sighed and drummed his fingers on his violin for a moment before standing “Now all there is is for me to clean up the mess with the media.” Disappointment and anxiety colored his voice as he set his instrument on its stand, his back to Mycroft. “I supposed it was going to happen sometime.”
Carefully he folded the paper in half once and then twice before sliding it into his back pocket as he headed for the door, he didn’t want to think of the implications of what the paper meant, at least not at the moment.
It had taken him less than ten minutes to get to the garage and his waiting car, and it took even less time to have a few of his people get the warehouse he used for questioning ready, just in case.
Sherlock’s good hand clutches at the blanket and Mycroft slowly pushes himself to stand as he notices the action.
“Has he been staying over frequently?” The answer to that question was yes of course, but had Sherlock known he would have sent John home, regardless if it made him feel vulnerable, He didn’t want to come between anyone, especially not with someone like Mary, who had obviously won the heart of John while he was away.
Perhaps he should have called the paramedics or maybe Sherlock. But that was the farthest thing from his mind as he opened the door to the back seat of his car and placed the man in his arms on the seat as gently as he could before sliding back into the drivers seat.
"Sherlock. Sherlock. You're alright." Mycroft's voice was urgent even in the soothing tone it had taken on. "You're safe, Sherlock. Safe."
He began to curse at himself as his body responded to the stimulation, Sherlock’s mind supplied that his erection was due to a  physiological response, but it did not stop the humiliation at the fact his body was responding. His hands curled tighter into fists, his nails digging into his skin as he whimpered.
"The nurse said you would be going home today " Greg stated, breaking the silence.  "I called Sherlock to bring you some clothes."
Sherlock turned into the room, squeezing in past the nurse who was still in the door to get to John.
“There is an entire cushion down there that is empty John.” Sherlock’s voice came out muffled and lacked the usual bite he would have expected.
“I’ll be there soon, Alright Sherlock? I’ll be there in fifteen minutes.” Mycroft said and he could hear Sherlock hum before the line went dead. The government official dressed quickly, grabbed his coat and a few files before heading down stairs. It was too early for any of his staff to be up, but it wasn’t like he couldn’t drive himself to his brother’s flat.
The pace of John’s thrusts were becoming more rapid and the gentle rhythm he had begun with was slowly being abandoned. The grip on his hips was tightening and he could feel John’s nails scrape his skin as they dug into his flesh. Sherlock moaned out and the way he sounded it may of well as been mistaken for pleasure but this was anything but, his insides burned and pain raced up his spine and down his thighs.
She had plans to put distance between John and Sherlock, at least enough to make the latter an easier and more vulnerable target, one that would be relatively easy for anyone who had an issue with the Great detective to take him out. Though she never intended to slip up and mention that John had left a note about his whereabouts, nevertheless, that no longer mattered as she made her way down Baker Street, taking her time, observing her surroundings to make sure no one would notice where she was headed as she passed Speedy’s and began to ascended the steps to the street door of Baker Street. It was that time of day that John should be at work and even if anyone noticed her entry, it wouldn’t cross their mind as suspicious, he was known for taking client’s and the most recent headline that accompanied his face on the paper was one in regards to going back to his lively hood, how much easier could it be?
But until then Mycroft knows its the medication and the anesthesia running their course provides Sherlock with the dreamless sort of sleep he needs to begin healing, and Sherlocks recovery is all that matters to him.Next to catching his abuser.
“I only went out to see if I could do it.” Sherlock mumbled and John stepped closer pausing to see if the dark haired man would stop him before he continued into his space. Sherlock was focusing on John’s face as he came closer, trying to read the expressions on his friends face.
A look of horror crossed Sherlock's face at his vocalization of pleasure while Moran grinned evilly and leaned in closer, his mouth millimeters away from the detective's ear.
"Why didn't you call me last night when he was brought in?" Sherlock asked, his gazed focused on the wall ahead of him.
“I am trying to prep you for the less amount of internal damage.” John hissed. “I doubt you want to go to the hospital from here and explain that your best friend ra-”
"Mycroft Holmes." he answered half asleep as he tied to wake himself up, though that didn’t take long as a voice he didn’t expect to hear come through the line.
“Get me the number to the clinic, I want to have a nice long chat with the director, I want them to know that this means for their dim future.” He stated as he tossed the paper down onto his desk as Anthea left. The older Holmes sighed and closed his eyes, leaning back into his chair, allowing his mind to wander to the ways he was going to make the clinic and the person was at fault pay for this misdeed. It wouldn’t be as painful as those who set Sherlock up to be kidnapped, tortured, and raped by Moran, but it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park either.
As Sherlock closed his eyes, he decided he would tell John if he was still there in the morning and if he still wanted to know.
Mycroft wasted no time examining the footage that Anthea had found. It was the lead he had been looking for. He had determined the man leaving his brother's flat was indeed the man who had attacked him, given he was the last person to enter and exit after John had left and before he had returned.
A scream ripped through his throat as Moran continued to shove himself into Sherlock body. It felt as if he was being ripped in half, and Sherlock was certain he felt something tear before Moran was fully sheathed inside of him.
“Sherlock.” Greg said softly as he stood in the gap between the door and car body. “If you need anything, anything at all, don’t hesitate to call okay?”
“He looked like him.” Sherlock breathed “He looked like him… and I know it can’t be him because he’s dead…he’s dead My. I know he is because you killed him.” The detective’s voice was strained as he spoke, as if he wanted to cry. The government official leaned forward slightly, his hands coming up to grasp his brother’s face gently.
Being the British government meant that Mycroft was use to his phone going off at all hours, so waking up to the sound of his mobile going off at three in the morning was somewhat normal. The reached over to his night stand, hand patting for his phone before being able to grab it. Still half asleep, he didn't look to see who it was before he answered.
Sherlock shifted his focus once more, shoving down the panic as he gathered his words and found his voice to speak.
Sherlock had promised to take care of him after they had apprehended the suspects and John had not argued. he hated hospitals and he dd not want to go to one when he could be cared for at home.
Sherlock is up the stairs and in the bathroom before John has finished paying for the cab. He's tired, sore, and humiliated. He can smell Moran on his clothes and body and he can feel his hands gripping his hips
Behind him John shuffled around the kitchen grabbing mugs and opening tea packets allowing them to steep as he made his way down stairs to get the paper that was laying on the stoop. It was a somewhat normal morning that made him feel like he had before he had fallen, but even that was bound to change before he dressed for the day.
The Doctor sighed as they sat on the floor, the contents of the desk scattered around them, under them too, but that didn’t matter as Sherlock gripped onto his jacket, the material scrunched into his hands in a death grip as he tried to calm his breathing. The detective’s forehead rested in the crook of his neck, he hadn’t expected the taller man to go down like a bag of bricks when he had wrapped his arms around his waist, but it was better than him lashing out.
Greg had been sitting at the table he and John had been sharing a fee drinks at, finishing the Coke he had ordered when his phone rang.
The officer looked up towards the door as he heard it creak open, to find Mycroft stepping out with Sherlock not that far behind him. It was strange to see Sherlock so subdued, trying to make himself smaller in order to fit behind the older man as he walked towards his car. But he attributed that to the fact that there were people who wanted to talk to him, ask questions, and the like. He and Mycroft exchanged looks through the glass, the ones you see in those movies were the parents are divorced and share custody and no ill feelings towards one another, as Sherlock made his way to the car.
both of them are silent as Sherlock threads the needle before tilting John’s head back slightly to get better light.
Sherlock replied with a nod as he got out of the vehicle to open the street door while Greg got out to help John from the back seat.
“So does this mean…?” Sherlock asked as he leaned forward slightly, he left the question open, as if he could not bring himself to say it, like he did when he was child and asking for reassurance.
“Sherlock?” The detective’s head snapped up looking from Mycroft to where John had stepped closer while he had retreated inside his own head. They were both looking at him, different looks on their faces for different reasons. Mycroft’s was one of concern, it wasn’t really like him to vanish inside his head like this, and John looked livid and conflicted. More likely at the person who had told him he as a bother than the fact he had said anything.
"Just get on with it." Sherlock grounds out as the hands are removed before fingers are trailing down his crack, wet and slippery before one is circling his entrance. It becomes apparent that whatever John has is a lubricant, and he is thankful that at least Moriarty had the decency to provide something to make this violation of his person easier.
There was a pause as Mycroft dug out some of the better looking mugs he had as Sherlock thought of a way to word his question.
Mycroft’s eyes followed Mary as she slowly slipped into the car, watching until she vanished into the interior before turning his attention back to the building, his eyes flicking up towards the window, to find the space now occupied. Sherlock stared down at the scene from behind the sheer curtains, the fabric skewing his face, making it difficult for Mycroft to deduce anything about his current state. It seemed as if he and his little brother stood there for hours having this sort of staring contest, but it was no more than a few seconds before Sherlock backed away from the glass, leaving the space empty once more.
He stops scrubbing when his shoulders began to ache and the water began to run cold and it's no longer a choice. Sherlock shuts off the water before he begins to shiver and steps out of the shower carefully, telling himself the pain is from his shower and not from the rape.
What was Mycroft doing there? He had been away for months for work. He had to be dead. There was No way it could be his brother.
“There is something you’ve left out isn’t there, Doctor Watson? I didn’t see it before, but I see it now. The guilt weighing you down and the comment you made the last time we met. You know something and yet you don’t want anyone to know about it, Why?”
John was warm and soft and safe, though he wasn’t as safe as Mycroft was, Sherlock’s mind supplied as he breathed in the doctors scent. The doctor was that safety one would associate with being wrapped up in a large blanket, one that soothed and assured that nothing else could go wrong, while his brother was just this force that had been there his entire life that always seemed willing to move mountains to make sure no one hurt him, no matter how often they were at each other’s throats like rabid dogs.
The doctor's shaking hands grasped Sherlock's hips gently slowly bringing them up, making the taller man shuffle onto his knees. Bringing his body a sort of doggy style position.  John,s heart was pounding as he began to feel slightly sick. He could feel sherlock tense as he reached around to undo the detective's trousers. It wasn't like he hadn't thought about being intimate with Sherlock, though this was the last way he wanted to do it. He wanted to take Sherlock properly, prepare him like he should, not be limited to a poor excuse for a bed and the two foil packets of lube Moriarty had handed him before telling him what he expected.
“I promise no one else is going to hurt you.” Mycroft found himself repeating to his brother until he felt the tension leave Sherlock’s body
“I realize I never told you that I reciprocate your feelings.” Sherlock said softly. “I think I was too much in shock to say anything, but I love you”
His room provided some comfort and security as he searched for something to dress himself in, finding his sweats, a t shirt and a thick dressing gown enough for now.
"Here you boys are" the officer announced as he pulled up to the curb in front of baker street. "Sherlock why don't you open the door while I help John out of the car?"
Greg never liked hospitals for obvious reasons: the way they smelled, the death, illness, and tragedy. There was enough of that on the job without him having to go visit it. Though over the years there where exceptions. When he had no choice but to push that dislike behind him and walk through the automatic doors.
“You know it’s okay to cry.” John stated as he watched Sherlock from his chair, the detectives back was straight and stiff as he looked out the window. He wasn’t allowed to get any closer to the other man, the brunette had made that perfectly clear when he attempted an hour earlier, He knew the taller man was hurting, it was written all over his body and John couldn’t blame him, how could he? How could he blame Sherlock for being human?
The blonde man was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed in the oatmeal colored jumper and jeans Sherlock had brought. John's eyes were focused on the ground, hands clutching the mattress as if he was in pain.
Sherlock shifted in his Chair, bringing his knees to his chest so he could rest his head upon them as he stared at the fridge. The sinking feeling in his chest returning as he tightened his grip around his legs as he wished things were different, he wished John was there was there even though he had sent him away, he wished he had never jumped off the top of Bart’s to fake his death, he honestly wished he had been more careful when he had returned, because if he had been then maybe Moran wouldn’t have been able to take him. Maybe if none of that had happened things would be normal, John would be there, he would still have to deal with Moriarty but at least then he would feel like himself and he wouldn’t be afraid of sleeping or what was hiding in his dreams.
"I think I see a car across the way..." John had mumbled and Greg knew that John must see him as he pulled in front of the tea shop.
He wishes Mycroft was there, but he doesn't dare call him. He's been away for weeks now on business. Attempting to fix the mess some country has gotten itself into. He doesn't want to be a bother. Instead he will sit and pretend everything is fine. He has to.
“Sherlock why on earth would you think that you are standing in the way of anyone’s life?” Mycroft asked
“Oh you will soon enough, Ms. Morstan, now are you going to get in the car willingly, or am I going to have to make you?”
John finds himself perched on Sherlock’s stool. His head is throbbing with each beat of his heart and he can feel the blood still trickle down he side of his face no matter how hard he pressed the gauze to the wound just beloe his hairline.
Sherlock leaned against the cool glass, looking down at those were passing by his flat, his eyes following every other person for no other reason than for something to focus on, from below a few people looked up to see him there, and there was something written on their faces that he didn’t particularly like, however, he had no idea what would cause them to look rather… joyous was it... to see him.
“I’m fine.” He answered as John stopped in front of him, a hand reaching out to cup his face, stopping just a few millimeters away from his skin and Sherlock leaned in. John’s scent was just as reassuring as the warm hand that touched his face, and for the moment, the detective was more than willing to overlook the hints of old oil, dirt, Clair de la lune, and the leather interior of his brother’s car. “No, no one hurt me… just shaken.”
Moriarty smiled to himself as he leaned back in his chair as he watched the display before him, only looking away as the door opened, his right hand man, Sebastian Moran entering with the files he had requested. The sniper moved to hand the files to his boss, hardly paying attention to what was transpiring behind the one way mirror until a scream grabbed his attention. His eyes flicked towards the glass and a smile tugged at his lips at the sight
There was a silence that followed, one that was full of questions and a feeling of shame and guilt as Sherlock realized John had seen his scars. Now he wishes he had pulled on a shirt before he had gone to bed, though he had never really thought John would come to find him like this.
Mycroft sighed as he stepped out of the black car that had been sitting in front of his brother’s flat for the better part of ten minutes. He had been sending messages to the handful of men that had made sure everything regarding Moriarty and Mary had been dealt with.
The younger man sighed and shifted in his seat, a few of his joints popping as he did so, earning him a glance from the detective, under any other circumstance he would have expected an amused look and maybe a mumbling of 'old man' thrown his way. However he assumed this was the result of being held captive had on his joints. He wasn’t that old, not really, he was only thirty seven and there was no history of arthritis in his family. Sherlock didn’t say anything as he looked back down at his stack of work. Greg had stopped writing and his posture had change and he had cleared his throat as if he was going to speak, but what he was going to say ever crossed his lips as someone knocked on his door.
He jolted awake and exhaled in relief when he saw Joan standing safe and sound by his armchair. "Joan..." he breathed out.
"There's only one explanation. Benjamin had something that Sebastian wants but he wasn't sure that Benjamin still had it in his possession until after the first murder. He might have thought that Benjamin had handed it over to someone else. Then Benjamin left everything to Sophia so he wanted her to have whatever it was, he felt threatened but he didn't know where it would lead so he didn't tell her anything. Then he left everything, rather than just that one specific thing to her so that she could figure it out but only if there was a need. Sebastian went to the house to take what he wanted before Sophia could figure things out but he was caught red-handed."
