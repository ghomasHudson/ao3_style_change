John Watson had become better in concealing his emotions, in acting, but never good enough for her. She caught the loathing in her eyes every time the doctor looked at her. His hand had been perfectly calm.

He has only been here for one day, and already hates it. It is too cold, their kingdom is far more in the north than the Holmes’s land, the earth here is frozen here and the Watson’s are not very talkative, but like to drink and fight. For the wedding they invited dozens of guests, and the only number had only doubled for the feast. Around two hundred people sit at three long tables and shove food into their mouths. Someone is thinking in a terrible tune.
“I miss you so much.” Sherlock whispers into the darkness of his bedroom. “I really want to kiss you.”
This was it.
! You deserve a treat today.
“I’m looking for them at the hospitals.
He did not even struggle. Sherlock had just accepted his death, like a sentence he pleaded guilty of. He had trusted his best friend not to hurt him till the bitter end. How dare John Watson destroy something so beautiful.

Sherlock and John have to face the consequences of what happened during the last night, and Sherlock fears he will have to leave Hogwarts, forever this time. Additionally, there is also the unaddressed romantic tension which both of them feel clearly...

A bathtub is a wonderful place to be, whether it is on a quiet Sunday evening or after a long, hard day at work. It can be a place of relaxation, with soft music in the background, or a place of heavy kissing and petting.

John looked surprised (and maybe relived?):
I already finished my book.

“John, let me in.” Sherlock demands, growing fed-up with waiting.
“Excuse me.
He was falling endlessly. John caught him. Again he wrapped his arms around him and pushed him up. His lips were moving without a pause, and Sherlock wished he could understand him but there seemed to be water in his ears. It took several minutes for him to regain his composure. Everything felt so surreal. Did he really get that lucky again? It looked like that. John was rubbing his back and had pressed his face into his stomach, hiding his face.
The boy raised his (also golden) eyebrow.
Well.
I’m sorry, Professor Watson.
Everyone started laughing, and Sherlock felt like eleven again, sitting in that empty train wagon, utterly alone, scared for what would happen. Until the door opened and a twelve-year old blond boy asked if he could join him.

For some mysterious reason Sherlock needed this boy to know that.

Sixth, he loves Sherlock. He has at least since the first confrontation with James Moriarty at the pool. He has mourned him like a widower after his faked suicide. John came back to life when Sherlock returned to London. John is so deeply in love with Sherlock, he would without question throw himself into the path of every bullet. He wants to spend the rest of his life with the detective.
She twitters happily.
She chirps and plunges a needle in his forearm. Sherlock grits his teeth in pain, but doesn’t move so the needle won’t break. His vision soon begins to waiver while the car is moving along the main road. Where to?
The children in the orphanage were kept busy with trying to mob the wet floor, while a few nurses were parading around them. His little brother was wearing a dark coat, that was way too long for him, and trousers with holes over his knees. Sherlock was trying his best, but his thin arms were not fast enough in their washing movements. He had managed to fill a bucket with water and stood up to bring it out into the white storm outside. Maybe the brace around his leg had been too short or it was stolen, because his weak right leg was now entirely unsupported. He slipped on the floor, his right leg gave out under him, and he fell down hard. The bucket partly drenched him, the rest landed on the floor.

comes with the job.
They reached their destination and stopped at a shop that sold meat. The market was thankfully rather deserted on this time of day, and only a few customers were walking around. Sherlock noticed a pregnant woman with long red hair. This colour was hardly seen in Rome, but Sherlock could not see any markings of a slave. Maybe a wealthy Roman had found her and brought her to the capital?
There is of course Mrs. Martha Hudson, the proud owner of the store, bookworm and baking enthusiast. After her return from Florida, about 30 years ago, she used the money she got from the divorce to buy the house (back then, central London was still somewhat affordable) and uses it for the store and the café, her flat and a flat above to rent it to tenants. She is in her mid-sixties, loves to dye her hair and gossip about the neighbours. She used to be a dancer and sometimes, during cleaning, you can still catch her showing off her exotic dancing. Most of the time in the store, she provides the customers with hot beverages, cookies, muffins and sometimes pizza. Mrs. Hudson loves to read cookbooks, especially the grand volume by Julia Child and also all the classics, favouring Jane Austen.
“If that's okay,” John said quietly.
“Yeah,” John agreed.
“I thought you should sleep in,” Sherlock replied, looking bashful himself. “I thought I'd be helping you by looking after her this morning. I didn't mean to worry you.”
Eleanor stared up at Sherlock with her wide blue eyes. She didn't seem all that concerned to be held by a stranger, not when she still had her blanket to suck on.
Without warning, he threw the remains of his fish and chips from his lap and awkwardly grabbed Sherlock's face and kissed him. Sherlock tasted like wine and grease and vinegar and ketchup. It wasn't a pleasant taste, but he didn't care.
“How's Mary?” Sherlock slowly asked, treading carefully. Something about Mary was bothering John. That was why he was here at midnight instead of snuggled up in bed with her. John had work the next day (he worked weekdays) and for him to be out this late was unusual.
John saw a tiled ceiling with florescent lights. Around him he smelled disinfectant. Beneath him was a hard mattress and on him was a scratchy blanket. When the lights became too bright he closed his eyes and listening to what was happening around him.
The flat grew a bit brighter.
The doctor gently pressed the damp cloth to the torn skin. Sherlock hissed in pain as John pulled his hand back from the sore spot. “Sorry.”
“No, it's just that...” John trailed off again. “The house is pretty big...y'know with just Rosie and me. A bit empty. And she's here often enough as is and unless Mrs Hudson was thinking about renting out my old room here...I was just thinking maybe we could...um...move in.”
“John?”
Sherlock laughed. “Do you know what happened to you?”
John made a few notes in his book. She had the training, certainly, but maybe not the experience. But Rosie seemed to love her already. Sherlock kept his notebook blank.
Sherlock waited for John to continue, but John had fallen into a deep sleep. The best sleep he had in ages.
“I needed help with the case.” Sherlock sat opposite his brother, sitting up straight, shoulders rolled back.
Sherlock did his best to ignore John's comments. “We're done here. I'm calling you a cab,” he said as he held the phone to his ear and listened to the boring dial tone.
John kept his eyes on Sherlock. “Yeah?”
John took the ring from the box and slid it onto his finger. “Yes, yes you idiot of course I'll marry you.”
“It's not?” Sherlock struggled to hide his excitement. Maybe Rosie would stay in his care after all.
“Sir, I need you to calm down. I understand you're upset but – ack! Laura, call security.”
The fic didn't get forgotten or anything, I've just been very busy with schoolwork but now that school is done* I should hopefully be updating on a weekly basis again.
“See, I had a feeling you'd say that,” John said. “Well actually I thought you'd call all babysitters idiots. But taking that into consideration, we'd have to hold interviews. Get a feel at who's qualified, who we can trust.”
"John Watson, you are the most -- what I mean is you're my closest friend. And my companion. And my partner. And lover. And--"
“No.” All that time and money going into just one day didn't make sense to him. There was too much expectation for the day to go perfectly when in reality that wasn't possible. And then what happens after the wedding? Nothing. It's as if nothing had happened so why spend all that time and money for one day? “They're pointless.” But for whatever reason he wanted to marry John. Sherlock actually wanted to have a ceremony and exchange rings and vows and kiss and dance and eat cake and get hopelessly drunk.
Sherlock didn't even give his brother time to close the door before interrupting him: “I'm not going home. I'm staying here until he wakes.”
Barney's
“What's the occasion?”
Molly nodded. “The other day I came by with flowers,” she said. “Because... I'm not sure what else you bring to someone who was dead but now isn't. I thought flowers would be safe. And I spoke to Mary, but come to think of it, John never even came to the door.”
There were no signs of weapons in the room, or anything that could be useful to his search for John. No clues, nothing out of place. The room was tidy as it had always been, with the bed made, pillows fluffed and laptop tucked neatly under the bed. Lestrade preferred to keep his laptop
Getting a pint with Greg was becoming customary. Greg would have a pint or two and just unwind from a stressful week. John used to do that, but now he seemed to knock back the pints and almost always left the pub a bit wobbly.
Molly stared at the phone for some time. “You and John were dating after Mary died?” she asked quietly, handing the phone back.
The main door to the flat opened and closed with a slam. Rosie became suddenly alert and turned her head to the direction of the noise. “Who's that?” Sherlock cooed. Rosie gurgled. Footsteps came up the old staircase. “Who's that?” Sherlock said again and Rosie started to wriggle with excitement.
“I am.”
And just like that, things went back to normal, as if those past few months didn't happen. John was with Mary and Sherlock was with no one.
“Hmm?”
Lestrade shrugged. “She's clever. Really clever. Don't you think she'd have some people working for her? Have a plan in case she got arrested? Can't see how that'd solve anything or keep John safe.”
“Just wanted a night out. Just the two of us.”
“Did you bring condoms?”
“See you tomorrow, I guess,” John said quietly. The train due to take them home was leaving early the next day. John wasn't looking forward to stuffing down a continental breakfast before racing to the train station.
“How'd you talk John into letting her come?” Greg followed him to the house.
A sudden chorus of sirens sounded. John felt a wave of relief – he was going to be saved. Sherlock and Lestrade and whoever else would take that woman wielding a weapon and lock her up for good. And John would go home and it would be as if nothing happened.
"I didn't mean now," John muttered.
When he was sure Eleanor was in securely, he stood up, careful not to swing the carrier too much as he moved. “We should get going. Before she gets hungry.” John made his way to the door and looked back to Sherlock's chair, expecting him to still be seated there. But to his surprise, Sherlock was standing directly behind him.
John pulled away when the shirt got caught over Sherlock's head and he stood up from the sofa. “Come here,” he muttered as he left that floor and went up the stairs to his old room.
In the meantime, Sherlock was in the process of thinking up a new way to trick Mary into revealing her plans.
John was adamant to leave the hospital as soon as he awoke. The nurses had to practically tie him down in bed to make him stay so he could properly recover. And when he was able to leave, he immediately went back home to 221B.
Small cut. Can you take a look at it? SH
Sherlock didn't reply.
“A formal dinner will do. Somewhere nice. I can help with the reservations. Then, when the timing is just right, go down on one knee and ask him.”
Mycroft nodded, not bothering to hide his smug smile. Right again. “And have you asked him?”
my car.” Sherlock ignored him. “Couldn't believe I had done that! I tried to break into my own car and probably looked like an idiot in front of everyone.” Sherlock kept his gaze to the ground. Greg kept on rambling, not caring whether or not Sherlock paid any attention to him. What he wanted was to just visit Sherlock, to just let him know he wasn't as alone as he thought. That if he wasn't so stubborn, he could reach out for help and someone would take his hand. Sherlock didn't seem touched by the sudden visit, but Sherlock rarely looked appreciative over anything. “Did I mention I got a cat? Well I'm babysitting a cat. My sister's gonna be out of town for some time and she wanted me to look after it. I'm not much of a cat person, but I don't mind this guy. We keep to ourselves and I like that...”
“I'm not mad, you know,” John said, breaking the silence. Sherlock didn't reply and instead thought about how he could defuse John. “I'm really not.” Despite it all, John was smiling. “I should have known better. I should have known you wouldn't stay away from cases.”
Sherlock then went for Lestrade's email account. The password was again, Barney's and he was let in without any trouble. From there it was a quick search through contacts to find an officer – friend or colleague – who would prove to be more useful than Lestrade.
Sherlock didn't reply.
Somehow, the stranger in the back of the cruiser persuaded Lestrade to let him sleep on the sofa that night. And the following night. And the following months.
“John?”
“Of course.” Sherlock stood by John and ran his fingers through Rosie's hair. They stood close to each other for a few moments until Sherlock made an observation. “You're still wearing your wedding ring.”
John sighed through his nose, giving Sherlock that judgemental look he never realised he missed until now. That look where John's brow grew heavier and the bags under his eyes grew darker as he wore an expression of mock-disappointment. Mock-disappointment. Because his eyes gave it all a way. Those dark blue eyes still had some light in them, some degree of caring. Those eyes that held back a smile because that's what Sherlock – his Sherlock – did best: get himself torn up so his doctor would have to mend him. And John didn't mind being his doctor for one moment.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft from his spot on the chair. Mycroft knew the answer, he obviously knew the answer and he still wanted to tease it out of his brother. The clock on the wall tick-tocked away, but Sherlock didn't pay attention to how many seconds had gone by. They sat in silence, Sherlock too proud to speak, and Mycroft enjoying the sight of his brother squirming like that. Finally Sherlock grew impatient and broke his silence:
John spent the evening alone flicking through the four television stations. Finally, he settled on the one that wasn't in English – it looked like some sort of soap opera and he could vaguely follow the plot. John glanced at his laptop that was still in its bag and wondered if he should video call Mary. The thought didn't last long and he went back to watching television.
“How did you find me?” Eurus still had the gun trained on John as she frowned dramatically. “I thought I was being clever.”
“What?”
“Did you say anything? Did you... tell me anything?”
Sherlock stared at the floor in front of him, finding it impossible to focus. The world around him became blurry and started to slowly spin. For a moment he felt nauseous and was certain he would be sick, but his stomach soon settled. Sherlock's own pulse rang in his ears, a fast but steady rhythm.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked and John sat up straight.
“I...” John shook his head. “I'll see you later,” he said again before leaving.
“Lestrade.”
“Hmm. And how's Mary?”
They were watching some game show together. John was growing tired and stifled another yawn. Since he came home, he had been sleepier than before. “Can I tell you something?”
“I thought that was already established.”
“No.”
“She needs her nappy changed,” he said bashfully. “Mind if I --?” In her carrier was her changing mat and an extra nappy.
Sherlock didn't expect to find John at Baker Street at this hour. Surprised, he let his old flatmate in, taking note of his slurred speech and wobbly gait.
“Fell on broken glass?”
“Mine too.”
Greg shoved his hands into his coat pockets. The poor DI had dealt with Sherlock for years upon years. Had to tolerate his quick insults and ever-changing mood. Had to look after him when he was homeless and high. There was a long history of Greg tolerating Sherlock, but this crossed a line. “Either you willingly walk out with Rosie or I'll get an officer to escort you out.” Greg hated having to threaten Sherlock like that, but he thought it had to be done. John would be absolutely livid if he found out Lestrade let Rosie stay at crime scene. “I'm serious. I won't have Rosie here, do you understand? Now get her back home before someone calls child services.” John would be even more livid if he had to pick his daughter up from the authorities.
“And I think I heard you. I remember hearing you.”
Sherlock slammed the laptop closed.
Mycroft ignored the question, his eyes on John. “What possessed you to take a case the night you planned to propose to him? I take it you didn't propose to him. Waited until the last minute and now there's no longer a last minute to wait for.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* * * *
“Hello?”
“I believe I thanked you for that already.”
Sherlock assumed he was experiencing sleep paralysis. It was early morning when he was beginning to wake up and he felt something heavy on his chest. Something that squeezed the air out of his lungs. When he opened his eyes, he saw a figure above him, sitting on his chest. It was in shadow as the sun was still rising and a curtain hung at the nearby window, blocking out most of the outside light. But the figure slowly came into focus. Even in the dark, he started to see the figure's fine features, see the shine of her blonde hair, the curve of her cheek. It was unmistakably
A smash and crash later and Mycroft, Sherlock, Lestrade and an army of officers invaded the room, guns pointed on the sister Holmes. It was over. It was all over for her and John gave an appreciative nod to Sherlock.
“It's fine,” Sherlock said again. “Anything dangerous is out of her reach. Her toys and all things of interest to her are in the living room, and my experiments are in the kitchen.”
“John.” Sherlock's tone was firm, clearly wanting John to change the subject.
“Mr Holmes, he's out of surgery,” she explained. “It doesn't look too bad, all things considered and I'm confident he'll make a full recovery. For now he just needs rest and time to heal.”
This fic is sprouting chapters everywhere and my very neat outline that has twelve chapters is turning into a suggestion. I don't know how many chapters the fic will have, but it's more than twelve. Either way the chapter count has been changed to ?. How many chapters are there? We just don't know.
Greg blushed and took the final gulp of his pint for courage. “Molly. It's Molly.”
“John.”
“Can you hear me?” he demanded. John didn't respond. “Can you hear me?” John's heart monitor steadily beeped. “This is fine, you know. This waiting. Well, not fine, but I'll do it. I'll wait. I'll wait a year if I have to. I'll wait however long it takes because you waited for me.” Sherlock pulled a face. “Well, you didn't really. You moved on and found Mary and I ruined your proposal – that was fun – but in the end you sort of waited. And I'll wait for you. I owe you that much. I
“That night. I don't remember all of it,” he admitted. “But I remember I got drunk. And then I went to your flat. And we talked a bit, I remember that just fine. And then it got a bit fuzzy, but I know what happened. I know what we did.”
Sherlock gazed at her, taking in every feature. Her nose, her lips, her soft skin. Eleanor seemed less interested in Sherlock by the minute and soon drifted off to sleep, the blanket still in her mouth.
“Hmm... but I shot him...that cabbie for you.”
Sherlock abruptly got out of bed, tugging at the elastic band of his sweat pants. When he returned, he had the velvet box in his hands. And then he went on one knee. John crawled to the edge of the bed to get a better look at him.
______________________________________
Lestrade nodded. “Good. That's good, then.” Sherlock went quiet again. “So are you gonna spend the night here or d'ya want a ride home?”
Sherlock dropped his search and clicked on the text bubble. It led him to the email. It was short and to the point:
“Yeah?”
“'bout what?” Sherlock spat into the sink and rinsed off his toothbrush.
Sherlock stiffened.
“As you know, Mary isn't dead,” Sherlock said slowly, as if he were talking to a scared animal that would run away if he spoke too fast.
“How'd he propose?” Greg pointed to the gold band that wrapped itself around John's finger. John grinned and took a moment to admire it.
John went to hover in the doorway of the bathroom and watched Sherlock brush his teeth. “I'm not mad.”
The pub was full, as was expected for a Friday night. The usual patrons huddled around the bar, while the non-regulars occupied the tables that seemed to be placed haphazardly on the floor. Servers weaved around the tables, squeezing themselves through tight spaces while balancing heavy trays on their nimble fingers. It was looked almost like figure skating, at least if would if anyone paid attention to the servers. They only seemed to be noticed when they were arriving with food and drinks.
“Sherl..” John muttered, his vision fading.
“It's very okay,” Sherlock replied. The thought of having John and Rosie in the same flat as him made it feel brighter already. “When do you plan on moving in? Getting are your things over here?”
Sherlock went back to kissing John while stroking his cock. It felt wonderful. And right. And how long had he been waiting for this? Craving this? Fantasising about this in the shower? It had been ages since the last time he had sex. Not much happened between himself and Mary. And when it did, it was boring and plain and not excited and –
"Did I do something wrong?"
A working title for this chapter was "Foxtrots desperately tries to duct tape over what happened in series 4 like what actually happened with Molly" I really, really hated that phone scene (and that episode in general) and in my series 4 fix-it fic, I'm trying to fix whatever went on with Molly. thb I don't think it can be truly fixable, but here's an attempt.
“I guess we should be going,” John said.
Mycroft gently closed the door and took Lestrade's seat.
Mary and i have Decided I Can't See You Again. what happened between us meant nothing. I Love her not You.
“Mr Holmes?”
Sherlock for a moment looked embarrassed. To him it was a fine idea to bring Rosie, but maybe it wasn't that fine of an idea after all. Maybe it was even selfish to drag Rosie out here knowing it was against John's wishes. Maybe he had to give up a few things when looking after her. But a moment later he looked like his stone-cold self. “Feel free to drop by the flat when you figure out you can't solve this case on your own.”
“I've wanted to do this for ages,” John admitted as he leaned forward, placing a hand on Shelrock's chest for balance. “Thought about this a lot. Never really though it'd actually happen.” John gave a shy smile as he rolled his hips. Sherlock immediately reacted by pressing his head back into the pillow. That was a sight to see: Sherlock bare and vulnerable in front of him like that. John kept moving against him, kept rolling his hips into Sherlock and watched as his breathing sped up, the way his fingers clenched into the bedsheets. Sherlock had his eyes squeezed closed and breathed heavily through his nose.
“Did you, now?”
A police car dramatically squealed to a stop and a young officer bounded out. “Hands on your head!” he ordered to the suspect as he walked past Sherlock and John. “You're under arrest--”
“Ah.”
But Sherlock couldn't wait forever. With or without Lestrade's help, he was going to find John and take him back from Mary by whatever means possible. And while Lestrade was at work, Sherlock crept about the flat. Lestrade was a cop and surely he'd have some means of personal protection in the flat. A taser, perhaps. Or maybe even a gun if he was lucky. Most people who owned weapons kept them near their bed, in case of a night-time robbery. The bedside table in Lestrade's room had nothing useful and Sherlock was careful to put the contents back in just as he found them. When he was starting to give up on the search, he noticed a small pile of papers on the dresser. They were large scrap pieces of paper and given how tidy Lestrade's room was, it seemed strange he'd leave used paper about.
“Fine.” Sherlock sat on a nearby chair and looked like he had been sitting there for quite some time. Sherlock needed a shave.
“John.” Sherlock leaned forward in his chair, his hand hovering over his phone. The last thing he needed was a drunk John wasting his time, and he wouldn't hesitate to call a cab and send him home.
Slowly and carefully he began to place Eleanor back into her carrier, deciding it was time to go. Sherlock didn't show any interest in the baby anyway. When she settled in, Sherlock spoke.
John did.
John smiled. Hopefully the treat was something fluid. He hadn't had ha a good wine in ages. Or maybe a new table for his home?
"John! John!“ Sherlock’s shouting makes John sprint up the stairs leading to their flat. The detective’s voice is terrified. He bursts into the bathroom, where a half-dressed detective is standing in front of the mirror, pure horror in his face.
“Why… Why would the students defend me?
“First, don’t let your house define who you are, or more importantly, who you want to be. You are still growing up, and so will your character change. Also, lumping every house member for something a few did is illogical. We can all agree on that. I will not accept any more fighting between the houses in my presence, is that understood?
Sherlock never comes back, and soon John has to get out of the water. His toes and fingers are frozen, but his heart is far heavier.
worse?
Sherlock cries and winds his blue scarf around the snowman’s neck.
What did he mean? Surely not- suddenly he viewed the table in a whole different light. The man pulled out a needle from his pocket and rolled up his sleeve. Sherlock was only able to watch, frozen. All of the hard work he and John had done to get him clean again, to secure a non-drug future for them, was about to be nullified. His captor must have noticed his concern, because he smiled reassuringly.
John’s fingers brush over the round scar and Sherlock’s whole body shutters in discomfort. The rain has not stopped falling yet.
“I thought about you every day, every hour, every minute.” Sherlock whispered. “That is why I took the dog tags, so I could remember you.”
“What do you mean?
“No one ever came for Sherlock. He had a bad reputation with the nurses and the head of the orphanage. They called him a

, John thinks. What has he done?
Sherlock asks annoyed. It is bad enough that John forced him to accompany the doctor for their visit to Sherlock’s parents, but did they have to attend the Halloween market with all its horrible attractions as well?
Sherlock decides not to waste any more time and hurries off to the infamous gift and flower shop, that is in every airport. In the shop, Sherlock is immediately overwhelmed by all the balloons, teddy bears, unicorns (?) and roses. He does the only thing he can think of and fires off a text message to Molly:
Mary winks at him and battles her eyelashes.
After our break-up, I needed a new beginning. I left my position at St. Mungo and came here.
Mary and Sherlock meet for the beginning of the final confrontation.

Watching Sherlock play with the dog had finalized John’s (hopefully brilliant) idea. That’s how he ended up here, browsing the shelter.
Smith does not stop. Sherlock’s shoulders shake, his knees try to kick out, his arms are flailing against the restraints. Smith does not stop, and Sherlock is falling unconscious.
John nods: “That sounds reasonable.

drove them both to the hospital. The nurses checked John’s head, gave him a quick scan and pronounced him healthy, but they advised John to stay for one night for observation. This naturally meant that Sherlock would stay at the hospital too.
He is ripped out of his growing confusion by a gentle touch to his elbow that sends immediate shocks through his back.
With that done he fired off a short text to Lestrade, asking him if he was home and if John could come. John didn’t feel like facing Mycroft right away, that pompous ass hat probably knew everything, and Lestrade was a police man after all and more than capable of creating a safe space for them.
Surely this must mean…

The two Holmes brothers are sitting in a booth at the coffee store somewhere around Marylebone Road. The café is a bit isolated from the rest of the busy street, so it’s relatively quiet.

He mumbles to himself, then suddenly hears a noise. It sounds like someone is giggling.
John quickly let water run into the bathtub and collected pain medication, his phone and charger, clothes for him and Sherlock (Mary had luckily bought him a pair of two large pants and trousers and an oversized jumper as a welcome gift), his laptop and his wallet into a bag. He hoped that Mycroft (damn that man) and his minions would take care of the rest of his meagre belongings.
One of the nurses was immediately upon him, pointing angrily at the dripping mess: “Look at what you have done!
In front of them stands the small house, their new home. It’s nowhere as grant as the Holmes’s mansion, but John decided they didn’t need so much place at the moment (although Sherlock will surely adopt a couple of dogs in the following years). It consists of a small kitchen corner, a massive bed (very stable, of course), and most important, a fireplace.

Especially after everything that happened, nearly two years ago. The nightmares had kept him awake for months, and only Mary’s presence in bed has helped him. She reacted surprised when John asked if he could move from his tiny flat into her house, but she happily agreed when he explained how much more time they would be able to spend together. Mary was a nurse in a clinic, and they often kept long-working hours. Now, she was growing a bit tired of his grumpiness in the morning, and even tried to recommend him sleeping pills. John never heard of these pills, and when he googled it, he found out that it was made by a factory in Romania, which did not deliver into Great Britain. He asked Mary about, curious, but she only laughed and said that she must have read about it somewhere.
“I'm not sure.”
“Put the gun down now!” From the cars behind them more officers stood, their guns trained on the suspect.
“Tell me about your childcare experience.” Sherlock gave her a hard stare. Marcella smiled back at him.
What just happened?
Sherlock of course would have gone to find John himself, but he knew how dangerous Mary could be. She had no problem shooting him once, so why should she hesitate to do it again? So Sherlock was stuck on the sofa, day after day, feeling his mind go to waste while Lestrade seemed oblivious to any issues at all.
John took a sip of his drink, then shook his head. “It's safe with me.” Every so often the two would get together and talk about cases. It was obvious John missed the trill of being on cases and Lestrade liked bragging about the cases he had actually solved on his own. Sherlock didn't help out with cases all the often anymore – always said he was busy with something else.
"So did I do something wrong? Are you mad with me?"
But this silence was different. It was cold and empty and Sherlock tapped his fingers against the countertop as he tried to say something. The silence became awkward and was only punctured by the sound of John sipping his bitter tea.
“Why?”
It was awkward to say the least. John didn't feel at home in the place he once called home. Instead, he felt more a like a guest. Even when his things were moved in, it didn't feel right to him. Currently, his room was crammed with the addition of Rosie's crib and she still woke a few times in the night. Sherlock did his best to help John out with responsibilities, but John often refused the help, not wanting to admit he needed any.
Sherlock pulled a face.
When he opened his eyes again, morning light was trailing in through the window. Rain pit-pattered against the glass. It still felt like he was being held down by an impossibly heavy blanket.
Sherlock awkwardly perched himself on the floral sofa as he looked around the living room. The place could be mistaken for Mrs Hudson's flat with the way it was arranged: family photos everywhere, bright wallpaper lined the walls, and potted plants grew in the windowsill. Sherlock realised he had never actually been inside of Molly's flat for all the time he knew her.
“Do I?” John asked through closed teeth.
looking after Rosie,” Sherlock replied. “I want someone I trust.”
“No!”
John nodded. “Well, I'm off to bed,” he said as he heaved himself from the sofa. It took him a few moments to gain his balance and then he was off to his room. But before he was gone, he looked back at Sherlock and smiled a warm smile. “And by the way, I love you too.”
Greg let out a delighted laugh as he looked at all of the pictures, taking a moment to admire each one. “Look at her. Just look at her! Getting bigger each day!” Greg's excitement was contagious and John soon found himself smiling as well. “Got a wonderful wife, and a beautiful baby girl. Things couldn't get much better for you, eh?”
Sherlock was still trying to catch his breath as he stared at Lestrade. Slowly he felt himself grow stronger and he managed to sit himself up, leaning against the headboard.
“Something wrong?” Lestrade asked, noticing Sherlock's pale face, his heaving shoulders as he breathed.
Rosie stayed cuddled up to Sherlock as he continued to read. She didn't fully understand what he was saying, but she liked listening to his deep voice speaking in a gentle cadence.
John was already in his pajamas when he went to inform Sherlock of his early night.
Lestrade's voice became white noise to Sherlock and it was easy enough to ignore and he was able to wallow in his own thoughts. John had left him. And hadn't spoke to him since. Their relationship seemed to be over just as soon as it started and it looked like John wasn't grown-up enough to actually call it off. Of course John couldn't have seen Mary coming back – no one could – but it still hurt to be left behind without a word. The flat became so empty without John or Rosie's laughter to brighten the place up.
“Now none of this leaves the table, got it?” Lestrade said with a cheeky grin.
“Lestrade?”
“Didn't mean to wake you.” She smiled. “No really, I didn't mean to wake you. I was hoping you'd sleep through this. Make it easier for the both of us.”
“I'll tell her you said hi.”
“It's Marcella's trail day,” John replied.
“What?”
“Hmm.”
That's when Sherlock came. John could feel Sherlock's arms around him, holding him close, trying to keep him warm. “John. John, can you hear me?” Sherlock sounded like he was speaking under water.
“I remember,” John stated.
“And she and John are living together with Rosie just as they have been before.”
“She had cleared out the purse before I went through it. Whatever was in there was gone. There was her wallet and some makeup and feminine products and car keys. Just normal purse stuff.”
“Just wanted to let you know I'm gonna head in early,” John stated, feeling like he had to inform Sherlock of when he was going to sleep. It felt like he was asking a teacher to use the bathroom in public school.
Mycroft smiled. “Of course.”
John shrugged and kept his eyes on his glass, as if hoping a fresh pint would magically appear.
“I'm here.”
“Not entirely, but isn't it strange? She returns without warning, revealing she wasn't actually dead, and now I haven't heard a word from John.” Molly hummed in response, thinking. “What I want to know is if John has been in contact with you.” Molly shook her head. “Have you been in contact with Mary?”
"Hmm?"
“How--” John was about to ask Sherlock how he knew the envelope was found, but decided not to waste time on such a question. “Mary's underwear drawer.”
“Are you afraid?”
“It's fine.”
“What?”
John sat on the sofa. “Can't,” he replied as he turned on the television, hoping there was something on that could calm his mind. A cop show caught his eye. John kept the television on the lowest volume setting, not wanting to disturb Sherlock's reading. Sherlock could barely hear the mumbled voices and put his book down and sat beside John on the sofa and adjusted the volume.
Mycroft stood, straightening his waistcoat. All his life he felt a need to protect his younger brother, but he always seemed to fail. Whether it be school bullies, his addictions, his dangerous work, falling in love or even heartbreak, Mycroft couldn't protect him no matter how hard he tried. “Let me know when you start planning the wedding.”
“Fine.”
“So you can afford the rent on your own?” John asked.
“John?”
Sherlock didn't know how much time had passed. But he hadn't been home since the incident. Hadn't slept in a proper bed, or had a good meal. The flowers from Molly had turned shrivelled and brown, and the balloon sadly drooped in the corner. Mycroft periodically came to visit his brother, to try to persuade him to go home and rest – John wasn't going anywhere. But Sherlock refused.
“It is.” John reached over to his old beside table and pulled out that bottle of lube he kept there. Luckily Mrs Hudson didn't clean out his room when he left all those years ago. John sat up and awkwardly got out of his jeans and underwear all while trying to straddle Sherlock beneath him.
“Fine. Good. Recovering. Taking it easy,” John replied. “Can't blame her though. The birth was rough on her. I can only imagine what she's going through.”
-----
The two were headed off to a medical conference in Manchester. Of course, both were going for different reasons. John had to attend the conference and Sherlock conveniently had a case at the same location. It wasn't a case Sherlock would normally take – a wife concerned her husband was having an affair each time he left for a medical conference. The email from said wife was sitting in his inbox for a long enough time and only got a reply when Sherlock realised John was going to the very same conference the husband was. So, Sherlock came up with a new identity and added himself to the list of those attending the conference and booked himself a room at the very same hotel all the doctors were staying at.
I'm a sucker for corny endings.
Sherlock, who was seated beside him, didn't look all that interested either. To disguise himself, he wore a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and an ill-fitting auburn wig. It made his head feel overheated and itchy.
Sitting in Sherlock's chair with Rosie on her lap, the babysitter smiled. “She was fine. She's always fine,” she replied, running her fingers through Rosie's curly blonde hair. The same curly blonde hair the babysitter had. On the arm of the chair was a red wig, no longer of use.
Sherlock glanced to the envelope beside him. It obviously had something to do with Mary. Something happened that made John feel the need to take the envelope to a professional to find out what was in it without opening it. If Mary had just given it to John, he would have opened it by now. So the envelope was for Mary. Had something to do with Mary.
“What I'm trying to say is...” John interrupted, but lost his voice. The two stared at each other for a moment, John looking completely serious and Sherlock looking vulnerable. They stared in complete silence because nothing had to be said. What John wanted to say had already been said again and again ages ago. But just to make sure Sherlock really did understand what John meant, he ever so gently reached for Sherlock's hand and Sherlock ever so gently laced his fingers between John's. “Is this okay?”
John turned the television on and found he only got four channels. One of them wasn't even in English. Of course, he shouldn't have expected luxury, not when the clinic was paying for his accommodations.
John could feel each raindrop as it fell on him and trickled down his body, like a river flowing down a mountain. Each drop was cold against his heating skin and helped him focus on what just happened. What just happened?
“No...it's fine.”
John never had the courage to get this close to Sherlock. There were times when he wanted to. Maybe hug him or hold him, but John was too proud to show any affection like that. Bu he felt small and vulnerable and Sherlock felt comforting. Maybe it'd be awkward later on, but at the moment, in this very point in time, John was comfortable.
“Come on,” Lestrade said as he opened the door, inviting himself in. “I'm not gonna have you wasting the day sleeping.”
Sherlock placed the envelope on the cushion beside him and settled his hands in his lap. John stared back at Sherlock, waiting for something. A deduction, maybe. Maybe he'd stand up and point out how very clever he was and deduce what was in that envelope and might as well deduce what John had for breakfast just to show off. But Sherlock didn't move from the sofa. In fact, John wasn't entirely sure if Sherlock was even blinking. It looked as if he had just turned into a statue.
“And unless this,” he motioned to the wine, “is some sick experiment of yours, I think you're trying to do the same thing. Get me drunk so I'll kiss you again.”
“And John's been spending all his time with Mary. I haven't heard from him in ages, have you?”
John nodded. “That's good.”
“I needed help with the case.”
“Make what...” Sherlock was still drowsy from his sleep and the weight on his chest didn't help. Each breath he took became more of a struggle. It made him feel weak and even the thought of raising an arm to push Mary off of him felt nearly impossible.
“You're trying to kill me.”
“Of course. Rosie needs someone more capable than me. Someone with proper training and experience. I'm a consulting detective, not a babysitter. I just ask I can visit her a few times a week.”
For weeks the proposal wasn't spoken of. Even when John was fully healed, there was no talk, no discussion of marriage. And to be honest, John felt a bit disappointed. Had Sherlock simply forgotten, or did he no longer want to marry John? Was there second thoughts? Changed his mind? As the weeks flew by, John felt more and more anxious and finally, he had to ask.
Sherlock stayed quiet.
“No.”
“How's he doing?” Lestrade let himself into John's room and took a seat on the worn padded chair. Sherlock sat in the other, his eyes focused on John. The room was kept dark so John could rest easier. The only source of light was from the streetlight that crept in through the window. “Heard they got the bleeding under control. Bullet's out nice and clean. Give him a few weeks of rest and he'll be good as new.”
“How 'bout a trail run? We have her over for a few hours and see what happens.”
Sherlock nodded and placed the now empty box on the bedside table and got back into bed. John admired his ring.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Sherlock and I are going to go out for some new clothes for Rosie,” John explained as he handed his daughter over to the babysitter. Rosie beamed the moment she was placed in Marcella's arms. “We're only going to be gone a few hours. You have my number in case anything goes wrong. But I doubt anything will go wrong. Rosie's a very good girl and she doesn't get into trouble.”
“Yes, thank you.”
“Yes.”
“You said it wasn't dangerous,” Sherlock replied, ducking under the police tape. “If it's not dangerous, then it's safe. If it's safe, I can bring Rosie.”
“Oh.”
Sherlock lounged on the lumpy sofa as he went through a number of texts he received from Molly. As planned Molly invited Mary out to lunch in hopes of finding out exactly what she was after. Why was she keeping John hidden away? And more importantly, why did she try to kill Sherlock a second time?
“Your girlfriend killed them.”
“Congratulations,
John says, who has suddenly appeared behind Sherlock.
He lifts Sherlock’s upper body up a bit and sticks a straw between his chapped lips. Sherlock drinks greedily.
Sherlock quickly busies himself with making his own cup, so John won’t see his disappointed face. The case may have been tedious, but they had spent the day together and nevertheless had fun. It felt like old times and for a few hours Sherlock was allowed to pretend that everything was back to normal. Obviously John did not feel the same thing and preferred to go to the house he shared with his perfect wife and the mother of his daughter. The wife who shot Sherlock, wanted to do it again in Lauriston Gardens, constantly lies and mocks them but since John loved her, Sherlock had to smile and accept it all and be Mary’s friend. With her murder, this all went crashing down, first John blaming Sherlock for her death, then Sherlock on a drug binge, then John nearly pummelling Sherlock to dead on the floor of a morgue. Neither of them never talked about any of it. They don’t really talk about anything at all any more, except about their cases.
… I would love to take you to bed right now, but I’m afraid neither of our sleeping quarters are big enough for what I am planning to do with you. How about we pop down to the Room of Requirement and see where it takes us?
She closes the door, and Sherlock can hear the door bolted shut.
The room was silent for a moment, then Sherlock spoke up. Finally!
“Are your cases getting more dangerous, or are you just getting more reckless?” John asked, placing the shard of glass on a cloth that sat on the sink's rim. Both John and Sherlock had suffered a number of injuries during their adventures. Some could be patched up with a bandage, others required a trip to A&E. At the time, it didn't bother John to see Sherlock get hurt, because he was always there to fix him. But it bothered him now.
John awkwardly shifted his weight from one leg to the other as he tried to find the right words. “Seems a bit silly, y'know, me having to always stop by the flat to pick up Rosie or drop her off. Takes time out of my day. The flat's not even near the clinic.”
But Mary saw through the plan. During lunch, as Molly informed Sherlock via text, Mary deflected all questions, and the ones she did answer were ambiguous. She seemed to be an expert at not giving a straight answer and Molly ran out of questions to ask. It was ultimately a failure and worst of all, it seemed Mary was on to Molly. Sherlock asked Mycroft to keep an eye on Molly, just in case Mary tried to go after her.
“We're not doing it like that,” John whispered against Sherlock's neck. Suddenly the eagerness had left. John's voice grew softer and his movements became smoother. “If you don't mind,” he went on, a timidness coming into his voice, “I'd like to...be on the receiving end.” John's cheeks turned pink with embarrassment and Sherlock let out a rumbling laugh. That old John he had fallen in love with was back.
John shook his head.
“Why are you here?”
“Because I was thinking... I was thinking and someone would snatch you up. Why hasn't anyone snatched you up?” People were interested in Sherlock – it didn't take a genius to figure that out. People stared at him, eyed him when they were out on cases. And with his added fame, Sherlock would be able to have anyone he wanted. So why have no one?
Sherlock was gawked at as he walked into the house. Some officers were bent over taking pictures of a corpse that was on the ground while others were dusting for fingerprints or finding evidence. But they all stopped and stared as soon as he walked in.
"Did I do something wrong?" John asked one night as Sherlock climbed into bed next to him. John was partway through a novel while Sherlock was going through crime scene photos he had taken on his phone. Sherlock didn't reply and after a pause, John spoke again: "Sherlock."
John didn't feel any pain when the bullet hit him. There was an uncomfortable pressure in his chest, but no pain. Still, he knew what had happened: the gun was still pointed in his direction and Sherlock's startled expression said it all.
“What did we think about Jeanette?”
“Sorry I'm late,” John said as he stood in the doorway, slightly out of breath. Rosie gave a squeal of delight and held her arms out towards John. Sherlock handed her over and Rosie nestled her head into John's neck.
John could hardly believe what was happening. Every fantasy he kept under lock and key for countless years were starting to come true. Sherlock desperately kissed him and they were so close together John could feel Sherlock's racing heart through his chest. John ran his fingers through Sherlock's mess of curls and the sound Sherlock made when John gave them a tug put shivers down his spine.
What Mycroft said was the truth, but that didn't erase the butterflies that were fluttering in Sherlock's stomach. “How should I ask him?”
A small note appeared on screen, giving a warning that there was only one chance left to guess the password before the laptop became locked. Sherlock paused and glanced around the room, looking for password hints. After some amount of thought, he began to type in a password:
“Sure.”
"No. Why?"
Sherlock hid his look of disappointment and pocketed the box as he resumed his chair. When he was seated, he leaned over the bed to place a kiss on John's dry lips. John's heart rate monitor spiked.
“Yep.” John nodded, but he didn't leave the flat. After pausing for a moment, he spoke again, “Listen...I was thinking...”
“You're a doctor, but you don't even know what's wrong with your wife?”
Sherlock opened the box, revealing a golden ring. “And this isn't romantic or even thought out and..” he trailed off, his brow furrowing as he realised he should have taken John up on his offer of waiting until tomorrow. But he was already on one knee with the ring shining in its box. "So.. so John Watson, will you marry me?" The confidence Sherlock usually had about him melted away.
“We'll let you know his condition as soon as we can. Please, just wait here and we'll--”
“Did you say anything else?”
John took in a deep breath through his nose. “Little things, I guess. Some days I notice she didn't wear her wedding ring. One day she just about lost it when Eleanor started playing with her purse. Said there was something in there she didn't want Eleanor getting at. I thought maybe she had some hard candy in there, something Eleanor could swallow or expensive makeup she could ruin.”
“Tea?”
It was a regular night shift for Lestrade when the very high detective sauntered to the crime scene. Only being a junior officer at the time, Lestrade had the job of escorting Sherlock away while the more senior officers examined the crime scene.
Lestrade glanced over and smiled at the sight of Sherlock: that was the way Sherlock would sit on the sofa all those years ago when they first met.
John realised Greg was staring at him, worried. To take the attention away from him, he flashed a grin and changed the subject: “Seeing anyone lately?”
“I thought I was going to lose you,” Sherlock replied, pressing a kiss against John's hand.
“Hmm?”
“I'm going to ask you to do something. You can say no. But I was wondering if you would be willing to meet Mary – in a public area – to talk. Not about this, but about something else, and see if you could notice anything strange about her. Anything suspicious. If you're willing.”
Sherlock felt his heart sink. If John wanted to hire a nanny, Sherlock couldn't stop him. But he'd be heartbroken. Then again, he knew this arrangement wouldn't last long. Sherlock wasn't a proper caretaker and Rosie needed someone who was better skilled to attend to her needs.
“As you can see, all words with a capital letter is the actual message and words without an upper-case letter is just fluff.”
John copied his motion, but instead of heading to the door, he wobbled his way over to Sherlock. “What's wrong with you? Don't you care?” John was so close Sherlock could smell the beer on his breath. “Why don't you care?” Suddenly, John's voice became soft and gentle. “What are you afraid of?”
As the kettle heated up, Sherlock picked through their limited selection of cereal and chose the one with the highest sugar content. The previous night, Sherlock had stayed up late working on a case, and worst of all, it was still unsolved.
“No. No, of
John opened a cupboard on the other end of the kitchen and pulled a tea bag from its box and tossed it over to Sherlock. With a bit of aiming, he managed to catch the tea bag right in the mug and frowned as some of the hot water splashed out.
“Mr Holmes?”
“Yeah.” John couldn't hide his proud smile.
“Gotta be more careful.”
John held his gaze on Sherlock. “I loved Mary and she was there when I needed her. We needed each other right there and then and it worked out. And ideally she'd still be here, but all things considered, I'm happy where I am right now. With you.”
“How's Mary?” he asked when John followed him out of the bathroom.
“It didn't.”
“Right then.” John nodded.
With that, he was gone.
Since John had left, Sherlock had fallen into a rut and Lestrade made a habit of visiting Sherlock every few days to make sure he was taking care of himself. Often times, he'd bring some food or help tidy the flat, or even make sure Sherlock was showering.
“Anything else?”
and it made his heart race and his chest heave. “John.”
Molly smiled a very small smile. “I always thought... that the two of you had something. But neither of you said anything and I didn't want to ask. But – ”
Rosie giggled as she knocked over her tower of blocks.
“She doesn't even understand what she's seeing. She'll forget it all by the time she gets tucked in for bed.” Sherlock stood up. “I only see one body. Where's the other three? What makes you sure they're connected?”
The coffee shop buzzed with activity. The door was constantly opening, letting in bursts of cold air. People around them were muttering to their friends or into their phones, or noisily typing into their laptops.
“I was just leaving,” he abruptly said, standing. In the doorway stood Mycroft. When he was ready to leave, Mycroft took a step to the side, giving him clear access to the door.
“And why exactly did you come here?” Mycroft lazily looked over the case files, tossing them to the side with disinterest.
“Yes. Yes, of course.”
“I know how to look the part.”
“I don't blame myself,” Sherlock snapped.
but it's an act, isn't it? A bloody act!” John continued on his rant, his voice getting louder and louder.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said quietly, his voice hoarse.
“Everything's fine,” Sherlock replied.
Without thinking twice, Sherlock grabbed the paper and stared at it. But they were just gas receipts. Sherlock scowled and crumpled the paper in his hand and let it fall to the floor, not bothering to clean it up.
Sherlock didn't say anything else for the rest of the visit and Lestrade had run out of things to ramble about. After a fast goodbye, Lestrade was gone and the flat went silent. Suddenly he began to miss Lestrade's ramblings.
Sherlock's shaking hand hovered over the doorknob. “What?”
“There's no where to go, Max,” Sherlock said as the man fought to get his foot and jacket free from the fence. Finally he managed to pull his foot from the fence, but he lost his balance. The jacket ripped from where it had been caught, causing him to fall over. But the man quickly got back on his feet and shoved his hand into his jacket pocket. Still there. It's still there.
John smiled as he stared lovingly at his child. “Good. Well not good. She's been waking us up in the middle of the night for feedings. Haven't got a good night's sleep in ages. And changing nappies is a bit of a nightmare. I didn't realise that --” John cut himself off, realising it was true: when becoming a parent talking about your child's poop was normal. But he decided Sherlock didn't need to know those details. “I just love her so much.”
Greg seemed to instantly forget about his concerns about John when the conversation had shifted to himself. “No. No, but there's someone I'm interested in. Just can't get the guts to ask her on a date.”
“Why?”
“One miracle. For me.”
John was a bit slower than before and walked with extra caution. Sherlock didn't accept any cases, not when his main priority was looking after John. The two spent quiet days together and at one point, Sherlock would have found those quiet days to be boring, but now he wouldn't have it any other way.
Suddenly she came into focus. “Yes.”
The flat felt like home again. It wasn't quite the same as before and part of Sherlock knew that would happen. Things would never be the same and he had to accept that.
Despite all that, he left the sofa and followed John up to his room. Because they might never have another chance at this. Even if it was for the wrong reasons, Sherlock still wanted to be part of this.
John made his way down the stairs and the flat grew a little darker. So Sherlock called out to him:
“I gave you a miracle, now you owe me one,” Sherlock said. “Just one. Just one miracle. I won't ask anything from you again.” John was silent. “I saw you that day. When you spoke to my tombstone. I saw the entire thing and it hurt me to see you like that. I wanted to reach out and let you know I was really there. I would have if it wouldn't have compromised your safety.”
“Not clever enough it seems,” Mycroft replied while Sherlock stared at his sister in confusion. So many questions were running through his mind, but now wasn't the time to ask them. “It's over, Eurus. Put the gun down. If you shoot John Watson, we'll shoot you.”
you."
“And do you?”
“Have you now?”
“I want John to marry me.”
Mary smiled again. “I do prefer the gun method. It's faster, has less talking. I don't have to do as much work,” she replied. “But this way, your friends at the Yard will have a suspect.” She leaned forward and placed a hand over his mouth and pinched his nose with her other. “Remember that friend of yours? The one that owned the hospital. Didn't he like to kill people this way? Wouldn't he want some kind of revenge? Why wouldn't he just pop in and finish the job he started?”
John leaned over and gently pulled the blanket back and with utmost care, pulled the infant from her carrier and into his arms. She was swaddled in blankets and the only thing showing was her face. Her eyes were squeezed shut and her chubby lips were pulled into a frown.
“Yeah,” John agreed with a grin as he crossed the room to put his coat on and tossed Sherlock's coat to him. Sherlock smiled a strained smile as he caught his coat and shrugged it on. “Something wrong?” John asked.
The television show ended, only to be replaced by the next episode. A blonde woman was holding a gun at a cowering man who was pleading something. Then, a woman identical to the blonde burst into the room. The man shouted out in surprise. “It's never twins,” Sherlock mused to himself.
“Yeah. Yeah and...” John already lost his train of thought and instead just stared at Sherlock. Stared at his pale face, pronounced cheekbones, perfect lips, his curly hair. Soft hair, probably. John wanted to touch it, run his fingers through it. Get his fingers tangled in his hair. “Do you have a girlfriend?” he blurted out suddenly.
John stood in the doorway of 221b, completely soaked from the pouring rain. Sherlock was in his dark blue dressing gown, obviously not expecting any visitors. And why would he? It was nearly midnight and the last person he'd expect to see at his door was John Watson.
“You miss her.”
Greg grinned, though he didn't look overly convinced.
And just like that, life started again. John started to smile more and feel excited. Colleagues and patients noticed a change in him – a good one. A bright one that made him happy. Perhaps his life wasn't one he expected to live, raising a child with his flatmate, and his flatmate becoming something more than just a friend, but he enjoyed it.
“But what if it did?” It was unlike Mycroft to think about what ifs. It was a waste of time to wonder what could have happened instead of focusing on the now. The facts were that John did get shot, but it wasn't fatal and he'd recover. Still, he couldn't help but worry about all those what ifs. Worrying, like questioning possibilities was also unlike him, but when matters came down to his little brother, he couldn't help but worry. If John had died, it would have destroyed Sherlock and Mycroft would be the one who had to clean up the mess.
I think you'll like it. G.
John shook his head. “M'fine. It's fine.” The beer was starting to kick in and he felt his pulse in his ears. Soon enough he'd find everything funny and from there he'd forget all his problems. John wanted to have that feeling of weightlessness to him, see the world around him go blurry.
They were tired of the interviews when Marcella Abbot arrived to the flat and took a seat in the middle of Sherlock and John. She had a gentle smile and when she saw Rosie playing with her blocks on the floor, Marcella held her hands out. “Come here my darling,” she said, her voice soft. Rosie crawled to the woman and Marcella placed the girl in her lap. “She's absolutely gorgeous.” Marcella's long red hair spilled over her shoulder and Rosie grabbed a handful of it.
“What is it?
Sherlock, please never Sherlock.
John asks, and Sherlock nods (hopefully not too enthusiastically).
Molly has sent him a letter this week, telling him about her new black cat, Toby. Sherlock should be polite and answer her, but his bed is much more comfortable than the world outside it.
John whispers, and Sherlock nods. Now that they are nearly completely undressed, he is lost for words. He hopes the prince won’t take his hands, they are sweaty with nervousness.
“This was quite an eventful year, wasn’t it.
“Sounds like even in your dreams I’m a wonderful person.
“We have to hurry up a bit. I still have to show you something, and my time is getting short.
„He is not a freak!“ argued John back, sounding determined. „And my father was a doctor, he taught me a lot! I can help him sleep.“
Good to see you finally arriving.
laying in a bed, what happened, and whose bed is this???
The Worst Christmas ever.
"Sherlock."
Sherlock is unable to see it, but John must have caught the key. His husband leads him out of this hated room, but they do not disappear before John addresses the audience one last time.
Gregory sighed. “You have grown more distant, you barely talk to anyone anymore, you seldom acknowledge me. All you care about is the work and the profit, and that’s no way to live.
Mister Watson grumbles as they walk through the ground floor of the mansion. He points to a relatively clean looking cupboard: “This will be your room for a while.
Sequel to Day 4, Human Shield.
“There you are, I was getting worried.
“I’ll be there in ten minutes. Then I want to talk with you about that special payment of yours.

For many children in the United Kingdom, Santa Claus is a wonderful old man. He wears his big red and white coat, his hat, his dark boots, two friendly eyes and a long, white beard. He is waiting in front of the shop, reading stories on the Christmas Market, and on the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, he climbs down the chimney and places all their presents under the tree. During the month, parents use Santa Claus both as a warning and as a promise. They tell them to behave well, or they won’t get presents. If they are good children, do what they are told, make their homework and clean their room, they will receive their wishes. On Christmas Eve, millions of children go to bed and are looking forward to a visit from Santa Claus, the friendly gift bearer.
Sherlock shakes his head.
Mary twitters happily.
John sighs, steps in and closes the door behind him, which means Sherlock is trapped in this room and in this painful conversation he doesn’t want to have.

Against the Dark Arts teacher, they prefer professors with experiences in fighting against the dark arts. You probably only just got the job, since I did not see you at any of the teacher conferences. The position was cursed for years, with no one staying longer than one year, until Mr. Potter came in. Since he is gone now, I imagine other possible applicants remain cautious. Maybe you know Potter from your shared experiences fighting against the Dark Arts, and he recommended you to the headmistress. The way you hold yourself is very calm, respectful and disciplined, it practically screams military training. Then of course your injury. Not many jobs involve being cursed that badly.
You can see them too?
“Yes.
You idiot.” John whispered and finally pressed Sherlock to his chest. The detective whimpered, which only prompted John to hug him tighter. “How could I ever be happy without you?”
"I think that is quite an interpretation."
! God save you!
Not much joy here, but some comfort.

Potion, so the students can have realistic costumes!
John is ripped out of his deep thoughts by a soft snore coming from Sherlock. He giggles and presses his arm around the detective, so they can huddle closer together.

Sherlock let his fingers brush
John asks very seriously.
"Sherlock. I’m not finished. Don’t disappear in your brilliant brain now.“
Sherlock had asked him, when they arrived back at his insula.

The wet hands are touching his face.

He groaned and hit his pillow with his flat hand. The lies parents tell their children! His mum persuaded him to drive to Wiltshire, saying it would be nice to have one last family holiday together before
They collided on their broomsticks.
Nobody moves, and Sherlock has to repeat his orders twice, until they finally grab their stuff and go with slumped shoulders.
“But father, think of your business! You built it all up yourself, and it’s still running successful!
I will take a cup of Earl Grey, please.
“Okay. I mean-okay. I’m gonna take that out now, okay? It’s going to hurt, but I will be carefully.“
He blinked.
As promised, the bell rang again and Sherlock was none the wiser. He had to do a little sprint to overtake his dad who was on the way to the door, and so he ended up a
"What do you mean?“
“You definitely should, it is a lovely place. Especially at Christmas.
He opened the old door with a not very reassuring sound and squinted into the dark. His left hand searched for a light switch, but there wasn’t one. John seriously considered just giving up here and there (he still had to watch the new season of Doctor Who), but then decided that he was a soldier after all and could deal with a dark basement. He returned with his phone, turned on the flashlight and carefully walked down the groaning staircase.
John breathes out, and Sherlock’s eyes fly open.
John Watson says and shakes Sherlock’s hand. John’s hand is warm, used to work and strong. John steps a bit closer, so passers-by will not be in danger of running into his broad shoulders any more.
The slaver forced Sherlock on that podium. He stood there, chained to the stack, and looked at the people below for a while. When his numbers continued to climb, he tried to go into his mind palace, but was forced out of his head when one of the Romans started touching him intimately. No one’s hand had ever been down there, and Sherlock felt disgusted and degraded, as the others laughed at his obvious discomfort. He wanted to throw up, but the gag in his mouth, so cruelly forced in, prevented that.

waist was surprisingly slim for a man, and John could count every one of his ribs. There was fat blue bruise on his stomach, and fingerprints were clearly visible on his hip where someone must have grabbed him. The mental image of a slave handler violating what John considered as his property made him clench his fist.
John sighs. At least Sherlock is safe in a cab and not kidnapped. He shoulders his bag and goes to the next bus station. On his way, too loud Christmas music is being played everywhere. At a book store it’s “Last Christmas
Sherlock likes Mrs. Hudson and Molly, he likes the two cats, he likes coffee with sugar, he likes chemistry and solving crimes from the newspaper but most of all, he loves the bookstore. This is where he can roam every day for new treasures and where he can talk about books without anyone getting annoyed about it. It is practical that Sherlock reads everything, from
Molly sits down on their client chair in front of him, holding a glass of wine. She is wearing a huge red jumper, and Sherlock makes a mental note to ask her sometime where she bought it. John mentioned over Christmas that he wants to wear his jumpers again, and Sherlock wants to buy him a few new ones.
Shop is only one of them. The shop is situated at 222 Baker Street, with Mrs. Hudson living right next to it. Mrs. Hudson used to travel to Switzerland as a child, and wandered with her families through the gorgeous landscapes. The name

The blond stranger smiles — SMILES — at Sherlock, and then he focuses his attention back on
He tells the shop assistant behind the counter.
Sherlock groans quietly and forces himself to sit upright. His hands are still shackled in front of him, so freeing himself from that will at least keep him occupied for the next hours. Other than that, the tiles in his cell are cold and blindingly white. The only furniture in the cell is a small toilet bolted to the wall. At least there is that comfort.
“I always wanted to tell you....that...” John had trouble staying awake now. “That...I...”
John rubbed his finger where his wedding ring used to be. “I'm not mad, you know.”
Sleep paralysis is often described as the inability to move while waking from sleep. Other descriptions include feeling a weight on your chest making it difficult to breathe. Or seeing a monster of sorts in front of you, but not able to move away from it. The hallucination feels real and causes distress to the individual.
“Mary?”
“Well,” John said. “Get on with it.”
John flipped the envelope around in his hands. It was perfectly sealed. “When we had Eleanor, she promised me her past life was finished. She wouldn't do what she used to do. She'd be a wife and mother and we'd have a normal family.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said quietly.
Greg frowned. “Hey now, if you're that thirsty get yourself some water.”
“Expect a visit from the Queen?” Sherlock said as he stumbled over to the kettle.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and forcefully put his hands on John's shoulders to direct him to the door. But John leaned in towards Sherlock, put his clammy hands on his cheeks and kissed him. It was sloppy, wet, and tasted of nothing but beer. Sherlock should have pulled away, taken John outside and made sure he got the cab, but he didn't. Instead he just stood there as John kissed him, as John wrapped his arms around his shoulders. They were standing chest to chest and Sherlock could feel John's heartbeat.
“You don't want to be alone! You act like it! You're all
“What about Marcella? She was good. Rosie was fond of her.”
“Yes, your deduction is correct.”
“And how's Evelyn?”
“And try not to have another run-in with glass.”
John removed a chunk of glass and Sherlock arched his back, biting his lower lip as he swallowed a yelp.
John was leaning forward in his chair, eyes sparkling in the candlelight as Sherlock spoke. Already he had his answer: Yes, yes you idiot of course I'll marry you. But the question never came. Instead Sherlock's phone with off. Disappointed, John leaned back in his chair.
“What if he says no?”
“Yeah.”
It was past midnight and John had work the next morning (he preferred to shower the night before work and his hair was a bit puffy from the brand of shampoo he used and he smelled of that horribly scented soap he always used). But still he had time for tea.
Inside, John hung up his sopping wet coat and kicked off his shoes. Sherlock went to get the kettle on, deciding John needed a warm drink after being in the rain for so long. As the kettle warmed itself up, Sherlock took a seat on the sofa and held his hand out for the envelope. John reluctantly handed it over and Sherlock held it to the light. There was something inside.
“It's fine,” Sherlock replied.
“You're nervous,” he deduced. “You want her to think highly of you.”
“Ta,” John said with a nod as a server replaced his empty pint with a new one. Across from him was Lestrade, nursing a pint between his hands.
Sherlock scoffed. “Since when do you care about the flat looking nice?”
The last thing John had said was his name. Or at least tried to. After that he fell unconscious, looking nearly peaceful. “John,” he had whispered, wrapping his arms around him, hardly caring he was getting blood on his clothes. A sob shook his entire body as his fingers dug into John's jacket. The paramedics nearly had to pry Sherlock off of him. During the ambulance ride Sherlock refused to leave John's side and he had to be physically held back when John was taken to surgery.
“Yes?”
“Sherl..” John stared blankly ahead of him.
There was nothing to say. Everything had already been said.
“So how'd he do it?”
“Any new cases?” John asked quietly, feeling the need to keep a conversation going.
The past month had been rough between them. Nearly having sex in a hotel room really put a gap in their relationship. John refused to talk to Sherlock and even text him, ashamed of what he did. That he kissed Sherlock and let things go as far as they had. Sherlock had avoided contact with John, unsure where their friendship stood.
Sweaty palms. Beneath the table Sherlock was bouncing his knee with impatience. As each second past, Sherlock was positive his heartbeat went a bit faster. At this rate it'd just explode in his chest and he'd flop over dead on the table.
Rosie had been particularly fussy all day and John was stubborn in refusing Sherlock's help. By the time she was put to bed, John was ready for some sleep himself. It wasn't even 8:00, but he felt like he needed the early night.
But his sense of calm didn't last for long. John woke with a start. The sun was spilling into his room. His very quiet room. It was odd that Rosie didn't wake him and when he glanced to her crib, he gasped in horror when he saw it empty.
The two were seated on the sofa together, reading a book. Or rather, Sherlock was reading the book out loud and Rosie chewed on her stuffed toy as she listened. Every so often, he'd run his fingers through her curly blonde hair as he read and Rosie sopped up all of the attention.
When the glass was finally removed, John patted the wound over with the damp cloth, making sure there was nothing left. The hospital would have been able to stitch the wound together, but the only thing in the flat's first aid kit (the kit that John had bought specifically for Sherlock years ago) had a few strands of sterile tape. It would have to do.
John took a big gulp from his pint. “Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, sure thing.” Another mouthful. Another swallow.
“Right. Sorry.” John felt obligated to find Sherlock someone. A partner to go on double dates with. Visiting Sherlock had become a bit awkward and maybe strained ever since Eleanor was born. That's what a family did to you: kept you at home and prevented you from visiting friends. But maybe if Sherlock had someone they could somehow stitch close the gap that formed.
When John tucked himself in bed, he found he couldn't sleep. There were too many thoughts in his mind. Thoughts that this new living arrangement wasn't going to work out and he'd have to find a new place to live. Thoughts about Mary. Thoughts about Rosie. When he finally did manage to fall asleep, he jolted awake from a bad dream, though he couldn't quite recall it.
“That's not how it's done,” John muttered during a morgue scene. The mortician looked over the body in a matter of seconds and knew the exact moment the victim died. Later in the show, a surveillance video was zoomed in impossibly close while keeping its perfect resolution. Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock stared at the doctor standing before him. She was in baggy scrubs and her mask was sitting at her chin. Her hair was still netted back.
“Dead end.”
It felt strange typing that in or even thinking of that place. But the password was accepted and Sherlock was invited into Lestrade's laptop.
Sherlock frowned as his thunder was taken from him. It was his case, his find. If it weren't for his help the suspect would be on his way to France and no one would be the wiser. “Under arrest for the murder of Angela Simpson,” he butted in, never passing an opportunity to show off. “She didn't know of her inheritance of that priceless diamond – the one in your pocket – when her great aunt died, but you did. You had seen the will and knew all about it and kept it for yourself. Angela was oblivious to it all and wasn't a threat, but you still didn't feel safe. So you killed her to make sure she'd never find out. And tried to make her murder look like an accident when slipping arsenic in her wine is the oldest trick in the book. Really, I had hoped you would have come up with something more creative.” Sherlock held out his hand. “The diamond, please.”
Sherlock did his best to ignore the looks and crouched beside the corpse. “I thought it was a quadruple murder,” he said as he gently examined the body. Rosie gurgled and reached out to the body and Sherlock had to hold her grabbing hands back.
“Trouble can't keep its hands off of you,” John teased as he glanced to the ceiling, remembering his old bedroom was just on the floor above. When he left the flat after Sherlock's death, the bedroom was empty and John wondered if it had stayed empty all this time or if Sherlock was using it for something. Maybe to house extra experiments. “Are you going to get a new flatmate?” he asked suddenly.
Someone came through the door. Tall. Dark hair, dark coat. Pale face. The man, the stranger nearly jumped when his eyes locked with John's and he came rushing to his side, grabbing his hand. The man had a look of concern on his face and his eyes were watery.
“Glass,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock grabbed John's shoulders with his greasy fingers and pushed him into the lumpy bed.
Lestrade sat on the arm of John's chair, as if knowing he wasn't meant to actually sit in it. “What's on your mind?”
“Oh. Yeah, right.” John put the parcel on the floor and crouched down to tie his shoe. When it was knotted again, he glanced up to Sherlock, looking at him expectantly. But Sherlock said nothing and John looked disappointed. “How've you been?” he asked as he moved to his old chair, bringing the parcel with him, this time placing it on the ground beside his chair.
John shook his head. “Don't be. It was unfortunate what happened but...” he looked into Sherlock's eyes. “It is what it is.”
That wasn't the reason for Sherlock's visit, although he did need her help. He desperately needed her help.
Sherlock looked suddenly pale and he clutched his phone to his chest, not wanting Molly to see the message. Or at least not the entire thing. But explaining it out loud would be so much harder than just letting her see and he handed the phone over.
“I'll see you Monday,” Sherlock replied. Fridays were the worst. It meant two entire days without Rosie or John. That left him plenty of time to work on current cases, but the flat felt so empty when it was just him.
Lestrade met Sherlock outside of the yellow police tape that blocked off the house. “Are you serious?” he asked, trying not to raise his voice too high to gather any attention.
“No.”
“I really think it's quite obvious what I'm doing,” she replied, scrunching her nose as she spoke. And it was obvious, wasn't it? She on his chest, slowly pushing all the air from his lungs while he supposedly slept on. Sherlock felt weaker by the second, but his mind was still racing.
“Jo-” Sherlock wasn't even able to finish his name when he suddenly reached his climax. Sherlock stared at the ceiling, his mouth slightly open as he felt...how did he feel? Like he was falling and floating at the same time. Like he was drowning and swimming. That feeling he had when he finished a particularly hard case. Euphoria and excitement and calmness all wrapped into one.
* * * *
“Do you want to hold – ?”
Sherlock felt the hairs on his neck stand up on end. “Okay.”
The flat was a mess. In just a week it went from spotless to a disaster zone. The drapes sadly hung over the windows, preventing any natural light and table tops gathered dust. And John's chair sat cold and unused across from Sherlock's. Sherlock was curled up in his chair, his hands over his head. In that week, he couldn't bear to sleep in the bed he and John shared and could only sleep a few hours at a time in the small chair. The poor man was heartbroken, having lost John to Mary again.
John shrugged again. “I'm a surgeon, not a gynaecologist.”
“Really?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow, a smile forming on his lips. Now it was his turn to relentlessly tease his brother. It was a nice distraction from what was happening around him anyway.
“Dr Nicholas Parker,” Sherlock replied. “Cardiologist.”
“Really?”
“Don't have to be afraid of me.”
She had John's nose and Mary's lips and blonde hair from the both of them. But the most distinct feature about her were her eyes. The very same expressive blue eyes John had. To Sherlock, she was absolutely perfect. Anything of John's was perfect to Sherlock.
“It. Didn't.” Sherlock had of course wondered what he'd do if he had lost John. There weren't many regrets he had when it came to his lover. Perhaps he could have kissed John sooner rather than wait for his divorce to finalise. Maybe they should have waited to have sex (it was a bit of a disaster). But the point was that he did kiss John and they did have an awkward first sexual encounter and in the end he regretted none of that. The one regret he would have had, was not asking John to marry him sooner.
“Got hit by a truck?”
“Got some breakfast,” Lestrade called out from the living room. The plastic bags were set down and the sound of his footsteps neared the bedroom. “Hey, are you decent?” he asked as he tapped on the door.
John furrowed his brow, angry that Sherlock could figure out his story before he could even tell it. “Bullets. A few loose bullets at the bottom of her purse.”
Sherlock struggled out of his shirt and dressing gown. His skin was still wet from John's kisses and part of him wanted to stay seated on the sofa. John clearly wasn't thinking straight. If he had been mortified to kiss Sherlock in the hotel room, why would he come on to him like that? A pit developed in Sherlock's stomach. It was just a way to get back at Mary. The only thing he was good for was some type of revenge.
“I want her to think highly of
* * * *
“I don't know what I'd do without you,” Sherlock said, sitting up. “I love you. I don't show it and I don't say it enough and I'm not sure how to say it. But I love you. I love you and I want to marry you. So..." Sherlock stood up from his chair and pulled a small velvet box from his pocket and crouched down on one knee. "John Watson, will you--"
John laughed at the very thought of the DI, who on a regular basis saw gruesome crimes, confronted killers as his day job, didn't have the courage to ask meek, timid, quiet Molly on a date. Although, when John took in Greg's dejected expression, he realised laughter probably wasn't the best response.
“Yes.”
When he awoke again, he found Sherlock's head in his lap, eyes closed. John raised his awkward and heavy hand and placed it on his cheek. Sherlock's eyes opened and focused on John. “Hey.” John still felt like he had been hit by a truck. In fact, he was starting to feel like he'd been hit by ten trucks: his head throbbed and his chest hurt and his entire body ached.
“Not entirely helpful,” Sherlock replied as he crossed the room to pick the child up. Rosie reached for his safety goggles.
"I just wanted to know if you still wanted to do this," John explained. "This can wait until tomorrow. We can have a nice dinner together and do it there."
“I know.”
Mycroft scoffed. It was even more amusing to hear. “John won't say no.”
The bedsprings squeaked as John quickened his pace, rocking his hips against Sherlock's.
“Come here, you,” John said as he took Rosie from Sherlock. The girl cooed as she rested her head on John's shoulder, content from breakfast. “I have a shift later today,” he mentioned. “Would you mind watching Rosie?” John felt guilty for asking. Sherlock wasn't a babysitter and Rosie wasn't his responsibility. But John couldn't skip out on another shift.
Marcella let herself into the flat and when she walked into the living room, she saw a perfectly clean flat and in the middle of that living room were Sherlock and John. Rosie was balanced on John's hip and the way the two men stood together made them look like a family. It was touching.
Sherlock shrugged. “Just do.” Because he wanted to tell the world he loved John. And he wanted – no he needed – John to know he loved him. Genuinely loved him. Days blurred into weeks and months and Sherlock was all too aware he took John for granted most times. John deserved a proper wedding, a grand gesture of love.
“Who?”
John closed his eyes and held Sherlock closer.
The two groaned, Sherlock arching his back and John biting his lower lip as he felt that familiar stretch. “How's that?” John asked, his eyes meeting Sherlock's.
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock leaned over to press a kiss against John's cheek.
The case itself had already been solved – Dr Richardson was not an attractive man. No one would want to have an affair with him just based on looks, but he was a very rich man. Rich enough to pay for an affair. Dr Richardson must have thought he was so smart to figure this out. A hotel after all, was the best place to hide an affair: it was out of town, away from family, and the only person who needed to be checked into the room was Richardson himself, not any guests.
Sherlock was surprised at the request, but obliged, sinking his teeth into John's soft skin. John bit his lower lip as he let out a groan. Sherlock started to kiss down John's ripped shirt. Down past his chest to his bellybutton. John was squirming beneath him, shaking with excitement.
As he waited for John's return, he began to think of what to do with John's room. It had stayed empty since he had left. By now there ought to be a few layers of dust all over the place, but it was wasted space. Perhaps he could find himself a new flatmate. A replacement John. Someone who could accompany him with his cases, someone he could talk to, someone to keep him company.
Molly bit her lip. “I always thought she was up to something,” she admitted quietly. “It was all a bit odd, don't you think? When you did your thing on the roof, Mary showed up almost immediately. Like there was a plan for it. But I thought that was crazy and it was all just a coincidence and I should have felt happy for John and I was, but I couldn't help but wonder if...” she trailed off.
Sherlock and John sat in the cab heading back to Baker Street. At their feet were a number of bags filled with clothes. More clothes than any infant would really need. But the two of them had no self-control when it came to spoiling Rosie.
John made his way to the door, and Sherlock followed. But before he left, he turned around to face Sherlock and ever so gently placed a hand on the bandages. “Take care of yourself, okay?” he said, carefully rubbing his hand up and down the injured arm. John looked him in the eye. “Okay?”
“Eurus Holmes, drop the weapon and put your hands in the air.” A voice coming from a megaphone boomed, rattling the pictures that hung on the walls. Flashing red and blue lights blinked from the windows.
“You damn well know why.”
John frowned. “Fine,” he muttered, rubbing his left shoulder.
“Would you like to visit him?”
No suspect. G.
Mary's side of the bed was empty, the blankets pushed back. She was probably feeding Eleanor again. John crept out of bed and got dressed in the clothes he had worn the previous day and left the house without a word to Mary. Because he wasn't going to be gone that long. It was just a small cut Sherlock wanted him to look at.
“Who?”
“I'm only going to ask you to leave one more time.”
“No,” Sherlock replied as he ushered John out the door before glancing back to Marcella and Rosie. “Everything's fine.”
Sherlock scoffed. John didn't actually feel that way. It was a mix of grief and some other emotion he was feeling. Soon enough he'd be back to dating and would find a replacement Mary and move in with her and leave Sherlock behind again.
“What is it?”
“I'm sorry,” John said again.
“Can I open it?”
“See you later,” he said as he went to the door. Before he left, he paused, his hand resting on the doorknob. “Sherlock...” his voice was suddenly gentle.
The distraction was a welcome one to Sherlock. Asking John was turning in a disaster and he needed to collect his thoughts. The text in question was from Lestrade. A new case in fact. Sherlock was about to pocket his phone and ignore the text but John spoke up.
Sherlock crossed the room back to the chair and took his seat again. This time he brought his knees to his chest. The detective suddenly looked a number of years younger as he rested his chin on his knees, staring at the floor as he thought. Sherlock remained quiet, and Mycroft remained patient, waiting for his brother to reveal what was on his mind. Of course, Mycroft had already figured it out – he figured it out when Sherlock first came in. It was all obvious: sweaty palms, constantly shuffling the case file papers he held, tapping the arm of the chair with his fingers. But he still wanted to hear it from Sherlock; Mycroft never got tired of knowing he was right.
“I thought you went to bed,” Sherlock said when John showed up in the living room.
“Quite sure.”
The flat looked nice. Books were put away and the general clutter that was the kitchen table was removed. Sherlock yawned as he stepped out of his room and combed his fingers through his messy hair. John was already up, showered, and dressed and had Rosie balanced on his hip as he tidied the flat.
When John finished up another pint, Greg offered to give him a ride home, preventing him from having more. John thoughtfully looked into his empty glass. “I'll take a cab.”
“Remember our first case?” John sleepily asked.
Molly looked over John's unconscious form. Of course he didn't look good – that was to be expected when you were unconscious with a breathing tube jammed down your throat. Wires and tubes protruded from his bare arms. His chest was covered in white bandages covering the wound beneath (Eurus' aim wasn't very accurate when a mound of officers were tackling her). And even while John was unconscious, unaware of his surroundings, he didn't have a peaceful expression – his brows were knit together and his lips formed a frown as if he was silently telling everyone he hated being a patient.
“Eleanor,” John corrected, taking a seat at the kitchen table while Sherlock filled the kettle with fresh water and searched for teabags. The kitchen had always been John's area. The fridge was always fully stocked and cupboards organised when John had lived there. Now Sherlock wasn't entirely sure where anything went and couldn't quite remember how John had kept it. Finally, he found the small container of teabags in the fridge of all places. “And she's fine. Six months now. I can't believe how fast that's gone by.” John pulled out his phone and shuffled through a few pictures of his baby. “She's starting to roll now. Soon enough she'll be crawling.” After a moment of consideration, he put his phone back in his pocket. Sherlock couldn't even get his daughter's name right, why would he want to see her pictures?
“Well, you know, assassins make a generous amount of money for their jobs,” Sherlock replied, trying to find some optimism in John's situation. “So she could be saving up for Eleanor's university education. Maybe she wants a bigger home or nicer things. Perhaps she was planning a nice trip for the both of you.”
John was undressing when Sherlock entered his room. There was a certain eagerness to John's movements, but no passion. No love, no caring, just some kind of readiness to get back at Mary. John threw his shirt on the floor and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, kissing him again. Sherlock could feel John's cock through his jeans.
“John. I love him.” Sherlock had never said that to John. Never thought to and why would he? It looked like they would be spending forever together and such a thing didn't have to be said. But now he wished he said it. Said it every day when he had the chance.
“Thought you were mad. I thought... thought you did it.”
Lights in the nearby houses were being turned on as the commotion continued outside. Police sirens wailed in the distance. Still the man ran as fast as he could, stepping in cold puddles that dampened his shoes. The neighbourhood was a grid so he could find his way out. Just run straight down this street and he'd out. And beyond the neighbourhood was a small park. In the dark it'd be easy enough to find a hiding spot in a tree and the cops would give up the chase.
Sherlock scowled as Lestrade opened the drapes and let light in. “Got some takeaway. There's a new place near my flat that makes the
Sherlock began unbuttoning John's shirt. Drinking had made his coordination sloppy and he struggled to get the stubborn button through the hole. When he nearly had it, he'd lose his grip on it. John waited as patiently as he could. It felt like the button was mocking him.
“I asked you for a miracle.”
What roused him from his chair was the smell of the takeaway and his rumbling stomach. Sherlock grabbed some of the pad thai, but didn't bother reheating it. As he ate, his phone began to buzz, getting a text message. When he saw it was from John, his heart skipped and he read over the text:
“Animal Farm.”
“Yes, I need a cab for 221 Baker Street,” Sherlock said pleasantly into his phone before hanging up. It'd still be a few more minutes before the cab showed up and Sherlock was finished tolerating John. “Out,” he demanded as he stood up from his chair.
“Boyfriend, then?”
But his search was interrupted when a new email came into the inbox. A small text bubble appeared, stating the new message came from Mary Watson.
“What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Lestrade's pointless rambling helped calm Sherlock, though he'd never admit that. Just to have someone to fill the silence and breathe some life into this dark, quiet room. But the rambling stopped as soon as the door opened.
John nodded. “Right.” Eleanor whimpered, then began to cry, balling her tiny hands into fists. She kicked and fussed and John held her against his chest, resting her head on his shoulder, trying to shush her. But the baby continued to cry, refusing to quiet down. "What is it, love?" he cooed, rubbing her back, gently rocking her from side to side. John tried bouncing her, shushing her, but the baby's cries only grew louder and louder.
Not the response Lestrade had expected. Again, he nodded. “What did he say?”
And then a gunshot echoed through the street.
The man ran down the rainy street, hand in his jacket pocket. By now his breathing was heavy and he needed a moment to rest, but he couldn't afford such a luxury. So he kept running down the narrow street of the small neighbourhood. Dogs barked in their yards as he ran by, giving off his position. “Quiet!” he hissed, but that did nothing to stop the barking.
John nodded, unsure how to leave. Part of him didn't want to leave at all. The flat still felt like his home and he wanted to find some excuse to stay the night, but he couldn't think of one when he had a baby to look after. And Mary would worry if he stayed out too late.
“John.” Sherlock suddenly opened his eyes and they locked onto John's. They stared at each other as John fucked him and it was only then Sherlock began to realise how ridiculous all of this was. How they were
Sherlock felt his vision begin to blur and his limbs grew heavy. Even his struggling grew slow and laboured. Mary smiled as she felt his breaths grow shallower and shallower. It would only take a moment now.
Sherlock stood behind her.
Sherlock put a hand over his pants pocket as confirmation.
“Hmm?”
“Are you sure?”
It was definitely jealousy that was effecting Sherlock's judgement. Lestrade was an expert on that.
“It's wonderful.”
And of course, the main factor behind the exaggerations and blaming Mary was one emotion everyone feels from time to time: jealousy. Sherlock admitted he loved John and now with Mary back in the picture, it only made sense for Sherlock to feel jealous. It made sense for jealous to cloud his judgement, to make him believe she was up to something sinister when she really wasn't.

John snorted: “How could you possible know that?

John was humming silently to himself, it sounded like a nursery song. He probably sings it to his daughter while he makes her ready for bedtime.
“I’m glad you didn’t, that would have been embarrassing.

from Slytherin complains.
John never shot Mary.
"I love you.“
Sherlock stammers. Their hands are touching, and it feels very nice. If not for the spilled hot water, of course.
John clears his throat. Sherlock’s face feels like it is burning and coughs loudly. Flitwick, who so far had tried to listen secretly (not secretly enough though), suddenly turns to Binns and engages him loudly in a discussion about the current prime minister (Mycroft is really the country’s leader, but officially, he is only the first assistant). Sherlock wonders if the other teachers are as interested in their conversation as Sherlock is.
She follows him through a backdoor, which is unsupervised. She leads him right to an easily forgettable silver car.
Sherlock knocks on the door and Mary grins. Her car is parking outside, the tank is full. She and the detective are going to have a nice talk on their way to Serbia, and nobody is going to stop them.
. He, who had never begged once in his life! “I cannot bear it no longer!
He whispers to the closing door.
Still, they always had their clothes on. John wanted to go-slow in that aspect, to fully to enjoy it. The first big fight was about Johns work. Sherlock hated it that John spent so much time in that clinic, when he should rather stay at Baker Street, with him, where he belonged (he knew it was selfish of him, which made him hate the clinic even more). (The work was also the place where John had met Sarah and Mary. That wife. Was it that irrational to think that maybe John would find someone else there, someone not Sherlock, who would make John happier than he ever could?)
was appalled) and during all of this Sherlock had asked him time and time again if he was sure.

She shed her human shield and dropped the fake bump on their bed, not that John had slept there since summer. Mary retrieved her weapons and her emergency kit and left the house in the suburbs for good.
Sherlock groans.
He always thought he would choose the life his parents envisioned for him, the life society expected of him, the life he thought he wanted.
“Sherlock, John! You are under the mistletoe. You have to kiss.
“Take a deep breath, Mr. Holmes.
He watches helplessly as the two men clink their glasses together and drink the scotch. John notices Sherlock’s hand shaking.

Harry presses her pillow on her head and tries to tune out her little brother. She loves him dearly, but he can be a bit stubborn sometimes, especially when she just wants to fall asleep.
“I thought you would…
“Is he alright?
John fires a red arrow up the trees, and something large with way too many legs flees up the tree.
Greg grumbles and does a few strokes. He is already panting.
Sherlock is done and washes the shampoo away. He brushes a few kisses on the long, ugly scar on John’s shoulder. John closes his eyes, remembering how his other partners had mostly opted to ignore his scar altogether, while Sherlock is cherishing it. This scar brought John back to London, although very reluctantly at first, and then it brought him to St. Barts Hospital and Sherlock Holmes.
John muffles into Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock feels like his heart is going to explode any minute. To his terror, he feels tears leaking from his treacherous eyes. He quickly closes them, but John has already noticed. John notices everything.
John resolutely gets up, takes a small knife and slices his finger quickly open. He presses a few blood drops on the mattress. For the maids, who will undeniably have to check if their marriage was consummated. Sherlock has never been so relieved in his life.
“Who, and what are you?
He answers and starts climbing.
“What if we all kiss? It would take the pressure off and make John more willing.
Sherlock nods.
They had kissed after a particularly exciting case in a back street under the stars, which were so rarely seen in London. John was flustered even more than usual about Sherlock’s intelligence and told the detective so, and the prince beamed. That was when John had grabbed his head and pressed his lips on Sherlock’s.
“Don’t worry, he is single now. Rumours is that his last girlfriend, Mary I think, cheated on him during the summer.
Well, he never cared much about their opinion anyway.
She sighs.
The doctor ignored him and turned back to his wife, who had tears of joy in his eyes. She looked like she couldn’t believe her luck. Sherlock meanwhile was sobbing, curled into himself on the carpet like he was trying to shield himself from the brutal blow that were John Watson’s words.
The young student explains, pointing at two full boxes of Christmas lights.

The only thing missing was written proof, which is the reason they broke into the man’s private flat in Kensington, a big penthouse with a great view of London.

god, it’s killing him. Normally, he would use this sensory overload as an experiment, but right now he just wants to get out of there, be back in John’s arm and breathe fresh air.
John sounds sincere, and Sherlock is inclined to believe him. The young teacher is leaning closer to him, and Sherlock can smell John’s aftershave, coupled with his shampoo, earl grey tea and something Sherlock is not able to identify.
He had only met the politician twice before, the first time when he brought a twenty something Sherlock to a hospital to detox and the second time when at Sherlock’s fake funeral (that bastard). The older brother always seemed to creep him out and John’s horror stories about him certainly didn’t help. Nevertheless, they were all members of the Sherlock Holmes support group and so always connected.
“I have to assist Filch today with checking the
Sherlock gulped, the humiliation burning a deep hole. Is Mary right about John? Suddenly Sherlock wasn’t so sure anymore. Tears were gathering in his eyes, and he wished they were there because of the heat from the flames.
Except Sherlock is nowhere to be seen. John fumbles for his mobile phone, now getting stressed as well. Bloody hell, why can Sherlock never do what he is told.
The week resting in bed has given John much to contemplate. He drank tones of tea made by Mrs. Hudson and occasionally by Sherlock, they ate take-away and home-cooked lasagna and Sherlock brought freshly baked biscuits from the Café downstairs. Between the hours of eating and sleeping, John settled comfortably on his bed and let his mind wander wherever it wanted to go. Finally, John had time to think.

He clapped the box open and gave out a loud, acted groan.
Which is what happened. They were chasing a petty thief through Soho (Sherlock has already deleted what exactly the women stole) when John slipped on a wet plastic bag, fell down and cracked his head a bit. John was only unconscious for a few seconds, but Sherlock was still close to a heart attack. He ripped his black trousers when he crashed next to his fallen boyfriend, but Sherlock could not have cared less. All that mattered was that John woke up again and complained about people leaving their rubbish on the street.

It would have given him something to do.

He had met Mary at a pub he visited with a couple of his colleagues. Secretly, John never liked these work outings, but his new colleagues urged him to come. Later, Mary confessed to him that she asked a mutual acquaintance of theirs to set them up. John didn’t feel like dating at first, but Mary did not take no for an answer.

John loves the sea, so it’s no wonder that the person he loves most comes from the sea. Not from some small, isolated island, but from a world John cannot enter but imagines a lot anyway.

Sherlock blurts out, pressing his nails into his palm to hide his nervousness.
“I have not seen a single one!
“No, I don’t. Ghost do not exist.
Suddenly, something and very heavy settles around Sherlock’s head. An iron frame is set on his face, with two holes for him to look through. Then, another part is buckled around his mouth. Sir Walter pushes until Sherlock’s lips open with a gasp of pain, and something is slipped into his mouth, over his tongue, to hold it down and prevent him from speaking.

Not that she doesn’t love John — she does, in her own twisted way, but she loves her chosen life more - but sooner or later one of the Holmes brothers (probably the older one) would find out about her not so distant past, and she would be in desperate need of protection.
Sherlock spits the words out.

The crown prince is indescribable handsome, with short blond hair and deep blue eyes, and Sherlock prays that John isn’t too disappointed with him. John carefully puts his hand on Sherlock’s left cheek, and they both breathe each other in for a moment.
noticed that they were somehow invisible to everyone else. The ground was dirty and most of the furniture was broken. There were next to no toys, only some children were huddled together in the corner. They climbed uneven stairs to the first floor and approached a single door.
John says and suddenly kneels in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock can feel John’s anger radiating from him through Sherlock’s blanket.
“I have a fairly good relationship with my neighbours, and I would hate it if you destroyed that, Doctor Watson.
“I’m John Watson.
Finally, done with the restraint, John decided to not wake up the detective and instead just bring him into a nicer environment. He slipped one arm under Sherlock’s bony knees and another around his back. John expected much more difficulty, but the detective felt as light as a feather. John congratulated himself on keeping up with his jogging and arm training, and then carried the detective out of his prison.
“I am so sorry.
training. Of course, they don’t want you to go.
And now he is here, and he is either starving or going mad. It feels like he is the only living person on this planet right now. Who knows, maybe something terrible happened in the outside world, humanity was wiped out, and he is the only survivor.
“It’s okay. I mean, I understand. You were right.
“You will need an identity card, a birth certificate, a graduation paper.
Her cruel voice cut through John like a knife. Mrs. Hudson tried to throw her handbag at the bride, but Molly stopped her, looking frustrated herself. Greg was standing and was prepared to defend Sherlock’s honour.
"We both know you will never be nice, but that is not the point."
It does not surprise Sherlock when the five of them appear on his doorstep and drag him without any means to defend himself into their favourite place, the torture chamber. It is in the basement of the castle and terrifyingly cold in the winter.
Molly relents and shoves him into her place. The blonde is next in line, and Molly gifts him a reassuring smile, so Sherlock is sure he is forgiven.
John chuckles and gives Paddington the long-awaited cup of tea.
Mrs. Hudson arrives, carrying a red box, which is traditionally filled with their trivia quiz questions. “And no peeking.

“Shut up!
Sherlock was just beginning to ask himself if a walk through the mud and rain without an umbrella was preferable to this, when the bell finally ringed.
„I’m new here. The nurse said this is a kind place for children like me, but I’m not so sure of that.“
John swallows. Sherlock apparently didn’t give up as fast as John did.
Sherlock starts first. He sits up and shuffles into John’s lap. He puts some massages shampoo in his hands and starts massaging John’s shoulder and upper body. The two men look at each other, both grateful that they are sharing this moment, that they are alive, but also mindful of the circumstances that happened on this way and the impact the events had on them.
He starts and nervously fiddles with his scarf. “Maybe a medicine book or something?
Sherlock says and continues his exploration.
Someone (who was he kidding, it must have been Mary) had drawn with burning flames the following words into the ground:
"Sherlock, I never expected to be so happy in my life. Everything is fine as it is.“
“Why?
“Money. You are only interested in money.

John teases.

A difficult conversation.
Gladstone is thrilled that his beloved owners are back home.
“John, stay here.
John presses a shy kiss on Sherlock’s throbbing hand, and it is like a demon finally leaves Sherlock’s body. Sherlock clutches John’s hand with the bleeding knuckles. John will stitch him up at home, then they will go to bed — together — and tomorrow they will finally talk about it all. And then they will kiss, properly.
"Are you happy with… what we are?“
“Hold still, or you’ll mess it up. John Watson will be so disappointed in you if you ruin his Christmas present!
It’s cold, he must be shaking. He isn’t shaking. Must have been here for a long time.

“I see that too.
It is certainly not wise to tell so much private information to a stranger, but the genuine concern from this person warms Sherlock’s heart.
“I told you before that these are scenes from your past. You cannot blame me for what you see!
“Shall we go to bed?
Greg sprints to his car that’s parked close to the shore.
“Happy New Year, love.
to the man’s neck. He looked terrified at John, who was waiting from a signal. It was a relatively short fight, and the audience thirsted for more blood. Sure enough, the emperor gave him the sign to kill.
“Let’s be optimistic.
Stepping back into Mary’s light living room felt surreal. How could so much happen in less than two hours? John’s muscles shivered a bit as they warmed up, and he felt Sherlock stir in his arms. He walked them both into the bathroom and set Sherlock carefully down and propped his upper body against the bathtub. In the light, he could finally look at Sherlock properly, and this time nothing prevented him from cursing out.
Sherlock is flattered that John guessed correctly.
“Of course. London may be exciting, but I’m sure I’ll still be bored plenty. I definitely need you at my side.
"Then stop your stupid experiment!“ John screams, frustrated.
“No, but thank you for everything.
Sherlock hit the pillow again, which finally got a reaction from

“Stupid. Should have seen.
The boy mistook his silence for something else. “Not that there is anything wrong with, dating a boy, I mean, it’s all perfectly fine.
“John, oh dear, do you know anything?
John’s classroom is in one of the towers, and Sherlock sprints up the long-winding staircase. Most of the children are already outside, laying in the sunshine, or walking through the grounds, enjoying the good weather. John’s classroom is empty apart from the teacher, and Sherlock takes a curious glance around. The new
was now here too, gray eyes flickering from John to the door.
John clenches his teeth: “Do it to me, please.
“And you can’t speak?

stays behind, patiently waiting for the next guest.
The two assistants emerge and start dragging Sherlock from the stage. The little boy starts crying as the change the code on his collar and hand his documents over to his new owner. Sherlock had never seen a slave in his life, his parents had protected him and Mycroft from this medieval and brutal practice. A fire had destroyed all of that peace, and now Sherlock will never seen his parents nor Mycroft again.

“Sherlock, can I talk with you?
“That is a cool name!
He told himself that Sherlock will be fine. He still had Molly and Irene, his two mermaids friends, and after a while, the merman would move on. Hopefully, Sherlock will find a new boyfriend, although this image is enough to make John grind his teeth in anger.
“Okay.
frowned: “Why should you be worried about me?
When the doctor could hear his breathing slowing down he moved a step aside, grabbed the chair and placed it under his feet. Sherlock would have collapsed on it but John snatched one of his arms around his hip to keep him on his feet. He carefully climbed on the chair too and untied the noose from the hook. Johns arms were immediately around him again and he laid him down on the ground (he must have noticed that Sherlock never wanted to be on that table again).
She puts a much larger batch of letters and handwritten notes torn out of books next to the first collection. “Are all the letters and notes I have received today that demand Professor Holmes must keep his position, plus the dozens of students that interrupted my breakfast, lunch and who knocked on my office door the whole day.
“John, think about what you are doing!
Sherlock shouts over the crying students. The two fighting children are whisked apart by their classmates.
Finally, he is finished and leans back again. He grabs Sherlock’s chin so the detective has to look at the letters, framed in blood:
and your scarf on the bed. You won’t need it any more.

Sherlock throws in while he scans every bit of John’s exposed body.
Sherlock paused. John reached out and put a warm hand against his cheek.
His captor had chosen the short drop for him. He would die slowly and in agony. The man stood on his tiptoes, caressed his cheeks and pressed his (disgusting) lips on Sherlocks. It felt revolting and made Sherlock shake more. This was the last thing he would feel and this monster would be the last person to touch him.

“Are you okay?
“Please do it then.
„What happened to Sherlock?“
“I believe there is a country much bigger than
John. What an ordinary name. How unfitting for this special person.
John asks. Nobody answers him, and Sherlock stares in the sky with a bad feeling. He spies two broomsticks, high above the field, certainly much higher than they are allowed.
“Can you write down the answers? I am afraid my handwriting has turned into a doctor before I did.
“Because I fell in love!
John remembered how they had to shift their moving plans for a couple of days, because Mary had to visit a friend in the country who struggled with her divorce. John even accompanied her to the train station. The soldier now wondered if Mary had used that lie as an alibi to kidnap Sherlock from wherever she found him and hide him in her basement. Which would mean that Sherlock had spent at least three weeks down there, without medical treatment or even sunlight. John’s hands tightened around the car wheel in anger. Maybe Mary was even the cause for Sherlock’s lashes on his back.
