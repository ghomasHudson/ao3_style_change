They smiled at each other for a moment before their attentions were diverted to the kitchen.
Before she could answer, Sherlock rose from the table, taking two cookies as he left. “Mrs. Hudson, it was lovely, but I must be off.”
“Sherlock? Yea, I guess he can be.”
, John.” The two of them had gone through this conversation twice already today. Sherlock would beg, John would insist upon going to Mrs. Hudson’s lunch and Sherlock would protest in silence. Now, Sherlock was lying on his back on the sofa with the Union Jack throw pillow covering his face.
Taking Sherlock’s glass and his own, John arose from his position on the floor and went to the kitchen to refill their drinks. “Let me hear it from you.”
“Warm enough?”
In hearing Holmes’s sonorous voice, I found my body replenished with energy and sprung from my bed. It wasn’t until I began down the stairs that my injuries overtook me, and I half fell down the first flight. I struggled to regain my composition but managed at last to stand upright. When I turned to continue down the rest of the stairs, I was met by the scrutinizing eyes of Holmes which looked at my injuries rather than at me.
I huffed, wishing Holmes could find using his words to be a more valuable tool. It was late, and my bed was tempting me from the other room. However, I could not resist collecting more data on my newfound friend and flatmate. As such, I slid the drawer out from its place and found a folded sheet of paper. It was flimsy from many refolds but otherwise pristine. I read,
“I’m not helpless, Holmes. I should have been able to defend myself.”
“John,” Sherlock said when he heard his flatmate’s footsteps stop. He had his back turned and was emptying shopping bags full of junk food and alcohol and cheap paper hats with the upcoming year printed on them. He placed two bottles, one wine and one champagne, on the counter with an authoritative bang. John didn’t recognize the brand but assumed it was out of his price range.
I wrapped myself tighter in my dressing gown. “I wasn’t aware they sent for you, Holmes.”
There’s no two people in the world he’d rather spend Christmas with.
The last number had been left blank, obviously anticipating a new detail. At finishing my reading of the list, I looked back to Holmes who was still absorbed with his tie which showed no pity to his currently inept hands. The gel in his hair had long ago lost its strength and the stray strands lied limp against his forehead. Compared to the composed detective I had grown used to, this innocent display sent warmth through my chest. I turned out the lamp but left the curtains open as to allow the full moon to illuminate the flat and began walking towards the door of my bedroom.
John, always much more observant than he was given credit for, noticed the work that Sherlock would never admit. “Thank you.”
“Although we could live without life’s few embellishments, would it all be worth it? For instance, you, my dear Watson, are an embellishment of my life. I proved recently that I could live and breathe without you, but did I want to?”
Sherlock gestured to the trunk. “Perhaps you should find out.”
“Good things, I hope,” Erika giggled in between words. “We’re big fans of the blog.” She smiled, flashing John teeth in a meticulously constructed organization.
“Accounts of my old cases. The ones before you came along. You’re always asking about them, so I had Mycroft grab this when he went to visit my parents. I thought you might like to read some and use them in your blog.”
Sherlock sat in his chair without comment, his eyes fixated upon the floor in front of his feet. I noticed the lines above his brow which told a story much like the lines of book. He had aged beyond his years during our time apart, though I may never know the entirety of his trials. He said nothing, but I could hear him warning me against the dangers of putting my heart before logic. I relented.
“You look great,” John said, handing Sherlock his suit jacket. “Like Christmas morning.” When Sherlock rolled his eyes, John could not help but grin in amusement.
John looked at his own hands, folded gently in his lap and back to the one jittering next to him. He reached out and covered Sherlock’s much colder hand with his own. Sherlock snapped his head forward to look at the hands on his knee.
I had not long to plan, for a familiar voice soon graced the halls. “Dora, where is he?”
“You know what? I shouldn’t be surprised.” Violin still in hand, John turned to the window and watched the Christmas traffic in the streets. “How about this? As a Christmas present to each other, you play something for me and I’ll read some of
Pursing his lips, John considered his options. “Nope. Don’t have plans.”
“It’s wrapped in plastic.”
Letting a sigh escape his lips, he began sorting through his clothes to find something appropriate for the night. He put on a shirt he had bought during a holiday sale and tried to pretend he wasn’t influenced by Sherlock’s compliment of the it a few days ago. His best pair of shoes were selected from the back of the closet and he dusted them with the t-shirt he had worn earlier.
Eventually, I coaxed myself into reality. Although the violin playing had dissipated, I was soothed to hear the rumbling of familiar voices down the hall. Just as I was entering the consulting room, Mrs. Hudson was placing our breakfast around a bouquet of roses that were not present the night before. Between Holmes’s return and the defeat of Moran, I had understandably lost track of the days. From the pocket of my vest, I pulled my watch which read February 14th.
“You’re right, it is Christmas. That’s why we’re going to go downstairs and visit with others celebrating the holiday. Besides, we already promised Mrs. Hudson we would at least make an appearance.”
John moved on without comment. “The tree really did liven up the place. Lights at the entrance would too. And it would make it easier to get the key in the door late at night.”
“I’ll do what I can.”
worried when he said you were in the hospital. I told him he better start taking care of you because friends are all we have in the end, you know. Then he grabbed the lights and ran off before I could ask if you were okay.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock replied, still looking at his laptop.
Upon hearing this outburst, the other boxers in the gym began to swarm Holmes, herding us until we were side by side.
On some nights, Sherlock would receive a lead and consider it necessary to investigate without delay. Rarely would Sherlock shake him awake as a result of a night when John was particularly exhausted and hit him so hard with a pillow upon entering his bedroom that Sherlock was knocked to the floor.
“We’ll be there,” John promised, and watched as Sherlock failed to conceal a disappointed sigh. Even John, by far the least observant of the pair, was able to notice that Sherlock trudged up the stairs louder than normal. He winked at Mrs. Hudson who was still holding his arm and listening to Sherlock’s ascent.
“What? Of course not.”
“Oh, John.” Mrs. Hudson shook her head at the sight of the bandage. “I was worried when Sherlock came home asking for Christmas lights, but I was
“Shouldn’t I? I send my most valuable resource to stay the night in a house where I was certain of danger, and I’m somehow surprised to receive a telegram saying he’s been brutally attacked with no word of his condition.”
“With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, I don’t rightly care who you are. You are interfering with an investigation and trespassing on this man’s property.”
promised to leave with Sherlock, together and not separately. He tried to laugh along with the jokes, but he was the first to finish his drink and made an awkward excuse before leaving and taking the stairs two at a time.
“Solve the case?”
“I would.”
“Why shouldn’t I?”
“That’s a good friend you have, aye?” She stressed the word “friend” as if she was unsure if it was the correct wordage.
Before he could formulate a question, John was on his feet and chasing the alleged robber who threw up his hands in submission without a fight. Sherlock handed John the handcuffs he had taken from Anderson’s desk.
“Although the violin is a string instrument, it’s still important to breathe while playing it,” Sherlock whispered to John, his own breath grazing the doctor’s ear.
You cannot meet Holmes without immediately recognizing his grace. On this night, however, he took the stairs to our flat cautiously, counting each one aloud. When I asked why, he murmured about how no detail is too small to a great mind.
We spent the remainder of the day visiting those involved with the case. I believed us to be no closer to solving the problem than we were that morning, but Holmes insisted we were nearing the end. He promised we had only one stop left before we could return to Baker Street for dinner and rest the case until the morning.
One night, John and Sherlock came home from running the streets of London and realized they both were too full of adrenaline to retire to their beds. Without speaking any words between them, Sherlock took the Stradivarius from its perch on the windowsill. He offered it to John who giggled and shook his head. Sherlock shrugged while bringing the violin to his shoulder and improvised a piece to relax them both.
“New Year’s is intriguing thanks to the ones who celebrate it. People change, even just for a few days, all because the Earth went around the sun. Makes life more unpredictable for a while.”
“Is my concussion making me imagine things, or is Sherlock Holmes being nice to me?”
We walked the fields and trails as easily as we strolled along the city sidewalks of London. Holmes would lecture me on the different varieties of moss and their chemical compositions and perhaps even ask my professional opinion on its use in old medical remedies. I was satisfied in simply listening to my friend’s voice without interruption and helping the country-folk whose issues were often overlooked by London authorities.
When Sherlock tired of playing, he joined John on the couch and took his laptop from where it sat on the coffee table. They sat in silence, Sherlock staring at the screen and John at the spot where Sherlock had stood in front of the tree.
Upon feeling the heat of Sherlock’s body, John’s breath hitched in his chest.
“Yes, of course. We’ve heard a lot about you both,” John assured them.
“I have one. -SH”
At night, John would make them both a cup of tea while Sherlock played his violin, hardly acknowledging John for hours. John was used to this and was content with watching Sherlock from the sofa, backlit from the colored Christmas lights that reflected off the shine of his hair and swaying slightly with the rhythm of the music. Sometimes, often unaware of his song choice, Sherlock would play Christmas music. It was in these moments that John thanked himself for buying the tree, even if he did spend days removing sap from his clothing.
It was John who suggested they get a tree. He presented the reasons to Sherlock that went as follows: 1) It would liven up the place and make it feel warmer. 2) Some holiday spirit might even help clients open up while detailing their cases. 3) C'mon Sherlock, it's just a tree.
A disgruntled Sherlock emerged from the kitchen, powdered sugar on his black jacket. The other conversations had resumed, but John was still focused on the kitchen and laughed as he locked eyes with the consulting detective defeated by a land lady with a spatula. His smile fell when the expression on Sherlock’s face filled with anger at the sight of the seat beside John being occupied.
“You liked them,” he groaned and turned the screen to John.
“I would have. I might still do so if he would be so inclined as to make an appearance, for it would surely be his undoing and my sweet revenge.” He smiled deviously at his last words which were taken from the worn sheet of paper he held against the light.
He and the other boxer moved in front of us as to better examine Holmes who had stopped upon hearing his name resurface in the conversation. The boxer clasped his hands together in a sudden realization. “No, I remember it well now. It was a funny name like that.”
Sherlock did not reply for a moment, only smirked and traced the candy cane with his tongue. “Excellent, doctor. Perhaps I needed a medical man all along.”
He squinted. “What’s that?”
John looped his finger through the curve in the candy cane and pulled it from Sherlock’s lips. He slid his mouth along its entirety and pulled it out again, making sure to exaggerate the popping sound as he had seen Sherlock do so often. “What good would you be then?” he asked, passing the candy cane back to Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at the photo even though he was well aware of what it showed. With closed lips, he smiled at the boys he held in his hand. “Class A example.” He slung it forward and it fluttered to the ground between the two of them.
Sherlock reemerged with a black trunk adorned with a brass lock and decorative garnishes that caught the blaze of the fire in their shine. The lock hung open and Sherlock discarded it behind him. He paused for a moment, hand resting on the lid before tossing it back.
It was late, almost past midnight, but John and Sherlock were walking the streets that never tired. Fueled only by John’s “fantastics” and “brilliants,” Sherlock detailed the deductions he had made to conclude the murder of mall owner Regis Thompson was committed by the Santa who had just been hired to take photos with children in the food court. All Sherlock needed was record of the recent changes in personnel before he was forcing Santa (actually named Yusuf Tekin) to confess to being hired by the owner’s wife to stage her husband's death and collect the insurance money.
"Once again, Watson I trust your diagnosis, even if it is self administered. It is good for them that you are alright." He kissed me again, this time firmer and on my lips. "But let it be known to the next ruffian that there will always be two."
, that John almost reached out to stroke his cheek or take his hand. When Sherlock crowded over him as he did so often, he could almost swear Sherlock was waiting for John to pull him closer to meet at the lips.
“Oh, right. ‘He was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Sherlock Scrooge Holmes.’”
John felt a buzzing from his phone.
He lifted the hand to his lips. “But doctor, I can’t disappoint your readers.”
“By all means, doctor.”
“Suppose I should take it down soon,” the latter said through the silence.
Finally, in the afternoon of the next day, Holmes requested my assistance. I was sitting in what had become my chair by the fire of Baker Street while he examined the paper the burglar was evidently so interested in.
“You have potential.”
“And this is my sister Marge and my niece Erika.” Mrs. Hudson was finishing introducing John and Sherlock to the rest of the party who had arrived last on account of Sherlock's tantrums.
Holmes turned his attention to Mr. Wessington. “You did decide to involve the police?”
I knew by reason that his concerns were justified, but sentiment got the best of my emotions. Unresolved feelings towards Mycroft flowed from my mouth, still fresh from discovering his involvement with Sherlock’s absence. To me, he represented nothing but deception.
“And um…you have a family? I mean, a husband? Kids?” John finally gained the nerve to ask.
“The paramedics said he fussed about you for ages. Nothing they did was right according to him.” She sort of laughed as she said this, and John laughed along, not sure what he was laughing at.
John placed his hand on the bandage. He hadn’t thought about the scar.
“If you’re feeling up to it, my dear Watson, I would be much obliged if you’d accompany me to further investigate some leads.”
“Uncomfortable? I don’t get uncomfortable in social situations.”
John attempted to move the conversation back to the case and take his mind off his best friend’s tongue. “I can’t believe we arrested Santa. I take it we aren’t making the nice list this year?”
“Oh, yes. Of course, dear.” She moved out of the doorway and the two began to climb the stairs to the flat when Mrs. Hudson took John’s arm. “Before you go. I’m having a little get together tomorrow with some of the ladies around town for Christmas, and I would love it if you'd come.”
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, trying to refocus his vision on the people around him instead of on the lights. “I knew it was a bad idea to bring you here.”
“I’m serious, Holmes.”
When the kisses grew sloppier and they had both had two more drinks, John fell asleep in the living room for the second time this week. The difference was that this instance was intentional, and he was awake to pull Sherlock closer when he shifted to rest his head on top of John’s chest. Sherlock lied there for quite some time, listening to the breath that filled the man he loved.
As I crossed the room, he looked up at me from his seat on the sofa, his gray eyes catching the moonlight.  "Did you agree with the points on my list?"
Later, John would write in his blog that the worst sound to hear upon waking up is a heart monitor. He won’t write about his disappointment upon finding his flatmate had went home a few hours ago or about the guilt he felt for being angry. After all, the case was far from finished, and Sherlock would never postpone investigating a lead to sit bedside with an unconscious John.
I attempted to lighten the tone. “Gifts? On Valentine’s Day? Either our time apart has changed you or you have much to apologize for,” I teased.
After a moment of entangling limbs and trading places, they landed parallel to the fireplace, Sherlock behind John with his arm draped across the man’s waist.
In reply, he merely set his jaw and turned back to Dora. “And Mrs. Maberley?”
John began to turn around in confusion, but Sherlock rested his hands on his shoulders to keep John facing away from him. When John stilled, Sherlock put one hand over John’s where it rested on the neck of the violin and brought the body of it to John’s shoulder. Sherlock pressed his chest to the expanse of John’s back to better see the fingerboard.
“I think I need some sleep before that.” Sherlock gets up, taking his dishes to the sink.
The man turns a bit, pointing towards the opposite corner. Slowly, he makes his way across the room, Sherlock not taking his eyes off him for a moment as he sets up his meager excuse for a bed.
“Very true. You really are a genius.” John blushes a bit. “What do we do now, then? Any more sword fighting planned?”
Pity.
Even though I don’t care for their reaction anymore, my brain registers the surprised gasp from one of the by-standers, badly covered up with a cough, and the blonde mutters a “fuck me.” I consider turning around and giving him my best “nope”, popping the p. Instead, I move my head just enough to look at my John.
There is paperwork. I hate paperwork more than anything. It is unnecessary, redundant. They would know everything if they only listened to me for once. Instead, they force me to sit in an office for hours and have me repeat it again and again until it’s typed up and ready to sign. They love their signatures. It makes them feel competent in at least one part of their job.
So, for the past half an hour, I’ve been looking at a piece of cloth taken from her blouse, to prove her last hours had been spent at her office. With her boss.
Sherlock glances at him for the first time, then, affronted. “Of course, I solved it, John.” He says. “Solved it the moment I saw the body. Easy. Child’s play. You could have solved it.”
“I don’t think they have those at Tesco’s. But I’ll ask.” He kisses me one more time, before I hear him getting to the door, slipping into his shoes. The sound of his footsteps descends down the stairs and is swallowed by the London traffic, before the front door is fully shut.
“She’s tired, because she has at least one small child at home. She hasn’t slept properly in months.”
I nod. The music starts playing – the fact that it is one of my favourite pieces does not help my overly sentimental state- and our guests stand. My knees feel wobbly, which is an entirely new feeling, but with John walking by my side, his shoulder nudging my upper arm from time to time, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.
“Mostly the fact that you are very sexy,” John grins against my lips. And I want to argue. I want to tell him that I have wrinkles now. That my hair is white and my body is shrinking together. But I know he has aged too and pointing out the signs of my ageing that would make him think he is not attractive to me anymore – the opposite being true – so I bite back my comment.
I didn’t turn as much as I wanted to see him just like that, rubbing at his eyes and blinking the sleep away, eyes dark and skin glowing in the dim light of the single small lamp I had left on. I wanted to see him yawn and then smile, as if doing such a human thing was something he had to be embarrassed about.
“God, even the noises you make while eating are cute.” John butters four slices of toast, adds jam on half of them and leaves the others plain for Sherlock. He arranges them on two plates and places them on the kitchen table.
“It’s called Father’s Day.” Laura chides in. Laura is always right, and Daddy says that people like that tend to be annoying. Papa is the exception, of course, but that’s just because Daddy likes Papa very much. “And that was two weeks ago. My Daddy took me to the Zoo.”
“Thank you for this, John,” Sherlock whispers against the fabric of his head scarf, the warmth of his breath still perceptible against his scalp.
“Thought that might help, you know? Freezing your brain might slow it down.” He grins, tilts his head and snuggles deeper into his coat.
We walk next to each other towards the elevator, my mind thoroughly distracted, when I hear the whisper. They are speaking quietly, but with the intent of me hearing it and I hate how my shoulders tense.
“Quite obvious, isn’t it?” I retort, defensive. She doesn’t seem offended, and I wonder if a groom is allowed just anything on their wedding day; if getting married gives you such special leeway for just one day then maybe I should consider getting married every day. Molly just smiles, not the way she used to smile when she was still in love with me, and I pull her into a hug. She wraps an arm around me.
“You did well, bringing them here. Just…,” His voice is strangely rough, and he clears his throat. “Let’s talk about this tomorrow, okay. We’ll get the basics, as soon as the shops open, and then we’ll see.”
“You know you lack the imagination for that, John. I’m here.” Sherlock’s voice is quiet but laced with the usual arrogance, as he reads his mind again, and John doesn’t know if he wants to punch or hug him. Thankfully, the state he’s in – the fact that he can barely move – means he doesn’t need to make that decision, because in reality he can’t do either..
, John thinks.
“Well, I thought we could just name them John. Simple, short, easy to remember”
The detective pouts, his full lower lip sticking out and John has to lower his gaze for a moment. “Why?” he asks.
“Because I don’t want to traumatise the neighbours or our clients if they overhear you saying things like ‘John, stop biting my toes. John, get off the table. John, get your behind out of my face.”
His knees felt like jelly, but Sherlock wouldn’t give destiny the satisfaction of dropping to the floor. His hand curled around the edge of the kitchen table so he could hold himself up.
“I know that, Papa. But why today?”
“I don’t have wings. Humans don’t have wings. It is essential to the concept of cuddle death; the bees move their wings quickly the way they usually warm or cool the hive, to either defend their home or kill an elderly and incapable queen bee. Humans don’t have wings. I couldn’t cuddle you to death, even if I tried. How obvious.”
I nod at his question, eyes on whichever part of John is closest as he kneels on the floor. His hands are cool, as he cups my face and lifts it just a bit to kiss me. Lovely.
“Oh, Sherlock. Don’t you look lovely!” Mummy makes her way over to me, crushing me with a hug. More and more guests arrive, all wanting hugs and with each outdoing the previous with more and more unimaginative compliments on my suit, I get more nervous. Perhaps, being stuck in a car would have been a better alternative to being out here in the open, with too many people around me, having to wait for John, who is very likely still stuck in that traffic jam. We had planned it like this, him being here first, so he could’ve dealt with all our guests, done the smiling and the hugging. Now, I have to suffer through that. I want John. I have been waiting for him forever, and I need him here, by my side, where he belongs.
“She might.”
John is one of them. He likes crime novels, Doctor Who and has hinted at wanting to go to Cornwall for a bit of hiking. The only person currently in my life who knows how I feel is Mycroft. He is clever, and on good days I can admit that he is cleverer than I am, especially in his choice of occupation. International conflicts are more common than intelligent criminals, he can keep himself busy. Still, he isn’t the one to know how to handle me.
Rosie, once Sherlock let her down to roam free, began looking into every corner, showing off random things she found on the shelves and hanging on the walls. There was so much for her to to explore and for John to rediscover. Isla’s apron was hanging by the door and John touched the chequered fabric carefully.
“Freak.”
Sherlock says his name without looking away, completely focused. “Do we have milk?”
“And I like deducing them. Costumes tell a lot about the inner workings of a person. Their wishes and desires, who they really are,” he says, apparently not wanting to continue that conversation.
“No, he kissed me in the end. Which was very good.”
I know all that, and still, I am almost at the point of trying.
I am bored, horribly so, and John has hidden my gun. I presume he handed it to Mrs. Hudson for safekeeping. She is very protective of her walls so there is no chance I can get it from her, it’s only a short distraction anyway.
“But I bloody fucking care that he kept this from me.”
“I know that. Father’s Day is for Daddy, though. I need Papa to help me make breakfast, and to draw something for Daddy.” Rosie hurries, to catch up with Emma. “And Papa gets his own day. Daddy and I made pancakes for him. He likes those, with a lot of sugar.”
He always has to be prepared for this, after almost two years of eliminating parts of Moriarty’s network. There have only been a few nights spent at safe houses, where he has slept more than a few hours. He can see the results of the sleep deprivation in his body. He’s thinner now than he has ever been, and the circles under his eyes cannot possibly get any darker. So many times he has imagined coming home to London, to John, and how after the initial surprise, John would nurse him back to health. He could hear him complaining about Sherlock not taking care of himself and ordering him to take up a regular sleep schedule. He would look all strict, but secretly pleased, because he would get to be all doctor-y around Sherlock. And Sherlock would pretend to be annoyed, but secretly enjoy the attention.
“Well, I saw there was cake. And movies. I am sure we will find things to do.”
This is not how this was supposed to end. This, Afghanistan, was supposed to be his way back into a normal life, a life that would give him a purpose beyond grieving his best friend. He had tried to find that in London, after the first months of feeling numb, useless, heartbroken.  He had worked more, walked more, even attempted a sleeping schedule. When Mike – where would he be without him – had suggested he could go back to Afghanistan, not as a soldier, but as a support, to help medically, he had immediately fallen in love with the idea, a spark in his chest that he had not felt in so long.
“Well,” Papa turns his head a bit to look at Kathy, whom Rosie has almost forgotten about. “Adults like their paperwork. They like things to be official.” Papa sometimes talks about himself, as if he is not a grown-up. Rosie likes that.
“Oh, well, she might regret wanting children, then.”
Thank you all for the lovely chats we had in the comments.
John knows he’s trapped, long limbs curled around him, and he drops a kiss to the dark curls, fondly. He reaches for his phone and checks his messages, then gets to work.
“I should start another list. ‘What our cats are saying without words’. That one was definitely a ‘feed me, now.’” John grins and follows him. By the time he had the tin with cat food open, two more hungry mouths were waiting. John gets a few head bumps against his shins, scratches a few ears, then decides to use the loo while the kittens feast.
Forever is a word I rarely use, not only because it is an incomprehensible, unquantifiable concept, but because it is used so often it loses all meaning, and by people with barely enough brain cells to know how long thirty seconds are.
That private smile Sherlock only uses on him and Mrs. Hudson, appears on the detective’s face. “Thank you.” He says, and John thinks he would adopt three full grown tigers to the flat if he only got to see that once more.
It's the place I asked John to marry me and therefore has remained special for us throughout the years. Over the last year, John turned the house into a home, just like he did with Baker Street: another hidden talent of his. So many of our belongings have accompanied us here from 221B. I never thought I'd leave that flat, but that changed after Mrs. Hudson passed away. The thought stings, still. I miss her every day, and it has nothing to do with morning tea or biscuits. Her loss has shaken us both, has made us aware of our ageing bodies, and had sealed the decision to leave London. It was a significant change, a difficult but necessary one to make, but with John by my side, even the toughest challenges just seem to fall into place.
He expects Sherlock to be full of energy, buzzing with the adrenaline that a successful case brings – John knows that buzz firsthand and wishes he could have joined him. Sherlock is most beautiful then, glowing even, and when he slowly calms down, sipping a cup of tea John has made for him, he seems so calm, almost vulnerable and John secretly enjoys those moments.
John slumped into the pillow with a frustrated huff. “I know, Sher. It was a bloody joke.”
“It’s a bit mean.” John says, and a person less trained at hiding their reactions might have jumped at how suddenly he speaks. Instead, I can redirect that surprise into a seemingly uninterested hum. He is behind me, having moved without my notice and I close my eyes when he presses three quick kisses to the nape of my neck. “How you look so beautiful in moments where me getting all hot and bothered over you is completely inappropriate.”
John starts assessing his body. He can’t see much under the hospital gown, so he starts carefully moving each muscle, trying to prepare himself for shoots of sharp pain. There is a dull throb in his shoulder that spreads to his neck and chest. He can feel his fingers are bruised but not broken, as he moves them and the same goes for his toes. He wants to attempt assessing his legs, but the thought alone is exhausting. Instead, John lets himself relax back into the mattress, as much as that is possible. He could be worse off, he knows. He was in worse shape when he came here, of that he is sure.
I hear the tiny step forward, as he presses his chest fully against my back, arms adjusting to lay on my hips where they bend on the stool and the buttons of his shirt tangible through his jumper and my shirt, as he nuzzles at my neck, lips wet from when he has kissed them prior.
I hate it. It is terribly dull and there are other things I would prefer doing after a successfully solved case where the girl was returned to her parents unharmed.
“Bad day?” He says, tilting his head. He looks lovely from this angle, which should be impossible, and I am a little less bored just from looking at him. It takes me a little longer from down here to deduce every single one of his sixteen, no seventeen patients. Even he found them dull, and his tolerance for people exceeds mine by far.
When he mentioned it over take-away while the three of them were curled up on the sofa, the detective reacted differently than John had expected. Instead of a non-committal hum or a spurt of facts about some murder he had solved in Scotland, Sherlock looked at him, and said “Have fun” in a way that was too neutral to be honest.
Sherlock grumbles a yes, then flops into one of the chairs and John pushes the plate in front of him.
It's said that the fandom is slowly dying- and who could blame people for loosing their patience. Sometimes, I think so too, and I wonder why I keep obsessing over those two idiots. But after only posting two chapters of this story, I have gotten so many comments and kind words from you, who love their love as much as I do. Thank you so much, my lovely readers! <3 I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
John’s face burst into a smile, eyes wet with tears. “Thank god.” He mumbled, pulling Sherlock tight.
“I think someone is desperately trying to reach you.” She comments, and I retrieve my vibrating phone from my coat pocket.
“Because I was scared he wouldn’t like kissing me.”
That tiny hope, that John’s name was on the letter, died within Sherlock, his stomach tying into even tighter knots.
“Because I love you very much, Rosie and I wanted us to be a family, I wanted for everyone to know we are a family.”
“Well, not for lack of reasons,” John says, nibbling at my chin. In revenge, I stab my finger into that incredibly ticklish place in his ribs. Another advantage of having shared two decades together: I have learned all these things about John. He breathes a laugh, flinches away and I lift my hands in a peace offering.
*gemein= mean
“Exactly.” He presses his lips to the corner of my mouth, and I turn my head to get a kiss he doesn’t deserve.
A brisk nod, and John can see the anger at whoever did this plainly written onto his face. “They need special formula for kittens, but regular milk will have to do for now.”
Sherlock’s skin is a bit too clean – not that Sherlock minds– with a gold ring on every finger and a fake earring in his left ear. His pale eyes seem more piercing now, and only when he steps closer does John realise the man is wearing dark eyeliner. God, it looks sexy. John wants to take all of that stuff off him immediately. Minus the make-up.
The biggest change he sees is in Sherlock, though. The self-proclaimed sociopath interacts with Mykie, Graham and Hudders in such a loving way, that John has to stop what he is doing a lot of times just to watch them.
And then, everything had gone awry, and maybe John should have known. Parties were just not for Sherlock: too much to take in; too many drunk people neither of them particularly liked; Anderson making one too many cruel comments. They had left after just over an hour, and Sherlock had pouted for days afterwards. He loved Halloween, and it had been ruined.
Thank you all for your lovely feedback :* It's been too long since I last wrote something
They had some snacks under the old apple tree, enjoying the sun that was already pleasantly warm and John felt better with any minute, listening to Sherlock’s theories on the Loch Ness monster of all things.
Sherlock wanted to kiss him, until his entire world was reduced to John, taste, smell, feeling, sound.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looks thin and tired, his curls long enough for him to wear tied back. It is the power of the white coat, and the way he confidently holds himself that fooled everyone – and for a moment, even John – into thinking he is an intern. The disguise melts away as soon as he notices John’s eyes on him. With a few large steps, Sherlock is by his side. And John does not know how to feel or what to believe.
Sherlock kissed him, softly this time. His wonderful John. Optimistic, loyal John.
“Oh, have mercy, great Captain,” John begs, as he is dragged to the coffee table. Sherlock motions for him to get up on it and John shrugs, guessing today is the best day to be just as ignorant of their furniture as Sherlock is.
When a queen bee’s reign ends due to old age or illness, the worker bees end her life in an unusual way. Known among beekeepers and etymologists as “balling” and colloquially as “cuddle death,” the worker bees swarm over her body en masse. The blanket of workers raises the queen’s temperature and the ensuing hyperthermia kills the queen.
“He still is stupid, some days.” Rosie nods, which makes Papa chuckle.
“Soulmate.” Sherlock spat, making the words sound like a curse.
The words warm John’s heart, the persistent love he has for this man bubbling up to the surface. It makes his heart beat just a bit faster, pinkens his cheeks and makes his palms go sweaty.
The silk turns into threads and the spot on it into particles as I zoom in, revealing the beauty of the small – another metaphor that can be transferred to John, even though he would call me a git for it- I should lose myself in my work, instead I find myself glancing up just a minute later, John now standing by the open fridge trying to figure out what in it is edible. He does so by resting an arm at the door, just an inch above his head, skimming the shelves one by one and pulling a few of the plastic containers out, peaking in. Even I, observant as I am, have not figured out yet which criteria he uses for that as there is no particular pattern to what he does. It fascinates me endlessly to watch him.
Slowly, he moves his hand away and John takes a deep breath. His heart is pounding in his chest.
Thank you to my amazing beta reader <3
John Watson slips his hand in mine.
“Hmm, Graham for the grey one.”
Having lived with the detective for three years –with a two-year break- John knows that the object currently holding Sherlocks attention could be anything. A human head, or the contents of a rubbish bin, John is fully awake by now.
We make it up the stairs and onto the sofa, my head resting on his chest, he reaches out and hands me the paper back.
Rosie shakes her head. “Daddy likes kissing you a lot, stupid Papa.”
We sit down on one of the benches in Regent’s park. John sits close to me, hands in his pockets to warm them.
The ginger kitten is still at her spot behind the chair, eyes fixed to the potential food source, while his siblings seem more interested in the belt from Sherlock’s bathroom, which is hanging off the desk. Little grey is pawing at it first, before jumping back a bit.
“Morning.” John greets Sherlock with a soft smile. “Toast?”
That is John, small-brained, normal John Watson, lovely, marvellous John Watson.
John must have walked past a dozen shop windows decorated with pumpkins and skeletons in the last few weeks, without noticing. It’s been a busy time, admittedly, with September bringing a new flood of colds he had to deal with at the surgery, and the two cases he had assisted Sherlock with, which had brought sleepless nights. He loves being busy, loves that life they lead, even though it means he does not get much time with Sherlock to just be together as a couple. They have found their routine, though, and John is looking forward to take-away and cuddles on the sofa, when they pass the poster at the Yard.
“And then you got married.” She knows, having heard the story a lot, as she looked at the photos with Daddy.
“I’m not tired, John.” I protested, stopping shortly before the opened bedroom door and forcing him to do the same. John turned, squeezed my hand - just what I wanted.
“I would never have the audacity to say that out loud, John.” Sherlock grinned, and John took the excuse of brushing a crumb of bread off his coat to let his fingers rest against his collar bone for a bit. Their gazes met for a moment, before they both looked away, and the flutter in John’s belly was back, a familiar companion by now.
And then, he thinks, what if it’s not? If Sherlock somehow survived this, and pretended to be dead for over a year… The anger explodes in him like a bomb, filling his veins, masking the hurt and betrayal he really feels. He wants to shout and to throw things at this—.
“You can give me your answer,” John cupped his face in his hands. “And then we’ll open the letters. I love you.”
John had started a list a few days after the kittens had moved in. The working title so far is ‘funny things Sherlock said to/about our cats’. He isn’t planning on publishing it, but he wants to remember, and maybe share it with Lestrade or Molly, just for fun. On the other hand, those intimate moments might only be for him to keep. He feels that he needs to protect that vulnerable side of Sherlock, to keep it hidden from the world outside. It’s a silly notion, Sherlock is an adult, the cleverest man John has ever met. It is not the brain that John wants to keep safe, but his heart.
“And what? Decorating a tree is a better use for them?”
It was long after dinner before we were alone again. Holmes puffed on his pipe in a heroic fashion, having conquered even the most complicated of the day’s headaches. I sat opposite and looked over my notes until my eyes grew weary.
I turned to face him, and he examined me for some time, fingers hovering above my ribs and every bruise on my body. I did my best to explain how long each would take to heal to which he blankly nodded. When he reached the bruises and cuts on my face, he hesitated before instead placing his hands on my hips and pulling me in to place a kiss on my cheek, one so soft that I wondered if I had actually felt it or only wished to. As I looked up to meet his eyes, I again saw the flames, but this time they warmed without burning.
Sherlock secretly chose to play his violin close to the tree. As a child, he always had fake trees as real ones leave firs on the carpet that his mother fussed about for an entire holiday season once before Sherlock was born. Mycroft told the story to him one Christmas Eve, about how he woke up one morning and the tree he had spent hours picking out had just disappeared. It was replaced by a brand new false pine and extra presents for little Mycroft.
It was not often that I heard Holmes contradict his own words. “How so?”
Studying John’s face for traces of a lie, Sherlock revealed no emotion of his own. Finally, his mouth opened into a grin. “Good. Quite good.” He paused and rocked back on his heels, looking over his loot. “Oh, one more thing.”
Once inside the gym, Holmes made directly for Dixie who spotted me instantly upon entering the room. At first, I had planned to remain by Holmes’s side, but in seeing Dixie’s wicked smile, I opted to linger near the ring and keep watch of the others.
“Just the one.” He leaned closer to John, his voice a near whisper. Outside, the voices of people in the streets increased in volume. The clock read 11:59.
“The first fire occurred in…”
“Do any of us really like our jobs?”
family home, not just your consulting offices.”
“You know better, old boy. One of us bruised up is enough. What good would two be?” I asked outside as Holmes loosened his tie.
“Yep.”
“The tree.”
“A man who can’t please his wife, how very telling. Come along, Watson.”
The vampire case is "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire."
The matter of my lodgings was almost settled until I entered 221B one morning to find Holmes and his older brother waiting for me in the sitting room. Mycroft explained it would be in our best interest to postpone my move. With Sherlock’s name back in the papers, we were under constant scrutiny, and he feared what may happen if our true relations were discovered.
A few hours later, John was nearly finished with the tree and moving to the last of the candy canes when he noticed the entire box was missing. He had never heard Sherlock move from the sofa, but when he turned around, Sherlock was lying on his back with five candy canes in his mouth at once.
“This taken?” Erika asked, once again using her smile to her advantage. John was more than happy to pull out the chair for her.
“You don’t even have a Facebook.”
“Play something for me,” he requested.
I gasped to regain my breath. “Anything?”
“Can’t. Case.” Sherlock gestured to the laptop on his lap.
“What?”
He accepted his luck and the offer in regards to the other room at 221B. Since then, John has laid down his life for the detective and would again with no hesitation. He’d even follow him on a case and get his head smashed by a deranged criminal with a baseball bat which, as he now knew from experience, would lead to the hospital bed where he currently lay.
Letting out a shaky breath, John placed his chin on the chin rest before him. Sherlock brought the bow to the strings and demonstrated how to properly hold it and produce a sound. John giggled within learning two notes, realizing Sherlock was teaching him the chorus to Jingle Bells.
Sherlock touched his own head and John mirrored, feeling a bandage at his hairline.
John made a mental note to clean out his friends’ list. “Just come with me. Please? We can leave whenever you start feeling uncomfortable.”
“Your bag, Dr. Watson.” At the end of his extended arm, my surgery bag dangled from the tips of his fingers. I exchanged a kiss for the bag and left the room, our departures always quick in order to be as painless as possible.
Sherlock refrained from telling John that his inability to connect the key to the hole was not from the darkness but from his deteriorating eyesight in his older age. After all, Sherlock had no issues with unlocking the door. Instead, he replied, “The flat is where I run my business, not a suburban family home.”
I slid my fingers into his hair with the attempt of a soothing hand and fixated my gaze on the road leading to the estate. With his warmth enclosed against my own, I began.
John reminded himself to update his readers about Sherlock’s ever growing knowledge of the solar system. “What about you? Do you have any resolutions?”
“Get rid of you! My dear Watson, never. I’m simply saying you should never doubt the power of two.” He moved closer to me and brought his hand to the bruise that still throbbed from being thumped. I knew his aim was not to hurt me, but I flinched as a natural reflex. He pulled his hand away as if I had screamed out in pain.
“Young man, you put that back!” Mrs. Hudson could not be seen from the dining room, only heard. “Eat the food first, then you can have as many sweets as your tiny body can hold.”
“The solar system was making my mind far too cluttered. I had to get rid of it when I met you.” With his final statement, he poked his finger into my chest. I instinctively grasped his wrist, but he only smiled.
“For setting up the tree.”
“That’s disgusting,” John warned.
Sherlock replied with a sigh and slumped shoulders.
As he continued, he placed his hand on my knee with a deliberate and delicate touch. “Worse still, in a time where I should have been offering comfort, I hadn’t been able to so much as look at you in fear that I’d break and embarrass us both in front of all of Harrow and Scotland Yard.” He took his deerstalker from his head and tossed it across the cab. “Now, that wouldn’t be very fitting of your emotionless detective, would it? If I had just been there…”
I heard him rise from his chair and walk towards where I was standing. I had my back turned, but I could feel his eyes scrutinizing every inch of my exposed skin.
“Shut up,” Sherlock ordered, ripping the suit jacket from John’s hands. He looked back into the mirror and tried to ignore the blush forming in his cheeks.
“I can’t tell by looking, sorry.”
“Unless of course-"
I tipped my hat at the men, attempting to conceal my smirk. Holmes was already halfway down the drive, and I had to trot to keep up with his elongated gait. “You’re not staying on the case?”
He stood at the door and felt lost in front of his own home. Erika had answered his question, but he did not remember her answer. He had barely said goodbye to her before leaving the party. Surely if she was unattached and interested, she would find him on Facebook. Surely he should care more if she did.
“Maybe.” Sherlock takes another sip of his tea, hiding his face behind his mug.
John forces his eyes onto the screen, focusing on the bullet points that he has written so far. He takes a sip of tea, hoping for a moment it will taste different, weird maybe, so his mind can stray away from the dark thoughts that will surely keep him up tonight. He starts reading, mug still in hand.
“John asked me to sign the adoption papers when he asked me to marry him. It was also his idea to celebrate the day every year.”
He knows, as soon as he gets in the door, what mood I am in, sitting in my chair, feet up and head almost touching the floor. Even upside-down I can see he’s tired. He has been working a lot, something about sick colleagues and maternity leaves. He has circles under his eyes; his shoulders are a bit slumped down. I know he wants a hot shower and take-away. Instead, he puts his bag down, comes over to me.
When John returns from the shops, I have relocated to the sofa. He comes in, footsteps only barely heavier than when he left, stops briefly at the door, then walks up to the kitchen. I can hear him putting away a few things, before the sound of chopping something from earlier continues. He left his half-finished supper to give me space, this wonderful, considerate man. I don’t move, listen to him, and think about how happy he makes me.
I follow John Watson out of the door, my signature neatly placed on the dotted line and his sass has improved my mood immensely. I will need to give something back to him with all he has done for me today. He’s easy to please, a simple man when it comes to certain things. Also, Oral Sex makes him fall asleep quickly after. He needs sleep, and I want to taste him badly. The thought makes my mouth water and gives me even more reason to leave Dimmock’s office quickly.
“It is quite fascinating how people are convinced of its existence. They want her to be real.” Sherlock ended his monologue, grabbing another piece of toast to offer to Rosie. She took it from him, but decided she would rather eat it in his lap, so she crawled over, resting her head against his chest to look up into the branches of the large tree.
The registrar, a blonde woman in her forties, greets the wedding party. I glance at her out of the corner of my eye, my focus always on John. His eyes seem even bluer, now that there are tears in them and he seems to be unable to stop smiling. I want to kiss that smile, to feel it against my lips as I melt into him. I am so fixated on my John’s face that I almost miss the registrar beginning her speech. Even as she continues to talk, I only register a few keywords and phrases, few but enough to tune her out just to enjoy the sight of John’s radiant smile.
“Didn’t plan on doing this again,” John says, his own voice sounding strange in his ears. He tries humour, but fails, fingers digging into the detective’s skin as another wave of pain hits him. To his surprise, Sherlock squeezes back.
“And you still haven’t tried to kill me,” I quip, eyes fluttering open to catch his grin. He doesn’t disappoint, eyes glinting with amusement. Bluest of blues, especially intense against his now-tanned skin.
“Hmm yes, that is a risk I am willing to take.” John  loosened his grip and stepped towards the bed. He crawled under the duvet, which was all the invitation I needed and I pillowed my head on his chest.
The realisation came like a punch to the face.
He’s not going to shoot the blond police officer, of course. He is going to turn to her, smile his dangerous smile- more threatening than looking down the barrel of a gun- making her knees weak with fear and mine with arousal.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded “I want that life with you, John. I will marry you.”
There is a nudge against his ankle and John looks down to find the grey kitten looking up at him with big eyes. “Well hello. You scared the hell out of me.” He leans down to pet her, she rubs her tiny head against the inside of John’s palm and it does not take more for John to fall in love with her. “You definitely are the cutest stray Sherlock has ever brought here. Not that the drug dealers and homeless people put up much of a competition.” He strokes behind her ears.
After returning from the bathroom, which now has the addition of a litter box- the poshest one he has ever seen, all black and silver- John decides to make breakfast, just in case Sherlock decides to wake up in the next half an hour – he is used to uneaten toast and scrambled eggs gone cold. Still, he has not given up on feeding Sherlock Holmes over the years.
“Case, John,” he beams, immediately making his way to the door and opening it with a gesture that says ‘not without you though’. John gets up and quickly blows out the candles, before he picks up the tricorn.
“ I Can’t believe… Can’t believe she’s not going to come out of that door.” John stepped in front of said door, touching the wood of the old, heavy frame. The large hand on his shoulder was an immediate source of comfort and he leant into the touch a bit more as he scrambled for the key in his pocket.
John comes in from through the kitchen, putting the kettle on before he steps through to the surprisingly quiet living room. Sherlock is there already, he can hear the old floors creak and the rustle of his coat, but there is no yelling or enthusiastic violin playing going on.
“Yes,” John pointed the letter in Sherlock’s direction. “My bloody, fucking, father. He took it. Opened it. Decided he didn’t like my bloody soulmate. And kept it from me. For twenty, fucking years. Because he’s a fucking homophobe. Thought one gay child was enough, probably. I want to punch him. I never fucking did, but I want to, now. He kept my bloody letter for me.”
“Well, he did spare us a trip to the pet shop.” John shrugs. “Do you have names for them already?”
“There is no time for explanations, John. In short, I’m not dead. But I might be, if the rest of Moriarty’s network find out I’m here. So, no shouting, if you please.”
“How about Hudders, then, if we want to keep the pattern.
My first stop is John’s laptop. Password: Shergetoffmypc. I check my email, but the most interesting thing is a missing parrot.
“We let him sleep. Some nights, he would join us, he looked very cute in his pyjama’s, I found.” Papa smiles at that, and Rosie knows he is thinking about Daddy in Pyjama’s and hair that sticks up in all directions.
Papa nods at that. “Yes.”
His chuckle seems to echo in my rib cage. “Still not over the cuddle death thing?”
Something so simple, and yet it took me almost two hours to solve it. My lovely John realising he was a distraction with his puttering around, leaving me to myself when I needed it, I haven’t deserved his understanding at all.
The old man’s sandpaper voice pulls him from his musings. From a string of Czech words, he can hear one clearly.
Mike, thankfully, doesn’t comment on my behaviour, even though I’m sure it is obvious to him. Instead, he smiles that smug smile he has had on his face ever since John and I told him we had decided to tie the knot. He is – and I cannot blame him- quite proud of the pivotal role he played in our relationship as the mutual friend being the man who introduced us, and John insisted he undertake the role of best man. I didn’t mind, since the only alternative would’ve been my brother, whom I didn’t want to invite at all. That he would be there was, again, John’s work.
They are wrong.
“Hmm, the only reason you married me, anyway,” I say.
“I thought we would take a little walk.” Papa helps her buckle up.
“Oh?”
John is so deeply integrated into the work, both as my conductor of light, and as a great shot with a vicious right hook who tackles men -and women- no matter their size all in my defense. He protects me with all he can without question, and this loyalty is surely more than I deserve.
He gets started as soon as the cab with Sherlock in it drives around the corner. It was hard to keep this a secret over the past few days, not only because he lives with the world’s most observant man, but also because he wasn’t entirely sure that he should. Sherlock has been in a sulky mood all week, sulking on the sofa most days. And John knew this was not just a post case low, but that the thirty-first of October had something to do with it, not that his boyfriend had ever mentioned Halloween once. Lesson learned from last year, John supposed, and he was tempted more than once to kiss that head of dark curls and promise that they would have a good time this year.
“Into your soulmate,” John stroked his thumb along the line of Sherlock’s jaw. “then we had a good life together. If… if there is a different name in that bloody letter, then they can bloody well enough wait their turn. “
Dull.
Bad days become more bearable when they start off with John lips against my temple. The thought that he did kiss me when I was still asleep brings a smile to my face, even as my hands touch the pillow long gone cold. I know that today is going to be difficult. My mind goes from groggy to buzzing within minutes. Our bed is too warm suddenly, and I stumble to the living room.
“Why?”
“Let’s… I’ll show you the garden.” John said, clearing his throat. He picked Rosie up, her familiar scent an instant comfort, and walked to the sliding glass doors and into the garden.
*Ja= yes
John’s lips were on his, the kiss almost brutal in its despair, teeth licking against each other, lips crushing together until they felt numb from the pressure. They clung to each other, their fingers curled in hair and suit jackets, tearing, wanting, needing.
“We have to drive a bit. Grandma’s old friend owns a few ponies. I used to visit a lot as a child.” Papa closes the door and gets into the driver’s seat. “Did you know that horses….”
When they called him, John felt regret about not having talked to auntie Isla more often after he learned that she had given him her small house near Inverness. As a child, he had spent most of his holidays there, running around the meadows and playing by the brook with Harry clinging to his coat tails. Those were his fondest childhood memories, far away from their parent’s fights.
When he returned an hour later, he found Sherlock lying on the sofa and the tree immaculately placed near the fireplace. It was so straight, he swore Sherlock had to have used a level. A tape measure still sat on the mantle from when Sherlock measured the distance between the fireplace and the wall, making sure the tree sat exactly in the middle.
Sherlock nodded and moved to open the door, but it swung open before he grasped the knob.
The problem with buying a tree so late is that most of the ornaments are already sold out, and the stores have no intention of restocking. John managed to find one box of bulbs behind a nutcracker display, but the rest of the tree would have to go bare unless he found another solution. Luckily, the store was stocked with every flavor of candy cane imaginable. John grinned to himself as he loaded the cart.
“I suppose it’s best I be off,” I decided at last. The cloud of smoke across the room hummed in agreement.
The days following Christmas were filled with gifts a plenty for Sherlock. Bomb threats. Blackmailing. Bodies disappearing from the morgue. Oh, it was Christmas indeed.
He let out a sigh, sounding bored with the possibility. “Not formally, I suppose. But you would not object to staying in town for a few more days?”
Mr. Wessington spoke in a matter fitting for a man of his stature, with a rusty voice and certainty. “Yes, you know how it is. A man has to please the women sometimes.”
“Thank you, Dora. You have done well.”
“What were wrong with mine?”
Coming soon: The New Year's chapter...
I hesitated for a moment before releasing his wrist and clearing my throat. “And what were you making room for? The Jefferson Hope case, I presume?”
“Alright, that’s enough.” John stepped away from Sherlock’s embrace and returned the violin to its master.
“Well, maybe he’d be a better fight than his biographer.” Dixie hypothesized, using his thumb and forefinger to flick the bruise that possessed most of the right side of my face.
His sentence was cut short by the cab arriving at Baker Street to which my exhaustion greeted wearily. After entering the flat, we went our separate ways, him to his chemistry table and me to my medicine bag. I cautiously removed my shirt and the wrapping around my ribs, sensing Holmes’s eyes with every movement. I would have left the matter alone, but I could sense it lingering in his mind.
Holmes did not speak to me for the rest of the day. I stood by for his instruction but received none. The most help I could offer was in recounting my story of the burglary to the authorities and Holmes who sat across the room staring into the fire. I could see nothing in his vacant eyes except for gleam casted off the flames. When I reached the point as to my fight with the intruder, Holmes rose from his chair and left the room in a hurry, explaining he needed to speak with the servants. The only clue we had from the night was a torn sheet of paper that Mrs. Maberley had snatched from the burglar. It spoke of pain endured by both mind and body, and I couldn’t help but smile at the irony.
The cab stopped in front of the boxing club, and my ribs protested against seeing the men inside, one of which I knew to be the cause of my injuries. My mind returned to Holmes’s threat in 221B during our conversation of the revolver. I took his hand for the first time since the start of the case.
I shot him a look but was contented with not asking why this was of importance. I was accustomed to receiving all the facts at the end of the case, when Holmes’s mind was clear and there was nothing more to do than sip whiskey and lounge by the fire.
Sherlock looked at John in confusion. “We have?”
When Holmes returned from his supposed death, I immediately suggested I sell my practice and resume residence at 221 Baker Street. Although I was still bitter from Holmes’s betrayal, I clung to every moment with him, knowing the pain that came with the alternative. As such, I tried everything in my power to pick up our lives where they left off before that fateful day at the Reichenbach Falls.
"I could think of better uses for you," John muttered.
“It doesn’t matter whose boot killed Douglass Maberley. You’re all guilty!”
“We’ll rest here. We have just short of half an hour before Mrs. Wessington arrives and the advantage in height gives us a favorable view of both the stable house and the main entrance. You do have your revolver?”
“Dr. Watson?” the officer asked. “Like in the stories?”
Selecting one of the few candy canes left on the tree, Sherlock collapsed into his chair and lowered his eyebrows, struggling to remember the details of a case solved decades ago. “Mr. Ferguson had a son with his first wife and then remarried fifteen years later after her death. His second wife gave birth to another son to which the eldest was immensely jealous. Thanks to Mycroft, I had become rather an expert on recognizing sibling jealousy.” He had intended to complete the story but John interrupted with his own theory.
I only nodded. In his acknowledging of my injuries, I became aware of my ribs aching beneath their wrap for the first time in hours. “I’ll just be a moment,” I promised, rising from my seat to redress my wounds.
“Unfortunately, crimes such as these can only be proved in the act,” my companion sighed.
He smiled with closed lips and averted his eyes from my own. With the crocheted blanket around his shoulders, he unfolded himself onto the sofa, slender limbs hanging over the edges. I understood this as my permission to leave and ran a hand through his hair before turning away.
“There’s one thing you haven’t explained.”
His lips uplifted into a genial smile. I admired their tint in which I could only compare to the pink that blends a sunset. However, whereas a sunset represents the end, Holmes’s lips portray the beginning. As such, I find myself preferring to admire the latter.
Settling for the only chair left, Sherlock slouched slightly in his seat but pretended to be unbothered. Only John, hyperaware of Sherlock’s impeccable posture and manners could notice a difference.
“That’s a good point. Do I need braces?” John showed her his teeth jokingly, earning a laugh from Erika.
I had often written of Holmes’s machinelike manner in dealing with others, but the disregard he showed for me hurt far worse than the injuries I sustained. It was true that he could disengage his emotions to better solve a case, but I found the times in which he worked with passion to be more of note. Therefore, you can imagine my disappointment to find I was just a weapon in Holmes’s artillery, nothing more.
“Yes, well the flat is
“Poison,” said John with certainty.
“You promised -SH,” the screen read.
The two looked at each other in silence for a moment, John with knowing eyes and raised brows, Sherlock in denial.
We spent the day solving cases from the comfort of Baker Street as clients flowed in from all corners of the world. Their luggage contained problems that had long awaited the great mind of the recently returned detective. In these moments, Holmes seemed most relaxed and was even prone to outbursts of excitement if given a peculiar enough case.
Afterwards, they walked in a companionable silence, looking at the sidewalks where watchers of a Christmas parade had lunged for candy a few hours before. Occasionally, the two would bump shoulders or brush arms, but they mentally blamed it on their tired state rather than acknowledge the comfort they felt by the brief touches. The only time they separated fully was when they passed an unclaimed candy cane and Sherlock bowed to pick it up.
“It was like pulling teeth to convince you to put a Christmas tree up.”
“Then by all means.”
"Like getting the bare spots at the top."
Sherlock placed a hand on John’s inner thigh. “Happy New Year, John.”
“They didn’t know any better. They didn’t know better because they didn’t know how much I care for you. I’m afraid I gave Dora quite the shock when I ran in with tear-soaked eyes.”
“But you will still look very…nice,” recovered Sherlock as he attempted to reassure John.
I thought back to the photograph Miss Wessington had shown us of her with her parents. He did tower over his wife and daughter who were of average height.
With my walking stick in one hand and my other holding Holmes’s arm, we searched the fields overlooking the Wessington estate for any signs of footprints or other human life. Stopping within view of the front door, Holmes laid out the blanket he had wrapped around him and motioned for me to sit.
“Oh, and doctor? You may find your revolver to be of use.”
“Orthodontist. Dull,” Sherlock muttered.
John looked down at the hardwood beneath his feet. Marks and chips graced every square foot of the flooring. “A pity,” he said under his breath while unpacking the decorations he had bought for the tree.
Admittedly, the robber did not take much of value, and Sherlock normally would give it a 2, but the case had gone from “not Lestrade’s division” to “Lestrade’s division” when a few victims became hospitalized. Within minutes of looking at one of the houses, Sherlock cleared the scene of all remaining officers, knowing the vents had been rigged to emit toxic fumes. Bad news for the families, fantastic news for the gunshot ridden walls of 221B.
“It’s New Year’s Eve.”
Although I rarely publish them, Holmes often makes miscalculations in attempting to solve a case. Sometimes it can be as little as overlooking a mud splash on a cadaver’s trousers- other times it can be as crucial as not noticing a gun in a criminal’s coat pocket. On this night, he had misdiagnosed his own tolerance for alcohol.
Before leaving the room, I took the pen from his desk and wrote in ‘Hamish” underneath the H. I went to refold the paper and return it to the drawer, but the empty number thirteen again caught my eye. With a wavering hand, I wrote,
Since Sherlock didn’t bother replying, John once again devoted his attention to Erika and the small talk between them. Once or twice he heard others at the table attempting to include Sherlock in their conversations, but he would only reply with one or two-word answers, more for their sake than his own.
“But you bought us paper hats and champagne today.”
Once outside, I found our man in the gazebo, bent over the desk where Mrs. Maberley’s grandson had once sat writing his book. Upon noticing my presence, he straightened his spine to reveal the true marvel of his height. I recognized him at once to be Steve Dixie, the man who had threatened Holmes against meddling in Harrow’s business that very morning. The visit had been a short and unpleasant one, for he had lifted Holmes against the windowsill, and I had threatened him with the fire poker.
Sherlock stopped bouncing and relented through gritted teeth. “Yes.”
I had expected the night to pass without complications, but when the clock struck one, I heard a ghastly scream from downstairs. I rushed to the source to find Mrs. Maberley lying at the bottom of the stairs, yelling for me to run after our intruder.
“Hmm?”
He gave one of his signature sharp laughs before shedding his jacket and collapsing onto the sofa. “My desk, second drawer down, righthand side.”
Of all the cases we had encountered throughout the years, perhaps my most preferred were the ones in which my companion and I took to the countryside. The slower pace allowed Holmes’s mind to relax, and he relished in predicting the habits of each innkeeper and farmer. We pretended to be inconvenienced by cases that required us to leave London, but the change in scenery was often welcomed among us.
“Indeed, Watson. What good would two be?” He snapped as we crawled into a four-wheeled cab.
In an attempt to make Lestrade loose-lipped with Scottish whiskey, he forgot to gauge his own intake. Every time he poured Lestrade a drink, the inspector would insist on Holmes refilling his own glass. By the end of the night, Lestrade had decided upon staying in his office, but Holmes was guided home by my steady arm.
“You have plans.”
I settled for this, knowing it was as close to a promise as I was to receive.
When the food was set, John allowed himself to relax and be convinced that he was under no responsibility to Sherlock. At the present, his only concern was being involved in the conversation. He told himself it was Christmas spirit, not an attempt to better know Erika.
“To be fair, I never did agree to the Christmas tree, but it did grow on me.”
“They have a considerable amount of help on the property. Servant? Stable hand?”
With a wavering breath, I reminded myself of instances where I had fought larger men in victory and planted my fist in Dixie’s stomach. To my surprise, he never so much as flinched. It took one blow from the intruder for me to realize I was outmatched. He planted another fist to my side, and I wheezed in a vain attempt to regain my breath. The last I remember was Dixie’s massive hands around each of my biceps and being thrown through the glass of the gazebo.
“Shut up!” John said with laughter. A candy cane flew through the air and bounced off Sherlock’s face. This time, Sherlock tried to ignore the blush forming in John’s cheeks.
On this particular morning, I awoke to the notes of a violin resonating throughout the flat for the first time since his return. I kept my eyes shut as I was accustomed to only hearing him play in my dreams. I feared that if I awoke fully, the sounds would decrescendo into disappearance.
For a while, we stood awkwardly in our places. We were unaccustomed to gift-giving and neither of us wanted to be the first to engage.
“Bloody awful. Thanks for asking.”
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, stepping over the coffee table and fixing his hair in the mirror above the fireplace.
John averted his eyes from the closing door to his phone that now lie on the table and felt a pang of guilt in his chest. He
“How’s the head?”
For a small community, Harrow possessed a talented and able handed doctor. He wrapped my broken ribs and removed the glass from my face where it had almost nearly grazed my eye. After leaving me with some materials of my own to redress the wounds, he departed from the room where I lay, thinking of how I was to explain my failure in protecting The Three Gables to Holmes.
“You did this?” John got out of the cab and stepped forward to better see the lights outlining the door. They were colored, almost perfectly matching the tree and stood out in a harsh contrast against the black lacquer of the front door. He thought of the way the lights of the tree shone off the silk of Sherlock’s hair and wished for the sound of a violin without the pain of a headache.
“Cluedo?”
“It’s Christmas, Sherlock. Try to make some friends,” John typed back.
“And I’ll leave the storytelling to you. What is it you said we’re hearing tonight?”
Thanks to the experience of gained in other social situations, John had learned it is best to silence Sherlock and explain later at the risk of offending the third party. As such, John placed a sharp elbow in Sherlock’s ribs. Luckily, Marge and Erika seemed to not notice his comment.
“It’s Christmas. Have
“Obviously,” Sherlock reminded John of his prior deduction.
“It only felt right to return it to Mrs. Hudson,” I said with a dry throat, careful to withhold the information about the pain endured when I would finger the key to 221B in the pocket of my trousers. During Holmes’s absence, the flat was as empty as the life I led.
The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas J. Wessington arrived at our flat early one morning after catching the first train to London. This time, the seal was left on the door of the house, presumably as a warning. Her father had laughed at the matter, but Mrs. and Miss Wessington feared for their lives. Holmes had examined the seal for quite some time, testing the wax and studying the stamp under his magnifying lens before determining we must leave immediately.
Embarrassed, John brought his hand back to his lap. “Everything, alright?”
? Charles Dickens?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe we should put lights on the door of the flat,” John suggested, sitting beside Sherlock on a green metal park bench that insinuated the cold of the night.
Sometimes, John would forget the facts. After a particularly engaging case, he would rub Sherlock’s back, squeeze his shoulders or be too loose lipped in praise. John would dwell on these moments but decide they were probably just interpreted as brotherly gestures. He almost wished Sherlock knew the truth instead.
“Poison. The baby was poisoned. The mother was sucking out the poison when her husband found her.”
“You alright?” John asked.
“You must forgive me. It is my profession to possess all the facts.”
When the table had finished their meals, they sat longer while finishing their drinks and points of conversation and eating what little desserts their stomachs could hold. What cookies and treats they could not eat, Sherlock made up for with his unsatisfiable sweet tooth.
Holmes leaned into me, resting the back of his head against my chest and letting his eyes flutter shut. His body blocked the wind and sent warmth through my chilled figure. I wrapped him in the excess of my coat, knowing he was prone to colds and appreciating the contact in which was normally absent on cases.
“Goodnight, Holmes.”
John picked up the photo but knew the subject was closed. “So where should I start?” He asked, bringing the champagne glass to his lips.
The doctor arrived before Sherlock could reply.
“But you love it when I read to you. C’mon, now. I can’t be late for London’s finest violin concerto.”
“It wasn’t a joke to Robert Ferguson who found his son in the arms of his wife while she was sucking blood from the baby’s neck.”
Conflicting emotions filled John as he remembered their agreement. “Now?” He mouthed and motioned to his plate full of food.
He placed his lips to John’s neck with gentle hesitation. “John, in the morning. Will you keep me? Or am I just a meaningless resolution?”
I stopped mid-step and turned to Holmes, asking through gritted teeth, “Are you suggesting I should have shot the man?”
He laughed between words as if he was mocking himself, but in an instant, his expression dropped and his eyes concentrated on me once more. “It was foolish, Watson, foolish. I rode all the way here in anguish, knowing very well that I could have just made the worst mistake of my life.”
“Nothing except five counts of,” Sherlock paused to take a pistol from the inside of the man’s coat, “armed robbery.” He pulled back the coat further. “And wearing a Christmas jumper this hideous has to be a crime.”
It was not long after I moved into Baker Street that Holmes and I were invited to a post-case celebration with some officers of the yard. Usually, Holmes would avoid such social endeavors, but he later revealed to me that he was after confidential details that only Lestrade could provide. I do not know if he ever obtained said details, but I obtained another point on my list of Sherlock Holmes’s limits.
John couldn’t help but grin at the sound. Sherlock smiled back, the shy one he reserved only for John. The nurse left the room without further comment, but Sherlock glared at her anyway.
“Sure, what use are they to me except to dwell on my past stupidity?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, a sight John was becoming used to seeing. “I’m not a child, John.”
“I brought you these.” Sherlock placed a duffle at the foot of the bed and pulled out fresh clothes from John’s closet.
(I must note that underneath my name were various attempts at guessing what the initial of ‘H’ could stand for. Each one was crossed out except for the last which was ‘Harold.’ After reading this rather comical introduction, I glanced to my friend on the sofa who was engaged in the task of undoing his tie with no avail.)
“Yes, you do. You never wear those shoes unless-"
“Afraid so.” He gave her a gentle smile and a peck on the cheek before he vanished from the room.
“It’s not my fault the only doctor I trust was also the patient.”
“Are these…” John trailed off, reading the words in a hurry and attempting to make sense of the context.
“Its smell and colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it,” Holmes whispered, finishing his own quote. “However, I would argue that the embellishments of life are somewhat conditional,” he handled the conversation as gently as I held the rose, conscious of the possibility of it crumbling in his control.
Sherlock stepped closer to John and put an arm around his shoulders to which John stiffened at the unnaturalness of the touch. “Mrs. Hudson, if you would excuse us, we have a concussion to attend to, and I’m sure John would like to get some rest.”
“Holmes…”
I moved with leaden steps around the flat, collecting my things from the places where I dropped them without thought, forgetting that I was only a guest to 221B.
blushed.
“Go ahead. You can’t prove anything against me,” the accused claimed.
John shrugged away the thought. “None of that was your fault, but I really appreciate all of this anyway.” He gestured to his clothes and the lights.
John crossed the room and picked up Sherlock’s violin. He took a moment to turn it over in his hands and felt strange holding something that he had considered an extension of Sherlock. He felt something within him similar to gratitude for the violin and what it had given him.
When he opened the door, he found Sherlock sitting with legs curled into his chair, hands steepled under his chin and eyes locked on the laptop screen before him.
Crimes were just as plentiful and malicious during the holidays but solving them was much more festive. On this night, the consulting detective and his doctor found themselves in an upper-class neighborhood where each house donned expensive light displays but were also the most likely place for their alleged robber to make his next move.
“Ask me again next New Year’s.” John replied, turning on his other side to pull Sherlock into another kiss.
He pressed a kiss to my lips. “Then stay home today, my love.”
John chose another journal. When he opened it, a photo fell to the floor of a teenaged Sherlock with another boy of his age. “Who’s this?”
I could not reply as my throat was in too dry of a state to permit words.  It was then that I noticed a glimmer from the flowers. Tucked within the blush-colored petals was a silver chain donning a matching key. Perhaps at another time and under different circumstances, Holmes would have commented on my shortcomings of observance. Instead, he took the necklace from my hands and stepped behind me to fasten it around my neck.
“How do I get a more thorough consultation?” This time, Erika laughed
“It wasn’t right for them to send for you like that with no further details as to my health.”
“I am.” John yawned, as if to prove just that. “And I sleep better when you’re there.”
“Or trauma to the head.” Papa says and Rosie just ignores it, Papa says weird things a lot and Daddy says it’s better to just let him talk sometimes. Daddy knows Papa very well, because they met long ago and Daddy likes Papa very much.
“Who am I?”
Taking a breath, I refocus on adjusting my microscope.
I should have written something about cats way earlier :D
John tries his best to be nice to Dimmock, and it is his calm that makes me refrain from yelling at the DI to finally get on with it. I’m tired, and he’s too slow in typing up what I am saying.
He teases.
He apparently has come to a conclusion, he sets three containers down on the kitchen counter before closing the fridge again. I can follow his every movement, as he prepares his meal, his back is turned to me and I fight an urge to get up and wrap myself around him, nose pressed to the spot behind his ear. He would smile, and I would only be able to feel those minute muscles move. He is beautiful like that, smiling that little smile.
My John is magnificent, and I notice that most in those moments of quiet, when he makes dinner in our kitchen in practiced moves. He’d never know. Maybe, I will tell him someday. He’d think it romantic, and there is surely going to be a moment where I annoy him and have to make up for it.
“You need it.” Is all the answer I get, and he is back on his feet a moment later, reaching his hand out for me. I stop arguing against my own interest and heave myself up.
But something changed in a way he didn’t expect. Not only did the little ones conquer his heart within days, he also got used to their presence very quickly. Coming home now includes him greeting Sherlock, then finding the three musketeers one after the other and petting them for a moment before he has even taken his jacket off. He catches himself wondering from time to time where they are and what they might be up to if the flat is too quiet for too long.
“Yes, darling?” Papa looks very elegant sitting on the back of a fox. That’s what they call brown horses.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cats like milk.”
Sherlock listens into the dark. This area is big, an old hospital. Whoever is out there might not even come to his room or want to stay.
“Oh, where should I start…? The experiments that tend to risk both our health or the integrity of our home. Being woken up at ungodly hours at least twice a week. You …”
“But I actually like Graham. Suits him. Or her? Do we actually know?”
“Yes, I understand. What stops you, then?” I interrupt him, chuckling.
“Harry found it in his drawer. She didn’t … look at the name. I didn’t look. God, Sherlock,” The anger was gone, from one moment to the next, giving way to worry.
“What about?”
“Late night?”
The waves lap up the shore as they have for millions of years, and will for another eternity until the sun burns out. Not that I care much about things like that, the beginning and ends of worlds, planets, star signs, and the universe, not even after John started teasing me about it. All that matters is now. All that I care for is the tendril of seawater touching, kissing my John’s toe, John who, like a little child, couldn’t wait to kick his shoes off as soon as we had reached the beach and is now smiling happily. He has his jeans carelessly pushed up his calves, and the wind rumples up his silver hair the way I usually do.
He picks up last night's bowl, cleans it out a bit and fills it with cat milk. She drinks greedily and John chuckles, but his heart aches for her. As he prepares breakfast, his eyes return to the grey kitten over and over as she empties the bowl.
“Very gemein.”
I catch myself listening for a few more moments, before I finally find the focus to continue working.
“Thinking.” I breathed, my eyes fixed onto the empty street.
“Yes. I’m going to take a quick shower. I did have to go through the rubbish bins to make sure I found all of them.” John can just imagine this immaculately dressed man crawling around a dark, dirty alley in his search for the kittens. He smiles as he watches him leave, then sets to make tea, eyes always straying away to look at what the three musketeers, as he decides to refer to them, are doing.
“Could two letters?”
“As your doctor, I approve of that. You know what, I’ll take them to the vet, you get a bit of rest and then we’ll decide?”
“They need names,” John thinks, as he walks over to the desk to pick up last night’s tea mugs. “We can’t keep calling them orange, grey and tuxedo.” He doesn’t come far on his way to the kitchen, the picture of his flat mate deeply asleep catching his attention. The man hasn’t slept in days, and no matter how many times he insists on it, even he needs time to get his energy back. Sleep makes his features softer, gives him three chins and his lips now hang slightly open. John wants to press a kiss to the corner of his mouth, rub his nose against a cheekbone and whisper “Go to bed, love.”
John looks at the bathroom door. Is Sherlock worried? Or is that what he wants?
And isn’t that a very Sherlockian answer, the detective’s brain is surely ten steps ahead already. “Cats? Does this have to do with the case? You haven’t solved it yet?”
“Your definition of romantic should scare me, love.” John said, a smile present in his voice. His fingers rub circles against my belly and I take them in mine instead.
“Alliterations, Sherlock. Now, can you let me sleep? Make your list, okay, and I’ll listen to all of it during breakfast.”
He had been waiting to hear the soft click of the door opening for almost seventy-two hours, so much so that it wakes him from his light sleep when Sherlock Holmes finally returns to their shared flat.
“We know that now. Then, I was unsure. I didn’t want him to leave and take you with him.”
But now, after a week-long case, while Sherlock is all exhausted and catching up on sleep, there might be a chance. John grins to himself, then makes a straight face again as he catches up with his partner.
But now, here he is, and the frustration is all consuming. He does not want to hear about how his wound is healing nicely, or how there is a risk of infection. He does not want physical therapy, does not want to have to train and get massages and take pain medication, because it means that after all this time, he has gotten no further than he was years ago: jobless, homeless, friendless. Sherlockless.
Sherlock stops, the door handle still pushed down, and John can hear a soft ‘Oh’ through the closed door. He can just imagine that beautiful mouth pulling into a perfect o-shape, a thought that makes him smile. Sherlock must have noticed the clothes he left for him in the bathroom, and the fact that the detective seems genuinely surprised makes John feel elated. This is a good start to a hopefully amazing evening.
When he finishes, John realises he’s smiling again. If he thinks about it, not much has changed in the last few weeks in Baker Street. They solved two cases, sevens, John went to the clinic and worked on his blog whenever he had a quiet minute, with the small addition that every time he sat down he found himself with a kitten in his lap a few moments later.
“What is it?”
I shook the thoughts away, focusing on the shape of John in the dark.
John brushes his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, then bends down to place a kiss against the same spot. He yawns and stretches and decides that party planning can wait until he has slept a bit himself. He wraps himself around Sherlock and is asleep as soon as his head hits the pillows.
John clenches his fist against the sheets, his sore skin protesting.
“I can’t,” Rosie says. “It’s Papa’s day, today.”
“Well, all honour to you, Master Boatswain, but I cannot accept such behaviour. I will have to send you off the plank.”
“What?”
“Woman over there in the blue coat.” John says, loud in his conviction.
Only when Sherlock chuckles does John notice that he said all of that out loud and he blushes a bit.
I have been called worse throughout the years. This is the one that hurts. It gets under my skin, under the armour that I call ‘high functioning sociopath’ and I fight the instinct to slump my shoulders, make myself small and escape their view.
“You’d rather not. You’re cold.”
“Obviously.” Sherlock looks at him through the mirror opposite them, and for a moment, brushes the back of his hand against John’s. It’s a small touch – they aren’t very public about their relationship – but a sweet one, and John leans against his side a bit, before the elevator door opens.
I buried my nose against his chest, taking in the scent of my John. “Good night, John.”
“Hmm, the fat one should be Mycroft.”
“Not too bad,” he concludes, then takes his seat at the table again, hiding behind his paper. It is impossible to focus on any of the words, excitement bubbling up in his stomach. Sherlock will look amazing; he just knows it. He wants to see those eyes light up, can’t wait for Sherlock to discover every small detail he has added to the flat for their little Halloween date.
“Who is it then?”
John opens his lips, a dry sound escaping his throat as he attempts a cough. And maybe he has been in too many hospital rooms, both as a doctor and a patient, but he knows just from the way the echo sounds that he is in one again. He knows before he attempts to open his heavy eyelids, blinking against the artificial light coming from above. It brings with it the realisation that he is in discomfort, but the pain is dulled by medication.
I squeeze his hand, gaze fixed on the street beyond. It is overwhelming, sometimes, to be loved.
„You’re still awake.“ The words sounded a bit like a question, sleep weighing heavily on every syllable. I didn’t need to turn around to know what John would look like in that moment, almost small standing in the door frame, his hair would be ruffled from tossing and turning as he tried to find a comfortable spot on the pillow, and his pyjamas would show the same signs of restless sleep.
“You love the danger.”
I squeeze his fingers and pull him to the lift. His hand is still in mine, when the doors close behind us, shutting everybody else out.
“It’s Greg, Sherlock, are you just going through people you know?”
John Watson wishes he was dead. He is surrounded by doctors in training. They are doing rounds in their white coats and arrogant smiles, being asked questions – oh, how well John remembers feeling just like them: invincible and so clever; Gods in white, who stitched him back together without asking if that’s what he wants.
“New Year’s. After New Year’s.”
“Yes, I do. I have twelve. Just none with my name. You accepted a friend request from all of them.”
Satisfied by a nod from Dixie, Holmes turned to leave, taking my arm as he did so.
“I noticed you were without one of your own.” His words flitted against my ear and were later met with his lips.
“Since I threw the last board into the fire,” he said, bouncing with pride.
Sherlock didn’t reply (maybe because his mouth was full), but he did move to a sitting position.
(See the end of the chapter for
They nodded at each other in finality, but the nurse lingered.
Maybe they were one in the same, solving crimes and home.
“I love it already,” Sherlock interrupted.
“I was worried you might leave it the way it was. Bad enough that you put a scratch in the floor moving it in here.”
For a moment, Sherlock left John lying on their makeshift palate on the floor and moved without sound to the tree. He rustled in his pocket for his folding knife and cut off a small portion of a branch. From behind the tree, he took another black leather-bound journal from the bookshelf, this one empty except for the pages where he intended to write of the instances mostly recounted above. Between the front cover and the first page, he pressed the branch and returned the journal to the shelf.
“Yes,” said Sherlock without being asked.
“Scrooge? My middle name is Sherlock Scott.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but placed an unused candy cane on one of the top branches.
And Rosie listens, as he tells her all he knows about horses and horse riding and she asks questions, too. Papa likes it when she is interested in what he shares.
This is so very different from the moment we shared through the bedroom door, but just as emotional, even though it is not our own words. I have to wipe away tears when it is John’s turn, and he says them so enthusiastically that it garners a smattering of chuckles from the guests. He slips a ring onto my finger and the registrar finally says, “You may kiss” and I kiss my John, cupping his face in my hands, and there is applause and someone- Mrs. Hudson, probably- sobbing loudly. My mind goes almost blank, the only one occupying it being my husband and the thought that we will now spend our lives together in our version of forever.
The old man is limping a bit, and years of homelessness have painted lines onto his face that run deep. His grey, dirty hair sticks out from under a winter hat that has seen better days. He looks tired, not just physically but tired of life as if he has seen too many things in his time on earth.
Sherlock turns back to him, with a smile as bright as the full moon above.
“Marry me,” He said, pulling back to look at Sherlock. “Oh, no, don’t make that face, love. I mean it. I don’t care. I told you. I love you.”
“Not a crush,” His mind supplies “More than that.”
It should be scary, knowing how easily I would abandon The Work for him, just to get our bodies in contact.
Beside him Sherlock just closed the car door. He was wearing his coat even though John had argued that it might not be suitable for a place like this, and a pair of sunglasses that made him look a bit like some rich guy coming up here to buy his third holiday home.
But now, Sherlock is far away from Baker Street, in the middle of nowhere, and someone just triggered one of his alarm systems, and John is not here, Sig in his hand, to deal with the intruder. Sherlock gets up to deal with it himself.
I have seen enough stupid movies with John Watson to know that if this were one, the way Mike, Lestrade, and John walk up to me would be shown in slow motion.
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders. “Not a cat expert. But we will see.”
“Even with the imminent danger of cuddle death?” I asked, brushing the feeling away.
I have to cut the thought short as he is about to turn, and I don’t want to be caught staring. Before we started dating I often used to watch him, pretending to look at something under my microscope, blind to the affection he already had for me then, and would wonder what the top of his head would smell like, among other, less innocent thoughts. I remember that with a smile, which I hope he misses, thinking that I have eyes for nothing but the case right now.
John looks up at those pale eyes, trying to remember all the words he had planned to say if he ever had the chance to see Sherlock again. So many nights he lay away awake, imagining what it would be like. He’d tell him he was an arsehole, and an annoying git, and his best friend. And that he was in love with him, and had been from the beginning. And that his love had not changed, only grown in the weeks and months he had spent missing him.
It feels too much, suddenly the guilt over not having visited her after he returned from Afghanistan and only calling a few times overtakes him. She had understood, of course, but he still felt guilty now.
“What if it’s not?”
I couldn’t stop the smile if I tried, and he smiles back, the anger gone as soon as it came. With such a small gesture John Watson can change my life, small steps at a time.
The woman that came to the underworld, after being bitten by a viper and whose rescue had failed as Orpheus risked a look back.
They called me a freak when I started school for being too quiet and when I started talking, they called me freak for the things I said. Freak accompanied me through uni and in my darkest days, not hearing it for a few years was the only good thing.
Sherlock puts his tea mug down and shakes his head. “They are your cats, too.” He says, then yawns loudly.
NSY Halloween Party - Guests Welcome
“I should have known.” John moved the letter between his fingers. “That it was all a lie.”
“You could ask for forever, and I’d never find you greedy,” I whisper into his hair, squeezing his shoulder, and I feel him rub his nose against my neck. I know what his silent answers mean; have learned them all over the years. If I were to pull back a bit to gaze at his face, I’d find his eyes a bit wet, touched by what he thinks is me being romantic.
I was interrupted by the full weight of John Watson pressing me into the mattress, arms squeezing tight.
“Look, Dimmock.” John finally says. “We’ve been through this two times. I haven’t had anything to eat since I got off the surgery. So, if that’s it, we’re going home.” He smiles, politely, and gets up. Nothing about him requires an answer from DI Dimmock, who is clever enough to just nod and wish us a good evening.
“Not on horseback, though.” Papa grins, and Rosie feels the excitement bubble up in her body.
Sherlock wanted to give in, to melt against John, to let him wash away all doubt with his words and his body, with his smile and his tender touches. He couldn’t.
As it is, John isn’t doing much at the moment, just standing there and staring at me, as he dries off his damp hands on his jeans - thank god he doesn’t care for fashion, it would be grave bodily harm to any kind of suit trouser to be misused as a towel.
A giggle rips from his throat, and he is enveloped in strong arms a moment later. This is fun, so he will refrain from getting Sherlock naked for just a bit longer.
“God, they should be with their mother, still, shouldn’t they?”
John sets a plate on the living room table- he still gets me to eat about forty percent of what he makes, then lifts my legs up and rearranges them and starts eating. I haven’t moved yet, and he must think I am still busy with the case. It’s mean to keep on pretending that I am, but the thought of marriage still has a hold on me. When it comes to John, I am not a man of quick decisions, my confidence when it comes to relationships is nil and I don’t want to scare him away by wanting too much, too soon.
We are not a very affectionate couple when it comes to public places, and yet this is the second time today our fingers interlace. We never do that, here, at work. Most of the police officers don’t even know we are dating.
John’s face paled even more. “How... God, the universe is being extra cruel today, isn’t it?”
“She just looked sad.”
He takes two deep breaths before he carries two of the bowls over to his armchair. Sherlock has taken the kittens out of the box by now, the red one hiding behind the leg of the chair, his grey sibling wobbling through the middle of the room. The last kitten looks tiny in Sherlock’s large hands, head tucked against long, slender fingers.
John tilted his head in confusion. “What do you mean?”
There are a few options. They can call a shelter in the morning and drop them off there, where the experts can take care of the orphans. Or they could post on the blog about it, find new homes for them as quickly as possible. But then John has seen Sherlock’s eyes, has seen the way his flatmate looked at the little ones, and he knows already that there is no point in fighting him on this. As he glances over at the three, he wonders if he even wants to. He has a few days off, anyway, and it can’t be rocket science, can it? They can still be rehomed in a few weeks once they have gained a bit of weight.
Finally, around 5 PM, John texted a simple “where are you” to Sherlock’s number. By 6:00, he hadn’t received an answer and became more frustrated every time he checked his phone.
John's chest swelled with pride as he sat on the floor to find another case. Only a few words into a journal, he closed it and stood again to retrieve the glass he had placed on Sherlock's side table. “But wait, why didn’t she tell Ferguson about his son poisoning the baby? And how did he come about the poison?”
At the sudden removal of the pressure against my back, I stumbled to regain my footing and turned to face my capturer. In fact, two men stood behind me, Mr. Wessington and a police officer.
John leaned forward with great caution. He half expected something to jump out of the trunk. Instead, he found stacks of paper and used journals. Grabbing a black leather-bound journal from the top, he opened it and recognized the handwriting in an instant. Except these words were written with a less confident hand and appeared younger than the letters he knew.
"Mostly, yes." I let my finger slide down his neck, starting at the jawline and ending at his tie. I did so gently enough that only my nail came in contact with his skin, but I still felt him swallow underneath my touch. From here, I did only as I was asked, undoing the tie with mechanical movements.
John’s therapist used to encourage him to accept the facts, so John accepted that he was in love with Sherlock a few months after moving in. With that fact came a much more unpleasant one: Sherlock was married to his work and therefore untouchable both emotionally and physically.
“Yes, I’ve gathered that. Are you expecting people over?”
“It’s the 24th, dear. I’d love it if you both stopped by. My sister and my niece will be there and they’re both big fans of the blog. Of course, unless you have other plans for Christmas.”
“‘We have much to hope from the flowers,’” I unknowingly mumbled. They were not words of my own, for I was simply repeating a line I had once heard Holmes say.
That's all folks! As always thank you to all who have read and commented on my fanfics so far. You inspire me to keep trying.
“But I was alright.”
For hours, they sat on the floor in front of the fireplace while Sherlock would explain his prior cases and John would interject with questions and praises. The conversation only ceased when John went to get blankets and pillows to make the floor more comfortable.
John felt dizzy but couldn’t focus to count the drinks he had made. “What’s that then?”
“I’ll leave the instrumental expertise to you.”
“Actually, I was rather hoping-” Sherlock twirled towards John on the toe of his foot but stopped abruptly upon scanning John’s clothes. “Oh.”
“And you’re okay with it?”
“No, Sherlock. I don’t have plans.” He grasped Sherlock at his elbows and ducked so his face was in line of the detective’s sight, not his shoes. “Now, why don’t you tell me what yours are?”
“I’m yours, Holmes.”
“Well, what is your blog lacking? Serial murderers? Stolen jewels?” He leaned forward towards John and brought his voice to a whisper. “Vampires?”
Sherlock of course had a conflicting answer to every one of John’s suggestions. It would ruin the dusting, he said. The last thing we need is for clients to give more useless information, John. In the end, they got a tree.
Mrs. Hudson looked at me in the doorway, and I nodded to her in greeting. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” She suggested and left with no more than a curt smirk.
“Holmes, have you seen my-“
He had never been more in love.
“No, thank you. I’m fine.”
“You’re awake,” interrupted the authoritative voice in the doorway.
"Such as?" Sherlock said as he rose from the sofa and moved closer to John. He chose one of the five candy canes to continue sucking on and let it hang on the edge of his mouth like the experienced cigarette smoker he was at one time.
A small laugh escaped from my throat. "Of course."
He ascended the stairs without so much as a second glance towards me. After hearing the closing of Mrs. Maberley’s bedroom door, I allowed myself to slouch against the wall and slide to the floor. Dora rushed to my side, but I waved her away.
During a summer night in 1896, Holmes and I found ourselves separated during one of the many cases which normally brought us together. However, in this instance, a little old lady found herself without protection during a time Holmes felt was to be filled with danger. As such, I volunteered myself to stay the night with the woman, Mrs. Maberley, in her house affectionately known as The Three Gables.
Sherlock either didn’t hear John or ignored him, because he continued to stare expressionless out the window, tapping his fingers in a steadily increasing tempo.
Finally in the cab, Sherlock drummed his fingers on his knee and leaned against the door.
An expression overtook Holmes in which I had seen few times during our many years together. I was reminded of him by the fire, flames in his eyes. He turned to uppercut Dixie, but my hand was already around his wrist as I drug him towards the door.
“That would be the one. And I am the detective Sherlock Holmes.”
“Nah, that there’s Sherlock Holmes, the detective,” Dixie attempted to correct.
For a while, the conversation looked to be civil. I allowed my focus to become lost in the trance of the boxer’s movements which was only broken by hearing Holmes’s voice commanding the attention of the room.
He ignored my warning. “Betray me again and I’ll destroy you. Follow my exact directions, and we may make a deal. Hmm?”
Holmes jogged through the gates of the house without hesitation and went to work measuring some prints found by the front door.
“Yes, I do believe him to be taller than me, maybe even you.”
promised. I had nothing to do with this.” Lowering an accusatory finger from John to his phone, he raised an invisible barrier between him and the conversation, but John decided to press further.
“I’m fine, really I am. We’ve both had worse.”
"It is complete except for one minor detail. I'm uncertain as to how the subject feels about me." He grasped my fingers with his own and raised my hand until it was in front of his lips. Hesitating, he glanced at me to which I gave a curt nod before he pressed a kiss to the back of my hand. "You will stay, won't you?"
“Well, don’t start making it into a competition. You two boys get into enough trouble as it is.”
“Orthodontist actually,” she corrected.
“Although it took me some time and caused us both immense turmoil, I did return to you. Despite your name being attached to another place of residence, I ask that you always return home to me.” I heard him take a wavering breath before pressing a kiss to the side of my neck. “I know that I have no right in making such a request, but I hope you will at least always wear this constant reminder of my plea.”
“No, you have a right to flinch away, for these injuries are of my doing.”
We rode in silence for a ways until sentiment got the better of me, and I had to reapproach the matter. “I know I haven’t been of much use on this case, but if that’s some kind of attempt to get rid of me…”
“This has nothing to do with the photos Mrs. Hudson was tagged in with her niece?”
But he would also sit on the sofa and watch his flatmate sway gently with the song resonating from his violin. He would bring them Chinese on Wednesday nights that they'd share in front of the telly. He would sit beside him in a cab and laugh about stolen ashtrays until his stomach hurt.
On the other hand, John could not have been more intrigued with Erika. “Thank you. That means a lot.”
They moved without a destination in mind, inhaling each other with all their senses. They thought of no one else but knew this is how the act was supposed to feel.
Behind him, Sherlock smirked and arose from his chair, crossing to John in one long stride. “No, you can’t be. Especially if you’re playing in it.”
“And you’ll play by the rules this time?”
“Christmas? Tomorrow?” John looked at his watch.
John looked to Sherlock who had set his jaw and was tapping his foot against the hardwood floors. He tilted his head at John and tried to beg without looking too desperate.
“Bring back some ears, will you?” I say, just to hear him chuckle against my skin.
“Oh, I wasn’t aware this was a democracy.” John jokes, pulling his own chair back to sit.
“Or,” John cleared his throat “You could join us and we could make a little holiday out of it.”  Almost immediately he wanted to take the words back. As if a holiday sounded appealing to the smartest brain in Britain, he should have invented a case or something like that.
I pace.
I’m crying, I realise, and warm thumbs brush my tears away, John’s finger fingertips whispering, reassuring against my sensitive skin. I have, in the past, taken in the lines of John’s hands with my eyes, fingers, and tongue, sorted the weathered texture and the feel of each of them to the point where I could distinguish them from among dozens, if it ever became necessary, and somehow the contours of them calm me deeply. My tears stop, after a bit, and only then does John speak.
“The case of the muppet murderer.”
I reach out and slip my hand into his coat pocket. It is nice and warm in there, his fingers slightly damp, and I interlace them with my own. I would enjoy people making their own deductions about us and realising he belongs to me. Idiots that they are, they would need something obvious to see. I wonder what kind of ring would fit my John. Something simple but special at the same time. Gold fits his skin tone better. It is more traditional, too. He likes that sort of thing.
Dull.
He doesn’t do it, of course. Like so many times before, he just swallows down that urge.
“You would yell at me and tell me how important your work as a general physician is.” I escape the situation with an attempt of humour, and he catches on.
“Hello, Watson.” He rumbles. “How was school?”
“Hasn’t changed a bit.” John tried not to get emotional over that fact, and he took a deep breath as he stepped through the gate, the green paint already splintering off where it moved in its hinges. Their steps sounded loud in the eerie silence of the place, John looked around only to see the car, the road, and the surrounding fields. This was a small paradise, the perfect place to turn one's brain off for a bit and find their inner child again. They would have to go behind the house to the small forest and see how much it had changed in the past twenty or thirty years.
“Sherlock,” She takes a few steps towards me. “You’re here before John?”
“Let’s play a game.” He says, and that gets my full attention.
“Now, on to you. I did not hatch a plan to survive that fall, only for you to get yourself shot before I could return to London.” Behind the accusation, John can hear the worry and on instinct, he reaches out to touch Sherlock’s arm.
“That you are hard working and loyal, and that you love me very much to do this for me.”
“Hhmm, not changing it.” John yawned again, the increasing frequency proof that he was intending to go back to sleep. Squeezing my shoulder, he settled deeper into the pillow.
Papa smiles at that, and it looks a little sad. Not sad, but the thing where adults think back to old times and miss it a bit, which is  stupid, now is a very good time too.
“Your father raised you on his own, after your Mummy died.” He says, and his eyes go sad again. Rosie knows what her mummy looks like. She has a picture of her in her room. Mummy is very pretty, and she has a lovely smile, too. Maybe Daddy only wants to kiss people with beautiful smiles. Daddy told her that Mummy died. Papa said people tell themselves that they go to heaven when they die, but really they go into the ground. Daddy sometimes visits Mummy with her, and Rosie tells her all about what she learns in school.
“Shit.” John mumbles, drying his hands off. He hates moments like this. They always feel like a threat to their friendship, like he is asking for too much. Taking care of Sherlock is what John wants to do for the rest of his life. It’s stupid, falling in love with a man that doesn’t do relationships, his best friend, the man he can’t live without- he was forced to try doing that and miserably failed.
So yes, I can believe it. I can believe we’ll spend the rest of our lives here at this place where the murmuring ocean is a constant companion and the wind sings us to sleep every night. I want those morning walks and evenings on the sofa as much as the trips back to London for those above-eight cases and the nights hunched over my microscope, before crawling into bed and melting into John’s warmth. I believe that my bees and his books will keep us content, even though they are far from the murder and mayhem of the city. And on those days when they don’t seem enough, John will be at my side to occupy my brain – and not only in that way, thank you very much.
