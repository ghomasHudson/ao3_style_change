" Yeah, they were playing poker and Buck bet his prosthetic arm, and he lost it to her, she did give it back... Eventually"
That response caused the other kids to complain and start challenging Peter to actually bet them, and maybe, it was the fact that he was secretly really competitive, or just plain peer pressure or both. That caused him to say what he did.
" Ben!, seriously what the hell is wrong with him, he was the one who suggested jumping naked, not my fault he is a sore loser." Peter punch the floor but still didn't have enough energy to get up from it.
" We don't have much time. your dad will be back any second, don't worry just put it in the case and ill get you a new pair tomorrow"
Ben wasn't sure when exactly he let go of his dad. But when he finally did, he felt like he had just run a marathon. Tired, but at the same time filled with energy, he was even sweating a bit. He wanted to talk to his dad more, But  Pepper started talking to him about meetings, and other stuff, that sounded important. He wasnt comftrable interrupting.
His dad grabbed a tissue from his desk and clean the tears of Ben's face, who by now was a little bit calmer
"At least not yet" He heard Natasha say as he grabbed his arm and kissed his cheek."But that is going to change real soon right, sweetheart?"
Ben couldn’t stop smiling, happy to already have made two new friends, a great way to start an adventure. Not even the side pocket of his bag ripping open was enough to sour his mood, poor thing, had been through a lot in such a short amount of time. Luckily, the only thing in there was the deck of cards his uncle Bucky had given him. He had taught him how to play earlier that year, much to the dismay of his dad, and it had fallen right by his feet. "So... by any chance do any of you know how to play this? "He asked as he flashed the deck to Danny and Luke.
"Speaking of promises..." Peter looked up at his dad with hopeful eyes, he had promised to take him to the studio and tell him more of the day he and his dad had met.
"What's wrong with me, what's wrong with you, you pushed me?" The other boy replied with the same anger. Splashing him in return.
"I'm out, the only thing I have left is the headband I'm wearing and I'm not betting that," Said one of the girls who was standing there.
"I'm basically 11!" For a moment Ben thought about maybe letting Peter's hair as it was, and spare them both this torture. But he looked at his buzz cut, and compared to Peter's floppy long brown hair, he had to cut it, his hair grew fast, but it wouldn't have grown that much over a month. And his dad would definitely notice the difference.
Sometimes he wished he did, have the last night he saw his mom, to be a peaceful memory, but that same night, as he sat at his desk trying to figure out what to say write to his husband, thinking that, in the morning, he would set it all right.  Then his phone rang, it all became numb, and it felt as his heart had stopped, the only thing louder than the million thoughts in his head, was the reporter's voice, which echoed through the apartment as he gathered his things to get to the hospital.
Peter stepped back to admire their work, as he thought about what Ben had asked him, he pressed his lips together before answering.
his dad didn't say anything he just took a seat in the big chair that was next to him and placed his son on his lap."Sure thing"
He made a gesture to the mountain of luggage. They both grabbed on and started to pull. But even with their combined strength, it wasn't enough to get it out.
"I think I can handle it," He said with confidence, his dad let him have one sip of his coffee, it started when Peter would sneak a sip of his mug out of curiosity but he ended up liking it, his dad always caught him so they made a compromise that Peter could have one sip of coffee
"Good boy" Happy gave in and smiled at the kid. "eh, guess I'll miss having you around, after all, you're the only one that can get your dad out of his lab when he's overdoing it."
Ben smiled at her, but he continued to look around, but he didn't see anybody else." Where's my dad?"
" Well, of course, I was going to pick you up, I've missed you like crazy, plus I had to make sure they brought the right kid home."
"I know that".He paused and grabbed a cloth and cleaned the wet paint off his hands ."Okay, let's play a game, say the first thing that comes into your mind, no hesitation just say it".Peter panic and blurted out."Who do you think would win in a fight bigfoot or Mothman?"
He took a seat next to the crib, even managing to close his eyes for a brief moment before his son woke up with a thunderous scream.
"Okay, dad," He said a little too amuse after witnessing that. Jarvis let him go so he could get his bags but kept an eye on him.
"You are my little boy, a prince with chocolate eyes so curious and wide courtesy of dad, chubby cheeks and rosy lips that come from me-"
He looked out the window to distract himself. He had only been out of the city two times in his life, and he had to admit the view was stunning, Malibu was like something out of a movie. Bright and beautiful ,but despite the glamour, he would pick his city in a heartbeat. He felt his shoulders tense at the thought of home. Right now, Brooklyn seem like it was worlds away.
Ben was shaking while holding the picture close to his chest. just like Peter was, as he started walking towards him.
Peter had to admit that Johnny was right, sure it was no science camp, but this place was pretty great. They had lots of games to welcome the new campers, the food was pretty good, and overall he was having fun. He did, however, have a few weird encounters, for example.
"Don't remind me Jar, that keeps me up at night in fact, spidering, could you do your old man a favor and stay little?"
Ben was right she was good and he had no choice, he grabbed spidey and took a deep breath "Alright... It all started with them sending us to the same summer camp".
Tony had a habit of setting up barriers, that were as cold and thick as iron. That usually led him to the road of isolation and self-destruction, closing himself off, only showing his true emotions in the most destructive way possible. And when he was like this, figuring out time travel or Steve walking through that door in the next five minutes, was be much more likely, than to get him to open up. But, not all hope was lost. Tony knew well, that the only reason why he hadn't emotionally checked out at this point, was because of one thing, or better said two things. His boys were keeping him afloat, they gave him a reason to wake up in the morning, and to keep going, but despite the immense love for his sons, it didn't change the fact that he grew even more tired with every passing day.
The helmet came off, and the second the boy's identical, brown eyes met, they both let out a loud gasp and took a step back, everybody else was frozen, but they were still whispering.
"Ben, not too close I don't want it to bite you". His Pop's called out as he made his way up the stairs.
Peter wasn't sure if it was the way his pops was talking about his dad or that this was the first time he ever heard this story but he felt tears his eyes up
One fateful summer day as rain poured outside of their cabin Ben and Peter discover that their two broken families fitted perfectly together and they decide that they had been apart for far too long.
While they picked up their stuff to leave, a shiny black car parked nearby. It stuck out like a sore thumb next to the busses. It reminded Ben of a movie, spy car. He made a small comment about wondering who would be in there, but his attention went back to his new friends as they walked to their cabin.
I'm  sooo tired, I'm sorry for the awful (like always)writing but if I don't post this now I won't be able to do it for another two day
" You're right, that would definitely make you the winner, except that, may I present with grate honor, a royal flush." Peter said showing off his perfect hand."Hope you like swimming."
"Surprised Morning inspection, kiddos, get ready!".She yelled in the megaphone and head towards the oakwood cabin.
"Are you sure you're feeling all right, normally you're yapping my ear off, but you've been awfully quiet, and you haven't touched your ice cream which makes me think you might be dying?"
" First things first, I'm going to need you to magically forget some of the words I just said or at the very least not repeat them, because those are not allowed...for kids"
Luke and Danny screamed from their bunk bed, which had been covered with glitter glue and colorful feathers.
Steve paused and gave him a long look almost as  if he was trying to  remember something important  ."You got me there, still, I want you to go and stay in bed on time, I can even check the closet and scare them off for you"
Peter pointed out. The two of them were building a board to keep track of all the members of their family, and the facts they have to remember if they were going to make this work.
"I guess I'm just tired, it's been a really exciting month, plus you know I think the time difference is getting to me."
Peter stayed quiet, he was about to say something, but Maria got past him. and when she stepped inside, a bucket of syrup fell on top of the counselor, and before a scream even left her mouth, the fan had turned on making white feathers fall like snowflakes.
It felt like an internity passed by, before the black car pulled into the camp. He took a deep breath and slowly got up from the seat, as he saw the car door open and saw a man wearing a black suit step out of it. The man looked at him thinking he was Peter and smiled at him as he walked over him. He took off his sunglasses and put his hands on his hips.
When he was standing in the line to get breakfast, a counselor that Peter was 99% sure had never spoken to him before, told him to enjoy his second serving of waffles, and to leave some syrup for the rest of the kids, before walking away laughing, as if it was an inside joke, to be fair, he was about to grab some waffles, and he did plan to drown them in syrup but that counselor didn't know that, regardless, he decided to brush it off. He did the same when a group of kids came up to him and made weird comments about how they were going to get a rematch and how they were going to win everything back before running off. But as weird as that was, it was the last thing on his mind at this moment. Because Peter was having the time of his life fencing. Normally, he would be the kid to get picked last for everything but against all odds, he was doing pretty well. Mostly because most of them were first-timers, but taking to account that Peter was one of the smallest boys there, and his sight gave him a big handicap. The fact that he was doing this good was a miracle. He guessed that his strategy of pretending that he was swinging around a lightsaber was paying off.
"My dear boy, how I've missed you." He pulled Ben into a hug without hesitation but he didn't mind, on the contrary, he embraced it
"As long as you give one to Pops". He tightened the gip he had on Peter, squeezing him closer to him before loosen it up again. like Peter had mentioned they had been apart for 11 years, but now that they spend the summer together, and got to know each other, knowing that he would have to let go of his brother, and not see him for a very long time filled the young boy with a strange sense of melancholy.
Pepper said looking straight at Tony who had been telling Ben cheat codes for the game through the whole match.
Peter warned him about his dad getting stuck at work, but he had waited so long to meet him and the thought of having to wait even longer broke his heart.
"He. isn't. my clone, stop, with the crazy theories! Although... I have to admit I like the alternate universe one, that'd be cool. But still, stop it, you're making this a bigger deal than it is."
As soon as he was in he locked the door behind him, and got out the eye drops that were in his pocket, he applied a few in his eyes, not wanting his contacts to dry out, or else he would be in real trouble. After that, there was a long pause, as he dropped to the ground, he didn't know what to feel, he wasn't exactly sad, and was still fully committed to the mission, he just felt tired.
"Hey, hey, look at me". He picked up his chin with his fingers ." First of all nothing you do will ever make me like you less, you're my kid, I'm always going to love you, and second of all, I don't want you to ever feel afraid to talk to me, okay?"
He put down the notebook and ran to his brother's room, taking off the back-back and throwing it on the bed before rushing out.
"For the last time I wasn't avoiding him, I just didn't go because I had a cough for staying in wet clothing too long"
"Yes, pops, I'm sure" He turned to his aunt he couldn't see far away very well but he could make that she was on her phone.
"Um... How about you tell me one more story and I'll tell you about...um my friends Luke and Danny."
"Hahaha, yeah" He laughed nervously and dry swallowed ."Hey, look a cobweb!" He got up and ran to the spiderweb that was on the corner he stared at it for a bit before he got out Ben's phone, he really did miss his camera but in the meantime, it served as a replacement although he was sure he was filling up the memory quickly with photo after foto.
Peter had told him that Jarvis was basically their grandfather and that made Ben really happy, sure he had his pops and aunt and uncles but he never had a grandfather. The closest thing he had was stories about his aunt may and grandmother Sara, but it wasn't the same as someone actually filling in that role. A month ago his family was small and broken, sure it was still broken but it was anything but small, he had finally met his dad, he even had a brother a twin brother for that matter, along with even more aunts and uncles, to say it felt nice would be a huge understatement.
"Wow...pops you're so tall, I can see everything from here, I'm like a hawk".he could hear his dad chuckle as he gave his leg a little pat.
He ran as quickly as possible to his pop's and uncle and when he was running past Sam he yelled out ."On your Right!". he stopped running and notice how his pops had to cover his face to keep him from bursting out laughing while his uncle stood there dumbfounded.
"Hey, Benny, come here I got an idea". His uncle kneeled down and whispered something into his ear, Peter didn't fully get it but he agreed.
Peter's face felt numb from grinning so much, he couldn't keep his eyes off his dad, this was almost like a dream, except for the knot in his throat, that forbid him from responding more than two-word answers to all of Steve's questions.
"Peter?".He asked sounding concerned for him but hearing his brother's name instead of his own made him shut down even more
Ben looked around too and spotted a taller than average, dark skin boy, wearing a yellow shirt and gray hoodie. He watched as he walked up to a different but just as big pile and proceeded to get his backpack out with ease.
"It's okay". Steve turned around and in his hands, he was holding the black spidey plushie "Care to introduce us?"
Peter laughed at that but stretched out his arms. "A quick one won't hurt but you'll owe me a longer one later, Deal?"
he found himself smiling at that, but he also felt tears, they were filling up his eyes, along with an odd feeling in his stomach, he could feel his face get red as thoughts started to fill his head.
It was like his head and body were on two complete schedules, On top of that, he never got to put in his eye drops so his eyes felt dry.
He pressed his finger between his eyes, again forgetting that he didn't have glasses to push back. " No one" His aunt did a quick scan of the restaurant but he didn't think too much of it, it didn't seem like she got a look of the so he thought he was in the clear, plus if is pops didn't know bruce what were the chances Nat did. He leaned his head on Pop's shoulder and witnessed how he took one of his fries and dipped it into his shake.
"Slightly," He said with a smile, Ben did the same as he guided him to his room, or better said Peter's.
"Do you want to play?" Ben offered, mostly to be nice but Peter's presence made him tense up. He didn't know how to feel around him, and the fact that when the two of them were together, they always caused a scene, only made him feel even more uncomfortable. He tried to ignore it and focused on the game.
" Times like this I resent Barnes for getting married being your fake spouse exhausting, especially when you should be going out on a real date, come on I know plenty of men and women who would be perfect for you".
"Like always, you'll be the first one to see them, don't worry, but first we need to unpack your things, and then get you something to eat".
" No! Think about it are dads spent all this time and energy keeping us apart, I mean just look at our last names for crying out loud, so we should make it hard for them too!".
"That same day, your grandpa introduced us, No, not right away, Do you want to know something? Even though I was drawn to your dad right away, I didn't fall in love immediately, that took a bit of time but looking back now...he still made me fall pretty quickly."
" Kiddo, you might want to check your watch because there is no time difference between California and Washington".
Peter repeated the same words that his father had told him when he had asked that very same question.
The other man added with a similar tone, but the honest smile that was painted on his face made the brunette's anxiety temporarily disappear.
"But those memories are super blurry and whenever I ask my dad about him he just says he loved me but he had to leave, that he'll tell me more about him when I'm older, you know the classic grown-up response."
Best of all the two boys were finally relaxing even making jokes and having a small conversation as the game went on.
Most of the staff members, were in the meeting, leaving just the volunteer counselors, a.k.a all high school and college kids, who volunteered to be here in charge of keeping the kids busy, with various activities after breakfast.
"Your weird kid" Steve pushed his lips together in an effort not to laugh and handed Peter a bottle of maple syrup."Don't drown them"
His dad walked up to him and placed a helmet on his head. "There we go" he then handed him a bat."It's been a while since we had a day like this right? and I'm sorry about that, these last few months had been crazy"
Peter was looking out the window, noticing how his arrival had caught the attention of a few campers and even some counselors.
"Neither do I, despite how unusual and reckless this is, I wouldn't trade it for the world" Steve paused and stroke Tony's arm with his other hand "I love you more than anything and considering that you agreed to marry me I'm assuming you feel the same way"
"Are you sure your okay?" His pops had asked for the millionth time as he kneeled down to examine his face.
Danny replied innocently, which cost the other two boys to share a malicious smile."I feel like I just walked into a trap," That response made the other two boys break into laughter.
"Pff, that's easy" He took Peter's bags and started running towards the crowd eager to show him around. " come on, it's time you have some real fun."
"I don't think it was from a company, it was a photo frame with two pictures, one was of him and his dad when he was little and the other one was of him and you"
"Finally someone who understands! You should see how my Pops and uncles look at me when I eat them, you would think I was eating a bug or something."
"Still parking, keep that on, well, mostly missing you, but I did finish those pieces I was working on before you left."
The thing about his pops, was that he was kinda strict about his diet, nothing too crazy, he eat regular things, and snacks were encouraged, (He rarely took them, but that was more of a him thing)  He was like that about a lot of things, something about kids needing structure, and other stuff, he didn't go overboard or anything,  he just wanted him to eat healthily and all that jazz, sometimes they had take-out, but that was only when his pops got too busy to cook or when his godfather wanted to surprise him, his pop's had even gotten angry when he overdid it, so, junk food to Ben was somewhat rare, so he was enjoying this.
"My uncle Bruce sometimes lives with us, but right now he's off in another country doing some research, so you don't have to worry about him."
He usually tried not to take his work home, so his full attention would be on the boys but sometimes it was necessary plus it kept his mind busy.
"It's just...it's just I don't know how to, I want to ask you like a million questions, but I don't know how to and I'm afraid that you'll get angry and not want to talk to me, or that your not going to like me anymore".
"I didn't get along with your father when we first met, one of my favorite things to do was tease him and get him angry, and one day I just started speaking in Italian, so he wouldn't understand me and then I switch to French, Unfortunately, I let it slip that I found him very attractive, several times and it turns out your father was fluent in both languages, it was kinda embarrassing"
"I will!" He could hear his pops and aunt talking about budget and location, he pretty much ignored them and continued to look around, he took out his phone and did a quick double-take before he texted him.
Even with those few differences, the boys were completely identical, to the point, where they were even wearing the same expression of shock. With their eyes completely widen and their mouth slightly opened.
Happy started closing the divider but saw Peter's puppy dog face in the mirror, he looked away because even knowing it was fake he was a sucker for that face.
" I'm not joking, I don't care if you're my twin, I haved survive 11 years without you, I'll survive the rest of my life if I have to."
Peter finally turned around and it took a second but he recognized the owner of the second voice to be his uncle Sam.
"Come on Rogers already said he's fine and you know  I would never let anything bad happen to my nephew, I'm sure you can trust me with him for a few minutes "
"Well, it's just I haven't been able to say that in forever, pops, "no hello, pops", or "good morning pops", and I could say dad but it's not the same."
"I didn't know who he was, I just saw this boy, with the most curious eyes, I've ever seen, I didn't even think about talking to him, I just started drawing, he saw me doing it, but he didn't say anything he just smiled. something about your dad had this tendency of Faking smiles, but when they were genuine, it would light up to any room, don't get me started the sound of his laughter it was the sweetest sound...it just...wow" He let out a sigh, the memory of Tony came to him. " You know? he used to tell these jokes, I didn't understand but pretended that I did because it made him happy, and I got to hear that laugh, "
"You know when someone says they're fine a lot, it usually means they're not actually fine, are you sure everything is okay?"
"Jokes on him because while he is off being productive I get to see my favorite godson and bring him his favorite take-out."
His breathing became heavier, and the chest pain came back once again, he moved on and ignored it, this time focusing on the furniture, that wasn't anything special but it was nice.  There were a few books on the coffee table next, to the TV and a Sketchbook on the windowsill, that was connected to a fire escape. The apartment as a whole was warm and welcoming, much like Steve himself.
The man said as he pointed to the car, but Ben was frozen, he wanted to say something but he could feel the words get stuck in his throat.
Peter frowned knowing exactly what was going on, after all, he had seen this scenario many times before with his dad and had to stop himself from frowning. But he did find it funny how his pops, who was the tallest and most muscular man he ever has ever seen was using his ten-year-old as a shield, by standing behind him and gripping his shoulder from a small woman blond woman.
"Aren't the first ones really, really, old movies?" He questioned as he started getting up from the floor.
She reached for the door, but Peter got in the way before she could open it. Because he knew the second that this door was open,it would activate the final booby trap.
"What did I just say?!, also, like I said Uncle Bucky, along with his husband, uncle sam, are over at the apartment almost every day."
"Okay, and what did I tell you about just throwing things around like that...Ben!" Steve let out a sigh of defeat when the boy rushed out before he was done talking.
What immediately caught Peter's eyes was the way the wall was painted, yes, it was a weird thing to notice, but then again Peter was a weird kid, most of the walls looked fine, it was neat and clean and it looked like someone actually knew what they were doing when they painted it, but looking around he noticed that the rest of it was the complete opposite, the paint strokes were uneven, and sloppy almost as if a child would have done it, that's where it hit him, his pops and Ben probably did this themselves, at first the mental image made him happy, but suddenly, he felt his throat go dry, his chest felt tighter, as melancholy came over him. He shook his head, and tried to ignore it, and kept looking around, his focus shifted to a couple of pictures on the wall and shelves, most of them were of Ben and his pop's, there was one he assumed was taken in his uncle's wedding, considering everybody was dressed up, another one was of his pop's Squadron, next to it there were a few framed medals, but they were overshadowed by what Peter had to assume, was every accomplishment Ben had ever made in his short life along with every drawing, it didn't take long before he came across a picture of Steve holding a baby, who was no older than a year.  Peter took a long look at it and a thought came across his head.
Steve turned to him and gave him a long look, his smile dimming down as he arched his eyebrows."Are you really not going to tell me?"
They started batting, Peter instead that his pops and aunt went frist, he wanted to see how it was done, Steve and Nat hit every ball that came their way when they were in there, it was a pretty cool view. Then it was his turn. When it came to sports Peter had his strengths and weakness, for example, he could do a perfect cartwheel (He was looking to master the flip next), climb any rock wall that you put in front of him and he was fast  but he had no eye to hand coordination, he looked like an alien that was put into a human body and couldn't figure out how arms worked. add to the fact that he was tired and flinched every time the ball came near, well let's just say it was a miracle that he only dropped the bat once.
That whisper was all it took for everybody to start running in different directions, and with all the commotion that was going on Peter got caught in the Stampede of children forced to run, but the worst part was that someone accidentally kicked Ben's clothes into the lake, without anybody noticing, not even himself. He started to swim up to the shore, only to see the approaching flashlight, he quickly jumped back into the water, and hid under the deck, not wanting to get caught. When he finally managed to get out he was shaking like a leaf, he desperately looked around for his clothing only to realize that they were nowhere to be found. Fortunately, he managed to find his towel, he grabbed it and wrapped it around his body as rage started to fill up inside of him.
"mmhm, I think...I'm in the same house you are in, I even have more than a few Hufflepuff tendencies."
"Now, listen up, because this part is very important. When he comes back from jogging, you have to be up, if you're not, he's going to think your sick, so you need to be up. "
Luke just patted his friend Danny on the back, "Don't worry about it, will go easy on you, but in an off-topic question, did you bring any money with you?"
Fair warning I kind of lost my beta reader when I wrote this chapter so I apologize for the horrible grammar and misspelling, I'm fixing it but still if had I apologize
"Trust me, Rogers,  after you see this place you might name your next child after me or at the very least rename Ben"
When Ben got out of the plane he started looking around but all he saw was a black car and a tall lean strawberry blond ,woman standing in front of it.
By the way, I also arrived, sorry I didn't text you right away we were out getting food, you were right, dad is funny!-BRR
None of them knew what happened after they were forced to run last night, and definitely had absolutely no idea on what was waiting for them.
Peter yelled out his voice still shaky, he started biting his nails and stayed in the car a bit longer.
I really am grateful for all of you, you guys make my day and I love you all but I want to give out a special shout-out to
" No, we're not, we're getting payback, " Peter said determinedly, he tried getting up from the ground but immediately went back down. "Right after we take a million-year nap, ouch. "
"No, there are only four houses but you can be a combination of two or more or you can be in just one house but have tendencies of another."
right away he could tell this wasn't going to be like the other matches, sure a lot of kids came in and tried to beat him with the attack-to-kill technique, but this kid was fast, and it looked like he knew what he was doing. Peter was spending all his energy deflecting all the blows he was receiving. Waiting for an opportunity to show itself so he could deflect, but he ended up walking backward, up the stairs, still trying to dodge every attack. He ended up falling when he took a misstep and thought there was an extra step, and that's when the mystery boy poked him on the chest, earning him a point and a cheer from the audience. Peter quickly got up and noticed that the boy had not yet climbed the stairs, he took the higher ground to launch his sword straight into the boy's chest earning him a point and cheers of his own. He and the mystery boy were tied, and whoever got the next point would win the match, which made things more intense, the other boy quickly made his way up the stairs, as they continued fencing on the outside of the cabin, Peter noticed that this guy was leading him into a dead end, he tried thinking quick, the hall was too narrow so he couldn't go around him or he would lose immediately. He looked up and saw the wooden ledge and somehow convinced himself to jump on it. He was very proud of himself for being able to pull that off, sure he wasn't the stereotypical wimpy nerd (he was close but not quite) but he wasn't that athletic type either, he liked rock climbing with his dad, and he was in the junior gymnastic team, something he got teased for a lot but he didn't care he loved it. And he love the feeling of being up on the edge, he could hear some of the kids gasping and cheering him on while the counselor was screaming out"Okay!" as they tried to make their way through to the crowd of excited children, to make sure Peter and this boy didn't hurt themselves. Unfortunately, his moment and his victory was short-lived, because his opponent took advantage that Peter was distracted by trying to think of his next move, and poked his stomach with the thin sword, The poke made him lose his balance, and Pete ended up falling off the ledge, but luckily or unlucky for him, he didn't hit the ground, he hit the water. Right below where he had been standing there was a large wooden sink that was filled with water.
Ben yelled, being just as nervous as Peter, who had shut his eyes so hard that his face was wrinkled.
how was this possible, he thought his uncle was in a different country and even then, New York was one the biggest city in the US, and they had just happened to be here in a small diner in the middle of Brooklyn in the same time?  the probability of this happening had to be insane and yet here he was, did his uncle Bruce know about this all of this, he had too, right? he and his dad had known each other for years and his dad really only had four friends,  he probably did and there was a big chance he never met his pops, after all, he met Bruce when he was 5 or 6 long after his pops left.
"Oh, my god are you okay?!" Ben called out and ran to the ledge, looking down at the boy that he had pushed off by accident. Sure, he thought he was going a little hard on him, considering that he had the unfair advantage that he knew some basic fighting moves from his dad, uncles, and aunt. It was nothing too extreme they were very basic moves, but still, not all the kids could claim that they were taught how to fight by three ex-military men and the most badass person who ever lived.
His dad was giving him a piggyback ride back to the apartment while he asked for the millionth time if he was okay and if he was sure he felt fine.
"...Right, I'll go check that out, um spiderling, why don't you go upstairs, unpack and get some rest?"
( like always sorry for my awful grammar, I can't really English very well and really need a beta reader)
The first day, they weren't allowed to go on the regular activities with the rest of the campers, so they spent all day unpacking and shooting hateful glares at one another. While not exchanging a word. The night wasn't any better. Peter was reading on his bed before they were forced to turn off the lights but Ben had decided to go to bed early, so he turned off the lights without a warning. Considering the Peter was under the assumption, that he was a sore loser, who threw a tantrum every time things didn't go his way, this only made him angrier at the other boy, so he placed his hand on the light switch that was on his side of the room and turned the lights back on. This action also didn't do anything to change the idea, that Ben had about Peter. That he was just a spoiled, little rich kid, who thought the world revolved around him. So once again, he turned off the light, this cycle continued until the light bulb finally overheated. As the room fell into darkness, Peter let himself full onto his mattress and murmured in a frustrated voice.
When he approached the edge he tried not to think about it too much, only stopping to pinch his nose and close his eyes, before jumping, he hoped if he did it fast enough it would make it easier but the second, he hit the water it felt like being inside of an ice cube, it was so cold that it stung his skin but he powered through it, going as deep as he could.
Peter rested his chin on his dad's head. It was funny the way he was sitting on his pop's shoulder made it impossible for either of them to see what the other's expression, and it represented their situation of being so close and yet so far, it had been easier to talk to him especially after his chat with his uncle bucky but it was still hard because he couldn't ask him things as Peter, he had to do it as Ben and that was especially difficult, his brother was quiet around adults, he was not, and most importantly Ben already knew everything about his dad, it was true that most kids weren't too close with their parents but he knew both he and his brother were, maybe because untill now it was just them but that was the issue, he wanted to ask things about his pops but he couldn't go: Hey pops can you please tell me things that you know for a fact I already know about you? without sounding suspicious or weird...well weirder, which sucked because he wanted to know crucial information outside of the mission, like what was his favorite movie or dessert did he believe in Mothman? important stuff.
they both shouted as they ran in to get him, Steve soon scooped him up from the ground and ran to the nearest bench and placed him there.
That made him laugh, apparently Peter was good at that, He paused and looked down at his cookie as silence filled the room again. "Hey...I'm sorry about the roof."
Danny asked in disbelief, after hearing Ben's story. last night when Ben finally managed to reach their cabin with nothing but a towel he didn't really bother waking up his friends to tell them what happened, all he cared about was not dying from hyperthermia and getting into warm dry clothing, he waited until the next day after the morning checkup to fill them in on what had happened.
" I'm actually prepared for that".He ran out of the bathroom and came back holding a pair of black glasses.
"When I went to get the scissors, I found these in lost and found, they have been there for a year now, so it's cool, they probably belonged to a counselor".
The couple continued to slow dance a similar, the tighter they seem to hold each other the easier it was to temporary let go of the lingering fear of the future and get lost in the bliss of their young love as the band continued to play.
"Okay, the first thing you have to know is that my Pops, has a beard now that's why I drew him with one second of all, he wakes up early every day, it doesn't matter if it's the weekend or summer vacation, he has a morning routine and he always follows it. he goes running in the morning, comes back, showers, and then starts making breakfast."
" Steve calm down the helmet absorbed the most of the hit now go get ice, don't worry I'll take care of him, now go"
Me: Okay I just posted the fifth chapter I already have rough notes for the 6th and 7th  chapters so I can easily get these done before the end of the month, what could possibly happen?
Peter just ignored them as he picked up his card and bit the inside of his cheek as he studied them.
"Nothing, your father will shortly inform you".Jarvis gathered all of his clothing and putting them all in a basket."Don't worry about it, my boy"
That he didn't know, he figured that they weren't around anymore, considering that Peter never mentions his grandparents, but it didn't change the fact that it made it sad to hear. He then tightened the hug.
"Well, let's just say that the postage may say New your but it truly came from your father's latest questionable life choice" Jarvis replied with the same annoyed tone as before.
" No, he has dated a looooooooot of people, but none of them were serious, I've only met two people out of the billion he dated , they were both cool, one was this weird doctor, and another one was a really fun guy who listened to old music, but they didn't stick around for too long, what about pops did he ever try to marry someone else?"
"You're lucky your too cute to get mad at, welcome home kid" He looked down at his sweat-soaked sweatshirt."I would offer you a hug but maybe when I'm wearing something less...wet and smelly"
"You are something else, kiddo".He shook his head and chuckled, he pushed Peter forward."What do you think?"
"Ewww,You two are weird " Peter said with a chuckle, it was odd for him, the only married couple he had ever been around, or any couple for that matter had been Happy and Pepper and they never acted overly affectionate or joked like this, yeah he had witnessed his godmother constantly stroke Happy's hair, and take his hand. And Happy always had her coffee ready first, and smile every time she walked into the room but nothing like this, his uncle's acted like friends who got married, he didn't know that was possible ,he wondered how his Dads acted when they were married or how they would act when he and his brother would get them back together.
"Why didn't you get along with dad the first time you two met, what happened after you drew him and how did you end up getting married in a boat?"
Peter explained, as he took the picture from him and placed it with the others. He paused before picking up another picture. He hesitated for a bit but he decided to show it to Ben.
From there everything was white noise to Tony, all he registered was that wasn't related to his parents was that Jarvis would look after the kids as he went to the hospital.
Steve pulled Tony's smaller frame to his much bigger one and placed his hand on his waist while Tony rested his head n Steve's shoulder as they started to move along with the music.
He, Ben and Danny, were all sitting on the floor outside the mess hall, along with a few kids. They were playing poker, Ben had a pile of goodies next to him, that he had won from the other kids, it ranged from Candy, potato chips, pocket change, and a few headbands and bracelets.
He turned to his mom."I almost forgot about those, Obie gave it to me, he sent a basket and everything, I guess it was his way of apologizing. Apparently, nothing says "I'm sorry, I almost got your marriage annulled, and ruined your husband's career, and led you to have one of the most complicated adoptions in the world," like baby clothes, but at least he apologized, unlike Howard." He couldn't help but sound bitter about that.
"So, what came from new york?" He asked as he put his bag on the bed and begun to take out his clothing.
"To be fair he always does it with a purpose" She leaned forward."So who is it, and what's the story?"
He nodded and cleared his throat before getting up and straightening out his uniform, he then offered his hand to Tony.
Peter offered Ben, as he put his folded up close in the edge of the deck, he was still wearing a towel around his waist but he knew he would have to leave it behind soon.
He pointed at an old sketch, it looked even older than the one he had on the walls of his room. The drawing was simple, it was just what looked to be a younger version of his dad sitting at a windowsill with his attention on the city below him, it wasn't very detailed but it was still an incredible drawing.
Peter ran off and came with a stool and placed it down where he was standing."Why don't you finish it?"
he was just guessing where all of this stuff went and ended up dumping all of the clothes into the hamper that was next to the door.
There was a long period where Peter swore that he was going to die out of boredom when his pops and aunt had to take care of the grown-up stuff side of getting the new place but it wasn't anything he wasn't used to thanks to his dad's work, plus they had promised him a cheeseburger and after that the batting cages, he had never gone to one but it sounded like fun to celebrate, so that gave him enough motivation to keep his usual upbeat attitude.
He was taken out of the conversation when he heard his aunt say "I'll look into it" followed by her making her way up the stairs
The poker match was almost as intense as the fencing duel, the crowd around them had grown even larger just like the pile of snacks and coins between them, had grown.
He covered his mouth and shook his face he had a habit of doing that on the rare occasion when truly didn't want to try something, he wouldn't have guessed his brother would like that combination after he was the picky eater of the two.
He paused and tried to think before he said anything."Well...you see I'm curious and you can agree that "He had to leave and he loved you" isn't enough".
As they looked through the photo album Ben would occasionally ask where it was taken or what was going on that day, but tried not to do it too much so his dad wouldn't get suspicious, he noticed some of them were obviously taken by Peter but the other's was anybody's guess,
He didn't want to think about that, he didn't want to hate his pops or his dad, he wanted to enjoy their time together not resent it, plus he had a mission he decided to push back the tears and ignore all those feelings.
"It could be Nathaniel, but know don't worry I'll settle for lunch, plus I also like your name, Benjamin".She said putting an arm around him, bringing him close, and kissing the side of his hair.
Peter headed straight for the sketchbook, he started flipping through it, this wasn't the first time he had seen his pops' work, his dad had given him three drawings, and told him it was from his other dad, they were dedicated to him, and everything, the same day he gave him the picture, they were old, and time had made the paper go from white to yellow. They weren't as refined as these ones, but he still loved them. Especially, since up until now, they were the only way he could truly connect to his pops, a picture only told him what he looked like, but the drawings were much more personal and gave him a small glimpse of who he was, at first, he just hung them in his room, with pieces of tape. Later on, he worked up the courage to ask his dad for a frame for each one, but now he had the real thing, but he didn't know what to say to him, and he also, though he was a different person which made bonding a bit of a challenge.
Ben took a deep breath and started cutting, the first cut was the worst, it took everything he had not to scream, although, he was pretty sure Peter did. After that it became easier he continued to compare the length of his own hair, as he continued cutting, soon the floor became decorated with Snippets of brown, slightly curled, hair. This continued for about an hour until Ben finally put down the scissors.
also, the first time I wrote this I wanted to see if I could fit aunt may into this but then I thought that if she was in this story she wouldn't have allowed any of this to happen.
"Yeah, yeah, that's his name, um... you do remember that friend I was telling you about in the car? it belongs to him, I must have packed it by accident, I don't know how that happened because he has an almost unhealthy attachment to it like it's a security blanket, like for example if he was in a place far away from home in a stressful situation he would definitely want it with him."
"Wow, slow down, sport, I promise I'll tell you everything but first, " Peter noticed as a malicious smile appeared on his dad's face."Stay here with your uncle Bucky,"
Peter put the phone in his mouth and got up to try to get whatever was under him when he managed to get it, it turned out to be a shoe, he threw it to the other side of the closet and sat back down.
Peter un-tensed his shoulders at that but he knew he had to be more careful. "By the way dad, these pancakes are amazing "I can tell you like them," he said with a chuckle as he grabbed a napkin and clean Peter's face."When did you become such a messy eater?"
"Alright, I'm going to go order and get is a table, but don't think I'm not coming back for a re-match."
"You really did miss them, huh? and yes, one where hopefully, I don't feel like a paint cover sardine "
Been looked up and was brought face to face with the man in the photo, it was an older version of him, but it was still the man that he had been wanting to meet since he was 9 years old and he was finally here, he was finally here with his dad.
But when he saw that this kid was fast and quick on his feet he decided not to hold back, but apparently, he took it too far, when he delivered his final hit.
"Okayhaveanicedayhereisyourpen!" He shouted as he put down the Pen on the table and ran towards his pops and Natasha. He hugged his dad hiding his face in his stomach praying that his uncle Bruce wouldn't look this way.
Peter was flabbergasted, how could she know and could she trust her? even if he could he didn't have much of a choice, so he did what he was told.
"...Right, let's eat" He clapped his hands together and changed the subject as quickly as possible. Peter bit the inside of his cheek as he observed that last exchange
"It's bound to happen sooner or later, by the way, sir a package arrived for you this morning, from new york".
"Hey, don't look at me, if anyone is to blame it's your dad and Pepper, you know how they get when it comes to your safety."
Peter felt like someone had suddenly shot him with a freeze ray and dropped the phone this day couldn't get any worse
Ben was anxiously waiting for Happy to pick him up, he was playing with his hands, trying to remain calm.
The three boys were watching everything unfold from a window that was located in the back of the cabin.
"Okay, Dippy, this is what you have to know. My house is pretty big, but for now, we'll just focus on my room, the lab, and the garage."
"No... well, except for Luke Skywalker, the water got his face, but if he can handle losing a hand, he can handle this."
"It's a newfound love?" Peter tried to sound as convincing as possible "So dad, this is where you're going to paint now? His pop's looked around."Well after your aunt Tasha spent all this time helping me it would be rude not to".
"Fine, but I won't wear them until we leave, and what about you? my dad knows that I would rather die, than put on my contacts on, so how are we going to explain to him that I'm now wearing them 24/7?!".
"We should ask them, like go up to them and say, hey dads, why didn't you tell us you adopted twins and then bailed?."
"Okay, kids there's nothing to see here! We have more activities to attend to so Peter...I'm sorry, Ben, apologize, and Ben... I'm sorry, Peter, I am so sorry. You do the same, so the two of you can dry off, alright?"
" Ben, your dad's waiting for you over there, it was nice meeting you, I hope we see you next summer."
Ben didn't notice that he had said "You" instead of him but thankfully his dad didn't notice either, he was more preoccupied with the tears pouring down his eyes, Ben then buried his face in his dad's chest as he comforted him.
"Wow!" Peter ran inside, this place was much bigger than the other studio, it even had a second story well it was more like a giant balcony than a second floor."Pop's cheek this out".
Ben took a deep breath, dropping his towel, and started walking towards the lake, he could hear how the others were giggling in whistling at him, someone even shouted out
He said to himself, as soon the Ball shot out he forced himself not to flinch or closed his eyes and took the swing as hard as he could and..he did it, he dropped the bat and turned to Steve and Natasha with a giant smile as he started jumping up and down with a huge ear to ear smile.
"You ain't that cute," He said as he got up but his husband immediately wrapped his arm around his waist, hugging him from behind and rested his head on his shoulder and Sam placed his hands on top of Bucky's and smile sweetly at his husband.
It was still a little bit longer than Ben's, but for a second, he almost forgot he was looking at in the mirror and not the boy.
Bucky said before pulling him in for a hug. At first, Peter stood frozen but eventually, he hugged him back.
"Inside and out, seriously, Ben, I'm the one with the glasses which obviously means that I'm the smart one."
"I like your spirit, soldier, and no matter how sweet your intentions are there's no need for you to repeat your wedding vows. I propose we don't think about the shit-storm that is waiting for us out there and instead..."
Peter watched as everybody got off the bus, he told himself that everything was okay and that he had to calm down.
He was looking over some of his own notes, of his latest reason why his dad didn't disown him, or project, as his mom helped him tidy up.
Happy was referring to the policy, they had in place. That encourages the kids to solve their problems in a civil matter, instead of calling their parents at the first sight of trouble, opting to use that as a last resort along with a zero technology policy.
With his arrival at New York City is Mission has started, now taking a Bens Place Peters job is to figure out tell their parents and why they broke up but the most important mission is to spend time just Pops pretending to be a completely different person proves to be harder than expected, especially considering that his actions are raising eyebrows all over his new house.
"How do you know I'm the youngest? according to Jarvis, I'm the tall twin, and yeah he is, he even said we could work on this go-kart together " This time Ben was the worried one, he knew that time differences could mess with you "Hey, Pete, what time is it over there?"
Ben's eyes widen he knew this song, his pops would actually sing it when he had nightmares, and every time he would ask where it would come from he would just say somewhere special.
Opening the door and Peking inside, he saw his dad talking on the phone, he seemed frustrated and was surrounded by big books, no, those weren't books they were, photo albums.
" So after you're done with your whole secret mission, if you're still in New York maybe we can hang out or you can message me".
Peter quickly got up to try to close the window, but it was stuck. Ben soon came to his aid and with their combined strength they managed to close it. Peter kneel down on the ground and started picking up all of the pictures as fast as he could. With Ben quickly joining him.
"You know, for people who are constantly trying to keep me out of the spotlight you guys make some questionable decisions."
Maria looked up at the screen and noticed it was on the news, and did as her son asked."One would think you'd be keeping your eyes on the mailbox, instead of the TV."
"Last but not least, various pictures of your family that includes your dear old dad, Pepper, Jarvis, your uncle Rhodey and Bruce, and of course yours truly in case you get homesick?"
They both sat at the same time, which caused them to freak out, even more. There was silence between the two until finally Peter slowly lifted his arm and extended it to Ben, it took a few seconds, but eventually Ben did the same. As they touched hands, they didn't discover the secrets of the universe or even felt a static shock go through their bodies, but it still felt weird shaking hands. Johnny slowly made his way up to Peter, handing him the case that contained his glasses. Peter put them on and gave Ben a double look hoping that maybe his blurry vision was playing a game with him, but as he locked eyes with him again, it was confirmed this kid was his clone with shorter hair.
He noticed how his pops were following something with his eyes, but before he could figure out what he was watching, he had run off, seconds later he felt a familiar hand on his shoulder. He turned around and was greeted by his uncle, he was slightly out of breath, with his hair tied up in a messy ponytail, and he was wearing gym clothes.
He looked closer almost as if he didn't notice it himself, even though he was the one who painted it, "I guess"
The apartment had a simple layout, it had three bedrooms, one was used as storage/office space, a kitchen that was next to the living room, and one bathroom.
Ben, panicked but luckily for him, the seat belt light came on which means that the plane was about to land.
"It's okay, it's okay". his dad was obviously uncomfortable talking about this, but he was doing his best to make him feel better.
"So, I'll skip him, now Jarvis is basically our grandpa, but you have to be careful, because if he or Pepper figure out our plan, then it's game over. Now my dad is always up, he doesn't really have a morning routine, but if he isn't working in the lab then he'll sleep."
he quickly put on his seatbelt and buried his fingernails into the seat, as if the plane was about to crash.
Johnny rolled his eyes at his friend not impressed by his offer "But fine." He jumped off the bed and onto the floor. "I'll take it, let's go."
