Just as I opened my mouth with some wit about being his own physician by giving up doctoring he cut me off with a scowl. An olive branch lay fortunately to hand.
I remained unmoved even as Simpson shifted in his seat, evidently wondering if he had used up his own store of wisdom by coming here. I knew this was pique, and a sly revenge for my query that morning whether Holmes really needed to fill his pipe less than five minutes after he had finished filling me. I am only prepared to give him certain kinds of satisfaction.
“I did not say it to convince you,” said the Reverend Peto, after I had found the situation in the end hive just as he had claimed the bees had told him it was, and was standing there working out how best to get rid of him without fuss. “The bees are not our unthinking slaves, as they know you have sometimes feared, but willing partners in a joint enterprise. In return for our protection they graciously allow us use of their surplus and make our fruit and flowers fertile. It is in all our interests to work in the closest harmony, and shared confidences, I have found, create the most perfect harmony. They want to know more about you, Mr Holmes. You do not have my gift, but fortunately that does not matter. Long association with humanity has made them the best of listeners.”
Clad in stout, tartan plush whilst Holmes reclined, fidgeting, in fraying sleeves of  mouse-coloured felt, I knelt by his feet and unlaced his boots until they were so loose they all but fell into my hands. His woollen stockings were a challenge, more so as he made no move to help me but only lay back with one arm hitched over the sofa back and the other hand stuffed firmly in his pocket, an expression on his face of distracted affection, mixed with his usual habit of continual scrutiny – a pretence of detachment over a core of exact dissection.
The end result of their labours was this: nothing to tie the victims together save hair – so to speak. No family connection, no shared social circle, not near neighbours. They had followed different advertisements in different papers and magazines (which leads were carefully noted in the ledger). Even the pieces they had bought were all different in style and colour – though each had been bought and fitted at Number 94.
Our former client was all eagerness to help us in return, to refrain from asking unnecessary questions even as we had given him room to speak his necessary answers. He did not know our quarry himself, but one of his older colleagues had at least heard of William Brace. He was 'on the up', as they say, courting illustrious clients of his own. There was a little more curiosity there – what need had Sherlock Holmes to do with him? – but not so much as to get in my way.
It would be, no doubt, but she had brought her trouble to Sherlock Homes, and she had perforce to trust him.
“Pascal was willing to wager far more on an essentially unprovable proposition concerning the very existence of the Deity. Really, Mr Holmes, what have you to lose?”
“You put a serious obstacle in the way of my helping you. What objection can the other Miss Heacham have to me, and to finding a solution to the problem?”
"Gone downhill a touch since Gusty Manns left," remarked our host, gesturing at the group of players, who murmured at this in a good-natured sort of way, for there was no sting in it. "Gents, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes, emergency second chair fiddle many a time when Ernie Thompson, God rest him, was…indisposed." Some of the older men exchanged meaningful looks.  Henry Wood shrugged an apology. "But if you’ll both excuse me, duty calls," and he struck up again, leading them in a rousing two-step. Several of the orchestra not constantly required for the melody slunk curious and amused glances at us. Moving aside to let the flood of couples take the floor, I ventured that some at least must be readers of mine.
Touched as touch paper, to make a warming fire or an uncontrolled blaze. Touched by the sun to robust health or to prostration.   Touched to attractive eccentricity or to frank madness. A simple touch of hands, clasped in the darkness and in the face of danger. A touch that is the very opposite of simple.
“Holmes! Even for you, that is surely a leap too far, and a really outrageous suggestion to boot. Please tell me you did not so much as imply in her hearing that there was anything improper going on?”
"I put it to you, m’lud, that coincidence is to Mr Sherlock Holmes as hay to a fish. Let us therefore consider the evidence. He means to quit London, he has admitted this without the need for cross examination. He has closed his London operations, made an appointment with his tailor – no doubt to provide him with new country tweeds. It only remains to explain to you how he was aided and abetted in his labours by a gaggle of, of…"
“Utterly fagged out, if you must know. Pretty well the whole day spent doctoring people who ought to be their own physician. Headaches – shortsighted and won’t wear spectacles. Gout – drinks a pint of port wine and dines on chops every day. Pain in the side – tight-laced to a waist of sixteen inches. Broken toe – couldn’t be troubled to light a candle to go upstairs in the dark and fell over the cat. Gout again.”
“Tsk. Well, as you have your professional interests, so I have mine. Miss Emma has brown eyes. Both Mr Heacham and his wife, whose photographs and portraits have pride of place in the library at Low Hall, were blue-eyed. Are we back in medical territory yet, Watson?”
“I was an only child of elderly parents who spent most of the year in India. Individuality is the mark of man; loneliness is his curse.  The voice of the bees, since I first heard it and was first chastised for saying so, and the consciousness of their society were the greatest solace to me as a solitary child, and continues now, as a bachelor who grows old alone. It may prove so to you.”
I found far less curiosity and censure about the inhabitants of Low Hall than I expected. They were more interested in news from London, in the price of livestock and the state of the roads. A few criticised the absence from church on Sundays, but more excused it on the grounds that old Mr Heacham had never set foot there, and it did not prevent him being a fair-minded employer and generous to the unfortunate, unlike some they could name.
“Ah, no, John. That you came to me was more than enough. Come now, come to bed. Yours or mine? Time for an unnatural act.”
“Naturally. The opinion of one who knows the candidate very well is always sought before a vote.” He passed a hand over his face but I saw it was not from shame, only from exasperation. “You cannot be a member of the Diogenes Club and commit…fictions.”
Head in his hands, he broke down and wept like a child. Watson patted his shoulder whilst I waited, impatient, for the truth to come calling.
His answering smile was utterly filthy. It widened to a lecherous grin as he felt my prick stir against his bare belly.
"His youngest brother. But well done, dear fellow. You have noticed the end of a thread: follow it! Speaking of threads," went on Holmes, "I have made an appointment tomorrow morning with Mr Davies at Sackville Street. You might want to come along as well."
He started so that the brandy glass nearly jumped out of his hands. He set it aside carefully and took several deep breaths to bring back some measure of calm.
He hauled it out and then waited, pointedly, until I turned to the wall, listening as he relieved himself with a heaving sigh. Even the most intimate of friends may not share everything. Perhaps one day.  My memory obliged with a pleasant vision of him simply naked, just to be going on with.
“Let’s have a look, then.” I offered him his chair and a gesture toward the leg which he had been favouring all the way up the stairs.
Miss Heacham gathered her skirts, sweeping them to the side and out of touching distance, reclaiming her own territory.
“Yet in your former occupation, would you not have questioned the witnesses, as well as observe them?”
The truth was, I wanted to complicate them, had wanted to for years, before the Park Lane airgun, before Reichenbach, even before Norwood and Mary Morstan. Ordinary men have their secrets, too. Three continents hold a great many women and I have held my share of them. I have loved and lusted, greeted and parted, known and enjoyed - and been enjoyed. It is – just – permissible to hint (to boast a little, if I am honest) at those adventures in public, even in print.
“Would you let him kiss your mouth, your belly, put his lips round that rosy cock, suck on your fingertips and put them inside him? Would this be your pleasure, John Watson?”
“That rather depends on the persuasion. And on the persuader.” I stroked the back of his hand where it covered mine and watched him stretch, luxuriantly, in his chair, exposing bare skin under the shifting edges of the mouse-coloured dressing gown. I bent and kissed along his collarbone ‘til he was breathing hard.
“Oh, you will, will you, tyrant?” I answered, running my hand in measured time down his belly. A groan followed it from his chest down to his loins. “Someone should teach you that he who would give orders had better learn to take them first.”
By the time he slipped into my room on silent, stockinged feet, I had stripped to my skin, washed the day’s endeavours away and taken up my nightshirt.
A diamond cuts the hardest stone, yet a hammer blow will shatter it. As I sat by the window contemplating the ruin of my hopes, Holmes, who surely knew all of it, down to how many months it would take me to repay my debts and all the economies I must make to do it, said nothing. I thought that I understood. What was there to say in the face of such credulity? Had it been a client, pieces of his skin would have been clinging to the lampshades.  I had no better excuse. Well, if I was worth nothing without Sherlock Holmes, I ought at least to admit it.
"You would do it first and tell me afterwards." There was no heat in it, only the voice of long experience. He tossed a wave of brandy to the back of his throat and regarded me steadily over the rim of his glass. "You have and you are."
He said it again now, stuggling into the sleeves of a bottle green evening gown. Heaven knew where he’d found the costume and how he’d allowed for his height: I could only hope it hadn’t graced the stage recently enough for recognition. A merciful veil, a merciless hat plus his own best boots polished to a glow and he was gone, telling me not to trouble to wait up.
, and, so I understand, sexual deviance of the filthiest sort. Can he be persuaded to turn Queen’s evidence against himself and his accomplice?”
Other people’s secrets fell before him like the walls of Jericho. His own could not be had for love, money, deduction, nor any other way than deliberate gift. It so happened that I was about to be offered the deepest secret of all, as an unlooked-for gift. But I did not know that, then. I only knew that he had decided to find out, then to keep and protect, the secrets of Low Hall.
We swung south along Whitehall then across to the river bank and rattled to a stop outside New Scotland Yard. The handsome, modern brick building reared over us, striped as a seaside awning in red and white, turreted at each corner like a castle of the Law. It was the pride of the Metropolitan Police Commissioners and its endless, indistinguishable internal corridors and stairways the bane of most of its officers and all its visitors.
Both assured him there had been none -which did not stop him opining that with ladies, well, you never knew, they wouldn't come right out and say it, you'd have to read them right to tell.
And, as we are not mincing words, I loved him for his direction. There is no shame, only wisdom, in bowing to greatness or to greater knowledge, only so long as it is earned and put to proper use.  I did not care to know, and have never since asked, where he had learned to enjoy a partner’s complete submission while he held them gently and completely still by the back of the neck and thrust quick and shallow between their lips.
In most respects, I daresay that is just as well. What a nightmare to be privy to the torrent of triviality that, judged from their speech, bathes the brain of the vast majority. What need, too, of detectives? My meat and drink has been deception, dishonesty, false pride and hypocrisy, and the crop of all of them shows no sign of failure.
nuisance, no doubt. She and her sister resided at Low Hall, close by a village in the county of Bedfordshire. Their family had lived there for many generations, farming in a moderately prosperous way. It was clear that this prosperity was to be understood in the past tense. Holmes might, as he did, deduce it from her sleeve-ends or bootlaces – for she was well, if plainly, dressed in twill and country tweeds, not in the least openly shabby. I simply read more of the newspapers than the personal columns and Police reports. Estate sales and wage disputes, the flow of labourers from field to town to seek their fortune: it was all the same tale. Farming, by and large, did not pay any more.
“Offers have been made, yes, Mr Holmes. Offers for the estate outright, for parcels of outlying fields. Anything they wanted outside the wall, we have agreed. It only served to encourage the hyenas.”
Just then, we were interrupted by a sharp ring on the shop bell. A figure peering in at the join 'twixt door and display window was no customer, instead a painfully young and fresh example of uniformed constable just scraping at the minimum height and thin enough to hide behind his own whistle. Miss de Merville let him in and was about to make introductions when he cut in, full of earnest, helmet under one arm as he addressed us as if we were cadets.
. They're stories. Very popular, very exciting, I'm sure, yes, very well done, but this is the twentieth century. Besides all that, independent detectives aren't needed nowadays. What we in the Force call 'scientific policing' - started right here in London, sir - is the way forward. No doubt of it. Allow me to say…"
“I, John Hamish Watson, am a doctor of medicine, a writer of middling talent but a good agent, a crack shot and a lover of both women and men. I fell in love with a man for the first time at fifteen and for the last time at forty-two.”
I was certainly not expecting to be surprised in the middle of the night by the bedroom door opening and the dressing-gown clad form of Holmes tiptoeing in. He must have assumed that I would be fast asleep and so I should have been, were it not for a cramp in my leg which I had not long worked out. I was drifting in a dozy stream on my way downriver when he turned the knob, but quite awake by the time he reached my bedside.
I had no more instructions, and did not know what else to do besides walk back up to the Hall. As if he had been expecting me to do exactly that, Holmes-as-Heacham-sahib, coming the other way, greeted me in the lane with a furled umbrella.
We had just reached the part where he digs his heels into the mattress and curses in gutter French, when the front door jumped under an assault from a stick like a miniature battering ram. All usual assistance having been given the day off to join the popular celebrations, one of us would have to go down and answer it. At least, so I thought. Holmes would have none of it. He let himself slip, still stiff, from my mouth - with an Anglo-Saxon expletive this time - but tried to stop my progress out of bed, insisting:
I refused to be drawn any further, not yet. A love of theatre, of the curtain rising on the final act, was no doubt some of it but so too was the chance I saw to have that minute of frank conversation, with another man's peculiar passions for my entrée. If I was right, of course. Three reasons now to aim for that: the opportunity, Watson's usual unstinting admiration: not to mentioned, of course, to the essential pre-requisite of not being wrong.
I all but fell on one knee from the shock, before I remembered a long-ago school-master’s determination that his pupils be prepared for
I leaned towards him and took both his hands. We were both very still. There was something in the air and we both scented it at the same time.
One moment it’s never been so far from me, I am reaching in desperation for climax and mortally afraid it will never arrive, the next all crashing awareness, shouting pleasure, nerve-endings screwed-up like paper and flung away soaring and I am saying his name over and over and he mine and all the while that scalpel. All the while.
We, for our part, would ever preserve in the less salubrious groves of memory the night we had hidden in one of the rooms of that same tower, keeping each other awake by telling some of the very filthiest jokes and stories we knew.
"I believe," said he, returning the press of my fingers with dawning relief and morning joy, "that perhaps you are. All appearances to the contrary."
“The glory of the garden is all down to my sister. Not a day goes by without her finding some little job to make it yet more beautiful. You should see it in summer.”
"Only repairs and finishes are done here, not the original collection or manufacture…ah, here she is, gentlemen."
"Those who talk of 'mere money' so often have least need of it," put in her patroness. "People like Kitty know its true worth. I feel myself rather to be in her debt, so you see we balance the books fair and square between us." It was hard to credit that these were the same creatures who the year before might have been tearing each other's own hair out.
"It was kind of you, Doctor, all the same," said Kitty now, calm and collected in green cotton velvet and an intricate piled hairpiece of chestnut and gold combined that added a good five inches to her height.  "And kinder still of Miss Violet to set me up here when I was done. I used to do that" – she gestured to the repair battalion – "before
“Try to pluck the fruit before it is ready to come off the tree, and all you get is an ache in the guts. I’d rather a fist in the face, thank you. Although you might want to shift your weight onto your left foot next time. So, are you ready to end the word games?”
He knew, then. Knew at least some of it, had marked it somehow from my manner, from the way I folded my pocket-handkerchief, from a long-ago innocent slip of the tongue. I had been so careful, so careful but of course, I could never have been careful enough. This was Sherlock Holmes. Had he also guessed – no, he never guesses – had he seen the rest: that in my divided nature I had turned to him, as a spring flower to the sun?
The doctor in question had kept a manfully straight face through the whole ludicrous exchange, but I had seen his fingers twitch, longing to pick up his notebook and get it all down. When he shook the little man's hand, he was all sincerity.
"I, on the other hand have perhaps some sympathy with your position." In fact I had none, but I can act the fifth column when need be. "Women are surely not to be trusted. Creatures of guile and scheme, of persuasion and temptation, conniving together to create illusion. They think they have the better of we weak-willed men, but no. Mind will always overcome matter, so long as matter is put in its place. Mind is man, woman is matter. No-one is really hurt, after all – only a little damage here and there, only a little righteous anger, a little justified fear. What is a scrap of fabric to us, a lock of false hair?"
I hauled away one more inch and regarded my left boot, placed as it was against the ramrod spine of the world’s only consulting detective. Between my sole and his skin were two layers of calico, one of cotton lawn and two of Chinese silk brocade reinforced with Arctic whalebone.
"Remember, Watson. Theories to fit all the facts, not the other way round. Clothes, quite as often as manners, maketh man. Or boy."
His long back, pressed against mine by the narrow confines of a well-worn mattress that dipped in the middle. His careless hand on my shoulder in the morning as he rose. Simple friendship was what he offered, this man who had no friends save one. It was not for me to complicated matters.
The silver cigarette case and the remains of the wallpaper were not where he had left them, nor anywhere in the room, although he did turn up fourpence ha’penny in coppers in the toe of the Persian slipper, and a lost trouser button of mine whilst fishing among the sofa cushions.
"Oh, I solved a small matter for him last year – you were in Scotland at the time. Some missing Malayan beetles, if memory serves. No crime was involved: it was all to do with the strength of the formaldehyde. Or lack thereof. An eminent naturalist to be sure, but not a chemist. If you hold your jaw at that angle, my dear Watson, something exotic may fly in. In the circumstances I should not care to risk it."
An orchestra played a popular tune, to which Holmes’ left-hand fingers twitched over ghostly frets. He waited for a break in the programme, hastened up to the conductor and greeted him as an old acquaintance.
“I want…I want to kiss my friend, my fellow lodger, the world’s first consulting detective. I want to take Sherlock Holmes, toast of London and curse of the criminal classes, into my bed at the top of this house. I want to break the law with him. I want him to loosen my tongue with more kisses first, until I can say it all, ask for it all. Come here, man.”
“Miss Heacham. I venture to suggest that the gentlemen in question may have had, at worst, mixed motives, and intended the opposite of insult. Word gets about; you are not a complete recluse. You cannot be unaware that there may be a…personal equation in these experiments?”
Her Majesty beckoned over the footman, who took from under his coat an object wrapped in plaid silk and presented it to Holmes. He is so seldom rendered speechless, save in certain intimate circumstances which it would have been extremely unwise to recall at that moment, that I went to look over his shoulder. It was a watercolour, about six inches by ten. The subject was a busy roadway under a grand arch – more than an arch, a massive gateway in red sandstone emblazoned with that year’s date and the words “Blackwall Tunnel”.
“Holmes!” I hissed. He jumped at my voice, swore and clutched at himself in a very odd fashion that, in the darkness, I couldn’t quite make out.
"If half of what I suspect is even half true, better try to find his place of employment and see him there."
The postmistress, about to put up the shutters for the day, told me all about it – all about the real owner of Low Hall, the son of old Mr Heacham’s deceased elder brother and an Indian lady, “of the highest rank in those parts, practically a princess”, come to claim his property in England. To think, she said, that all this time we never knew. The misses Heacham had welcomed him, to their great credit, and it was thought he would continue to let them live there, having occupation in the law and desiring to live in London. Probably just as well, not many of his sort in Bedfordshire to be had, he’d feel out of place. And he was in correspondence with Mr Sherlock Holmes! He’d sent Mr Holmes ahead no doubt, to check that all was in order, well, you had to wonder why a famous detective had come here, it’s not as if we go in much for
Like a bird of a rare and threatened species darting out of the canopy only in fits and starts, looking always for danger yet compelled to seek a mate even against my better judgment, I wheeled and soared, plunged and hovered -  but in the end alighted again and again only to a place of safety. To silence.  To waiting for the right moment, when our stock of all possible moments was steadily running out.  Middle age had surprised us from behind, then overtaken and raced ahead, taking with it Watson's waistline, dragging off my ability to stay awake for days on end, ruffling the hairs on our heads one by one as we slept and returning them grey in the morning - or not returning them at all.
"My Inspector's of the view that it's commercial jealousy – what with all the high class custom done here. I must ask you ladies, have there been any threats made, any bad blood with other establishments lately?"
I hid behind a sporting paper and tried hard not to think of Foote settling into distinguished middle age, probably with an equally accomplished wife and a troop of well-scrubbed children to occupy the Headmaster’s lodge at Fitton. I persuaded myself, just as I had at sixteen, that I disliked Foote, that I would not cross the street to shake his hand. Yet the truth was that there had been many days when I would have gladly taken a cricket ball on the shin to see a look of sympathy for me on that perfect face. The folly of youth indeed. Damn the idea that schooldays are ‘the best days of your life’.
“I prefer a reliable witness,” I said, knowing full well that many of his most successful cases had stood square on his deductions, not a witness within sniffing distance.
I had not been in a position to confirm this or not. Wishing, as I did, to be in such a position the following morning, I held back from so much as hinting that he might be mistaken. Domestic harmony is worth a little restraint, and clean linen was, thanks to the estimable Mrs Hudson, easily re-stocked.
He had had more than just the one brandy. There was a soft weight to his footstep; the sour-sweet tang of the grape press tinted his breath; a delicious clumsiness in the fingers that caught me by the nape of the neck, his whole frame stretched on tiptoe to kiss me soundly.
“That, Mr Holmes, simply had a hole in it that you had failed to notice. Not every clue is what it seems.”
in Rome, earlier this year. As for those stories, you'll be pleased to learn that this is Dr Watson, the author of all that popular excitement."
He sighed. “It was not, in fact, the trousers. I can see that thought striding all over your face, don’t deny it. Those who look at outward appearance are condemned to be proven wrong nine times out of ten. I had come already prepared to test my theory that Miss Anne had something to hide, that her talk of spies and insults hardly matched her evident self-possession. Adopting that disguise enabled me to clear away the old top growth masking the living heart of the plant – if a man who ‘knows nothing of practical gardening’ may be permitted that metaphor.”
Accidentally drowned off the coast of Spain, said the official reports. Rumour whispered darker fates: incurable blindness, social and financial ruin, isolation, despair. Watson was all polite sympathy – thinking no doubt that she must feel responsible. She was ice and stone, unmoved. I thought then that should not like to do her any serious wrong, if only in the interests of my own safety.
She marched into the room, plucked off her hat and stabbed a pearl hatpin back into it with some force. Violet de Merville evidently had no intention of being a victim ever again.
A bird-smuggling ring? A gang of rogue gardeners secretly dealing in the opium poppy? No, it was no use trying to make sense of it yet. I must allow myself to be driven hither and thither by the wind, by the cabman and, as ever, by Sherlock Holmes.
I kept silence for a good while, turning the problem inside out and back to front, looking for the shape of it: the joins the thread, the attachment point. Attachment point…
She stood watching us as we made our way back to the main road, hands on hips and shaking her head. We might have been naughty schoolboys and she our indulgent teacher. Holmes slipped his arm in mine to promenade us both up the pavement. Once out of Maisie’s earshot, he began whistling a sea shanty that had two sets of lyrics, one of them overwhelmed with innuendo.
“You have said so yourself. You wish me to read that I am the supreme rationalist, the man who thinks but does not feel, who has never loved nor is ever likely to, who desires no-one and nothing save work and white poison. Other people may read it too, of course, may pay for the privilege of thinking that they know Sherlock Holmes. Well, there is little harm in that and some distinct good, in the circumstances. But let us have no fiction here, between the two of us. Let us have unvarnished truth.”
"Granted. The boys, though. She may have fussed over mud on the landing carpet and the noise, but I saw her slip them biscuits and sit them by her kitchen fire when their boots were wet. I was glad to see Wiggins at the Yard. Quite the coincidence."
naming things, by constraining into fit and proper vessels the referred pain of impossible desires. We come to know, somehow, that a man may love but not excessively: that is woman’s domain. That a man may love another man but not lie with him: that is woman’s duty - and, if she is fortunate, her pleasure.  A man who does either is effeminate, unmanly. If he does the first, he will get a name as a fool. If he does the second, or even thinks of doing it…well, better not speak of that at all.
"Is an hypothesis, Watson," replied Holmes, like the cat that has the cream but may consent to share it if sufficiently impressed by the puppy’s tricks. "Test it."
known only as Number 94. We settled upon that name," she added, seeing my frown, "to distinguish it from our more vulgar competitors."
“Yes, from behind is best, then he cannot see what I am about to do, can only guess, though he would have it that he never guesses.”
A cloth and lukewarm water in a tin bowl, the remains of my hasty doctoring, still sat on the hearthrug and I began with a thorough cleansing of his sound foot. Each toe; the rough pad of his heel; the smooth and soaring architecture of his sole; the sinews over the arch that flexed and stood proud as any cock-stand; the ivory mounts of his ankle bone: each washed and dried and warmed before the fire. Every inch stroked between thumb and forefinger until both of us were breathless; until both of us were hard.
"In boys’ clothes or out of them, one of my most effective agents. You know it was she who signalled us that the launch Aurora was making off with Jonathan Small and his accomplice aboard? Eight years old, motherless and fatherless, no more than a scrap of schooling. But for perseverance and keenness? None better.  Somehow she fell in with Wiggins and his lads and thence with me. That is to say, with us. Every one of those winks was as good as a thank you note, to you as much as me. I told them all not to say a word to you of my plans, but they remember how you doctored them and for those that had any, their families too, without so much as a farthing exchanged."
Meaning obediently dawned. It had a habit of showing itself for Sherlock Holmes. A moment later, when I had stopped goggling at him as if he had just told me that Mrs Hudson was in the pay of the Metropolitan Police, it fell to me to ask him how on earth had he deduced that?
He has told the world of his pleasure to watch me at work. I tell of mine to see him, fair head (liberally salted with silver now) bent to the task, strong doctor's hands hefting the ledger, one forefinger tracing the columns with precise and delicate strokes, imagining them put to… other uses.
It was far too early in the morning for this sort of thing, but I fell in with it. Life with Sherlock Holmes leaves one with little choice.
He sighed and finally met my eye. “Ah, Watson. Why is it, do you suppose, that the Diogenes keeps silence?”
I was dumbstruck. The number of reasons why I could not think of anything to say in response only increased the more I hesitated. Holmes, skating on the thinnest ice of good manners over a vast lake of impatience, waited as he drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair.
I could only conclude that he looked for no companion himself. Women? “Inscrutable…a quicksand”. Men? Even had I the slightest reason to suppose him given to the same deviance as I was, no-one was his equal, and he could not, would not, pretend or compromise. It was not in his nature.
It was well past time for lunch, so I wrapped my hunger around a beef sandwich and watched him clip pieces off the cabbage roses and swags that had surely been nearer Mrs Filbert’s expansive taste than her daughter’s. Some he dissolved in various tinctures of his own devising, which he kept stored in regiments of bottles on a shelf below the deal table. I was absorbed in my newspaper when a rising stream of muttering flooded over into a tide of frustration accompanied by books and files flying in every direction and a sound thump from an impatient fist on the toes of my left boot.
It had always been the other way round. First the face, the figure of a man would pull me in; only then did I find qualities of the soul to adore and too often, still more to mortally wound me.  Until I fell in love with my friend. As I dropped into a chair, poleaxed with joy and fear, it was all spirit. The flesh came later – roaring to life in the dead of midnight, in the grey hours before dawn, in a glance across a London pavement, at the accidental brush of his hand against mine across the breakfast table.
"Wiggins!" Even as I exclaimed aloud I doubted it. The boy sergeant-at-arms of the Baker Street urchins would be much older now than the laundry boy appeared to be.
Or rather that I was blackballed from it, after being on the waiting list for a year. At a loss to know why, as I had understood that members in good standing had proposed me, I wondered aloud if it was because I was not ‘unclubbable’ enough for them: that I retained my membership of the In & Out, the last shred of my old army career.
‘Trinket’ was not quite how I should have referred to a platinum tiepin containing the most flawless emerald I had ever seen but then, one is apt to measure expectation against experience and this
He laboured as I had my way, as I rolled my hips over his again and again, showing no mercy, giving no quarter to the enemies of cloth and brass, using them for friction, for pressure, for sensations intense and exquisite.
“I must present your fascinating theory to our friends at Scotland Yard. They can make themselves busy investigating the whole of the Houses of Commons and Lords. They make the laws; they must put down on paper all manner of crime and wickedness, even naming it daily in their speeches. How can they not have been tempted to commit the same? Surely some have fallen.”
There was something very odd about his tone. The sun had quite gone down by then, and my own glance out of the window before venturing downstairs yielded nothing more than a boy in livery with a silver-topped cane – surely responsible by now for a hearty dent in Mrs Hudson’s front door – and beside him in the flare of a street lamp, the squat figure of a stout, old lady in widow’s weeds, heavily veiled in lace and leaning on a walking stick. A client, then. An inconsiderate one, at that.
We headed out on foot again, this time towards the river wharves and a square of low, weather-boarded sheds with a slipway cutting through its centre. A stooping figure emerged, wiping oily hands on a rag. As with Holmes at the chandler’s, redistribution rather than removal was the overall result, and nothing short of a steam laundry could have removed the soot that lined every crease in his face and rimmed his hairline.
The moment the handle appeared he knew he was done for. Neatly arranged in a brand new, china chamber-pot were his cigarette case, his magnifier, a white cotton handkerchief and his cut-throat razor.
“However,” Holmes continued, when he’d allowed Simpson’s face to drop just enough, “in your case, I must make an exception. You have done well by your patient. If you could not have cured her in life, with your help we may still cut a cancer out of the ranks of her nearest and dearest.”
“No need, oh, no need for that, my heart,” he gasped. “Only carry on with what you were doing and I’ll…ah,
Therefore, it was all nonsense. It was, and the fact that the image of thousands of silent confidants kept knocking on the door of my brain attic, begging admission, whispering
“You know, I have had quite the fatiguing day myself, doctor. Several chemical experiments needing the most delicate concentration.  Settling the rent. Maintaining the Index. Explaining to Lestrade the salient features of the Preston’s Feather Beds fraud. All that, after being kept up half the night doing heaven knows what under a goose down quilt.”
“Utterly? What if he asked you to kneel to service him, if it was his cock and your lips, his fingers in you?”
“They suggest you consider *not* keeping them apart from their Queen, or else they may indeed decide to desert you
I cannot often follow Holmes’ thoughts merely from his expression, not as he does mine, but as he looked again to the garden the thought that our client was not being straight with us may as well have left bootprints across his face. Yet he did not challenge her.
“Only the latest of so many acts of patriotism and chivalry. You are a knight in your heart, Mr Holmes, with the modesty that values deeds above recognition. You must forgive the hasty sketch – we were obliged to work chiefly from a photograph.”
He had put his hand between my thighs and fondled me with dextrous delicacy, buckling my knees and bucking my hips towards him.
We took our seats on either side of the fire, as we often did when there was no case to write up and Holmes had not disappeared into a chemistry experiment, or into one of his black fits of withdrawal. I expected to be quizzed, to be put under the microscope like a bacterium and all my parts described, but he said nothing, only smoked a long pipe, his faraway eyes deep in thought.
“I cannot disagree. This not about your little romances at all. It is about you, my dear Watson. The fictions about yourself that you disseminate by your evasions and wordplay.  Your word is your bond, and it weaves about you tightly when it ought to set you free.”
The streets were still seething with human traffic all the way to Marble Arch and down Park Lane to The Mall. All of London was out of doors, that day in June in the year 1897. Garlands and bunting drooped across every balcony and shop doorway, rows of smiles in green and red, white and blue. The sun was setting at long last. Merry children shouted, fretful ones whimpered; tired parents herded them up onto omnibuses and down into to the subterranean caves of the Underground railway. A rainbow chaos of burst balloons, lost hair-ribbons and half-eaten toffee apples littered the pavements.
“Its members wish to enjoy the facilities without disturbance, without chit-chat. I swear I would not so much as acknowledge my fellow-members, let alone indulge in trivial conversation with them. I have signed my name to it and my word is my bond.”
Appearances deceive. That is, one might say, their chief function. Consider nature: how the hoverfly mimics the stripes of the wasp - prey masquerading as predator.  We are told in the nursery "do not judge a book by its cover" and, learning to read, may, if we so choose, put that into practice. But we - even I, despite my friend Watson's teasing both myself and his readers to the contrary - cannot read the human mind.
“The truth….” He braced himself and met that truth like a man, “… is that I am like you, and unlike. Your nature is to love widely, across continents, across the sexes, to be generous in your passions. Mine is to keep back everything until I must, to keep close to home, to desire only men, and precious few even of those. I am quite out of the habit of feeling, but not out of the power of it. Out of the practice of passion, but not its anticipation. You have thought about me in that way: one could hardly miss it. I want to tell you…to say…”
“Very droll. I mean that I can bear any injury save to my feet. Put it down to the same quirk of nervous arrangement that gave me perfect pitch, or the ability to spot a false banknote at sight.”
"I must admit, we hadn't looked for a man," the constable reflected. "Puts a whole new complexion on it. Acid being what we in the Force call a woman's weapon – like poison. Wouldn't you say so, Mr Holmes?"
I slid the last frame home with that extreme care which can stand for an explosive gesture, and replaced the lid by way of a smothered exclamation mark. Then I turned away and started off down the path back to my cottage, having neither time nor inclination to engage in his absurd fancies.
"Honestly? I do. You are still in your prime, at the height of your powers. Crime has not gone away, however one might wish it would."
And out it all came. Not in triumph in our sitting room, Holmes leaning against the mantelpiece, pipe in hand but in that rocking hansom, his voice an urgent whisper.
? That’s preposterous! Everyone there knows I have to change details; mix different cases together; hide clients’ identities. It’s basic, civilised behaviour.”
I could so easily have fallen into that trap: could have appeared before Constable Butterworth and the unknown Inspector Portmore in the guise of a fool - and an arrogant fool at that. All but for Watson, my rock and my talisman, who just as we crossed the threshold of Brace's office paused, turned in the doorway and leaned towards me.
“Drat. Why did the architect of this place put in so many windows facing the street? Damn twilight, damn candles, damn the Jubilee!”
“I am sorry for your plight, but consider mine. No, not that.” he waved away what I had opened my mouth to say. “The business brings in more than enough. The Persian slipper will remain a shared one. Consider how I had to face the prospect of your leaving.”
drone that is presently settled on my windowsill. By the time of that journey I had been doing it in a variety of other private places for years.
Quickly, I began to dress to receive visitors, only to see Holmes streak past in his dressing gown and slippers and crouch at the lower corner of the window frame to lift the edge of the blind.
The good doctor agreed he had sometimes seen it – tragedy enough for a man; calamity for a woman. The poor had no choice but to wrap up in a headscarf and brave it out. Miss Pearsall, judging from her account, had been able to take another path. She recurred here and there in the ledger, making changes, consulting on suitable hats and…there. A hairpiece for her wedding day, strong enough to hold a veil of five yards of Honiton lace.
It did not take a man very much quicker on the uptake than the Watson of the stories to understand him. And it did not take me, the lover of Sherlock Holmes in all his infinite variety, any time at all. He might be lame in one foot, but nature gave him two, and me two hands… and a mouth.
and I care not one whit if it was closed or open this time. This is not the first time you have left that cigarette case lying about with heaven knows what dangerous evidence inside it. What with all your papers piled up and the magnifier in line with the window, you were lucky I was passing and smelled smoke before the whole lot went up. As for this,” she tapped the side of the pot and it rang obediently, “there was a crack half an inch wide in the old one where
"Make haste then, for we must either walk the length of Upper Street and all the chief streets between there and Highgate Hill enquiring in every solicitor's office for our man, or brave the guard dogs of the Law Society. Which to choose? Pilgrimage or siege?"
“His habit is to show off his body to me, to tease, to provoke until I cannot hold off touching him.”
All the morning Holmes stayed where he had gone to some destination on foot, without me. He set me the task of being his eyes and ears, of playing the part of casual visitor, of striking up those easy conversations with strangers, which I take pleasure in and he treats as mere business. At the inn, the grocer, the tobacconist and Mrs Morris’ Pantry (“Tea and a tart, tuppence ha’penny”), I picked up what gleanings I could and took them back to my notebook to thresh them into a neat pile fit to give Holmes when he returned.
"I found situations in the country for the rest. Just as I have found one for myself. Come, I have the sale particulars of a villa with smallholding that will exactly suit, would you examine them with me?"
I was fairly bursting with curiosity to know why not, but as soon as I began to speak he shushed me with a glance. He asked to see a plan of the estate, and the rest of an hour was spent poring over it, myself being given the job of noting down roads and footpaths, neighbouring properties and their occupants, field and furrow – in short, the whole lie of the land. Somewhere in the middle of our labours, the gardener had left hers. She had gone back into the house, no doubt, but still kept well out of eye- and earshot.
with Holmes is never precisely what it seems. He is as careful with words as he is with his dress: which is to say, plain and sufficient, without ornament or useless show. Why should he want me at his tailor’s? He had never sought my advice on matters sartorial before, and I should have been of little help had he done so; about as much as he might have been to me in a case of double pneumonia.
When I returned to the sitting room from the front door, Holmes was in his chair, considering the painting, his lips twitching. He caught my eye and his half-smile became a grin, then a chuckle. An instant later we fell about, helpless with laughter and weak with the weight of irony, dusted with just a touch of – manly – hysteria.
He had disguised himself so often as an old woman – bent back, grey wig, hobbled gait, scratchy whine, shapeless black weeds -  that he had laughed my misgivings away, talking of going in disguise to the Opera with a view to spying on Lady Birch and her circle. Every alternative was rejected: he would go as a woman of fashion and let that be an end to it, dear boy.
." I announced. "To Somerset House, Watson. Afterwards a light lunch at Simpson's, then to our quarry!"
We sat all that evening in rather grim triumph – the penalties prescribed by the law are not our business, but two more lives would still be lost – distracting ourselves with a novel (myself) and a monograph on the identification of insects found on corpses (I offer no odds). Depressed spirits do not lend themselves to lusty bodies: when we retired, it was each to his own bed in the dusty silence of a London lodging.
The chatter of a dozen typewriters punctuated by the occasional telephone bell told us that Warner, Holt and Pater was a firm striding with confidence into the new century. Brace had the second-best office but not yet a partnership. He did not speak of the partners with much respect, which may have been either cause or consequence of that. Yet, to start with, he tried to charm us, perhaps thinking we had brought him a lucrative case.
It may be guessed what are some of the other words that stimulate the mind – and other parts – of the world’s only consulting detective. In that, he is not alone.
“Introducing a fly into the ointment. A fly which I hope will put off further interference with Miss Heacham and her household. Play along with me, Watson. I have stowed my proper luggage with my friend the foreman over there – his friendship can be bought for half a crown – and kept only this.”
“I am a scientist. I do not recognise anything in nature which does no harm as ‘improper’ so no, I did not. Propriety has a good deal to answer for. Cruelty, infidelity, greed, disgrace – all children of ‘propriety’.” He looked directly at me, a challenge in his eye, but compassion too. “Above all, Watson, my very dear friend: hypocrisy.”
Guilty, m’lud. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Take me down. No hardened criminal was as hard as I was for Holmes as I suckled on the tip of his indecent, rosy cockstand and teased at the soft, taut skin behind his balls until he groaned my name.  I’d order a gross of this glory every day of the week, decency be hanged.
“Going to bed early: perfectly unnatural. Then, if you’re willing, I propose some vigorous sodomy before day break.”
“I fear to tell you; I really do, Mr Holmes. Perhaps I may first lay out my credentials. I myself am a beekeeper of twenty years’ standing and winner at the Fulworth Village Show of the Sir Eustace Shipley Cup for Produce (any other category) for the last sixteen of those twenty years. Blind tasting, of course.”
“Post Office, High Street. Leave this for ‘Mr Heacham’”. With it was a sealed envelope addressed to a Post Office Box number.
“Much given to…Holmes, do we have to do this, cannot we get straight down to – it’s been damnably long since…”
“I would like to hear her impression of the trials you told me about,” said Holmes. As if she had never entertained the idea, as if it was not the most natural thing to expect, Miss Heacham turned on him with firm purpose.
Who was not in the least as I had expected. She was merry, she was outspoken, and she was fiercely intelligent - well, I ought to have expected that. She was also, if one may be permitted a private judgement, rather plain – but a plainness combined with such energy and light that it hardly signified and besides, I was hard put not to keep looking at something else altogether.
I had always loved him for that courage, for that daily striving for right. Above all, for his daily choice to trust me.
The difference? That she took my hand in the garden in Norwood; that she loved me - desired me- in return.
"Mr Brace, may I ask if you play cricket?" Watson's tone was calm but his face was full of something like horror. In a moment I was there with him, reaching toward truth and unable to stop myself from continuing as he had surely meant to:
The grey-headed figure unbent enough to show, through the haze of fine netting which hung over my face, a black coat fading to green, a lined face – kindly but shrewd – and a clerical collar.
Kitty probably could not help that her gaze flitted over my own ravaged hairline as she said: "Sometimes men come here, too. We don't do for them – there's other places that specialise. Still, I can't think of any that seemed even a mite put out with us, if that's the direction you're headed."
It was a grey morning in the Spring of '03. Let us say the 10th of April, about a quarter to eleven. Fifth cigarette of the day. Or it might have been an unseasonably dry October afternoon – the 15th, I fancy. Positively a Tuesday at any rate.  Make free with all these facts, gentlemen of the correspondence club. The newspapers that were spread all over the table were full of moral outrage: there had been a spate of vitriol throwing, in which the victims were all women of 'quality' – which is to say, money. So far there had been no serious physical injury but all had suffered spoiled clothing and the wreckage, in particular, of their hair. It was an affair into which I was bound to be drawn sooner or later: as he kept glancing at his watch, I suspected that Watson had a guinea or two at his club riding on the exact timing.
He had made a mess of the corset strings, trying to get them undone himself when half-undressed in the dark in a cab under an opera cloak. My neat bow had become a tangle,impossible to undo, and over his protests I fetched a scalpel to cut him free. The fee for the mystery he had no doubt solved – there was a gleam of unmistakable triumph in his eye -  would more than replace a set of stays, however fancy they were, and these were very fancy indeed. There was something about them – about him bound inside them - that made my hands tremble as I steadied him, peeled away the loosened dress and plucked with the blade at one, then two straining bands. Each snapped with a low, rough musical note like gunshot very far off and a gasp from my friend so like the sound he made the very first time I kissed the inside of his knee that I suddenly found it hard to breathe myself.
cronies – trying to do as he was done by. " She weighed the notion and found it wanting in a span of ten seconds. "Didn't know as he had any, though. Not one true friend crossed that threshold all the time I was there – only those he kept fed and those he wanted to feed on."
It was not exactly irrelevant, considering his news, but if I was being directed in the solution of the mystery I could not see how.
"Holmes, what in God's name is this? First you tell me that twenty-two years' partnership is about to come to an end; then you ask me to trust you with a confidence that is, to put it plainly, none of your business, then you suggest to me that I might do better not to."
I felt myself on shifting sand, reputation about to be swept away by the sea. What if he should discover the variety which existed under his very roof? Attack, so it is said, is the best form of defence.
Over supper at the inn, Holmes purposely avoided any talk of Low Hall for fear of flapping local ears, so it was not until we had settled in to the comfortable double-bedded room that I was able to press him on the subject. He talked lightly of dairy yields and brickfields and sidestepped most of my attempts to get him to commit himself to declaring what lay at the heart of the trouble and what, if anything, was to be done about it.
“Cyril Peto, Rector of this parish. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr Sherlock Holmes.” He held up a finger instead of extending a handshake. “Although, if I might correct you on one small point, from the stand of ash on our left down to the cliff edge is glebe land and therefore, strictly speaking,
"Why, we are, dear boy. We are going on - to Bermondsey." He pulled out his pocket watch; a sovereign glinted in the sunshine, and started off again. "Still just time to catch the 12.22 to London Bridge."
As we left for the honeymoon, he chattered distracted good wishes through our carriage window and scurried away to catch a cab. I did not doubt that he had his own departure to catch, traveling express to exaltation with the aid of the cocaine bottle.
He patted my hand, which ought to have enraged me further but instead had its usual effect of reminding me that he was, after all, himself, and patience was the only response that would shield me from an apoplexy.
I have written of Holmes’ reticence about his origins elsewhere: how I was amazed to discover he had a brother of whom I had never heard, despite years of us sharing rooms. This conversation took place a mere three years after our meeting at Barts and really, he knew scarcely more about me than I did him. No more than he was able to deduce for himself and he kept his little dramas of observation in store largely to impress clients on first meeting. He was still, for reasons that will become clear, not my confidant nor did he expect me to be his.
Partway through the undressing I realised I was still holding the scalpel, that I had done it all one-handed. So many times at night, over the years before, I had contemplated undressing him, one hand  busy on my own prick: second nature to hold  a weapon now.
We were heading north still, on the Outer Circle past the lake glistening in the late summer haze, towards the Zoological Gardens, when Holmes suddenly darted into the bushes. The greenery was only roughly trimmed in that spot and hidden in the midst of the thicket was evidently a gardeners’ store, hiding away the evidence of essential manual labour from the affronted notice of the leisured classes. When he emerged a scant moment later, humming in a satisfied sort of way, I asked him what hut on earth was worth such close inspection but so brief a visit, and once again where were we headed and was it on a case? At breakfast he had received exactly one piece of post, hand delivered, type-written on thick business notepaper with a printed header I had not been able to read through from the reverse – despite honing the skill of so doing over twenty and some years.
He was positively enjoying my confusion but only murmured a warning to keep my voice down. As the carter lifted up our bags I noticed for the first time – so entranced had I been by the signs of spring during our journey to Arlesey – how much luggage he had compared to mine and to his usual habit, which was to take a change of linen or two and trust to luck as to the rest. When we reached the railway station he told me to sit out of sight of the road.
Now, I held steady, steady: setting scalpel still against flesh. A bizarre wish to use it, to make just a scratch, to leave a tiny scar to mark him mine, shrieked at me from a dark corner. I banished it from sheer habit. First, do no harm.
Miss Heacham took off her spectacles and stared open-mouthed for a moment before remembering her dignity and coolly inviting him to explain.
“You can stay at the Placket Arms, between the house and the village.” She took us both in with a glance, for there was no doubt in any of our minds that ‘I’ would ever and ever mean ‘we’.
Even he could not have failed to notice. Symmetry of face, colour and clarity of eye, trimness of figure: these were matters of mathematics, and together the sum added up to beauty. ‘A face a man might die for.’ He had said those words, once upon a time – an observation, not a declaration, but even so. I had thought of them the moment our client had come into the room.
She wore trousers. Elegant, well-cut, feminine ones, in glowing cinnamon silk – but they could not be mistaken for skirts. I had never seen such a garment on a lady in England. However Holmes did not comment, and so neither did I. He sat, still in disguise – he often took pleasure in being someone else- lapsing from time to time into character, making the company laugh, and assured me that no-one else had been able to tell his real identity, not even the ladies until he chose to reveal himself
