It had been two whole days since John had got a proper look at him and to know that he was alright made something inside John's core soften in relief. Sherlock could still be mad at John, if that's what the issue was, but at least he was /here/ to do it.
Sherlock's spine tightens until he's rigid. His kaleidoscopic eyes shifting colours like a prism.
His jaw had been broken, said the report. His eye socket fractured. His C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae had all been broken and had to be fused together. He had suffered a collapsed lung and a broken ankle. Multiple lacerations to his hands. Defensive wounds to his palms. Abrasions. Cuts. Contusions
Splayed fingers swept gently across the swells of his pectorals. Hands claiming sensation that was not his to claim. Stuttering over Sherlock's nipples through the thin fabric of his shirt and making Sherlock flinch, drawing a tiny breath in surprise. Charles had always been delighted by his body's sensitivity.
She worked quickly to put the man in situ, giving him a bit of posthumous dignity by covering his groin with a strip of sheeting, then stepped back to allow Sherlock in to investigate, getting an appreciative smile from John for her patience. Her bright beam back spoke of her unabashed understanding.
He could grab something on the way home. Maybe Sherlock would be in the mood for Thai and be more moved to talk when plied with exotic food.
"What?" He looked down, seeing his tea colored chest dusted with blond hair, the same wrinkles of pinched skin across his curving belly he'd been looking down at for years. The coarse trail of golden hair beneath his naval, widening and disappearing into his trousers. The smooth chords of muscles making up his arms and the lobster pink starburst of his bullet wound that'd been his farewell present from Afghanistan. That, he had to really fold his neck to see.
He didn't have to think very hard. "Then three, I suppose. There was--"
but a special thank you to everyone still sticking around to read. :} you guys are making me plough on and I appreciate it.
"S'nothing." Sherlock blinked slowly, nodding, then shuffled over to couch and dumped himself upon it. He listed over to the side, his head landing on the armrest with a clutched cry in his throat.
Sherlock shook his head. Trying not to fall into his despair. It was mortifying that this scene had become so normal now.
Sherlock had already thought of all this seven hours ago and couldn't help his irritation at John considering old ideas. "Mr. Asano performs twice daily checks to each individual aquarium, he certainly would have noticed if it had been on the floor. And I doubt our client would be moronic enough as to put it in an aquarium without a lid, John."
The assistant busied herself with hooking up the scavenging system to the nose piece and fiddling with some knobs on the walls and checking the gauges, then John's heart rate ticked up substantially when the small plastic cup settled down over his face. A wave of dizziness washed over him and the ceiling fuzzed out. She adjusted it a bit, asking him how it felt, but he felt too far away to answer.
The tea cup paused midway to John's mouth, like the world had suddenly froze in place. Three seconds later and it would have undoubtedly been a spit take. He fought his pursed lips to form around the only word he could think to say and it came out incredibly meek. "Sorry?"
Then the tempo kicked up into a breaking crest amidst an ocean of noise and he rested again with a sharp, slicing downstroke, one that looked so hard it could have gouged the instrument in two if he had let it.
Except for the man to have nothing at all to say and instead come shuffling towards him, reaching out with his other whole hand to take hold of John's quilted black pourpoint (the padded doublet that was meant to be worn beneath armor, but worn now to keep the chill from his stricken body) in a tight grip and fall to his knees before him with bright blue eyes shining and a broken sob falling from his cracked dry lips.
"I believe I've been sufficiently cleaned now John."
"What? No."
"But let me be perfectly clear when I say that this will not happen again. I am giving you one more chance, Captain, because I am benevolent and my future Lord would wish me to be so. But should you fail a second time there will be no third chances.
John's leg strength was impressive, even if somewhat diminished after orgasm. Putting up a struggle until he realized resistance was futile. Flushing with embarrassment, John subsided.
"Hello. Welcome. I'm Doctor John Watson. Pleasure to meet you. Detective Sherlock Holmes is upstairs." The words still felt a bit odd to say all together. But he was getting more use to it.
"Home? Yes."
But John had turned and run. Out of the orchard and away from his ex-lover and into a despair so deep it took almost dying to see him out again.
He shouted the man's name, pushing up onto his toes, but his voice was lost into the claustrophobic verve of sound. Choicelessly, he cleaved his way in, sliding through bodies and pardoning his way through enthusiastic couples, all the while keeping his eyes peeled for that unmistakable head of black curls bobbing somewhere on top of the crowd.
Sherlock tips his head accomodatingly. "It's rare, I'll grant you. Not seen much outside an indigenous tribe in Papa New Guinea. Though, then again, not many people culturally are in the habit of /eating/ other people's brains so I can see how it has failed to go mainstream.
His John.
"D'you want me to take care of this for you?" John asked seductively, keeping his hand poised where it was as he asked, not wanting to assume, but still pulling at Sherlock's bottom lip with gentle suckling kisses. He wanted very much to make Sherlock feel as good and sated as he felt right now. Lying here warm and content, snogging his new found love. He wanted Sherlock to completely understand his willingness to reciprocate.
"Goodness Billy, were they all like this?" She asks when John fails to reciprocate in the conversation.
An errant sweep of wind caught the small bird's tail and ruffled its covert feathers into tiny spikes. Nearly knocking it from its perch before it hopped down onto the cold stone floor inside to be unmolested.
Sherlock's eyes flashed anew, both index fingers going up in articulation. "Now, conversely, if you take the dried fungus, crush it into powder, and then mix that with rain water until it's completely diluted, the devil's foot root turns the resulting solution into a sleeping potion instead. The effects of which are odorless and tasteless and take approximately eight hours to digest and twelve hours to run their full course, depending on the amount. Which is what I used on the food."
"It was foolish of you to come here John." Sherlock chastised as John entered the lab. He clicked over another slide from the projector he was using, favouring John with a cold glance that felt like a lash across the face. "You should've remained at Baker Street."
"Leaving? Where the hell would I go!" John balked, suddenly reeling, "Sherlock? Are you jealous?"
When John checked his watch, he was surprised to see that it was almost two in the morning. That in itself made him yawn. "Are we calling it a night?"
Nausea bloomed sickly in his empty belly.
"There's what?" John asked, screwing down his panic and pressing his fingers back into Sherlock's throat.
"But John! The evidence--"
He gave Sherlock one single nod and worked hard to fall limp in his hands. He'd only ever trusted one other person so completely before and now he knew for certain that he never would again. For it would be the death of him.
"We've already spoken to the driver," Sergeant Sally Donovan interjected, having joined them. She directed her statement towards Lestrade, holding her body in a mess of sharp, hateful angles. Her back pointed especially to Sherlock, blocking him out. "She says that he threw himself in front of her."
"It doesn't even rate above five!"
"It's not your fault."
The skeleton of a plan begins forming in John's mind as he makes his way to the bathroom. Mind cleared with purpose, he takes what may very be his last dose of Comvita and quickly searches the kitchen and sitting room for his wallet and keys.
He smiled to himself, extraordinarily pleased when the small fruit gave a little pop between his unrelenting teeth and burst apart in a wash of tart juice. He imagined it to be a fraction as sweet as the taste of Sherlock's eventual breaking beneath his hand.
"I think I'd like to start with his heart when you're finished." The Queen Mother's voice floats to him from not so far away. "I should think it's the strongest muscle you possess, Dr. Watson. From everything I've seen these past few weeks. I bet it will be the most delicious part of you."
The awkwardness dissipated and a camaraderie of silence fell between them for a time. Then Lestrade shifted in place. "Listen. I'm no expert on relationships, but if you ever wanted to, y'know, maybe grab a pint or--"
John's snort was met with a small grin, and that small grin was met with another larger grin, and soon both men were smiling and hiccuping through hearty, open chuckles as thick and beautiful as the night they time they had shared at the bottom of the stairs, after having just chased a murderous taxi through the streets of London and had come to know one another so effortlessly.
After some small adjustments and a trousered leg pressed up against his naked arse to shift his center of gravity forward, Sherlock had manipulated John into leaning up with locked elbows onto the vanity's top. His hands were braced wide on the bottom corners of the sink, which effectively put all of his weight up onto the balls of feet. It was a very purposeful stance that forced his arse to stick out like a tart and his face to be pressed mere centimetres from the mirror. Blinding him to everything but that solitary stripe of cleared glass and what lay reflected in it.
Still, Sherlock tensed. As he did every time.
A hope that things would be better now. That life would not be so goddamned awful. At least so far as Harriet and Clara had been concerned. If they had only been aware of the burden John still shouldered. . .
A new prompt flashed up on the screen, identifying the man as the one and only Detective Inspector Tobias Gregson as he bent down to speak into the microphones. "If everyone could just quiet down." His soft voice was a bit unnerving, seeming to undermine the roughness of his face and take his whole persona to a rather menacing level.
John reaches again. Coming close. Snags an open placket of the vest as they crest the top. Takes hold! The Union Jack neck man twists in his grip. Trying to fight him off. His face a twist of hate and terror and pain as he spins. He goes for John's face as they stumble. Tripping backwards. Desperately swinging. Wrestling. Grappling. Eye bouncing on its string.
"You would have been air lifted initially to Camp Bastion where you would have had to be stabilized before risking travel again and then transferred to Selly Oak Hospital in Burmingham for further recovery, as is the typical procedure for wounded soldiers. From there you would have been sent to Headly Court for rehabilitation, but something happened to you before you got there, something delayed your transfer, you didn't make it to Headly for a long while. But what was it?
Now Sherlock was lashing out because he felt he was being patronized. But John wasn't placating him.
"Oh really? That's nice." John shuffled into a simulacrum of parade rest, goading him along. "But that's not REALLY what you wanted to talk about right now, was it? Not that it's not appreciated."
"Get some goddamn rest Sherlock! We'll deal with it in the morning." John called back down, not stopping.
"Again. I'd like to thank you for these."
Good to know. "Ah. Okay. That's fine."
John snorted in astonishment, his spell of concern abating to caution, "what experiment?" His face flushed bright red as Sherlock's lips plodded further and further down toward the damp marsh of his groin, detouring south long before he reached his groin. Judging by the severity of his flushing skin, Sherlock guessed that no one before had ever shown oral interest in John's backside. Shame, that.
To think they'd nearly lost each other.
"I gathered."
Slightly confused, though eager to do as Sherlock wished, John continued on.
John considered himself proportionally hung, if a little proud at his own thickness which had never failed to impress. But even if Sherlock's were small as hell, John would be fine with it. In his line of work he'd seen all kinds and he knew that size was just one factor in a host of many. Skill and desire could make up for and even surpass anything. If one put their mind to it.
They stood back as they watched Sherlock work, watching him swoop and duck, lean in and tilt back. He looked at everything from different angles, different distances. He disregarded certain areas outright, while others were practically focused on to the point of melting under his scrutinizing gaze. What difference there made between the areas, no one but Sherlock could tell.
John noticed that the boy was looking at him almost seductively, as if he saw something in John that John was finding hard pressed to figure out for himself. He'd seen enough young men back in his Army days with daddy issues and sexual identity crises that he decided right then and there that whatever the boy's intent, it was completely misplaced. A gentle dismissal, should he approach, was already percolating in his mind.
"No!" John spluttered, swallowing and coughing, wiping the drink from his chin with the back of his hand. "No. I suppose I wasn't expecting...well...I don't know what I didn't expect. Certainly not that. You've never wanted to talk about...any of...but that's good. Right? That's helpful. If I can ask questions...that would be...good."
"Are you lost?" John wasn't about to turn away such a man, but his hackles still did rise at the fact that an outsider was coming to visit him. He had hoped his isolation would have lasted longer than this.
Sterling Sipe was tall and trim, with broad shoulders and utilizing his ostentatious hair by complimenting it with a green shirt that peaked up over his white coat. His hand was large and confident around John's. His face completely open. He had a long and crooked nose that only enhanced the drama of his rough but gentle face and split the focus between two piercing blue eyes.
Sherlock raises his chin a bit. "Yes. It is. But someone's threatening /you/ this time... I--"
An alchemical laboratory had been set up in the back right corner of the room. A small nebula of glass apparatus were held upright by a delicate framework of metal. Retorts, curcubits, pelicans, and alembics all with their empty glass bellies, delicate glass intestines, and plunging glass necks sat sparkling clean and ready for their next experiment, while a mortar and pestle sat close by, still coated with a strange brown powder.
He was propped half upright against his headboard, his comforter clutched tightly around him, but doing nothing to stop the internal chill that froze his veins. He shivered and shook, deciding that he wouldn't be at all surprised if his bones began to rattle in the mayhem.
"Later than I would have liked," Sherlock admits. "But it all started to make sense eventually. I just wonder when precisely it was that you began vying for my attention and not just improperly disposing your leftovers. Trying to entice me back with corpses instead of invitations was a . . . nice touch."
"Need anything before I go?" John asked when he came back out.
"Based on the circumference of the initial entry point, I would say that it was caused by a .54 caliber bullet. If you take that and correlate it with where you were and what you were doing at the time, it's easy to deduce that it was fired from a Mosin-Nagant at long range, possibly even a Dragoon if you wanted to be particular. A relic, no doubt, left over from when the Russians invaded Afghanistan as they stopped manufacturing those particular rifles in the 1960s.
A formidable sight and seer indeed.
John didn't need this right now. He needed sleep. He need a goddamn break to sit and think and figure it all out.
"Well, you know more than I do by now that Sherlock's an arsehole and arrogant and disrespectful and a sodding dictator if you let him be, and those are just the /good/ days. But I suppose I'm just use to it by now." Lestrade conceded and then looked very pleased. "There is one thing, a trick when it comes to dealing with His Nibs that I learned it from watching my sister try to control her two year old."
She hesitates at the front door, pressing her fingers against her lips as if to physically hold back any further comments as she takes the time to look at each of her two tenants safe and together again in 221B before she's reassured enough to silently shut the door with tears in her eyes.
He was caught!
(See the end of the chapter for
As though he had eyes in the back of his head, Sherlock stopped short of the far wall and skillfully reached out to turn a inconspicuous knob that John had never seen before. What lay on the other side of the door finally had John pulling his lips away in surprise.
The whole display was highly theatrical and would have made John laugh, if he wasn't afraid to have the black mood turned upon himself.
The fabric that made up his tunic beneath all this was so dark that only when he breathed could the purple of its thread be seen and only here in the brightest sunlight did it make itself known.
"What's a Sebastop-- oh no! The goose? I'm not going in there, that thing's evil! If you remember, it tried to attack me."
"But Sherlock, you have to know just one thing...there's just one more thing..."
"And imagine our surprise seeing just what lengths you're willing to go to for a man you've hardly just met. My my. Mr. Moriarty said that you were in deep...but I never truly understood it until now. Bravo! It's been like watching a dinner theatre about doomed lovers written solely for me."
"Because ...it's not any of my business." John very badly wanted to stop talking about this.
"I came here to tell you that I've no right to be angry at you."
No longer able to help with anything now that John is settled, Sherlock is left standing awkwardly beside him, staring at his feet like he's waiting for a hammer to drop. John opens his mouth to speak, but just then Mrs. Hudson swoops in with her unerring timing and sets two cuppas down on his table before quietly excusing herself.
And his mind begins to spiral anew. Dark thoughts of helplessness and hopelessness bubbling up like choking oil. He's broken again. He's damaged...
John was unsure of whether or not he was suppose to dismount in meeting such a man of high distinction, but then John decided that since William gave no indication to do so, it would be alright if he did not as well. Instead, he simply bowed his head as deeply as his armour and his back would allow him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Admittedly, if the Met hadn't been standing about and if he weren't absolutely certain he'd get the most barbarous strop as a result of doing it; John would have kissed the selflessly selfish mad bastard on the lips right there and then.
"No. That." Sherlock reiterated. "On your hand."
'Where are you? We need to talk.' it reads.
"Hang on. Did you just switch pronouns? How do you know the killer's a /he/?" John asked.
And to the South was the land that stretched beyond Baker Town's borders; the quilted patchwork of fields where the gentry toiled. Gold and sage and lilac in the dawn. A blanket for the world that disappeared away into the horizon. Sleeping still. Weaving the dreams of other lands. And other stories.
Mary kept silent, taking another sip of wine.
Benedict bit his lip. "But –"
. He didn't press too close at first, afraid to spook Sherlock, but Sherlock's kissing was so thorough, so expert, that John decided to take the plunge. He moved forward and let his steadily hardening cock brush against Sherlock's trouser front. Triumph seized him.
"Oh God. Ben…."
"Oh. Yeah, no problem." John took Sherlock's hand, squeezed briefly, and dropped it. "See you." He hurried downstairs and out into the fresh air.
Mary nodded, her expression grim. "I know."
Sherlock waited, but heard only the rain pattering against the glass of the windows, and John's breathing.
"John."
"Oh, that's okay. I tried to phone you earlier, but I couldn't get through. Around five-ish?"
"This isn't an autopsy, just an investigation. Also, apparently the subject was a close acquaintance."
"Ideally, a definitive connection between Dedalus and Lady Howe. I'm going to get Mycroft to get his people to scramble the security alarm. Time he got off his fat arse and actually did some work on this case himself." John let out an amused snort, and Sherlock glanced over at him, pleased that he'd made John laugh. His glance evolved into a thorough examination from beneath his eyelashes. John, in his smart coat and bad haircut and his ten extra pounds, emanated a quiet power merely sitting beside him, and it took Sherlock a moment to see it through a sudden odd cloud of pervasive warmth and contentment that he eventually recognised as safety. And as much as he'd derided nostalgia in the past, now he accepted it, not wallowing, but dipping a toe in and finding it not unpleasant. It wouldn't do to immerse himself, though; whether or not those blond hairs proved to be Mary's, he'd have to hurt John again, one way or another. Too much lay between them. There was nothing for it – he'd have to re-establish his old carapace, the armour of his solitude.
"I fervently hope so. My team and I will be here tomorrow at seven o'clock with the necessary equipment to, we believe, facilitate your departure and ensure a smooth transference."
call me Tom, Stan."
"Are you here solving a mystery?" the sprog asked solemnly.
Benedict blinked. "What?"
John let his breath hiss through his nose. "All right," he said evenly. "Were you still working with her?"
"Do that." Sherlock's chest felt leaden. "Give them my best. Well – I'd better be off."
"I get it," Benedict snapped. "I get it, okay? It's funny. Fucking hilarious. Great performance. You're a brilliant actor, you won a fucking BAFTA –" Oh, God, he'd promised himself never to let that tiny scrap of bitterness out. Martin would never let him live it down. Too late now. He sucked in a quick breath. "What I mean is – it's all very funny, but you can stop now."
Sherlock unfolded his hands and placed them on the arms of the chair. "Among other things." He tapped his fingers against the worn leather.
As he was rinsing off, a bright flash obscured his vision. He wavered, put a hand out to steady himself, and fell forward into whiteness. His kneecaps banged hard onto the floor, and he saw a hundred water droplets spattering on the floor beneath him.
"No, it's not. Or rather, it wasn't. Some of them are newly rich, though, and keen to invest in art. I'm an expert, and a consultant, for a price." He offered Sherlock another narrow smile. "Like you."
Heat flooded Sherlock's face.
"I thought you were a virgin."
"I think your profession has failed you. You're certainly adept at aping my brother's mannerisms, Mr Cumberbatch, but it was audacious – no, beyond foolish, in fact – to think that you could in the least way deceive me into believing that you were Sherlock. You say you portray my brother on a television programme. I presume it's the crime-solving. People do seem interested in that sort of thing." Mycroft's expression conveyed a wealth of distaste. "Sherlock's predilection for detective work is merely one aspect of a complicated personality, however. It's utter folly to think that you could capture the nuances of our relationship. We have over thirty years of history together." Mycroft drew on his cigarette and tapped the ash against the table. "I give you credit for nerve, but not much for intelligence, I'm afraid. And improvisation is clearly not your strong suit."
hotel room. What the hell was going on? The last thing he remembered was a jolt of pain and Sherlock, falling –
A delicate little double helix of conjecture and suspicion began to crystallise in the back of Sherlock's mind, twining its way around the dusty and cobweb-ridden but still tender past.
SIger sat on one of the hard, uncomfortable chairs provided for visitors. A slight, shuddering exhale escaped him.
"Tripped, you said."
"You look good enough to eat," Tom said by way of greeting. He closed the door behind him and wrapped Sherlock in a tight and surprisingly muscular hug, burying his nose in Sherlock's neck. "Mm – just showered. Smells fantastic."
"Is this your first time seeing the stones?"
"Noooo," Sherlock said. "You and your unreasonable expectations, John. Honestly."
Moriarty ignored John. "Whew!" he said, settling back into the chair. "Now you're up to speed. Good."
"Never said it wasn't," Sherlock said. "I assume she's a supernumerary, so we can skip her and move directly to her employer."
Sherlock nodded. Mrs Hudson's flat, unrented and untouched since her death, had been turned into Nora and John’s new digs. Once her things had been cleared out – and she was a dear, that was unmistakable, but neither John nor Sherlock had wanted most of her possessions, so off to Oxfam they went – the graceful proportions of the flat had been revealed. John had the carpets pulled up, revealing handsome oak underneath that had only to be sanded and refinished to a wonderful dark-honey gloss. New pipes and wiring went in, the kitchen was overhauled, and crumbling walls had their paper carefully removed and were replastered where necessary. John chose new paper and paint in cheerful, bold colours, and Sherlock dragged him to Harrods, Heal's, Bonham’s, Selfridges, Roche Bobois, and a half dozen other shops to furnish the flat. John was giving half of his fortune to Doctors Without Borders, and there was still plenty left for Nora's future and a very luxurious redecoration, never mind supporting him in style for the rest of his life. "It does," he agreed. "But I think Mrs H would have liked it."
"You do believe me, though, don't you?" Benedict pleaded in a raspy voice. They'd walked for hours in softly lit Hampstead darkness as he'd told his story, and come back to Benedict's house to drink beer and snack on cheese.
"Oh…." John went to the bed and sat beside Mary, taking her hand. "Was she ill?"
"Ah. That
Sherlock snorted in derision. "No."
"That's all," Sherlock said. He sat down again. His head was starting to spin.
Mycroft pushed neatly through the small throng and stood over Sherlock, a small, infuriatingly smug smile on his face. "Welcome back."
"Still with the plastic surgeon, is she?"
"Lord Moran has excellent taste," Guthrie conceded with a nod.
Mary held his gaze. "We stayed in touch."
"'I'm going to saw your balls off with rusty clippers and stuff them down your throat,'" Benedict read, enunciating precisely.
Sherlock reached down and grasped John's hand. "Can you put her off for two weeks?"
"All right." Benedict sat, certain his face was bright pink. Abashed and humbled, he dug into his eggs and inserted a forkful into his mouth. John had waited until he was up to begin breakfast, and that small consideration, especially in light of what had preceded it last night, made Benedict want to take John by the shoulders and thank him for his thoughtfulness. Perhaps it was an apology. He had to say something. "John –"
Jim couldn't pretend (to himself; fooling everyone else was ridiculously easy) that it didn't sting the tiniest bit that Johnny Watson had sort of beaten him to the punch in that department.
. Sherlock ate hungrily and tried not to think of the innumerable dinners John had made for him, trying to stave off malnutrition. Silly – Sherlock ate when it was necessary. But he'd appreciated the gestures, even if he hadn't actually said so.
"Let me know what you turn up, Sherlock. Don't conceal anything, please."
"Mad, yes. You've said that." Mycroft took a snowy handkerchief from his inner breast pocket and handed it to Benedict. "Mop yourself up."
Wait, who was that dodgy-looking man with the scruff of beard? Surely that wasn't meant to –
" – magnate said, in a statement, that the Dedalus Wing4 would revolutionise communication as we know it."
Tom stripped off his t-shirt and let it fall to the floor. "Let's spend our time productively."
"One reads about couples going within days or weeks of each other, but I don't suppose it happens very often," Mycroft mused. "I wouldn't have thought Mummy the sort to pine away."
Lestrade met them at the door, his face handsome, Rupert's face, but weary and grim. Benedict didn't even feel a little frisson of surprise – was it good that he was becoming accustomed to this universe, or not good?
"You slept with him today, didn't you?"
"Yeah, her aunt. Trish, or Patricia I guess. She died just a little over a week ago. I guess she came to see Mary because she was sick and wanted to reconnect."
Idiot. John wasn't beside him. Funny how one got used to companionship.
Sandalwood and…no, not lilac. Iris. And galbanum, rose, vanilla, hyacinth.
"No, thank you. I was in the midst of a meeting with the German chancellor, you know."
Moriarty grinned. "Oh, they're around." He lifted his arm above his head and snapped his fingers. Benedict frowned, then caught a sharp flash out of the corner of his eye. He turned his head and saw five or six little red dots dancing over John's body.
"I see. Well…carry on, then. Report when you have something."
"Oh, I'd love that!" Tom said, digging into his prawns with enthusiasm. "I'm looking at a few projects right now, and there are some tempting offers. Let's sit down and talk about it soon." He smiled at Sherlock. "That's a great idea, don't you think?"
"No, I'll get a taxi. Thanks all the same. And thanks for dinner." Sherlock bent and kissed Mary's cheek. "Lovely to see you again."
"Good
John chuckled. "I don't know about that. I haven't been to confession in years."
He hoped, at any rate.
"Sherlock?"
Though that did bear occasional resemblance to John. But apparently Freeman had been with one lady for a number of years, enough to have a couple of children. Not married – sensible, and yet, with two sprogs, they might as well have done. Boat anchors.
"You could have taken another day, you know. I can't remember the last time you had a real holiday."
He stared at the phone, willing a response. After a minute, the phone lit up.
John shook his head. "I don't get it. Suicide?"
"They all seem to have commensurate experience. And they all seem pretty smart."
"Let's not, all right?"
The nurses or techs had taken care with the room. Mary was still wired up:  there was the ventilator, the EEG, the bedside monitor, but she looked all right, as if she were just sleeping. A soft cap covered the aftereffects of the surgery, and a pink blanket had been pulled up to her chin. Instead of fluorescent lights, there was an incandescent lamp in a corner, and a pretty bouquet of pink roses on the ledge beside the window.
"You said you didn't want to know details." Seb reached out and caressed Stephen's hair. "It's a long game, Steenie darlin', and it's going entirely to plan. That's all you need, isn't it?"
"I don't quite understand," Benedict said.
Mycroft lifted his eyebrows and looked down his nose. "About?"
"Thought you were falling apart." John bit back a smile.
A flash of memory penetrated the fog in his head, and he remembered. He remembered everything.
"Oh, boy," Moriarty sighed. "You've got it all worked out. Congratulations."
Nora's eyes got bigger. "When?"
, he’d admitted with a sigh.
"And yet you're still fascinated with me," Sherlock said drily. He wished his head would stop throbbing.
"No, I'm afraid not. Necessary ruse." Sherlock crossed his legs at the knee and folded his gloved hands in his lap.
"Friday will be better," Nora said confidently. "Miss Price and Mr Beale are taking us to the Natural History Museum. We're going to see the new dinosaur exhibit."
," Benedict whispered. "You killed her."
He hated that Sherlock looked absolutely great, not as if no time had passed, but great nonetheless, because time adored Sherlock and treated him gently. He hated that Sherlock had seen, with that fucking annoying keen-eyed perception, exactly what John had been up to. He hated the silence – the old Sherlock wouldn't have hesitated to point out John's habits with glee, as if John himself didn't know what he'd been doing for most of the afternoon. He hated the gentleness in Sherlock's voice, the tolerance. He hated that Sherlock had extended an enticement of a case like a man offering a very old dog a bone. And most of all, he hated his own longing, the burn in his chest, the anger that after five years, John Watson still fucking cared. How utterly sad and pathetic.
"There's a law against vagrancy. Also, it's going to hit below zero tonight."
He felt besieged at once; the place was choked with laughing, shouting, chattering humanity, tuxedoed, gowned, bejewelled, perfumed. Mycroft scarcely had room to hand his invitation to the eager young man who materialised at his side, gloved hand extended as if in supplication or perhaps benediction. He managed to ease his topcoat off by dint of holding his arms down at his sides like a tin soldier and shrugging, and the young man deftly accomplished the rest, slinging the coat over his arm. "Lady Howe?" Mycroft asked.
Martha turned on the telly. Oh, a new series of
"Thank God," Sherlock said, grasping John's shoulders. "Are you okay?"
"What?"
"Hello!" The front door banged shut.
"I expect them imminently."
"Mary."
"What the fuck is going on?"
he told himself sternly.
soap opera, I may cry."
"Let's just stop pretending you give a shit about me, eh, Tommy? Oh, hey – want to hear something funny? I know you've got a sweet tooth, so a few days ago I tried to get one of your little fans to give you some chocolates that I doctored. Reckoned I'd manoeuvre things once you'd eaten them. She balked, though, the little bitch. Had to take care of that." Henry got up and grabbed another length of rope.
"Good." John balled the scarf up and tossed it to the floor of the wardrobe. "I'll let you shower. Do you want something to eat before you go?"
Mycroft shifted gears smoothly. "What did I tell you the day you staged your death?"
He heard pounding feet ascending the stairs.
Sherlock grinned. "Murder by pressure drop. Really clever." He whirled; a spray of porpoise snot flew from the membrane as he marched back into the kitchen. "It was his brother, Vasily," he called. "Not an oligarch by any stretch of the imagination – he acted as Petr's press secretary, rode his coattails, got jealous. Predictable, boring. He found out he was the principal beneficiary in Petr's will, though, and while they were in Belize, the pair of them went SCUBA diving with a local friend, a physician. Whilst they were on the ocean floor, Vasily cut Petr's weights."
"Used to be. You can call me Nick now. Old Nick. Old Scratch."
John sighed and rubbed at his eyes. He rose and faced Moriarty. "What do you want?"
"Oh. Oh." Tom's hand had insinuated itself between fabric and bare skin and was rubbing, stroking, his thumb brushing against the supersensitive head of Sherlock's penis.
He was still marvelling at how well his hair had turned out, considering that he hadn't done a thing to it – towel-dry, quick fluff with the fingers, and it was picture-perfect – when John all but hauled him out the door before he'd had a chance for a quick piece of toast and cup of tea. His stomach grumbled in protest, but he stayed in character – Sherlock Holmes existed on a diet of adrenaline and peril – and climbed into the sleek black sedan, tightening his scarf and drawing his coat closer round his body. It felt reassuring, like armour.
Maybe it was trust, and that was all there was to it. Sherlock had never lied to John about who he was, he'd demonstrated from the very first moment exactly what sort of man he was, and if he concealed parts of himself, they weren't malicious, or ugly. Yeah, he was a prick sometimes, he was thoughtless…almost always, arrogant 24/7, but –
"And you've got a much better proposition, I take it."
"Yeah, I'm – I'm fine." John drew closer, then pulled back. "Oh, fuck," he whispered, and scrambled to his feet. "Do you have ice in the freezer, packet of frozen peas, something? I want to get that swelling down."
"This way, sir." The security guards led him to the door of a small cottage, opened it, and ushered him inside. The interior was cosily furnished, battered leather chairs and a spacious sofa with cabbage roses and old, nicked wood, and – best of all – Sherlock, leaping up from a chair and rushing to him.
"What am I looking for?"
"I'm not playing your game. Send Sherlock out and I won't drill half a dozen holes in your head." Sweat beaded at John's temples and between his shoulder blades.
"Nah," Moriarty said. "It's fun. It was fun in Serbia, too, watching you. Twenty whole seconds before you started screaming, Sherlock. That's impressive. Beats the time in clinical conditions, you know. I still have the video. Think you can beat your own time?"
The light dimmed, softened, no longer searing his eyelids. Carefully, so carefully, he opened his eyes, and gave a soft cry of wonder.
Jim shook his head, wild-eyed. "You're not…I don't know how, but you're not…you're not Sherlock. Sherlock would never say those things. Never." He took a step forward, then another, holding the gun shakily. "Who are you?"
"Give me a second, for Christ's sake – oh. Yeah, we did. Erm, two streets back, and turn left. Well, right if we're turning around."
keep looking for it, so you must have more of this type of suit, possibly a variety of sizes depending on your activity. You've got nervous fingers, stained with nicotine, same with teeth, slightly whitened but still showing faint traces. Gums are a bit red because you scrubbed them extra hard, someone probably chastised you about your smoking habit, God forbid an actor should have yellow teeth. And judging by the number of names you called out, you're accustomed to coddling, typical insular world of the performing arts. And although you've just touched an exposed wire with high currency, there are no burns on your hand – no marks whatsoever." The man paused. "Shall I continue?"
John awoke with a stiff neck, a dust-dry mouth, and a headache throbbing behind his eyes. He covered his eyes with his arm and turned, burrowing back into his pillow.
work, the
Benedict stifled a laugh, put his hand on hers – such a little hand, so delicate – and squeezed lightly. She squeezed back. She was so sweet, so gentle, and when he bent to kiss her it felt like the most natural thing in the world. Her mouth opened to his, and in seconds – it seemed like only seconds – she'd swung astride him, her thighs squeezing his hips, grinding against him.
"You and Dr Watson will be sharing accommodations. You'd do well to bring clothing and toiletries for him as well. I'll speak to you in an hour." Mycroft rang off.
Exhaling deeply, his head still ringing, John looked out the window. They had reached the outskirts of Derry.
Sherlock moved close to John again and unexpectedly took John's hand in his. The candlepower in his face still burned, but at a lower wattage. "It's true life is full of risks. You can go to Spain, John, and wrap yourself and Nora in cotton wool, but it doesn’t mean there won't be heartache, or uncertainty, or even harm or death."
Tom breathed hard, trying to regain some semblance of equilibrium, and all at once the softness was yanked away from his eyes. He squinted, saw only dark grey, then something that felt like an anvil crashed into his kidneys, and he gasped, thrashing for air.
"No, no. That amuses him every once in a while, but he claims it's too easy and gets boring. He's got a little family money that's just about enough to live on, but we do take payment for cases. He sort of charges by whim, though, and only if the client's got money to burn. He's not entirely heartless. Sometimes clients give him gifts, too, and most of the valuable ones get sold on eBay. He's got a really high seller rating."
"What," Sherlock managed through frozen lips, "some sort of incendiary device?"
"Hmm." Moriarty drew the gun back. "If I get it right, you'll tell me. You won't lie."
"You'll set yourself on fire," the man said in clear amusement, and crouched down, extending a lighter.
"She's wearing tights. And you can't see her bottom, so relax."
"This is one of them. Look, John, whatever happens –" Sherlock rose to his feet, looking tired. "John, stop pacing."
"Fool," Moran said with quiet vehemence. "How much time do you think I spent in prison, Holmes?"
"Not entirely," Sherlock said, and managed to sound disinterested. "You did make that little video some years back. Couldn't bear to be ignored."
"Pleasure's all mine."
"Well, I can't feel my foot."
"Sir, I am obliged to express concern. We must consider this an unprecedented action at this level of security, and channels –"
And amazingly, shockingly,
Mark poured a generous amount into Sherlock's glass. "Well, the latest and greatest news, if you're interested. We resume filming on Wednesday. The break makes things a bit tight, but obviously we've built some time in on the front end for emergencies, and we've got to make absolutely certain that everything's up to safety codes. It's a first for us," he said, addressing Tom. "We've never had to fill out accident-incident reports, and Sue was wild about it. Steven – well, he had his moment of rage and then calmed down. You know how that is. The
"You see, I didn't –" He closed his mouth abruptly.
"Mum!" Nora scraped her chair back and ran toward Mary, hugging her. "Merry Christmas! Can we open presents?"
Jim sat back from the monitor and watched Sherlock Holmes and John Watson trudge to the lift, stymied by a cardboard OUT sign and an eager-to-please product counsellor. "Would you look at the pair of them, Seb. Like a couple of kicked puppies."
"The maid's dead."
"I prefer Bart's. They just got some new spectrometers, too. Keen to try them out."
"You're not my type, Tommy, but this hasn't got a preference." He waved the trowel back and forth. "I imagine you'll be able to accommodate it. Your boyfriend here has probably got you nice and stretched." He made a small moue of disgust, as if violent assault with a garden implement was a perfectly quotidian experience, but ordinary anal sex was too gauche to be borne.
Thank you so much for reading. I hope you enjoyed the story.
"Shut up," Sherlock muttered, and pulled the khaki trousers down, revealing claret-coloured stretch-silk briefs.
stuffy, but it wasn’t awful. Practical, really.
Tom knew it wasn't very environmentally sound to ask for them to be printed out, but Tom still liked the feel of paper, and still collected print books despite the scads of stuff on his mobile and his shiny new iPad. Not that they were doing much good at the moment. He'd tried to read them, moving to another when he couldn't concentrate, but nothing stuck, and eventually he'd ended up staring into space, trying to fight a desolation so profound that he could scarcely breathe. He felt tears threatening again and rubbed his eyes. Better to just let himself cry, probably, but that would be like acceptance, and he couldn't accept it, not yet.
John's tone was warm and concerned, and it took tremendous effort not to smile and thank him for being so sweetly solicitous. "Of course I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be?"
"No, you're right on time." Sherlock beamed at him and held out a gloved hand.
"Well, it's certainly a pleasure," Guthrie said. "It's not often we get a chance to –"
Five minutes. He needed five minutes to pull himself together, and then he'd call Mycroft. It wasn't the arrest that was troubling, though that
faster, but still.
Benedict wanted to drag Tom upstairs and fuck him senseless, but he forebore, for the moment. "All right." He leant back on the sofa, then jumped up. "I can't sit still for this. Let's go for a walk. I'll tell you everything."
"It'll be great. I'm off to wash away the day and get Herself cleaned up as well. She couldn't stop dancing about and asking me all sorts of questions about him." Mary had wiggled a farewell with her fingers and gone up, leaving John alone with the telly and the scent of cooking lasagna.
"You said they beat you," John said flatly.
"Nobody's is," John chuckled.
"Sherlock." John tapped Sherlock on the shoulder. "Sherlock, wake up."
Bemused, John let her go. She was growing up too quickly. He wished he could slow time down and watch her closely, be with her every possible moment. Sighing, he cleaned the table and washed the soiled glasses and cutlery, then dropped onto the sofa with a fresh beer and turned on the television, flicking through channels, stopping at an oddly familiar fuzzy photograph.
"Why not?" Sherlock smiled for another photo. "What about one with Ciaran?"
Miranda folded her arms. “I would have appreciated a consultation.”
John glanced at him. "Now you're really terrifying me," he said, heartened when Sherlock smiled. "How's your headache?"
Benedict almost laughed. Stephen Hawking existed across universes. Wasn't that exquisite? "We've got Stephen Hawking as well. If anyone's got that sort of pull, it's Mycroft."
"Oh, is that what you thought?" Tom stabbed a finger at him. "You think because he's an actor he's got some sort of uncontrollable libido? Christ's sake, Mark didn't even look particularly happy when I walked in, and I don't mean just guilty. Did you even say may-I?"
, then put bow to strings, launching into the cello part, crisp and vivid. He segued into the violin's section, then returned to cello, all the while humming the guitar counterpoint. The Amati sang, its voice spiraling sweetly through the room, spilling its notes into the corridor, starry jewels scattered into the air.
"Fine." Sherlock lay perfectly still, letting his eyes drift shut. Eventually, he realised that Tom was stripping him, divesting him of his tight trousers, the jacket, his socks. He felt the duvet and sheet tugged from beneath him, and then a soft warmth. Nice. The light went out, and a body pressed against his.
"Thought you wanted Byam Street, mate?"
"Yeah, I know. Eventually. 'Night, love." She kissed his shoulder and rolled over, switching her light off.
Both messages were from undisclosed senders.
Moriarty shook his head. "In fact, we're introducing a new model in two weeks. Business has never been better."
"Is it high enough?"
"The thing is, I'm not really Sherlock Holmes. I'm an actor. My name's Benedict Cumberbatch, and I play Sherlock on a television programme. There was an accident, and Sherlock and I switched places three days ago, when he was electrocuted in the flat."
"Ben," Mark had said gently, laughing, "it's not set in stone. I'm just asking."
"I have two pieces of news for you."
"Well, why don't you take five minutes out of your regular schedule of assassinations and financial collapse and
"Yeah, but I didn't expect you to actually listen." John opened the fridge. "You even put the food away." He took out the cheese and grapes. "Snack?"
, not ignoring the issue. Christ. Arsehole! If they met again, Benedict was going to have some extremely strong words for his counterpart.
Flushing, Mycroft glanced at Sherlock. "It was more expedient to allow you to –"
"Oh, God, yeah," John said, looking at his watch. "Yeah. Erm, do you want to share a cab?"
"But –"
Benedict – was it Benedict? – shrugged. "Insufficient data."
"Don't," Irene whispered. "Don't open it."
The door opened again. "Come in, please." The butler stepped aside, and Sherlock walked in, coming face to face with Lord Stephen Moran.
John's smile dissolved. "He said a lot. What do you mean specifically?"
"Yeah. Yeah." John turned back to the table, rummaging through the PA's possessions. "The two of us against the world," he murmured.
"There she goes again, sticking up for you," Peter laughed. "Good old Fi. Christ, Fi, it's not as if he needs the boost."
"My employer has a problem," the equerry said.
"Hi. This is Benedict Cumberbatch. I'm really sorry to bother you –"
He skidded to a stop and bestowed a grin upon Hamilton Hodell's lushly curvaceous receptionist, Lecia. "Yes, darling! Why are you here so late?"
"Again?"
Sherlock snorted. "Nothing could be further from the truth." He saw John's smile grow strained and hurried to change the subject. "You know you don't have to go to Lestrade and Molly's for dinner. I mightn't. I'm not certain that I can bear two hours of the pair of them cooing and allogrooming. Puts me right off my food."
"No," John interrupted. "No, you wouldn't have told me a thing, not if it weren't necessary."
, at least," Jim snarled. "Go on, get out. I can manage." He drew his Glock – sexy little thing – out of his pocket and caressed it before repocketing it.
"Fine, my arse. That's the third time you've passed out in as many days. That I
They went out and found a cab in short order. "8 King Street, St James's, please," Sherlock said as he climbed in.
Mycroft perched on the edge of the table and crossed his arms again, a none-too-benevolent judge. "Which was when, precisely?"
"And I had some rather interesting toys delivered – they arrived two days ago. I'll bring them tonight, what say you?"
The story was told from John's point of view. Strange…and…oddly precise.
January 2017
"Why don't you have a shower?"
John smiled a little. "Did she leave you her millions?"
Sherlock scowled at John. “When did I become so transparent?”
Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth turn upward, against his will. "Do tell."
Oh, God, for one free hand. Sherlock made a vow to himself: Jim Moriarty was not getting out of this alive. One way or another, Sherlock would see him dead.
"I know you don't want to hear this right now, but there's a psychopath in our flat. I don't know how he got in, but I'd like to get him out as soon as possible. Give me the word and I'll tell him to shove off and break in some other day."
"No!" Vertue tugged on Sherlock's jacket. "Darling, sit down. Come on, you've had a really rough evening. We'll get some food in you, glass of wine, maybe, and you can go to bed early."
"Hi, Johnny."
"Nope. Thanks."
He was relieved, in retrospect. Because it hadn't been Sherlock after all, and now he didn't have to deal with the fallout that would have almost certainly occurred. And it hadn't been one of his finer moments, anyhow; he'd never have just grabbed a woman and snogged her without at least tacit permission, much less chided her angrily about not responding properly afterwards. Anyone who'd do that was an arsehole, in John's book, and deserved to be slugged. But John had been the one doing the slugging. Oh, God, what a mess. Best to put the whole thing behind him.
"It's canon," Tom said, putting the plates in the sink. He started to clean up the cooking detritus. "Pretty explicitly, too. Sherlock Holmes is not interested in women."
Molly unbuttoned his shirt, exposing his naked chest, and rubbed the palms of her hands over it, grazing his nipples. She bent and kissed his neck, beneath his chin, suckled the lobe of one ear. Tiny noises escaped her, and she ground against him harder, rough and urgent. "Come on. Please."
A reply had come a few hours later.
"You've never even had it," Mary said. "It's fluffy and delicious, and you're going to love it."
"That little stunt you pulled today, for example. With Miss Adler's mobile."
, in fact.
Sherlock noted Molly's greenish complexion as well as the smell of lemon balm tea drifting from her mug. "Morning sickness already?"
Molly shook her head and didn't answer.
Even in the dim light, John's face was flushed. He grasped Sherlock's knees, pressed them wider apart, and lowered his head.
"Not yet," Sherlock said. "First we're heading back to Kerstin Tresler's flat."
Sherlock blew out a breath and headed for the offices. Time to charm the figurative pants off whoever passed for a catering manager and find some sort of guest list for that evening. It would have been more fun with company, but needs must, after all.
"I'll. Try." Benedict attempted a reassuring nod, but he was fucked, wasn't he? He rather thought he was. But Tom was okay. That was good. Good.
"Yeah – how about 'She sells seashells by the seashore. The shells she sells are surely seashells. So if she sells shells on the seashore, I'm sure she sells seashore shells.'" Peter chortled at his own petulant wit.
Sherlock waved a hand. "Pfft." He pulled his phone out and hit the GPS tracker. "Damn it! John, give me your phone."
Sherlock merrily ignored John and bounded up the stairs – admittedly not at top speed, but not bad. Where were his notes on Moran? In John's old room, that was it, stacked on the bed under a few layers of things. Well, a few dozen layers possibly.
Molly apparently decided not to push the issue. "What does he need privacy for?"
"Great!" It had been necessary to leave Bart's. Pretending to work there took more time than actually working there. "The hours are really flexible and the pay's a bit higher. I might be able to get a flat of my own soon. It'd be great to have people over without three flatmates hanging about playing video games and not doing the washing up. I miss being able to come down and see you, though. How's life at Bart's?"
Benedict had gone downstairs, stomping emphatically like an angry child. Tom heard his thumping footsteps, heard the fridge door open and bang shut, heard various mutterings and thudding until Ben went into his study and threw himself onto the sofa. Tom waited for the sound of the television – Ben liked to soothe himself with movies, an excellent habit – but only silence followed the thud of twelve stone on cushioned leather.
Amazing that Sherlock's considerable will didn't quite extend to easily keeping his mouth shut. He burned with curiosity about John's remark in the flat, that life was exhausting. Because John had
"Tell me about it."
Sherlock smiled. "Well, if you haven't got anything better to do, you might as well talk to me."
Suddenly the silence of understanding is not enough to soothe. He wants the man beneath him to be beside him. Pressed close.
"I hope I'm interrupting."
The idea of being caught out again in this wretched place, especially now as he was dressed in his full armour and in the company of two companions as though on parade, turned his stomach into knots.
John paused briefly, staring at the empty mouth of the stairway, unsure how much time he should take..perhaps he should wait until he was bidden...the choice was made for him when he heard Sherlock's deep voice call to him. "Come in Captain. It does either of us little good to have you loiter outside."
"I love you."
(See the end of the chapter for
To John's utter surprise, Sherlock drew in closer and delicately wrapped his arms around John's belly, hooking his chin over John's scarred shoulder and finally speaking softly right next to his ear. "You shouldn't trigger Dionaea muscipula without feeding it John, it puts severe strain on the plant." He felt a kiss on his trapezius.
He giggles when Sherlock surges up to nip at him. "Stop. We have to stop."
the distance between Sherlock and John grows smaller.
"The gizzard is the second pouch, which is necessary for those birds that eat seeds to have in order to break up the food into smaller bits so that they can be more easily digested. For those that have not developed this muscle, such as in the case of the organically fed Sebastopol which is given a herbivorous diet in order to enhance the taste of its musculature, it becomes necessary for the bird to take up small stones to use in its place.
With a combined effort at Sherlock's barked orders, a perfectly headless body was lifted from the water in a double sling carry and brought laboriously to shore. Meeting Sherlock halfway, John took him by the elbow, not all that surprised to feel Sherlock pull in the direction of the body. As if he were going to continue investigating.
"So," Sherlock's voice was puzzled, "you did not cleave his head from his shoulders?"
"And what is your answer today, my lambkin?" Charles asked. As he asked every morning.
Brother Michael did. And when John asked again, he read it again gladly.
"Eliminating all extraneous variables, as I told you before." Sherlock said distractedly. He was keeping his glass eyes trained exclusively onto a door at the back of the room, where the party of men he'd been watching previously had disappeared into.
The cadaver was barely more than a hollowed out bowl of bone and tissue by this time. All his thoracic organs having been removed and spread out in chapters next to him on a rolling gurney with high sides covered in heavy plastic.
"It is also interesting to note that it is a flesh fly whose eggs are usually laid on a body’s natural orifices: ears, eyes, nose, and genitals, or on any open wounds. Which means that if there is a large population on any one site, there is a high probability that there has been some sort of trauma to that area. So, that in turn can be helpful information if one was having to, say, make deductions from a far distance and could not get immediately to the body. As happens some times." He matched it up with its corresponding larva, a little brown thing that looked like a spiky grub and pinned them in place.
"Bothersome things, baths." Sherlock said airily, letting his fingertips linger on John's palm as he slid his hand away. "But there is something to be said for how it feels afterward. Undress, please."
In one sharp breath John Watson was awake. Opening his eyes to a sky that was beginning to turn the livid color of pre-dusk while the little calf beneath his head bleated and squirmed in demand to be set free.
John has his full attention now and his cool eyes are on FIRE.
Belatedly, John had the idea that maybe the answer to Sherlock's 'shyness' was in that folder he'd burned. A clue. John willed himself to stop this nonsense. Maybe he could just straight out ask the man what was going on and be done with it.
"No idea who those people are, but that's a start." Ben tossed the violin to the sofa and folded his arms, the bow still in one hand. "Go on."
"Outside," he hissed, stabbing a finger toward the cockpit. Obediently, Sherlock rose and moved through the dark blue curtains. John turned to Nora, who looked frightened. "We'll just be a moment, darling. Stay here, all right?"
– and returned his attention to John and Nora.
Sherlock looked up at Mark, re-ordering his clothes. "I…that was a mistake."
What the hell was all this, anyhow? Moriarty was angry because he thought Sherlock harboured a thing for John? It made a crazy kind of sense; Jim Moriarty was the very definition of obsessive, luring Sherlock into those games, playing with lives because he was bored, but surely he didn't desire Sherlock that way. He didn't seem…well, he'd never given much thought to Moriarty's sexuality, which was probably for the best.
John wrung Sherlock's hand, irrationally glad for the barrier of the leather glove. "So, it's all right if I go in?"
He sucked a breath in through his nose. "Fine."
"I'd like to meet him again, though," Nora said.
“You always have been.” John grasped Sherlock’s arm and pulled him in for a quick kiss. “Happy Christmas. Idiot.”
Mary got up and went for the bottle of wine. She poured herself a glass, and then poured more into John's glass before setting the wine on the table between them and sitting once more. "You've always loved him."
Bitterly, he wondered if Sherlock would evidence any fear at – oh, God. Of course he had. The pool. His face. And how shaky he was, freeing John from the Semtex. Saving John and Sarah from the Black Lotus gang. The incident with the Clarence House Cannibal. The Talbot Conundrum, when John had been strung upside-down over a churning smelting vat. And other times, almost too many to count. Maybe Molly had it wrong – she was a romantic anyhow – and maybe Sherlock did love John, only not the way she thought. Maybe it would never be love the way John hoped, but that was okay. It was okay. You didn't risk your life for someone, over and over, unless you felt strongly about them. It was what you did, not what you said, that mattered. Yeah, Sherlock was an insufferable dick, but it was true, what John had told Ben – he'd allowed John to be exactly who he was.
"There's more," Sherlock said as the cab pulled up.
"Ye-es," Sherlock intoned. "He's probably involved in some way, but he's half round the twist. He's a bundle of sticks in an expensive suit and he's close to a mental breakdown. If you're going to arrest him, do it before he snaps altogether and gets off on a defence of insanity or automatism."
March 2015
"What?" John skidded to a halt. "What?"
“Oh, I think you heard me.” Martha turned to look him in the eye.
, Benedict thought disjointedly – and brandishing short-barrelled automatic weapons (Kalashnikovs, specifically. Looked like custom jobs) strode in.
"That's putting it mildly."
Mycroft blew out a breath. "As ever. She'd appreciate a call."
"I can't wait to upgrade!" the second newsreader said brightly.
"I know." Mary took a step forward and enfolded him in her arms, resting her cheek against his back. "I know. Look, you've always been…amazing. Don't think I don't know that. I know this was out of the blue, but she tracked me down, she wanted to see me, meet you and Nora. It's going to be…she's going to call me Annie, John."
"Give me the gun," Moriarty demanded, holding his hand out to Moran. "Now."
"See, that's just like you, Sherlock. You just can't compromise. You'd be a failure in business."
"Yeah." Benedict stilled. "My shoe was untied, and I put my pen in my mouth to tie it, and I grabbed a raw cable – is that it? Some sort of electrically induced hallucination?"
"John." Mary's eyes pleaded, but her tone was calm. "Let's not. Not with Nora right up –"
"Wait," Sherlock said, and held a hand out. "Listen."
. Eagerly, John fumbled for the reply.
"So what's the case?" Mary called from the loo.
Moriarty had threatened her, or John, or Nora, or all three, clearly – that was his modus operandi, never known to fail, and Mary had been susceptible to it. Mary, who was so resourceful, but who had weaknesses no assassin should ever have.
"Very well. I'll send a small detail, two people at most. They'll trail you at a distance. And you'll wear a wire."
“What a surprise.” John bit his lower lip. “I miss you, you know.”
"No, of course I didn't!" John snapped.
"Thank you," Sherlock rasped.
Mycroft nodded soberly. "I think that would be best," he said, and left the room.
"Yeah, use the one in our bedroom – Nora's probably in the one at the top of the stairs," John said. "End of the hall, the light's on the right, loo's on the left."
Benedict picked up a sandwich and munched on it, still staring at the letter. He rubbed his fingers and thumb over it, flipped it over, flipped it again, and re-read, his eyes tracking the single-spaced words rapidly. He set the sandwich down and felt blindly for his cup of tea.
Tom moved to the sofa, unceremoniously lifted Sherlock's feet, seated himself, and rested Sherlock's feet on his lap. Sherlock bit down on a 'what the hell do you think you're doing' and stayed silent as Tom slipped off Sherlock's shoes. "I should say you have. You're still in costume. And makeup! What happened, did they go late?" One by one, he dropped Sherlock's shoes on the floor and pulled off his socks. He pressed his thumbs into the middle of Sherlock's right foot and began massaging in circles.
He shivered. He hadn't brought himself off – it always took him a while if he was masturbating, and that hadn't been nearly long enough – but that didn't matter either. He freed his hand and rose shakily to his feet, coming almost nose to nose with a panting, red-faced Gatiss.
Two cars waited nose to nose at the launch pad:  a black Mercedes and his own steel-grey Bentley. He got out of the 'copter first and headed for the cars, waiting for the Under-Secretary, who hadn't spoken a word during their ride. It was a little loud for conversation, true, but no time like the present. Jim's driver got out of the car and opened the rear door. "Not yet," Jim said. "Unfinished business." When the man joined him, Jim smiled. "Thanks for that. Another hour and I might have had to eat lunch."
"John –" he tried to shout, but his head was dragged back, and a thick hand clamped over his face. He sucked air in through his nose and staggered.
Cumberbatch blinked. His mouth dropped open. "Oh. Oh my God." He closed his eyes and folded his hands together. "Oh, God, I thought I'd be stuck forever."
milk, he wasn't going back into the horrorshow that was the Holmes and Watson refrigerator.
Sighing, Mycroft replied.
"John."
"Half twelve. Almost."
"Yep. Not a typo."
"No," Sherlock said. He peered blearily at John. "Are you all right?"
John's hips slapped against his flesh, damp now with sweat, and as he drove into Sherlock's body, riding him hard, they heaved together, slamming the headboard against the bed. Sherlock's thighs and belly tensed, his fist tightening, and he shuddered, crying out as he spilled over his half-clenched fist. He lay in a pleasant daze as John stabbed his way to climax and then sagged, turning his face aside and pressing it against Sherlock's chest.
Benedict placed both hands on the sink and took a deep breath. "John."
the trail get cold. Good God in heaven." His lips, dry and half-frozen, refused to work properly; he moistened them with a nearly as dry tongue. "Did you strew a few half-dead red herrings in my path as well, to
"Told you he'd know," Moriarty said. "I helped out with that. It was how we met, really."
"That's…that's really good of you, Mr Cumberbatch. I needed that lift today. Thanks."
it's doing there?" Sherlock retorted. "I want a cut."
Moriarty screamed and laughed and sobbed, clawing blindly at the glass, at his face and hair. He convulsed on the cold concrete floor of the cell as the neurotoxin did its work. Wordlessly, Mycroft and Sherlock drew closer together, watching and listening as Moriarty's screams became groans, and then grunts.
"Oh my God. Thank you!" She clutched her clipboard to her chest and all but skipped away. As Benedict watched, she made her way to Andrew's side and proffered the clipboard with the same shy, ducking motion and aura of worshipful awe.
Then he took it out again.
"I couldn't tell you," Mary said. There were dark circles under her eyes visible beneath her light makeup. She turned to Moriarty. "You know it's over, right? You're not getting out of here alive."
Good idea. Sherlock put the phone face-down on the sleek, spotless worktop and roamed the house, his socks squelching water. He went from front room to hallway to library (neat package of post and books and thick magazines in a cotton carrier bag sitting by the laptop, a note with 'B' sitting atop it) up to the bedroom, second bedroom, small room holding cardboard boxes and a pile of middling-quality luggage, bathroom, back to bedroom, dressing room. The wild disarray of clothes was gone; the clothes and accessories were back on hangers, folded, stacked on shelves. A single vivid full-blown vermilion-coloured rose stood in a bud vase on the night table.
"Don't you trust me?"
Sudden panic seized and tore at him, cat's claws shredding his insides. His head wasn't in the clouds. He kept up with the news, he voted, he paid taxes, he'd given as much attention as possible to the details of his house and motorbike and car purchases. He lived within his means and was more successful than either of his parents had been at his age, and he was well on his way to complete security. He was a responsible adult, but this was the official end of his tether. He'd never been responsible for someone's life before.
Glancing at the sofa with its worn fabric and lumpy, sagging cushions, John raised a mental set of eyebrows. Bourgeois of him, but honestly the place looked as if it could have used a good cleaning. Motes danced in the shaft of light from the open curtains and the bookshelves were furred with dust, and the room needed prolonged airing. But maybe it had always looked that way, smelled that way, and he just hadn't noticed. It hadn't mattered. "As long as it's comfortable." He turned back to Sherlock, who hadn't moved.
"The violation's not on your end, damn it. Those cables are meant to be safe." Tom peered closely at him. "You're sure you're okay?"
"Well," John said, "you could impress them, then. You look nice in hats."
A bright sting pierced Benedict's neck. He moved to touch the sore spot, and his hand was seized and wrenched upward. He yelped with the sudden pain and belatedly realised what the sting had been.
"Brealey!" Sherlock got up and faced Tom, swaying a little with the champagne.
The Land Rover braked to a stop, and Henry got out. In the rear seat, Tom had stopped crying, but was still struggling to free himself. Annoyed, Sherlock thumped against the back of the seat in an effort to get Tom to calm down, but it didn't seem to help. Attempting speech was pointless, so Sherlock sighed loudly through his nose and went limp as Henry opened the hatch.
John nodded. "Okay. How much?"
"Oh." Sherlock shrugged and slipped his phone into his pocket. "I suppose. If you like that sort of thing."
Dedalus Communications (tabloid efforts to nickname it DedCom upon its emergence had fallen oddly flat, and that was the extent of John's knowledge of the firm) was headquartered in the top eleven storeys of a shiny East End high rise built three or four years before. Its culture, as far as John was able to determine from the two hours he and Sherlock had loitered in the lobby so far, was the touchy-feely sort – the mood seemed loose, with jeans-and-trainers-clad employees lingering in the lobby pub, sprawling on sofas, playing videogames (there were several huge monitors and lots of consoles in the lobby, along with squishy beanbag chairs) or kicking footbags. A hair salon-cum-massage-spa sat at one end of the lobby, crowded with more employees, all distinguishable by the bright green ID cards hanging round their necks, suspended from bright green lanyards. A loose card, stuffed in a forgetful employee's back pocket: that was Sherlock's quarry. Relaxed as the atmosphere appeared to be, no-one entered through the glass doorway leading to the offices without swiping their card. Swiping out wasn't a requirement; employees entered through one door and left through another. Someone leaving for the day, Sherlock said, who wouldn't miss their card for some time. Then, it was just a matter of deft pickpocketing.
"Maybe I should."
Sherlock hadn't breathed a word about Moriarty being a consulting criminal. Why? God, what a bastard….
"That's right."
Molly smiled, then gave a little laugh. "I can see it. I'm not blind. At least, not as blind as you think I am."
John smiled. "No. I've learnt a thing or two myself, actually."
Nora waved. "Hi, Daddy."
"Okay, you're officially out of your head. Damn it –" John grunted and managed to twist out of Benedict's grip. He grabbed Benedict's wrists and squeezed hard enough to hurt. "Listen to me.
John grinned, then laughed despite his headache. "Ah, God. I need some paracetamol."
"Oh. Okay. You said you didn't eat when you – never mind."
had happened to his hair? It had…ballooned. There was no other word for it. Half of it stuck out from his head in a sort of mad aureole, and the other half was plastered to his forehead. He stuck his fingers in it and gave it his usual quick tousle, but that did absolutely nothing.
He opened the box, and a golden glow suffused the room, soft and brilliant at once. Benedict gasped, and cautiously peered inside at two tiny spheres of what looked like gold glass, no bigger than marbles, unfaceted, tiny pinpoints of black dancing within their coruscating depths.
Mycroft ignored Sherlock altogether. "Dr Watson," he said flatly. "How nice to see you again after all this time."
Sherlock frowned. "Stay here. I'm locking the doors." He got out, trotted up to the door, and went inside. A quick reconnaissance of the cellar told him what he needed to know, and he was back up to the main level in moments. He went to the kitchen, picked up the phone, and dialled the Met's Homicide and Serious Crime division, trusting the number was the same.
"I'm fine."
"Difficult to explain," Mycroft said. "All in all, though, a rather elegant solution to get you home. Please take them."
"Oh, don't thank me, Lord Moran," Sherlock said. "You managed that on your own. I just kept the Met and the courts up-to-date on your activities. It's not your usual crowd, is it – IT swots and social-media kingpins?"
Sherlock knew Mycroft wasn't talking about Mummy. "Why?"
"Well." Mycroft sat again. "All is not lost. It seems that piece is a –" He pulled his phone out and consulted it. "An Ernst Wilhelm Nay. The Nazi
Sherlock sighed. "That's Mycroft being a romantic, or perhaps just overselling the case. Highly unlikely, even if the pieces stayed in the hands of descendants of thieves, that they'd actually carry on their ancestors' sympathies. Probably something much duller. Lib Dems or something, who knows." He clasped his hands behind his back. "God, this lift's slow."
"Piss off," Sherlock snarled, and kept moving. He picked up speed, trying to get the heaviness of the wine out of his limbs and brain. Water, lots of it, when he got home. Not home. Not his bloody home.
"Maybe not," John admitted. "I don't know. You feel like you've got to blame someone, though. And what you said about the IRA –"
That explained the 'inheritance' and Mary's sudden desire to travel, to remove John from Sherlock's vicinity. God, of course. What sort of payout had she got for this? Or was it simply that Sherlock was on the case and would inevitably solve it?
"All right." They pulled up to the hotel – not the nicest establishment in town, but not horrible; Mycroft must have wearied of petty revenge. Sherlock got his bag and the box, gave the keys to the valet, and checked them in. Adjacent rooms, en suite bath, perfectly adequate. They got directions to a variety of nearby restaurants, obtained their key cards, and went in search of their rooms. "Right, freshen up and I'll meet you for lunch in twenty minutes," Sherlock said.
Quickly, he browsed a few other texts.
"Look at these kids," John remarked bemusedly. "Haven't they got jobs to do?"
"Just curious. Was it a mutual interest in art?"
The door slammed behind them, and the lock rattled.
It was time for John to make some pleasant noises and take his leave. He cast another look round the flat. It had never really been his at all, now that he looked at it objectively. It had always been Sherlock's; Sherlock's needs and wants, his tastes had always dominated, and John hadn't made his presence known there, much. Come to think of it, he didn't make his presence known at home much, either. Mary and Nora's tastes prevailed there. Partly it was that he was neat, disciplined, and minimalist before it became a fashion, but he'd always had more than a dash of transience in his nature, as if he was ready to pack up at a moment's notice. But then, that was a soldier's existence, wasn't it? He supposed he'd just got used to that life.
"Those injections can be tricky," John said. "Do you want me to come with you, see you home?" He closed his mouth with a snap.
"Of course I'm worried, you git. You just took current that threw you back a metre and a half and knocked you unconscious."
"Be generous with the lubricant," Sherlock said. "It's been ages."
"You okay?" Molly asked, not quite looking at him.
"It's my job," Irene replied. "And I'm good at it."
Both men eyed him reflectively, probably examining the growing bruise on his face, but remained impassive. "It's understandable that you're under stress, Mr Holmes, but it's easier for us to do our jobs if you're a little less…volatile," the first man said.
"Disregard," John said. It didn't matter, none of it, not right now. Ruminating was only going to distract him. He needed to focus and get Sherlock out. "Any movement?"
"Go on. Get some rest. You look awful." Sherlock grinned and made a shooing motion.
Escape seemed less and less likely. They hadn't wanted anything from him. There were no threats, no demands for information, no sense of failure underlying Moran's relentless punishment. There was no particular ingenuity in his method. There hadn't even been a sense of entertainment; Moriarty had watched with enthusiasm for a while, but had left, leaving Sherlock alone with Moran, who'd continued his assault without words. At last the beating had stopped. Moran had strapped a blindfold over Sherlock's face and abandoned him to darkness and his distress. After several unsuccessful attempts to free himself, Sherlock had tried to sleep in his painful tethers, but relaxing meant pulling on his shoulders, resulting in anguish.
"You should ease up on the speed," Peter observed sourly.
There wasn't time for consolation or coddling. Tom could cry in the car on the way home. Sherlock retrieved Henry's knife and crouched behind Tom's chair, cutting him free and gathered up the tape that had bound them both, stuffing it in his pockets. The handcuffs he'd have to deal with in London. "Come on," he said brusquely, getting to his feet. "Let's go."
John's face furrowed. "Are you feeling well enough to traipse around? Anyway, it's late."
"Ben – Ben – I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean – I should have stayed and talked it over."
"Doubt it."
"I know where I am," Sherlock rasped.
"I got electrocuted."
"Sleep well?"
"Smartarse," John muttered, and finally took a brief swallow from his own bottle, then wiped at the beads of condensation on the glass. Sherlock had never seen him so fidgety. "I'm trying to do what's best for her now. I don't even know. Hoping the move will help." He kept his eyes trained on the bottle.
"Whatever you want." Tom's lips were parted, his knuckles white. Sweat glittered in the hollow of his throat and down the centre of his chest.
Her fingers found his trousers and unbuttoned, unzipped, and fumbled a bit, and his cock was freed from its confinement of fabric. Sherlock stifled a groan as she rubbed, and then did groan as her arms and legs trapped him even more thoroughly. He closed his eyes, grabbed her arse harder, wanting to be overcome, pinned to the floor, rutting, teeth closing on his throat and John whispering exactly what was going to happen into Sherlock's ear, and –
The effect was staggering.
"Yes." John's voice shakes. Affected more than he thought he would be. Tears burn at his own eyes. "Every time."
King Mycroft was granting John knighthood for his bravery in service to the crown. And because he had not had to climb through the ranks of being a page to being a squire to become a knight and, in fact, having had absolutely no weapons training to speak of beside minor adolescent scuffles, his title was to be purely honorary.
Both pieces were quickly folded into a large linen cloth, held out by a servant around the screen with her head turned away. Immediately taken away to be cleaned.
"Anything." He found himself muttering in earnest, not knowing what else to do. "Anything. Any--anything you need. Sherlock just...Sherlock. Look at me. Please?" The adrenaline was clearing the flu from his sinuses, giving everything happening a strange swimmy quality as Sherlock finally moved back to allow him to see his pale face. But the detective kept his eyes hidden.
"I said I would facilitate your pleasure in any way I could John and I stand by that statement." Sherlock said, leaning closer without coming into contact and it was a feat so preposterous that it nearly had John whimpering in regret. "I will take what is mine. If you will give it to me."
John snorted at the presentation, finding it perfect. "No. I think I can manage to stay awake for a while longer. But I do have to use the loo before we start."
He groaned. Unable to sleep.
"No, your Highness."

They'd been invited to take a seat once they'd been checked in by the receptionist, having arrived precisely on time thanks to Sherlock's correct presumptions concerning traffic flow and the offer of an extra twenty pound note to push the speed limit.
What did that infernal git think he was doing? Leaving horrible cups of tea randomly for John to drink? Not only just ignoring, but /avoiding/ John completely with no explanation or even HINT as to what it was that he had even done. John was spoiling for a row now. Something to do. /Anything/ to get some answers.
Walking suddenly doesn't seem like such a doable thing.
"Victor Trevor." John repeated. "What happened with him?" Sherlock could tell from the millisecond too long it took for him to blink, that John was feeling the effects of the scotch, only exacerbated by his empty stomach. He was sitting more loosely with his ankles crossed, but his shoulder was still curled into him, as if to protect it. As he had for a long while now. He needed to solve that tonight. John's stubbornness was enough for the both of them and he needed him well for the case.
"Special occasion. Celebration. Going on a date. Tying up loose ends. Whichever you prefer."
He did not react to the knock that came upon his door. Nor to the bolt sliding back with a metal scream.
John frowns, shaking his head. "No. No love. You wrong. /I/ did this to me Sherlock," he corrects. "I made the decision to go there on my own. All you did was get me out of there. Breaking a couple of bones is nothing compared to the thought of losing you. Do you understand that? You saved my life. Everything you've ever done from the first moment I met you has saved my life. And I am /so/ grateful for that. I want us to stay together. To BE together. Always."
"I was asked to give this to you by Brother Michael."
He spoke his discoveries aloud to an unmoved Sherlock and moved on to investigate the skin of the neck itself.
"Right? 'Til you, I would have never pegged him for the sort - to actually /choose/ to wait to do his thing, I mean. What gets me, is why this one?" He went on. "I thought it looked like a pretty straightforward collision, just a bad mix of pedestrian and bus, y'know. Wouldn't think this'd be worth his time." He scratched his head. "And you know what the absolute kicker is, is how the hell he even knew it was here!"
John relented with a huff. "Look. I'm not. I just...I've never met anyone that didn't at least attempt /some sort/ of relationship with someone at some point. Casual or not. I'm not trying to pry. It's just that you've had no one over since I've met you. Not a single person. I just want you to be...y'know," he reached for the right word, twisting uncomfortably in his seat, "happy."
"Shut up John." Sherlock snapped, burrowing down into his coat like a turtle.
Given the permission he craved; Sherlock explored.
"'Hermit' idiot." John corrected. "Hobbits have friends." He rose despite himself and took up the snuffling thing. The white bulldog puppy with a mottling of brown mewled pathetically as he tucked it against his jumper. Its tiny needle milk teeth latching onto his finger with its tiny beady eyes getting lost in all its ridiculous folds of skin.
"It's been driven into you since you've been invalided that you should write about your experiences and from that an easy extrapolation can be made into why you checked your watch, because you and I both know your therapist is in office today and she takes her lunch at eleven, so you thought that would give you time to call after you're finished with your breakfast. And you may as well tell /someone/ of what happened if you can't tell the public. But given your bleeding heart and the way you scowled you made it incredibly evident that since you have not been attending your therapy sessions for quite some time now, you would think it rude to suddenly 'burden' her with your issues.
"You, of course, looked into them." John remembered vividly the way Mycroft had produced his /confidential/  therapy session notes at their first meeting as easily as if they'd been public domain.
"Over the past week I have been dosing your tea with poison. Perhaps you would have noticed...though I doubt you would have figured it out. It was my attempt to create a failsafe in you, if you will. Should any harm have come to you. If they had gotten their hands on you and I was not able to be there... or if you had found yourself unable to escape and I had come too late...I wanted there to be recourse for your death. You've proven twice now that you're willing to sacrifice yourself. And I am grateful.
They had spoken to each other with their mouths and never said a single solitary word.
A quick lift of his chin towards the window and John was able to see Molly opening the dead man's esophagus with a pair of scissors, all smiles and furtive glances to Sherlock, who was going at the organ bloc with an eighteen inch long knife, slicing the lungs and trachea away from the corpse's over-cooked heart. Totally in his element.
"GAH! Why do I even keep you around?! All Underground trains run on a four-rail system John. Pay attention. There are the running rails; which is what the train wheels rest upon and then there are the conductor rails, which is what the traction current passes through.
"Yes. Well…it was necessary. Obviously, it's best that it's behind us. Best for both of us."
"Really? What
"Get your arse out of here," John hissed. He quietly ascended the stone steps.

He realised he'd never replied to the text Mary had sent about the transfer being complete. "That's lovely. I hope you said thank you."
Surely Conran didn't expect an answer, what with the trifecta of his stinking breath, his heavy body crushing the air from Sherlock's lungs, and the gun he was shoving into Sherlock's mouth. In any case, the answer wouldn't have pleased him.

be so cheeky and pompous. She’d wait.
"Can't think who that would be," John said.
"Not much to tell," she said. "I was watching the news –"
"I can imagine," John said. "Do you need to do anything? Go back and sign –"
Sherlock refrained from snorting with some difficulty. The false urbanity had grey hairs and a pension; he was more curious to see more of the rage that lay behind the mask. The sticky bit would be seeing it without losing life and limb, much less a couple of fingernails. He felt Henry's fingers digging into the flesh of his arm and thought that he'd be afforded the chance very soon.
"I have no answers for you," Mycroft said. "And as far as I know, Sherlock has never experienced this type of anomaly before. I'm certain I'd have heard all about it were that the case. I insist that you remain available while I research the problem." He picked up the snips again, then crouched to cut Benedict's ankles free.
Hallucination. It was a hallucination. Except that now he was wearing that other guy's clothes, the stunt double or whoever he was, he was
John was looking at his hand in dismay.
Tom took another deep breath and then said it. "Sherlock. Holmes."
"Is this all right?"
Benedict shrugged off his coat, went into the front room, and halted in his tracks.
Sherlock – no-one could. How the fuck could he save John Watson's life if he couldn't even shop for his own fucking groceries?
John halted in his tracks, dragging Nora to a stop. "
"Mary –"
"I won't stay long," Sebastian said, walking into the room and looking round. "Did you ask him, Steenie?"
"What? What have I been?"
"Oh, Veuve Clicquot. Better than I'd thought. Ben's got great taste, and I don't think he'll mind if we drink the whole fucking thing under the circumstances. Open that, will you?"
Sherlock blinked. "Hadn't noticed."
"Don't," Mycroft retorted. "I understand that he's grieving, but that makes him no less a fool. Tell me, Sherlock – did you listen to him spout that nonsense?"
been discovered, or at any rate where it was when he got the tip about it. Now it's gone, of course. The owner, as was, is named Kerstin Tresler, born 1945 to Gerhard and Roderika Tresler. Gerhard was a very minor Schutzstaffel officer, mostly a paper-pusher for the Ahnenerbe."
"Don't plug it in." John shouldered past him and yanked open a drawer, pawing through it rapidly. "I'm taping it up again.

"Ridiculous," Sherlock muttered, struggling into a sitting position.
"Six thousand eight hundred and twelve pounds," Nora read. She stared at the book, her lips moving silently. "This is mine?" she asked after a moment.
, do you?"
Mycroft nodded and set the photo down. "Meredith's full title was Special Projects Procurer. Her chief role was that of a private buyer of lost items – specifically, items illegally acquired during the Second World War. She was personally responsible for the restoration of over fifty priceless works of art. Some of them were returned to family branches of private owners, some repatriated to national museums, and some have simply been stored."
Sherlock banged his mug on the windowsill, leaving a splash of tea on the woodwork and curtains. He dashed to the rack, tore his coat from a hook, and hurried into it, throwing the door wide open. Funny – no evidence that he'd ever had a bad knee. Perhaps psychosomatic arthroscopic injury was contagious. "Do you want to –"
"'These Foolish Things,'" Fann said. "Thought so. Don't apologise. I like when you're happy, even if your voice isn't a patch on Billie's."

"Is this an effective technique on most of your patients?"
"Hosted by Nick Dedalus, of Dedalus Communications."
"Call her now," Sherlock suggested. "Quickly, though. We're fairly close to Lord Moran's house."
"You ignore her," Mycroft pointed out.
Sherlock shrugged. "A bit."
"Do you want to be friends again?"
"I knew that," John said a bit too quickly. "I like that low-cut back stuff."
"Well…not especially. Not as children. She's more than a decade older than I am."
"Well, I hope you don't mind if I don't send him an invitation to her party."
Sherlock set the bottle down and inspected Nora for a moment. He put a hand out. "Hello, Nora."
Nothing. Lots of dust, though; his abrupt movement released a choking little cloud. He coughed and climbed back on the bed, dropping the pen into the box and closing the lid. Well, that was sorted, at least:  no potential assassins in the room any longer. Sherlock was stirring, muttering unintelligibly, and his brow was knotted. John laid a hand on his forehead. "Shh. I'll be right back, okay?"
." TWH's ordinarily mild blue eyes kindled with rage.
TWH rubbed his sore, reddened wrists. "Thank you." He peered curiously at Sherlock, but said nothing more.
"I couldn't," John said simply. "I had a job to do."
“Yeah. Well done, good deduction.” John sighed and decided not to pursue the matter further. He’d said what he’d come to say. Mostly. “All right if I let Rosie sleep a bit longer before we shove off?”
"Alone," Sherlock muttered.

He lay the
Had Mary and John's meeting been chance, or a feat of engineering? Sherlock hadn't seemed to know.
"Right," Sherlock said softly. He smiled at John. "See you then."
"Not really."
"No."
"Fine," Mycroft said impatiently. "What's the connection to Meredith?"
"As tombstones go," Sherlock replied with a shrug. He'd have died rather than admitted it because it really was a fanciful notion, but he preferred old-fashioned tombstones with ornate carving and macabre imagery. He'd gone along willingly enough with Mycroft when the time to choose them had come, though – his parents had opted for simplicity. Square stones, names and dates, husband and wife of. He suspected that his brother would have preferred a more elaborate stone as well, but Mycroft had been determined to honour their requests.
At long last, his voice growing hoarse, John came upon the story of how he had come to be here.
Sherlock pulled both balls into his open mouth with incredible handless dexterity, rolling them against the cup of his tongue and eliciting an impassioned groan from the good doctor. But when he slurped in more of the thin, stretchy skin and gave all the spoils in his jaw a delicate bite, the testicles compressed and John seemed to jolt back to reality.
