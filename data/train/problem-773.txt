a bit mad, eccentric, brilliant, with several large gaps in his social education. He was mercurial—today it might be showers and hot tea, but who knew what tomorrow would bring?
“Yes, sir,” he answered, voice thick with thirst. This was an appropriate answer. “If you like, sir.” This addition was, somehow, verging on cheeky.
Self: naked, slightly sore, minor bruising, small scratches, mind clear, no regrets.

remember such luxuries as indoor plumbing and bio-pools. “You’d better wash up, too, boy,” he advised Nico, who was huddled in a corner out of the way. “You’re not sleeping in my bed covered in grime.”
“He wasn’t born a slave, he got into it as an adult,” Magnus explained to Lestrade as Bay continued wrangling the coverall. “Med school, Army. Presumably an abusive childhood.”
Bay supposed he should not be surprised by the deduction. “Yes,” he admitted.
He heard Nico huff behind him. “I’m not your washerwoman.”
Magnus took his meaning and stiffened. “I assure you, I have no affiliation with any of your previous masters,” he asserted coldly.
This man seemed to understand the significance of that, as Lestrade had. “I see.” He did a quick calculation. “Well, this is very lucky for you, Bay,” he claimed. “I think we can be of assistance to each other.”
“That’s not as much fun!” Magnus declared, as if it should be obvious. “Do you go through a deck of cards, pick out all the best ones, and say that’s the hand you’re playing with? No, there’s no skill in that, no challenge, no interest.”
“Upstairs?” Magnus assumed and Lestrade nodded.
“I know,” Bay agreed, which earned him a frown from Magnus for his confident tone. “You were in Spain, buying me.”
“We’ll stay in London, then,” he decided, watching Bay’s reaction. Bay kept things strictly neutral; he’d had a lot of practice at that. “It might get busy, I think Lestrade will have a new case for me soon. It was terribly difficult to leave when I did, but I had to find you. Have you heard of this?” He turned the mobile around so Bay could see a news headline, something about a string of suspicious suicides.
“The man who kidnapped Aquamarine was the killer the police have been looking for,” Master replied, running his hand through Aquamarine’s hair to calm him.
I’m worried about,” Sherlock replied, dodging away from a grubby pair of hands reaching out to him.
Magnus’s look, of exasperation and disgust, silenced him. “I am not mad,” he declared coolly. “I do not think I can heal you because of the phase of the moon or mystic crystal vibrations. And I think
She gave him another one of those smiles that said he just didn’t get it; it made him angry, and he turned back to the window sharply, clutching his cane. She was just doing her master’s bidding. They all had to, to survive. But there were words for slaves who couldn’t spare even a drop of compassion for others in their situation, and they weren’t very nice words.
, and neither did Master’s mother. He could see endless possibilities for the
“He can,” Master assured her. “Tell her your name.”
He made sure not to put much weight on the injured leg as he started to remove the rest of his clothing. Nico scrambled to obey, more to give himself distance from Ivan’s increasingly unclothed figure. Men lived close together in this time and place, from peasants in tiny hovels to warriors on the march to kings with ever-ready servants. But Ivan had… something of a reputation. Apparently it preceded him. In this time and place same-sex relations were looked upon as unnatural, heretical; in Vladim few cared about that if you could win battles and treasure, which Ivan could, but he suspected the people of Marios thought themselves more civilized than that.
was able to open the door and let Taffy out.
Bay did not rise to that kind of challenge anymore. “Probably not,” he confirmed.
“Yes, Molly is an excellent domestic assistant,” the salesman was telling John. “She served her last master for a very long time—Lady Englethorpe?”
Lights appeared in the distance, coming towards them. “Slow down,” Master instructed Irene, curious about who they would meet out here at this time of night. Aquamarine popped back up above the seats, watching the oncoming vehicle warily, since his master was. “Pull over more.” It was a big black SUV, magically pristine despite the dusty setting, and Master seemed to recognize it because he rolled his eyes and relaxed—somewhat—when he saw it up close.
Magnus glanced up at him with an inscrutable expression—was he surprised Bay somehow didn’t already know the answer to this? High expectations, unreasonable. “My housekeeper,” he finally answered. “As I said, I have a flat on Baker Street in London. She wanders around it irritating me.”
“Okay, fine,” Lestrade conceded, surprisingly. “
“The other one, obviously,” Sherlock told him patronizingly, indicating the woman sitting on the floor. He went back to the one who was standing. “This one is no domestic,” he added.
to survive. Perhaps he could have stayed away from crime against others. It was hard to say, now.
, though not what he had assumed it would be, was quite cozy, especially because it seemed to be cold here all the time, even at the sun’s height during what Master claimed was summer.
“Good boy. You were very impressive tonight,” Master finally praised. Aquamarine bared his teeth to underline the point that he was not only clever, but also fierce. Master grimaced slightly. “Yeah, you do still taste like blood,” he admitted, which was apparently a problem. “Go brush your teeth and come back here.” He glanced significantly at the pile of pillows and blankets that served as a bed, and Aquamarine tried to kiss him again, hungrily. Master gave in for a moment, then pulled back abruptly. “Brush your teeth,” he repeated, letting Aquamarine go. He hurried off to obey in record time.
“Yes, well, the car bit is not always required,” he allowed. “Applies here, though.” After a moment he suddenly turned his mobile facedown and rested his full attention on Bay. “I’ve neglected you. I promised to make you comfortable.”
Remarkably Bay found he could agree with this. “Yes.”
“Get out of that!” Irene snapped at him, snatching the bra away. “Put those things back!” Aquamarine snarled at her.
The dragon snorted, which blew Bilbo’s napkin clean out of his collar and into the fire. That happened a lot, though, so Bilbo just pulled out another one and tucked it in more firmly. “So responsible!” Magnus commented in a teasing tone. “So
, this one right here.” He heard the man’s voice dimly, knew the salesman must be answering. “In
“Bay,” he finally called, in resignation, and the slave stopped and turned. He was dismayed to see that he hadn’t gotten very far, and that the man crossed the distance between them quickly. “For Magnus the world is a battlefield,” he stated, and he seemed to be on about something else now, something that made Bay stop and listen. “Some might say you’ve seen enough of battles in your life. But I think you like it.” He smiled like a shark. “Welcome.” Abruptly he turned and walked away, twirling the umbrella as he went.
And the archenemy? Well, deliberately messing with your head—and Bay hadn’t forgotten the very real pain he’d caused him—seemed like just the sort of thing archenemies did.
“Aquamarine.” He said it slowly, dragging the ridiculous syllables out. His master smiled faintly.

After a moment he realized the car had stopped. “This it?” He saw a sandwich shop and a dark blue door.
Ivan eased his way across the mattress. Nico rolled over to face him, knife at the ready—the knife
Master leaned his hand lightly against Aquamarine’s chest, more as a reminder than a real restraint. “He’s useful enough,” he told the other man with deceptive mildness. Aquamarine was not insulted by the seemingly faint praise; he understood that Master just wanted to stop talking to this man and leave. Pride kept him from trying to look less interesting, though, and he could tell the man’s quick eyes were making a thorough assessment of him, even as Aquamarine did the same to
“He’s fine, Irene. Could you not—” John indicated the red marks her nails were no doubt leaving on his shoulders.

Irene finally returned from the house—naturally she’d changed clothes, to something with a little more sun protection though it could hardly be called modest. “Sunscreen, Master?” she offered innocently, and John let her apply it to his face and neck, enjoying the massage she added in. Suddenly her nails dug into his skin. “Oh, look what he’s doing,” she tattled in annoyance, and John saw Aquamarine trying to climb the oak tree. “He’ll tear his new clothes!”
.” Bay’s eyebrows rose. “His
Nico gave him a perfect look of petulant displeasure, and Ivan tried not to grin at it. “I’m very good with a sword,” he insisted. “Only my mother made the King promise to keep me out of the fighting. So, I was a messenger. This one’s stuck.”
, definitely a lot of science that Aquamarine was ignorant of—chemicals and technology, like Master’s glowing folding thing with buttons that he wasn’t to touch. Master never said
“I do seem to heal well,” he conceded, which he didn’t consider much of a concession. Some people just
“Stop.”
“Um, what’s that on his shirt?” his mother asked suddenly, and John tried to remain casual.
“Naturally,” Irene agreed. “Do you like that idea?”
“It’s fine,” Magnus declared. “His name is Bay. This is Sergeant Sally Donovan—“
“Four people are dead,” Magnus reminded him unnecessarily. “There isn’t time to talk to the police.”
“The salesman thought otherwise.”
to be pink, obviously,” Magnus decreed, with false modesty.
“Yeah, sure, of course,” he heard himself saying, and Magnus’s brief grin dazzled him.
“What? No,” Magnus denied, texting furiously.
, you do need to keep a better eye on him, and not let him go wandering off on his own all the time,” he chided. “Otherwise what’s the point of you being here?”
“Nico,” the boy replied, without further games. Ivan found it interesting that he gave only his familiar nickname, and not all the other names and titles to which he was due. Maybe he realized he wasn’t due them anymore.
He was on the point of shutting the door to undress when Magnus spoke again, his voice still safely situated in the kitchen. “You’re very agreeable and polite,” he judged, not sounding entirely thrilled with this.
Magnus approached the body slowly, eyes darting everywhere, but systematically. Bay could practically hear his mind clicking like a camera shutter as he took in one detail after another, unfazed by the larger picture. That was the secret, Bay supposed—one of them, anyway. He was still thinking about Jennifer Wilson, the woman in pink, dead in an abandoned house in Lauriston Gardens. Magnus was thinking about something else entirely—he shook his head slightly and then crouched down, running his hand along the back of her coat and studying his gloved fingers. He dug into her coat pocket and pulled out a small folding umbrella (surprisingly not pink) and examined it. Then he checked under the collar of her coat.
Under the table Aquamarine finally poked his head out from Master’s jacket. From this viewpoint things didn’t look so different. He didn’t know what the floor was made of, but then again he was hardly an expert on flooring. Table and chairs matched, different style than he was used to, obviously the sort of thing Westerners preferred, being up high. He slipped his arms into the jacket and pulled it tight around him; the air was chilly despite the risen sun. His arms stuck out of the sleeves but the rest of it was too big for him.
“It makes sense that you’re a slave, though,” Magnus claimed. “Or else, why even
Bilbo set the egg down and wiped his hands, then took a few sips of tea. “I don’t like when you do that,” he remarked neutrally.
“Maybe we should drop by Baker Street while we’re in town,” Sherlock suggested, without subtlety.
In the middle of the night Nico woke, disoriented, hot limbs wrapped around him. His first instinct was to struggle.
“Why isn’t she with the other pleasure slaves?” Sherlock asked challengingly, not looking at the salesman.
Magnus closed the door in his face. “Yes, thank you for your input.” His attention was still on his phone.
“The stairs.”
New name, didn’t matter, people got excited giving new things pretty names. It wore off quickly, became a curse instead of an endearment.
“He won’t wear them!” Irene said crossly, appearing in the doorway with a pair of Doc Martens.
Although, loud motorized vehicles with blinding lights swarming them was another situation entirely, one that Aquamarine didn’t know how to deal with. “It’s okay, it’s okay, come here,” Master said, trying to still his nervous scampering. “You’re alright, calm down.” He kept a firm hand on Aquamarine’s collar so he couldn’t get lost in the chaos.
Master ignored that. “I told him to cover up and wear sunscreen,” he agreed. “Everyone has to do that. And we do try to eat in a civilized manner,” he went on, and Aquamarine paused, lowering the bowl from his mouth where he’d been shoveling grapes, almonds, and olives directly in. “You’ll be fed regularly, there’s no need to stuff yourself.” Easy for
Magnus paused. What would he do, when faced with this defiance? What factors were important to him? Witnesses? The openness of the market? Lack of instruments to mete out discipline with? Bay would soon discover this information, and then he would know for the future.
Bay glanced around. “Who’s your master?” he asked. If she’d been sent by Magnus he needed to train her better.
Passage of time: healed injuries indicated weeks, even months—illogical—other evidence suggested only days—also illogical. Double-checking that mind was clear.
Nor did this anger Master. “Don’t provoke him, Irene,” he said, his voice suggesting she probably wouldn’t listen. “Let him get used to you first. Irene can be very bold, but she means well,” he added to Aquamarine, who had picked up on that easily enough himself. At least about Irene being

Ivan chuckled, although he didn’t think Nico was trying to be funny. Maybe his memories
here.” He couldn’t even say the word very loudly in her backyard. “And neither is anyone else. Don’t worry, it’s a short visit,” he added, perhaps more quickly than he’d meant. “I think we’ll leave the day after tomorrow, and go to my flat in London. Have you ever heard of London? It’s a very large city.” John knew he was rambling at this point, but he was trying to convey to Aquamarine that he was being included in these plans. “Everyone has their own room and bathroom at my flat, so you won’t have to share with anyone. Hey.” He leaned down over Aquamarine, trying to catch his eye. “If I decide to sell you I will let you know well in advance, alright?” Being sold was often a terrifying experience for a slave, and not a fear to be dismissed—even if the current master was bad, at least they were
“Protective rather quickly, isn’t he?” Lestrade observed.
Magnus hesitated, but kept walking; the lemonade stand faded into the distance. “Don’t call me master.”
Magnus frowned at him. “Doesn’t that hurt?”
. “I expect members of my household to not hurt each other,” he went on sternly.
And for
“It’s not my
“Oh, for G-d’s sake, if you’re just making this up,” Lestrade accused, and Bay was glad to know someone else was thinking this too, because it rather reminded him of the rambling phrases Magnus had rattled off in the market.
His protest was not very convincing; Ivan thought he could successfully press his case, for a few more minutes at least. But he had promised he would stop when asked—for tonight, anyway. Tomorrow was a different story.
, to solve this drug-related murder of a free woman in pink. How he could hope to contribute anything worthwhile anyway was beyond him.
Bay sat back in his chair, deliberately turning away from his master. “I’d prefer not to.” Dangerous, very dangerous. Somehow with Magnus it seemed less so, but every master had their breaking point.
Magnus reached for his face and Bay turned away, nauseous and terrified, so his hand dropped to his shoulder. “Bay, I’m sorry,” he said gently. “I didn’t mean to upset you. Can you calm down?”
it! Aquamarine opened his mouth to prove this, then cleared his throat and coughed a little. He wasn’t used to speaking, most people didn’t want that from a wildling.
“That does happen a lot,” the boy sighed, starting to wrap the injury in a clean cloth.
“Surely you’ve had more adventures than me,” Bilbo demurred, stirring some clothing. Could he rig up an automatic stirrer somehow?
He was going to go mad soon, he feared.
; but honestly his life had stopped making sense a long time ago.
“Was he gonna kill him?” Lestrade asked.
Safe enough, on the surface, and it was better to be clean than dirty. “Alright,” Bay acknowledged—saying he
Magnus bounced up while Bay struggled to his feet in the background. “Victim is in her late thirties. Professional person, going by her clothes; I’m guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink,” Magnus judged. “Traveled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night. It’s obvious from the size of her suitcase.”
“Sell?” Aquamarine asked in a quiet voice, staring at his knees.
The first step was moving, which he did cautiously, quietly, until it became apparent this triggered no outside response and he shook his limbs more freely, stretching and testing their usefulness. It was not true he had no pain; but it was slight. He felt almost light-headed without it, like he’d forgotten something he needed. He was clean, too, a curiously bare sensation; he was dressed in a simply shirt and trousers, nothing else, plain and sturdy but well-made and softer than typical slave clothing. The only things in the room were the pillows and blankets he lay on; they weren’t the height of luxury, but soft, durable, serviceable. Good quality, money was at work here, but also pragmatism, a lack of ostentation.
Magnus blinked at him. “D’you know you do that out loud?” he asked curiously.
Bay would really like to know the answer to that question himself. This was the third person who acted like he ought to know who he was, specifically, personally, as if they’d just been on holiday together. It was very unnerving.
“Done? Good,” he noted when it seemed safe. “Now get in bed before you freeze.” The nights were remarkably cold around here.
Master was still talking to Lestrade. Aquamarine really wanted to rejoin them, to make sure his master was safe and knew he could count on Aquamarine to protect him—as
Magnus started walking again. “Yes, London,” he agreed. “It’s a bit dull sometimes, when things are so similar, but I like to find ways to play the game differently. New ways to irritate Mycroft. Always new cases, of course, that’s nice. Sometimes people admit to recognizing me, other times they won’t,” he continued nonsensically. “It’ll be fun to show you to them.”
It was dark out when he left the transport, the cool, moist air of London washing over him. Had he ever been to London? If Magnus had bothered to study his history he would’ve known Bay had spent years there, at uni and med school. The city held good memories for him, mostly. That might be about to change.
“He’s never had a slave before.” Bay was not surprised to hear that, but he didn’t know what reaction Donovan expected. She gave him a critical once-over, eyes focusing on the cane, then on his face, but only as you might inspect a car. Bay knew instantly that she didn’t understand what appeal he held for Magnus. Frankly, neither did he.
Irene was taking in a larger view of the scene. “I don’t think it’s
, though. “Now look, whatever you’re trying to imply—“
quite good,” Bay non-answered, but Magnus made an impatient sound. “Have we met before?” Bay inquired finally. He did not try very hard to recall it himself, because that tended to stir things up; but he didn’t think he could forget a man like this. “I’m sorry, my memory is poor,” he added, focusing on the biscuits. “Where did we meet? Perhaps at a party?” He’d been to lots of parties.
knew he could too, and then straightened so he was looking down on his master from his greater height. John tried not to interpret this as snideness; he couldn’t help how tall he was.
Molly tentatively walked out into the yard with the tube of sunscreen, trying to motion Aquamarine over. He changed direction too abruptly and landed in a tangled heap at her feet. John could see he was frustrated with himself but he stilled when Molly knelt down to help him, mindful of hurting or startling her. That was a good sign; Molly had been through a lot in her life, more than John liked to think about, but she still retained her kind heart somehow. She could just be a little skittish sometimes.
Despite the woman’s attitude, Bay
When the scan ended, Bay turned on the shower. He couldn’t escape the spray, which was breathtakingly cold at first. At least cold was numbing; as the water heated up it began to burn his raw flesh, although the temperature was really quite low, to dig into every scratch and sting, to pound every bruise into a throbbing fury.
He was unaware of much, and yet keenly aware of some things—his injuries, how much he could move, the salesman’s body language. He had ceased to care about the sun beating down on him—that wasn’t going away. He had excluded some nearby shouts from his notice earlier—he didn’t care what they were, even if they indicated some kind of out-of-control vehicle barreling through the market (that was what his imagination had conjured). If said vehicle barreled over
After another hesitation the great beast turned, his tail sweeping the ground behind him. In seconds he was on the other side of the treasure hall; moments later he had vanished.
The car pulled into a warehouse, dim and nearly empty. Such wonderful things always happened in warehouses, didn’t they? Anthea nodded at Bay to get out when the car stopped, and as he did he saw a well-dressed man leaning on an umbrella standing before him. No point in asking which way to go.
the infernal man again.
Bilbo awoke, as always, with a slight sense of disorientation. It had diminished over time but was not yet completely gone. The bedroom he was in was far too grand: soft sheets, blankets wrapped around him like warm clouds, pillows every way he turned. That was just what he could see and feel immediately. Then the intricately carved bedpost or headboard would swim into view, or the rich fabric hanging from the bedframe. By the time he sat up he usually remembered where he was and why, and then without fail a chunk of ice would form in his stomach, heavy with dread. His heart raced, his breath caught, he started to sweat; but then he reminded himself that he wasn’t dead yet, and that was something.

“I didn’t say anything,” Lestrade pointed out, startled.

that because you realized the case would be pink?” Bay said to Magnus on cue. His master appreciated a bit of disbelief and challenge, which highlighted his amazing achievements.
Still, with the evidence he had to go on so far, Bay saw little alternative to sticking with his master. The thought for once did
“What’s wrong?” his mother asked intrusively when Aquamarine didn’t move. “Why isn’t he listening to you?” Obviously her mind was going to
After a long hesitation Bay limped out of the shower into the hall. Magnus, who had been sitting in the front cabin, jumped up and smiled at him. “There! You look much better,” he claimed. “How do you feel?”
Magnus lifted the caution tape on his own and ducked beneath it. “Always, Sally.” He took a deep breath near her. “I even know you didn’t make it home last night.”
Magnus chuckled at the pun—dragons liked a bit of cleverness now and then—but somehow Bilbo knew he was not going to let this drop. Still, the dragon got Bilbo on his head again and picked up the basket, and made his way to the laundry room without further comment.

wearing it!”
“No, I suppose not.” Nico sat back, admiring his handiwork, and Ivan flexed his foot experimentally. It was bound tightly enough to contain the injury, but still gave him freedom of movement. “Very good,” he praised. Nico smiled for a moment, then remembered himself and scowled. “Get me some more water so I can wash up,” Ivan ordered, standing.
leaves her phone at home.”
His master’s hands moved to trace over his chest. Aquamarine mostly watched the other man’s face, reading the signs of his next moves there so he could prepare himself. “You had deep scratches here, do you remember?” his master said, and he finally glanced down at the smooth skin his master’s fingers were lightly stroking. “Two or three months old. They’re gone now.” Aquamarine frowned, trying to remember. Bodily injuries were often deleted from his memory once they were no longer an immediate threat; the body was merely transport, a tool housing his mind. Its discomforts were distractions he couldn’t afford.
considered the treasure hall: a comfortable supply of meat and bread, cheese and fruit, eggs and vegetables, sweetcakes, basic ingredients, tea, and even a keg of beer, though Bilbo hadn’t tried it yet. Everything might have been delivered fresh that morning, despite Magnus busily sealing entrances. Bilbo assembled a nice snack for himself, along with tea to calm his nerves, and ate it quietly at the large, plain wooden table. Apart from the size,
Bilbo felt there was something Magnus wasn’t telling him; but how could a dragon, asleep in his treasure hoard for two hundred years, know anything about Bilbo that the Hobbit himself didn’t know? Unless dragons had some kind of future-sight. Or past-sight.
not doing anything,” Magnus claimed, as he always did. “It’s all
His master slid one arm around his waist and two fingers under his collar, restraining but not choking, not if he stayed in place on his lap. “No, no,” he ordered evenly. “Stop. Calm down. Irene, sit down.” The woman sat gracefully, intrigued and not exactly intimidated. “Irene belongs to me,” his master told Aquamarine. So she was part of the pack, then. He relaxed slightly, though he still felt there was something untrustworthy about her—reckless, perhaps, the way she looked at him like he was a marvelous new toy, letting one pale leg protrude from her gown to draw his eye then gloating about it.
His master smiled up at him. “Good boy,” he praised. He started with Aquamarine’s hands, pale and slender in his own blunt, tanned ones, turning them back and front, curling and uncurling his fingers. “Those look much better,” he judged. Aquamarine didn’t really remember anything being wrong with his hands, but frankly things had become a bit of a blur at the end.
“Very true. He needs a fork, Irene.”
“Sorry,” Molly said, with regret in her tone.
had protected Aquamarine. But he knew he was supposed to stay with Molly and Irene, and look after them on Master’s behalf. This conflict led to a certain restlessness, and he snarled at a uniformed man who wandered a little too close to them.
“I’ve been neglecting you,” Magnus stated regretfully. “I’m sorry. I just got so caught up in the case—” His eyes strayed to the pink suitcase, then snapped back to Bay. “But that doesn’t matter. Not like
“My deodorant?”
“And the other one?” Lestrade went on.
“It was a lot of work,” she huffed, giving Aquamarine a sour look, and he sneered back at her.
“Back of the right leg, tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left,” Magnus rattled off, pointing. “She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don’t get that splash pattern any other way,” he claimed, and Bay was ready to believe anything he said by this point. “Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious—could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night.” He took another look at the splash marks, in case they could tell him more miraculous things, like what she had for dinner or more helpfully, her attacker’s identity number. “Now, where is it?” he pressed. “What have you done with it?”
“Well, there’s some debate about it,” he admitted, as if he couldn’t help it. “You usually disagree with me, in fact. It’s hard to get a definitive answer.”
“Spain,” Bay replied, trying not to betray his confusion.
He had expected the desert vista he’d gone to sleep with, cracked dry earth on the edge of the mud-brick town, the endless brown stretching away on either side with the mountains looming dimly in the background. Instead he saw—riotous green and blazing white. Grass, lush and healthy, prickled his bare feet, carpeting the entire area around the tent; it was fenced in by tall, leafy hedges and dotted by massive trees. And ahead of him, very close, was a house, all white, made of horizontal boards and glass windows in no style he was familiar with. The sky overhead was hazy, indeed just after dawn but overcast. It might even rain.
She gave him a look. “Well, you can never tell with him,” she replied with some exasperation. That didn’t exactly comfort him.
Master leaned back and watched them, his gaze studious. “It’s likely I’ll want you to try having sex with Irene,” he stated blandly, and Aquamarine coughed slightly on a grape he’d been given. Irene pretended this reaction was flattering. “Also Molly. And me, of course.” In case that wasn’t obvious. “Later, after you’ve healed, and gotten to know us a bit better.”
“Yes, sir,” he claimed. “I completely agree, sir.” He could do without slavery, on the whole.
Magnus’s explanations were tidy, but did seem to rely on the statistical likelihood of normalcy, Bay reflected as he dropped the coveralls from his shoulders. A good thing to rely upon, usually, but he’d seen plenty of weird exceptions himself, freak occurrences or personalities or the sheer randomness of life. He’d spent a long time searching for meaning, for purpose in everything that had happened to him, and he saw none—no brilliant conclusion to be drawn at the end of the chain of events. Maybe Jennifer Wilson’s ring was clean on the inside because she took it off every day to shower, maybe the mud on her legs was from being splashed by a cab, maybe her hair was mussed during a struggle with the other person, maybe her case was stolen from the crime scene by an unrelated hoodlum.
“Wipe your feet,” Master instructed, indicating the rough mat just inside the doorway, and Aquamarine did so, the strange texture interesting but not enough to hold his attention in a room filled with so many new and foreign
Nico said nothing, but out of the corner of his eye Ivan saw him finally strip off his jacket and shirt, then his trousers. Studiously Ivan concentrated on cleaning some biological material from the head of his axe. He was going slowly, he reminded himself, and building trust. Well, slowly in a pushy way, granted.
At this Aquamarine hesitated. This was a subjective question, difficult to answer. He
Ivan smirked and tried to be patient. “Were you in the battle?” he asked casually.

Bilbo suddenly felt intensely uncomfortable. And whenever that happened, he became intensely polite. “Oh, sorry,” he said after a pause. “This must be terribly dull for you to watch. I think I’ve got the hang of it, if you’ve other things to do.”
“And how did you sleep, my little gem?” Magnus inquired.
“If you like.”

“Ah, the childhood head injury,” Bay realized.
“What did he do last night?” Mrs. Watson asked fearfully.
“I’ll certainly try,” Bay promised vaguely. He felt like he was supposed to be doing a scene in a play, only someone had given him the wrong script. Or no script at all.
“Hey, hey, it’s alright,” his new master said, stroking his hair. “I know it hurts. I know. But Molly’s trying to help you. Sometimes that hurts first. Do you understand? Hmm? Come on, answer me.” He pulled his hands back and the slave nodded slightly, only once, and the hands returned, kneading the back of his neck and his scalp. “Good boy. That’s right.” He sounded delighted with the acknowledgement.

Ivan smirked with amusement. “Humor me.”
, d----t. And to fortify himself against this task he needed a little snack.
“No,” Magnus interrupted seriously. “Don’t underestimate him. He’s the most dangerous man you’ve ever met. But not our problem right now,” he added dismissively. “What purpose would this game, this… conspiracy against you serve?” He seemed genuinely curious.
“Shut up,” Magnus demanded suddenly.
“Clean,” Aquamarine finally responded, blurting it slightly. It seemed a stupid answer in hindsight.
injured, it was better
Inside the house a not-unattractive man with a laddish air was pulling on a not-very-attractive coverall, and Magnus pointed to a pile of others on the floor. “You need to wear one of these,” he informed Bay matter-of-factly, who began the slow process of dressing.
“There wasn’t a case.”
, though, and not emotional outbursts.
“Well, you know how he is,” the man dismissed. “Should be better now that you’re here.”
For a long moment they just stared at each other. Bay didn’t get the sense she was trying to torment him, frightening Magnus’s slave because she was angry at Magnus himself. She was too matter-of-fact for that. It was almost like a warning, really—though she had to know there was precious little Bay could do about it.
“Sergei, scout out this bridge, see what kind of weight it can hold,” Ivan instructed, tapping a spot on the map. “Dimitri, set up patrols in the forest and village. Vladimir, send scouts to the east, I don’t want a surprise attack from the Loic.”
Magnus stood fluidly, Bay less so. His new master watched him struggle to rise, with his cane and the wall, but did not move to help; that was alright with Bay. Sometimes with helping, or hurrying, he ended up in worse shape.
“So she’s German?” Lestrade prompted helplessly.
“Yes, I can see that,” Magnus agreed, in such a matter-of-fact tone that Bilbo turned to him sharply, and was momentarily startled to realize he was still a dragon, and not a dark-haired Elf with piercing blue eyes. “You are hardly an ordinary Hobbit,” he continued by way of explanation, “or else you wouldn’t be this far from where you started, consorting with thieves. Hobbits not being known as particularly adventurous.”
“Step-father,” Nico corrected. He finally wrenched the boot off and Ivan hissed with pain. Then they saw what had been sticking: dried blood coated the side of Ivan’s calf.
“I think the coffee maker scared him,” John sighed, freshening his cup.
“BAY!” Magnus bellowed from somewhere up above.
buy a houseplant,” Donovan judged, then turned to her radio. “Freak’s here. Bringing him in.”
“Oh, sorry.” The dragon watched him silently for a while. “Should you want to return to the Shire someday?” he asked idly.

, in fact, much cleverer than anyone else. And he had the scars to prove it, or he used to until they were healed by Molly. Masters didn’t like having a clever slave, a slave who was cleverer than they were. His breath came quicker as he tensed, unable to deduce what Master would do next.

clean,” he instructed. “We’ll have tea when you come out.” He shut the door.
“I’m tired, and I’m cold, and I’m hungry,” Bay announced defiantly. “I’d prefer to stay here.”
“And you turned out to be quite good at it,” Magnus anticipated gleefully.
Bay was slightly startled by the sudden attention. “Of the message?”
“It’s for men,” Magnus noted innocently.
They moved on. “I think she’s more lonely than anything else,” John revealed, wondering how Sherlock would react to that. “It’s only the two of us, and considering you’re
“What?”
“Sherlock, don’t be rude, please,” John told him, the ‘please’ saying he meant business. It was one thing to be rude to people who could walk away from you; quite another to inflict it upon slaves at a market.

“Does it?”
If he could just
His mother stepped out onto the deck. “John, they seem to be a bit—excited,” she pointed out nervously.
Magnus sighed. “Alright, we will take this slowly,” he decided. “I don’t want you to have an emotional breakdown.”
Master was not intimidated by him and calmly stroked Aquamarine’s hair, trying to get him to kneel quietly instead of crawling around. “He kidnapped my slave, I followed them, I shot him,” Master summarized smoothly.
right there, or maybe Irene really thought she was a match for him. Could be very interesting.
The boy jerked his chin away. “Old enough to know what all their smirks and whispers meant,” he claimed, indicating Ivan’s men who had just left. His tone was defiant, but not disgusted.
“Yes, I can,” Mr. Holmes confirmed. It sounded slightly sinister. His eyes flickered dismissively over Molly and Irene—funny, most people’s gazes tended to linger on Irene—and landed on Aquamarine with a curious scrutiny. “This is the wildling I’ve heard so much about, hmm?” he commented. Aquamarine was not sure how the man would have heard about him, or what ‘much’ there was to hear. “Looks more like a pretty little pleasure slave to me.”
“Nothing,” John dismissed. “Irene, don’t bother him. Mrs. Hudson, is breakfast ready yet?”
Magnus looked pensive. “Mycroft will find out sooner or later,” he predicted, exasperated at this inevitability. “I wonder—“ He broke off and made eye contact with Bay. “Would you rather go to the country?” he asked. “Would you feel better there? More peace and quiet…”
Slowly he pivoted back around to face her and she gave him a pointed look. What kind of world had his new master dragged him into, he wondered futilely as he limped to the car door.
much. “This is an oak tree,” John explained to Aquamarine, who seemed very interested in its bark. He turned away momentarily as a neighbor started their mower, wondering if it would scare Aquamarine, and when he looked back the slave was shimmying up the tree.
They hit a pocket of turbulence and Magnus wobbled in his seat, muttering under his breath. A two-room transport with a bathroom, that
“We can’t just
not going to do it,” John denied. Immediately Aquamarine looked to the girls on the porch, who were just waiting for the signal to pay attention to him. “No,” John told him firmly. “You can learn to take them off and put them on yourself. The laces have been tied, see? Irene didn’t even make them very tight.” She’d been unable to see what she was doing at the time, after all. “And, keep them clean,” John added, as Aquamarine picked at the knots. “Don’t track dirt into the house.”
, after all. A movement caught his eye and he saw Master’s hand offering him an orange slice under the table. Aquamarine took it with his teeth, deliberately letting his lips brush Master’s fingers. It was different from the oranges he was used to—bigger, sweeter, but somehow also less flavorful.
wanted to know. “You, and my master, and Detective Inspector Lestrade”—he didn’t think it would hurt to imply that there was a police officer who was know to him—“all seem to think we’re old friends.” This was a bit cheeky; but the man didn’t seem concerned with that as he frowned deeply at Bay. Then he lifted his umbrella and jabbed Bay in the thigh.
Magnus huffed at him. “Don’t patronize me,” he snapped, and Bay decided he ought to sit back up. Was the confrontation finally coming? “You didn’t even try it. Try it and see.”
the slave preferred. And indeed, Magnus strode back into view and reached a hand towards him.
He told himself to stop thinking about that; he was in danger of vanishing in response, and he needed to keep his wits about him with a new master. Vanishing while walking might cause him to stop, or run into something, which would certainly draw his master’s ire.
John watched as the slave freed first one foot, then the other, from the shoes and socks. As soon as he’d done so Aquamarine flopped back on the ground, stretching his arms out with a whimper that suggested delicious freedom from imprisonment. John laughed a little, and his eye was caught by the bare skin exposed as Aquamarine’s shirt rode up above his jeans. The slave smirked when John’s gaze flicked up to his face and John rolled his eyes.
,” he insisted.
help?” Sherlock asked idly. “Alcoholic,” he judged, when John started to pause before a thirtyish woman.
The dark-haired man reached out a hand to him and he flinched, closing his eyes, his innate survival instincts not quite dead yet. Instead of a smack, though, he received a caress on the cheek. “Come on, open your eyes,” encouraged a voice, deep and rich and soothing.
There was a pause, and Bay felt a chill settle in his stomach. Was it going to be now, finally? “What? Why not?” Magnus questioned.
Aquamarine.
Magnus seemed dubious. “Well, get
“Thank you.”
“My collar,” Bay repeated, touching his neck to make sure it wasn’t there. “I think you took it at the market.”
solve it,” Magnus asserted confidently.
“Yes, I suppose there are certain similarities,” between Aquamarine and his mother’s little black Scottie. John cleared his throat again. “Er, I’ll be teaching him to blend in a little more,” he added. “Walking, using the furniture, that sort of thing. Crawling through the streets of London not really being encouraged.”
Master knelt to restrain him better. “This is Detective Inspector Lestrade,” he told Aquamarine. “He’s a friend. Give him your hand to smell.”
“Thank you.”
it, though.
There was a movement outside in the hall, then the bells jangled as someone burst in and started speaking. His master tensed beneath him in surprise and Aquamarine tensed in response, turning on the intruder with a snarl. Female, collared, impractical black lacy dress, no weapons, aggressive, froze when he growled at her.
The woman scooted over to let him sit and as soon as the door was closed they were whisked away. The interior was spacious, luxurious; the woman well-dressed, nice nails, tapping on a smartphone authoritatively. “What’s your name?” Bay asked her. There were certain liberties that were supposed to be permitted slaves, when their owners weren’t around.
Lestrade was asking about the Cardiff connection—Magnus pretended he thought it ought to be obvious, when he knew very well that it wasn’t. “Dear G-d, what is it like in your funny little brains?” he asked, glancing between Bay and Lestrade. “It must be so boring.” Well, modesty rarely accompanied genius.
Obviously he was interrupting Magnus’s text conversation and the man started to walk away, into the other cabin. “No. Forget about it. We’ll get one later.”
Another tapestry stretched across the entirety of one side of the room, hung on a curtain rod. When Bilbo felt he was ready, and he’d smoothed the bed covers back out and wiped up every bit of spilled water in the bathroom (with thick, soft towels, of course), he pulled the curtain back.
The dragon growled a little, which did not necessarily indicate anger. “My adventures are all alike,” he complained. “Attack, people run screaming, burn everything, take what I want.”
“Well, that’s the thing with wildlings,” Master claimed, “if you treat them properly.”
“She’s
He took his time in the loo, not just doing his business but also washing his hands and face, sipping his drink, examining his face in the mirror. The one eye looked bad, but he’d had worse. He felt back into his hair, trying to find what had intrigued Magnus, but it seemed the usual collection of bumps and scars to him.
, he tried to convey. Only bad people. “He was defending me,” Master went on. “So well done.” Aquamarine spun back around and barked in acknowledgement. “He can look after you two.”
“No? Where did Leonid find you, with Alessio?” Ivan guessed.
“Bay.”
Molly scooted between his legs, probing a tender area, and he couldn’t help but cry out, even as he fought, now, to keep himself still. Tears blurred his eyes as he tried to focus on his master—open face, tanned, red-and-white checked headdress like the locals wore, deep blue eyes. “Shh, shh, it’s okay,” he soothed, and he seemed utterly genuine, which was somehow more confusing. “What’s your name? Tell me your name. If you don’t I’ll give you one.” He shook his head, body tense with the effort of not knocking Molly away. He didn’t have a name, not anything he cared about anyway. “Alright then.” His master stared at him pensively. “Aquamarine,” he decided. Bit of a mouthful, really. “You have such beautiful blue eyes—“ They squeezed shut.
,” Master added firmly, glancing between the two of them, “you’re not to touch either of them until I say so. Is that clear, Aquamarine?” He turned his eyes easily from Irene to Master and nodded. “Irene?”
Magnus was quiet for a moment. “The loo’s over there, if you want to use it,” he mentioned, and Bay pushed himself up to take advantage of the offer. “I’m not interested in micromanaging your biological functions,” Magnus went on as Bay limped down the corridor. “If you need to use the loo, or eat or whatever, just do so.”
fair-skinned.” She tried to touch his face and he snapped at her, just a little.
“When we get back to the tent,” Master told them, raising his voice over the wind, “start packing. We’re going home tonight.”
“Are we talking religion here?” Bay questioned neutrally.
get expensive. But John had money. It would be ridiculous if he had magic to heal injuries and travel thousands of miles in moments, but not magic to buy things. And clearly this magic thing operated on sensible rules like that. He noticed his mother didn’t refuse the money he put in her account each month.
On the desk he found a luggage label with a phone number. “Jennifer Wilson?” he checked. The desk was rather a mess. “Wasn’t that the dead woman?”
. Pictures and dishes and counters and cabinets and machines and food and books and strangers (one, anyway) and lights and smells and—Something hissed near him, threateningly, and Aquamarine howled and dove under the table, scattering the empty chairs and pulling Master’s jacket over his head.
tempting, but his survival instincts held on a little longer, fingernails on the ledge. “Okay,” Magnus agreed simply, sitting back. “Well, why don’t we just get on with our parts in this world?”
Sherlock seemed unusually interested in the bold woman, looking her up and down even as she did the same to him. “Er, I’m looking for a domestic,” John said, turning away from Sherlock. “Which one is Molly?”
it reduced, wanted everyone to know what he would do for his master. So
Master was coming. Master would help him. Aquamarine stopped screaming and dropped to the ground, wrapping his arms around his legs and burying his face against his knees, trying to blot out this new world that made so little sense. Maybe it was just a hallucination. Maybe he was sick, injured, finally losing his mind.
Bay didn’t actually need to ‘try’ his leg to know it still hurt, but since he was sitting up anyway, it was tried. He didn’t bother to hide the twinge of pain.
Bay felt something rising within him, something angry and scary. “You don’t have a collar for me to wear?”
him to kneel, Aquamarine understood perfectly well. And usually he obeyed.
“Oh, I suppose. Smelly is bad,” Magnus warned, and Bilbo nodded. “Rather dull, though.”
“Do you play music?” Ivan asked suddenly, startling the boy. He had long, slender fingers, just right for plucking strings.
“Mine are the same,” Bilbo deadpanned, “except without the first three, and largely unsuccessful.” Magnus gave him an expectant look. “When I first left the Shire,” he finally began, with some reluctance, “I went to Bree, to an inn called the Prancing Pony. Do you know it?” He did not. “The innkeeper said I wouldn’t be much use to him, but since I’d already eaten three meals with no money to pay for them”—Magnus chuckled—”he had to do something with me, so he set me to picking pockets. Not of
“What am I supposed to remember?” Bay demanded, too frustrated to be cautious. “You talk like we know each other, but I know we’ve never met. If it was just you I’d think you were mad”—Magnus smirked a little, faintly—“but at least three other people have acted the same way and I just don’t…” He trailed off hopelessly. “Did you—did you own me before, and I was injured and lost those memories?” he guessed desperately. He could see this was incorrect. “Or we met—at uni or—” It didn’t make

“Oughtn’t even let
His master sat on the floor, leaning against a chair back and manipulating… something… on his lap. Part was buttons he pushed and part was something he stared at that glowed. When he looked up and saw—Aquamarine, he was Aquamarine now—he folded it up and tucked it safely away in a box. “Aquamarine. Come in. Feeling better?” He wore no headdress now; his hair was blond. His boots and trousers were Western style, military influence. His furnishings were like Molly’s but more numerous, better. Weapons, ceremonial. Books. Aquamarine’s eyes lingered on them. “Look around. Do you want—“ He started to rise and Aquamarine froze warily, so his master froze as well, then sat back down. “Alright, I’ll stay here, and you come in.”
“Bye.” Bay maneuvered himself out of the car and watched it drive away before he limped up to the door, which was labeled 221B. It seemed like a nice neighborhood, though Magnus’s luxury transport would stand out; the sandwich shop would be convenient for meals, if his master allowed it. After surveying the area around him Bay gave the door a determined stare and rang the bell.
It had to be an onerous task the lad had been set to—bloody, dirty, and Ivan imagined he didn’t smell too great either—but Nico concentrated on it single-mindedly. It would be the best-tended wound in the kingdom, Ivan was sure of it.
mean to be kind. No, squash that thought right away. Perhaps he was just someone who took care of his possessions, the things he had bought and paid for. Though evidence of his general carelessness suggested the opposite. Kindness was too much to hope for, though. Kindness was another planet.
“I think it’s in my file as well,” Bay noted, which Magnus would’ve had ample time to study.
it’s for men!” Anderson huffed. “
“—I think she can have another person to talk to if she wants,” John concluded. He stopped before a large cage holding three young people, two women and a man. One woman leaned on the bars, boldly making eye contact with people passing by, while the other two sat on the floor next to each other, gazes dropping when John looked at them.
The man nodded with interest and actually made eye contact with Bay. “Oh, nice. What do you call him?”
Magnus clearly hadn’t thought of this. “Yes, an alibi, how novel!” he commented, turning the case sideways to examine the corners. Bay could see how some people—Donovan, for example—might like to assume Magnus was the murderer. Suddenly he stopped messing with the case and turned to stare at Bay owlishly. “You may sit,” he allowed, indicating the other armchair. Magnus was crouched rather precariously on the one Bay had been using before.
Memories: Master, killing, pleasure, Mycroft Holmes, home. Were they to start on their journey home now? Was a thunderstorm approaching? Why was the tent so silent? Where was Master?
“Did I just text a murderer?” Bay sputtered, a chill going down his back. Naturally Magnus wouldn’t think twice about doing something like that.
“Well, yes.” As if any other kind of skull would just be silly. “He was a friend of mine. Well, not really,” Magnus added after a moment’s reflection. “So, come on.”
He was very conscious of his status as a slave whose master was not nearby. “Oh, yes, I’m to meet him at home,” he lied easily. “Ma’am.” He looked around, trying to get his bearings before he started walking.
“You’re very loyal, very quickly,” the man observed from behind him. Bay decided he couldn’t rely on him for a ride and pointed himself in the direction of the warehouse exit, which seemed a very long way away. “You’ve had little reason to trust anyone in your life, John Watson.” The use of his real name made him slow for a moment, but then he kept going. “Can it be that you’ve decided to trust Magnus Holmes, of all people? Despite your lack of memory? How interesting.” He quite liked the sound of his own voice, apparently. Well, the warehouse did give it a nice echo effect.
Bay sighed. “Sorry, was I here before?” he inquired, not very hopeful of getting a straight answer. “Everyone seems to think they know me already, but I just don’t remember—”
Magnus didn’t speak again until he’d let Bilbo off in his room, which was only another couple of steps for him. “I meant more generally,” the dragon persisted, as Bilbo started to gather up his clothes. There was a large woven basket with a rope handle in his closet, which Magnus favored for transport. “You know, I’m not going to hurt you. I’ve already said so.”
Magnus ducked his head and Bilbo slid to the ground—he mostly landed on his feet now—then the dragon settled down to stare at Bilbo while he ate. How the food was prepared and conveyed to the table, Bilbo didn’t know; Magnus dismissed his question with “dragon magic.” Same about where the fresh ingredients in the kitchen came from. Dragon magic was only extended for breakfast and supper; other meals and snacks Bilbo prepared himself in the great kitchens. Magnus spent a great deal of time sleeping buried beneath the gold, and liked to stick to his routine.
“Should I be?”
Bay considered it. “No, I shouldn’t think so.” Magnus clearly wanted him to come; so, Bay would do whatever he needed to for himself, to limit the trauma. He didn’t
“I’m not sure where you’re going to sleep tonight,” John commented idly, since his thoughts had apparently strayed in that direction. Aquamarine propped himself up on his elbows, frowning. “There’s only three bedrooms,” John went on. “My mum’s and mine, and the girls share the third one—” Aquamarine went from stretched-out and relaxed to curled up in a moment. “What’s wrong?” John asked him suddenly, reaching for him. “Are you hurt? Did you hit your head when you fell?” His fingers slid delicately into Aquamarine’s hair, gently probing for any bumps.
He said those words with a touch of dismay. The country would not offer enough activity for him. “Whatever you would prefer,” Bay remarked, and Magnus rolled his eyes.
This was ignored as Magnus dangled a tag before him victoriously. Actually it was a business card with a hole jabbed in it, through which was threaded a piece of string. “
Aquamarine edged into the tent, scooting around its edges, never turning his back on his master but taking quick, darting glances around the room. Wealthy Westerner, military and medical background but traveling independently, sensible, not planning to stay long, respectful of local cultures. Aquamarine did not think he seemed like a cruel man. But he had been wrong before.
how it worked, so it seemed like magic to him, and he found that explanation sufficient. But his words suggested a more logical mechanism might be behind it, and if anyone could untangle it and enlighten the rest of them, it would be Aquamarine. He accepted the challenge.
She gave him a fond smile. “That’s right, dear. He said you wouldn’t remember. It’ll be so nice to have you back, he can be such a pill on his own,” she added conspiratorially.
In fact, he grinned manically as Bay realized this. “Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe the murderer took it from her for some reason,” Magnus speculated. So she couldn’t call for help, was Bay’s grim guess. “Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.”
Magnus was affronted by this judgment, however, and pointed accusingly at the victim’s left hand. “Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least,” he described. “The rest of her jewelry has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there,” he opined harshly. “The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside—that means it’s regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It’s not for work—look at her nails. She doesn’t work with her hands, so what or rather who
John threaded his fingers through his dark curls and kissed his temple. “Well, it’s magic,” he answered. “I know you don’t like that,” he added quickly, as Aquamarine snarled against his shoulder. “But that’s how we got here. Like how Molly healed your injuries.”
“Mr. Holmes.” The window on the SUV was rolled up almost before Master finished speaking and the vehicle roared away.
“If someone bothers you, come tell me about it,” he added, ignoring Irene’s comment. “Take off your trousers, please.”
Was it a trap? Everything was a trap. He opened his eyes anyway, or one; the other was swollen shut. The man was kneeling in the dirt now, careless of his expensive suit the way people were who could afford more. “That’s it,” he coaxed, opening the good eye a little wider with gentle fingers. His hands were huge. “Lovely shade of blue,” he murmured, half to himself. “Think I’ll call you Bay. What do you think of that?” There was a curious smirk on his full lips, like he was telling an inside joke.
matter. I shouldn’t have left you behind.”
“Yes, where is it?” Magnus wanted to know, looking around. “She must have had a phone or an organizer. Find out who Rachel is.”
“You can put these on when you’re done,” Ivan allowed, tossing him some sleeping clothes.
This had the opposite effect of what he’d wanted, snapping John out of his daydream. “No, Baker Street is fine,” he said, determined not to be sidetracked further. “We’re going to buy Mrs. Hudson some domestic help and then get out of here. Back to the country,” he specified, just in case.
Self: stiff, clean, clothed, fed and watered adequately, no bandages, no pain, mind clear. Leather collar around his neck, new, slightly rigid.
A large black car was rolling slowly along beside the walk, too slowly, and now it turned sharply to cut Bay off as he tried to cross the street. The back window rolled down to reveal an attractive young woman, who at second glance was wearing a necklace-like jeweled slave collar. This did not give him comfort. “Get in,” she told him.
A high-pitched whine, coupled with a growl of frustration. Aquamarine was not scared for his safety. He was terribly frustrated, even angry, about his inability to understand. “
“Pffft,” interrupted the dragon, which was a rather more intimidating sound coming from a dragon. “Clean later while I take my nap. Are you ready for breakfast?”
The transport set down somewhere—the windows in this cabin were all polarized and Bay couldn’t see where they were. But Magnus opened the door without hesitation and bounded off, pausing only to grab a long, dark coat. Bay supposed he would have to make do with his jumper.
“Oh.” He could tell Bilbo was irritated at him, a rather daring position for Bilbo to take all things considered, and he didn’t like it. “I found some interesting things in the northwest corner,” Magnus tempted. “I thought you might like to explore there today.”
Bay let his mind wander as they drove—not vanishing entirely, just going over everything that had happened to him in the last few hours. It was more than usually happened to him. Donovan, Anderson, this unnamed man were all his master’s enemies; Lestrade might be more of a friend. Not a great ratio there. On the other hand, who told a slave their new master was a psychopath? Who offered a slave money to, presumably, spy on their master? Well, alright, people
He was just about to risk poking around in the small kitchen—his master clearly didn’t want to be disturbed—when Magnus spoke again. “The murderer took her suitcase. First big mistake.”
“Oh, I’m alright.” Neglect was often better than attention, honestly.
“Here, have a drink,” his master offered, pouring a cup of tea. He held out the cup and Aquamarine stared at it, then him. Then his master set the cup on the ground, leaning over slightly to put it just beyond arm’s reach.
“These words exactly,” Magnus instructed. “What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.” Bay started typing. “Twenty-two Northumberland Street. Please come.”
something, and took a few steps closer to him.
Nico shrugged a little, finally freeing one foot. Ivan sighed, allowing a tinge of the mortal pain to seep through to ground him. Sometimes he truly admired people, for all they accomplished despite the pain they
Aquamarine froze in the middle of sucking olive juice off his fingers. Irene seemed equally apprehensive about the order, which was an unexpected mood for her. Apparently she preferred her dangerous toys to be unarmed, at least.
Magnus rose, and Bay braced himself for a well-earned blow. Instead his master caressed his cheek gently. “Perhaps you’re right,” he allowed. There was a slight quirking of his lips into a sad smile. “Perhaps you’re not ready for that yet.” Bay did not know what else to do but nod, eyes downcast. He thought he’d gone past the ability to feel despair long ago, but somehow this new master revived it in him—kind acts, mad talk, dangling the things Bay wanted most in front of him, even though he knew they were impossible. One day at a time, he repeated to himself—his old mantra.
,” Bay read from the card. His mobile number was included as well.
Aquamarine scooted his feet forward an inch or so. “Don’t shuffle,” John advised him. “Pick your feet up all the way.” Aquamarine lifted one foot far higher than necessary and put it down, then did the same with the other. John pulled Irene’s face against his shoulder to muffle her derisive giggle, but Aquamarine heard it anyway and glared at her. “No, you’re doing well,” John assured him. “You just need some practice. Walk around a bit more.”
They were stopped at the yellow tape by an official-looking woman, whose expression contained nothing but displeasure. “Hello, freak,” she said to Magnus acidly, and Bay’s eyebrows rose fractionally in surprise at the disrespect.
Bilbo automatically glanced up at the ceiling, hazy in the distance, wondering if a dragon kick could bring the whole place down on them. “I hope you didn’t hurt yourself.”
