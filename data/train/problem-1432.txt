“I do regret some things,” Mycroft said from behind him, his slender fingers adjusting the silk tie he wore. “But I believe coming here was the best thing that could have happened to me.” The statement seemed loaded with so much meaning that the blonde was hesitant to keep prodding. For most of their lives they had been unable to talk about this issue. John due to his ignorance about his friend’s true identity, and his advisor, for fear that the revelation would erase any camaraderie and trust they had built over the cycles, ending with a probable time spent in jail if the luck gods were in his favour. The other felt he could not really blame him for thinking that way; they
Hudson stood next to them, apparently to offer her support should they need it, fact that was not to go unnoticed by the villains. “Lady Hudson!” Jim exclaimed, turning away his attention from Sherlock for a moment. “What a pleasure! Long time no see.” The voice booming through the speakers seemed to suck the air out of the whole room; Sherlock wondered what it said about him the fact that that which he admired once, now he found slightly disconcerting. He chose not to dwell on how far he had fallen.
“Sherlock, I know this is quick but I already told you what I feel,” He continued, his expressive blue gaze softening at finding his own even after the sulk, and the argument, and Sherlock just being his weird and troublesome self. “Do you feel the same way for me?”
The silver artefact in Jim’s hand grew heavy, and for a moment nothing happened. But after a few seconds the wand started pulling at him the tiniest bit; trembling with the force between the both of them. Sherlock was clearly burning himself out, desperate to make the spell work, and James laughed delighted at the feeble attempt to take something from him. Then, something shifted, and the rebel opened his eyes as if in revelation, and in that exact moment, Moriarty’s fingers tried unsuccessfully to secure it; but the wand had already gone flying out of his grasp, and landed in the possession of a very surprised Sherlock.
our parents.” John heard himself answer. Perhaps more ominously than he had intended, but the truth was that he wasn’t entirely certain what he was about to do would work, and this wasn’t the time for empty platitudes. With
“A pleasure doing business with you.” She said; her blood-red lips smirked up and she turned away from sight of the fencing team.
“Emotional context.” Eurus jumped in, grinning in encouragement as her ocean eyes pierced through his form. “It was like love, Sherlock.” She explained, making the other take a slight step back, distancing himself from the horror. “Can you believe it?” The crowd around them was deadly quiet as she conveyed her improbable enthusiasm. “I finally feel
He said, and strode out of the room. Yelling to the two trailing miscreants at his back. “Irene, bring the mirror!”
The older man turned to look at Irene in question, as if to find out what had him so riled up. “He completely struck out.” She explained, crossing her legs and leaning back on the love-seat she had invaded. “He’s been going over every page in that book for hours.” She complained. “I placed one of my crown circlets on his head earlier and he hasn’t even noticed.” She gestured, to which the other moved his head taken aback, only to watch as a silver ring of metal dropped from his curls to the floor dully.
“You sure I can’t see you before that?” The other asked, making a harmless face and acting for all the world as a parent missing his kid, the three teenagers fought the urge to spit at them. “I don’t know what I will do if I don’t get my hands on that mag-” He stopped himself, realising mid-sentence that letting greed hinder the slim chances they had was not a good risk to take; no matter how impatient he was for it to be true. “On you,” He corrected swiftly, acting as if the mishap had never happened. “You whom I love like a son.”
“It’s okay.” The girl muttered, and struggled to gather the papers she had dropped in nervousness. Anxiously attempting to get out of the room before she could embarrass herself further. “Don’t mind me.”
Sherlock sighed. “You know what that is.” He said, fractured glass shattering inside his chest. “I packed it last minute,” His hasty words sounded like blatant lies even to his own ears, digging him even further inside the hole. “As a precaution, in case it rained or-”
He stuttered. “To- uh- her,” The lines were breaking. Sherlock turned to watch Irene and Greg, their shocked expressions staring back at him as the former king and queen took several steps backwards. Eurus encouragingly nodded her head and clutched the blonde’s hand in a tight grip. “I’m bringing down the barrier once and for all.” John concluded, sending the royal party into panic. His father looked furious and the warriors of light exchanged affronted stares. “Lady Hudson,” The blonde said, turning to address his godmother, opening and closing one of his fist in what seemed more like nervousness than brutality. “Break down the dome.” He ordered.
The kid was his age, yet as he spoke that, he seemed several sun-cycles older, —the fact the he towered over John, just like almost everyone else did, didn’t help either— John stayed seated on that bench long after his new teammate had gone off to shower and most of the other kids had left the building. He vowed he would make sure things were different for them there.
The silver-gazed took a step back and lightly bowed to her in gratitude for her loyalty. To which she responded in rushing to him and crushing him in a big hug. All of his others friends didn’t do this, but Sherlock supposed he could tolerate it from her for a few moments, he
“Sherlock,” He commented, making most of the other’s anger drain almost instantly; leaving only the wounded expression of his mercurial eyes under the purple fringe at being disregarded by his brother in such a way.
The little boy seemed to notice the silence that had befell Sherlock, and in turn just stared at another article from the box. Irene sighed and reached for a random piece to present to Archie. “And what about this one?” She said, turning the boy’s attention away from the tension and focusing him on retelling the story of how he had acquired that particular note. Irene smile and listened, ignoring the grateful expression over Sherlock’s face, as his eyes weren’t able to leave the photograph.
“Of course I will!” They younger man accepted into the mic, only to fear for his hearing abilities for the second time that afternoon after the uproar it caused.
enlightening.” The waves around them diminished their intensity, and she floated comfortably at the middle of the vast ocean. “I want to see how you react to
Greg supposed there was nothing more to do than to go down with it. “Yes.” He replied, even if he knew how absurd it sounded even to his own ears. The boy smiled encouragingly, hoping she would buy it. He struggled to not draw attention to the backpack, and risk her asking questions about that too. If anybody else caught wind of this, John’s life could be in serious danger.
“You were always a bit clever.” Was the answer the girl gave him. “But Sherlock…” She replied to the oldest sibling, but her gaze never left the boy. “He’s slow, but
Irene was eyeing him expectantly, clearly anticipating Sherlock to bristle at that; everyone knew he hated when people somehow implied his heritage meant he had not really gained his machiavellian reputation on his own, when, in reality, those who witnessed him closely knew that if anything, the fact that his mother had been the The Mistress of Evil seemed to hinder his villainous carrier more than help it. But the boy —true to form— did the unexpected and laughed. That half-hearted chuckle of amusement he sometimes made when something had clearly went exactly the way he wanted.
John snatched it back and grimaced. “I’m trying my best-” He said, but Lestrade shook his head as if he weren’t impressed with his efforts. The royal turned hopeful blue eyes to Irene as he followed her into another alley and tried to copy her exact movements.
young man.” She said as Greg rolled his eyes and pulled out an incredible number of things —presumably stolen— from his bag and proceeded to throw them carelessly back in the car.
“A game?” Sebastian chose the moment to speak up. “I feel like we’re in tot-school again.” He commented, a hint of mock in his tone. Everyone stopped and Victor stared at him in warning, but the other didn’t seem to heed the ginger arched eyebrow, instead marched on as he chuckled. “Are you also going to let him call you shri-” At that moment Victor grabbed him by the shoulders and began dragging him away; Seb just then realising his mistake.
He made sure his collar was up and took some steps to stand right where the ginger had vacated, looking out to the festivities. Perhaps he should worry about ambiance and decorations —he was sure Molly would have found a way to sneak in a few of her very cheesy ideas— but the thought never even crossed his mind as he stared at some of the people with expectant faces. He could see Irene’s proud face, and Greg smiling at the left with Molly practically hanging off his arm in excitement. He hesitated in the next step, until his brother leaned in and whispered, “Time to
After that, the crowd dissipated. Going to find shelter and peace after the horrors they had faced that day. John and Sherlock had chosen to stay behind, leaning over the railing and contemplating over the horizon.
“Auradon?” He asked sarcastically; he had had quite enough of the realm and its philosophy for the day. Turning back to his Spell Book and letting Irene deal with their unwanted guest.
The machiavellian dynasty was gruesomely executed and the vagabonds and never-do-wells were left in the perpetual state of betrayal and crime against each other until their old ways seemed blurred. Constantly switching back and forth between keeping The Isle going and actually living and thriving on chaos. No magic. No wifi. No way out.
“I think you should find the missing part of your dress, Irene.” He commented, gesturing to the exposed part of her legs with a smirk. The girl just rolled her eyes at him in annoyance and the boy chuckled.
What was your favourite moment of the chapter? And why do you believe Sherlock will do to solve his conflict?
However, none of them expected the girl to reach out her hand and dip her finger in the mix, only to return it to her mouth and consuming what was to become their weapon of attack. “No!” The three rebels screamed in unison, worried at the implications a half completed potion could deliver.
Janine seemed to be sold on his mischievous nature as well. At least not everything was doomed to be boring here, if anything else failed, Auradon looked like it could be a perfect place to stir up trouble. “Mr. Holmes.” She started. “You’re going to be incredibly useful.” Janine swore and smiled.
“You know,” He starts, motioning to the inside of the boy’s locker. Sherlock’s grey eyes pierced through his in intensity, as if he were trying to figure something out. “The labs are open from 7 in the morning to 11 pm, you should really think about returning those beakers where they belong and just experiment there,” John commented. “What do you say?”
Greg waited a few seconds, unsure on how to break the tense atmosphere lingering over both their forms. “What happens if it doesn’t work and she gets the wand?” He asked in an impulse. Pressing his lips immediately after as if to keep any other treacherous words trapped inside his mouth.
“Yes, dear.” She responded while the other frantically turned the pages of the Spell Book, but in an opposite manner than earlier. This time it was with an objective in mind.
horror.” She paused, a broken sigh escaping her lips as if disappointed “You shouldn’t have let me into the water.” With that, she dived into the tide once more, leaving all on deck desperately awaiting for her deliverance.
“You think?” The other snarled, lashing out after the gradually worse days he had been having for the past weeks. “We need to be sure.” He explained, reminding the others of a venomous animal desperate to grab any prey he could. “This is difficult, one tiny slip and it all could go down in flames.” And knowing Moriarty it definitely would. “We cannot afford any mistakes.” He concluded, breathing heavily from his exaltation.
“She’s an angry girl with a bad plan.” The other replied, the yellow dust over the left side of his face accentuating the frown over his brow. “That’s not so different from when you first came to Auradon.”
laughed. “You are a cheeky one, aren’t you?” She asked but the silver eyes of the boy then moved to look at him, sparkling in the summer sun, not really paying any attention to the princess at all anymore.
“No, he doesn’t.” Sherlock assured. “Oh, John,” He continued, slowly taking a small step closer to him. “The bravest, wisest, most loyal man I’ve ever known:” The raw emotion was impossible to tear away from Sherlock’s words, so he let it play out instead. “You can be
clouded over by the trepidation inside his chest. His fingers clutched the edge of the picture so tightly he was half afraid he would later have to explain the wrinkles to Archie. His silver eyes fixed on John’s handsome face; unable to tear his gaze away even when he felt Irene’s assessing sight trained on him.
you.” His insistence was completely justified, the royal often spent far too much time worrying on whether he could one day be a good and empathic king, yet Sherlock refused to sympathise with someone who had meant to harm him just to gain leverage.
a date; you’re easy, honey.” She smiled and watched as Janine’s hopeful expression turned excited. The rebel sighed slightly, “Besides, I was lucky enough to be given a chance, and I have to make the most of it.” Sherlock, and Archie, and all of the kids trapped in the Island very present in the front of her mind.
evil.” The joke was not even that funny, yet John let out a roaring laugh as if he were something special. The violet-haired found not even that was able to draw the smile off his face completely, if anything the ridiculousness of the situation just managed to heighten his mood.
Just as she was about to berate them once more to pay attention, a petite figure entered the classroom quickly and as quietly as was possible for any human to walk. She was of small stature, brown eyes and walked with her brunette-topped head down, as if trying to draw the least amount of attention to herself that she could. Walking with short, yet swift steps towards Lady Hudson and shuffling her frankly atrociously clad feet as she waited for the older woman to notice her.
Irene and Greg were being summoned by one of the helpers and Sherlock took a deep breath in relief, maybe not being the only new one would give him a sense of stability. “How about a game of Melee before dessert is served?” His dad offered, and the blonde boy grinned at his boyfriend’s surprised face, as if he were not anticipating being invited to participate in any activity with someone who, by all means, did hold a level of animosity towards him, if only indirectly. “Of course,” He had assented, but then his expression became a tad panicked.
“I know that silence.” Sherlock shook his head and tilted his head sideways. “What?” He said, his mercurial eyes squinting as he scanned Mycroft’s stance.
With Sherlock’s prompting gaze, Molly shook off the bewilderment and said. “Yeah?” She asked, and gave no time for him to answer before she was already eagerly assured, all prior thoughts and doubts forgotten. “You won’t regret it.”
“Yes, oh!” She agreed, touching up her lips now that they were looking at a mirror. “I’m starting to feel like we didn’t need the love spell at all.” She commented casually, yet the tone in which she said it was loaded with meaning. Sherlock disagreed with half of that statement, but found he was becoming quite aware of the brutal veracity of it.
Sherlock knew what their faces must tell at the moment, how not one of them had experienced something even remotely akin to what she just described in all their life. Irene and Greg’s single parents were hardly attentive, and cared for their offspring more as an asset to obtain their desires than actual children, and Sherlock didn’t even have a family to speak of; just a maniac with a power-complex for a guardian and a lost brother that nobody had seen for more than thirteen cycles. —not that his mother had been even the least affectionate when she was alive. He doubted anyone on the island got to live as they did on Auradon. Everything there was business transactions and violent reluctant deals. No time, nor use, for anything else.
Now, he would always wonder what life would be like if he actually had spoken up. Would John have moved back to Baker Street? Would they have gotten the life they shared together back?
Rosie tugged on one of Sherlock’s unruly curls, and he absentmindedly batted her hand away. “I’ve been with you for nearly every moment of every day for three weeks. You don’t have a something.”
“Don’t go,” said John, his eyes fierce. “Not just because of tonight but because – Sherlock, I need you to be safe.”
Again, the surge of happiness, though John fails to see what makes Penny stand out from the other millions of babies in the world. At least, he doesn’t understand why
couldn’t be kept out of his voice. John glanced at him and gave a curt nod. Molly tugged on his sleeve, and he finally allowed himself to leave.
John swallowed. His right shoulder ached dully, and he longed to rub it, but there was nothing in this world that could make him move his hand at that moment.
but he didn’t want to ruin the happy mood they had going with something that John might not be ready to fully consider. It was something they could discuss later, after John was completely healed. Instead, he just served John his breakfast and said, “I appreciate you telling me. It makes me very happy.”
Once in the doorway, he pauses and looks back. Sherlock is already sitting at the table, pretending to look focused on the papers in front of him. But John can see that his eyes don’t have that sharpness that indicates he’s concentrating, and his whole body is looser than normal.
Of course, by not asking Sherlock to stay, John was presented with his conundrum. Having an extra set of hands would’ve been ideal, but he didn’t have them.
“I wanted to surprise you both,” John said. “Mycroft helped me organize everything. He says I’m to tell you you owe him a favor. I don’t really think you do.”
“So,” John said, breaking him out of his thoughts. “Are we really going to the park? Because if we go, I don’t want to hear a single complaint from you.”
“Do you want me to go?” The words could’ve come out timid, but they were remarkably strong, despite the burning in his eyes. He didn’t look away from John, so he saw the way John flinched before looking at him.
The mere memory still gave him a sense of nausea. Heights had never bothered Sherlock, but that day, standing atop Barts, left him desperately wishing for solid ground.
John couldn’t stand it anymore. He yanked Sherlock forward and kissed him with all the energy he could muster. Sherlock didn’t hesitate to kiss back, his free hand finding John’s neck and curling itself around it. It was sloppy because of exhaustion and desperation, but it was wonderful. Sherlock’s lips were soft and warm, and John wanted to drown in them.
Sherlock’s eyes shine, and John can’t tell if it’s the lamplight or something else. He pries one of his hands from John’s and tentatively touches his cheek. John leans into it, comforted by its warmth.
Sherlock was busy Googling different parenting sites for advice. “I believe it depends on the child. There can’t just be a set age where children are supposed to be problematic.”
Only he couldn’t. This was Sherlock’s area of expertise. Not to say John couldn’t usually come up with his own rescue plan, but he could hardly think past the crippling fear he felt for his daughter and the sadness he felt about Sherlock and the
Once Penny is safely in John’s arms, Sherlock turns away, moving to the cluttered table. The warmth in John’s chest is quickly fading, the moment slipping away faster than he can process. Desperation wells up within him, the need to keep this precious moment alive nearly consuming him. Sherlock sits at the table and starts rifling through his papers. It’s clear he expects John to leave, and might even
“Your sister is one of the campers, right?” Greg Lestrade asked him as they unpacked their things in the counselors’ cabin. John stilled in the process of putting his sheets on his bed.
John was trying so hard to be mad, but instead he was just impossibly happy. He still smacked Sherlock’s chest with his free hand.
“I’ve asked Sherlock to move in while I recover,” he said. “Which was a colossally bad idea because we still can’t figure out how to act around each other.”
Almost against his will, John’s fingers tightened over Sherlock’s. He could have sworn he heard Sherlock gasp, but it was nearly drowned out by the rain.
John pressed his lips together, as if suppressing a smile. Why he would be smiling in that moment, Sherlock didn’t know. “Mucus, Sherlock. It’s a part of getting sick. Again, not a big issue. I’ve got a humidifier we can set up in here for her, and there are some drops we can get for her nose.”
Molly worried her lower lip with her teeth. John knew she was thinking the same things he was, that Sherlock was most likely in a great deal of danger and might even be dead. Wordlessly, he reached over and took her hand.
He moved around the chair and knelt before her. His thumb caught the first tear to slip out, and Rosie’s chin wobbled as she tried to hold the rest in. He deftly took the photo album from her and set it aside.
It wasn’t until they moved into the sitting room and got Rosie set up with her toys that John finally seemed ready to talk. Sherlock wasn’t surprised – John needed food in the morning before he could properly approach anything that might require heavy emotions or serious brainpower. Sherlock used to find it exhausting. In this instance, it was a comforting. It gave Sherlock time to compose himself.
“I can do ‘periments with you!” she crowed. Sherlock smiled. The chemistry set had been his idea, and clearly it was a good one.
Despite his desperation, John didn’t get the opportunity to call Greg until the following night. Sherlock had proposed another day at the park, and even though John believed Sherlock should be resting because of his wound, he allowed it. He suspected that Sherlock suggested it because he was growing depressed at the thought of leaving the Watson home. The thought both saddened and pleased John. He hated anything that made Sherlock upset, but it was a little gratifying to know that Sherlock didn’t want to leave them.
“People tend to think,” John said slowly, “that I’m just another poor sod who stumbles through school, gets drunk on the weekends, and has every girl begging me to shag them.”
John stayed with Sherlock until it was time for lunch. Sherlock suspected the counselor would’ve sat with him if given the opportunity, but Sherlock snuck out of the dining hall when John wasn’t looking and went back to his cabin.
Unable to stand it for any longer, Sherlock pulled John in close and kissed him. In response, John reached up to grasp his face, like he wanted to keep Sherlock right where he was.
There was silence on the other end as Molly processed it. John waited patiently, taking deep breaths in order to steady himself.
A glimmer of a smile started on Sherlock’s face before it disappeared. He drew the blankets back up to his chin, his hands trembling.
He was disappointed, yes, and more than a little heartbroken. By this point, he thought they would be past all the drama and hurt. His love for Sherlock, still so new, left him choked up. And under it all, there was still a sense of desperation that he had to finalize things between them
“Fine,” John snaps. “Just forget about it. About all of it.” He walks back to the baby monitor and picks it up. It’s still blessedly silent, though he supposes it doesn’t matter whether or not Penny wakes up. He doubts he’ll be getting much sleep tonight.
John finally turned to face him. Sherlock twined his hands together, willing their shakiness to subside. His stomach felt just as knotted as they were. The words coming from his mouth felt foreign in nature, but not unwelcome.
“I think she wants you,” murmured Sherlock. Without waiting for John to acknowledge him, he shifted and transferred Rosie over to John’s uninjured side. John circled his left arm around her, forming a protective barrier. She nestled against his chest, momentarily content once more.
“She doesn’t know many people,” Sherlock replied, gently bouncing her. She kicked her legs out, and he set her back down immediately. She took off like a shot, running around with the kind of exuberance only a child could possess.
Pink spots appeared on Sherlock’s cheeks, and he ducked his head. John didn’t take his eyes off him, silently willing him to agree.
“They still haunt you.” He didn’t phrase it like a question because he didn’t need to. He already knew.
“It’s amazing, though.” John picked up his tea again and stared into it. “How you are with her. I know that if anything ever happened to me, she would be in good hands.”
“Because John,” the man in question said from behind Sherlock, “was too busy worrying about Rosie’s mad godfather.”
“I miss him,” she whispered, her tiny finger tracing John’s face. “He promised me he wouldn’t be away for a long time.”
It was amazing how many times Sherlock had surprised him in the course of one day. Even after knowing him for several years, he kept shocking him.
The warmth in John’s expression grew. “You’re welcome,” he said. He turned and sat down at the kitchen table, and Sherlock had to force himself not to call him back and ask for another kiss.
“The very private information. What was it?” His voice was undemanding. It was like he was asking about the weather.
John frowned, that divot between his brows growing. “I rather thought,” he said slowly, “it was going to a relationship. Between you and I.”
Greg blew out a breath. “Of course they did. Sherlock’s mad for John, and I suspect John’s the same for him, though I don’t think he’s realized it.”
“Look at her,” John said. “Do you really think we could wrangle her into her car seat? You couldn’t even get into the pushchair.”
"Look, John,” Greg said, leaning forward. “I’d love to spend all my time focusing on this one boy who clearly needs help. But I have other campers to work with.”
“You’ll be good for Aunt Molly?” John was asking Rosie. She was being remarkably calm about the whole situation. In the aftermath of Mary’s death, she had spent many nights with friends while John took the time to grieve. She had never stayed with Sherlock though.
“Indeed. Mycroft told me everything I need to know and promised me he’s looking for her. In the meantime, he’s ensured this house is completely secure and will have people monitoring it twenty-four seven.”
doing better. The way he looked almost made Sherlock feel like he had stepped back in time. It was simply unacceptable.
“No, we don’t,” John said, taking his now-full plate back to the table. Sherlock’s sat on the counter. “Is that Greg? You should go hang out with him.”
“Believe me,” Sherlock said, and John did. “I don’t want to.” There was a sadness in Sherlock’s eyes that made John hurt. “But I need to keep you two safe.”
“Pure, unequivocal fact,” Sherlock replied. Much like with Faith (no, not Faith, he’d hallucinated her,
“I don’t know what to do,” Sherlock whispered. Lestrade shifted in his chair, his body language conveying his willingness to listen. Sherlock looked down at his tea, no longer steaming. “I’ve tried to wait for him to let me back in, I’ve followed Mary’s advice, I’ve let him blame me for whatever he wants to blame me for…” There was a lump growing in his throat, one that seemed to always be on the verge of choking him these days. “I don’t know what else to do. I went to a therapist, for God’s sake. John is a puzzle I can’t solve.”
Mycroft’s nostrils flared. John realized he had touched a nerve. He didn’t care; in fact, he was pleased. Mycroft could stand to actually feel something for once.
Only one image presented itself in his mind. Him and Sherlock, in the restaurant on the night Sherlock returned. Him clenching his fist in anger.
“Enough of that,” Sherlock interrupted. John heard rather than saw him getting out some food, most likely for Rosie. He sniffed and moved out of the way, still keeping his back to Sherlock. “I’ve forgiven you. We can’t keep letting the past drown us. Moving forward is our only option. It’s the only way we’ll get better.”
“Wait. Your sister,” he murmured, his eyes fighting to keep open. His thoughts were flying away from him, making it hard to concentrate. Sherlock frowned in confusion.
For the rest of camp, Sherlock and John were practically inseparable. They spent every minute they could together, hiking through the woods, swimming in the lake, or just hanging out in Sherlock’s cabin. Sometimes Sherlock conducted experiments and John sat by and watched. One afternoon, they took a canoe out onto the lake, and Sherlock tried to see if he could spot any fish. He leaned so far forward that he fell out of the canoe. Once John had stopped panicking, he laughed the rest of the day.
“She’s a playful one, isn’t she?” he ventured, his voice sounding quite loud in otherwise silent room. They were the first words spoken by anyone in seventeen minutes.
“What would Sherlock say about this, hm?” he asked. Rosie didn’t look at him. He sighed. “Good, yeah. Great.”
“There was a woman,” he said, feeling distanced from his own words. “On the bus. She kept smiling at me, and I smiled back. The attention was nice. It had been a while. At my stop, I got off, and she followed. Gave me her number.” He paused, remembering how he sat at this very table and toyed with the paper fragment with a scribbled set of numbers. How he’d slowly and methodically punched them into his phone.
Then the reality of the situation hit him completely, and he was bombarded with a million other questions.  They made his head spin. One seemed louder than all the rest.
it was ridiculous and a clear sign of his insecurity. Still, the words came out before he could stop them. “Do you regret it?”
“How are you feeling?” John asked. The question made Sherlock instinctively scowl, though he answered as politely as he could.
Sherlock’s lower lip disappears into his mouth, and his eyes are bigger than John’s ever seen them, except for perhaps the moment Sherlock first met Penny. It had taken John’s breath away then, and it does the same now.
He brought his knees to his chest. “I’m going to miss you.” They’d never addressed their impending separation, but now it was getting harder to ignore. John could see Sherlock freeze in the middle of turning a page. He forced himself to keep looking forward.
“Yeah.” John tugged on the strap again. “It’s been three weeks. I should be cleared by my doctor on Wednesday.”
“If you’d told me when we first met that you would be this good with a baby,” John said instead, his eyes facing forward now, “I would’ve died from laughing so hard.”
Sherlock looked ahead and saw that they had indeed reached the lake. A small group of campers splashed each other in the shallows, and a few girls were tanning on the shore. The sun was high in the sky, making the lake surface glitter. It was kind of beautiful, if Sherlock was forced to admit it.
I did that to you, and it is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever done. I don’t understand how you’re here right now. You should’ve been long gone, never to see me again. Christ.” He looked at Sherlock head on, and Sherlock was stupefied. “The cut on your face is finally gone, but I still see it. Every time I look at you. That’s why I don’t. Because then I can pretend it never happened.” He sniffed and looked away. “But it did.”
He was in the process of pulling out his phone to Google it when he heard the front door being unlocked. Hastily putting away Rosie’s food, he picked her up out of her high chair and nestled her against his side. She looked up at him, and he swore her expression was a bit smug.
His whole body ached, and his hands shook so much he had trouble unbuttoning his trousers that night. It was quite obvious what was happening, but he steadfastly refused to admit it. He wasn’t an addict; he was completely fine.
Behind him, a couple of distinctive steps were heard approaching the scene quickly. Appearing as if out of thin air as was her wont since she had given up magic as the majority of the kingdom. “Leave it like you found it.” She said, to which the three teens stopped and regarded her in varying amounts of amusement. “And by that, I mean
“Oh, your words have nothing to do with that.” The other replied, a smirk painting across his face as he looked down from almost a head above. The prince giggled helplessly, losing all sense of property for the second time that morning. He didn’t really know how tired he was of everyone treating him like a royal glass figurine until these three foreigners provided a respite.
The man with the ginger beard laughed in derision; making John apprehensive about what he could have possibly missed. The pirate stood back and grinned with perfectly white teeth. “He already accepted.” He commented, and John didn’t need a mirror to know that his face had fallen. “So
“Because I’m not like them, John!” He exclaimed, and if John had looked surprised before, he now looked truly shocked for the first time of the evening. “I’m not like
,” He said. “You don’t know Sherlock as well as you think.” That couldn’t be true. It didn’t sit well in his stomach. Sherlock had saved them all from Moriarty, even going as far as casting a spell over his own self —that from which he didn’t know he would manage to get out— in order to prevent someone else, someone
Lestrade outright laughed at Anderson’s face, reveling in someone actually putting the royal in his place publicly. “Alright,” He said. “Practice’s over. Let’s go.” The other teammates grabbed their equipment, and arranged their blunt swords on their designated place. Anderson’s quick, embarrassed escape was the first good thing to happen in Greg’s day, so far. Founding a girl sitting on the side benches, excitedly talking over the phone, was the second.
“You never came back.” The violet-haired boy commented, not reproachfully any more; in some way, he understood what it was like to make choices which were not even under your control. The limitation of options when someone in the world is the way they are. His opal eyes searched the other’s expression, changing between questioning and contemplating, as he believed his brother would be doing with him as well.
However, the other was not exactly in amused spirits, desperately talking and walking towards the middle of the room with determination in her expression. “Have you suddenly gone mad?” Janine queried, “Don’t tell me you’ll stop all this and just turn all feelings and nature on me-” Her hands were now on her hips, framing the pink skirt she was wearing. Her expression was wild, enough to make the other want to gape at it.
I can't believe we're so close to the end already. Come back next Tuesday/Wednesday to read the final chapter!
At the sound of his laugh, Greg turned and smiled mischievously at him, as if he approved of the other’s humour; John hoped that could mean he could actually befriend one —if not all— of the three teenagers. The other boys present looked at them with animosity, specially Philip Anderson, who was sporting a nasty grimace at the fact of having to spend his afternoon around
I know this took longer to upload, but I always strive for perfection and I hope you think it's worth the wait.
Irene regarded him, getting that strange look she had been giving him since they arrived at Auradon so many moon-cycles ago. “Why would I?” She queried, even if he couldn’t be sure whether it had been rhetorical or if she actually expected him to
!” The rebel felt his heart beat so loud that he was sure he heard it inside his ears, behind his eyes, in the splatter of the waterfall at the end of the lake.
Lestrade appeared behind John.“Shit.” He said, and the violet-haired boy was bound to agree completely. Even if distress at the scene was inevitable, Eurus was best to be kept in sight.
“And this love I feel for you is completely ridiculous,” The blue-eyed commented, smiling handsomely at his direction, as if he were not sorry of said fact at all. “You make me want to just dance.” John’s dancing skills left much to be desired, but thankfully, the prince was well loved among his subjects, so the act caused more fond amusement than actual humiliation. He shook his arms and moved his hips clad in the blue uniform, to which Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Yeah, I’m good.” She said, he words coming out strained as she was placed on the backseat of the car. Sally Donovan looked on in what appeared to be concern as she hauled up the strap of the quiver filled with the swords to rest comfortably on her shoulder. Her both feet shuffled next to the passenger’s door, displaying an anxiety that had never before been on her smooth brow. The rebel had often found her easy to deduce, —an open book, really— yet this was an emotion he believed was more tightly bound to her core than all others. The first encounter with real fear could bring that out of someone. But still she looked as if that concern angered her more than anything else.
“What? Why?” The lady said, turning her frail figure to gaze more closely at Sherlock. The boy stood straighter, not ready to be deemed unworthy of anyone’s time; if nothing else, they would know against whom they were planning on going. “You! I’d recognise those venomous eyes anywhere.” Margaret exclaimed in recognition as she took a frightened step back, the fear inside her expression obvious even from far-away lands. “Where is your mother?” She asked, apparently not completely aware there was no way his mother would be able to be there.
His lips broke out in a smile, looking at the king almost as breathless as he had been at the start of the evening. “This is
“Heroes don’t exist.” He stated, finding comfort in something he found familiar. “And if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them.” The face the other made at this statement could have been framed, gaping like a fish as he shook his head incredulous.
“We’re with you, Sherlock.” Janine’s voice broke through the miasma of horrible white noise inside his mind, making the violet-haired startle away from the vision at last. He shifted his gaze to look around to the others present. Anything to avoid looking at the sea-foam green of her dress floating as she was twirled. His brother’s face was the most striking among the discombobulated and affronted. Twisted into a deep scowl, and making him look several cycles older than he was.
“I believe you underestimate his character.” Sherlock commented, once the intruders were out of hearing range. The whole point of this conversation was to be discreet and a known secret would do good to none of them.
Sherlock’s previous devastation taking a back seat as he looked at the back of John’s head. The sliver of suspicion that had been there from the start growing bigger as he compared that posture with the undeniable one at the far end of the ship. He looked at the string quartet on the corner and to the dessert table, decked with a chocolate fountain and strawberries. His gaze narrowed at the conclusion. It was definitely him, but
“But where are Sherlock and John?” He asked, his big nose scrunching as he frowned in confusion. “You’re committing treason, aren’t you?” His eyes widened and his mouth hung open as he figured it out —at leas, he thought he did. “I’ll have to tell John’s parents, or Lady Hudson-” He said, already retreating to the door to make a run for it and ruin all their plans.
The silver-eyed boy turned his head to John, whose pleading gaze conveyed a million layers of meaning. The royal struggled against his bonds as two pirates made sure he couldn’t move closer to the deck, confining him on a wooden board with sure death down below to one side and them on the other. “Alright.” Sherlock said, twisting his body around and coming face to face with Irene and Greg, both of whom wore similar expressions. Lestrade’s hands clenched into fists while the indigo-haired girl crossed her slender arms over her chest. They stood terrified but with matching resigned frowns. Ready to advance once E. got what she wished. Sherlock payed no mind to their faces and sighed. “Always so dreadful.”
“I do.” Lestrade pitched in, smiling brightly and reaching a hand to mess up the purple curls on top of Sherlock head.
, nothing in his life was sure anymore. He stood on the ledge of the deck, climbing unto the first bar of the railing and supporting himself in one of the remaining light poles. He screamed Eurus’ name to entice her to come out and face him.
“What!?” The trio of teens exclaimed in unison. Incredulity painted across their expressions; one of them —Greg— even took a step back in rejection. Sherlock’s fists curled up inwards, knowing exactly where this business was headed. “No.” He said in finality, refusing to play to the other’s machinations. “I’m not going to some tedious boarding school filled to the brim with annoying morons and prissy pink princesses.”
Mycroft twisted the umbrella and stared straight ahead, a detached tone as he answered. “Auradon gets run down by villains and the royal family most likely gets executed.” Lestrade was completely aware that there was no way in which the ginger would be indifferent if that were to happen. He turned to watch the older man, feeling despair crush the tiny hopes they had of actually winning.
The older brother sighed, but his back straightened even more at the other’s verbal onslaught. “I didn’t think you’d be running off back to the Isle first chance you got.”
, from getting the wand. That he would betray John’s priorities so carelessly was proving hard to swallow and believe. Suddenly the ropes tying him up felt more constrictive by the knowledge.
at noon.” The tone she used left no argument on Victor’s side, but John still grabbed the opportunity to stare at him with a smirk. Silently amused that such a scary man was quickly subdued by a girl whose age was probably closer to his own than that of her pirate crew.
Once they were both alone, Sherlock let out an exasperated breath and rolled his eyes, as John chuckled with him and softly smiled. “Don’t pay attention to them.” He told him, his eyes kind and filled with concern as he glanced up at him. Sherlock was unsure in whether he found the king’s sentiment reassuring or even more frustrating. He shrugged in indifference, anxious to stop wasting their time on the lot of them. “They’re idiots, right?” The blonde joked, clearly attempting to appeal to the rebel’s predilection for insult, as he often did when he wanted to ease the tension.
in this situation. “You’ll be eaten alive.” She said. Another fact that John had no evidence to deny. He had no idea how the island worked, the inner system known only to those who were native. It was no giant leap to predict he would probably be robbed, beaten and completely helpless within two minutes of his arrival. This thought was not enough to deter him though. Seeing his determination, the girl sighed. “I’ll come with you.” She declared.
The eyebrows on his forehead scrunched up, as Lestrade stood there awkwardly. “I haven’t actually.” He admitted, even if it should not come as any surprise that a person who had spent most of his life banished from the kingdom had never attended any royal event, save for the fateful coronation that brought them there in the first place.
Irene, although more graceful, was also nibbling on a blue transparent ball with equal enthusiasm; it amazed the genius how easily distracted they could become when there were far more important things than some strange
“Oh, there you are, dear.” An excited voice came from behind them. “Everything looks so beautiful, love.” Lady Hudson said, as she placed an affectionate hand over the girl’s shoulder. She fussed over her granddaughter’s hair and smiled at Greg in greeting. “We just need to ladle out the punch before the sherbet melts,” She said. Her eyes twinkling under the lights. Molly opened her mouth to decline, but no sound came out from her lips before the woman kept talking. “And keep those forest rascals out before they do away with all the biscuits again,” The tone had turned annoyed, almost furious at the nerve of the men to disrespect the royal family in such a way. The girl’s big brown eyes stared at the rebel in panic, apologetically shrugging her shoulders as she nodded along with Hudson’s rant; clearly not knowing what to do. Greg laughed nervously, raising his eyebrows and placing his hands inside his trouser’s pockets. “A bit rude, isn’t it?” She said. “To steal food when-”
Sherlock looked at her and walked closer. “Oh, there’s no question about that.” He said. “The real question is what are you going to do to get back at them?” He ended and smiled a misbehaving grin.
Sherlock shrugged. There was something looser about him now, something resigned. “I thought you knew. And even if you didn’t, it was never relevant.”
John realized that. Despite his incredible observational skills, Sherlock didn’t see what was right in front of him. It both astounded and frustrated John to no end. He never knew he was the cause of Sherlock’s heartbreak because he never knew the depth of Sherlock’s feelings for him, but now that he knew, he hated himself more than ever before. His therapist would tell him that was too much self-loathing for one person. He would just laugh and shrug, as if to say,
he thought. He had to protect Rosie. His mind scrambled to come up with a plan. There was no way to get her out of the house without going downstairs, and he didn’t know where Eurus was.
He didn’t know why he said it, and the look in John’s eyes changed to something awed and almost wistful. Tearing his gaze away, Sherlock darted to the fridge to get the eggs. The chill from inside soothed his burning cheeks.
“–Yeah, I remember, thanks. The point is, you didn’t include me. And if you’ll recall, when you came back, I wasn’t very happy with you.”
upset that Sherlock was wasting the very opportunity John so desperately wanted. Although upset didn’t seem like the right word. Angry. Angry was good.
Mycroft didn’t argue. He simply nodded. For several long minutes, it was silent in the office, save for Rosie’s soft mumblings.
It was at this moment that Sherlock realized he’d never let himself imagine past this point. Yes, in the years since he discovered his feelings for John, he had pictured a world where John loved him back. But truthfully, he’d never really imagined their life together. He never thought it would happen, and therefore didn’t want to lose himself in a perfect daydream that was utterly impossible. Because he knew he would lose himself. His mind was a powerful thing, and it would swallow him whole if he let it.
He licked his lips. Shuffled a bit closer. Sherlock’s eyes widened ever so slightly as John began to lean in. He was nearly there when Sherlock said, “Wait.”
The next crack of thunder seemed to shake the windows in their panes. Rosie, apparently having lost her sense of comfort, began crying anew. Simultaneously, John and Sherlock shushed her. They both looked at each other, their eyes meeting at the same moment.
They walked in silence for a few minutes. Far off, kids could be heard shouting as they played football, and up above birds chirped. Sherlock kicked a rock and watched it skidder down the path.
Pleased with himself, John turned onto his left side and settled in to sleep. And if he dreamt of a certain curly-haired genius, it only made his night better.
“Let me just change,” Sherlock said, and headed upstairs to get dressed. When he was halfway up the stairs, he heard Lestrade say, “I’ll look after him.”
Actually, no. Seeing the look on John’s face hadn’t been a relief. It had been a mixture of resignation and heartbreak. But heartbreak wasn’t a new concept to him anyway.
Several rings had passed by the time he located it underneath a pile of papers. A quick look at the caller ID told him it wasn’t John, and his heart sank even lower than before. It wasn’t even a number he recognized. Frowning, he hit “Answer.”
“John,” he said, quietly and beseechingly. “I promise you I won’t abandon you. I’m going to come back. To do that, I need my mind to be clear, and it won’t be clear if I’m worrying about you or Rosamund. The best way to ensure I won’t worry about either of you is if you both stay here.”
“Sherlock –” John shoved himself up, scowling at how difficult it was to do with one hand and bad knees. “I’m not leaving you alone.”
Sherlock’s back was covered in scars. White lines crisscrossing the skin, forming a horrific, sickening piece of art.
“Evening, Greg,” said John, opening his door wider. Lestrade’s normally friendly face was stormy, and John had a sinking feeling he knew exactly what brought the DI to his doorstep at nearly eleven at night. He holds up his glass of whiskey (his second of the night). “Want a drink?”
“Oh,” Sherlock said. “I… I suppose I should’ve realized. How selfish of me.” He meant it, too. What a selfish idiot he was for not realizing John was still struggling with Mary’s death. “If you’d prefer, I can contact a nanny who can assist you on days where Molly and Lestrade cannot. Perhaps that would be better.” His very being cracked with every word he said, but he had to say it. It would be better for John. For John, he’d do it.
Sherlock felt quite out of his depth here. Emotional conversations were hardly his strong suit, and this particular one felt like the most important conversation of his life. He didn’t want to say the wrong thing.
His hands shook as he tried to take a sip of tea, but he was unable to keep the cup perfectly still and ended up with a line of brown liquid falling down his chin. He wiped it away, scowling a bit at the feeling of his growing beard. He hated facial hair. It made him feel unkempt. Yet, he was unable to do anything about it for the exact same reason he’d just spilled his tea.
“Sorry about that,” John said as he reentered the house. “This was the soonest she could pick Rosie up. Pretty perfect timing though, right?”
He picked up his gun. It wouldn’t be smart to leave it there for when Rosie would wake up the next morning. With his fingers still twisted with Sherlock’s, John tugged him up the stairs. It was crazy to think that when he had come down only ten minutes ago, he had been convinced a psychopath was in his home. This was a much better turn of events.
His eyes burned, and his chest was tight. His head was spinning, thanks to the alcohol and what Lestrade had just said. Because he was
“I’m in love with Sherlock.” His eyes jumped to the stairs, certain Sherlock had heard even though he whispered it. But there was no one downstairs except for him. The water was still running. Rosie was still laughing.
Outside the walls of the flat, he can make out the faints sounds of London. Cabs maneuvering the dark streets, drunk people stumbling home. If he concentrates hard enough, the creaking of floorboards would reach his ears. Still, no Penny.
“But does he still feel the same way?” John asked, feeling some anxiety creep up. This was what he had been trying to gauge all day. Whether or not he still had a chance.
Lestrade snorted. “You’re quite the social butterfly, aren’t you? Meet me at the Yard at one. If you back out, I’m calling John on you.”
“Yes, we do,” John said. “All the time.” He put a slight emphasis on the word “we,” and Sherlock couldn’t help but think back to that woman in the store, the one who thought Rosie was his daughter.
At Baker Street, silences never used to be a problem. Hours would pass by without John and Sherlock speaking a single word to each other. Whether this was due to Sherlock working in his Mind Palace or John typing out a blog post, both men felt comfortable and secure in the quiet that surrounded them. It was a peaceful sort of quiet, the kind that came from familiarity and contentedness. They never felt the need to fill it with pointless words or excessive noises.  Everything had been perfect just as they were.
“If it’s untrue, then why have you barely spoken to me since I arrived? Why are you sitting so far? Why are you focusing so hard on your laptop but not actually absorbing any of it?” He tilted his head. “Why, John?”
“Not necessarily,” he said. John looked at him, his eyebrows raised. Sherlock nodded toward the couch. “Sit down.”
John swallowed harshly and looked away. He reached up to the strap that hung around his neck and tugged at it. “Yeah. I’m good. Fine.”
Human error, he supposed. He once mocked Irene Adler for falling prey to it. It was ironic that the same thing that caused him to panic just three days after their visit to Baker Street. Because he had gotten too comfortable, too caught up in his feelings that he forgot something massively important.
Sherlock started to pull him up by his arm, then stopped. Slowly, almost achingly so, his hand slid down John’s arm to his hand, where his long fingers intertwined with John’s. John couldn’t breathe. With a slight tug, Sherlock helped John stand.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please, she’s only managed one syllable. That’s hardly the same as forming sentences.”
He could practically hear Mycroft rolling his eyes. “By staying with the Watsons, you are putting them in danger. Now might be a good time to return to Baker Street.”
Though, he was a little afraid to see what would happen once they were no longer in the same household.
“I’m calling because you’re listed as John Watson’s emergency contact. Mr. Watson has been shot, and we need you to –”
Only an hour later, John wished he had accepted. The house was too quiet, despite the television being on. Rosie’s favorite program was on, and though John hated to deposit her in front of the screen, he indulged her from time to time. Whenever it was on, she would sit and watch, hardly making a sound. It was both scary and a blessed relief.
The scoff that escaped Sherlock wasn’t supposed to happen, but he couldn’t help it. He was tempted to ignore the tea just to spite John, but still found himself reaching for the cup a second later.
“That taught me a lesson,” John continued. “Hiding everything about myself was better than being honest and possibly angering him.”
Sherlock crept through the woods, his footsteps sounding thunderous in the quiet darkness. He was supposed to be in his cabin, but he couldn’t stay away. The need to be with John for these final few hours burnt his skin and set him on fire. He hadn’t even entertained the idea that John would want to sleep instead of spend time with him. He prayed that wasn’t the case.
John’s tiny smile blossomed into a wide one, and Sherlock knew he made the right choice, Mycroft be damned. He had loved ones to think of.
John stared at the sentence for another minute before leaving it as it was. The last time he’d seen Harry was when she’d shot him a venomous glare and slammed the door to her cabin in his face. That was on the first day of camp.
“That’s when you figured it out? Really?” Remarkably, John’s voice was steady, but Sherlock knew John would never, ever feel comfortable talking about that day.
That was the closest he’d ever come to admitting it out loud. It was the alcohol’s doing, he knew, but he still managed to feel a bit proud of himself. He hadn’t felt that in a long time.
John had said it himself years ago. “Sherlock lives means John Watson lives.” It was still on the Internet for everyone to see. And it would never stop being true, because Sherlock Holmes was just as much a part of John as John’s own daughter was.
John felt a bit of his hope return, and before he could chicken out, he took Sherlock’s hand and squeezed. Sherlock’s head snapped up.
– and informed John and Mary that they were to be parents. And John had looked at Sherlock, a bright smile on his face, and gripped the back of his neck. Sherlock had been smiling too, but then his smile faded. John’s did too, for a reason he couldn’t entirely pinpoint. Suddenly Sherlock’s gaze had been too much, and he looked away.
John’s expression was an odd mixture of shocked and – dare Sherlock think it – amazed. His mouth had fallen open ever so slightly, and Sherlock endeavored not to look at it so much.
Just after five, John kissed Rosie’s head and stood up. The three of them had been sitting on the floor and rolling a ball back and forth. Sherlock would have once thought it tedious, but Rosie’s delight made it fun.
“I came out to him,” he said. The words were so simple, the sentence so short, and yet it meant everything to him. Just like yesterday, he felt weight in his shoulders lessen.
John ripped up some grass and threw it at him. “Not everyone can have nonstop genius thoughts like you.”
Normally, he would save it all until the morning. It was quite late, and the wine had made him tired. However, he knew there was no chance he would be getting any sleep tonight. He packaged the cupcake up and placed it into the fridge before getting started on cleaning everything else. He let his mind wander away from the twisting, anxious thoughts regarding Sherlock and his family. It would do him no good to worry about them right now. Not when he was going to spend every waking moment until Sherlock returned doing just that.
“Shhh…” Lestrade murmured, cradling Sherlock as he sobbed. “It’s alright. It’s okay. You’re okay. You’re okay, Sherlock.”
He registered that he was lying in a bed, and that his right shoulder hurt. He registered that his throat was dry, and his eyelids were incredibly heavy, and his mind was swimming. For any other person, this would be a terrifying situation, and they would probably have a hard time understanding what was going on, but this wasn’t the first time he had been shot, so things came to him much easier.
“No. No, don’t ever say that. You didn’t deserve – absolutely not.” John looked so hurt. “Sherlock. You can’t really believe you… please tell me you don’t.”
with him. Thinking about it now, as he laid in bed staring at the ceiling, it all made perfect sense. The strong desire to touch Sherlock in any way possible while they made breakfast in the mornings. The rush of affection he would feel during quiet nights in front of the telly, when he would look over and see Sherlock relaxed and unguarded. The pain he felt whenever Sherlock brushed off their closeness. Hell, he even finally understood his feelings toward Irene Adler and why she bothered him so much.
“Still.” He poked at his food with his fork. “You’ve been a lifesaver recently. I owe you. Several times over.”
“She won’t eat,” he said, ticking things off on his left hand. “She won’t nap. She won’t play. She’ll hardly sit still enough to be changed.”
It started in the morning, with Rosie refusing to eat breakfast much as she had before. This time, however, no amount of cajoling and bargaining on John and Sherlock’s part could convince her otherwise. They had argued with her for over an hour before it became apparent that the little girl was not going to budge.
if they answered any of my emails. They’re all imbeciles there, I don’t know why they don’t listen to me.”
They both sat on the couch, in the same positions they sat in that night they tried to move forward and got interrupted by Sherlock’s siblings. It wasn’t a conscious decision, since in the time Sherlock had been there, they had begun to gravitate to certain spots. Not unlike how they had at Baker Street.
“No, of course you wouldn’t,” John said. “Because you’re an idiot who still thinks being alone is the best course of action. It’s not. I really thought you had learned that by now.”
“Baker Street is secure,” replied Sherlock with a wave of his hand. “I’m fine. I’m more worried about you.”
“It took a few hours,” Sherlock began as he unbuttoned his shirt, “but I eventually constructed a profile of the killer. All of the previous victims would frequent support groups, but never the same ones, which made it hard to find connections. The killer would attend a new support group each week and pick her prey.”
It was such an intimate moment, far more intimate than anything he’d ever experienced. And the fact that it was with
Sherlock took off his coat and laid it on top of the drawers. Moving his bag to the side, he got to work on making the bed. John’s eyes widened in surprise. Sherlock slowed his movements when he noticed.
A knock on the front door startled Sherlock out of his swirling thoughts. He turned to see John answering it, Rosie still in his arms.
Tears pricked John’s eyes, and he swallowed. His arm yelled at him to put his daughter down, so he quickly set her down in her high chair. It gave him the chance to hide his face.
“Take off your shirt and start talking,” he ordered. His Captain Watson voice slid in a bit, and he saw Sherlock’s spine straighten before he complied. It made him grin a little.
“That wasn’t a lie,” he said, his back to Lestrade. “I haven’t been spending enough time with her lately. I’ve been failing her.”
"Look, Sherlock,” he said. “You’re already stuck here for seven weeks. Regardless of whether or not you believe you need the help, someone who cares about you obviously does. So maybe you should just give it a go.”
He fumbled his way through making coffee before sitting down at the table. He knew he should eat breakfast, but there was barely anything to eat, and he wasn’t hungry. Coffee would have to sustain him for now.
John didn’t even bother to hide his fond smile. He’d just had pasta last night, but how could he possibly refuse Sherlock?
John pulled back, but only enough so that he could see Sherlock’s face. Now that he was taking the time to study him, John noticed that his hair was greasy, and there were brushes of dirt on his cheeks. No bruises though, thankfully, and his eyes shone brighter than they ever had. Unable to resist himself, John cupped his jaw and rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered in response.
“Three months ago, I overdosed. I wasn’t on a case at the time. I just needed the high. I’d gotten into a fight with my parents, I hated the people I went to school with, and I wanted to get away. I gave myself too much and woke up in a hospital with my brother sitting beside me. The first thing he did when I was coherent enough to understand him was give me a pamphlet for this place.” He held out his hands. “And then I was shipped here.”
“Mm, fair,” John conceded, though he was smiling in a way that made Sherlock’s stomach flip, and wasn’t that just bloody stupid? “But you’re up there.”
John came to stand by Sherlock’s shoulder and peered over at the file. His eyes widened at its contents. “Sherlock, you can’t stay here, not with a case like this. You have to go with him and investigate.”
The woman on the bus. Her face rushed up to the forefront of his mind, and his heart gave the same tiny thrill it always did when he received a text from her. It wasn’t the kind of thrill that came from love or even infatuation, but the thrill that was associated with danger and illicit activities and the feeling of being alive.
“Oh,” he says. “Um, sure.” He stands and takes his daughter from Sherlock, ignoring the way their hands brush when they make the careful transfer, or how close he is to him (close enough to feel his breath on John’s cheek).
Sherlock stared at the wall. Downstairs, he could hear Rosie’s delighted squeals and John’s warm laugh. He knew without looking that his things were scattered around the room as though he lived there, as though it was his real bedroom. John had even given him a key to the house.
John thought of all the texts he’d exchanged with Eurus, all the late-night messages and hidden smiles. What he’d felt for her wasn’t anywhere close to love, but it had ignited something in him and made him feel like he was in control of
When John looked at him next, Sherlock was horrified to see tears in his eyes. “John, please don’t –”
John woke with a start, his head snapping around in search of the noise that woke him. When his eyes landed on Sherlock, the panic in them disappeared and was replaced by confusion.
John sniffed and wiped his nose. It took him another couple minutes to fully compose himself, but Sherlock was patient. He didn’t say anything, letting John have some time with his thoughts.
Was he in love with Sherlock? It was easy to dismiss, but the second he did it he wondered if he was wrong in doing so.
But slowly and surely, John felt something else grow. He pictured it as a ball of light in his chest, right beside his heart. It first formed when he’d held Sherlock’s hand on the dock. He’d expected a bit of resistance, or maybe Sherlock shying away from even the slightest touch. But instead, Sherlock had
John at 221B. Sherlock coming out to him. John realizing Sherlock was in love with him. Sherlock leaving the room and John leaving the flat. John avoiding seeing him the next day.
John’s fingers were twisted into a fist now. Sherlock swallowed. “You’ve never talked about him before.”
As much as Sherlock hated to admit it, Mycroft’s tone unnerved him. He sat down on the edge of the bed. “Go on then.”
Things weren’t awkward between them, Sherlock wouldn’t go that far. But whatever ease they had between them thanks to the cover of night was gone in the morning sunlight. It was like last night had been the dream, and now they were in reality. Their communication skills had certainly improved during the time Sherlock had stayed with John, but now, for a fleeting moment, he worried they were about to return to those early days when they still stumbled over their words and skirted around each other.
These are dangerous thoughts though. He can dream in this moment that he and Sherlock are together, that Sherlock is Penny’s father too, and that when Sherlock puts her back to bed, he and John will retire to the same bed in the same room. But that’s not what will happen, and any dream John concocts that suggests it would is false and will only hurt him in the end.
The exchange – almost their final one – is never far from John’s mind. He has replayed it countless times, turned it over and over in his head like an old television program.
Sherlock looked up at him, and John saw something unfamiliar in his eyes. His long fingers tightened around his mug.
“Did you have a good time, love?” Rosie grinned up at him and waved Sherlock’s scarf around. It looked damp in several places, leading John to believe she’d had it in her mouth.
Rosie was sitting up in her cot when Sherlock walked in. At the sight of him, Rosie ceased crying almost immediately, and her blue eyes widened.
John shook his head. “It’s just, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you make your bed. Or do any housework, for that matter.”
John shifted Rosie in his arm and grimaced. Sherlock took a step forward, then stopped. “I think if anyone needs protection right now,” John said, trying to hide his discomfort and failing, “it’s you. She’s your sister.”
“Well,” he said, struggling to compose himself. He blinked away the wetness in his eyes and cleared his throat. “Rosamund needs someone with two available hands to protect her. I suppose it should be me.”
“I only meant,” Sherlock said, focusing on the squirming girl in his arms, “that when she’s this small, I worry that every little thing could harm her in some disastrous way. What if she hits her head on the coffee table while crawling and gets a head wound? What if she puts something in her mouth that chokes her?” He wiped Rosie’s nose again. “What if this cold gets worse and she becomes truly sick?”
He often wonders what would’ve happened if he’d just opened his mouth one of those nights and said, “John, I love you.” If he’d laid himself bare for John and showed him just how much he meant to Sherlock. Would John accept it and tell Sherlock he felt the same way? Or would he have moved out the next day?
he thought, his gaze traveling over the still-healing cut on Sherlock’s face. He would never be able to say enough apologies to make up for that, but damn if he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life trying.
Not an absurd amount of time, but long enough that John was jittery again. Based on what Mycroft had told him, Sherlock was now about five days late for checking in. Considering Sherlock’s intellect, this was not good. Not good at all. He should have been able to work out the puzzle by then and head to the next spot. He should have made contact. John should have heard something.
Sherlock unrolled his napkin and smoothed it over his lap. “Yes. He’s apologized for how he treated me, and I’ve forgiven him. We’ve agreed to be more… forthcoming with our feelings.” He wrinkled his nose and took a sip of water. “It’s all rather sentimental, I suppose.”
John wasn’t sure if he was supposed to laugh or cry. Laugh because the idea of Sherlock cooking seemed ridiculous, cry because
“What’s that?” He leaned to the side so he could get a better look. All of the muscles in Sherlock’s upper body tensed.
John nodded. “Tomorrow, yeah.” He looked up into Sherlock’s eyes, which were already focused on him. He bit his lip. “I just. I think I need to… God, I –”
But he couldn’t tell his mum he hadn’t seen her at all. She would get worried and tell John he needed to make more of an effort.  Camp had just started. He needed to give her some time. At least, that’s what Greg said.
During his little speech, he’d heard footsteps coming up the stairs. At first he had ignored them in favor of paying attention to his daughter, but now it occurred to him that they were heavier than Mrs. Hudson’s. Still calming Rosie down, he looked up and into John’s eyes. Not on Rosie’s face, but on John’s.
John straightened and glared at him. “I know that, thanks, but she’s not responding to that either.”
There is only one voice. That much he’s certain of. He can overtake one man. He’s done it before. He just needs to maintain the element of surprise. He continues to inch down the stairs, taking care to avoid the particularly creaky steps. Skirting the landing by keeping close to the wall, he peers down. The door to the sitting room is cracked open, warm light spilling out.
Without thinking, John said, “I know.” There wasn’t a day that went by now where he didn’t think of Sherlock’s feelings for him. He often wondered if he was being unfair, or if there was something he should be doing. These constant worries always ended with him giving up and carrying on like he always had. But now, in this quiet moment with just the rain and the single lamplight, with just Sherlock, John thought he might have been doing things wrong.
“I know, that’s why I took the liberty of getting her tonight.” Sherlock’s eyes sweep over John. “You haven’t been getting much sleep lately. I thought you might want to get through the night without waking up.”
Rosie giggled as if she knew something he didn’t. It was mildly infuriating, since he knew there obviously was no way she could. “Fine, don’t help me. I’ll figure it out.”
“You’re doing the right thing, brother mine,” said Mycroft. “And it’s not as though you’ll never see them again.”
“You’ve sent him on a wild goose chase!” John gestured to the map, the black Xs mocking him while also strangely giving him a small amount of comfort. “This was supposed to be a simple mission, one you had complete control over, but she’s playing you!”
“Just keep an eye on her, will you?” asked John. Sherlock nodded, uncertain of what else to say. John flashed him a warm smile and left the room. With a frown, Sherlock looked down at Rosie.
John snorted. “Somehow, I can’t picture Mycroft doing chores.” Sherlock looked up at him and smirked.
This is the life John wants. A mixture of domesticity (courtesy of Penny) and excitement (courtesy of Sherlock). That’s exactly what they are, John realizes. The two people he loves most in the world symbolize two different lives, two lives that when combined result in something that John wants so badly, something mind-numbingly beautiful.
His gaze fell on his old chair, the one that sat just across from Sherlock’s. It had been there before he moved in, so it wasn’t like it had truly belonged to him, but it had become his over time. It hadn’t been there before Sherlock was shot, but then Sherlock moved it back. John wondered what it was like for him to have it be unoccupied. To sit across from it and constantly be reminded that John wasn’t there. Did Sherlock even sit in his chair when he was there alone? Or was it too much?
He wasn’t sure if he imagined it, but it was as though the lump moved in on itself. “Who wants to know?”
“What is it?” Sherlock asked through gritted teeth. John rubbed his thumb over the back of Sherlock’s hand, and he relaxed ever so slightly.
Sherlock wiped Rosie’s mouth with a damp cloth. Silence had settled over the kitchen, but it wasn’t awkward or oppressive. It was the opposite, in fact. There was a certain level of domesticity they had achieved in the recent days, and it was, quite frankly, delightful. Domestic life had never appealed to Sherlock, but the past week was making him rethink it.
“Wait.” Sherlock’s voice stops him when he’s in the doorway. John rolls his shoulders back and turns around. Sherlock is standing now, his fingers twisting together as he tries to piece together a sentence. John waits, resisting the urge to flee upstairs.
The something else was what baffled John even more than Sherlock’s unerring interest in him. John had known from the first moment he met Sherlock that Sherlock was beautiful. With eyes and cheekbones like that, how could anyone think he wasn’t?
Sherlock tried to banish the idea from his mind, but it had already taken hold, and once you give an idea a home, you can’t kill it. There was a chance John Watson liked him, and it made Sherlock breathless.
Of course, the counselor didn’t know when to quit. Sherlock had anticipated that from the camp shirt he was wearing. It was worn and stretched out. Not from this year. This wasn’t his first time at this camp, which meant he was accustomed to campers being obstinate. Sherlock couldn’t decide if he was impressed or really irritated.
But if there was one thing John should have learned after all these years, it was not to underestimate Molly Hooper.
“Honestly, last night was perfect,” he said finally, recalling everything that came before the dreaded phone call. “I definitely caught him by surprise, which was what I wanted, and he seemed to love it. We talked about all sorts of things. It was… it was how it used to be. No awkwardness, no sadness.” He held Rosie closer to his chest. “He looked so happy. And beautiful. And he
He didn’t respond to John, which only made him more upset. He sat down heavily onto the coffee table, staring at Rosie, who finally appeared to be picking up on the high emotions flying through the room.
“I cheated on Mary with his sister,” he said bluntly, almost relishing the way the words fell from his lips. He was destroying his image. It felt amazing.
“True.” John paused. When he spoke again, his voice was sincerer. “I owe you a great deal. I may not have liked everything that led to it, but I do really appreciate what you’ve done for me.”
Sherlock’s bloody torso flashed in John’s mind. “Oh, right. No, I know about it.  I patched him up when he got home.”
“We’ll be back soon,” John said to Molly, perfectly composed. He gave Rosie a quick kiss on the head. “Be good for Aunt Molly, love.”
The sky was a pale gray, with the sun trying valiantly to poke through the cloud cover. Mothers watched over their children as they played in the grass, and dog owners kept an eye on their pups as they bounded around. Everyone was taking advantage of the unseasonably warm day, and John had to admit he was happy to be amongst them. He hadn’t been out in public since he’d been shot. He missed the fresh air.
“I had to! Otherwise Mummy would take away my microscope, and I had a very important experiment on.”
“She shot you,” Sherlock reminded him, like he could forget. “Regardless of whatever happened to her as a child, she nearly killed you. She clearly does not care about her family, because if she did, she wouldn’t have harmed you.”
Mycroft sighed deeply and sat up straighter. He clasped his hands together and rested them on the desk. “There is no need to resort to violence,” he said. “Though I can’t guarantee you’ll like what I have to say.”
It was honestly the worst kind of answer, as it didn’t nearly encapsulate everything he was feeling, but he couldn’t form the proper words. They were all jumbled up in his mind and trying to string them together was impossible. Thankfully, John seemed to understand. His lips quirked up, and the anxiety faded from his expression.
“I’d always suspected, you know,” Lestrade said. “After years of never seeing you with anyone, and then suddenly you show up with a man who – no offense to John – didn’t seem particularly remarkable.”
Sherlock tore his gaze from the sidewalk in front of them to give John a condescending look. John scowled at him.
Sherlock’s shoulders sagged. His brother might have been smarter than him, but he still knew Mycroft better than anyone. Despite everything, he believed him then. And even if he hadn’t, the memory of John in a hospital bed was too fresh to ignore. He had to protect him.
“Stop.” Sherlock was firm, and almost angry. “I don’t want to cause you any more pain. I don’t want to
“All kinds. Cancer, recovering alcoholics, grieving the loss of a spouse.” He glanced uncertainly at John before focusing back on his shirt. “She got off on other people’s pain.”
Because he hadn’t just revealed his sexuality to John. He revealed so much more, and based on the way John was struggling to maintain eye contact, he could tell John was thinking about it too.
A terrible thought sprang into his mind. Eurus could be in his house. She could’ve gotten tired of messing with Sherlock and decided to take out John for her own entertainment. John’s heartbeat quickened.
The sound of a key being shoved into a lock made him jump. He automatically tensed – a habit from his army days when he would hear sudden noises – then felt crushing relief. He strode out of the kitchen to the sitting room just in time for the front door to swing open.
who.” Her normally shy demeanor was gone. It was actually quite thrilling to witness. “Watching the two of you today was painful. I know you’ve got your issues, and I know you feel guilty for what you did, but you can’t keep ignoring it forever. It’ll kill the both of you if you do.”
“Good morning,” Sherlock said slowly. “Sleep okay?” He carried Rosie over to her high chair and settled her in, peering at John over his shoulder as he did.
“He still walked away,” he said, his feet tracing Sherlock’s path from the night before. “In the end. He was disgusted with me, I know it.”
, golden boy cared about him and he barely knew him. How? Sherlock was insufferable, obnoxious, arrogant, practically a sociopath. How on earth could John care for someone like
“For the love of –” John cut himself off, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. He clenched his left hand into a fist before releasing and flexing it. “I hurt you, Sherlock. I punched you, and knocked you down, and – and you were defenseless, you were
“There’s something you’re not telling me,” Sherlock said. John swallowed harshly and tried to look casual.
Her cries began to subside, but they hadn’t stopped completely. Sherlock glanced to the door to make sure John hadn’t been woken. He couldn’t hear or see anything, so he took it as a good thing. Starting to pace the nursery, he spoke to her quietly, hoping he could get her to drop off again.
He was not sure what to do with that information. Sherlock was in love with him, which theoretically should make things easier, but it didn’t. What if John told Sherlock he had feelings for him, and then realized a month later he actually didn’t? Their friendship would be ruined, but even worse, Sherlock’s heart would be broken. John would rather get shot again than hurt Sherlock.
John’s stomach turned. He stood abruptly from the couch and picked up the cupcake. Walking into the kitchen made the ache in his body grow even more when he saw the remains of their dinner on the table. He had refrained from cleaning up in favor of skipping ahead to the part where he got to sit close to Sherlock on the couch.
John had thought that would make Sherlock happy, but he swore he saw something shutter in Sherlock’s eyes.
“I just have one more question,” he said, his voice almost a whisper. He stood still in the middle of the sitting room, feeling surprisingly calm at the center of his roiling emotions. The eye of the storm.
"I solve them better with it.” Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest, daring Greg to question him again.
“Can I ask what her thing is?” Greg tucked a couple books into his cubby and eyed John cautiously. John was proud of himself for not automatically tensing.
A common misconception was that Sherlock hated everyone. That wasn’t true. While he had plenty of people he did hate, what he felt for most of humanity was simply apathy. If they didn’t irritate or offend him, he didn’t care.
“Why would I complain?” Sherlock picked himself off the floor and hurried across the room. Rosie had her tiny hands on the bottommost step. He reached down and swiftly picked her up, settling her on his hip. She giggled, thrilled with their game.
Also, just to reiterate: I am not a doctor, so recovery processes are a bit fudged here. As is the layout for John's house because the show didn't give us much detail.
from up above. Rosie whimpered and pressed herself closer to him. John’s expression softened in concern, and he stretched his left hand out to rub her back.
“Let’s be honest,” John said, settling back against the cushions with Rosie. “When it comes to her vocabulary, she’s – well – you know.”
“I suppose I love my parents,” said Sherlock, flatly. “And I might say I love my brother, but only if under extreme duress and possible threat of life. There’s also Mrs. Hudson, and-”
“I’m going to start dinner,” John announced, smoothing his hands on the front of his trousers. Sherlock had noticed that John had been using his right hand a lot, as if he was relishing once again having it available to him. It made Sherlock happy to see him whole again.
he’s the only person you’ve been talking to – and no, Rosie doesn’t count – you can’t share your true feelings on the matter.” He sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
“How would you know?” John rubbed his forehead. “You’ve never been involved with children before her.” He tried to hand Rosie her dog back, and she batted it away with a shriek. Sherlock winced.
“Then there you go. Make this a priority for when he gets back. Work through this with him, not me.”
John inhaled shakily and nodded. He stepped forward and raised himself up on his toes. Sherlock nearly collapsed when John pressed the sweetest of kisses on his cheek.
For a moment, it didn’t seem like Sherlock was going to let that slide, but then, mercifully, he did. “It’s not hard, John. All I had to do was boil water, and even an idiot is capable of that.”
Something not unlike electricity shot through Sherlock’s body, and for a second he didn’t think he could do it. He couldn’t leave this man behind.
He had clearly meant it as a joke, but it landed heavier than that. Sherlock’s lips parted. John looked startled. Rosie made a cooing noise.
“She’s scared,” Sherlock pointed out needlessly. “A common way to eradicate fears is to explain the reality behind them.”
The edges of Sherlock’s vision are starting to blacken. Breathing is harder, but the wound hurts less now. Little time left.
“I wasn’t expecting you to get here so early,” John said, finally emerging from the building. Sherlock slowly turned his head and looked up at him. The sun made his hair shine, and he was smiling at him. Sherlock’s mouth went dry.
“I shouldn’t have – done that,” John admits. “I should’ve asked you if it was alright. I’m sorry I didn’t.”
He could see the gears turning in Sherlock’s head as he processed both the request and just how much prolonging his departure could hurt him. His heart hammered in his chest.
If Lestrade was shocked, he hid it well. If anything, he seemed confused. “Wait. You told John you’re gay, and he just left?”
In the immediate few days after Sherlock left, Rosie had crawled all over the bottom floor in search of him. John didn’t think she would notice his disappearance, but he should have known better than to underestimate his daughter. She knew Sherlock was gone, and she did not like it. She had cried a little, especially around bedtime, when she couldn’t be lulled to sleep by his soothing voice. Even now, she kept looking for him, as if he would appear from behind a door or under the table.
“I want to say sorry,” Lestrade said, and John could practically picture his remorseful face. “I said I was going to watch out for him, and I didn’t do a great job.”
“Oh, shut it with the voice.” At that moment, their waiter approached their table, clearly there for their drink orders. Based on the look on his face, Sherlock’s tone had scared him.
Here, Mycroft hesitated again. It made John tense. “One to two days, depending on the difficulty of the puzzle.”
“What?” John somehow looked horrified. “No. No, don’t do that. That’s not necessary. Nothing will get fixed if you do that.”
On any other day, Sherlock would have been so pleased to hear his brother admit he needed him, but now he wanted to throttle him. “What do you need me for? You’re the British Government, you have people who can take care of this. Have them assist you.”
It’s never been their wedding before. That’s a new one. Most of the time it’s their first date, or first kiss. Once before he’s seen John proposing, but they’ve never gotten further than that. Sherlock supposes it’s a good thing it hasn’t happened before, because he doesn’t know if he could handle the sadness he’s feeling now if it was a recurring thing.
He’d always had nightmares, but the subject of them had changed over the years. Recently they often were about Mary’s death, but the past few nights had featured Sherlock, curled up on the floor of the morgue, bloody and broken. John had put them there, and he woke up gasping every time, filled to the brim with remorse.
Sherlock was watching him closely, as if checking to see if he was sincere. Then he nodded and turned his attention to the white bags clustered on the table. He reached into one and pulled out two cans of beans. Spinning on his heels, he approached the cabinets, halting about a foot away. John couldn’t see his face, but he was certain he could picture the look of slight befuddlement that Sherlock was probably wearing.
John hummed in acknowledgment as he prepared their teas. Within a week of being stuck with the sling, he had started to master how to do things one-handed. Making tea was one of the first things he learned.
The ball of light grew in size and intensity every day. By the end of the summer, John was convinced it wouldn’t fit in his chest anymore. He was honestly surprised it hadn’t burst out of him yet, tearing him apart completely.
“If this is going to work,” he ventured, “we’re going to need to be open with each other. That’s the way I see it. No more hiding, no more secrets. We’re doing it together, or not at all.”
A tiny cry pierced the night. Sherlock was upright in seconds and out his door in a few more. A distraction was just what he needed, and Rosie was going to provide it.
He was already flagging down a cab before he realized the nurse wouldn’t be able to relay his message.
John blinked and looked away. 221B hadn’t been his in a very long time. He’d been there many times since he moved out, but none of them seemed to
John alternated between eating his dinner and feeding Rosie. Sherlock watched with keen eyes, and in any other situation, his attentiveness would have felt awkward. Instead, it made John inexplicably happy.
Sherlock’s eyes were becoming less focused. John could practically see him sinking into the memory. He spoke in a softer voice. “Why’s that?”
Molly perched herself on the edge of a cozy armchair and waited. She would never ask him to start. It was always on his own time, whenever he could bring himself to speak, if he even could. It was one of the things he appreciated most about her. She was gentler than most therapists.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and worked on unknotting his napkin. “It’s manageable.” He met Lestrade’s gaze. “I’m happy right now. Truly.” He paused, then gave the tiniest shrug. “As much as I can be.”
In the half hour that Sherlock had been there, John had said less than a hundred words to him, and he barely looked at him. Rosie paid more attention to Sherlock than her father had, and he was quite grateful for that, because the cold shoulder from John hurt more than he cared to admit.
His gut churned the closer he got, and it took a great deal of effort to stop clenching his hand. His experiences with Harry didn’t make him particularly excited to try his hand at another tortured teenager.
“I have no desire,” said Sherlock slowly, “to be in a romantic relationship with Irene Adler. Leave it alone.”
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed since Sherlock spoke, but he was brought back to the present by the gentle touch of a hand on top of his. He opened his eyes and looked up into Sherlock’s wide ones. John still found it hard to breathe.
“This feels like we’re making a pact, or something,” said John, attempting to lighten the mood. It worked, for Sherlock’s lips quirked up.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It doesn’t matter what I’d rather be doing. I came here to help you, and that is what I am going to do.” Though he hadn’t been on a proper case in ages, and he was desperate to go on this one, even if he wouldn’t have his faithful partner by his side.
“You know, Sherlock,” John said. “You don’t have to hide things from me, I’m here to support you, to be your confidant. You can tell me anything.”
John’s eyes burned, and he pressed his face to Sherlock’s neck like he could fuse them into one person. Sherlock had a faint, unpleasant odor to him, but John didn’t mind. He could be covered in sewage and John would still clutch him just as he was now.
He had gotten used to sleeping alone again, finally, but he would be lying if he said he hadn’t been hoping that he would get a new sleeping partner that night. He had no expectations, no dreams of sex. He merely wanted to sleep beside Sherlock and relax in his warmth.
Now the air had been knocked from his lungs. Sherlock hadn’t anticipated that answer, and it left him dazed and thrilled, like he’d been electrocuted. He was certain he was gaping at John, though he couldn’t be arsed to care.
He tries (unsuccessfully) to put it from his mind as he gets ready for the day. If it were anything else, he is certain he wouldn’t have any difficulties doing so. But all he can think about when he gets dressed is how John looked in his tux. When he eats a paltry breakfast, he wonders what they would’ve served at their reception. Would they have had a reception? It doesn’t matter, because it isn’t real.
“No, Watson. We do not choke people with their scarfs.” He paused, contemplating. “Unless that person is a criminal or an idiot. Then it’s acceptable.”
Sherlock stood and hoisted Rosie up to his hip. She was gnawing on her stuffed dog, her blue eyes massive. For a moment, Sherlock let himself imagine a world where she was his, and they were a family. He closed his eyes and pressed his nose to her hair, just like John had earlier that day.
John’s cheeks heated. “Oh. Right, yeah. That’s considerate of you.” He sniffed. “You do kind of smell.”
He expected Sherlock to relax, but he didn’t. Instead, he almost seemed to get more anxious. John couldn’t blame him, really. He didn’t like talking about his childhood either.
I realize this isn't much of a chapter, but the next one is way better and I'm already like 75% done it, so I'm hoping to have it up within the next week.
“John,” Sherlock murmured. He tightened his left arm around Rosie so he could reach out with his right and smooth out John’s fist. “You are nothing like him.”
When they first met, John had instantly written him off as a posh boy who came from a rich family and went to a private school where all the students were children of lords or government officials. Sherlock probably grew up in a fancy manor with lots of servants and never had to want for anything. That assumption had only gotten stronger when John had met Mycroft, who was somehow ever posher than his brother.
Molly had to clutch her book to keep herself from squealing. “Sometimes you just need a woman’s touch.”
After he returned with a bag of his things, John had shown him to the guest room. It was small and barely furnished – just a queen-sized bed, a nightstand, and a set of drawers. The bed didn’t even have sheets or a comforter. It was quite depressing. John resented it.
In a way, Sherlock is glad he never told John, because if his response had been the latter, Sherlock would’ve been lost. Lost without his blogger, his heart.
Sherlock lifted John’s hand up to his mouth and kissed his palm. John’s eyes had gone wide, and when Sherlock’s lips made contact with his skin, he let out an “Oh” of his own.
Their conversation was stopped by the reappearance of their waiter, poised to take their food orders. Sherlock rattled his off dutifully while knotting his napkin. Lestrade’s eyes were still on him.
“I’ve got one,” John said, continuing the game they had been playing for nearly an hour now. “Best holiday memory.”
“No,” Sherlock replied without a second thought. “I was too young for that. I was just happy to have a friend.” He looked away to the window. “I didn’t think I wanted one, but I suppose that every child does, deep down. No matter what they say.”
Lestrade set the tea down in front of Sherlock before taking a seat beside him. Sherlock watched the steam from it rise and curl before dissipating into the air. He wished he could do the same.
John was quite pleased to hear Sherlock hadn’t even hesitated in returning to him, and even happier to hear him call his house home, but there was one thing he had to be certain of before he could fully relax.
If Mycroft’s assistant – once named Anthea, now something else – was surprised to see John storm in with Rosie in a carrier against his chest, she didn’t look it. John had to admit this irritated him; just once, he wanted to shock these people. Instead, however, not-Anthea merely stood and led him back to Mycroft’s dark, modern-looking office.
“They’re great,” John lied, trying to sound upbeat. Worrying Molly or dragging her into his messes were the last things he wanted to do.
“I’m sorry I took Watson without checking with you first.” Sherlock took his note from that morning off the fridge and crumpled it up. John almost wished he’d left it there. “I didn’t want to wait.”
Lestrade seemed pleased he’d gotten John to accept it. John would need to take him out for a pint or twenty once this was all finished. “Just sit and talk with him. That’s what he needs most right now, and I’m pretty sure it’s what you need too.”
“John?” Molly’s voice seemed to come from far away. He blinked a few times and realized that she was now crouched in front of him. She’d taken his mug and placed it on the coffee table, and she had a hand on Rosie’s back, as if she was prepared to take her away at a moment’s notice. His breaths came out in rapid pants. Panic attack.
His cart was half-filled with random food items he was mostly certain John liked. There were some biscuits, eggs, soups, cheeses, and pastas, along with an array of other things. He’d debated with himself for a while in front of the cereals before snatching up one he thought he might’ve seen in Baker Street once and adding it to the mix. Grouped in one corner of the cart were a series of canned foods he considered acceptable, and he’d made sure to grab several foods he knew Rosie liked. He had been there for nearly an hour, stressing over every decision, and he was more than ready to be done.
After all the tossing and turning of the previous night, he decided to keep things to himself and wait to see if anything changed. He wasn’t going to rush into this and mess it up. Sherlock was too important to him for that.
“Okay. You can either put Rosie in the pushchair or the carrier. When we get there, she’ll probably want to run around in the grass, which is fine. We just need to keep an eye on her.”
In turn, John told Sherlock more about his dad. He told him about what made him want to be a doctor. He told him about juggling school, rugby, and working to keep his family moving. He told him everything there was to know about John Watson, and with every new anecdote, John expected Sherlock to drop him and find someone far more interesting.
home. Sherlock shook his head, and John frowned. He didn’t know who was at the door either. It made Sherlock nervous, especially when he considered how unprepared they were for any sort of attack, if the person ringing the doorbell was who he thought it was. They were both in their pajamas, John still had his sling, and Rosie was sitting on the floor in front of them.
“That’s because I just invited her,” John said. He was struggling to put his jacket on. Without thinking, Sherlock moved forward and helped tug the garment over John’s good arm. Molly smiled.
Greg rearranged his position so he was sitting cross-legged, facing John. “I should be asking you that one. The camp director pulled me aside on my way back here and said Sherlock has requested to switch group sessions to one-on-one sessions. With
Sherlock wasn’t sure how they had gotten to this point. The air between them was now thick with a history Sherlock had never been made privy to and John probably didn’t like reliving. There was an ache in Sherlock’s chest that wanted to know everything about John and where he came from, but he also had a strong desire to keep John from feeling any pain.
Without thinking, John’s feet led him to the doorway. Sherlock’s things were still strewn around the room, proof that he (sort of) lived there. The bed was unmade. His clothes hung in the closet, most likely in some kind of order that made sense only to Sherlock. There was a half-empty glass of water on the nightstand, right beside a thick medical book he’d snagged from John’s shelf. One night, when Rosie had been particularly fussy, Sherlock had read it aloud to her until she fell asleep. John had been both amused and besotted, though he hadn’t really known about the besotted part.
“D-da,” a plaintive, little voice said. John’s eyes widened. Sherlock tore his gaze away from John and looked down.
It faded seconds later when he took in the minute details. His skin was too pale, and he was standing unevenly, like he was supporting most of his weight on his left side. His right arm was pressed tightly to his side, and there was a grimace on his face.
sick, Sherlock. You’re going through withdrawals. You can barely get out of bed, and you’re trembling. I can see it through the covers.”
one had to make. It was all hateful, and Sherlock wanted to be done with it. Facing John was a better choice than spending another moment there.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth. There was an excellent chance that the blurriness in his vision was due to tears, but he didn’t want to cry because he was so incredibly…
“I’m going to prepare her a bottle,” John said roughly. “Best to give her something now.” He left the room without another word, leaving Sherlock there, confused. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel like moments like those were happening more frequently, and he didn’t know what to make of it.
Sherlock wasn’t going to give Rosie a kiss – a small attempt at self-preservation – but then Rosie fixed her big eyes on him and he was lost. Ignoring the pang in his chest, he walked over and bent down to brush his lips over her head.
John looked around at the sitting room. At the stains and holes and general mess. At his chair, sitting opposite its companion.
"I kept telling myself I had it under control, that I didn’t have a problem. Because I thought I was smarter than that. I truly thought I could stop myself from getting addicted.” He laughed bitterly. “I suppose that’s where I’m actually quite thick. I think I’m above these sort of things.
He still wasn’t completely sure why he asked the director to do this for him. He loathed the idea of talking to someone about his “problem” (Something that was losing its need for quotation marks more and more each day) and dealing with their insipid questions and advice. No one would understand, and he didn’t want to talk to anyone who didn’t understand. He dealt with those people every day of his life because he had to; he didn’t want to willingly submit himself to it.
He was rewarded with a pleased smile from Sherlock, and that honestly made eating the same dinner two nights in a row worth it. The fact that Sherlock might cock it up didn’t occur to him for another five minutes, and by that point it was too late. Though if it did, it wouldn’t be too disappointing. John was used to not eating dinner.
John opened his eyes and turned to see Molly in the doorway, a steaming mug in her hand. She held it up, silently asking if he wanted it. A result of him being over frequently was she knew exactly how he took his coffee.
John believed he was the source of his happiness. It didn’t matter that John only thought of him as a friend; this was more than he could have ever hoped for.
“Harry was fifteen when Dad found her in bed with a girl. He threw a fit unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” John’s voice was distant, as though he was lost in his own head. “She had bruises for days.”
“Sherlock.” John slid into his path, stopping Sherlock from going any further. “I know you think I’m an idiot, but I’m not so much of one that I can’t tell when you’re hurt.”
After what felt like years, thanks to the woman’s constant smile as she watched Rosie, he finished paying and gathered all the bags in his arms. He managed a terse nod toward the woman before fleeing the store.
“Oh, I do,” Sherlock replied. He smirked when John moved to hit him before remembering he couldn’t. “I worry about her.”
“You need sleep, Sherlock.” John turned and left the room in search of blankets. “You’ve had a recent health crisis, you need to rest so you can feel better.” It took a bit of skillful maneuvering, but he managed to get the things he needed from the hall closet with only one arm. He returned with a stack of folded sheets and blankets balanced on his arm. Sherlock took them with a nod.
Sherlock looked away. He snatched up his mug and strode into the kitchen, leaving John to stare at his back.
Sherlock muttered something under his breath and stood up. He picked her sippy cup off the ground and set it on the counter before gathering his and John’s plates. His was mostly full, while John’s was nearly empty. The plates disappeared into the sink after being scraped off, and Sherlock turned the faucet on to begin washing them. John watched the whole time, the cold feeling in his chest nearly suffocating him.
“Yes, it is,” John said with such certainty that Sherlock wondered if he was still talking about Rosie. John coughed. “Would you just keep talking to her?”
“Only if you promise it’s lunch and nothing else,” Sherlock said. “No going for a walk after or anything.”
Things continued to be difficult in the days following. There was no word from Sherlock or Mycroft, no sign as to when (if, John’s brain traitorously reminded him) Sherlock would return home. Each day passed in a blur of monotony and stress. Each night dragged on sleepless hour after sleepless hour.
“Sherlock,” said John, his hand digging into his knee. “I am so sorry. So very sorry. I shouldn’t have hurt you. You didn’t
The girl smiled, causing a grin to form on Lestrade’s face as well. “Like hold hands, and dates, and texting?” She asked, the words almost jumbled together in their haste, already the hopeful expression breaking out over all her face.
“Sherlock!” John said. Sherlock’s words of rage turned to sand inside his mouth, as he recognised the alarmed expressions on the people in front of him. He turned around and encountered the king’s kind and genuine grin beaming back at him. “Hi, I-” The blonde said as he placed a quick kiss over his forehead. The other fussed with his curls, but was otherwise unreactive. The information that had just been dumped on him was keeping him inert, nailed in place by its severity. John adjusted the strap of his bag, arranging his official blazer; but his eyes not leaving his boyfriend.
He sat on the floor, reaching his two shaking hands forwards. The brunette sighed and closed his eyes; and pretended to ignore the image of the carcass of a person ingrained inside his mind; and the real reason why he had to do this, and how stupid he felt doing it. He ignored everything and let himself drift. He twirled the words over in his mind, until the intention started to define and make itself clearer. As the spell ate away at his mind, a surge of a picture became apparent; and before he knew it, he had left the stinky torture and was sitting crosslegged on the smooth floor of a different room. Around him, there were no more padded paneling, no crazy asylum of horrors, but the clichéd villainous decoration of quite a familiar office.
“Mate,” He said using the term he had heard John apply with the function of familiarity, Sherlock, even if always gloomy, could say he was mildly impressed with the uncharacteristic insightful observation. “We don’t want any trouble.” Greg said, and hands came down to be stuffed inside the pockets of his leather jacket.
“It’s Molly, right?” He asked, his deep voice resonating on the powder yellow tiled walls. Did everything in the kingdom just had to be some shade of pastel colour? Have darker shades never been introduced to these stumbling humans?
The boy with the violet-coloured hair rolled his eyes in exasperation and gestured the others to keep going, he couldn’t wait to get away from the scene and back home.
Apart from the jest, Sherlock could deduce he truly considered the day to have been exceptional, and in a way the boy agreed with that, down to his bones, so he said: “Oh, piss off.” There was no need to let Greg be aware of that and suddenly believe he could start acting like he had an idea all on his own which the rebel actually regarded as true. His friend grimaced and shoved his shoulder in retaliation, stepping aside and throwing his arms up in exasperation.
A stab through the heart would have been less painful, the boy figured as he tried to ignore the sole truth. Because she was right, he was about to lose John, before he even sincerely had him —a love-spell was cheating at best— and despite knowing it from the very beginning, hearing the affirmation come from such an honest individual made it all the more tangible, more
“An opportunity to do what, exactly? Destroy us?” She snarled, her perfect, white teeth bared in a surprisingly savage manner. “You all remember, don’t you?” She turned around, addressing the adults present, specially the King and Queen, who had already gathered close to find out more about the commotion. “The poisoned apples, the curses?” That last word had more weight for John’s father than Sherlock had anticipated, he had been ignorant on how affected the prince’s family still was at his father’s previous beastly condition. “My daughter was raised by fairies because of your mother.” Margaret said, while Sally was smirking at his left, her smile growing with every sentence uttered. “Her first words, her firsts steps, I missed them all.” She turned around and placed a hand over her eyes when recalling the sadness she felt for that.
“Sherlock Holmes doesn’t know something?” Lestrade replied, the amused tone was entirely not appreciated by the violet-haired boy. Greg chuckled along John and Irene, as Sherlock turned his accusatory gaze to the king: wasn’t he supposed to be on his side? “This really
but at the very least they weren’t as cynical about their true interests as Moriarty was. Greg shared a glance with him, a quick look of apprehension in turn to display the dread they all felt. It was clear that none of the kids wanted to be reminded of the fact that their
The blonde turned to look at her with wide eyes, blinking at her as he studied her expression. “Are you sure?” He asked.
odd figure among a sea of devotion, with eyes fixed on the other’s back and a broken expression over his face.
“Donovan, what are you doing here?” He growled, his pale cheeks turning red from what The Woman could only assume was pure rage that she dared to involve herself in matters that were exclusively his and John’s —without, of course, counting E. and her pirate crew, and his own allies, and the threat to the whole realm.— But in his eyes, all of that seemed to be inconsequential.
