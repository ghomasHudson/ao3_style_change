But already, the musty stench of age and decay in the church had been covered up with the scent of roses. For the first time in months, Dean welcomed the scent. Closing his eyes, he breathed it in deep, allowing it to fill his lungs.
A minute went by. Then two. Then three. Finally the door opened just wide enough to reveal a man in his late thirties wearing a black shirt with a white collar and a cross around his neck. He stared at Dean with a look of confused recognition.
Dean ran past broken stained glass windows and crumbling saint statues until he reached the chapel corridor.
But there was one thing Castiel never forgot, even as the decades turned into centuries and centuries turned into millennia.
As he got closer, Castiel could tell from the small crowd of onlookers that had started to move and disperse along the street that the procession had already begun. He listened for the muffled sound of shouts in Latin and followed them down a side street until he came upon the crucifixion procession. Castiel pushed himself through to the front of the crowd.
sitting at the right hand of Our Father’s throne? Judging the living and the dead?” Uriel chuckled bitterly. “The idea is laughable.”
Sam had to have faith. In a world where myth and legend were reality, tangible and visible, he had no reason not to. Sam
He didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve the suffering and pain. He didn’t deserve death. He wished more than anything that God would take the pain away from him. He wanted to hear His voice. Just once. But God was silent. Cold and distant.
The first thing Dean saw when he rounded the corner were the bodies of the demons that stood in the entrance.
:: Witch trials were pretty common in Connecticut in the mid-late 17th century. Ten occurred in Hartford alone between 1662 and 1663, thirty years before the more famous Salem, Massachusetts trials. None, however, occurred in Bethlehem. That's purely artistic licence on my part.
As Castiel made his way back to his post, he saw the glow of torches off in the distance, breaking through the dark and fog. They shone a low light on the figures of a squad of men that were making their way through the garden.
Mary’s face grew serious. “And if you had grown up safe and happy in Lawrence, you would have still ended up here, angel. You have always been the Messiah, and Sammy has always been… your opposite.” Mary pulled the bottle back. When she lifted him up, Dean saw blood trickling down the side of his mouth.
… Sammy,” Dean sobbed, this time in English. He was nearly motionless as he lay spread across the back seat. “I— I can’t move my hands.”
There was pain and sorrow in Lucifer's frost-covered eyes. Dean could see it plain as day. But behind it was something else. Something sinister. Rage. Hatred. Malice.
Then Sam noticed the blood dripping from Lilith’s mouth, running down her chin.  As soon as the first drop hit the floor, it turned into a thick, twisted, line. Slowly creeping and curling around the floor like a snake.
, he reminded himself firmly, was in March. The date was wrong and the story that accompanied it was a lie. Christmas was hollow. Empty.
Smoke billowed from the man’s mouth, falling to the ground in a never-ending wave and filling the air with the rotten stench of sulfur. When the smoke finally cleared, the man the demons left behind collapsed against the sarcophagus with a thud, utterly still.
The embers under Dean’s skin were growing hotter by the second, red hot and crackling. They spread through the whole of his body, stronger than he had ever felt them before. Dean looked around at the parishioners. “You think just paying lip service to God is your Get Outta the Apocalypse Free card? It’s not.”
It blended viciously with the burning pressure in his lungs, radiating throughout the whole of his chest, growing more intense with each passing moment. Then suddenly, it stopped. Cold. The visions faded and the pain ceased, giving way to silent stillness.
?” Bobby blinked. He paused and chuckled. “Let me guess, it was Mary Magdalene and her sarcophagus is buried underneath the Louvre.”
Dean was silent. Without saying a word, he pushed the sleeves of his jacket up and placed his arms on the table, his wrists facing upwards.
. The old leather smell of the Impala’s cabin gave way to the stench of bodily fluids and dirt. It was followed by a feeling of rope burn around his forearms and the pointed pressure of cold iron against the flesh and tendons of his inner right wrist.
Dean rested his head against the cool window of a pickup truck’s passenger seat. He stared with half-open eyes out at the empty fields of grass along Kansas Highway 25. Frost covered and gray, the landscape was utterly void of life for miles in any direction.
She had been feeling movements like that for weeks, first as nearly indescribable flutters. Now they were getting more pronounced. Now, she knew what they were. They were
Dean climbed his way out of the ravine. As he was brushing himself off, he heard soft groans coming from the area of where Castiel's body was.
Bobby heard Sam’s scream all the way from the library. His voice was distant, an echo from deep within a pool of dark water. He opened his eyes to find himself sitting at his desk, a pile of books resting underneath him. As he lifted his head, a yellowed page stuck to his face.
disemboweling you.” Lucifer hissed, his voice slithering like a snake. “But I’ll get my chance soon enough. Until then, here’s a taste of what I’m going to do to you.”
Dean paused, glancing between the two of them. “You noticed the smell the moment I walked in here, right? The smell of roses? Shit, I’ve been on the road for more than two weeks; I should smell like a fuckin’ dumpster. It’s the Odor of Sanctity. And that’s not all.” He watched Susan and Jacob. Once their guns were lowered, he moved his hands from his head. Dean rolled up the sleeves of his jacket and tugged on his sweatshirt, pulling them up just enough to expose the blood-marked bandages around his wrists. “I’ve also got
Castiel followed them at a safe distance to a garden called Gethsemane, located at the foot of the Mount of Olives. He paced around the edge of the garden, moving in between the twisted olive trees, his sword safely tucked inside the sleeve of his rough wool tunic.
Eventually, Sam’s search worked its way back into the bathroom. The only things out of place were Dean’s bloodstained shirts, left behind after Sam had patched him up. Sam found them in a crumpled mess on the floor in the space between the toilet and the bathroom counter.
Mary shook her head. “You don’t understand what you’re asking of me.” She wiped the tears from her eyes. “This is too big.”
Dean was not in the mood for Christmas this year. He had many reasons not to be. Sam had been in the wind for nearly seven months, since Lucifer’s release.
Detective Connolly scoffed. “Honestly? Not much. According to her coworkers, she left her dayshift on the neonatal unit at the hospital around 6 PM Saturday night. Her husband called the hospital when she didn’t arrive home. Hospital security found her car, abandoned in the top level of the parking garage around midnight.
The poking tightness around his head had stopped, as had the throbbing pain on his back, once again becoming that ache he had come to know so well in the last week. This pain was different than any Dean had ever known, different from any pain he’d felt before he died,
Jesus shook his head. “First, I was to be the messiah of my people,” he let out a wearily breath. “Now I’m supposed to save the world?”
Dean stared at it before he put the glass to his lips, taking a sip from it. He spit it back out, his eyes wide with shock, wiping his mouth with his hand as he put the glass back on the nightstand. It didn’t taste of bitter grapes and alcohol, but the stale taste of metal and salt.
Dean quickly wiped the tears away, nodding his head. “Yeah, he did.” He took a deep breath as he faced Sam. “You’re not gonna believe it though… maybe
“Right.” Castiel took his shoes and jacket off before climbing into the bed, wrapping his arms protectively around Dean. “How was the first night of Hunnukah?” He said, his breath brushing against Dean’s neck.
kind of hunt. Finally, he came upon what he could only hope was a poltergeist in Northwest Missouri. Sam protested, but the rest of the week was spent on Interstate 70.
Balthazar quickly untied the ropes from Jesus' arms and placed the crossbeam on Castiel’s shoulders. Jesus groaned loudly as his hands fell limp to his sides. Slowly, he looked up at Castiel, squinting through the blood, “Castiel?” he rasped.
But despite his hope, Bobby knew the truth: Dean either wasn’t coming back at all or, if he was, he would be coming back as something else.
and you certainly don’t believe it now. What the angels did—whatwe did—was wrong. You know that better than anyone. From the moment Jesus climbed out of the Jordan River, you never left his side. You walked with him to Golgotha.” Anna glanced down the road, looking at Dean. She watched him climb into the backseat of an oil truck before she turned her gaze back to Castiel. “Please, Cas. You have to stop this before it goes too far,” she pleaded, grabbing his hand.
After a fifteen minute drive down Route 42, they arrived at a small lake with a single boat launch, quiet and secluded.
Dean’s hands gripped around the steering wheel of the Impala, his eyes moving from mirrors to windshield and back again, in a timed, rhythmic motion.  He only broke the pattern to play with the radio and to gaze quickly at the ‘Minnesota Welcomes You’ sign along the side of I-90.
Jesus scoffed. “You’re still better at reading The Torah than I am. You also understand it better than I do.”
Dean’s smirk faded as the whiskey burned its way down his throat, numbing him. The alcohol suppressed the weeping and gnashing of teeth he had brought with him out of the grave. It made it easier to tuck it back into a corner of his mind, though never doing so completely.
“You don’t think you're worthy of this,” Castiel’s words were matter-of-fact. “The same way you thought you didn’t deserve to be saved from Hell. But trust me Dean,
Tom pulled the truck over and Dean climbed of the cab. The cold air attacked him, but soon it faded. With each step Dean took closer to the church, he could feel the heat course through his veins, blazing strong. By the time Dean pried its door open, his entire body felt as though it were awash in flame.
“Once the Nazarene is dead, we’ll make sure that the brothers and sisters you led astray are handed over to Naomi and dealt with. You can thank Uriel for that, he was loyal enough to come forward and beg that their lives be spared,” Zachariah hissed, his eyes narrow. “As for you? Anna convinced Michael to spare you. And because you’re one of our best soldiers, we will, but this is your last chance. The next time you defy a direct order, brother, it will be your last.”
Dean took a deep breath as he dropped the tree down on the floor. “I still don’t get why you’re bothering with this thing. You never get a Christmas tree and this year ain’t exactly chipper,” he said, anxiety at the impending apocalypse gnawing at the back of his mind.
“Don’t mention it.” Bobby patted him on the shoulder as he sat down at the table across from Sam, sliding one of the books over.
:: While in popular culture and in Christian tradition Mary Magdalene is often thought to have been a prostitute, in the actual text of the gospels this is not the case. The Gospel of Luke and Mark describe her as being a women whom Jesus cast out seven demons (one common theory for the demons being that they were a metaphor for seizures.) In the gospels of Mathew, Mark and John she witnesses both the crucifixion and the resurrection. In the Gnostic Gospel of Phillip, Mary is described as being Jesus’ ‘companion’ whom he would ‘kiss often on the mouth,’ the implication being that they were married.
Sam was silent. He focused on the scarlet gashes that marked the whole of his brother’s back. They were jagged and deep in chaotic clusters of three. They were scourge wounds.
Jesus grew quiet. He looked at the front of the synagogue where the podium was situated. Behind the podium was a cut out in the wall covered by an embroidered curtain, behind that lay a wooden Torah ark where the scrolls where kept. Jesus and his father had built it just before his bar mitzvah. Normally, looking at it made Jesus' heartache. Now it caused a spark within him.
“I know.” Anna sighed. “But putting Dean on a path to fulfill his destiny won’t prevent that from happening again.”
who could have broken the first seal.” Castiel’s voice was honest and soft. “This isn’t the first time seals have been broken.” He paused. “When Jesus lived, we were also on the path to Armageddon. His death is what
Castiel stiffened in the seat next to him. “I haven’t heard that language spoken in centuries,” he said mournfully. “It’s strange to hear it again.”
“You are not the same man. Despite sharing the same soul and you bearing the same wounds You and Jesus are two
The mother froze instantly. Her eyes focused hard on Dean as she slowly walked back over to him, reverence flooding her face. “You’re—
“I know.” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “I just want my brother back.” He paused, his hands gripping tightly around the steering wheel. “How much longer until I’m strong enough to ice Lilith?”
Sam got out of bed, giving Dean’s bandaged torso a quick glance before he crouched down. As carefully and quietly as he could, he opened the drawers of the nightstand between their beds, searching for the hex bag he was hoping—
“No. Shortly after Jesus’ death, I was forced to return to Heaven. The first thing I did was look for him. I searched for his soul—desperately—through all the heavenly spheres, but I could never find it.” Castiel paused. “But…I did find his soul again. Eventually. I stood in its presence for the first time in twenty centuries, five months ago.” He locked his eyes on Dean. “When I pulled
Sam shook his head. “I’m not here for Mardi Gras.” He cleared his throat. “My name is Sam Winchester. Pamela Barnes sent me here."
Dean wiped the blood from his cheeks, his expression hardening. Without a single word, he turned and headed over to his bed where he grabbed his jacket. He shoved his feet into his boots and walked over to the door.
” He ripped the bandages off of his wrists and held them in front of him. His eyes narrowed sharply. “Would you wanna go through this?”
Sarah had been dead for nearly twenty years.  She had been the eldest daughter, the first after a string of boys.  At the age of six, two seasons after Jesus' Bar Mitzvah, she was stung by a yellow scorpion.
“Bullshit. Don’t lie to me,” John snapped. “You’re having such a hard time with this because you’re scared. Because you’re a coward.”
“I am sick of listening to you boss me around. I’m sick of listening to you dictating my life with that self-righteous attitude of yours,” Sam hissed, clenching his teeth. “I’m doing
Sam took a drive over to Saint Alphonsus Church, a Catholic church a few miles away from the motel. Wooden and painted bright white, it looked more like an old Congregationalist or Baptist church than a Catholic one, save for the Virgin Mary grotto out front. Sam walked slowly up the path, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jacket. He hesitated, taking a deep breath before he rang the doorbell to the rectory.
Castiel moved quickly through the halls of the dungeon, smiting demons and hellhounds in his wake, searching until he found The Righteous Man. Even among the smoke and sulfur, his soul still glowed, though some of the smoke had started to stick upon it like tar pitch.
So when Dean decided to turn a pit stop for gas off of Interstate 35—halfway through a ten hour drive from Bobby’s House to Oklahoma City—into a full-on break, Sam was expecting it. They had gotten a late start so both of them were tired and with it being his birthday, Dean wanted to spend as much of the evening as possible relaxing and enjoying himself. It was when Dean made mention of going to an Evangelical church in the morning that Sam couldn’t stay quiet any longer.
His eyes then focused on the man the soul belonged to: Dean Winchester. A man who thought so little of himself, though he had no cause to. He was a man of great courage, strength, and loyalty, who gave so much of himself and expected nothing in return.
don’t understand,” she snapped. “I’ve dreaded this the day from the moment I felt you move within me.” Her voice shook. “When the archangel Gabriel spoke to me and told me what you were.
It was the only prayer Dean ever really said. Pastor Jim had taught the prayer to him when he was a little boy and while he didn’t say it much, if ever, he knew the words by heart.
“It’s not the road that matters, Dean, it’s the destination.” Zachariah shrugged. “And you’re exactly where we need you to be.”
“I’m fine. Listen, you gotta get outta here!” Sam winced sharply, panic filling his voice. As she got closer to him, Sam noticed a scent wafting faintly around her, a smell he had gotten all too good at picking up on, the smell of sulfur. His hand was reaching into the pocket of his jeans where Ruby’s knife was just as her eyes flickered black. Before she could do anything, Sam stabbed her in the chest with it.
An odor Dean never could forget filled his nostrils, one that choked him with fear. The stench of pitch-black smoke and sulfur. The stench of bile, excrement, rot and decay. Pungent, vile and suffocating.
Dean winced, despite Castiel’s gentleness. “How the hell am I supposed to do that when I don’t even know what the final seal is?”
“Dean has stigmata,” Ruby’s words were sincere and blunt as she stood up from the bed. “Not only that, he’s the Chosen One for the Light Side of the Force. I get why you were keeping it under wraps. It’s smart of you do to it. But you don’t have to keep it from me.”
“That’s not my life, Lisa.” Dean glared, shaking his head. “That’s not supposed to be my life. It never was.”
“No.” The angel shook his head. “Every Prophet reaches despair at one point or another. The fact that you resisted is victory enough.”
“I’m not just “some dick angel”, Dean,” he raised his voice slightly. “I’m Zachariah. Castiel’s superior.”
Slowly, Sam picked the cards up and began to shuffle them; slipping the cards and going overhand with the deck a few times before he cut them into three piles, putting them back together on the table and sliding it back to Estelle.
Voices flooded his head. A cacophony of voices. Multitudes. Not in English. Not in Latin or even Aramaic.
Dean dropped the fringe and stood up from the bed. He changed his bandages and clothes before leaving the room, making his way down the stairs and into the kitchen.
By the time they had settled in for the night, Jesus' patience was wearing thin. It had been ever since they’d arrived in Jerusalem for the festival.
Castiel was never sure which angel took the body or where they took it, just as he was never sure which angel planted visions and thoughts in the heads of the Apostles and Jesus’ family.  Zachariah, Naomi, Michael or maybe some from his garrison who wanted Jesus' mission to live on in a different form.  He wasn’t given the chance to find out because as soon as the cloaking sigils he carved into his vessel healed over, he was pulled from Simon and taken back to Heaven.
The sun hadn’t even risen when Bobby made his way down into the basement and over to the panic room. He opened the slot on the door, peering into it.
like our cousin. A messenger of Hashem pulled you from the desert.” He glanced up to the sky. “Heaven is watching over you.  It will watch over us.”
already. Will you just—” Dean stopped just before he reached the stairs. He turned, facing Sam, frustrated. “Look Sam.
Father DeMatteo waved his hand, pinning Dean, Bobby, Jimmy and Amelia to one of the walls in the living room. “That’s not gonna work. We came here prepared. Hexbags and binding sigils so you can’t see us or smoke us out.”
He stopped and ran his wet hands down his face before gripping them around the side of the sink, his gaze fixed on his reflection. “Your name is
“It’s okay.” Dean’s voice was calm and reassuring. “You’re gonna be alright.” He quickly untied her and lifted her up out of the chair. He looked back at Jacob and Susan who were both frozen in shock. Walking past them, he shot both of them awkward glances as he carried the woman up the stairs to the front door.
Sam gripped the steering wheel and glared, staring at the worn leather. “What? I’m not good enough for you, you winged dick? Is that it?” Sam grumbled. “Show yourself goddamn it!”
He collapsed on top of Ruby with a groan. Once his climax faded, Sam slid out of her and turned onto his side. Fulfilled, he gently ghosted his fingers, over her shoulder and down her arm until he reached her fingertips, where he laced his fingers with hers.
Dean grabbed it, unraveling the cord and cutting it with scissors before threading it through the amulets. He stood up from the workbench, brushing himself off before picking the amulets up. He followed Bobby into the dining room where Amelia and Claire were sitting at the table.
“I got into a pretty heated debate about what constituted work on the Sabbath with a bunch of rabbis there once. We came to a conclusion that it’s not work if it’s for the preservation of life. ‘
Dean sank down onto the pavement, pressing his palms to his tear filled eyes as his chest swayed back and forth slowly.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Apparently.” A shaken chuckle left his mouth as he started to trudge his way back over to the armchair.
. You were born January 24th, 1979. You’re an Aquarius and a Goat. Your father’s name is John and your mother’s name is-” Dean paused. “Mary.” Dean pursed his lips, sighing as he dipped his head. “Son of a
Sam sped the whole way back to the motel, the sound of his brother’s labored half-breaths and shaken cries filling the cabin.
person you went to,” Bobby pointed out. “You sold your soul for him, Dean. You’re gonna sit here and tell me you could just up and leave him?” He glanced down to the blood stained bandages around Dean’s wrists. “Especially now?”
, did He?” The question played on his tongue with fear as he stepped out of the pew and into the aisle.
Dean cocked an eyebrow. “I’ve heard of clergy becoming hunters. I know some, in fact. But I’ve never heard of a hunter becoming a nun before.”
“I wanna get this over with.” Dean sighed deeply as he started to lift himself out of the chair. As he got to his feet, Sam placed his hands on his shoulders in an attempt to steady him. He instantly wrenched free from Sam’s grip, shooting him an angry look as he made his way out of the room.
Dean was sitting on the motel room couch; silently polishing his pistol. He’d cleaned it six times that week already, twice today alone, but he didn’t care. It was a distraction, one that he desperately needed.
—you’d be great at it.” She quickly picked the Bible up and held it out to Dean. “I’ll give it you for fifteen.”
Simon turned to walk inside. Jesus' fists clenched as he ran after him. He only got a couple steps before James jumped out in front of him, shoving his palms against his chest to hold him back.
:: Lent is a Christian liturgical season marking the forty days leading up to Easter, beginning on Ash Wednesday. It is celebrated mostly by Roman Catholic and Orthodox denominations, but is also celebrated by the Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches. It is intended to be a time of prayer, penance and self-denial, often in the form of fasting and abstaining from meat. Because of its connection to the death of Jesus, the stigmata are more likely to appear on person or bleed during this season.
Before long, however, the tributary dried up, and Jesus had ventured far out into the desert. Arid heat blistered his skin, pocking his hands and feet. Even with a scarf wrapped around his head, the sun had burnt him until his lips were cracked and his forehead had peeled away in uneven splotches.
“Judas was freed from the bondage of Sheol by that angel. Resurrected,” Simon declared. “He’s a walking miracle.”
Jesus didn’t say anything. He ran his hand down his face, shutting his eyes as he began to pace around the balcony.
They were making their way out of a Pick ‘N Save supermarket when Dean’s eyes caught sight of an older man sporting a Marine Corps sweatshirt and ‘VFW Post 7221’ baseball cap. He was sitting at a small table on the sidewalk just outside the entrance of the supermarket, a bucket labeled ‘DAV’ and a tray of silk poppy flowers resting on top of it.
“Consecrated? Sure is.” Bobby nodded. “Some stigmatics are able to survive on Communion in lieu of food. Figured it was worth a shot. Father Connolly over at Saint Michael’s brought it over this afternoon. I helped him out with a revenant a few years back so he don’t ask questions when I ask him for stuff like this.” He whispered a few things in Latin as he poured some of the wine into the shot glass, carefully sliding it down to the end of the table.
:: Although Jesus' actual name would have been 'Yehoshua', I chose to use the common, anglicized version of Jesus's and The Apostles' names purely for the sake of accessibility.
Sam was cut off as Dean groaned loudly, clutching at his temples. He collapsed to the floor, tears of blood streaming down from his eyes. His body was wracked with pain. Different from the pain he felt when he bled. This pain didn’t bring with it doves and stained glass, but memories of smoke and sulfur.
Dean sat at the table, listening as Sam and Bobby’s chatter became snores accompanied by the sounds coming from the TV. His eyes shifted over to the Bible and prayer card Bobby had pulled out the night before, resting on a corner of the table along with the first aid kit. Dean reached over and grabbed it, sliding the plate away as he placed The Bible in front of him. He thumbed through the pages for a while, his eyes briefly scanning them, before he closed it again.
When he finished, slowly, Jesus let go of the scrolled and backed away from the podium as the rabbi grabbed the scroll and rolled it back up and placed it back in the ark. Jesus turned to him, gesturing to the ark. “Now, this scripture has been fulfilled.”
As he fell, the night chilled concrete driveway disappeared, turning into a dusty and parched white brick alleyway bathed in burning late morning sun. The shouts of Roman Soldiers and the cracking of their whips echoed through Dean’s ears.
He heard leaves crunching on the ground from the direction of the house. He turned his gaze, finding Castiel advancing towards him, dressed in a black suit and the familiar tan trenchcoat. The blue tie hung untied around his neck.
“—If this is to be my fate, then it is to be my fate.” Jesus shrugged, tapping the rim of the cup with his thumb.
Dean raised his voice, disgusted. “No.” The word barely left his mouth when he cleared his throat. “No.” This time it was placid. Apathetic. “I’m not hungry.”
He looked down at his hands, his gaze locking on his wrists. There were no wounds, no bruises with little drops of blood rising up from them. Only scars. Purple raised scars in rough circles marking the front and back of his wrists. Angry and fresh. The same was true of his ankles.
“It ain’t so bad.” Dean shrugged as he pulled his arms back and lowered his sleeves. “I’ve been through worse.”
“It frightens me,” Jesus said honestly, taking a deep breath. “Part of me even wishes that Hashem chose someone else.” Jesus shook his head. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t have faith.” He looked at Castiel. “To have Faith means you must wrestle with it.”
“I didn’t need to know that Bobby,” Dean grumbled, tossing his duffle bag on one of the motel room beds.
“Up to snuff.” Zachariah’s words were blunt. “You’ve managed to beat most of your character flaws, shockingly enough. But you’ve still got to get that Hell grime off of your soul. Once you become the Spotless Lamb, you’re going to ride into battle and lay waste to Satan and his army. Paint the ground red with blood. After that you’re going to assume the throne and judge the living and the dead. So on and so forth.”
“During the service, Joel informed my husband that you were here.” She smiled at him. “He’d like the chance to speak with you for a moment if that’s alright.”
Dean just looked at her and smirked. “Sweetheart, I’m the Saint of blasphemy.” He glanced around at the parishioners, watching as their grumbling turned into shouts before he made his way back down the aisle, Sam following behind him.
Castiel knew exactly what he had to do. He had practiced it so many times since the Righteous Man entered Hell, he could recite his task by rote. He executed the tests runs Naomi set out for him perfectly, over and over, until Naomi was certain he was ready for his mission.
“When you put it like that you make it sound stupid,” Dean said, taking a reluctant a sip from his coffee.
With the exception of an occasional barn or unlocked shed, shelter had been a rare commodity the last two weeks. More often than not, Dean had found himself curling up beneath an overpass or behind a dumpster in an alleyway.
“Damn it, Bobby.” He rolled his eyes, shoving the blankets off and throwing his legs over the side of the bed. He stared awkwardly at the shawl before running his hand over the stripes, making his way down to one of the long corner fringes, running its threads slowly through his fingers.
Jesus shifted his eyes between the two of them. He then glanced down at the dagger at Judas’ belt. Its blade was made of silver, etched in old Hebrew. Even though it was clearly old, it was razor sharp.
“I’m gonna go out for a while,” Dean said, making his way to the motel room door, the bundle of trench coat and tie under his arm.
“No. Y-you should go.” Jesus shook his head, his body half slumped. “You’re in enough trouble as it is.”
big. Dean crawls outta the grave courtesy of an angel—a creature no hunter has seen for two millennia—then a couple of days later, signs of the End Times start, followed by him turning into Padre Pio. It’s all connected somehow.”
Dean froze. “Listen Joel.” He cleared his throat. His eyes shifted nervously as he glanced at the parishioners filing out of the sanctuary who had started to give him odd looks, some outright staring at him. He squatted down on the floor, right at the little boy’s eye level. “I get that you’re excited and all but you gotta tone it down a bit, okay? I’m not really here for the whole “Second Coming” thing today.”
Sam stopped mid-stitch, his eyes locking on Dean. This wasn’t first time Dean had offered to heal him. There was his bruised rib in Michigan, a vampire bite in Tennessee, and a sliced arm in North Carolina. Dean offered to heal them all, but Sam had always refused.
Sam grabbed the bandages, laying them down on Dean’s side of the nightstand. He stared at his brother for a moment before he crawled back into his own bed without a single word.
During one of these bouts of prayer, Castiel visited Jesus and tried to comfort him. He sat with Jesus and healed away the blood he had been sweating. He asked Jesus to change his mind, to let Castiel fight his siblings, but again, Jesus refused and ordered Castiel to leave.
As Sam made his way out of the rectory and back to the parking lot, his eyes caught sight of a large crucifix on the far side of the small cemetery behind the church.  He walked over to the chain link fence closing the plot off and stared at the crucifix for a long moment before making his way back to the Impala. He fumbled slightly with the keys before he managed to get the door open, climbing into the driver’s seat; he closed the door with a thud.
of Gehenna comes with him.” He looked at Jesus. “And if he does come, you are the only one who can destroy him.”
The first card Estelle put down in the center of the table was Death. It was followed by The Tower, Strength, The Eight of Wands, The Star, The Devil, The Seven of Cups and The Priestess.
As he went to pour the second glass, a smell washed over him. The smell of roasted lamb and fresh baked bread.  With a blink, Bobby’s coffee table become a long, low table lit by the dim light of oil lamps and covered with a Seder plate. The glass and whiskey bottle turned into a wooden goblet and a clay jug of wine.
Miriamne nodded. “Most of your siblings are now married themselves. You still didn’t want to get married?”
Rufus smirked, taking the box and as he opened the door further  “Just so we’re clear, you’re not getting any. Call it atonement for the Middle Ages.”
Jesus cocked an eyebrow. “We?” Immediately he stopped sanding the table. He stood up straight, his gaze hard. “When I leave, you are not coming with me.”
Dean was sleeping in a bed in a Rufus spare bedroom. He wasn’t dreaming so much as remembering. Old memories.  He-
It was the suffering of memory. Of experience. Of one man’s untimely demise. It was suffering that was completely human. Vivid, horrific, tragic—but also sacred—mysterious, mystical, ecstatic.
“Why do you think those demons tried so desperately to get you to sell your soul? Why do think you were only given
“You were quoting scripture at me,”  Castiel rasped, planting soft kisses onto Dean’s scarred forehead. “You’re filled with fire. Like a Prophet. Sanctified and Holy.” He pulled his lips away, staring into Dean’s eyes, his lips coated in a light smear of bright red blood.
“Yes.” James nodded. “But on occasion, they speak the truth, if not for any reason other than to confuse.”
“He will stop Lucifer. He’ll have the help of the righteous man who started this whole mess in the first place, Judas of Kerioth.” She took a deep breath. “I’ve tasked our sister Asariel with retrieving him from Gehenna and giving him his mission.”
“Sam!” Dean rasped. He stumbled to his feet and ran to the chapel doors, pulling on the handles and pounding his hands against the wood.
Castiel paused. “I heard your prayer. Your confession, Dean. Jimmy could remember it when I took control of his body.”
He let go, sending Dean crashing into the ice. Dean gasped for breath, the ice scraping against him, sharp and cold. Before he could get up, Lucifer appeared in front of him, reaching down and grabbing him by the collar.
“It’s no big deal.” Dean shrugged. “Our Dad was a ‘Nam vet. Leatherneck too. ” He nodded, his eyes focusing on the man.
“I got lucky, I guess.” Sam shrugged. Standing up from his bed, he began walking towards the bathroom, folding the bath towel repeatedly between his fingertips. He only got a few steps away from his bed before Dean spoke again.
“Need to lay off the Jameson,” Dean mumbled to himself, scanning the bathroom once more. He flicked the light on and off a couple more times. “Shit’s makin’ you paranoid.”
Dean nodded reluctantly as he sat on top of one of Bobby’s filing cabinets, a tired sigh leaving his mouth. “Yeah. He said that I
“I flew to farm about a day’s journey from here. The woman wasn’t too pleased that I took her food, even after told her it was a holy sacrifice.” The angel recounted.  “She called me a—” He paused searching for the word. “ ‘Brigand.’”
“Cas showed up.” Sam’s voice was as blunt as it was awkward as he climbed into the driver’s seat. “He said you were ‘participating in the Lord’s Supper’.” A little chuckle left Sam’s mouth as he dug into his jacket pocket and pulled Dean's silver flask out, handing it to him. “I don’t know what’s
Dean was sitting in the Novak's garage, hunched over Jimmy’s old work table, a pile of wood chiseling tools and shavings strewn around him. With a thin, sharp chisel in hand, he carved a key of Solomon sigil in a round disk wood. When he was done, he held it up, squinting at it before blowing the loose wood dust off of it, brushing it with his fingers.
Jesus stopped in his tracks.  “I was the boy who asked too many questions and didn’t pay attention. I could barely read the Torah portion when I became a Bar Mitzvah.” Jesus paused. “Of course…
“Thanks.” Sam took a few bills from his wallet and put them down on the counter before he walked out. He crossed the street, heading back to his motel where the Impala was parked, taking his cell phone back out of his jacket.
The ground began to rumble and shake. A column of bright white light shot up passed the tree line and into the night sky, reaching into the clouds followed by the high pitched buzzing. With a high pitched whine, the white light exploded, casting the night away for the briefest of seconds as the trees curved and buckled against it.
:: Holy Week is the week just before Easter. It starts on Palm Sunday and lasts until Holy Saturday. One of the customs during this week is to cover statues and crucifixes purple cloths, the liturgical color of Lent as a symbol of mourning.
“Hey Sam,” her voice hummed. She walked over to him. “What’s up with you? You haven’t texted or called me
“Roses.” Dean’s words were blunt. “All I smell is roses. It smells like a Golden Girl got laid in here.”
“An exorcism seems a little extreme, your Excellency. Maybe Claire is confused.” Father DeMatteo said.
The words stopped and the pain receded.  When Dean came to, he found himself lying on the pavement, Bobby hovering over him.
“Like shit,” Dean scoffed. “I bled right through my damn bandages.” With Sam’s help he hobbled over to the table.
“Dean’s mission is to work miracles so that people may bear witness to him and know that he walks among them. So that they will still have faith when it is most tried.” Castiel’s words brimmed with conviction. “Victory is worth nothing if the flock is led astray.”
Bobby stared at the body for a long time before he narrowed his eyes at it. “Fuck it,” he rasped. He made his way over to the basement door, grabbing an axe as he made his way upstairs.
Before Dean could finish, Bobby ran over to him and hugged him, squeezing him tight. “You gotta stop dying on me son!” he cried.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, I guess.” A scoff left his mouth as he kicked the boots off, wincing as he shifted on the bed.
The longer Dean looked at it, the more his wounds began to ache again. He clenched his hands against the pain. “But that doesn’t mean it needs to end that way.” He turned his gaze to Castiel, his breath shaking. “No angel is gonna hang me up to die on a tree, Cas. I’m not gonna let it end that way.”
“How you holding up?” Sam asked. He winced as he pulled another stitch through his skin. He took a large gulp from the whiskey bottle, wiping up the blood that ran down his arm with a dingy bath towel that was quickly becoming more red than white.
Walking under the roof of the porch, Dean sighed, relieved at the mere prospect of a hot shower and somewhere safe to sleep before he walked over to the door. He took note of the iron cross hanging above the sill, before he rang the doorbell.
Sam leaned against the bathroom counter. “Damn it,” he hissed, folding his arms. His fingers drummed a tense rhythm against his ribcage.
Alastair walked over to the stake. His feet splashed up blood as he crouched down next to Dean. “So Dean, what’s your answer?”
He waited, hoping he’d hear the familiar flap of wings and the gruff voice that accompanied it, but nothing happened.
Sam’s expression froze in horror. After a moment’s hesitation, he walked over to Dean. Squatting down in front of him, he pulled the blanket down from Dean’s torso, glancing at his left side. “You don’t have The Spear?” He swallowed hard, dropping the blanket.
There was nothing but a Gideon Bible that was always stashed away in motel room nightstands. They were different colors, and in different parts of the country had different stages of wear, but they were always there. Sam had managed to read the whole thing, cover to cover, at least three times without ever buying a copy of his own.
“I’ll explain in the car.” Dean padded Bobby quickly on the shoulder before making his way to the front door.  “Right now, we gotta haul ass.”
Sam stood back up. He brushed his finger over the barbed wire cruelly pressed into Dean’s temple. “You know, that gives me an
Slowly, Dean stood and limped over to his bag. He pulled a long sleeved thermal from it. He also grabbed a hoodie from Sam’s bag and carefully got dressed, trying his hardest to not only remain standing but to avoid rubbing against his stitches. He had slept in his jeans and he wasn’t going to even attempt to take a shower, not with fresh stitches in his back.
“You gonna eat or are you gonna sit there and pick at your food like a stubborn toddler?” Bobby said through a bite of BLT.
Dean was quiet for a second. He swallowed. He scrunched his brow. “Intimidating. I guess. It was huge. Of course, there were Roman soldiers stationed on top of the outside court. Watching.”
“I know. I’m sorry, Bobby.” Sam took a deep breath. “You look exhausted. Why don’t you go take a nap? I’ll keep an eye on Dean.”
“I made these for you.” Dean held the amulets out to Amelia. “They’ll keep you safe. So will the devil’s trap we painted under the rug in the entranceway.”
It wasn’t the service itself that bothered him. The joining of two households under a canopy was a beautiful thing and he always enjoyed the feasts that followed. He loved the music, dancing, food and wine, reveled in them in even.
:: In both the gospels of John and Luke, Judas is described as being 'possessed by the devil' at the time of his betrayal of Jesus. In the  Gospel of Judas, a Gnostic text, it is said that he actually betrayed Jesus at Jesus' behest, being the only Apostle who truly understood Jesus' mission.
:: While stigmata is predominately a Roman Catholic phenomena, there have been a few cases of Protestants receiving the wounds as well.
Castiel was silent as he rung out the cloth and started to wash Dean’s head. “Soldiers mend each other’s wounds during battle. This is no different.” A sigh left his mouth as he moved on to Dean’s feet.
:: While Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe that the Virgin Mary remained a virgin her whole life, most Protestant denominations believe that Jesus had biological siblings.
But Dean couldn’t ignore it. He couldn't distract himself. Ringing out over the sound of hammer, over Dean’s sobs, was a voice. Nasally. Boisterous. Mocking. It was a voice Dean had come to know all too well. A voice Dean had come to fear and loathe, one that always promised more pain.
Zachariah’s body stiffened with anger. “You can’t make that decision, Dean,” he warned, narrowing his eyes.
than that. There’s a lot more hurt coming Dean’s way and even though he ain’t gonna say it, he’s gonna need you to be there for him.”
the messiah; he was Jesus reincarnated. By celebrating Christmas, Dean was celebrating himself, which didn’t sit well with him.
“How?” Sam’s question was weighted with fear as much as confusion. As far as he was aware, their mother hadn’t been a virgin when she gave birth to Dean so virgin birth was impossible. Maybe Dean was made a Nazarite in the womb like Samson or John the Baptist, maybe he was the last heir to the Line of David or the Desposyni. Maybe Dean was just like
“Yeah.” Sam nodded, clearing his throat. “They’re also known as the Five Sacred Wounds.” His shoulders hunched slightly.
“Yeah? Well I say it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven!” Dean shouted, his fists clenching.
“Yeah. You are.” Sam pulled away from Ruby just long enough to unlock the door. As soon as it was open, he grabbed her again, pushing her into the motel room. While she stumbled out of her boots, Sam kicked the door shut behind them. He kicked his boots off and jerked his hoodie and t-shirt over his head and tossed them onto the floor. Without missing a beat, he ripped Ruby’s flannel open. Buttons flew like shrapnel while he yanked it off of her.
Her fingers lingered briefly on the doorknob before she flung it open, the knife raised defensively as she rushed into the room.
Dean nodded his head weakly. Heavy, pained breaths left his mouth. “It feels like barbed wire wrapped around my fuckin’ head…”  His voice cracked while he tugged at the gauze.
that he’s getting stronger on top of it. She’s going to go after him, sooner rather than later, because once he’s at full Pinball Wizard capacity, that’s it. Game over. You’ve gotta kill her
“Well…” Sam took a notebook and pen out of the pocket of his jacket. “I noticed during my research and even in your book that there’s not a lot of set lore—
Sam scoffed. “But he is. He’s more of a father to me than John ever was and once he rises I’ll inherit the Earth.” He grinned. “And I’ll have you—The Righteous Man—to thank for it.”
“Well.” Dean cleared his throat. “I was passing through and I kinda needed a place to crash. If it’s not too much trouble, I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind putting me up for the night.”
:: The Gospel of Mathew mentions that at the time of Jesus' death, 'The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.'
: They’d stop the torture if I got off the rack and tortured souls myself. Every day I told them to go
Sam did the same, finding himself on a small, dirt access road long since forgotten about. overgrown with brush and trees, the sound river water echoing through his ears.
The singer of the church’s band, a red-headed woman, stepped forward. “You can’t say that. That’s blasphemy.”
“Jacob, who was that at the door?” Susan, Jacob’s wife, waddled into the living room, one of her hands pressed protectively against her stomach, the large swell making the purple fabric of her sweater tight.
“No.” Judas took a pull from the goatskin. “There’s just so much suffering and pain. Not just among our people, but out in the world. And evil. Real evil. I’ve seen so much of it.” Judas paused. “I used to doubt if Hashem was even there. I didn’t know and I was fine with that because at least then I didn’t have to wonder why He allowed such things. Now I
The demon wearing Bishop Tamsen appeared behind Claire, his eyes black pools. He grabbed her, holding a knife to the throat.
’ I think is what they called it.” Dean paused, smirking at Rufus. “I’m pretty sure digging up graves and digging burn pits on hunts fall under that category.”
The light became the rising sun—a swirl of early morning clouds lit in shades of oranges and pinks— and the cool air of the bathroom turned hot and arid.
With that, James walked into the house. A few minutes later, he returned with a cake, setting it down without a word.
“Yeah. I’ve been doing research.” Sam’s voice was matter-of-fact. “I’ve been trying to figure out what happened to you.”
Castiel listened to the chatter coming from inside the room connected to the balcony while the smell of roasted lamb and freshly baked matzo wafted around him. Eight men with thick Galilean accents laughed and joked with one another, their voices slurred by wine. Peter debated the finer points of net tying with his former fishing partners, the Zebedee brothers, and his own brother Andrew.
Uriel lifted himself out of the pile of broken wood and barreled towards Castiel. He grabbed him and tossed him onto the stage, taking the pulpit and some chairs with him as he slid across the floor.
gonna now.” Dean clenched his fists. “I don’t give a shit what you do to me. You wanna nail me back up? Go
“It’s no problem.” Dean cleared his throat. “Just don’t tell anyone what happened, okay? Pastor Jacob is a good man and I don’t want him gettin’ in trouble.”
Jesus looked up at him, his eyes staring at him with certainty. “We’ll see each other again. You know that.”
see you again,” he murmured. Grace flashed throughout his hand, soaking into Jesus’s tunic and down into his tender skin. Even though it left a mark behind, Jesus was too bruised and bloody for anyone to notice it.
“Have you looked at yourself in a mirror lately?” Sam scoffed. “At the rate you’re going, Dean, you won’t
:: The idea that Hell has nine layers comes from the Divine Comedy, a three-part epic poem written by Dante Alighieri in the early 14th Century. The first work-Inferno- depicts each layer of Hell being dedicated to one specific sin, each one worst than the last. The ninth layer -Treachery- is where Satan dwells. The idea that Satan is trapped in ice is also from The Divine Comedy.
After cutting cut the ropes, Jesus and James walked the man back to the road were the Apostles were still waiting. They gave the man some food and water, before taking him to the city where they searched out a blacksmith to remove the chains. They had barely entered the city gates when the inhabitants crowded around them, demanding that they leave.
“You finally found a girl you like, nephew?” he slurred. “We should put the both of you under the canopy get you wed now, while there’s still time. It’s bad luck if you’re not married by thirty.”
The sound of flapping wings filled Dean’s ears. With it, the bright light disappeared. The Convent became a forest. Dark and cold. Cloaked in night.
The desperate, hopeful prayer of a little boy who lacked an understanding of mortality and wanted his mother back, the doubt-filled prayer of a young man who understood mortality far too well and longed for a cure for a young woman with a brain tumor. There were prayers that were actually intended to be conversations with a ghost and prayers that sounded more like blasphemes, but they were prayers nonetheless, even if Dean never realized it. Castiel had heard them all.
“I mean it. You need to eat, my son. You look ill.” Mary said, cupping his hollow cheeks. She paused briefly. “And next Sabbath, promise me you’ll stay quiet in the synagogue. Just listen like you always do,” she pleaded, her face flooding with worry. “I don’t want you and your brothers getting into any more fights.”
Castiel watched as they gave such visions to a man called Saul of Tarsus. They did so because he could write and speak Greek, was a Roman citizen and could travel around the empire and had no problem spreading his ideas among pagans. But most importantly, he never knew Jesus. The angels could fill his head with all manner of ideas that they could never to do to men and women who had known him.
“Dean, listen.” Sam sighed, picking the bloody bath towel up from his bed. “I didn’t have a choice. He was gonna kill you and—”
Dean dropped Bobby off at the Motel before making his way to the church.  He walked inside, finding Castiel standing behind the altar, his gaze locked on the crucifix.
Three times he tried to step into the river, but every time he reached the water’s edge, he stopped.
Men who had traveled all that way had to be here for a good reason. Because of their dark clothes and the knives at their belts, at first, Jesus thought that they might be assassins, but he quickly abandoned that idea. If they were, Jesus would have been dead already.
Sam picked the shirts up and inspected them. A wave of the rose scent washed over him as he moved them. The blood stains covering them were still bright red, without even with the slightest sign of oxidation. Sam lifted the shirt up to his nose and smelled it. Immediately, he reeled back, lowering the fabric from his face. The stench was overwhelming, turning his gut in its concentration. But it wasn’t the metallic tang of iron and plasma, nor the familiar, comforting scent of motor oil or cheap cologne that always clung to his brother.
. When the page loaded, the top video had a screencap of a collapsed house that looked like a bomb had gone off inside of it. A flattened pile of rubble and angry, skeleton trees. The video had been uploaded only six hours previously and it already had fifty thousand views.
He nuzzled his way down her chest, wrapping his lips around one of her nipples. He sucked just hard enough to leave a deep red mark on her skin. Moving lower, he pressed his face just beneath the swell of her breast, where he could feel her pulse beating wildly.
Draped over his shoulders was a scarlet robe that was ripped and moth-eaten.  Just as he forced himself to his feet, he stumbled over a loose rock and fell back to the ground, the weight of the crossbeam slamming his face into the dirt with a thud and a whimper of pain he couldn't hold back.
After what felt like hours, Sam and Ruby found a metal chain link fence with a rusty ‘No Trespassing’ sign posted on top of it. A hole was cut into the fence at the bottom of it. Ruby slipped through effortlessly.
Dean had been snowed in at Rufus’ house for three days. It wasn’t until the following Monday that the roads were clear enough for him to leave. His time was spent lighting Hanukkah candles, eating and studying lore.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “He knew you winged jackasses were going to twist everything after you ganked him. He wanted to make sure there was something of his you
“No, I’m not here to take you to Heaven.” Without a second’s hesitation, Dean reached over and grabbed her hand, his larger callused hand engulfing her smaller one. “Did you…
“How bad is it, Sammy?” Dean rasped with pained breaths, his question equal parts boggled by fear and characteristically nonchalant.
“Angels are agents of Fate, Dean,” Castiel said, almost at a whisper. He turned and looked briefly at the crucifix hanging up above the altar. “We ensure that it plays out how it is meant to.” He paused. “One way or another.”
end with halos and harps. But Sam was still holding fast to the theory that it was Dean’s own mind that had caused the wounds, an explanation Dean hated even more. As far as Dean could tell, Sam wasn’t even looking for any others.
“I'm telling you that blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God and blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew 5:8 and 5:10.” Dean shrugged, an angry smile spreading across his face. “But who knows, I might be misquoting it.”
Jesus glanced at the finished set of mezuzah cases and placed the wine on the workbench. He approached his task for the day: a wooden table sitting flush against the back wall of the courtyard.
::The concept of Jesus' virgin birth appears only in two of the gospels, Mathew and Luke, and is never explicitly stated in any of Paul's letters. It is based mostly on an often ascribed messianic prophecy from the Book of Isaiah where, in the Greek translation of the text (the version used by the writers of Mathew and Luke), a "Parthenos" or "Virgin" is said to be with child. In the original Hebrew, however, the word used is "Almah" which means "Young Woman" and is a comment on her age rather than sexual experience.
“Chosen,” Judas scoffed. “Between the Egyptians enslaving us, the Babylonians exiling us, the Greeks and now the Romans oppressing us, it seems more like we’re cursed.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah. It is. But I’ve been praying…I guess.” He looked at Castiel. “And for
A few seconds later the church official came barreling at him, his eyes black as pitch. “What’s the matter Sammy? Lost your mojo?” he snarled.
“We really don’t need to do this. We’ve been to enough churches already.” Sam looked at him reluctantly.
The scars were a sign to Bobby of something he and Dean had already known. That the wounds were a part of him. They always had been. Tears streamed down Bobby’s face, and he wiped them away gruffly with the sleeve of his forearm.
It was then that she heard the sound. A sound she hadn’t heard before, different from the creaks and groans of the house which she knew well; this one almost sounded like the rustling of wings.
Thick, oily blood mixed with water ran down Dean’s side, pooling on the sleeping bag beneath his body. He was quiet and still. Motionless. Breathless. His head slumped against his chest.
Sam stepped back into the bathroom to grab some spare bandages, knowing Dean would need them in the morning. His eyes shifted over to the glass of water Dean had left on the counter, but it wasn’t water anymore. It was deep red. Reluctantly, Sam picked up the glass and smelled it. It was bitter with the smell of fermented grapes.
Walking back down the hall, Dean looked down at the hand that had healed Aleah. He stared at it for a long moment before he cupped it in his other hand, pressing his thumb hard into the center of his palm.
“Some believe that he is a fallen angel, cast down from Heaven because of his hatred for Humanity,” James said. “That he twisted the spirit of Cain into a demon as a slight against both Man and Hashem.”
He sat there quietly for a moment, his hands resting weakly on the steering wheel. His eyes looked over briefly at the empty passenger seat before he turned the ignition on and backed out of the parking space, taking the short drive back to the motel room that seemed to take an eternity.
In the back of his mind, Dean knew this was a bad idea. It was a bad idea going to a large church. It was a bad idea doing this the morning after his birthday while he was nursing a Jim Beam induced hangover. It was a bad idea being all of three towns over from Lawrence. In a different life, one without demons and monsters, he probably would have had a wrestling match at this town’s high school. It was too crowded, too early, and too close to home.
It took forever—and one heated argument over using the knife versus exorcism—but the brothers finally managed to get her into a devil’s trap painted hastily on the bottom of the living room area rug.
Dean was silent. His chest heaved as he glanced around the room, refusing to make eye contact with the angel.
, despite knowin’ Goddamn well what it was doin’ to me.” Dean’s eyes started to gloss over as he gritted his teeth. “Well, I
A few seconds later, the security camera on the porch turned towards him and a voice came billowing out of the tan color apartment inter-com just to the right of the door.
“Gotcha.” Dean saluted as he made his way back to the front door, closing it behind him. He made his way down the steps and over to the Impala, climbing into the driver’s seat. Starting the car, he turned the radio on.
. The Word made flesh, casually drinking beer with him on the hood of the Impala. All of this frightened Sam because it meant that the man he had known for twenty-five years as his older brother was dying again, if he wasn’t dead already.
Dean dragged his hand down his face as he ran out of the study. “Fuck,” he hissed. “We gotta find him. Now. And stop him.”
“Oh I am,” Zachariah laughed. “In fact, by the time the Winchester Gospel is written, edited, rewritten, translated, redacted, interpolated and codified into a single volume of text well…let’s just say it will have been a long time since parents named their child ‘Sam.’”
As far as he could see, the sun beat down upon an endless expansion sand and rock. It was oppressively hot. Desolate. Empty, and exactly what Jesus sought. But even surrounded by vast expanses of emptiness, he was never alone.
Though Jesus had returned from the desert nearly a week ago, he still hadn’t regained his former strength. He had little by way of an appetite and what food he did eat consisted mostly of bread. Wine was one of the few drinks he had any taste for. This reduced appetite, combined with the strength it took to maintain the galaxy in his ribcage, had weakened him.
“Once Charlotte’s born, I want you and Jacob to stop hunting. Don’t raise her in the life. It’s no way to raise a kid. I oughta know.” Dean pleaded, “Please.”
Castiel’s hand slipped into his fly. His palm pressed against the fabric of  Dean’s boxers, his fingers curling around his length.
. All he knew was that every so often, Alastair would come back into the room, take him down and scourge him, just to hang him right back up again. One time he sent in a pack of hellhounds to rip his legs off. Another time Alastair didn’t tie his feet so he suffocated, fast and repeatedly. The final time, Alastair drove nails through his feet. After that, he didn’t return. Dean was left alone. Alone with the hot stinging that covered his back and the throbbing pain that radiated from his palms and feet that never ceased, with his sobs and screaming pleas that always went unanswered.
Instinctively, Dean placed his hand under the old T-shirt and flannel he was wearing and ran his fingers against the left side of his ribcage, expecting there to be gash, but there was none. Only a thick line of raised tissue.
“Best news I’ve heard all day.” Bobby patted Dean on the shoulder as he made his way into the kitchen. Soon the house was flooded with the smell of pan-fried onions, ground beef, and cheese. The next thing Dean knew, a cold bottle of beer was shoved in his hand and a juicy, grease slathered cheeseburger was placed in front of him. He took a bite out of it with barely a second’s hesitation, a groan of contentment coming from his mouth. “You want anything else?” Bobby asked, a slight smile spreading across his face.
:: "Eli Eli Lama Sabachthani?" Is one of seven sayings Jesus is said to have spoken on the cross. It's mentioned in both the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Mathew and roughly translates from Aramaic to, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
When Dean wasn’t doing odd jobs around the convent, he spent his time alone in his room or sitting in the church, listening to people’s prayers and looking at the artwork. Even after the Sisters figured out who and what Dean was, aside from occasionally calling him “Lord” or looking at him in reverence, they mostly left him to his own devices.
Jesus rolled his eyes. “I didn’t buy wine from the merchant. I just told Ima that I did.” Jesus said bluntly. “On carpenter’s wages, we could never afford enough wine for sixty people. Not even with the extra money Ima and Dinah make from selling goat cheese. I thought I made enough earlier, but I was wrong.” He shrugged. “Dinah’s new family has quite the appetite for wine,” he muttered to himself.
A barren wreath of thorns was shoved onto Dean’s head and there was more pain. Pain that was sharp, that poked, scratched and itched. It was followed quickly by a blunt strike to the side of his temple and a punch to his jaw. Then another and another as the laughing continued.
“Ya know.” The man just rolled his eyes as he placed the lollipop back in his mouth, casually pulling the knife from his chest and dropping it to the floor. “I get that you’re
Dean wanted it to be over. He wanted the pain to stop. He almost longed for the bark of hellhounds.  A demise that was violent and painful, but quick. Almost.
“Hey.” Dean walked over to her, crouching down in front of her chair. He grabbed her hand. “It’s okay.” He paused. “Listen to me. What your Dad did was very brave and selfless. He did it because he loves you. Okay? Remember that.”
again. Especially considering how well the last one worked out.” There was contempt in Uriel’s voice. “And Dean is twice as stubborn and thick-headed as the Nazarene.” Uriel paused. “In fact, if I remember correctly, He was
“Of course I did.” Bobby shot him a look. “Tracked him to Saint Cloud, but after that, the trail went dry. He’s covering his tracks.  Wouldn’t shock me if Ruby’s got some kind of hexbag cloaking him or something.”
Sam stood frozen in the threshold of the bathroom, terror plastered across his face. He had just gotten off the phone with Bobby when he heard a loud thud coming from the bathroom followed by Dean’s muffled cries in what he recognized this time as Aramaic. He had kicked the door open as quickly as he could to find Dean on the floor, his head covered in cuts and scratches with streams of bright blood running down from them. The back of his shirt was once again soaked in scarlet.
Castiel locked his gaze on Dean. “The Lamb reset the seals. The Lamb must be the first to break them.”
Jesus placed his hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Then promise me you won’t get yourself killed.”  He pleaded.
When she had finished wrapping Dean’s feet with fresh bandages, she then set her eyes on the blood that had started to stain the sleeves of his dark gray hoodie. She pulled his sleeves up, setting her gaze on the crimson marked bandages. Without a single word she rewrapped Dean’s wrists. She did the same to his head and back.
Castiel didn’t respond. He looked over to Mary and Miriamne. “You should go back to the city. It’s not safe for any of you here, especially Miriamne. In her condition—”
He quickly rose up from his chair, chugging the rest of his beer. Before he made his way over to the door, he threw his jacket on as he grabbed the Impala keys from a pocket in Sam’s jacket, shoving them into his own. He glanced into Bobby’s living room where Bobby and Sam were out cold before he left the house, closing the door behind him.
“Well, I’m willing to sponsor you.” The rabbi got up from the desk and walked over to her bookshelf, grabbing a small stalk of books and putting them on the desk in front of Dean. “You can start with these.”
Dean opened his eyes slowly. He sat up to see Lisa standing beneath the entrance in the back of the chapel. She walked quickly down the center aisle, her eyes wide with worry.
Then the sound of flapping wings filled the air. Dean rose from the pavement with some difficulty and turned the corner, setting his eyes on the angel standing in the middle of an empty parking space.
of yours! If you come out now and let me hand you over to Michael, I’ll forget about this little...faux pas and
“Thank you.” Tears welled up in her eyes. “Jacob and me… we’ve been trying for years to have a baby. I don’t know what—”
But part of Dean knew that it didn’t matter. He was living, breathing proof that saints didn’t have to be immaculate statues and there was a handprint-shaped scar on his shoulder that proved it.
“Lately? Too damn much,” Dean scoffed. He shoved his free hand into his jacket pocket, refusing to take the Bible from her. “So, I’m good, ma’am. Thanks.”
Mary turned, her knife pointed at a man dressed in an olive green leisure suit, a Blow Pop hanging out of his mouth. “Who—
“You said you stopped Naamah from breaking a Seal last night.” There was worry in Ruby’s voice. “But you said
Sam didn’t say anything. He climbed over the fence, vaulting over the top and on to the ground with a thud.
Jimmy scanned the menu. “I’ll have a double cheeseburger and a large chocolate milkshake. And can I get an extra order of fries with that? Oh, and chicken fingers.”
“What did the demons mean by ‘Their Father’?” James paused for a second. “Do you think they were talking about Samael, The Adversary?”
Castiel stopped. Slowly, he looked at James. “Hello, James,” he said, his voice echoing guilt and sadness.
Sam managed to dodge him and slice the back of his leg open with the knife, toppling the man to the ground. Without a second’s hesitation, Sam fell to his knees and went for the man’s neck, slicing it open with the blade. “Not anymore,” Sam growled as he shoved his face down onto the wound, sucking the blood out of it with such hungry voracity that he nearly choked before he stood up again and darted back into the church.
The last thing Castiel saw was James, running out of the grove and back to the city in nothing but his tunic, his cloak ripped from his body.  His knuckles and face were bloody and his eyes red with angry tears.
to do with this and you know it, Cas.” Anna glared. “And even if it did, what about your own sympathies? The Flood. Sodom and Gomorrah. Isaac. The First Born of Egypt. The Canaanites. David and Bathsheba’s infant. How many times have you questioned—
Bobby paused. “So,” he locked his gaze on Dean’s forehead, squinting. “This means the stigmata aren’t just something Heaven put on you because they come with the territory. They’re
They made their way down to the dock, setting up their chairs and baiting their lures. Once they were cast, Bobby reached down and handed Dean a beer.
The demon flinched, smoke began to pool out of his mouth before Sam flicked his fingers, making it surge back into the boy the demon was possessing.
Sam had three missed calls. He deleted the first one, a number with an Illinois area code he didn’t recognize. The last two were from Bobby.
He pulled the knife out, trailing the blade up her leg until he reached the meat of her inner thigh.
Dean was the savior of humanity and he treated it like a burden, like a bitter cup he didn’t want to drink from.
Sam had spent the whole week desperately searching for a different one, but no matter where he looked, the answer remained the same.
Dean was about to retort when a voice rung out. “It’s alright, officer.” The nun that had spoken to Dean before made her way quickly down the side aisle and over to Dean’s pew. “You don’t need to bring him anywhere. I’ve already spoken to Mother Superior about him and we’ve agreed to take him in.”
“I am.” Estelle eyed Sam. She smirked. "And you’re a day late, son. All the college kids visited me yesterday.”
Rufus shook his head. “The weather this year. You’d almost think the world was ending.” He sighed. “Well, looks you’re not leaving here anytime soon.”
He’d suspected as much for a while now. The visions Dean had of the crucifixion were far too visceral, too intimate, too
Once all of the Apostles and Jesus’ family had died, they skewed the visions and writings of men they made into prophets even further.  The angels had them write Jesus' mother as a perpetual virgin who never had other children and they turned Judas into a wicked man possessed by Lucifer himself. Sometimes, they had the authors write Jesus as a mystical fountain of secret knowledge, but the version of Jesus that stuck was the man who was God incarnate and who died for the sins of humanity. Something Jesus never truly was and never did.
Dean took a deep breath and trudged over to the sink where he washed his face and neck, wiping away the rest of the sweat with a ratty bleach stained washcloth.  He stared at his face— pale and gaunt—and the purple bruises that dotted his forehead. Unbroken, they didn’t even so much as ache.
Without any hesitation, Jesus took the goatskin from him. He pulled the wooden cork out and chugged the water down, spilling some of it over his mouth that he wiped away with his sleeve. “Who are you?” Jesus croaked, watching the angel carefully.
Quiet grumbling filled the hallway. It was followed by the sound of Bobby’s footsteps making their way back down the stairs.
The priest crossed himself at the sight of the wounds. He hesitated before he touched Dean’s hands, turning each of them over as he inspected them. “You poor boy,” he sighed, remorse tingeing his words as he let go of them.
Dean rolled his eyes. He took a big sip of his coffee before dumping the rest out into the sink and grabbing his jacket, walking out to Bobby’s car. “I got one stipulation,” Dean said, closing the car door of the front passenger seat. He eyed the radio. “I call dibs on the tunes.”
“No Mom! I told you I wasn’t lying. The Blessed Mother said He’d come here and He did!” She jumped off the couch and ran over to Dean, looking up at him. “I’m here, Lord. I can help you.”
Then Sam saw the price of that miracle. Dean marked by the stigmata, bleeding and in agony while angels looked on with indifference disguised as devotion to a higher purpose. Then Sam learned the reasonfor that miracle. Dean was Son of God, The Second Coming. The stigmata marked his body as a sacred vessel, but they were also his penance, a way of cleansing him of the stain of Hell.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean noticed his half-drunk glass of water on the nightstand. Dean cocked an eyebrow as he reached over and grabbed the glass. The water had become a deep shade of red. His nose filled with the smell of fermented grapes and the all-too-familiar stench of alcohol as he swished the glass.
With that, Jesus and James walked away from the house. They made their way to the small inn that their family was staying in during the wedding. Instead of staying the night, they just grabbed their bags and left, making their way east to the Sea Galilee.
Then he heard the sound of a table screeching across the concrete followed by the breaking of glass. He turned quickly to find Sam standing next to an upended table, broken mason jars and old paint cans were strewn around it and him, his puffy eyes fixed on the ceiling.
Alastair sighed as he watched the blood already begin to soak through Dean’s beanie. “You know Dean, between you being God’s Bastard and how long
Dean’s tired eyes locked hard on Sam. “Sam… if I could deck you in the face right now I fuckin’ would.” There was pained rage in Dean’s voice as he attempted to sit up. “How dare you? You’re the one who said I needed to accept this Messiah thing. To see it as a
The pounding of a hammer on nail was no different and Dean did his best to ignore it. He tried to focus his mind on other thoughts. Other dreams. The sweet humming of his mom’s voice as her fingers lovingly stroked his hair while he rested his head against her swollen belly. The opening acoustic guitar chords of “Ramble On”—rhythmic and fast, but gentle—as it bellowed through Baby’s cabin just above the roar of her engine. The stillness of a warm summer night where the only sound he could hear, apart from the small talk he and Sam made around sips of beer, was the chirping of crickets.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. He could feel her. He could feel her warm skin against his, smell her sweet perfume. She was so close he could feel her breath against his lips. She felt real. Involuntarily, Dean moved closer, but before her lips could touch his, he pulled away.
The sound of snapping fingers filled Mary’s ears just as her eyes opened, finding herself back in bed, early morning light filling the room. She lay there for a moment, her eyes moving around the room, before she sat up.
“I’m sorry, baby, but I had to save John. The same way I needed to die in that fire.” Mary raised her eyes to him. “You needed to live this life, Dean. You needed to grow up a hunter. It had to happen that way, baby. You were destined for it.” She smiled. “You’ve always been the Son of God, Dean. Since the moment I felt you kick in my belly. Even before that, really.”
Jesus took a deep breath, smiling wearily. “Well, the dowry is almost done. I just need to finish the table.” He grabbed the jug of wine sitting on the table and headed to the door.
“It’s pine which is soft as hell- real good for carving. It was a cake-walk.” He paused. “You got the cords?”
Zachariah raised his hand, gesturing to Dean as he swaggered closer. “Hosanna in the highest- Here he is.” He grinned, smarmy and fawning.”The Root of David.”
Alastair’s grin widened as he untied Dean from the stake and dragged him back over to the cross, the hammer and nails clutched tightly in his hands.
It was empty aside from the crib she and John had put together a week before, the three small cans of blue paint and the radio she had been listening to while testing the paint earlier that afternoon. She could still smell the faint odor of paint as she tiptoed further into the room.
Then there was silence, like the calm before a lightning strike. All Dean could hear was his own breathing and the rustle of wings.
A platoon of demon were standing at attention on the sidewalk. Sam faced them, his hands dripping red. Sam turned slowly, revealing a mouth caked with blood and eyes a bright shade of yellow.
Dean nodded. “Thanks, Cas.” A weary smile spread across his face as he gave Castiel a pat on the shoulder.
After the fourth day of searching, it became clear to Bobby that Sam didn’t want to be found, so he went back home.
here of course. The Cage isn’t open. Yet.  But I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.” He walked slowly over to Dean, stopping a few inches away from him. “It’s nice to finally meet you.” Lucifer reached out, trying to put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Jesus.”
Alastair leaned his face in, pressing his lips just against Dean’s ear. “And it is written, ‘The First Seal shall break when The Righteous Man sheds blood in Hell. As The Lamb breaks, so shall it break.’” he hissed, his voice menacing but certain.
:: Incorruptibility is a Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies of those canonized as saints and even some beatified individuals are able to avoid the normal process of decomposition after death as a sign of their holiness. Cases are many and go back centuries. Reported stigmatics Saint Cathrine of Siena and Padre Pio are two such examples.
Jesus’ other brothers: Judah, Joses, and Simon were standing at the synagogue entrance, along with Simon’s two young sons.
Christ, Cas, at this point, his mother feels more real to me than my own mom.” Tears flooded Dean’s eyes. He quickly wiped them away, running a hand over his mouth. “I have his fucking soul, Cas. His Soul. The most basic part of me doesn’t even belong to
?” Bobby asked. “I mean, you boys have had other lives besides those two, right? Why didn't the angels start it sooner?"
. All done by Yours Truly.” He paused, brushing a fingertip over the blood streaming down Dean’s forearm. “By the time I had hung up the last one, the first was already half-eaten by dogs. It was… electrifying, to say the least.”
“Yes,” she sighed. “Though in my case, it’s ‘Why didn’t you get under the canopy while you still had the chance?’” After a long pause, she said, “So, why are you, a firstborn son with a trade, unmarried?”
Apart from Michael, this angel was the only one Jesus had ever met. Since the time of the prophets, few had. The last time they had been seen at all was during Maccabean Revolt some two hundred years ago.
She walked over to the cell, her eyes turning black as she approached. “Hey, Dean.” She smirked. “Long time no see.”
“None,” Castiel said bluntly. “Sam is on his way there now. I’ll have to send you there.” Castiel walked over to Dean, holding two fingers out.
Two days ago, his stomach began to ache with hunger, but the only nourishment he found was in the sun-warmed water of his goatskin.
to do with the fact that I’ve spent my whole life watching good people get ripped apart by evil while you guys sat on your asses and
“Oh yeah,” Detective Connolly replied, nodding, pulling out his notes. “According to her husband she was at Saint Anthony’s every Sunday at 9:00 AM sharp. She was there every Thursday after work for adoration too. And she was a member of the choir, and had practice every other Wednesday.”
Dean watched the flames flicker, reflecting back in the reflection of the window. It brought him calm. Peace even.  He smiled slightly. “It’s pretty.”
say that. Blubbering sack of self-loathing, savior complexes and daddy issues that you are. But I have a feeling you're going to care when that alcoholic surrogate father of yours...” Zachariah thought for a second, straightening his tie. “...Crashes your car into the Ohio River.”
There were no vacancies to be found anywhere, aside from a room with a single bed in a hotel that had likely once been a tenement building, just above a dive bar. The Alva Hotel. It was old and cramped, with the lingering stench of cigarette smoke. Lack of cleanliness and having to sleep in an armchair aside, Dean wasn’t bothered by it. What bothered him was the painfully obvious irony that he
A moment later the door opened. The scent of frankincense poured from the house, nearly making Sam gag. A woman emerged from behind the door. She was wearing a T-shirt and jeans, with a wooden rosary around her neck and bangle earrings. There was a black smudge on her forehead, just below the red scarf tied around her head.
“Ya know…” Dean looked down at his hands, smiling sadly. Already, blood had begun to seep through the gauze. “You remind me of someone.”
Dean let out a soft groan. Pressure began to build at the base of his spine. Heat and blood rushed to his groin, radiating through his hips and stomach.
A young girl with blonde hair wearing a pink and black Fall Out Boy hoodie and jeans opened the door. She froze for a second before hugging him.
Sam pulled into the parking lot of the motel.  As soon as he turned the corner, he saw the yellow mustang parked a few spaces down from his motel room. Ruby was standing outside his motel room door. Waiting.
“...the Stigmata?” Jacob’s eyes went wide. He looked at Dean for a moment. “What exactly are you trying to get at here, Dean?”
All the churches Dean and Sam had visited since Christmas had been smaller and older than this one; a Methodist church in Montana that was a hundred years old and falling apart, a two aisle Baptist church in Wyoming, and a Pentecostal church they stopped at on the way to Bobby’s house that—although larger in size—looked as though it hadn’t been renovated since Sam was an infant.
It was in this state, as he lay half asleep in his bed, that Dean heard it. A voice. It whispered his name. Soft and quiet. Comforting, but sad. At first he couldn’t recognize who it belonged to, but somehow he still knew it, like a half-lost memory.
Castiel watched Uriel for a second. “If Dean dies with his soul in the state that it’s in right now, Lucifer rises without anyone to oppose him. We lose this battle before it’s even begun. Tell me Uriel, how does that benefit Heaven?”
Before Dean could say anything more, The Silence returned, followed by the agonizing pain of steel cutting between his ribs, sliding past bone and into muscle, radiating through his chest.
“Yes. Really,” the officer deadpanned. “If you need a place to sleep, you can walk to the homeless shelter downtown.”
“Sammy.” Dean’s voice shook pleadingly. He looked at his brother through a veil of tears and blood. “Help me.
digging into my head,” his voice cracked as he made an attempt to yell. “I’m living out Martin Riggs’ version of Easter here. Why the hell didn’t you say anything, Sam?”
“What I’m getting at is that you- more than anyone- know the pain of being forsaken by God. You remember your dying words, don’t you?” Lucifer cleared his throat.
“Well.”  Dean paused. Thinking. What he wanted to say, he couldn’t. “Well about half a year ago I found out that I have Jewish ancestry. Distant Jewish ancestry. It’s been a struggle for me to come terms with that. Ya know? I think the only way I can come to terms with it is if I…” Dean paused. “Embrace it. On my own terms.”
Jesus shook his head. “Not with Roman legionnaires roaming the countryside. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but men like me—prophets, messiahs—” Jesus paused. “They don’t live long.”
ain’t supposed to be here yet. Lucifer’s supposed to have his run of the joint first. You’re only supposed to show up after all the shit’s hit the fan. Don’t suppose Castiel said anything about that.”
“Is this supposed to be some kind sick joke, Cas?” He narrowed his eyes. “I can heal cancer. I can bring people back from the dead! But I can’t purge demon blood from my own goddamn brother?” His voice shook as it rose.
. He felt each and every one of the bruises on his back, forehead, wrists, and ankles crack and split open with a hot sting and he cried at the feel of it.
Castiel had just begun to make his way down the hill when he saw Mary and James walking up the hill, Miriamne trailing close behind, her heavy stomach making the trek somewhat more difficult for her.
“Perfect timing. Bishop Tamsen and Father DeMatteo just go here.” Jimmy whispered.  He opened the door, letting Dean and Bobby into the house.
Dean was silent for a while before he cleared his throat. “Yeah. I— I get that. This is my fate.” He nodded to himself. His eyes didn’t stray from the wooden and ceramic crucifix, painted in almost neutral hues of brown and white. The only color that popped out was the red paint on the feet, palms and forehead, stark against the near white pallor of the figure’s skin. A larger streak flowed down from the figure’s very noticeable ribcage.
Bobby jumped to his feet, knocking the chair over as he rose. He darted up the stairs. When he pushed the bathroom door open; the sickeningly sweet aroma of roses he had come to associate with fear flooded his nose.
“Hey Zach!” Dean yelled, standing up. He could see Zachariah standing a few yards away from him, at the edge of the ravine.
Standing in front of the altar was a woman with curly blond hair, wearing a white, blood-spattered satin gown. In her hands was a large metal chalice.The woman turned at the sound of the doors slamming open.
"I think I'll walk her around a bit, give you and Adam so time to cuddle before Mary needs to eat again" Dean told his mate as he stood with Mary in his arms and left the room .
I'm sorry that Its been almost a month since I've updated. The holidays were crazy and having the whole family home meant I haven't had the time to write. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about this this chapter. It was a struggle to write and came out short and clunky. I'm hoping and trying to get back to the swing of writing as I figure out where to take this story and how to finish it.
So...its been over a year since I actually updated this sorry about that. This chapter has been sitting in my drafts unfinished since this summer? And I've been trying to get back into writing so I decided to add to this instead of writing a new fic. Also, there 52 of you who are subbed to this that's insane to me. Love y'all and hope you enjoy this new chapter
When Castiel woke up the next morning it was to find that Dean was already gone, Peaches he noticed was also missing from the room. Cas got dressed and ate breakfast before going to track down his mate and kitten. It took almost an hour ,but he finally found Dean in the training pavilion with Peaches watching from the sidelines in her basket. "What do we think Peaches, he can do better right?" Castiel asked as he settled down to watch his Alpha spar with another soldier. Watching Dean train was one of Cas's favorite activities, seeing his mate's displays of full strength was exhilarating. He eyed Dean as the alpha went through sword fighting, hand to hand combat and shooting targets with a bow and arrow.
The newborn made their appearance in the early hours of the next morning. A tiny squealing pup was placed on Castiel 's chest as a midwife cleaned them with a fresh towel.
Castiel tried to distract himself with reading, but soon grew bored and restless.  With a huff of frustration, he threw the book across the room and stalked out of the room. "Miss Ellen, I need help please" Cas requested politely as he walked into the kitchen, careful to not disturb the other working cooks and servants. "Of course your highness, what can I do for you?" Ellen asked as she cleaned her hands. Ellen was an aging omega who had been working in the palace for as long as anyone could remember She knew the interworkings of the royal family and had taken a liking to Castiel as soon as they met though she was still trying to get the timid and soft spoken omega to grow a backbone. "Dean loves pie I was wondering if I could have space to make some" Castiel inquired as he mindlessly smoothed the skirt of his dress. Ellen smiled and cleared a work space for Cas before handing him an apron. Castiel beamed and gathered ingredients to get started. He peeled and chopped the fruits, letting them all cook down while he made the crusts and lined each pie tin. Cas hummed to himself as he added the fillings and top crusts being sure to add pretty designs and brush the top with a mix of milk and sugar so it would brown nicely while baking. Castiel cleaned up as the pies baked and cooled so he wouldn't leave a mess for the kitchen staff.
"While you were away at war and I was here pregnant with our daughter?" Castiel clarified as he turned to look at Dean.
"Can we go out today?" Castiel asked as he hung up his sweater. "I've got meetings all day angel" Dean told him as he stripped off  his clothes. "But I'm bored, I hate being stuck in here with nothing to do" Cas complained with a pout.  He didn't mean to complain really he didn't but being isolated without anyone to really talk to was taking its toll on Cas. He was just an omega, just a princess so his opinion on anything didn't matter and now that he was pregnant all of his hobbies and outings had been stopped as it was seen as distasteful for a pregnant royal to be in the public eye. "Come with me to the meetings, We'll do something after just us" Dean suggested kissing Cas before heading off to bathe. Castiel huffed and sat down on the couch with a pout. He knew he was being ridiculous and acting like a spoiled pup but it wasn't fair, Dean had come all the way home for him and the pup and now the alpha didn't have time for them. You'd think being pregnant and carrying the future heir to the throne would give him some priority but apparently not.
"Adam is cutting another tooth, if I put him down he'll start screaming" Cas explained patiently, offering the pup a teething toy as he did so.
Fifteen minutes later Cas was sinking down into a tub of steaming water with a happy sigh. "How's that feel omega mine?" Dean asked as he rubbed Cas's back. Castiel hummed happily and leaned back into Dean's arms. Amazing, missed you...missed this" He confessed as he closed his eyes and relaxed further. "Me too sweetheart" Dean agreed as he placed a kiss over Cas's mating bite.
Castiel took a deep breath as he stepped through the doors of the dinning room and carefully walked down the staircase to the table. Dean was already there, halfway through a bottle of wine and shamelessly flirting with one of the servants. Cas made his way to the table not even bothering to comment on his mate's behavior. Castiel had to remain faithful, had to ensure that any child he carried was his husband's but, Dean was free to do whatever he liked with whomever he liked. He caught Lady Katherine's smug look and the pitying looks from the other servants helping with the meal. Cas kept silent the entirety of the meal, though he kept a tally in his head of how many glasses of wine Dean had consumed.
In truth, Cas didn't know much about his brother and sister in law. He'd only met them once, briefly and almost two years ago right before his and Dean's wedding. Sam had all but escaped the family for lack of a better word and married Queen Elieen who ruled a kingdom days and a ship's voyage away from them. From what Cas had heard and gathered from their correspondence Sam and Elieen were beloved and doing good works for their kingdom and people.
"I have not seen you in the churches Castiel, you must pray for an easy delivery, you must pray for a son" Katherine informed him in a scolding tone as she picked up her teacup.
"A healthy princess, congratulations your highness" the midwife spoke softly as she handed the pup to Castiel.
When they were finished with their meal and everything had been cleared away Dean called for one of Castiel's personal maids while his mate rested. "Meg, please draw a bath and add Castiel's most relaxing bath oils" he requested. "Of course your highness is there anything else you'll need" Meg asked just to make sure. "No Meg that'll be all thank you" Cas answered with a yawn as he stood up.
Castiel nodded and set off for the nursery. He threw open the doors and approached the far wall where the source of the noise was. Inside the crib was a tiny pup wrapped haphazardly in a blanket. Cas reached in and carefully scooped the baby up, holding him in his arms.
Heads turned when Castiel returned carrying a kitten. It was a well known rule that King John did not allow animals of any kind in the palace. "Meg, please fetch a basin of warm water and a brush" Cas requested as he entered his chambers with the kitten. "Of course, princess" the maid said before leaving to procure the requested items. Castiel made himself comfortable on the carpet by the fireplace and started to clean the burrs and thorns out of the kitten's fur. "I think I'll name you Peaches" Castiel decided as he scratched behind the cat's ears. He spent the rest of the day tending to the kitten 's needs. Two baths and then a bowl of cream and a blanket lined basket by the fire.
Dean nodded minutely and then slipped out the door, leaving Castiel to peace and quiet. Cas took a deep breath, growing weary as the adrenaline dropped and his anger faded as quickly as it had appeared. He grabbed a blanket and curled up on the couches next to the fireplace too exhausted to walk the extra few steps to his bed.
"Hardly, He's an omega they want nothing to do with him and as far as I know he doesn't even have a name" Castiel told Dean, not even bothering to hide the contempt he held for the king and his wife.
"He can barely sit up on his own, I highly doubt he's wondering where his mama is" Dean joked as he got up to fetch Adam from the nursery.
Dean was distracted with struggling over sign language that he didn't even notice Castiel come back to their chambers or the lunch that someone set in front of him. Books and papers were strewn about, making a mess of their dining table as Dean tried to balance two subjects at once as well as trying to occasionally read and respond to letters and official inquiries. There was a particular letter that was bothering him and it was making it impossible to focus on the conversation Cas was trying to have.  He really did try to pay attention to what his omega was saying but, Dean was growing weary and his head was throbbing after looking at words and pictures all morning.
Castiel sighed and looked over at Dean, he loved the man but sometimes he could just be so frustratingly dense. Cas closed the book and handed it over to Dean before getting up to get the pups ready for the day. This was the best part of Cas's day, when he could spend some uninterrupted qualitiy time with his seven and four and a half month old.  He was slowly returning to his duties in the palace and readying for the arrival of his brother in law and sister in law was one of the first.
"We're married...We have children, a family...how could you do this to us" Cas asked as he walked back over to Dean.
"I made a mistake, I was lonely I missed you and I thought we were over...That fight was something else" Dean tried to explain as he reached for Cas.
"Go check on Adam for me will you, He'll be awake by now and wondering where I am" Cas said as he pushed himself into a sitting position.
Dean took a deep breath and thought for a minute. He pressed a kiss to Cas's forehead and then easily scooped his mate up and carried him to their bed. Dean laid Cas down in his nest of blankets and toed off his boots before joining him. Castiel yawned and snuggled up to the alpha. "Be careful for Peaches" He warned, already half asleep. "Who the hell is Peaches?" Dean asked just as the kitten plodded into the room and jumped up onto the bed making herself comfortable between the mated pair. "Cas sweetheart, you know the rules about animals" Dean argued even though he was exhausted. "You get your army and your heir, I get my Peaches" Cas said as he turned to look at his husband, daring the alpha to argue.  "Anything you want my princess" Dean relented as he kissed Cas's cheek.
He watched Dean leave and then sank down on the couch to try and pull himself together. The sad thing was that in the beginning of their marriage Cas knew it was all a lie and that he was only here because Dean needed a mate and an heir. But, he'd started to believe that they were actually friends, even a tentative couple and now to find out that it was all a lie hurt a million times more than when the knowledge first occurred to him.
"Stop being a bitch Cas, you have no idea what you're talking about" Dean warned as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Mary was almost five months old now and things were returning to normal now that the celebrations had died down. For weeks following the princess's birth the palace had been a flurry of activities, feasting and visiting dignitaries. It had been constant and the little family of three (four) had barley any time to rest or bond properly.
Since learing of his sister in law Cas had taken it upon himself to learn the dialect of sign language Elieen primarily used. He had been told that it wasn't an issue, that the Queen had interpreters and could read lips but, Cas disagreed and figured the very least he should do is be able to communicate with her properly. He'd been expected to learn the basics of every language under the sun but, a form of communication for a member of the royal family and more importantly one of the kingdom's allies had been pushed aside and swept under the rug.
Castiel was growing annoyed at Dean's attempts at apologies. It had been over a week since their fight and Dean kept sending expensive gifts. Every morning  large bouquets of flowers and a box of confections appeared next to his bed and every evening new jewelry or a dress showed up. Apparently simply saying he was sorry, didn't occur to Dean.  At this point the couple wasn't speaking and Cas went out of his way to avoid his husband. Dean slept out in the barracks with the rest of the soldiers on the palace grounds, at least he was smart enough to not try and crawl into bed next to Cas every night.
Dean smiled and took a seat across the table from his mate. It had been months since he had last seen Castiel and Dean had missed him. "So its a boy then?" He asked, trying to lighten the tense mood hanging over the table. "Is that all you care about, our pup's gender and presentation status?" Castiel asked as he set his knife down and stared at Dean across the table. "Of course not, you know I just want you and pup to be healthy" Dean said as he reached for Cas's free hand.  "I don't like not having you home especially now"  Castiel said with a frown as he softened slightly. "I miss you and I'm lonely" he added, picking at his last piece of toast. "I know my omega, I miss you too, but I needed to go they needed me" Dean tried to soothe as he got up and went to Cas's side. "You wanted to go, couldn't get away from me fast enough" Castiel said as he picked at the hem of his robe.
"Its just a blood sample for the presentation test, Mary is fine" Castiel assured his alpha as he soothed their fussing pup.
Castiel smiled and got up to take the pup and the bottle from the older woman. Dean stayed at the table and watched Castiel with mild curiosity. His mate was a natural with pups it seemed and he couldn't wait to see Cas with their own pup. Cas made himself comfortable and fed the pup before changing him and carrying him back to the nursery. Dean waited for Cas to leave the nursery before he went in and looked down at his new little brother who was sleeping peacefully and blissfully unaware that his parents didn't want him.
"You must have a son or your husband will be permitted another wife, perhaps he is courting another omega already" Katherine theorized.
Dean came out an hour later properly dressed for a day around the palace. He smiled when he saw Cas curled up with a book. "I'll be in the war room if you need me"  Dean said as he kissed Cas goodbye and patted Peaches on the head. Castiel nodded absently and turned the page of his novel. Dean straightened the cuffs of his jacket and walked into the war room, taking his spot at the head of the map table. He spent the next few hours discussing battle plans and looking over the various maps that were spread out before him.
With Mary's arrival Dean decided to take some time away from his royal duties to spend some time with his mate and their pups. Which is how he found himself stacking blocks with Adam after feeding the pup breakfast one morning. With both of his charges on completely different sleep schedules and in completely different stages of development Cas was exhausting himself with trying to do everything on his own so Dean was trying to help out in any way his omega would let him.
"There's my beautiful family, breakfast should be up in a little while" Dean said as he walked back into their chambers and went back over to Cas's side.
Dean came back in carrying Adam in his arms. The pup was cooing and Dean was pretending to hold a conversation which only made Adam coo and babble more. Castiel smiled at them and held his hands out for the pup. Dean kissed Cas before he handed Adam over and settled down on the bed next to Castiel. Mary started to fuss and Dean quickly picked her to soothe her.
"I made a choice, Mary will make herself a Queen, She's the one who'll make history...This time, this time we're just the silent part of the history" Dean clarified, shrugging Cas's worries off.
Sighing to himself Cas finished his meal and got dressed for the day. Without Dean around he didn't have many royal duties and now that he was with pup it was no longer appropriate for him to leave the palace per tradition. Castiel slipped into one of day dresses and wrapped a sweater around himself before leaving his chambers and making his way to the palace gardens. The garden had to be Castiel's favorite part of his home. It had been a creation of the late Queen Mary and much like the rest of the kingdom the gardens had fallen into disrepair after her death. That had been Cas's first order of business after his marriage, to restore the gardens and now the space was well on its way back to its former glory.
"You're being dramatic, no one is being fired or sent to the dungeons or hung by their toes while rats eat them" Castiel said rolling his eyes.
Dean barely glanced at the summons before crumpling the parchment and throwing it in the fireplace. He checked on Castiel again and then went to clean himself up so he could go talk to his father. Once he was presentable Dean made his way down to the throne room where he knew John would be. The first thing he noticed was that his father wasn't alone, his new wife Lady Katherine was with him, The second thing Dean noticed was that Lady Katherine was visibly pregnant. "So I guess congratulations are in order" Dean stated, forcing a smile even though he was brimming with anger. "Isn't it amazing?...I'm only a few weeks ahead of your omega, we'll have two little princes toddling around before too long" Katherine said happily, not sensing her step son's distaste. " My Omega is his Royal Highness Princess Castiel Grace Winchester and you will use his proper title when speaking of him in my presence " Dean answered sharply as his eyes narrowed. Dean turned on his heel and left the throne room, making his way back to Castiel.
Castiel growled under his breath and stalked over to his husband before slapping him across the face. "That is not what I meant and you know it"
Dean set down his bow after the last arrow hit its target and wiped his face with a towel a guard handed to him before making his way over to Castiel and Peaches. "I feel like I should give you my handkerchief or my hand marriage or something" Cas teased as he greeted Dean with a kiss. "Well if I can't show off for my beautiful omega who can I show off for?" Dean asked as he wrapped his arms around Cas's waist. "Missed you this morning" Castiel said as he curled into Dean's arms. "Sorry, thought we'd be back by the time you were awake" Dean apologized kissing Cas before scooping up the cat and making their way back to their chambers.
Castiel spent the rest of the required time making false pleasantries and trying to not think of his coming pup's fate. Dean was good as far as alphas went, he was kind and treated Castiel with a level of respect the omega was certain he would never have in his life so maybe his husband wouldn't be that angry if their first child wasn't an alpha son.  After they had finished their tea and conversed for long enough Castiel bid the older omega goodbye and retreated back to his side of the palace. Cas took the long way, admiring the Christmas decorations and taking in all the wonderful smells. When he finally made it back to his and Dean's chambers it was to find the rooms still empty. Castiel shook his head and hoped that Dean would appear at dinner tonight at the very least. Castiel removed his shoes and changed into a nightgown so he could take a nap before he was expected for dinner.
Mary had soothed herself back to sleep during her parents simple argument and the midwife fled the room once the blood sample had been procured. Castiel swaddled Mary back up and placed her back in the bassinet by his and Dean's bed. Cas smiled down at his pup before turning his attention to the breakfast trays that had arrived. Dean just sat back and let his mate eat, after labor and so little sleep his poor omega must have been starving.
"Find out if the child is yours and take care of it, I won't stand silently by and watch you become your father" Cas told Dean seriously.
"Sam and Elieen are coming to meet the pups, I want to able communicate with her properly"  Castiel reasoned.
"And this, One day this will all be yours, you'll be the Queen of everything the light touches and I'm very proud to tell you that you'll be the greatest Queen our kingdom has ever seen" Dean told Mary as he stepped onto a balcony and gestured off into the horizon.
He was stupid, so damn stupid for ever believing that Dean would be different than alphas before him or that Cas could be special, actually important to his mate. Except, they weren't actually mates not really. They were married sure but, Dean had never actually given him a mating bite. The alpha had insisted on their wedding night that it was too soon, that they could wait and that all people really cared about was Cas getting pregnant. Then, Cas was pregnant and Dean was sent off to war soon after when unrest broke out along their borders. Now here they were, two pups and almost two years later married but still not mated properly.
Dean growled and stalked toward his omega. His patience ans temper running short. Before anything could happen though, there was a knock at the door and a maid came in to announce Sam and Elieen's arrival.
"What the fuck was that, do you have any idea how embarrassing your little stunt was?" Dean asked with a growl as he stormed into the room and slammed the door closed.
Dean growled under his breath as he left the barracks and headed back to the palace. In his mind, he hadn't done anything wrong and Castiel was overreacting. He had tried apologising and nothing seemed good enough for Castiel. The only thing his omega seemed to care about was the impending arrival of their pup. All Castiel seemed to do these days was knit blanket after blanket for the pup and fuss around in the nursery, wanting everything to be perfect.
Lady Katherine was due to have her pup any day now and even though the two pups would grow up together, it would be Castiel's pup who would be of more importance. The little prince or princess would be third in line for the throne after their parents, whereas their new uncle wouldn't even be considered for the role and be a royal in name only. In all likelihood Lady Katherine's would be pushed aside and cared for by a slew of nannies and tutors before being made a magistrate and marrying a low ranking courtier 's pup.
"Castiel, please join me" Katherine returned with a cold and forced politeness.  Cas walked over and sat on one of the empty couches. Both omegas sat in silence as their tea and finger foods were set out before them by a team of servants.
"And frankly, it's sexist, if this was a man or an alpha we were talking about you'd make an effort at the very least" Cas contuined as he stood and picked Mary up from her blanket before plopping her in Dean's lap.
Adam was quiet and preferred Castiel over anyone, as long as his mama was holding him or within eyesight he was happy. Mary on the other  hand always wanted to be where the action was. She loved having Dean carry her around and was content to sit with him through meetings or lay on a blanket and observe his sword fighting or hand to hand combat training.
"I want you there when the pup is born, I want you with me" Castiel spoke up after they had been standing in silence for a while.
Castiel woke up to the smells of his favorite foods and the sight of Dean feeding Peaches bits of roast chicken as she lay stretched out on a pillow. "Looks like you've already got Daddy wrapped around your little paw" Cas said with a yawn as he pet her. "Just didn't want her jumping onto the table" Dean tried to defend. "So the bowl of warm cream and the new pillows are for what exactly?" Castiel asked teasingly as he kissed Dean. "She's a royal cat" Dean tried again. Cas smiled and then went over to the table to see that all of his favorites had been laid out. "Come eat with me" Cas called as he sat down at the table. Dean grabbed the chair across from Cas and waited until the omega had taken what he'd wanted before filling his own plate. "Will you soak in the tub with me after we eat?" Castiel asked as he ate a piece of buttered bread. "My muscles hurt and I miss you" he told Dean matter of factly. "Of course my omega whatever you and pup want" Dean promised with a smile.
He returned to his and Dean's chambers to find dinner laid out for him and his alpha half asleep in the soaking tub. "Alpha...Alpha come to bed" Cas said as he gently shook Dean awake. "Hey, did you and Peaches have a nice walk?" Dean asked slowly opening his eyes. Cas nodded and pulled him in for a kiss, letting his fingers rake through his mate's hair.Dean smiled into the kiss and deepened it slightly. "Come to bed" Cas said quietly as he pulled away and stood up.
Dean looked down at Mary and then over at Adam, his two pups. His two little omega pups and damn if that didn't terrify him every time he remembered. Mary would be Queen one day and so would Adam if Dean would ever find a alpha good enough, which he highly doubted even now. Mary would be Queen and just like her aunt she would be so in her own right, not a title forced upon her by a marriage.  It would wise to keep a strong relationship with Sam and Elieen not only for the sake of their kingdoms but, for Mary she'd need a role model and someone other than or in addition to her mother would be a good start.
He cleared off one of the benches and sat down intent on knitting a blanket for the pup it was very likely that the new prince or princess would arrive in the winter and Castiel wanted to be prepared. Cas was engrossed in his task when he heard quiet whimpers coming from an overgrown set of rose bushes. Setting down his work the omega went to investigate. Castiel carefully made his way over and pulled the brambles apart as the whimpers got louder. There in the heart of the bush was a tiny orange kitten. "Well hello there little one, lets get you free shall we?" Castiel asked gently, going to retrieve his knitting shears to rescue the animal.
The sun was just rising as Castiel go out of bed. He slid his feet into his favorite fur-lined slippers and grabbed his robe from the hook next to the bed. The doors to the bed-chamber opened and two maids stepped in. Castiel would never get used to this even after almost a year of being married and living in the palace. "Did a letter come?" He asked, still waking from his sleep. "One from Prince Dean, your Highness" one of the maids answered, holding out a parchment envelope. Castiel took the letter and made himself comfortable on his favorite couch. Dean had been gone for four months now. Yes, his husband was a prince, but the alpha liked being a war general over his royal duties. So when Issues had started on the outskirts of the kingdom Dean had jumped at the chance to go, Castiel had not been thrilled with the idea, especially since they had just been informed that he was carrying their first pup, but, like a good Omega, Wife and Princess he kept his mouth shut like what was expected of him.
He stopped by the kitchens on his way and asked the cooks if they would prepare Cas's favorite meal and have it sent up to their private chambers. Dean entered the bedroom silently and undressed before slipping back into bed. "Where have you been?" Castiel asked sleepily as he instantly wrapped his arms around Dean as if he sensed the alpha's presence. "Just had to take care of some things, I'm all yours now" Dean promised as he combed his fingers through Cas's hair. Castiel hummed and burrowed into Dean's side, quickly falling back asleep. Dean stared down at his sleeping mate and let his hand gently graze over the soft swell of Cas's stomach. "Your mama's right little one, I didn't need to go I wanted to go, Your mama is always right" Dean confessed quietly before glancing over to make sure Cas was still asleep.
"Well they should be, I'll make it illegal for anyone to ever make by baby girl sad" Dean said as he kissed Mary's pricked foot.
"She woke up hungry and decided to let me know it" Castiel answered with a laugh as he tore his gaze away from their pup long enough to look up at Dean.
The holidays meant more mandatory dinners with the family. When Castiel woke up from his nap, he called on his two maids to help him prepare for that night's dinner.  He took a bath with sweet smelling salts and oils and then went to select one of the gowns out of his closet. Castiel had his hair combed perfectly, his nails were filed and painted a soft pink color and then kohl was applied under his eyes and red-tinted gloss was painted on his lips. His dinner gown was red and floor length with a red lace bodice and a red bow to accentuate his waist. The look was finished off with a pair of fur lined flats.
"I'm sorry Cas" Dean apologized quietly as his mate's words hit him all at once. He had never thought about it like that.
"That's not really, Birth is a thing for omegas" Dean tried to tell him, it wasn't proper for the father to be present at the birth.
"It's disrespectful" Cas announced as he came back to their chambers and set the pups down with their toys.
"Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was, if you don't respect me, nobody else will either and nevermind the example you're setting for our pups" Castiel continued as he got upset all over again.
"Good afternoon my angels, did we have good naps?" Castiel greeted as he walked over to the cribs and picked up his two very wide awake pups.
"Should we go check on Mama and Mary?" Dean asked as he picked Adam up and carried out of the nursery. Walking into his and Cas's chambers he saw his mate and daughter cuddled together on the couch.
Dean quietly sat by Castiel's bedside, keeping watch over his sleeping mate and pup. Mary was in Dean's opinion the most beautiful pup on earth. He was still in complete awe of his daughter, carefully Dean reached out and stroked Mary's cheek. The little girl fussed a stirred for a second before slipping back into sleep. He gently tucked Mary back into her bundle of blankets and pressed a kiss to her forehead before going to find a servant to bring food to his and Cas's chambers.
"Don't you worry little brother, Cas and I will take care of you" Dean promised softly as he reached down to stroke the baby's cheek.
Dean walked around the palace with Mary in his arms. He knew it was ridiculous to "explain" royal history to a pup who was barely twelve hours old but, he desperately wanted quality time to cuddle and bond with his daughter and Mary didn't seem to mind all of the useless information that fell from his mouth. He told her of all the great queens of past generations, insisting that she would be included in that list one day alongside her mother and grandmother. He told her of their kingdom's traditions and of all the feasts and festivals that were being thrown in her honor that very minute.
"Okay, Mary and I will just be here studying if you need us" Dean offered as he absently flipped a page.
"You made her a Queen, you made history this morning and you made a lot of enemies" Castiel told Dean imploringly, needing the Alpha to understand the gravity of his decisions.
"I can watch both of them you know, you don't have to have him with you every second of the day" Dean pointed out as he opened one of Cas's books.
Castiel nodded and looked down at Adam. The pup was drooling against his shoulder and had a pudgy little fist securely attached to the fabric of Cas's nightgown. Cas sighed and dropped on kiss on the top of Adam's head. He laid completely still, happy to just have a pup in his arms.
"Your father is going to be furious, I'm surprised he hasn't busted in here already" Cas said quietly as he eyed the doors warily.
When Castiel returned from his day out Dean was waiting for him in their chambers. He pointedly ignored the alpha as he shed his cloak and leather boots. Cas took his time to put his things away and greet Peaches before he turned his attention to Dean.
"You're stuck with me, unless you plan on taking a page out of history and starting a fire in our children's nursery, I have served my purpose after all" Cas challenged with a glare.
"Cas, baby please just talk to me, I've apologized multiple times" Dean said growing tired of the way Cas was freezing him out.
Castiel read over the letter and absently let a hand rest on his growing bump. Cas frowned and reached for the tea cup that had been set on the table next to him. "Apparently your father would rather fight on battlefields then participate in peace talks and come home to us pup" He informed the pup as he smoothed a hand over his stomach. "Would you like to write back, your highness?" One of the maids asked as they set out a plate of toast and an array of jams. "Tell my husband that if he is not home and in our bed by the time his son is born then he better get used to sleeping in the barracks with his men, If he wants to act like a soldier then he can be treated like them" Castiel dictated as he slowly ate a piece of toast. "Yes, Princess" the maids answered before bowing and leaving the room.
"If you want to be angry at your father or Lady Katherine or even their unborn pup, then fine but, stop punishing and taking it out on me and everyone else who did nothing to deserve it" Castiel continued as he looked at Dean through narrowed eyes.
"Of course angel, I can have that arranged" Dean promised with a nod as he bent down to kiss his mate.
Dean nodded and kissed Cas again before leaving to get them some breakfast. He came back a half hour later with a little bit of everything from the kitchens and a bowl of cream for Peaches. Cas wrapped a blanket around himself like a cape and got up to join Dean at the table. There was a knock at the door just as they were finishing up their breakfast. A maid came carrying the new pup and a fresh bottle.
"I said, Get the fuck out" Castiel repeated angrily as he pushed on Dean's shoulder and shoved him toward the door.
The labor was slow stretching on for hours and making Castiel irritable. It was growing dark outside and the pup had made little signs of their impending arrival. The contractions were getting more and more painful, making it almost impossible for Cas to find a comfortable position. His feet were swollen to the point that it hurt to walk so using that method to progress labor was out. Cas just stayed in bed, massaging his belly and singing to the pup through the contractions. He snapped when Dean tried to step in and help him, he was tired of everyone fussing over him and just wanted their pup to come out already.
Castiel frowned. He didn't want to think of himself as Adam's mother, because there was still a part of him that hoped Lady Katherine would come around and he would hate to take that away from her. Although, It did feel like Adam was his and he was very attached to the pup. This whole thing was just a mess and trying to sort everything out only served to confuse Castiel even more. He wanted Adam as his own but, he also wanted what was best and maybe that meant Katherine but, maybe and what Castiel selfishly hoped what was best would be Adam being raised as his and Dean's pup.
"What in the hell do you think you're doing?" Dean asked with a growl as he watched the midwife's movements.
Peaches purred loudly and pushed her head against Dean's palm, wanting him to pet her. "You are pretty cute" Dean decided as he pet the tiny kitten. She purred and curled up next to Dean. "I've got two spoiled little princesses on my hands now, huh?" The alpha asked aloud to the empty room as he looked down at his mate and new pet. "You're lucky you're cute" Dean added as closed his eyes.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel’s voice seemed to echo through the church despite the growing din of the churchgoers around him as they all chatted with one another before the start of the mass.
His stomach was empty. It had been empty for weeks, but he didn't feel any pain. He doubted he’d ever truly feel hunger again. What the heat hadn’t burned away, his mouth lost the taste for. Nothing tasted the same. Olives were no longer olives; they were fruit flesh, oils, and juices. Bread was no longer bread. It was broken down into its base ingredients: ground grains, salt, and water.
Leaning against the door, Bobby stared at the task in front of him. He had to wash the blood off of Dean’s body. With the sheer amount of blood on him the easier thing to do would have been to put Dean in the bathtub and bathe him. Dean weighed a good fifty pounds lighter than he normally did and it would be far from Bobby’s first time moving a corpse, but a dry corpse was different from a water-soaked corpse and too much moisture would only speed up decay.
“Well, you can’t rule it out, can you?” Bobby shifted his gaze over to Dean before turning it to Detective Connolly.
Estelle opened it, flooding the room with the scent of roses. She snatched the shirt from the bag and unfolded it, draping it across the table, revealing the long streaks of bright red blood that stained the back. Estelle crossed herself and shoved it back in the bag.
Jesus grabbed Simon’s arm, pulling him back around. He narrowed his eyes. “I’m still the head of this family, brother. You should show me respect.”
,” Sister Joan said, concerned. She looked at Dean with hope instead of pity. “You’re going to need it.”
Mary laughed. “I know. I still love you.” She cuddled up to John as he tossed the comforter around them. She was quiet for a moment as she stared at the photo in his hand, her fingers brushing against the image. “Four months from now we’re gonna be
it your own. You’ve shaped it with your experiences, the life you’ve led. It’s always belonged to you.”
“I don’t know.” Dean paused, pulling his keys out of his pocket and handing them out to Bobby. “Maybe you should drive back to the motel.”
Dean turned his head, setting his eyes on Alastair, who stood behind him, hovering. Slowly, his gaze lowered to the bloody knife held in his shaking hand, still marred with a nail wound in the center of the palm, his fingers barely able to grasp the blade’s handle.
“That’s fine with me.” Dean shrugged. He made his way through the door, touching the mezuzah briefly as he walked through the threshold.
doubt.” He looked over at Jesus. “I’m sure, being the Messiah; you must think that horrible of me to say.”
“No. I was sweating blood last night.” Dean winced, shifting on the sleeping bag. “They didn’t open up until this morning.”
“Why do you need to save the world? Why do you think people need you to save them? Come with me, come back to me. I need you, Dean.
Even though her back was turned, Dean could see her bless the glass and quickly dip the end of her rosary into the water before she turned back around and brought it over to him.
“Are you sure these are gonna work?" Dean cocked an eyebrow, brushing the needles from his jacket and hair. “Those lights look like they’re older than me.”
Castiel nodded. “You two are a lot alike.  Like you, Jesus was the dutiful eldest son, a protective older brother. He was also very stubborn.” He took a deep breath. “But he cared about others deeply and had a strong thirst for justice.” He looked at Dean sincerely. “You might not give the Sermon on the Mount, but you’d certainly drive the money-changers from The Temple.”
Sam turned to see Brett, the same man in the photograph, surrounded by a group of what Sam assumed were the bar’s regular patrons, his face now completely healed.
When Jesus arrived, John greeted him with joy, asking right away if he wanted to be baptized, but Jesus declined. He had gone there for cleansing, for absolution, for forgiveness, but he didn’t think himself worthy of the absolution the waters promised. Not yet.
The mass went smoothly despite Dean barely knowing when to stand, kneel or sit. That was until the priest started saying the prayers of Holy Communion. As the priest was blessing the wafers and wine, Dean’s wrists and ankles began to ache with a sharp pain. Dean quickly pulled one of the sleeves on his jacket up.
The stench of sulfur surrounded Sam. Strong, but quickly dissipating, like an early morning drunken stupor.
After a few moments, Sam was greeted by a short, middle-aged priest with a mug of tea in his hand. “Hi… Father Michael Frati?” Sam smiled awkwardly as he quickly regained his composure. “I’m Sam. I called earlier?”
He carried her to the table in the kitchenette, dropping her onto it with a thud. He immediately moved his lips to her collarbone, unhooking her bra, flinging it aimlessly across the room.
:: The Gospel of Mark, the earliest composed gospel, has no post resurrection appearances by Jesus in its earliest surviving manuscripts. It simply states that the women who went to the tomb on Sunday morning found Jesus’ body gone. A 'young man dressed in a white robe' sitting in the tomb tells them of Jesus’ resurrection and the women flee the tomb in fear. In later gospels, such as The Gospel of Luke, the resurrected Jesus goes unrecognized at first by his disciples when he appears to them.
“If I’m not mistaken,” Castiel began, “it’s customary to leave your head uncovered while in church.” His voice was leading.
Sam flung Dean’s arm around his shoulder, starting the slow and clumsy walk upstairs with Bobby spotting them while they ascended.
He couldn’t stay. He needed to leave before too many more people filtered in and he drew attention to himself.  He contemplated standing up and slipping away through the nave, but he doubted his body could make it. He doubted even more that he could take sit through another Palm Sunday Mass.
“I wanted to think that maybe this was something we actually had a shot at stopping. For once.” Sam took a defeated breath, holding it in before he turned and left the room, closing the door behind him.
But Dean-Jesus- did love him. He just couldn’t acknowledge it. Part of him and always felt that he wasn’t supposed to find love. He had a different purpose. But had found love with Mariamne- Mary Magdalene. Maybe he wanted to feel normal. Human. Have the one thing he had denied himself. Maybe it was the work of the angels to ensure that his bloodline lived on. After all, Dean and Sam needed to exist. Dean wasn’t sure.
“Cas,” Dean said bluntly, drumming his thumb against the bottle. “He told me while I was staying at the convent.”
Dean got up and walked over to the window. Rufus’ front steps were covered in snow so much that the steps were no longer visible. The driveway and the Impala was buried in a blanket of snow
The two men Castiel did know well were seated at the end of the table where they joked quietly with each other between sips of wine. They were brothers. The two eldest sons of a carpenter from Nazareth. The younger one was called James. The older one was called Jesus.
Sam stood there for a moment. He was utterly silent as he grabbed his flannel shirt and jacket from the floor, quickly making his way over to the motel room door.
Without another word, Sam picked Ruby up by her thighs, wrapping her legs around his hips as he slammed her against the door. He kissed her deeply, all tongue and bitten lips. He could taste the faint traces of sulfur on her skin, and smell it within her hair. Despite himself, he let go to pull her jacket and shirt off, and she lifted her bare arms to wrap around his shoulders.
“He’s probably talking his flock down.” Dean shrugged. “Either that, or he’s helping them gather up rocks to bludgeon me with.”
Jesus was a Michael Sword. A true vessel of Michael. James was the vessel of Lucifer. Jesus was not only to fight Satan and destroy the world, but fight and kill his own brother and he was to do so not as himself, but as little more than a receptacle for an archangel.
The waitress came back with Jimmy’s milkshake and Dean’s coffee, setting them in front of each of them. “How long has it been since you’ve seen them?”
:: Francis of Assisi was the first recorded stigmatic. He was claimed to have received the wounds in 1224, two years before his death. Pio of Pietrelcina, also know as Padre Pio, was a 20th century stigmatic. Both Pio and Francis were friars and claimed to have had a vision of a seraph before before receiving the wounds. Catherine of Siena was a 14th century nun who was claimed to have suffered from 'invisible stigmata', were she felt the pain of the wounds, but had no physical marks on her body. She was also claimed to have the ability to survive exclusively on holy communion.
“Well...we’ll see.” Bobby scratched his head under his hat. He plugged the light set into a random socket, checking them.
“No,” Sam replied. “We’re just hunting demons and — all things considered— Dean could use some extra protection.”
The three of them made their way into the kitchen where they sat down and ate. Even though it had no taste, Dean ate two full bowls of the stew. After dinner, Susan brought Dean into the half-finished nursery. One side of the room was painted bubblegum pink and rabbit themed, stark against the cream colored walls and simple daybed with a quilt on the other side of the room.
The smell of olive wood faded and the air once again turned cold and filled with the smell of maple trees and engine oil.  Dean blinked. He looked up to find Castiel standing few feet in front of him, his expression for once completely clear to Dean. He was afraid.
“Well, while you were busy doing whatever it was that was more important than answering your damn phone during Holy Week; your brother’s been laying a pool of his own blood and I’ve been up to my eyeballs in it,” Bobby snapped. “So next time you wanna come storming into my house like that,
“I’ve learned more than enough.” Castiel looked up at the crucifix hanging up behind the altar. He glared. “Not every prophet was slain by
In one quick movement, Castiel grabbed him. He slammed his hand onto Dean’s shoulder, holding on to it with such force that his grace burned into deep into the flesh, searing it.
Dinah nodded. “Last night, before you came back home, he and Judah came by. They don’t want you to come to the wedding.”
A heavy breath left Dean’s mouth as he lowered his head back down. He wiped the tears from his eyes and dug his hands into his hair.
Jesus and the Apostles were seated around a table in a small second-floor inn room, a spread of figs, hummus, and flatbread before them. Joining them at the table were Simon and Judas.
blood relationship. Most of the time, when we reincarnated- or whatever- something would be off. Like...we’d be brothers but I’d be younger and he’d be older or we’d be cousins. At least once we were sisters which- apparently- wasn’t close enough.  But a lotta times we weren’t even related.”
thing?” Dean let out a desperate chuckle as he took another sip from his drink, shaking his head. “I’m telling you that’s bullshit.”
him, and then you allow The Abomination to take him away when he’s supposed to be seeking atonement?” Uriel walked over to him, frustration tingeing his words. “Our mission is to watch over Dean Winchester. We’re only supposed to interfere when it’s absolutely necessary.”
The last leg of Dean’s trip was on Route 60, comprised mostly of walking and sleeping under highway overpasses. The one oil truck that picked Dean up some fifty miles west of the Mississippi River let him off at a Mobil station in Murray. Instead of trying to hitchhike as freezing rain began to fall around him, Dean remembered that Jacob Miller, a Lutheran pastor who had helped John and him out on a string of hunts while Sam was at Stanford, lived in the area. He decided to walk to Jacob’s house for a visit, and hopefully, a bed to sleep in.
“Ideally, the Jordan.” Castiel’s voice was simple as he walked over to him. “But he’s a God of the wilderness. If you’re going to try to find Him, Dean, you’ll find Him in the wilderness.”
He made his way back into the village, passing farmers making their way to fields and olive groves. They stared at him, almost as though they had seen a ghost. When he made into the village, the women huddled around the well gave him curious looks, whispering to each other.
“Killing Lilith and breaking the final Seal.” Dean said bluntly, grabbing the keys. “ If he does, the world is gonna get fried and it will have me and him to thank for it.”
“You call letting Dean go out into the world like that alone “watching over him”?” Anna cocked an eyebrow. “He’s not safe.”
They were just about ready to pull onto Interstate 84 when Dean suddenly twisted in the seat, shooting Sam an angry look.
Dean let out a sigh. “Bobby, this problem ain’t gonna go away until we find The Whore. That’s what Cas said. Until we shank her ass these assholes are gonna keep popping up.”
“How many times do I have to tell you this? I don’t exorcise demons for kicks,” Sam spat. “I do it for the
“That’s enough, Uriel,” Castiel snapped. He put his hand in front of Uriel as walked over to Sam. “What you’re asking of us isn’t possible, Sam. We can’t do that.”
Sam lowered his hand. The thumping slowed. It was over. Lilith was gone. He took in a deep breath of relief. But the relief didn’t last long. The smoke that had crept itself through his body didn’t fade. It lingered on him, like the stench of death. Putrid and rotting.
Instead, he picked up the newspaper beside him, scanning the front page briefly before flipping through the obituaries and classifieds. Between looking for hunts, he searched for any stories that could point to Dean. Heartwarming pieces on spontaneously cured cancer patients, the ravings of a pastor in the religion section, even anecdotes about running into a hitchhiker matching Dean’s description in fluff pieces. Anything that could be a lead.
The priest shook his head. “The angels don’t speak to me. I’m just more aware of things than most people.”
“About what?” Dean cocked an eyebrow. He put the bible that Sister Joan had lent him onto the pew, and crossed his arms.
“Hello Dean.” Castiel walked down the altar’s steps, stopping right in front of the pew where Dean was seated. He watched Dean for a second. “You look… exhausted.” Sympathy laced his words.
Sam tossed back the rest of his drink. A moment passed before he spoke again. “So, exorcising demons is a
Half of the seals had been broken already. Castiel knew what would happen if Dean wasn’t purified by the time the last seal was broken. He knew just as well what could happen if Dean became a spotless Lamb before the final seal was broken. What his sanctified body and soul had the power to do when it was pure and whole again. He knew what his siblings would force Dean to do if he didn’t start following their orders.
Castiel knew Dean wasn’t fine. The kitchen reeked with the stench of bacon grease. From the moment they stepped into the room, he could sense that it was giving Dean a headache and twisting his stomach.
Slowly Sam stepped into the room. He stared at Dean for a moment before turning his gaze to Bobby. “But...
Dean closed his eyes. “So all these visions I’ve been having.” He swallowed, opening his eyes again, blinking tears away. “They’re my own….
become. Signs just like the wounds that marked his body. Though weeks had passed since the last one, Dean knew more wounds were coming, he just wasn’t sure when.
Then Sam noticed the smell. That fragrant stench that had begun the night before had now engulfed the whole room. Roses.
Jesus pieced together a crude shelter from tree limbs and brush, where they waited out the storm. By the time the rain relented, the sun was low in the sky and they decided to make camp for the night.
Sister Joan turned and faced Dean. “You haven’t noticed anything strange have you?” Her voice was calm, but Dean could hear a slight tremble in it. “The smell of rotting eggs? Strange people following you?”
With a cry, Dean raised the knife, thrusting it downward. His eyes snapped shut at the sound of the woman’s bloodcurdling screams.
A few moments later Bobby followed him out to the front porch. A few yards away,  he could see Sam walking down the driveway of the salvage yard, with a flask in hand, picking up hubcaps and throwing them as he went.
The angels had been sent down to watch over the child and to protect him if necessary. Even though King Herod was dying, he was still ruthless and paranoid and would slaughter the child if word of his birth got out.
knows.” Sam chuckled. “Every time we go to one these churches there’s always someone who knows who you are and you always just brush it under the table. You’re
that.” Sam stopped in his tracks, just short of the door. “I just don’t think I should be doing—” he paused, turning as he shot Ruby a look “—
He managed to eat only half of it before he put it back down on the plate, almost despite himself. Almost.
Something snapped within Jesus. In one quick motion, he drew back his fist and swung at Simon, landing a punch across his jaw.
He marched into the foyer, quickly putting on his boots, socks and jacket before running into the kitchen, where, to his relief, he found the Impala’s keys lying haphazardly on the counter.
ago,” Zachariah scoffed. “We’re different people now. In your case. Literally. It’s time we moved past that. After all, we have the same goal now.”
“You wanna see my side?” Dean cocked an eyebrow. “I’ve got that too.” He pulled his T-shirt up over his head, taking it off. He held it tightly in his hand, lifting his arms up slightly. “Now are you gonna stop with this Doubting Thomas bullshit or what?
Dean was more stubborn, more willful, far less willing to accept his fate. Though that gave Castiel some hope, it couldn’t drive the ghost from him.
Sam watched as she drove off, waiting until her car was out of sight before he climbed into the Impala. As soon as he shut the door, he opened the flask and took a brief sip from it. He sighed, relived as the cool taste of iron, plasma and sulfur made its way down his throat. He quickly shoved the flask into the pocket of his jacket and started the car, driving back to the motel.
Wiping the bile away from his mouth, Dean looked at Castiel through the tears prickling his eyes. He stood up and walked over to him. Dean tried to shove him, but the angel didn’t move. “The fuck did you do that for?!” he yelled. “I could’ve gotten Sam out of there! Saved him!” Dean walked away from the angel, digging his fingers anxiously into his hair, pulling at his scalp. “
“Nope. The Klan drove them out. Set fire to their house. Lynched a couple of my great-great uncles-may their memory be a blessing.”
Jimmy stared at them for a moment until he spoke again, lifting his gaze towards Dean. “Castiel told me about you. Who you are. That’s why I said ‘yes.’”
Dean only had to walk a couple blocks until he came upon St. Mary’s Cathedral. He had seen the steeples of it through a light haze of snow as he walked down the street from the coffee shop and made his way directly over to it as quickly as he could manage. It was majestic—old and gothic—with high steeples and a rose window in front.
As soon as the door closed, tears flooded Dean’s eyes. When the sound of Sam’s footsteps had disappeared down the hall, Dean let out a broken sob, sucking in raspy breath after raspy breath as his chest heaved.
By midnight, Castiel had killed two demons and three of his brothers. Their bodies lay at the entrance of the garden, the charred impressions of their wings contrasted highly against the sand in the moonlight.
have that Jesus had convinced himself that he had to die, that it was his destiny even, there was a mantra that played constantly in the back of his mind.  It had lingered quietly during the Last Supper and in Gethsemane. Among the torments of the Roman soldiers, it had screamed.
He climbed into the Impala, tossing the bag onto the passenger seat. Pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose, Sam closed his eyes. He cleared his throat and prayed. “Castiel, you listening? I
Sam didn’t respond. He handed Dean the glass of water and again Dean refused it. Sam paused for a long moment as he watched Dean carefully. “Maybe it was in your mind.”
A pit started to grow in Dean’s stomach. He cleared his throat as he pursed his lips together. “So... How do we stop this?”
Dean sat up, turning in his circle of salt to see John leaning against one of the rotten pews. He moved closer and Dean fought the urge to stand up straight.
hear that. That’s why you nearly blew my eardrums out at the gas station after you yanked me outta Hell. ”
Bobby walked over to him, picking one of the amulets up. “I still can’t believe that you made two anti-possession amulets out of a random branch from the back yard in what? A few hours?”
Castiel pulled the nails out; Dean let out a hoarse moan of pain. “You told me once a long time ago that we always have a choice.” He untied the ropes. Dean fell from the cross and Castiel caught him, throwing him over his shoulders. “You still have one Dean. You can stop this.”
Dean knew these dreams weren’t the result of remembering Hell, even if they often bled into one another.
Jesus and James walked in into the synagogue. As they stepped in, James nudged him in the shoulder and gestured up at the woman’s gallery. Their mother was sitting up there with their sister Dinah and the wives of Judah and Simon.
Dean glanced over at the child again. The boy was whispering something to the pastor, both their eyes landing on Dean briefly before the pastor nodded and sat back in his chair. Dean swallowed hard. “If we leave now the kid and the rest of the congregation are gonna go postal,” Dean rasped. “We’ll wait until it’s over and then haul ass outta here.”
When they got up to the top of the hill, Castiel tossed the crossbeam from his shoulders as he eased Jesus down into the dirt. He glanced around at the hillside before crouched down in front of Jesus. “Michael’s men aren’t here. I’ll stay with you. So you’re not alone.”
Sam flexed his fingers, glazing up at the night sky. Aside from the stars, it was pitch black. No moonlight shone, making it all the more dark. “Powerful.”
“Sam called me, he said you ran off. He thought I could talk some sense into you, so he sent me here.” She held her hand out to him. “Come on, Dean. Let’s go.”
She stared at Dean for a second. Then she gasped, a cloud of breath billowing from her mouth. “It’s…
Jesus was a prophet, the man Castiel’s father had chosen as the Messiah and Castiel was charged with keeping watch over him.
