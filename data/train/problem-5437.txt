By the time they get back to the room, and despite the way he’d tensed up throughout the whole procedure, Tony’s a bundle of playfulness now, talking Steve’s ear off as he’s wheeled down the halls.
"Shhh," Steve whispers, index finger pressed against grinning lips as he looks at Jarvis over the corner of his eye. “They can sense your fear, y’know.”
They get their drinks a minute later– Tony’s almost embarrassed by the noise that leaves him when he takes his first sip of the rich, creamy chocolate, until Steve’s face flushes the prettiest shade of pink, eyes darkening with blatant want, and then it suddenly doesn’t seem so bad– before making their way back to the crowd gathered in front of the tree, and this time, Steve doesn’t bother keeping any distance between them.
“Don’t know. My ass went numb a while back, and my toes are just abou-- no, wait, there they go. Scout’s honor, my ass...”
“Whose side are you on?” Tony narrows his eyes, but there’s no hiding his smile as Steve pulls him away.
“Budge over,” he orders, stretching out his body until it’s inches from Steve’s. “Rockin’ the burrito look, by the way.”
Tony looks ready to argue, but Steve bops his nose before he can, chuckling when Tony wrinkles it a second later. “What was that for?”
The next morning, he walks up the school with his hand around Bucky’s, and his stomach in knots. But like always, seeing Tony and Pepper by the gates eases some of the butterflies flittering around inside him.
Steve closes his eyes, and breathes in the scent of Tony’s hair. “The Tower always feels a little colder when you’re gone.”
It’s not often that words cut Tony to the core, because sometimes he thinks he might’ve been born with armor instead of skin. The ‘in one ear, out the other’ shtick is a reflex at this point, and he can’t remember a time when that wasn’t the case.
“Tonight,” he whispers into Steve’s ear, and then gives it a gentle nip, “this whole fucking floor is our bedroom.”
“I wasn’t gonna miss seeing you in that uniform,” Tony winks, and lets out a laugh when the blond flicks him in the arm.
“Whatever, Auntie Nat,” Tony calls out, and cackles when a dagger suddenly hits the wall beside the elevator doors.
“Fuck you, Stark” Clint crows from the other side of the table, cheeks bulging out like a hamster. “Y’snooze, y’lose!”
you joke about me dying,” Tony humphs, but he’s got a smile on his face that Clint just knows is one only Steve gets to see, and part of him feels like looking away.
“Bring them in, then,” he sighs, waving his hand at the door, and the two men that enter are shorter than him, but in no way small. Tony wonders if there’ll ever be anyone not taller than him.
Ellie barks once but doesn’t go through on her threat. Instead, she leaps up to the bench Tony’s on as he waits out the worst of the storm, nuzzling into his side and wagging her tail happily.
“Thanks, bud. Okay, call it, Cap,” he turns to the blond beside him, who gives him a fond eye roll before addressing the children.
“You hungry?” Steve asks, and Tony’s stomach rumbles before he can reply. “I’ve got your burger in the grill, you came just in time. Medium, right?”
They’re still standing in the middle of the lounge, grinning at each other like a idiots, but god, Tony can’t remember the last time he felt this way about anyone. “You’re not the only one.”
Tony just settles back into his chair, closes his eyes, and revels in the feeling of Steve’s hand on his chest.
“I already am, Red,” Tony replies around a sated smirk as he caresses a particularly deep mark with a finger. “Pretty damn often, in fact–”
Steve wastes no time in doing so, and with a bright, happy laugh, sweeps Tony into his arms to crash their lips together.
“I’m gonna barf,” Clint mutters, low enough that only Natasha can hear him. “Honestly, I dunno why I expected anything else.”
“But the fact remains-- oh, hold on a sec,” she presses a hand to the bluetooth.  “Chris? No, we’re still here. Yes, all of us...”
There’s a blur that pops into view, and then Tony lets out a breath as the camera shakes again– a little harder this time– when said blur barrels into Maria’s legs. “
“Sorry for, uh, springing this on you,” he finally says, voice rough and raspy, “I don’t even know why I even did that without thinking, it was weird– well, not weird for me, since I was the one to just fucking plant it on you, but, y’know, I’d totally get it if it made you uncomfortable, again, sorry–”
Tony rolls his eyes, but a moment later, he’s leaning up and pressing a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “The things I do for you…”
“Here. Let me,” a smooth, amused voice cuts in, right into his ear, and Steve can’t help the full bodied shiver that runs through him when he looks over his shoulder and finds dark eyes inches from his.
Steve nods, even though the glimmer of concern has yet to leave his eyes. “Sure I am. But let me go find someone to help you out, alright? Seein’ the two of you’s killin’ me.”
“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Steve looks over at him fondly, and Tony can’t resist winking at him.
“Still,” Pepper sighs, running a finger along the baby’s chubby little cheek. “She looks like a doll!”
“So…” Steve says quietly, after some minutes of careful silence. “Was it as bad as you thought it’d be?”
“I really do,” Tony says. “But in case you don’t,” he points to where Rhodey’s still sitting and glaring at him, “I spilled my coffee all over the table-- and all over my friend-- the second I heard your voice. Sorry, honey bear,” he calls out, but Rhodey just flips him off.
Steve’s eyes are still wet, but when he nods, the determined set of his jaw is comfortably familiar. “I’ve always wanted to go to one those Christmas Tree farms.”
“Nothing, Miss Potts,” Daisy shakes her head, but she’s hesitant like she never is, and it’s only when she holds out the pile in her arms to Pepper that Pepper realizes it’s not papers at all.
Tony scoffs as he follows him up, and doesn’t even bother looking away from his boyfriend’s ass. “You fucked me against the wall twice last night–”
“Shut up and keep cookin’,” Tony huffs, but the smile on his face is more peaceful and genuine than she can ever remember it being, and as she looks down at her breakfast and digs in, she finds herself feeling just the same.
“Promise me?” Tony blurts, clutching at the cushions, at his best friend, at anything that will keep him from falling down and falling apart.
“I do,” she nods. She looks so desperate, it’s almost painful. “You were twelve, and you wanted gran– you wanted him to notice.”
Steve turns to look at him, all thoughts of drying dishes forgotten. “It’s not like they don’t mean it.”
There's a second of silence, then another, and then just as Tony’s about to pull back, one of Steve's hands comes up to encircle Tony's wrist, his soft skin burning like a brand around Tony's.
Clint and Sam whine their displeasure even as they lick the rest of the tomato sauce from their fingers, and Natasha chews her pizza silently, narrowed green eyes peeking out from under her hood as she sits curled up beside Bruce.
Steve’s been half-hard from the moment he saw him, and everything else about the man sure as hell isn’t helping him– dark, tousled locks Steve’s hands are itching to touch, and his smile…
Between their classrooms is a door that stands at the back of Tony’s and opens right next to the other room’s whiteboard, and thank god for the glass window that takes up the top half of the door— the one that neither of them has tried to cover— because nothing makes his day better than catching a glimpse of those shoulders.
“That’s ‘cause she’s a smart girl. She knows awesome when she sees it, doesn’t she?” he teases, jostling Natasha until she breathes out a chuckle into his neck.
Steve looks at him over his shoulder. “Are you?” he says, and the weariness in his voice is the last straw.
Still, as much as he’d like to keep staring, the music is starting to get annoying. It’s not the first time Mr. Rogers has played songs for his students, but Tony can only take so many Nocturnes and Opuses, so he walks to his desk— he’s past ignoring his class, they could probably use a break; it’s not his grade, anyway— and grabs his little stack of bright, gold sticky notes.
“Not one word,” he hisses. Steve just leans in again to press one last, chaste kiss to Tony’s flushed skin.
“Papa, yours!” Their daughter holds out a tiny tea cup, and Steve takes it with a happy ‘thank you’ before taking a sip.
“So now,” Steve continues, cheeks flushing the prettiest shade of pink Tony’s ever seen, “I’m going to sleep in. And you,” he tightens his hold, “are going to do the same.”
.” He vaguely registers Rhodey bumping into him softly from behind, barely remembers how to breathe when he turns the aisle and catches sight of the most beautiful human being he’s ever seen.
, developing more feelings for his best friend is about the last thing he needs--God knows the ones he already has haven't been easy to ignore, but Tony's done a fucking beautiful job of doing it.
Steve nods. “Yeah, I…” His voice trails off as he looks around, and Tony sees a shiver run through him. “I rememb-ber a b-building… ‘tasha… Are
“Steve,” Shaggy puts a hand on his shoulder, but Steve-- god, that’s a beautiful name, for a beautiful man-- shakes his head.
“Sweetie?” he whispers, but the little girl just whimpers when he uncovers her face. She’s flushed and sweaty, and he knows without even touching her that she’s not well. “Aw, baby–”
“Yeah, we’ve got a number of ‘em,” the blond laughs, “including these little buds.” He gestures to the litter of golden retrievers yipping and running and doing their best to climb him as high as they can.
“I don’t sound like that,” he points out, jabbing Steve’s bicep hard, and tries not to let his hand linger.
“For what? Wasn’t your idea to…” he waves his hand around, “y’know. It’s not like I fucking remember it anyway.”
Steve just nods, and it’s not even ten seconds later after his friend walks away that he once again finds himself staring at the most beautiful man he’s ever seen. He’s standing a long ways away, on the other side of the not-so-crowded bar, leaning against a tall table in a way that accentuates the leanness of his body, the strength of his legs, and the delicious curve of his ass.
This morning is dim and grey, with rain splattering heavily on the outer windows loud enough to disrupt the steady tempo of Tony’s voice as he goes over catalysts and chemical reactions. He’s just getting ready to take questions, though, when the first riffs of “
“Nothing,” Tony says quickly. His shoulders tense almost imperceptibly, and oh, he’s not even looking at Steve anymore.
“I’ll hold you to that, Mister Stark,” Steve says, and as Tony picks up his first forkful of Spaghetti, he feels better than he has all day.
Steve rolls his eyes as he enters the building, and then smiles when he hears the man’s laughter follow him inside.
“You know it, baby,” he waggles his eyebrows, but then feels his heart skip a beat when Steve buries his head under Tony’s jaw. “What is it now?” he asks gently.
“You meatball,” he mutters, but his lips are quirked up in a helpless smile. “One day, I’m gonna end up drowning in all your sap.”
“Did you...” Steve smiles shyly, and looks at Tony from beneath his eyelashes even though he’s, like, half a foot taller. “Does that mean you heard everything you just thought about me in my voice?”
“And nothin’ in between,” Tony leers, and pulls at Steve’s belt. “So chop chop, Captain, wanna see some skin.”
Steve shakes his head and stands up, sketchbook pressed against his chest as he grabs Tony and excuses them both.
“You’re so impatient,” Steve says, but pulls Tony closer until their cocks brush against each other through their pants.
A burst of laughter leaves Steve’s lips before he can stop it, loud and utterly unprofessional, and really, Dr. Erksine would be rolling over in his grave if he could see Steve now. “Mr. Stark,” he says slowly, as firm as he can manage. “I need you to tell me how you feel.”
So, references here for Starbucks drink sizes, cuz they’re stupid and don’t make sense but that’s the way it is, and I used ‘em here-- their small is ‘tall’, medium is ‘grande’, and large is ‘venti’.
“I’d be h-happy to... do that f-for ya, Cap,” Tony manages to breathe out in between bouts of laughter. His eyes are bright with mirth, hair tousled by the ocean breeze, and even with his blunder, Steve finds himself breathless at the beauty of it. “Really, just name the day, I’ll wake myself up at the crack of dawn to do it.”
Tony looks down at the cookies, and then sneaks a glance over at him. “I just… want her to, uh. Y’know…”
Tony barely manages to hide the shiver that runs down his spine at the whisper soft touch of the blond’s fingers along his sweater-clad side. “Don’t try to charm your way out of this, big guy.”
! Take it away, Dummy!” he yells, laughing when his robot beeps and whirrs and rolls this way and that.
“Then you better find someone else to bunk with tonight,” Tony says, slowly so that they understand every word. “Because Steve’s a screamer.”
“I was thinking... Rembrandt,” Steve says, lifting the dog up to bury his face in the soft fur, and Tony resolutely ignores the voice in his head telling him that Rhodey might be right.
“Shut up,” Steve chuckles, and Tony feels the vibrations of it spread through his chest and over the rest of his body. “You’re ridiculous and I love you.”
He stumbles into Steve’s space, and breathes out a frankly pathetic sigh of disbelief when his forehead meets a warm, familiar shoulder. “What the fuck.”
“Whatever you say, Stark. Now come on, up and at ‘em,” Barnes grins, rising from his crouch and jerking his head toward the door. “And I’ll tell you what: if I’m wrong– which I’m not– I’ll even let you hit me right in the kisser.”
“I don’t wanna make you worry,” Steve replies. “I tried tellin’ the guys to try to get someone else--”
“Something small,” Tony replies. “It’s for my PA– well, she’s not my PA. Not anymore. Turns out I make a shit CEO. Anyway, she seems like a… little dog person.”
Bucky and Pepper are as adorable in their costumes as they are any other day, and watching them charm the pants off every house they go to makes Steve happier than he’s been in a long time.
“Yeah?” Steve asks, voice as soft as his eyes are hopeful, and really, he has no business looking better than anything Tony’s ever seen. “Shit, okay, that’s– oh man, I’m actually feelin’ a little lightheaded again…”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Rhodey sighs, patting Tony’s shoulder as he gets up. “I gotta meet up with Carol for the Chem project, ‘kay? I’ll meet up with you after school.”
But all of that... it’s no match for the part of him that wants to open those doors and run into the arms of the only person he’s ever loved unconditionally.
“The things I do for you…” Steve calls out, but Tony can hear the fondness in his voice as he walks away.
“No, I need– I need sit rep, I need to talk to Nat, Clint– Barnes, they’ll know,” he rasps out, and manages to stay upright as he all but bolts out the room.
“Well, I sure wouldn’t be opposed to ‘em. But mostly, I just really wanna know why you’re doing this.”
Pepper scoffs. “No you wouldn’t. Just feed it and talk to it, and set reminders that you’ll listen to.”
“Good job,” Tony says, not bothering to hide his smile at Steve’s blatant interest in his sandwich. “You still hungry?” From the corner of his eye, he sees their teammates look over with grins of their own.
He’s returning the kiss before he even realizes-- it’s a reflex at this point, really, because there will never be a time where he has Tony’s lips on his and he won’t kiss back-- but pulls away with a grimace a second later.
God, Steve wants to kiss him more than he’s ever wanted to do anything in his life. “Okay,” is all he can say.
. It pisses on half the surfaces it finds, and claws the other half. More than once, Tony’s come home to shredded pillows, the smell of urine all around his furniture, and Jarvis sitting right in the middle of the mess, eyes big and green and smug as anything. But Tony
“Y-yeah?” Comes the soft reply, and Tony turns to find Steve leaning against a section of a wall, face flushed with effort and matted with sweaty hair. His teeth are chattering more than they were before, so loud that Tony can hear them from where he’s standing.
“You’re not as quick as you think you are, though,” he tells Tony. “Distracting me won’t change the fact that we’re not buying a dog.”
,” he glares at Steve, “finished all the milk this morning, so, y’know... Anyway, hand it over, sunshine.”
“Ha ha,” Steve rolls his eyes, but pulls him closer, and then they’re dancing again around the space Tony just rocked out in. Steve spins him away and brings him back in, and they’re not moving in time with the music for some reason– always a beat or two behind– but it doesn’t matter because Steve keeps humming and chuckling at their antics, and his eyes are bright and clear and
Tony can only shake his head, because Steve has a ring, a ring for Tony, a ring that Tony’s never known he wanted so much. He doesn’t care what it’s made of, for Christ’s sake!
“Did you find–hey, no, Cap, a little to the left… Perfect.” he tells Steve, who sets the tree back down with a bright, boyish grin, and Tony’s chest blooms with a familiar, all-encompassing warmth.
“Alright, alright,” Tony rolls his eyes. “What’s the best part, then? And if you say something ridiculous like the mini quiches–”
He actually manages to convince himself of that by the time the group gathers in the living room a couple of minutes later. Clint and Barnes even have giant bowl of popcorn settled between them, and Natasha’s eyes gleam in anticipation as she presses play on the video.
Rhodey’s eyes-- half-lidded and hazy from alcohol-- meet Tony’s and then Steve’s resolutely, before he sticks his head in between the bars, and says: “He s-sits’n a throne... of
“Empty threats,” Steve grins. “Now come on, Shellhead– Buck might be a crack shot, but you and I make a damn good team. Let’s go show these bastards who’s boss.”
"Hiya back,” Steve smiles, exactly like he did eleven weeks ago. He's wearing his stealth suit, hair slightly matted with sweat and what looks like dirt, but he's still the most beautiful thing Tony's ever seen.
“Now c’mon, gimme gimme!” Tony plops down on the blanket and makes grabby hands, heart skipping a beat when Steve sit down close enough for their thighs to touch.
“Get outta here,” Steve rolls his eyes; his entire body feels warm, and aware of Tony’s body in a way it never is with anyone else.
“Aren’t I always careful? Ah, don’t answer that,” Tony grins, just as Steve opens his mouth to reply. “Gotta tell ya, Cap-- didn’t see any of this coming.”
Steve’s laughter is warm on his cheek. “You won’t be sayin’ that when you see how much food I’ve made. We’ve got enough for leftovers for the whole team.”
“Still want your pizza?” He asks, and when he feels a nod against his shoulder, he grabs their plates once more. “And now it’s cold again, but
“Told you I was a good actor too,” is all he says, and Tony throws the plastic spoon at him when everything clicks.
“Kidding, I’m kidding,” Tony reaches up to bop Steve’s nose, and then laughs when the blond wrinkles it a second later. “You’ll be fine, you won’t mess it up, I trust you.”
“I’m not leaving,” Stark says casually, like he almost wasn’t falling apart a couple of minutes ago. “He’s not leaving,” he points to Bucky, “so just close those baby blues, and go the fuck to sleep.”
His daughter just buries her head in his neck, and grips his shirt tightly as he carries her out the door and down to his room.
“You little cutie,” he sighs, and watches a handful of people running past the gazebo, jackets and newspapers held over the head to stay dry. Not that they succeed, but it’s still amusing to see them try. “Figures I’d get fucked the only day I let Pepper guilt trip me into doing this.”
“What, a fella can’t look at his sweetheart whenever he wants, or does he need permission now?” Steve continues, blue eyes bright with humor and so much genuine admiration, Tony’s cheeks begin to burn in an all too familiar blush.
“We needs a twee worthy of my Asgawdian woots!” Thor booms, running circles around his pick, and Rhodey’s quick to voice his agreement.
“Look at me,” Barnes says, and when Tony does, he’s surprised to see the soldier smiling at him. “I’m pretty sure I still know him better than anyone, and I sure as hell wouldn’t be down here if I didn’t know for a fact that Steve is just as gone for you as you are for him.”
Tony bites his lip, and then leans up to press a quick kiss to Steve’s cheek. “There. Don’t lose, big guy.”
“Perfect. Love you,” Tony says, then leans down, grabs a fistful of the blond’s shirt, and kisses him square on the mouth.
“Oh, my sweet summer child,” Tony huffs pitifully, dabbing at his nose with a tissue. “You’re still so naive to the ways of the world–”
“As long as it’s delivery, though, ‘cause I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty comfortable where I am.”
“It’s the least you can do,” Tony says, heart skipping a beat as Steve’s breath brushes his cheek like a kiss.
“That’s the plan, ain’t it?” Steve says quietly, shy and hesitant all of a sudden. “You and me, forever?”
Tony doesn’t let her get any farther than that. “Okay, I’m outta here,” he says loudly, standing so fast, he almost sends his chair toppling behind him. “Good luck in prison–”
“Watch that beak, Barton,” he replies, eyebrow raised in warning. “Wouldn’t want your share of dinner ending up in the trash.”
“You’ve gotta be shitting me. Just… give me a moment…” he takes a deep breath, and finds the courage to look at the woman– at his
“Boo fucking hoo…” Tony rolls his eyes, and bumps shoulders with the blond as they make their way further into the lot.
A small, pitiful breath tickled Steve’s throat. That was definitely a downside to realistic dreams. He’d never been so aroused while sleeping. “So what’s it?” he asked, his voice hoarse. “You want to sleep with me—”
He hadn’t recognized it at first, that fluttering feeling inside him, but there it was. It was a warmth he’d never known before, a yearning he was only slowly learning to live with. And it scared him—not just the love in itself, although that was unbelievably overwhelming, too, but also because he had a feeling that his love would never be returned.
Tony swallowed, his eyes still staring at him, but Steve could see he was already on the verge of escaping into Extremis again. “It did. I’m just… tired. Haven’t slept properly in a while. Guess the last weeks took a little more from me than I thought they would. Just too much going on.”
Steve on his part just rolled his eyes, as always, knowing exactly what Tony was up to, but the smile on his face stayed firmly in place.
He knew he needed to protect his family. That always came first. Signing the Accords might just be the easiest way to do it, and a not-too-small part of him wanted to go down there and simply get it out of the way. Return home and let the government draw consequences on their own accords, and simply live his life.
“Neither do I.” Tony’s hand clutched at Steve and he fell against him willingly, his own arms pulling Tony closer into his embrace. “Shh,” Tony murmured soothingly. “It’s alright. Everything’s gonna be alright. We’re just gonna keep trying. It’s what we do.”
crossed his lips only a few years ago—he really had changed a lot more than he had realized. “My kid’s a bit of a nightmare these days.” He offered his hand. “Tony Stark, I don’t think we’ve met.”
Similarly, Tony’s body tightened and his breathing stopped altogether. He swallowed and looked away. Did Steve seriously ask him this? “You know, it’s not exactly like I have an off-switch when it comes to my feelings.”
He smiled at Steve, then, and Steve smiled back. They looked at each other with a calm understanding. All of those sacrifices they’d made since they’d met in that shabby boxing club years ago were all there, right there in the air between them. And yet… Steve knew without word that Tony would gladly do it all over again. And so would Steve.
Steve was leaning over him. Bracing himself against the car floor on Tony’s good side, he lifted him up. Tony’s head lulled before coming to a rest on Steve’s shoulder,  making Natasha and Clint exchange worried looks.
Steve gave a mild huff, sitting down next to Tony and casting him a cautious smile. “It’s just a tent. Come on, let me help you.”
Pepper stares at him for a second or two, and then sighs. “I don’t– it’s…” she flounders, “…I have absolutely no idea.”
Steve can’t keep his cheeks from flushing, or his lips from curling up. “Well, you can always switch over to 103.7,” he says, “the Odinson brothers have a heavy rock station that actually runs all night, if that’s more your thing.”
“Fine,” he replies, already feeling the corner of his lips turn up. He tries to focus on helping Rhodey’s little sister look at the camera instead of the veritable explosion of colorful decorations around her. “What’re ya doin’ here?”
“Figured out where all the self-destruct triggers were, I see,” she says casually, even as her eyes turn that familiar, determined shade of steely blue.
“You cannot be real,” Tony decides, trying not to let his eyes roam too shamelessly. “I think I, uh, might need to make some more observations. Y’know, for-- for science and all that.”
Until one day, when he’s in the middle of enjoying a night in to draw-– at the end of the day, no matter what, Steve can always unwind with his sketchbook and pencils-– and Tony’s voice comes in through the walls, loud and clear and so excited that Steve is helpless to stop his lips from curling up.
“That was the idea,” Steve says, biting his lip as he fiddles with his fingers. He’s so adorable, it’s almost too much.
Tony’s grin when she tells him so is pure contentment, and it only makes Pepper’s chest warm even more. “Cap tends to have that effect on people.”
By the time school starts again, Steve's put on more than fifty pounds of muscle, and it's all Tony can do to keep from whimpering every time he sees him, because
“Kinda hard not to, when you hijack the school speaker system in the middle of the morning announcements to ask me.”
"Yes, sir," he says, and leans the rest of the way to take Steve's lips with his own, slow and whisper-soft. Steve's arms feel like warm sunlight around his waist, and not for the first time, Tony thinks he could stay there forever, with his bare feet on the cold wooden floor and the smell of coffee and Steve and home in his lungs.
,” Tony muffles his face into Steve’s shoulder. “I always forget how fucking sappy you get after missions, Jesus...”
“Is that what we’re calling it now, Rogers? So romantic,” Tony quips, and he’s so distracted by rifling through the messy clothes for his Captain America shirt that he doesn’t notice Steve walking across the room towards him until he feels that warm, familiar chest press into his back. “Well, hello there,” he drawls, looking up to meet Steve’s eyes in their reflection.
. God, I feel like a fucking teenager,” he says. “I can’t... I can’t go up to him and just ask, Pepper.” His heart skips a beat at the thought.
"Objection! Mommies can be tall and big too," Tony points out gently; their team, as always, just barrels on.
“Any pancakes left?” he finally decides to ask, hopping up onto the last stool when the team nods, and seconds later, Steve slide a plate piled high in front of him. “Thank you,” Tony says softly, looking up at the blond over the rim of his frames.
Tony looks at their baby a couple of paces ahead of them, hears the soft, beautiful lilt of her voice as she talks to her cat, and groans. “I’m gonna have to do this again, aren’t I?”
The questions hits Tony like a slap in the face, and even the relief he feels is quickly drowned out by anger. “I’m so fucking pissed at you,” he hisses.
Tony’s not expecting anyone to be in the kitchen at five in the morning, but even then, the sight of Steve Rogers buttering toast by the counter is not surprising.
, Tony thinks, and revels in the blond’s whoop of glee as he slams his foot on the pedal and they speed off.
Because as much as he likes pretending to be annoyed, he actually thinks it’s adorable how fixated Tony is on his morning coffee. He’s the most un-morning person Steve has ever known, and no matter how much Steve coaxes him into interacting with the rest of the team over the breakfast table-- or at least acknowledging their existence-- he has yet to witness Tony breathe a word to anyone before downing one or two large mugs of scalding coffee.
The smug laughter his comment prompts is the last thing he hears before the elevator doors close and he’s left alone with his new charge.
“It’s so nice to have the family together,” Natasha murmurs. She’s leaning against Bruce’s shoulder as the two share a bright blue Snuggie, and Tony’s chest warms with fond affection for the two of them.
“Oh, shut up,” Steve giggles, all crinkly eyes and crooked grin, and Pepper takes a long, quiet moment to appreciate the sight.
Tony doesn’t even pay attention to him, already moaning around a mouthful. The rest of the team settle themselves on all the chairs, unwrapping their own food with quiet, comfortable conversation, and Tony revels in the feeling of it all, until he looks back down to pick up his sandwich–
Mr. Rogers turns immediately, and when Tony points to the note, he walks to it, footsteps as slow and rhythmic as before. A couple of students from both rooms turn to the new distraction, but Tony ignores them, choosing to stare at the blond as he reads the note:
Clint sticks out his tongue, but continues. “My little birds got me some names: Hammer, Rumlow, and Stone.”
“I wouldn’t say no to that,” Steve replies, even as his blush grows, and Tony wants nothing more than to taste that smile.
“That you’re fucking delicious,” Tony purrs, licking and kissing the skin beneath Steve’s ear. “I could just eat you up.”
"We can always just blow them off and, y’know..." Tony leers, sneaking a hand down past Steve's belt and relishing the gorgeous blush his actions produce.
Tony’s smile is small, and more than a little weak, but as Steve returns it with one of his own, he feels warmer than he has in days.
Barnes shakes his head as he sips his beer. “You’re ridiculous, punk,” he says, and then laughs when Steve flips him off without lifting his head.
“But we’ve got all night,” Steve reminds him with a smile of his own, leaning up to press his lips to Tony’s. “Hours and hours of you and me–”
Steve doesn’t even flinch. “Watch me,” he says, and just like that, he’s Captain America, all squared shoulders and defiant eyes.
Because this is still his Steve-- the beautiful, stubborn, sarcastic love of Tony’s life-- but now he’s adorable and affectionate, and free in a way that Tony doesn’t think the blond lets himself be. He decides not to think about that bit too much, as he settles further down on the couch with his blond charge lying atop his chest.
“Your window's open, why is your window open?” Tony asks, when he finally makes it to Steve's place-- and no, he didn't shower just for that, he was past due, okay?? His
He doesn’t make it one step in before his eyes find Steve, swaddled in half a dozen blankets and looking out at the gray, snowy skies beyond the glass walls, and he makes a pained, choked-off sound before he even knows he’s opened his mouth.
Tony’s laughing before he knows he’s doing it, loud and real and a little out of place for a quiet coffee shop, but he can’t find it in himself to care when he’s standing in front of the most attractive human being he’s ever seen, when he’s being smiled at the way Steve is smiling at him.
“I know you’ve, um, been pretty busy all day, with the gala and all,” Steve fiddles with his fingers. “So I figured you’d like a second to, y’know… breathe.”
“W-what?” he stutters, and god, he should probably stop staring at Blondie, because now everyone’s staring at him.
When Tony wanders into the kitchen on a quiet, Sunday morning, half awake and running a hand through his tousled, greasy hair, the first thing he sees is Clint’s bright, slightly manic grin. Normally, he would think nothing of it, ignoring him in favor of going through his daily routine; but this time, the sight stops him short before he even reaches the coffee counter. There’s a gleam in the archers’s eye that’s just on the wrong side of normal.
“They’re… Doing that thing that they do, when you want to laugh,” Steve explains meekly, hunching his bony shoulders like he wants make himself smaller than he is.
“You know I wouldn’t,” Steve cuts him off, voice as soft as the arms he winds around Tony’s waist are firm.
“What, they never get to do that– hey, no, don’t go, Cappy bear!” Tony whines, when he feels Steve start to pull away from where he’s all but splayed out on top of him. They’re the only two on the couch, and even with the rest of the team scattered around the room as they settle in for their weekly movie night, Tony only has eyes for the soothing weight above him.
“That makes one of us, ‘cause I’m sure as hell not,” Tony mutters, as he takes a handful of Steve’s jacket sleeve and pulls him toward their first class. “Now come on, I feel like showing off my gift to the gang. You’ll protect me if they try to claw my face off to get these babies, right?”
“Only f’short people!” The girl giggles, wriggling down from Steve’s hold to move a chair with a Captain America plushie to the side. “Y’can sit on th’floor, Papa.”
Margaret Carter Elementary School is a bustle of parents and children when Happy pulls up to the curb, and as Peter’s hand holds tightly onto Tony’s, Tony knows he’s not the only one feeling uncharacteristically hesitant. His son’s eyes are wide as he looks around his surroundings and the other children being dropped off, but he keeps pace with Tony as they make their way through the thinning crowds to room 3A.
Tony pats him on the back in thanks. “I’ve got half a mind to make it long,” he says, “just to piss Howard off.”
The sun’s gone down by the time they all leave the hospital, and now that Tony’s walking all by himself-- he’s so proud-- he can finally appreciate just how tall Steve is.
“Sure you do, Tweety bird,” he says, “now why don’t you get over here and help me string all this popcorn, huh?”
“Don’t feel like joining the gang?” he asks, and she shakes her head in response, little red curls swaying from side to side. She’s as pretty as a doll, and Tony feels a sudden, surprising rush of affection for her. “Feel like sticking around with me?”
“I’m a big boy now, Rhodey,” Tony says, feeling his face soften into a smile as he takes a deep, steadying breath. “I can take it.”
“I think I’m allowed a break. It’s not every day I wake up a married man, y’know,” Tony purrs, stressing the last two words with a sharp, quick nip at the skin behind Steve’s ear.
“I don’t mind,” Steve smiles, as soft as his eyes are fond. “And as long as you help with the dishes-- which you always do-- I’m more than happy to keep doing it.”
“I’m flattered you think so,” Steve chuckles around a grunt as he starts the slow climb up three floors. “But these arms can only hold somethin’ this big for so long.”
“Alright, pumpkin,” Tony pats his thighs. “Auntie Pep and Uncle Agent are gonna be here soon with Cat’s bed and all his toys, so you get to pick where you want him to sleep, yes?”
“I like the sound of that,” Steve groans, hips rocking up to meet the brunet’s slightly thrusting ones. “Seems like–
“To the kitchen,” Steve replies, jostling the brunet to get more giggles out of him. “Didn’t know Cap could fly.”
As soon as Tony spots Justin Hammer perched smugly at his desk, he knows it’s gonna be one of those days.
“No you’re not, Buck,” Steve shakes his head. Tony sees his eyes run over the brunet’s arm. “Is it dislocated? They need to set that right in, you know what Ma says--”
Because right off the bat, he hears Tony’s voice coming from the couch, and it only takes a moment for Clint to figure out who he’s talking on the phone with.
“Come on, Rogers,” he whispers, and he’s never begged more for anything in his life, but there’s no answering laughter, no light banter or warm encouragement.
His mom pulls him close, and cups his face. “Listen to me: no matter what you do, no matter what you say,” she says fiercely. Her eyes are blazing even as they burn with tears. “Anthony Edward Stark, I will always love you, do you hear me?”
shaking around his phone, no sir-- when a loud meow from outside has him running to the balcony. He leans over the railing, and
“I’m sorry,” Steve says softly, and almost steals the breath from Tony’s lungs when he reaches out to touch his arm. Even through the lab coat and the button up he’s wearing, Tony can still feel the warmth of his skin like a soothing brand.
The ride up to Steve’s floor feels longer than usual, and Tony spends every moment trying to quell down the surge of irrational panic.
Pepper only just manages to hide the giggle building up inside, and she’s sure the smile on her face must look positively ridiculous. “Oh, that’s—”
“Talk like you believe them,” Steve says quietly. “Like they have any right to say those things about you.”
Steve’s floor is silent when Tony steps off the elevator, and he feels unusually hesitant to disturb it. But when he finds his Captain sitting alone on the large sofa in the main room, he takes a breath to prepare himself.
“No fucking shame,” Barnes mutters as he leaves, and Clint and Sam are only a step behind, with the latter shooting Steve a wink before they’re out of sight.
“Me too,” he breathes, and can’t keep his eyes from running over Steve’s body in that uniform. “Rockin’ those tights, tiger.”
There’s something in his voice that’s pulling at Steve’s heart, because he suddenly sounds hesitant and worried, and Steve decides that he’s just going to go for it.
“You’re such a goner, Rogers,” is all she says, but as Steve starts setting up the camera for the next group, all he can think about is the feel of Tony’s lips on his cheek.
He’s expecting to be met with loud, excited ruckus, but instead, he enters the living room to find the rest of his pint-sized teammates crowded into the biggest sofa, staring transfixed at the movie playing before them. Clint, perched on the back of the couch, sees them first.
It’s slow and warm, and Tony’s lips taste like coffee and mint, a delicious combination that makes Steve lose track of how long the kiss lasts, but when finally Tony pulls away, they’re almost panting.
“Wuv you too, Papa,” their daughter echoes around a mouthful of her sugar cookie, and Steve’s smile-- all dimpled cheeks and clear, azure eyes-- sends Tony’s heart fluttering like the very first time.
“I’m glad he didn’t find me,” Steve replies. “Because Howard Stark might’ve helped make me, but that’s nothing compared to what his son’s done.”
Bright blue eyes stay fixed on the glass window. It’s almost like she’s looking through it, right at Tony. “
But Steve pulls away all too soon, and Tony has to stop himself from chasing those lips, because there are bigger things to deal with right now.
“Don’t be dramatic,” Steve says. “All you did was almost brain yourself on a glass table and bleed all over your carpet.”
“Okay, somewhere in my mind there’s a little voice saying ‘Steve’s right’,” Tony grumbles, “but right now, I’m really not seeing how.”
Tony doesn’t know he’s said anything until the arms that are around him again stiffen. “I can’t do this.”
,” Barton replies distractedly, brows furrowed as he looks down at his mostly purple colored paper. Around him, each of his teammates is engrossed in their own cards— Thor’s halfway to being entirely covered in silver glitter, very little of it actually making its way onto his piece of red construction paper.
“Oh my god,” Steve whispers, even as he sends Tony a hopeful little look that almost takes his breath away.
(And despite everything they've been through, despite everything they still go through everyday, being with Steve is the easiest thing Tony's ever done, so he thinks it fitting.)
“Quit with the mystery act,” she says. Tony feels a hand brush his arm, and then he turns to face the Captain and
Sam nods. “I can’t believe we’re doing this-- shit, okay, here we go,” he whispers excitedly, then clears his throat and leans in to the microphone. “
“Yes. It seems he made an impression of her from the first day. Master Tony’s taken to whining that she likes young James more than she likes him.”
“--but it’s true,” Steve ducks his head shyly as he fiddles with a corner of his sketchbook cover, then looks back up to meet Tony’s eyes again through those unfairly long eyelashes. “I get tongue-tied just lookin’ at ya sometimes.”
“Bring it on, hubby,” Tony whispers against Steve’s lips, but just as he’s leaning in the rest of the way, the elevator jerks to a stop, doors opening to the dark silence of their living room.
"I'd like that," Steve finally says, smiling like he thinks it's the best idea ever, and even with a black eye and a bruised shoulder, even sitting in a hospital waiting room at two in the morning, Tony thinks that's exactly what it might be.
They’re gathered on the couch in the middle of the afternoon– and it’s rare that they all get time off like this, so they take advantage of it, settling in to watch a movie– except Tony, because he has an interview and photoshoot with TIME, and Pepper, who’s going as his buffer even though
“I just… Carey from Legal just sent these over, and he told me to tell you to, well… that the department honchos would like you to speak with the boss.”
Steve gives him one last smile, and then sighs dejectedly. “I should probably let you get some rest...”
“You’d better,” Tony says “But until then,” he stands up, putting the last touches on Steve’s bandage. “Try to take it easy. Again. As pretty as your face is, I’d prefer not to find you in one of these rooms any time soon.”
“It means that you’re the best kind of best friends. That you’re close like family, even though you’re not related. You understand?” Steve asks, but going by the bright smile on his brother’s face, he didn’t need to.
“I just… I wanna give you everything. I want..” he looks up at the ceiling, chest heaving as he takes one deep breath, then another. “God, sometimes I look at you and I feel like I’m dreamin’, Tony. And I want everything for you.”
Tony shakes his head. “I’m good, peaches,” he smirks. “I’ll have a nasty bruise for a couple of days, but I got off good compared to your buddy. I was just... just keeping him company.”
“Bullshit, she gets all of it from you– the eyes, the smile, this ‘up before the sun’ schtick. All your fault, Rogers. Can’t say no to either one of you.”
“Jarvis,” Steve says, “your boyfriend? Or maybe he’s not, but it sounds like you really care about him.”
Pepper sees Tony take in a shaky breath, and then another, before he speaks up again. “You’re somethin’ else, Rogers.”
Tony rolls his eyes but nods, and then breathes around a pathetic, lovesick sigh as Steve leans over to brush a kiss on his forehead. “I’ll be back,” he hears the blond whisper.
“Funny guy,” Steve rolls his eyes, but moves a hand up to tip Tony’s chin until their eyes meet. He has time to catch the brunet’s smile before cupping the back of his head to bring him in for a kiss. It’s slow and soft and lazy, Steve’s favorite kind, and neither of them pull away until they’re gasping for air.
!” he whines, when Steve lets the pug down so he scamper around his new home. Clint wastes no time in scooping him up, laughing as Remy walks up and down his chest.
“Peachy,” he replies, quirking his lips into that charming grin that’s always made its many recipients weak at the knees.
“Get Pep here,” he says, reciting her phone number with perfect accuracy--he’s a genius, after all-- before the doors close behind him and he’s wheeled further into the hospital.
He looks around, but there’s so much chatter around him that he can’t locate it. He’s about to scream at the whole fucking shop to just
He’s surprised that had been his only reaction, because seeing his name tattooed in binary code on his best friend’s chest was something he’d never even dreamed he’d ever see. But even now, years later, it still sends a wave of warmth rushing through Tony’s body.
Steve crosses his arms over his chest, and for once, Tony isn’t bothered by the exasperated look on his boyfriend’s face because really, he’ll take anything over having to look at the travesty Steve’s wearing. “It’s better than yours,” Steve gestures at Tony’s glaringly red sweater, at the black letters wishing a ‘
It had taken a single glance at Bucky and half a minute later, they’d stepped outside, and the fresh air along with splitting log after log in half was doing wonders to his mind.
“Oh, I’m pretty sure you’ll recognize him!” Natasha called over and cast him a smug smile before she walked through the door.
Steve smiled, and after a bit of contemplation, he placed a hand on Tony’s head, his fingers brushing through the dark hair. “Sounds like a great thought.”
“With the right handling, the Oufros Alder can be quite helpful,” Thor said with an indulgent smile, but he reached into the chest and handed Clint a vial anyway. “Drink it all at once, the effect should be immediate.”
Steve took several shuddering breaths as he fell back down on the mattress, taking Tony with him. For several minutes, they were just lying there. Tony was wheezing for air, burying his face into Steve’s neck as he tried to regain composure.
And yet, hearing everyone relay their memories of that night… it was as if it truly came alive. A tightening manifested itself in Steve’s chest, his mind replaying a scene he’d tried so hard not to think about. He saw himself standing in the boathouse. Tony was with him, but his empty eyes were pointed downwards, a woman’s body lying at his feet, blood pooling around her head.
“Yes,” Natasha said. Then she leaned in close and brushed her warm lips against his own. And for the first time in decades, he felt something like peace washing over him. He never thought it possible. It felt like Natasha had been with him for years. That generations had passed since the time he thought of her as his adversary.
“There are twelve reports from different victims who were attacked by the same shooter,” Coulson said with a clipped tone. “
Right in front of them, Thanos’ lifeless body lay on the floor, the fluorescent lights of the Infinity Stones blazing down on him, exposing his grotesque alien features.
He cleaned himself up as best as he could, pleased that he had somehow managed to not leave any telltale stains on his pants. In the end, he still looked like a guy who’d gotten laid real good, but at least he didn’t seem in need of lifesaving measures anymore.
“Yeah, we got it, but…” Steve frowned, when something else occurred to him. “You said you worked on getting JARVIS back online. How? I thought he was…”
And then, without ceremony, he walked out of the room, pointedly forcing himself not to come across too hurried.
"I'm alright, but I think you should ask Mr. Stane there," he said, gesturing towards the stirring man on the couch. All hell would definitely break loose any minute now.
Natasha smiled that quiet smile of hers. It didn’t seem to be quite as false this time around. “You’d be surprised.”
"No—" Steve hurried to answer, then, hesitating, he lowered his gaze to the desk in front of him. "I'll go there myself."
“It was my only chance to get through to him,” Steve told him. “I knew he was still in there. I saw it in his eyes, Tony, I couldn’t just leave him there…”
“Come on, Tony,” Carol supplied while putting her head on Tony’s shoulder, pouting at him with big eyes. “My mom and I drove by that place like hundreds of times. I always wanted to know what the heck this even is.”
Tony supposed this was interesting to anyone who entertained the idea of ghosts. However, he spent the most of the hour-long-tour rolling his eyes and scowling at Steve for bringing him here in the first place.
Steve nodded, stroking the wedding ring on Tony’s finger. He didn’t have to ask to know it was vibranium. It was exactly the kind of ring he would’ve chosen to give to Tony.
When Tony nodded, Steve grabbed for his hand and basically dragged him out of the room. A startled laugh left Tony’s mouth as he followed him up the stairs. Of course, he’d seen all of their rooms soon after they’d moved the team’s headquarters here, but Steve hadn’t really lived here, back then, and Tony had to admit he was sort of curious.
Tony snorted against Steve’s chest, pulling him firmly towards their bedroom. “On the upcoming sex or the marriage?”
There was so much in his life that didn’t belong to him. The war, the horrible deaths he’d had to encounter every day. Even the Captain America persona.
learn from the best,” he commented, and the words had Tony stop in his tracks. He glanced up at Vision, and while his expression was both apathetic and full of… this weird sort of worldly wisdom… there was also something he had never seen before.
How Tony hadn’t made the connection the second he’d laid eyes on the man’s face was beyond him now. Those
Tony came to stand in front of Steve’s room. For a weird moment, he didn’t know if he should knock, but figured Steve wouldn’t answer him either way, so he just pushed the door open and walked in.
The question was getting unspeakably redundant, especially after their two years of marriage, but Steve figured the reassurance was needed when coming from his long lost best friend. He knew he would be doing the same if the tables were turned. “With everything I have,” he replied and cocked his head curiously. “You don’t really have a problem with that, do you?”
Tony's solid weight on his thighs, his clean scent and warmth, his strong hands… Steve’s eyes followed those fingers, trying to imagine what it would feel like to have them inside. He didn't even dare glance at Tony's dick, for fear it would render him too nervous to continue.
“Really?” Tony asked and the insecurity Steve saw buried in his brown eyes was definitely something new.
The man shrugged off Steve’s hand, which he had positioned on his shoulder. “Me? He’s the one you should be dragging away!” he snarled at Steve angrily before staring Tony down once more. “
Steve remembered all those nights when he and Tony had been too involved in each other to even notice that the outside world existed. When Steve’s arms had been perpetually locked around Tony’s body and their lips had been glued to each other’s… when it would have taken an apocalypse or worse to drive them apart. And despite it all, he longed for that.
. Something clicked then. A year ago, Ultron had still weighed heavily on their mind. The battle of Sokovia had still been raging all over the news channel, and they had flown over to East-Europe almost every other week to help with rebuilding.
Tony was stunned stupid for a long moment, unsure of anything until hearing Steve’s moan around his tongue. And then all was left to instinct. Tony hugged him close, grinding his palpable erection into his center with all the fervor Steve was still a little hesitant to express.
“You can fight me all night long,” he said lowly and his mouth was on the back of her neck, “or we can move this back to the bed. So what’s it gonna be?”
Steve sighed, rolling his shoulders back, as he rattled off, “I’ll make my way North the same way as usual, crossing under the river using the old sewer tunnel. From the exit at Curtis Memorial, it’s a five-minute walk up to the outer elevators. Two if I run. There’s a lift on the west side of the south carrier I can use without setting off the alarms. It’s also far enough away from the main gate to avoid the guards. Then it’s three minutes across the upper level. As soon as I’m up, you and JARVIS will have my back.”
Even after Ultron, even after they’d barely been able to hold themselves on their feet, Tony had seen Steve folding his uniform neatly, handing it over to Tony for a complete overhaul.
Tony smiled, pushing his damp hair back from his face. He leaned in to take a closer look at the hints of lines forming around his eyes and mouth. He touched a finger to the delicate skin under his eye.
Tony rolled his eyes. He set a target on Sam and followed. “You know,” Tony said conversationally, spiraling in place and landing a kick in the man’s side that sent him flying back to the ground. He caught Peter in his arms and waited till he had swung himself back into the fight. “I don’t understand why you couldn’t just stay out of this. I didn’t go out of my way to piss you off. We—”
, Tony thought, then closed his eyes and slumped against Steve, their mouths touching. This was… new. This time, Steve wasn’t shocked and rigid or drunk and clumsy. This time, Steve
. There are descriptions of a man with a metal arm, and even identikit pictures that aren’t far off the mark. You told me no one identified him. You said it was safe to bring him here—”
“It won’t be long,” she said. She reached for his hand, squeezing it softly. “After this, the future’s just waiting for you.”
He pulled back just as quickly, though, and shoved Tony’s glasses back on his nose. “Now, you watch.”
Tony’s hands clutched at Steve’s shoulders as he rode out the waves for what felt like hours. He groaned and felt Steve flex beneath him, hooking both arms around Tony’s waist. He dropped him down on the mattress and leaned up on his knees. He held both of Tony’s ankles in his hand and continued to thrust into him with single-minded intent. And when, only moments later, Steve cried out in response, filling him up so good and slumping down the next moment, all Tony could do was kiss his forehead and take his weight.
Steve smiled against the crown of Tony’s dark hair. “Thanks, bud. Redirect all calls till tomorrow, please?”
Tony startled a little—he always zoned out when his mind was racing—, but once he’d noticed Steve approaching, he smiled at him. “Work,” he said as he leaned back, waving a hand at the circular schematic.
Tony nodded. “Thanks, but I’d actually hoped to talk to him later. And I kinda repaired his arm, so…” He shrugged, clearly trying for nonchalance.
reputation had been all over the place and Tony himself hadn’t held back with talking about his many his conquests. But only once Tony had stopped propositioning Steve at every waking hour, when they’d
He had a feeling, though, that no one would believe him. They’d barely talked before, had barely managed at look at one another, and for the others, it had only been three days.
It had only been days—a few short days—since they had been together like this. And yet so much had happened. Things had changed. Steve’s mouth worshipped Tony’s throat with reverent, desperate kisses, and he was pushing into him with deep, arresting strokes.
Steve hummed with the affectionate treatments. He was already teetering on the edge of sleep when Tony kissed him, parting his lips and making a small sound into Tony's mouth. He rubbed his knuckles along Tony's back towards his neck and then forced his eyes open when Tony spoke.
The silence stretched on and Steve was starting to wonder if maybe it was actually a bad idea to say this right now, even though it was the truth, and the first thing that had come to mind, but before he could really question himself, Tony moved. Tony moved and was
He had always thought the medical area of Stark Tower to be unnecessarily large, compiled righteously with the stereotypical endless hallways and spacious rooms that were more barren than filled, but now, he was secretly glad that there was enough space to retreat to from all the madness that was Bucky Barnes’ recovery.
Steve shook his head, dazed and a bit out of his comfort zone in a way he found oddly pleasant. Tony was taking the lead this time. It wasn't only a new experience with him, but something he'd never expected to try. Tony's eyes all but ate him up, and Steve felt his excitement overtaking the nervousness.
He and his Steve—they’d never had the chance to just be friends, without all that baggage. After Ultron, they’d still talked, sure, but it hadn’t been the same as before.
There was a slight… flush… forming on Tony’s skin. He tried to avert his gaze without outward turning around, but then he seemed to decide to stand his ground instead.
He couldn’t say anything, couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything but stare. He was stunned speechless, staring straight ahead and wrinkling his forehead as he tried to figure out what to say to that. What to
Since he was officially introduced as Tony’s new business partner, a torrent of men and women wanted to talk to him about Stark Industries. Unfortunately for Steve, he had no way of refusing their conversations and therefore, he had little choice but to spend much of the evening with horrible people with horrible questions that made Justin Hammer seem like a really swell guy.
Pepper clung to him for a moment, then pulled away. He could hear her taking a deep breath, visibly pulling herself together. “Yes, he is. Where is the doctor?”
“I can see why people would want to be with you,” he said, forcing the words out of his lips before he could think too much about it.
So he took a last deep breath and slowly walked towards the entrance hall. The first thing he heard was Pepper’s confident voice, accompanied by Happy, who said something that made everyone around him laugh. Then, Steve rounded the corner and appeared at the top of the stairs.
“He wanted to salvage,” Steve continued. “I told him everything had to go. No deceits, and no middle grounds anymore.”
Steve huffed, flashing a little smile, before Tony felt the welcoming pressure of his hand on his lower back. “I’m sure they were.”
When the glass door opened, Obi merely glanced up at them; He nodded and held up a hand to signify his need to end the call. Tony nodded in turn, and steered Steve in the direction of the worktable.
The next thing Bucky knew, Tony buried his face in Steve’s chest. “I really wanted to do this for you.” Tony pulled back reluctantly, shaking his head. “But I guess that was stupid. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“I can’t! I…” He pulled away from her and, with one hand, picked his tablet off the table. “Yesterday, I was trying to make a simple grocery list for him, but all I could do was stare at this blank document. I kept thinking about what I’d need to make meals, only I realized I don’t know how to make the things Ian likes without a recipe, and Steve never left any. He had them all in his head, and I never asked because I thought I wouldn’t
When no answer came, the cold seeped through the glass and into Tony’s bones. He flexed his back as best as he could with the bandages holding it in position. It still hurt, his insides were still tender, but he knew, if it came down to it, he’d step into the suit and damn it all to hell if only it meant that Steve would return home safely.
If he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine the covers, the whole air, slowly started to smell like the both of them together.
It was then that he noticed a shadow in the doorway. Tony stopped the tune, and looked over his shoulder, and even though he knew, he still wasn’t prepared for the sight in front of him.
Steve swallowed. “And what’s your alternative?” he asked. “You saw what happened with Ultron, you’re not supposed to play God. There’s no way to tell what trying again would do. It could end the world early.”
Tony’s grin dimmed at that. He raised himself to his elbows, looking down at Steve, and his wings once more cocooned them in their softness. “Forever,” he whispered and Steve felt his heart skip a beat as he nodded.
“You remember our wedding dance?” Steve asked. “Looking back, it should have been terribly awkward. Never had the time to practice. I think I had about two lessons.”
Steve couldn’t help it; he had to smile at the disgruntled look on Tony’s face. “So did I,” he admitted, then added, “about settling in, I mean.” His gaze fell on the duffle bag, and he took a deep breath. “Look, Tony, I… I didn’t want to leave just like that. Not after everything. Wanted to say goodbye at least.”
Steve heaved a heavy breath, leaning his head back against the wall and staring up to the ceiling. “You know… the first thing out of my mouth when I met Buck was a lie,” he said after a moment, and smiled at the puzzled expression on Natasha’s face.
Either way, the lack of communication could only mean that SHIELD had been compromised. Steve was right, there were simply too many loose ends.
He noticed how Steve kept glancing back to the suit, and smiled to himself. One of the legs was still missing and the chest plate wasn’t snapped into place yet, but otherwise, Mark forty-three was mostly finished. And he knew it looked impressive. It was, by far, the most powerful thing he’d come up with, and the first with a built-in arc reactor, just in case.
When Steve looked for Tony again, he saw him standing at the sidelines. His gaze was still off in the distance somewhere and his face was like a careful constructed mask of stone.
Now it was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes, and Steve had trouble believing his own when he saw him blushing ever so slightly.
He waved a hand at where he hoped Steve’s face was, then set into motion. “Gotta go. Miracles to drink, coffees to invent… Have fun working out or painting or whatever it is you’re doing, Adonis.”
There was heat pouring into Steve’s lower regions, a yearning in his abdomen, and it was then that Steve realized: This was the reason why walking in on Tony had completely thrown him. He’d seen him writhing on his sheets; the right side of his body obscured in shadows, while the left was bathed in sunlight. At first, Steve had had no idea what to make of what he saw. For the first time since he’d seen a girl naked, he’d looked at the naked body in front of him and drawn a long, undeniable blank.
This was all laughably stupid. Why couldn’t they simply let Bucky grieve, give him a moment of peace for once, as well?
Tony looked over his shoulder at the two men trailing after him, and offered a dry snort. “Yeah, Steve, why didn’t you tell him?”
“I’m sorry.” He looked to the hole in the wall next to him. “We need to repay Sam for the damage,” he murmured guiltily.
“Tony,” Steve prompted, sitting down on his side of the bed. He reached for Tony’s shoulder, rubbing the skin there. A hand settled on top of his, and Tony pulled gently to press a kiss into Steve’s palm.
Steve wasted no time and once more sealed the space between them, seizing Tony’s wrists with one hand, and pressing down against him. His other hand pried open Tony’s fly, and the next thing Tony knew, his cock leapt into Steve’s big, warm hand. A long, decidedly high-pitched moan tore from Tony’s lips and his head flew back against the couch cushion. While Steve’s right hand tightened around him, the other fought to shove his black dress pants down.
“He’s doing alright,” Steve answered. “As much as we all are.” He sighed, gently brushing his nose along Ian’s hair, inhaling his scent. God, he’d missed him, in a way he couldn’t have fathomed a year ago. “You don’t have to see him, you know,” he told Tony.
But so far, Tony had been nothing short of perfect. He’d shown Steve the world—or at least more of it than Steve had ever expected to see. He’d told him stories about each landmark they’d come across, or simply sat next to Steve while he tried to capture it on paper.
It was a few hours later, probably no more than three, when Tony suddenly jolted awake on a few mumbled, panicked words. It was still dark, the wind still howling through the trees. From the few sounds leaving Tony’s lips, Steve only made out ‘don’t’ and ‘please’ and he cast Tony a worrying look once his brown eyes found his. It obviously took a moment for Tony to realize where he was and why he was sleeping out in the open.
The last voice—Steve’s voice—sounded shaken. And for a moment, Tony couldn’t remember where he was, but the knowledge gradually came along with the astonishing wave of loss. He kept his eyes closed, unable to process what had happened yet. He felt thrown back into a moment in time before Aldrich Killian had killed him by crushing the arc reactor on the Lemurian Star.
Tony bit his lower lip as he stared up at Steve. “You really have changed,” he observed, and after another long beat, he nodded.
He took the 87 to Albany, not really knowing where to go, or what to do when he got there. He had booked a place for the next few days, but apart from that, he’d just see where the road would take him. It was sunny outside, an early summer day, and a gentle wind blew past him as he sped up. The last time he’d done this had been right after the Chitauri attack. He’d felt unfathomably lost then, and he could very well admit that it was the same now, around six years later.
He showered quickly, rinsing himself in all the military-efficiency Tony still found so amusing. After getting dressed in sweats and a shirt, Steve walked back over to their bedroom, peering inside and smiling to himself when he heard the little gushing sounds coming from the cradle.
The two had similarly rebellious expressions on their faces as the others trooped up the stairs. Even Hulk was giving him a grateful look.
A smile at that, and a hum in agreement. “Part of it, yeah.” He closed his eyes, revelling in Steve holding him near and pressing soft kisses into his skin. He loved this, having his lungs filled with Steve’s essence, and his warmth against his body.
“Mmm,” Steve hummed, and did as Tony asked. Soon after and with a soft cry and a final tensing of his internal muscles, Tony came so hard that he brought on Steve’s own orgasm before he knew what was happening.
He did manage to lean into the kiss Steve pressed against his cheek, though, and cast him a lazy smile.
“I haven’t exactly…” Steve exhaled a long breath. “Just tell me. Please. Why are you so angry with me?” It was barely a whisper.
Afterwards, they’d walked around a few blocks, making a small detour into Central Park where they got a cone of ice cream each, before eventually heading back to the car.
Tony took a breath, trying to sort through the haze in his mind. There had been something he’d wanted to ask her, right? Something about Natasha and…
He grabbed Bucky’s shoulders and pulled with all of his strength. Bucky whirled around and tried to hit him
Tony was more than aware that it could all end when the blanket of night no longer covered them. There was no reason to hope this morning would hold any solutions to their situation.
His arms weren’t pinned. He could have Tony back on his feet in a blink. He could give him a stern lecture within an inch of his arrogant ass.
Tony inhaled deeply through his nose as Steve shoved all the way inside. Goddammit, he was losing his mind right then and there. He felt breathless and needy, and in that moment, not a single rational thought was running through his head. There was just the raw feeling of Steve pressing inside, and nothing else.
She exhaled a long breath, and leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees. “He was my mentor. He was… everyone’s mentor. At least to those who’d made it that far. He trained us—me, and the other girls—in combat training, mostly. He…” She took a deep breath. “He used to try to break us.”
The irony wasn’t lost on Tony. That—to make sure that the Avengers were a united force once Thanos descended upon earth—he apparently had to die.
because of Steve, at least. “This was… bigger. Was a matter of priorities. And what is this, anyway? Are you giving me advice on my marriage now?”
Gently, Steve pressed him down on their bed. Their kiss was fervent, passion-filled, and Tony used it to communicate all that he was feeling at that moment: hunger, need, joy at both of them being alive. And, more than anything else: love.
“Don’t jinx it,” Tony said. He reached for his other phone—the one that wasn’t embarrassingly outdated. “I’ll let you clean up in peace. Gotta make a call.”
There was a sizzling noise, and suddenly, the night sky was exploding with light. The different colors burst in the air  and each was a giant star that was spreading its spikes, before it ripped apart and showered the ground with its sparks.
"Breathe, Tony. It's just you and me here. You can ask for anything you need," he said slowly, smiling slightly. "Can't promise I'll go through with it, but if you don't ask, we won't know." He kissed Tony's cheek, pressing their bodies firmly together. His face felt flushed, so hot he could feel it throbbing.
Should he ask? He probably shouldn't. It wasn't his business, and neither of them needed things to get messy.
Tony’s mouth drew into a tight line, confirming Steve’s suspicions. “I can manage, just go back inside.”
“Of Steve? Sure. I never got courted by an alien plant from outer space.” He looked at Steve, grinning brightly. “That something you’d recommend?”
Steve paused, and moved to close the door. When he turned around again, Tony’s shoulder were set in a tensed line, like a cat caught in a cage.
“Yeah, I… I caught you staring at guys sometimes, I don’t know. Mostly at…” His eyes darted to Steve for all of a second, before snapping back to Tony. “Uh, never mind, well… since you never said anything and started going out with girls, I began to think I had gotten it wrong.”
Natasha tilted her head in worried regard, before she kneeled down and cupped Tony’s cheek. “You all right, Shellhead?”
“I know baby, I know.” Desperate, Tony started to pace. Over the distressed sounds, Tony started singing the first thing he could think of:
. What if this thing drags me to another past life? I can’t go through that again." He swore, letting himself meet Tony's gaze. "It's so vivid… How worried I was when I… when Stephanus…"
“Some people are better at keeping secrets than others,” Steve murmured as he followed Clint’s path through the high grass, the others trailing close behind. Bucky was cradling Natasha in his arms, her eyes distant, her stance hunched, and Steve could only guess what horrors the Maximoff girl had shown her. Thor seemed to be more troubled than shaken, and as for Bruce… there was something still slightly feral in his gaze, something that hadn’t been there for a whole long while.
Steve rolls his eyes even as he laughs, making his way back to Tony’s side, and if Tony notices they’re just a little bit closer this time, he’s definitely not complaining.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to shrug. “I’m itchin’ to get back to you. Shouldn’t be more than a week ‘till we’re cleared.”
“Starving. But first...” Tony leans in and captures Steve’s lips in a kiss-- slow and deep like he’s been aching to ever since he left for SI in the morning-- sighing happily as Steve returns it with soft, tender swipes of his own. “I love you,” he whispers, after they both pull away for air.
“One of the guys in his crew was just brought in– got hit by a beam on his way out of a building, and he got a pretty nasty gash on the head. Almost got concussed.”
“St-Steve!” he yells, whipping his head to find his best friend, only to whimper when the world starts turning dangerously.
It’s slow and whisper-soft, and so tender, Tony feels chills running down his arms. He feels Steve’s hand cup his cheek, closes his eyes against the lurch his heart gives, and knows he’s never been happier than he is at this moment.
“You’ll be fine, Tony,” the blond smiles, brushing Tony’s fingers with his own. “I’ll see you when you come back out.”
Steve stared at the letter for a long moment, sorting out his thoughts. He'd never gotten a goodbye letter before, and the sense of finality to it was both terrible and unbelievable.
Simultaneously, they all jumped out of the car. And then, another van spun towards them and Natasha charged into Steve and Tony, making them both fall down on the street. A second later, there were several shots, missing them by mere inches. Tony watched from the ground as the van collided with their SUV, falling on top of it. After a few moments passed, they all stood up.
At least, that’s what Jarvis had always told him. It’s a bedtime story Tony had often lulled himself to sleep to whenever his parents had been fighting downstairs. And it’s what Tony had passed on to Rhodey when they had met in elementary school. Rhodey was two years older than Tony, and yet, they’d been best friends the moment they’d built their first Lego fort together. Soon after, they had been promising to each other with their pinky-fingers crossed that when they were older—come heaven or hell—they’d watch one of those ‘magical eclipses’ together.
This was… amazing. He took a few steps closer to the mess that was Tony's working area to get a better look at the machine.
At that, Steve cocked a brow and after a moment’s consideration, he leaned back, giving the mentioned area a long, thoughtful glance before nodding his consent. “True.”
Steve followed the other with mirth as they pushed each and every button available, bickering over which attraction was the worst. For the first half hour or so, Tony had adamantly tried to keep up his I-don’t-want-to-be-here-with-you-attitude until he finally cracked. With every half-cooked comment Bucky was throwing out about locomotives, Tony’s expression had darkened further. Eventually, it seemed he couldn’t take it anymore. He donned his on-ears (obviously, there hadn’t been any music playing, anyway) and took the lead, blabbering on and on about rail transport systems, heating, boilers and steam circuits and the general origins of steam locomotives.
He let the words linger in the air, smiling at Steve. Once he’d walked to the other side of the room, Stane opened the armoire and cautiously reached for a black satin dress. “This for example… it was a gift from Tony. He always bought her the most expensive things, you know? Not just for their anniversaries, the whole year around.”
“That’s a joke, right?” Tony asked, his body tight with tension. “We’re back here again? Do you remember last night?”
He took a deep breath, schooling his expression as he cleared his throat. “Well," he said. “That’s a… surprise.”
Tony’s mouth tugged into a tender smile and he nodded, wrapping an arm around Steve’s middle and drawing him near so he could kiss his shoulder. Ever since meeting Steve, his heart had been systematically sewn back together, piece by piece, and for the first time in weeks Tony felt the future was in his own hands again.
Steve chuckled at that, and Tony smiled as he slowly opened the lid. He cast him a meaningful glance before he slicked two of his fingers, pressing the box back into Steve’s hand. His head rolled back against the wall, his shoulders giving him leverage while moved his hips forward so he could let his own hand trail towards his opening.
Tony wasn't telling the whole truth. Steve was sure of that. He wanted to ask—was going to, actually—when the arm moved again, drawing his attention.
Tony had planned to ask Steve for a while now, but only now, he realized how much he’d wanted him to say yes.
Tony pressed his eyes closed, shaking his head to get rid of the memory of Steve lying on the ground, his body bloody and broken. Of the world falling apart around them.
"Join us upstairs?" he practically blurted out. "I need to go back, but… the meeting shouldn't be long now.”
Steve sighed, rubbing his forehead. And here he was, moping about a little bit of extra attention from a kid at school.
Carefully, Steve picked up the infant and pressed it against his chest. Every time he did this, he still had a moment of potent fear of how easily he could hurt this fragile human being, but he knew now that some things just needed time.
It would take a long time for Tony to wrap his head around that, but… no matter what would happen from here on out… there had been a version of Steve who’d once had said ‘yes’ to him.
. "I shouldn't be encouraging you… getting your hopes up." He scratched at the side of his head. Proper words weren't forthcoming. "Kissing you, sharing a bed with you… I need to keep my distance so we can both carry on with our lives—"
“Back up a little,” Steve warned them. “He needs a little breathing space. Just give him a minute, will you? We haven’t been around other people for a while.”
“Ian was down on the floor, playing with his plushie,” Natasha said, standing up and pointing towards one of the many soft nursery rugs. “James punched me and Ian started crying when I cried out in surprise, that’s all. James wasn’t even close to him.”
Tony arched a brow. “He almost killed the both of us within half a day, I think I’m allowed to call him whatever I want.”
Breathing was becoming a problem, and while he knew it wasn’t the suit that caused the pressure on his lungs right now, he still needed to get out of it. Right now.
Steve nodded. “You can’t trust him. A few days ago, I listened to him talking to some visitor about you, and about me. I didn’t understand what it was about exactly, but it sounded like a threat to you.”
They were dancing. Slow and meaningful among a hundred faces Steve couldn’t care less about in this moment. They were dancing. He held Tony close and couldn’t take a breath without inhaling his scent. Couldn’t move but for the feel of him. Dancing was something he’d never gotten to do. A representation of something he had always admired but never knew how it would feel. It could mean so many things in one glorious step. They danced well together. Even in this, Tony was his equal. There was no one who came before him, and no one who could ever take his place.
A breath left Steve’s lips. “Let go!” he shouted, and even from the growing distance, he saw Bucky struggling. Ultron was holding his metal arm in a firm grip, though, probably more interested in taking Bucky with him than shaking him off.
Tony smiled. “Always.” With a soft caress at Steve’s neck, he opened the door of the shower stall and stepped out.
(Side note: Yes, I took the name Ian from the 616 verse, with complete 100% disregard to 616!Ian Rogers’ history. I simply liked the name and the fact that Steve once loved a son and named him Ian.)
Huffing a breath, Steve tilted his head, touching his temple to Tony's. It was reassuring. "He crossed a line with 'whoring', Tony." Still, minutes after the fact, the phrase circled in his head like a chicken looking for something to peck. Yes, Steve's temper had been tipped by the pedophile comment, but it was the fact that he dared suggest Tony was a whore that really got Steve in that punching mood.
Tony huffed. It was such a Steve-thing to do. He gave a shit about people’s opinion when it came to them, and Tony loved him fiercely for it. Tipping the glass, he finished off the soda and put it back down on the bar counter. Steve pressed a small kiss on his hand’s knuckles, then led him to the dance-floor.
Steve’s mind was spinning. Why would Obadiah have locked the door? He glanced at Tony, looking for some sign that he knew what all of this meant, but all he could see was confusion.
Tony regarded Steve more carefully, and it was then, that he noticed it. Steve did something weird with his left hand—he was nervously twirling a ring on his fourth finger, rotating it slowly with his thumb over and over again.
“Plans?” Tony asked, and his face relaxed into a real smile. Steve was still looking at him with those ridiculously blue eyes, and there was something in that expression, something sweet and wonderful, that made Tony feel strangely warm.
Bucky’s eyes flashed in response. He rushed forward, this time grabbing the guy with his metal arm. The man, however, pushed him off with the ease of a man throwing a football. As Bucky reeled backward into the computer console in the middle of the room, Steve struck out with one leg, sideswiping the man on the right side of his head.
“They’ll want to put a leash on us again,” Tony explained, and glanced at Steve. “You’ll hate it, you might not see that now, but—”
“Sounds lovely,” Tony said. He leaned back against the window front and stared at Steve from afar. “You alright?”
“I got a private jet taking off,” Natasha called through the comm-line, “across town, no manifest. That could be him.”
Tony nodded, relishing Steve’s touch for a moment longer, before bracing himself. “Alright. Here goes nothing,” he said and took a step towards the door. It opened automatically, and of course, all eyes settled on them immediately.
“In the meantime,” Steve continued, “we will stay here. We will train as usual, and Tony said he can arrange a few rare visits between our teams, and he can bring you to your family and vice versa.” Steve looked at both Clint and Scott.
Bucky was still a bit wobbly as he took his first step. Together, they walked to the stairway. It was at that moment that a loud sound filled the house, like a generator powering down. The overhead lights flickered rapidly, and then it was suddenly pitch black. A booming, crashing noise sounded from somewhere outside.
“He doing well?” Tony asked, his voice pointedly neutral, as he walked around the kitchen counter. Next to him, right on the floor, stood about three huge boxes full of food, as well as a container with a whole turkey.
“No,” Steve admitted, then hesitated just a second. “Um, I was Justin Hammer’s assistant for a while, so I was familiar with his weapon’s designs and his daily affairs.”
Tony blinked himself out of his stupor, his eyes widening ever so briefly. A mixture of regret and self-hatred flashed across his face. “Of course I did,” he breathed. “You knew that, didn’t you?”
“I want that,” he said, clearing his throat. “Both of it. The team is… I missed fighting the good fight. Every time I heard you guys stepped out, I was pretty much insufferable.” He took a deep breath, pressing his lips close to Steve’s head and kissing his earlobe. And
was, Steve was infinitely glad that Bucky seemed to be so relaxed, these days. Despite Tony’s and Phil’s combined efforts, Bucky’s trial didn’t seem to be coming to any conclusion. With the founding of the ATCU and other task forces trying to control each and every enhanced individuals out there, there were new witnesses called into court almost every week. People like Thaddeus Ross and Glenn Talbot were clearly supporting a conviction, and they seemed to want to make an example of Bucky. Therefore, his house detention wouldn’t be revoked any time soon.
Together, they walked over into their living room and sat down at the kitchen island. While Tony bounced a happy and all too-awake Ian on his knees, Steve stared balefully at a sink full of dirty dishes.
Anyway. No more stalling. Tony fortified himself and opened the door. As soon as he took a step in, he heard the computer system announce his presence.
Bucky chose that instant to wrap his arm around her. "Textbook romance," he agreed. “And soon to be wed, however the hell that happened.”
And now, Barnes just looked incredibly small—even diminished, somehow. There were the new, more colorful scars and bruises, but there were also... Hundreds of older ones. Scratch wounds, burns, cuts, gunshot wounds... Barnes' body was a canvas of the life he'd been forced to live, and the sight wasn't pretty.
to keep himself from rutting against Tony’s leg, but deliberate or not, ever so often Tony’s leg would push upwards, pressing against him, teasing him to just give in.
Steve watched him for a few moments longer, lingering in the knowledge that they had this now—the two of them, together.
Steve sighed. "I will put you in bed, but I'm not undressing you," he said, looking away from Tony's face as he entered the building. "Even if you weren't…" he cleared his throat. Maybe mentioning Tony's age wouldn't be the best idea right now. "You're drunk off your ass."
Walking into the facility felt surreal. After witnessing those horrors, they now stepped out of the Quinjet and everything seemed as if nothing had happened. The walls were the same, the furniture was the same, it smelled the same, felt the same, and when Steve heard his team talking in the distance, his eyes watered.
Before Indries, Tony had someone new in his bed twice a week,” Stane snapped. “Trust me, he’ll get bored of him soon. And then we can continue as planned.”
Anyway. The rest of the team had taken him coming from another time completely in stride. Bucky and Natasha had cancelled their weekend plans, and the other members of the Avengers had been informed as well, so only a few hours later, Bruce, Sam and Clint had joined them at the Compound.
Steve almost broke the pencil in half. He didn’t say anything; just stared at Bucky with wide unblinking eyes. “How,” he asked after a moment. Putting the pencil down on the paper.
“Steve,” came another tentative whisper. When Steve didn’t answer, Tony eventually moved forward and opened the zipper of the tent’s hatch.
Bruce shook his head with a deep breath. “Not knowing is worse, trust me. Not knowing what you did, whom you might have hurt… that’s always worse.”
Tony certainly had never been an advocate of silence; especially when there was an alternative at the ready. For once, though, someone beat him to it.
“I’m not so easy to get rid of,” Bucky said as he tried to sit up. He had a bit of a hard time, what with the way he only had one arm at the moment, and he grunted with annoyance as he heaved himself into a vertical position.
With a steady hand, Natasha pulled him towards the door, and they both came to a stop in front of it.
Tony heard the crackling of thunder before he saw it, but either way, the next thing he knew, Mjolnir hit the robot with full force and sent it to the ground. Its various parts shattered, and only the helmet’s lights flickered for a moment longer, before it went out for good.
“Wouldn’t have been my first call,” the robot admitted. “But, down in the real world, we’re faced with ugly choices.”
“What if something happens to you?” Tony asked, irritated. “What if you die? Our Steve won’t ever be able to get back here.”
And then he felt the soft touch of Steve’s lips whispering against his throat, his nails ever-so-gently etching a path along Tony’s erection. Steve wasn’t coy. He didn’t tease. His fingers simply wrapped around Tony’s length with a firm grasp that set his body aflame.
Bucky had a sinking feeling he knew where this was going. And he wasn’t sure how to feel about it. He could see it in Tony’s eyes—the hope to move on from what happened, but Bucky also knew he didn’t deserve it. He needed to make amends. He needed to earn his friendship, rather than have Tony tell him the past was forgiven. There were miles to go before his debt was repaid.
, Tony thought—that explained things. Most things. Not the shirt, though. “You could’ve just asked Friday,” he suggested.
Air fought to fill Steve’s lungs and every word that came to mind choked in his throat. He couldn’t think straight, not with Stane’s black eyes boring into his.
The gym wasn't helping. Painting wasn't helping. Even jogging didn't get him tired enough to forget about the visions. They were just so surreal…
Staying in Avengers Tower, every morning waking up in Tasha’s bed, her body curled around him. Tangled limbs and soft red hair, one hand lying splayed across the silken expanse of her naked back. Listening to the sound of her breathing, the throb of her heartbeat. Of course he didn’t deserve it.
Tony stared up at him, surprised when a choked sob crossed his lips. Steve had always had the power to drag out of him what Tony so desperately tried to suppress. Things buried so deep he hadn’t even realized they were plaguing him until Steve came and made it better. In seconds, he had exposed the most barren scrapings of his heart with no more than his assurance. His assurance that warmed Tony in ways that he could never fully comprehend.
Tony frowned as he looked down at himself. He felt all kinds of not presentable right now, and if Steve thought that him not showing up would raise more questions than him showing up like
Tony grabbed his wrist, but there was no real strength in his grip. “I think it was meant to be this way,” he said, and he almost couldn’t believe his own words. Never in his life had he believed in fate. He’d always been sure, one-hundred percent, that he was the maker of his own choices. But this… this felt a lot like destiny. “I think it’s the only way to make sure Earth will survive.”
, and Steve—with a huge smile on his lips—took one step back when he was sure Ian would manage those few more inches as well. There, he slouched down, squatting on the floor with a broad grin, and took Ian’s stretched arms in his hands when he’d reached him.
“That’s right,” Tony groaned. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, pressed his forehead to his and took him all the way in. They shared only a moment to gasp in wonder, before he kissed Tony hard and pulled out slowly.
It had just… taken some time. He had never spent much time around children; always been too sick to help his mother care for the neighborhood kids. After dropping out from fine arts, his only goal had been to enlist, and the thought of actually settling down hadn’t really crossed his mind. Honestly, the closest he’d gotten to interacting with a child was the few times he’d had to take a promotional photo with a baby during the USO tour.
Not even a glimpse of the man Steve knew seemed to remain in his blue, haunted eyes. He wasn’t himself. It was an understatement, but this was far worse than the times he’d been triggered at home. Natasha had her ways of getting Bucky under control, but for Steve, it had only ever helped to fight Bucky until he had no power in himself anymore.
“It’s the ‘most haunted’ haunted house,” Natasha added, scrolling on some website on her smartphone. “It’s got dead girls and dead wives, and a dead couple, and a lot of dead men.”
His fingers probed the walls around him, and it did not take him long to realize the box was not just a box at all. It was some sort of container. And the cold hard material that his body rested on was melting ice. That was when shock ended, and he fully grasped the horror of his situation.
"You better keep that promise. I won't hesitate to kick you out otherwise." It was a blunt lie, but Steve didn't mind telling it, since he knew Tony would likely disbelieve it anyway.
“There’s only one patrol of Doombots coming here,” Steve explained. “We can shut them down easy, we just have to do it before they send off an alarm. If we do this without Doom noticing, the changes to our timeline should be minimal.”
Obi, had known him all his life, had overheard him and Howard talking and gossiping all the time. Obi liked to talk big, not shying away from calling someone names, but Tony knew he wouldn’t—
Tony’s hands—still resting on Steve’s chest—dug into him a little at those words, and he could feel Steve’s heart beating beneath his fingers.
With that, Rhodey slumped down on the bar stool, and grabbed for the nearly empty Gin glass in front of Tony, swallowing the rest in one go. “Best friend here,” he declared and put the empty glass down. “I’ve known you for over three years now, Tones, and you’ve always bounced back whenever someone turned you down. And now you’re sulking.”
"Anything else?" Steve asked just as he reached one of the less mobile vines. It looked like the creature's activity had changed somehow. It had drawn all its vines back, wrapping them around its base. Steve sent a glance up to where Tony and Thor were hovering up above.
He dropped his gaze to their hands, Steve’s gently folding the fingers of Tony’s left one until they made a loose fist around Ian’s hand, concealing it from view.
,” Tony said, taking a breath to say more, but Steve’s thumb brushed along his cheek, and his blue eyes bore into him, and that was all really distracting.
“No. It’s probably not, right?” Tony asked, shaking with a mixture of laughter and pure horror. Of course they didn’t get it, how could they? How could they understand that everything—
With that, he turned around and—gracefully—walked to the bathroom nearby. When he scrubbed himself down with a sponge, at least three minutes dedicating to his hands only, he realized how weirdly excited he was to have Steve around. Shaking his head at his mirror’s image—and yeah, there wasn’t anything to be done about his hair now—he threw the sponge into the sink and walked back to the workshop.
A quiet, bitter laugh rushed over Steve’s lips. “Sometimes I think he only asked me to help out here to see if I’d jump.” He huffed. “And I did. I jumped.”
“There’s a room for you, by the way,” he said. “Or a floor, really. Didn’t want to presume you and Natasha would want to hit it off right away, but I could also bring another bed onto her floor and…” He cleared his throat. “What I want to say is, if you decide to leave that cell behind, I have space for you; space that you control, and that only you have access to. Doesn’t matter what happened out there. You’re still welcome.”
Steve smiled, his fingers dancing around Tony’s cock. The smile illuminating his face grew seductive and he tightened his grip around him. Steve had memorized him so effortlessly. He knew exactly where and how to touch him, knew exactly how he liked to be kissed, knew more about Tony than anyone had ever known.
Steve smiled. “It wasn’t a spur of the moment decision to get you in the sack, if that’s what you want to know.”
In seconds, Tony watched as Sokovia got torn apart, rock and soil flying everywhere, and the only thought he managed to conjure up was that while they had certainly managed to save most of Sokovia’s population, surely not everyone could have made it.
Something inside Tony’s eyes shifted. Was that disappointment? “I was told I could find you here,” he said conversationally. “I’m part of the Avengers for this gig, so I thought I’d introduce myself before we meet on the battlefield.”
The sun had yet to rise on the horizon, but frankly, the next day couldn’t start soon enough. It had been a hell of a night, and now all he wanted to do—all he craved for—was call Tony and then get a few hours of sleep. But these things were too few and far between, even on a normal day. Any planning he did was second only to what Fury would say in regard to all this. He did not like to doubt his good intentions, but Fury was a spy first and foremost.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, took one more look at the tablet then walked towards the refrigerator. He fished out a bottle of water, then let the door slam close soundly, the noise reminiscent of a gunshot. Silence reigned, punctuated only by Tony’s knuckles cracking as he balled his right hand into a fist. He opened the bottle and took a sip.
—he’d break down right on the spot, and he had to—he needed to see Steve first. And it couldn’t wait any longer.
“You’ve both been weird since you got back from the mission,” Barnes clarified. “Tomorrow, Steve will come back and… just want to make sure there’s not going to be a problem.”
Steve grinned, ignoring the fact that he was still buttnaked—not that his husband would mind, of course. He wrapped his own arms around Tony’s waist, raising him up a little, as he met his kisses with fervor.
“Thirty-six,” Ross said, pointing at him. “And you’re going to work together with our teams, no tricks. You’ll link us to your team’s communication system, since you don’t have anything to hide from me, and you’ll share every bit of information.
“It was Rhodey’s idea!” Tony whirled around, pointing a finger at him. “And I need him to be there with me for this, so there wasn’t a choice, alright? Now leave and let me set-up the goddamn tent.”
“I need you to know that... that I forgave you about a minute after you were gone,” Tony confessed. “The rest was swallowing my pride. And it took a long time. From that first time that I heard you were doing secret missions in Wakanda, and I hated you so much for moving on… almost as much as I hated you for leaving. And the rest was me getting to the point where I could tell you. So I told pretty much everyone else. I told Pepper, Rhodey, and about a hundred people who never even wanted to know.”
At last, though the chaotic world swirled around them, they were alone. He was alone with Steve—no, not his Steve, but Captain America. And yet, he needed to know if
"I'm not other people, Tony," he said first, seeking Tony's eyes with his own. "And I know who you are, this is what I'm signing up for." He paused, considering his words. "You know who I am, too. If you sign up for it, I'll be expecting you to put in the effort." He reached for the fork and handed it to Tony. "Whatever happens, if I know you're in it like I am, we can make it work."
He had to give her that: Her act was perfect. She was bubbly and sweet, and pretended to be some famous model from what he could tell. Her body was just the right amount of muscled, but with lots of curves. Her face was mature, her cheekbones well defined, and her eyes long-lashed and very large. There was something world-weary about her expression, and whenever she was alone, her full lips did not smile.
Steve blinked, then remembered. “Oh right, your presentation.” He glanced behind Tony. “So it’s finished?”
The room here was just as tidy and modestly decorated as the one Steve had occupied in Stark Tower. There were several books lying around, and he spotted a pile of DVDs he would
When Tony looked up, he saw Steve standing at the door. He already wore the tux that still had Tony’s knees go a little weak. He didn’t look pleased, though, despite of the small smile he cast Tony.
“You can’t,” Tony decided on. “Unless you somehow know some secret to charm your way into their withered greedy hearts.”
The physical and emotional stress of the board meeting this morning sneaked up on him, and now that Tony finally had a minute to himself, he felt how much his feet and back—his whole body—ached. He yawned loudly and stretched his arms high above his head, wincing when his shoulders made a popping sound.
Steve inserted two fingers, thrusting them into him twice, before pulling out again, and all Tony could do was close his eyes and drop his head forward. How was it that Steve was so calm and he was such a wreck already? He’d had lots of sex with lots of different people, in ways that were definitely on the kinky side, but this was stripping him of every last grain of self-control.
“Well, I think you ask too many questions.” Tony’s brows quirked in jest, a smile tickling his lips. “That a yes to marshmallows, Cooper-o?”
“Ian’s fine. He’s a trooper, like his dads,” Pepper answered, rubbing her thin arms. “Veronica will stay as long as you need her. But you’re not the only one with an eating disorder.”
. I’m more worried that I’m not going to be able to go back to the everyday stuff. I feel like I’m in such a different mindset now than I was last month. I fought by
It was a loving sense of being unloved. A moment of love and hate wrapped into something that was purely them.
Still, it didn’t matter if he really was ‘history’ in Tony’s world and it didn’t matter if Tony had read about his life in a book—there had been a way to stop this from happening, and Tony hadn’t told him.
“No,” Steve said. “It was more of an emergency plan. At least that’s what he told me. He might’ve suspected it’d come down to it… I don’t know.”
“We’re ready,” he agreed, raising his shield to indicate they were prepared to take on whatever might come out the cradle if need be. His overactive imagination kept going over what could happen, should they have to face yet another enemy instead of gaining reinforcement. He could easily see it destroying this world rather than saving it.
“I knew you wouldn’t like it,” Pepper said, her voice mildly apologetic. “But the tower’s… well. We moved everything we could salvage to the mansion. It was the only remotely private space in New York that’s large enough for the whole team. It’s temporary, I’m already looking into alternate solutions.”
Tony rolls his eyes even as his lips quirk up into a helpless smile at the sound of his son’s bright, happy giggles. “So you don’t wanna go to school?”
Tony points a finger at Steve’s face. “That smile. I forbid it. Stop it right now,” he tries to sound firm, but it comes out a little breathless when Steve’s lips quirk up even more. “Jesus, put it away!”
Steve looks out at the rest of his team scattered all around the otherwise empty ice rink, and shrugs. “‘s my first time.”
Rhodey howls with laughter, and Tony glares at them even as he feels his cheeks grow warm. “He’s not–” he starts, but Natasha suddenly jostles him hard. “What–”
” Barnes is the first to get to him, all but barreling into his legs, and the rest are quick to join him; Steve lets out a breathy little laugh even as he takes the time to acknowledge every single one of his teammates. His grin is bright and handsome, cheeks flushed with boyish happiness, and Pepper is can’t help but admire the beautiful sight he makes.
The Quinjet started to descend towards the city’s outskirts. Steve offered a hand and Tony eventually pulled himself to a stand.
, that’s the life I want to live. You’re the only person on the planet who understands what it's like.”
The whole battle had been taxing for Tony, Steve mused as he watched him struggling for breath and taking off his helmet. He'd seen the haunted look on his face when the details of the emergency had come in and they went to suit up. It was amazing he'd held out this long.
“Speaking of secrets,” Steve said, his voice suddenly subdued. And there was that strained smile again. “There… there was something I meant to talk to you about. Just never feels the right time.”
When Steve met his eyes, there was palpable sorrow and regret. “I wish I could’ve been there for you. I’m so sorry I wasn’t.”
“Here, make a wish,” Steve prompted and raised the first cupcake in Tony’s direction. They were standing in the kitchen, preparing dessert. For a few blessed minutes, it was just the two of them, with Pepper monitoring Ian in the middle of all the craziness that was an Avengers team dinner.
Steve had to wonder if any of it even mattered to him or if he just kept on teasing Steve for the sake of it. If he did the same with anyone who posed a challenge.
Tony’s eyes were closed. His brow was pressed to Steve’s. He dipped his hand inward to caress his sac, his fingertips soft and exploratory.
Tony visibly swallowed, though he didn’t move away. “This could backfire real bad. I just feel the need to say it once for the record, so you can’t blame me later.”
Even months after he’d given up on Extremis, it still felt somewhat strange to wake up so slowly. He’d gotten used to come out of slumber abruptly, with the virus calling for attention on some matter or the other.
There was a short pause before Tony found his voice, but nothing could keep the disbelief from leaking into his voice. “Honey—it’s not a character fault that you’re willing to help. You came here to do good—”
