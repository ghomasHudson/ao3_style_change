John is silent, he watches Sherlock’s reaction to being caught.  He notes the curled shoulders, the tight mouth, the clenched hands.
“Sherlock. I could lie to you and tell you that you have a lot of friends and that they are just very busy or that you haven’t alienated almost everyone that you meet, but I would be lying and you would know.” Mycroft sighs. He doesn’t like the look of indignation mixed with hurt that passes over his younger brother’s face. Mycroft would rather hurt his brother himself and suffer the ire sure to come his way than let anyone else hurt him ever again.
“Mid coitus?” I chuckle
“Could you at least look a little elated. I know it’s all fake tantruming but for me alone in our home could you smile at least.” I say twisting the ring on my finger.
Mycroft took a deep breath in and out and said, “Read the file John. If not for your own benefit but my brother’s.”
“Today is a terrible day. I thought I’d make it better by getting our new home. John please. I know I ask a lot of you, please let me do this for you, for us” Sherlock mumbled into my shoulder.
“I’m not his date.” John blurts averting his eyes.  Sherlock who notices everything makes an attempt to explain.
“The alcoholic yet religious parents, the rising school career, sidelined by an unplanned pregnancy. Ripe for saving by one John Watson.” Sherlock’s deductions fling right at me.
“John keep watching the street.”
When Sherlock woke again it was with a hope that John Watson would visit today. He was lonely, angry, sad.  Sherlock decided to get up and out of bed on his own. He wandered the hallways of his floor, only clutching the handrails of the hallways on occasion. The exercise helped clear the cobwebs of his uneasy night. Eventually he tired again and slept, when he woke and it was the afternoon and there was still no John Watson he finally had enough.
“Sooner I get these off of you, the sooner we can schedule your release.” John says with a smile, “and the quicker you can get some real food into you like you’ve been whining about. Remember best fish and chips are from Gig’s” John says deftly removing the other sensor.  He misses the surprise on Lestrade’s face.
“You knew this would happen. You read something in her that you didn’t tell me. You fucking asshole! Why did you do this to us?” I fling at him prodding a finger into his chest.
John does what he is best at and saves a life.  Mycroft and Sherlock step aside to let him work.
“I didn’t break her heart, Mycroft.  You did. Because she was only 16. She was too young.”
Mycroft’s head snaps up, a look of relief filling his face.
He is just sitting back in his chair, straightening his tie when Anthea returns to his office, handing him a tablet with the dossier on Mateo Restrepo, alias Ricardo Rojas. His father’s family had owned a very successful coffee plantation near Quimbaya for four generations. Upon his father’s death, however, his older brother had taken over and slowly started converting his crop to something more profitable and less legal. Mateo did not want to be a part of his brother’s operation, so when he came to Europe to study in college, he found a way to stay. He assumed a new identity, a new background, and moved around through Spain, Portugal, Italy, France and England.
“I’ll get the bottle. Be right back.” I murmur running my free hand along Sherlock’s back affectionately. I warm the water and carefully test the warmth of the bottle. As I wait for the bottle to warm I hear Sherlock’s quiet voice over the monitor singing our familiar lullaby to our gurgling son.
“What is it Mr. Holmes?” John asks as Mycroft grabs the back of John’s arm and drags him to an on-call room.
Sherlock stares at John. No acknowledgment of what it took for John to say those words, to physically admit that he was so undone by what the other man would have done for him.
“For what?” the ratty man with the beard whines through his nose.
“Yeah?” John murmurs. He runs his hand up and down Sherlock’s flank, reassuring his partner that everything is okay.
“You, you deserve many things for helping this great man. This man. He cleared my name.” Angelo says giving John a meaningful look.
“Oh, like that then?” I sigh sipping my own tea and giving him a pointed look.
“Sherlock, I…”
He grew a moustache because he was bored.  He gained weight not running after a consulting detective, he stopped going with Greg or Mike to the pub. He was a new John Watson, free of back story, congeniality winner, boring, stupid, and clawing to get his life back together.
“I was busy.
“John?” Sherlock asks shakily.
“Sherlock what are you doing?....you’re drinking?” he says moving in front of me.
“Molly?”
All those same people who scold you
So a bit of pseudo-science. I know that amnesia doesn't really work the way I describe it here. Also not beta'd, all mistakes are mine.
“Right. Always full of surprises” I say settling down at the table. My mind drifts to him cooking for a little one in pig tails and the momentary fear of the unknown drifts away.
“Doctor Watson, take care of my friend. A candle for the table much more romantic.” Angelo says sweeping away.
“Of course” I say taking his now outstretched hand. A sad slow familiar song begins to play and I clench my jaw fighting the tears at my eyes, “This song...you don’t...you don’t listen to popular music..wherever…”
“It isn’t anyones fault but hers.   She changed her mind!  She fell in love with her own child. Christ John don’t you think this is just as hard for me or do you hold the only claim on sadness and loss in this relationship of ours” Sherlock chokes out, tears on his cheeks , and grabs something out from behind the bookcase.
I watch Sherlock jump up and begins banging around the kitchen grabbing eggs and bread and vegetables. The man barely eats, much less cooks anything so this is a definitely a special occasion.
“Just eat your food John. I’m watching the mirror.”
“Not good?”
“I’m sorry I texted you...I know you can’t...won’t see me. I have to go home” Sherlock says standing suddenly.
“So you could have your financial panic attack sooner? No John might as well pull off the plaster in one deft tug.”
“No, no. I have to take that to the vet?” John mutters pointing as one of the medics has kneeled next to the dog and has it wrapped in an orange blanket. John rubs his face and then searches on his phone where the nearest veterinary office. He picks up the shivering dog with “You better survive this.”
“No. Not yet. I told them I had to talk it over with you first, since it’s about you and I’m hoping you’ll help with the project. It should give you something to do during your downtime. They said they’d send over a preliminary contract for us to take a look at.”
Chapter 1
“We’ll have to see what John has to say about that. He should be down shortly.”  Sherlock can already hear his flatmate moving around upstairs, and knows that John will be getting a detailed update from the nurse before heading down to check on her for himself.
His blog would totally get a book deal, amirite?
Sherlock’s eyes widen with the sudden realization. “She has been ill. She still is, and she’s trying desperately to hide it from us for a long as possible.”
His index finger follows the longest scar where it crosses the heart of her palm. “What was it? The edge of a broken bottle?”
Harry is curled on her side in the bed, hidden by blankets and facing the wall. The water glass lies empty on the floor. Joanna picks it up and sets it carefully on the bedside table. She sits on the bed, her back against the headboard. “You ready to sleep?”
She doesn’t mention it again.
The boy lowers his hands and looks at her, colourless eyes and pale, unreadable face. “And you should know better,” he says, in a high, posh voice she’s never heard. “By now you really should.” He touches her face, pushing the hair at her temple aside with the slightest touch of his fingertips. “There isn’t a door in this house,” Sherlock says, “that wouldn’t open for you the moment you asked.”
Her skin buzzes with adrenaline; she avoids his touch. “Are you all right?”
She doesn’t know him. She has never known him, or anyone like him – a solid, stiff-backed man with thinning white hair and a voice like posh gravel, a man who wears a long camelhair coat over his suit despite the heat of the day. Unfazed by the gun, he walks up to the table and places a fresh bouquet of purple flowers beside Joanna’s bloody hand.
Moriarty pulls a flick knife from his breast pocket and opens it with a practised jerk of his wrist. In a single, smooth movement he leans down and cuts the plastic binding her ankles together. “Get the good doctor inside. If she tries to dislocate anything else, shoot her.” He opens the other door and steps out, the book tucked under his arm. The door slams shut behind him.
There is a sound like the wind over water, like the scrape of branches against glass. The floor shivers under her feet, rippling as she begins to sink into the stone.
He’s quiet for a long moment. “And if I’d come home to find you lying dead in the front hall?”
The ground trembles beneath them, the kitchen floor tipping as the house’s foundation sinks and cracks under the invasive weight of her roots. Harry drops the axe and holds tight to the oak’s trunk; Sherlock staggers in the shifting mud. The house groans around them.
“And you think he’d believe me?”
Joanna’s about to follow when she notices the potpourri satchel hanging below Madame Seostris’ sign. The satchel’s a drab little thing compared to the elegant script above – it’s been embroidered with a sigil of some kind, but the stitching is crooked and hastily done. A blessing, maybe, or an inscription of welcome. Not one she recognises or remembers. She leans forward to smell it and reels back, coughing.
This will likely be the last chapter for some time, as the work on Chapter 7 continues. Thank you for reading!
The flames recoil from the house, shrink from the walls and roof in a sudden rush of light and heat and collapse into a single form – a slim man made from fire, standing in the alley with the shadow’s fingers locked tight around his blazing wrist.
“And I really don’t believe you,” she says, hurt making the words sound sharper than she means them. “I’ve seen how lonely you are.”
The witch began to close the door, but the bride stopped her with a long-fingered hand. ‘Death has come for my young husband,’ the bride said. ‘If you save him from the viper’s bite, I will do whatever you ask.’
A gibbous moon is rising over Baker Street when Sherlock finally texts.
There’s a sigh. The canopy of the tent ripples in the breeze.
“Joanna, your arm,” he says, not for the first time, and she doesn’t know when he moved to kneel on the floor beside her but he is, he is close and steady and trying to wrap his suit jacket around her forearm to stop the bleeding. “Joanna,
The self-storage facility is in a business park, a sprawling ghost town of concrete and glass. The car drops them at the main entrance, and after a few minutes of echoing footsteps they find the right environmentally controlled corridor. The key Harry gave her months ago is marked with a tag for storage unit number 337; Joanna takes it from her coat pocket and reaches for the lock.
“Imagine my surprise.” Donovan lifts the tape so they can cross under. “We found a sixth body after Lestrade phoned you,” she says, leading them through the gate and into the sun-dappled wood. “Medical examiner says he’s a little older, maybe fourteen or fifteen. Hasn’t been dead quite so long as the others, either.”
,” Joanna says, laughing around the lingering taste of earth on her tongue. She laughs until her throat aches, until her stomach roils and her eyes water and she remembers not having eyes at all, remembers Moran’s lined face and red blood and the black hollow of the oak tree as it drew her inside.
The book’s paper is yellow-edged and thick, and it makes a soft, sibilant sound as Mycroft turns the pages. “
Mycroft smiles. “Perhaps,” he says. “But you’re the one reading fairy tales, little brother.”
“You’re not,” he says, but he hasn’t touched her shoulder, hasn’t reached for his kit or dragged her back to cover. He kneels at her side, burying his face in his hands, and she realises that it isn’t Murray at all.
“She died when I was eighteen.” Thompson’s never worn the bracelet before, not during one of their sessions, but it isn’t new. An heirloom maybe, or rediscovered favourite – Sherlock would know which, and a thousand other things besides. “I don’t remember much about my childhood.”
“I don’t suppose you can hear me, either,” she says, and the boy taps his ear in response. Then he reaches for something out of sight, keeping his gaze carefully fixed just to her left. A moment later, he holds up a notepad with the words
Joanna is silent for a long moment. “Would it have worked?”
The third needle pierces wood, sinking deep into the shadow’s chest. Three needles and three long threads of flame and the circuit is complete. The splinters of yew-wood within her light like kindling, gin-soaked and meant to burn, and they feed the fire until it swallows her whole – until her clothes char black and peel from her skin and she stands before the door naked, aflame.
The old man’s lips spread in a wide, bone-white grin.
The witch began to close the door, but the orphan girl stopped her with a skinny hand. ‘Death has come for the rich man’s son,’ the girl said. ‘If you cure his fever, I will do whatever you ask.’
“Show me,” the woman said, and the hermit led her out of the cottage and deep into the forest night.
It takes all her strength to pull him out of the water and onto the tile. His mouth is cold beneath hers and her breath shudders, stops
“It could be Lestrade,” she says. “We might have a case.”
The hermit watched from his bed, his clever eyes open wide in the moonlight. “Girl,” he said, “you are cut.”
She keeps her notes.
Harry rolls onto her back and gives Joanna a hard look. “Please tell me you’re not shagging him.”
Gran had disapproved of witches who used magic when a mundane solution would do just as well. She’d called them wasteful, self-indulgent, and Joanna never had any reason to doubt her – her grandmother was the only other proper witch she’d ever met.
Murray rolls her onto her back, and her vision goes white with pain. “You fucking idiot,” he gasps, terrified. “Bloody Saint Jo and her glorious
But the woman Agamede was not content. Before he had given her his final gift, Death had torn a single page from the book of secrets – the only page the woman truly wanted. She had at her fingertips the hidden, final fate of every man, woman, and child she met, but without that page she could not know her own. Death had deceived her, and for all her skill and secret knowledge the woman was as mortal as she had always been.
“Yes?”
and when she pushes the window slides open easily, without so much as a creak.
The Lady Agamede followed her love into the water.
Sherlock pounds down the stairs a minute later in his pyjamas, his dressing gown swirling around him like a ratty blue cape. He dumps an armful of dripping clothes into the kitchen sink. “Here, hold this,” he says, and shoves his coat into her hands. It’s sopping wet and smells vaguely of fish flakes. Sherlock begins to dig through the pockets. “I lost my favourite set of lock picks as well as my keys. I need to know what else is missing.”
She tugs the stethoscope from her ears. “Sherlock, if you’re in pain—”
“No, I just—” She closes her eyes and sees the boy’s face. “I never learnt how to unlock the door.”
“No,” Mycroft says. “I didn’t.”
He scribbles on the notepad and holds it up.
“Some things aren’t meant to be remembered.”
She raises her left hand and watches as the shadow does the same.
On the eleventh night she offered the horn, and held it low over the water. “If you are to leave me,” she said, “I shall need neither food nor drink.” She opened her hands, and the cornucopia sank without a ripple. Her love did not reply.
“Fuck off,” she says without much venom, and opens her eyes. Sherlock is a blurred wall of blue dressing gown and disinterest to her left; to her right is the bedroom door and freedom. She tries to sit up, but her arm refuses to support her weight and the cup tips, spilling water down her front. “Sherlock—”
She swallows hard, trying to summon her voice. Again, it is little more than a whisper. “Like I was hit by a car and my insides ripped out.”
The next few comments were mostly compliments, which Sherlock either ignored, or, as was John’s habit when he encountered a particularly thoughtful reply to his post, dashed off a simple, but sincere “Thank you for your kind words. They mean a great deal.” This, of course, soon began to bore him. He started responding as himself, but he did make an attempt to be civil. Out of respect to John, of course. He tried to be brief, and he tried to keep his disdain for the commenters to a simple “Obviously.”
John’s puzzled by this. “Why, exactly? Couldn’t she have come into the country on the Eurostar, then made it on to London from there?”
He looks over Mycroft’s shoulder, watching as his elder brother fabricates a story about a baby being snatched from a small birthing center near Ashford.  The center does not exist, and the baby had not been born there, but Eurostar does stop in Ashford, and it is reasonable to assume that is where Katherine had gotten off the train. It would be very difficult, and impractical, to get an undocumented newborn out of the country, so it is likely that it would the child would be found not far from there. The brothers also agreed that whoever was responsible for this was likely still looking for Katherine.
“No, Mycroft. I’m okay.”  She’s asleep again almost before the word leaves her mouth.
“Mycroft monitors my blog traffic?”
Sorry to go so long between updates, but the real world has been a bit demanding as of late. My apologies.
“Naturally.”
“Well, then, it has been a long time.”
“Once we were able to accurately identify him, we were able to retrace his steps during his time in Europe. The path he set his wife on was the reverse of his own. In each town, she stayed with a close friend of his from when he had lived there. She had access to medical care, money, security. Whatever she needed. Each host made the arrangements for the next stop on the journey. He had expected her to stay in Brussels for the rest of her pregnancy, but she said she would feel more comfortable in England. According to her host, a Virginie Renier, Catherine slipped away four days ago, when she said she was going to take a nap after lunch. She left a note thanking her for her kindness, but said she’d spent enough time with strangers. She wanted something familiar. We are unable to verify anything after that.”
“Right.  I wasn’t the only tag-along in the group. There was a Colombian man there, too.  His name was Ricardo. We were both keeping to the back of the group, trying not to stand out too much.  We were both missing the little pins that marked us as paying customers and hoping it would go unnoticed.  It didn’t.  We were chased away by a little old lady, making a big deal of the fact that we were ruining experience for all the paying customers. We ended up in a cafe, laughed over coffee and dessert, exchanged cell numbers, and said goodnight. In a few months, we were married, and we had both decided to stay in Barcelona for a while.”
Mycroft continues reading over the information that Anthea has provided, mentally retracing Catherine’s journey over the last few weeks. He wonders where her phone and laptop have disappeared to in all the confusion. He knows that she will not want to be away from her work for too long. It also occurs to him that the fact that the she would not have left herself unconnected may have been precisely what led her attackers to her.
“Can I take your coat?”
“He was something of a spoilsport.” Sherlock stood up and headed back to his bedroom, where they could hear him opening drawers, searching for something.
“I handled that call personally.”
John continues his exam, wondering how she had managed to stay upright, let alone drink tea and chat with old friends.  The bruises are extensive, and she no doubt has a broken rib or two.  But that isn’t what concerns him.  She has very, very recently given birth, and it looks to have been a particularly traumatic delivery.
“I found a card with Sherlock’s name on it and this address. There was some money, too. So I got in a cab and came here.”
“I was upset. I was leaving behind my family, two of the only friends that I had ever had, a school that I loved.  I was afraid. I was sad. It got to me. I was a teenage girl. The hormones were bound to rear their head at some point. Be glad you weren’t there for the rest of my teens, or during the early months of this pregnancy. I’ve been unbearable.”
Sherlock isn’t quite sure why the troll has gotten under his skin, but he doesn’t see a logical reason to continue looking for things that will only make him angry. He doesn’t delete the comment, but he makes sure that it shows up as “read” so that John will be less likely to stumble onto it himself. He wants to be able to track it should he be given a reason to later on. He makes a mental note to check back in a day or two and see if this particular commenter returns.
She does not shift her gaze from the fire. “Yes. I think you’re right. Thank you.”
He closes the folder in his hands, and sets the stack in the open briefcase on the floor. He scoots his chair closer, and takes her hand. He leans in so she won’t have to put too much effort into making herself heard above the beeps and hums of the various machines and monitors. He rubs his thumb across the back of her hand.
“It was such a hardship.” Sherlock responds with a smile.
John noticed Sherlock had paused in his examination of the coat.  He looked at John, wondering what insight he could offer, knowing that it was precisely at moments like this one that John’s medical knowledge proved most useful.
“Please.” She steps past him, into the lounge, and Sherlock silently pulls his mobile from his pocket and sends a short text.  She stands there, taking in the surroundings.
“Lestrade texted, inviting us round to the pub. I’d normally decline, but I thought a celebration might be in order. What do you say?” Sherlock stood and smiled, reaching for his scarf on the desk.
“No hospitals, please. He’ll find me.”
John rushes from the room, while Sherlock dashes upstairs to John’s room to fetch the doctor’s bag.  John finds Mycroft walking over to the sofa, carrying Katherine in his arms. John goes around to the other side of the coffee table, taking in everything he can about his patient even before Mycroft has a chance to lay her on the cushions.  He can tell that her pulse is irregular. She’s dehydrated and most likely exhausted. Her make-up and the dim lighting had hidden the shadows under her eyes, now clearly visible in the sunlight.
John finishes his call. “After seeing that toxicology report, I’m surprised she was able to remember anything at all about the last week.”
He decided now was the time to delete them all, since John was likely to start looking back over his old posts soon, in preparation for the book. Sherlock heard John heading back down stairs after changing, and he closed the laptop, just as John made it to the kitchen and started going through the take away menus.
“A proper exam room and x-rays, for a start.”John is working on opening her cardigan and the blouse below, when he hears a sharp intake of breath. Katherine tries to sit up.
John gets a book deal for his blog.
“And you came straight here. Do you remember anything else?”
Katherine laughs. “On that particular day, I think you were upset because you found out that Mycroft was coming home for the weekend, and your mother planned to make both of you spend your Saturday at your grandmother’s. You had planned to spend the weekend on some experiment.”
“If only it were under different circumstances.”
“Sherlock? What were you doing on my laptop?”
“At first, he was adamant that he wanted nothing to do with them. But, as the pregnancy progressed, he began to talk about home and all the wonderful and beautiful things about Colombia that he hoped to one day show to his child. One afternoon, he said he was going for a walk. He was gone for hours, and when he returned, he was...resigned. He said he had called his brother, they had a falling out, and he was prepared to do whatever was necessary. He wouldn’t explain beyond that. I didn’t know what his goal was. I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to bed early. He never came to bed that night. He woke me up before dawn to say goodbye.  He said that he was going to try to change his brother’s mind. There was a folder on the table with maps, timetables, reservation information. He told me to go back to sleep for a few hours, that a car would be there to pick me up at 10. My bags were packed. I just needed to follow the schedule.”
“How old are her injuries?”
“She takes hers the same way I do, John.”
“You have my undivided attention” says Sherlock as he raises his phone and starts texting someone. His lips are twitching into a grin, but he manages to keep it at bay.
Sherlock notes the slightly surprised tone to Mycroft’s voice when he relays that detail and is quick to respond, “Really, Mycroft. Given her attention to detail, you can’t be surprised that she would adopt the Catalan version of her name while engaging in a an in-depth study of the language and its evolution.”
“How’s your Spanish these days?” says Sherlock, earning a brief, though intense, look of disgust.
Sherlock looked back down at his phone as he received a response to the message he’d just sent. “In addition to the faint smell of vomit, there’s a hint of sour milk. There’s also a bit of marshmallow stuck behind your ear from one of those monster cereals that is marketed to boys between the ages of 6 and 9 years old.”
“Are you sure that you’re feeling up to it? I don’t mind bringing the tea back up.”
“You have exactly 30 seconds to look, and I’ll ask you to keep your deductions to yourself for the time being.”
“She always had a way of getting past Mycroft’s defenses. She’s one of the few that ever could.”  Sherlock goes to the the window.  John can tell that he’s sorting through the available information, trying to decide where to begin.
He closes the laptop and is about to go downstairs to make some tea when he hears John stirring in the bed behind him.
“She’s been here for nearly 3 hours. She arrived by taxi just after dark. She was picked up at Waterloo station, suggesting she arrived by train, so she wasn’t in London when this happened.”
Little more than an hour later, Sherlock’s room is transformed into a fairly well-appointed hospital ward. John has everything he could possibly need at his disposal, other than an operating suite , and he’s sure that one could be arranged if he asked. In fact, he will ask that one be placed on standby. He’s done what he can for her, and Katherine is stable and resting.
“How’d you know it was cereal? And that it was a boy?”
Mycroft furrows his brow, listening intently. “What did you find in your pockets?”
“Sherlock, an old friend of yours has come to visit.”
Sherlock and Mycroft are in the lounge, a map of London tacked to the wall.  The desk has been cleared of its standard clutter and in now covered in what John can only assume are the contents of Katherine’s pockets.  The clothes that she had been wearing are draped carefully over the chairs, and the brothers are currently examining her coat.  He knows they are trying to track the route that she took to find them.
“I am glad to hear that. I have never understood sentimental responses, and I wasn’t used to you having them. When I saw you crying that evening as you walked through the gate, I was confused. It has troubled me from time to time over the years.”
“There was a bit of orange pith under her nails, too. Probably breakfast”  He picks up the packet of pain relievers. “This wouldn’t have done much to ease her pain. I’m truly amazed that she managed to sit here and have a normal conversation with us for as long as she did. It had to have been the adrenaline that carried her that long.”
“Sit down, all of you. I will tell you what I know.”
Sherlock, without John having to ask, makes himself comfortable on the couch. He spends some time in his mind palace, but, eventually, he too lets sleep take him.  When he wakes up a few hours later, he finds Katherine hobbling into the lounge, propped up on the IV pole and arguing with the nurse that is trying in vain to make her return to her bed. Katherine finds her way to John's chair and sits down gingerly.  Sherlock nods at the nurse, subtly gesturing at the stairs leading to John's room.
“I don’t think so. She was hesitant to speak with me until I identified myself. I made an effort to sound especially friendly and apologetic. That seemed to calm her.”
Mycroft helps her to readjust the covers, and he smoothes the hair back from her face.  He smiles down at her.
While he would never admit it, Sherlock was quite pleased that John’s blog was so popular. He didn’t always appreciate the extra attention it earned him. He was arrogant, but he wasn’t vain. The two character traits didn’t necessarily go hand in hand. And he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t flattered by John’s attention, but that wasn’t it either. He was...honored that John had found him a source of inspiration. He did his best to keep things interesting so that John would have plenty to write about.
“Was she suspicious at all?”
Mycroft nods and looks down at his phone.  Having a new avenue of inquiry to pursue has caused some of the tension to leave his shoulders.  Sherlock places the coat carefully on the sofa, and turns to look back over the contents of Katherine’s pockets, strewn on the desk.  John goes over to stand at his side, looking over the items for the first time.  He sees the taxi receipt, a few crumpled notes, a few packets of an over-the-counter pain reliever, a sanitary napkin, and a packet of crisps.  There was a bit of an orange peel, too.
“There are few things that I regret more than causing you that pain. That is why I am going to do everything I can to make up for it now. But to do that, we need more information.”
Mycroft pulls a chair over from the desk, and takes his place at Katherine’s side. He takes her hand, as he did the night before.
He deletes his response and re-reads the comment. He’s surprised at the sentimentality it provoked, but there’s something more going on there, something that he’s missing. Instead of drafting another, more vitriolic response, as he had intended, he decides to see if he can find any other entries from this particular anonymous commenter. He finds another on the post before this one, and both were left sometime late yesterday evening. He can see that there are a number of other anonymous users that John has banned or comments that he has deleted.
Sherlock goes to look out the window at Baker Street below. He asks, his tone gentle in a way that it rarely is, “Did you question him? Ask for an explanation? It’s not like you to just do what you’re told.”
“I need room.” He starts listing the items he will need, barking orders at Mycroft, who does his best to comply. Sherlock is close on his heels, helping to finally free her completely of the coat, and without John having to ask, he continues undressing his visitor.
“I actually think the last proper cup of tea I drank was one that your mother made for me, Sherlock.”
John claps him on the shoulders, still smiling. “It seems the blog has attracted something of a following in the states, and there’s a publisher that wants to make a book out of it. Start with some of the stuff that’s already there, polish it up a bit, but write new stuff about the other cases. Anything new would be mostly for the book, so the blog itself would have to change a bit, but that won’t be a problem. And you’d write the introduction and could add commentary and the like. Maybe a chapter on what happened during those two years away. They’re offering a huge advance, that means I could stop working at the clinic -”
“Agatha Cullen, with Eurostar. I explained that Mrs. Rojas had left her wallet on the train and we were trying to get it back to her. We hoped that Ms. Renier would have contact information for her in England.”
“Oh, is he still deleting useless information?”  She heard Sherlock coming back up the hall, having found what he was looking for.
“I don’t know, and I don’t like not knowing.”  John could see Sherlock’s mind working. “She’s in trouble. She’s heartbroken, too.”
Mycroft and Katherine have a short chat when she wakes up to find him watching over her as she sleeps.
Anthea picks up where the dossier leaves off, “It appears that he had an exit strategy in place, both for his return to Colombia if it became necessary, and for his wife, should he feel her life were in danger.” She reaches over his shoulder to tap open a new file on the tablet and continues.
“Two years ago, I received a Fullbright grant to study in Barcelona.  One afternoon, when I had only been there for a couple of weeks, I decided to tag along with a group of English-speaking tourists that were visiting La Sagrada Familia.  I had taken a similar tour, in Catalan, several years before, and I was interested in how the information presented varied from language to language.”
“What were you thinking, John? Really?” he whispered.
“Thank you, Anthea.”  She leaves the room, fingers already flying over the keyboard on her phone.
He returns her smile and squeezes her hand. “Please continue. Time is of the essence.”
Sherlock can see the worry on his flatmate’s face. He wants to reassure him somehow. “Katherine has always had a way of surprising people. No doubt she’ll have a few more for us before it’s all over.”
“From what Dr. Watson says, that doesn’t sound too far from the truth. He says that you need time to rest, but that you will, most likely, make a full recovery.” Mycroft takes raises his other hand to brush a curl back on her forehead.
“Oh, I know I didn’t.  And you didn’t break mine.  We were partners in crime, so to speak. But that was all.”
Over the years, the blog had attracted quite a following. John spent a few hours every morning answering emails and responding to comments. He had asked Sherlock to help out with that on one occasion, when he was in bed with the flu and wasn’t able to focus on the computer screen for more than a few minutes. They had just finished up with a particularly intricate case, and Sherlock was in a generous mood. He had also been especially difficult during the case, so he felt that he owed it to John to look after him and some of his more mundane responsibilities.
“Unfortunately, no.  That’s my fault. I’m no good at that sort of thing.”
“Should I?”
At this, Sherlock turned and looked at John.
Mycroft turns to face Katherine, taking her other hand so that he now holds them both tightly in his own. He holds her gaze, and answers Sherlock’s question for her. “She trusted him to make the right decision. She trusted that he wouldn’t take such drastic measures without a good reason.”
Sherlock rises from the couch and retrieves John's step stool from the kitchen, placing it at Katherine’s feet and covering it with a cushion from the sofa.  He gently lifts her feet, then retrieves the afghan from the back of his chair and covers her with it.
“I’m sure he has an underling do it, but he gets a report if anything is unusual.”
Sherlock pauses his search for a moment, and looks at John with both gratitude and concern on his face. “You should rest. You’ve more than done your part. Let us work now. I’ll be sure to wake you if you’re needed.”
“In some way or another, I’m sure he is. He knows the boundaries, though. And I’ve learned to deal with it as long as he respects those boundaries. It comes in handy now and then.” Sherlock went back to his texting.
“And the baby?” Her eyes are wet, but she refuses to let another tear fall.  She knows that Mycroft has never been comfortable with emotional outbursts. She has put him through enough already that evening.
Katherine shifts in the bed, trying to sit up. She looks at the glass of water sitting on the bedside table, and, without a word, Mycroft hands it to her. After taking several small sips, she hands him the glass and sits back against the pillows.
Mycroft lets go of her hand and leaves the room, closing the door noiselessly behind him.   He nods at the nurse as he walks through the kitchen, and she quickly returns to her post at Katherine’s bedside.  He enters the lounge.
“I’d say the accident was no more than 48 hours ago, and the birth within a few hours of that.”
“Were you happy there, with him?” Mycroft asks, just as Sherlock requests more information about Ricardo.  She smiles sadly, remembering what it had been like to be questioned by the two of them simultaneously, struggling to keep up with who had asked what and when.
“That does not surprise me, brother dear.  I am surprised, however, that she would choose to give up her last name.  I remember a particularly lively debate on that matter one summer afternoon in mummy’s rose garden. She deemed it an antiquated custom, and insisted that accepting her husband’s name would be tantamount to giving him ownership of her body and mind. She was not willing to give that up.”
“Maybe you shouldn’t handle them, then.”
Joanna blinks stupidly at him. “What? When?”
The room is high-ceilinged and half-lit, echoing with her footsteps and the last bell tone reverberations of Sherlock’s voice. He stands at the water’s edge, looking away, and in the moment before he turns to face her she sees his reflection.
The shadow’s chest rises, the darkness inside her breathing deep, and then she slams her arm up through the fire’s ribs and rips out its burning ember-black heart.
“Why are you under the table?”
“If you asked,” she says, and leaves him alone in the lamplight.
Sherlock’s head jerks up, startled. She can see the shape of his lips as he says her name.
“Anonymous text,” Harry says. “It said you were in danger and needed my help. When I recognised the address—” She makes a sharp turn, heading south and out of the neighbourhood, towards Baker Street. “The axe was waiting for me at the front door.”
He frowns, and the lines around his mouth and eyes deepen. “I thought the years might have softened her. I was a fool.” He reaches into the inside breast pocket of his coat and takes out a crisp white envelope. “Give her this. I’ll wait for her reply.”
,” the assistant says through her teeth. Her face is flushed, her breath fast. Her Blackberry lies abandoned in her lap, but her eyes are still fixed on the empty air just over her clenched hands. “We really should be going.”
She licks her lips. “I’m sure you can guess.”
They don’t.
The taxi drives past quickly. She catches only a glimpse of stone and wood and darkened glass before it’s disappeared again, a shadow in sunlight. Next to her on the seat, Sherlock frowns. “You lived here as a child.”
Mrs. Hudson is bent over her, hand raised, face frantic and pale as chalk. The front door is whole and untouched, the skin of Joanna’s palm unbroken; there’s no sign of needle or thread or fire. Except—
but he was persuasive and she was still young enough to be persuaded, so when he stood her in front of the target and gave her the gun, Joanna raised it and fired.
“Can’t be helped, darling,” Violet says hoarsely, her lips dry against the rim of the glass. “You’re just such delightful company.”
“I won’t let them. Give me your hand.” No hesitation this time – he holds his right hand out palm up and she jabs him with the needle, drawing blood. She looks up and meets his eyes. “I can help you breathe once you’re inside. Will you let me?”
“A minor mishap,” he says, his sodden coat and trousers dripping onto the rug. “Though I turned it to my advantage in the end.” His teeth are chattering slightly, his lips almost blue. Joanna shuts the window with a definitive snap.
The girl stood from her chair beside the old man’s bed. “Then there is nothing to be done for you,” she said, and blew out the candle.
“Mrs Hudson disagrees.”
“It’s always meant to go to the eldest, but that isn’t the only reason.” Gran looks up at the ceiling. At the cracked lines of the plaster. “Your mother hated this house. She married your father to escape it. But you – if I give it to you, you’ll stay.” She stops, hard-won breath hissing through her teeth. “I don’t want to trap you here. Not any more than I already have.”
His fingers still. “I spoke to you, and you responded.” He picks up the television remote and clicks on the sound. “It was only nonsense, of course.”
Joanna walks up to the table, ignoring Anderson’s venomous glare in her direction. The kitchen lacks the theatrical atmosphere of the sitting room – the work surfaces are clean but stained with long use, and the bundles of dried herbs hanging from the low ceiling are the room’s only decoration. The table itself is old and pitted with holes, dotted by hard puddles of yellow candle wax.
“Yeah, a funny thing about kidnappers – they don’t tend to be terribly conscientious about returning one’s personal effects.” She climbs the steps and leans against the doorframe, loose hair falling over her shoulder. She pushes it back again, wincing as her fingers catch in the wet knots. “Should we try shouting for Mrs. Hudson, do you think, or go ‘round to the fire escape?”
Sometimes she wonders how long he’ll wait before he stops looking for her in his reflection, just out of the corner of his eye.
The shadow stretches out its arms and braces itself against the doorframe. It nods once, and Joanna grins.
He stops pacing and stares at her, his eyes narrowing to slits. “You want to come with me.”
The assistant shakes her head and smiles, a Mona Lisa in black Manolo Blahniks. “My name isn’t Anthea,” she says, and leaves.
“Yeah,” Harry says softly. She reaches behind her and lifts the blankets with one arm; Joanna slips beneath them, sliding down until her head meets the pillow. She looks up at the ceiling and listens to the steady sigh of her sister’s breath. “I’ve never understood why you gave it up,” Harry says.
Joanna grins down at him, though she knows he can’t see it in the darkness. “You really are very good.”
In a week or so the plot will be ready and the weather warm enough, and they’ll sow the first seeds of the year’s garden. Joanna’s never had a garden before, never wanted so much as a potted plant, but now she feels a solid sort of contentment at the thought of a summer spent outside, tending to growing things.
Joanna sucked at the burn, thumb aching between her teeth, and heard the words so clearly Gran might have been standing beside her, cane tapping impatiently against the floor.
and she stumbles, reaches blindly for the tea tray and the final sliver of wood.
“You didn’t mention them.”
At that Sherlock launches into an irate and excruciatingly detailed account of the various flora and fungi in the cabinet above the bathroom sink that require his constant attention, an account which continues uninterrupted as Joanna passes him the items that belong in the higher kitchen cabinets. When she blocks out the words and only listens to the drawling rise and fall of his voice, it’s almost soothing.
“No,” Mycroft says slowly, as if coming to a decision. “Perhaps not.” He stands, buttoning his suit jacket. “I do so enjoy our little visits, Doctor Watson, rare though they may be.”
“You have stolen for him one day more of suffering,” Death said. “He will not thank you for it.”
“Very interesting,” Mycroft says. His gaze lifts to meet hers. “You don’t mind, I hope?”
“You hardly needed to. I’m sure there’s something in the way I butter my toast or clean my teeth or tie my bloody shoelaces that gives me away. As far as you’re concerned, I may as well have the word
“Maybe,” Joanna says. “Or maybe the message wasn’t meant for me.”
She opens a tube of grease and smears a bit onto a clean finger. “How do you mean?”
Joanna takes a hammer from the pile of tools at the back of the hall cupboard and smashes the vials, each one quickly after the other. A jumble of voices spills out of the box – hers and Sherlock’s, Mrs. Hudson’s and Mycroft’s and others, lost in the cacophony – and she holds her hands tight over her ears and waits. When it’s done, she returns the box to the table, hiding it again beneath the stack of paper.
“Thank you.”
“Sir,” the assistant says. Her expression is smooth, her posture perfectly poised, but her eyes stare through the screen of her Blackberry as if she’s seeing something else entirely. As Joanna watches, a bead of sweat slips down the woman’s temple. Mycroft closes the recipe book and sets it on the coffee table.
“Fucking hell,” the frizzy-haired tech says. She sits back on her heels, brushes still in her hand. “Gov, you’ll want to see this.”
The assistant slumps back in her chair with a small, self-satisfied smile. “I told him you’d react badly if he touched the book. He underestimated you.”
“She is. Probably cleverer too, in her way.” Gran tips back her head, looking up into the blue depth of the sky. “But it would be a wasted effort. Your sister, Joanna, lives in the world as it is.”
“A group of children from the local primary school picks up rubbish here on weekends. They were the first into the wood this morning.” She glances back at Sherlock, a brief glare from over her shoulder. “I suppose you think that’s funny.”
. Then, after Harry’s name and her own:
He waves a hand in the direction of her garden, indicating and dismissing it with a single gesture. “Your grandmother grew herbs. It was her hobby, not yours – you abandoned it after her death. You find it comforting now to recreate your memories of time spent with her, a time when you felt safe.”
spell?”
Joanna rubs her hand over her eyes. “Better not. I’m awake now, anyway.” She reaches out and clicks on her bedside lamp. Sherlock steps into the light, and his shadow stretches long behind him, out into the corridor.
“I am not incapable of optimism, Sherlock. When the situation calls for it.” Mycroft pauses in the doorway, one hand against the frame. “You haven’t seen her since we arrived.”
Their host is watching her, eyes sharp behind her round glasses. She is unfamiliar, unsettling – a neat little woman with steel-grey hair and a flour-white apron. She sits at the table and smiles up at them, her hands folded in her lap. “So – the children found in the wood. You have questions for me, I suppose?”
“I thought all witches believed in fate.”
In the dark heart of the wood there was a grove of white trees, and in the grove of white trees there was a little black house. The girl banged on the little black door with her fist and said, ‘Come out, Mother Witch, come out!’ The door opened, and out came the witch of the wood.
, she says.
things for my arse. I’m fan-bloody-tastic, is what I am.” She spreads her napkin across her lap and says, “Now eat your pasta. You look like a fucking skeleton.”
The bride banged her fist on the door of the little black house. ‘Come out, Mother Witch, come out!’ she said, and out came the witch of the wood.
His chest sounds clear, so she crawls behind him on the bed to listen at his back. She rests a hand on his shoulder and feels muscle tense beneath her palm. “Lean forward, just slightly.” After a moment’s hesitation, he does. She slips the stethoscope’s eartips back into place, muffling the sounds of the room around her, and sets the diaphragm high on his back. “Breathe for me.”
His forehead furrows, and it almost looks like genuine confusion. “
“Sorry, mate,” Joanna says, joining a second sigil to the first. “You’re not really in a position to argue.” The third sigil is a signature of sorts, a declaration of intent, and as she writes she feels the world shift a bit, uneasy beneath her feet. There’s a sound like approaching thunder, a slow rumble of pressure building behind her eyes, and she quickly returns the chalk to her trouser pocket. “Suppose I haven’t forgotten everything she taught me,” she says, and presses her left thumb over the keyhole.
“This isn’t funny, Joanna,” he says, but it must be, because she’s practically shaking with it – his dirty hair and angry mouth and the look on his face just before the gun jammed, when he thought that he was going to die on his knees beside her – it’s hilarious. The funniest joke she’s ever heard.
“Joanna, can you hear me? Oh, I should have known – you’re as bad as he is, and don’t you dare bloody deny it. You might have
, says one entry, just above a list of ingredients that includes
“You’re lying,” he says, but he doesn’t sound sure. “Joanna—”
“Oh, Joanna,” Mrs. Hudson says, her voice trembling and kind. A hand settles between Joanna’s shoulder blades, rubbing in small, comforting circles. “You’re home, love. You’re safe.”
There was the smallest of sounds from without the walls, a sound as soft as the footsteps of scattering mice and as sharp as the slow scrape of five bone fingers at the door. The girl sat by the burning candle and waited.
A half-second of hesitation and he’s swivelling neatly in place, his eyes flicking over the crowd around them. He reaches into a nearby handbag and nicks a cheap travel sewing kit, its owner none the wiser. “Here,” he says, shoving the kit into her hands. “Now what?”
Death, as every man, woman, and little village girl knows, cannot be begged nor bought nor fooled, but he does have a gambler’s fondness for a likely wager. “There is nothing you could give that I should want,” Death said, though of course this was not true, and they each knew it. “You have no business here. Return home to your mother and father.”
“Eat your veg, dear. It’s getting cold.”
“That won’t be necessary. Her discomfort is only temporary, I assure you.” Mycroft walks to the door and opens it. He turns back, his hand on the doorknob. “You have a remarkable gift, Joanna. I hate to think it might ever be used against you.” He leaves, closing the door behind him.
“There is nothing you could give that I should want,” the woman said.
Her first thought after regaining consciousness is,
reads the engraving at the bottom of the portrait’s ornate frame.
, a voice like her grandmother’s says, and Joanna takes the black-threaded needle from the tray and stitches it through the skin of her burning palm.
“Well, I did learn from the best.” She shuffles to the bedroom door. “The ‘best’ is you, in case you were wondering.”
The woman pauses. Her fingers twitch. “I know you will,” she says, and sends Joanna into the dark.
“Your job,” Joanna says, and beside her, Sherlock starts to laugh.
Joanna tucks into her meal, and they eat in easy silence for a few minutes. Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen is warm and the food is filling, and for the first time in the last few case-crazed days Sherlock isn’t there to watch as she takes each bite, the great detective either twitching with impatience or silently congratulating himself on the proper feeding of his faithful sidekick.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry says, over-enunciating the way she only does when she’s truly smashed. “She’s my sister and I can talk to her anytime I like, you gigantic chinless
“You were going to let him in the house. What did he tell you?”
she thinks, and lets the shadow have her last breath.
“You were a talented surgeon. You could have been of use here.” Joanna looks away, and Thompson leans forward, persistent. “It wasn’t enough for you. Why not?”
“Last I saw her, she was in perfect health. Pink-cheeked and cheerful. I haven’t touched a hair on her empty little head, and I don’t particularly intend to.” He slides forward to the edge of the smooth leather seat, his knees bumping hers. “Your hair, on the other hand—”
“Go try it if you don’t believe me.” Gran settles back against the pillows, her hands folded over her stomach. “I’ll wait.”
giving the word the flavour of petrol and exhaust.
“You know, you’ve put me in a very awkward position,” she tells Seostris’ body, and crawls under the table. Just in time, too – at the back of the house, a door slams. A single pair of footsteps rings down the corridor.
“You’re so cold,” he says, his voice a low vibration she can feel in his throat and his chest. She nods and presses closer, wanting the solid heat of his stomach and hips against hers. The cold must be catching because he shudders a little, his hands sliding down to hold her waist. “That,” he says, sounding choked, “is
“Right,” Joanna says, fumbling for the door handle. “Thank you, Alice. For the ride.”
remember me? I’d wondered if you would. It has been an awfully long time.” She turns to Sherlock, tapping the back of his hand with her finger. “I knew the family very well, you see. I was at school with Penelope when we were young, and of course once we had our own children—”
The house takes her eyes and shows her the sitting room in 221B filled with black smoke. Mrs Hudson crouches on the floor in front of the fireplace, trying to reach something on the mantel without raising her head too high or dislodging the tea towel that covers her nose and mouth, and Joanna cannot imagine, cannot
, she thinks, and then with a terrible splintering
The night before the first autumn frost, she dreams of the boy sitting at the desk in his bedroom, bent over a book.
The book is caught in one of the neighbour’s hedges, not far from where they’re standing in the street. What’s left of the spine is charred black, and the front and back covers are gone. Only a few pages remain, curled in the rain, and as Joanna watches a gust of wind whips them open, revealing a picture of a woman – a woodcut printed in black ink. The woman is tall and robed, her face lifted to the sky. In one arm she holds a cornucopia overflowing; in the other, a scythe. Below her are four words printed in large, heavy letters.
And so Death gave the girl Agamede his scythe, with its blade as sharp as blood is red and its yew-wood shaft as long as night is black. The girl took it, and held it close at her side.
There’s someone inside.
Mrs. Hudson’s eyebrows arch suggestively toward her hairline.
Photophobia is a symptom of datura poisoning, but she’s sure he knows that. Sherlock may not be much of a herbalist, but he recognises a deadly toxin when he smells it. She smiles. “Sherlock?”
, Joanna thinks,
The night after they sow the first seeds in her grandmother’s garden, the dreams start.
The only response Joanna can offer is a slight smile; her breath is too shallow now for speech. She landed on her side when she collapsed, which was lucky – if she’d fallen on her back she would be stuck staring up at the sky, too weak to turn her head. At least now she can see the kitchen door as it opens, revealing Sherlock and Mrs Hudson crouched just inside.
The shadow steps away from the door, her feet solid and steady on the bricks below. The needle still buried in her chest. She looks down at Joanna with fathomless black eyes and says,
Mycroft is seated at his desk, on the phone. He presses the receiver to his chest, frowning. “My dear, I—” He looks again at Adrienne’s face and stops. Returns the phone into its cradle. “Good morning, Doctor Watson. This must be urgent indeed, if Adrienne’s let you through without an appointment. Or knocking.”
in his vocabulary. He lifts his head and looks straight at Joanna. “Your opinion, Doctor?”
“Is understandable, but unnecessary. I’m working. I’m
“I could say the same to you. At least I’ve eaten in the last twenty-four hours.” She sets the brush aside and looks up at him. “What do you want, Sherlock?”
The twisted horn was not heavy in the girl’s hand, and it was not light. When she looked into it she saw nothing, but when she reached inside she felt its potential – the weight of the world’s abundance in her small hand. Her mouth watered at the thought of olives and of wine, of ripe apples and rich creams and foods she’d only ever dreamt of, but when her hand emerged from the horn she held only a single pomegranate. It was as red as a drop of a village girl’s blood, and smelled as sweet as a kiss.
And yet, Joanna burns.
She nods. “I don’t claim to be the most mysterious of potential flatmates, Sherlock, but I’m a bit more psychologically complex than you give me credit for.” She passes him a clean napkin. “Even dull people can be unpredictable.”
Sherlock frowns. “Satisfaction of your neurotic nursemaid tendencies aside, that’s hardly necess—”
“Yes,” Joanna says. “Now drink.” She slips out of bed and pulls a clean t-shirt and pair of boxers from her dresser. She tosses them at Harry’s feet. “At least one more glass of water after that, and then you’re going to sleep it off. If you still want to talk in the morning, we’ll talk.” She closes the dresser drawer, and when she turns back to the bed Harry’s staring into space, resignation dark in her red-rimmed eyes. Joanna sighs. “I’m sorry. I wish there were something I could do.”
” Harry says, and that’s when Joanna first smells the fire.
He blinks at her, a brown smudge of sauce between his eyes. “That, I imagine, was an attempt to make some sort of point.”
A brief, unreadable expression passes over his too-long face. He reaches for a notepad.
That said, chapters five and six are a sort of mini-arc all their own, so there will be some closure at the end of what I'm about to share. It's not the whole story, but it is a story unto itself.
This chapter also involves some graphic gun violence, but nothing much beyond what has been featured in the show itself.
One morning Harry finds her asleep on the attic floor, curled inside the sleeping bag and shuddering with cold.
The shelves under the sink are a jumble of scientific equipment, hair care products, and junk. Even so, it only takes her a moment to spot Stamford’s pilfered stethoscope. Sherlock’s left it on the top shelf, coiled neatly on top of her grandmother’s sewing kit.
Joanna shakes her head. “No, I—” She coughs, covering her mouth with the towel. Her throat is raw. “There’s something I need to do, and to do it properly I need your help. Your blessing, at least.” Her leg is steady beneath her, and she walks back to the table. She sits. “I know a way to protect us from Moriarty, but when I tell you what it is, you’re going to think I’ve gone mad.” She glances at the ceiling. “Well. Madder.”
“Agamede’s, passed down from descendant to descendant. Passed down to you.” Adrienne steps closer, and her heels click on the concrete floor. “What did you see in it, Joanna?”
“Hold on, my dear,” Gran says. “You’ve forgot a step.”
Her branches tighten around his chest. “The mirror isn’t a weapon. What does Moriarty want with it?”
Adrienne sniffs. “How efficient,” she says with a familiar edge to her voice, and rips the tape off the lid of the nearest box. She opens it, rolls her eyes, and drops it to the floor beside her.
He hesitates, and then meets her eyes. “I was – concerned. For your safety.”
The oak would protect Sherlock from the house collapsing around them, but he pushes her branches away and runs for the human with the axe. “Harry,” he pants, pulling the axe from her hands. “Harry, you have to stop. Joanna isn’t just inside the tree; I think she
“The books Mycroft gave me call it the Ouroboros. The serpent that devours itself. They say that time is a circle, and that we repeat our lives in infinite recurrence – our futures already lived, our pasts forgotten and lived again. They say we create and destroy ourselves, endlessly, forever.”
John was coming up the stairs more quickly than he usually did after working a shift at the clinic. Usually, he’d be dragging himself up the stairs, ready to relax in his chair with a cup of tea and the newspaper. He burst through the door with an energy that was normally reserved for following Sherlock around the city, game on.
John returned to the lounge with the tea tray, passing identical cups of tea to both Sherlock and his guest, before taking a seat at the table and taking a sip from his own.
“You, no doubt, argued in favor of tradition,” Sherlock replies, as he finishes off a series of text activating his homeless network, looking for a lead on the woman who looked after Katherine on the train.
John tried not to look too surprised, but he was quite pleased by Sherlock’s offer.
John focuses on the task at hand, listening to Mrs. Hudson speak soothingly to Katherine, trying to keep her awake and alert. When Molly arrives a few minutes later, she draws blood and takes the other specimens John has collected out to the lab. Mycroft leads a nurse into the room. She takes Sherlock’s place at the bedside, while Sherlock gathers up Katherine’s clothes and heads out of the room.  Without a word, Mycroft follows him to the lounge.  They’ll leave John to his work, saving Katherine’s life.  They’ll set to work on saving her child.
He can see that the hasty sutures have torn, and it looks as though the child was taken by force. The car accident likely initiated labor, and instead of trying to delay it, they forced it. No doubt she was drugged.
Soon, all elements of the cover story have been put in place and released to the media. Sherlock leaves Mycroft to see what sort of information he can pick up from the homeless network, and the elder Holmes allows himself a moment to deal with the troublesome emotions that he is so practiced at keeping in check. While he holds his head in his hands, elbows propped on his desk, he allows himself to imagine a different scenario for that summer evening so long ago, one that would have lead him down a different path. He could have been kinder in his refusal, more accepting of her suggestion that they keep in touch. He could have waited a few more years, encouraged her to return to England to attend university.
“One or two.” Sherlock assumes the conversation is over, stares down at his phone, his fingers moving swiftly over the keys and his attention elsewhere. John realizes that there will not be any further conversation on the subject at the moment, so he gets up and heads off to take a shower.
“A card with Sherlock’s name? What did you do with it? We didn’t find that in your pockets.”
“You were not useless then, and I am quite sure that you are not useless now.”  He came up behind the armchair and leaned over her shoulder to show her the few photographs he found in his room.
“It helped that you were willing to aid me in my efforts to terrorize my brother. You were always the willing accomplice.”
Katherine laughed, handing the photos over to John for a closer look.  “He eventually did do that. Fortunately, he stayed away from her prize rose bushes, a chose to experiment on a few  in an out of the way corner of the garden. It took her forever to notice, and she never did, as far as I know, figure out the exact cause of death.”
John couldn’t help the whispered “Amazing” that escaped his lips. Sherlock gives him a brief, pleased smile.
Sherlock reads back over the exchange he’s just had with his brother via text.
“No. I threw it away.  As soon as I saw it, I knew I would be safe. I knew you both would help me. I also knew that it could connect me to you, and I didn’t want to give them, whoever they are, a trail to follow. So I tore it up and threw it in a bin.”
“Physically? Yes. Fairly sure. But it will take time.  Emotionally? I have no idea. We have to find the child.”  He sinks down in his chair, leaning back letting himself relax for the first time in hours. Days, really, if he were to be honest about it.  “I’m just going to rest my eyes for a bit. Clear my head. I won’t be of any use to anyone if I don’t.”
“I suppose you’re right.”  Sherlock looks to the doorway, where John is standing, a questioning look on his face.  Sherlock shakes his head, and John makes his way down the hall to the bathroom, leaving the two friends to continue their conversation.  “Why were you crying? I had never seen you do that before.”
Mycroft sits back in  his chair. “Katherine’s always had a great mind for detail, John. It will all come back to her soon, I’m sure.”
“I did. I do, but working with you is...well, it’s lot more exciting than doing a prostate exam or having some kid throw up on me, which happened this morning-”
“John, we didn’t just terrorize his brother. We also exasperated our teachers and drove our mothers to distraction.  Mycroft was the only real challenge.  At least half the time he figured out our plots before we had a chance to put them in action.”
“Right. Well, mystery solved. He doesn’t have to wonder anymore. It seems an editor from here in London transferred to the New York office. Followed the blog religiously until you fell and I stopped writing. When he heard you were back from the dead, he started keeping an eye out for new updates. He loved the post about the bomb on the tube, and he took the idea to his boss. They called me today, while I was on my lunch break.”
Mycroft looks up from the text he was typing out. “John, Katherine is a fighter.  As are you. You’re well-suited to the challenge of caring for her. I have the utmost confidence in your abilities.”
“How could anyone doubt John?” he asked himself quietly, looking down on his sleeping friend.
“Yes. I remember the train. But I don’t remember how I got there. Not really. I remember watching the sunrise from the train. An older woman sitting across from me thought that I looked weak, as though I had been ill, and she offered me an orange from her bag.”
“That would be convenient.”
“I was in a rear-facing seat on the left side of the car. I woke up leaning against the window.  My face was cold. The woman was watching me, though she looked down at the magazine in her hands as soon as she realized I was awake.  She gave me the orange about a half hour later, and she didn’t say anything else until we stopped in Waterloo. She told me that was my stop. I must have looked confused, because then she told me to check my pockets when I was in the station. Then she got up and walked away.”
“I was pregnant.  I knew I was. When I woke up, they told me I had been in an accident, that I was confused. There had never been a baby. But I KNEW there was. I KNEW IT.”  A wave of pain causes her to yell out, and John starts barking orders.
“And that is very good news.” A small smile finds its way to his lips.
“I’ve never given any thought to working on a book, but I do like the idea of you not working at the clinic anymore. I suppose I could help out a when I don’t have a case going. Are you sure that this is what you want to do? I thought you actually enjoyed being a doctor.”
Katherine, without shifting her gaze from the fire, speaks first. “I’m not 16 anymore.”
Mycroft comes over behind  the chair and places his hand on John’s shoulder.  “Thank you, John. For everything.”
The brothers turn to look at the map, both working to trace Katherine’s route from Baker Street back to her origin.
“I was just trying to be helpful. I took a look at your blog comments, and did some responding. I promise that I behaved myself.”
Sherlock could hear the shower going down the hall. He fetched his laptop and logged in to John’s blog. There’d been a new message from Anonymous every few days for the last two weeks, since John had been ill. They were all similar in tone, but not overtly threatening. Insulting, but not threatening. Sherlock was still bothered by them, but he hadn’t yet figured out why. For now, he was making sure to copy each one. He had a file going. And he’d asked Mycroft to monitor the traffic to the blog. Just in case.
“Have your agents check Eurostar for the last week, and take the search for airport arrivals back further, at least 7 months. We can’t assume that she came from America, and we can’t assume that it was recent.  John’s right. She wouldn’t have flown that far this late in her pregnancy. We have to assume she came into the country earlier or that she came in some other way.”
“John. Door.”
Katherine turns to look at John, smiling.  “I’ve actually got a bit of a chill. I’d forgotten how cold London can be sometimes. I’ll hold on to it for now, thank you.“
“I still trust him.  I haven’t seen him in over a month. I’ve had no contact. I’ve followed the schedule he left for me, slowly making way from Barcelona to England. I’ve hoped for news at every stop, but there’s been nothing.  I think there’s been nothing. I don’t remember the last few days very well.”  She turns away from Mycroft, sliding her hands from his grasp, and using them to pull the afghan in her lap more tightly around her.
“I was 16, and I thought that was old enough. I was wrong.”
Mycroft re-enters the room, his mouth tight and his voice tense. “Katherine Moffat has been hidden away in a flat in Oxford, working on finishing a draft of a novel that is due to the publishers in two weeks time. I’m afraid we must begin again.”
“The emergency supplies from the office. The rest of what you requested should be here shortly.”
The three men work late into the evening. There isn’t a lot of conversation, each one intent on his own laptop. One will occasionally stop to share a bit of information with the others or to ask for an opinion. Mycroft slips away at some point to go home, sleep for a few hours, change, and make sure the country has ceased to exist in his absence.  John goes up to his room for a few hours sleep after leaving instructions with the nurse to wake him immediately if there is any change in his patient's condition.
John raced through the door into the kitchen, expecting to find Sherlock sitting behind his microscope, examining the tissue slides from the bucket experiment. But he wasn’t there.
John gets up and heads to the kitchen, putting the kettle on. “I’m not surprised you’re having trouble remembering things, what with the trauma you experienced.”
“Whatever you need, John” Mycroft’s fingers move over the keys, canceling his earlier call for an ambulance and poised to start issuing orders.
“Hello, Mycroft. I was beginning to think that I would never wake up to find you beside me.”  Her voice is little more than a whisper.
John is on his mobile, listening intently to the voice on the other end while reading over reports on his laptop.  Sherlock looks up from his laptop when he notices his older brother enter the room.
“Ah, yes. The scrubs. And I thought I got a faint whiff of vomit as I walked past you. It was your second - no third patient this morning. He told his mother he was feeling better when he woke up and wanted to go to school, so she gave him cereal for breakfast. Unfortunately, the milk had just turned. She had a cold, so she didn’t notice the slightly sour smell. All of the sugar in the cereal kept him from noticing the taste until he’d had several bites. He started to feel nauseated again, so his mother decided a visit to the clinic was in order. He managed to keep down his cereal, though, until he got on your exam table. Lucky you.”
“Katherine.”  It is almost a whisper. A small smile plays at the corner of his lips.
“I’m sure she thought she knew enough. If she thought he was hiding something, then she must have assumed he had a good reason. And for his sake, he better hope that’s the case.”  Mycroft sits at this desk and begins typing, putting his vast network of resources to work.
“We are not yet sure what has become of the child. Sherlock and I have been working to retrace the path that led you to Baker Street. We know you arrived in a taxi. Before that you were on a train.”
The sad smile returns to Katherine’s face.  “I knew you’d get it, Sherlock.”
“I encouraged him to contact his family, to tell them the good news. I have no one left, and the idea that our child would have family and not know them bothered me. I had even been contemplating getting in touch with the two of you, asking you to represent his or her English heritage.” Mycroft smiles at this, and John chuckles to himself, imagining the two men he had come to know so well as uncles.
