The black mass was warm but as tough as rubber and no matter how far he pulled it away from his son, it did not release its hold on Peter.
“Pen me in for another appointment tomorrow, Dr. Banner, our talks do wonders on my soul,” Tony joked and Bruce groaned again. Tony did not wait to see if Bruce had anything more to say and ran to the elevators. He asked Jarvis, “Did you tell Steve where I am?”
and I cannot change that part of me anymore than you can change being Captain America…After we broke up and after I finished mourning our relationship, that’s when I let myself think about it again…”
Tony was usually inapt in mentioning it, but his father was a technological genius along with being an asshole. The man was coming up with inventions and elements so advanced that the technology of his era was too slow to keep up. Tony was like a sponge and only wanted to learn
“This is a laptop. You’re new to this century and, with this, you are able to access the internet, a nearly unlimited database of information. You can learn about the history that has passed since your plane went down. Or, you can research our enemy, the Goblin, otherwise known as Norman Osborn in this era. In this century, he’s yet to create the Goblin formula but he is still a ruthless businessman. Or you can play mindless computer games. Everything is available on this so use your time wisely.”
,” Steve pitifully gasped and squeezed Tony’s fists, Tony had yet to relinquish his grip on Steve’s shirt. Tony was trembling and his gaze was so stormy that he could not tell if it was from anger or fear. Steve glanced at the other two, the couple were staring at them with open curiosity. He turned back to Tony and whispered, “Look at you. Just yesterday you were so drunk you could barely stand on your own two feet. If just the knowledge that Peter could be saved would do this to you, then Peter here,
The Winter Soldier was kept in one of Tony’s blast rooms. It was a small closet, originally used to store his most potent explosives. It was made of solid concrete and steel. It was made to withstand the power of a great explosion so it should be enough to hold the Soviet super solider.
Tony rubbed his head and groaned. This was officially his worst nightmare and it was happening in real life.
Natasha charged forward and ducked under her soulmate’s initial swing. She twisted up to gut him with the blade but he twisted with her and brought his blade down to stab her in the juncture between her neck and shoulder. Natasha slammed the heel of her hand underneath his jaw. It jarred him and, surprisingly, didn’t break his jaw.
“I’ll call it Mt. Rogers. No wait, it got both of your ass cheeks, how about, the Rogers Mountains?”
Bruce sighed heavily and straightened back from the telescope. He groaned lightly as he stretched his back muscles and mumbled, “Not good. I have been trying to replicate what happened to me and try to find a cure from there, but everything fails…I’m not even sure what exactly happened to me…It wasn’t planned, not like Captain America. Captain Rogers had been monitored but what happened is classified so I can’t even use that to reference. Had what happened to me been monitored, I would have so much more data to work with. Right now I’m making guesses and all those guesses are off point…”
With that he left them alone. Steve stared bitterly at the spot Howard had vacated and again wondered how he came to this moment.
Tony followed the communicator’s signal to where Peter was. He had been expecting him to be waiting on the side of the street. His son sounded unusual but he was clearly alone. He heard no voices in the background so he had to be safe from the paparazzi.
Her mouth was warm and soft beneath his hand and he gulped dryly which did not go unnoticed by Natasha. Her eyes flashed and her lips flexed beneath him. They had been dancing around their soulmate status for nearly a month now. They were close and held hands or leaned into each other but were never more intimate than that…and he wanted to be.
Steve managed to get the coffee cup out of Tony’s hands and a glass of water in its place before Mary reached the lab.
Tony smirked at Steve and his friend mirrored the smile. Inwardly, Tony felt relieved. The awkward silence in the car ride was gone. They could do this.
?” Tony gasped and expanded the picture to peer at the bearded man. The video played and he watched as the man scrambled to hide the shield away. Tony continued, “And why was he here?”
“I’m never going to hear the end of it am I?” Steve called after the retreating forms of the women with an aspirated laugh.
Steve took the pen and Tony noted that flush had returned to his cheeks. Originally, Tony was going to lean into his side as he signed his name but, upon seeing his discomfort, Tony forwent that plan. Instead, he stood by closely and watched as Steve wrote out his name and followed it with his name in perfect cursive.
“Christ…” Howard suddenly leapt to his feet, scaring Steve, as he lifted his arms in the air and cheered, “I sired a genius!”
“Then we will face whatever challenge this intruder presents us and defeat him just as we did Loki,” Steve stated confidently. He grasped Tony’s shoulder and stated, “We’ll catch him. For now, let’s just be grateful he did not hurt Peter or Bruce and Jarvis escaped undamaged.”
“Right back at you, Parker!” He slipped through the crowd and disappeared into the masses. Once he was sure he was out of Eddie’s sight, Peter slipped the communication bud into his ear and turned it on.
“And I’m one of those few still left alive,” Howard said ironically. “Did you come all the way out here to save me?”
Peter handed over the controller with a frown and he glared at Harry. Harry stuck his tongue out at him and Peter murmured, “Thor is so going down next time.”
“Little brat better have a good reason…” Tony murmured, pulling on his boxers. “Friday, connect me to Peter!” He waited a few seconds for the connection, and then he growled, as menacing as possible, “
Without prompting, Bruce pointed to one of the holograms and stated, “He’s moving. With the Hulk sedative he inhaled, he shouldn't be conscious nonetheless moving!”
Steve stared at his best friend with wide eyes and Bucky continued, "If I go there with all of the stones, I can catch her before she dies and use the stones to make Clint believe she was dead and then give him the soul stone from the glove. Our past will not change...expect for that the fact that Natasha will survive."
“Sir,” Jarvis suddenly interrupted them with a stern tone. Tony and Steve separated in an instant and both of them looked to where Iron Man was landing a few feet behind Steve.
“Osborn! Get your hands in the air!” Fury yelled as SHIELD agents began to surround the Goblin with weapons raised. Fury continued, “There’s no way out of this so come quietly!”
His repulsor blasts were nowhere near anyone’s heads but everyone ducked down and the fighting stopped almost immediately.
have you been masturbating to? Was it an actor? A male model? Someone I know? What do you like most about a man? Are you an ass or abs guy?
Steve nodded and his eyes spanned the room before falling on the President. He walked over to the leader with purpose, drawing stares, including Ellis’s.
They tip-toed back to their room and, as soon as the door was closed behind them, they both sighed heavily and collapsed into each other.
“You’ll be going out on the Moby’s Tread,” Dr. Kaswani stated pointing to one of the smaller ships. The ship had a red hull and its deck was covered in flurry of activity. The doctor explained, “She’s shipping out tomorrow.”
Steve smiled and joined him. He grasped Tony’s outstretched hand and let him pull him the rest of the way in. He wrapped his arms around Tony and settled into his side. Tony started to kiss him and Steve readily accepted them but, after several seconds, broke away. Tony was distracted by something, he could tell by the way he was kissing. Steve asked, “Are you sure nothing is wrong?”
Natasha and Bucky's relationship is obviously progressing a little faster and that is only so I can break them sooner! >:D
Tony fell silent and after a while Steve felt brave enough to look back up at him. He was still “preparing” their food. He asked Tony, “Then why were you such a douche when we first met?”
"That's never stopped you before!" Tony panickingly gasped. Every second they wasted arguing abut this meant Peter was one second closer to view the video if he wasn't watching it already!
“Tony—,” Steve gasped, his voice strained. He felt like he was having an asthma attack. His chest was being constricted and only the tiniest bits of oxygen seemed to slip past his swollen throat.
They walked all around the house. It was much larger than he thought it was and Bucky explained how it was built into the rock below and even showed him an elevator that could take them down to the beach at the bottom of the cliffs.
Peter fell asleep in his arms and Steve carefully laid him in his bed. He tucked his son in then quietly exited the room.
Tony shrugged it off and went back to the bed where the mechanic’s uniform lay. It was a plain, tan, one-piece jumpsuit with the Army’s insignia on it. He could make it work. Tony slipped it on over his clothes and it fit fine except…
Tony clutched his heart and looked at him with wide eyes. He managed to garble, “Yeah – I mean, yes, all good.”
Steve grasped Tony’s hand, not wanting to let go of him anytime soon, and pulled him with him to step out into the hall and reassure his friend.
“…I think we’re going to need to get a little practice in before we go through with the plan…You-ah-you’ve been twitching a lot, we can’t have the paparazzi catch that on camera or no one would believe us,” Tony said and he felt a flush grow on his own cheeks. He frowned it wasn’t like Steve was his first crush.
Tony was about to pick up his hand to show off the time strap he’d invented but stopped himself. He explained, “I can’t reveal all of the future now can I?”
Steve glanced from Peter to the other two on the couch as the conversation turned personal. He stepped out onto the balcony and his eyes trailed over the view of the city. He whispered, “It has not been a home ever since you left…I miss you, Tony. I miss us.”
Relief and joy splayed across Steve’s features as he cupped Tony’s face and, in a broken voice, repeated, “You’re fine?”
Wade strolled to a stop a foot away from him and they stared at each other. Peter’s heart felt like it was being crushed as he stared at the mask. Wade retorted, “You’re not dumb, Peter. You’re the smartest person I know. I was…I’m sorry for what I said. Sometimes things slip out and I don’t realize it until it’s too late…”
“Steve would probably be cool with you borrowing some clothes,” Peter observed. Because of the Venom incident, Wade had been wearing the same clothes for days…and they were starting to get a little smelly with all the blood and what not on it. His chest was twice the size of Peter’s and broad like Steve’s, so it made more sense for him to borrower his stepfather’s clothes.
Water gently lapped at their bodies and sounded almost like the tinkling of bells. Their loud pants eventually slowed and became almost noiseless until all Tony could hear was the calm lapping of the water.
“How about significant others?” Wade asked. He wouldn’t understand the science behind it but he was joining in the fun.
Peter rolled his eyes but went back to the group event to see who was invited. He always talked to his dad about his life so he saw the usual suspects on the list like MJ, Betty, and Ned. The interns were invited too and the Avengers of course. His dad had used their SHIELD run Facebook pages for the invites so Coulson was probably shaking his head at it.
As Peter climbed up the side of a building and looked for someone to help, his eyes could not help but stray to the Avengers Tower. He could see cranes around it as it was being repaired. How was his family? And Pops – the last time Peter saw him was when he tried to rip Peter from Venom’s hold – he must have been
It was easier to find the Commandos this time around now that he knew what to look for. He spotted Steve with Bucky, their heads bent close together as they discussed something in secret. Tony grinned, wondering if
Venom lost its humanoid form and became a churning mass. He saw hints of Peter skin and then a hand shot up out of the dark deeps, clawing for freedom. Wade took a single hand off the prod and reach for Peter's hand and grasped it.
He also discovered how giving he was when Steve told Tony about devouring the food at the shelter, Tony sprang to his feet and gasped, “Of course! Your metabolism!”
, not the other way around! You did not cheat on me. You may be conflicted right now but…so am I…I know how you feel about Barnes…” He looked bleak for a second and Steve’s heart went out to him. The sad look disappeared and he met Steve with a defiant look and said, “But you are more of an idiot I thought you were if you think I am going to give up on you so easily! Seriously, Steve, I mean I am totally a better kisser aren’t I? I did not even see any tongue in those videos!”
, he had to go about it a different route. If he left the Tower, Pepper would notice and if he stayed Steve would check in on him.
“You haven’t officially met him yet,” Steve said. When Peter had originally been found, Coulson was one of the agents who checked in on him while they waited on the tests to see if Steve really was his father. Peter probably did not remember him.
Steve actually chuckled and Tony sat up straighter. He’d never heard Cap laugh before. Steve smiled sadly at him and mumbled, “I was never…” He cleared his throat and whispered, “I… I’m…. I’ve always been attracted to men. Being with a man...this is something I’ve wanted
Thank you for your patience! The new chapter is here! Real life and working on the monster of a chapter that was
Steve flushed and straightened so it no longer looked like he was embracing Tony as tenderly as he had been. Tony chuckled in his arms, “Smooth, Cap…”
He recoiled as soon as he saw where the Red Skull had shot him. He stared at the mortal wound for several seconds, unable to comprehend what it meant in that span of time.
“Yeah, but you burnt me too,” Steve murmured, rubbing his arm. The burn had long ago healed but the memory remained. “I want to find a solution that does not burn Peter to cinders…And Venom jumped right back on me once the heat was gone.”
It took him a while to find what he was looking for. In the time since he left it there, the snow had buried everything. Luckily, despite his fainting, he was able to triangulate where he had left them. It took him only a few minutes to find the exact spot and a handful more to dig everything out.
“But why kill us?” Howard murmured to Peggy as they entered the building. “Wouldn’t they want to kidnap us instead for our knowledge?”
Tony had probably just been in his workshop because he was covered in dark grease and oil. He wore a faded Black Sabbath shirt and ripped jeans. His arc reactor glowed dimly beneath the thin shirt.
Steve flushed and Gabe, it seemed, finally seemed to notice something going on between them because he wildly looked between them and went, “Wait, what?”
Steve joined Peter in playing with the balloons as Tony went to the kitchen to make some coffee. One by one, the rest of their family arrived.
“Steve, don’t make me look into this because if it involves me I am going to kick all of your asses.”
“I hate this…I just want to take all his pain away…” Tony groaned, hating the tiny teeth breaking through Peters gums.
“Maybe it’s because we’ve been using the wrong supplies,” Eddie murmured. Suddenly, Eddie yelled, “Think fast, Parker!”
Tears started to fall from Steve’s eyes and the words failed Tony at seeing him cry. Steve gently ran his thumb over Tony’s cheek, catching the tear Tony hadn’t felt escape from his own eyes. Steve then pressed his forehead to Tony’s and, in a hushed whisper, said, “I love you too, Tony. You are my everything and more.”
A few hours later, they were moving out. Tony and Gabe were in a Jeep alone and Bucky and Steve drove behind them. They were both quiet as they joined the lineup. Bucky drove and Steve was leaning against the window. His eyes were focused dead ahead and Bucky wondered if he could see Tony in the side-mirror’s reflection of the other car.
Natasha shook her head again and replied, “We’ve got people on it. We already have agents in Tennessee and in California, where Pepper was last seen. We’re going to find them eventually and we are going to help, just not in finding them. We are needed elsewhere.”
Fury leveled his eyes at Stark and studied his expression. The man was truly worried for the Captain. Coulson had written in his reports that there was the possibility that Stark was sleeping with a man. Had these two really grown so close in the short amount of time they had been together?
He’d seen the notebook dozens of times whenever Howard had sat at Tony’s sickbed and worked on his equations.
“Okay! I give up!” Peter gasped. Smirking in a self-satisfied way, Wade landed on the bed beside Peter and Peter picked up his phone. His breathing was shallow as he was still trying to catch it, but he wordlessly opened his phone and turned it to Wade so he could see the post. It was only a few minutes old but it already had several thousand likes.
“I –! I don’t know what to say!” Tony gasped. Tony planned to support Bucky but…he didn’t think he was ready for this. He didn’t think he would ever be able to. He didn’t want to say goodbye because…because he wasn’t ready. Steve was still in his heart. He didn’t want to let him go yet…
Steve looked around the room with a hint of shock then leaned over to Tony and whispered, “I thought they drafted the statement?”
His fear spiked and the loss of Tony sent a jolt of fear through him so powerful Steve’s eyes finally snapped open.
They went back to Peter's room and Peter automatically went to his cell phone. He hadn't checked it all day and when he opened it he saw he had quite a few notifications. He scrolled through them, ignoring the Facebook birthday messages and likes on Instagram.
“N-No…I mean… I just thought my soulmate would be a woman because I…I wanted a family, but…” Steve flushed and finally met Tony’s eyes. Tony expected to see disgust or anger in the man’s gaze.
…But I’d remind him, it was okay because he’s changed me…I’m better because of him.” Tony looked up at Pepper, her eyes were glistening too, and he asked, “Do you think I can still be better?”
Bucky ran his fingertips over Steve’s forehead, pushing back the invisible fringe of hair Steve had cut off long ago. He stared deeply into Steve’s eyes and something flickered in his stormy vision.
“A lot happened this year,” Steve said with a shrug. It felt strange to him too. It really did felt like only a few weeks had passed,
Steve turned to Tony with a frown and stated, “There is no way that is fitting in Peter’s toy chest!”
“We’ve done it in this place a number of times,” Tony noted, encouraged by Steve’s tone of voice. He no longer sounded morose, he sounded normal enough for Tony to tease. He drew his hand suggestively down Steve’s chest and his muscles flexed under his touch.
Peter stood up straight with his arms slightly flexed at his sides in a loose defense. He agreed, “Yes, it turned out to be a little more defensive than a simple shield.”
The suit opened up and Tony threw himself from it and ran into Steve’s arms. He slammed his mouth into Steve’s and Steve swallowed Tony’s exultant sob.
“Fuck no you don’t!” Tony hissed. “He just killed this guy!” Tony waved to the dead man at his feet.
But, it was also something Steve had craved. Neither of them brought it up before because of the newness to their romantic relationship and the dire situation Tony was in, in the real world. But now...
His eyes flickered to Steve’s waist and saw the telltale bulge was still there. Tony was tempted to adjust the same bulge in his jeans but he did not want to draw attention to it.
Peter dropped his head and put his hand over Steve’s. He whispered, “I care about him…I’ve kissed him but I’m scared of doing more. I had kissed before but the mechanics of kissing with a man and a woman are pretty much the same…after that though…”
“P-Peter?” His mother gasped as if she did not believe him to really be there. Her eyes flickered to her partner then back to him.
“But I want to celebrate the first time I touched you, the first time I kissed you, and the first time we looked at each other and just
“Then think of it this way…Bruce was trying to recreate the super soldier serum, when he had created the Hulk instead.” Bucky stated, “Pete may have been trying to make something good but made
The team grew silent again and their eyes all went to the TV where the reporter was recounting the scene between Steve and Tony.
Peggy wrapped an arm around his waist and leaned into his side. Steve leaned back and dropped his head on top of hers and she whispered, “Don’t thank me…You two are falling into a tragic love story and I can see it all enfolding and there’s nothing I can do to stop it…”
Steve pushed Tony against the wall and Tony instantly plunged his tongue into Steve's throat. Steve groaned and Tony near about came from the sound.
One more chapter to go! Tony and Steve seem to be happy but what about Bucky? Will Natasha forgive them? Or will the happy ending only be for one couple?
“We will be moving out tomorrow and we will first go to the southern French base but from there we will go the Allies’ stronghold in Switzerland so I can get the resources I need for Tony and be able to help the Commandos if need be. Phillips says you’ll be based out of there until you verify the information on Zola.”
He rubbed his hardening desire into Tony’s abdomen and his husband groaned into his mouth. Steve reached down, picked Tony up, and deposited him on the counter. Tony busily ripped at Steve’s clothing, his lust, driven by intoxication, seemingly erased from his mind whatever he was going to ask Steve.
“The breaks in my bones are only minute fractures now, I can walk on them for short periods and my skin is already starting to regrow,” Steve stated. He had already removed most of the bandages and only kept the ones on his face so not to scare Peter. His flesh was mostly exposed on his jaw and only a part of his ear had grown back. The white of his left eye was also bright red so he kept it closed. His hands were dark red and swollen as was the skin of his neck and the right side of his face. Yet, since he woke the swelling had gone down greatly. Steve was confident he would be better in a few days at this rate.
Venom’s body exploded as the green beast pushed back with an incredible force. As he reformed, he heard the beast murmur, “This experiment obviously failed. You are worthless to me.”
Sighing heavily, he slipped off the train and decided to walk around whatever town he was in before jumping another train.
Steve spent as much time as he could with Tony and he kept up a brave face for the man to support him. Tony went on like nothing was wrong and went right back to Panzer, looking for work. Steve sat with him and helped him where he could, smiling encouragingly all the while.
“Yeah, I saw your orders to your men stateside. We need to get a handle on these super humans. Thor and his merry men are gone but the Captain is ours and we need to keep it that way. I don’t want anyone else getting their hands on him,” Fury commanded.
Bucky actually flushed and stepped away from Natasha to whisper in Tony’s ear, “When a fella has a pretty dame like that wanting some physical contact, he’s got to be gay or crazy to say no.”
He couldn’t remember the teasing barbs the Commandos threw at him after the mission, nor the moment when he changed out of his muddy clothes, or when Jarvis left his side after fretting over him.
“Papa!” He exclaimed, reaching out to Steve with wide arms. Steve scooped Peter out of Bruce’s hold and held him close. He ignored the others and devoted all his attention on his son. His guilt tripled as he saw the exhaustion in Peter's features and his red eyes.
He couldn’t help but remember the older Tony calling him “Howard” instead of “Dad” and Howard was resolved to change that.
“Ask where my kids are!” Clint gasped. Natasha grabbed his hand and the archer grabbed her offered hand with both of his.
“I can provide all of that,” Peggy volunteered. She stepped out of the tent and Jarvis went to follow but paused beside Tony.
“…We didn’t say anything in front of Tony because we knew he’d go running to Peter and try to take it from him…but, if our suspicions are confirmed and it’s like the Hulk, this thing probably won’t go away easily…” Bucky murmured ominously. “We don’t want Peter to get hurt.”
"Sir, several images have recently been uploaded onto social media. Spider-Man is downtown. Would you like me to send you exact coordinates?"
“Because you hit me first, so I am clearly Subject A. Now, are you going to throw the paperclip first or should I do it?"
Steve grabbed him and pulled him into his arms. He couldn’t smother the pain, but he could have Tony…he could try and concentrate on his soulmate instead of the pain.
I'mmmm baaccckkkk! And thank you once again for your patience! I use my tablet to write and log into Ao3 and did not bring it with me while I was backpacking, so I was unable to write or reply to anyone's comments in the meantime but I promise to do so right after I post this chapter!
His lawyers exchanged glances then their leader stated, “We will do the best of our abilities to do so but it will probably come out during the trial. People will want to know. If you are questioned on the stand about it, you cannot lie.”
Before Steve could ask if Tony suspected Sam, Tony dove sharply so they would be less likely to be noticed and landed them on the hospital’s roof.
“The DNA test you took today will take a few days to process. We both know it is going to come back positive,” Tony stated seriously.
Steve carefully reached out and touched the spot where a picture of the team once hung. The wall, once covered with pictures, was bare, with the exception of a few leftover nails. Steve turned back to Tony, his eyes filled with pity, and whispered, “
“I could always feel things in this world, it’s diluted and it’s only things associated with my emotions or with you…” Steve whispered, lightly caressing Tony’s fingers with his thumb. “I can feel the warmth of your skin when you touch me or…or when I had cried I had felt my lungs burn from my shallow breathing…but I think it was because those things were associated with my memories or maybe even a combination of both of our memories. But right now, this…” Steve stared at the tingling fingers with a pinched brow and stated, “I haven’t felt this in decades, my fingers feel like that pins and needle feeling when your hand has gone numb…”
“I thought it would only be one-sided,” Tony replied with a shrug. Tony smirked and stated, “You would not believe how amazing it was when you told me you were gay! It was like I had all the 4
He was already imagining picket fences, the happy smile of his soulmate and the laughter of their children.
Steve opened his mouth to deny it but he could not raise his voice. He could not lie to him again. Steve’s eyes flickered down to Peter’s sleeping form. He did not want to see the betrayal in Tony’s eyes.
Now that Tony was sleeping in the barracks, Tony had taken to bathing in a spring behind the Hydra compound. It was bitterly cold and no one else used it for this reason which gave Tony the privacy he needed when removing the bandages around his chest and properly cleaning the stink of the day off of him.
century, he would have never dared to even imagine this happening. Now he felt like he was stepping into some sort of fantastical dream.
“You’re not the only superhero on the streets of New York, Pete. The city is practically crawling with them,” Tony reasoned. “…Maybe it’s time you stop fighting the small time crime and became a full-fledged member of the team?”
Even though it was years later, some nights Bruce woke screaming out in terror from what he had inadvertently done. Bruce inwardly sighed and reached out to lightly touch Peter’s head. Peter will now share similar nights and Bruce was powerless to stop it. All he could do was the same as Tony currently was, offering a shoulder to cry on when it became too much. The poor boy…He had a hard life ahead of him.
Tony’s breath hitched and his fingers dug into Steve’s back. He gasped, “You shouldn’t say things like that…Unless you mean it.”
Bucky nodded to the memorial, his expression growing more somber as his eyes beheld the statue. Tony half turned back to the statue and his eyes automatically went back to its face and his heart twisted a little in his chest.
Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out a small jar. He held it up to Tony and said, “I hunted down Howard and told him I was looking for a cream for my skin. I figured he’d be the only one in camp with a ‘ridiculously expensive’ cream like you used to use…but the label doesn’t say what it contains so I don’t know if it has the same Japanese seaweed stuff in it like your other cream.”
, was that man annoying! He kept stealing Tony’s food! Tony was a snacker and so was Bucky apparently. Neither one of their stashes was safe while the other was around…
“Let’s get dressed, put those bandages on you, and then I’ll introduce you to the Commandos,” Steve said. “And then I’ll get you unofficially a part of the mechanics’ division.”
The cryostasis chamber was a little bigger than a coffin and there was a small window to look within. The window was scratched up and heavily iced so it was hard to see through, yet, Tony could discern Bucky’s sleeping face. He had some kind of breathing mask covering half of his face and his hair was longer, but he looked just like the man he had befriended in the early 20
“Since my man has worn me out, I am going to fall back to sleep until you get back,” Tony stated, burrowing his head into his bent arm.
was the Chameleon’s gift to the Goblin for his escape from SHIELD,” Mary replied. “He wanted a way to get Venom to the boy and he felt his mother was the best way to go about it. So I was created with the boy’s DNA. Remember the break in at your tower? The Goblin broke into your husband’s lab to throw off suspicion but he was after Peter’s DNA. You all fell for it beautifully, by the way.”
“Is Peter here?” Tony asked, afraid to hear the about Peter or what their relationship had evolved into… Did he even want to see Tony?
Or Tony, whose faith in technology was absolute, would see his implant reset, and know with absolute certainty he was gone.
“Want to find the others?” Eddie asked, referring to the other interns who had also gotten invites. There were six of them in all and none of them were used to this style of party.
Bucky loved him, really loved him and was depending on him. Steve loved Tony and Tony loved him but he was not too fond of Bucky. What if keeping Bucky around drove him away? And what about Natasha? She hated Bucky with a passion. Would his trying to help his friend break apart the team?
“No!” Tony gasped, grabbing Thor’s arm as he lowered the hammer. “Steve is completely healed! There is nothing wrong with him other than he won’t wake up!”
Peter turned to his boyfriend and said, “I guess you didn’t wait for the rest of the team and rushed ahead instead of listening to Steve’s plan.”
Through the cloth he could feel the heat radiating off Tony. Gabe had been pumping him full of penicillin and other anti-inflammatories but Tony’s body was struggling with the infection. Even the light in his chest seemed dimmer…
” Tony groaned. His head tipped forward and he buried his face in Steve’s chest, right between his clenched fists. He hissed, “
“Bucky, how – what – what are you doing?” Steve had so many questions but the most important was this one. How was his friend alive? Why was he attacking Tony? And what was in that syringe!?
“That will anger him,” James gasped like he was being strangled. He let go of Steve and fell into the wall. Steve staggered to the side and caught the opposite wall. His concerned focus was entirely on James.
“More Palladium must be leaking out than usual,” Gabe stated to Tony, but it was loud enough for all of them to hear. “Your body can’t handle this much metal poisoning. It’s only going to get worse from here on…”
Steve lean forward and pressed his forehead to Tony’s. Tony adjusted his arms, wrapping them around his back and sighed contently as he settled against Steve. Their eyes met and Tony tiredly smiled at him, making Steve’s heart contract.
Steve shouldn’t be surprised. The thing probably knew all of their histories but he still felt shocked by its correct deduction and the abrupt change in Sneaky’s mannerism. He replied, “Yes, yes, he’s the one. Do…Do you know him in the future?”
They hadn’t spent uninterrupted time with each other in such a long time that they were cautious at first but they quickly fell back into their old routines and it was almost like their evasions had never happened. The last couple of days had been filled with laughter, loud debates over the results of various card and board games, and horrible comebacks (Tony mostly, not that he’d admit it).
Venom slowly stalked up to him and the green beast murmured approvingly, “Yes, come, come to my loving arms, son. I will feed you. I will take care of you. Then, together, we shall destroy all of those who have wronged me.”
Steve looked from Bucky and frowned at Tony. He had to agree with his friend. Tony’s idea sounded borderline catastrophic.
“The high-pitched frequency –,” Tony began, his thoughts immediately went to the first time they tried to capture Venom. It only did not work because Venom had destroyed the speakers! They could still use it! Tony sat up sharply with the words but moved too quickly and jolted Peter.
“Did you just –?!” Tony hissed but his words were cut off when that pressure pushed down on him from all sides, crushing him. Tony collapsed to his knees and Steve fell beside him. He shakily reached out to Steve and grabbed his hand. Their eyes met and the last thing he saw was Steve’s scared gaze.
She ran her fingers through his hair and promised, “We are fine. You broke through it just in time.”
“Before you get to that…I need to hear how in the hell you and the Winter Soldier became so buddy-buddy,” Fury stated, coming out of the very trees Bucky and Tony had been hiding behind earlier. Agents spilled out of the World War II Memorial, behind trees, or cars, and just about anything that one could hide behind. They were surrounded in seconds.
“Bucky and I shared a smaller bed when we lived together. I’m fine with it as long as you are,” Steve replied.
Steve paused as he realized what had passed between them. He met Tony’s eyes and seriously stated, “I mean it. I never loved anyone the way I love you.”
He had no idea how he ended up in the future, but, he was there, and in the same era as Tony like he had desperately craved. He needed to somehow get to his lover and find out if he time traveled yet. But he had no idea how to find Tony or who he could trust to ask.
“We share the same father silly,” Ultron chided. “But wow, feel that big boy strength! You’re no normal human! Feels like you somehow got a little of Steve in you too. Did you eat all of your greens when you were growing up or get some vita-rays nutrients like Stevie instead?” Ultron asked, making fun of Peter's attempt to break free of his hold.
He finally gave in and pulled Peter in with a laugh. Peter grinned and they kissed. Wade melted into the kiss, feeling like the star of his own personal fairytale. He was kissing the embodiment of Prince Charming, no, Peter was handsomer with a
It opened up to the back of the frame and he turned it over. The paper slipped from his fingers and floated down without his notice as he stared at the revealed image.
“WHERE IS HE?!” Uncle Bucky demanded as he slammed open the door to the stairwell. The team parted and his uncle’s eyes focused on Peter with murderous intent.
Growing up together they’d always been each other’s support. They were stronger for it. Bucky listened to Steve’s fears, held his hand, and reminded him that, no matter what happened with Tony, Bucky was there for him…til the end of the line.
“Truthfully, I wanted to see the once great Captain America before I completely destroy him,” he replied with an air of triumph. “This is the last time you will glower at me like you are right now or be so defiant or willful. I want to appreciate this last moment.”
And that was how Steve ran into Tony, wearing only his SHIELD regulation, flimsy bathrobe and boxer briefs, and was sporting a half hard cock caused by the very man standing before him.
Tony squawked with outrage and hit Steve with a pillow, gasping, “I swore I’d never use that thing as a lubricant again!”
Otherwise, the next couple of chapters are going to be heavily influenced by the Iron Man 3 movie. Since Steve is involved and Tony and Pepper are not in a relationship, the events are going to be drastically different.
It was another thing Steve was going to have to add to his list of ever growing problems. Feeding his boyfriend while on the run.
Steve and Tony had successfully kept Peter’s identity a secret. Whenever the media referred to their boy they used the grainy cell phone pictures taken of him as a pudgy toddler. But as a skinny 6-soon to be 7-year-old child, Peter looked like he could have been anyone’s son.
Steve pulled back sharply. The blisters were already disappearing from his skin and his head was clearer thanks to being out of the heat. He gasped, “Pepper!”
Steve tucked him back into his side and murmured, “Alright, alright…let’s find you something to eat…”
“I think you destroyed the battlefield for anyone trying to even attempt to go after me,” Steve replied. “I don’t think I will be able to love another like you.”
“The quinjet is shutting down its engines and a man had departed the vehicle,” Jarvis continued. “He states…”
Steve huskily laughed and then cleared his throat as he took Tony’s hand in his and shook it. He stated, “Deal, I’ll be one of New York’s first gay marriages.”
“You got it,” Rhodes replied, he clipped Steve’s shield off the back of the suit, and jumped into the marginally cooler armor. He took off with a blast and joined the may-lay.
“The element,” Howard stated simply. “I just can’t figure it out and Tony keeps growing and before I know it…” He’ll be grown up and then… He shook his head and murmured, “Forget about me, how are you? How is SHIELD doing?”
“Oh God, we are going to do this…This is going to suck ass,” Tony groaned. “I need a fucking coffee.”
“…And I love you,” Tony whispered the direct endearment to his soulmate for the first time. He reached out and squeezed Steve’s hand, smiling warmly at him. He felt like his love was practically oozing out of his pores. This man had so encompassed his very soul that he could barely live without him.
In their dream, he and Tony were lounging in Tony’s bedroom at the Tower, outside, however was an evergreen forest Steve had trekked through in France.
Wade nuzzled his face into Peter's hair and whispered, “I think so too.” Peter felt him press a kiss on top of his head and then lay his head on top of Peter's.
Steve spent his time with the crew, helping where he could whether it was untangling lines or peeling potatoes. The crew readily warmed up to him and, just like the American team, when they learned of his “amnesia” they were quick to talk to him about home or show him how things worked.
Jarvis stood sentry at the edge of the pool with its arms crossed over its chest. Something was off about the suit. Maybe it was the way Jarvis stood? It was very subdued compared to Tony’s usual cocky stance in the armor.
Tony sat up with a mighty groan as his back muscles protested the movement. A few bones popped and he rubbed his neck to soften some muscles. He murmured, “What kind of anomaly? End of the world anomaly? Or needs paperwork anomaly? Because if it’s paperwork then I am not here.”
A white bag with a grease stain and a logo he didn’t recognize sat on Wade’s other side. He could smell freshly cooked meat and southwestern spices coming from it.
The walls rose again except this time Tony was the one creating them, leaving Steve alone in a desolate wasteland. Steve gingerly sat himself up and lightly touched the cold wall. With a breaking heart, Steve leaned into the wall and gasped, “I’m sorry, Tony…”
Intense heat suddenly pooled from the man’s hands. It was so fast and so hot that Steve tried to scream but the sound dried in his throat. He felt his skin bubble, his flesh cooked and smelt like the bacon he ate for breakfast, he almost instantly went blind and he feared his eyes had dried out of their sockets, his mind became so befuddled that he did not know left from right, and, after only a few seconds of the man’s scorching touch, he heard a popping sound and his brain could not take anymore. He fell unconscious, leaving Steve vulnerable to the Mandarin and his plans.
Bruce’s expression wavered and he grasped his arm tightly. He whispered, “I’ll ask your doctors if we could move you to a wheelchair…but please…until I get back, just wait here. I will be right back!”
When Jarvis finally reconnected to the Tower, Tony nearly cried. When his AI informed him Pepper was almost there, Tony let out a noise that could arguably be similar to a sob though he’d never admit it.
Steve gulped and Tony froze. Steve cautiously ran his hand up the back of Tony’s spine and Tony pushed into his touch like a cat, curling his body into his hand. Steve’s hand eventually made its destination and he cupped the back of Tony’s head. Steve’s eyes drooped, becoming hooded as he stared at Tony’s lips. He whispered, “Tony?”
Tony’s head snapped over to look at him and his eyes grew comically wide. He gasped, “Oh my God, our anniversary?! We’ve been together for a
The Soldier glared at her as he considered her words and then slowly slipped his hand off his weapon. Natasha followed suit and brought her hands to her sides.
One of them placed a laptop on his desk and turned it toward him. Two excitedly gasped at the same time, “It’s him!”
“Use it only if you have to,” Bucky commanded. Stepan slipped from Natasha’s side and ran to his father. Bucky knelt and caught his son.
Steve handed it over as gently as possible, but Cable upturned the shirt and everything inside clunked it down next to the glove, making Steve flinch at the sound. He tossed Steve back his shirt and Steve untied it and put it back on.
Steve clenched his fists, maybe he really would punch Bucky. He felt a flush grow on his cheeks from his anger toward Bucky’s actions and his shame for letting it happen, even if it was for a fraction of a second. He and Tony were just getting back on track! His stomach clenched painfully as he imagined telling Tony about the stolen kiss. He would never keep such things from him but he hated that he had to hurt him again.
Iron Man leapt to his feet and hissed, “They shot Steve there too! I was convinced they had killed him! Could he survive?? Could he be healing??”
The Red Skull was standing behind more of his mercenaries. It didn’t matter. It wouldn’t protect him. James was an expert marksman. He raised his gun as Schmidt said, “One.”
By his reactions to the onlookers, Tony could tell Steve was worried. Did Steve not want people to know he was with a man…Or was it the fact that it was Tony that caused such reactions in him? Either way was not good.
Tony leveled a glare at his fellow Avenger and purposely stopped moving his leg to announce, “No, I'm not.”
Peter closed his eyes as another shudder of revulsion moved through him. He needed to stop this. He needed to regain control and help Wade. Breathing evenly, Peter gained control of his heartrate and tried to exude a peaceful feeling.
Iron Man must have been inside the building with the perpetrators because Steve saw no sign of him outside and Tony was stubbornly ignoring their hails.
He closed his eyes remembering his final moments with his soulmate and tried to engrave them into his memory…because who was he kidding?
Steve glanced at his wristwatch and replied, “A little before seven a.m.” They had another hour before the team met up for breakfast.
He came to Fury’s call and stood next to Coulson. His handler spared him a small, comforting smile before looking back to Fury. As soon as he was there Fury began his explanation of their mission and target.
He had helped found the organization with Peggy after the War but left after Maria became pregnant with Tony. His focus had been too cut between SHIELD, Stark Industries, and the work on Tony’s new element.
Peter retaliated by dragging his fingers over Wade’s chest until he hooked his hand on Wade’s neck. He asked with a sultry undertone, “Should I be?”
Tony whispered, “Very well...I need to prepare you.” Before Steve could question what he meant, Tony poured some of the liquid from the open bottle on his hand then plunged a finger inside Steve.
“I was drawn back to Venom too,” Eddie replied, his eyes glued to the beaker in front of Peter. Tendrils were swaying from its surface. Peter’s mind felt blank but he had assumed his subconscious was calling to the shield and making it move like that.
“That…would actually be awesome,” Wade gasped, probably more star struck by the idea of wearing Captain America’s clothes than disgusted by the shape his current attire was in.
Tony turned and found Bucky and Monty. They looked like they were going to step in but Bucky's inquiry stopped them.
Peggy politely cleared her throat and murmured, “Stand like that any longer and you might draw a few stares…”
Steve and the injured man stepped off the last of the rubble and reached ground-level. The man let out a relieved sigh and leaned into Steve. Steve waved over some medics, fearing the man might collapse at any moment.
Tony rubbed his face into Steve’s belly as his hands squeezed his ass and murmured, “You like me when I’m dirty.”
“For now, Shellhead,” Steve whispered dryly, squeezing his hand one last time before letting go. Tony smirked at the retort but pressed Steve into a full embrace and held his friend all the tighter. Steve returned the hold with a content sigh.
It felt therapeutic revealing all of the secrets he usually kept close to his heart. He obviously couldn’t talk with many people about the circumstances that led him to becoming Spider-Man. Not even his Aunt May knew about that part of his life.
Vision nodded curtly and then Wade’s entire body was jerked down under the force of Vision’s take off. He blinked a few times as he lost sight of Peter in the jerking surprise but he saw the cloud just as far from Wanda’s reach as they flew through the sky. Peter’s eyes were still blank with shock and Wade prayed to whatever unseen force that was watching all of this unfold that this wasn’t going to be the last expression he’d ever see on his boyfriend’s face.
Wade and Peter exchanged glances and Wade’s face suddenly split into a large grin. To Peter, he gasped, “Your parents totally set us up!”
The Red Skull cracked his neck as he stretched it and murmured, “It looks like we are going to have a
“You can’t go back in there. You cannot let him touch you again,” he hissed. He straightened and locked eyes with her.
Tony shrugged and said, “New priorities, new interests…the Avengers became more important than getting laid. But enough about me! So ‘us’…we’ll say we started two years ago. How should it start?”
“You alright, Stevie?” Bucky asked and pressed his hand to Steve's forehead. “You're flushed like you have a fever. I thought you couldn't get sick no more?”
He also didn’t feel like talking to his parents. Call it latent teenage angst or justifiable anger but he was still angry by what his father had done, even if it was to protect him. Internally, he knew he was overreacting and he’d berate himself later for his temper tantrum. But, at that moment, he knew he wasn’t going to go back out there. He wanted to be alone.
They clicked instantly. Tony turned on his charm and Steve saw right through it. They started off the day tentatively getting to know each other and ended it debating theology and cheating each other at poker. Steve was smart and engaging and Tony could not believe he was real. Not only was his childhood hero alive but he was also this
When the darkness was beginning to fade, Peter slowly settled back into himself and began to note the passage of time.
“Don’t you have her on video stealing the…’samples?’” Bruce inquired awkwardly, his eyes flickering over to Steve with a slight blush. “Can’t we use that to disprove her?”
It was foolish, stupid even, in the back of his mind he knew his master would get him in the end, but, his newly discovered heart was breaking out of its shell and screaming for a chance.
But I’m back and we’re going back to weekly updates again! No more out of state bachelorette parties for the foreseeable future!
They landed on the main balcony and Steve was there waiting for them. He went straight to Peter as soon as they landed and embraced him tightly as soon as he let go of Tony. Steve promised, “We’re here for you, Pete. Is there anything I can get you? Anything you want to talk about?”
cry. Cry like he should have after he saw Bucky fall or found out his own grisly fate. It all had built up and was finally being released. Maybe it was because he no longer had to be strong for Peggy...
“I am designated ‘Friday’ by Master Stark, sir,” the AI retorted. Before Wade could retort, it stated, “Peter is going down to the lower levels where his lab is.”
The smile vanished completely from her face and Steve knew he caught her in the lie. This wasn’t a recovery room and she was not with the army. He got to his feet and walked over to her, threateningly stating, “I’m going to ask you again. Where am I??”
“Did you get bigger?” Steve gasped. “I could have sworn you were this big last I saw you!” He held up his hand and cupped his fingers to replicate the size of a small hamster.
Tony had opened his mouth, likely ready to spout a speech on the merits of trusting him, but he sealed his mouth with a smile upon Steve’s question. Steve flushed as Tony grinned wider. He may have asked an unconventional question but the man had an unconventional glow coming out of his heart!
By the time Eddie got there, Peter had gone through most of the textbook and relived the class he took the year prior with a professor who kept calling him Peter Porker.
Mary stepped out from behind the lab counter so he could see her better and replied, “Yes, my master used your DNA and images and video of your mother to create me.”
Bucky nodded curtly and moved next to Peggy, probably to make sure to stop her if she tried to follow them.
After some food, two cups of coffee, and tensely keeping an eye on his boyfriend and father, Peter was feeling much more awake. A shadow of exhaustion still lingered in his muscles but he was able to ignore its presence with the help of caffeine.
Because his heart latched on to loving Tony and was unwilling to let go no matter what Steve’s brain argued.
Tony quirk up both eyebrows and gave him the overly exaggerated “I don’t believe you” look then said, “You were having a tough time before Peter. You just found out you have a kid
Steve dropped a towel to dry off with and spare clothes on the bed, an undershirt and boxers, and said, “I’ll come back in ten minutes. Is that enough time?”
“Just shut up and kiss me!” Peter demanded, grasping Wade’s collar and pulling him back down on him.
He turned back to Stark and saw the man’s eyes had narrowed slightly from seeing Wade lean into Peter. Wade happily replied, “Just enjoying the ambiance.”
Tony smirked as he grasped Steve’s hand and leaned into him. Steve frowned at him and Tony whispered, “My dad told me the story.”
Around him, the rest of the team sat in a tight circle around the table and all of them were equally and completely exhausted.
Only Monty was up and he was poking the fire back to life. He nodded to Steve and he waved back before dropping his rucksack and taking down his tent. It took him only a few minutes to tear down and roll up. He tossed it and his rucksack beside where Monty had tossed his own.
Pleasure was building within him and he grabbed Steve’s hands and put them on his hips. Steve’s thumbs hooked onto his hipbones and his fingers splayed and dug into the soft flesh of his behind. He pulled Tony in, impaling himself deeper and Tony’s entire body was jolted with ecstasy.
Eddie and Peter excitedly pulled the ‘goo’ out of the fridge. They both exchanged glances and Eddie asked the obvious, “Who’s going to test it first?”
His plans immediately returned to the boy. He had befriended Norman’s son and through Harry he learned of the boy’s intellect and his growing powers. The boy was his creation and thereby his son. He deserved to be by Norman’s side. After his years of research, Norman knew the boy could become stronger and would be a great ally. The boy had the strength but no bite…which led to the creation of Venom.
The projector behind Tony turned on and the canvas behind him became aglow with Steve’s picture. It must have been taken by one of Jarvis’s cameras. Steve sat at a counter with a coffee mug in hand and was smiling happily.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and decided it'd be best to work with one of the emotions he did know: anger. He grumbled, “Howard fucking knows who I am, so he might as well look at the reactor now and tell me what I already know. The future is clearly already fucked so what’s a little more fuckery?”
Tony looked reassured by his statement and nodded. Their eyes locked again and they stared wordlessly at each other. Steve was admiring his eyes and he couldn’t guess why Tony stared back.
Tony walked up to Steve’s side and roped his arm into the crook of Steve’s arm. He leaned heavily into Steve’s side and excitedly whispered, “We haven’t lost our boy yet!”
She got up from the table and left him alone in the kitchen. He dropped his head as sadness overwhelmed him.
When the doors opened, Peter cautiously stepped out into the dark corridor and walked over to the sealed door of his
"Natasha is coming by with a schedule of events for me," Steve said, still acting like nothing was wrong...
Peter planned to spend the rest of the morning lazing around in bed with his boyfriend yet the cigar smell grew in strength as the time ticked by. He was going to have to close the window or Wade’s room would stink of it soon.
The movement woke Wade and he sleepily hummed and readjusted his limbs around Peter into a more comfortable position. He murmured, “Good morning, baby boy.”
Peter eventually began to feel a little dizzy. He easily rationalized it was probably because he hadn’t drunk any water in a while but had been sampling a lot of the sugary treats found around the room. He leaned against the bar and asked Natasha, “Can I get a glass of water?”
“Steve!” Tony hissed, the sound of the shield breaking the glass broke him out of his shock. He moved with Steve as he fell and worriedly touched him. “
Tony closed his eyes and then slowly breathed in and out. With his eyes still pinched closed, he whispered...
The time traveler remained sleeping but his expression was pinched as if he were having a bad dream. Bucky sighed like Steve had but did as Steve wanted and stood at watch, keeping an eye on Tony. Usually, he had the entire horizon when he had watch duty so he felt extremely confined to be focused on just one prone man. He grew bored quickly and felt a little weird staring at Steve’s fella so. His gaze began to shift around the tent and he wondered if Howard willfully choose the design on his ugly suitcases.
“Then we better get a move on before the Martians attack,” Bucky retorted, swatting Steve like a horse to move quicker.
All he knew was that Tony had a home in Malibu, California overlooking the ocean. If need be, Steve would run to the west and search all of the coastal homes until he found him.
So as Steve was settling in, Tony gave him his space and ignored all the outside calls, notifications, and emails. He simply went to work in his lab and ignored the clamoring from the world.
To his relief, he quickly discovered that the majority of the streets still had the same names and he was able to tell he was close to Coney Island.
A man who must have been the priest was dusting the banisters and Steve cleared his throat to announce his presence. When the man turned around, Steve said, “Father…I need help.”
But then the Avengers were called to assemble when Loki of Asgard started to threaten the planet with invasion.
After he was picked up from the Tower, Steve had spent the rest of the day in debriefs learning what SHIELD knew about the Mandarin and, sadly, it was not much…But they knew the Mandarin’s operation was in the United States and, based upon increased weapons traffic, had narrowed him to being somewhere in the eastern side of the country. The President was in country’s capitol so it was a unanimous decision that he move elsewhere.
Steve jumped at the chance to explore the groves and textures of Tony’s face. While cupping his face, he rubbed his fingers repeatedly over the skin and felt his heart beat quickly beneath the skin. Tony closed his eyes and shuddered as Steve ran his fingers through his hair. Steve froze, shocked by the shudder, and Tony whispered, “No, no don’t stop. That felt
They left together, priming for the fight by trading insults back and forth in English and Russian. Steve watched it all with a smile. Maybe they did not have to try so hard to get those two together…
He ran his thumb over the contours of Pops’ dog-tag and thought back to the moment he had lost it. Peter never thought he would see it again yet it had found its way back into his possession.
“And it's because of that I think I'm the luckiest Wade Wilson in the Multi-verse,” Wade jokingly stated, with only a slight tremble to his voice.
He found the knot and pulled it out. The tight bandages unraveled easily once they were no longer taunt and Tony’s light was revealed. Steve stared at the light blue glow in wonder and carefully touched the glass. The reactor vibrated lightly beneath his touch.
Hundreds of photos were taken that day but a single photo stood out among them all and would become one of the most iconic photos of the year.
He tightened his fists as he watched the past Tony give away the nano-suit and the past Steve give away his shield, leaving themselves defenseless.
They settled in the back, right next to each other, of course, and Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s shoulders. Happy closed the door as Tony leaned into him and replied, “I haven’t even gotten to the over-the-top clichés yet…or are you Steve’s evil twin brother seeing me romantically out of revenge against your twin?!”
Steve snorted and took Peter into his arms. Peter smiled up at him, his mouth speckled with a couple of teeth, and Steve smiled warmly back.
Steve rolled his eyes but, when his eyes landed back onto Tony’s, his eyes sparkled like the ocean on a sunny day. Steve whispered, “Then I will just have to make you happier than you are now every day.”
Tony was pulling at his shirt and Bucky could make out broken bits of smoke escaping from his struggles.
“Just do what comes naturally,” Wade murmured, wrapping his arms around Peter’s neck. “Foreplay should be pretty similar and the fingering will just be in a different hole!”
“I think I can handle it,” Steve replied with a smirk, thinking of all the miles he trekked in Europe.
“And we have to go over what is acceptable behavior in public and what you can and cannot do to Steve. I don’t want you to scar him for life,” Pepper stated picking up a handful of documents.
Tony was slow to react. His mind was still reeling from what he just learned and he didn’t want to let go of Steve. The super soldier made no move to let go of him either.
Wade stopped and touched the spot on his cheek where he kissed him. He gasped, “Of all the lines, that one actually works?!”
Tony rounded the building, rising in the air as he did. On his screen, Jarvis projected the shield’s location on Tony’s screen with a red single dot and Tony murmured, “Zoom in.”
Peter leaned back into his chair and stared at Rogers for a moment. He stated, “I don’t trust you. I don’t trust America’s Poster Boy.”
“…I can’t take much more of this,” Steve whispered, without lifting his head. “I thought faking a relationship was going to be hard but faking our history –
Steve felt all the blood in his body rush to his face and he exclaimed, “NO!” Natasha muffled a chuckle and Steve gasped, “Why would you think that??”
Natasha tapped on the barstool between Tony and her, indicating that was where Wade should sit. He did so, but moved slowly as if he was wary of an attack. Natasha pushed the bowl of chips toward him and stated, “Eat, you must be hungry after pleasuring Spidey all night.”
The reporter did not do as Steve asked and persisted, “So are you denying that you are gay? You never made an official statement, only Tony Stark did. Are you trying to say Mr. Stark’s statement and those photos of you and Tony Stark are falsified??”
“Okay, Steve, that just flipped off my sarcasm switch,” Tony stated seriously. He leaned over Steve, touching the right side of his face where he was not too badly burned. “Honey, what’s wrong? Please don’t be dying. You are not allowed to do so without my permission. So if you are dying, stop it. Stop it right now!”
Steve sputtered and blushed deeply as his fantasies ran wild. Truth be told, he wanted both. Whenever he masturbated it was done imagining thrusting into another but he also imagined the sensation of being taken in turn.
His lips twitched into a small smile. Peggy smiled too and lightly rubbed his arms. She whispered, “Go to him. That tough kid from Brooklyn shouldn’t be so scared of this Manhattan wannabe.”
The fact that Peter did not heal like him was at the forefront of his mind and adding to the kindling of his growing hysteria.
“Yes…” Peter answered slowly as he turned away from the door. They knew about his aunt. They must have known everything about him. SHEILD probably had an entire file on him by now. He did not know if he should feel proud or scared.
“Wha –?” Tony began to ask and pushed at Steve’s chest. Steve pulled him tightly back into his arms and looked down at the man meaningfully and tapped his own chest where the arc reactor would be in Tony’s chest. Tony’s eyes widened in understanding and he began to pull the blankets toward his chest. Steve loosened his hold on him to let him pull the blankets up and he fully let go of him once he was satisfied Bucky wouldn’t see anything.
So on he moved through ice, snow, and the bitterly cold wind. A fine layer of ice covered his entire body, freezing every piece of him that was not moving into one position. The muscles in his legs creaked with protest, wanting to freeze up too but Steve would not stop. Stopping meant giving up and giving up meant freezing to death.
Eddie’s files were right next to his and his friend left whatever chemical concoction he was working on to return to grab his files. Peter continued to look over his reports even though he knew exactly what he was supposed to be working on. He was too mortified to move and their whispers felt like they were crawling over his skin. What did he expect would happen? Did he think everyone would not notice the news coverage? Or the reporters surrounding the building, throwing questions at them about Peter as they came into work?
Peter bit down on his lip and Wade’s smile got a fraction smaller. He breathlessly asked, “Baby boy?”
The medical examiner stared at the photo with wide eyes and stuttered, “I-It was what was given to me – I didn’t realize – the uniform –.”
“STOP IT!” He screamed but they were not fast enough. The mass swung the pole at the wires overhead and sliced right through them. The sound of the shrill alarm deceased greatly as most of the speakers lost power or connection to the main computer.
“It’s more than good, it's a way of life,” Wade countered and grabbed his own piece. He didn't take off his gloves like Peter had but he did shove up his mask in order to take a big bite.
When their lips separated, Wade licked his lips, sampling the pure shower water and Peter’s tastier saliva.
She held it out to him in offering and explained her odd measuring by saying, “This is Asgardian liquor. Thor gave it to me, it’s the strongest stuff I’ve ever had.”
The familiar, teasing voice brought a smile to his face and he lifted his gaze to see Peggy leaning in his doorway.
Tony was sitting in the corner of the linen closet with his arms wrapped around his knees. He was crying and his eyes were red as if he'd been doing so for a while.
He was alone in his lab and on the couch. Tony sat up and grinned down at his nude body and the blanket draped modestly over his hips. He knew for a fact that it was not there before.
When Peter came to, he was bound with bent and broken steel beams and couldn’t move an inch. They were in an empty warehouse and it was bitterly cold.
“He will break you, just like he did me,” James gasped, the words sounded like he could barely tolerate the thought.
Tony reached out to Steve and he tightly grasped Tony’s hand. Bucky rounded Tony and stood next to Howard, ready to jump on Tony if needed.
He followed Bucky to where Bruce, Scott, and Hope Pym were already setting up in a spot cleared of rubble, using Scott's old van and the scavenable pieces of the time machine Tony had built.
Venom shrieked again at the inquisitive thought. That form of thinking belonged to his host’s past life. Venom did not think beyond its needs. Venom only had to be in the now. And, right now, Venom had to quench his hunger – with the exception of blue-eyed humans, those would upset his stomach…
The last was posted by a famous Youtube personality that researched and gossiped about celebrities. The video was titled “Who is Peter Parker?” It was over twenty minutes long, an eternity in Youtube, but it already had over a million hits.
Her tone changed instantly as she spoke of Peter and worriedly murmured, “He’s still in his room…Breakfast will be ready in five more minutes. Please, bring him down.”
“He will be with you momentarily, Sir,” Jarvis replied and Tony bounced on the balls of his feet with impatience.
Steve lightly ran his thumb over Tony’s cheek and tried to smile the best he could. He stepped away from Tony and he instantly felt unsteady without him at his side. He only walked a few steps away before having to look over his shoulder to see Tony. Maybe he had just never noticed it before, they had led the team together and were best friends, and so they were always close. So, although they had only “really” been together for a little over a week, Steve had already found Tony to be an essential part of his life.
Eddie nodded and then hugged Peter tightly. Peter was a little taken aback and he murmured, “Eddie?”
“I am going to tear you to pieces in front of your son,” the Goblin swore. “And make your husband watch as I eat your remains.”
Steve’s blood broiled but he did not rise to bite the obvious tether the taunt was attached to. Bucky was with Tony. His soulmate and friends could help him now. Instead, he hissed, “What do you want, Schmidt?”
James bit down on his lip and drew blood. The hot metallic taste of it ran thickly over his tongue. The tremors grew worse and Steve held him tighter. He whispered into James’s ear, “I’ve got you, Buck.
Steve went to push himself away from the approaching figure but his legs collapsed underneath him and pain shot up his limbs. Steve looked down to see blood flowing from more gunshots to his shins. The General must have hit him when he jumped away and the vast amounts of adrenaline pumping through his system had blocked the pain.
“What’s going through your mind, baby boy?” Wade moaned. He reached down and ran a thumb over Peter’s lips.
Tony slumped in defeat and frowned as he said, “New rule: we are not allowed to die on each other without the other’s permission. Agreed?”
With shaking hands, Tony unwrapped the sealed folder and looked inside. The missing pages of his father’s journal were there and a note in Peggy’s handwriting.
Steve pulled the thin sheet over both of them and fretted over Tony until he was satisfied he was fine.
When the audience was seated, they continued to buzz excitedly among one another and were pulling out their cell phones to take video or pictures of them.
Tony wasn’t certain how he was going to react to the darkness in the coming days, but he knew he was going to wake up with Steve at his side and a kiss on his lips.
Tony twisted beneath him, keeping their lips connected, as he turned his body to toward Steve. He pushed himself into Steve and Steve took it as an invitation to continue.
“Bucky…” Steve whispered. He wanted to comfort him. He wanted to reveal how much he cared for him. Yet the words were stifled in his throat. An image of Tony flashed through his mind and Steve clutched his thighs just as tightly as Bucky was doing to his own. He whispered, “He’s good to me, Bucky. I love him…”
Still moving with the music and pressed into each other, Steve and Tony undid each others pants. Both garments sagged but did not fall off so Tony dragged himself down Steve’s body, taking his boyfriend’s jeans with him. Steve kicked the pants away and as Tony crawled up his body, he stepped out of his as well. He dragged his hands up Steve’s inner thighs and came within inches of touching his balls before he bypassed his entire waist and ran his hands up Steve’s torso instead.
stole his reactor, the very man he sent Pepper after hours earlier. He pulled himself up with Rhodey’s help and grunted, “Where’s Pepper?”
Steve dropped his shield, pushed the women aside, and then went to help Peter in tearing the dark substance off him.
Steve turned off the burner and divided the scrambled eggs onto two plates. He avoided Tony’s observation and answered his second question, “I hope we are going to be productive today. You have a deadline on that reactor, don’t you?”
“Can I get shirts of all the Avengers??” Peter asked excitedly, clutching the hulk shirts to his chest.
The boy excitedly chatted with Steve about the Avengers and asked him about being Captain America. Steve humored the boy and answered all his questions. In the back of his mind, he worried about Bucky and hopped he would not attack him in front of this boy. He knew if he went out in public he would be recognized and approached. It was a risk and he hoped it would not be one he regretted.
She cut him off with the press of her lips and slid her body against his. His mouth was still open from almost saying her name when her tongue slid into his mouth. He groaned and his heart was thudding so strongly he knew Natasha had to feel it too. He ran his fingers through her hair and tasted her tongue and mouth. He tasted Natasha’s essence and knew nothing could taste as good as her.
Tony looked back up to the Captain and peered at the relaxed face. When he wakes, the world was going to change with the reemergence of the super soldier.
Also I added an extra scene in chapter one a few days after posting. So if you didn't see it, it's in the end note, it is Bucky and Natasha's confrontation seen from Bucky's POV so now you can see what was said in Russian! :)
Steve walked down the once familiar halls, seeing the ghosts of their past in every shadow and around every turn. He had kissed Tony in that alcove...had marveled watching Iron Man fly out that window...and had laughed with Bucky and the other Comandos tracing the same steps he and Sam followed.
Tony instantly felt like a douche and turned to his husband with broken expression. He sat beside Steve and grasped his hands, whispering, “
Peter seemed to be the only good thing in his life. His son was gaining weight and was starting to eat yogurt with fruit chunks in it. Peter was going to therapy and sorting what happened out but he seemed to take more comfort in talking to Bruce. Bruce made no complaint about not being a therapist like he had done with Tony years prior. The doctor listened to Peter and drew him out of his shell. It was a vast improvement since Peter had refused to speak in the period between Steve’s death and a week after the funeral.
Rogers was also completely naked and Tony whistled as he took in the fine specimen. He turned to Bruce and said, “I likey.”
feel surreal. As a kid, like everyone else my age, I had imagined joining the Avengers and now I’m living with them. Sometimes it feels like I am in a dream. Especially if Vision suddenly phases through a wall or Steve lifts a large piece of furniture without any effort. But, at the same time, they’re my family. I love them and being with them doesn’t feel surreal…until Bruce Hulks out.”
The Avengers filled in solemnly, followed by Bucky, then lastly by the Parkers. A tired looking Peter was in May’s arms and his eyes instantly focused on Steve. He stared at Steve blankly as if he did not recognize him. His tiny hands played with the dog-tag attached to his wrist.
“Steve,” Tony gasped, turning his head to Steve and Steve released his hold on Tony’s hip to grasp the corner of his jaw and draw him into a kiss. He tried to put all of his feelings into it, showing Tony how much he loved this, how much he loved being with him…how much he loved him.
“All the scans are coming back as normal,” Bruce murmured as he looked over the papers. “Other than his needle prick healing after I drew blood I would say nothing is out of the ordinary…” Bruce lowered the papers and peered speculatively at Peter. “We must have never noticed it before because the needle pricks are so small…”
He knew his family was going to be fine. The Avengers always won in the end. At that moment, his mother was in the same tower as he was and Peter was not going to overlook this opportunity to meet her.
The AI didn’t reply and Tony’s heart seized worriedly. After a few tense moments, the systems began to reboot and Tony could relax.
That was where the similarities ended. He was not as relaxed as he would have been in his youth and Steve could make out concealed weapons on his person. His longer hair, shielded his gaze so Steve could not make out his entire face. He wore a dirty jacket and leather gloves. His metal arm was entirely hidden except for the tiny space where his wrist was exposed, anyone could have mistaken it for a watch.
Steve smiled at his question coupled with his eyes being big and round behind those lenses he could not help it. He replied, “No, you are doing great…I haven’t had a chance to thank you yet, so thank you for doing this.”
“I wasn’t going to walk around the apartment naked when half of New York can look in,” Steve replied with an eye roll. He held up the comforter and said, “And it was cold so I got us some more layers.”
“Steve, sorry,” Bucky gasped. “I-I’ve never woken with someone in my bed. I thought you were an enemy.”
Fingering the tightly threaded ribbons, Steve asked Phil, “Why give me the ribbons? They will tell people I served in World War II. It’ll help them figure out who I am faster. Isn’t that what you didn’t want?”
“And we got another Avenger heading over, he’ll be here within the hour,” Natasha added, peeking out of the front window.
The reminiscing did nothing to make the ache in his chest go away nor get rid of the acidic taste in his mouth created by his fear for Steve.
It was hot out, even with the sun setting. Peter had dressed in his everyday clothes of a baggy shirt and jeans. He also wore large aviator sunglasses to help hide his face. As he slipped on the glasses, he morbidly wished his identity had been discovered in the winter. He’d have been able to cover his face without sweltering or looking odd. No one was in their general area so Peter relaxed a fraction.
A better home indeed and it wasn’t because of the reactor that powered it now. Ever since Steve moved in, Tony's life was just...better. When Steve was gone, Tony never before felt so lonely but, upon his reappearance, he felt at peace.
you.” Tony surged forward and kissed him again. This time Tony’s tongue slipped into his mouth and drew a line on the roof of his mouth, leading Steve toward his mouth and beckoning Steve closer.
“Romanoff made a deal with the Winter Soldier. She promised him two weeks of freedom to tell us the location of the Captain. He’ll most likely use the time to disappear,” Coulson replied.
“Sorry, your honor, but this dress should have never been put into evidence.” He held the photo out to the medical examiner and asked, “This was the dress Susan Tyler claimed to have been raped in while she was cleaning Captain Rogers’ room?”
“All rise,” the bailiff announced, signaling to the court that the judge was entering. Tony let go of his shoulder as they both got to their feet.
“We can continue this later…” Steve whispered in his ear. “I need to get some clothes and then we should find Peter.”
Steve’s jaw dropped slightly and his heart did an odd flip in his chest, as he did not know if he should feel elated or horrified by Tony’s proclamation.
Steve couldn’t help but snort. Time travel made him a little loopy. Especially since the arc reactor was one of the most amazing pieces of technology he’d ever seen…moreso since…since it had kept Tony alive and Cable was calling it
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Steve whispered, gratitude seeped into the words but not his posture. He was tense, unable to accept the analogy.
“What is that?” Steve gasped, staring up at the giant rabbit sitting next to the couch in the community room. It was so large that its head nearly hit the ceiling. It had a dog collar around its neck and on the tag it said, “Happy Birthday!”
“If you are my soulmate, why did you attack me?” He whispered as his eyes peered deeply into hers. His gaze was so intense with its scrutiny that she was highly tempted to break her eyes away but she held strong.
“No, sir,” Jarvis replied. “There are several ‘Steven Edwards’ on file but none of them match up with the ‘Enigma’ that you have been interacting with.”
Peter put away his phone and ran over to them. He excitedly gasped, “Hey guys! When did you two get back?”
Tony nodded and backed off though he still regarded Steve warily and did not take his eyes off him as he rounded the counter to the coffee. Steve sat up with a heavy sigh and rubbed his face. He rubbed particularly at his eyes…
Tony hit the back of his head a second time on the car hood when a sudden explosion jolted him upright.
Jarvis registered the slight jolt and entered it into archives but he did not inform his master because the earth was always moving and if he told him of every shift Tony would have no life.
“Puny God,” Hulk growled, spit began to foam at the corners of his mouth. “Puny God take Hulk brother. Puny God bully Hulk family.”
“God, Steve…I am more than fine. You – You’re here!” Tony embraced him again and then repeated more hoarsely, “You’re alive.”
“Hey, I’m just preaching the truth! They really might do that! It’ll really depend on how you introduce him to them.”
And if it did work? Tony’s heart twisted in his chest until it was wound into a compressed lump of muscle. He would wish that fate on no one, nonetheless
“I am not in the Science Division and I was not actively looking for a dead man,” she retorted dryly. “Listen, Coulson, all I can tell you is that he kept to himself and was uninteresting until he leapt off the ship and was never heard from again. I can give his last known location at least but his mental state…I can’t help you.”
“I only contacted you because I needed to get out of that Tower. It had nothing to do with you or me. It’s all about Tony and my wanting to block out the pain of losing him,” Steve hissed, clenching his fists. He could feel the tears forming again but ignored it. His voice was husky as he stated, “I was not thinking about you and me. I just wanted what we had before…This is why I am selfish, Bucky. I was not thinking about your feelings, only mine. I’m a selfish bastard and you should—.”
“J-!” Tony squeaked, his emotions threatened to overcome him as relief that Steve was maybe still alive and worry about what was
They finally broke apart to gasp for breath but Tony still sprinkled kisses over Steve's face between gasps and his beloved did the same back to him.
Steve's smile widened for the cameras as his real smile shone through. He whispered into Tony's ear, "That was me foolishly getting lost in the moment as I shared my first kiss with my soulmate."
His dad looked like he didn’t want to leave but he nodded and repeated, “Alright…Alright, well, we’ll be right outside.”
“Yes to all of those,” Tony replied easily. He didn’t even have to think it over. He wanted all of those things with Steve too.
“Oh,” Tony whispered involuntary. That was why Steve looked uneasy. He wanted hope. Tony’s stomach twisted at the thought. He could give it but Steve would never get to experience it… Tony cleared his throat and then murmured, “Yeah, in my era, everyone is cool with it. It’s considered discriminatory to hate on people just because they’re gay…Gay marriage just became legalized in California and New York is talking about doing the same right now.”
The Tesseract had transported him back to the base where it was last housed. The base had since then been destroyed.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and said, “I ran after Bucky and caught up to him in an alleyway. He said my name…I thought he was remembering so I let him get close and he attacked me…” Steve bit down on his lip and looked down guiltily. “Bucky had moved me after I lost consciousness. When I came to he told me what little he remembered…” Steve left off with a frown. Craving intermingled with his remorse as he remembered what happened next. His shame grew upon the feeling.
Bucky had been trying to get Steve to go on a double date with him. The lady he was with, had a friend who was looking for a guy for them to double date with. Steve usually said no but Bucky pushed. His other girl lost her soulmate. She was zeroed like them. Steve could really start something with her.
And well, one thing led to another and Wade’s lips still tingled from their numerous kisses and he was going to be meeting his parents tonight as Peter’s actual-not-fantasied boyfriend.
"You contacted him first, he reciprocated this morning, and now it's your turn to reach out again," Steve stated.
Wade seemed a little taken aback and his face twitched a few times like he had a hard time settling on a feature. Finally, the big guy shyly grinned and murmured, “Okay, Sta – T-Tony.”
“That luck of ours brought us together, despite everything. You have me for life, Steve,” Tony whispered in a promise.
He opened his rucksack and pulled a smaller beige bag out of it and tossed it to Tony. Items clinked inside when he caught it and Tony wordlessly unknotted the bag and looked inside.
She reflected back to the moment they had met. James was the one who had called for a truce and held his hand out to her. She kept her hand outstretched to him and whispered, “When we first met, you told me that you never wanted something until you met me…I never told you, but the only thing I had ever wanted –
The communicator in Steve's ear repeated the frantic message as did the rest of the team’s communicators miles away. The Avengers would be with them soon.
Steve dropped his gaze with a flush as he remembered the prior night. He was an emotional wreck but Bucky did not take advantage of him though he had clearly wanted to…
Bucky cautiously closed the distance between and reached out to touch Steve. Steve did not move, not wanting to scare his addled friend. Bucky’s hand hovered at the side of his face as if to cup his cheek.
Steve snorted and whispered, “I’m going to be hearing Back to the Future quotes for the rest of my life, aren’t I?”
Only once Tony closed the door behind them, did Peter launch himself at his father and give him a big hug. In the embrace, he murmured, “Congratulations, Dad.”
Needless to say, Steve was already feeling like crap already with the impending trial, the resulting hate mail, the insinuations brought up by the media, and, most importantly, by the very fact that someone would actually
Steve felt like he could barely breathe. A wall was growing between him and his best friend and Steve desperately wanted to stop it. But if Steve did that, it meant embracing something he was not ready for. How could Tony ask this of him? With clenched fists, Steve stated with a shaking voice, “This is me. This is my identity.”
“So you don’t need any help examining the remains of the robot?” Tony implored as he picked up one of his Iron Man gauntlets off the lab table.
Coulson’s heart rose to his throat and for a moment he feared he would not be able to reply. He swallowed thickly and adjusted his grip on the phone as he stated, “Good. Forward me and the retrieval team the coordinates immediately.”
Tony's favorite study appeared with a leather couch with plush cushions and Tony lowered himself onto the couch with a groan. Steve sat beside him and grasped his hand as Tony told him everything he had learned.
“He is going to be so proud of you…more so when he’s older and understands,” Tony murmured the last half. “But he is going to be watching with Ben and May. He’s with us in spirit.”
Steve glanced over to Tony who was standing awkwardly on the other side of the room. He rolled his eyes and pointed to the bedroom. He went into Steve’s room to give them some privacy. Steve sighed lightly. This was not what he imagined to be doing at this point in the day.
He broke into a dark building and an alarm immediately went off. He found the alarm box easily enough and punched it out to silence it. The authorities would be alerted but he doubted anyone would check on it anytime soon with the raging inferno several hundred yards away. It was a warehouse filled with dusty, unwanted files and items from another era. Most of this stuff probably hadn’t been used since Howard Stark was still alive.
Bruce must have leapt after him and transformed mid-fall because, as he landed, the ground shook behind him and Hulk roared. Thor had been following the quinjet and he blast forward when he saw the rest of them taking up the charge.
“Alright,” Peter replied, smiling widely. Mostly, he was smiling about the fact that Harold didn’t seem to recognize him.
Steve flushed and Pepper muttered under her breath, “Thank God, they’re finally acting like a couple.”
Steve returned to Wade and clasped his shoulder. He earnestly stated, “You’re welcome to come by any time.”
“Ste-Steve,” Tony gurgled. Blood bubbled from his mouth upon his next ragged exhale. He grasped Steve’s hand tightly. His hand was trembling and moist with his own blood. He tipped his head with a shuddering cry and whimpered, “It h-hurts!
Bucky sighed heavily then left. By the way he hunched his shoulders, Steve could tell he was going to be thinking about this all night.
Tony may have not been Peter’s godfather but he certainly was more than an uncle, the man was like a second father to Peter.
Natasha pushed herself to her feet but froze as soon as James cocked his gun and pointed it at her head.
“J, did Steve get any messages, like Clint’s, on his phone or email?” Tony demanded, thinking along the same lines as Steve as soon as he read the ominous lines. Had someone kidnapped one of the surviving Commandoes or Peggy?
The car ride back was aggravating. Steve kept expecting Tony to reach out and grab his hand again but the other man never did. Steve, meanwhile, had been a force of adrenaline. He always dreamed of being touched by Tony and now he had the chance…but nothing was happening.
“Did you check the lab for clues?” Peter interjected. Steve and Tony glanced through the holograms to his son. Peter was sitting on the end of the couch, kicking his feet lightly against the bottom of the couch. Peter explained, “It’s how they do it on Scooby-Doo.”
of doing this…” Tony met his eyes and pointedly told him, “Steve, you are good and anyone who says differently is an absolute liar.”
“And I guess no introductions are needed for Eyepatch,” Tony mumbled, nodding to the SHIELD Director still standing at the top of the stairs lording above them all.
Tony nuzzled his face into Steve’s chest, rested his cheek against his heart, and he felt it beat lightly beneath Steve’s skin. Tony hummed in approval and the sound vibrated into Steve’s flesh.
“Help him,” the Soldier whispered. He was looking down at Steve with eyes glassy with a flurry of emotions.
Instead, Steve shifted in his arms and grumbled, "I literally just changed that back an hour ago..."
The monster circled them until he was behind James. He commanded, “Look at her and tell her the truth. Tell her she was a distraction.”
Why she held onto it, she could not say. She blamed the reasonless emotions programed into her because, whenever she touched the objected loved unconditionally by Peter, she felt better…
Steve’s heart leapt into his throat and he leaned in closer. He gripped his hands tightly together and breathed shallowly to better listen. It was the truth but they had little evidence to back it other than his word. Marcel had to make this 100% plausible for the jury to believe him.
Steve raised his shield just in time to absorb the blast but went flying across the room. He hit the walling hard enough to make it crumple but thankfully did not break it. Steve did not give himself a moment to feel any pain and jumped up just as the Iron Patriot stepped over him. He punched Steve back down and the floor buckled beneath him. Steve slammed his shield into Rhodes’s gut and the man went flying back.
Steve snorted and rolled his eyes. He tickled the little guy’s knees and asked, “Was that a song about your knees?”
Eddie put his hand on the stopcock of the burette and whispered humbly, “If this works, we’ll have enough to make the bio-shield and then we can start the test sessions.”
He sat up slowly as he remembered his target…Natasha, sitting with him and holding him through the night. She left him when he regained composure but her leaving left his chest feeling hollow in ways he never thought possible.
“’Fine’ is not how I would categorize it…” Tony grumbled. He tightened his hold on Steve’s hand and he bit down on his lip before stating, “Everyone is here. We want to help you…”
Even with none of them guessing the right time, Tony decided to award the win to the absentee Bruce (who obviously could not handle big crowds or reporters) and the rest of them agreed.
Wade laughed from his unbridled joy, just once because tears were forming in his eyes and if kept his mouth open he start to ugly sob and no one wanted to see that. Peter was alive. He hadn't killed him. Wade pressed his forehead to Peter’s and whispered, “Love you.”
SHIELD used both Oscorp and Stark Industries as they were rebuilding. He had been under the impression that his company would merge with the spy organization and he would be heading its new weapons division. But SHIELD changed its mind. They said Norman was too unstable and his ideas were too radical. They dropped him and his company. As soon as the rest of the world heard SHIELD was no longer interested in Oscorp, the share prices in his company dropped significantly.
“Crawl over to me on your hands and knees and kiss my boot and I will command my solider to remove the syringe,” the Red Skull stated haughtily.
Tony stopped but kept Steve in his embrace and smiled warmly at him. Steve wrapped a single arm around his shoulders, unable to be annoyed with the man, and turned back to the others. He asked his friends, “So what have we missed?”
Originally, Tony had cut Peter out of his life before he had been born. He did not seek him out until he was nineteen. He wasn’t there for his son as he grew up and when lost too many members of his family. He practically ignored the boy and he couldn’t even imagine the enormous list of wrongs he had done to his parents, Mary especially… There had been a lot Peter had to forgive him for, for Peter to even speak with Tony…but forgive he did and now he wanted Tony to do the same for Wade? A mercenary? A madman and a killer? What if Wade turned on Peter? Would Tony ever be able to forgive himself if that happened?
“Jarvis we are no longer friends!” Peter yelled then let himself drop another ten stories. He caught himself again. His heart was still hammering against his chest at its fast pace but he no longer had problems catching his breath, in fact, moving so fast was exhilarating.
“Can wait! We're not going to cater to their every whim! So, if you don't mind, I want to get some alone time with my husband right now!”
Tony snorted into his coffee and Bucky just threw back his head and laughed heartily. It was a normal laugh to Steve but the other two froze like it was a miracle.
imagined himself in this situation. It was reckless to even consider it. He was torn, wanting to be with Steve and wanting to protect the future as well.
His soulmate was still a baby. The undefined world clearly reflected a mind unable to grasp more than the basics to life. So Steve wiped away his tears and whispered, “Shhhh, it's alright. I'm here. I promise I'll stay with you as long as I am able. I will be there for you. Please, don't cry. I’m here. You're not alone…”
The audience cheered excitedly and then Tony leaned forward with his million-dollar smile and replied, “I think you’re right!”
“You know I was kidnapped by terrorists and it was when I created the first Iron Man suit,” Tony gasped against his shoulder. Peter shifted to escape Tony’s hold but Tony tightened his arms around him. Peter could have easily escaped, he must have been ten-times stronger than Tony, but instead he slumped into his hold and listened to him.
“Everything is going according to schedule,” Steve reassured him, pressing down on Tony's shoulder to keep him jumping out of bed. Steve continued, “Pepper is keeping an eye on everything and is getting the communal room ready as we speak. She got our wedding handled in less than 48 hours. She had even more time for Peter's birthday.”
Steve looked from Natasha to James and a wary expression came over his face. He looked down and whispered to himself, “Is this real?”
She had told him that she had framed her favorite photo from the wedding and was sending it over to them. It didn’t even cross his mind it would be
They piled all the food Tony provided onto their plates like they were at a buffet then sat at the breakfast table next to the window overlooking the city.
“He reminded me I left my oven on, now, if you’ll excuse me…” Tony turned on Sneaky’s stealth capabilities and seemingly vanished in front of the agents. He was about to step away, but he turned back to the agents and said, “By the way, if the priest isn’t being placed under arrest you should let him go. It’d be even more bad publicity for SHIELD if the public found out you were mistreating one of the clergy like that…Especially if it isn’t done within the hour. Goodnight!”
Bucky stuttered shocked noises in response and Steve laughed. His eyes were as warm as his voice and it made Tony’s heart palpitate ridiculously.
Tony was laying on the floor, visibly shaking. Steve needed no other reason to rush past Cable and to Tony’s side.
The rail he was holding on to broke off and his body fell so fast that Bucky’s mind had only realized what had happened seconds from the ground. His scream of disbelief was cut off by the violent impact of his body slamming into the ground.
The oh too familiar bright lights surround him and his hand reached to his side unconsciously feeling for Tony’s hand. When he met nothing but air, he bitterly shut it and dropped his head as they were whisked away to the past.
Initially, when they had to decide where they were going to send Peter to kindergarten they suddenly found they had a choice.
-tastic,” Peter grumbled. “I revealed my identity to two strangers, one of those strangers claimed to be my father, my aunt revealed he was indeed my father….so basically everything I knew about my life has been pretty much a lie. Like I said, fan-
Steve heard the click of the elevator doors opening and Tony bound into him and shoved Steve backward. He hurriedly backed up until Tony pushed him into the open closet and closed the door. Steve stumbled back into the coats and clutched his shield close to his chest as he righted his balance.
He let go of Steve’s hand and started to walk back to the camp. Steve followed after a few seconds and the super soldier asked, “What do you mean?”
not healthy, Tony,” Steve groaned. He let his head fall back on the couch and he wondered what other unhealthy things Tony had been doing and how long he had been doing them.
“You always overthink things,” Steve murmured. He lifted his face from the flesh of Tony’s neck and lay his head on his shoulder as he rolled his eyes.
Tony jerked like Steve had shocked him and had even yelled out in pain when the reactor connected, scaring Steve. His entire body trembled but he grasped Steve’s pants with a tight grip and his glassy eyes focused on him.
Eddie didn’t reply so Peter assumed he was already in snooze town. He silently backed out of the room and then closed the door gently behind him.
The elevator doors opened and Tony tore his eyes from the bar in time to see T’Challa arrive. The team called out greetings and he nodded to them in turn. T’Challa called out to Peter as he walked over to him and Peter stepped away from his game to meet the Wakandan King halfway.
As he pulled in, he was surprised to find a fuming Tony waiting by the elevator. Steve bypassed his parking spot and pulled up next to Tony and asked, “Are you okay?”
, Tony,” Steve cursed in relief. He nervously parted Tony’s bloody matted hair and wished he would wake. His being unconscious made him uneasy. Steve hissed, “I will never forgive you if you die like
“And I think you’d guess right,” Steve replied. Tony chuckled and turned onto his side to fully face Steve. Tony pillowed his head on his folded arm and lay his other arm over Steve’s side. Steve tucked in closer and ran his hand over Tony’s naked back. Tony’s flesh was warm beneath his touch and was marred by old scars and the slight curvature of his back muscles. Steve sighed heavily and touched his forehead to Tony’s. He kept rubbing Tony’s back and murmured, “I don’t think I’m going to be sleeping at all tonight…”
Steve rolled his eyes then shrugged at Bucky uselessly. There was not much they could do at this hour.
Steve nodded and then nodded Tony to the left. They split with Steve circling from the right and Tony going the other direction.
Steve’s expression dropped a little but whatever fell was picked up in seconds and replaced by a nervous smile.
Steve blushed and stared at the top of Peter’s head. Thanks to his healing factor, his body was relatively unaffected with the exception of his hair being a mess. Tony, on the other hand, not only had messy hair but also his lips were red and swollen, he had a bruise beginning to form on his waist where Steve gripped him too tightly, and the telltale bulge in his loose jeans had not gone down yet. Steve self-consciously adjusted his stance. His cock was still half hard and he hoped it was not as noticeable. The archer easily read the telltale signs and gasped, “
Pepper had deemed yesterday’s interview their last hurrah so, barring any other controversy, Tony and his family merely had to ride out the rest of the media storm until it was over. No more interviews or statements. Tony, Steve, and especially Peter, were free from society’s demands. If society wanted more, then they’d have to look elsewhere.
Peter nodded at his reflection and let Venom push away his sadness. Maybe he could somehow make up for the lives that were taken…
Jarvis said nothing and Tony sadly chuckled to himself, trying to put on a fake face for his robot. He tried to put Jarvis at ease and sauntered in the direction of the barracks where he'd been assigned a bunk. He walked slowly, enjoying the night and reminiscing that short walk he shared with Steve. Jarvis followed, not far behind but silent.
“What the hell, Bucky?!” Steve hissed. He could not believe Bucky just did that! He knew Steve loved Tony and that he wanted to be in a committed relationship with him! Anger over Bucky’s indiscretion burned through his veins and he was tempted to punch him.
Natasha drove through the tape and went straight to where the mass of bodies hovered. The people scattered and Natasha leapt from the bike.
Tony spoke of him in the dreams, the eyepatch and demeanor fit. Fury didn’t call Tony. Tony called him.
“We have to find him,” Steve gasped. “You found me in Brooklyn without a phone or a tracer. We can easily find him in whatever city the call originated from in Tennessee!”
Tony reached out and grasped Steve’s cheek. Tony’s entire being wanted to comfort the super soldier upon Steve’s sad words. It wasn’t fair, to Steve especially.
‘Then anywhere that glowing heart of yours desires :)’ Steve’s reply made Tony bite down on his lip to keep from smiling too goofily. Steve’s flirting always made him feel giddy.
. I can’t go out in public without fearing for the people with me or the strangers around me because at any moment they could be hurt because someone is attacking
For that second their lips met, the world around them melted away. He could no longer hear the arcade machines or the tittering children. After all of their hiding in the past, it felt like such a relief to be out in the open…to kiss Steve without first looking over his shoulder.
Once he was out of earshot, Tony groaned and fell back into the couch. He murmured, “Goddamnit, I still can’t believe he jumped off the tower.
“Oh, really?” Wade asked with a smirk. He picked up his stool and scooted closer to Peter so that only barely an inch of space separated them. Peter flushed but was a little giddy by Wade’s boldness.
Steve groaned and dropped his face in his hands again. This was officially the most utterly embarrassing moment in his life. He wished he could crawl under a rock and pretend it never happened.
Steve rubbed the back if his neck then smirked ironically at Natasha. He stated, “So in other words stop with the self-pity?”
“Any preference?” Steve called out to Tony. He tried to focus all his attention on the suits and not the fact that Tony was naked only a few yards away. Naked and under a waterfall of water…and naked.
On the day of, Tony helped him dress into his formal Captain’s uniform, gifted to him by the Army years prior. Steve’s fingers shook as he tried to button his sleeve. Tony gently placed his hands over Steve’s and carefully buttoned the corner of his sleeve for him. Tony patted down the cloth around the button and then raised his hands to pat down Steve’s chest.
He gulped then ducked his head again. He was afraid to look at her and see her reaction. Uncle Bucky’s words flashed through his mind and he wondered if she was “agreeable.” All his thoughts became focused on one idea that repeated like a mantra in his head:
Steve kissed his forehead and must’ve been reading his mind because he murmured, “Babe, have I ever told you how much I love you?”
He went back to his research but kept the window with Tony’s image up so, when he needed to take a break, he would close everything else down and look into his fiancé’s eyes and gain determination from his strong gaze.
That next hour passed by in a quick daze as Steve’s shock by the entire situation numbed him to everything. Before he knew it, he was being led out of the building and into a waiting car. It was only when he saw the Tower getting closer did he realize he was going home. He sagged deeply into the seat and whispered, “Finally…”
“What are you talking about!? Of course I want to see him!” Tony hissed with a venomous glare at James’ back.
Peter whispered without opening his eyes, “I lost mine, Pops…I’m sorry.” Peter had always been fascinated with Steve’s dog tags so he split the pair and gave one to Peter. His son never took it off until…until now.
Tony wound his arms around the super soldier just as tightly and had to bite down on his lip to keep himself from asking the same of Steve.
He groggily lifted his head to look at the others but just as soon dropped it, sealing his eyes shut, when his headache worsened. Curled into his side was Tony and Steve tightened his hold onto his soulmate. Tony sighed and his hand shifted slightly on Steve’s chest.
Instead of addressing the giant white elephant in the room, Tony asked, “Was this the first time you’ve cried? The first time you mourned him?”
