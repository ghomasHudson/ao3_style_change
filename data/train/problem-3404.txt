Jo trailed behind them with a half-asleep Sam in her arms, and Dean sighed as he wondered what he just got himself into.
Dean pulled back slightly, feeling Cas pull in a deep breath as he opened his eyes. “We shouldn’t-” Cas shook his head, pressing his lips against Dean’s again. “I know.” He whispered out, still leaning forward and repeatedly brushing his lips across Dean mouth. Dean opened his eyes and looked up at Cas’s eyes. “You…” Cas pulled back to listen, with his arms still wrapped around Dean’s waist. “You aren’t mad?” Dean’s voice was soft and cautious, and Cas furrowed his eyebrows. “Why would I be mad?” He asked gently, moving his hands up Dean’s back to the back of his head. “Well, because I…” Dean trailed off and blushed a deep red color, and Cas almost cooed at how cute it was. “I kissed you.” Dean’s voice dropped about three decibels and Cas was lucky he even heard.
“What?” Castiel asked, and stepped out on the front step. Dean gave him a little smile, but with his pale face and the emotions he was projecting, he knew that was not a real smile.
Dean’s throat felt like it was closing up, and he felt like his whole world was imploding in on him. He was going to either burst into tears or pass out. He was in science class when someone had accidentally pressed on the scar on his back, causing him to flashback and push him over the edge. He was having a full blown panic attack. His heart was racing and thumping in his chest, and his whole body was trembling to an intensity that scared him half to death.
“Fine, fine!” Jo brushed him off, but she smirked at Castiel. “Sorry you got stuck with this grump.” Dean sent her a death glare, and she grinned.
“This is Lucifer. I think he’s building an army of demons.” Dean diverted his attention over to the wall. Underneath the picture of Lucifer was a picture of Crowley, the demon who Dean had met the other night. It seemed so long ago.
“Nothing about your life will burden me, Dean. Don’t ever worry about that.” Cas whispered in his ear as they walked into the restaurant and Dean couldn’t help the shy smile that lifted his lips.
“We don’t have to. I have an extra room at my place, and it’s closer, so you guys could just sleep there. I can drive you back there in the morning.” Cas seemed like he had it all figured out. Dean couldn’t really find it in his heart to argue or come up with any other suggestions, so he just nodded.
“Yeah, Lucifer’s done some weird things. Been coming up a lot recently in our research.” She shot Dean a look, and Dean scrunched his eyebrows together. He wasn’t quite sure he knew what she was getting at, but he knew it had to be part of a hunt.
Cas and Dean drove in silence. Dean, not knowing what to say, sat uncomfortably in the passenger seat and thought long and hard about his life. Cas sat next to him, worried that Dean was going to get a little lost in his own head.
“Pancakes. I have chocolate chips and blueberries, what would you like? Also, sausage or bacon?” Dean’s eyes found their way back to Cas, and Cas couldn’t take in the look on his face. He looked so grateful, so cared for, and Cas’s felt like he’d been punched in the stomach.
“This is really nice, Char. Thank you.” He took it and put it in his backpack for later. “What day is it?” Charlie asked, and Dean groaned. “Friday. Means I have Mr. Novak first.” Charlie barked out a laugh.
“Why do you keep stumbling over your words? Just how tired are you?” Dean shook his head and Cas sighed gently. Dean exhaled and leaned into Cas, wrapping his arms around his body. “Are you sleeping here tonight?” Cas asked smoothly, and Dean nodded, hiding his face in Cas’s chest. Cas shut the door behind them and found Gabe tucking Sam under blankets on the couch.
“DEA-” Garth shouted as he walked in, starting to run towards him, but Dean hurriedly hushed them as Sam lifted his head up. They all froze, and Dean rushed to put Sam in the back. He brushed his hand over Sam’s hair as he laid him down, and went back into the main dining room.
“You asking me to move in with you?” Dean’s words were a little slurred and Cas laughed a bit. “Maybe when you’re well rested I’ll ask again.” Dean settled back into Cas. “It’ll get us ready for when we move to Colorado.” Dean couldn’t help but smile because he would be far away from his father and close to the man he loved.
“I got it, sugar.” Ellen stood up and straightened her outfit and left the kitchen. Jo sat next to a sleeping Sam on the couch, and Dean sat on top of the counter. She was working on some homework and Dean was scrolling through some stupid app, waiting for the last hour of his shift to end when-
“So hurt.” Cas breathed, and Dean grabbed his hand firmly and pressed it to the scar. It was like he didn’t even have control of his actions.
“Tell me about this demon.” Dean almost ordered, and the sat down at the closest table when Bobby huffed a deep sigh.
“Dean?” Gabe asked, and Dean froze up like a statue. Castiel heard it, and immediately his stomach dropped. Dean was the one making him feel like this. Something was wrong with Dean.
“Sorry, what can I get you guys?” Mr. Novak stared up at Dean as he scribbled down Gabe’s order, and he examined his face. Dean’s face, despite the plastered on happiness, was pale and almost sickly. He always looked tired, and no matter where and when Mr. Novak looked, there would be faded bruises all around. Mr. Novak didn’t quite know how to approach this, knowing his suspicions were probably true, but he was thrown a curveball with the little boy in his arms. Who could this little boy be? Their eyes were eerily the same, leading him to believe that they were related-
Thanks again so much for reading! I am so thankful for the amount of people who are interested in this! Love you all!!
The campfire is now nothing but ashes as the sun rises through the trees. Beer cans litter the ground as evidence from the previous night.
Part of Dean doesn’t want to, but he fights that part of him down as he walks over to join Cas, Jack, and Meg in building the sandcastle.
We shift our attention along with the archangels, Dean, and Jack, to Meg, who is gasping for air and choking on blood.
Some college kids went on a camping trip and ended up with their hearts ripped out. Only one survivor.
Dean thinks it over for a moment-- he didn’t realize there was such an exact science behind the workings of Hell.
Now. I’ve been listening to the angels talking, and Jack is missing. No one can find him in Heaven or on Earth.
"Heya Sammy! Sorry, I was showing Charlie here around the school and then we ended up meeting Cass in the library and that's where we've been all day." Dean said as they walked up to the scrawny boy with long brown hair who was standing next to the Impala with four other kids.
We ended up defeating Chuck, and Jack took his place as God, which is another long story in itself, but-- well, it turns out we didn’t completely beat him that time. He still had control over us, which is why it took me so long to come talk to you. Gabriel ended up figuring it out and fixing us, so now we are completely free of Chuck’s control. Which leads to me... being here.
Emily makes quick work of picking up the beer cans and putting them in a trash bag. She ties up the bag and leans it against the side of Nathan and Reese’s tent before she crawls inside.

"My siblings and I are all named after angels. Lucifer actually isn't that bad, but he does live up to his name at times." Castiel said.
Cas quickly moves to help Dean up, and he leans into Cas as he continues to hold his stomach with a grimace.
"Whatever, jerk. Let's just go pick up Adam so we can get to The Roadhouse. Kevin and Jess are riding with us." Sam replied, getting into the backseat of the Impala and motioning for the Asian boy and the blonde girl to get in with him.
Cas... I’m sorry, man. I wanted to live a better life for you, but I-- I’m sorry your sacrifice was a waste.
It gives us a place to start. That woman was a dangerous criminal. But don’t worry, we’ll find your friend for you. She won’t hurt him. Here--
Just through those trees over there. Not too far at all. This is actually the same tree that was used for the hangings. Absolutely sick, whoever’s doing this.
Dean stops hugging and petting Miracle. He gets out of bed and grabs some dog food which he puts in the bowls at the foot of the bed.
"Gabriel, do you want to be grounded?" Becky asked. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel were both bright red and playing with their spaghetti, not looking up. They had clearly understood what Gabriel was implying. Everyone else, however, was trying to hide their snickers. Well, everyone other than Naomi, Hester, and Alfie who had no idea what was going on.
Balthazar, Gabriel, and Michael-- now in the body of Adam Milligan-- all stand along the edge of a small lake. We hear a flutter of wings and Castiel comes into view, walking to join his fellow archangels along the lakeshore.
The problem with the situation is that Dean doesn’t want this to end, it’s not even that late and tomorrow is a Saturday, they could do so many things, they could-
“Can’t say I have, bitch” Dean loses no time in straightening and rolling his back, with some satisfying popping of bones “what are you doing here?”
Bobby doesn’t speak much and once Dean’s in the zone he forgets everything except the movements of his hands and what needs to be done. It’s the same when he’s busy looking up throw pillows or lamps or helping the contractors with installing the cabinets in a kitchen. He just loses himself in what he’s doing and tunes out the world.
Dean bites back a smile at the excitement of his little brother, trying to keep a scowl as he unwraps his burger and- okay, the smell is not that bad. Maybe this hippie crap will be good.
Cas pushes the plate towards Dean, stating he knows how much he loves pie and doesn’t want to take away even a bite from him, but he shakes his head.
“What can I talk about then? No ex, no finger licking, no Dean, which is stupid since he’s our waiter, am I missing something? What do you want to talk about? Work? I don’t want to hear about Adler’s periodontitis or the dental implant that Marv can’t seem to keep intact for more than three weeks! Aren’t you tired of being this boring before your 40s?” she snaps, and Castiel shuts up.
“We got bacon and blue cheese, mushrooms with sautéed onions and swiss cheese, then cheddar, lettuce and tomato.”
“You do know your beers! I’m curious about the BBQ-Stout combo now, so I think I'll have that. Thank you, Dean.”
It takes a couple of seconds for his words to register in Castiel’s brain, but none on Meg’s, who’s already snickering.
“An American Pale Ale for Doctor Novak, and an iced tea for Mrs Novak. Burgers will be out in ten minutes, I’m sorry for the waiting but Ellen and Ash are doing their best.” Dean says while putting down two cardboard coasters, the drinks and some snacks, then smiles apologetically and nods, already turning to walk away.
His mind goes immediately to the next time he’s at the Roadhouse and Jo doesn’t give him their special pecan pie as a payback, so he takes a breath and uncovers his face.
Castiel just gestures towards the diver’s car door and waits there. Dean sits on the driver’s seat and turns on the car.
Lunch time arrives and Dean calls Bobby, asking him if it’s too early to get there, but the older man tells him to move his ass so they can eat and then work in peace.
“You’re- you got another appointment?” suddenly disbelieving-Charlie sounds a lot like disbelieving-Sam and Dean makes a mental note to limit the time those two are spending together.
They drive out of town, just a couple of miles to let the city lights well behind them, until they reach a meadow with sparse trees and tons of flowers. Dean is not an expert but he recognizes poppies even in the dark. He parks on the side of the highway and stops the car.
Then, because he’s a man of his word, he does his best to show the doctor what a good tongue-sucking feels like.
“No, I come here often so I know what I like. But thank you. Maybe recommend me a beer? I’m sure you know what they have on tap better than me.”
“Well I don’t anymore! It was an accident, okay? I know he’s hot but I’m not that dumb! I didn’t actively try to harass him! God, how can I go there next month for the checkup?”
“Nothing out of the ordinary. Can I take a look inside? If after that we can’t solve this mystery, we should call the Scooby Gang, ‘cause she’s definitely cursed.”
“Thanks Chuckles, I knew I could count on you” he grumbles and crosses his arms. He’s absolutely not pouting.
The man is hunched under the hood of a black vintage car. Castiel tries to not look, but those bowlegs covered by well worn and stained jeans look familiar and that ass is definitely
The weekends he speds hanging out with Gabriel, Meg and Balthazar are forced onto him because Gabriel can’t take no for an answer, and Meg and Bal live to give him a hard time.
Cas looks up and fuck, that’s a sight. Dean gets a playful smile in return. One of his hands is busy playing with the doctor’s hair on the nape of his neck, the other rests on his cheek.
“It’s not a hot date! He’s a patient, like everyone else!” Castiel blushes while going outside of his small study and into the bathroom to wash his hands, just to have something to do.
He clears his throat to catch their attention when he gets there, and as soon as he sees the doctor’s blue eyes become bigger he wishes he could disappear. Still, he puts on his customer service smile and tries to be a professional.
Instead he drinks some of his beer, the taste is slightly bitter but refreshing and he enjoys it very much, and thinks.
Dean stares at her, mouth hanging open like a fish, he doesn’t even have the time to say something because Novak is immediately shooting daggers at his friend and leaning on the table.
"I'll need your expertise, it's evident I've been doing everything wrong all this time and without you I would've still been an ignorant man."
Dean is surprised to know that Castiel has been at the Roadhouse fairly regularly in the last years.
Jo spots them immediately from behind the bar counter and a knowing smirk is on her face in a split second. Dean’s gonna regret this.
He’s starting to get annoyed. Meg is a good friend, but her attempts to meddle with his love life (especially with Balthazar and Gabriel’s help) are not his favorite part of their friendship.
They eat silently after that, and once Castiel comes back from his fruitless search, he catches up with the latest shenanigans of his brother and their friend, who paired with a couple of spanish girls they met a couple of days before for a weekend road trip. He prays the girls are not murderers.
So he says nothing, but glances at the doctor’s fingers. It was nice having them in his mouth, maybe without gloves…
“That kid reminds me of when I worked here during college. He’s a lot smarter than I am, though, he’s 18 and he’s a sophomore. At 18 I was still wondering how to tell my parents that I wanted to study interior design!”
“Hello to you too, Handmaiden. Care to elaborate?” she mumbles on the other end of the receiver, sounding like she’s just waking up. At 11 AM. There’s some serious envy for a second.
Because if he stopped himself, and thought about his life, he would’ve tried to walk away just like Mick.
He asks Hannah, the secretary, if Mr. Winchester left any messages, if he’s late, but the answer is negative. Dean was his last patient for the day, so he takes advantage of this “free” time and does some paperwork, checking the records for tomorrow’s patients, filling out some new patients’ records, and before he knows it, Meg is knocking on his open door to catch his attention.
And maybe try to meet someone new so he’ll stop thinking of his sexy dentist, especially now that he had a good look at those beautiful thighs, when it's not the right time.
“Hey!” he’s offended for five seconds but then he sighs, resigned. “He’s so fucking hot Charlie, you have no idea. Any possibility I could’ve had with him? Shot to hell. He got so red! He kept working as professionally as before, but it was obvious he was embarrassed! I can’t even blame the breathing gas, cause he didn't use it!”
, thank you, Dean. And a beer, whatever you have on tap. Meg?” Novak answers before she can, with a stony face that’s so different from the tiny friendly smiles the doctor was sharing before.
Despite his attempted reassurances, Dean can’t help but think that he has been missing out on celebrating his birthday.
"I'm Charlie Bradbury. I'm new here and I haven't gotten my schedule yet." She replied, smiling just as widely as the receptionist.
Castiel gently pushes Dean out of the hug so he can look at him. Dean rests their foreheads together instead, wanting nothing more than to be close to Castiel in this moment.
Assorted weapons cover the table as Dean, Cas, Sam, Meg, and Jack grab the ones they think will be useful for their journey to Hell.
"Then what did you do?" Cass questioned, still grimacing from the taste that refused to leave his mouth.
Rowena moves around her throne to sit in it. While she is able to maintain her regal posture, she is clearly drained from her fight with Bela.
"Privacy? Show of favoritism? I honestly don't know, it's just always been that way." Dean shrugged and took Charlie's plate, putting the dishes in a sink to be washed before grabbing a paper plate with a slice of pie that someone had left out. "Where do you want to go next?"
I don’t know what exactly happened before you died, there’s clearly more to this that I don’t know-- and quite honestly, I don’t care to know it-- but you are here. This Heaven is real. Jack really is God now. And whatever’s keeping you from going back to Earth and visiting those boys... I say to Hell with it. Have they ever not welcomed you back from the dead with enthusiasm?
"Ahh! There's the Luci we all know and love!" Dean smirked and Castiel smacked him upside the head as Lucifer glared at them.
EILEEN sits on her couch reading a book when her phone suddenly lights up and buzzes next to her. She checks the notification and frowns in confusion as she gets up and heads to her front door, leaving her phone on the couch.
Every other demon she passes reacts with terror, but every time she waves a hand and the demon crumples to the ground.
Jack sobs even harder as the black ink slowly takes over Castiel’s form in a hauntingly accurate reenactment of his death.
Sam, Meg, Dean, Cas, and Jack all gather together again, holding hands as Jack brings the back to Earth and we--
"You tell them to stop embarrassing us, yet you continue to embarrass us as you do it." Dean mumbled, somehow even redder than he was before. Cassie was just as red as Dean was and Lucifer thinks to himself that he would pay big money to know what was going on inside of their heads.
I say we just start this little meeting without him. Get this over with-- I've got things I’d like to do, you know?
"Um, right." Dean said. He turned to Castiel who was blushing furiously as he had heard what Michael said. "What did I just agree to?"
Hey, I thought we were over this? I’m not letting anything happen to the kid. I would rather die again.
"My best friend. His dad is the principle but nobody knows that other than me and our families and now you. He and his siblings go by their grandma's maiden name here so people don't find out that they're the principles kids."
But you know when your choices started being taken from you. You can pinpoint exactly when you stopped being given a choice. I don’t know when that happened to me. I lived my whole life without any choice, because of dad, and then apocalypse after apocalypse, and then I found out Chuck has been in my head, controlling me. I don’t know who I am anymore.
I just want to know if I should expect you back, is all. You did live a whole life without me, I can’t really expect you to want to stay here after finally living the life you always wanted.
As the brothers kill the last of the vamps, we see Dean looking at the vamp impaled by rebar with relief.
"You can't ground me, I'm 21 years old!" Gabriel said. Anna tried hiding her laughter by drinking some of her milk, but she just ended up spilling it all down her front.
The amusement park is crowded, but we focus on Dean-- all dressed up in colorful swim shorts, a floral-patterned Bermuda shirt, sunglasses, and a bucket hat-- walking through the crowd, side-by-side with Castiel-- who has been coerced into wearing a similar outfit.
Sure enough, the appearance of the angels had gained Bela’s attention, and she had disappeared, no trace of her left anywhere.
JUMP CUT. Billie enters the room along with the Empty, which swallows both Billie and Castiel, leaving Dean all alone.
So, Chuck... removed everyone from Earth? But then you defeated him... or you thought you did... and we all returned? But you hadn’t really defeated him then. But you have now.
What’s truly going on here? Do you not want to be back? What happened? And no more running circles around it. Lord knows I don’t do this touchy-feely B.S. but there’s clearly something you need to get out.
"Lucifer! What the hell did you do to my fries, you ass?" Castiel shouted at his brother. Dean was gulping down his milkshake, trying to get rid of the taste.
"No, I got excused from class to show Charlie around the school. I just texted you and asked you to join me." Dean smirked at his friend.
And Donna, Jody and the girls, Charlie and Stevie, all the other hunters... you just forgot about them, too?
I hear you’re close with Rowena. I want you to ensure that I’m in good standing with her in case Bela’s plan goes south. In exchange, I’ll give you this body back. Not sure why you want it, but whatever. I can find someone else.
Castiel sits alone, an empty whiskey glass in his hand. Jo glances at Cas from down the bar a few times before moving to wipe down the counter next to him.
Jamie tilts his head slightly towards Dean at the mention of Alex but makes no other sign that he is paying attention.
"In Gabriel's defense, when I went to get Deano and Cassie to set the table, I heard Dean say something that immediately made my thoughts go bad places. Turns out they were just playing Call of Duty and Cass was being killed by zombies." Lucifer said and the whole table burst into laughter (except for Hester, Naomi, and Alfie because they were innocent and Dean and Castiel because they were blushing like crazy).
The giggling continues. A breeze blows through the clearing causing Sam, Eileen, and Emily to shiver.
SAM and DEAN stand together on the bridge looking out at the expanse that has become Jack’s version of Heaven.
A POLICE OFFICER enters followed by Sam and Eileen, who each nod at the officer before he leaves them alone with Emily.
In the end he’s only five minutes earlier than agreed, but to his surprise Cas is already in front of the building’s door, looking around nervously.
Castiel sees Mr. Singer walking towards him and steps out of the car, ready to be scolded. Again. He’s relieved that it’s Saturday and the older man is usually alone, he doesn’t like when there’s an audien- oh.
is the reason. You only have to find out if he’s a homophobe, then.” with a wink she resumes eating, and Cas follows, not wanting to end up in another argument. And also because he’s busy subtly looking for Dean in the crowd of the bar.
It wasn’t an entirely conscious decision, but on Thursday Castiel made sure to wear his bumblebees scrubs, with the slightly tight pants that he had stopped wearing because they were uncomfortable.
“You work too much. You spend your spare time at home, reading. Which is nice, once in a while, but not always.”
Before he can think he hears himself asking “Dean?” and sees the other man facing him and Mr. Singer, with one hand over his head like he’s massaging it. That’s probably what the thud was.
He's good at this, he's done it for years and it's like riding a bike. He hasn't since he was sixteen, but if you gave him a bike right now he'd be able to ride it.
“Yeah, sorry Doc, I, huh- should’ve called to say I was recruited to help here, it’s been a busy evening! So…” Dean tries for nonchalance and clears his throat, again “are you and the missus here to eat or drink?”
Dean and Benny are done with the latest project, the homeowners were very satisfied and assured them that they'd recommend the studio’s services to all of their friends, and they already have two new houses to deal with, so Dean is very happy.
He knows that Dean likes to joke and that he finds most of Castiel’s attempt at being funny hilarious; he know that the other man is very proud of his and his
It’s probably the abrupt stop that makes Dean open his eyes in panic and Castiel knows that that is the moment Dean becomes aware of what he was doing. The flush on his whole face is only a confirmation, and Castiel is very grateful for the mask that hides half of his face, because he can’t help but smile.
Alfie puts a paper towel on the patient’s chest, then readjusts the chair to a reclined position and the light above his head. Once everything’s done, Castiel takes the dental mirror and the scraper and approaches the chair while saying “Open your mouth for me, Dean.”
“Hey, jerk” Sam says cheerfully before noticing the curved back of his older brother “did you stretch at least once since you sat there?”
On his way to work he keeps thinking whether there is something he can do to get out of this hole he crawled himself in, but the only reasonable solution is just bailing.
“What, you’re already tired of seeing me?” Castiel tries to go for mock-offended but maybe having half his face covered doesn’t help since Dean looks terrified for a second.
During the drive back to his apartment, Cas thanks Dean again for he beautiful night and when they're parked again under the building, none of them wants to leave.
It’s not like he has a long maxillary sinus lift in the morning, one dental work appointment (because the dental hygienist got sick at the last minute and they didn’t have the time to call the stand-in), and two other patients in the afternoon before Dean.
Castiel doesn’t have the time to ask what he is doing because Dean starts laughing while rising up again.
They finish eating the pie silently, then they have a brief argument over who has to pay and settle it with Cas paying the food and Dean tipping (and because it's Kevin he leaves a few dollars more).
If Castiel thought that Dean’s body was the only interesting thing about him, in the short amount of time they spent together he was proved wrong.
“He didn’t? And here I was, desperately waiting for some fun news!” she sighs dramatically “anyways, yes, it’s time to go home, come on. I’ll offer you dinner so you can stop moping!”
It takes a moment to kick back online and he removes his hands from the other man’s mouth to exchange the tools he was using with the ones he needs to remove the cavities. He sends a silent prayer to Dean, telling him to stop, but telepathy still isn’t in his skillset, so his prayer goes unanswered.
They compare schedules and decide on the following week’s Saturday, since it’s usually a slow day, and after chatting for a couple more minutes they hang up.
, I guess I’ll have to hop off and let you get your beauty sleep so I can have you at your best tomorrow?”
“No Cas, no dice. You gotta try it, you’ll never be the same after, I swear. C’mon, at least one bite, for me?” he takes a forkful and extends his hand to the doctor, to feed him, batting his eyelashes exaggeratedly.
You were there, Sam. It wasn’t really a long conversation. She said business in Hell was slow, she wanted to make a deal, and then there was a loud noise and she said she had to go. Said she’d call me back.
Yes and no. You see, in my research, I found out that Chuck had visited a Miss Becky Rosen and while he was visiting her... he wrote one last Supernatural book: The End. I managed to get my hands on it and lo and behold, he had written the ending that you lot suffered through. Everyone dear to Sam and Dean got poofed away... Cas confessed his gay love and was immediately sent to the Empty... Sam and Dean save the day with the help of little Jack who now has to run the universe at the ripe old age of three... Dean died in a tragic hunting accident... Sam was left all alone to live an apple pie life that he didn’t really want-- I printed out a copy if you want to read it.
Well, let me know how it goes. I’ve got-- I need to make a few amends with Jack... a lot of people, actually-- you included-- and I--
Lucifer quickly started knocking on the door and was immediately greeted with Cass shouting for him to come in.
"You know, one of these days we should pretend we are dating just to see how everyone would react." Dean laughed, picturing his and Cass' families' faces as they screamed in happiness.
Alex, too, perks up when he heard his friend, although he is still not able to stand without the aid of Sam.
Dean doesn’t even look embarrassed by this revelation, too worried about Castiel’s sudden appearance to care.
You said the one thing you wanted, you couldn’t have. But you can have it, Cas. You’ve already had it for a long time now.
The camera ZOOMS OUT to see Alex standing over the group, and as we temporarily focus on him, his eyes flash black.
Fine. Jack helped me get out of that place. He could have left me there, but he didn’t, and now... I feel oddly responsible for the kid. Like I need to protect him.
The campers are too busy laughing to notice a rustling in the bushes off in the distance. We ZOOM IN on the bushes as they shake.
Thank you all again so much for reading, I really appreciate it and I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am!
Dean releases Castiel’s and Meg’s hands to pull an angel blade out of the inside of his coat, and Sam, Cas, and Meg follow suit, all pulling out angel blades of their own.
"Michael, Becky, and Luci! Stop embarrassing Dean and Castiel!" Chuck shouted from the living room where the rest of our family was.
Once they are out of both gasoline and salt, Eileen and Sam stand at the edge of the clearing. Sam pulls a lighter out of his pocket and lights it. He tosses it at the tree and he and Eileen watch as the tree goes up in flames.
Chuck had the wrong ideas of what Heaven was meant to be. There shouldn’t be... so much separation and-- spending eternity away from everyone else isn’t my idea of happiness. It’s just so lonely and-- it feels so controlled here.
Thank you all so much for your patience and support!!!! I couldn't do this without you!!! Love y'all!!!
"I didn't put dog shit in your fries if that's what you think. You should know by now that I never repeat something." Lucifer chuckled.
"Well, alrighty then, Angel." Dean rolled his eyes. Charlie was just sitting in her chair, laughing at the entire exchange. Now that she has witnessed Dean and Castiel interacting with each other, she can't not ship them.
I just... I remember talking to people, making some kind of deal. And to seal the deal I had to kiss them? I don’t know, it was weird, man. How is this gonna help you find Jamie? I need to find him, or his girlfriend will kill me.
Emily makes no move to leave. Instead, she steps even further into the clearing, and it is then that Eileen notices it-- the rope in Emily’s hand, trailing across the ground behind her.
Sam and Eileen exchange a slightly confused look as they sit down in the two chairs next to the door.
You know what? That pain’s not gonna go away. Right? But if we don’t keep living, then all that sacrifice is gonna be for nothing.
"Because when I started working here, I found some fries that had been expired for a year so I put them away for a time like this. You just ate 8 year old fries." Lucifer grinned.
At the other end of the table, Sam, Eileen, Garth, Jodie, and Donna are discussing the logistics of creating a hub for hunters.
To be honest, I was planning on cracking open a beer and waiting for Rowena’s call to pop down to Hell and either gank some sons o’ bitches or play Let’s Make A Deal, demon style.
Jack steps forwards, in front of Castiel, and his eyes shine golden. Bela’s eyes widen with fear before she disappears and we--
Dean puts a finger to his lips as he looks back at the rest of the group and raises his angel blade.
What if you think of it differently? Instead of thinking about it as living two different lives, think of this life as a continuation of the other life you lived.
Crowds of people fill the area for the festivities. Sam and Dean sit together on a bench and Castiel stands next to them. Dean holds a tray of pies in his lap.
Dean sits on a park bench, ice cream cone in hand as he watches Jack on the swings, licking his own ice cream cone.
Another murder-- some hikers just called in the bodies. Looks like the same M.O. as the campers who were killed this weekend.
Emily chokes on the salt as Gertrude is expelled from her body. Eileen removes her hand from Emily’s mouth and helps her to stand.
"Michael said you wouldn't date Charlie if she was straight because... um... youwantedtodateme." Cass said.
A moment passes as the voice replies-- we still can’t hear them-- and then the line beeps as the other person hangs up.
Before Sam can get his full question out, Gabriel smirks and snaps his fingers and with a bright flash of light, we CUT TO--
Sam and Dean are suddenly in the same barn in which Dean died, MACHETES in hand, and they are in the middle of a fight with the very same VAMPIRES from that night.
The doors to the throne room burst open and the female demon from before steps into the room-- BELA TALBOT, now a demon. Her eyes glint black as she gives Rowena a sickly-sweet smile and we--
I will never begin to understand what you’re going through, but that doesn’t change the fact that I will help you in any way that I can.
There are a few murmurs throughout the crowd of angels, and Balthazar lets out a loud whistle, causing the attention of the crowd to focus on him.
I didn’t wanna die, Sam. Chuck took that away from me, and now that I know that... I’m terrified. Because I don’t know what else he took away from me-- what other choices I wasn’t able to make. And I’m glad that you don’t know what that is like, Sam, I am, but part of me also wishes that he took choices away from you, too, so you could understand what I’m going through right now.
Emily slowly sits up and stretches, the sleeping bag falling away to reveal that she is covered in blood.
Sam and Eileen look back at Emily who is now back to sitting down on her cot and shedding silent tears.
We ZOOM OUT on the scene of Dean and Cas sitting together on the bench, leaning into each other’s sides, and we--
"They were annoying me." Lucifer shrugged. "I may or may not have given them eight-year-old fries." Michael burst into laughter and Becky smacked Lucifer upside the head. "No need to do that! Ellen already did!"
"Well, we didn't actually go to class, we just sat in the library all day talking, so pretty great." Dean answered.
As Gertrude flames away, the rope snaps and Sam falls to the ground and immediately tosses the noose away from him.
In a series of fluttering wings, MICHAEL, BALTHAZAR, Gabriel, and Castiel along with Dean all appear on the scene, immediately rushing to Jack's side.
Contrary to its name, THE EMPTY is far from empty. ANGELS and DEMONS both fill The Empty, but we only care about one.
CUT TO show both Jack and Castiel, the former with a look of excitement and the latter hesitation, as Jack flips the switch. For a moment, it seems as if nothing has happened then--
"I know right! If I could, I would spend all day in here, but unfortunately I can't. We're lucky we can be in here for the tour, but if Mom catches us just know we're getting thrown out."
Jack gives the Empty a look that he clearly picked up from Dean as he raises a hand. With a snap of Jack’s fingers, the Empty explodes, black ink splattering everywhere and melting into the void.
First, I have removed the walls between heavens. Heaven shouldn’t be a separate place for everyone, people should all be able to visit each other as they wish.
"That again? They need to get new hobbies other than wishing we were together." Dean rolled his eyes.
Oh, Mae is gonna kill me... 'don't lose him, Alex'... 'nothing good ever happens when he's with you, Alex'... I swear it's not me making this happen!
Following Sam and Dean-- mostly Dean, really-- around the Bunker and to Ohio, without even letting them know you’re back amongst the living? Honestly, I didn’t really think you had it in you.
I have also decided to appoint Castiel as my second-in-command, and upon retrieving him from The Empty, I have promoted him to the status of an archangel.
I’m glad you’re here, you know that? Because I am. I’ve said it before: I’d rather have you, and knowing that you--
"Hi there! How may I help you?" The cheery old woman at the front desk asked Charlie as she stepped through the doorway.
Sam, Cas, Jack, and I are going to Hell to help Rowena. She hasn’t called back yet and when I tried calling her, she didn’t pick up.
I don’t know and I don’t really want to think about it. I’m just hoping that Gabriel started a game of hide-and-seek then forgot about it.
There is a moment of awkward silence as the two brothers stand together. We can tell neither one really knows how to act around each other anymore-- so much time has passed for one but not the other.
Emily looks around her before breaking off the trail and hiking through the forest, now keeping an eye on her surroundings instead of the pictures.
New skill you learned in Hell? I remember it wasn’t something you had as a human, you know, since you killed your parents for their money.
Well, I don’t know how to fix this, Sam. You burned my body, you had a funeral, you mourned my death, and you moved on. You had a wife, possibly some kids, and you moved on. You don’t need me to be your big brother anymore, and I’m dealing with that. I’m trying to move on and deal with my own shit, so, please, let me do that.
Meg narrows her eyes at Dean, contemplating. Dean looks right back at her with a steely expression, and after a moment she determines that he would kill her if he thought she wasn’t telling the truth.
Before the smoke can get too far away, however, Castiel raises his hand, his eyes glowing bright with grace as he smites the demon from afar, and the smoke dissipates in a flash of bright light.
The brothers enter the library. They stop next to the table where Dean waits for Sam to continue speaking, and when it’s clear he’s not going to continue, he rolls his eyes.
After that, Dean and Castiel sat making idle chat with Charlie as she finished her food. Dean didn't even bother to get a slice of pie, which made Ellen come over and start frantically checking his temperature to make sure he wasn't sick. They just explained what happened with Lucifer and the fries and Ellen mumbled something under her breath before she scolded Lucifer and made him clean the entire diner until it was spotless. Charlie left soon after that so Dean and Cass took their siblings home.
Do you really think Jack would knowingly keep the two of you apart? After everything you've been through?
At Bela’s words, Meg raises the angel blade and takes a step forward, but Bela disappears before she can stab her.
Dean-- he would-- he would pray to me. Every day. It’s the only thing that kept me sane and now I don’t even know if that was real. I don’t know if any of this is real, because I still hear him.
Dean leans back and moves a hand to cup Castiel’s face. He bites his lip for a moment, a range of emotions flickering over his face before he settles for exaggeratedly rolling his eyes as he drops his hand back down to Castiel’s shoulder.
Hey, what do you say we go get some burgers and ice cream, and then we can come back here and hang out? Sound good?
"Oh. Hey, you should come to The Roadhouse after school with us!" Dean said, trying to change the subject.
They sit in silence for a bit as Dean continues to eat his ice cream. Sam doesn’t really know what to do with himself, the moment is too awkward, so he finally breaks the silence.
Alex does as Sam asks and puts his contact info in Sam’s phone, then flops back down to lay in the sand.
We pause for a moment as we wait for Cas to arrive at the porch, where he stands somewhat awkwardly.
On the sofa in front of the tv sits Cas. Jack is wrapped up in a blanket on the floor in front of him, clearly excited about the movie. Meg sprawls in an armchair in the corner of the room like she owns the thing. Everyone has a bowl of popcorn to themselves despite the fact that none of them need to eat.
Oh, like you’ve never thought about doing the same. I did what I had to. And in return, I got turned into this.
You obviously haven’t been paying attention to me. I get up this early all the time. Just ‘cause you don’t notice...
Not sure yet. I’m not scheduled for the next few days, so I’ll probably just spend it with the family.
The lights are off in the bunker leaving the contents of the room in shadows as Dean opens the door and enters the bunker.
And then it was time for me to die, and I did, but then all of a sudden Dean and I were back on Earth, on the hunt that killed him. Except this time, he didn’t die. And I’m thankful for that, I really am, because that other life was... I wasn’t unhappy, but I wasn’t happy, either. As soon as Dean died, I got out of the life. I stopped hunting and I settled down and got married and had a kid, and I used to think that that was what I wanted, years ago, but these past few years I haven’t wanted that. I don’t want out. I want to hunt-- to help people-- but I didn’t.
For your birthday, since we have never really done anything before, and we figured now is a good of time as any, we’re taking a trip to the beach.
I can’t tell you how long I-- how long I sat there after you-- I just wanted you back, man. It’s all I’ve ever wanted, really, and you...
"Okay. Coming right up." Lucifer said before turning in their order and going to get the orders from other tables.
I can’t say this new form doesn’t come with its perks, however. I must admit, I almost prefer being like this.
PAN down to see the Impala driving down an otherwise silent road. As it passes the camera, we turn to see a city sign for Akron, Ohio.
I’m coming back. And it’s not the life I always wanted. Maybe at first, but after a while I preferred hunting to being normal. It’s why I always ended up coming back to it. I just-- I need to find Eileen. I didn’t do that last time, and I should have. I didn’t find anyone.
Dean, Sam, and Cas all sit at a table, a bottle of scotch between them, each nursing their own glass.
Nope. I’m okay. I’m also okay if we maybe don’t tell Mae about this one? It was traumatizing enough to live it once; I don’t need to relive it when she starts questioning me about it.
Dean’s birthday party is in full swing in the library of the bunker. Everyone is eating either Dean’s birthday Rice Krispie treat or some of his birthday pie as they hang around the room talking amongst themselves.
It was kind of hectic towards the end there, lots of things were going on-- and I know that’s not an excuse! But, uh, there was a lot going on.
The Bunker door opens and Sam steps through carrying his duffle bag. He’s happier now that he has worked things out with Eileen, and it's noticeable.
Sam and Dean start fighting the vamps and at first it seems to be going exactly the same as it went the night Dean died. The climactic moment comes as Dean attacks a vampire and it starts pushing him towards the pillar with rebar that had killed Dean previously. This time, Dean is ready, and he turns at the last minute, causing the vampire to get impaled instead.
In his hand, Sam has a flashlight and a printed out copy of the photo from the article he had found.
No, I know, I just-- I’m sorry, I had a whole thing in my head of what I was going to say, but I just forgot it.
Sam gets up and heads back over to the parking lot as Dean pulls out his phone and dials Rowena’s number.
Kudos are always appreciated, and I am so thankful for all of them! I also reply to all comments, so be sure to leave your thoughts either in the comments here, or you can send me an ask or a message on tumblr!
Despite his initial shock, Dean relaxes as he pulls the Impala over to the shoulder, glancing at Castiel in the passenger’s seat as he does so. Once the Impala is parked, however, Dean turns to Cas and pulls him into a crushing hug.
Emily pauses in packing up Nathan and Reese’s things when something small tumbles out of a pillow and onto the ground. She picks it up to see that it’s a small box-- a ring box. One of the boys was going to propose.
Thank you all so much for reading this!! I am constantly blown away by the amount of support and excitement I see from everyone about this project!
Sam enters the bunker, duffle bag on his shoulder, and calls out to Dean, remembering the last time he came back.
It took Castiel a moment to recover from what Dean had just said. "They'd probably throw a party." He said once he could speak again.
Now, I think we need more angels for this next part, but I’m going to need you to tell me which ones we should and shouldn’t bring back.
Bobby looks at his beer bottle, which is now empty. Castiel’s revelation is not something he knows how to deal with.
I was thinking of heading to the beach after lunch. What do you think, Cas? Dig our toes in the sand for a while?
As the Ferris wheel comes to a stop, Jamie looks out and sees Dean and Castiel, talking with each other, and widens his eyes in panic before black smoke rushes out of his mouth and he collapses in his seat, causing the girl to scream and attracting the attention of Dean and Cas.
We’ll keep an eye on Jamie, you work on finding Alex as fast as you can. Any word yet from Meg and Jack?
As Sam lights the lighter and holds it to the rope above his head, Gertrude reaches down and stabs him in the chest with her knife.
A female demon walks, alone, through the dark, fire lit hallways of Hell. She stays far enough away from the light that we cannot make out what she looks like.
"Enjoy your food. I made it myself." Lucifer smiled devilishly (even though that's technically how he always smiles because, well, Lucifer) and handed Charlie her strawberry milkshake and cheeseburger, Dean his bacon cheeseburger and chocolate milkshake, and Cass his two cheeseburgers and chocolate milkshake, then he set a basket of fries between Dean and Cass for them to share.
And then when I came back, once Jack brought me to Earth and showed me that I really am back-- you just seemed so happy. And then you told Sam that it was time the two of you moved on from Jack and I. I was about to go back to Heaven after that, but then Michael came and started talking about how he and I are basically the same because of me and you, and him and Adam, and he convinced me to talk to you-- and I was about to-- and then I heard your last prayer and you were, well, here.
Dean nods, and clumsily signs along as he talks-- he’s still working on his sign language, but he’d be damned if he didn’t figure it out eventually.
Three steading breaths later he’s got his notepad in his hand and is walking to the Novaks table, repeating himself
The car digression helps him to not think about the embarrassment of what happened and he stays there, trying to remember if Gabe has talked about cars recently, until Meg knocks on the door and swings it open without waiting for an answer.
When Dean’s mostly done with his burger, he cleans his hands with a napkin and grabs the water bottle his brother brought with the food, muttering about the absence of a good beer before taking a drink.
The frustrated groan coming from Meg surprises Castiel, that was not the reaction he expected. He sits up, watching his friend curiously.
“You sayin I’m an alcoholic, Cas?” Dean’s eyes have a mischievous glint in them, but his expression is mostly serious.
He takes it, and Castiel feels every callus in Dean’s hand. He also feels his warmth and how nice it is to have it wrapped around his own. He indulges just for a second to fantasize how it would be to have this hand caressing his own body, then snaps back to reality and hauls Dean up. He sees his eyes grow bigger at that, but it’s so quick that he’s not sure he really saw it. And it doesn’t matter all that much when they end up closer than it’s appropriate. With a step back he lets go of the other man’s hand.
Turns out Cas was actually interested in what an interior designer does and Dean was more than happy to explain and show off some of his favorite projects. The doctor wasn’t stingy on compliments and Dean relished in them, proud of his own accomplishments.
But the clinic was just starting to have a good amount of patients and finally he was making some money. It was so nice to finally relax and not stress over bills, paying up loans, and making ends meet.
“I told you to knock it off. Why are you making him uncomfortable? You know you can’t drive away patients, we need them!”
“You’re gross.” Sam chuckles with a grimace and digs in, and for a couple of minutes they’re too busy eating to engage in small talk.
It's normal, right? They're going out for dinner together on a Friday, it'd be stupid and bad for the environment if they both drove there.
Cas knows what he’s doing, there’s no doubt since his smile is now a smirk. Dean wonders what his own face is doing, but he probably looks like he received a bucket of iced water on his head. He quickly ducks his head and starts eating, feeling Cas’ gaze on him.
The meeting goes fairly well, the house he has to redecorate with Benny, his partner at Winchester & Lafitte Renovations, has good bones and the style the owners want is one of his favorites. It's a two story house, with a basement and a garage, three rooms, two bathrooms, a big open floor kitchen with a living room. He can definitely work with that. The front and back yards are gonna need all of Benny’s knowledge on landscaping though. They’re gonna do amazing and he’s very excited.
Dean had a day off so he’s not tired, on the contrary he’s actually fidgety and in need of something to do. Getting drunk was a good option to forget about the appointment he purposefully missed, but destiny or God had some other plans.
“Cut it out you two and get back to work!” Ellen doesn’t spare them a glance, too busy at the grill.
Dean Winchester was beautiful inside and out. And he wanted to know more about him, in any way the other man would have him.
“Don’t be stupid, Clarence. I did not know he works here, I just saw him last week with Bal, as a customer, and I figured there was a high chance to find him here. Not working. Aren’t you happy you saw him in that cute little apron? Sauntering away? Those are nice bowlegs…” she makes an appreciative noise, and something twists inside Castiel.
Dean looks at Jamie with something akin to pity-- or is it sympathy?-- before he looks back to Eileen on his phone.
Sam jogs through the forest, Eileen at his heels, until they break through the trees into the clearing and their eyes fall on the tree standing in the middle, looking untouched.
When Chuck had us under his control, Dean... Dean died. He got killed on a hunt, and I had to live without him. And I did. I lived for more than forty years after Dean died. I had a whole other life.
"Good. I met the new girl, Charlie, and showed her around the school. She's really nice and I think we'll be good friends." Dean said.
romantically involved with me in any way.” he feels suddenly very warm under Dean’s eyes, who looks embarrassed and two seconds away from bolting.
it’s not the time, approaches his car. He sees that Dean’s ears are redder than before, but he’s still smiling and it feels genuine so he just doesn’t question it.
It’s probably late, but he feels like a dick now. He ponders if he should apologize to his friends, because it’s definitely long overdue.
“Well, hopefully you won’t have any other bad to- experiences. Here. I think we’re done? Yes, everything’s good. Alfie, give Mr. Winchester a glass of water to rinse his mouth, if he wishes. Dean, there’s no new cavities and the ones we’ve treated are perfect, but you should floss more, there’s some plaque building up and we don’t want that to become tartar. I’ll see you in a couple of months for another checkup. It was a pleasure. Goodbye, Dean.”
“Give us a call tomorrow, so we can reschedule your appointment. It’s a pity your teeth are so straight,
Castiel decides to wait in the dental chair’s room, under the pretense of supervising Alfie’s work with setting the right equipment (Alfie takes offense on that, he is more than capable of arranging a dental mirror and a couple of scrapers that he’ll have to sterilize again even if they end up unused). Then, Hannah leads Dean in and he sits on the chair without being prompted.
“No, I don’t have the energy for this. Get your ass up, we’re leaving now” and with that she storms off.
So yeah, even if he wanted to forget about it, he couldn’t. His brain was scheming with Meg apparently.
“He? Dude, no. Oh my God, no!” he throws back his head, laughing hard “Charlie is a girl. My best friend. A big
Behind the closed door he can finally lie face down on the small couch and lament his frustrations in peace until Meg comes in later to give him a lift home.
“Dean, you know I love you and you can come here whenever you need, and I’ll gladly listen to your very important musings without complaining, but you barged in as I was getting ready to go out on a date, so why don’t you tell me what you did this time before I tell Jo
He can't help but laugh, throwing his head back. It takes a while to calm himself, and when he sees Cas again he’s rewarded with the most beautiful gummy smile the doctor has shown him.
The phrase “there's no two without three” has been stuck in his head since the day he found out Dean was coming back. And yes, he was shocked enough that he realized running off to Hannah’s desk to ask her if she was sure the appointment was real was a bad idea only when he heard Meg’s evil cackle from the other side of said desk.
The texts they exchanged in the past days were nice, he feels like they know each other better even if they haven’t shared any real personal information.
“No, because to me it seemed like you were harassing him!” Castiel leans back on the chair, deflating.
Nope, no, absolutely not. Because a) Novak would be insane to accept a date with him, Dean knows that he’s not date material, because his life is boring, and 2) what the fuck? He’s his dentist and their business relationship is weird already, there’s no need to add hitting on him explicitly to the mix.
“Good. Gotta keep you on your toes. So, where to?” with a smooth manoeuvre he’s once again on the road.
“Because he either really is a homophobic piece of shit, and we won’t see him ever again, or he gets the hint and makes a move on you, maybe puts his tongue to work again to loosen you up.” the wink she adds is gratuitous, and Castiel fights the urge to throw at her some peanuts.
“No idea, some brunette she-demon that was with Novak, said she works with him after huh... I may have called her Mrs Novak and she laughed at me and said that the doctor is… gay.” Dean shifts in his seat, eating some more.
He loves Scooby-Doo dearly (and makes a pretty good impression of the dog too!), is very protective of his brother, his parents (even if they live in Florida now) and his friends, and has very strong opinions on The Hobbit (
He’s almost done and he just wants to stretch and go back home to take a long hot shower, a stranger won’t distract him from his plans.
Dean dies a little when he sees that Cas is wearing tight dark jeans, a dark grey shirt with the sleeves rolled up (motherfucker has sexy forearms, how’s that fair?) and a couple of buttons left open, and there’s a leather jacket on his lap.
Kevin arrives at that moment with the beers, some peanuts, olives and chips, and disappears after reassuring them that the burgers will be out shortly.
And it was his own idea to have dinner together so if he wants it to be a date, it can be a date, right?
“Well, thank you, Dean. I- I feel very stupid right now. I should have checked that before coming here.” he chuckles, unsure of what to do with his hands. He’s fidgeting.
"So what," he collects some crumbs with his fork and licks them off, keeping his eyes on the doctor’s, that track his own tongue’s movements.
Castiel wills his dirty mind to not interpret that invite in any other way than a friendly drive around the neighborhood.
He was so focused on being grumpy and annoyed that he didn’t notice that they were trying to help, especially after Mick.
"This, Cas, is paradise on earth. During the day it's even more beautiful. The flowers are very pretty. And during spring there's always bees buzzing around. But at night" he climbs on Baby's hood, still warm "at night it's perfect to watch the stars."
He likes it, likes that Cas’ hand is bigger and smoother than his own, that it’s warm, that his thumb rubbing softly the back of his own hand makes him all soft and fuzzy. He squeezes the other hand a little bit, looking at Cas from the corner of his eye. He’s smirking, the smug bastard.
Meg smiles at that, a genuine and soft smile that’s so rare on her it makes Castiel wonder if he’s already drunk with only half a beer glass.
“To help you, you idiot!” she rolls her eyes, burger back again on the plate. “Don’t tell me you really believed I’d want to flirt with him.”
“No, no, it was by chance. I think. I didn’t ask him. Oh man, is he following me to sue me?? Fuck, that’s why that Meg chick told me to call today to reschedule the appointment! It’s a trap!”
“Dad thought I was going to study mechanical engineering and design cars. Mom wanted for me to do something that made me happy, so she wasn’t a problem to begin with. But yeah, Dad had some ideas and I was scared I’d disappoint him. Turns out I was worried about nothing, ‘cause the old man didn’t bat an eye. He said they’d be my first customers once I graduated.”
“Yeah, with the saliva ejector. My hand slipped and it landed on his tongue, hence… his tongue was sucked.”
but I won’t be hearing anything about finger-licking, or Dean Winchester, I will walk away with the burger if you only say
“Meg. You knew it, don’t pretend you didn’t. Why did you bring me here?” his tone is accusing, but he tries to stay calm.
He should really take Mr. Singer’s advice and dispose of his car, the older man has repaired it so many times that if he says it’s time to buy a new one, then it must mean something. He’ll have to ask Gabriel for help, since he’s the only one he knows that understands cars. Bal would just tell him to buy a Tesla or something equally expensive and Meg would insist on buying a very impractical sports car. Maybe Mr. Singer has some suggestions? He will have to call him.
“Do you prefer motor oil and exhaustion gas?” Castiel tilts his head, watching the other man as he steps towards his own car. He follows.
“You know I told you I had to book an appointment to a new dentist? Because the old one retired?” Charlie just nods so he goes on “Well I may or may not have said something huh inappropriate? Not on purpose! I swear!” he moves his hands in a placating gesture.
The next morning Dean is still tired from the impromptu shift at the Roadhouse. He went home later than he wanted but at least he’s not hungover. It would’ve been bad for business if he was, since he has to meet some new clients and a headache and red eyes don’t make a good first impression.
Dean smiles softly and climbs off Baby first, then helps Cas, who honest to God stretches and yawns loudly when his feet touch the ground.
“Call me if you need anything, okay?” He had given Dean his phone number, praying that Dean would call. Dean nodded into Cas’s chest, closing his eyes. “I would also like to meet Sam. At your pace, though. I don’t want to rush anything. I want you to decide when you feel comfortable, for anything. Seriously.”
“Dean, is someone hurting you?” Dean tensed up, biting his bottom lip to the point he had broken the skin and he could taste blood. “I don’t want to talk about it.” Dean turned his back, but Cas stood up, grabbed his shoulders, and turned him around. “Dean.” Cas’s voice was raw and Dean’s knees almost gave out at the sound. “Please, please trust me. I can help you… both of you.”
“I’m fine, Ellen, thank you for worrying.” Dean took a deep breath, rubbing his eyes again. “Cas is fine. I’m at his place right now, Sam is with us. I’m feeling a little better.”
“Dean, please let me-” A loud ringing cut off Mr. Novak’s voice and Dean’s throat suddenly felt like it was closing up. Dean looked up at his eyes, and before he knew it, tears were streaming down his bruised face and they wouldn’t stop. Cas’s heart broke, and a feeling of dread spread through his body. “Dean,” He choked out, causing Dean to feel even more panic through his body.
“Can we go to your bed?” Dean whimpered, and Cas nodded. Dean kept his face hidden as he turned around and went to Cas’s room. Dean immediately went into the bathroom and shut the door behind him, and Cas let his worry consume him for a minute. Dean was so upset. More upset than he had ever seen him. He couldn’t even think about what could make him like this, what could’ve happened that he would be left this upset. He’s sure he would have heard if someone died, Dean wouldn’t be here or he would have called. Dean was here, and he was upset.
He couldn’t lie to himself though, and even if he didn’t lick the doctor’s fingers on purpose, it was something he had really liked.
“You’re very funny Dean, hilarious.” Sam rolls his eyes and finishes off his burger “Look. Hear me out. What could possibly happen if you schedule another appointment?”
“You’re unbelievable! What goes on in your brain?! I thought you weren’t using the downstairs one anymore!”
Cas keeps asking where they’re going, unable to keep the curiosity at bay, but Dean doesn’t budge and keeps repeating “You’ll see when we get there, it’s a surprise!”
Dean is so immersed into work that if it wasn’t for his giant baby brother coming in at 1 PM he would have ended up having lunch at 3 PM, or entirely skipping it.
He's known for a week what his schedule for today is, and yet he’s still studying the appointments list like it’s the first time he’s seeing it.
But he’s getting too nervous, so he reasons that he could get stuck in traffic so getting out of the house right now is a good idea. He applies a fresh coat of deodorant and checks his reflection in the mirror one last time as he wears the shirt. He looks good, he can do this.
“Nah, don’t worry. It was nice seeing you outside of those scrubs and not around the disinfectant smell.” Dean smiles easily, making a disgusted face at the mention of the disinfectant smell.
, with his eyes closed and a very peaceful expression. Castiel’s brain flatlines, but his hands keep working, ineffectively cleaning the same tooth he was done with probably what? five minutes ago?
Castiel hasn’t been able to forget Dean Winchester since the moment he saw him stepping into his clinic the week before. The accident only made it more difficult than it would’ve been anyway.
“I know the place but not which way to go from your house, Cas” he laughs “you’ll have to guide me.”
“I found a new place that makes vegetarian burgers,” Dean grimaces at that “and a delicious organic blueberry pie.” Sam smirks, satisfied at his brother’s change of expression.
“But it’s Doctor Novak! With his wife or fiancée or whatever the hell she is! I can’t serve them!” Dean followed him inside, trying his best at using his puppy dog eyes.
“Oh- Dean- Hello. I see you’re feeling well, I- thought you were sick…” Novak trails off, eyes still big, filled with surprise but also some sort of relief. Dean notices a tiny smile on the doctor’s lips, and he has to force himself to look away, tapping with the pen on the notepad.
Before he can answer, Mr. Singer says “He thinks I’ll give him a discount if he brings the car every other week.”
"Sweet." he's smiling dumbly, and Cas' intense gaze softens with another kind of warmth that resembles affection.
So what if he just didn't want to meet Cas there (he doesn't even know where there is) and there is no way he would sit inside the Continental once again. He's got standards.
They could’ve met differently, like when Dean wasn’t making a fool out of himself by saying or doing inappropriate things to his dentist.
“Ah, well... considering I spend most of my days at the clinic, I’d suggest your friend to book an appointment if he wants to see me.”
“Thanks man” he puts the plates on the tray, turns around and carefully opens the door with the elbow, walking to table 14 like he didn’t just discover one of the most interesting things about the blue eyed doctor.
He knows that's Bobby's way of saying he approves whatever this thing is. He probably thinks he'll get a discount on his dental work for his involvement anyway.
“I thought Meg was your wife, we’re square.” Dean waves him off and there’s a lull in the conversation.
“Huh, I guess I did, sorry. Didn’t sleep much last night and this new project sucked me in. What d’you got there?”
Dean notices that Novak glared at the brunette, but stayed silent. He doesn’t understand what’s happening, but that’s not his job. He shakes his head and tries to remember the food he could suggest to her.
“And you’d be right. Sorry, I was joking. What do you like? I remember you drank an American Pale Ale last time I saw you here, right? So you don’t mind a little bitterness. You can have an IPA, that’s a little more bitter, it pairs well enough with a cheeseburger. If you’re looking for something stronger, and maybe have the BBQ burger, a Stout or a Porter is a good idea. It’s more bitter but the aroma is rich and kind of smoke-y, it’s a good pair. But if you just want something nice that goes well with almost everything that’s on the menu, the Lager is your friend; it’s fresh and light and that’s probably what I'll end up having since I have to drive.”
"Hey, fuck you, I was fifteen! I obviously stopped when I grew up. I had other methods then." he wiggles his eyebrows.
“Do you get off with making me miserable? Are you a sadist, Kevin Tran? Ellen! The kid is a sadist!” he might be whining, but he won’t admit it.
Cas had texted him almost immediately after getting home that day, and they had spent the following days texting as much as they could.
Whatever happened earlier at Novak’s clinic has fried his last standing braincell, maybe. The others were gone as soon as he saw the doctor’s leg wrapped in very tight pants. He tried not to look at him but one glance was enough and now that image is burned in his mind.
Sam spots Dean’s phone and nudges it at his older brother, who rolls his eyes dramatically but picks it up and calls Novak’s clinic.
“That’s your problem. The gas pedal can’t go lower because the mat is stuck. You can’t go faster because the pedal can’t go lower.”
Castiel had never had a strong opinion on pie, but right this moment he kind of hates it because it’s the cavities’ fault that he’s going to put his hands into Mr Winchester's mouth again.
“We can’t have a second date at the Roadhouse, Cas!” he laughs, breaking eye contact to shake his head.
“I’ll have you know I go out plenty. I run every day and at least once every month I go to that bee farm outside town! Pardon me if I'm usually too tired to do anything else.” this time he really grabs a couple of peanuts, but decides to eat them and not waste them on Meg.
He wakes up later than usual, but 9 AM is still early enough to do some chores before heading to Singer's Auto Shop. He spends the morning working around the house, music loud enough to be heard in every room and singing just as loud. His neighbors never complained so it must mean he’s not
They talk while he parks the car and unloads the bags of groceries. One of the first things he does is to ask Bobby if one of these days he can pop by and get some work done on Baby. They both know he doesn’t need to go down there, because he’s got all he needs in his own garage, but there’s a difference between doing it at home alone and doing it in the shop with Bobby, having a beer together.
“You heard the boss!” and with that Kevin takes off, leaving him standing in the middle of the kitchen like an idiot.
“Oh. Right, you don’t know.” he groans and sinks into the chair “I didn’t go. I didn’t want to embarrass myself further, or really harass the guy. Yeah, yeah, keep the bitchface away, bitch. I was at the Roadhouse and Jo made me work, I couldn’t have gone anyway. But I think the universe or God hates me, because guess who showed up at one of my tables?”
