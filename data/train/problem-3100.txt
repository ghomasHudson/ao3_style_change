Then, an abrupt shiver ran coldly down his spine. The girl was kissing him and Cas was kissing right back. She had her hands around his waist and Cas had cupped her face. Their making-out was getting more intense, Dean could see tongues sliding into mouths. The hat dropped onto the floor.
Dean stands by the small sink, his bloody shirt on the floor, and holds a washcloth under the stream. Dried blood blemishes his perfect skin where the blade cut deep into him. But the wound, luckily, is gone, not even a scar left.
“Got it!” Dean said before he and Sam left for the kitchen. “Cas, are you coming?” he called and Cas followed him, helping his friend as good as he could.
“Why not? Is he dead, too.”
“You’re one to talk, Charlie,” Dean said.
“You’re a great man, Cas. And you’re good for Dean, I’m sure. I haven’t seen him this happy in a long time,” Mary said. “Oh, Dean, there you are.”
“No,” Cas says, “I’m not throwing you out if that’s what you think. Of course you can stay until you’ve found a place, saved up some money.”
“Cas, thank god!” Dean says as he comes into view. “You’re alive.”
Dean looked down. “Sh—”
“Yes, sure,” Dean replies. He doesn’t back away or anything.
“Yeah,” Dean replies, a bit hoarsely but his pupils are wide and he lazily drags at his own cock.
There’s yelling, appearing closer with every second passing and then one of the prison guards is thrown across the hallway on the other side of his bars.
“Well, I’ve been ignoring my mother’s phone calls for almost a week now and every time my phone makes a sound I’m immediately stressed out, fearing it could be her again,” he said. “I feel awful for behaving this way but I don’t think I’m strong enough to face my problems yet.”
“This is silly,” Cas says and just as he wants to remove his fingers from the glass it moves an inch to his right.
“What about the friend they were with?”
He doesn’t say anything, just nods, and turns around on the bench and begins to organize his sheets. He’ll show them. He’ll show everyone. He’ll show his father, he’ll show Marv and everyone who’s ever doubted his abilities.
“I’m not telling him anything, don’t you worry,” he reassures him.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas asks and Dean gestures him to turn right but a demon jumps out from an unlit corner.
“There’s much about him to like,” Cas answered for Dean with a smirk. Sam made a wry face at that.
It’s actually more than okay; Cas turns out to be a great kisser. He uses just the right amount of tongue and his light stubble is tickling him when he moves to Dean’s neck. It’s really getting too hot in his sleeping bag now as Cas sucks the spot under his ear while Dean cards his fingers through soft hair, letting out silent gasps every now and then. This is good, actually, and Dean doesn’t even waste a thought why it shouldn’t be. He hums, content, but then—
The door swings open and Mrs. Cooper catches Dean having her daughter in a tight grip.
“Did he make you gay?” Mrs. Novak interrupted Dean. “Castiel, is this why you gave up on everything you had here, because your friend seduced you?”
“And now she’s a killer,” Dean concludes. “Apropos of this—how do we kill her?”
“Maybe because you’re looking at him.”
“And produce unnecessary waste? Sammy, I thought you were committed to protecting the environment.”
Charlie glared at him.
The only skin Michael ever shows is that of his forearms when he takes off his jacket to roll up his shirt sleeves. And who can resist a man in a waistcoat, its snug fit hinting on a broad, muscular chest underneath it, suspenders begging to playfully be snapped. Expensive shoes, certainly handmade, and tailored pants round off the ensemble. His outfit never changes, yet the thirst for bootlegger Michael continues to be insatiable.
“I’ll do anything as long as you’ll forgive me,” Dean says.
“How about tomorrow?”
“And this was a month ago?”
If he’d wanted that, he could’ve gone on one of those cruises for singles after all. And she’s not really his type. More like the mom type.
He tries to focus on Sam’s voice, the only steady thing in his troubled life, calming. He gulps around the lump in his throat and, hoarsely, he says, “The Empty.”
When Castiel got home, his brother called him from the dining room where he was sitting at the table.
They clean up quickly and then they go to sleep, together, Cas lying pressed against Dean’s side, both of them still naked and Cas never wants this night to end.
Also, the biking was another kind of workout and Cas was glad to get some diversion from running. Yet, when he got back home again, there was not much else to do. He had spent the last three weeks catching up on TV shows on Netflix and Dean had shown him the most important movies from recent years, but staring at a screen for hours, day in day out, wasn’t really a satisfying occupation.
“Bye, Dean.”
“Why, though, if you don’t mind me asking?” Cas says, trying to be as polite as possible.
“Yes, Cas. I think we can help you.”
He feels bad, however, for dragging Rowena down this road but how was he supposed to know they would be coming for his friends, too? Dean, on the other hand, appears to be quite calm about everything. Still, they should rehearse the upcoming interview with Naomi and Uriel or whomever they’re going to send next to get their stories straight.
“I’m not good,” he says.
“I missed you too, Dean. I’m so glad to be here,” Cas replied.
“So,” Charlie says and puts down her glass, “what’s the issue with you and…his name is Dean, right?”
“I like it,” Jack says, his grin all shiny teeth.
Tessa slapped a hand over her mouth. “Ooh, I’m sorry, Cas. You know, the way you’re talking about him and the fact that you’re living together, I just assumed… Gosh, this is so embarrassing.”
“Yes. Sorry for the rollercoaster.”
“Do you still feel it?”
He punches the button for the ground floor and begins, “So….” He didn’t actually have a plan about where to go from there and trails off.
His relationship with Dean was also going really well. Charlie and Dorothy were very supportive, of course, but he hadn’t dared to tell anyone else yet about the change of his relationship status. He’d been talking to Meg twice in the meantime but hadn’t been able to bring up the courage to tell her. She would probably tell Michael and he would tell their parents and then everyone else would know and make up some a strange story about how their deacon had taken off to live in sin with his
irresponsible. He also knows about the reasons I’m leaving.”
“You sure she’s still yours?” Dean says, entering, and Sam gets up to give him a hug. “Hasn’t she been spending more time here than at your place lately?”
Dean almost choked on his water. Cas hadn’t seemed to have any interest in getting a girlfriend since Meg dumped him.
“Why?”
“I think Sam’s found a purpose in doing this job for you in the meantime,” Dean says with a twinkle in his eye.
“Yeah, see you later, Donna. Doug, it was nice meeting you.” He follows them with his eyes as the couple walk towards the small stage he knows is Cas’s handiwork.
“How nice of him,” Cas says and Dean nods quietly.
“Nobody will care if I go someplace else.”
“Okay, I guess that’s our call. We’re going to bed. Night, guys,” Charlie announced and Dean helped her get Dorothy onto her feet.
“And I still love you, Cas.” She paused and Cas took her hands in his. They were so small and soft, just as he had remembered. “My love for you hasn’t lessened…though it has changed.”
“Perhaps.”
“Ready for what?”
A flush of embarrassment blooms on his face, prompted by Cas’s praise. He’s good, yes, but only a once a generation artist might be able to capture the sophisticated wonder of Cas’s entire being. Dean is not worthy.
He storms out of the room before Cas has the chance to reply but hears him sigh behind his back.
Later Cas wouldn’t know why, at that moment, he’d thought this would be a good idea, but he felt light-headed and warm against Dean’s side, so he leaned forward and kissed him. He wasn’t surprised at all that Dean, in response, angled his head to fit their lips better together. A tiny part of his brain wanted him to stop immediately before things got more serious but, gladly, the alcohol in his system restricted its authority right now. If their mouths weren’t basically glued to each other and his tongue pleasurably caught in Dean’s mouth, he would’ve probably done something stupid, like voiced his concern.
Cas only hummed faintly in response before withdrawing from Dean’s embrace. “I think I’d like to take a bath to clear my head,” he said.
“His name is Dean,” he starts, “we met a few months ago after he moved to KC.”
Cas was scheduled to meet up with his study group and was rushing to put his things together as he quickly stopped by his room after the course he’d just had. Dean’s door was open and Cas saw him hunched over his desk, concentrating on the paper Cas knew was due in a few days.
“How was that?”
That’s a word Dean hasn’t ever used to describe something he did—Dean thought: why stop there, why stop now? His life won’t ever be as easy as it is now. Sure, there’s this ever-looming threat of prison if someone were to find out that he only married Cas for him to gain permanent residence…but apart from that things are going well. He has a roof over his head and a nice one so. He isn’t starving despite his job as a waiter paying him minimum wage and, most importantly, he didn’t have to come crawling back into his father’s house.
“And if I had anything to say in it, she’d be your wife by now,” Dean says.
“Evening, Mr. Graham,” Dean said.
“Thank you,” Dean said.
“To see the bridge?”
They stand next to each other in the elevator in silence, Sam rather because he’s still impressed by the size of the building than being nervous about meeting his brother’s husband for the first time. Dean, however, hopes Sam won’t see right through their act. So far they haven’t had to deal with anyone who’s known Dean his whole life.
“Uh, I don’t know. Dark hair maybe. My high school girlfriend Lisa had dark hair and so had my first real girlfriend Tessa. Victor too…well, he’s black. But I don’t think that I have a special type. Whoever floats my boat, I guess.”
“This conversation isn’t over, Dean,” Sam insists.
So much can change in four years. And everything started right here, on the Love Boat, she thinks and her giggle earns her a weird look from the passengers who are next in line.
“You’re gonna be a great priest,” Charlie said, squeezing Cas’s shoulder.
“Maybe,” Cas said and blushed, sheepishly avoiding Dean’s eyes.
“Are you allowed a social life while you’re at the seminary?”
He loved being outside when the weather was this fine. Sure, there were other parks in the city but none of those was as quiet as this one and he didn’t want all the other people around, sunbathing and playing volleyball.
“Then give me your number so I can text you the address,” Dean told him. “Alright,” he concluded after Cas had dictated him the phone number. “I’ll be off work at five. See you later.”
Cas looked at both Charlie and Dorothy, then back to Dean. “You say it.”
Cas shrugs. “Not like this, I suppose. My brothers and sisters just disappeared over time. And we weren’t particularly close in the first place.” He puts the book back on the shelf and moves from the floor to the free spot on the sofa. “What about your father? You mentioned him before.”
Dean nods. “Yes.”
Cas sighs in relief.
Dean steered Cas out into the garden where his little brother was relaxing in a hammock, reading a book. Dean put his index finger on his lips, urging Cas to stay quiet, and gave the hammock a strong push which caused Sam to almost fall out.
“Was he, was he mad or something?”
“You’re crazy,” Dean says, “you should go now.” He wants to shut the door but Ketch pushes a custom-made shoe in the way.
The hand slides over Cas’s stomach, ever so lightly, over his hipbone and seizing a handful of thigh. Cas lets out a whine, pushing Dean’s face away from his.
Dean purses his lips. “Yes,” he says and they shake hands.
“Cas, please come home with me, okay?” Dean said after a while.
Dean doesn’t want to take that possibility into consideration. He isn’t ready yet. “Maybe he was on a boat,” he says, “maybe that’s why you couldn’t find his clothes.”
“Yeah, ain’t this a coincidence,” Dean muses.
“Clients are not allowed back there,” Benny says, “Cas, you’re not—” Then the door opens and Dean comes to halt in the doorway.
“Take good care of him,” Balthazar says and gives Dean’s back an appreciative rub.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Me?” he says. “I’m afraid there isn’t much to tell. You’ve seen my house, my art, I already told you I have a brother in town. I’m not that interesting.”
With an abrupt change the orchestra is playing at maximum forte, then the connection to the speakers breaks and Cas is tumbling backwards, wet feet slipping across the tile, and he just barely manages not to fall.
Later, when they got to the common area at Dean and Benny’s, Cas was really anxious about meeting so many new people all at once. Dean he had already met, but then there was Benny who was quite intimidating at first sight, but Charlie reassured him that he was in fact just a big, soft teddy bear. Other new people were Garth and Ash. Garth was a lean, awkward guy who made Cas feel much better about himself as he saw how well Garth got along with all the others. He also learned that Garth shared Charlie’s love for D&D which was what they first bonded over. Ash, on the other hand, was much more confident with himself. Cas supposed he had to be with that kind of hairstyle. Who even wore a mullet post-eighties? Ash and Charlie had the same major and Cas soon gave up on trying to follow their discussion about computer stuff.
Castiel suspected the two of them were a couple and it made something in his brain twinge when he thought that through too much. He wasn’t going to debate the morality of the same being from different universes being in a relationship with each other. It just wasn’t worth the resulting migraine.
"Good, sounds good. Like you know what you’re getting yourself into."
“I have too,” Castiel protested, “and I’ve picked up enough from you to be able to hold my own in a conversation, Dean.”
“Hannah wasn't either, if that makes you feel any better. She'd have lost her job if she didn't agree, and I'd have lost money for the charity. We're going to do so much good with that money, you have to believe me.”
Dean had locked himself away in his back office when Sam turned up to Friday drinks. He hadn’t been in a few Fridays, but Dean always seemed to understand. That was Sam’s memory of their interactions. Sam feared sometimes he was slowly losing his grip on what Earth was, what being human was. Ruling the demons felt somehow increasingly
with a horse?” came a voice from behind Sam.
“I didn’t know you did this as well as all your other jobs.”
She was smiling widely at him and Dean kind of figured he might know where this conversation was going. Some of the patrons – not many but some – seemed to think he was as much a part of the experience of visiting the bar as the old-fashioned drinks they sold.
“That wasn't about me being
“Sorry to hear that, kid,” Dean said from behind Castiel. “Why don’t you come sit down?” Dean gently guided Jack over to the couch. “What’s up?” He crouched down in front of Jack. Castiel noted that Dean had rid himself of his jacket finally and done up his shirt all before Jack could see him as he had been.
“I’ll look into it, methods of keeping him... interested.”
Sam itched to pick up his phone again and Google
“Yeah, guys? I’m going to, ew,” Sam winced and moved over to the front door. “You two have fun, er, safe fun?”
It was here he finally got a quick look at the full cast he was in this film was.
“I’m not a one-time thing kind of person, Dean,” Castiel let him know, while he gently massaged the back of Dean’s left thigh, and then his right. “I wouldn’t want you seeing someone else either.”
Dean sat up at this and scooted around so he was facing Castiel. “Okay, we must have rattled your brain or something because the Castiel I know wouldn’t suggest using a powerful angelic relic for the purposes of
“Ha!” Donna took another mouthful of wine, and then another, and then a third. “The script is a mess. You know, I've heard Chuck's being put into rehab?”
Castiel had been around a lot more recently, almost constantly. Dean was feeling the happy hum of having him around so much, even though he did still miss seeing his brother frequently.
“What happened to make you move across country so suddenly?”
“Thanks for that,” Cas pointed a thumb in the direction of the upstairs. “They were both really happy.”
“That's fucked up, man. Fucked up and oddly... sweet.” Dean shook his head and let out a low growl. “But it does finally explain everything. I've felt so
Sam took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly. He appeared to Dean to be a little dazed. Sam probably didn’t even realize how much of the Earth was now part of the garden.
“Remember that year you and Jess got engaged? You came back to visit for mom’s birthday and we talked after? I just knew something had to change. Okay, so it took you and me a little longer to get back to being best bros, but I figured I should start with what I could change: myself. But it took me longer than that still. I was feeling...guilty? Dad was so proud of me being a mechanic like him. Going into law enforcement though,” Dean flashed Sam a smile. “It just felt right. I like being a cop. I like helping people.”
“What's your back-up plan for when this film fails and you're exposed as a fraud? Being a child actor is one thing, but helming a film rumored to be the most expensive since
The first group of demons approached Sam two years after Chuck's ugly demise. Things were falling apart in Hell. The demons were falling apart and the sections of Hell required to house all of the souls were slowly but surely cracking up.
“I... was thinking we'd just get room service?” Dean suggested with a wince. “Not because,” he added hurriedly, “that I don't want to be seen with you. But it can be a bit of a pain in the ass going into public with me sometimes.”
“I thought you said this
“Er, right,” Anna stumbled. “The world of the centaur...icorns.”
Castiel let out a laugh and maneuvered his pinky finger into Dean as well. “I think you’re doing it on purpose now.” He sped up and jammed his fingers in rougher, more like a finger punch. “It’s funny how soft you are here,” he wiggled his fingers, “while being so hard here,” Castiel nodded towards Dean’s dick.
Claire pulled a face and shook her head, sending her blonde hair flying. “No. Buy him jerky. He likes that more.”
Dean's heart seemed to skip a beat.
“It’s cool if you want to stay.” He didn’t want to ask Castiel to stay, didn’t want to pressure him. He did want him to stay though. “We got the room for the night, and I told my, ahem, roommate I wouldn’t be back tonight.”
“Hi Claire,” Dean called over to Claire who was sitting quietly reading. Considering her previous excitement at Dean coming over for the evening, she was doing a remarkable job at pretending she hadn’t realized he’d arrived.
The remaining Castiel’s not currently balls-deep in Dean were mostly palming themselves through their open pant zippers. Some contemplated the tableau before them wishing they were Castiel Four. Others considered what they would be doing differently if they were currently the ones hard dicking Dean. For Castiel One it was all a little overwhelming though. He was struggling slightly with feelings of jealousy, even though it was only he and he alone in the room with Dean.
“Worry about that tomorrow,” Castiel advised, kissing Dean again.
Castiel didn’t get a verbal response to his out pour of love. Dean’s lips wrapped around his cock two seconds later were as much of a thank you as he needed though.
They sat and took that in a moment.
Besides the fact they were not filming on location so that the film could retain its self-proclaimed environmentally friendly credentials, half the people he was meant to be acting with were currently made of little green balls on sticks. He thought he'd actually be working with all the cast together, however, it turned out that because of the special way they had to film the humans playing the centauricorns, the humans and centauricorns all had to be shot separately.
“Sure, sugar. And you?”
“It’s a neutral space,” Sam said at the time, with what exuberance he could gather together in a situation that involved his dying brother. “A truly neutral space. For Heaven, Hell, and anything in between.”
“I like people with large penises.”
“Fuck,” Dean hissed with arousal. Just the mention of it making him long for something inside him. His cock was in agreement too. “Very, very okay.”
“We have that time travel device in the storeroom now. We could use it to bring multiple versions of me into one time point.”
“Here's to that,
“Yeah, yeah, I don’t get any of that law stuff. But I’m happy for you. You’re happy, I’m happy.”
Castiel took Jack off and helped him wash up and change into clean clothes. He had Jack in bed and was reading him a story when Dean popped into his bedroom, a glass of ginger tea with him.
“Been starving your baby brother there, Dean?” Donna winked at him and Sam smiled, mind slightly panicking that she was flirting with him. He wasn’t ready for anything like that.
“I'm not sure I ever said that, Uncle Bobby.”
“It'll be okay,” he whispered to Castiel. “They're gonna love you just as much as I do.”
The real draw for Dean was that his co-star was to be a veteran of the action-adventure genre, Anna Milton. There was absolutely no way he could turn down working with her and not regret it.
“You were in hell?”
“If they kids managed it, there must be some knack to getting it right?”
“Do you want me to go?”
“I'm sorry,” Jody said with a laugh, “Did you say
“We can vote you in, Castiel, and then vote again at a later date a few centuries from now? That was how they dealt with most of the humans’ politics in my universe.” He frowned momentarily at that, reflecting on some memory Castiel was never going to be able to fully appreciate. There was no way for any of them to fully appreciate the universes each other had come from.
As they still had no leading female, the centauricorn actors hadn't even started filming their stuff yet. It meant Dean got to spend a lot of time with Donna and Jody and grew to like them very quickly.
“Good idea. I want to hear all about your adventures, Dean. And get to know you as well, Castiel.”
“You glow after orgasm,” Castiel noted tenderly.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Sam whispered as loudly as he dared.
“It’s a break-up, Sammy, not the end of your life. You’ll bounce back.”
“Because we don’t want to let go.”
“Is she your... wife?” He leaned away from Castiel, thoughts quickly coming to him about how he was a home wrecker without even knowing it. That would explain it. His wife got him a role in the film she was in charge of. They kept it quiet so the other execs didn't find out... oh crap.
“Mostly if I want to retrain.” That was the crux of the problem Sam was having lately. “I have the money to take classes, and maybe I can work it to do that and work freelance in the meantime. My ex and I were saving for a house. When we split we split the money from the fund equally.” Because sure, while lately he had put more in than Jess, she’d also supported him through his extended education. In the end, separating the money equally had seemed the fairest way. If she’d been his client, he would have been pushing for an equal split at a minimum.
“Well,” Bela explained, “If your script has a green cover, you're a human, if you have a blue cover, you're now a centauricorn.”
Crowley, Tran, and Talbot seemed like a tough company by reputation. Being interviewed by the named partners was novel, but given the size of the firm shouldn’t have been such a surprise to Sam. They weren’t any different to many of the lawyers he’d dealt with in the past. He’d felt confident and in control batting down their questions, and even earning himself a nickname before the hour was out.
John’s illness and subsequent surgeries, repeated hospitalizations, restrictions to his lifestyle… the whole lot. It had taken its toll. He’d seemed on the mend the last time Sam had seen him alive.
At the end of the day, he'd return to his hotel room and also return to Castiel.
The only thing left to decide now was did Castiel go for the unmarked butt cheek or make a start on Dean’s shoulders?
“Let me get this straight: you are happy to hit on random guys at bars, with the knowledge you might get rejected, but you’re not prepared to tell your best friend that you’re head over heels in love with him?”
“Younger, older, what does it matter? I’m still always gonna be the more attractive brother, Sammy.”
“I figured out why you seemed familiar,” Castiel nodded at the photo hanging on the wall. It was a family portrait taken on a holiday they’d been on when Sam was 14. “Dean left his wallet at my house last night. I just came by to give it back to him.
“Warming, hey? Orange flavor? Good choice.” He pumped a good quantity into his palm and then proceeded to stroke his hand down between Dean's pert buttocks, smearing the lube around his hole. Slowly Castiel moved up and down over Dean's hole, but still didn't go within.
“I still… still,” Sam sighed and pushed his hair back off his face. “I have feelings for her.”
“That's the one.”
To his left Sam heard Dean groan.
“If you really feel that way, why bother with it at all?”
“Agreed,” one of the Balthazars spoke up, slapping a hand on the table.
Castiel had been happy to comply.
“Traditional protocol at this point would be for us to get dressed up, go out, share a meal and an activity of some sort.”
There was regret, so much regret, when he looked at so many of the gathered angels. The group who had agreed to help him rebuild Heaven. The group who were aiming to make him leader of them all.
Dean had fingers on Castiel’s shirt buttons and was opening them up, nosing at Castiel’s neck.
Castiel stared into Sam’s eyes unblinkingly. “I’m not sure I’ve had a relationship previously that would qualify as… an ex.”
“Boys,” Jody cut in, “as interesting as this discussion into your subconsciousness is, we really need to focus on figuring out who and why someone would want you out of commission for so long.”
“It isn’t up to us to fix him,” Sam said, looking up from the notes he’d written as Castiel sat down opposite him.
“It's television man, most likely I get in for one or two episodes of a show, and then that show gets canceled anyway,” Dean argued, trying to be the practical one.
“So you knew about this?” Mary asked archly, turning to Sam. “And you didn't tell us?”
“This is going to be the end of my career, before it's even begun!” he wept.
"That's not… an impossible idea," Castiel said slowly. "Angels exist in parallel universes still. There has to be one with enough to assist us."
The girl looked Castiel up and down, more in awe of his outfit than the fact he’d appeared in thin air right behind her. “Is that a trench coat? I saw one in a museum once.” She looked back at Dean then back to Castiel. “Wait, you two do this dressing up thing as like.... a coupley thing? That’s adorable. Is there a club? Are there more of you?” She looked back between the beer and Dean and back again. “I think I’m drunk?”
“It wasn't horse porn!” Dean huffed back under his breath.
“We’re just going to talk.”
“To get off on me discussing aftercare? That takes a special boy.”
Jess. He had to stop thinking about Jess.
Dean laughed. “Thought you’d like it.”
“Are you still friends with them?” Donna's eyes were alight with intrigue, hanging on Dean's every word.
“No, I mean, yes? No, wait.” Sam’s cheek twitched. He took a deep breath and tried again. “Yeah, the seat’s free. Sorry, just all up in,” Sam tapped his temples as if that explained all.
When time came, Castiel Two gave his goodbyes before he was yanked out of their timeline, copper tea kettle device in hand. Three followed and then the others all in order too until only Castiel Ten remained, having arrived slightly after the others originally.
, all settling there, so close. “Good,” Dean nodded to himself.
“I’m telling ya, you’ll love coming back home.”
Claire gave no sign of hearing him. “I got a present for you and Jack,” Dean tried again. That got Claire’s attention as she shot up to join her brother.
Dean shrugged. “This is why I’m just the humble lit teacher and you’re the actual writer, I guess.”
“Air Force One, by any chance?”
“Good boy.” Castiel rewarded Dean with a third finger.
Dean was sat on the couch shining his shoes. Sam had hoped Dean would either be gone or still in bed, so of course the universe conspired to ensure he was right there when Sam walked in.
“You should come out to Poland and spend some time with me there,” he eventually suggested.
, for this film, if you get in that booth now.”
“You introduced me to that waitress as your
“And you're dating your co-star?” Bobby barked.
“I feel the same.” Castiel smiled sadly back at Dean. “I have a lot to thank Hannah for, getting me involved in all this.”
“We didn’t do anything wrong. We’re both single human beings and...”
Charlie and Dean ended up with a slice of both pie, with ice cream. Sam opted for the cherry, figuring that at least had some fruit involved.
They decided it was for the best if they said their goodbyes at the hotel in case any cameras were at the airport.
“That's the idea, fella!” Ash said with great enthusiasm. “Theoretically after this, we should have every possible angle. We can then just extrapolate and if they need you from a certain angle they didn't get in filming, we just add it in.”
Sam nodded. “More than anything,” he paused. “At the time, at least.” He didn’t want to feel confused, conflicted, not over this, not over Jess. But there was no getting around the fact that he did feel out of sorts.
though.
Sam dropped his fork on his half-eaten plate. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d actually been around to celebrate their dad’s birthday. He’d always called his mom to talk on the day, check in with her.
Dean was still nodding as Castiel finally came, spraying thick, creamy ropes of come and painting up Dean’s lightly freckled chest, just as he’d promised. Castiel slid sideways after so he could gather up Dean into a hug. They were both a mess, and both the happier for it.
“Oh, my sweet little puppy, there’s so much for you to learn,” Charlie cooed and stroked his hair.
it says. Right, he’d already forgotten.
Athena drops them off right by the harbor but Cas isn’t very eager to get back on board yet. They thank their guide for the great experience and she wishes them a save trip home.
When Dean stirred awake in the morning, he had a slight headache. He hadn’t slept particularly well, vexed by distorted memories of the night before. For a Sunday it was still too early to get out of bed but Dean was restless. He really wanted to be happy about what happened but he couldn’t let himself before he knew how Cas thought about this. Did he regret it? He had seemed weird afterwards.
“Hm,” he says, almost coughing, “you didn’t skimp on the booze.”
Gunnar was half draped over Dean as he kissed him again, careful not to crush him under his weight. He gently pushed the T-shirt over Dean’s head and placed kisses from his jaw downwards along his neck to his collarbone. “You too,” Dean breathed out and pulled at the hem of Gunnar’s shirt. Dean had to gasp for air at the sight of Gunnar’s well-shaped athlete’s body.
“Yeah, only my head hurts a little,” Sam says.
When his arms are finally free again, his hands find Dean’s tie in a swift, urgent move, unhooking it and quickly moving on to his shirt buttons. Dean follows his example and gets to work at Cas’s shirt.
“Suit yourself, Sammy,” Dean says without taking his eyes off the TV screen.
“You could make breakfast when you’re up already!” Charlie’s voice called from the other tent.
“No?”
“Do you mean,” Cas says, “are you our new sheriff? Sheriff Jody Mills—is that what you’re saying?”
“The only thing I don’t get is how you just appeared out of nowhere, Jody. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad—you saved me. You saved Cas.”
“This is looking really good already,” Balthazar compliments. “But there’s still room for improvement. First of all, you’re standing way too far apart.”
His grip on Dean’s hands tightens. “I’m not.”
As if on cue, Dean’s phone rang, the sheriff telling him to come to the morgue. “The autopsy’s finished. Come on, Cas, we gotta go.”
“Oooh, wait, I can do something!” Dean said and waved his hands so Eileen would look at him.
“A wee boy,” Rowena agrees.
“Hi, Dad.”
“It was so much easier when I still had Meg. I even wanted to sleep with her but then she broke up.”
“Dean?”
“Great.”
“Have you made friends within Pastor Boyle’s church?”
Her phone rings. “Excuse me,” she says and moves to the other side of the car.
If Dean had ever had a doubt that Gunnar had taken an interest in him that went beyond their shared enthusiasm about classic cars, it was definitely crushed now.
“Don’t mention it,” Cas says, “and don’t listen to your brother. We are glad to have you here.”
” she replied, wrenching the word strangely in her mouth. “She’s a girl and a friend who I occasionally like to make out with.”
“Why are you asking?” he inquired carefully.
“Whatever… A person is dead and we have to find what killed her,” Dean insisted.
“Hey,” Dean says, “I thought you might be hungry. I’m starving. Sandwich?” He offers the man a plate who eagerly accepts it and starts to inspect the meal with interest.
“Well, then I have to make your first time feel really good for you, don’t I?” He spoke slowly and bit his lip as he lowered his free hand to work Dean’s jeans open as well.
Dean’s face was buried in the crook of his neck, hot exhales dampening his skin there, whereas Cas drunk in the intoxicating scent of Dean’s hair with every faltering breath.
“So,” she says and rounds her desk. Dean gently closes the door behind him as not to startle him. “Look, you’re not in trouble. On the contrary—you just saved this man’s life.” Dean comes to stand next to him. “We just want to help you but you gotta give us something. Let’s start with a name.”
Drawing every fine shadow, Dean accentuates the muscles that lie under the impeccable skin of Cas’s broad chest, every single one a work of art in itself. Each long finger is crafted with fine lines on the paper, hands attached to strong, defined arms. Dean remembers what they felt like holding and warming him in the chilly waters of the Pacific. He draws Cas’s sharp chin, thick lips that kissed him so hungrily this morning, big and kind eyes, full dark hair.
“Yes, I’m… Well, actually I’m not surprised. There have always been people like Zeke in my church. I just wasn’t aware he happens to be one of those.”
He kinda hates himself for accidentally opening up to Cas about his issues the other day. He usually doesn’t do chick flick moments. Definitely not with people who don’t even know him and who won’t get him anyway. Cas surely isn’t one of those because otherwise he wouldn’t have done what he did. He would have known Dean would really, really want to become sheriff when it was announced that they were calling for applications.
They catch Sam and Eileen staring at them. Dean forgot to at least attempt signing what he said for her but he doubts his sign language skills would have been good enough anyway but he assumes Sam has kindly done this for him.
“Fine,” he sighs and Sam and Jack’s faces light up.
“Well, yeah, I guess. He’s a good cop. A very good one. I… Wait, I see what you’re doing there.”
“You said it yourself last night: this scheme could earn you a prison sentence if we’re not careful.”
“And what would that proof? Anyone could stage that. We know it happened, though.”
She turns on the lights and Cas follows after Meg. There is a small corridor, a door which assumingly leads to the bathroom. The room is quite spacious. There is a big double bed, two comfy chairs and a coffee table. Dark wood and colors add to the atmosphere.
“You broke my heart.”
Dean loosened his tie and pulled it over his head, then took off his coat and proceeded to unbutton his dress shirt.
Slowly, Dean’s fantasy merged into sweet dreams and the pillow he was cuddling became Cas’s warm body against his.
“I shouldn’t let Dean wait any longer,” Cas said then. “Thanks for listening, Father.”
“If I’m making you uncomfortable, you have to tell me,” he says as he opens the belt first, then his fly.
He tugs it from Dean’s grip and puts on the rest of his clothes. Meanwhile, Dean finds his charger but it takes a while before the phone powers up.
“He’s putting burgers on the grill,” Mary told him and Dean signaled Cas to follow him into the backyard.
as safe as they can be, Cas still alive, everyone still alive, and Dean keeps asking himself what the hell he’s waiting for. It’s now or never.
“I’ve been waiting for you to ask me. You’re an awful host.”
Meg is the first to speak up. “Thanks for the history lesson, Clarence.”
“I didn’t expect that,” Cas says and they both take a glass of champagne off the tray the waiter is offering them.
“We should fight over who gets what.”
He’s writing a lot about Sammy and how he’s doing in school and that he’s landed a major role in the school play and he’s so proud of his little brother. He recalls John failing to attempt the performance, resulting in a huge fight between him and Mary. He can still hear their voices from downstairs, keeping him up for hours even after John had left.
“What am
“Claire told her mother she’s staying with her friend when she came to stay with me,” Cas explains.
So who cares what one Cas Novak thinks of him. Cas claiming Dean is secretly into guys doesn’t make it true.
Cas’s eyes darted up to him at the word ‘friend.’ Then a slight smile appeared on his face. “Okay,” he said shyly.
“Claire, where did you learn that?” Cas asks earnestly.
“I like it too, the atmosphere of the house. I’ve never been inside, though,” she says, finishing her own line of thought.
Dean stands in the doorway as he watches Cas walk away. The last twenty-four hours have been the best of his life.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Cas murmured into the fabric of Dean’s shirt.
If he were already used to living in this house, he wouldn’t bother to switch on the lights but he isn’t and running into some obstacle and risking an accident wouldn’t make him less awake than he already is.
“I don’t even know if he’s single…or into guys. I mean, he looked at slave Leia the same way you do!”
“Nothing,” he replied.
“I upset you…sorry,” Kelly said guiltily.
“Where did he go?”
“They’re your family, Cas. I don’t think they hate you. They’re probably just as sad as you are.”
“You,” Cas says, spinning around with excitement, just as if he’s been waiting to be asked this all along.
A trenchcoated back is turned towards him. Castiel doesn't turn around. Instead he keeps tracing his carved-in name on the table.
With a toast to everyone involved, Cas is released from stage and Dean almost breaks his glass, quickly as he puts it down, and hurries to get to Cas.
“I know that. He doesn’t, though. And your rummaging in his dirty laundry didn’t help either.”
“I’m, uh… There’s something you don’t know about me yet.”
‘You are who you are, Dean.’ What the hell was that supposed to mean?
“Get naked then,” Aaron told him as he pulled out a bottle of lube from his bag.
“Ah, look at them. They’re so young and naïve and have no idea what real life is like,” Dean said as he watched a group of students passing by.
Why was he still here? What kind of a creep was he even that he listened to his best friend masturbating?
The complimenting and smartphone slide show was followed by comparing the ceremonies of Duke and Notre Dame and Sam’s contribution of describing the pictures he had seen of this the event at Stanford. He hadn’t even had his first day at the university yet and was already wasting thoughts on his graduation.
Cas gives in and nods and provides him with a pillow and a blanket.
“Honestly, though,” Rowena says then, “I’m surprised he isn’t another musician. Or do you play any instruments, Dean?”
Dean nods. “What you got there?”
After that they got into the car and headed towards their dinner location. Cas expected them to be able to get there in about forty minutes. He looked out of the windshield for a while, making sure Dean was taking the right way, until his phone rang.
John glanced at the hand dismissively and mumbled, without accepting it, “Hey.”
“I am a member of the clergy, Dean. I’m somewhere in between right now, you know. I became ordained a deacon nine months ago and now I’m waiting to be approved for priesthood.”
Dean has both hands in Cas’s hair. It’s so soft and warm. Then, one hand slides down onto his chest. He can feel firm muscles underneath the shirt.
“Dean, none of this will make you any less of a man if that’s what you’re worried about,” Cas says, his thumb stroking over Dean’s cheek.
Then he took to elevator down to the front desk, checked out and brought everything to his car. When he was driving home, he thought it was probably time to ultimately fill the hole Cas had left in his heart and what better way to do this was there than asking his girlfriend to take the next step in their relationship. He was certain the right time had come; he would finally ask Cassie to move into his house. And who knew what kind of strange ideas concerning a certain person he might be having, should he continue living on his own.
The whole world was spinning when Dean’s legs gave in and he collapsed onto the floor. Tears were falling from his eyes but the only thing he could think of was how Cas was helplessly begging him to stay with him. His pupils were gradually becoming unable to focus and dared to roll back inside the sockets but then…
“What’s your point?”
Last, but definitely not least, Cas comes out and someone on the back woos and Dean’s heart warms.
“It’s alright. I knew from the beginning that we’d expire before the semester ends.” She took a deep breath. “Anyway, I have to run. The lab’s waiting for me. Dean, are you coming with me?”
Cas was taken aback somehow by her openness but also thankful that she invited him to sit with her. “Thank you, Rachel, I’d like that. I’m Castiel. Nice to meet you.” He followed her to one of the rows in the front and Rachel introduced him to her friends. They all were part of a group of Catholic students at Duke and suggested he could join if he’d like. He told them he’d think about it.
“Nope,” Cas told him and kissed him once more and Dean seized him by the back of his head as he leaned back into the pillows, taking Cas down with him.
Dean is standing next to Benny who must’ve just told him a great joke because Dean’s laughter travels all the way to Cas’s ears, drowning out even the ever-present Christmas music. They are best buddies and Cas often envies Benny for all the time he gets to talk to Dean, their friendship, all easy-going. Cas wishes he could have conversations with Dean like that, get to know him and find out about the things Dean likes and maybe even show him some of the affection he has for him. In reality, though, all he ever does around Dean is getting awkward and fidgety and making either too much eye contact or too little. Dean most certainly thinks Cas is a total weirdo and on the really bad days he’s convinced Dean hates him altogether. But then again, when Cas is left having no doubt about Dean never going to like him back, small things happen, throwing him a line and pulling him out of his misery, like Dean complimenting Cas on something or Dean just seeming straight up thrilled to see him after a long time of not running into each other. Sometimes Cas’ll have to e-mail Dean something work-related and when the reply contains more smiley faces than necessary, he’ll spend all day pondering if there might be a deeper meaning behind those emojis, eventually leaving work in high spirits, firmly believing that Dean is actually into him. Until Dean gives him the cold shoulder again and Cas’s confidence crumbles to pieces. His crush on Dean is like a never-ending rollercoaster ride.
“At least the neighbors are nice,” Claire tells him with a smirk. “I should probably finish my homework now,” she says and leaves the room.
“Dean, are you in love with him?”
“I’m actually really interested. I’ve never been backstage anywhere,” Dean says. “But, uh, Cas, what are you doing?”
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” Father Jim said.
The men don’t talk with each other, obviously, and when they’ve eaten up, Athena sends them to pack their stuff and get ready to leave.
Still, something seemed to be missing for Cas and Dean was pretty sure what it was.
“I promised Emma to help her find a car. I’ve got a few in my yard that could work for her. They’re old but in good shape and I’d rather she get one from me than buy some over-priced piece of crap that’ll need fixing a week later.”
“Captain Donna Hanscum, at your service,” she laughs and does a small salute. “You know me, always loved the sea.”
“No problem,” he says and quickly kneels down to retrieve his water bottle from his bag and takes a demonstratively long gulp to indicate this conversation is over.
He thinks it wouldn’t hurt to wash his face either but he hasn’t heard Dean going back to his room and seeing him when they leave later is soon enough so he moistens one of the towels on his bed with some water from his drinking bottle and wipes his face with it.
“Cas, no offence, but we all know your problem is that it’s hard for you to show emotion.”
“Do you think she started to haunt me because I have a daughter her age and got a divorce?”
“Good night,” Jody says and hauls him out of his reverie.
Then Cas is adding a hand at the base of Dean’s shaft, moving to his balls and Dean is close. So close. “I’m-I’m…Cas,” he warns and Cas pulls off and not too soon because he just manages to get out of the way and Dean shoots come all over the wall and floor.
I know you were in love with him when you were in college and I also know how upset you were when he chose to become a priest. You didn’t leave your room for almost two weeks after coming home from North Carolina.”
“Fu—,” he begins to curse but then he catches sight of what caused his accident and is startled by the black cat curiously sniffing the things he just dropped.
He puffs, lucky not to have lost his glasses that are dangling from one ear. Without a word he stalks back up to his lounger, lies down on his stomach and closes his eyes, face turned away from Cas, indicating silence.
“You know me, I’m just a really cool guy. Cool about everything,” Dean deadpanned.
Before he continued, he grabbed Dean’s hand and he could read in everyone’s eyes that they could tell what was to come next. “Dean and I, we’re in love. We’re boyfriends.”
“Spirits,” he hears Dean’s voice, all serious and smooth, “if any of you feel like reaching out, please talk to us. Send us a sign.”
“I guess Jody won,” he concludes.
“Actually, we wanted to speak with you.”
“I disagree,” Ms. Talbot says. “Anyway, I was hoping you’d ask me to dance with you. We can continue our discussion then.”
“My parents. We’re finally alone.”
“Yes. I can’t believe it! Not long until I’m driving her out of this shop.”
Cas wasn’t even able to answer right away. First he had to shakily release the breath he had been holding, then repeatedly nodded his head, until, finally he managed to say, “Yes.”
“Later,” he says, leaning his back against the passenger side of the car and drags Mick towards him by his shoulders. “I’ve thought about the sleeping arrangements for tonight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve got other things to focus on right now than city traffic,” he says and, surprisingly, Cas doesn’t argue with him.
Dean’s praising his moderate cooking skills made Cas blush but he appreciated how easily Dean could make him feel good about himself. Cas told Dean about his day and about the phone call from Meg and Dean was genuinely surprised that he had remained friends with her all these years. “She’s family,” Cas told him.
His phone rang. “Charlie?”
Castiel, obviously not familiar with human conventions, said nothing.
Cas frowns. “I didn’t witness every single thing that’s occurred while I was stationed on Earth.”
They’re standing in the backyard, watching Blossom romp around on the lawn, pausing to sniff at something every now and then.
At least Max and Alicia are kind enough to help Dean empty the tray.
“Yeah, that too, I guess,” Dean says, then, with a grin, “but, I mean, have you seen him. Guy’s hot.”
Sam has joined them and is waiting for his turn.
“Dean, calm down,” Sam says and Dean wants to punch him in the face so badly right now. He is calm, given the circumstances—he’s still keeping his voice down.
“Come on, Sammy, I’m your brother. There don’t have to be any secrets between us.”
Cas gasped but pulled himself together and replied, “I will do anything to make Dean feel loved for the rest of my life.”
“No!” Dean blurts out. He doesn’t deserve to be locked up. Jody’s right; Dean owes him. “Should I take him home with me or what?”
“If you say so… I just want you to know that we wouldn’t love you any less if you were gay.” Mary glanced up to her husband, waiting for him to confirm the statement and elbowing him as he hesitated to agree with her.
“I see,” she said. “At least now I have something to work with.”
Dean is amazed by the things Cain shows and explains to them and when they enter the stage to give them the performers’ perspective of the theatre, his jaw drops and he’s getting a bit shaky.
“I was. And I’m glad you were there to see it.”
“I miss you,” he said, pressed two fingers against his lips and then onto the cold stone. “I have to go now.”
Cas has to admit that Dean was on his best behavior today. He doesn’t know what he would’ve done without him. But he knows Dean isn’t really a bad guy. He’s a good person. That’s why Cas wouldn’t have minded him becoming sheriff. Their conversation from the day before also got him some insight on why Dean is acting like he is but Cas still can’t get behind what Dean’s problem with him is.
“But why now? Why did it come for him now?”
Time seemed to just crawl along. The position of the hands didn’t seem to have changed every time Cas looked up at the clock. He wanted the lecture to be over so he could talk to the girl, introduce himself, ask her out.
“Daniels,” she provided.
“I’m sorry for my, uh, associate. He’s not good with new people but I can assure you he’s a genius when it comes to cars.”
“There,” he says when he catches a glimpse of something shiny on the table.
She and Michael also say to take on Heaven and keep it from falling apart, maybe checking in for a helping hand from Jack sooner or later. Cas says he hopes the angels will listen to the archangel but he’s quite certain they’ll announce him their new King of Heaven in no time.
“Cas,” Dean breathes against Cas’s lips.
“They both worked for you, is that correct?” Cas asked.
Cas didn’t exactly know what to make of the offer. Tessa was obviously suggesting some kind of romantic partner to accompany him but he wasn’t really sure if it’d be a good idea to mention that he was in a relationship with a man. They were working at an institution with an religious background and they’d never had any form of talk concerning their beliefs or world views and Cas knew too well from his old church how devout people could be. And the thing between him and Dean was fairly new after all.
If he could, Dean would stay awake forever.
Dean shakes his head and lets out a small whine. An array of scenarios flashes through his brain as he thinks of what’s going to happen if he actually did not pass. He doesn’t want either of them to be disappointed. Sam will probably encourage him to just try again. Cas will feel more superior to him than he already does. Dean’s failure will confirm that he married the dumbest fuck in America.
wanted to go out with me.” He slaps himself for being impetuous but Dean interferes by pulling his hand away.
“Shit, Cas, why didn’t you tell me sooner…”
“Of course, Dean. What do you have in mind?”
“Oh, just a few hours. Apparently they’d prefer you to order a bit more food when you occupy a table for such a timespan.” His stomach rumbled loudly once more.
“We’ll see,” Dean said and sat up on the mattress.
Dean cupped Cas’s face with his hands and said, “I’m looking forward to it.”
“Meg went into labor.”
So Dean rushed to get to MCI. Charlie had texted him Cas’s flight information and as it turned out he was to be expected any minute when Dean finally arrived at the airport. It probably was for the best that Dean had so little time to think about what Cas coming here meant to him. Dean had always been aware that Charlie and Cas had stayed in touch all this time but he’d had no idea that Cas had even been invited to the wedding.
“I’m not a maid!” Dean whines, offended by the assumption, which only causes Sam to laugh harder. “There’s a cleaning lady coming once a week. I only do the cooking.”
“Cas, what are you saying? I swear, I didn’t do anything and I wouldn’t have. I just liked the attention, okay. I’m not into that woman.”
“Do you have the money to pay for it?”
“Dean,” Sam says but Dean can’t bear hearing more excuses and storms off. For him, this night is officially over.
“In the kitchen,” his mother’s answer echoed into the hallway.
Annabel turns around and looks up to him, happily awaiting a command from him.
“I’m not so sure about that. I’ll think of something.”
And of course he does. Dean starts to sing along with Cas, banging his head with the rhythm, Cas now grinning from ear to ear. He’s playing faster and faster, though every note is on point, and Dean can’t believe how fucking cool this is.
“I don’t like this kind of parties,” he answered.
And he did. He spent two weeks weighing the pros and cons of having Cas as a roommate after college and came to the conclusion that they hadn’t really talked after Dean had become single again. He had replayed the time Cas had defended him against Zeke in his head over and over since it had occurred. Maybe Cas had changed his mind but didn’t tell him about his feelings because Dean was with Aaron. But now he wasn’t anymore. He wasn’t even so sure if he was still in love with Cas. Maybe he wasn’t. Maybe he was again. Maybe he had never stopped. All those possibilities made his head spin. If he really was in love with Cas, he ought to figure it out soon—before the year was over and they graduated without having set things straight and Dean would lose him for good because Cas thought Dean had lost interest in him.
“Oh God, how's this going to come across in the film? Or was that the whole point?”
“What?” Sam looked taken aback.
Castiel looked at Dean unblinkingly. “Isn’t it worth the risk? Of all the dumb risks we’ve taken over the years, isn’t this one worth it?”
“It's going to be okay,” Castiel whispered to Dean as the lights went down. “Whatever happens.”
Without Dean saying it, Sam knew he was thinking of their mom in that moment, back in the Apocalypse world, dealing with the knock-on consequences of Michael's obliteration. Even with him gone, they still had many other rogue angels to take out and a society to rebuild.
“To the end of our careers!” Jody cheered, holding up a glass of wine.
Donna snorted with amusement and topped up her wine glass.
Castiel clenched his jaw and took a step towards Dean.
“What brings you here, Samsam?”
There was relatively little shop talk and Sam wondered if that was for his benefit or just that they liked to keep things separated. More talk about food than anything else with Jody trying to convince Charlie she’d enjoy gardening. Sam let it wash over him for the main part. Last time he’d been out for dinner with people had been his goodbye party in San Francisco. The mood had been pretty sober, leaving Sam feeling even more isolated after than he had felt before. Bret in particular hadn’t shied away from telling Sam he was throwing his whole life away.
“We both know that’s not true,” Cas said, gesturing to the pile of clothes Dean had left in his wake. He’d been wearing
“Hell yeah,” Dean nodded enthusiastically.
Sam beamed at Dean and looked back to the tree house, then to Castiel with a contemplative look in his eye.
There was a highly environmental and political message, but without being overly preachy. And to keep the film from being considered hypocritical, the entire thing was going to be carbon neutral by staging everything on a set and using green screen to add most background elements. Which also meant no travel and that they should be able to keep to the film's tight schedule.
Castiel was already sat at the bar as Sam walked in. He had his head bowed and looked to Sam like he was close to slamming his forehead on the wood repeatedly.
“I don’t wish to impose. I would still be happy to buy you that drink, and then I will leave you alone.” When Sam still didn’t talk the stranger took a step away. “My apologies, I have–”
“What's she like?” Dean asked Kevin, still curious to find out about his new supposed co-star. If he could call her that seeing as they hadn't even met yet. “I'm guessing you've met her?”
Castiel reached into the satchel he’d been carrying and pulled out a battered-looking copper tea kettle.
“No. But I’m avoiding the guy I’m in love with. Saying I have to work late, making other stupid excuses to ensure I won’t have to be alone with him. I can feel him pulling away and it hurts.”
They hugged tighter, Dean breathing in Castiel's now familiar scent, letting it sooth and empower him.
“They what?” Claire laughed.
“Yes.”
“It's good, you should go back. That's where I first decided to be a playwright.”
“Definitely,” he reassured Dean. “But only after I fuck you now. And only after you come again. I shouldn’t have missed the warning signs you were so close, I need to study this before we go any further.”
“No! No. Why would I be nervous?”
“I suspect they were in fact not truly children. If they’d used the device enough over the years, it is possible they are caught in some kind of time flux and are not aging at a normal speed for humans.”
“This is because Castiel sucks dick like a pro.”
“Can you guess why it was so expensive?”
“This guy you’re in love with? You should tell him. You’re a great guy, anyone would be lucky to have you in their lives.”
“How old are you, kid?”
“Hey, hey. It wasn’t exactly dirty up in here.”
“Taken,” Castiel answered, sitting down next to the girl. “Dean,” he greeted.
Sam ruffled his hair to try and disperse some of the flatness that had built up from his afternoon sofa adventures.
“And who is this?” Mary said, smiling happily at Castiel.
“So he’s in one of those moods again,” Dean could hear Castiel pronounce.
“Mom said she’d be here about four on Saturday. She called last night.”
She sighed and put her hands on her hips. “You should all try more fruit at some point.”
“If at some point in the future, this stops pleasing Dean, we have to find another way,” he pleaded.
“They have you in a nicer place than me,” Castiel commented as they walked through the hotel lobby.
“You don’t get to tell me what you do or do not deserve. You’ve read my work, you know that’s not how it works. And I’d hope you had more sources of information outside of that as well. Thorough and proper preparation.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean huffed.
“I’m going to make your buttocks as red as a shiny, red apple. Do you consent to this?”
Bela beamed out at the audience from the stage, observing the hands that shot up. The cast was sat behind a long table to the side of where she stood.
"You okay there, Dean?" Sam propped himself on his forearms to look over the bar and see Dean swoop down to pick up the somehow still-whole glass.
“Hey, Mr. Cas. Never known you to order pizza before. But easy delivery for me since I already knew where it had to go.”
Dean let out a sudden laugh. “Mr. Cas, just being over your lap like this? You have no idea how many of my fantasies have already been fulfilled. Even if you send me out that door right now, without my clothes, I’d be happy.”
Jack stumbled down a few more stairs, one hand on the banister, the other on his stomach. “I don’t feel so good,” Jack groaned.
In the days before the event they put their heads together trying to work out how to use the device. Even though the present day them wouldn’t require it, they needed to start researching so that future versions of Castiel could use it to come back to the predetermined point.
"I ran the numbers, and a few hundred potential scenarios, but it all boils down to: there isn't. The endgame on getting anyone but you involved is that… well, you'd kill them eventually. We thought we should just skip the queue and," he gestured to Sam. "You're the logical choice for King of Hell."
“I er,” Dean hesitated.
“Dean,” Sam said, breathy with excitement, “do you get it?”
Castiel placed an index finger under Sam’s chin and used it to tilt his head up.
“And if the movie effects are anything to go on – you've caught yourself a real treat south of the boarder with Castiel, Dean. Congratulations to you on that,” Mary added with a wink at her son.
“Lizzabelle,” Castiel said firmly, trying to get her attention as she looked up things on her Kay. How he knew her name was something Dean didn't know. He just accepted that Castiel knew all names these days.
Castiel’s eyes were sad as he nodded.
“It really doesn’t matter right now,” Castiel stressed.
They stood and held each other a while.
“This is real,” Sam said to himself like a mantra.
Dean shut his eyes and clenched his fingers harder.
Cas pinned his erection between his stomach and the elastic of his boxers to keep it out of the way as he finished his breakfast. It hurt, but hurt in a way he knew meant he'd get a lot of excellent writing done later. If he didn’t meet his word target, that was when the cock cage came out.
Bela looked uncomfortable, which for Bela meant her smile dimmed from 100% to 98% brightness.
“Hi Dean. I just wanted to ask: was it difficult acting without your more talented, more handsome brother by your side to prop you up?”
“Yeah, how many times do I gotta say it?”
The brothers looked at each other and laughed, which only resulted in them both wincing as they moved sore muscles and bruised limbs.
“Nnnngggg,” Dean grumbled, reaching out with a hand to feel for his phone. He knew he had to stop the noise and that it was his phone causing it. Answering the call on instinct, Dean found himself talking to his Uncle Bobby.
“Sam, what’s wrong?” Castiel had wrapped Dean’s robe around him securely and stood, frowning with concern as he watched Sam pace up and down the length of the kitchen.
dream? Because I was in that world before, but last time I knew. I knew it wasn’t real. I remember Sam and I were fighting and I hated it.”
“I don't... I don't do this much,” Dean mumbled, as they both paused a moment to get used to the feeling of Castiel deep within Dean.
Dean shrugged. “It is what it is, Sam. You had a life out there in San Fran to get on with. Mom and I never judged you for that, you know? It’ll be nice to have you around this year, though. But anyway, with mom coming over it means you’re out on the couch so mom can sleep here too. She offered to drive back after but it’ll be nice to have you both around at the same time.”
“It isn’t cheating if you aren’t a couple and
, Castiel concluded.
“Because I’m here by myself all day, waiting for both of you to come visit?”
Castiel was definitely going to get a nosebleed.
“Yeah,” Castiel sighed, but as he looked up at Dean Sam could see the tenderness in his gaze. The shy smiles on both their faces.
Anna had been a star in many video game movie adaptions. Some more successful than others, but she'd developed herself as the go-to action lead for the last few years and Dean felt genuinely honored to be playing opposite her.
“I still meant it,” Castiel said firmly. “I’ll always mean it, I wouldn’t just throw around words like that because–”
“What do ya think?” Dean asked Sam later as he pulled out of Jody’s driveway, the Impala’s engine roaring perfectly.
The truth hung thickly in the air between them.
Celia waved Dean away. "Yeah, yeah. Guess I should be getting back." She stood from her stool with a sigh. "Unless you want me to stay for the company?"
“Plus we all know you already had a go this morning,” Castiel Six pointed out. “You shouldn’t get to go first.”
“Still happy he has a restraining order against you, Becky,” Dean chuckled darkly.
“We really do have to go to the party,” Dean muttered into Castiel's shoulder.
Sam winced. “I’m not sure what today is.” What was time when he was spending so much of his waking hours reading and testing out Dean’s couch?
“Are you sure? I feel drunk? Is my liver going to be okay? Should I go pick up a spare one?”
What started as a single diet-breaking burger ended up turning into a habit. Dean also stopped training as much. Unlike the centauricorn actors, he wasn't required to be even slightly naked and had loose clothing on to hide any changes in his physique.
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean mumbled, his orgasm leaving him pleasantly sleepy and at peace for once.
“It is a thing then. You like watching me strip. What should I take off next, Dean?”
“Eaten much?”
“You know,” Dean started as he chewed his pizza. He took huge bites, Castiel knew already. Dean’s cheeks would squirrel out, almost like Dean just liked the sensation of his mouth being full of something hot and moist. “I’ve got a question for you.”
He ended up being roped in to help with the lighting of Castiel's play as their lighting person fell through – not that he minded. It was a crazy experience and Dean's confidence about his ability to do something that wasn't acting went from strength to strength.
“I’m going to shower.”
“How did you guess?” Castiel deadpanned.
Jess had left. He’d quit his job. Said goodbye to his buddies in the area. And only now, in the place he’d lived in the last two years, did it all seem to hit exactly what he’d done. Exactly what he was facing.
The twins were so perfectly behaved when they went shopping for the presents Castiel bought them both a treat. Their exemplary behavior lasted into the evening too when they were both ready for bed before Dean had even arrived. Castiel let them stay up long enough to say hi to Dean before bed.
“But I know you have to.” Dean's voice wobbled, even though he didn't want it to. “Why do I feel like this after only a few days?” he begged of Castiel.
"Really? Oh wow! That would be – that would be
“Everyone knows,” Donna agreed. “But focus, boys, focus. World end-y matters here. We’ve been busy the last few weeks while you were taking your extended nap time.”
Even though he didn't know the language, he still somehow felt like he made friends with the cast. Castiel remained firmly at his side, helping him communicate, introducing him to the small company of actors, all of who Castiel knew well.
A lot of the kids who had been young when they started making Jones Bros films were of college age now and desperate for photographs with the two. They didn't mind stopping to take hundreds of photos so long as the good times continued to roll. Hell, it was a bit of a boost to his ego, and Dean needed that after the weirdness of the film set he'd come off.
“Are you in pain?” Castiel was halfway to a panic, fearing he’d somehow injured Dean already, and not in the manner they’d been discussing. “Can I do anything? What’s the–” Castiel’s brain caught up with the feeling of wetness on the top of his thighs. “Did you just orgasm, Dean?”
Castiel studied Dean’s backside, trying to decide what he could take. What both of them could take. If their hearts could handle trying this and the potential of things not going well.
“I heard they were making a spin-off film about the Jones' brother aunts and their backstory?” Benny chipped in, changing the topic. “Been wanting to ask you about it for ages, if I'm being honest.”
Dean turned the music up hoping to startle Dennis awake so he'd leave too. It didn't look like anyone else would be visiting the bar tonight, especially not the only people Dean really wanted to see.
They sat down for one last breakfast together and Dean could feel himself wanting to cry.
He wasn't sure why he felt like he had to tell Castiel this. They were in the middle of sex already.
"I think I can work it out. Prep it, make sure everything is well oiled, sit down, hope the vibrations don't – um." Dean's face looked flush. He took his cap off and ran a palm over his hair before putting the cap back on.
There was a click as Castiel popped the lid off the lube.
“The world is at peace, and we’ve destined ourselves to be miserable forever to achieve and maintain the status quo.”
“I… cannot, I’m sorry, Dean.”
“You want me to fuck you instead?” Castiel offered.
“Uh,” Sam’s brain started to reboot. “Yeah, yeah… it’s gone really well. I put in an application for one place, helping out at an NGO who deal with–”
“So we won't have to do any more pick-up shots?” Dean wondered.
“Was he fond of that?”
“Perfect with you,” Dean cried out as his back arched and his cock twitched again and come dribbled out. It wasn’t a lot of come, much to Castiel’s sadness, but then again, Dean had come last only a few hours earlier.
Suddenly Kevin was crying. Donna was first to offer him a hug.
Even in the year 2289, humanity hadn’t created a way to bring true comfort to Dean’s broken soul.
“For the horse porno film.”
“Why do this on dad’s birthday?”
“No we haven’t,” both said at once.
Sam dropped to his knees, grasping Castiel’s cock in one hand. “Got a condom?”
Soon as they'd rinsed the soap off, they walked towards the bedroom, stopping to kiss and touch every few steps.
But he was. And it wasn’t as if Castiel offered up his last name either.
“So,” Dean started, slowly connecting the dots. “So she offers you a few week's of work. In exchange you pretend you're some bizarre new actor the production company has just discovered who only goes by one name. But she gets you the funds to help your charity?”
Dean shrugged and started to move to join them when Castiel caught his arm.
Castiel winced. “Yes, most probably, regrettably.”
His lower lip was shaking slightly. Castiel wanted to pull Dean to him, comfort him, but Dean needed this time to process things. Eventually Dean nodded. “More than okay. I’d really, really like that, Cas. If you think it will work, and if you’re comfortable with it. I don’t want you to feel obligated.”
“Hey!” Sam laughed, seeing Castiel’s laugh. “I’m huge.”
“Go ahead.”
Yes, the angels they’d assembled saved Heaven for his universe, but for most it seemed like they’d accepted the Winchester invite to another universe for the purpose of wanting to save themselves.
It became quickly apparent in the shower the Castiel was both a talker and a loud moaner. Dean's cock had been throbbing and untouched since he'd sunk to his knees.
Dean inhaled sharply. His fists were balled and his whole body trembled.
Castiel gently moved Dean’s arm so that it was around his shoulders and leaned into Dean’s side.
“I’m still going to spank you.”
“Kid?” she spat in shock. “I’m 37!”
“I...”
Dean returned and working together they were soon able to fill up the trailer with the already packed boxes. Sam had shoved most of his clothes into the two suitcases he had. It was a disquieting feeling to know that he could pack up so much of his life, of the last half decade, into a few boxes and feel like he was done with it.
“You mean the world to me too, Dean. I truly had no idea he was your brother.”
“I love you,” Dean slurred happily.
“You were kind of a horn dog in the dream world,” Dean smirked.
“I don't understand. Why would they? That makes no sense. I know you've been drinking,
together,” Dean spoke like the words had a gross taste. “Why would you even do that?”
Anna didn't look convinced, thumbing through her pages.
“What?” Castiel panted.
“Claire found ya,” Donna chirped up. “You’re lucky she did, you know?”
“I phrased that badly. I mean, an object that is somewhere between red and pink. Though, it is good to hear you understand that system.” Castiel’s voice was full of pride.
film we have coming out in November.”
. And Sam agreed. Physical battles they could take. This psychological mess though?
Studying Castiel's face, Dean thought he looked very sad and not at all like the engaging, bright-eyed guy he'd been hanging out with all afternoon.
“Castiel, Mrs. Winchester. It is a pleasure to meet you.” Castiel moved forwards to shake Mary's hand.
hard last night. Dean wondered if the press had caught him and Castiel making out on their way back to the hotel.
to demand that they make a film about Sam.
“Last night was fun.”
“Are you holding onto the headboard firmly, Dean?”
Do not see this movie. I went hoping to give Dean Winchester a fair chance to show he's more than just Sam Winchester's older, less good looking brother. If anything, I learned he's
Dean considered his a charmed life on the day of his 80th birthday. He’d really received everything he could have asked for. And when he finally died and joined the great beyond, to Heaven or to Hell, he knew he’d have his family not too far from him, always and forever.
“Cas… Cas you are the greatest boyfriend ever,” he moaned.
Castiel borrowed some of Dean's body wash and thought with a thrill of happiness how he'd smell like Dean.
“Honey, I’m home!” Dean walked in through the front door and threw his keys on the side table. He walked into the living room, sorting through a handful of post Sam supposed he’d picked up from the mailbox outside. “Budge up, you big lug.”
“You two should go talk things out.”
So they made one.
“Yeah, I finished up earlier than expected and you said you wanted to talk, Cas?”
“Bye, kid. See you tonight for that big premiere – assuming I'm still getting a ticket?”
“Stop,” Castiel cautioned. “I would strongly advice that you don’t touch it. It works mostly on thought and does not seem to be that easy for new owners to work with.”
Castiel ruled Heaven.
. They thought they had about a week of re-shooting to do, maybe a little more.
“Exactly, just a dream. We’re alive. Eileen has a very beautiful, in focus face. And you aren’t in love with a horse.”
Dean threw himself backwards onto the bed, leaning up on his elbows.
Sam had his hand on the door handle, but no matter which way he turned, it wouldn’t open.
“That must have cost you a lot recently with all the pizza I’ve been ordering.”
“Can't a big brother just call?” Dean winced.
She snorted and looked around the interior.
“Dean, Dean Winchester. Your co-star. I was glad to hear what a delight I was on set, by the way,” he added.
“Not tonight though!” Charlie asserted. “It’s Friday night, we’ve worked hard all week.”
Sam rolled his eyes again. At least he was getting plenty of physical therapy for his eyes.
Sighing, Dean slumped back on the sofa.
Castiel nodded. “He turned the volume down once I got here.”
“So we smash it down!”
Sam looked up and made eye contact with–
“I had to learn how to do a backwards flip for the movies,” Dean shared.
It didn’t take long for Dean to learn just how okay with it Castiel was.
Castiel nodded sadly. “I can’t begin to tell you what he means to me, Sam. Platonic or not, I want him in my life.”
Dean rolled his eyes and pressed end of call, grateful his brother knew him so well.
“Yes, Sam?”
Suddenly Dean was laughing, full of nervous energy. “This is one of the weirdest things that's ever happened in my life. These last few months. Then to cap it off, I meet you.”
With thanks again to the wonderfully talented artist I had the pleasure of working with through this
“You’re just annoyed I hit that before you did,” Sam teased, sensing Dean’s walls were crumbling. When he thought about that time with Castiel, he couldn’t even remember the specifics of the night. How big was Castiel’s dick even? It was all so fuzzy in his head now.
“Those… please? Please take your pants off. Pants, off, please?”
After their days of shopping, their nights were full of more sex.
It was true, and Sam could hardly deny it. It was on the tip of his tongue to slam against the demon and decry it all as lies, but he still had the scar on his left shoulder that had come with what they'd done to fix Heaven. No amount of grace was going to heal that. It also wasn’t worth arguing that what they’d done for Heaven hadn’t been a permanent fix, so it hardly counted anyway. They still didn’t have enough angels to run the place. The fighting and sacrifice so far had just secured it for a little while so they could try and find a long-term solution.
“Cool? I’ve been freaking out for weeks about whether I should tell you that!”
“I've never had my balls waxed before,” Dean could hear Garth saying. “Huh, I wonder if I'll like it.”
“Is this… a thing for you? Watching me strip?”
“Someone paid me to make sure you three would be out of the way for a while. That’s all I know!”
His heart was thumping wildly, panic creeping in.
The actors all at once looked on the covers of their scripts.
“For TV work you don't seem to really want and think will be canceled anyway.”
Dean could also detect an oddly familiar fragrance.
“You’re still dressed,” Castiel pointed out. “That doesn’t seem fair.”
“But it was Dean,” Jack beamed.
Castiel stood up to put the bottle on a side table and grab the gift bag. Jack had been very insistent on helping to wrap the presents inside. A lot of glitter was involved for reasons Castiel couldn’t fathom but knew he’d regret when he cleaned up next.
“It was a good talk,” Castiel smiled.
“We’d need more equipment,” Castiel sighed. “But Sam,” he touched a hand to Sam’s shoulder.
“And you don't mind that your sister's just wrecked your career?”
His eyes were scrunched up and tears were seeping out. He could feel them trickle down his face, even if his consciousness was barely registering what was happening. He just wanted to indulge in the sensation of Castiel in him, filling him, making him
“Then maybe I can show you after I blow you.” Sam smiled at Castiel and lifted his glass up to finish up the last of the watery ice. He wasn’t sure where his sudden burst of courage had come from, certainly not the drink. But it was there, and his mouth was watering at the thought of sucking dick again for the first time since he was a freshman.
"Are their lives worth more than us? You know the angels have committed many atrocious acts."
“Yeah...” Dean felt vaguely dizzy. Surely Castiel wasn't suggesting what Dean thought he was?
The zip on the front of Castiel’s pants was going to break open from internal pressure soon.
Dean looked over and rolled his eyes. “You know I’m kidding, right? You can stay as long as you like. I owe you that much. We can be in our sixties and still livin’ together. Wouldn’t that just be swell?”
“Ah,” Sam winced. “That's...”
“We were signed up for five films originally, Sammy and I. Fifth film finishes and they wanted to negotiate to keep us for another five. But by that point Sam's already eyeing up college. We agreed to two more. Since the writers knew there was just two more, they killed off the aunts in the sixth so the seventh–”
By the end of the shoot six weeks later, Dean was probably at his heaviest weight ever, and finding it hard to care. Wardrobe hadn't dared complain more than once about having to refit the three after the telling off they got from Jody about the pressures placed on actors.
“As an average, for six of you having cum, should be about… 22 milliliters, I think?” Dean didn’t even try to pretend he didn’t know average load amounts.
“He’s always so out of control and beautiful when he comes,” one of the Castiels said. The others voiced their agreement readily.
“And I assure you, I don't wish to leave either.”
They both chuckled and Sam could feel the tension from his shoulders dissipating little by little. Even if he and Castiel weren’t destined to be, he’d enjoyed the experience.
“Why now? You've got enough money to live off forever if you wanted to.”
Eileen. That was who he wanted to see. But since Eileen was out saving the world, and Sam was… Sam cast his thoughts for what there was to do. Dean laughed from inside and he could hear Castiel join in too.
“But?” Dean added, stomach suddenly dropping. Oh. So maybe this was going to be the part where he was thrown aside. He shouldn't have been so surprised. Just in the heat of things the night before it felt like maybe this time would be diff–
Feeling sad and lonelier than he could ever remember being, Dean curled up on the sofa and called his brother.
“Absolutely! She said it is important for group bonding,” Donna explained getting out of her seat. “Come on guys, we've all been sat here on our own for long enough.”
out that he was trying to reply with, Castiel had thrust in.
“Fuck.
“Or anything, really. Go travel and see the world.”
“I have no idea,” Sam frowned. “We haven’t–”
Castiel wasn’t fully recovered yet, but still the strongest of the three of them by far and had taken to doing the heavy lifting. At this point in their journey back to wellness, this included bowls of soup still. He put the tray down on the coffee table.
“Yeah.”
Back-up generators came on one-by-one in Castiel’s brain and slowly he started to process.
body,” Bela placated. “We have ways of getting around that.”
“Cas! You’re, um, back early.” Dean scooted his chair further under the table, only further proving to Castiel what he had already assumed.
Dean sat, trying to take it all in. Eyes flitting around his suite, he suddenly realized: “That probably explains why they were so quick to give into me requesting this stupidly huge hotel room too. More to expense in the final budget.”
Dean nodded in agreement. “Yeah, I’d like to get back soon, too.” Dean dropped onto his bed with a small
He was pretty amazed she'd made it this far without revealing what a big fan girl she apparently was. Dean was quietly thankful for this.
Castiel smiled gently. “I understand, room service is fine with me. I just want you to feel comfortable.”
“I’m way too clumsy for that. But I do know how to pick a lock.”
“You got the address for the place we’re staying tonight?” They’d decided to split the drive up with a night’s stop. They weren’t young men in their 20s anymore and the idea of driving straight through all the way back felt like insanity.
“Now don't be silly!” Donna cooed.
Despite everything though, inside he felt warm and happy – which was not how he expected to feel watching the intentional disaster that was
Dean made a strange gurgle sound and Castiel knew he was torn between feeling this as a punishment as it meant no sucking cock later, and a reward as it meant Castiel would be restricting his breathing somewhat.
Castiel goggled at the bottle. “How did you even get this?”
“The twins are great kids,” Dean shrugged. “Felt wrong not getting them something. I, er, got something for you too.” Dean pulled a bottle out of the bag. “Sorry it isn’t wrapped. Happy Valentine’s Day.”
The film was now about centaurs. And not just plain centaurs, a centaur-unicorn hybrid.
Dean quirked his lip. “She’s kickass,” he said with an approving nod. “She might take pity on you and agree to a date, you know, once your arms are strong enough again that you can actually wash your own hair, dress yourself, all those little things.” Dean smirked at Sam as if he wasn’t in the same boat.
“Dean, you know you have to be quieter than that,” Castiel tutted and kissed Dean deeply on the mouth. “You don’t want Sam complaining again.”
Castiel looked over the table at him woefully and sat forwards so he could take one of Dean's hands in his.
