No, Dean’s lucky in ways no other human will ever understand. He thinks back to all his years alone. All his years with Sam. All his years dancing around the things he felt around Cas. He’s the luckiest bastard alive.
We'll probably need to find them since that's the only way we know to send him back that doesn't involve disembowelment.
“Oh, that was nice of him.” Cas crosses over to grab the cookies out of Dean’s hand so he can inspect them.
Thanks to everyone who's come along for the ride. Sorry no one actually got to punch John in the end but I think they're doing just fine without him.
Dean goes to answer, suddenly feeling like the hallway is a very public space. He gestures for Cas to follow him to-
They’re nothing fancy but they’re expensive enough that they shouldn’t stain Cas’s skin even if he has to wear it for an extended period. Still, they’re a proper commitment.
He looks across at Cas, the angel of the lord that stormed that barn twelve years ago, taking rounds of bullets to his chest without flinching, as he shoves popcorn that he can’t even taste properly into his mouth and laughs at this stupid Netflix movie.
. Cas who, just over a month ago, he’d thought was gone forever. Dean still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around the fact that Cas was here and he wasn’t going anywhere. They were on the other side of the planet and Cas was still choosing to stick with him.
“When I was questioning.” he says, “I would come here and I’d look at what you and Bobby had done. The sigils, the bullets, everything. You had no idea what you were facing. I- Heaven, Angels, it was something you couldn’t comprehend. Something so entirely beyond you. And you took your paints and your books and your weapons and you tried so hard to protect yourselves.  You were so scared. And this barn would remind me of that. That no matter what you said, how confident you were, The Plan was more than you and if you couldn’t even comprehend a single angel then what was the worth in listening to you.”
He missed Dean. It felt weird admitting it. It would hit him randomly, even more so the days when Eileen wasn’t around, this feeling of missing Dean. It was almost like they were kids moving out of home for the first time. It was time to go, and in many ways, they needed a break from each other.
Cas comes out of Sam's embrace, still unsteady. He looks back to Dean, a mountain of unsaid things sit between them but for now Dean just forces a smile.
The list was short. Amara possibly? Chuck again? Had Jack somehow released The Empty? But why would he call any of them “a thing”? Unless he was purposely being obtuse? Man, it was hot.
They headed in a general easterly direction after Cas had made some remarks about “the East Coast” and “population density”.
Behind them Josie stood up, cracking her back, “Alrighty,” she said taking a glance at her watch, “let’s get you back so John can take you to ya car.”
He lets it sit for a moment in a way he rarely does. Larry, their ever-friendly competition and also apparently just their friend, had come around to congratulate them on the first month earlier that day. He’d also been there to deliver an invitation to his own wedding. An invitation addressed to a Cas and Dean Campbell. Two people who don’t actually exist but are feeling more like real people every day.
Your dead husband who kind of abused your kids shows up out of the blue and you just kiss and make up- yeah no, not my Mary Winchester.
Dead grass. Stunted trees. If you squinted there was a kinda pathetic mountain range on the horizon - the John Egan Pioneer Track Lookout sure was scintillating stuff.
“I guess we’ll have to see when we get there. Which will not be soon, we fought for a bit of peace and I’m intending to actually enjoy mine.”
He doesn’t fall, just finds himself on the ground. His back against the wall and head raised to the sky. The heavens shine above him, stars in their multitudes glitter above.
Jack gets into position beside Carhenge, smiling intensely at the camera and doing his signature 'Jack wave' as Cas takes a photo.
“Bronte, the estate agent, has agreed to give us a tour tomorrow morning at 11am.” Cas informs Dean as he hangs up his phone.
It starts the moment they agree to check out the strange deaths of three IT professionals in the same small mid-western town.
Maybe Dean’s still angry. It’s been three days and he’s barely talked to Cas. It’s better than it was before. He can eat now, he can sleep and every day doesn’t feel like a rusty nail being dug into his gut.
Anyway, how we holding up knowing Cas could see the love in his eyes? Me, I went to the farmer's market and bought local honey in Cas's honour because that is the life that he deserved.
That waitress girl seems nice. And now Yellow-Eyes is gone you could... Well, I didn't think you'd hunt forever.
Dad you were kinda freaking out about the bunker, we didn't know how to... explain all the other stuff.
Why is Dean freaking out? Isn’t he past the freaking out stage? He’s accepted, after several months and a few minor breakdowns, that this is a pretty permanent thing. He wants Cas here, Cas here as a romantic partner in a permanent kind of public way. That’s basically being married. Larry and the rest of this town don’t even know them. What does it matter what they think? It’s fine. It’s cool. It’s-
I should have warned you. I should have... told you what was out there. That no matter what happened to me you could never let Sam and Dean...
Cas takes a second to register that he and Jack are being referred to as a 'family'. He suddenly realises that he really does want that captured in a photo.
Dean was giving Sam a look from across the room. The look implied all sorts of ideas about grand theft auto and possible murder. It was rather persuasive.
On the porch stands Larry, a Tupperware container in one hand, looking around hesitantly as if afraid one of the ghosts might still be lurking waiting to kill him.
Dean and Cas sit on the hood of the Impala, MIRACLE THE DOG at their feet. Not stopping here for anything in particular. Just enjoying the beauty of the ocean under the bright starlight.
a small traitorous voice in the back of his brain tried to remind him. He quashed it down. Everything was alright. He was worried about Jack and whatever it was he’d unleashed and he sure as hell didn’t want to be here but… compared to the nightmare they’d been living not so long ago, he’d take this in a heartbeat. Sam was here, Eileen hadn’t been Thanos-snapped out of existence and, if he wanted to, he could just lean across this small, stained motel room table in Bumfuck, Queensland and kiss that worried frown right off Cas’s face.
“Sam’s busy with Eileen working on getting the bunker sorted, it’s not like he needs to know where we are at all times.”
There’s a lot of things he wants to make permanent. Lots of things he never thought he’d get a chance to make permanent. But he’s glad he’s getting that chance. That daily chance to keep making these commitments.
The rooms themselves were small but sweet.  Homey floral bedspreads and wallpaper and, mercifully -air conditioned. Red dirt seemed almost baked into the white tiles of the bathrooms, but Dean was grateful for a place to finally change out of his sweat soaked clothes and wash off the layer of grime that had been covering him since he got there. Good luck to Kit and Mia getting the stench of four sweaty, filthy hunters out of their fancy Kombi. It had taken him 30 minutes in the shower to free his own nose of the smell.
A creature stood, muscles rippling across its broad chest as it drew itself to its full and considerable height. It fixed them with its beady black eyes, hands hanging heavy with powerful claws…
enjoying this. After all, he and Cas had basically been doing this kind of thing for the last month across America…
“You shouldn’t have been dragged into this mess. It didn’t have anything to do with you and all I’ve done is just get you caught up in the shit that is my life.”
He looks away. He can’t hold that gaze. Doesn’t know what to do with the energy vibrating between them. So he does what he knows, he looks away and tries to brush it off.
He stared blankly ahead at the kitchen backsplash. It needed a clean. He could do that tomorrow. He had time for those things now. A whole lifetime of time.  And apparently that even included time for cooking complicated recipes from food blogs.
Cas is giving him a strange look. Bronte’s looking hopeful. Fourteen months is a long time to be trying to sell a dilapidated and extremely haunted motel.
Patience Turner is called to the stage to receive her diploma and Jody and Alex jump from their seats clapping.
She looks back over to where Billy has suddenly sequestered Jack and is quietly pointing out his favourite parts of the monument. Jack listens with honest enthusiasm.
Also rather pleased to be posting this on Father's day. Feels rather appropriate. Anyway, here's an incredibly awkward family dinner in honour of fathers everywhere.
Kit and Mia dropped them outside the rustic looking hotel with a wave before disappearing back into a cloud of red dirt.
To have a chance to just see her again. To talk to her one last time. You and your brother had no right to keep that from me!
Life has found a rhythm. A proper rhythm. There are still good days and bad days, but for the most part there’s just normal days.
The passenger door flung open to reveal a young hippie-looking woman with a scarf tied around her dreadlocked hair.
It’s not like he has a problem pretending to be a couple. They are a couple. Have been since Cas came home. Since Dean got his head out of his ass and actually told Cas that he felt that way too. No, Dean is quite happy being a couple. Enthusiastic even, it’s just…
“Better than nothing.” She shrugged. “You want me to drive for a bit tomorrow? It’s still another 11 hours and you seemed a bit tired today.”
At first Castiel’s thrusts were slow and steady, the Alpha seemingly still half asleep. But as he slowly woke his thrusts grew harder and faster, until he was pounding into Dean’s ass with his usual force, driving the omega into the soft mattress. He rolled over to mount Dean properly, one hand gripping Dean’s hip and the other pressed between Dean’s shoulder blades.
The animals cold nose was back, pressing to his entrance again, making Dean gasp. He was still plenty slick from his heat, and he couldn’t help the whimper that escaped him when the animals warm tongue was suddenly lapping at his hole. Horrified, Dean tried to move away again, only to still when he heard the wolf’s growl again. The tongue returned, lapping insistently, pushing into Dean’s channel, and the omega couldn’t help the deep moan that slipped past his lips. He was still in heat after all, and animal or not, his body craved attention.
Castiel pulled Dean up onto his lap with a pleased smile. “You’ve been a very good fuck toy so far. Are you hungry?” he asked, putting a hand on Dean’s stomach.
Dean cried out in pain and jerked on the alpha’s lap. Then there was another smack, and another, each as painful as the last and coming in quick succession. With every smack of the alpha’s hand, Dean could feel something giving away inside him, the will to fight being drained out of him, until he lay limp on the alpha’s lap, silently crying and submitting to the alpha’s spanking.
Dean gasped when his ass was suddenly exposed, and his face burned as he thought of how it must look to the passing cars, but he couldn’t help the quiver of excitement and the trickle of slick that escaped his hole.
have a disobedient puppy,” Castiel said firmly, holding Dean’s collar tightly and laying another smack to his ass. “We will do this as long as it takes to make you into a good boy.”
He was starting to feel hot under the collar, and he had to focus not to squirm. Then he felt a little slick escape his entrance, which was starting to tingle. His face bloomed red as he realized what was happening.
Dean whimpered but obeyed, slowing his pace to a leisurely movement, up and down, up and down. This was always his alpha’s favorite part.
Benny still held his leash tightly, keeping him in place, and his hand was stroking through his hair. “Such a good little pup.”
“In just a minute,” Castiel said, leading Dean into the bedroom. “Go pick out a couple stories first,” he said, pointing to the book shelf. He climbed into the bed without getting dressed, neither of them bothered with clothes after bath time. The alpha sat up against the headboard, his hard cock straining.
“You get pampered and spoiled, and all you have to do is submit to your rich, handsome alpha.” She let out a sigh. “All the rest of us get is a lot of hard work and a knot from whichever alpha on the staff is interested tonight.”
“Okay, on your feet,” Balthazar said, helping Dean up. Gadreel watched from the arm chair with a sated expression. “Go to Castiel.”
“Such an impatient little boy,” Castiel chuckled. He walked over to his desk as he unhooked the straps at his shoulders, letting him lay Dean down on his back without removing the omega from the carrier. The carrier still attached them at Castiel’s hips, which left Dean’s ass at just the right level.
Dean bit his lip in anticipation just before Benny’s thick cock drove in deep, filling him with one swift thrust. Dean’s hands gripped the couch tight as the Alpha started to pound into him, taking Dean and using him for his pleasure. Benny’s strong hands held Dean’s hips firmly, pulling him back to meet each hard thrust.
Dean held Castiel’s hand tight as they walked into the office, and he kept himself tucked half behind the alpha’s strong arm. He didn’t like talking to the other alphas, they all gave him funny looks. So when Daddy stopped to talk to them he’d hide his face and pretend they couldn’t see him. This would only make them laugh and talk about how cute he was.
“Hello sir,” the man said to Castiel. “Would you like an omega for the night? Or just for a quick knot?” He shoved the young omega towards him. “My son is freshly presented, you’d be his first, I’d give you a good price for his virginity.”
Dean scrambled to obey, turning over and pressing his face to the bed and getting up on his knees. He arched his back and spread his legs, straining to push his ass up as high as he could, displaying his trembling hole to the Alpha behind him.
“Mmm, Daddy,” Dean whimpered as he was finally helped out of his carrier at the end of the day. He felt fuzzy with pleasure and tired, and he pliantly let his daddy change him into a dry diaper before they were ready to go. Slick and alpha seed immediately started to run free and fill the diaper, and he knew he’d need to be changed again as soon as they got home.
He didn’t sound angry at all, and Dean finally looked up at his brother, and was surprised to see he looked more awed than angry.
“There you go, a knot for my good little boy,” Castiel said, lifting Dean off the desk and bringing him back to cuddle into his chest. He reattached the straps of the harness to his shoulders to hold Dean in place on his chest.
Then just as the knot disappeared Castiel started to thrust with earnest. A few people walked into the room, but they only smiled at them before moving to their own work.
The alpha grinned, hooking Dean by the back of his neck and pulling him into the house. “Thank you, he’s perfect,” he said, absently speaking to John without taking his eyes off Dean.
“You are,” Castiel replied, biting down on Dean’s shoulder and sucking a mark into the omega’s skin. The Alpha’s hips moved against Dean’s ass, grinding his knot inside Dean as seed continued to fill him.
It was how Castiel ensured nobody would be tempted to touch Dean. Why risk your life for one omega when the house was full of omegas free for the taking?
Dean couldn’t argue, he could only whimper and bare his neck for the alpha, offering himself. His cock was hard and his hole was leaking, his entire body ready to be taken by the man holding him.
Dean woke slowly the next morning to the sound of the shower running in the attached bathroom. He was immediately aware of his achey muscles and his very tender backside, and he let out a soft groan and rolled over, pulling Castiel’s pillow to his face. The scent of his new Alpha helped him relax, and he started to feel proud of his well used body. He could do this, and he could be good at it.
Dean whined and started to grind on his alpha’s lap. “I’m sorry Alpha, I can’t help it, I just need a cock so bad…” It was a rather crowded subway car, and Dean could feel the eyes of many interested alphas.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at the change of topic, but didn’t question it. “It’s a lot of work, strange hours…”
Castiel carried Dean into the master bedroom and dumped him on his back on a huge bed, draped in luxurious silk. The Alpha pulled away and started to strip off his suit, staring down at Dean with intense hunger. Dean squirmed under the Alpha’s gaze, and didn’t even realize he was spreading his legs wantonly as he waited for Castiel to take him.
He didn’t wait any longer before he started to move on Castiel’s lap, leaning back against his chest as he started to move up and down on his alpha’s thick cock. He knew just how he looked, his little cock was hard and tenting the front of his panties, and the scent of slick was heavy on the air. Nobody ever doubted how much Dean wanted his alpha.
Balthazar nodded, giving Dean a playful smack on the ass. “We’ll finish this later,” he teased, turning to follow Castiel into the sitting room.
Dean just smiled, deciding he would ask his alpha to do just that. Castiel was a good alpha, Dean knew he would at least consider it.
“Good bitch,” Castiel praised, bringing his hand up to Dean’s mouth. “Now clean your mess off my hand and the table.”
The door opened and a tall, handsome alpha was there, blue eyes looking down at Dean appraisingly. Dean only came up to his chest. His broad, strong chest.
Dean’s desperate cries were muffled but he arched his back and tried to press back against Gadreel, doing his best to beg the Alpha to fuck him harder. He wanted more, needed it. The pain was long gone, leaving nothing but blinding, desperate pleasure.
Things started to blur as Benny’s knot went down and Dean’s leash was passed to Balthazar, sitting on the couch right next to Benny. Dean didn’t hesitate to take his cock in his mouth next, just as eager for another knot. He sucked and licked, still squirming on the vibrating plug in his ass, completely lost to the endless pleasure of it.
“Good little bitch,” Benny praised. “Now go find Balthazar and Gadreel. It’s their turn to knot you.”
“That’s it, good bitch,” Castiel praised, using his hands to guide Dean up and down his cock again. This time he controlled the pace, fucking Dean’s mouth on his cock.
When third period came around, Castiel told himself not to look for the castrated omega, not to even let his mind drift to the possibilities. He hoped the boy would turn out to be unappealing, so that he wouldn’t be distracted.
Dean just moaned around the thick cock in his mouth, the sounds coming out in the same rhythm as Gadreel’s hard thrusts.
“Damn, he’s gorgeous, how much did you pay?” Benny asked. He ran his hands around to grope at Dean’s round ass, making the omega blush, despite knowing the Alpha was soon going to do much more.
Castiel lead Dean to the bathroom, starting up the shower. Once it was hot, he tugged Dean inside, then set to work cleaning them both up.
Dean gasped when he felt the thick, blunt top of the plug press against his entrance. He let out a small whimper as Castiel pushed it slowly up and in, waiting for Dean’s rim to stretch and take the thick toy inside. Dean grasped at Castiel’s arm and moaned as he was forced open and the plug finally popped in, letting his rim clamp back down around the narrow base. Dean was overwhelmed for a moment by the fullness in his channel. The toy wasn’t as big as a knot, but it was big enough to make Dean wish that it was a knot instead.
Sam closed the door before Dean could jump up and throw himself at the strange alpha again. “Just drink your whiskey,” Sam said, pouring a small glass for each of them.
Until he saw the small crowd of employees on the other side of the glass wall, and Dean  could only blush and look away, unable to hide himself from their curious eyes.
“Come,” Castiel said, putting an arm around Dean. “I want you on your leash tonight, so that I can keep you close.”
Castiel finally released the bite on the back of Dean’s neck, kissing the mark he’d left. “Now you’re truly mine, marked, bought and paid for,” he said with a pleased chuckle. “I just need to get you a proper collar so that nobody will ever doubt who you belong to.”
“Okay boys, he’s all yours. I’ll be in my office, he’ll probably need a nap when you’re done with him, so put him to bed when you’re finished with him.” Castiel stood and pressed a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips and ran a soothing hand through his hair. “Be a good bitch for me, my little omega,” he ordered.
“Today we work on your training,” Castiel mumbled, pressing a kiss to the back of Dean’s neck. “Good bitches have to have good self control. Today you are going to be a fuck toy, that means you do not speak without permission, and you do
“Nothing other than your collar, which I will have made for you as soon as possible.” Castiel smiled. “Strip the rest of the way for me.”
“Business is excellent,” Gabriel said, sounding pleased. “My little joint seems to be the hot place these days for powerful Alphas like yourself.” He paused for a second, and Dean was sure he could feel the Alpha’s eyes on his body. “If I weren’t already the head of my own pack, I would seriously consider joining yours Castiel, just for a shot at your pretty little bitch. He’s quite gorgeous.”
Dean knew he should have seen this coming. His father had never been happy to have an omega for a son, so of course he kicked him out of the house the moment he turned 18. Dean wasn’t sure what to do or where to go. If he went to an omega shelter he’d just be put up for sale to the highest bidder, and Dean didn’t want that. He wanted a say in what happened to him.
Dean stumbled over to Benny and collapsed against his chest, happily snuggling into the Alpha’s arms. It didn’t even occur to him anymore that he was naked and Benny was fully clothed, that’s just how he lived now. Dean just nuzzled into Benny’s neck and inhaled deeply, comforted by the Alpha’s familiar scent.
Then the dildo was gone and Castiel’s thick cock was thrusting in to take its place, and before Dean could find the words to protest, Benny’s cock was filling his mouth. His head spun, his mind trying to fight even as his body thrilled to be taken by not one, but two alphas. He couldn’t help but moan as Cas started to pound into him, the sound muffled by the cock fucking his throat.
“Of course,” Castiel said, tugging Dean up to his feet. “But just once, then I want him to rest until tonight.”
Behind him Castiel let out a content sigh and rolled them both over on their sides, spooning Dean as they waited out his knot. “You’re amazing,” he murmured, pressing a gentle kiss to the tender bite mark on the back of Dean’s neck. “I couldn’t ask for a more perfect bitch.” His arms wrapped around Dean’s waist, holding him firmly.
Castiel seemed to take it, and he took a half step back. “You’re very welcome.” He had eyes only for Dean as he added, “I’ll be at the front desk if you need anything.”
“Yum!” Dean declared, reaching out and grabbing the food with his bare hands and bringing it to his mouth.
Castiel lay across Dean’s back for a moment, catching his breath, before he finally stood, still tied to the omega.
Dean knew his father had gotten a small fortune for him. He knew he was pretty, everyone told him so. And his father had done everything he could to groom him into a very marketable omega, including putting him on growth suppressants to keep him petite. Dean wasn’t even close to five feet tall and probably never would be. The suppressants wouldn’t be necessary anymore, frequent breeding would fully halt his growth from here on out.
Dean nodded. “Yes, Alpha.” He loved the snug fit of the heavy collar, it eased his feelings of humiliation and left a content feeling of submission instead.
Castiel helped Dean into the jacket, which was short enough that it left a couple inches of skin showing between the bottom of it and the top of the shorts. Dean could only imagine how he looked in this get up, with his bare legs and ass hanging out the back. He really did look like a true bitch, and Dean couldn’t decide if he was humiliated by the outfit or in love with it.
“Of course.” Balthazar smiled. “I thought you might prefer that, you have a stunning bitch, I don’t blame you for being protective.”
When he tried to crawl away from the bed he discovered the collar around his neck as he was pulled to a hard stop. He looked back to see what looked like a leash, it was hooked to his collar and the loop at the other end was clipped into a carabiner bolted into the wall.
orgasms, that’s only for your alphas and your studs,” Castiel said, smiling as he gently wiggled Dean’s tail back and forth. “But when you’re very good, you can earn yourself a milking.”
Castiel smiled at Benny. “We’ve been working on something this morning. Dean, introduce yourself to Benny.”
“Knot his mouth,” Castiel ordered Benny, and then lined his cock up to Dean’s ass and thrust inside with a hard snap of his hips.
Castiel seemed pleased with Dean’s progress, and he helped him out of the tub and onto his feet before the Alpha dried him off with a large fluffy towel. He scrubbed Dean until he was completely dry so that he wouldn’t get a chill walking around in the nude, even though the house was warm enough for him to be comfortable. Castiel threw the wet towel in the hamper before kissing Dean again and heading into the bedroom to get dressed.
Dean whimpered but started to lick his own come off Castiel’s hand without objection. When he was done he carefully leaned forward, knot still buried in his ass, and lapped his come off the breakfast table. His face burned red, but he still wanted to please Castiel, no matter what.
He’d been dodging his brother for months now, using every excuse he could think of to avoid introducing his brother to his alpha. Because as happy as he was, he didn’t want his little brother to see the kind of omega he’d become.
“That’s a good puppy,” Castiel praised, ruffling Dean’s hair. “Puppies love a cock to suck on, you’ll see.”
Dean was confused, but he obediently climbed out of bed and moved to Castiel. “I thought I wasn’t allowed to wear clothes?”
Castiel chuckled. “Yes, I think that’s obvious,” he said wryly. “But thank you, I’m very pleased with him.”
“Oh, I heard that,” Castiel said with a chuckle, putting down his book. He was sitting on the couch, and he looked over at Dean. “Are you hungry, puppy?”
He crawled into the living room, looking around a little more carefully now. There was a couch and a TV, and four dog beds along the wall, including the one he’d been sleeping on earlier. He spotted the front door, and he crawled over to investigate.
The two Alphas chatted about their moving plans as if Dean weren’t even there, waiting for their knots to go down. When they were finally able to slip free of Dean’s body, Gadreel made sure to replace the plug, keeping the second round of seed secure.
So for a moment he thought he was hallucinating when his two alpha neighbors appeared in the bedroom doorway. The next thing he knew they were on him, grabbing at him as they stripped themselves naked.
The wolf easily repeated the process with Dean’s under garments, and then suddenly the omega was bared to the animal. Again he tried to get away, but he yelped when the wolf snarled and nipped his ass. Dean was shocked to feel his body still on instinct, naturally responding with submission. He tried to tell himself it was just a survival instinct, that he didn’t want this beast to hurt him.
Dean whined and spread his legs, pushing his ass back eagerly for his Alpha. He moaned when he felt Castiel’s thick length press inside him, and soon his mate was thrusting slow and steady, enjoying the lazy pace of morning sex. Dean whimpered, needing more, needing to be taken and filled.
An omega, young and fertile by the scent, and delicious. Castiel glanced around, looking for the source, and noticed a small form huddled against a tree. It was a young omega, wearing jeans and a hoody pulled over his face. Castiel couldn’t even see his features, but he knew by his scent that he must be stunning.
Dean blushed at the alphas words, at their insistence on praising him like a real dog. All he could do was follow them back into the house.
He started to squirm a little, the need to pee getting stronger. He started to whimper around the gag in his mouth, trying to get the attention of the two alphas, hoping they would understand.
It took Castiel longer to come than the other Alphas, but that only made it all the more rewarding when Dean finally got to settle in to suckle his knot as his seed pumped down the back of his throat. Only when Castiel was done and put away did Dean notice all the other Alphas were gone.
Dean didn’t hesitate, even though he couldn’t help the blush as he climbed onto Castiel’s lap, turning so that his back was to his alpha’s chest. He knew his mate wanted him to face out, wanted everyone to see his beautiful omega fuck himself on his knot.
Dean moaned, all he could do to communicate his desperate need, and let his alpha guide him to the coffee table. Someone had set up some kind of bondage rack on it, and Dean was completely pliant as he was helped into it.
Dean wasn’t sure what to do with his new—small—freedom. He looked nervously to the two alphas, who had gone back to preparing their own dinner. He decided to look around the rest of the house, maybe see if he could find a way out.
On the advice of the bartender, they found themselves at a quaint little hotel. It was apparently the same price as a motel and “less soul sucking,” as the girl had put it. The hotel was small and old, but it had more of a charming air than a creepy one, so Dean was pleased with the recommendation.
Dean let out a sleepy groan as he felt his daddy’s fingers run up and down his ass, pushing down to tease at his hole, and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to fall asleep just yet. Daddy could never sleep unless he was inside him, and since he’d already given Dean one of his knots to nurse on it was only fair that he got to play with Dean until his next knot was ready.
Dean shivered, his cock twitching in renewed interest, responding to the dominant nature of his new alpha. “Yes, Alpha,” he said with a smile. “I’ll be good for you.”
“Fuck toys have Alpha seed for breakfast,” Castiel informed him. “You can start with Benny, each Alpha will come in your mouth before they leave for work.”
“Please, Alpha, I’m sorry!” Dean begged as Castiel sat on the couch and dragged the omega down over his lap. “I’ll be good, I won’t do it again!”
“That was unacceptable, Dean,” Castiel said, sounding disappointed. “Now I’m going to have to punish you, you’ve given me no choice.” He roughly yanked Dean’s jeans and briefs down around his knees, baring his ass.
Dean pulled the plug out of his ass and dropped it on the floor, knowing one of the other omegas would pick it up for him, before lowering himself onto his alpha’s hard cock. He let out a low moan as he let his weight push him down on it, until he sat fully impaled, a feeling he never grew tired of.
“No,” Castiel growled, cutting off Dean’s pleas. “Be a good little bitch and show me you can be my little fuck toy. Toys don’t need to come.”
“I’ll see you later!” Dean called as he was dragged out of sight. Once they were on the second floor he yanked his arm out of Sam’s grip and glared at him. “What was that for?”
Dean pulled back, but the thick collar didn’t budge and the leash held strong. He looked around frantically, looking for anything that would help.
Finally, Castiel brought the collar to Dean’s neck and buckled it in place with a small lock. “This collar doesn’t just mean that I own you,” Castiel said seriously. “It means that you’re my responsibility and mine to protect,” he said. “As long as you wear it, I will make sure you’re taken care of. Do you understand?”
Benny grabbed Dean’s collar in one hand and looped a strong arm around Dean’s waist, easily picking him up and carrying him outside. “You can come back in as soon as you go pee,” he said. “Make sure you lift your leg, if you get pee on yourself I’ll have to spray you down with the hose.”
Things were a bit blurry for Dean as the four Alphas left the bar and headed back to Castiel’s, but he was still aware enough to hold on tight to Castiel on the bike. The plug was back in his ass and he was pretty sure he could feel the load of seed it was holding in his belly.
Dean tried not to squirm as he ate, but he couldn’t help the little gasps and whimpers that kept escaping him.
Dean let out a long moan as he was brought down on Castiel’s lap, his alpha’s swollen knot pushing in even deeper as he sat impaled on it. He vaguely realized he’d lost his pants entirely and was naked from the waist down, but his mind was still too fuzzy to care very much.
“Please, Alpha,” Dean begged, climbing onto Castiel’s lap. “You know how I hate being empty…” Dean was sure Castiel had done this to him on purpose, the alpha knew how desperate Dean got when he wasn’t plugged.
“It’s a private Alpha club, only the most elite Alphas are allowed membership.” Castiel smiled. “The only omegas allowed are mates and bitches.”
Dean’s stomach flipped with nerves and excitement, desperate to know what that meant. But he kept his mouth shut, like the good little fuck toy he was.
The truth was, Castiel had always been rather obsessed with castrated omegas, especially ones who were altered at a young age. They were just so wonderfully petite and effeminate, the lack of testosterone making their body small and delicate. They were usually so much more submissive and obedient, and often much more desperate for a knot, as their little cock alone couldn’t make them come. It was Castiel’s dream to mate one.
Dean woke the next morning to the feeling of his Alpha’s strong arms wrapping around him and a hard cock pressing against his backside. Without thinking about it, Dean pressed his ass back against his Alpha’s cock with a sleepy moan, eager to please his mate and ready to be used. He gasped when he suddenly felt the plug being tugged free of his ass, and then Castiel’s thick cock was pushing into Dean’s hole, still slick from the previous night’s many knottings. Dean just moaned and pressed his ass back to meet his Alpha’s thrusts.
“Okay baby, time to give you what you really want,” Castiel’s voice rumbled from behind Dean. “Benny, you can have his mouth again.”
It took all three books by the time Castiel’s knot went down, and Dean reluctantly let his daddy’s cock slip from his mouth. He whined a little and pressed his face to his daddy’s hip, feeling sleepy from his tummy full of milk.
Dean tried to say he didn’t want to be a breeding puppy, but it came out a garbled mess around the ring in his mouth.
Castiel set Dean down in his special omega chair at the table, and in front of him was a plastic plate with cut up pancakes and fruit.
“Yes, Daddy,” Dean said, not making eye contact with anyone as he slipped out of his chair and under the table.
Dean turned eagerly to Benny, crawling to his lap with his mouth open, desperate for any knot he’d be allowed. For the first time he noticed the room was full of alphas, over twenty strangers watching him, but he didn’t care. He gasped as the vibrations in his ass jumped up a level, and he whimpered impatiently as Benny pulled his cock free, and he quickly took it into his mouth and swallowed it down. He moaned around the thick alpha, pleased to finally be allowed to suck and lick, working towards his promised knot.
The Alpha smiled approvingly. “Let me see you properly, come on, stand up.” He reached for Dean’s hands, tugging him to his feet.
Dean’s head spun at the overwhelming feeling and what Castiel was telling him. He cried out when the alpha sat down at the breakfast table, making his knot press firmly against his prostate, Dean’s hard cock switching helplessly.
Dean let out a loud moan as his Alpha used him, hips slapping hard against his sore ass. He realized this was probably the second half of the punishment as the harsh fucking felt like being spanked and fucked at the same time, but he didn’t care, his mind was blurry with pleasure and the relief of pleasing his Alpha.
“Okay buddy, breakfast!” Castiel said, coming into the room and lifting Dean out of the play pen. “You’re going to need a change soon,” he said, patting Dean’s diapered bottom.
Dean heard Castiel growl and then there was a hot tongue lapping at his wet hole. He let out a long moan at the flash of pleasure, but it didn’t last long. The Alpha’s tongue moved quickly up Dean’s spine until he found the back of Dean’s neck. Dean yelped in surprise as the Alpha’s teeth sunk into the skin there, he hadn’t expected the bite to come so soon. His whole body went limp in submission in response to the mating bite, and he felt his channel relax and open wider, ready for the Alpha’s knot.
Castiel led their small group out to the garage, and as they stepped through the door Dean realized he must have been quite distracted by his Alpha when he arrived the day before. He hadn’t noticed how expansive the garage was, it was several car lengths deep and wide. Towards the back was a collection of a dozen motorcycles of varying brands and ages, some contemporary and some classics, but they all looked expensive and pristinely kept. Off to the side was a single bike that sat apart from the rest, handsome but slightly less flashy. When Benny moved to it, Dean realized it must be his.
Benny smiled. “You’re such a good little bitch, Sweetheart. You get so absorbed in serving your alphas that you forget your own release.” The alpha’s strong hand moved to wrap around Dean’s straining little cock, and he slowly started to stroke it.
Grief’s a raw nerve ending. But it can’t last forever. He knows that. It’s not the first time he’s grieved. Not the first time he’s filled his days with drinking and nights with numbness.
More punch was a mistake. Or maybe not. Dean’s feeling great. He also needs to vomit. But that’s just part of feeling great.
The reminder sends a bolt of nausea? -jealousy? -fear? -something, through Dean’s stomach. That’s right, pretending to be married.
He doesn’t say anything much when he brings them home. Cas doesn’t either but he wears the ring more often now. Dean does too, even when they’re not in public. Or even when it’s around Sam or Charlie or the rest of their family.
“Dean was very adamant about bringing me back.” Cas looked over to Dean, a soft smile and look of adoration of his face.
The wallpaper’s a faded seventies print and the room smells like stale cigarettes and coffee and liminal spaces.
Sam has drawn some sort of sigil on the desk, there's candles burning and Cas is holding a stick of incense as Jack stares down Lizzie.
A thickset woman breezed into the room accompanied by the smell of sweat, dust and sheep – or maybe that was just them – and a wide grin under her trucker cap.
Cas and Eileen were retreating off the road, heading towards the shade of a mostly dead looking eucalypt. Dean hesitated. He needed to get out of the sun, but the dying tree looked like it could be a haven for snakes. Then again the entire continent was a haven for snakes, so how much more dangerous could that particular spot be?
Dean tries to play it cool unsuccessfully as he realises the waitress is kind of hitting on his Dad.
“I’m sorry, not that you guys are just characters or anything. But just, when I came back and I found that I was really worried you’d actually died in barn because you fell on a nail.”
They end up on Sam’s Netflix account. So, Dean can snoop and judge more than anything. There’s a half watched terrible looking Netflix original film in his Continue Watching section.
I know that! I'm not saying forever but- This is the first time since I was four that I've had my whole family under one roof- Hell my whole family alive! Can't we just appreciate that for a moment? For one dinner even?
He wanted to go home. Back to the bunker, back to archiving cursed objects and reading lore and working on the actual damn problem at hand. And for a while there he’d thought he wanted to get out of The Life? Ha!
Dean laughed, “Sure, we’ll put it on the bucket list right after Hell and Florida. What do you think Cas?”
He prayed the first few nights. Racing after Chuck he prayed and he prayed and he hoped that Cas could hear him. But after Chuck was gone and the days started to blur praying became too much. It was just a reminder of the silence that would always face him.
Cas came over and sat in the chair where Sam had been and placed his hands on the table. He met Dean’s gaze, seeming genuinely concerned.
The room has emptied. Dean gathers the empty pizza boxes as Cas rinses their plates in a comfortable silence.
Dean notices and elbows Cas who begins solemnly making an honorary burger, glancing up only to briefly glare at John.
Mary doesn't answer. An implicit 'no' hangs in her silence and even Sam doesn't know how to take that.
He had a fond smile on his face as Dean moved to the next candy packet. And- Oh God was that a hickey on his neck? A hickey on Castiel, ex-angel of the lord’s neck and his brother had put it there. That at least explained Dean’s good mood that morning. But-
He just went to bed. He kept asking if you hated John and why everyone always said he was such a good guy but you seemed so angry with him.
And now they were on the final leg of their tour, a 4WD adventure up the John Egan Pioneer Track complete with
“You know I love him and I’m glad it’s him up there instead of Chuck, but the dude is also three. He took his favourite teddy bear to heaven with him.”
But before there’d always been other things to distract him. After Sam there’d been Lisa and Ben, Sam and Jack after Cas and then Chuck and the end of the goddamn world after Mary.
Dad, that was a lifetime ago. I'm not... I'm not angry at you. You've been gone a long time and- Dean was right, I don't know how you're here but I'm glad you are because, I didn't get to say goodbye. And, that hurts more than anything else that's happened.
There was red dirt and blinding blue-white sky as far as the eye could see. It was a struggle to even see that because the sun was so friggin’ bright. Had this place ever heard of clouds? It should really get onto that. Even if Dean did manage to keep his squinted eyes open, there was nothing much to see but heat haze and yellowish trees and shrubs. Surely that wasn’t healthy - plants that dry should just give up and die. After five minutes in this place, Dean sure wanted to.
Dean’s are empty. He’s cried enough tears and he isn’t going to let some ghostly hallucination draw more from him now.
Dean tries to slip into his Hallmark-movie cover story, “Well,” he starts with an expression that he hopes comes across as giddy and not manic, “we’re newlyweds. Just got married a couple of months ago, and we’re looking to buy a motel. You know a real fixer upper. And we saw the ad for the motel just outside town and it looked just like what we’ve both been dreaming of, don’t ya think hun?”
That's enough, the threshold is crossed. Dean sighs and walks inside, taking a seat across from Cas.
Dean stands up just as the temperature of the room plummets. The sound of a scream echoes from the bathroom.
Cas looked up from the window, “I haven’t been to Australia for several thousands of years so it is nice to see it again.” He paused, “Apart from when I was banished to Perth, but I just saw the dog races then, so I don’t think that was representative of the whole country.”
Becky leant back in her armchair letting out a sigh of relief. “I’m glad you guys are ok. You too Cas, he was really adamant about killing you off.”
Things hadn’t been perfect, but they had seemed damn close. Sure Dean was mad to be stuck in freaking Earth Hell with nosy ass motel owners and no car and a sun that seemed personally out to kill him but… He took one of Cas’s hands in his own. His stomach still flipped a little every time he did that. Here was an ex-angel sitting across the table from him worried about his dumb car and enjoying stupid beetroot-ridden-burgers and holding his hand like they were awkward teenagers.
Sam turned the key and the car started. More muttering from Dean. Sam put the car into drive and pulled out onto the road leaving Johnny, Jen, Josie and Stonehenge in the rear-view mirror.
Sam and Dean stand, leaning on the outside wall. Sam's eating what might be his breakfast but also his dinner from the night before too. Dean dabs antiseptic on a cut along his forearm.
“The building out the back, did that use to be a laundromat?” Dean asks before he realises he’s even thinking about it.
They stop, facing each other in a stand off. John with pent up everything, Cas with a bag of hamburger buns.
Dean jerks his head up as Cas takes the ring off his finger and places it on the bed stand. A green stain encircling his ring finger.
Charlie pushes the laptop and gun aside, placing a plate of eggs down on the table. She looks across to Stevie on the other side of the table as she starts eating her eggs.
And you were being so helpful? If you're this family's guardian angel or whatever then were the hell were you!? You could have stepped in and stopped this family from falling apart! Why did every angel or whoever decide to leave it to us to suffer?
They already know all of them of course, read all the accounts of the deaths in the local news and the police files classifying them all as tragic accidents and suicides. It’s sounding like it’s probably just a ghost or potentially a few of them. They’ll be out of here within a week if not sooner.
And Cas. Cas, who is sat struggling with an Allen key as he puts together the furniture for one of the motel rooms. They haven’t been anywhere today and they’re not going anywhere but he’s wearing his ring on his fourth finger like he does almost every day now.
“Yeah, we’re going to pick up a new car this afternoon but Josie’s just showing us the sights first.” Eileen smiled.
“I just wanted to say welcome to the neighbourhood.” Larry puts on his friendliest smile but it doesn’t quite cover up his obvious fear of the place, “As a neighbourly thing, not a professional rivals thing.”
That's all you want to do. Just get rid of him. It's Dad! And I know he's angry but we just turned his whole world upside down on him.
John had spent the morning at a bench huddled over his journal, but by the afternoon even he joined in for a mini-train ride. Before they left, Dean stole him a crappy dinosaur magnet from the souvenir shop which Sam treasured for a while but later lost, left behind in some motel room or another. But that night, curled up on a lumpy mattress that smelt of cigarettes and spilt beer, Sam made a vow that when he was an adult, he was going to go on holidays all the time.
Eileen opened her mouth, closed it and took a deep breath. “Well, if I hadn’t been brought along, would I ever have seen any of the things we saw this morning?” she tried for a lighter tone.
The Kombi van ground to a halt in front of them, obviously surprised to see another living thing in the barren hellscape.
“Well- yeah I think Charlie got them really cheap so… I mean we only have to wear them in front of Larry and the real estate agent.” Dean replies as he takes his own ring off and throws it on the table by his side of the bed.
Dean takes another sip of the punch. Whatever Larry’s mum’s recipe is he needs to get it off her. This stuff is delicious. Not as nice as a good beer but…
“It’s just a packet of frogs! Why frogs? Doesn’t even say what they taste like.” Dean was holding up a packet of bright red coloured gummy frogs.
A moment later the phone buzzed again, a small smile tugged at his face as he texted something back.
Sam took the passports from her hand, frowning at the golden kangaroo and emu crest under a neatly emblazoned ‘Australia’ at the top.
Dean placed the burger back on the plate and stared out the window. The sun was still over-bright as it reflected off the barren red earth, even this late in the day. Great, so now Earth Hell had even managed to ruin burgers. Freaking Australia. Dean just wanted to go home.
Did they have Krunch Cookie Crunch back when you're from? It's my favourite cereal. Although my favourite food is nougat. But Sam says I shouldn't eat too much of either because they're both very unhealthy.
Dean helps Cas up off the ground. Cas GRUNTS, his neck hurts. He moves his hand up to find a gash there. Not deep enough to be serious but it is bleeding.
Two hours later, Dean’s good mood had disappeared, Johnny was fixing a lawn mower, Cas was halfway through a book on the geology of Western Queensland, Eileen was asleep, and Sam was stressing.
Sam’s eyes snapped up. Eileen was standing in front of him, a cracker packet in either hand. ‘SHAPES’ the packets declared themselves.
“Nah yeah that’d be great.” Jen hefted the box into her arms, “You think you could give these guys a lift out? They’re gonna come look at the Commodore.”
We were not 'buddies' then. But Dean and Sam have taught me many important things. We have since grown... closer.
They waved their goodbyes and walked back over to the Impala. Dean got in behind the wheel, Sam in shotgun and Cas in the back.
So, of course Dean and his former heavenly warrior boyfriend had the healthy relationship here. They knew each other. They were best friends. They had things in common and inside jokes. They’d been to Hell and back. They had ‘a more profound bond’.
I can't believe the resources here. I mean there's books here on how to kill things I didn't even know existed.
Dean nodded, it appeared they’d agreed to take a break. Maybe if they waited till the sun set being here might become bearable.
“In that case we call Charlie, get a full list of probable suspects and try and hit all the graves in one night?”
Jack didn’t meet Dean’s eyes. It was strange seeing God look guilty. Like they’d caught him eating an entire box of sugary cereal at 3am again. It struck Sam like a physical blow how young he still was.
It takes almost a year to get the motel up and operating. The first weeks pass by in a blur and at least five small things seem to go wrong for every big thing that goes right. It’s stressful and there’s a few moments where Dean finds himself stopping and wondering what the hell he was thinking giving up hunting and a life he understands to pursue owning a fucking business. But then a hunter named Anya turns up, so grateful to find somewhere to break a curse and clean her guns without being questioned. Then the old couple on their road trip across America who grill Cas on every recommendation he has for places to see. Soon there’s a young family whose kids adore Miracle and before they leave the little boy gives Dean a crudely drawn artwork of Miracle chasing a squirrel and it was sweet and unprompted and the mother wishes him and his “husband” well before they leave. These are human connections Dean hasn’t really ever experienced and this life is nice in a way life never was before.
Dean let out a howl as he came instantly, permission all he needed to fall over the edge.  He moaned and squirmed as it crashed over him, then whimpered into the cool counter top as he slowly came down.
Castiel laughed softly, pulling himself up and pushing Dean over on his back in one fluid movement. He propped himself up with his arms on either side of Dean’s face, smiling down at the omega. The position made Dean feel small and submissive in a way no alpha before had ever been able to manage.
Dean whimpered and shook his head. “Didn’t ask, too fuzzy.” He didn’t yet understand the way submission and need made his mind so hazy.
Castiel groaned into Dean’s hair. “Not during bath time, Dean,” he said, reluctantly. “We’ll get stuck in here and be all pruney by the time my knot goes down.” His hand trailed down to push a finger inside Dean’s hole. “You’ll just have to be a good boy and wait.”
Dean heard Castiel give someone permission and the next thing his new there were hands on his ass and fingers probing his slick entrance, still leaking seed from his alpha’s last knot. He moaned as two fingers pushed inside, then gasped when they were suddenly pulled free and replaced with a thick cock.
The rack held him on his hands and knees, his shoulders and hips strapped down to two well padded beams, letting his swollen belly hang in between. There was soft padding under his knees, his wrists were strapped into place and his legs were secured to a spreader bar. It left him completely on display.
Dean just whined. Benny kept teasing and playing with Dean, toying with his nipples and his cock, until his knot finally slipped free. Benny’s teasing continued for a while, and Dean was so distracted by it that he didn’t realize the Alpha had grown hard again until suddenly he grabbed Dean’s ass and thrust his huge cock back into Dean’s hole. Dean moaned and pushed back against the Alpha’s rough thrusts, accepting the fucking like a good bitch.
Dean cried out and arched his back, coming in his panties as his alpha slammed into him, knot finally swelling and locking into place. With a couple more short thrusts Castiel came with a groan, seed spilling deep inside the omega.
The knot didn’t take long, a fast fuck usually made for a short knot, and soon the man was slipping out and stepping aside. The next man didn’t bother teasing Dean, just pulled out his hard cock and slammed into the omega’s sloppy hole, jumping to a fast pace.
cock. As a doctor, Castiel knew it wasn’t really a good idea for a tiny omega to take an eleven inch cock, if they weren’t built for it they could be seriously injured. The real trouble was that made the fantasy of a castrated omega all the stronger for Castiel, he desperately wanted to have a tiny omega impaled on his massive cock, just the thought made his cock twitch.
Castiel chuckled and started to pump Dean’s cock faster and rut his knot against Dean’s prostate at the same time. “Okay little bitch, come for your Alpha.”
“Okay, go clean yourself up and get back to bed, you need to rest.” Castiel said with a smile. “When you wake up I’m going to have a surprise for you.”
Castiel snarled as he slammed in harder, driving in the last few inches until his heavy balls finally slapped against Dean’s ass and his massive cock was blissfully fully seated inside the little omega. He stilled for a moment to enjoy it before he started to move again, hips snapping as he thrust deep inside Dean.
“I’m going to watch,” Castiel said seriously. “I want to make sure you can take appropriate care of him and follow my rules. We’ve already discussed the consequences of breaking them, I want to make sure you can be trusted with my mate.”
“Are you always this much of a slut?” Castiel growled, hands coming up to drag down Dean’s body. “Offering yourself up just to get out of a damn ticket?”
Sam fell asleep easily that night, but Dean did not. His mind was full of thoughts of the alpha downstairs, and as soon as he decided Sam was in a deep enough sleep he got out of bed. He pulled on a pair of jeans and a teeshirt, not bothering with shoes before he padded out of the room, grabbing a keycard and putting it in his back pocket before letting the door close quietly behind him.
Dean could feel his daddy’s cock getting hard again where it was pressed against his leg, and he whined and rubbed against it. “Daddy, knot! Please, Daddy!” He begged, desperate to be full again.
But first Castiel had to unpack his brief case and get ready for the day, so Dean just climbed up onto the couch in the corner of the room and waited patiently. He noticed a toy ball he’d left there the previous day and he smiled and picked it up, rolling it around on the cushion.
Eight months later Dean was very settled into his new life. Although being heavily pregnant was still new, but Castiel had insisted he get used to that as well, because he’d promised Dean
Dean gasped for air as he came down from his orgasm, his whole body centered on the knot filling him with one more round of Alpha seed. He loved being knotted by the other Alphas, but nothing compared to being knotted by
Dean smiled and cuddled back into his daddy’s arms. He was so happy to be filled and held that he didn’t even mind his hard little cock still straining for release. He’d get to come tomorrow, he wasn’t worried about it.
Dean’s stomach fluttered with excitement, and he quickly dropped to his knees between his alpha’s open legs. He carefully opened Castiel’s pants and pulled out his half hard cock, taking it into his mouth. It rested heavily on his tongue, and he couldn’t help the pleased little hum at the feeling.
Castiel nodded, continuing to tease the cute little cock, brushing it with his fingers before gently grasping it and tugging. “Castrated omegas usually can’t quite get fully hard, you should be enjoying this, but it wouldn’t be able to give you an orgasm. Does it feel good, Dean?”
Castiel’s strong hands gripped Dean’s hips, starting to guide him up and down the length. “Slower,” he ordered, just as a few of his guests made their way over.
“That’s it, good bitch,” Castiel praised. After a moment he pulled away to lead Dean out of the garage and into the main house. He wrapped a possessive arm around Dean’s waist as they stepped into the entrance hall.
Dean’s life as a bitch was a simple one. When his alpha was away on a hunt he was allowed free roam of the camp. When his alpha was home he was at his side obediently, waiting to be used. He wore a leather collar with the words “Castiel’s Bitch” tooled on it. Other than that he wore a short, flowing pink skirt with a slit all the way up the back. This allowed it to fall open when Dean was on his hands and knees, a position he found himself in quite frequently.
“I’m so good,” Dean gasped out with a moan. “I’m a good bitch, obedient a-and eager for you, Alpha.” He whimpered as Castiel teased the head of his cock with his thumb. “Please, Alpha, please! I promise not to come without permission! I’ll be such a good fuckhole for you, I promise, please just let me come!”
Dean gasped when the movement made the plug shift in his hole, but he followed his Alpha obediently.
Suddenly the omega’s hand shot out and ran down the length of Castiel’s cock where it tented his slacks, and the alpha gasped at the sudden flair of pleasure.
Dean slowly nodded. He wasn’t sure what to expect from meal time, but he wasn’t going to starve himself.
“Good boy,” Benny praised, wrapping an arm around Dean’s chest and pulling him up in his arms. He moved back to his seat at the table and sat down, letting the omega sit impaled on his knot.
Benny chuckled as he wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist so he could lift him into bed. He laid them both down to wait out his knot. “You’re just a little cock slut, aren’t you? Tell me how much you love my cock.”
Dean moaned and squirmed on the cock in his ass. He couldn’t believe that he was actually being turned on by this proposition. He nodded nervously. “Yes, Alpha. I can be a good fuck toy for you.”
“Ok, breakfast is served boys,” Benny said, dishing out four plates of food, making sure to put extra on Castiel’s plate for Dean. “Give me a hand here?” He gestured to Gadreel, who nodded and moved to help Benny serve up the meal.
The whole time Dean worked Benny’s cock, Castiel was playing with the remote, running the vibrations up and down, making Dean moan and squirm. He was putting on quite the show.
“After each spank you are to say, ‘I’m sorry, Alpha, please give me another,’” Castiel ordered. “Do you understand?”
Dean stood and turned to Castiel, trying to ignore the slick and come running down the inside of his legs.
Dean blushed and covered his face with his hands as Castiel made quick work of changing his diaper, and soon he was clean and dry again. He peaked through his hands up at his daddy.
“That’s my good fuckhole,” Castiel praised, pulling Dean’s face in for a deep kiss. His tongue pushed inside and explored, tangling with Dean’s before the Alpha pulled back.
“Okay, let’s get you changed and dressed for the day,” Castiel said with a smile. “I have a very cute outfit for you.”
A sharp smack suddenly landed on Dean’s ass and the omega yelped and arched his back, pushing his ass back just in time to receive the second one. The alpha’s hand landed heavily on his tender backside, and Dean realized this was going to be a real punishment, not just a playful smack or two. The realization made his whole body burn with desire.
Castiel chuckled. “If it turns out you enjoy being spanked too much, I’ll have to come up with something else.” He thrust his hips into Dean, grinding his knot against the omega’s prostate and making him moan. “Now, back to being a good fuck toy, moaning is allowed, but no talking.”
Castiel chuckled. “You smell really good, too.” He leaned in a little closer to Dean, over the counter. “I don’t know if any other omega has ever smelled so good.”
“I can’t, I can’t!” Dean whined, shaking his head back and forth, panting and moaning with each thrust. “It’s too big!”
As the spanking continued, Dean was surprised to feel his hole start to leak slick. Even as tears started to fall from the burning pain, his body was humming with pleasure, happy to take the punishment he deserved. When Castiel was done, Dean lay there quivering, gasping for breath and feeling desperately needy.
He caught the scent first, and it was delicious. When he looked up he found an incredibly handsome alpha standing next to his car, with dark hair and sharp blue eyes. When he spoke it was deep and rough, and Dean’s stomach flipped.
Dean just moaned louder. “Yes, Alpha. Oh please,” he gasped out, overwhelmed by the rough treatment he was getting. It just felt so damn good. “Wanna be used, please!”
Dean let out a soft groan as he laid back in the water’s soothing heat, and when Castiel flipped on the jets it felt so good he whimpered. Castiel just smiled and picked up a soft wash cloth and soap, lathering it up before he started to wash Dean’s neck and shoulders. Dean closed his eyes and let out a sigh, feeling more content in that moment than he’d ever felt. Then his stomach grumbled.
Benny grinned and squeezed Dean’s ass. “Hopefully we’ll have more Alphas in our little pack very soon,” he said. “Better to keep our little fuckhole well used.”
Dean’s whole body seemed to melt in shock and pleasure, overcome by so many overwhelming sensations. He was mated. He was tied to his mate’s knot. He was going to be a pack bitch. It was almost too much.
From there Dean found the hall and he decided to check it out. But all he found was a half bathroom and an office, so he crawled back out into the living room.
Consciousness returned slowly to Dean. The first thing he was aware of was that he was curled up on a large fluffy pillow on the floor of someone’s living room. The next thing he noticed was a cock shaped gag in his mouth and the fullness of a plug in his ass.
Dean’s face burned at his alpha’s suggestion, but he obeyed, sitting up so that he was straddling his alpha’s lap instead, up on his knees with his ass out and available. He bent over and buried his face in his alpha’s neck, too embarrassed to watch and too desperately horny to do anything but obey and wait to be fucked.
Dean had his eyes submissively low as Castiel lead him into the restaurant, but he squeezed his alpha’s hand affectionately, pleased to be there with him. He had his attention entirely on obeying his alpha, so he didn’t even glance up at the others at the table as they approached it.
“I’ll be in my office,” Castiel said, standing up and pushing in his chair. “If you tire of him, bring him to me, I want that belly full and I don’t want to waist any downtime between knots.” With that he made his way out of the room.
Dean ignored the jealousy in the other omega’s voice. He knew that she would give anything to trade places with him, and he really couldn’t blame her.
Dean let out a long moan, humiliation and pleasure mixing at his Alpha’s words. He couldn’t help being turned on by being so casually used by his mate. “Yes, Alpha. I can be your good little fuck toy,” he gasped out, submitting without question.
“Slower,” Castiel said, reaching around to hook his fingers in Dean’s collar. He smiled when the omega immediately reduced his pace, his mouth moving with luxurious care up and down Castiel’s cock, taking his time to pay extra attention to each part of the alpha’s length. “Good omega,” Castiel murmured.
Dean’s mind was spinning. He’d never wanted anything more in his entire life. “Oh please, yes Alpha, I need to be owned! Oh god, please!”
“I got you baby,” Castiel said, groaning as he wrapped his arms around Dean and slammed in harder, driving into his omega until his knot finally started to swell.
“Take him for me please, Benny,” Castiel said, gently pushing Dean towards the other Alpha. “I’ve got to call the caterers and he’s quite the distraction in this state,” he said with a chuckle. “Do give him a short break before you knot him next, he’s pretty worn out.”
Dean whimpered as the spanking continued and he started to feel his body responding to the alpha. His little cock was getting hard, pressing against the alpha’s leg, and slick was slowly running from his hole. His body knew what was coming next, and it wanted the alpha.
“You can,” Castiel growled, his knot swelling as he intentionally pushed in and out of the omega, feeling the boy’s tight rim stretch around him. “Your body was made for this.” He watched as each thrust made the omega’s belly bulge with the fullness of his cock.
Dean’s face burned with embarrassment as he could only wait out the man’s knot. Even still, he felt the desire in him grow again, just from knowing how many alphas were waiting to use him.
“He does, doesn’t he? Do me a favor Benny, greet our guests for me, I’m going to be indisposed for a while.”
By the time Dean had finished eating he was starting to squirm. His diaper was so full, by now he’d also wet it, adding to mess of slick and seed. It squished when he moved, making Dean blush.
Dean blushed and smiled, ducking his face a little into Castiel’s chest. “I’m good, Alpha,” he murmured submissively.
Dean whimpered softly around the gag, embarrassed to be talked about in such a manner. And yet his cock strained with need, his body aching with want, almost as if in response to being treated like an object for Castiel’s pleasure.
“Oh wow,” Dean breathed, feeling the weight in his hands. “You’re so big! Are all alphas as big as you, Dr. Novak?”
The man had caved of course, but Dean wasn’t old enough to be claimed. And Castiel wanted the absolutely perfect mate, so he’d sent Dean away to an omega training school for two years.
The omega girl appeared quickly. “Yes, alpha?” Her eyes flicked to Dean, still nursing Castiel’s cock, and the alpha didn’t miss the look of jealousy.
“Oh you’re going to be used alright,” Castiel murmured. “We have a two hour train ride and you’re going to get what you asked for. Let’s see how many knots you can take in that time.”
Suddenly that thick cock shoved it’s way inside Dean, and the omega cried out as he was filled with one firm thrust. His mouth hung open and he moaned as the huge cock paused, letting him adjust to being so full, before he pulled out and slammed back in, quickly setting a claiming pace.
He knew it was an alpha, Dean could smell the scent of the stranger as he gripped Dean’s hips and slammed in hard, making the omega cry out. The shock of pain and pleasure was overwhelming, and Dean could only moan and push his ass back to meet the cock driving into him.
Dean whimpered and moaned, trying to push back against the growing cock, but unable to with his face pressed to the bed. He still couldn’t understand the way his body responded to such rough treatment, he just knew it felt good. He panted desperately as the pleasure grew, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, until Benny’s hard knot filled and slammed into him, and Dean came with a cry.
Dean let out a little whimper, shocked to feel his body respond to the praise, a wave of submissive instincts washing through his body. He tried to fight it, not wanting to give in.
Throughout the meal, Dean did his best to be obedient and submissive for his alpha, but he found it a little difficult with his brother sitting there. He wished he could just slip back into his normal, comfortable obedience, but he felt like he needed to try harder. That it wasn’t coming quite naturally.
Dean was shaking and moaning as Castiel leaned down to cover the small boy with his body, picking up his pace and fucking him harder. “This is going to seem like nothing in a minute,” he said into Dean’s ear. “You still have to take my knot.”
Dean’s only response was to moan around the cock in his mouth, hoping that would answer the question. He let out a muffled yelp in surprise when Castiel pulled him down further on his cock, and he was startled for a moment as the Alpha’s thick cock was stuffed down the back of his throat.
Dean smiled at Castiel. “Thank you.” He bit his lip and looked at his lap. “There’s one other thing…”
Dean worked Benny’s cock with expert attention, until he finally felt the knot start to swell inside his mouth. He moaned as it filled him, he always loved being full at both ends, he only wished it were his alpha’s knot in his ass instead of a plug.
The teenager looked up at Castiel with wide eyes, somehow both scared and defiant. He was stunning, green eyes and freckled cheeks, absolutely gorgeous. And he smelled amazing, he was fertile and clearly compatible with Castiel.
Castiel went back to work, and Dean finally looked down at the piece of paper on Castiel’s desk. It was a guest list, and at the top was written “Dean’s coming out party.”
Castiel grinned. “We’re having a little party tonight.” He moved to Dean and put out a hand to help Dean up off the couch.
Castiel sighed and nodded. “Yeah, I know. I’m actually thinking about visiting an omega mating service today. They’re expensive, but if I can find one that’s particularly beautiful it would be a good investment.”
“Come on, let’s get you cleaned up,” Castiel said, climbing out of bed and pulling Dean up to his feet.
Later that day, Castiel did as he promised, heading out in search of an omega for the pack. Hoping he’d be returning with a mate, he chose to leave his motorcycle at home and take his Jag instead. The car deserved to be driven more often anyway.
Dean couldn’t believe this Alpha was talking about him as if he were some sort of toy to amuse his Alphas. But he was more shocked at how his body was reacting to the Alpha’s words, the trickle of slick was now gushing and soaking his jeans. He hadn’t expected to be so turned on by the prospect of becoming a sex slave to a pack of Alphas, but there was no denying it. He glanced out the car window, trying to convince himself to just leave. But the Alpha was right, the streets were dangerous and he’d end up claimed eventually, and probably not to an Alpha who could provide the resources this man was offering.
He made a break for it, turning and dashing for the front door. If he could just get out on the street, he might be able to outrun the man, maybe hide in one of the neighbors’ yards until morning.
“Daddy…” Dean moaned, voice sleepy even as he pushed his ass back to meet Castiel’s probing fingers. He whimpered as two of them pushed inside, giving Dean a little stretch. His cock was already so hard from nursing on Daddy’s cock, and even though the fingers felt so good he knew he wasn’t allowed to come when he didn’t have his diaper on. Daddy didn’t like messes in the bed.
Dean whimpered around the gag, squirming and pushing his ass back against the plug. He just couldn’t help himself, the stimulation felt so good, his body so pleased for any pleasure his mates offered him. Even if the manner of it was rather humiliating.
The house was quiet and empty, there didn’t seem to be anyone else home. Dean realized he had no idea if Castiel already lived with other Alphas, and he was afraid to ask.
“Nice to meet you, Dean,” Benny said, fingertips playing idly with one of Dean’s nipples. “I’m glad to have you in our little pack.”
Castiel’s hands started to possessively rubbed Dean’s round ass, making the omega moan around Benny’s knot.
Dean completely lost track of how long he’d been on his alpha’s cock when he finally pulled him off with a gentle tug. He could only watch with blurry eyes as Castiel handed his leash to Benny, sitting on the couch next to them.
Dean pulled the blankets over himself with a deep groan, sinking into the comfortable mattress and the silk sheets. As he fell asleep he was sure he could still feel his Alphas fucking him, and his well used hole twitched eagerly.
Dean moaned around the gag as he was fucked hard again, and it wasn’t long before his mate’s knot was tied inside him again, and Castiel returned him to his hanging position so he could continue his work.
Dean’s stomach did a happy little flip, and for the first time in his life he was excited by the promise of a collar around his neck. “Yes, Alpha,” he agreed, feeling quite content.
“You can strip him down for me,” Castiel said to the Alphas, letting go of Dean’s hand. “His clothes go in the hall closet.”
Dean realized he was grinning, but he didn’t care. He cleared his throat and looked at his hands for a moment before looking up again. “So tell me, what all goes into running a hotel?”
There was also a staircase, but Dean decided he didn’t want to crawl up the stairs. Besides, there wasn’t going to be a way out of the house up there. He let out a long sigh, realizing he was wasting his time.
“I’m not taking you just as my mate,” Castiel said, seriously. “I’m building a pack of seven Alphas. If you choose to come with me, you will be our bitch.”
The two Alpha’s eyes darkened with lust as they took in the sight of Dean. They shared a quick glance and a nod before Balthazar spoke again.
Once they were home and Dean had been changed again, Castiel got to work on dinner while Dean played quietly in his playpen in the living room. Dean was always a good boy at night, a long day of knots left him happy and relaxed, eager to please his daddy. So he played with his toys until his daddy came to get him for dinner.
Castiel chuckled behind Dean as he climbed into position. “Of course baby, Daddy will always take care of you.”
“Excuse me, Dr. Novak,” Dean said, interrupting the stillness of the room. “May I please ask you a question?”
“Thank you, Alpha,” Dean murmured, leaning into Castiel’s neck again. The alpha smelled so intoxicating with the scent of arousal rolling off him, and Dean couldn’t help but beg a little. “Want your knot, Alpha, please…”
“Do you want to see how beautiful your brother looks right now?” Castiel offered. The alpha’s hands ran through Dean’s hair. “Look at me, baby.”
They checked into the first hotel they saw on the main street. It was a relief being able to tap a credit card for two rooms and not have a niggling worry about whether or not it would be declined. Sam wondered if, after they got back home, Jack might let them keep the bank accounts he’d set up for them here. He’d found their account details and passwords written in a book in his bag the night before. Signing into the accounts, he could see that Jack had left them with enough to retire on - cruise trip, small private island and grandkids’ college tuition fees included.
“A bad thing… But it’s ok!” Jack looked up at them again, “I have managed to contain it to a smallish area. It cannot escape those limits whilst I work out how to put it back again.”
He leaves just after 1am. Sam’ll be out for at least a few more hours. He leaves a note anyway on the cheap motel notepad –
There wasn’t even any signal so he there was no chance for doing any research. Not that he really knew what to start searching.
Sam took a step back from the oven, leaning against the kitchen counter. The bunker was quiet these days. Eileen was somewhere in the depths – gone to put some artefacts back in storage before dinner. She was here more often than not these days, but the place still felt quiet.
Dean shrugs and shifts closer to Cas, “Why would I be troubled? The world’s not ending, we get to go house hunting for haunted motels tomorrow and Charlie’s promised to shout lunch. Things are looking good to me.”
Dean places his coffee on the bench and walks over to open it. They’re not expecting visitors. Bronte the real estate agent had visited the day before to see how they’d gone moving in and to announce her imminent retirement to the Bahamas. But apart from her no one else has been very keen to visit them unannounced.
“Look man, there’s gotta be some perks to being a hunter. And if being able to buy cheap haunted real estate is one of them…”
Oh, Castiel took me there this morning. It was really cool. It seemed like somewhere you might have taken Sam and Dean. It's like Stonehenge in England but it's all made out of old cars.
Dean is massacring some tomatoes, the Michelin star chef of the morning long gone. He works away alone in the kitchen deep in thought.
When he was little, and for a good time after that, he’d dreamt of that too. The mythic John and Mary’s white picket fence, American Dream, marriage and the nice house in the suburbs. He has enough experience and history now to know it was never quite as perfect as John had tried to convince himself. Still, marriage had been something to aspire to. Marriage meant you’d done life the good and proper way, you’d conquered all your demons -it was the happily ever after with everyone in their proper place.
Eileen was in the chocolates section reading the labels intently. She’d been so happy that morning at the lookout. She deserved that. She deserved to be happy. She didn’t deserve to be in this stupid supermarket on the other side of the world staring at brands she didn’t recognise.
A manic glint enters Larry’s eyes as he leans forward to tell them of the suicides in Room 4 and the woman who died of fright in Room 12 and the child who drowned in Room 6. How the motel was run into the ground, how the old man kept it until a year ago when he electrocuted himself with a razor. He lets his voice go into full-on spooky-story-on-Halloween-night mode and it’s weirdly soothing. Dean lets his arm actually relax around Cas’s shoulders as the facts of the case wash over him.
It was like he was existing in a weird liminal space. He had vague plans for the future. Plans to transform the bunker, make it into what it had been designed to be – a place of refuge and research. But there was no hurry.
They don’t talk much but between the music Sam fills the silence. He calls Eileen who says she’ll meet them when they get back. She’s happy to hear about Cas.
Jack looked confused, like he expected to be told off, not met with enthusiasm. “Oh, no. No, Chuck is gone and you’re retired. You don’t have to save the world anymore. You just need to go somewhere safe so you can live your lives like you deserve. You can have your beach holiday!”
“At least Donna’s got the Impala safely home,” Sam attempted to console his brother, “so it’s not permanent.”
“-No. No, I meant that. Remind me to repeat that in the- in the morning.” The world sways a little and it’s not from being in love. “Or not the morning, maybe like next week.”
What reason did Eileen have to be with Sam? Knowing him had already gotten her killed once before. It’d gotten her tortured by Chuck and snapped from existence. And now it had trapped her on the other side of the world.
You said you killed Yellow-Eyes and that was it! You've just been hunting. And now you're making deals with
“Well, we don’t have any other real plans. And I think it would be interesting to learn how to run a business and you don’t want to keep hunting forever.”
They hadn’t gone on with the newlyweds story. Bronte had been so stressed about selling the place that she didn’t care if they were a respectable married couple or three rats in a trenchcoat who wanted to turn the place into a front for the Macedonian mafia. And besides her, they’d barely spoken properly to anyone in town since moving in. Charlie had been bummed her elaborate backstories had gone to waste but it had been such a simple hunt in the end…
“No Dean,” Cas said, “we’re not just going to sit around, but Sam and Eileen are right. Jack doesn’t want us there right now. Besides, there’s no use running back until we at least know what we’re fighting.”
“No, I was just getting into character.” He takes a seat on the old lumpy mattress. All the mattresses would need replacing but the bedframes are solid wood. With a sand and a polish they’d come up good. Not that it mattered, they aren’t…
I was raised a hunter. I am a hunter. I'm good at it but- I just wanted a normal life. A normal life with a normal man where my children could be safe.
Dean can’t sleep. Typical. He stares at the faded wallpaper on the dingy hotel room wall. The pull feels like a burning. He wants to throw up. But then again, he wants to throw up most of the time these days.
Dean chuckled, “I mean I’m personally good with never doing my laundry. But you’re right, it’s weird but good.”
“Literally growing on the sheep’s back, Blackall became a thriving outback township in the early years. Today, you can discover the region’s wool heritage at the Historic Blackall Woolscour, the last remaining scour in Australia, a virtual living museum, where friendly volunteers can take you on an intimate guided tour through the complex.” Eileen read out from whatever website she had open.
They don’t really talk about it after that. They do their own thing, concentrate on getting the motel up and running and continue telling the people in town their fake backstory while Sam and Eileen give them more and more ridiculous looks.
The backpackers announced they were now on their way to a campsite outside of Stonehenge and could drop them off in town if they’d like. Dean was not very good with international geography, but he was pretty sure Stonehenge was in England and not the Australian desert. Then again, he did live in a Lebanon in Kansas, so apparently people just weren’t original with names here either.
- Dean brushes against Cas as he reaches for a piece of pizza. He catches his mother watching them. She smiles and his face softens.
The intruder examines the closest object, a small obelisk thing. They run their hands over the strange carved glyphs.
Because what he did is still hurting you. You still think you have to be the things you're not. You still think you always have to look after everyone - to look after Jack and Sam and - You still don't think you deserve to be loved or cared for yourself. You said you wanted to pretend to be a happy family. You are pretending, even when he's not here, you're still pretending.
If they weren’t four seasoned hunters, they might have jumped at the sudden appearance of their recently deified adopted son in the hallway. As it was, Jack just ended up with two guns, an angel blade and a spatula pointed menacingly at him.
Becky shrugged, taking her laptop back from Sam as his face twitched uncomfortably. “Who did I even marry? Like, it wasn’t even Eileen?”
Dean doesn’t know why his cheeks flush at that. He doesn’t know why he sat down so much closer to Cas. Or rather he does know but he’s not sure if it’s the moment yet.
Cas doesn't say anything. He watches Billy and his mum as they head to their own car. Billy catches sight of Jack and waves with his whole tiny body.
“I’m afraid you’ll leave.” He wants to look away but he forces himself to hold Cas’s gaze. “Cas, please stay.”
“So we just sit here and wrestle crocodiles and look at rocks or whatever it is Australians do and just hope Jack sorts it out?”
“Yes, but we can’t prove that. And…” Eileen glanced a look at Cas, “Jack’s given us enough so no one will question us being here. But if he really doesn’t want us to leave then I don’t think our identities are secure enough to get us back into America.”
Dean isn’t really listening to him as he cleans his guns on the coffee table. His back still hurts a little from trying to get blood out of the carpet in room 3 after those vamps had decided to try and attack the young woman staying in there. Turns out they hadn’t known exactly whose motel they’d snuck into until their heads were hitting the carpet. The woman had left pretty quickly after that and Dean was once again feeling grateful they’d decided to go with dark carpets in all the rooms. Although god forbid anyone ever brought a blacklight here.
