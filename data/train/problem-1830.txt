There was no good way to get to the doors, and he doubted his ability to get anywhere even if he did manage an escape.
The mailbox sported the name Holmes. An Omega of the same name had quit Scotland Yard that same day. It was considered highly likely that this was the same man.
“I’ve brought tea.” She stated the obvious. She placed the tray of teacups on a table by Sherlock, and sat in an armchair opposite him. “So John, tell us about yourself.”
John rolled his eyes. He might not get the traditional Alpha/Omega relationship, but this would certainly be an adventure.
“I worked with a bunch of beavers who could not see past their noses yet refused to let me on any substantial cases.” John nodded. Sherlock didn’t elaborate. Jon wearily tried another question.
There were really only two things he could have been called here for. Anderson, or his conversation with--
It was John. He was early. It was strange enough to catch Sherlock’s attention. His mind latched onto that fact. As if he had just been released from prison, Sherlock grabbed his coat and headed out the door.
The moment was broken, when Moriarty began slow clapping. Sherlock blinked, then turned to him, whipping out a gun, John hadn’t known he had. A growl rippled from his mouth, as he leveled the gun at his old friend.
He had dabbled in drugs. He was very familiar with the feeling of wanting something so badly it was beyond your ability to resist the urge. He’d tried to get off drugs for that reason. He needed to feel like he had some power over his baser incilinations.
Moriarty looked confused for a moment, before breaking into a grin. “Oh, no, no. You’re not dying by sniper. Sherlock is going to kill you. And you’re going to make sure he does it.”
She’d told him “You sit at the oxygen table, because you are what allows me to breathe in a world full of gaseous atoms who zip around pretending they do anything but take up space.”
“A blind. A ploy to draw attention from…” Sherlock delved into mumbles.”No. there is nothing to distract from. Towards. Look- look towards- blood.” Sherlock halted his frenzied utterances, and ran to his phone. He viciously attacked the screen, and the phone only gave one ring before it was picked up on the other end.
“...and then I didn’t die. I’m actually lost for this part of the story. Sherlock, care to explain?”
Sherlock had given the ladies this power. He had leveled the gun at their heads, thus making it a situation compatible to such an order. That didn’t mean he had to like it.
And then? Hot. Everything was hot. John’s hands were burning off, and tendrils of the fire were hurtling down his arms, searing the flesh off his bones.
“I don’t understand,” a bearded officer said. “You’re an Omega. Was the order to kill him not a compulsion?”
Moriarty pouted. “Hey now. That wasn’t that bad was it? Anyway, you shoot, and you and your mate get your heads blown off.” Sherlock did not put the gun down. Jim’s voice took on the double-edged intonation of a compulsion. “Drop the gun Sherlock.” The gun hit the cafe’s wooden floor. “Sit down.” Sherlock snarled, but took the nearest chair in jerky movements he was clearly struggling against.
A man stepped forward. He was encased in the shadows at the back of the establishment, and Sherlock’s flashlight couldn’t reach him. “Moriarty at your service. Although Sherlock would know me as Jim.” John could hear the smirk in his voice. “Yes, I’m the murderer. I’m sure you saw it coming, Sherl. It's been in the works for a very long time.”
“We have a new seating arrangement today. Max, you will be sitting with Sandra at Helium.” Children shifted around with the directions. Sherlock zoned it out. The tables were arranged and named by elements of the periodic table. He had occupied the Oxygen table since day one, and had not had a partner since Jenny the first week.
“I’ll have a large coffee. Black, two sugars.” Sherlock answered as John spluttered at the use of the word ‘husband.’
“They’re probably looking for the wrong thing, idiots.” He was already walking to the door on the left.
“You summoned?” Sherlock deadpanned. It was the third time that week he’d been called to his bosses office, although it wasn’t entirely his fault.
That had made Sherlock smile. He loved Miss Scott, because she just seemed to get him. While the world was conspiring against him, she made science jokes. She was the only teacher who seemed to understand the way he functioned- alone. So, he had felt mildly betrayed when she assigned him a table partner.
“Yes rules. You agree to my terms, and we can attempt to get to know each other. You don’t adhere to my terms, and you get ghosted. Do you follow?”
Sherlock had laughed “What, have you researched what it would take to open a cafe? You? Own a cafe? Next you’re going to tell me you're going to use puns to name it.”
“I told you it wasn’t likely to be. Her ears were newly pierced.” Their voices became more faint as they went down the stairs.
“Alright, so you observe.” John cocked his head and narrowed his eyes. Sherlock let him hold this position for a few moments before asking,
However, instead of using his newfound freedom to register himself at the desk, he flipped up his collar, nodded at John, and marched out, acting for all the world as if he owned the place.
He kneed upwards, making contact with his landlord’s groin. Clarence recoiled in pain. It was enough for Sherlock to wrench his arms free.
When he looked back on it later, he would say it felt like he’d always heard compulsions described. As if someone had clamped hold of his mouth, and made the words come out, himself a helpless bystander.
Assuming they were taking him to the hospital- and in truth there was no proof- Sherlock’s best bet was to wait until they arrived.
“Serial killings. Playing the violin. Anything with sufficient mental stimulation.” Sherlock met Jon’s gaze head on, and waited for a reaction. The man blinked.
“Right. Well I enjoy going out with friends on friday nights and, I don’t know, a good cup of tea.” Apparently seeing the futility of such stilted conversation, John switched tactics. “Why did you quit your job so many times?”
Moriarty laughed at the implied distress in both their gazes. “Charming, the two of you. But remember, it's this or death.” The laugh seemed to awaken something in Sherlock, because he blinked.
“A series of murders. The most recent had a slit in its left cheek perfect for taking blood discreetly once the victim is dead. But why is that necessary? It wasn’t so they’d know to hide the body. The body wasn’t hidden. So why did the murderer need to draw blood before the police found the body, and why did they have to hide their intentions? I have to check if the other bodies match.”
The two startled alphas dropped their hold on the man. He was clearly injured, and why he needed to be forced into the building for his own health was beyond John.
His boss leaned forward, to brace his elbow on the desk. “If you can’t stop antagonizing your coworkers, I will have to--”
Both men were silent as John paid, and they waited for their orders. They arrived quickly, because both men had ordered simple drinks.
He was sorting files in a cabinet on the far wall when the door opened. He was slightly embarrassed that his back was turned, and the newcomers could see the Mate Mark on the back of his neck. But he had been the one who hadn’t worn a turtleneck that day, so it was his own fault.
Hesitantly, John removed his hands. They had formed a death grip on Sherlock’s neck, and sometime in the process, their foreheads had met. Finally able to process the grey eyes boring into his own, John took a deep breath.
It was a normal looking building. It was in a neighborhood of Alphas, but then, his last place had been too.
John’s smile widened. He turned to the officer. Hilariously, the man looked gobsmacked. Lestrade ignored him, and took out his own phone.
John worried his bottom lip, and slipped a hand to the back of his neck. “I umm. Well, I might be his soulmate. But don’t tell him I said that. He doesn’t seem very open to the idea.”
The space was remarkably lived-in for having been inhabited for just a week. It was far more spacious than the last space the man had had, and it seemed comfy. Although, there was a skull on the mantle.
“Stop.” John put in. “If I have to die, just do it.” He raised his chin. He’d faced death before. He could do it again. For Sherlock. “I’m ready.”
“John do you know how many times I quit my job?” John stared at him. Sherlock didn’t wait for him to guess.  “Four. Do you know how many times I’ve been rehired?”
“It's not without some sacrifice on my part, I assure you.” Sherlock had replied, arrogant even then.
John was not supposed to be working in the Omega hospital. He was an Alpha, and generally administered only to them. However, the Omega wing was desperately low on staff, and he’d been volunteered for the front desk.
“Number three. This is the most important one.” What could possibly be more important than a death threat? John asked himself. “Never EVER use compulsion on me.”
Compulsions, put simply, were orders from an Alpha that an Omega was physically incapable of resisting. They were generally associated with bonded mates, because any and every order from the Alpha of a bonded pair was a compulsion. However, in scenarios in which someone’s life is in jeopardy, Alphas could use compulsions on Omegas regardless of mating. Scientists believed this was developed as a survival mechanism to protect the Omegas. This could, obviously, be a load of dung. Fields of study were dominated by Alphas, as Omegas were seen as unfit for such jobs. It was just another way Omegas had less power.
He met John who was just getting to the top of the stairs. Sherlock inclined his head a bit at the man, but was moving much too fast for any sort of exchange. Sherlock swept down the hall, assuming John would follow. He did, although with louder footsteps than were necessary.
“Put your hands up, and walk back the way you came.” His voice came out higher than he would have liked, but it was authoritative. Their hands flew to their heads. Neither backed away.
Moriarty cackled. “How sweet. But it doesn’t matter Sherl. John gets to choose.” John tensed his jaw. He recognized what this man was doing. He was taking every bit of control from Sherlock that he could. John would have thwarted this in any way he could, if it didn’t mean Sherlock’s death.
“You don’t. But you currently have snipers aimed at your heart. You are not in a position to negotiate.”
John’s gaze almost missed him. Sherlock was sitting in a black chair, with his eyes closed. He appeared to be meditating. Without opening his eyes, he spoke. “It can't be the mailman, she’s too short. Stop her inquiries.”
“You have family issues, many of them concerning your gender.” John frowned. “He wouldn’t give details. Talked about your intelligence. You hate the world. But you never take it out on the people around you. Never go all criminal mastermind. You take it out on yourself. You’ve knocked yourself up on drugs pretty bad a couple times.”
“Anderson has reported that you were acting less than friendly towards him today.” He gave Sherlock a long look. “I told you to try and get along with him.”
“O. Oxygen’s abbreviation on the periodic table of the elements. My table. Jim. Cafe with a bad pun. Gotta go Lestrade. I wish you good solving.”
Sherlock’s gaze was fixed on the darkness where Moriarty stood, and both his hands were clutching his blue scarf. John narrowed his eyes.

"Jesus," John whispered, moving his fingers to cover his mouth. He'd seen people shot too many times before not to recognize the way the man's body had jolted. The camera backed up, swinging to face a brick wall for a moment before peeking around it again, tilted at a bad angle. A tall dark-haired man sharply dressed in a purple button-down shirt strode confidently toward the unmoving, laid-out body. There was a gun in his hand, held at his side. John set his jaw, readying himself for the inevitable. The assailant lifted the boy's backpack with one hand, his expression calculating as he shoved a finger through the hole in the strap his bullet had made. Blood seeped out from beneath the lad's body and ran along a crack in the blacktop toward the thin man's shoes. He stepped back carefully and shot the boy through his skull.
Sherlock flopped down on Sebastian Moran’s hotel bed, sure the man would not return, now. Due to John Watson.

"You weren't supposed to be like this," Sherlock stated, frowning down at Gladstone as if the lead dog held the answers. "What did I miss?" he muttered.

John stepped inside, knowing he'd rather submit than get caught in a ridiculous power play with the elder Holmes.
In May the mice began to rustle more loudly in the moss insulation around the walls and Sherlock shouted and rubbed at his ears to drown them out. The geese sounded constantly on the river, heard all the way into their home. Sherlock started to try to sneak up on John and startle him, day and night, trying to chase his own boredom away. Still, he never managed, and John got to watch the admiration grow in his eyes with every failed attempt. He taught Sherlock how to hunt for otters, how they only came up from a spot once, and catch the beavers who'd circle back to the same place and were easier to catch.
Mike pulled the blowtorch's trigger, letting out a burst of blue flame. He nodded and cut the flame off, working a nail out of his pocket.

"Iraq?" Mr. Holmes tried again and John became aware too late that the man was trying to get him to talk. Right.
"What? Have I stepped in it then?" she asked, looking distraught, and John blushed. Sherlock looked at him, his own cheeks pink and Mycroft smirked again.

Sherlock wasn’t about to shake John loose, not when his closeness did something funny to his chest and stomach. Something not altogether unpleasant. He was glad for the help once they got to the stairs. Sherlock got dizzy about halfway up and had to stop for a moment before continuing on. John’s steady presence remained by his side all the way into the flat.
John groaned, head falling back and eyes glaring at the ceiling. “Hardly. Every eye will be on you, like it always is. Men
Sherlock’s verbal clumsiness rocked John back on his heels. The few times he had heard him so at a loss for words had always been the result of careful staging and manipulation by the detective, designed to mislead and obfuscate. This time, he had no doubt as to the sincerity of Sherlock’s lack of eloquence. Suddenly, he was filled with self-loathing. It wasn’t right for Sherlock to have that sense of shame and guilt hovering over him. It was
John shrugged, suddenly reluctant to give away how eager he had been to finally see Sherlock again face to face.
Sherlock and John were most decidedly a couple, but they most decidedly did not call each other pet names. Sweetheart, darling, honey,
are. Sherlock Holmes, coming home from the shops with actual bags of food? Never thought I’d see the day.”
Marjorie blinked, her mask still firmly in place.  “Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective? The one who lives on Baker Street in London?”
“Brilliant,” he whispered, eyes shining with fascination. “An antique Erard grand piano. Our parents owned one, it’s what Mycroft practiced on. Only ours wasn’t made of oak.”
“I see.” John pulled himself a beer out of the fridge, popped it open, and took two large swallows. He walked back into the sitting room, letting loose a loud burp as he did so. Sherlock grimaced at his antics.
Polite, restrained applause greeted her as she took her seat. After laying her hands on the keys, she glanced up and pinned her audience with a penetrating gaze. Her wide blue eyes shimmered with some nameless emotion before they dropped to her hands and her focus narrowed onto her performance, and her performance alone.
He was so exhausted by the morning of, he felt like he had just endured six months of wedding planning. It didn't help that he had stayed up half the night writing a speech for the birthday boy. He wasn't sure what had possessed him to do that, but he had felt some sort of compulsion that he didn't understand. He had even called Graham in a panic, who hadn't been at all helpful. In fact, he had seemed confused.
“Of course I do. Mrs Hudson wouldn’t leave for the holidays without making sure 221b was properly festive, now would she?”
"Right," John said, giving Sherlock a bemused look. He ripped the paper off his package, and flipped open the box. And was stunned into sober silence.
“I can’t… I’m sorry, Sherlock. I realise from my history you were expecting a different kind of reaction, but -- I don’t do casual sex. Not anymore. Not since… well. Since before Mary, to be honest. Kissing and touching is one thing, but  -- unless the sex
John detested pet names with every fibre of his being. Whenever any of his girfriends used one, he inwardly cringed whilst trying not to outwardly react. It was difficult at times, though. Sarah never did call him anything other than his name, thank goodness. Jeannette, on the other hand, insisted on calling him every endearment in the book, it seemed. Thank mercy for small favours, Mary had very rarely done so; the occasional
He had two months in which to prepare. Sherlock put his whole heart and soul into it. He put aside his discomfort, and did what had to be done. He had never been so focussed in his life, not even while he was bringing down Moriarty's network.
The inside joke of the smiley-face ignited a warm glow in Sherlock’s chest, and the clever appropriateness of the skull and crossbones made him grin like a lunatic. Then the actual words hit home, and jolted him like a bucket of ice water.
After a period that could have been only minutes, or could have lasted several hours, the spotlight faded until all that could be seen was inky blackness. Stunned silence filled the room, until abruptly the overhead lights pierced the darkness.
secret sister with an even more ridiculous name. Then again, given this family nothing surprises me anymore.”
He believes me to be married to my work. I can’t fault him for that deduction. For many years I gave him no cause to believe otherwise. Sentiment, after all, is a chemical defect found on the losing side. I still believe it to be mostly  true. Mostly.
“Wait. Sherlock. Are you sure we can’t just… pretend the last few days never happened? Blank slate, post-quarantine. Just carry on like before. No expectations, like we agreed. Yeah?” John’s heart thudded in his chest as he waited for a reply.
His eyes flicked over the sitting room. Everything looked familiar, and yet somehow not quite the same as he remembered. The yellow smiley-face was on the wall, but the bullet holes were slightly off. The decor was essentially the same, with evidence of a small child scattered here and there. Books and toys lay scattered hither and yon. Some pictures that he didn’t recognise now graced the mantel, so Sherlock took tentative steps forward to get a closer look.
He startled back to awareness at the sound of John snapping his fingers next to Sherlock’s ear. “Earth to Sherlock. Come in, Sherlock. Okay. This is getting a bit scary now.”
They were in the middle of eating their very delicious cake when Sherlock pointed his fork at John and declared, "The day we met."
"Oh, Sherlock. I had to make sure you were worthy. Without a little competition, would you have really put in so much effort? I've found that most men need to be prodded a little, give them the thrill of a chase. Don't you agree?"
And it always came down to that, didn’t it? The fact that he left. That he stayed away for two years with nary a word to the man who was supposedly his best friend. Graham and Mrs Hudson both had been happy to see him, but John Watson? John had punched him -- not once, but three times. Sherlock sighed. He should have known. It always came down to this.
“Give me one good reason why I should tell you that.” Icy fury laced Mycroft’s tone. John didn’t blame him for being angry, not one bit. He replied with the only answer he could, the only honest thing he could say that might go even a little way toward thawing Mycroft’s rage.
“No problem,” Sherlock agreed, turning back to the item of interest under his microscope. John gave his shoulder an affectionate squeeze before making his way out of the kitchen in search of his keys.
Sherlock’s eye was then drawn to a framed picture sitting on top of the chest of drawers. He slowly walked towards it, cocking his head. The white plastic frame contained a photo of John holding a swaddled infant, and at his side was a petite blonde woman whose smile was as wide as John’s. The birth mother? Unusual, if Sherlock and John had adopted Rosie. Perhaps a surrogate? That made more sense, given that Sherlock had deduced Rosie was John’s biological child. But if that were the case, why was Sherlock not included in the picture?
“And you left first. What else was he supposed to do, but get on with his life? The ball’s in your court now, young man.”
She was not fussing, throwing a tantrum, or otherwise acting unhappy, so John didn’t have the heart to tell her that enough was enough. She was just a little girl, enjoying time with her daddy, whom she hadn’t seen all day.
Even Mrs Turner’s married ones, David and Patrick, had edged their way into the inner circle. Rosie had them wrapped around her little finger, even more so when she started calling them her cousins. Where she got that from, remained a mystery for years to come.
In the past, Sherlock had never had to put much effort into getting rid of John’s girlfriends. Really, he didn't even have to try. All he had to do was be himself, and sooner rather than later, they were gone. Sarah had lasted the longest, but that relationship had never progressed to the point of sharing a bed. After six weeks, she had broken things off.
Frowning, John replied, “Uh, Redbeard, but he wasn’t actually - Sherlock, are you sure you’re okay? Periodic memory lapses aren’t uncommon with head injuries, do you need to - “
John looked up from his writings when the breadsticks and wine arrived. Now that he got a proper look at the rest of the room, his eyes narrowed.
He stared out the window at the scenery passing by in a blur and wondered, not for the first time, if this was a very bad idea. Rolling green hills and sparkling blue waters rushed by in a steady stream of beauty, but he saw none of it. His mind was on his destination, hundreds of miles and another country away. There were dozens of ways this could go horribly wrong; he was sure he had already lived through most of them in his head. But he had never been a coward --
When he and Sherlock became a couple, John had no worries whatsoever about Sherlock embarrassing him in public with terms of endearment. Or even in private, for that matter. And John was A-OK with that. More than.
Sherlock shrugged. “If you like. Finding out what works, through trial and error. If it doesn’t relax you, then we can stop doing it.”
Sherlock grinned. “Unfortunately for you, yes. Fortunately for me, because I get to have an armful of eye candy by my side the entire time.” He winked.
“There was no one after you, Dr Watson. Not for any of it. A handful of friends, perhaps. But never anything the likes of what he shared with you.”
He had just finished a double shift, and as soon as he walked in the door Sherlock had thrust Rosie into his arms, exclaiming  “A case, John!” before bounding down the stairs into the night. He went through the whole bedtime routine, hoping afterwards to finally get some hot food into his belly, and maybe even a cold brew.
felt those things about Sherlock, and that those feelings were stronger than whatever he felt for Mary Morstan. Oh, and that whatever Mary felt for John paled in comparison to what Sherlock felt for him.
All well and good, Sherlock thought. If this was Mary’s attitude towards celebrating a romantic holiday with her boyfriend, then Sherlock’s plans were sure to overshadow any of hers. “Quiet evening at home”, how ridiculous. John thrived on the unexpected. How could she not know this?
“Mycroft Holmes, yes.” He snorted. “Our parents were fond of ridiculous names. I won’t even go into the absurdity of our sister’s name.”
John sighed. “Yes. Yes it does. Look, Mrs Hudson has a large freezer, we’ll use that. Also, I need some air, I’m going for a run.”
There was a silence lasting three beats. “Presents? A tree? Who are you, and what have you done with Sherlock Holmes? Do you have fairy lights and tinsel as well?”
This one is -- a little different, I guess? Takes place during ASiB, right after Sherlock's visit to the morgue on Christmas Eve. Pre-Sherlock/John.
Five minutes later the two flatmates were sitting on opposite ends of the sofa, their respective beverages in hand. Two hours later, their shoulders were touching as they slouched down with their legs spread out on the coffee table. Sherlock nudged John’s left foot with his right. John pressed his elbow lightly into Sherlock’s side. They cracked a smile at each other, before devolving into snickers at the ridiculousness on-screen.
to feel about him. Before Sherlock had jumped from a roof and fucked off for two years. Now, somehow, he just had to convince John that he
Sherlock swallowed. He glanced down at John’s hand on his knee. The gold band that was still there sparkled in the sunlight coming through the car window.
Sherlock turned his back on them and made his way to the kitchen to pour the champagne. He scowled at the waiting glasses.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The doorman gave one to me. And the kitchen shuts down at 10:30, there’s not enough time.”
Well, not like Sherlock anyway. John had always been a romantic, whether or not he was willing to admit it.
Nothing was mentioned of their unspoken rivalry, not even when they were alone in the room together. Which happened more often than he had expected, to be honest. He was surprised at how much he enjoyed Mary’s company… how much he appreciated her quick wit and scary intellect. She wasn’t quite as sharp as Irene, or himself (obviously!), but she certainly wasn’t boring.
“I don’t know anybody besides you and John who aren’t as dull as neglected kitchen knives,” she complained at Sherlock, who was busy with an experiment at the dinner table. She sat across from him, a cold case file open in front of her which she was ostensibly supposed to be studying for anything Sherlock might have missed.
Interestingly, every other attendant was dressed in mid-nineteenth century garb, as if they were attending a themed fancy dress party. Sherlock and John exchanged a glance before giving each other the once-over. They were both dressed in basic black trousers and jacket, black bow-tie, and white shirt. They shrugged, hoping their attire was generic enough to fit in. They hadn’t been stopped at the door, so that was a good indication that all was well.
Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes in the Victorian era? With the same careers as their modern counterparts? And a sister with just as much talent, just focussed differently?”
“That was the most exquisite performance I have ever experienced. You have a bright future ahead of you, Ms Holmes.”
“Was a concert held here last night?” Sherlock interrupted brusquely. “A solo piano performance, given by a young lady at 8 pm?”
He is a flawed man, of course. Aren’t we all? That has never stopped me from wanting to be by is side every step of the way. Even when he would rather that I keep my distance. I have a lot to atone for; I am grateful that he allows me in at all. That he more than tolerates me is a gift that I will not take for granted.
Sherlock was doing something on his phone, but he looked up when John said his name. “I had called in reinforcements for the snipers. I think Lestrade himself coordinated that. That left Jim as the only threat. So I took him out.”
Clarence, his landlord, lived upstairs. Generally, Sherlock would just leave an envelope of cash in his mailbox, but he knew the alpha wouldn’t take well to being given notice by mail. With a sigh, Sherlock climbed the stairs, and knocked on the door down the short hallway. It smelled of alcohol and wallpaper, but Sherlock was almost noseblind to the scent after having inhabited the flat downstairs for five months.
“Mhmm. He said the truth might spark a reaction from you.” Sherlock huffed. Before he could reply, John spoke again. “I am not going to be a messenger. Any conversation you want to have with him can occur without my services as a middle man.”
There were only two doors in the hallway beyond. Sherlock tried them both. They were locked. Undaunted, Sherlock reached into his coat pocket. Dangit. Where were his lockpicks?
Moriarty laughed. “Sherlock. Tsk tsk. You think I don’t remember what you’re like? You didn’t call the police. You came with your little mate, and thought it would work out. Well I’m veeery sorry to disappoint you, but I’m afraid this time you’ve been beat.” Laser sights appeared on Sherlock’s chest. Looking down, John saw the same lights on his own shirt.
Her eyes lit up, and she stepped out of the way. “Up the stairs, don’t bother knocking. I’ll go make tea!” She directed him, as she hurried off.
“Tobacco ash. She’s kept her hands very clean of it all, but she hasn’t managed to keep it off her sleeves. It's low-tar, so she could be trying to take care of her health, but more likely her Alpha is opposed to the drawbacks of such a habit. “
He was mildly surprised when they did indeed pull into an Omega hospital drop off. He was far less surprised when the Alphas thought it necessary to ‘escort’ him into the building.
Sherlock looks up from his phone just long enough to roll his eyes. “Over my dead body. Get me a new case, and I
“As if I can’t see your hand when you pull strings. You’re not as subtle as you think you are, My.” His brother chuckled.
Yet Sherlock could find nothing- no twitches, or out of place breaths- to suggest he was anything but perfectly at home. Unbidden, the coffee conversation welled up in his mind. Before the topic had shifted to Mycroft, John had seemed perfectly at ease. He hadn’t so much as blinked while giving the  sugar speech.
Not breaking eye contact (really, the lengths some people will go to assert dominance), Clarence reached for the envelope.
Sherlock didn’t give a rat’s tail for what people thought of him, but much as he was loath to admit it, he had his safety to look after. Alphas could be… aggressive towards an unmatched Omega.
It was this power he called on now. His arm shuddered as he fought to shove the compulsion off. It was a mental battle. Thankfully, that was his home turf. After an internal struggle, he felt the pressure of the desire remove itself from his mind. He breathed a sigh of relief, and steadied his arm. His gun was still pointed at the two women.
“Sherlock,” John said as calmly as he could “compulsions are not something that we have control over. They just happen.” He took his key out of his pocket, and shut his office door.
“I still don’t think whatever random kid you met in middle school is the murderer. You’re drawing conclusions with no proof.” John had reluctantly followed Sherlock to the cafe he was bent on investigating. The place was abandoned, and everything was dusty. He had sneezed twice already, hence the grumbling.
The rest of the ride was wethered in silence. It was not much longer until they arrived. Sherlock left the bill for John to pay, and raced into the building.
“The way you are sipping it suggests you don’t care much for its taste. So why did you order it? Presumably to fly under the radar with something inconspicuous. But everything else about you is not manufactured to blend in. So, it must be subconscious. You deliberately work against the need to be out of the way, small. Words generally connected to Omegas. Conclusion? You don’t want a relationship because you are afraid of submitting to these stereotypes.”
“Right.” John muttered, turning to look out the window. Sherlock smiled a bit. “I still don’t know why we couldn’t just go out for coffee.” John grumbled, as they passed a cafe.
To compound upon the problem, Miss Scott did not remove him from the table the entire year. It was a bit like she was matchmaking. They weren’t a couple, in fact they didn’t talk to each other once until two months in.
“It has been confirmed that the Omega in question is Sherlock Holmes, former detective Inspector to Scotland Yard. If you have no further information, you are free to return home.”
John closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. This was what the bond was for. Protecting his mate. “Sherlock.” he said quietly. “Pick up the gun.
Sherlock’s foot assaulted the floor in a rhythmic, belligerent fashion. It was 2:58, and he needed to get to the morgue to reexamine the bodies, but he had told John to meet him at his flat at three.
He took a step closer. He nodded, knowing he couldn’t really say anything meaningful before this started. Reaching up, he placed both hands on the back of Sherlock’s neck, covering his name.
“Boys, settle down.” Miss Scott had interrupted with a twitch of her lips. They’d been friends all that year. Sherlock hadn’t kept track of Jim when they left for different high schools.
Her voice came out strangely. Her accent still existed, but it was as if someone had underlined it heavily. There was an undertone of something else, like her voice had developed the remarkable ability of cutting through flesh.
Jones sighed. “I quote “‘Shut up Anderson, you’ll lower the IQ of the entire street.’ That’s you speaking, in case you’d forgotten.” Sherlock smirked. He really felt no remorse for that.
It was the new kid’s first day. Not that Sherlock had really noticed. He had taken the ten seconds it took to deduce him, and had then turned back to his book.
He finally understood how couples could die if the bond wasn’t completed. He was draining Sherlock’s lifeforce, and it was too much for his body to handle alone. He was being roasted like a slightly gooey marshmallow.
Jim’s attention snapped to him. Moriarty’s eyebrows shot up in an exaggerated look of shock. He put a hand over his heart. “Why John!” he exclaimed. “You aren’t going to put Sherlock in danger are you? Take one step further, and I assure you, that I’ll add another tally to my list of kills.” John froze.
“Three-hundred types of tobacco ash, hmm?” John looked amused, but Sherlock caught the awe behind it.
He always kept a gun on him, and he took it out now. Desperate times called for desperate means. He pointed it at the couple.
John turned to Mrs.Hudson. He was sure utter confusion was evident on his face. The landlady came over and patted him on the arm. “Don’t worry dear. He’s always like that.”
John felt the same, just more...whole. It was like he’d unlocked a whole nother level of access to himself. He felt Sherlock like the limb he’d never had.
“Point the gun at me.” John’s voice did not tremble, but it lost even more volume. He was now staring down the barrel of the gun.
Few did, even among his sex. It was nearly impossible for an Omega to be anything but a housewife or a janitor.
Lestrade sighed. “He can resist them. Has been able to for years, although he prefers to keep it quiet.”
John was detained long after he should have gone home for the day, but he was eventually let go. The hospital ‘failing to treat a patient’ was seen as not his fault, and the issue was dropped.
Sherlock’s eyebrows climbed with each sentence until he finished with narrowed eyes.  “That's a rather long way to jump.” His voice was a sheet of ice.
John’s eyes flicked to his mate. Sherlock’s eyes were squeezed shut, his scarf’s knot coming undone as he tugged at it in stress.
The two Alphas from earlier sat on each side of him. The youngest, seeing his open eyes, said “We're taking you to the hospital. Try to take deep breaths.”
It was strange how at home John looked in Sherlock’s apartment. Sherlock had his eyes trained on his mate. The man was sitting on a chair not far from him, reading a magazine. It didn’t make sense for him to be so casual.
“Have you solved your case yet?” It was a clear ploy to change the subject, but Sherlock let it slide.
“You two are going to take the bond.” Moriarty, walks casually forward, and as his face comes into the light, John does a double take. He looks like your average British man. And yet, something's off about him. Maybe it's the way his eyes are opened a bit too wide, or the way they glint with a manic light. This was not the face of a sane man.
“You know where to find me.” Sherlock reminded him, as he headed for the door. His hand paused above the handle. “Actually, I’ve been thinking of moving out of my flat.” He shook his phone in the air, reminding Lestrade to reach out, and then he exited the building.
“The universe wants you to get to know your soulmate.” Mycroft hung up. Sherlock chucked the offending device across the room. It bounced off the couch and onto the floor.
He recovered far too quickly, and caught Sherlock’s free arm. He pinned it, too, out of the way, trying to still Sherlock’s struggles with a rock hard grip.
John’s hand shot to the back of his neck where the name Sherlock was inked. Could this man be his soulmate? Had he seen John’s Mate Mark in the hospital? Is that how he’d known John’s name? Where was Sherlock now? These questions and more, flooded his mind with the introduction of the man’s name. The officer interrupted his rapid-fire thoughts.
“Here’s the month’s rent. I’m moving out.” Sherlock held out an envelope. Clarence didn’t take it. Sherlock shook the paper a bit, wondering if his landlord was as daft as he seemed.
His boss had the large office at the end of the hall, so Sherlock popped into his joint workspace before clearing out.
“So.” John began, sliding into a table, and handing Sherlock his cup. Sherlock took the seat opposite and raised his eyebrows when the Alpha did not finish the thought. “Um, what do you enjoy?”
This was a common speech. ‘Act like a complacent Omega, or I’ll fire you.’ Sherlock was sick of it. Anderson had had it coming. Sherlock was routinely dumped on useless cases, far below his abilities, and his coworker loved reminding him of this fact.
In three hours, Sherlock was all packed. He’d had to abandon two experiments that required refrigeration. That was unfortunate. However, beyond his chemistry set and other devices, Sherlock had surprisingly few worldly possessions.
Both men were now distinctly uncomfortable with the conversation. Sherlock was stock still, and his eyes were boring into John. He was squirming under the gaze. Still he powered on.
Confoundingly, Molly wasn’t in the morgue either.  Sherlock paused for a second, then cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted “Molly!”
The energy was going so fast, it seemed to solidify. Then, it settled. Dissipated. John felt their mingled energies sink into a latent stillness, and a cool wave washed over him.
“Scotland yard was bent on giving me boring cases and daft co-workers. This one is interesting, and they are undoubtedly lost.”
“Don’t give me that. You don’t see Alphas and Omegas as equals. You will repress these prejudices when with me.”
The patient who had just entered was lean with a mop of handsome dark curls. He was held on both sides by an Alpha at the arm. The Omega was taller than both of them, and seemed to be having a battle with himself. His face was shifting emotions at a hundred mile an hour.
“No, but we are not treating it as a missing persons case. He has just moved out. If you have no further questions? Alright. Thank you for your time.”
Hanging up his coat at five o’clock, his phone began to ring. He picked up. “Hello. This is John Watson.”
Why had he done that? He shouldn't have done that. Sherlock glanced down at his leg. Recognizing his own agitation, he got up to check if his acid was still boiling. It was.
“I said there’s no need.” He stood, and covered the distance to the door in swift purposeful strides. “I quit.” Sherlock did not wait for a response as he left the office.
John worked overtime the next day, trying to focus on something mundane to keep his head from exploding.
The Omega fled to the stairwell. Clarence caught up only enough to grab Sherlock’s arm. It threw him off kilter, and he tumbled down the stairs.
After some digging, John unearthed a blog by one Sherlock Holmes. The claims he made seemed far fetched, but it listed Sherlock's new place of residence: 221B Baker Street.
Pain shot up and down his limbs. If Sherlock had not had a history with drugs, he would have been far more unsteady getting up. As it was, his legs protested at the top of their lungs. Fumbling with his pants, Sherlock stumbled down the hall and out onto the streets where he collapsed, breathing heavily.
“You’re right. The problem isn’t me. It's my colleagues who won’t give me access to the dead bodies I need.”
The place itself had a nondescript black door, with an equally average knocker. John stood there, staring at the knocker for several minutes. Then, telling himself to stop dawdling, he let it fall twice.
“I observed, John. People don’t know how to use their eyes. For example, the Omega with the bald man over there? She has recently resumed her smoking habit, but her mate doesn’t know.”
“Have a seat Mr. Holmes.” His boss was a surly man by the name of Jones. He had never found his mate, and Sherlock had not gotten on his good side when he had pointed this out the first time they met. Sherlock sat.
“And you want to-- No. I am not letting you do that. Your brains are not getting blown to bits. Not on my watch.” John raised his chin as he said it, willing Sherlock to defy him.
