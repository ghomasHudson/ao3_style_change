The first time he’d felt Tony inside of him, he thought he was going to combust. No state of the art dildo could have prepared him for the experience of sex with an actual person. Tony had figured out Steve was incredibly sensitive pretty much from the get go and mercilessly took advantage of that knowledge to drive Steve to incoherence.
Resigning himself to the fact that he wouldn’t be falling back asleep after this, Tony stared up at the ceiling while wondering how this was his life. He was, without a doubt, well and truly fucked.
He watched as Steve cried out and came all over himself. His vitals indicated that he was still fine, but Tony was really starting to wonder. Especially as Steve kept coming, like he was going through two or three orgasms all in one go. Whatever those pheromones were, they were strong to be able to affect someone like Steve to this extent.
The soothing touch of Tony’s hand on his thigh helped to ground him. “Just a bit of the technology I explained to you,” he heard Tony say softly. “Like I said: kind of like a dildo, but much, much better. And don’t worry, I made sure the diameter of this one was enough to make you have to work for it, but nothing close to anything that’d hurt you.”
“Shit,” he said before stopping. “It’s a sample we got from a HYDRA lab a few weeks ago. Couldn’t tell what it was, and Bruce was working on studying it. Camera footage shows that something broke out, but the angle is obscured.”
Tony takes pity on him and holds in his laugh. “I feel a hell of a lot better. So you know what? Your crazy plan worked.”
Steve did as he was told, knowing already what was going to happen. Though he wasn’t surprised when Tony grabbed the hem of his loose sweatpants and pulled them down along with his boxers, he still couldn’t help the gasp of relief as his cock sprung free and slapped against his stomach. He’d been leaking a fair amount of precome before; he was surprised it hadn’t shown through his sweatpants yet. But now it was there plain to see, and Steve could feel his blush spreading down to his neck. Out here in Tony’s workshop like this, as opposed to the bedroom, he felt like a specimen on display.
“Huh…” Did Tony have any plans for today? He couldn’t even remember what day it was. “What day is it, anyway?”
“Tony,” he said as he smiled as he shook Steve’s hand from his awkward position. “So… you don’t have any plans for today anymore?”
Figures that on today, of all days, Tony runs into this mystery Adonis. Well, at least he has something for the spank bank when he gets home. Every cloud has a silver lining, and all that.
Tony squinted at the black and white images that were now floating in the air in front of him. To be honest, he wasn’t entirely sure of what he was looking at. He was being irrational, he knew, but he couldn’t stop worrying about Steve.
“Coming right up,” Tony assured him with a pat to his arm before he dashed off to the mini fridge that he kept stocked in the workshop.
Steve resists the urge to groan because the memory of yesterday evening is fresh in his mind. The base of his cock throbs at the thought of that perfect omega heat around him. So far, the only thing that’s stopped him from jerking off to memories of fucking Mr. Stark is the accompanying guilt.
“Yeah, sure. Why not?” He glances around the apartment. “But if you don’t mind, I’d rather we go back to my place. If you are interested.”
“Well, doc? What’s the diagnosis?” Steve couldn’t help asking, feeling the corner of his mouth twitch up a bit. Might as well find the humor in this situation and run with it. That’s how he’d kept his sanity over the past day and a half, anyway.
Tony glanced down at his slightly rumpled suit and pants. He could go back to his hotel, but he had a feeling that his 5-star luxury suite overlooking Shibuya would give him away.
He reached down to grasp both thighs and pulled back, baring his ass cheeks and giving the creature better access.
Steve couldn’t help it, his back arched again as he sought out Tony’s heat on his cock. They groaned in unison when the head of Steve’s cock finally pushed through the tight ring of muscle. Even after all of his preparation, Tony was so wet and
Tony thinks back to how good it had felt to be connected to Steve, his knot tying them together as he’d continued to come inside of him—okay, he is
“Ten out of ten, would let you put nanotech in my ass again.” Steve opened one eye and turned his head to look up at Tony. “How’s that for feedback?”
“It’s not about blame. It’s about proper lab safety procedure,” Tony kept on going on as he started pacing again, almost talking more to himself than to Steve. “I’ve been working on properly sealing the Mark 44 for the past three days…”
Tony wakes up with a gasp as his helmet is removed. For a second, he can’t remember where he is and flails out an arm in panic.
Tony raises a skeptical eyebrow. Does this guy really not know who he is? Judging by the man’s wide-eyed expression, he really doesn’t. “Yes, I work here.” Now that Tony thinks about it, though… “Have I seen you before?”
Tony nods. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He looks over to the fire burning in the hearth. It hits him that he’s completely naked, though considering what’s already happened it’s ridiculous to feel self-conscious now. His gaze darts back to Steve and he gestures at the floor. “Who told you to sleep on the floor?”
Steve glanced around the workshop, feeling uncertain. It wasn’t like quickly undressing in front of Tony was something he hadn’t done before. In the space of the workshop, though, he felt… exposed, somehow.
drunk. The last time he’d been this drunk, he was pretty sure he had been drinking out of a red plastic cup with Rhodey giving him disapproving looks from the other end of the frat house’s ratty couch.
“Can’t predict everything,” Steve said with a shrug. It wasn’t like he was angry about the whole situation.
The man shrugged. “Dunno. Got a key from the lady at the front, but lost it when I was puking my brains out ‘n stuff in the bathroom.”
The creature pulled away from his face and raised its body into the air as it twitched its antennae. Steve wasn’t sure what was going on until something warm splashed against his lips. That was when he realized that it seemed to be secreting some liquid from what he assumed was its mouth. The creature’s head hovered back and forth, a few inches from his face, as the liquid continued to flow out slowly. It was then that Steve realized what the creature was trying to do. He moved his hand away from his cock and reached up toward it. Now that it was so close, Steve could smell the creature’s secretions, and they smelled delightful. Bringing the creature’s head close, he strained to reach it with his tongue. The first taste was even better than the smell. It was the best thing Steve had ever tasted in his life. He pulled the creature’s head closer to give himself better access. Seemingly in response, it started secreting more liquid, which Steve happily lapped up. He groaned as he continued to enjoy the taste.
Tony hummed against the skin between Steve’s shoulder blades. “One of these days I’m going to figure out how to crack that supersoldier libido of yours.”
He glanced back at the workshop’s entrance to make sure they were alone before asking, “So how’s that mystery project coming along?”
“Mmm, yeah. That sounds about right.” Steve moved to roll them over again and slid his hands down along Tony’s torso to do just that. The startled moan that move elicited from Tony was music to Steve’s ears.
“Well, I was going to solicit your feedback on that new polymer we’ve been working on for a prototype that the big guy won’t just tear to pieces, but I think that can wait…?”
“Something like that…” Steve could feel his face heating up. “Hope the hangover hasn’t hit you too hard.”
Smiling back, Steve did an awkward bow and mumbled an ‘arigatou’ before heading to the elevators. Just his luck, though, there was only one elevator and it was at what seemed to be the top floor of this tall building. Steve wasn’t usually impatient, but he wanted to just lie down and rest his tired feet. His room was only on the third floor, and he figured it’d be faster to take the stairs at this rate.
Steve could feel his face heating up. Tony’s dirty talk was downright dangerous. “Um… all of it? You’re kind of putting me on the spot, here.”
The man glanced down at his watch. “I was hoping I’d wake up earlier than you, but I must’ve been more tired than I thought.” He sat back with a sigh. “There goes my plans for the day.”
Steve hums and presses another kiss to the side of Tony’s neck, nibbling gently at the skin. “Let’s stay right here,” he says, “I want to show you something.”
Steve ignores him and adds a third finger, thrusting them slowly in and out of Tony as his other hand supports Tony’s back. He dips his head further to lave his tongue around one of Tony’s nipples, adding a hint of teeth as he licks the little bud to hardness before doing the same to the other side. Tony feels overwhelmed on sensation as he’s torn between rocking back on Steve’s fingers in his ass and Steve’s tongue on his chest. He reaches down to stroke his neglected cock, the touch taking a little bit of the edge off but he gasps when Steve’s fingers graze against the spot inside of him that starbursts his vision white. Everything is too much and not quite enough.
who kneels down in front of Tony and reaches out with shaking hands as though to touch before he hastily withdraws, remembering he no longer has that privilege when Tony flinches. Tony doesn’t pay any attention to that when there’s the low cautious hope burning in his chest that if
Somewhere along the way, Tony gathers enough brain function to tug insistently on Steve's sweater. Thankfully, he gets the hint and in seconds, miles and miles of glorious smooth skin is bared for Tony's eyes and fingers and lips.
“That's okay, I still love you,” Steve says, pulling him in for another kiss, and Tony freezes for a moment in his arms.
“Shut up, nerd,” Steve tells him, laughing slightly. Tony can feel the vibrations of his chuckles reverberate against the front of his chest.
“Yes I fucking do,” Tony snarls. He steels himself for the killing blow. “It was nice being fuck buddies with you, but it never meant anything.”
Bucky wolf whistles and claps. Steve purposefully splashes him as he dives into the pool in one fluid motion and Bucky laughs unrepentantly, cackling even as the water flies into his face.
now, and that’s a thought that will never not take Tony's breath away) perusing every colorful little shop they pass in hopes of finding the perfect gifts for their (
Tony turns the corner to see Steve and Peggy standing in front of Steve's locker. Steve's arms are around her as she tilts her head up, and Tony watches with cold frozen veins as she stands on her tiptoes to press a kiss against the corner of Steve's mouth. He watches as Steve sighs and pulls her close, burying his face in the crook of her shoulder.
Tony is happy enough to watch them from the side of the pool, curled up with Natasha on a lounge chair. She's gently fingercombing his unruly hair as they sit together in comfortable silence, observing the impromptu game.
Tony would've found it severely annoying had he not been swept up in the excitement too. He attends all of Steve's practices, sometimes with Loki and Nat for company, but more often than not alone. It's getting far too cold to sit outside for long periods of time, but like hell Tony is going to miss any of the free shows.
he fucked up so badly. He cannot possibly hurt his two best friends like this, what the fuck is wrong with him? He needs to leave, as far away as possible. Maybe Canada? Russia? He hears Siberia is nice this time of year.
Jarvis finds Tony sitting listlessly in the kitchen the next morning. He takes one look at him and puts the kettle on for tea. Tony knows Jarvis must feel especially bad for him when he brings down the tin of leftover Christmas cookies he'd been hiding and sets them on a plate.
“That’s not my name,” Steve smirks, smoothing his hands over the line of Tony's waist, fingers curling around the hem of his shirt, questioning.
“Oof,” Steve grunts now as his arms come up to wrap around Tony’s waist, pulling him snugly against his broad chest. “Guess so,” Steve replies, and Tony can hear the smile in his voice. It makes him feel strangely warm, despite trying as hard as he can to ignore that.
Sorry about the delay on this chapter. It's been a hectic week, but we should be back to a weekly schedule now. I'm the only one writing and editing this, and all of that takes time. Thank you all for your patience, and thank you all so much for the terrific response to this fic so far!
Tony heaves a deep breath. “Only one way to find out,” he says with more bravado than he feels. He curls his fingers around the reactor and pulls.
Tony feels like he wants to cry, and stronger yet is the urge to fall at Pepper’s feet and beg for forgiveness for his stupidity. He doesn't know what to say, can't even begin to form the words to beg, and her expression softens as she holds out her arms. He falls gratefully into her embrace, thinks he might be close to sobbing as she strokes gentle hands down his back.
going to deal with this. He figures maybe he can call Rhodey now and cry and start heading for Boston. He's not running away. He's not! He's just going to see Rhodey. Yep. Rhodey, his bestest friend in all the world.
Distantly he hears the music start, a slow song both he and Steve love but at the moment, Tony can’t remember what the name of it is for the life of him. He takes a deep steadying breath and blinks away the tears gathered at the corner of his eyes, his blurry vision catching the end of the surreptitious swipe of Steve’s hand across his face. Beside him, Rhodey touches Tony’s elbow and they begin the journey down the long aisle towards Steve at the arch.
Tony cannot deny he's enjoying every second of this, relishes in the attention, and heat simmers beneath his skin with every graze and touch of Steve's fingers. He wonders if it would feel any better if this is real, and as soon as the unwelcome thought comes, he pushes it quickly away. He's determined to enjoy this as long as he has it.
“What, you want to see the tattoo?” Tony teases, swallowing hard. His tongue feels thick and his mouth swollen, his heartbeat speeding up at the command.
He rubs his hand over his chest and sighs softly, releasing his breath slowly so he won't wake Steve. He closes his eyes, presses closer, and tries to go back to sleep.
All the nerves seep out of Tony’s body when he sees Steve’s smile, and he’s left only with the swelling emotion in his heart and the wet prickling heat in his eyes. He can barely breathe for the emotion that clogs his throat.
Tony barely notices the familiar cap click of the lube Steve magicked from one of their many stashes hidden around their room, still entranced with Steve’s chest when he feels slick fingers circling his entrance. He arches nearly off Steve’s lap as one hand pushes aside the tiny swatch of his panties to find him and slowly presses a finger inside, two knuckles deep.
As cliché as that may be, Steve can think of no other term that applies when he’s so intimately close to Tony, pushing inside of him as his husband stares up with dark eyes wide and full of wonder, love, and trust. Steve doesn’t think any term but “making love”
Steve is already awake and sitting up with the sheets pooled around his waist, pen working slowly across the hotel pad in his hand. Tony thinks that might've been what woke him up, the soft scratch of the nib against the paper, whispering scritches that pulled him from his dreams.
Rhodey laughs as he catches him, pulling Tony in for a tight hug. Tony presses a smacking loud kiss to Rhodey’s cheek and says, “I missed you, platypus. Never leave me again. You're definitely not allowed back to MIT, they can’t have you. I'll buy the school this time if I have to, but you're not leaving me again.”
“Yes, a non-disclosure agreement,” Tony says mildly, tapping his pen against the tablet screen. “Absolutely no one else must know this relationship is not real. None of our friends, none of our families, none of our pets, I mean absolutely
He’s under no delusion that Howard doesn’t know and see everything, and the only reason Tony got to spend so much time with Steve is because Howard allowed it to be so.
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, dipping his head to mouth along the column of Tony’s throat, his beard tickling the sensitive skin of Tony’s neck. He sucks gently at his collarbone, tongue sweeping along the numbers Tony has inked there, commemorating all the places where he’d been reborn before kissing the scars he finds at the shoulder joint as skin gives way to body warmed alloy.
“A nonagenarian,” Steve repeats with a sharp calculative gleam in his eyes. The gleam automatically triggers fight or flight in Tony, and he has to fight to tamp down the rush of desire that floods his belly when he stares back at that laser-focused look.
“You have the mind and preferences of a freshly minted nonagenarian,” Tony replies, not bothering to bite back his grin.
Tony does have to admit that the mountains are beautiful when they pull up to the lodge two hours later. They rise tall like sentinels in the distance, snow capped and dusted white from the winter storms. The resort itself is enormous, with immaculate sprawling grounds and a tall main building built almost entirely of windows and glass.
Steve gently cups Tony’s jaw and draws him in for a real kiss, slow and lingering until it grows heated and Tony opens beautifully beneath his lips. Steve can feel his chest tightening and his core warming when he has Tony pliant and soft in his arms like this, and he deepens the kiss with tongue and teeth until Tony tries to turn in his arms to face him.
It's nice, Tony thinks, in a pseudo-suburban kind of way. It's not rural by any stretch, but it's quiet and calm and rather lovely.
Maria lifts the lid carefully, and out of curiosity, Tony sidles closer to see what's inside. The hatbox is filled to the brim with envelopes, and upon closer look, they're all addressed to Maria. Some of letters are older than others, slightly yellow with age and crinkled in the corners. She lifts them one by one from the box with reverent care, placing a small stack of them in Tony's hands.
They don't end up going very far but the novelty of being able to leave school during fourth period is exhilarating and amazing. The sight of the brightly colored trees in the early afternoon light is extra beautiful and the crunch of dry leaves underfoot is extra satisfying. Even the smoggy city air feels great against Tony’s skin and he feels as though he’s just been released from jail. The bite of the late October chill does little to dampen his spirits despite his lack of a coat. The entire time, Steve keeps his arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders.
Steve's hand is a warm weight in his, and despite the tight grip, just having that touch feels alarmingly comforting, an anchor to his frayed nerves. Tony realizes belatedly that the social media clause in their contract is pointless, because the flurry of posts about them sure aren’t mutually decided by the two of them. Tony is sure that this fake relationship is probably trending on Twitter already, with everyone in the halls holding their phones up pointing shamelessly at the both of them as they walk by. There are several camera flashes as they pass, and the none too subtle whispers of gossip already spreading as fast as the wildfire tweets. They might even have a hashtag by now.
The walk up the wide flat steps to the school doors feels like a climbing a mountain and the minutes feel like hours. Tony's feet feel heavy and leaden and his heart is beating a mile a minute with a mixture of rage and grief and irrational shame. He knows there are crowds of students gathered behind the reporters, watching, staring, and judging. He clenches his fists tight to keep from decking any reporters that get too close.
“Yep,” Steve replies as he tugs him out the school doors. “Today is one of the only days I don't have practice.”
“This,” Steve says, skimming along the jagged horizontal line in Tony's side below his ribs, a facsimile of a cruel smile, “was when you fought a Titan, and lived. You challenged a creature powerful enough to bring a moon down on you. He did that because you were winning, and that was his only way to stop you.”
“Happy has the day off and I took the train here all by myself,” Tony announces as he shoves the packages of cookies and spice cake Jarvis baked into Steve's arms and loads the boxes of presents he brought on top.
Tony shakes his head and he presses his fingers against his mouth until his lips stop trembling. “He doesn't, J. He probably never did. I was just a means to an end, and I have no right to be upset about this. I agreed to it.
Tony swallows. “Hello to you too, dad,” he says pitching his voice with false cheer and backing it with every ounce of bravado he can muster. “How am I, your only and most dearest favoritest son? I’m doing great, dad, thanks for asking. Haven’t seen you in nearly two months so you probably missed the memo that I’m on my senior trip. I’ll be back in two days.”
Tony doesn’t retort that Howard can fuck off whenever he wants, leaving his teenage son to handle the entire SI R&D Department, but it’s a near thing. That’ll only cause more trouble, especially if Howard remembers this conversation the next time he comes home.
Tony doesn’t ask about his room again. He supposes he has no right to question Steve about whatever is in there, Peggy shrine or serial killer trophies or otherwise. If Steve doesn’t want to show him, there’s no reason for him to feel hurt about it.
It feels like an eternity before Steve withdraws his fingers and Tony is whimpering at the loss. He’s too empty, he needs Steve.
Hearing his full name like that makes Steve instantly warm from head to toe. He leans down for a proper kiss, a soft press of lips that steals the breath from his lungs. He shifts down closer until they’re pressed skin to skin and cradles Tony's face between his hands, stroking his thumbs along the sharp curves of his jaw. Tony is so gorgeous like this, pushing up underneath him, eyes closed and cheeks flushed, mouth parted to welcome Steve’s tongue.
He thinks about Steve's drawings and notes. He thinks about what Jarvis said. He thinks about what Natasha has done. He only cries harder.
Tony sighs, wonders if he's ever known the mansion to be warm and full of laughter but he doesn't say that. “Yeah,” he agrees instead.
Part of him wonders if this is all an elaborate joke, one last stab while he’s down. But a look at Steve’s face tells him everything, the open honesty and the wild desperation in his eyes. Tony thinks of what Rhodey told him.
“I don't want it to be,” Steve says firmly. His eyes are bright as he pulls Tony in for another kiss, a long press of lips that feels closer and warmer and far more desperate than the ones before.
“And I hate to be so cheesy about this,” Tony continues, “but it feels a lot like everything’s been leading up to this. Our decade as teammates and partners, as friends. And now, as the love of my life. God, I’m so lucky.”
“Oh wow,” Tony says, still chuckling. “Are you sure the kid wasn’t just trying to get nudes of you guys?” he jokes. “The whole team naked at the same time? I'm sure
Every gear in Tony's brain freezes and locks, grinding to an abrupt halt. So the rumors are true. He supposes that's why Steve has been moping around in the hallways for the entirety of October.
Her name is Janet van Dyne and she's the only other person there sitting outside of the kumbaya circle during the bonfire welcome party. Neither of them are willing to join the ring of chattering kids eager to impress one another and make friends as they roast marshmallows. The camp counselors glare at them, so Tony edges closer to her and they start to chat.
Tony can't help the sense of pride that swells in him to see his fake boyfriend dominate the game and heat curls low in his belly every time he sees Steve in his team colors. It's ridiculous, and Tony would suspect he's being conditioned if he doesn't know any better because Steve presses closer and his kisses linger far longer when he sneaks in moments to chat with Tony during practice while he's wearing that damn red and blue. It's driving Tony insane.
Tony tries his best to forget what Steve said as he steps into the shower. The jet of hot water pounding on his skin does little but echo the words over and over again until they ring hollow in his mind. He clenches his eyes shut and struggles to breathe. The water dripping down his face is salty and bitter by the time he’s finished, but the iron in his spine keeps his head up as he walks back out into the room.
Then someone darts in front of him and the next two minutes happen in a blur. When asked about it later, Tony and Steve will have very different versions of the story. It goes like this: one of the vultures manage to sneak out from behind Happy and gets close enough to grab Tony’s arm, voice recorder shoved under his nose. Tony instinctively turns, startled, and makes to wrench away when the question comes.
Steve shrugs. “I figured as much. Which was why I didn't just shove you away,” he points out archly. He pours Tony a cup of coffee from the pot.
Steve presses a kiss to the side of his head and without even thinking about it, Tony turns so Steve can give him a proper one on the lips. Something between them has changed since the night of the state championships. The kisses are more frequent and natural, the affection free flowing, and Tony can almost convince himself it's genuine. He’s decided he’ll just enjoy it while it lasts, while he can still pretend he has Steve. He’ll deal with the aftermath when it comes.
Loki snorts softly and pulls away. “Alas, you are simply not my type, but we probably could have taken over the world together.” He reaches over to gently pat Tony's face, long fingers trailing down his cheek. Tony turns his head to press a kiss against Loki’s palm and the smile that curves Loki’s lips is soft but genuine, and full of something that looks almost like regret.
He feels like an imposter as he walks back to their room and crawls into bed next to Steve, who is already hazy half asleep. Nevertheless, strong arms reach over to pull Tony snug against a broad chest, and Tony selfishly smoothes his palm over every inch of skin he can reach, claiming and wanting.
It feels so good Tony feels as though his brain might short circuit at any moment, his heart is going haywire and his breath is coming in choked gasps. He can't concentrate on anything but the feeling of Steve's mouth on him, alternating between licking broad stripes along the underside of his dick and sucking around the head before taking him deep to the root. He tangles his fingers in Steve's hair and he's all but done for when Steve looks up at him from beneath golden lashes, eyes heated and affectionate.
,” and drives him home. He doesn't need be taken care of, not really, but he's grateful all the same.
Tony rolls his eyes and tugs Loki forward for a hug. Loki sighs dramatically before wrapping long arms around him. “Of course,” Tony says. “I'm obviously still in love with you. Always will be.”
Admittedly, Tony has had a blissful few weeks spending every day he can after school with Steve, usually at Steve's house if he doesn't have practice and sitting on the bleachers overlooking the field if they're preparing for a game. Tony can't decide what he likes better: the late evenings when he cuddles warm next to Steve on the old couch as they run through a gamut of shows and movies they each insist the other to watch before getting up to help Sarah make dinner, or watching the team run drills with a hot coffee warming his hands from the late autumn chill, and Steve jogging up to him every so often to see what he's working on before departing again with a kiss on Tony's cheek.
That was really not anything Tony could have expected. “Are we breaking up?” he asks, perplexed. He's really not sure what this is about and he's wracking his brain for what he might've done wrong.
He’s grateful to Loki and Pepper for keeping the football team away. He sees Loki bodily shoving Thor away in the halls and he gives Loki a weak smile as he hurries past, Happy on speed dial. It’s only fourth period but he can’t do it, he can’t make it through the day, he has to go home. He turns off his phone.
Steve shakes his head and buries his face against Tony's shoulder as he shakes with rising laughter. The situation is so absurd, Tony starts laughing too, little chuckles that bubble out of his throat as he absently pets Steve's hair while they both struggle to gather themselves.
Before Tony can work past the rising lump in his throat to say anything, Steve wakes up with a start, his eyes darting wildly across the room before they settle on Tony. First, they’re panicked and frightened before they settle into forced bleary calm. There’s an edge of relief in the endlessly blue and infinitely sad, filled with silent wonderment. He looks slightly astonished, as though he’s just seen a ghost and he thinks Tony might disappear in the next second.
“Steve's most prized possession is a vintage comic book from the forties. Mint. The cover is his favorite superhero punching Hitler in the face,” Clint supplies.
Tony bites hard on his tongue to keep his words in, settling in to tune out the acerbic words even as the hand holding his phone trembles. He wanders aimlessly in the hall as Howard rants, smiling tensely at the classmates he passes.
“So I just assumed you wanted me around only as a fuck buddy but then there would be little moments that gave me hope. I thought you finally got it on New Year when you saw yourself in my drawings but I still should’ve said something. And it clearly left doubts in your mind.”
. That was Peggy promising to keep her distance because she sees how uncomfortable her presence makes you.”
“Didn't mean you, Barton,” Tony replies, pulling Steve's arm up to go around his shoulders and burrowing into his side as Steve chuckles.
“I do,” Steve says quietly, looking steadily at Tony. Tony can't quite read his expression but there's something warm and affectionate in his eyes and the warm hand settled at the nape of his neck feels like a promise.
Tony looks over at him askance, pausing in the middle of licking his fingers clean. “Don't know what you mean. I've been great all day, honeybun.”
“Bullshit! Is it the soda? We could’ve gotten her sodas if she wanted but she’s never let my friends and me out of the school gates during lunch, no matter what we offered her,” Tony says.
Steve sucks in a deep shaky breath. “Tony, please. Just—” he shakes his head and rubs a hand across his face. He looks exhausted, if the dark circles under his eyes are anything to go by, not that Tony cares one bit. “If you don't want an us when I'm done with saying whatever it is I need to tell you, then I'll understand and I'll never bother you again. But please, just hear me out.”
“Tony!” Rhodey says sharply, snapping him out of his feverish plans. “Come on, man. We've been over this. I know you're thinking about it again. You're going to stay here, finish your senior year, and then you can decide which college you want to attend or if you want to
The only real part of any of it was Tony's foolishness and hubris, thinking it was ever a good idea to play Russian roulette with his heart. He rubs at his chest and sighs.
“And no kissing?” Steve’s voice sounds a little off. He’s probably grossed out at the idea of kissing Tony, but he’s going to do it for the sake of their charade anyways.
Tony’s first step off the ship is unsteady and painful, the badly healed wound in his waist lancing a sharp pain through his side. The second step floods him with relief, and he could cry for the feeling of Terran gravity and packed earth beneath his feet. Tony breathes for what feels like the first time in days, inhaling the sharp cold air. It smells of pine and grass, with a bite of autumn chill.
Tony ignores the blast of notifications from his phone informing him he and Steve have become a trending topic within minutes. The internet can talk about Iron Man and the former Captain America kissing in Greece, but Tony couldn't care less when he has Steve this close, and Steve is looking back at him like he’s hung the moon.
“Yeah, you dummy,” Pepper says as she taps his cheek lightly. “You might be the genius here but sometimes you make really dumb decisions.”
The last week of winter vacation passes with a blur of SI projects Howard unloads on Tony after demanding deadlines for the first week of January. Tony spends his days and nights in his lab at home, calling Jarvis to let him know he’s sorry, but he won’t be able to visit after all. He can hear the disappointment in Jarvis’s voice when he sighs, and there’s the reminder to eat again.
Even from the distance, Tony sees the moment when Steve's eyes widen too in realization, but he doesn't see any more after that because he pivots on autopilot and all but flies down the hall, needing desperately to escape.
What must be two hundred pounds of muscle is suddenly pinning Tony immobile against the couch as dexterous fingers wriggle against his ribs. Tony shrieks and howls, trying desperately to writhe away as Steve laughs and presses his fingers harder into his sides.
She runs inquisitive hands up Steve's arms, shaking her head in admonishment when he winces away from her. “You’re overworking yourself,
Tony knows it’s payback for making Steve blush earlier that morning with the parting kiss, and Tony is
Tony had expected Steve to try to get him to go to bed, insist he needs some rest, but he's inordinately grateful that Steve doesn't. “You don't have to do that,” he says, his voice suddenly hoarse.
They're so caught up in the tickle fight, they don't hear the front door opening and closing and nearing footsteps until it's too late. A lamp flickers on with a soft
The urge to cry swells up from deep in Tony's belly again and he wants so very badly to tell Pepper everything. He doesn't deserve the genuine joy he sees in her eyes as she smiles at him, doesn't deserve the happiness she feels for him thinking his farce is a real relationship. He swallows down the truth and forces a smile on his lips.
Tony lasts an embarrassing total of one and a half minutes, surprised he even made it that long when Steve is looking at him like that. He only makes it past the minute mark because he’s counting the seconds to stave off his orgasm. He’s tumbling off the edge when he feels Steve’s hand trail down from the base of his cock to press his palm up against his balls. Long fingers reach back to trace gentle circles around his rim, a soft touch that electrifies every part of Tony and he can feel the heat rushing from his belly down, toes curling against the floor and his harsh grip on Steve’s hair must hurt. He tries to warn Steve, but Steve only grips his thighs tight and swallows, sighing as Tony comes down his throat.
“Hey, sunshine,” Tony replies just as quietly, stroking his thumb along the line of Steve’s jaw. “Last chance to back out,” he says casually, even as his heart thuds.
“I'll join the army I guess,” Steve says, one corner of his mouth lifting higher, but his expression is clouded with sadness. “My dad served, before I was born. There aren’t that many options for someone like me. I’m not well off like the other kids at school. I wouldn't be able to pay my own tuition and I'm not going to burden my ma with a loan, not with Da gone.”
Pepper finds him there later that night and holds him close as he shakes with tears, smoothing gentle hands down the bowed curve of his back.
Steve’s hair is pomaded into a soft wave of sunspun gold he’s neatly slicked back, but he’s still barefoot with his shirt open and pants untucked. Tony steps into the circle of Steve’s embrace when he opens his arms for him and runs a hungry palm down the planes of his husband’s chest, greedy for the miles of skin. His fingers trace along the ink he finds there, the black lines circling the sacred heart—Tony’s heart inked right over Steve's sternum, and the TS next to it.
“That was what you wanted,” Tony points out. “That was the contract. You don't have to explain anything to me because I fucking get it, so if that's all you want to talk about, we’re just repeating ourselves over and over again—”
Tony makes a loud noise to cut him off, but the teasing does its job. The butterflies in his belly settle a little, and his nerves calm just the slightest bit. The thrum of anticipation and excitement still feels like a livewire beneath his skin, but Rhodey’s calm steadying presence soothes him, and Tony is overwhelmed with how grateful he feels to have his best friend by his side.
On the seventh day, he goes upstairs for breakfast and finds Jarvis in the pantry. Tony pulls him into a hug as tears drip from his eyes, and Jarvis shakes as he holds him close. Tony's heart is feeling the slightest bit better. He can feel the cracks keloiding closed, cell by cell, sinuous fiber armoring the weakest parts of him, and he begins to forgive. Later that day, he calls Natasha.
And yey, now the fic is done! Thank you again to everyone who’s read this, and left a kudos or comment. Your feedback is always loved and appreciated, and it really kept me going when I had doubts about this fic. Your support for this fic means the world to me.
“This,” Steve says, brushing his hand down the red and gold peonies on his flesh arm, romance and prosperity, “is for us, our marriage. We beat the impossible odds and overcame everything to be together. We fought so hard for each other, my love, so I can hold you now.”
Afterwards, he and Steve collapse on the sofa with rapid onset food coma. Tony can do little more than loll his head over the sofa back to blink blearily at Steve who looks just as dazed as he feels while old Christmas movies play ignored on the TV.
He thinks of Quill, whose grief and rage cost them everything, and Tony wonders if he can even blame that sorrow for its destructive fault. He thinks of Strange and the look in his eyes when he handed over the very thing they were all willing to die to protect, his hands shaking as they all sighed in defeat. He thinks of Peter’s last moments, and he can still feel Peter’s ashes clinging to the beds of his fingernails. He still doesn’t know what he’ll find at the compound, if he’ll be met with silent halls and empty rooms.
“Yes,” Jarvis says. “She was—still is, quite beautiful, and I like to think that nothing makes anyone more beautiful than when we look at them when we're in love. Love rosetints our vision and it makes us blind to all but our darlings even in a crowded room. I've filled sketchbook after sketchbook with drawings of Ana, trying my hardest to capture the exact light in her eyes and the graceful arch of her hand that I love so much.”
Just their luck, Tony thinks to himself. He sighs and says, “Suit’s already sending out a distress signal, for all the good it’ll do us up here.”
“Head in the game, Rogers,” she scolded him before raising an eyebrow. She then offered him a hand as her expression softened.
Laughing, Tony dropped down next to him. “That’s the spirit!” He patted Steve on the shoulder. “You’ve already broken some gym equipment. Why not ruin the mats, too?”
Steve laughed and nudged the big bag of electronics next to him. “Yeah, something tells me not many people can beat you on that topic.”
He was panting now, too. It felt like he’d run a hundred miles without stopping. He was pretty sure that Tony was saying something, but the words sounded far away. His attention was instead drawn to sudden movement above him. The head of the creature was rubbing against his cheek.
Steve took that as a sign that he was at least going to cooperate and went about getting ready for bed. By the time he turned back to check on the man, he was fast asleep. It was an odd sight, the man sitting there on a bath stool in a fancy suit with his black socks against the gray tiled floor. He ran a hand through his hair and huffed out a breath. He had a feeling that this capsule hotel wouldn’t have much space, but he didn’t feel right leaving this man here like this. He needed to figure something out, though. Otherwise he wouldn’t be getting much sleep, either. The last thing he wanted was to get them
Bucky flaps a hand at him before turning back to his sandwich. “Yeah, yeah, yeah, Stevie's shy about his art, the giant dork.”
Tony inexplicably wants to cry. No one has ever really cared enough to ask what he's working on before. Everyone always assumes it’s Important Classified SI Business, leave Tony to it, it's going to take a while, he’s going to hole up in his lab doing who knows what.
Steve breathes a gusty sigh through his nose and squares his shoulders. They really are very impressive shoulders. “I've liked you since we were kids, Tony, since the first day we met in ninth grade,” he says slowly as though he's afraid Tony might bolt again. “I've always liked you.”
Even from across the room, he can pinpoint exactly where Peggy Carter is sitting with her friends and he feels her gaze the second her eyes land on their table, and on them.
Clint spends his days crouched in the vents and his nights prowling the halls, a silent watcher. He and Thor haunt the halls of the compound like aimless spectres, footsteps leaden with their losses.
Steve whose smile shines the brightest in his eyes, his laughter warm, and his affection freeflowing. Tony has never known anyone as tactile as Steve, who's always eager to sling an arm around his shoulders and press a kiss to his lips.
one on the team after all, he has plenty of other things to look at, and the world certainly doesn't revolve around Steven fucking Grant Rogers, not that Tony cares about him one tiny bit. “What is he? Goalie?”
has become. He feels sick to his stomach of the idea what if they were to have a real conversation of what they're doing, Steve will come to his senses and remember the real goal.
Tony trembles and shakes in Jarvis's arms. He has it wrong. He has it all wrong. They're just silly drawings, meaningless and certainly not evidence that Steve ever gave a shit about him.
“Steven Grant Rogers,” his mother says sternly, but there's laughter dancing in her eyes as she stares down at the both of them. “This was
Before Tony can reply, the door opens and a small, enthusiastic whirlwind in pink and white organza crashes into his legs. Tiny arms wrap around his thighs as a grinning face peers up at him. Morgan’s hair is pulled into a neat plait and there’s pink gloss staining her lips that she promptly smears on his pants. Tony laughs and swings her up in his arms, just as Pepper comes in through the door too. Morgan is getting too big to carry, but Tony doesn’t care as he holds his baby girl close.
He deepens their kiss suddenly, turning the sweet press of lips into a wet slide of tongues and sharp little nips of teeth as his arms curl around Steve’s shoulders to drag bring him downwards and press ever closer. Soft moans fall from Tony's lips as he grinds against Steve, using his legs as leverage and locking his ankles around Steve’s waist to thrust up. Their skin feels hot where they meet, Tony’s erection a searing line against his own.
Steve hums in consideration, his eyes roving around the lab, taking in the haphazard pile of metal in the corner, the benches and counters scattered throughout the large space, the bank of monitors anchored to the wall behind them, the detritus of tools and parts laying on every available surface, and the threadbare couch pushed against the far wall where Tony powernaps when he has a spare moment. It's the first time Steve has been down in the mansion’s basement, Tony realizes.
“Not if we don't want it to be,” Tony replies. He kisses Steve again. “This is what they expect of us anyways,” he adds, the careless sweep of his arms encompassing the still cheering crowd and Peggy who is watching them from her huddle of cheerleaders. He doesn't want to talk about this. He's already aching to kiss Steve again.
The indignity of their crushing defeat is worth all of the gut busting laughter and joy of having these ridiculous people as friends because just a few months ago, Tony would not have believed some of these people
After carefully considering his sunglasses for a moment, Tony snatches them up and puts them back on, not knowing who might be in the diner watching and listening. The shades also help deflect the Sullen Steve Stare directed at him. Steve should consider trademarking his very specific look of determined disapproval, as though he doesn’t find Tony the least bit endearing.
Tony absolutely does not expect to be pulled down the block and towards the nearest subway station. He's dragged down the steps, into the cavernous fluorescent underground, Steve's large hand still tightly gripping his. His eyes widen in horror as he realizes what's happening, what Steve is expecting them to do and shudders at the thought of having to be on a dirty train, crowded with grumpy tired commuters. He can already feel the oppressive crowd of bodies surrounding him, all of them stuck in a rattling metal can with no way out.
He locks himself in his basement lab for lengthy hours at a time so Jarvis would have gone home before he goes back upstairs. He can't find it in himself to talk to even Jarvis at the moment, everything overwhelming and painful. He knows Jarvis means well, but it's hard to stomach the idea of anyone, even Jarvis pitying him. Everything still feels too raw and sharp and he just wants to be alone.
From this angle, it was hard to tell what was going on, exactly. Unfortunately, the audio filled him in on anything he was missing visually. Steve’s comm was still on, which meant that every moan, yell, and enthusiastically uttered expletive was perfectly audible. He now knew what it sounded like when Steve came. Heck, he now knew what Steve sounded like when he had several orgasms in succession.
Tony pushed himself up and winked at him. “Maybe,” he said as he laughed softly. Glancing over at some readout floating in the air above Steve’s head, Tony nodded to himself. “It starts to hurt and you tell me, okay? I’ve tested this, but better safe than sorry and all that.”
“I’ll scan the area and see if I can find anything that might pass for shelter.” Even if he’s in no shape to fly out, it’s not like he’s useless. It takes a few moments before something promising shows up on the HUD, and Tony points toward their 2 o’clock. “In that direction. Seeing evidence of some kind of structure about a kilometer from here.”
“Took a bunch of trains then hopped on the Shinkansen. Once I got on the bullet train, it was super fast. But all the stuff before that took most of the day.”
Well, wasn’t that just wonderful? Steve sighed. He knew what it was like to have a day like this when nothing seemed to go your way.
Halfway through removing his pants, Steve glanced up at the sound of the voice. That’s right. He had been talking to Tony.
The man’s gaze is piercing as he seems to look for something in Steve’s expression. “The way I see it: I want you, and you smell like you want me, so…” His voice is firm; completely unlike a stereotypical omega, as he says, “So get over here and fuck me, already.”
Groaning quietly to himself, he opened his eyes and followed Steve and Nat onto the quinjet, hoping he could keep up the charade for a few more minutes.  He was now having trouble keeping his eyes open and had to constantly stifle yawns all throughout the journey. His baby was really messing with him; making him overly fatigued and yet prohibiting him from any and all caffeine.
He sighed, adjusting himself so the suit could sit semi comfortably against him, wrapping an arm around him for support. If he was there right now, he would be snuggled into his arms and fast asleep. But he was not in the suit, he was half toppled in a chair and only about 12% awake.
Maybe they should've been smarter about it but they were both notorious for making terrible ‘in the moment’ decisions. Nevertheless, Tony took the test and when he was met with the little plus sign everything went fuzzy. His mind was bombarded with questions: how was he going to tell Steve? How would being an Avenger affect the child’s life? Did he even want to be a father? And even worse, did Steve want to?
“Have you told him yet?” Tony shook his head. All of this still didn’t feel real. Two years ago he had been dying and now he was sitting on a medical table with Bruce, holding the small plastic test in his hands. Every time he went to sleep Tony feared he would wake up and all of this would be gone but so far he had awoken to Steve’s warm smile and all was right in the world.
As he watched his chest rise and fall Steve began thinking of all the times he could’ve made the first move, when he could’ve told Tony how he felt. They might’ve had a life together but now he was afraid that one kiss could be it. He was an optimist by nature but seeing the half-dead body of his almost partner he was anything but hopeful.
“My apologies sirs, but Director Fury is on the other line. There seems to be a disturbance downtown that requires the Avengers’ attention.”
Sorry for the long wait, I had a heck of trouble writing the battle scene until I decided to cut it all together.
“After your comms when down we suspected the worst,” she looked over at Tony’s frail body, currently being looked over by their medical team, and then back at Steve’s sullen face, “I’m glad we were able to find you in time.” Her words went in one ear and out the other; Steve was hyper-focused on every little thing the doctors were doing to Tony.
“Steve…” Tony’s weak voice was heartbreaking and he had visible tears in his eyes. He turned to face Steve and put his cold and clammy hand against his face, but Steve only felt warmth as Tony slowly pulled him close and kissed him.
Steve peaked out from behind his cover and just barely drew his shield up in time to block the incoming bullet, the sound of echoing in his ears. Yes, both of their uniforms were mostly bulletproof but they weren't flawless and eventually one of them was going to get hurt if they tried to leave with the gunmen.
The battle wasn't anything difficult, it was just some tech junkie trying to get revenge by making a ton of robots attack downtown. Tony couldn’t help but critique the shoddy quality they had and made mental notes on how they could've been improved. Maybe when the guy got done serving his time he could visit and give him some pointers.
Tony had been shot repeatedly in the chest and a couple of them had broken through the metal, both the bullets and the armor shrapnel had dug deep into his skin. Steve wasn't sure if he could get the suit off without dragging that shrapnel along Tony’s torso but if one of his lungs had been damaged they were working against the clock.
“Relax, he’s been stabilized. We’re keeping him in ICU until we’re confident he can breathe on his own again but his chances are steadily improving.” It was as if his asthma had been cured again; Steve could finally breathe again. “You can visit one at a time, just try not to disturb him. He’s still out of it but he needs to rest in order to heal.” Steve nodded and then looked back at the other two people next to him, asking for permission.
Tony looked leaps and bounds better than he did on the jet, even though he now had a tube down his throat and was hooked up to a ventilator. But he had color back in his face and he could see heavy-duty bandages underneath the heart monitor pads. He was going to be ok. Steve pulled a chair up next to the bed and took Tony’s hand, feeling the roughness of the callouses but it was nice and warm now that he wasn't in shock.
Fearing the worst, he went to Bruce and asked him for help, and Bruce’s suggestion of a pregnancy test was a little out of left field for Tony. He had never thought about pregnancy. Yes it was possible but Tony wasn't exactly in his prime and there's no telling what kind of weirdness Steve’s serum did to his fertility.
“Alright, for their sake, no more coffee.” Tony made a mental note to add a protocol to JARVIS to make absolutely sure he didn't fuck everything up with his habits. He wouldn’t let himself turn into his father.
“If I had known all I needed to do to get you to kiss me was to nearly die, I would’ve done it a long time ago.”
“Thanks.” He quietly placed the now clean trash bin outside Tony’s door before sneaking downstairs to the kitchen. Bruce was the only one there, waiting by the toaster while sipping on a cup of tea. He greeted Steve when he walked by but saw his worried expression and gained one of his own.
Steve awoke to the sound of Tony throwing up. He was only half-awake but there was no mistaking that type of sound and the fact that Tony was doing it in the mini trash can they kept by the side of the bed. Nevertheless, he was at his side, rubbing his back and soothing him.
“I’ll tell Steve, I promise. If he wants to tell everyone else then that’s what we’ll do. As much as I don't want to tell Fury he would be able to make some reason to keep the media off my back for a while. The worst he can do is yell at me, I can handle yelling.” His bravado didn’t fool Bruce.
Steve learns of Tony's secret. Knowing Tony is afraid Steve will leave him one day, Steve decides there's only one solution.
But Bruce’s tests said that the embryo was developing normally, even though Tony wasn't far enough along to see much on the ultrasound. He was about six weeks.
“Shit.” Tony cursed under his breath. He barely got his thoughts together before Steve was punching in his access code and walking over to him. Tony’s heart began to race. This was it. Steve was going to yell at him for his incompetence  before telling him it was over and walking away. He could just hide but that might just anger him further.
Bruce was right about Natasha’s intuition, she confronted Tony about his ‘secret’ only K$#a day after he and Bruce had talked. She had the same attitude Bruce had about Steve knowing but also understood his concerns. If the wrong people found out it could spell trouble for Tony and the child.
“I don’t know anyone who can stop her from doing what she wants, but I don’t think she’s at that point yet. Yet.” There was a murmur offscreen from Nat herself and Steve added, “She says she’s got thirty more minutes of patience, so we’ll be done by then one way or another.” Tony was already counting down the seconds until he had his Steve back in his arms again.
“If this keeps up much longer, I’m not the one who’ll be needing luck. An angry Natasha’s worse than the Hulk.”  Peter laughed and Tony cracked a smile; hell hath no fury like a pissed off Russian.
Tony groaned. He didn't know if he could last 9 months without his precious bean juice. But then he thought of his baby. His baby was counting on Tony.
“Call Steve and put it on speaker.” Tony may have felt guilty calling Steve to calm him down but this was for Peter, and who better to say that Captain America was alive and well then the man himself?
Tony’s mind short circuited. “What.” He pulled away from Steve and saw that there was no anger in the blond’s face, only worry.
Tony severely underestimated his baby. The nausea got worse and Tony felt like he was constantly in the bathroom, either puking his guts out or emptying his seemingless bladder. He was always exhausted but JARVIS did his job and disabled all coffee machines whenever Tony tried to sneak a cup. Whatever, Tony could make it without his lifeblood.
Still, he was sore and he was tired. He almost shut down the suit and put it on autopilot so he could close his eyes for a moment when he remembered that everyone thought he was in it. It would raise a few eyebrows if he flew back off alone instead of attending the customary post fight flight.
That’s how Tony’s mind worked. It would give him a glimmer of hope and then smash it with the sledgehammer of reality. Years and years of psychological damage will do that.
Even now, Steve was out on a recon mission of a suspected HYDRA facility. Every time either of them walked out the door there was the high probability of not coming home. There was no telling how much longer they had to live. He wanted to watch their child go up. He wanted to have Steve with him. The world didn't let him have nice things.
When she finally left Steve resumed his post at Tony’s side and embraced him as much as the bandages and monitors could allow. He never wanted to let go, but Tony was tensed underneath him and he reluctantly let go. He had a bewildered look on his face before his eyes widened and his face went as red as it could in his condition.
“Hey Tones,” he whispered, kneeling down beside Tony, “it’s time for bed.” Carefully as to not disturb him, Steve lifted him up into his arms and walked him up the stairs to his room. Technically they both slept in there so it was kinda their room, just Steve kept most of his clothes and personal items in his own next door. He removed Tony’s shoes and wiped the grease off his face before placing him on the bed. Or at least attempting to since Tony clung to him like a newborn koala.
“Dad? Can you hand me my Captain America plushie?” Smiling, he went to the shelf and grabbed the toy in question, an old Captain America plush doll that Peter had gotten for his third birthday. He handed Peter the doll and he hugged it tightly before laying back down under the covers. No more nightmares tonight.
“Soon buddy, very soon.” Tony kissed him on the forehead, gently running his hands through Peter’s hair.  He whimpered in response and then pressed his face back into Tony’s shoulder.
“Tony, I need to take my uniform off. I refuse to sleep in this thing.” Tony whined in response before loosening his grip and Steve tossed a blanket over him to keep him warm while he changed.
“Go on, we’ll wait here while you visit your boyfriend.” He stood up and took a couple of steps before realizing what Nat had said. He turned around and she just smiled and winked. He should’ve known better than trying to hide something from her.
Tony relaxes further into the mattress as Steve continues gently opening him up. He focuses on just taking deep breaths and not thinking about the searing pain along his back.
“Who knows?” Bruce takes a sip of his water. “No one’s even sure what the evolutionary purpose of this would be, let alone if someone could have multiple super compatible partners.”
As his vision started to narrow and darken, he glimpsed a flash of red and gold in his peripheral vision. The thought that Tony was so close sent a wave of relief through him. He put his last ounce of strength into reaching up for the metal-clad figure.
“Goodnight,” Steve murmured into the cramped space of the sleep capsule before reaching up to turn off the light.
Steve thinks he manages to mumble out something that could be a ‘sorry’ before pulling back. It’s an odd sensation, with his whole body feeling so light. He nearly loses his balance because his hips are moving of their own accord. Dizzy, he gazes down to find his knot fully inside Tony. Heat radiates from where they’re connected to the rest of his body.
But—gala. They have an event they must attend in a little under an hour. Tony reluctantly pulls away.
“I know Pepper has a contingency plan,” Tony replies, his fingers lightly skimming the row of buttons down Steve’s chest. “She knows better than to expect us to show up at events by now.”
It’s in perfect moments like these when Steve is inside Tony his mind becomes all at once peacefully blank and hyper focused. Everything narrows down to the feeling of Tony wrapped around him and the pants of his breath against Steve’s neck, his juddering gasps and whispered encouragement, heartbeat echoing alongside Steve’s own.
one,” he replies, knowing the teasing laughter behind his voice belies the truth. He's delighted to see Steve's smile crack into a wide grin.
“Something I might regret later,” Tony intones mockingly. “Are you making choices for me too now?” He knows he’s being petty, but he’s always pushing things when it comes to Steve. He’s always pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to find the weak spot, trying to get Steve to crack. Even now he can’t help himself.
Today will be the day Tony finally works up the nerve to tell Steve this can’t go on for much longer. They either make this fake relationship real, or Steve puts Tony out of his misery and goes back to Peggy. He nods as he packs up for the day. He slams his locker shut with a decisive
It makes a certain warmth curl in Tony’s chest to hear Steve actually introduce him as his boyfriend, fake or not. It’s fucking ridiculous. “It’s nice to meet you, Ben,” Tony offers, a genuine smile curving his lips.
“Then I got that letter, and I got too hopeful, thinking I had a chance,” Steve says on the next breath, sounding as though he desperately needs to blurt everything out, “but I was too late already because you don’t feel that way anymore. And then we started—doing all of
“C’mon, c’mon,” Tony begs, whimpering when Steve draws out nearly all the way before sliding back in. He's barely coherent as he's blissed out on how full he feels, reveling in the slight burn as Steve presses into him again and again. All he can feel is Steve, deep inside of him, a thick fullness that feels overwhelming because there's so
“How dare you, you little shit,” Howard snarls. “What makes you think you have the luxury to just fly off whenever you feel like it without completing your tasks?”
Needless to say, Tony wants to climb this guy like a tree. Not that he would, seeing as how Tony does
“Cap, I fucking swear I’m going to bust in there and drag you out myself if you don’t say something.”
it.” He thrust once, hard, and Steve gagged. “You were made for this.” He kept going, his thrusts getting faster and more forceful. “You give it up so easy, don’t you? Even a fucking bug can tell how easy you are.”
date his employees. He decides to blame his oncoming heat for how all these thoughts are going right to his dick. And who knows, maybe this guy is a contractor working on the building? Which means he wouldn’t technically be an employee… Tony shakes his head as he slams the brakes on that train of thought. Shit like this is why he
“A-Ah,” he gasped as the pressure continued to increase and his abdomen bulged out more. His back arched as he struggled against his restraints. It was too much, yet so,
That was when Steve glanced down and realized why Tony’s hand felt different. There was a definite bulge to his stomach, smoothing out the usually well defined lines of his abdominal muscles.
The sound of that familiar, modulated voice cut through Steve’s pleasure-laden haze. He glanced away from the creature to find Tony in the armor standing in the room’s entrance. It was a disorienting contrast to everything Steve had been experiencing up until now.
Tony blinks a few times. Right. He’s stuck in an elevator. Which is a bad thing. People are coming to rescue them.
This was getting to be too much. Steve finally pulled away so he could turn around and really face Tony. Once he saw that thoughtful expression on Tony’s face, he knew this was trouble.
“Sure. Hit me.” Tony steels himself for what’s next. He hisses when he feels the first sting from the disinfectant.
“It’s a good thing I love him,” Tony says, his voice dipping to a low intimate quiet as he drags his hand up from Steve’s shoulder to cup his jaw. He can feel the bob of Steve’s throat as he swallows, eyes half lidded as he stares down at Tony.
Sarah is already puttering around in the kitchen when they join her. Steve presses a quick kiss to her cheek she returns with a smile as he moves in to snatch the colander of vegetables from her hands.
“It's just going to get worse from here,” Tony mumbles. He feels cold all of a sudden, the warmth from his sandwich dissipating with his good mood. He didn't get the chance to grab his jacket before they left school and the autumn wind is ruffling through his hair, sending shivers across his shoulders. “They're ruthless when they find something new to latch onto and they won't let go until they've turned over every stone and ripped everything to shreds.”
“Pepper,” Tony sighs, as he inhales half of his coffee in four gulps. The bitter taste of life sustaining caffeine burns as it slides down his throat, but he’s immediately a little more awake. “Virginia. Pepper-up. Pepto Bismol. Moon of my life. My sun and stars. Have I told you how much I loved you today?”
In his disappointment, Tony barely registers the metal that now gleams on Steve’s wrists until his husband outstretches his hand to beckon him close.
clause to the contract. Steve looks crestfallen when Tony presents him with the tablet, but he signs it with a sigh. Tony doesn’t quite understand his reaction, he had thought it’s what Steve wants while he waits for Peggy to come around. It’s the only possible explanation for the new direction of their fake relationship.
In the split second between the question connecting in his brain but before Tony can register what is really happening, the recorder clatters onto the ground in front of him and someone’s foot stomps on it, crushing it to pieces. The foot kicks the pieces of plastic away for good measure, and the hand that was gripping Tony’s arm is flung violently away from him.
“Jarvis….” by this point, the tears are free flowing, and Tony swipes harshly at his cheeks, trying to scrub the tears away.
. It doesn't stop Tony from selfishly taking while he's able, treasuring each minute they spend together, and making every excuse for just one more second, one more moment.
“You can't just add players midcampaign, Thor,” Bucky growls impatiently. “That's going to upset the game and undermine a long campaign we all worked really hard on.”
“You don’t have to stop there,” Tony quips as he hiccups past the tears he knows are dripping down his face by now, as their friends laugh. “You can keep going on about my merits.”
Tony shakes his head adamantly. “When we get home,” he says, and he thinks he means it this time. This has gone on for long enough, and he doesn’t know if he can keep doing this when it’s all a farce. He needs to know what Steve decides, one way or another, and he thinks maybe he’s had more than his share of borrowed time already.
“I love every part of you, sweetheart, so much,” Steve says, “but these are some of my favorites. Because this,” he begins, stroking tender fingertips along the crows feet at Tony’s eyes, “is love and laughter. I want you to be happy always, beloved, and I never want you to know another day of pain.”
Tony watches the bob of Steve's Adam's apple as he swallows. “Sure,” Steve says quietly, and Tony wonders why his voice sounds so breathless.
,” Tony repeats sardonically. “I might love Pepper but I know we'll never be right for each other. Not that it's any of your business. The last thing I want to do is hurt any of my friends.”
“Then let’s not give them anything to talk about,” Tony says reasonably, resuming his caresses along the line of Steve’s chest. Steve catches his hand before he can start undoing the buttons, but Tony can tell he’s about to give in if the way Steve’s thumb traces the Love bracelet on his wrist is any indication, eyes half lidded and darkly intent.
“Fuck,” he breathes quietly to himself. This must be Steve's doing, it has to be, Steve playing dirty and bringing in the big guns, he fucking knows Pepper is probably the only one who can get him to quit early, but he hasn't spoken to Pepper in weeks, the guilt of the letters and the whole thing with Steve eating away at him along with the shit from Howard and he's been avoiding Pepper at school and Rhodey’s messages he's such a crappy friend why would they want to be his friend anymore Pepper isn't here to help she's here to yell at him it's what he deserves oh god this is going to be the end of two of his best friendships he's always fucking everything up—
Steve ignores Tony’s demands until he feels his husband is ready, never wanting to hurt him. Tony is near begging by the time Steve withdraws his fingers and slicks up his own cock. He pulls Tony in for another deep kiss as he presses his cock in, pushing slowly through the first tight rings of resistance and sliding home to slick gripping heat.
for the fifth time, and Sam has to sit between the two of them to keep them from going for each other's throats. After they calm down enough, because apparently Monopoly can destroy lifelong friendships, they start a game of blackjack. Tony is very good at counting cards, but Natasha somehow manages to clean house round after round until they all fold.
Tony hums. “Yeah,” he says, and turns over to reach up for Steve, trying to pull him back in. But Steve, the bastard, laughs again and leans away.
“Leave ‘em on, baby,” Steve says, slackening his hand again to rub gentle circles along the base of Tony’s neck. Every so often, his fingers catch against the chain Tony wears with Steve’s dog tags.
Later, Natasha paints Tony’s toes as he braids Loki’s hair, and Tony tries not to think too much of his earlier sadness. They chat and banter and eat pie and ice cream, and Tony thinks wonderingly of how he got so lucky with his friends, that these people are willing to put up with him at all.
“It's only ten forty now,” Steve says, glancing at his phone. He reaches over to pull Tony closer until he's laying half sprawled on top of Steve with his head pillowed on Steve's chest. “I'm not so sure we can make it either the food coma creeping in. We should probably set an alarm.”
"'Sup,” he had said to the other occupants of the table when he sat down next to Steve during that first week. They were all gaping at the both of them, staring at where Steve and Tony were linked by their hands, looking shellshocked. “Tony Stark,” he had said pompously, relying heavily on his best and most plasticky smile to keep the nerves from showing.
Without hesitation Steve turned around and grabbed Tony’s arm, shielding them while wrapping his arm around Steve’s shoulder. The suit plus Tony was incredibly heavy but not enough that Steve couldn't support his weight while running. He was, however, slowed down.
“My lung’s been hit. I have barely been able to breathe for the last twenty minutes and everything’s starting to go fuzzy. Even if you were able to get me to the medical team right now I wouldn’t make it to the hospital. And,” he swallowed hard and they both fought back tears, “HYDRA will find us eventually. You can get to safety.” Steve shook his head, not believing what he was hearing.
Steve saw Tony's expression and his suddenly changed. “I uh, misread the situation i guess. I’m sorry.”
“Papa was ambushed. He started fighting all the bad guys but then-then he-and-” Another torrent of tears came and he clung to Tony like a lifeline. “I was there but I couldn’t help him and then he got shot and he screamed and there was so much blood and he stopped moving and-and-”
Unfortunately, he wasn't really focusing on his surroundings and kinda went into ninja fighting mode as soon as Tony’s hand touched him. He leaped over the counter with incredible speed and landed on the wall, ready to shoot webs at his attacker if he needed to. He was tense for a few moments and then he looked into his father's eyes and sheepishly climbed back onto the floor, trying to ignore the mess of ice cream and broken bowl on the floor.
Peter was silent and still while the phone rang. He counted one ring, two rings, three rings. By five rings Peter’s heart sank. Maybe his Papa was too busy or maybe his dream was real and he actually was in-
Tony was unresponsive when Steve first picked him up but he slowly came to as the two of them came closer and closer to getting out. Steve could hear his breathing over the comms: heavy, ragged, and labored. He didn't want to examine Tony’s wound until they were safe but the chances of it being a superficial wound began diminishing and it slowly became apparent that he was seriously hurt.
“Excuse me, are you the group with Tony Stark?” Steve perked his head up, not even wiping his face, and said,
“Yeah, well I think so. See, Tony’s been acting weird lately and he just threw up and I’m worried there’s something wrong with him. I’ve asked him about it but he says he’s fine. I was wondering if you could discreetly take a look at him just to make sure.” Bruce was silent for a moment, then he pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.
“Nobody got injured if that’s what you’re asking. Some old buildings got damaged and Ross is making a big deal out of it, otherwise, we’d be home already.” Tony grumbled under his breath at the mention of the infamous Secretary of State who, for some reason, had made it his mission to paint the Avengers in the worst light possible. He was glad Steve was dealing with him; Ross hated Tony the most and tended to push his buttons whenever they crossed paths and that usually ended with someone getting punched.
“Tony?” Steve went to check his pulse but the brunet stopped him and finally looked him in the eye. The look was so serious it made a chill run up his spine; it was a look Steve had only seen once or twice.
He could hear Steve’s footsteps behind him. Tony’s life was about to end. He didn’t know how he would survive without him. What was he going to-
This wasn't supposed to happen; it was a typical infiltration mission into a HYDRA base but it went wrong from the very start. The Avengers were planning on taking them by surprise but it was if the enemy was prepared for them. They didn't stand a chance.
“Of course Peter. Goodnight and I hope you have sweet dreams.” Steve smiled sweetly as Tony picked up their tired son.
“Tony? Tony! Hey wake up! Tony!” He quickly removed the face plate to check if Tony was still breathing and found it empty, causing a moment of confusion before it set in as full on panic.
“Tony, I’m going to take this off. Try to stay as still as you can, ok?” He got no response, just him staring off into the distance. As gently as he could, Steve pushed the release and lifted the metal off Tony, catching one or two snags in the process but Tony didn't even wince.
“Steve?” Tony was kneeling a few feet away from Steve and he had opened his faceplate. “I’m going to fly out there to get a better shot, when I do I want you to r-”
“Papa?” Peter didn't take his eyes off Steve for even a millisecond. After looking at Peter’s bloodshot eyes, puffy face, and overall weary appearance, Steve pieced together what had happened and spoke in his signature soothing tone,
Peter was sitting at the kitchen counter with a half-eaten bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream in front of him. He didn't seem to notice Tony come in, just continued staring into his ice cream with bloodshot eyes and hugged his arms close to his chest. It wasn't until Tony tapped him on the shoulder that the 7-year-old realized he wasn't alone.
“Of course Sir.” With a whirring of servos the suit came to life and the monitors blazed to life with its camera and HUD.
“If you don’t tell Steve, I will. He has a right to know. Nat will figure it out on her own, I’d be surprised if she didn't know already. As for the rest of them, the worst they’ll do is become over excited. You know how much Clint and Thor like kids.” Tony remembered how puppy like those two had behaved the last time they visited a children's hospital for charity. He was surprised just how much Thor smiled and laughed for a 6 ft god of thunder.
After several excruciating minutes of half-sprinting Steve and Tony finally reached the exit and went outside, the setting sun making the sky glow an appropriate blood-red. God must've been on their side because once they reached the end of the compound they were able to throw the HYDRA agents off their trail, not forever but long enough that Steve could look at Tony’s injuries.
“Oh and no more coffee. Caffeine can be harmful. And I know you don't drink anymore but avoid alcohol as well.”
“Everything ok? Have you slept recently?” He was speaking softly as if to keep from scaring Tony off. That soft, sweet, tone only made it harder for Tony to stay awake. He mumbled something incoherently, now leaning into the side of his chair which translated into leaning into Steve.
When he had switched from the Captain America uniform to Captain America sweatpants, he joined Tony in the bed and he resumed his position as a baby koala by snuggling up to Steve’s’ chest. He smiled and kissed his boyfriend’s forehead, holding him close while he drifted off to sleep.
“Well, while you figure out how to tell him you should start on some vitamins. Folic acid is incredibly important for preventing defects.”
“You can use the remote control suit, for all intent and purposes you’re still out on the field but there’s less danger. Stress will still be a factor so just keep that in mind.”  Tony nodded, beginning to feel the weight of what this meant.
"I’ll be fine, my suit’s stronger than yours.” Steve still didn't like it. He had lost friends like this in the war years ago and he wasn't prepared for that to happen to Tony. He couldn't lose him before he told him…
“Are you gonna be ok Tony?” He asked, keeping his voice low. Tony was silent for a moment, staring back down at the pregnancy test. As excited as he was, this was all happening so fast. He had hoped if he and Steve ever started a family it would be after years of peace and tranquility, after the Avengers were no longer needed and someone else could save the world from assholes.
Just as it looked like he was making headway he heard the sounds of shouting and the rumbling of car engines; HYDRA had decided to show their ugly heads again. Tony’s internal injuries were severe enough that he should not be moved but he couldn't be saved by a dead man.
He had gone to Bruce as soon as he took the test and his science bro had brought him to the medical ward just to check on everything. Regardless if either of them wanted parenthood the last thing Tony wanted was to hurt their baby with his terrible life habits.
“And Tony,” Bruce took a deep breath, “it might be best for the both of you to sit out from missions.”
“We’re not getting out with them waiting up there, but I can't get a good shot from here. Got any ideas Cap?” Steve noticed the panic in his voice, layered under his typical cockiness but he knew the engineer well enough to see right through it. It was very unlikely that they’d all make it out unharmed, Steve just hoped nobody would be killed.
“Night-night Papa,” Peter mumbled as he desperately tried to keep his eyes open. Tony ended the call before heading back upstairs to Peter’s bedroom. He was pretty much asleep by the time that Tony had put him into bed. He tucked his boy in and kissed him goodnight but before he left a tiny voice asked,
“Are you feeling alright Tony? I know you said you weren't sick but maybe we should check in with Bruce just to make sure.” Tony noticeably stiffened when Steve mentioned going to Bruce, which he tried to make it seem like he didn't see. There was something definitely going on but he didn't want to push the topic on Tony when he was ill. He took the bin in his hands, holding it away from his nose, and said,
“Yeah yeah, my suit’s down here. I’ll meet you up there.” Tony replied, not meeting Steve’s eyes. He was waiting for him to leave to set up the remote suit.
“Yes.” Steve was incredibly gentle, not wanting to hurt Tony, but he was counting down the days until he could use Tony’s mouth to its full potential. For now, they were simply cementing their feelings for one another with light touches and warmth.
“It was so scary,” Peter mumbled through his tears. He was trying to control his breathing as Tony had done earlier but his voice was still coming out in short squeaky bursts.
He sat there for hours, which Clint or Nat could have taken his spot but they let him stay there, and he didn't even notice that the better part of a day had passed until he could see the golden-red rays of a sunset seep through the cheap hospital blinds. He didn't worry about sleep, just his Tony.
It was over as soon as it started, which Tony was grateful for since he was now tired pretty much all the time. Napping all day wasn't exactly a luxury he could afford.
Steve still didn’t know. Tony had tried once or twice but the dark recesses of his mind convinced him that everything would go wrong the second he opened his mouth. However, Steve wasn’t an idiot. He noticed how often Tony excused himself to the restroom, how he was eating at every meal, and most shockingly, he noticed that Tony had gone days without coffee. He didn't even know that was possible.
Luckily he was blessed with another miracle. Steve heard the familiar whirring of a SHIELD quinjet and when he looked up there was a battered and bruised Natasha looking down at him. She saw the unconscious Tony in his arms and ordered the pilot to lower the jet, not wasting any time.
As he turned down the hallway he saw that the kitchen light was on. Nobody else was in the compound but he and Peter; Steve was out on the mission with Nat and Clint, Rhodey was busy overseas with PR bs, and Thor was up in Asgard doing who knows what, so there was only one possibility.
“May I kiss you?” Tony was not expecting Steve to ask for permission, if he hadn't just dodged death he would have died of embarrassment right then and there. He was so shook that he forgot to give Steve an answer. The poor guy was just standing there with intense eyes, looking at him in a way he had never experienced.
Tony was taken into emergency surgery the second they reached the nearest hospital, Steve tried to block out the dire words of the staff as they rushed him down the hallway but he couldn’t ignore it all. Once they had taken Tony away he began to cry, not caring that Nat and Clint were there. He let all of his emotions out instead of keeping them inside until he exploded. Time blended together until Steve was out of tears and his throat was raw. He didn't notice the surgeon standing in front of him until Nat tapped on his back.
“Jesus Christ Steve, stop being so damn chivalrous and think of self-preservation for once in your life. If they find you they will shoot you and then we’ll both die.” He raised his voice which caused him to cough violently, blood spurting out of his chest and mouth. 	Steve opened the small first aid kit he lept in his uniform, which was not equipped to handle this situation, and pressed down on the largest wound on Tony’s chest, which was just to the left of the arc reactor. Air entered and exited the hole as Tony breathed, which meant that it had torn through to his lung, as he had said. Within a few seconds, the bandage was soaked through but he kept holding it there because he was not letting Tony die like this.
“And how do you suggest I do that? If I just suddenly refuse to go out people are going to get suspicious. Correction, Ross will get suspicious. There's no telling what that bastard will do.” The secretary of State had been a thorn in the Avengers’ sides since the beginning but he seemed to have a particular beef with Tony, using every opportunity to drag him through the mud. Tony and Steve’s relationship wasn't even out ot the public; the news of him having a child out of wedlock with another man would definitely cause an uproar. Steve had said that he wasn't afraid of the public and that nothing would stop him from loving Tony, homophobia be damned.
“Sorry Dad, I uh, I thought-” Tony didn't let him finish before wrapping his son in his arms, holding him tight until the boy began to cry again.  He grabbed Tony’s shirt and buried his face in it, sobbing so hard that his entire body shook with every breath.
Steve tried ordering a retreat but they were too scattered and frazzled to respond. The only person that was by him was Tony, who was trying his best to regain control of the situation. He fired repulsor blasts in the direction of the HYDRA agents who were shooting at them but didn't hit anybody, much to his dismay.
He knew that wasn’t it, since it wouldn’t explain why Tony wasn't drinking coffee, but it still got him thinking, did he want Tony to propose? That’s immediately where his mind went when he thought that Tony was going to surprise him so maybe he was subconsciously thinking about it already. Steve had thought of marrige, he had a ring hidden in his room that he had bought for Tony specifically, but he never felt the time was right. He was afraid if he pressed too soon, Tony would close up like a clam and never open to Steve again. That would be heartbreaking.
Tony began trying to pass it off as battle fatigue but his mind was numb from exhaustion so it came out as gibberish. Oh well, he thought, at least he won’t freak out when I fall asleep. So he closed his eyes and let himself succumb to sleep.
Steve took his hand, rubbing his thumb on the cold metal, and then his eyes drifted to Tony’s abdomen. He noticed his gaze and said,
After a few minutes in his ‘happy place’, Tony regained enough strength to stand up and begin walking to the kitchen to get some coffee, accepting that he wasn't going to get any more sleep that night.
“Shh. Petey its ok.” Tony whispered soothingly. “Your Papa is just fine. He’s Captain America remember? Nothing can beat Captain America.” Peter whined and buried his face deeper in Tony’s shoulder. The little boy still hasn't stopped shaking. Poor thing. At this rate, he’d be crying all night long.
Tony must've known Steve would never agree to his plan so instead of waiting for a response, he closed his faceplate and flew up into the air and began firing. Steve heard gunshots and the sounds of bullets against metal before Tony yelled,
“I’ll get this cleaned up, you go back to bed. I don't want you falling over on me again.” He didn't wait for an answer and walked out the door to the nearest bathroom to wash the bin out. Once he was finished he asked JARVIS,
“You’ll be ok.” He whispered, not knowing who he was trying to convince, “You’ll be ok.” Steve pressed another bandage to his wounds, trying to do anything to save his new love.
“Are you still at the compound?” The answer he got was just another string of very sleepy mindless gibberish. At least he knew it was Tony being sleepy; he had dealt with that type of Tony several times during the time they had known each other. He suspected Tony had been working late nights again under the table doing some project again.
