It’s sorta punk and sorta pop and Cas keeps looking at him when he sweeps the crowd and for the first time in his life Dean understands why girls pass out when they see their favorite band, because he knows he’s not breathing, he knows that he won’t breathe until this song is over.  It doesn’t matter that he had heard the hook, heard snippets of the lyrics, heard the song from underneath the living room floor, he felt like one of the fans screaming for Cas in that moment, like he was about to thoroughly embarrass himself in front of his friends and his brother if he didn’t get ahold of himself ASAP.
“Oh come on, you can do better than that.  If we’re going to be seeing more of each other, I want to know more about you.”
They listen to Zeppelin the whole way, and Dean can stop smiling when Cas starts singing loudly off-key, hand hanging out of the window, despite the chill of winter still hanging in the early March air.
“I like that,” he says quietly as they work on toning his hair, which Dean has noticed curls when it gets wet.
Needless to say, their latest plot to stop the hundreds of ghosts Chuck had released into the world had not gone so well.  Rowena had tried everything; some of the most powerful magic in the known Universe, but in they had burst, hundreds of them, while Sam, Dean, Cas tried their best to take out as many as they could, there’s only so much three of them can do.  Rowena was weak from the spell and it’s not like Belphegor was chomping at the bit to help, so they had fought their way to the Impala and booked it out of there.
“C’mon Charlie,” Dean looks over at her, she’s not gonna let this go, “I just…I don’t know, he’s a little too Upper East Side for my Brooklyn ass.”
“Dean,” it’s more of a moan than a response, and Dean shuts his brain off again, refusing to think of the people walking by, the people inside his warm apartment, he only thinks about Cas’ lips and his hands and his warm skin, the skin on his ribs still raised with his new tattoo.
“Her name’s Sarah, she was very nice and I got her number.  Now seriously, what was going on with you and that guy?  You were basically nose to nose with him when we walked up.”
“What’re you making, then?” Cas looks at the list with interest, trying to read it upside down before Dean pulls it back towards himself.
“You raised him, it’s understandable,” Cas’ hand reaches for Dean’s and Dean takes it automatically, feeling the tightness in his chest ease at the feel of Cas’ strong, warm hand in his.  He still wasn’t used to it, wasn’t used to having Cas to wake up to in the morning, having Cas hold him at night, having someone that understood him so fully, inside and out.
The walk back to Dean’s apartment is peaceful, even though they’re weighed down by thirty pounds of food in the canvas bags that Sam makes Dean carry with him when he goes grocery shopping, save the planet and all that jazz.  Dean’s putting off the inevitable goodbye to Cas as it inches closer, the seconds ticking towards his flight time and making Dean resent his favorite holiday a little bit.
Sam looks up at him, and he’s so clearly furious that it takes Dean aback, he is not used to seeing him that angry, especially not seemingly directed towards him.
“Don’t you feel like you’re being watched when you have one of those in your house?” Dean asks as some pop-y song he doesn’t recognize plays on the surround sound speakers, bright and energetic.
Dean laughed.  It took years off his face.  He took the hat in his hands and put it on his head.  It was a little too long for him, it almost covered his eyes, but he had a silly grin on his face and Cas couldn’t get enough of it.
“What’s up Sam?” Dean lifts himself off the couch to get a look at him, Sam still says nothing.  Are you fucking kidding?  Dean just wants to know ten seconds of peace, why is everyone in his life making that absolutely impossible?
Bobby made an appearance at the smell of food and the three of them share a meal for the first time in what felt like months.  Of course, Dean ruins the fragile air of peace with,
Dean considers her, thinking about how he would even go about fixing this shattered fucking mess of his own design.
Dean feels like he’s run a marathon after Charlie leaves, but he doesn’t want to face Benny or Sam when they get home, so he shuts himself in his room for the rest of the evening, trying desperately to think about himself, and not the blue-eyed guy across town who he may have just irrevocably fucked things up with.
Dean finds himself at Cas’ door at two thirty in the morning, trying to hide the fact that he’s been crying, not that he can hide that from Cas, that had always been next to impossible.  Cas has clearly been asleep, his bright purple hair was sticking straight up in the air, he rubs his eyes, and is in that pair of ratty sweatpants that meant he didn’t give a single fuck how he looked.
“Did I say that?  You’re acting like a child and I don’t want to stay if this is how the evening is going to go.”
Dean and Sam head towards the nearest subway station, ignoring the bustling city around them, filled with people weaving in and out of the pavements, heels and boots clicking and thumping on the damp concrete, the sound of sirens and of car horns loud in their ears.  Dean loves New York at night, he loves it even though it smells predominately like garbage and piss, and you were more than likely going to see one fight on the street before the night was over.  It was one of those cities that you only had to visit once to know how you felt about it.  Some people would visit once and then say “never again.”  Too big for them, too loud, too dirty, too dangerous.  But Dean’s first visit had only made him fall in love, and he loved every part of this huge, sprawling concrete jungle.
When I started this, I thought it was going to be, at most, 30,000 words.  I didn't think I had something much longer in me, and I was okay with that.  But something about this Cas and this Dean really grabbed me, and here we are, 80,000 words later.
“Need I remind you that we have one chance to make a good impression on Eileen?  This is no time to burn the vegetables, Sam.”
“Like I said, you left the gallery opening and the bar before we could finish our conversations, and I-”
Cas has his arms crossed now, staring at Dean from across the kitchen.  Dean finds himself leaning against the counter, holding onto it for dear life, because he had to be able to hold onto something, since he was being thrown back and forth by the waves of the roiling water that was his life.
He tries, unsuccessfully, to sidle quietly into his room, but no such luck.  Cas is the only one who seems to immediately pick up on his mood, and watches him from his perch on the armrest of the couch.  Charlie and Sam jump up and immediately start chattering away at him.  Dean puts on the best smile he can muster, trying to make his excuses for his room, but they won’t let up, and Lisa’s words and the anger bubble over, misdirected at them because he doesn’t have anyone else to snap at.
“Yeah but they say that to everyone.  It’s a job interview.  I don’t know, how do I tell if they liked me.”
Dean insisted that Cas “take it slow” when he was out of his cast.  Dean took him for “target practice” in the forest, and while Cas initially thought this was a ploy to get them both laid, it turned out it was actually target practice.  A lot less exciting.
“You look like you’ve been walking on the moon for the last three hours,” Charlie says, looking Dean up and down as he bounces into the shop.  Even though it’s his day off he has to see someone, and Sam had been gone when he got to the house.
All he gets in return is a middle finger emoji, and he has to push down that little kernel of fear he sometimes gets when Cas is just a little too perfect in every possible way.  The inadequacy, he thinks it’s called, sometimes worms its way into his mind, even though Cas does nothing to warrant it, and Dean always feels second best when it comes to him, mostly due to the fact that Cas could probably stack his wealth all the way to the International Space Station if he chose to, and Dean’s got a nice car and a good shop, but his stack might only reach his knees if he was lucky.
“Eileen Leahy.  She’s actually in law school at Columbia.  She’s so smart and so funny and she’s teaching me sign language too.”
“Are you trying to ditch me?” Dean asks in his ear, and Cas’ laugh vibrates through his chest as he leans back into Dean.
They walk to the train station, still hand in hand, and when they part ways, they kiss for a little too long, so that Dean can feel the stares of the people walking around them to their respective platforms.
There was the kiss after they had had sex for the first time, the one that was sweet and gentle and languid, like molasses on his tongue.  He was tracking the notches of Cas’ spine while Cas’ hands ran down his arms.
Woof I am STILL not over last night's episode so here's some AU nonsense to brighten everyone's day.  As always, I'd love to know what you guys think! <3
Dean throws his little mixing spoon at her, which he regrets immediately when she runs out of the room with it.  He needed that.
“Ugh,” Dean sighs, heaving himself up and sidling up to the fridge, assessing what they still had.  Saturdays were his grocery run days, so by Thursday Charlie had usually cleared them out of any and all snacks, swearing up and down she only took her fair share, but they all knew that was total bullshit, “How’s mac n cheese sound?”
Dean slumped in the corner, blood dripping down his hands.  Cas had no idea, no idea how to help him.  So he settled for sinking onto the floor next to him, pulling
“You better get laid for all this, this menu looks more complicated than a college band’s marching pattern,” Charlie pipes up, looking over his shoulder as he triple checks his list.
As they pulled out of Camp Chitaqua, Cas watched past Dean out of the corner of his eye.  He wondered how different he looked to him, how much he had really changed in five years.  As they pulled onto the highway, Cas pulled out his trusty bottle and popped two more pills.  Dean stared at him, clearly alarmed.  There was so much he didn’t know.
Right as he’s composing his “sorry something came up I can’t make it” text, Charlie texts him, knowing him better than he knows himself.
Dean does his best to not look at Castiel, and the animated way he moves his hands, easily wrapping the rich upper crust of New York around his ridiculously delicate fingers, making them laugh, laughing at their jokes in return, but not, Dean notices, the way that he laughed with Dean.  These laughs were for business, putting the people at ease, more willing to pull out their wallets for a painting that would hang in their front rooms, never to really be studied again.  A piece to brag about, not to look at.
Dean is a lot of things.  He’s broken, he’s fucked up, he’s a kickass tattoo artist, a great cook, a good brother, a (hopefully) good friend.  He’s funny and loves bad movies, and he has a family he loves, and that, right now, is enough to pull him out of the shitty chasm of The Breakup.  That’s enough.
“So how was today?” Cas is staring at Dean over the rim of his beer, tapping the head of the bottle lightly against the metal rings on the left side of his lower lip, making a tiny clinking sound.
The second time he woke from this non-nightmare, it’s like he can feel a presence in the room with him, but by the time he flicks on the lamp by his bed, there’s only an empty room.  He must have been imagining things.
She bounces a little, indicating she’s ready, and it doesn’t take long but Dean’s release is almost a little tainted, like a bad aftertaste is left in his mouth.  Lisa cleans up and comes back to bed and Dean lays there, waiting for the inevitable argument that he can feel is brewing.  Lisa lays, splayed across his chest, tracing patterns into his skin and Dean braces for impact.
“You were right.  I’m too much of a pushover when it comes to my siblings, and I didn’t want to hear it when you called me on it.  Like, I was jealous of the family that you had because it was so easy…and you know, mine’s never easy, it’s always like sort of dodging bullets.  And I have friends, but nothing like what you and Sam have, nothing like what you and Charlie have.  And here comes this gorgeous guy, and he’s got this amazing heart and he doesn’t think he deserves it?  Deserves me?  With my shitty family and a job that’s my whole life.  It pissed me off, if I’m being honest.  And I’m sorry that I wasn’t before.”
“Okay can one of you help me with my zipper?  I just put it in last night and now it’s not zipping even though I literally tested it like fifty times and I know I didn’t do it wrong but-”
“It does look better in the day,” Castiel says, hanging up his coat in a hall closet and heading over to the white marble-covered kitchen to where a sleek coffee pot was sitting in the corner.
They walk from Cas’ place to the restaurant, which only takes reservations and is covered in those fancy twinkling string lights.  The hostess leads Cas and Dean, who’s back in that purple suit that Cas liked so much he ended up just buying for him, to a long wooden table in the back, lit with candles and soft overhead light.  Set for seven, which is a weird and awkward number for a dinner party.  Dean’s palms are already sweating.
“You make it sound so nefarious,” Cas laughs, “The gallery is doing well, and I’m working on a charity auction that’s taking up a lot of my time.”
“And I wanted to say that even though I think that you’re pill popping crap needs to stop, I’m sorry about saying I can’t trust you.  Hell, you’re the only one I really can trust.”
“My siblings, well, my oldest brother is throwing a party at his home in Westchester next weekend, and I was wondering if you’d like to come with me.”
Cas watched Dean, he couldn’t see his face, but he could tell by the set in his shoulders what his answer would be.
He takes one step towards them, when he hears the back door of the house creak open.  He whips around, hand going to the gun that likely doesn’t fire anymore, only to have the air taken out of his lungs.
Dean insists on buying the beer when they get to the blessedly warm convenience store down the block from the hotel, though his face was still a little warm from Cas’ words.  Cas doesn’t put up too much of a fight, and keeps smiling at Dean in a way that makes Dean feel like he’s consumed a fifth of whiskey.  His fingers are all tingly.
Lisa is waiting for him even though he’s fifteen minutes early.  He feels like she might be timing him, but again, it’s to be expected.  She looks stunning, in a light green dress that hugs her figure in all the right ways, and Dean is relatively sure he might be drooling as they head downtown, Dean parking right near the water, and helping Lisa out of the car.
Dean always looked a little sheepish when he handed Cas a new book, like he was embarrassed to show Cas this part of himself.
At around three, they drift off to their respective rooms, Dean filling up another huge glass of water to take to Cas, grabbing some aspirin and a bottle of Gatorade on his way for good measure.  Cas was a little bitch when he was this hungover, Dean knew the routine.
Dean buried the knife in the demon’s throat and then turned towards Cas with murder in his eyes.  Cas saw Yaeger slip out the door.  Yeah, this wasn’t going to be a fight that he wanted to see.
“How did you learn to cook like this?  You told me you moved around a lot and my brother isn’t even this good of a cook, and he started in our parent’s kitchen when he was three years old.”
Okay FIRST AND FOREMOST we need to talk about this truly stunningly beautiful header made by @protectyourdarlings, it is literally so beyond amazing I can’t even believe it (as in I can’t look at it for too long or I start crying), thank you SO SO SO SO much and everyone should go follow right now immediately thanks,
He didn’t say anything, because he knew better than anybody that no one else can talk the self-hatred out of you, you have to do it yourself.  So he settled for simply taking Dean’s and putting his head on his shoulder, sliding the whiskey bottle away from him for good measure.
“You’re good, it looks great so far.  I’ll let you know, though, that the shading is a lot of black, so it’ll be a little more intense.  You sure you don’t need anything?”
“Then why did we keep doing it?  Why have we been doing it for nine years?  Why did you spend the whole weekend at my house when you broke up with Lisa?  If you’re so afraid that I was going to turn you gay, then why did you come seek me out at 2 am when she broke up with you.  Why am I the person that you come to with every problem, why did you kiss me on New Year’s, when both of us were single?  Why did we fuck in your bedroom during a party, when again, both of us were single.  Why did you tell me you loved me?  Do you want me to say I won’t see you again?  Are you trying to push me away?  Like, what the fuck Dean, don’t you think I know you better than that, I can see what you’re doing, I know it’s a lie.”
“Shut up.  This is it, I’m going to die.  I had a good run, but my stomach’s going to explode and I’ll be plastered all over the walls.”
“This…did you-” he’s stuttering, unable to find the words because Cas didn’t seem to get that this was a big fucking deal.
“For not coming to see me down here for almost two months,” Ellen stands defiant when he reappears, hair damp from the gross bar rag.  He knows better than to try to defend himself.  He can tell Benny is laughing out of the corner of his eye.
Cas holds his mouth like he wants to say something, but seems to visibly swallow his own words with a mouthful of eggs and sausage.
Sam stays with Eileen.  The apartment is lonely, so Dean is left to drown in the thoughts of his inadequacy, going back and forth.  Sometimes, he thought it was better like this, Cas didn’t need to know why he was so damn broken beyond repair, why he didn’t deserve someone like Cas, why Cas was far far better off without him.  And then, sometimes, usually when he was trying to sleep, Dean was hit over and over with the realization that the one solid and steady relationship he had ever had in his life was over and it was his fault…again.
Look, it’s not like he’s not grateful to be here, it’s certainly better than the alternative, he shivers a little at the thought, but trapped in his memories?  Ugh.
“Okay, this looks pretty great,” Charlie says, bending over the basket to look inside, “Is that pimento cheese?  Fuck I love you Dean.”
It's hard and fast, Dean scrambles for the condoms and the lube he keeps in his bedside table, even though he hasn’t brought anyone home in years.  Maybe it was just wishful thinking that this would happen.
“Hey,” the relief in Cas’ voice is palpable, bleeding through the phone lines, “Thanks for picking up, I know it’s late.  Uh, so I have a problem.”
“And anyway,” Benny continues, picking up his bag, “Someone’s gotta keep Sam entertained for the night, and god knows you and Charlie are going to try and drink each other under the table.”
Sam looks a little small there, eyes a little downcast, and so Charlie and Dean converge on him immediately, Charlie immediately wrapping Sam in a hug, Dean clapping his shoulders.
“Dude,” she yells, clambering into her usual place in the middle of the backseat, “I am so pumped to see this movie.  Me and Benny have been talking about it for weeks.”
“She’s gonna love it.  She’s gonna love you, who wouldn’t?  And since when are you messing everything up?  That doesn’t sound like you.”
“They’re gonna use all of humanity as a pawn to get me to say yes to half the world getting torched?”
“I mean, yeah.  She’s good for me.  She has a steady job, nice house, good kid.  Sam and Ben get along great.  She’s gorgeous, nice.  You know, exactly what everyone wants.”
Dean turns towards Cas, incredulous.  He looks completely stunning, still all pink from the last go round, sweat beading his forehead, but Dean is too stressed to think about anything but that this is the last way that he wants Sam to meet Cas.
Dean likes to pretend he’s a confident guy, but he’s gotta admit, the second that he looks up at Castiel’s high-rise on Park Avenue, he really feels like running the other direction.  Castiel seems to know what he’s thinking, because he takes Dean’s hand again and pulls him inside.
“Oh he told me about using humanity as your bargaining chip.  I’m still not buying what you’re selling.”
Cas felt, rather than saw Dean at his shoulder.  They watched the people in the yard in silence, neither one willing to break the silence.
“As if you actually have renter’s insurance.  We’re all fucked if this place goes up in flames, especially so because Ellen will literally eat us all alive and Sam will have to live with her and Jo and he’s not ready to live with someone like Jo.  It’s lose lose really.”
He’s not sure how long it takes from them to all break apart, and when they do, he’s not the only one that’s wiping his eyes on the back of his hands.
Dean wants to ask, but then he knew he’s be asked about what he had done to get here, and admitting to someone what he had had to do to survive was not in the cars for the next…forever if he had anything to say about it.
Dean has stripped off the hideous Christmas sweater that Sam had given him after his second glass of whiskey.  His cheeks felt flushed and warm, and he wanted an excuse to press his skin against Cas’ arm.  You know, in a totally platonic, non-weird way.
Eventually, at around 4am, he collapses onto the wet and filthy sidewalk, his feet too sluggish to carry him forward anymore.  The metal grate would normally have dug into his back, but he was so tired…he even felt warm, which was probably a bad sign at twenty below, but he didn’t care.  He didn’t want to have to care anymore.  He remembers slipping into unconsciousness, his one thought that he hoped Sammy never had to see him like this.
Cas lets Dean get back into the swing of things before they try again.  Life goes back to normal.  They go back to not fighting (unless you count who gets to buy the next dinner date or what movie they’re going to not watch before they start fucking on Cas’ couch), they hang out with Sam and Eileen and Charlie and Pamela, Cas spends more and more nights at Dean’s apartment, so much that the bed smells like him and Dean misses him whenever he’s gone.  But the subject of an actual dinner is broached several weeks later, right when Dean is going down on Cas in Cas’ bedroom in the middle of the day.  It’s pretty cool to fuck with the curtains open, he’s never gotten used to that.
The venue was a nice bar with a good amount of seating around an honest to god stage.  Sam gets the customary “x’s” on the back of his hands, and Dean swears up and down he’s his legal guardian and he’ll keep an eye on him.  What the bouncer doesn’t know is that Sam is very boring and has no interest in drinking anything other than lemonade all night.  The first band of the night is already setting up, and they grab seats right near the front before anyone else can.  Jo gets herself and Dean a couple of beers and they just kinda quietly people-watch for a while as the space fills up with chatter and the clinking of glasses and scraping of chairs.
Dean whined loudly as Cas continued his ministrations, lightly ghosting the outline of Dean’s cock through his jeans.  Dean wanted him.  Fuck, he wanted him.  When he kissed him he tasted metal, almost forgetting that Cas had a triple lip piercing in the excitement of the moment.
“Oh hell yeah,” Benny slings himself back to reach for his phone on their little table, immediately beginning their order, “Everyone want their usual?”
Cas lifts his head, mouth slick with spit and precum, and he smiles this feral smile at Dean that was almost enough alone to push Dean over the edge.
The shop stays busy, and Dean doesn’t have all that much time to let Charlie’s words eat away at his carefully crafted walls, built in a hot Oklahoma parking lot and a brutal Chicago winter, but when he does have a spare moment, he lets them, like antibodies destroying a virus, take them down, brick by brick, layer by layer, until maybe he feels a little bit freer, a little bit more deserving of the good things in his life.  He doesn’t reach out to Cas, even though he wants nothing more than to show him his growth; it would feel disingenuous, like he was fishing for praise, and he just kinda sits back for a while and hopes, in the dead of night, that maybe, by some miracle, this city would bring them back together again, and Dean would have the chance to prove himself.
“But when is the other shoe gonna drop, huh?  When is he going to realize that I am not meant to be over there on Park Avenue with him and that I’m a fuckup dropout with a past that I never talk about, and run in the other direction?”
“I’m sorry it took me til now to say it.  Cas, I’m so sorry.  Man, I hope you can hear me.  I hope you can hear me.”
“I thought I could catch you there, Charlie told me about the show.  There was too much security.  Listen-”
The rest of the day is mostly quiet, but they get a couple of walk ins and book a few more appointments.  Some dude stumbles in for a consultation with Dean who is so hammered that Dean’s surprised he can even see straight, and they have to escort him out, hearing drunken promises that he’ll be back when he’s sober and “ready to go.”  By the time it hits eight o’clock, Dean convinces Pamela to do a little piece on his left arm, because he was itching for ink and that was one of the benefits to working in a tattoo studio with some of your best friends.  He decides on a delicate blue rose, for a couple of reasons.  One, because he loves roses, proven by his neck piece that nearly reaches his jawline, a classic old school piece, red and green and dark black lines, done by Lee in Chicago several years before.  And two, because he had a little bit of an obsession with Tennessee Williams’
Born out of one of Cas’ failed relationships, the agreement had been born: if one of them went through a breakup, whether that was with a long-standing friend with benefits or an actual partner, they would take the weekend and fuck, a way to release, to move on without the stress of a unknown hookup.  The only rule was that they both had to be single, because cheaters they were not.  It worked for them, a surefire way to not catch feelings.
He’s used to it now, the stinging pain of the night air on the open wound on his arm, the warm trickles of blood turning cool as they hit the air.  He had been hurt in the last eleven years more than he had in the last ten thousand, but that was just a part of being a Winchester he supposed.
“Cas,” there was a warning in her tone, but Cas was way past worrying about a bullet wound.  He forced open the door and saw just the thing that he had been dreading.  Dean was standing over a demon strapped to a chair.  On a table was holy water, salt, the knife, everything that could make a demon talk in the worst way.  Dean and Yaeger stood up when Cas entered the room.  The demon started to laugh, blood running out of its mouth.
“Mmm,” Dean hums, burying his nose in Cas’s dark hair, which smells like sweat and come and the expensive shampoo Cas buys, “good to be back.  I miss anything?”
“You can tell Anna to fuck off.  She has a lot of nerve to tell me that, when she exclusively dates men who are one medical emergency from the fucking morgue.”
“Yeah, she’s deaf, so she’s teaching me some basics and I picked up this online course a couple weeks back because I don’t want to spend all our time with her teaching me, you know?” Sam pauses, a smile spreading across his face, “I really really like her, and I want you guys to meet her, but I don’t want to rush into anything, so maybe in a couple of weeks if that’s okay.  Like thanksgiving maybe?”
“You talk to Sam?” Cas asks the second that Dean walks into his house, setting down his bag by the door and toeing off his shoes.  The TV is on playing Dean’s favorite shitty TV show, and Cas is walking towards him with his favorite beer.  He’s fucking lucky to have Cas sometimes.
“Need I remind you that I used to be one of the most powerful beings in existence?  That I could have snapped you in half with a look?”
He stayed where he was, gripping the edge of the table, his knuckles turning white and his fingers going numb from lack of circulation. He wanted that numbness to spread all over his body, calm his aching beating heart. He was still so angry. Angry at Cas, at Chuck, at Belphegor, at Rowena, at Sam, at Mary, at John, at the whole goddamn world for making him the one that had to save everyone, that Chuck had dictated every single second of his life and made him fall so in love with a stupid angel with his black hair and his blue eyes and his broken wings.
“Hey brother, don’t need you losing it too,” Benny puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder, and Dean realizes that he’s shifting his weight from foot to foot, swaying almost violently as the train snakes through the underbelly of Manhattan.
Dean rolls his eyes, smiling in spite of the fact that his heart still felt like it was going to fall out of his body at any second.
Charlie sticks her tongue out at Dean, and no one seems to notice that Cas’ hands linger around Dean’s hips when he slides past him to join the group on the couch, all loudly asking Sam about his date with a girl named Jessica, who went to school in the next town over.
“Hell yeah kid, let’s do it,” Benny’s grin is infectious.  Dean breathes an invisible sigh of relief, Sam would be taken care of.  He knows he shouldn’t worry, but Cas is right, he’s a mother hen.
“Dude, that movie rocks.  Plus the main guy’s name is Linguini and who doesn’t want to be named after pasta.”
He’s still scared shitless.  He knows he’ll still worry about everything he can’t control.  But with this family, with Sam and Charlie and Benny and Ellen and Jo and Ash and Pamela.  With Cas.  He feels like that fear is less consuming, and more something that he can overcome.
He grins at Dean as he comes around the corner and Sam looks at him with concern written all over his face.
Dean looked down at the hand-drawn diagrams and maps to get the Colt.  The silence stretched for what felt like hours, but then Dean looked up at him and said,
They’re quiet for the rest of the car ride, and Dean parks in the spot that Cas has reserved in his building, always empty unless Dean decides to take him out on a date in the Impala.  Cas immediately unbuckles his seatbelt when Dean puts the car in park, and tries to make a sprint for the elevator out of the garage, but if Dean had learned anything from Bobby Singer, it was to never go to bed angry, no matter how angry you are.  He hadn’t really taken it to heart until now.
Dean swears he’s still hungover the next week when it’s cold outside but the landlord had kicked the heater up way too high, and Dean’s pretty much sweating in just his t-shirt, he finds himself in an empty shop for most of the night.  It’s not super surprising, it is a Wednesday night on a random day in November, it’s not like it was a popular day for people to walk in and get tattooed, and his appointments had all been earlier.
Thanksgiving approaches too quickly, and Dean is trying to plan a menu that not only accommodates Sam and Charlie’s allergies, but is good enough to impress Eileen, the girl that Sam talks about almost as much as Dean talks about Cas.  He wheedles Sam until he tells him exactly what her favorite kind of pie is, what kind of vegetables she likes best, whether she wants homemade cranberry sauce or canned.  He drags Cas along for his extended grocery shopping trip the Sunday before thanksgiving, and Cas distracts him when he gets into an anxiety hole, something Dean is eternally grateful for.
Cas and Risa exchanged a worried look, at least he knew he wasn’t the only one who didn’t like this.
Dean’s eyes snapped up to him.  Green as the grass outside.  Humans really were amazing, billions of different shapes, sizes, colors, and minds.  And eyes.  Green had always been his favorite, though he wasn’t sure why.  Dean’s tongue ran across his teeth.
“You’re the only person I would tolerate vanilla sex from, Dean, but by all means if you want to get kinky I can get kinky.”
“Cas and I had a fight,” he says evasively, hoping against hope that she’ll let him off with a half-truth.  No such luck.
“Are there any other types of breakup except bad?  I’m just glad you told me, I was worried it had something to do with me.”
The name seems wrong for Cas, and Dean looks around instinctively for him and sees him in the corner with some tall dude.  He remembers, dimly, that Cas had mentioned that there would be some of his old high school and college friends at this thing, but that does nothing to stem the mixture of panic, anger, and fear that floods Dean when he sees them standing together.
“Great,” Risa said, staring angrily at Dean, her voice dripping sarcasm, “Have we got anything that can
Dean was standing on the porch, breathing lungfuls of cold air.  Cas tried it.  It stung his lungs and made his chest ache.  He liked it a little.  There’d been a recent dusting of snow, it covered the rusted out cars with perfect white powder, not cocaine, as Dean had thought when Cas had put this into words once.
But Dean is gentle when he continues, cleaning the blood away.  It takes them three songs to get through the cleaning.  “Black Dog” and “Bring it on Home” follow “When the Levee Breaks, and Dean hums as he threads his needle and starts carefully sewing Cas up.  Neat and identical stitches, like a line of soldiers.
Cas grabbed Dean by the collar, he knew that he would make a break for Sam if given half a chance.  They hid in an alley, watching as Lucifer and Sam…talked.  Dean was trying to hide the fact that he was shaking, but Cas could feel the erratic movements of his arm as they were pressed together, watching, waiting.
of the basics, even though he had insisted he was a terrible cook and could burn anything from popcorn to lunchables, so Dean just gets what he needs, knowing they can at least Postmates if they really need to.  He doesn’t flirt with the cute girl at checkout, even though he definitely normally would, because that nervous energy he’s been trying to tamp down since their date on Monday is bubbling in his throat, threatening to spill out if he does anything too nuts.
Dean felt the pressure in his chest tighten, like he had been running a race, he felt out of breath, tears sprang to his eyes of their own accord, falling down his face as the echo of the bunker door rang in his ears. He thought of the awful words that he had hurled at Cas, playing on the things he knew would hurt the worst. Like he wanted Cas to leave. But he didn’t really, he had never actually wanted Cas to leave.He had never thought that Cas would actually walk out the door.
Croatoan was undetectable at first.  People chalked it up to “state of the world” in the newspapers.  Dean always scoffed when he saw the headlines.  First, small towns were being infected.  Then, outlying suburbs, then, the virus began to creep into the major cities, seeping in like blood through a crack in a wall.
He doesn’t know how Shock Television’s popularity has skyrocketed so fast, but it has, and Dean can barely squeeze in the door, with his sweaty hands and his racing heart.  He forces his way towards the bar, where he can at least see the stage, and he can see Charlie and Benny.  And he can see Cas.  It had been about a month since their last run in, and Dean had only spent every waking second thinking about it.
That was one of those days that Cas wanted to make Dean spend in bed with him, but Dean was all about taking care of others, even though Cas stalled him for a good hour by coming up behind him and pressing small delicate kisses to the side of his ear.  Dean growled and whipped around, his holster slipping out of his hand and his hands twisting into Cas’ hair.  Cas grinned against his mouth, and Dean simply kissed him harder in response.
He and Cas don’t really watch the movie.  Cas starts by tracing the lines of Dean’s muscles in his forearm.  Cas had always said Dean’s forearms turned him on, even before the agreement, so Dean was always happy to give him unfettered access.  So he liked the attention, sue him.  The light touches turned into a shoulder massage turned into neck kisses turned into Dean flipping around and kissing him deeply which turned into heavy panting and pawing at each other through clothes.  Cas, for some stupid reason, had decided to put on sweatpants, and Dean was just in the process of working them off while biting at Cas’ collarbone when the oven timer went off.  He rolls off of Cas immediately.
The inside of Bobby’s house was the same as it always was, simultaneously a wreck and a home.  Similar to the car bodies outside, it was rusted and well-loved, old and strong, beautiful in only the way humans could make beautiful.
He repeats the words a thousand times, even knowing that he had eternity to say them, it would never be enough.
He doesn’t feel like there’s much that can surprise him anymore.  He remembers when they had spent three days and multiple twitter polls trying to figure out what the hell to name the band, and Cas had laughed at Benny’s suggestion of
They have to get through like three gates to get to the winding driveway leading up to the house, and it’s just as huge as Dena expected, a classic northeastern mansion, colonially white with dark shutters, a large porch, white balloons and topiaries decorating every spare inch of driveway and lawn.
He feels like he’s in the middle of a spotlight, and he’s never been the one who likes to be onstage.  But this isn’t something that Cas can do for him, this is something that’s his to do, and his alone.  He takes a steadying breath, feeling less like a person and more like a little boat being tossed in a storm tossed ocean.  But Cas was his anchor.
“Yep,” comes a too familiar voice to his left, and there, like he’s been waiting for him, is Bobby.  He can tell it’s his Bobby too, the Bobby that had left them all those years ago, the Bobby that was his real father.  But he doesn’t recognize this, when was Bobby ever at the Roadhouse?
“Well it is winter,” Cas deadpanned back.  Dean looked a little concerned but refrained from saying any more.  He ushered Cas into the kitchen and sat him down for interrogation.
Cas holds onto Dean’s hands, staring at him, taking him in, and Dean just lets himself bask in the glow before Cas disappears to the front, getting ready to welcome the masses.
Cas didn’t realize at first the extent of what had happened.  He thought that he was just a little slower than normal, a little less quick.  He chalked it up to the angels leaving and trying to take him, he was weakened, nothing more. Until, two days after the angels left, Cas fell asleep.
“I’ll start planning,” he pauses again, steeling himself to find the right words, “Thank you.  For today.  I love you.”
He smiles at his phone like a teenager, wondering if Cas was doing the same, sitting in some lavish mansion with his family, on some way too white couch with some subpar food and thinking about Dean from the other coast, looking at the other ocean.
“Well that’s good, because y’all aren’t going anywhere,” Benny pokes his head around the corner.  Eavesdropping prick.
He doesn’t dwell on it, he lets the mundanity of every day life consume him, reveling in the little joys, like Jessica accepting Sam’s invitation to his winter formal, to the frustrations, like Charlie breaking their dining table by betting Benny a steak dinner she could snap it in half with a single jump (she won).
Dean rubs the back of his neck self-consciously.  He doesn’t like talking about himself.  She knows that.
He smiles at Bobby, unable to tell him that it isn’t, it couldn’t be, because the last piece of the Heaven he deserved was in the Empty.
“Yeah,” he says, taking a step back, and breaking the little bubble of…whatever that was brewing between him and Castiel.
He books so many consultations and appointments that the others keep telling him to slow down.  He never has a second of downtime, taking every walk-in, greeting every client with a smile on his face.  It’s easy not to think about anything else when he’s got his customer service voice in full-force, or when he’s making clean, dark lines of ink on someone’s skin, listening to them chatter and the dull thrum of music that beat throughout the shop.
He gets home right on time, intending to spend some quality time with Sam before he left for the weekend, under the pretense of camping so no one got too suspicious.
He doesn’t recognize the number, but when he picks up, he’s asked if he wants to accept the charges of someone in the city jail.  City jail?  What the fuck did Charlie do now?
“Like the movie?” Dean asks, and Samandriel’s face sort of lights up, making Dean feel like he might have a little bit of an in with him.  It’s a comfort in a place where he’s supremely uncomfortable.
Cas stomps out of the room and slams the door to the little blue house, and Dean is left with his heart rattling in his chest and the sinking, crushing realization that he had just done something incredibly stupid.  All he can hear is waves.
Now.  Well, it’s Dean’s turn, and he sure as hell had never had an unsatisfied customer and he wasn’t going to start today.  Cas was still mostly clothed, so he decided to remedy that problem first.  He nearly ripped Cas’ t shirt when he pulled it off of him and Cas made a vague noise of protest.
Cas is off talking to some old friends from high school and Dean does his best to ignore the people around him who are definitely staring at him and definitely looking down their noses at him and definitely wondering why the fuck Cas was there with someone like him.  He watches Cas from across the lawn, lit with those fancy lanterns that rich people bought at Pottery Barn, and he sees this guy lay his hands right on him, all touchy and huggy and Dean wants to die, he doesn’t want to be here, why they fuck did Cas drag him here?”
After, they breathe hard, in tandem for several minutes, the only sound the drip of the leaky faucet in Cas’ bathroom Dean’s been meaning to fix and the music of the waves just feet from Cas’ porch.  Cas adjusts to get out of the wet spot, slinging himself over Dean, and with Cas’ weight heavy on his chest, their chests pressed together and Cas’ neon hair tickling his neck, Dean is lulled to sleep with the lullaby of tracing the ink that adorns Cas’ skin, patterns and divets of birthmarks and freckles and tattoos that Dean knows almost as well as he knows his own.
Cas spent a couple of weeks in Heaven, gathering intel.  The angels didn’t know much, but what they did know is that they were preparing for war.  Everywhere he looked he saw tightened security, as if anyone could break into Heaven.  Then, they began to talk to him, telling him they knew he had been with Dean, that Dean was the only one who could save them.  Cas tried not to listen, tried to push them from his mind.  But in Heaven, there was only so much he could do to avoid the cloying cries for help.
Dean feels like someone blew up a balloon in his stomach and his face sort of hurts from grinning, but it’s a nice feeling.  He kinda feels like he doesn’t deserve it.
“So, Dean Winchester, if you’re not interested in the art, why do you find yourself at a gallery opening?”
“Yeah and it’s that good pimento cheese from that cheese shop near Kashmir, so they should be pretty great.  Also gluten free bread, because, of course.”
He knew Dean couldn’t leave, so he balled his fist up in the back of his jacket and started to pull.  Dean gave way, easier than Cas expected.  Cas led him through the burnt out streets of Detroit, Yaeger and Risa and the rest of the crew not far behind them. to the Impala, and for the first time since Cas had known him, Dean refused to drive.  He climbed in the passenger seat, curled up, and watched Detroit burn as they tore out of town.
“And no, you have no right to speak to me about it either, considering the longest relationship you’ve ever had was five minutes, probably shorter with how long you last.”
“It’s a little bit weird or, out of left field, but I’ve been thinking about it and I’d like to know.”
He feels the tears, hot, stinging the cool air around him.  He lets them come.  He lets the weight of what he’s done, the idea that it might be too late, that things with Cas, because he will find Cas, he always finds Cas, are too damaged, too broken.  His knees buckle at the thought and he hits the forest floor, the roughness of the bark of the tree he clings to the only thing that keeps him from floating away.
“Oh no no no, come back here,” Charlie grabs his hand, pulling him back, “What happened?  Did you see him?”
Cas ended up holding Dean on the floor of Bobby’s house until the sun rose.  When the pinkish sunrise hit their eyes, it was like Dean was snapped out of a trance.  He let go of Cas and struggled to his feet.
“Where were you all weekend?” Charlie asks as soon as Dean steps in the door after work, “the place was so quiet without you.”
“Cas?” he croaks out, fumbling blindly for the light by his bedside, trying to make sure this wasn’t another perfect dream.
“We’ve thought about it, me and Andrea,” Benny grins at Pamela, “If you’ve got ten mil lying around that would certainly sweeten the pot.”
“Just picking up on the conversation Cas,” he squints over at Dean, making Dean turn red even though he wants to look pissed and nothing else.
“It’s good to be home, where the hell have you two been?” her eyes travel down to where their hands are joined.
Cas bites the inside of his cheek, clearly trying his best to abstain from saying whatever it is that he wanted to say.
The first time this happened, Cas could feel the escalation coming.  Dean looked at him far more than he ever had, and didn’t care when Dean caught him looking.  They were standing outside the Impala, having just finished with a couple of straggler Croats near Camp Chitaqua.  Cas was washing his hands with a bottle of water when he felt Dean’s eyes on him.  He barely had time to look up before Dean was pressing himself into him, pressing his mouth to his.  Cas could now appreciate the geography of Dean’s mouth; the plush bow of his top lip, his tongue running across Cas’ bottom lip.  He felt Dean’s hands twist into his hair, pulling them impossibly closer.
She wraps her arms around him, and they embrace for a while, both sort of breathing in the fact that this really was it, and it wasn’t going to end with screaming or slamming doors.  It was going out with a puff of smoke instead of an explosion.  Less climactic, but a lot safer.
Dean shakes his head, not wanting to get into a fight, but it’s not like he had really been able to forget just how shitty of a situation he had been put in there.
“He didn’t really have to tell me anything.  Your interaction and his face when Ash said you were here said enough.”
“Hm,” Anna looks him up and down again, and Dean feels hot all over, but not the good kind of hot he feels when Cas looks at him.  He’s uncomfortable and his suit is hot and Cas’ sister doesn’t like him and he wants to leave and never look back.
Dean grins at him, still working on getting the literal layers of mascara off his eyelashes.  He didn’t really need it, his eyelashes were so long and pretty and…
Dean swigs the last of his whiskey and reaches behind the bar for the bottle.  It’s New Year’s Eve, he’s allowed.
Cas didn’t answer.  He knew he was in the wrong but he didn’t want to back down.  It was always almost impossible to just let go of an argument with Dean.  They always wanted to hold onto the issue until the bitter end.
Uh oh, they were doing that thing they do, that thing where they get a little too close to the shit that Dean is ashamed of, of the thing that will make Cas walk out the door, and he’s not ready to let go of Cas just let, so he avoids, just like he always does.  It’s easier than being honest about himself.
Dean just kind of wormed his way under Cas’ arm.  A gesture of affection that was beyond rare.  They didn’t say anything else, but listened to “The Song Remains the Same” play itself out on the record player.
Birthdays came and went like any other winter days after that.  Twenty-two, thirty, thirty-six, forty-one, they all passed without incident, without mention, without name.  Dean didn’t mind, it was easier that way anyway.  At least, that’s what he told himself when he got himself a slice of gas-station pie on a solo hunt when he turned thirty-seven.  He was lucky to be alive at all.
“I don’t know, maybe it’s just that one-night stands are easier.  Last relationship I had really kinda fucked me up so.”
It’s easily the nicest hotel Dean has ever stayed in, and he had splurged so Sam could get his own room.  Listen, they don’t take vacations often, and even though he worked in a place that could make him look like an over-microwaved hotdog if something went wrong, it paid really well, and for the first time in their lives, he could afford two rooms at a nice hotel.
He shakes his head as he pulls into the garage next to Ellen’s.  He wasn’t going to let his dumb anxiety brain ruin the weekend.  He wanted to live in the happy little bubble that he and Cas had created at his little house on the beach for at least a little while longer.
Until they were finally alone at night, and Dean didn’t have to be the fearless leader, he didn’t have to be strong.  For quite a few nights, they would simply sit together, Cas playing with Dean’s hair as an old record player of Bobby’s scratching out whichever record Dean had picked that night.  And some nights they would watch movies, since the fearless leader could have his own private generator, and Dean would whisper his memories of the movies into Cas’ ear.  And the worst nights, Dean wouldn’t say anything, but would cry for Bobby, for his mother, his father, Ellen, Jo, Pamela, Ash, Sam, the state of the world, and Cas would hold him until his tears were drying and his breathing was deep and even.  Eventually, they found solace in each other, lips meeting lips, thighs pressing together under sheets.  Cas walked around camp with hickeys on his neck, ignoring the looks of those around him.
“That’s only because Benny challenged me to a shot game and he’s bigger than me!  It’s not fair to bring that up!”
“Dean,” Cas said in his best impression of a calm voice.  Dean was pacing the living room.  Well, stomping the living room is more like it.
Until John had died, and Dean had felt the shame come back with a vengeance that he had never known.  He couldn’t go back, he couldn’t let himself have that, he didn’t deserve that happiness, not when his father had died, drunk and alone, without Dean there.
“I’m sorry, did you want to pick up the tab this time, Balthazar?  Since you refuse to pay on your own.”
“Starving to death,” he mimics her, and Jo has to hold her back from throwing the basket across the table at him.
“Lots of people have fucked families, Dean.  You aren’t unique for having a shitty childhood, and knowing Cas, I don’t think he’s going to hold that against you.  Plus, I’m proud of you, how far you’ve come, how you’ve turned your shit around, it’s really a good thing.”
“I really think you moving in will be so good for us, Dean.  We’ll be able to really prepare for when the boys go to college.  I know Ben’s a little younger but pretty soon we’ll have the whole place to ourselves, and I just don’t know if, well, when we have kids of our own, Cas just puts out a certain vibe, and I’m not sure I want my kids around that.”
Dean looks at Cas, and he can tell what he wants, which, don’t get him wrong, Dean also wants with all of his, uh, heart, but there was a surplus of people in the house tonight, and Dean didn’t trust either of them to be quiet, especially when they were both drunk.
The third time Dean wakes, it’s more violent: he wakes up gasping and thrashing, trying to get out of his bed and get away from the danger that was all in his head.  He imagines strong hands on his face and his chest, these calming, warm hands, and he doesn’t even open his eyes, he lives in the moment where he can almost remember the smell of that person’s hair, the color of their tan skin, the blue of their eyes.  These memories calm him so much that he’s almost certain he’s asleep before he hits the pillow.
out of his pocket, and began to read.  He felt, rather than saw the tension begin to bleed out of Dean’s muscles.  With Vonnegut rolling off Cas’ tongue, eventually Dean fell asleep.  And if he ended up leaning against Cas, breathing softly through his nose, Cas didn’t say anything about it.
“Oh look who it is.  Dean Winchester’s little pet.  What’s it like to fuck a fallen angel, Dean?  A little sad probably.  You know he loves you right, it’s written all over that sad face.  And you’ve driven him to drugs with your bad mean ways, Dean.  It’s pretty sad that you don’t care about him at all, do you?  You’ve been dead inside ever since little baby Sammy said yes to the big man.”
Cas doesn’t say anything else, just slides down into a sitting position on the floor, his back still on the counter.
Dean immediately tries to weasel out of it, saying that Sam would probably just want to hang at home and relax after his acceptance interview (law was weird).  He doesn’t want to try to fight the crazy Halloween crowds, especially since the subway would be a literal nightmare and they all had work in the morning.  He would much prefer to spend Halloween handing out candy, eating way too much of it, and watching terrible Halloween movies.
“Remember that time I was dating that girl and she fucked one of my professors behind my back and then we found out on Yik Yak?  And I cried to you for like two weeks straight about it?  You’ve seen me at my worst, nothing you say about your 45 year relationship with Lisa is going to phase me.”
“Heya Sam,” Dean begins awkwardly, but then Cas takes control of the situation.  He holds out his hand to Sam, smiling widely.
“Are you insinuating that you would be okay with dying after the movie?” Benny asks, eyebrows raised at her.
“Where are the others?” Cas slides smoothly into his seat, Dean scraping his chair against the wood floor to sink into it.  Anna gives him a disdainful look.  He really does not like her.
Dean sighs, considering Cas, who is standing in front of his bathroom mirror, putting some kind of product in his hair that Dean has learned he spends way too much money on.
Cas is barely aware of the silence in the room.  The mixtape had ended, but it feels like there’s almost a roar in his ears.  Fittingly, they lean forward simultaneously, bridging the gap and giving into what was almost eleven years of sheer buildup.
on there as well.  He can’t tell how they’re ordered.  It’s not alphabetical, not by genre, not even by series, it seems like they just get put on the shelves in a way that Castiel understands, an insight into his mind.
Charlie is holding onto his shoulders, his anchor in the choppy sea of this meltdown.  He hears her sigh quietly.
Those next few days were truly absolutely miserable.  Cas just did more of the same.  And took more pills, but no one needed to know about that.
Cas nods and they walk through the brightly lit streets, almost a carbon copy of the night a little over a year ago, when Dean was almost too nervous to meet Cas at all, back when he called him Castiel.  A lot’s changed.
“Yeah,” Dean says, trying desperately to remain casual and missing by about ten miles, “You too.  I hope you sell all these weird paintings.”
“You can,” Dean watches the minnows twirl in the water at their feet, not able to meet Cas’ eyes, “Are they looking for me?”
“I’m trying to buy you a drink,” Castiel’s eyes are clear, honest, he’s serious, and Dean seriously wants to take him up on it.  He hesitates.  What the hell?
Dean slammed some newspaper clippings on the counter.  Cas looked down at them.  They were from all over, mostly small towns, one little city in Texas called Taylor.  People gone crazy, killing indiscriminately, normally peaceful people simply turned violent for no apparent reason.  He had heard something of this, when he was in Heaven, before he knew Dean or Sam or Bobby or anything about the world.  He knew it was bad news, probably worse than bad news.
“If we get married you shouldn’t get to dictate who I see, who my friends are!  What if I told you you couldn’t see your sister anymore, or Ben couldn’t see his dad, what the fuck kinda guy would you think I am.”
It could’ve gone on for hours, but it’s really only a couple of seconds before Cas is pulling them apart, placing a steadying hand on Dean’s chest as Dean chases his lips.
Cas does as he’s told, and Dean notices he’s tracing pattens into Dean’s forearm, leaving heat in the wake of his fingertips, like he’s made of fire.
Benny smiles, and Dean knows that as much as he misses Benny coming around and being the life of the party, that Benny was living the kind of life he used to only be able to dream of.  Andrea and Celeste?  They were no contest to those two, and they shouldn’t be.
“Yeah, maybe we are,” Dean snarks, trying to ignore that Castiel’s hand was tracing the lines of the tattoo on his arm again, “what was your favorite part of the show, then?”
Dean has no idea where they’re going, but Castiel pulls them into a wide alley between two theatres, where they’re less compelled to keep moving by the thronging crowds on the dark, wet streets.  Castiel is staring at Dean, who’s finally coming down from his high
Cas would remember that night as one of the last good ones, but in the moment you never know those kinds of things.  So he just enjoyed it, and let the sex, the taste of Dean take up every corner of his soul.  Yeah he missed being an angel.  He missed the power and the surety and the little bit of arrogance, and he missed his powers, but sometimes feeling things wasn’t half bad.  Of course, he might be a little biased, because this thought crossed his brain right as Dean made one of the most unholy noises he had ever heard.
The ocean laps quietly at the sand, reminding Dean to stay grounded and not just fly away, but he’s so tightly wrapped around Cas he doesn’t think he would make it very far.
“That’s not me, that’s Cas,” Dean laughs, and then immediately feels like he got punched in the stomach.
They make their way to some seafood place right on the water, next to the New England Aquarium.  Dean loves aquariums, he’ll probably come check that out when Benny, Charlie, and Cas have to go get set up at the space.
They started preparations to move everyone right away, especially since the Croats were literally beginning to walk up the driveway.  Surprisingly, Chuck had really begun to step up and take control of organizing things for the move.  He was picking out which cars to take and what to load in which vehicle.
Sam passes by them around ten seconds later, Dean’s Xbox in his arms, grinning like the little shit that he is.
“Nah,” he laughs at Charlie’s shocked face, “Don’t look so surprised, I was there for Sam, not to get laid.
“It’s okay man, everyone has bad sex every once in a while,” Benny looks sympathetic, which, though he has good intentions, doesn’t make Dean feel much better, mostly because it wasn’t true.  It had been fine, good really, but not nearly anything like what he and Cas had had two months ago.  And it honestly pissed him off that he was still thinking about it, because he never had before and nothing had really changed and he felt stupid.
“I was doing some bad shit on the streets.  Folks kicked me out for selling stolen stuff, then drugs.  I was selling on the street and had just gotten kicked out of the shelter I was staying in when Bobby found me.  Probably should’ve kicked my ass into next week, I was dealing in front of the shop, and I’m pretty sure he came out there to beat me bloody, but I guess he saw how old I was and he pulled me inside, cleaned me up, and basically put me on a kinda lockdown until I just ended up staying.  Pretty fucked, huh?”
Cas’ house looks cold, uninviting, but Dean wastes no time taking in his surroundings, rounding on Cas the second he shuts the door.
Anger is bubbling in Dean’s gut again, because Cas talking this way is just wrong, he shouldn’t feel this way, not when he’s…anything but boring, fuck, he’s everything.  He’s literally everything and Dean doesn’t know how to say that, he doesn’t know how to tell Cas that, how to put his heart out there and not get it shattered into ten million pieces.
They’re right.  There are strings of lights hung from the ceiling, giving the whole place the feel of one of those huge tents people have weddings in in the country.  The art on the walls is the thing that shines.  It’s the perfect eclectic mix, some things sad, some things happy, bright colors and completely black, canvases the size of a wall and the size of a stamp, they splatter the walls, organized chaos, and Dean feels drawn to them, a direct contrast to that gallery opening all those months ago, when he ran into a dark haired art dealer and gallery curator that changed his life.
“You do this for all your hookups the morning after?” Dean teases, hoping very much that he actually didn’t.
The walk down the hallway to the living room is the longest of Dean’s life.  He feels like he’s walking down a hallway to his demise, this is a worst case scenario, the type of thing he sees in movies.  This doesn’t happen in real life, does it?  Where they get caught and the first meeting is post sex that the family hears?  Fuck.  He was so fucked.  And not in the good way.
His master plan of getting drunk enough to forget everything that had happened hadn’t worked, because as soon as he dragged himself into bed, he was forced to relive Cas leaving.  The things he said, the way Cas had looked at him, like Dean was breaking his heart, his blue eyes turning away from Dean, and Dean himself, so angry that he couldn’t tell Cas that it was all right, because it wasn’t.  Nothing was.
The cool air outside the restaurant is perfect, just what Dean needs after two and a half glasses of that really good wine, and he lets Castiel lead the way, leading him towards a station nearby.
“I-” Dean tries, before cutting himself off, he doesn’t know what to do, he doesn’t know what to say, fuck fuck fuck he’s going to fuck this up again and he desperately doesn’t want to do that, he doesn’t want to fuck this up again dammit he wants Cas back he wants Cas back he wants he wants he wants.
“Uh thanks,” Dean returns Castiel’s look himself.  He’s in that long coat again, wearing skinny jeans that fit too well and a light grey sweater that Dean could tell from a distance was soft and warm and as short enough that, if he lifted up his arms, Dean would be able to see a strip of his stomach.  Not that he wants to…yeah, yeah he does.
“I told them not to,” Cas responds, not taking his eyes off of Dean’s face, “I figured you’d need a little time.  Many of them have been here for years, they forget that it takes some getting used to, especially for someone stubborn like you.”
“Excuse me?” Dean says, caught off guard.  He’s usually the one that’s buying the drinks, not the other way around.
Dean pauses before answering.  He’s not trying to be difficult, because Cas was amazing, it was the best first date he’d had in, well, ever, but the morning had dawned and he realized that what he was doing was stupid, reckless, him just asking to get hurt.
“Okay, alright, I never said that,” Sam’s laughing at him and Dean flips him off, “I said that I didn’t really know him so-”
Cas pushes on his arm playfully, and Dean definitely doesn’t miss the contact the second that it’s gone.
He dreams of that painting again, the one that hangs in Cas’ hallway, and this time he sees more of the monster, with its deformed, shifting face, black holes for eyes, a gaping mouth, stretching down to rip him to pieces, screaming at him, showing him, torn and bleeding, that even here, in death, that he wasn’t worth the ground he was laying on.  He tries to breathe, tries to cry out, and he sees a solider, one that’s higher up in the rankings than him, standing there, and why does he look familiar?  Why isn’t he helping Dean?  Why is he standing there, letting him get crushed?
“I can’t exactly get shitfaced at my boyfriend’s monthly family dinner but thanks.  Plus you haven’t met them, they make the Lannisters seem like a functional family”
“Do you want dinner or not?  You were just complaining that you were hungry, come get some of this.”
“Fucking…unbelievable,” Dean says, thinking just how unbelievable the whole night actually was, about how Cas looked in the morning, how he looked at night, that little crease that formed between his eyebrows when he was thinking about something.
as much as he does.  Sure, he does have a serious weakness for Tennessee Williams, as evidenced by the blue rose, which is still fresh, on his arm.  It’s longer than any show he’s ever been to, nearly three hours with the intermission, but he’s pulled into the world, the Mississippi sand and gulf, the crashing waves, the real sand covering the stage, as easily as if he was slipping into a long forgotten dream.
Castiel bridges the space between them in one, two, three fluid steps.  Dean wants nothing more than to remove the remaining inches of negative space.
When Dean collapses into his bed at dawn, utterly exhausted, he feels a little more like himself than he had in the past few weeks, like maybe things were going back to normal.
When he pulled into Lebanon’s most trusty dive bar, he felt a little pang of guilt for Sam, so he sent him a quick text, letting him know where he was.  It’s not like Sam would come looking for him, he was trapped in his own little world for a while, and Dean had learned long ago that the best way to let Sam heal was to leave him be, and to have a hot meal ready on the table when he decided to come out of his room.  But for now, Dean needed to get blind fucking drunk just to forget about this absolute hell of a week.
“I have to warn you, I’m a talker, I love to talk through movies, so tell me to shut the fuck up, I won’t take it personally.
“Cas is family, Dean, when are you gonna get that through your thick skull? I’m gonna go look for Cas.”
Dean had picked up Bobby’s mantle of trying to find the Colt.  He took Bobby’s maps from the house, his books, everything they could carry and threw it into the Impala.  He would spread the maps out at night, when the rest of the camp was sleeping, and would look at them for hours, muttering to himself, trying to triangulate where the demons would take it next.  One thing they knew: it never stayed in one place long.
“Alright, we all know where we’re going,” Dean started, his voice deep and powerful, commanding attention, “But this time, we can expect far more resistance than we’re used to.  Obviously, we can’t kill Lucifer without the Colt, but if we have a chance to do both, then we might as well ice him while we have the chance.”
“No,” Dean replies, a little curtly.  Cas seems to get the hint that he doesn’t want to talk about this at all under any circumstances anyway, so he just pulls out his own phone from his pocket and starts scrolling next to Dean.  They sit that way for the next half an hour or so, occasionally showing each other a funny meme or video.  Cas pulls out one of Dean’s all time favorite vines that has him on the floor for five minutes because it was just so him when he was getting his degree.
He gave it to her, he had drank himself past fighting.  She pulled him out of the bar towards the cab and pushed him in, just as he had predicted.
So he was probably rich as fuck.  New York City man, you couldn’t throw a rock without hitting someone who probably had a yacht in the Hamptons or something.
“Yes, I think you’re very funny.  And the way you talk about your work is something that I think I could listen to all night, if you’d let me.  And I did come all the way out here on a Tuesday because I couldn’t get you out of my head.  I realize that I’m being very…forward, but, you did ask.”
“And you’re not going to give me blue balls,” Cas said petulantly, folding his arms and staring daggers at Dean as he tested the temperature.
They brush their teeth next to each other at Cas’ bathroom sink, standing shoulder to shoulder, Dean using the designated toothbrush he has at Cas apartment, and Cas does his nightly skincare routine while Dean heads toward the bed.  He debates whether or not to leave his boxers on, and then decides against it, it’s not like it’s anything Cas hasn’t seen before.  He’s scrolling through his phone when Cas comes out of the bathroom, and he stops Dean in his tracks when he sees Dean, eyes wide.
“Dean look!” she cries, as her butterfly kite spins and soars.  Dean grins at her and gives her a thumbs up, glancing over to where their picnic was set up and seeing Charlie and Sam watching him.  Uh oh.  He was caught.
at home with Sam and eat way too much Chinese takeout that was going to be delivered right into his hands thanks to the magic of Postmates.
“How’s he doing?” Pamela asks, eyes wide with worry as Dean sets down his bag and shrugs off his jacket.  She’s such a mom, he loves her.
, and Ellen’s was loud and homey and comfortable and maybe would snap him back into some semblance of normalcy.
As time goes on, things get easier.  Dean finds a little more of himself with each passing day, surrounded by his family, his friends, the tattoos he creates, the clients he meets.  It still, sometimes, feels like he’s being crushed to death by the monster in the painting, but if he allows himself to get crushed, who’s going to annoy Sam and Eileen for the rest of their lives?
