John just gave him a wink and a smug smile. “Well, I think you’re missing out, but that’s your loss, mon amour.”
“Oh piss off. Although I do like phrases that refer to food. Like ‘tremper le bisquit’.”
In spite of himself, John smiled back.
After a stunned moment John began to laugh. He laughed so hard he choked on his tea and nearly upset his mug onto the scones.
”GODDAMMIT SHERLOCK, I saw it and then you shouted and made me drive right into it!”
Now we're getting somewhere, John thought.
“I can’t help it if this was the only one available. Depress the clutch and slowly shift…”
“Sherlock…..there is only one cupcake in this box.”
“We're not talking about my pants! Focus, John!”
Sherlock didn't come home. He wasn’t with Lestrade, he wasn’t with Molly (either standing over a morgue slab or lying on one). Mycroft was less than helpful. John slept in his chair, waiting and hoping and filled with remorse. He wondered whether Sherlock was holed up in some drug den of Malteaser-mainliners, or hanging around street corners trying to bribe primary schoolers to score him some sugar.
He’s chosen that tie because it complements his shirt – does he know how it reflects his eyes? A man could drown in those eyes.
“All finished, ta,” said John cheekily.
“Sherlock, there’s something written on this one.”
“Sherlock, you give literal meaning to the term “breathing down one’s neck’.”
John yelped. “So you killed –
“Why don’t you stay home and we can just be stark bollocks naked together instead. We’ll call it a no-pants date. At any rate, it’s almost teatime.”
John said nothing. He couldn’t be blamed for letting Sherlock hang out there for a moment: he was only human, and he was hurt. He looked down at Sherlock, who was resting his forearms on John's thighs, fidgeting with the edge of John's jumper.
Sherlock's voice dripped with sarcasm. “Even I can guess what that means.”
“John, it’s been plainly evident that you have been writing a birthday poem for me, although you concealed it so badly that you may as well have published it on the front page of the Daily Mail. The poem! ‘Winds of tomorrow, shadow on the shining land…’? ” He waved the paper around in exasperated confusion.
John shook his head slowly. He was obviously hallucinating.
“Spot-on, Dr. Watson. Well. Done. You.” Sherlock said peevishly. He detested it when John laughed at him.
“Donne-moi une fessée s’il te plait. Je suis un garçon villain!” [
“So, no upper arm tattoo then.”
John’s explosive projection caused the pigeons on the windowsill to scatter.
The pink bakery box contains two decadent little cupcakes iced with swirls of vanilla, in ruffled paper cups. One is studded with pink sprinkles. The other is festooned with delicately elaborate chocolate script that says: “Marry Me”.
“Sherlock, you are the most insufferable, supercilious, intransigent human ever born. You are an intellectual snob. You are complete bollocks when it comes to emotions, and your capacity for incivility is unsurpassed. You are a knob, a bell-end and a wanker supreme. Not to mention, you are the most stubborn fucking git on seven continents.
John winked at him. “Bed's been rather cold without you.”
They glared at each other for a moment, and then Sherlock said dramatically, “John, you should know I consider myself married to my coat…”
“Good.”
“Of course,” John said. “But Sherlock – am I really the only one who knows?”
“It’s consumer advocacy. Now kiss me. I’m minty-fresh.”
John said, “And that is the reason no one ever sees you in short sleeves”.
“Oh piss off. If I didn't take care of you, who would.”
“John, kiss me.”
The moment John disappeared, Sherlock reached into the box, snatched a cupcake, and hurled it out of the open kitchen window. He heard it hit the bins below with a satisfying *splat*.
“221B Baker Street. Sitting room. In front of the fireplace. On. The. Rug.”
“You want me to read you a bedtime story.”
“But where’s my poem?”
“John, where are you going?”
“You say ‘flair’ - I say ‘fugly.’ ”
Sherlock immediately seized it like a returned lover. He freed it from the dry cleaner’s plastic shroud and pressed his face into its folds, inhaling deeply.
“That is seems doubtful, sir,” the old, interrupting, codger piped back up. “I wonder if this is not just some convoluted attempt to aim a spear at our nation’s omega ownership laws. How many other rightful filings do you mean to disrupt using similar pretenses as this one?” James wanted to laugh in her face at that. John’s case was a prime example of the system’s need for reform, but marshaled himself, before words like
John pulled free. “We’re colleagues.”
The scents pouring over John were pleased, aroused, and a touch possessive but oddly not angry or feral. But John didn’t want to lower his guard. “Don’t alphas normally get worked up over this sort of thing?”
“Ah, John, forgive me, but we are about to be paid a visit by my brother. Unusual, and doubtful he is here to thank you for your services the other day. If you wouldn’t mind excusing us.”
“Like I would ever volunteer to be under your thumb.” And with that, Sherlock spun on his heal and strode out of the office, leaving Mycroft no time for a parting shot.
“How can you tell?”
∙ ∙ ∙
“A butcher with a vendetta, and a sharp knife. Clean thankfully. A consequence of my work.”
Moran looked irritated. “Are you reneging on our agreement?”
The others nodded sagely at this declaration, or else held their tongues. James gawked at them. He knew there couldn’t really be universal support for Holmes’ speech—the legal clause sited must be extremely obscure—not from the likes of Parker, but no pushback came.
As they walked out the of front door, John chanced a glance back at Mycroft, who had fixed them with a penetrating look. Not a nice thing to be on the receiving end of, and John couldn’t gather what conclusion he’d come to.
She set down her tea delicately. “I have conditions, naturally. And rules. For the content of these sessions and your behavior during them.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“He was being a bit pushy.”
matter. Meet me at NSY when you are done.
“Not every straight impulse. I would rather like to watch him with you, to begin things.” She raised an eyebrow and he went on. “You did once say you would like to see me beg. Twice. This endeavor would provide you with many opportunities to do that and more. And I am given to understand, as you have no doubt surmised yourself, that John is remarkably clever with his tongue, should his generous endowments not pique your interest.”
“Also, you’ll want to be careful, John, living in that house. You look fit enough, but letting Mycroft dictate your diet will put an end to that quickly.”
“Oh, I’ll definitely want to keep you soldier, don’t fret about that.” He continued typing on his phone, filling out the information.
John glowered at him. “Oh, you’ll learn to appreciate it well enough, too, Watson,” the alpha looked smug, “I love a defiant omega. And I knew your face was good from her pictures, but that scent is just treacherous. Puts me over the edge. I was dying to get my hands on you at the pub last night…” Victor had dropped to one knee and was groping him now, as if to demonstrate.
But Sherlock just went on writing and muttering, and John sat down again, suddenly drained of anger as well as any remaining after-effects of the 30-second snog.
"Don’t get stroppy, it’s just your foot and your hand. I know you have excellent coordination because I’ve seen you shoot people.”
Amid the screeching and smoking of the bedroom battlefield, BAMF Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers turned and fired on Sherlock.
Sherlock, however, was not to be denied his measure of joy.
"Or rather - let me kiss you. You need do nothing but stand there," Sherlock said, as though this was the most reasonable request in the world.
“Did it occur to you to ASK ME if you could take it?”
“John, if you can come up with something suitable that we both agree could possibly be ‘our song’, then I will consent to dress and behave appropriately and attend this odious wedding and dance with you. Now, I like romantic standards and anything I can waltz to. No cheesy pop songs, no film clichés, or anything that has the word ‘booty’ anywhere in it, and NO Bee Gees. That ought to give you plenty to work with.”
"No, John. I was searching for a way to make my apologies without words, without creating any of my usual misunderstandings. I needed to ensure that I could always make things right again."
“I fail to see how…NO! SHERLOCK!!... see how this benefits me…NOOOOOOOO!”
“All right, Sherlock Smart-Arse Holmes, where would you suggest I kiss you?”
Cry but not too often, Play but not too rough…. ‘ “ John sang lustily as he came up the stairs.
John reached into the inner pocket of the magnificent Belstaff coat hanging carelessly on the back of the bedroom door. Quickly he drew out Sherlock's little black Moleskine notebook, listened to make sure the shower was still running (Sherlock was always good for at least 15 minutes in the shower), and began to write on the very last page.
Sherlock gave John a stroppy scowl.
John merely muttered louder. “Sherlock, “ he said thickly.
John sighed. “Two weeks.”
"It's healthier. You did realize that too much body heat lowers your sperm count?"
“But I do keep coming back to this one,” John said. “It’s hopelessly old-school…”
“It’s just a term of affection, Sherlock.”
“Perhaps that explains why you slept with my laundry while I was away in Cardiff last night.”
“Je veux te lécher des hanches jusqu’aux pieds.” [
“I made that part up.”
"Why would she deny that it happened?"
Dearest Sherlock:
“Oh no, by all means, out with it. ‘John Watson is a fucking idiot.' There, I saved you the trouble. Cheers.”
Sherlock glared malevolently and gave a huge convulsive swallow, sending a tsunami of sugar into his system and depriving John of his annoying moral superiority.
“John, what?”
“Sherlock, calm down. Yes, it smells a little…unpleasant right now, but it just wants airing out. Besides, it’s not nearly as pervasive and objectionable as formaldehyde.”
,” Sherlock said, glowering at him.
“Marry you.”
John was elated to be one-up on Sherlock - this was like having kryptonite with which to counteract Sherlock's vast array of mental superpowers.
SWEET PEA SWEET PEA SWEET PEA!!!
“John, I find it highly ironic that you, a vegetarian, would even WANT to call me “Sausage’.”
"And an old, old lady all dressed in black.. grabbed me and pulled down my PANTS…and turned me upside down ... and rubbed an onion on my BUM!" He glared at John with cockeyed indignation.
That made John laugh even harder so Sherlock threw himself on the sofa to sulk.
“I refuse to go about reeking of Flowerbomb, which Mrs. Hudson tends to use like fly spray. OH!”
Finally the long-awaited day arrived. John slid out of bed without waking Sherlock, walked up the street to the dry cleaner and redeemed the coat. He brought it home and laid it across the sofa so that it would be the first thing Sherlock saw when he got up.
GOOD MORNING SWEET PEA.
That's the way it ought to be…
Sherlock rested his head against John’s. “It’s fine, John. It’s all fine. And rose petals on the bed sound quite nice. Although what I’d really like...”
When Sherlock came home that evening he found John in his chair, leaning his head on his hand and staring reflectively into the fireplace. “Still auditioning dance songs?” Sherlock asked, removing his coat and scarf.
He looked over at Sherlock, who had slid so far down in his leather chair that his arse was almost on the floor. He certainly didn't behave as though he felt he was in any great danger. Then again, Sherlock never did.
“Tourists. Irrelevant.”
“I have to brush my teeth first.”
“Hurry up, John, my nicotine patches are losing their potency and I need an immediate adrenaline rush.”
“…See? That wasn’t so difficult.”
“Oh all right, I suppose you’ve had enough for the moment.”
“LAP dance,” John said. “Not LAPLAND dance! Oh God, why do I bother sometimes.”
“ ‘We'll build a cocoon of love and respect.
“I had no idea. Look at all the stars. No light pollution here at all.”
“Who do you think I am, Daniel Craig?”
“Sherlock, what are you doing with those watercolors?”
“That was MY cupcake. You’re meant to eat this one. It’s….special. It’s just for you.”
He read it over once more, searching for any possible shred of redeeming value. What on earth could all this mean?
And maybe the moon over Baker Street didn't know they were in love, but the two of them knew – knew it from the moment they leaned laughing against the wall downstairs, ridiculously delighted at the direction their lives had suddenly taken, and at how funny and lovely and exciting it all promised to be.
John fixed Sherlock with his own serious stare.
“When it came to me the coat was already permeated with the smells of the chemistry lab, the hot scorch of steam radiators in the lecture rooms, and petrol and river water and a hint of Penhaligon’s Bayolea, which he customarily used after shaving. That simply can’t be duplicated,” Sherlock said, as though explaining something to a remarkably backward child.
"John! Focus!"
"And now I have stoked your anger to the perfect pitch of rage: I've ruined your evening, I've openly admitted to manipulating you for my own scientific curiosity, and have further insulted you by alluding to your propensity for dissolving into immature..."
"Kiss me."
“...Any tea?”
“Sherlock, I’m a doctor, not an exhibitionist.”
By the week’s end Sherlock had come to the last of the yarn, and was very pleased with himself. It was a jumper, all right – two sleeves, a body, a hole for the neck and it was only slightly odd-shaped; lying squashed under sofa cushions and being slept on hadn't done it much harm at all. It was brilliant. Once John put it on, it would fit him perfectly, Sherlock was sure of it.
And then suddenly John felt as though he was being twerked on by a tumble dryer.
“Now don’t be angry. Let’s kiss and make up.” Sherlock adopted his little-lost-puppy expression which generally worked on John when nothing else did.
“I won’t snore – I’ll stay awake.”
“And by the way…yes.”
John’s voice was sleepy with satisfaction: “Who knew THAT one was going to come in handy…”
John searched the flat for contraband every day because Sherlock backslid with regularity. The deli next door was under strict orders to not sell him any Malteasers, but that left thousands of other places for him to obtain his fix. The limit of John’s tolerance ruptured when he knocked over the Lucky Cat and found dozens of the little chocolate fiends stuffed inside.
“Sometime, perhaps.”
“Boring.”
“Sherlock – " John was wheezing with laughter. “Sherlock, that wasn't intended for you - it was a cryptography exercise! Codes, ciphers, first letter of every word…? Like the London A-Z book? It was for a blog post!" He laughed till tears came.
SHERLOCK IS MY SWEET PEA. I’LL TELL THE WORLD.
“I do not find that amusing in the least.”
Then he leaned close to John’s ear and whispered seductively: “I'll knit you matching socks".
he asked himself once more.
“John, it’s very dark out here, and since you’re not familiar with the area, I thought…”
“You know, I quite adore the way you leave me love notes in my pockets, and some of them are delightfully filthy, but…in code? REALLY, Sherlock?”
‘ Marry me a little, Love me just enough.
“Oh, never mind.”
A week had passed since John’s favorite jumper met its death by hydrochloric acid (completely Sherlock's fault), and the beastly stench of burnt Aran wool had nearly disappeared from the flat, but Sherlock was still kipping on the sofa and John was still shooting Sherlock filthy looks from under his wiry eyebrows. Although Sherlock had apologized in his own special and completely inadequate way, that ruined jumper had been John’s final straw.
“Sherlock, have I ever told you that you have the most beautiful eyes?”
“No.”
“Why John, I believe you’ve been a bit jealous.”
Sherlock rolled his bloodshot eyes at him.
John pursed his lips and did some deducing of his own. Sherlock was clearly mortified at having been proved wrong, but why would he be upset because there was no birthday poem? Sherlock hated his poetry!
For such a superior intellect as Sherlock Holmes, how difficult could this possibly be?
“And I’m afraid it shrunk up. A bit.”
“John, I think I hear someone at the front door.”
“It’s in the toothbrush holder.”
John plucked the little notebook out of Sherlock's other hand and flung it across the room.
Now Sherlock was quite desperate to get back into John’s good graces. Not to mention, desperate to get back into their bed. The sofa was adequate for thinking and sulking, but cuddling and snogging oneself was no fun at all.
“Well, I suppose there is that…”
Then Sherlock said quietly, “John? Perhaps we should choose another song.”
“Listen, you, my granny from Brighton could have whipped any 10 men with her pancake griddle, so just shut it.”
But a plan was afoot. Instructional YouTube videos were a goldmine of information, apparently – one could learn anything! Cooking, napkin-folding…knitting!  Sherlock resolved to learn to knit straightaway and replace John’s beloved jumper. It seemed likely that anyone who could tie his own shoes could knit, and what more would a jumper require aside from a pile of woolly yarn and some pointy stick-things…
"What happened to your assailant?"
Sherlock shuffled in, fully dressed yet looking utterly sleep-deprived. “Please, John, it’s too early in the morning for nursery rhymes.”
“Those granite tors seemed fairly immovable.”
“So – what’s wrong with just wearing another one for a while?”
After which they silently set up separate work stations - Sherlock at the sitting room table with his laptop, wearing his headphones; John camped in the kitchen with his own laptop and a supply of chocolate Hob-Nobs.
Sherlock didn't even bother to reply.
“It smells bad,” Sherlock said petulantly.
“Well, all right, but ...”
“ ‘That certain night, the night we met…’ ”
“Dammit.”
“Please, Sherlock. Your voice is so…relaxing.”
Evening, 221B Baker Street, February 13:
“It may have escaped your notice, as so very many things do, but I am neither a duck nor a swan nor a goose nor any other type of waterfowl, and I dislike being referred to as such.”
“I couldn’t reach it.”
“That’s true. I’m suddenly rather hungry. Starving, actually.”
“I want to marry you, Sherlock. And though I’m not certain you can hear me, I am planting this subliminal thought in that mighty brain of yours. One of these days I’ll be bold enough to propose marriage while you are fully conscious. And if you are smarter than you were this afternoon, you’ll say yes.
In the dark there were only the sounds of creaking leather and their quickening breath.
“Sherlock, please. I’m trying to listen to my voicemail.”
Sherlock winked at him. “Just that one line reminds me of you.” He sang: “ ‘And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart…' ”
John’s eyes glittered in the dim light.
“John, kiss me.”
“John, kiss me.”
John was glad to see that the sitting room was deserted, and faint snoring told him Sherlock was likely to be occupied for some time yet. He opened his laptop. Argh, this was bloody awful. What had he been thinking? Up too late last night plus too much cognac equaled some very sappy doggerel. This would never do.
Sherlock remained watchful, apparently struggling with some deep inner turmoil. Soon, something was going to happen, it had to. The sitting room air felt full of an invisible electric charge.
“Another driving lesson tomorrow?”
“No, no, just a quiet holiday. Walking on the moors, bird-watching, long drives through the…”
Obviously not.
“Congratulations, Dr. Watson, you are firing on all cylinders this evening.”
There was one moment of complete, utter silence and confusion before John erupted with riotous laughter.
Ding:
“Sherlock, WHAT in the bloody hell is all this!” John thundered.
“I’m trying to pay you a bloody compliment, you prat.”
“No.”
“That last was rather a low blow, John.”
He began over again: “Lundi, Mardi, Mer-cre-diiiii…”
There are few things more revealing than observing someone who believes himself unobserved.
“Sorry, my mistake. Kettle’s just boiled.”
First he brought home an ulster, the garment beloved of many Victorian gentlemen: a long, dramatic overcoat with shoulder cape.
I know he stares at me, deduces me, just as he does everyone. He can’t help it.
“We need to get away from London for a while, John. What about week in beautiful Dartmoor?”
“John, you have come between me and my coat, which to me is a very serious…”
John was in despair: had he not found the note? If he’d found it, what was he waiting for?
“I knitted you a jumper. I learned on YouTube.”
”Because I pay handsomely for her silence.”
“Sherlock, just try it on.”
He handed Sherlock a small black and white package. Penhaligon’s Bayolea: the hallmark scent of the traditional English gentleman.
He crossed over and knelt in front of John's chair.
“Is this a proposal?”
He swiftly shed the hateful thing and flung it over John like a painter’s drop cloth.
Sherlock leaped up and said, “I was just about to make tea! Like some? No trouble, of course.”
“…marry me.”
I'm ready!
Being in a cab with Sherlock frequently meant being trapped with his theories and his obsessions, but now it was even worse because John was also trapped with Sherlock's wedding dance suggestions.
John simmered with fury but held his tongue. Sherlock was right - it was much too easy to rile him. He would not let Sherlock win a contest of wills. Again.
“Oh, and you're such a gym bunny,” Sherlock snorted.
"Sherlock, why would I need children when I have YOU."
“John, I NEED SOME.”
John strode across the sitting room, gesturing expansively:
“Dammit Sherlock.”
"Why, because I ate your popcorn while you weren't looking?"
“But we could get matching ones. Little taxicabs?”
“Hideous.”
“John, I am thoroughly familiar with all Germanic languages, as you should know. Romance languages, however, hold no interest for me.”
“Je bande pour toi.” [
“What.”
John's entire being radiated suppressed fury - then he shook his head in resignation because he was actually going to do it (
“Those ribs? Never.”
"But John - "
“Bakewell tart?”
So John did the only thing he could do, given that he was still sitting astride Sherlock's lap and only partially wearing pants and was still flushed with excitement from his performance. He leaned forward until he was millimeters from Sherlock's face, and they felt their breath mingle. Their eyes fixed upon each other with simmering desire and -
Storming restlessly about the flat one day, he spied a small red paper packet … doubtless one of John’s little indulgences, he had such a sweet tooth. Hmm, Malteasers. An inane play on words, but they looked promising enough: chocolate spheroids of crisp honeycomb covered with a smooth chocolate shell. Sherlock popped one into his mouth. The first satisfying bite, breaking through the thick sweet crust into a little universe of crunchiness. Then he popped another. Then he gobbled the rest.
“I don’t care how…NOOO!.... you try to rationalize it…..this is ….GAAAHHHHHHH!!”
“For a tattoo, John! What do you think?”
“And furthermore, John, I think you should join me in this body-enhancement scheme,” Sherlock continued.
“A bit,” John replied absently. “I really would love to dance with you at that wedding, Sherlock. I’m just not sure I can find anything we both agree on.”
“I assure you I do not smell like a hyacinth.”
“ ‘You can be my best friend, I can be your right arm.
Once again Sherlock smiled at John’s ungainly but romantic attempt at a love sonnet.
But John was hardly mollified. “Oh, you think so? Well cheers, mate, I did a bloody brilliant job for you.” He looked down at Sherlock's lap. “Quite obviously.”
Sherlock felt the vibration of John’s voice echo through his breastbone. He closed his eyes, knowing that John would safely guide him around the furniture and over the edges of the rugs, would telegraph the next turn and glide with his body. There had never been so much certainty in his life, nor such trust in one who held him close.
John clomped up the stairs with the shopping.
“I do like it, John. It’s perfect. But I think we might save this one for our own wedding dance.”
Late that afternoon Sherlock threw open the front door and leaped up the stairs to the flat, three at a time.
Holmes pitied the fact that she hadn't even bothered to remove her coat, for she could feel Watson's tears melt away the crystals of snowflakes that had collected upon her lapel. Watson didn't seem to care, wrapping her arms around the thin Holmes and falling in her despair. Holmes joined her, holding her fast in embrace as the other shook against her. A girl. A little girl. Holmes would have liked to teach a little girl a thing or two about standing up to this great and hostile world.
Watson giggled once again, through she crinkled her nose up at her friend, "If I didn't know any better...I'd fancy you were jealous."
The good doctor’s squarish jaw clenched as her demurely painted lips pouted, and Holmes couldn’t help but admire their fullness for one fleeting moment, how they looked like a poppy in heavy bloom.
Watson suddenly whirled around, pulling her arm out of her friend's and grasping her hands, staring up with those wide, jubilant eyes. My, how she glowed...
Even Watson had about half of an hour before she, too, had to scuttle off to her practice.
it's not very long, just trying to write again ya know?

The morning was cold and crisp, giving a shock of wakefulness to all who tread through it. Already the streets were busy despite the two ladies' best efforts to walk during a less active hour. It seemed the whole of London was keen on the same thing.
Holmes pushed back a fallen strand of her dark hair, huffing and puffing and
"How can I?" the taller suddenly gripped her friend's shoulders, nearly lifting the poor girl out of her boots,
And then she arrived at the door to a teary-eyed sister, who ushered the good detective in.

Holmes rose one slim brow, “And why
But Watson couldn’t help but enjoy the silence, finding herself at ease when wrapped in it, especially with how exhausted she had been as of late. But she especially enjoyed the silence with darling, dastardly Holmes, feeling serenity bound when sensing the brilliant, crackling energy the other woman gave off give way to quiet, calm when she managed to sit down, sober, not unlike the aura a cat gave off when it reposed in the sun.
Watson pouted for a long moment, considering as her robust figure seemed near to giving up against Holmes’s slender one, her bright eyes looking down to her friend’s slippered feet.

, especially now with that gentle, petite pout of hers, cracked and pink with notes of red from the oncoming dryness of the season, and then her long, slender hands upon the stationary, dark locks like the Black Forest falling over her clever, grey eyes.
Some terrible news.
Holmes stood then, carefully approaching the stupefied doctor, easily entwining her fingers around the other woman’s and leading her away from the armchair, the envelopes, the invitations like a pack of doves taking residence in their common room.
“No Romance – that is you all over, Sherlock.”
“Possibly.”
“Do without.”
“It’s something different – rather sexy, I thought.” John waggled his eyebrows with a wicked grin. “Might do you good, change your image a bit?”
“That obvious, was it?”
I’M SORRY MRS. HUDSON I’M SO SORRY
Sherlock seemed mightily pleased with himself.
“ ‘Oh, how gently we'll talk, Oh, how softly we'll tread.
“Look, you, I know you are just crazy enough to go to Buckingham Palace WITH NO PANTS ON, but I am tired of running all over London with my tackle swinging to and fro like a pendulum, even if that is your own very special sexual kink. Everything is getting chafed. And today I caught my foreskin in my zipper!”
“I SAID, this reaction is purely a distinguishing feature of mammals. As humans we develop these instincts so we don't become alarmed whenever we brush against a wall or our own clothing.”
“John, I want a tattoo.”
“GODDAMMIT SHERLOCK!”
The leather motorcycle jacket:
“Dear Sherlock: I tried and failed to come up with a suitable gift for your birthday, but if you will accept this IOU I promise to make it up to you later. With best birthday wishes and fondest love, John.”
“I have no bloody idea why the pirate wore underpants.”
“John, I wish you would stop calling me that.”
“That’s not what I meant. At all.”
Although Sherlock had always ridiculed John’s attempts at writing poetry, he was quite disappointed that John had never written any for HIM.
He threw down his newspaper and put on his own coat (which was merely a garment, with no tortured relationship bullshit attached). What he needed was to walk off his bad attitude and Sherlock's irksome and childish behavior.
"Immature!" John exploded. "Pot and kettle come to mind!"
“No, John, I’m doing well.” He rolled up his sleeves to display his bare arms. No nicotine patches. John was satisfied. Sherlock was deviously content.
“Here’s your tea, Cupcake.”
Irene Adler slithered through John’s brain.
And what COULD he be banging on about now? Surely not the delightfully dirty weekend in Brighton when they’d got all that sand in… Never mind.
He swept it up and dropped it into the kitchen bin, and at the bottom he glimpsed a telltale crumpled Malteasers packet. He truly feared for Sherlock's mental health. And his tooth enamel.
Ready, Sherlock.
“I was in Greece on a family holiday…” Sherlock began in a annoyed tone. “I was walking through a street market. A …WASP… flew up the leg of my shorts and stung me."
“No, wait! I’d like to try, if you don’t mind it being a learning experience for me. Perhaps you had best sit in my chair, it’s not as likely to collapse under our weight.”  Sherlock tugged John up from the armchair, and positioned him in his own leather chair.
“Using me as a soporific, how tedious. I can think of much better ways to help you get to sleep.”
I don’t know when you will find this message - but I want to tell you how much I love you and how much I want us to be together always. Which I suppose is my roundabout way of asking you to marry me. You probably would not want me to actually propose on bended knee, and I know you would despise any kind of cheesy engagement scenario, and I’m crap at all that anyway, so how about it?  Let’s get married. It’ll be the dog’s bollocks, I promise.
Make a few demands I'm able to fulfill…. ‘ “ John continued as he took off his jacket.
“Sherlock, I have no bloody idea how to change a flat tyre, you are totally on your own with this.”
“You’re not an idiot….well, not about most things. But…”
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?!”
John looked surprised - being attacked was part of Sherlock's curriculum vitae. So why would this be a secret?
Ding:
On his birthday morning Sherlock came yawning into the kitchen to find two steaming mugs of tea, plus a plate of warm scones sent up by Mrs. Hudson. John was cheerful and congratulatory.
“Oh, and Sherlock? My blue jumper’s gone missing. Have you – “
“U.M.Q.R.A.”
“SHERLOCK! DON’T MAKE ME SHOOT YOU!!”
“Oh I am... Oh!”
Inside the envelope was a folded piece of paper. In John’s awkward slanting handwriting was written:
“Isn’t Dr. Bell feeling a little chilly right now?”
John babbled something or other.
“Still a dough product.”
“John…why did the pirate wear underpants?”
“Pink is a very flattering color for every skin tone.”
“Forget it. You asked me not to, so I won’t. I’m just trying to help you.”
"Sherlock, your lower lip is dangerously close to my fist, so I'd be careful if I were you."
“Handcuffs?”
John looked at Sherlock with love and trepidation in his eyes, and he bravely removed his shirt, lifted Sherlock's creation gingerly and eased it over his head. The neck hole came down over his shoulders. The droopy arm tubes were both on the same side of the jumper, forcing his arms straight out in front of him. The torso was so short it ended well above his navel. It could hardly be called a garment - it was more of a mutant potholder.
The Barbour waxed cotton hunting jacket:
“Come on, Sherlock, the French language can be quite funny,” he said.
John bustled around the kitchen making tea and toad-in-the-hole for breakfast. He sang while he worked, just a little tune under his breath: “Lundi, Mardi, Mer-cre-di…Jeudi, Vendredi…Samedi, Dimaaanche…”
John stormed off again, and Sherlock trailed him home in thoughtful silence.
“Why don’t you just suck it up and wear it.”
The tea strainer zinged past Sherlock's head.
Not to be deterred, John left him a voicemail: “Ta voix sexy me fait bander comme un porc.” [
“Oh!” Sherlock said. “Like twerking. Only I sit on you while I do it.”
“Just what are you singing under your breath?” John asked later as they were undressing for bed. “Is that some sort of message for me?”
“John, short sleeves are not my area.”
“John, many people experience this exercise quite positively, so if you would just -”
Sherlock boycotted the breakfast table; John went next door to the deli for an egg and bacon butty and chips.
“So please never stop talking to me.  Or reading to me. Or even arguing with me.”
“Oh, I’ve made him angry. Perhaps now you can more fully appreciate how I feel when you call me by these loathesome pet names comparing me with food, flowers, and feathered fowl.”
"And then I sent you a text and accurately hypothesized that you would react with a predictable display of ...."
“All right, big fucking deal, that part was probably about ready to fall off anyway. We’ll just throw it in the back. Fucking wreck.”
“John, I…”
“I ate one. Problem?”
“I beg to differ, Mr. Shelduck Holmes.”
With that, Sherlock's exasperation level forced him to request a cease-fire.
John surreptitiously dried his eyes on Sherlock's shirt collar. “Don’t you like it?”
“Sherlock, I can plainly see that it’s so tight it’s constricting your circulation and you are….uh, swelling up. That is,…uh….edema is a very dangerous condition, you know….”
“Okay, but you’ll be sorry. That Bolognese sauce was bursting with garlic.”
But maintaining a sufficient reserve of his new drug was challenging. The deli next door was only good for emergencies, otherwise it would soon become obvious he was hooked on those little chocolate balls of nirvana. Asking John to buy them at Tesco would be a dead giveaway. And acquiring them piecemeal all over the city could not assure a constant daily supply. No, this had to be a wholesale operation.
“Well…I’d like…a lap dance. From you.” John’s face flushed with a bit of excitement and shy embarrassment.
“ ‘Marry me’?”
“Oh, please indulge me, John. Sometimes this is the only genuine fun I get out of life.”
“Seriously, using another person’s toothbrush is unhygienic.”
John stood up and took a menacing step toward him, hands clenched with a massive urge to circle Sherlock's neck and squeeze it until he turned blue.
John stroked Sherlock's hair again, ran a thumb over his cheekbone.
John laughed. “Well well. So it’s not only the solar system that’s escaped your notice.”
“John, we kiss one another all the time and I don’t regard that as unhygienic. And considering some of the other  …”
“Also obvious.”
“John, it’s a skill most people have, and it’s not hard to learn.”
“There’ll be dancing after…”
“MY COAT! MY COAT’S DISAPPEARED! IT’S…”
“You have one.”
“Sherlock, we can’t kiss here – it’s a crime scene!”
SHERLOCK PLEASE MARRY ME.
“John, I will buy you a new toothbrush for every day of the year as long as you promise to share my home, my bed, and my bathroom for the rest of our lives.”
John was certain it was the dog’s bollocks comment that scunnered him.
“To Marks & Spencer to buy some new, y’know, PANTS. You can just stay home and swan around in your pink banana hammock.”
“But it wouldn’t smell right!” Sherlock protested.
“John, I love this little point of hair at the nape of your neck.”
“I just found my shirt in the bed.”
So when a parade of plain brown Amazon boxes began arriving at 221B, Sherlock explained them away as “books”, “laboratory supplies” and once as a pick-and-mix assortment of carbuncles. Sherlock's closet was soon crammed with Malteasers: individual packs for on-the-go, multi-packs for out of town cases, quantity buckets for home use. Problem solved. All was well. Sherlock remained placid, John was grateful, and no one was the wiser.
“I hate having nothing between me and my trousers. It feels so ..... arousingly pervy.”
"It's bad enough that you're always talking over Netflix, but I thought at least if we went
“Tramp stamp. No.”
“Can’t. My brother’s in there.”
“John, cupcakes are wholly irrelevant to me but I ate it to please you, and since I am marginally fonder of pink sprinkles than I am of chocolate icing I merely chose the one I preferred. Stop whinging, it’s not as if I ate BOTH of them.”
John laughed. And laughed and laughed. Which only nettled Sherlock further.
John leaned back and tangled his legs with Sherlock's.
“Wait - there’s no suspect, we’re not waiting for anyone to show up - we’re just having dinner together?”
“Thank you, Sherlock. This is… the most ….er, remarkable jumper I’ve ever owned.”
“Back of a police car?”
“You really must stop eating Branston pickle before you go to bed, it always makes you so…”
“Dr. Bell made me a gift of the coat when he retired to Provence to paint watercolors and farm olive trees. He said he thought I’d have more need of it now than he did.”
"John - " Sherlock began.
“It’s a classic piece of men’s haberdashery. It has flair.”
Warm and sweet and easy, Just the simple stuff…. ‘ ”  John warbled.
“A man and his coat – reunited at last. What a heartwarming story,” John said dryly.
Silence.
“I assure you it’s no trouble – if you want some sort of dance, then a dance you shall have. Tell me what it is.” Sherlock sat up in his chair and fastened his eyes on him like a bright-eyed inquisitive squirrel.
And it’s that old woman who’s presumably now dead?” He went off into another spasm of hilarity so intense that he started coughing and turned a bright pink.
John looked at him with sudden surprise. “You don’t speak French!” he said, astonished to discover something else he knew that the great Sherlock Holmes did not.
“We’ve been asked to specify ‘our song’ for the DJ to play at the reception.”
Which of course only made the stubborn detective more determined to not admit he’d been bested at something, particularly by John Smart-Arse Watson.
“One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past…One look, and I had found my future at last…" Sherlock sang quietly to himself (but loudly enough to annoy John).
“ ’And now the purple dusk of twilight time, Steals across the meadows of my heart…’ “
“John, I am attempting but failing to reproduce the most extraordinary color known to humankind. One so exquisite it causes angels to sing and strong men to weep. A gift from the gods for one chosen mortal: the most unique eye color in all the world.”
Sherlock pulled up one side of the new pants, revealing his surprisingly muscular gluteus maximus.
More muttering. Sherlock said, “John, hush.”
“Gargalesis is a singularly mammalian phenomenon. In fact, mammalian brain evolution shows – “
“Don’t be absurd, no one leaves you voicemail.”
John just shook his head and exhaled softly. He was utterly out of sorts with Sherlock's continual whining.
“We most certainly have a song!” John insisted.
“Well, don't you think you and I should bond?”
"Also, John, since the lower lip is most erogenous because of its more numerous nerve endings..." His voice trailed off as he made additional notes.
“Pretend you’re performing the Heimlich Maneuver. In reverse.”
"And while I confess that I did it purposely, I hope you'll hear me out..."
“If I don’t get it I’ll do something desperate! GIVE ME SOME!”
Then Sherlock belatedly caught the tone in John’s voice, and he stopped writing and looked up. John's miserable, betrayed expression plainly said what even John's sharp, salty tongue could not.
YOU ARE MY SWEET PEA NO USE DENYING IT.
“As ever, you are wrinkling your handsome brow in consternation and I thought it needed to be ironed out a bit.”
The last page of the notebook was missing.
“I don't need to go stark bollocks naked, John. I have plenty of clean pants. In fact, I’m wearing some.”
John simply put his face in his hands and made an unintelligible noise.
When Sherlock caught up with him at the next corner, John was still in full flood about his cinematic sins.
“We've already bonded this morning, in case that slipped your notice. Twice.”
“Well, all right, if you insist.”

“Closer to what? Is this a clue of some sort?”
There was no room in the laundry hamper because the coat was taking a nap among the dirty socks.
“And allow you to run it through Google Translate? Nope. You’ll just have to enjoy it in audio mode.”
John faced him down, hands on hips. “Are you going to get dressed today? Or are you just going to lie around moaning in your dressing gown again?”
“Not going. Send my regrets and something suitable from Conran’s,” Sherlock said from the depths of the sofa.
"It was years ago,“ he commenced. “In Greece. I was wandering through a public marketplace ...and I was set upon and attacked."
Ding:
“Dammit, Sherlock, I thought Range Rovers all came with automatic transmissions these days.”
“John, you unraveled me long ago.” Sherlock smiled at him.
"Jesus, Sherlock, just what the hell was that all about?"
WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM DUBLIN TONIGHT YOU WILL REGRET THIS NONSENSE.
John waltzed around the room stacking papers and books.
“As ever, Sherlock, you listen --  but you do not HEAR.”
“You mean you have never had it cleaned?” Fastidious John shivered.
“What’s wrong with that?”
“Yeah you do.”
“I have no one to consult about these things - so as ever, I turned to science for an answer."
“What was that?”
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” John woke him from a fuzzy little catnap.
“You’re addicted to SWEETS now?”
“That is most certainly NOT me all over,” Sherlock replied curtly.
He closed his eyes to screen out the cruel, cruel world.
After a long silence John pulled gently on one of his curls. "I'm just your personal petri dish, am I?"
Sherlock gave John a malicious side-eye. “Aren’t you getting tired of your pointless little game?”
"Seriously, Sherlock! I really do not need to know that THE VELOCIRAPTOR SCREECH IN 'JURASSIC PARK' IS A RECORDING OF TORTOISES HAVING SEX!"
Sherlock regarded John with an ardent glint in his eye. “But meanwhile…talk dirty to me again.”
“No, you're light as a feather. You can begin any time now…” John sighed and rolled his eyes at Sherlock's back.
At last John could endure the emotional torment no longer, and asked Sherlock for the loan of his notebook.
“John, could you not. I’m quite serious.”
“What are you getting at - a romantic stay in a B&B? More breaking and entering into restricted military bases?”
TU ES L’HOMME DE MES RÊVES [
“Yes, indeed, John, I am perfection in human form. Never have I felt better, more focused, more acute in my observations. No cigarettes, no nicotine patches, no sugar highs for me – I am now clean and free of foreign substances. You did me the greatest favor of my life by throwing away the poison that was destroying me. Thank you.”
“John, I have no idea what you think you can smell, since I dislike cologne and all of my personal hygiene products are unscented.”
“GODDAMMIT JUST QUIT IT!!!”
20 seconds... Blood vessels dilated all over John's body, suffusing him with a faint flush and making every nerve end burn like a lighted fuse. His breath came faster. He shifted his weight against Sherlock and his clutching hands pulled Sherlock's shirt right out of his trousers.
John came home hours later with a white plastic carrier bag of takeaway curry and an improved attitude. Annoyingly Happy Sherlock was far less irritating than Tediously Whiny Sherlock, he had decided. And if Sherlock’s coat was something of a security blanket for him, then so be it. It might be just the one thing that was keeping him (relatively) sane, and who was John to judge him for that.
“Bell’s knackered. Better go down and see, don’t want to miss a client.”
Sherlock was resistant, which was putting it mildly.
And although John couldn’t see it now, Sherlock’s smile was the very same one he'd worn that night: the smile which had begun unlocking John Watson’s frozen heart, and perhaps his own as well.
Sherlock caught him by the arm.
“I don’t HAVE to do anything.”
“If you…had music...” Sherlock whispered. “My favorite is…’You Sexy Thing’… by a group I believe is called... Hot Chocolate?” After which he could not hold it in any longer, and a smile cracked his face. His body heaved with barely suppressed laughter.
“You are not.”
“I did not attend Eton, which you very well know.”
“Heard that.”
Both our lives began all over again then, John thought, on a night when all of London was ours and everything was possible. He felt abruptly overcome with a hot rush of emotion that made him bury his face in Sherlock's neck.
“Matching tattoos?”
“Say it in French and I will.” John served Sherlock his egg. Sherlock glared at him and stabbed it with a fork, right in the middle of the yolk.
“Sounds intriguing. And who is your suspect then?”
John looked up to find Sherlock standing in the kitchen doorway, headphones hanging around his neck and a tiny smile lurking about his mouth. Sherlock approached him and leaned down, saying: “T’as une miette”. [
John lowered the newspaper and looked at Sherlock over the top of the page. “So you’re really serious about not going unless I can find a song you like.”
“That was just me saying, um, ‘Hey’. Now – again please.”
With much love – John
" - because I needed to gauge your increasing irritation against your heightened determination to resist, and I correctly deduced that you'd elect to put up with the intensification of negative stimuli rather than to deny yourself the potential pleasure of seeing the film. Then I escalated the pressure and ate your popcorn. Well, not 'ate' exactly - I just dumped most of it on the floor."
“U.M.Q.R.A.?”
"Goddammit Sherlock…" Somehow a tea mug shattered in the kitchen sink.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, knowing he was about to step off a cliff. The whisky had muted the guardian of his brain and tongue; he was dangerously close to revealing a long-concealed secret. But this was John, a man he trusted above all others, one with whom he could share the deepest mysteries of his heart.
“Sorry, not interested.”
John lowered the newspaper.
Or perhaps that unforgettable incident in the Scottish Highlands, in a particularly scratchy patch of heather…
John was usually a proponent of tough love where Sherlock's temper was concerned. But against his better judgment, he presented a number of coat-alternatives in an attempt to placate him.
There. Sherlock was bound to find this modest scribbled memo eventually - sooner rather than later, John hoped. He wished he could be there when that happened, but on the other hand there was no telling how Sherlock would react, so perhaps just leave this little lovebomb ticking away and hope for the best.
“What poem?”
“Remember last year’s ambulance strike?”
“I did ask. Repeatedly. You were beginning to look – and smell - like an undercover drug addict again.”
“Oh! Right, then. Let’s run.”
“No, well not just yet, I hope. I simply love listening to your voice. It’s the most glorious sound in the world. It’s so comforting, so deep and dark and rich. Like a melted chocolate bar. The kind in the black wrapper.”
I AM VERY FLATTERED DEAR BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH SHERLOCK??
“Sherlock, what if I told you that your voice is the very last thing I want to hear before I die. The last thread of consciousness I will hold onto before …”
John stepped over Sherlock, hauled him up by the back of his collar and flung him into the chair. He wore the menacing half smile of threatening amusement that Sherlock knew so well.
(delete)
“Dead body.”
Sherlock began humming loudly but failed to drown out John’s performance. John leaned over Sherlock's shoulder and reached for some stray tea mugs.
“Eton mess?”
Sherlock shouted: “SEX!”
“Come to bed, love.”
“There’s a definite scent – I can even smell it on your clothes.”
“Sherlock, you are a complete drama queen…” John barely got that out before subsiding into belly laughs again.
"Oh you bastard."
“Fine. You’re happy. I’d be happy if you’d quiet down and go to sleep.”
“ONE PACKET AT A TIME, Sherlock!”
Sherlock was knitting John a jumper.
“Mrs. Hudson! Got any Malteasers?”
"An apology would be a good start," John said bitterly, cocking an eyebrow at him.
You promise whatever you like, I'll never collect.
“Look where you’re going! You almost hit that other one!”
“My favorite one is ‘avoir la patate’, or ‘to have the potato’. Meaning, to feel exceptionally good.”
“Sh ….marry you. Me. Sherjrglnczzz…”
“JOHN! IT’S GONE!”
“I SAID…..iewrofdjbzzz.”
“What the hell is that? Some kind of metrosexual banana hammock?”
“OUT.”
“You’re not a couple, Sherlock!” John laughed.
“Well, I might point out that we would not HAVE a flat tyre if you were….never mind.”
“There's always the bus.”
Then there was the Burberry mac:
I LOVE YOU SHERLOCK, WILL YOU MARRY ME?
“What would our life be like if, every time we bumped into something, we would startle ourselves? Everyone would be extremely goofy. I cannot afford to work with a goofy colleague.”
“We’re sitting in front of an enormous window, visible to anyone within a 3-block area, on a so-called date THAT YOU TRICKED ME INTO. And now you want me to kiss you?”
“Or…!”  Sherlock swiveled around to the front again and pulled down one side of the new pants, revealing the tender flesh of his groin.
“A bluebell then. Something that grows in the woods.”
“Goodnight, love. I’ll see you in the morning.”
John raised the newspaper he was reading, hid his face and enjoyed a silent laugh.
“I wasn’t snooping. I was deducing. You have never been the most demonstrative of men, John. You only write poetry when you are in love, although your previous discernment of “love” was merely flawed thinking on your part. Girlfriends are apparently not your area either, something which is blindingly obvious to both of us. My birthday was imminent, and poetry of a sort was openly in view. Ergo: birthday poem.”
He and John sat before the fire like two gentlemen in a Victorian print. The flames crackled, the clock ticked, the contents of the decanter slowly diminished. It was the hour of quietude, a time for confidences.
Swearing to deny his own indulgences, John set out to fetch home some healthier food.
“So I see. Again.”
“I still do not need any pony-sized holes in the fucking windscreen.”
“Donovan warned you off then.” Sherlock accurately surmised when they were back in step.
“What if he’s boring?”
“It would be a hell of a lot better than the alternative, sir.” John wasn’t stupid and wasn’t about to ask for more than was critical to his sanity. The laws were entrenched, and though he trusted Major Sholto more than almost anyone he knew, he was still an alpha. There would be limits to his sympathy. “She signed him on, and the registry’s got a copy. I know I’m stuck with him, sir. It’s fine, I can make do. What I really care about is not giving up a career that matters to me just to be his plaything.” That was probably more than had been wise to share, but it was true.
Sherlock had the audacity to bristle, “Obviously not.”
Mycroft’s smile widened. “Your cooperation and gratitude would be appreciated, and sufficient.”
“Baring abuse, what more is there?” Ultimately, they would own him, and for John, a cage was going to be a cage, no matter who held it. The next stage of his life was all about managing expectations. “They’re all going to want the same thing, give or take, and I care about my career.” He shrugged, taking another bite of kebab. “It’s not that I can’t be attracted to alphas, even if I don’t want a relationship with one. The kind I attract are tossers, though hopefully Mycroft’s choice won’t be my usual ‘type.’ The one before Mycroft, Victor, was a bastard, but only an extreme example of a common trend for me.”
John DID NOT want to get into the implication of that. Thankfully, Sherlock interrupted and John gave a sigh of relief.
Mycroft proceeds to sit on John's chair and his-bodyguards?- men stand at each side of the door. When Eurus is inside the house, one of them closes the door behind. She was wearing a tight silk black bodycon dress, two straps in lieu of sleeves, high cleavage at the top, lacy embroidery at the hems, and the ends just hugging at her thighs, complimenting her figure. She had done her hair nice and wavy, and adorned her lips with cherry red lipstick. Oh god. John could not deny she looked-
"Don't touch me!" His voice was almost desperate now. "Rosie, please tell me she is okay."
Eurus smirked. "Do not mistake it as a deed of
"Ah, can I come in please?", John says. He had done a great deal of walking and it didn't help that his arse was already sore.
I am so so sorry for being late in updating the work. I was really busy with exams so please  forgive me.
"No questions shall be changed Sherlock, Answer or Quit", she pouts.
Skimming the streets, John quickly realised a black sedan was parked in front and the lackeys in the flat wore black uniform just like Mycroft's minions. His face paled as realization dawned on him.
"What? No. I quit."
"John, I'm sure we're sticking around long enough for that."
John is dumbstruck. This is the weirdest shit he has heard all his life. He can't help laughing, a monsterous one to be specific. "Whh what", he speaks as he continues laughing. "Eurus, firstly this is the most unromantic thing I've ever heard and secondly, what are you playing at? What bat shit game is this?"
“Who are his other suitors?”
“Flaunting what Sherlock?” John folded the newspaper civilly and gave the other his full, defiant, attention.
“No, it’s…fine.” Sherlock had been trying not to look pleased, and let it slip for a moment. But the expression was gone in an instant as the crime tech and DI approached the pair of them.
The man’s eyes widened at that, gleaning something other than John’s meaning from the words. What, John couldn’t reckon, so he pulled out supplies from his kit while the stranger elaborated. “He hasn’t told me anything. But you are a ranking military doctor, recently returned for leave, newly and somewhat closely affiliated with him.” A statement, not a question. The stranger’s eyes narrowed, as if doing so would bring John’s history into clearer focus. “You don’t work for Mycroft.”
I probably should have explained this in the last chapter notes for people not familiar with them, but I assume fictional suppressants are like real birth control, and have different forms with different characteristics. I'm a bad writer for clarifying in the notes instead of the story, but just know that for this world, shot suppressants, which John was on, are more like a hybrid of IUDs and shot birth control, in that they last long term without any heats.
Which was working.
Sherlock was wound like a spring by the time they arrived at the crime scene. He was snapping at everyone and nearly reduced a new crime tech to tears. When he rudely departed the scene, John had to run to catch up with him.
“Retired Colonel Sebastian Moran, which again I’m sure John said. As with all things I put my mind to, I excelled at matchmaking. Moran is respected, well paid, and very supportive of John’s military career.”
John placed his hand on the back of Sebastian’s neck, and pulled him in for the kiss. He closed his eyes as their lips touched.
“Of course, but we can sort out the minutia of the first session in a moment.” She gave him a penetrating look. “In agreeing to this, I am trusting that you know what you are doing regarding John. And his tolerance for this arrangement.”
“Not one of my better one’s unfortunately. Simply my body and its redundant, inefficient needs. I do what I must to keep it functioning, but no more. I can go days with out food or sleep. Or speaking.”
“You know I am the reason this happened.” Sherlock paused, then softer, “You know that. You saw me.”
Strictly speaking, John
Sherlock scowled, “You are being predictably unreasonable about this, John. But I shouldn’t have expected better.” The hot lead in John’s stomach burned white
“So, don’t run away from whoever you pick for me, and say yes when you ask for future favors. You could have just said.” Watson rose and approached him. “Should I ask how Major Sholto got your help and what legal trickery you pulled to get me out from Trevor? Or is plausible deniability a crucial part of the game at this stage?”
“So long as you let me stay in the RAMC, I’m open to anything.”
“And what does your good doctor think about this? Or are you still working on a strategy to ring out every straight impulse from his fine form?”
John hated the sound of that. “You won’t be able to lift them. They’re military grade, and I still have months before I need a new shot.”
“These standards are a new, based on your dating history and I can’t be expected to keep track of your fickle tastes. Blaming me for your arbitrary reactions to essentially the same activity you prioritize every other day is exhausting, John.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“No, of course.” The Major looked moderately embarrassed by the idea. “Though I think using an alpha of Watson’s acquaintance would be sensible. Nevertheless, I would be satisfied with any honorable executor of this summit’s decision. I certainly do not insist it be me, only someone with his interests in mind.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“This is how I’ve always dressed in front of you. I’ve had this shirt since I was in the army. What’s wrong with it now? And Mrs. Hudson bought me the cologne, I’m not chucking it.”
“Your alpha is having you retire from service?”
“Well if it is a concern, drugs could be useful. A vasodilator and an inhibition lowering agent would guarantee the best results.”
“Basically. You know the classic set up. Most alphas want to come home to someone submissive. I can’t play act at that, never could or wanted to, which is naturally a turn off. But there’s a type of alpha who goes for pushback. Loves the idea they managed to pin down a challenge. Absolute gits, usually idiots.” He smirked at Sherlock, “Well, more than the average population, by your standards. Anyway, I draw ‘em like flies.”
“Fuck. I mean call your CO, obviously, but as far as people with pull, I don’t know. I’ll need to think.”
“Ridiculous.”
“Brother mine, this is a pleasant if unexpected visit. Please stop harassing my omega and do come join me.” John hadn’t noticed Mycroft step up behind him.
Mycroft should have consulted him on the candidates. He knew John better and was certain the alpha his cow of a sibling picked was the wrong choice. He looked boorish from the service photos and was too tall for John. The entire situation was moronic. John would be made to mate with a stranger to protect him from having strangers try to mate with him. He should have stolen John’s papers from Mycroft and forged the signature of someone currently in the morgue. Why hadn’t he thought of that before they were out of Mycroft’s clutches?
∙ ∙ ∙
Irene’s delight was unbridled. "But there is no need for you to be in the audience, handsome. A complete waste, honestly. No, I think we would both prefer you on center stage.”
“Sounds like you’re in a good position to have a long, successful career, Captain. It frustrates me to think you might have been prevented from pursuing it.”
The woman must have looked triumphant.
[ No -SH ]
He wrapped things up with Bill, who would pick him up later in the day. John decided to give himself the next three hours to research before calling Major Sholto. He’d prefer to come to the Major with a plan, not a problem, but by the end of his time limit he’d knew he’d failed that goal. He could barely stand to picture what the Major would think of him after this.
John ignored the stranger, and resolved to take a roundabout path, not wanting to be tailed to Mycroft’s office. But he didn’t get the chance. The man gabbed John’s arm, stopping him as soon as they were clear of the lift area. “Slow down there, you pretty thing, you’ve been riling me up since the queue.”
“Piss off.”
“I don’t know how you’ve kept your sanity.”
Their current case had led them to the morgue at St. Bart’s, where John was pleasantly surprised to reconnect with his old classmate, Mike Stamford, and meet Molly Hopper, the source of the foot. Her perfectly demure nature did make John feel a little inadequate; she was just such a model omega. Still, she was charmingly awkward, clearly of the kidney sacrificing variety where it came to Sherlock, and smelled light and sweet (like lemon drizzle, if you could compare a person’s scent to such a thing) which John thought appealing. He liked her almost at once, though he would have been hard pressed not to feel a kinship with any other unbonded omega in their shared field.
John makes a plan.
“Obviously, I’m here for sex, John.”
John raised his eyebrows and she pressed on. “He’s not paid to be here you know. He does it for fun. Because he’s a psychopath.”
John smiled at that. Though he thought the police didn’t consult amateurs, Sherlock hardly seemed like one. He finished with disinfectant and bandaging. With the regained freedom of movement Sherlock snatched his phone up close to his face and began typing rapidly. It forcibly reminded John of Victor and he tried to shake the unpleasant memory while he repacked his kit.
“Sherlock,” John said, ignoring Anderson entirely. “I think you should look at this. He’s had something identifying taken off his inner arm, maybe a tattoo, and its healed over. It must have been on purpose, the lines are too clean, and removing this much skin would have called for grafts, but he clearly hasn’t had any.”
John arrived promptly at one of several impressive government buildings where he regularly met Mycroft. Behind him in the security queue, an alpha was talking loudly on his phone, and John was close enough to hear both sides of the conversation (a boon to national security this one is). John didn’t step forward though, lest he crowd the beta in front of him, and once through the machines, he joined the others flocking onto the lift.
“No, it doesn’t, but as you’re clearly not a fan I don’t see why it would matter to you.”
, probably, if they were feeling kind, which people rarely were when it came to things like this.
My earliest idea of this story was just a one off of this scene, where it was Sherlock who had John's papers, and Sholto was debating Mycroft to try to free John. But then I realized I could use Victor, because I love Sherlock and wanted him to be a good guy, which kicked everything into a bigger arc. Once that was decided, it made more sense to pull back Mycroft's role (gotta give the man a sense of drama) and provide other characters to fight it out with Sholto. Hope this wasn't too annoying.
John tossed up his hands in frustration, deciding it didn’t matter. This was probably an experiment anyway, he’d find out what was really going on eventually.
“I would be disappointed if you didn’t.”
Emancipation, when an omega held their own papers, wasn’t unheard of. It regularly occurred when a bonded omega’s alpha died, and if any unbonded omega could manage it, it would be John Watson. But James knew better than to ask for such. He put on his most placating voice. “I would never suggest something like that. I simply feel that returning his ownership to his sister would be best for all involved. It was a foolish, possibly inebriated, error on her part to give her brother up.”
That was well enough to be getting on with, and John decided it was time to get moving. Knowing Victor’s address didn’t give him much sense of where he was without a map and he needed to get oriented in the city to plan his next move. John pulled on his coat, threw the bag over his shoulder, and dropped the folded letter on Victor’s chest. After all, John would have to see the alpha again, and frankly he couldn’t resist—strictly speaking, it wasn’t a very polite missive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My, my, John. You’ve been driving alphas mad tonight, haven’t you?” Sebastian leered over him, nose brushing his hair as John stood with his back to the door. Not good for a retreat.
Sherlock did not enjoy scenting John. The purpose was to mark one’s territory, dissuade other alphas, but it left John smelling like Sherlock rather than himself. The notes of John’s own scent were very pleasant, and Sherlock did not relish stifling them.
“I have considered it, he would excel there. But I may find another need for him one day, so I am leaving my options open. And don’t feel left out. You know my offer for your employ there always stands.
Sherlock shot his brother an annoyed look, as if he had interrupted a deeply private conversation. “You are only tied to him by a legal technicality. And I didn’t come here to speak with you.”
“Then I’ll be glad to have my deployments. Better than being stuck with someone like that year-round.”
“You as well, John.”
“But you resent the prospect.”
And the floodgates were open.
“How did you get this?”
“Captain, it is a pleasure to see you again.” Oh, there was the winning smile. He wanted more of those.
The idea alone was making it hard for Sherlock to master his arousal. But he did need to clarify. “I will not be touching John during our first session. That would hinder his physiological response.”
“Does John even like him?”
“Do you know this from experience?”
“I’m not.”
John found his presumed patient pouting on the couch, cradling a badly cut forearm in a stained flannel. Must have been told a doctor was coming, he didn’t look distressed. John glanced around. Nice place, bit messy. As for the patient, late twenties or early thirties, pale, curly black hair, sharp features, alpha. John wondered if this was an audition with one of Mycroft’s candidates. If it was, the man didn’t look keen. Good. That meant John was excused from any weak attempts to be a respectable show dog and could focus on patching him up. The man’s glare made John doubtful he’d even agree to let the injury be treated, but that was fine. John could handle unruly patients.
“No sir, not- not exactly. At least I don’t think he did anything when I was unconscious. I was dressed when I woke up.” John didn’t want to leave an opening for the Major to ask about what had happened when he was conscious, so he pushed on. “The alpha said he was trying to find a way to lift my suppressants first. And in any case, I can’t file charges, against him, can I, sir?”
“The name is John, actually. And I volunteered. If you’ll excuse us, Sherlock’s been asked to consult here.” He marched past her under the police tape and Sherlock had to feign an air of expecting nothing less, while Donovan scowled in surprise. Sherlock sidled up to match John’s pace, and the latter whispered, “Thank god you didn’t stay to chat with her. I have no idea where I’m going.” That drew a smile from Sherlock, who thought his recruit was doing very nicely so far.
This didn’t seem to placate Sherlock, who, as always, was itching for a fight.
“Temporarily? Why would-” John broke off his words with a forced cough. He didn’t think it likely a better offer was coming. Hell, he’d have found a way to manage with Trevor if the prick had let him stay in the army. He could make anything work. “I’d be amenable to that, assuming it’s been signed off by the council Major Sholto appealed to. What would you want in exchange? I’d mention the pension, but you don’t look like the type interested in that.”
“Where are you going?”
“And he only did that because he’s bored. But that won’t always be enough for him, so stay away.”
Mycroft debated denying it, but it was better to head off his brother’s curiosity. “He is taking a post with the SIS. He had competitive offers from other global agencies, and his skill set is very valuable. I will be able to keep a close eye on him, and John, and your nation will retain a very skillful asset.” Mycroft thought the entire endeavor had been so successful, he was considering setting up an off the books omega exchange system. John, after all, could hardly be the only one in such a predicament. He’d drafted a little piece of legislation that wouldn’t ruffle feathers but could give him an elegant legal loop hole to go ahead with such a thing, just in case.
Sherlock was standing in front of the hearth, flushed and clearly fully erect.
James nearly gagged as he finished the statement. The rush of alpha pheromones his comment had elicited from the room was staggering. The alphas’ scents clearly said they wanted to prove they were up to the challenge of this feisty, desirable omega. Weren’t these types supposed to like the delicate ones? And these people hadn’t even met John. Massive egos indeed, though perhaps he should have avoided phrases like ‘bed warming.’ Still, it gave him an idea.
They’d come to their stop inside the limits of the docks. The sounds of water and birds filled their silence. Sherlock stayed quiet and John recomposed himself. Finally, the latter jerked his head toward the metal shipping containers. “Look, it doesn’t matter. Aren’t we supposed to be looking for clues here?”
John chuckled, unable to help himself. “You’re right.” The wound was now clean, and John picked up the  lidocaine to numb it, looking at his patient in a new light. “That was amazing, by the way. All that you just worked out?”
The alphas efficiently made their marks and the three adjourned for a festive dinner, far swankier than any John would have chosen. He ended the evening with a warm handshake from Sebastian.
“Not really. I’m open to the preferences of my omega, of course, but I’ve never seen myself as much of family man. Course, my own father left it up to my mother, and ended up enjoying the role, so maybe I could change. But no, don’t care about keeping up the family line.”
“Not at all.”
“What? Oh, no it’s-” John coughed. “I just, in the past I’ve mostly dated betas. Always tried to avoid getting courted by alphas. Wouldn’t bond at all if I could help it.”
“Yes, most omegas don’t put it off as long as you have by accident. Or at all. Your army training would have helped counteract the issue of your scent.”
In the car ride home with Mycroft, John received a text from Sherlock.
∙ ∙ ∙
The "Airstrip One has Wi-Fi” bit is just a reference to 1984, where Airstrip One was the name for the British isles, and Big Brother jabs just work too easily for Mycroft.
“John, stop feigning ignorance.”
“Toss them. Less important than the foot.”
Sherlock simply maintained his maddening silence, so John (stupidly) continued giving him the benefit of the doubt. “Cheers for that, but I doubt this was a team decision.”
They made their way home in silence.
John’s last words in edgewise had been, “You wear suits two sizes too small and I’m the ‘indecorous’ one!?”
“I might just be his friend.”
Sebastian liked hearing those words on John’s lips.
Eventually he could hear rustling (Sherlock cleaning himself he supposed). Sherlock still said nothing, though apparently permitted to. Minutes passed. Then, from the creak of a nearby floorboard, John knew Sherlock was standing over him.
Watching John orgasm was damn sexy on its own and it could have finished Sebastian if he weren’t already spent. He’d have to make John come first next time. He released John’s wrists and leveraged his body off the other, wedging himself in the space between John and the back of the couch. He brought a hand to rest on John’s other side, ensuring he didn’t get pushed onto the floor.
“You are not boring.”
“Yes, and therein lies the misfortune. John, we can take our leave now.” He strode off with purpose and John had to hasten to follow him.
They’d ended up giggling like school boys while they waited for the police, John affectionately called him an idiot, and Sherlock felt a strong buzz. As John inspected the stiches, Sherlock decided that the man’s presence was helpful. He was handy in a pinch and it was easier to push oneself if there was someone to impress. Someone who could appreciate his skill. It truthfully hadn’t taken longer than leaving Mycroft’s home for Sherlock to admit he was disposed toward the omega, puzzle pieces aside. By the time night was falling, and they were walking through the city, talking easily, Sherlock knew he liked the man.
“In what terms do you think of it?” They came to a stop.
“I’ll bet. But it helps our case that no one can claim you assaulted him. Better for him too, given the world of hurt you would have put on him in a fair fight.”
Sherlock hesitated a fraction of a second, then finally moved behind John to cut the ropes.
“No, luckily Mr. Elliot is not on my list, so I will excuse your lapse of composure. Now, if you will follow me, I would like to introduce Erica Valencia.”
John looked a little stiff as he said, “You want children, then.”
“Why are neither alpha here, to speak for themselves and give their sides?” Miller asked.
“I observed. Your haircut and posture say military, your tan says sun, but it doesn’t extend past your wrists or collar, so not on holiday. Deployment then, either Afghanistan or Iraq, and an omega at your age suggests career, thus active and ranking. Oddly unbonded. Doctor is obvious, given my injury level, who sent you, and the skill you are currently demonstrating. You came at his directive, but you called him Mycroft, too casual for his line of work, and you didn’t give me a fake name. But you are sporting a new phone, the same kind his staff uses. You wouldn’t spring for something expensive like that yourself, yet you don’t know who I am. Thus, you haven’t known Mycroft long, are somehow entangled with him but not professionally, then why…No. Impossible.”
Moran huffed out a laugh at that. “Hardly, Holmes. I’m just wondering what sort of mess this is going to be when your little brother decides he wants his borrowed omega back. And I don’t fancy the wrath I’m like to face from you when I need to teach your brother the meaning of boundaries, since you clearly haven’t.” Sebastian was of a height with Mycroft, and physically capable of instilling such lessons.
“Is that a euphemism?”
“I don’t think you need an alpha.”
“I want to kiss you John, have wanted to since I first laid eyes on you. But I’m not angling for a headlock.”
“John does not know the full scope of my desires. But I have always found him to be amenable to my plans. Your presence, while very welcome, is sure to be something of a sticking point initially, as will the concept of a
“I am charged with John’s welfare, as we well know you are not. I do not know if I approve of you absconding with him.”
“They let you out from the toff!?”
“Afghanistan,” John replied, and after a beat, “How much has Mycroft told you? Because he hasn’t even given me your name.”
“Didn’t need to, sir. He got high on something last night, left him completely out of it. It was tempting though.”
“Indeed, John. Why does this host not notice the clear markers of shared linage? The shoes alone could tell you they are half-sisters, whatever the mother says.”
Parker poked at a line in the dossier. “When Captain Watson awoke, he fled from his new alpha did he not? So, the restraints were a sound precaution. All in all, it sounds like these alphas knew Watson was prone to hysterical behavior and were acting as any sensible caregivers would by drugging him. They were clearly taking the necessary measures to ensure his safe transfer. It’s unseemly for an omega to be unbonded at his age, in any case. Lucky he was not unwillingly bonded before his sister found him a suitable mate.”
A respectable one, for once.
“Finally decided you wanted a taste?”
The man was caught off guard. “Ah,” his eyes flicked to meet John’s and held there a moment, before darting away, “yes, I did. But that’s not what people normally say.”
John was wearing those jeans again. The flattering ones. And he never could be bothered to wear a coat long enough to cover his whole form. Sherlock pulled his own coat around himself tighter, annoyed. Why did John do these things in front of him? He had no intent of attracting Sherlock, his dating history had made that clear.
“Harry, it’s John.” He was proud for not shouting ‘how could you do this,’ though he badly wanted to.
“None for you?” John was offering to buy him dinner. Thoughtful.
“Do you know you do that out loud?”
This was getting into the weeds of bullshit much faster than James had planned, and he couldn’t let Parker skew their perception of John.
“No, that will not be necessary,” was all the response he got to that. John couldn’t think how to press the matter without being rude, so decided to let it go. He thumbed through the phone and saw that his contacts were already populated with ‘William Murray,’ ‘Harriet Watson,’ ‘Maj. James Sholto,’ ‘Mycroft,’ and someone called ‘Anthea.’ He couldn’t stop the chuckle as he muttered, “Airstrip One has Wi-Fi.” He didn’t see the small smile that won from Mycroft, who was typing on his own phone. John prepared for a quiet remainder of the ride, but it ended before he’d really had the chance.
He tried her three more times, with no answer. Typical. Oh Harry, he sighed and cradled the phone to his chest, fighting back a well of emotion. A horrible part of him was glad she was hiding. He almost couldn’t bear the thought of seeing her face to face right now. He could do it once he’d gotten everything worked out. He shook his head sadly but shoved it down. He was on a time limit. Next up was Bill.
Lestrade stepped away to speak with a crime tech who had appeared on the landing, which gave John the chance to privately ask Sherlock, “Right, what medical advice I’m I meant to provide for this corpse then?”
As for his new Alpha, things continued in the same distant manner. Mycroft seemed partial to a shared breakfast over other meals, and morning was the only time John regularly saw him. His alpha seemed to have a ‘many hands make labors light’ stance toward those in his court, and John was now a member. He received occasional phone contact from Mycroft or his main assistant, Anthea, (famously of his phone’s contact list), with instructions or errands. Anthea also had a habit of coming up behind John in public and plucking his elbow to get his attention before collecting him from the location. Again, he had a perfectly good phone, but her presence apparently better ensured speedy compliance, over a suggestion. The bulk of John’s errands involved coming to an office so Mycroft could introduce an alpha. But other than that, John was as free as he’d been with Harry. He relished the disinterest, knowing it wouldn’t likely be shared by his future mate. And it was well into his stay before Mycroft commissioned his medical expertise.
So that was obviously a problem.
“So, your interest in this-”
“Uh, I don’t really think of it in those terms,” John said, hands deep in his pockets. “What’s the shipping terminal we’re looking for called again? London Container or something equally unhelpful, yeah?”
“John?”
It shocked James more than he’d like to admit to learn that he’d been speaking to an audience of one. And his delight at realizing he’d won their support was only slightly mitigated by the unsettling knowledge that Mycroft Holmes was far more than he appeared.
“Like food?”
“Why don’t you sound sure.”
∙ ∙ ∙
John flailed but the alpha laughed at him “Fuck, you’re going to smell incredible when I bond you.”
Anderson frowned, “What are you talking about?”
“So, you getting turned on by other people scenting me, is that going to be a problem when I need you to do it next time I’m undercover?”
“John, I am going to be completely straight with you. I don’t know of any mechanism to prevent an alpha from withdrawing their omega. But I promise you, I will do everything in my power to keep you enlisted.”
“Sir, John Watson here. Wanted to give you an update. And thank you, for everything today.”
waitress named Jenny currently on shift as
“They’ve been acting like idiots as usual, no doing needed on my part,” John said, purposely sharp.
“No, just transport.” They continued the stroll.
Sherlock abruptly marched off, choosing not to dignify John’s flippant disregard for his feelings.
∙ ∙ ∙
“Are you bothered by that?”
An alpha named Parker piped in. “This is still a purely personal matter. Why are you agreeing to meddle in the private lives of your men, Major Sholto?”
“I sometimes must fake it for a case, but no, the whole thing, sentiment, mating, and the like.” He waved a hand as if to dismiss the silly notions. “I don’t engage in such.”
“I rarely use it for food, it is a non-issue.”
“I don’t mind.” John dropped in, though he suspected his opinion didn’t matter. Sherlock however looked triumphant. “Excellent, there you go. We must be off.”
But Miller cut him off, shaking her head. “No, I agree with Winifred. The precedent is not acceptable, and I will not support a resolution of this council that results in Ms. Watson regaining her claim. Frankly, I do not see that she is a better choice. And at least Trevor wants him and intends to bond him.”
“Then why are you allowing Mycroft to select someone for you?”
“Hello, my name is John Watson. Do you mind if I take a look at that cut?” John didn’t wait for a response before removing his coat and rolling up his sleeves. He’d decided to opt for efficiency in his bedside manner with this one.
The omega grabbed their cocks together in one hand and oh god that felt good. Sebastian looked into John’s face, but his expressive eyes were closed again. Still, he enjoyed watching the pleasure play out there. John continued stroking them together, working his hips into the motion and, following his lead, Sebastian spit into his own palm and added his hand to the fray. Jesus, that was good. The precum and saliva were enough and soon Sebastian was working himself against their hands without restraint.
John’s stomach may as well have turned to stone like the floor.
“Ah, while it may be one of his patients or brothers in arms, I suspect you are picking up traces of my younger brother, Sherlock. My brother is a private detective and has been using the good doctor’s medical knowledge to assist with cases for Scotland Yard.”
They stopped, so John could buy a kebab from a street vendor.
“I hadn’t met him before yesterday, sir.”
“No, you may leave him.”
John huffed a laugh. “He’s currently hunting for his replacement. Seems like a perfectionist, though, I doubt it will a terrible option.”
“Oi, food is necessary, quit tempting me to force feed you. But you don’t date or court at all, then?”
Sherlock just stared at him, blankly.
“Afternoon, pretty,” the stranger cut in, though he didn’t even look up from his phone.
Lestrade directed them to the shared shower room and explained, “These are the quarters for LSE’s international graduate students. And this,” he gestured to the prone figure on the tiled floor, “is our victim, twenty-five-year-old beta, Ramone Ricci, of New Jersey, according to the school’s records. Hang on a mo.”
Victor just snorted. “I don’t care about your pension. What good is that if I can’t have you here when I want you? And it wouldn’t make a dent next to what my trust fund pays out. Congratulations, by the way, you just graduated to the ranks of the gainfully unemployed.”
“Your constant screams for attention are not appreciated.”
However, that was still hours away and John couldn’t chance sleep, so he made a pot of the overpriced coffee in the cabinet and quietly killed time. He took a hot shower, tried to ignore the hickies on his neck, and cleaned Victor’s cum off his clothes, as best he could. That left him feeling more normal. Then John collected supplies, planed his contacts, and penned a letter to his new alpha.
The summit, as James Sholto had come to think of it, was boiling down to a face-off between too many stuffed shirts vs a small handful of military officers. Following his petition, it was decided that the ultimate outcome would be deferred to this council. The whole thing had been thrown together with top speed, but he thought the dossier his team had put together was compelling. Representing John’s interests in person, aside from James, were only those few who could be spared on such short notice. It meant his three co-representatives were not fully prepped for the battering that was about to unfold. James told them to just look like they agreed with anything he said and not speak unless he directed them to.
“Precisely. Unnecessary, distracting.”
“Where are you, now? I’m coming to get you, and you’ll kip at my place till we get this sorted.”
“Harmlessly. My brother is not interested in biological matters. I assure you, Captain Watson remains fully unattached. You are free to ask him yourself. Or my brother for that matter.”
Victor scooped the papers off John. “Submitted a copy to the registry’s office this morning. Should be getting my confirmation email any time now,” he wiggled his phone and strolled over to a safe in the corner, opening it for John to see. “Heard you have a bit of a behavior problem, which I like, but I’ve got your things right here, lover. If you want to be good, I’ll let you use them again.” He dropped John’s papers on the safe shelf. Below it, John could see his own rucksack and laptop. Victor closed the safe door with a thunk.
“Yeah I figured as much. He hardly seems like one for charity work. But I don’t begrudge him that. Moran doesn’t have many demands, and at least he’s not terrible like Victor, so I’m grateful to Mycroft. I even get to keep my full pension. Can keep Harry in her flat in town because of that.”
“And why is that bad? I spent years in the army with no privacy whatsoever and I’m not ashamed of anything. You’re the one with the problem, so deal with it. I’m keeping this on for the day, and after, I’m wearing whatever the hell I like. You’ll just have to cope.”
“Thank you, sir. And please, call me John.”
“Indeed,” Parker cut in with a silky smile. “You make an impassioned case, Major Sholto, and we can all agree there are many sides to the matter of ownership laws, but it is definitively not your area.”
Mycroft liked his brusque manner and felt the impure desire to forcibly master the boldness, but contained it. “Not crucial, though the details are needlessly tedious. Suffice it to say, the legal groundwork is solid, Mr. Trevor has been compensated, and I have your papers here.” He produced them and went on. “As for the Major, I am simply open to well-reasoned arguments. And he made a compelling case on your behalf.”
Their destination was a London School of Economics’ student housing complex in Butler’s Wharf, accurately decked with the police of Sherlock’s description. Any lingering apprehension John felt about the alpha’s intents dissipated, permanently. One of the officers, however, was not of the same mind as John.
“What do they normally say?”
That did seem to mollify the Colonel slightly, and Mycroft pressed on. “As you are positively inclined toward John’s appearance, perhaps we might discuss your courting him before the transfer.”
“I see.”
“He just pointed your boss in the direction of a man’s killers.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“No. Not really my area.” John tried not to look surprised and likely failed. He hadn’t smelled anyone on Sherlock, but he knew other omegas that would give up a kidney to mate with anyone who looked like this.
“It’s also the hair. The cologne. All of it. You just want attention. Why are you doing this?”
John was confused a moment. “Oh, no. Not really, it wasn’t bad like I thought it’d be.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What further explanation do you require? I enlisted her assistance so that I might observe the pair of you. Certainly, you find her to be very attractive, so the hardship on you ought to be minimal."
Don't look at me like that, you knew I wasn't above using 1984 shamelessly.
John turned back to see the offender on the screen. “I warned you it was shit telly before I put it on, don’t get too invested.”
James stifled an unhelpful sound of disgust. “That’s hardly a stereotype we can hope to see defied when the wishes of omegas like Watson are ignored. He greatly values his military career and is adamant in his desire not to ‘abandon his unit’ as he puts it.”
“That is a very prudent idea, Major Sholto.” Holmes intoned. “It would be a shame, if not a waste for this fate to befall an individual of Watson’s caliber, and for reasons so outside his control. Excellent grades at university, top of his class in medical school, frequent and earned commendations in his military career. I am familiar with Victor Trevor. Old money and a selfish disposition, he would reduce the captain’s life to one of nothing but frivolities, stifling his promise. I doubt Trevor would even allow the man locum work as a physician. To have one unstable figure as the captain’s legal representative was a wrinkle of genetics. To be sold to another is a misfortune within our capabilities to rectify. I seem to recall a clause in the omega ownership doctrine about greater societal responsibility and benefit which certainly applies here.”
Oh, hey there, sorry for all the generic, made up characters in this chapter, and the imaginary legal stuff. I swear, there is sex in this fic eventually.
“Of course.” John had to hold back from adding ‘sir,’ or speculating on the excess of posh in a family that opted for names like Mycroft. “John’s fine for me as well. And I’m happy to reimburse you for this, by the way,” he said tapping the phone.
That appeared to arm Parker with a new line of attack. “Hmm, yes, and quite a desirable location that residence is in. You have attempted to portray Watson as a victim, but Trevor is more than financially secure, from the information you have provided, and has no criminal record, only recreational indiscretions. The captain sounds like he is facing nothing more dangerous than a comfortable retirement. Some would call that lucky. Aren’t most omegas hoping to lure a wealthy alpha to bond with them?”
∙ ∙ ∙
“Oh, so I know I like her. It’s just the two of you there? You don’t have a mate?”
“Where did you get it?”
“Yes, sir, I am. But I- I’m in a bad situation sir, and I am reaching out to see if I have any recourse, or options that my research didn’t turn up. Sir, do you know of a way to stop a withdrawal request from going through? When an alpha submits one for their omega?”
John gave him a look, and Sherlock nodded toward the body, “What do you see?”
“No, but you going around wearing those ridiculous trousers is one. And that shirt. You know what you are doing.”
“It’s not like that, we have an understanding.”
“Yourself.”
That made John laugh properly, and only slightly belated, the man joined him.
“What is this, freak? A hot spot for courting? And how did you trick this one into joining you?”
“It’s not the orders that bother me, not from a competent leader. It’s the ownership. And civilian alphas don’t have you shoot, or travel, or generally do interesting and dangerous things.” John came up short at that, thinking over the last few hours with Sherlock. “You’re one of the rare exceptions, but then I suppose that’s the case generally for you.”
John gave a wry smile. “That’s beyond the scope of this interview, I’m afraid.” John wasn’t cross, just opportunistic. “I’m not certainly not spilling, when I didn’t get to hear how you got your cut.”
The solider offered his hand, and Mycroft took it, enjoying the warmth. “Thank you, for doing all this. I really am very grateful.”
Victor worked himself into a frenzy with the aid of John’s body and after what felt like a long time, gasped, spilling out onto John’s clothes. Victor slumped against him, dead weight.

“That’s right, she mentioned the military. I’ll have to fix that,” Victor said, rising to his feet and pulling up something else on his phone.

The next day, John wore a plain grey jumper over a high collared white button down, and black jeans (because he couldn’t figure out what was so unseemly about the regular ones but was trying to be sensitive). Talking could make it hard for Sherlock to do the work, so it wasn’t exactly shocking that clothes could disrupt him as well. But now he had no flashy colors, no immodest collar bones showing.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was late that night when John was finally free of the restraints, and Victor was still out cold. John ached and hadn’t eaten in nearly 24 hours so felt no guilt gorging himself on what food he could find and pocketing some money as well. He trusted the trust fund could bear the blow. After all, this was just Victor providing for him just like a proper alpha should. John laughed aloud at the idea. The fucker. His own money, and everything else important was in the safe, and though he’d ransacked the apartment for a code there’d been nothing. Victor’s phone and computer were password protected as well, and John’s highest priority was researching the withdrawal request. Which meant he needed to be well out of this place come daylight.
Sherlock paused and gave a slight nod. “A good observation, John. Likely a tattoo affiliating him with the gangster who sent his killers. Though not to protect his identity. The tattoo was removed to mark his break with the mob, and his killers were sent to punish him for trying to walk away. That also explains them forcing him to undress and come into the shower. They wanted to see the proof of his treachery.” He turned to the DI. “Lestrade, please note it is possible to find capable people, and stop your weak defenses of Anderson’s idiocy.”
John nodded at the fair point. “At least we’re equally noncompliant then.”
His breath hitched involuntarily as her robe slipped from her shoulders, but his eyes never left hers. “Your preferences, or activities, are none of my business, Ms. Adler. The tolling of the cheekbones can commence for as long as you two like, I just don’t want to be here for it.”
Mycroft looked up from his desk to find his younger brother skulking around the shadowed corners of his home office. How was he always so quiet? “Do come in Sherlock. As always, a pleasure to see you. I thought you were meeting John at a crime scene. Rude of you to stand him up.”
Sherlock made another outraged remark which brought a chuckle from John as he packed away the leftovers. A moment later he nearly dropped them when he opened the fridge. He closed it again. Processing. And opened it once more.
“Moran is many orders of magnitude better than the scoundrel John would have been trapped with if not for my intervention. Moran was chosen from a sizeable list of competitive candidates, I assure you.”
John just stared at him numbly. It could not be that easy. There was no possible way. All the years of study and training and work. The literal blood and sweat. There was no way it could be over. Over for nothing. It wasn’t. John simply refused. There was something he could do, he just needed to find out what it was. It must take time for the request to officially process and there had to be a work around. He would find it. It was called a ‘request’ for god’s sake, why call it that if there was no way to deny it? There would be something, he was sure. As he made up his mind, he realized peripherally that the alpha was doing something at the bar, but John really couldn’t give a flying fuck what it was.
Sherlock had long legs and John hadn’t quite caught up by the time he was at the scene perimeter. The rude officer from earlier caught John’s arm as he tried to pass her. “How do you know Sherlock Holmes?”
That day, only shortly after the summit, Mycroft stood, surveying the omega. He had a pleasant face. A strong body. Skills, apparently. A truly lovely, enticing smell, that could not be denied. But these traits could be said of many. The attitude, the defiance, that was the rare treat he offered.
John got out a mumbled, “Sorry mate,” as he tried to orient himself. The footsteps belonged to an alpha, posh, like the flat, with light blond hair and John didn’t recognize him. Must be a friend of a friend. “Thanks’ for letting me crash, I’ll be getting out of your hair now,” John said, voice still a little slurred with sleep as he made to sit up. God, he felt terrible. Like he was moving through syrup and sore as hell. Well he had slept on a hard, stone floor. It took him longer than it should have to realize his limbs were restrained.
“I see.”

John’s smirk was unappreciated by Mycroft and Sherlock looked especially smug when he followed it up with, “I think I can stay out of trouble for a few hours. I’ll just get my coat then, shall I?” and slipped off before Mycroft could stop him. Mycroft might be worried that John was going to spoil his bondmate schemes, but John wouldn’t break his word, and wasn’t tempted to. He was just curious to see what this consulting detective did on a case. Besides Sherlock didn’t seem the type to hassle him.
