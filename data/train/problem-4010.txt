thought that you-“ another hit- “would be the one-“
“Did you mean what you just… What do you mean?”
“Good fuck,” he commented, before he grabbed Dean by his hair, pulled him up a bit and then smacked his head down; Dean blacked out in a second.
“Here,” Balthazar gave him his gun. Castiel took the gun and looked at the person in front of him. Even though he wanted to get his answers, at the same time, he needed to get this over with. He suddenly felt very tired. So, he clocked the rifle and lifted his hand. He pointed the gun at the head and he was about to pull the trigger, when the person made a noise that made Castiel hesitate.
There was a sound nearby that he was too tried to interpret. His eyes couldn’t see what it was, he couldn’t hear because there was some sort of ringing in his ears. But then he was being pushed up into a sitting position and there was a solid muscled chest behind his back, pulling him close to that warmth. For some reason, he started to cry more. He turned his head to the body behind him and he felt that familiar calmness descent on him. He smelled the familiar scent of that body, felt secure when those arms hugged him and held him close to the heat.
“Balthazar,” he growled as he walked to where Balthazar was standing.
“What do you mean?”
Castiel ran the city, he could have access to anything and everything that he wanted, and however he wanted. But he wasn't an asshole just because one of his men was here. People's lives mattered, and he hated when there had been occasions where they had left more casualties than it was necessary. So he made sure to let his men know that he wasn't happy with it. And after that, they'd been much more careful with how they conducted their business. There had been accidents, of course, and Castiel made sure to find out who had been that person, and went to their house, to pay his respects, and support the family in any he could.
“Just now,” Castiel said easily. Really, he would be fine. So long as he had any sort of weapon on him. “I need your gun.”
He didn’t say anything, just crossed his legs and looked at Dean. He lifted his left eyebrow and waited for Dean to finally move his butt and sit down. Dean sighed through his nose and walked over to where he was sitting at. Dean sat opposite Castiel, and tried not to glare at him. Well, too much.
“As often as I can,” Gordon replied, his lips turning into a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. His smile was unsettling for Dean; it was like he was remembering something that gave him immense pleasure.  And well… wasn’t this the creepiest sight Dean witnessed today? “I come here to look at the kids.” Nope. This part was the creepiest.
Castiel placed his hand on top of his erection and squeezed it through his pants. He licked his lips as he stared at Dean’s stretched out body, wanting to take him right then and there. With a small start he realized that’s what he was going to do, anyway. He smirked and ran his free hand up Dean’s thigh. He toyed with the hem of his boxers and Dean lifted his hips up a bit to let Castiel take his underwear off.
“Uh, thanks,” Dean said as he fidgeted with his fingers. “It’s nothing much, but-“
“It doesn't mean that we can't take care of those plans today,” Mr. Novak said and his eyes made their way back to Dean's eyes. Dean shuddered from the heat in them. Dean sat up and scooted forward a bit, to get closer to him, but then Mr. Novak stood up and put a slight distance from them. Dean looked up at him and frowned. “Not yet, boy. You need to have breakfast, wash up, take a shower and be presentable for me.”
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel whispered. Castiel dipped down and kissed Dean’s exposed neck. Sucking on a pulse point, he tried to work his finger in, but Dean was clenching a bit. “Hmmm…” Castiel growled against his neck. “Lube?”
“What about the girl? Dean’s daughter?”
“Is it interesting?”
For someone who was in their 50's Castiel Novak sure as hell looked sinfully beautiful. The setting sun shone on his face for a bit just as he descended the small steps down and walked towards where Dean was standing. He was wearing a white button down, with the sleeves rolled up, black pressed pants and black shoes. His hair was a bit messy, and he had a small smile on his lips.
Eventually, Castiel sighed and said, “It’s not that I don’t trust you… It’s that I’m scared of what will happen to you if they’ll get their hands on you.” Castiel frowned and tightened his hold on Dean.
There was also the fact that Dean had agreed to live with Mr. Novak…
It took Dean a moment to realize that his brother stopped talking and Castiel was at the end of his stare. Well, he was at the end of the redneck’s stare as well. Castiel tried not to swallow, but it was damn hard not to. He never felt nervous before, but now he was feeling a bit… uncomfortable.
And then he walked out of the play room. The same nagging feeling prickling down his spine.
Dean would never know. He wasn’t about to ask either, although he knew that if he’d ever ask, he’d get blunt, honest answers to his questions. He wasn’t sure if it would scare him, or make him more attracted to Mr. Novak.
“I don’t want anyone in there with me,” said Castiel. “I know it sounds strange, but this is an order.”
Castiel shrugged and said, “I don't actually know. I got bored.”
“I can’t do this now, because I’m gonna end up being angry with you. Really fucking angry. But I don’t want to. So I’m just gonna leave.”
Before he could blurt out stuff that he would regret, he walked up to the bed and started to clean Dean up. The wet spot on the bed was so large that Castiel had to make Dean get off the bed so he could quickly change the bed sheets. This only made Dean sigh in annoyance, and as Castiel set up to work, he didn’t even have it in him to tell Dean off, as he started to hug  Castiel from behind and leave butterfly kissed at the nape of his neck.
Castiel’s heartbeat started to slow down to a steady rhythm and he let out another breath of air, before he opened his eyes and looked at himself in the mirror.
He also reminded him of Samandriel. No one was allowed to talk about that.
It felt amazing. The small puffs of breaths that were leaving Dean’s lips were intoxicating. Castiel wanted to do nothing more than to bend Dean over his bed and fuck him until they couldn’t walk anymore.
Once they’d go back home, Castiel would let Dean know how much he appreciated this small distraction.
He walked further into the room and discreetly looked around, trying to find the silhouette of the person he wanted to see the most. He saw some people who had the similar set of jawline, or shoulder, or hair that was the same shade as Dean’s, but it wasn’t
Alfie parked in front of the house where the charity was being held. He was quick to get out of the car to get Charlie’s door. And Castiel followed after him. He grabbed his jacket as well, and draped it over his shoulders.
Castiel couldn’t just sit here and indulge this whole thing. So after flop round, he flopped his cards and then pushed himself away from the table. He walked out of the room with a bang of the door.
“Out of his pocket. His daddy didn’t even know about it.”
Soon enough, Castiel bottomed out and he bent forward and over Dean’s body. Their lips were inches away from one another, their breaths mingling together. Castiel leaned forward and pulled Dean into a gentle kiss. When Castiel pulled back, he whispered to Dean’s lips, “I’m going to fuck you now. It’s not going to be gentle. It’s not going to be slow. It’s going to be hard, and rough, and quick. I want you to remember me for the next three days when you leave. I want you to remember who you belong to now, so you won’t do anything.”
“Can I go in like this? Do you think you can take it?” Mr. Novak whispered into the darkness, and his voice was a low growl which made Dean shiver again.
He almost jumped out of his skin when he saw that Dean was sleeping on the couch he had in his bedroom. There was a fuzzy memory connected with Dean that he couldn’t remember exactly what… What really struck was the fact that he was here. In his bedroom. On his day off. Why was he here? And why did he come here in the first place? Who called him?
“Yes,” Mr. Novak said again.
“Oh,” Castiel nodded. And gave him a look. There was a look on his face, that Dean hasn’t seen on anyone. Understanding, respect, and something else, that he couldn’t put his finger on. Yeah, people did thank him for his service all the time. But it would sound bland and not genuine. He has heard the phrase so many times when people found out about him, that he could hear the differences between the words and the expression. “I guess I should thank you for your service?”
He very, very slowly made his way to the bar in his office and grabbed another bottle of whiskey. It was still new. Castiel uncorked it and started to drink straight from the bottle. He was sure he had spilled some on his clothes, but he was too drunk to care. Oh. Right. He wasn’t drunk yet. Just, everything was rather woozy and blurry.
Castiel owned several facilities; casinos, bars, clubs, restaurants. One of the clubs that he owned was a bit out of the city. And Castiel wouldn’t have time to go and check it regularly, hoping that his people would take care of it instead of him. “We were careless,” Balthazar said. “This scum, right here, managed to weave inside the basement and steal our furniture. Also he managed to get out a large amount of alcohol. Who the fuck does that?”
Dean clenched his jaw, but didn’t disagree. He shook his head and turned away from Castiel. He walked to the coffee table, grabbed their mugs and walked to the adjoined kitchen. “You’re right,” he said as he washed the mugs and placed them to dry. “You are right. But…what I was trying to say is, I wouldn’t be here with her today if I didn’t… if we didn’t break things off. Not in the way that we have.”
Once he was done with the shower, he dried himself off, and got dressed. Today he opted for his jeans, and navy blue button down. He got his watch on hit wrist, took his wallet from the nightstand, his car keys, and he was ready to go. Dean took down his bags first, and placed them in the truck of his car in the parking lot, then he got back up to get the box. Before he left, he cast one last look to his apartment. Everything seemed to be in place. His windows were shut, the stove wasn't on, the AC was off, and the lights were off. He nodded once, and locked the door after him. He placed the box next to his bags and closed the truck. He got in the car and drove out of the parking lot.
He sighed internally, but he was careful with how his face stayed in a neutral position.
The hallway was silent, with no men in sight. It was brightly lit and the rich Italian design was an eyesore for him. They had style, but they would sometimes go overboard with it. No time to enjoy it though, since he was here to rescue the one man that actually meant something to him.
“How did you get out?” Castiel whispered beside him.
Castiel clenched his hand into a fist and took couple of steadying breaths. He wasn't even going to question his sudden need to protect Dean. It seemed that in the couple of minutes that they had spent together here, Castiel started to get fond of Dean Winchester.
Castiel worked his jaw in frustration. This was a big news for him. And he was starting to get obsessed over it, because there was nothing else in the world that Dean would tell him, and it would make Castiel look at him differently.
“What?” Castiel asked, not trusting what he heard and needing confirmation.
“There’s no such thing as ‘too’, Mr. Novak,” Crowley replied as he got in the car with him. Really from the amount of times Castiel had rolled his eyes at anything Crowley would say, he was surprised that his eyes didn’t get stuck at the roof of his eyes.
His eyes didn’t feel damp so he was positive that he wasn’t crying, but the distressed sounds that were escaping his pursed lips were disturbing him. Mr. Novak resumed rubbing his back and soon enough, Dean relaxed into his arms. He started to shake, and he quieted down considerably. He took steadying breaths to calm down some more, before he pushed back and leaned up against Mr. Novak’s chest. Dean couldn’t look into his eyes, so he kept his gaze averted. One of Mr. Novak’s hand reached up and cupped his cheek, caressing his cheek and under his eyes. Dean could feel his gaze on his face, moving them all over his face. Probably trying to figure out what went wrong.
“The information that you have is false,” a deep voice told him. It was one of those automatic voice messages that left Castiel puzzled.
“I…” Dean sighed and tried again. “I think you already know where I’m living right now, and what I’m doing with my life.”
“Are you gonna get naked too?” Dean asked him as he started to take off his underwear. When he stood up straighter, Castiel slapped him, hard across his cheek.
“I kept him a secret. I don’t know who knows about him, but I’m not going around town, showing him off.”
More shuffling of papers, and Sam sighed. “Five grand a month,” he snorted angrily. “This is bullshit. She's milking you while using your daughter.”
His life had always been complicated since he was a child. His mother died when he was young, his father died because of alcohol consumption. Then he started to whore himself out for Sam, and never gotten the chance to make something out of himself. After that he got married, and made a small family for himself and that turned around to bite him in the ass. Now, he was an escort for a Mafioso. He had fucked up way too many times and he still managed to come out of it alright. This time, he fucked up real bad and almost lost his daughter, but he was glad that she was still part of his life.
“Cas…”
The order came in a cool, leveled voice and Dean quickly obliged to him. He toed off his sneakers, and bent down to take off his socks. Then he stood up and took off his khakis. He hesitated with his shirt. He has never been ashamed of his body before. He actually proud himself for having such a great physique, but since his last customer Dean developed a low self-esteem. It took him almost a year to be able to take his shirt off in front of Lisa. That was the most painful conversation they had between them and it was something that he never wanted a repeat of. It was painful because Dean had to dodge the real reasons behind his half-assed excuses.
Anna resumed eating her breakfast, while Castiel took out his phone from his pocket. There were messages from Dean.
Mr. Novak grabbed the handcuffs from the table and secured them around Dean's wrists. “Okay?”
“Dean-“
Dean nodded, “Yeah. I’m the guy you sort of splashed your coffee on.”
“Let’s try this then.”
“Do you know why you are going to get killed?” he asked their victim, who was nothing more than a whimpering mess now. He knew what was coming his way, but he still didn't say anything. He sniffed and looked up at Castiel. His face was unrecognizable, blooded and bruised, Castiel saw nothing, but something that should be put to sleep.
asked you to keep an eye on them. Didn’t I?”
“Castiel says that you’re a mechanic. Is that right?”
Dean was unresponsive at first, but then Castiel was being hugged by him. And Castiel had no other choice but to hug him back. He tucked his face under Dean’s chin and breathed in the sweet smell of him. “I’m sorry,” Dean whispered into his ears, and Castiel tightened his hold on him. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t-you didn’t tell me. Why didn’t you tell me?” there was a slight disappointment in Dean’s voice that Castiel didn’t like. He didn’t like feeling the disappointment coming out of Dean. It was the last thing he wanted to hear.
“Why not?”
Everyone was running around, making the preparations for it. Samandriel's mother and sister had been notified about this, and Mr. Novak's men made sure that they knew all the preparations were on him. It was the least Mr. Novak could do. Dean was present as Mr. Novak saw through the preparations and confirmed everything that needed to, even if he told Crowley to do it.
“10 bedrooms?” Dean asked, unable to leave out a note of surprise from his voice. His eyebrows shot up and his hand stopped midway to his mouth.
“And you took it to heart,” Anna said with a small smile on her face.
“Why?” asked Dean, his brow furrowing.
more',” Dean said as he grabbed couple of pancakes.
“Do you have chocolate for me?”
Castiel bent forward, their foreheads touching, feeling spent and satiated after it.
He’d have to talk to Crowley about this.
Making sure he got the bullets at the fullest, he took a deep steadying breath and turned around; and charged at them. He didn’t let his finger relax from how many time he had to shoot at them. More bodies went down and he still walked further down the tunnel. He had to be more careful with how he used his bullets now. He couldn’t afford to wait around anymore, or slowdown.
“I know who one of them is,” Crowley said, his voice suddenly turning grim. “We don’t know what she did, exactly, but… we found her body in the woods.”
“Dean-“
“You sound like you are not so sure.”
“Hey, Nat, where do you wanna go?”
At these moments, he looked small and vulnerable to Castiel’s eyes. He never looked like this for Castiel.
“Is he now?” Castiel mumbled to himself. He wasn’t sure how to feel about this. Was he to go there and talk to the man, or was he to ignore the subtle invitation for dinner? He knew, deep down, that if he were to decline this offer, he was going to pay for the consequences of his actions. And probably get more blood on his hands than it was necessary.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wha-“
“You look… I wouldn’t say nice, because you’re… uh… handsome,” Dean blushed as his eyes ran over Castiel’s face, restlessly. Something warm fired up underneath his skin, but he pushed it down as much as he could. “You just look different. Like, good different.”
It was a Sunday morning when it seemed that Dean had had enough of his… whatever it was he was going through. Castiel was sitting in his office, going through some emails on his laptop, when the door literally banged open. He was startled by this behavior, and instead of showing it physically, he yelled at Dean, “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
Castiel walked into his library and made his way up to the newly added balcony which was close to the ceiling; from where he could see the sky, since the ceiling was covered in glass. He sat on the couch and looked up, to watch the rain drops. He lifted his legs up and placed them on the couch. There was a throw blanket on the couch which he draped on his legs, and then lifted his head to look out the window again.
Amara was talking to someone, engrossed in something that Castiel didn’t know, nor cared about. Dean, though, he was looking down at the ground, as if waiting for the ground to swallow him whole. To rescue him. That was usually what he looked like when he felt uncomfortable. But then, he didn’t know this Dean, did he? Then Dean lifted his head up to look at the ceiling. He looked bored and uninterested with whatever she was talking about. Yeah. Castiel still knew this side of Dean.
“Most of the time I’m more scared of what they’ll do to him, than what they’ll do to me, if anyone would ever find out about us,” he said, surprising himself with his honesty. If Anna was surprised, she didn’t show it; although her hand sort of tightened on Dean’s hand.
Castiel didn’t go to Lucifer’s funeral. He didn’t ask his men to go for him. He didn’t send flowers.
And then one day, she found the box. The box. That held everything that he used in his past life. He had to sit down on their oak dining table, in front of her and tell her all about his past life. The look in her eyes was something that Dean could never forget.
Castiel barked, in Spanish, at the chauffer to drive the car faster to his house. The man gave him a nod and pressed down on the gas. Dean looked at him, his brow furrowed, trying to figure out what happened. He took one look at Castiel’s face, looked down on his lap, and then back up again. His face cleared a bit as he realized Castiel’s state. Castiel watched as Dean’s neck worked when he swallowed, and Castiel’s lips parted. He wanted to drag his lips over Dean’s neck and bite on it, lick it, and suck it until he’d leave bruises behind. He knew that he didn’t have the right to leave bruises, but he wanted to do it so badly. Maybe he could persuade Dean into giving it to him.
to keep an eye on him, but… knowing
“Of course,” Mr. Novak said as he moved to the drawers. He pulled out the leather handcuffs. Next he took a butt plug from the shelf, and then moved to where the pads were. He picked one up and walked back to Dean. He placed down the toys on the table that was closer to the railings, and then walked a bit further away to get the lube from the bedside table.
“Yes.”
Dean was wearing worn out jeans that had seen better days, which hugged his bow legs snugly. He was wearing a black t shirt with a red plaid over it, the sleeves rolled up. His hair was messed up. And Castiel wanted to take him right there and then, but he held himself back.
Castiel sagged, but didn’t relax. He dropped the bazooka down, and went to where his other weaponry rested at. He quickly grabbed a shotgun (a Saiga 12 SBS 6-1/2”) from there with two packs of ammunition, just in case of an attack. He didn’t know what would wait for him when he got out of here, but he had to go and check. He had no idea where his men were, or if any of them were alive by this point. At the back of his head, he hoped that Alfie was at home with his mama, then here, before he looked at Lora.
Dean literally trudged up to him, yawning and rubbing his hand over his eyes. There really was no other word to describe how cute Dean looked at that moment.
Mr. Novak stood up and held out his hand for Dean to hold. Dean licked his lips and then stood up. He was still nervous about the fact that he was flying in a tube, up in the sky, anything could go wrong at any given time, but wrapping his fingers around Mr. Novak’s hand was the only thing that felt right at this moment.
“What?”
Castiel had never wanted to have kids on his own. So long as he could remember it, he wasn’t big on having kids, or family. Even though he was ready to change that mindset for a certain green-eyed man that had been a big part of his life.
“Are you sure that was his name?”
"We got Sam. He's seeing our doctor right now, but he's doing fine," Castiel said as he sat back on his heels.
model, if he said so himself; waiting for his dom to come out of the bathroom so they could go to the wedding.
, to be in her place right now.
Castiel pulled back a bit and started to kiss Dean. He responded immediately and soon, Castiel was pushing Dean back on the counter again. Dean took off his cap, and placed it on the counter, his hands returning to his hair to mess up. Castiel’s arms wrapped around Dean, he kept tightening his hold on the naked man that he liked to touch and explore so much. His hands moved up his back and grabbed onto his shoulders to pull him in closer to his chest. Dean bit down on his lower lip as he brought their hips together. Castiel could feel how hard Dean was in his boxers, and he quickly moved his hands down Dean’s back and underneath his underwear, to ground the meat in his hands. He dragged out a low moan from Dean’s throat, as their tongues explored one another’s.
“I’m going to need to cooperate with your people.”
“Let’s get you out of those cuffs,” Castiel tucked himself back in, but didn’t bother with the zipper. He got the key from his pocket and unlocked the cuffs. Dean’s wrists were a bit red, from what he could see in the dark room anyway, illuminated a bit by the street light. “You’ve hurt yourself.”
Thank you sooooo much for the amazing feedback from the last chapter. You guys are amazing!
Castiel’s eyes blinked open and he looked up. Dean’s eyes were open, and something caught in Castiel’s chest and throat, his breath stuttered into a full stop. There was honesty in them, passion and heat, and an undeniable love towards him. Towards Castiel.
“Sam.”
kill him. He didn't say any of these, but he let out a slight chuckle. “I left Mr. Novak’s cake in the refrigerator. I don’t think he likes to share his cake. He loves it way too much.”
The people around them who were dancing with them, kept brushing or bumping against them, but the two of them didn’t pay them attention. They were so into each other… their heat, their scent, their hands against one another… They didn’t want anyone else. Dean didn’t want anyone else touching him the way Mr. Novak’s hands kept touching him. The way his hands were moving all around Dean’s body, the way they clutched and pulled him closer.
“I will in a bit,” Mr. Novak said in a voice that held no tone as to how aroused he was. Dean glanced down to make sure that he was actually hard from all this. He was not disappointed. He let out a sigh of relief and then relaxed back on the bed. “If something doesn’t feel right I want you to tell me.”
“I don’t think I was made to create food,” Castiel said looking at the contents in the bowl. “This looks awful. Do you want to just have some cereal?”
“So close, so close,” Dean kept hissing. Castiel placed his now free hand at the lower part of Dean’s back, to keep him in place as he worked his fingers in Dean.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, in the middle of afternoon. He just got his blood pressure checked, and Meg had taken more blood samples from him. He was healing pretty well, his lung was okay, his crack rib was healing. Everything was fine after the surgery.
“Пожалуйста! Пожалуйста! I swear I quit the job! Пожалуйста, не убивайте меня! (
“Can I have some cookies, please?” And just like that Natalie went back to watching her cat videos.
“It’s okay,” Castiel said. He looked good. Sinfully good. He was wearing deep purple button down, with black jeans. It hugged his body in all the right places. His hair was stylishly mussed, and his eyes were blue, blue, blue. His face was wrinkled with worry lines, and his lips were parted. They looked dry.
Mr. Novak chuckled and gave him a hard kiss. Dean didn't even have time to respond, before he was moving away. He grabbed Dean's hand and walked him to the place where the railings were. He pulled at the rope that was dangling from it and pulled him down a bit. It stopped with a loud clang and Dean looked up at it.
“Do you want pancakes?” Dean asked him. His voice was gruff with sleep. His face was still unreadable. Castiel didn’t know if he were to say yes, or no. This wasn’t his space. And it was definitely not his time to stay.
to him, not now, not ever. Dean's chin was jutted out in a stubborn way that made Castiel chuckle at, knowing that Dean was one of those people who'd fight tooth and nail to get what they wanted.
“betray-“
“Stop thinking,” Mr. Novak grumbled.
Castiel held him down by leaning over his shoulder, his elbow holding Azazel down. Azazel struggled to move, but Castiel held him down tighter. “You’re gonna tell me where they are, and I’ll let you go. Probably,” Castiel growled. “Or, if you decide not to. Well…”
Castiel nodded and clapped him on the shoulder, “Yeah. I will go to bed soon. I just want to have something to drink first.”
“It fuckin does!” Dean yelled at him. “How do you know this?”
“Hey, was just checking. I know you have everything under control,” Dean said, dispelling her from turning into a bridezilla. “I just don’t know what you have as a back-up plan to everything, okay?”
Castiel snatched his gun arm back to his body as if he had been burnt. Her hair was a mess, and she looked sickly. Her tiny body looked smaller than Castiel remembered her being. Her lips were chapped and she looked close to tears again. She looked at him with wide and scared eyes. The green in them made her look almost like a doll.
His thoughts were interrupted when Crowley came in, looking excited.
In a few hours he had an important meeting to attend to with the Germans to close a deal. Castiel had thought that the man would want to just meet in one of his warehouses, but the fucker had other
Mr. Novak had his sunglasses on, and he had a serious face on. Dean didn’t say anything when he didn’t even look at him. He just honked once and started to drive his car out of the lawn. They were silent, on their way back to Mr. Novak’s house. Dean fidgeted with his phone in his hands, and tried to come up with something to talk about, but his mind was blank.
Dean’s heart went into his throat, as he kneeled down to hug his daughter to his chest. God, but he had missed her so much. He closed his eyes and held on to her tighter. He felt the tale tell signs of tears springing into his eyes, but he held them back. He wasn’t about to start crying in front of people. He was just going to hold on to his daughter and kiss her head.
Enjoy~
“Before everything else, before… well, before you, I used to work at… places where I would have to make money in ways that you can’t talk about at family dinners,” Dean said, choosing his words carefully. He wanted to just turn around and say “I’m an escort and I love doing my job”… Even though he had a feeling that Jessica would appreciate that over the longer way he was trying to tell her, this way it would make him look more of a…gentleman, than anything else. As if he needed to do that either. He snorted at his thoughts and Jessica shot him a look. He sighed again and said. “I had to make sure that Sammy had a roof over his head, and food in his tummy, and he’d get his dreams come true. Higher education, not worrying about money but only about his grades. Taking his girl out for dates and to the movies, without breaking a sweat. I had to make sure that my Sammy was being taken care of. So I did what I had to do to provide him with that.”
There were smaller scars on his ass-cheeks, but he still had his underwear on, so he was safe for the next couple of minutes.
They said their goodbyes, and Mr. Novak promised Anna that they’d meet up soon to go over some stuff. She hugged Dean goodbye, and gave him a wink as she pulled back. He couldn’t help the laughter that bubbled out of him. Mr. Novak gave him a quizzical look, but Dean only shook his head; He didn’t want to share this with him. Mr. Novak shrugged, and they left the house.
“Just a talk.”
Even when he said that to himself, repeating those lines to him over and over again, deep down, he knew it was a lie.
“You’re such a good boy to me,” Castiel said. “Before we start, do you have lube?”
Dean bit down on his lower lip and then released it with a small pop. Castiel's eyes lingered on the spit that coated his lower lip now. “Because of my past experience with this style, I'd want us to have a signed in contract.”
“Find me my brother. I will give you only 24 hours. If you won’t find him, I…” His jaw wobbled. He clenched his jaw and took a deep breath through his nose. He shoved Castiel against the wall, roughly, and then pulled back. Turning his back on Castiel, he walked to Castiel’s bedroom, stepped inside, and snapped the door shut after him.
There was nothing else to do but wait for the news.
Castiel sighed as he straightened back up, and when he walked to the bedroom door, this time he actually left.
Mr. Novak staring at him. His eyes widened and his lips parted in a small gasp of surprise.
“Dean?” she asked, her voice low.
(See the end of the chapter for
And it was thanks to Sam that he got out of the lifestyle. It wasn't an easy task, he'd still get calls from potential clients, or old clients, and it took him a severe panic attack for Sam to finally step up and tell him to get out of it and change his phone and phone number. Sam patched him back up, got him that boring job, and then he met Lisa.
“If certain someone will behave, we might. We’re gonna hit the park first, get this excessive energy out of her. Don’t wanna put too much stress on Jess,” Dean said with a shrug.
He was tired. A week of staring at the map, trying to figure out when it was going to happen, or how, was taking its toll on him. A blessed distraction from this fuckery was Dean. Even though he kept a respectful distance from this, he was still worried about Castiel. He was at work right now; having to work at the garage with his uncle had its perks. Dean could leave and come home to Castiel any time he wanted. But Castiel needed him away for now, so he could concentrate on this.
Castiel took the elevator down, with Crowley and two other men with him. It was quiet, no sound could be heard from here. There used to be an obnoxious music playing on the short ride down. Castiel was just glad that they had finally decided to cut it out.
“I have to go,” Dean stood up and past by Castiel’s bench. Castiel stood up and started to fast walk after Dean.
“Hey, gorgeous,” He kissed her cheek and pulled back to look at her. She was beautiful, and he’d always tell her that.
“Now, now, Alastair. No need to talk about yourself in such manners,” Castiel said, adding a bit of humor in his voice. He took a sip from his wine and it melted on his tongue.
Castiel knew he sounded confused and it probably reflected on his face, because Dean placed his fingers under his chin, tilted his head up a bit, and gave him a small kiss. Castiel didn’t even have the time to get into it, before Dean was moving back and turning off the light in the bathroom.
“What are you saying Bobby?”
Castiel had never felt Dean’s anger so close, and so much. There was something else beneath all of that anger, though, as Castiel stared into Dean’s eyes. Worry clung to his frame and Castiel felt more terrible than he had before.
“He’s in there. He’s drunk. And he already shot one person. We don’t want him to do it again.”
“Not everything,” Castiel said. He was on the right side of the manor, at least. “How many men are in the house?”
“Drugs and heroine, and such.”
“Dean, you’re being difficult,” Mr Novak said, and from the way he said it, Dean was sure he rolled his eyes at Dean. “If I wanted to force you, you would’ve been inside already and we would’ve been in the sky thirty minutes ago.”
Hours later, after they had their ice cream, and lunch, and drinks, Jessica opened the door to her house, and held back Ray. Dean made his way through the small hallway and to the second floor to the guest room, with Natalie sleeping soundly in his arms. He gently placed her down on the bed, and Ray barged in through the door seconds later.
Castiel stood underneath the spray of his shower, and he turned on the water. He hissed as the cold water hit his skin and he shivered slightly, for almost a minute, before the water started to turn into a warmer temperature, and his shivering subsided. He placed his hands on the wall and hung his head forward.
“Have you tried to contact him?” Lora asked next. Castiel stared at Lora for a second, but he shook his head again. “Okay…” she hesitated before she grabbed her phone and unlocked it. She tapped on it and then she placed it on the table and pushed it close to him. Castiel frowned at her, and then looked at the screen. “Because the news don’t look so good about you.”
The hallway seemed longer than it had felt yesterday, probably because of the sunlight that was cascading through the ceiling's windows. It was a great design to the house, Dean thought as he continued to walk and look up at the ceiling. It was a bit unsafe, because of the whole windows business and who his boss was, but it still looked awesome.
He got up from the table, just as Lora started to take care of the dishes, and walked to the bedroom. He contemplated knocking, but didn’t. Instead, he pushed the door open, slowly. Inside, the lights were off, but the street lights from the outside was enough to give the room some light. Dean was sitting at the other side of the bed, staring out the window.
“Okay.”
And then he left, but not before hearing Dean let out a sob.
“Ray, down!” Dean whispered at the dog in a commanding tone, but he only sniffed at Natalie once, his tail wagging, and dropped down by her side with a huff. Dean sighed at the display, and shook his head; he wasn’t about to drag the dog out of there. He knew that Ray was a very well behaved dog and he wasn’t going to disrupt Natalie’s nap time. He took off Natalie’s shoes, placed them by the bed, and draped a light blanket over her small frame to ward off the gentle wind in the house. Even though it was beginning to get hotter during the day, Dean was still going to try and keep Natalie safe through the changes of the weather.
I'm not abandoning this story, though, so don't think that, and don't lose hope.
A lady came to make sure that her daughter's wedding day wouldn't be ruined because of what happened with Samandriel few days ago. She wanted to make sure that Castiel would keep everything quiet that day. He reassured her that his men would be around the neighborhood for the three days of the wedding.
“That’s yours to keep,” Castiel said. His voice sounded odd to his ears. As if someone else was speaking instead of him.
Castiel heard screaming and people running out of the diner. Azazel stood up with a roar and went for Castiel; he wasn’t fast enough and Azazel managed to knock him down to the ground.
NSFW ahead. You've been warned ;)
He draped himself over the bar and groaned. He shouldn’t have gotten this bad. It just… Everything hurt so much. Why was this his life? Why did he have to kill people who betrayed him? Why would he had to do these stuff to the people in his life because they pissed him off?
“Not yet,” Dean mumbled but he blushed and looked down. “
I'm terrible at keeping you waiting for so long for updates. I've been very busy these past few weeks. I'm finally gonna be moving to America where I can live with my husband (!!!). And I don't have the time to sit down and actually write more chapters. For now, I only have this written, and no more chapters. So y'all gotta wait for... I don't know how long for the next update... I'm sorry for this inconvenience. I hope you'll understand.
“No, I don’t like trouble,” Aaron replied with a shake of his head. “I especially don’t want to be on your bad side.”
“Eye for an eye, as they say. Right, Castiel?” Alastair said. His voice was a hiss, close to a snake’s. He seemed angry now. Oh, his whole body language screamed of triumph, but his face was full of rage. Even his voice betrayed his real feelings. And it was so good to see, that Castiel’s heart started beating again in staccato.
"I can't tell you," Castiel replied. "Sorry."
“What is it?” Castiel asked. He frowned at Crowley who didn’t know how to respond, it seemed. “Fuckin hell, Crowley. The fuck’s wrong?”
Their surroundings caught fire and Castiel’s insides seized with panic. He didn’t let it get to him too much. If he wanted to live, he had to think of ways to get out here. With a quick thinking, he realized that he had two options right now; 1. Stay here until the people who were attacking his own goddamn house were satisfied by the damage they caused, and then leave from their hiding place, or 2. He could try and get close to where he knew the floorboards kept some of their weaponry and ammunitions.
He looked tired. And worn out. But when he smiled, he brightened up the whole room, and even Castiel’s dark mood felt lighter in his chest. It felt terrible for Castiel, because he was about to dim out the sunshine that was Dean Winchester.
“I don’t… I didn’t know,” there was something in Castiel’s throat that was preventing him from talking. He felt choked up. The last time he felt like this was when his father died and left him everything. It was an overwhelming feeling and he had buried it deep inside him. Never wanting to go near it again. Because it made him weak. He had to look strong and confident, or he’d be vulnerable. Now he felt vulnerable,
“I've always been out and about,” Castiel replied with a slight frown.
“Here,” Castiel untangled them and he sat back with his back to the headboard. He turned a bit to the side and dragged Dean up to his chest. “See, this way we’re cuddling and close, and we’re about to eat some snacks.”
"You made sure that this came to me, without even checking what's in it. You made sure that this reached me. You made sure that I should be the one to open the goddamn box with Sam Winchester's finger in it!" he yelled the last part at them. He noted that some of them flinched back. "I don't care that you hate me. It's not my job to hold your hand as you cry about how your boss doesn't take care of his men as he should. But it is my job to make sure that my men have the same respect for me as they had all this time you worked for me. I have nothing but respect for each and every one of you in this room, and more. I have never turned my back on any of you when you came to me for help, be it emotional support or financial one. I have never disrespected you in any way. And this is your repayment?" He sighed through his nose, trying to hold back his anger, as much as he could. "I need you to do better than what happened today. I need you to be firmer with your authorities on what's happening around us. I need you to enforce your men to find Sam goddamn Winchester as fast as they could, or so help me God I'll turn you into meat for street dogs. You're all fucking dismissed."
“I woke up and you weren't there,” Dean mock-pouted a bit. Castiel smirked up at him.
“How’s she doing?” Dean asked his brother, just as Castiel reached them.
She then threw herself in Dean’s arms and managed to hug Dean so tight that Dean was sure he was going to get choked like this. Dean had promised that he’d bring something amazing from Spain for her, and she had mumbled something along the lines of “
Dean rolled back down again and fiddled with the screw again. He loved working on old cars. They had a story to tell, every one of them had seen life and went through struggles that only they understood. Dean got them. He got their struggle and pain, and he was sympathetic of them.
Castiel ended the call after that, locked his phone, placed it on the table and stared right ahead at the far wall. Dean had gone to the bathroom to get changed. Despite it being around lunch time, they were both getting dressed in comfortable clothes for the rest of the day. Their day has been pretty much ruined already, so they’ve decided to just be indoors.
The bed was cold. That’s all he felt when he woke up in the morning. The bed felt too big for him. Castiel stared blankly at the ceiling, feeling a heavy weight on his chest, constricting him into small gasps of breath.
“Why then?” Castiel asked. He was genuinely curious to be asked of this. His last partners were eager to start and agreed to whatever Castiel said to them. Dean, on the other hand, seemed to want to talk things first. Castiel liked that more than anything.
street warehouse. With Natalie. Just… Just get her back, okay?”
“Oh my God… oh my God! You’re here!” she pulled back and looked at Dean. Her eyes wide with surprise and wonder. And then she looked at Castiel, and shook her head. “You went for him and didn’t even tell anyone?” She didn’t wait for an answer, and then she said, “Holy
“So you’ve been at the end of his glare, too, huh?”
Castiel didn’t eat. Even when Anna made him his favorite food, he didn’t touch it. Didn’t even gave to its temptation. The only thing he could do was shower, and sometimes change his clothes. But he didn’t cut his hair, or shave. There was a constant stubble on Castiel’s face. He ran his fingers through them and then snatched his hand away from his face, as if burnt. It reminded him of the way it felt when he touched Dean’s face.
Walking around the woods used to be an amazing way to pass the time when he had his wolf pack. They used to accompany him everywhere. But when they had gotten older and sickness got the best of them, they had to be put to sleep. Castiel had been left all alone in his musings and thoughts. He has walked around so many times that he knew his way around easily, so he’d never get lost.
Alastair was a tall and extremely thin man, with his hair cut close to his head. He had sunken cheeks and a slight goatee. He had bags under his eyes that made his eyes look extremely sunken. The colors of his eyes were lighter than the blue sky in the mornings. That would’ve looked attractive on some other people, who had better face features, and definitely didn’t look like they were about to kill dozens of people.
“Are you clean?” Castiel asked, his voice raspy.
“Do what, daddy?”
“Mm…”
Castiel hissed out in pain, his anger mounting. He needed to end this fucker before he lost this petty fight. Azazel was standing and he was ready to kick Castiel again it seemed. Castiel was quick to stand up. Azazel didn’t have the chance to do anything before Castiel grabbed him by the lapels of his suit jacket and threw him on a table. Azazel’s head collided with the dishes and the pizza, the glass from the utensils cut through his skin and he howled in pain.
“What do you want?”
“Then we’ll face her,” Castiel said. “She doesn’t scare me.”
“She… she got him.”
He cared for the man that he left in bed this morning.
“Why do you say that?”
“Why did you run to him, Gabby?” Castiel asked. He was curious. He needed the answer to get this; to get why his own brother betrayed him so…
Quick WARNING: a graphic character's death. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to get lots of angry reacts from it, but as they say shit happens...
She sighed and closed her eyes. When she opened them, they were full of apology, “I’m sorry. I’m just so stressed out-“
“Who's this 'he'?” Sam asked, with suspicious edge to his voice, that Dean knew all too well. He licked his lips and waited to hit the red light, but he still didn't answer. “Who did you contact, Dean?”
Azazel laughed at him. “I like seeing you like this. You’re so uptight all the time.”
Dean watched him go down the hall and down the stairs to the basement. He took couple of seconds to gather his thoughts. The last couple of days had been something that Dean decided he could get used to. At the back of his head he knew that this lifestyle was a dangerous one. And having a boss that was the head of a mafia family was at the top of the list of dangerous stuff. He also knew that Mr. Novak wasn't a clean person. He may have been kind and nice towards his stuff and some of his men, and even Dean, but that still didn't erase the fact that Mr. Novak was a dangerous man.
Dean hadn’t paid attention to him. He was looking straight ahead at the kids in the park. Castiel clenched his hands into fists inside his pockets, in a nervous gesture, and then relaxed. He licked his lips, took a deep breath, and then said.
The bag was slightly away from where he was, but he still managed to duck, shoot and grab the bag. He was probably the luckiest person alive, or these people never learned how to shoot properly, because
“Do you break out, or…?” Mr. Novak asked him calmly and Dean took steadying breaths to calm down. “I mean, I don’t want to drive you to the hospital for severe allergic reaction.”
“I have some things to take care of. It's something that needs to be done then.”
It was starting to get dark outside, the sun setting at the horizon, giving a nice glow to the area. There was a slight wind in the air, and it was soothing on their heated bodies. Dean was dancing with a little girl when he heard the planner call out for order; it was time for Anna and Emilio’s first dance. Dean told the girl to go and find her mama, and turned around to move back to his table. Only to find Mr. Novak’s chair vacant. He frowned and looked about, but there was no sign of him. He was probably in the bathroom. He shrugged and walked back to his table. He sat down and fetched out his phone to check for messages. There wasn’t any from his brother, or Jess. He locked his phone and placed it back into his pocket.
“Oh right. Yes. Uh...” Castiel's eyes slid over his phone again and he stared at Dean's face once, before he locked his phone and stood up. He grabbed his jacket and walked out of the office, Kayla half-jogging to catch up with his long strides.
“There ya go,” he handed Dean his order, who accepted it with a thank you. Dean paid for his breakfast and walked away. As soon as he was seated on one of the benches, Robert pulled out his phone. He sent a message, and turned to greet his next customer.
“Samandriel’s death.”
“Is that where you’re from?”
The days dragged by. The time for Dean to come home came and went, and he never came back.
“I know, and I realize what I’m saying. I’m not drunk, or high, or any ridiculous thing that might be happening in my head. I actually only had a sweet, cold, drink with your sister. And just- It doesn’t matter. What matters, is that I hate seeing you hurt, because I know what type of person you are,” Dean said, without hesitation. Because he knew that being honest with Mr. Novak was the only way he could get through to him. “I know that you’re a kind person, who doesn’t like being toyed with. You demand honesty and devotion from your people, and they have to do nothing, but give it back to you with in full. If they can’t, they either have to leave, or you make them leave. Be it permanently, or otherwise, depends on how they behave to your decision.” Dean paused, waiting for Mr. Novak’s eyes to clear with understanding to what Dean had told him. When he saw his eyes widen and his lips parted in exhale, Dean continued, “I’m not gonna leave you. I’m going to stay by your side, no matter what happens. I’m not gonna betray you, or your trust in me. I know we are new to each other, and there are some stuff that we are not willing to share with each other, but I’m willing to stand by your side, and fight, if I have to. Although I’m a bit rusty on the fist fighting, or gun fight, I know I’m gonna need a lot of training, but just kno-“
Once inside, Castiel realized that this table wasn’t just set up for people who have bunch of money laying around and came here to spend it in gambling. It was sort of an All Star type of table. Castiel sat at an empty chair and nodded once, while looking at some of the people. He recognized the champion of WSOP 2016 Tommy Gun and some actress from SNL. He wasn’t close with any of them, or knew them personally, but he has played some rounds with them from time to time and they were great competitors.
When they were done with the call and Castiel nursed a whiskey in his office, Castiel realized that it had been disappointment. He knew why she had sounded like that. Castiel sighed through his nose, and drunk the rest of his whiskey in one gulp. And then poured himself another glass.
“Fuck,” Dean whispered as he felt Castiel’s finger there.
When Castiel got close to the table the party all stood up and nodded at him. He paid them no mind as he sat opposite a young man. His name was Aaron Bass, and he seemed and looked like an idiot, who didn’t know what he was doing in the adult world. Castiel still wondered why the guy’s father thought that this was something his son was made up for, but Castiel had no experience in parenting so he wouldn’t know how parents did, you know,
Castiel’s face turned into stone, his gaze turned cold, and his eyes were ice. His back straightened, and his hands tightened into fists. He was at the end of his wits. He needed to calm down before he’d have to kill the man. He needed to get the information out before he’d strike. There were at least five men in here. If he were fast enough, he’d take at least three of them. And he’d have to fight the other two. If they were good enough fighters.
’ is it? Is it really, Castiel?” Dean turned around look at Castiel. “Why is it that every time I’m around you, something bad happens? Something like
It took him awhile to calm down, and it took him a bit longer to say good night to Mr. Novak because he didn’t feel like ending the call. But then Mr. Novak told him he needed to sleep to gain some strength back into him so he could face the day. Dean agreed and he was promised a warm welcome when he’d go back home.
“What happened?” Castiel asked. “Are you okay?”
Alone...
“Let’s get you into bed, yeah?” Dean suggested some time later. Maybe it was just a minute later, or an hour later, Castiel didn’t know. Castiel nodded and tried to get up, but his legs wouldn’t support him. He tried again but he just toppled over some wet stuff on the floor.
Dean hesitated before saying, “I know that you know.” There was a pause, where they only heard their breathing through the phone, before Dean continued. “I know that you know I twigged out the story a bit, to save my personal life from entering this life. You had your people at the park. I know it, because I recognized the cars. And let me tell you, they don’t really know how to be stealthy.”
When Dean leaned forward to get the blanket up and over them, Castiel pushed him back down and draped himself over Dean’s chest. This was something that they hadn’t done before, and Castiel was feeling out of his element. Although, it was he who initiated this position, he was still cautious about it.
Blood.
Dean didn’t answer. Castiel could hear him puttering around the kitchen. Castiel walked toward the window and stared outside. The streets were quieter here, even though it was only around 10 pm at night. There were some people walking up and down the streets, though. A pack of stray dogs passed by, and Castiel smiled to himself, as one of the people on the street, got scared of them. It made him remember his pack, and before he could feel sad about it, there was a tap on his shoulder. Castiel turned around and Dean was standing there, with two mugs of steaming…
“Thank you, Dean. If you need anything, do not hesitate to call us in the kitchen,” Lora said as she indicated the phone by the bedside table. And then she walked out of the bedroom, closing the door after her.
He couldn’t go down that road and simply start thinking about Dean, and about what he had learned. He needed to get more information about what was going on, before he could take the next steps and take care of it.
“Castiel,” Azazel said through a mouthful of pizza. “What an unpleasant surprise.”
“Dean, I'd like you to meet, Anna,” Mr. Novak said giving a smile to the lady.
“I can’t quit this job. I can’t just up and leave. And I can’t retire. Not without leaving all of it to my son, or daughter,” Castiel said, his chest tight with fear and a long lost ache to have that with someone. “But I don’t have any of that, do I? Anna has her own family and her kids to raise. And she’s sworn off to the Galicia, which you already know, since you were there when they got married. Or has that detail escaped your mind?”
Once they got in, the car started again and rode out of the gates in a minute. “Who was shot? What happened, exactly?” he asked Crowley as he grabbed his phone from his pocket. He fidgeted with it as he waited for Crowley to speak.
“Well, uh, wait for me, hang on,” Castiel said. He bid his friends a good night and a Happy New Year before he joined Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled and then looked down at Castiel’s hands, which were clutching at the towel. “May I?” he indicated to his hands. Castiel took turns by letting Dean take his hands to inspect. He would hold the towel with one hand, and then the other. Dean looked at his fingernails closely.  They weren’t the cleanest, but they looked acceptable.
“Just once, with Alice. They still don’t accept her as one of mine. I don’t know why…” Mr. Novak looked away frowning. But then he shrugged and said, “Anyway, they do the same thing with Gabriel, so I’m guessing that they have preferences.”
Dean Winchester never got high.
And that is what happened to Dean.
His navy suit was clinging to his body as if it was made out of his own skin. The stiffness to the fabric made itself known to him as he moved across the floor to where he could see them sitting. He could feel the eyes of the restaurant’s patrons on him, and his back, as he walked and didn’t spare them a second glance.
Something warm and sure settled over his chest.
Castiel looked at him for a second longer and then turned away from him to the small bar he had in the corner. “So,” he said as he poured two glasses of whiskey. “Gabriel didn't say much about you.”
“That’s not what I was –“ Charlie said, shaking her head, “I’m not scared of where we are going, because it’s a charity thing. And yeah, lots of rich people, which I may or may not have stolen from.” Castiel opened his mouth to reply to that, but she continued on. “And I know these things don’t happen in real life, but like, I don’t… I’m not scared of whose gonna draw their guns out first, not like that’s gonna happen in this event. Okay, that’s a little bit scary, but I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about this whole thing you are going through?” Castiel kept looking at her, because he didn’t realize what she was referring to. And she seemed to get what he meant by the silence, so she added, “With Dean? And the house?”
The chapter ahead holds boys talking to each other, some explicit scene...
It was decided that the vibrator was going to stay in Dean’s butt and the controller to it was in Castiel’s hand. Whenever he’d feel like it, he’d end up tuning the acceleration up.
Dean looked down at his bloodied shirt, at his hands, and then back up at his face. He dropped to his knees in front of Castiel, licked his lips and said, “Tell me how to do this.”
He praised Dean’s participation to the act, it was remarkable just how well he was trained to be obedient to Castiel. How in tune he was with Castiel’s need for something. They had an amazing time on their way to here, and in the end, Castiel suggested they take their small…play time to the outside world.
Darkness consumed him faster than he had anticipated.
“You are right, Dean. You are an escort and you have no right to tell me anything,” Castiel snarled at him. Dean recoiled back in shock. Castiel’s heart ached. He wished he could take back the words that left his lips. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Castiel wished to turn back the time to those wonderful moments of togetherness that they shared. Before he had his freak out and he couldn’t seem to get his head back into his normal headspace.
“You wanna talk about it? I swear, I’m a great listener, and even better secret keeper,” she laughed and shrugged her shoulders. “Even from my brother.”
“I asked, are you clean?”
It seemed to take a moment for Dean to realize that Castiel had asked him a question to which he needed to give a coherent answer. “What?”
Soon enough, the car stopped right in front of the hospital door and he hopped out of the car. “Move the car away from the front door,” he said to his driver who gave him a nod.
“I just contacted my men and told them to send out a search party on a certain man. He being nonexistent on this earth is a must.”
“Mr. Novak,” Balthazar said respectively.
Castiel frowned at that, and looked down at Dean’s knees. “Why?”
“You don’t want them to be on you for…whatever you’re planning on doing,” he said, his mouth feeling heavy. He knew that he was going to black out soon, but he needed to be sure that she wouldn’t do anything.
Today, he was at his wits end. Today, he needed to get some answers. Today, he needed to know about his daughter. And he wasn’t about to be silenced by this monster. “I asked you a question, and I expect an answer to it,” Dean slurred out. His teeth clacked together as another wave shocked through his system.
“I would stick my tongue out at you, but I’m not, because I’m sure if I do, I’m gonna end up spitting this deliciousness at you,” she said with a shrug. “Mmm... Anyway. I haven’t spoken to you since last month. Everything okay back home?”
“I don’t know if you’ve heard of me, but my pen-name is C.J. Novak?”
There was a heavy and a sharp feeling pressing down insistently on Castiel’s chest. His left hand twitched again and he could feel Alfie stepping in closer behind his back. But he didn’t say anything to him and didn’t acknowledge Castiel’s poorly hidden anxiety attack.
“I never told him my name, Jess. I knew his name, since I asked, but he never asked what my name was. And he said to… to keep a close eye on my daughter. And that’s when I realized that she wasn’t at the playground.”
He sat there trying to get his breathing back to normal. Okay. So it wasn’t a direct attack on him, or his family. It was a phone call that gave him that message. He didn’t even see who gave him the phone. Castiel ran a hand over his face and grabbed his phone from his pocket. He dialed Crowley’s number and after the third ring, he answered.
Dean’s hair was soft, in the same way as before, and Dean’s reaction to his touch was instantaneous. He leaned up against his hand and turned his head up and stared right into Castiel’s eyes. They were filled with sadness, and he looked somewhat vulnerable like this. But there was something hidden in there that Castiel didn’t think he’d ever see reflected back at him ever again.
“Long enough to look like a foul.”
“Hi, love. I haven’t seen you for… how long has it been?”
When he got the T-shirt back in order, he took calming breaths and called for Dean to come in. “Hey,” Dean said softly as he came inside the bedroom. Castiel only nodded at his direction, still trying to get his head back in order. Dean didn’t move in too much to the bedroom, but he wasn’t close to the door either. He seemed unsure of himself. “I just came in to see if you were doing okay.”
“If you want. I don’t… I don’t think I should be thanked. I was just doing what I had to do.”
Before he went outside, he pulled out his phone from his pocket and opened the texting app. He wanted to send a message to Dean, to say something, but he didn’t know exactly what he was going to say. He knew if he were to start texting Dean he was going to tell him where he was going right now. And he didn’t want to ruin Dean’s time with this.
“Go off like that.”
“Hm?”
Dean was kneeling down on the floor; stripped naked, his arms handcuffed behind his back, a cock ring attached to him. His face was red; the blush was steadily spreading down to his chest. His nipples were hard from Castiel’s hands, tweaking them and slapping at them. His whole body was buzzing from overstimulation, it seemed, because whenever Castiel’s hand touched him softly, Dean’s whole body jerked up to it.
“Alright,” Mr. Novak stood up and helped Dean to stand up as well. “While you clean up, I’ll ask the girls to heat this up for us again.”
“There was an attack,” Castiel said, not wanting to lie to Dean, because he owed him that.
“Cas-“
“You’re way too young.”
He closed his eyes took a deep breath, letting the noise that was provided by the woods silence the tide wave that was in his head, and concentrate on the book that he brought with himself to read. The feelings were replaced quickly and Castiel allowed himself to open the book at the right place and start reading.
“You’ve a back plan if it won’t, right?” Dean asked casually and was pinned on the spot with a glare that would ravel her brother’s.
“Go through the back door. It will lead you to the kitchen, where you can find Lora. Let her show you to your bedroom and to some rooms. Have fun, but not too much,” Mr. Novak said with a slight smile and a wink and then he walked out of the dining room.
“Enjoy. I'll be back later on with the dessert. Black forest. Mr. Novak's favorite.”
When Castiel went back to his apartment, it was quiet. He walked into the kitchen to see Lora working in the kitchen, with her headphones in. He left her there without bothering her. He walked to the living room and draped his coat and jacket over the sofa. He sighed as he walked up to the windows, which usually overlooked down at the city, but it was covered up in a fog and slowly falling snow. They were going to be hit with another snowstorm it seemed.
“No!” she yelled at Sam now. “No! You don’t get to talk to me. This is… All of this is your fucking fault. All of this is
“Uh yeah,” Sam shuffled the papers on his lap to get to the right one. “Yeah. It says you get to spend 72 hours with your daughter, starting at 10 a.m. sharp, at the beginning of every month.”
“That must’ve been intense.”
There was a heavy, but slow music playing, where the people that were dancing, found their partners and started to girth their bodies against one another under this music. It looked incredibly hot and sexy, and Dean wanted to do that right away.
“I need to see him first,” he said in a voice that brooked no argument. The doctor hesitated but he nodded once.
This time he went in without a hitch and Dean moaned again. He wrapped his arms around Mr. Novak’s neck and pulled him close for a kiss. Mr. Novak was grunting into his mouth as he started to move his hips, slowly dragging out, and then pushing in just as slowly. Dean moved his lips down to Mr. Novak’s chin, where he bit at it, and kissed it, and mouthed along to his ear. Mr. Novak was grunting and moaning, and he dropped his head down to Dean’s neck. Dean turned his head to the side and gave more access to Mr. Novak.
“Yeah, like letting other people to tie you up and beat your face in.”
His steps slowed down as he heard voices talking and laughing not so near from where he stopped. He crouched down and placed his bag on the ground, not making a sound. He re-checked his gun before he took a steadying breath and turned the corner.
“It's a mix of everything, really. A strip club, casino, with an open bar. Also, it can be used as a disco club too. He used to throw parties, almost 2 times a week, once he got his father's job.”
More questions ran in his mind as his men started to converse in between them for a solution to this problem. Castiel locked his eyes with Crowley, who was sitting at his left side. His face didn’t give away to his thoughts so Castiel didn’t know what he was thinking about. Sighing through his nose, Castiel closed his eyes. He needed to think about this whole mess and come up with an attack plan.
Dean who was wearing a dirty t-shirt, garden gloves and jeans. He was kneeling down beside one of the gardeners who was tending to the roses. Dean was helping him out. From afar, the sweat wasn’t so noticeable, but Castiel knowing Dean, knew how much the man sweated usually. He curled his hands into a fist so he wouldn’t go out there and touch Dean’s sweaty body.
“My apologies. I needed to answer a phone call… or ten,” he rolled his eyes. Dean frowned down at their hands and then looked up at him.
“Yeah. So I have read every genre, I think. Unless they come up with something new in the next minute, anyway.”
“You fight good,” she said to him, smiling up at him.
“Was he?”
“Yes, Mr. Novak?”
It didn’t take Dean long to come. It probably lasted more than five minutes, and because he was feeling responsible for putting Dean through this, Castiel swallowed every drop of cum that was leaving Dean’s body. He actually liked how Dean tasted like. It was a mix of salty, pineapple and just skin, there was also a taste that Castiel couldn’t pinpoint, but he liked it a lot.
Since he came back from his tours, he’d tried dating, tried one-night stands, but they all felt so bland and empty. He was feeling very much filled upright and he couldn’t stop moaning and gasping and mewling and crying out. Castiel knew what he was doing, and Dean loved every second of it.
Mr. Novak was the first one to pull back, but he didn’t stray too far. Instead, he moved his hand up and cupped Dean’s cheek, and brought their lips together for a kiss. Dean responded with no hesitation. Their lips danced together in soft movements, and then Mr. Novak was deepening the kiss. Dean was quick to follow and he clutched at Mr. Novak’s shirt, pulling him closer.
“When we were leaving, I checked the park and… and I saw some fancy looking cars there.”
“What?” Gabriel asked, looking thrown off by the question. He gave a somewhat nervous chuckle, as he said. “I don’t remember what I had for dinner, let alone remember where I was that night.”
Thank you all so much for still being with me and being patient with me, and giving this a try. I appreciate it.
The second the door was closed after her, Castiel took out his phone and texted Balthazar, asking him to come to him ASAP. He got the confirmation 10 seconds later, as Castiel made his way inside the house and to his office. He poured himself two fingers of whiskey and drank it straight up, his chest warming up as he drowned the glass. He was pouring another shot when the door opened and Balthazar walked in.
“No guest bedroom?”
“Are you okay?” Mr. Novak asked, his hands running up and down his arms.
“Yeah. Is that... would that be a problem?”
“Dean, I need to take your blood and shit, so you better let your guy here leave, so we can get on to it,” Meg said slowly and deliberately.
“Of course, baby girl. Anything my princess wants,” Dean said and he dumped her on the bed, making her bounce as she shrieked in delight. Dean went after her to tickle her sides and she continued to screech and laugh. Dean made sure to remember this sound, and her face, at this moment. He needed the motivation to continue with the life he was currently living.
“Sir… Is it…” Dean sighed and turned away, but not fast enough for Castiel to notice how his cheeks turned red from blushing. “Is it bad that I enjoyed this?”
“Good boy,” Castiel murmured. “After this, I’m going to spank you. Remember when in Spain, I told you I’m going to spank you for making those noises?”
“Just…” Castiel couldn’t continue with the sentence. But Balthazar understood him, for he just nodded at him and got his phone out again and started texting someone.
“Absolutely nothing, Sammy,” Dean said as he started to get up.
He jumped back on the counter and spread his legs again. “Aren’t you overdressed?” He asked as he moved his hands down Castiel’s body and under his shirt.
Castiel didn't wait for a reply as he went to the living room, where Dean was napping. As Castiel approached, he noticed that Dean was covered in a fine sheen of sweat. On top of everything else that was happening, Dean was starting to get a withdrawal from not using drugs so much these days. He told Castiel he wasn't an addict, and it wouldn't take him long to get over it, but the side-effects that he was having were telling him a different story.
His chauffer nodded, looking confused, but he still held out his car keys for Castiel to take. Castiel walked around the car, got in, and drove the car from the lawn. In his rearview mirror he saw two of his men get into the car, and follow him down the road. Castiel pursed his lips as he sighed out his frustration. He wanted to call Crowley to get them off of his tail, but he didn’t, because he knew he wasn’t going to win this argument. So he just let them be, for now.
Right now, Dean was standing frozen on the spot, hand fiddling with the papers that he brought in with him, eyes jumping from man to man in the room. He was blushing and, with a sudden lurch, Castiel realized that he knew just how low that blush went down.
“It gets you into trouble,” Crowley continued, walking around the office.
“One of them has been found dead. In the woods.”
Dean slid down on the ground, right in the vomit, but he didn’t care. This was better than thinking, anyway. He just needed to rest, and wait for the room to stop swimming. Then he’d be up to shower and clean up.
Dean had to take another steadying breath as he nodded, and then he couldn't help himself, but ask, “Where are you going?”
“Okay, okay. Fuck. I’ll stop. Just. You don’t stop. Please,” Dean said quickly. Castiel watched as Dean relaxed his arms and Castiel breathed out in relief.
Castiel had a wild moment where he could pick up his gun again and point it at Alastair’s back. He could shoot him, right now, and they could walk away without any consequences. But then he noticed that Alastair’s hand that moved with his turning, had a gun in his hand. Castiel’s gut churned with uneasiness.
Dean woke up early in the morning. They get the tube out that helped him breath. He looked better and he even cracked a joke with one of the nurses. They had blushed and tittered prettily at him. Castiel just gave Dean a blank look over their shoulder. Dean had smiled and gave him a wink.
“Nothing,” the reply came too quickly for Castiel’s liking, and he knew Balthazar was lying. Castiel glared at him, before he sighed and said, “I know you told me
“What will happen to me, if they don’t trust me, or accept me as one of your pack member?” Dean asked, his heart slowly starting to get erratic.
Castiel grabbed her closer to him, his hands getting soaked up in her hot blood. “Natalie, no. You can’t... You can’t do this not yet. Your daddy’s… daddy’s waiting for you.” His heart was going to stop. This wasn’t good. This was the worst thing ever that could happen today. He was supposed to get them both back home, safe. To their family. He was going to have more time with them both, and get to know her better, and see her go to school, and even make sure that no guy or girl would hurt her. She was too young.
Dean wouldn’t do that, would he? He wouldn’t befriend the enemy for revenge, right? But then… It had been years ago, so maybe he was over that. Castiel cringed at his own thoughts. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t like the person who got killed was the neighbor’s kid. It was Dean’s daughter. His only child. No one could ever get over that.
“I know, but not tonight. An important thing came up that needs my assistance,” he almost sounded apologetic. “For tonight, I want you to relax. Lora will show you around. You can go anywhere you want within the mansion. It's quiet big.” Mr. Novak stood up and Dean did also. “Now, run along. Lora, please take him to a mini tour of the mansion. But please leave the interesting parts of it to me.”
That shut Dean up faster than if Mr. Novak were to kiss him. Dean had simply walked away from Mr. Novak, leaving him standing in the middle of the hallway, looking angry, but there was something in his eyes that didn’t make Dean feel bad about their fight.
“Yeah. Just… try and understand this whole thing from his point of view? I guess? I don’t even know, man. I just… I just need him home. I just need him to be safe. With you. I know he was safe with you.”
“Then why aren't you naked?”
Dean looked at him and nodded, sort of shrugging as well, “Uh sure… but I uh… no funny business.” He chuckled at the end, with self-consciousness that Castiel haven’t seen in him show before.
“Message?” asked Alfie. “From who?”
Or would he, Dean’s heart started to rise up in panic at the thought, or would he dump Dean at the sidewalk, because he’d been used by his enemy? It wouldn’t be the first time to happen to him. It wouldn’t be the first time a dom told him to go away because he’d been with another person before them. Dean would snort at them and their dreams of finding a ‘clean’ sub. No one was clean. In this line of work, nobody was clean, because they wouldn’t survive.
There was a cold chuckle, a lot closer to the phone this time. A huff of breath and a cold voice spoke, sending shivers down Castiel’s spine. “I got your pet,” he sung out, dragging out the ‘
Castiel buried his face into Dean’s neck as he started to lick and suck and kiss on the skin. Dean tightened his hold on Castiel as he planted a kiss right under his ear; the skin sensitive there. They shifted and Castiel felt both of their erections brush up against one another through their clothes. Castiel let out a choked sound and Dean let out a sigh right close to his ear. They started to move their hips against one another.
Dean tripped over his feet. “Son of a-Really?” Castiel gave him an innocent look. Dean shook his head and walked a step ahead of Castiel. He didn’t complain, really. This way he had a great view of Dean’s ass, so this was a win-win.
Sam fought hard for him. He gave everything he could, and more, but Dean's personal history wasn't a clean one. So they gave her to her mother; who was the most level headed of the two. She was a woman, after all. And the courts tended to be much more sympathetic towards women. It was for the best anyway. Dean wouldn't be able to take care of their daughter either way. His salary wouldn't be enough for it. And he did live in a one bedroom apartment, close to downtown.
“No.”
Sam held out his hand to shake, with a small smile on his face, “Pleasure to meet you. Finally.”
“Oh?”
“Damn right I have,” grumbled Dean as he started his car.
His mahogany desk held family pictures; of him and Jess at their wedding, their dog, and Dean with Natalie. The picture of Dean’s family was missing from the table. Dean silently thanked Sam for it. There was also a picture of their parents on their wedding day. It was one of Dean’s favorite, and he and Sam had an argument over who was going to take it home with them. He ended up being the better brother and gave it to Sam.
“Because...” Dean's voice wavered for a moment and he took a deep steadying breath, and tried again. “Because my body isn't clean.”
“I just wanted to give you his address,” Crowley said, giving him a piece of paper.
It was gruesome, sharp around the edges, and deeper than they looked on the surface. Dean wanted to reach out and touch, but he couldn’t. Not yet, so he stayed back. On his lower back, on two sides, was what seemed to be swallows. But they weren’t alive, or healthy looking. It was their skeleton with some feathers featured here and there.
“Come with me,” Castiel said. “Come with me, and you’ll be safe, and away from her.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said. The reaction was subtle, but he could see that Dean's eyes widened slightly and his lips parted just a tiny bit. A small puff of air leaving them. “Drink?”
Castiel didn’t show him the other rooms, and he had a feeling that Dean wouldn’t go there without permission. He bit down on his lower lip as he tried to think of a place he’d go. Frustrated with himself, he grabbed his phone and called Dean. He could hear a rock music playing in a small distance away and he started following that sound. When he stopped it was in front of his bedroom. He slowly opened the door and the rock song, that was Dean’s ringtone, could be heard clearly from here. He ended the call and stepped inside.
“Yes, daddy. And also, when I’m about to sleep. And use the bathroom. And wash up.”
“Grab that tray for us.”
“You agreed to let me see you naked, though…” Dean said, his voice hesitant.
“They don't call you One Shot for nothing, don't they, Mr. Novak?” Balthazar said with a smirk, hands in his pockets.
“You told me you’ll let me go!”
Thank you for the overwhelming amount of comments and kudos I receive from my small 'fandom'. I really appreciate it.
Kevin laughed out loud at that and said, “Well, you’ve another bigger family in your pocket.” Just then Castiel’s phone dinged with a message and he excused Kevin to check on it.
It was amazing to be able to dream again. To dream of the warmth of the man he loved.
Alastair’s hot breath fanned over Dean’s face as he started to move his hips faster and faster. Dean tugged on his chains again, feeling the abused skin tingling with pain. Dean would take that pain over being raped any day. He cried out and tried to scream and tried to tell Alastair to stop. Using any sort of way to let Alastair know that he wanted him stop, but he wouldn’t stop. Just like Dean knew that he was never one to stop. So all he could do was shut down his brain, completely, let his body relax on the hard surface, and let the man do whatever he wanted to do to Dean.
Bobby turned to Dean and said, “We need to talk. Now.”
“I can’t… I can’t do it again. I can’t just… live this life, without thinking of anyone.”
The dreams never let up. The dreams never stopped. The dreams were memories he had shared with the one and only Dean Winchester.
Dean had his arms crossed over his chest. His brow furrowed while he glared at an amused Mr. Novak; he looked incredibly hot in his tight black jeans and black button down shirt, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He was wearing sunglasses and his hair was ruffled and soft looking, fluttering a bit from the light breeze at the small airport. Dean was wearing a red plaid shirt, with black jeans, and boots. It was the day of the flight to go to Spain for Anna’s wedding, but Dean hadn’t realized that in order for him to go with Mr. Novak, he had to
“Your guests are here, sir. Should I lead them here, or to the entertainment room?”
Now, however, was a different experience; he was an adult. While he was excited to fly in the mysterious tube when he was little (look at how
“Wanna dance?” Mr. Novak asked, and the apology that was going to leave Dean’s lips faded into the background. Dean’s lips parted as he stared at Mr. Novak for a second, who was staring at him right back, unwaveringly. Dean’s mouth dried at the offer and he had to clear his throat couple of times to be able to speak.
“Well then, sir,” he said, and his voice sounded different too. It was pitched higher than his usual voice, and it… It didn’t sit well with Castiel. “I just came by to tell you that I’m leaving for my three days off.”
“I was never his. We never had…” Dean blurted out. His chest was moving up and down in fast breaths. He was scared. Castiel felt sick, for pulling this at Dean, but he had to make sure.
“You don’t get it, do you?” Dean said. His voice was shaking. “I don’t like being vulnerable. Not around my f-family, not around anyone I know. Not even around you. I don’t like showing weakness. I-I don’t like asking for help. It makes me feel wrong. It makes me feel weak. But when I come to you for something, it’s because I-“
Dean nodded. He walked inside and closed the door after him. The blinds were drawn, and Castiel walked to the bedside table to flick on the lamp. The bedroom was light enough for Castiel to see Dean’s face as he looked around, now that the lamp was on. “You don’t have much here,” he said, his voice low in a way when people were asleep in a house.
The bouncer didn't even bat an eye, and let him through with no other word. Dean heard the people behind him groan, and couldn't help the smug smile gracing his lips. The club was dark save for the florescent lights and the occasional tech light flickering on the crowd. The music was too loud and Dean couldn't help the grimace of today's crap that teens loved to listen to. He walked to the bar and ordered whiskey. He needed to calm his nerves down. If today's interview went successfully well, he was going to have a good job with good income, on his limits. Everything was going to be on his grounds because he needed that stability. One bullshit out of line, and he was going to walk out.
Alastair sneered down at him from above and Dean screamed behind his gag, his heart beating frantically in his chest. Dean could feel Alastair’s hands on his hips, bruising him as they held Dean’s body down. His breathing turned erratic when he felt Alastair’s hardness brush up against his inner thigh. He was close to puking from the feeling, but he didn’t have to even do anything. Alastair’s hands moved down his hips to his butt and Dean felt himself being stretched by dry fingers. Dean’s whole body seized up at the intrusion and he tried to shuffle away from them, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t do anything but lay down there and ride this whole thing out.
Dean shook his head and let out a laugh. “Not even close.
Kevin took the box from his offered hands, opened the lid and took out the bottle. He uncorked it right in front of Castiel, breathed in the scent of it and let out a satisfied sigh. “Ahh… It sure does have a unique smell to it. I hope that the taste will be just as wonderful. Thank you.” Castiel inclined his head down, while Kevin gave the bottle to one of his maids. “Now,” he said, clapping his hands together. “Is it okay if we sit outside? It’s a lovely afternoon.”
Even an apology wasn’t going to stop her from yelling at him like this. Nothing that Castiel could say to her was going to fix any of this.
“Yes, sir.”
“I've got this covered, brother. You go home and rest. I'll call you in the morning,” Gabriel said in a monotonous voice, that Castiel didn't like. He didn't push Gabriel to speak about it, not now. He could be disappointed by this since Samandriel was a new recruit in his team. Castiel would have to talk to him about this in another time. Right now, he had to go back home.
“But we both know that we won’t be able to really keep a hold of who will buy this stuff and who will actually use it,” Aaron said as he drank his beer.
“She’s doing amazingly well, actually. Her contractions are well timed, and she’s been breathing through pain just as well. They kicked us out because the doctor’s in and he had to check… I don’t even know what,” he said and ran a hand through his hair again. And then he turned his gaze at Castiel; who was trying to slink back to the wall, and make him as invisible as he could. But obviously he couldn’t do that.
“Yes. I believe so. I’m actually waiting for a phone call from Crowley.”
Leave me your thoughts?
He walked to the front door again and hesitated for only a moment, before he opened the door and walked out. It was too cold outside for him to
“You’re not as discreet and quiet about it, as you think you are,” Dean replied with a shrug, as if it didn’t matter. He said so, too. “It doesn’t matter. I want them all dead.”
Dean grabbed his glass, shot back the last bit of whiskey down his throat and followed Gabriel. They made their way up the stairs that was built right above the bar. It had glass windows and, once inside, Dean could see what was happening around the club. At the corner of the room, there was a man standing with a sharp suit on. He was lean, but he looked like he could kill if someone was brave enough to cross his path.
Castiel made his way out of the building and into one of the awaiting cars. No one said anything as they took in his appearance. His driver spared him a glance through the rearview mirror, but didn’t comment, as he drove away from the club.
Castiel didn’t reply right away. His heart was hammering away in his ribcage. “Don’t,” Castiel whispered. He swallowed and said, “Please, don’t do it this way.”
“Thank you,” Castiel replied with another glance at Dean.
“You care for him,” it wasn’t a question. It was a statement, and Castiel turned around to look at Dean; who was talking to Bobby. They didn’t look upset, which was good.
“Did I apologize? I’m sorry if I haven’t.”
When they arrived, Castiel nervously fiddled with his phone in his hands. He didn’t know what was waiting for him inside the building. He hated not knowing. His men were out of their cars already and they were waiting for him outside of his car. Alfie was his designated driver for the night, and he was still in the car, waiting for his move. Castiel noticed him shooting glances at him from the rearview mirror, but otherwise, he kept silent. He was waiting for his orders.
“Do you have news about who was responsible for Samandriel’s death?” Castiel asked, looking out of the window, and then back at Crowley.
They reached the bathroom and Dean walked a step forward from him to turn on the light. Castiel then walked inside and sat down on the closed lid of the toilet. Dean walked to the shower and fiddled with the temperature of the water. When he was satisfied by it, he walked back to Castiel and knelt before him. “Sir, you need to take a shower. It’ll be the best way to take care of this. What do I do now?”
In the morning he wouldn’t remember saying these words to Dean. In the morning, he would be a different person. But here, right now, he didn’t have any filter. He just kept repeating the same words over and over again. But Dean didn’t say anything back to him. He didn’t say he loved him back. And that hurt more than anything else.
machine gun. He zipped up the bag again, placed it over his shoulder.
Dean didn’t struggle; he knew it was a futile thing to do. So he just stood there, motionless, his hands by his sides and waited for Mr. Novak to release him.
Castiel slowly leaned back into his chair, his heart thudding painfully in his chest. The men around the table started to converse with one another as they realized what Lucifer's words meant. Alastair was going to bomb the town, essentially start a real war against Castiel.
The pain was light, and pleasure zinged through his body. His ass-cheeks squeezed in around his plug and he shuddered from it. Five, six, seven, eight... came one after the other without a pause between them.
Right now, he needed to take care of the mess that was his family house, and his men, and end the Italians for good, and hopefully get Dean out of there and back to him. If he wanted to, of course…
Jesus, it’s only been a day, a
He got out of his car and grabbed onto the duffel bag that was in the trunk of the car. It was heavily loaded with weaponry. He walked to the underground’s entrance where he knew it was mostly deserted. He dropped the bag to the ground, and squatted down before it. He took off his jacket and unzipped the bag. He took out his two side arms;
She looked at him with round eyes, and shook her head. “Nope.”
"Mr. Novak, thank you for coming in."
There was so much blood.
Would he want that? He probably would love it.
“Whatever.”
“Y-You don’t know!? Don’t bullshit me, Novak.”
“Well,
knew he wasn’t going to see his best friend anymore. There was this sadness around Ray.
But… he couldn’t do that now. He had more important things to attend to.
“Wha-What did I say?” Castiel stuttered out. His hands were clutching onto the counter for dear life.
Dean laughed at that as he polished off the plate in record time. He asked if he could have another piece, and Anna was more than happy to give it to him. When he finished his second piece, he asked for another piece to bring with him up to his room. Anna was pleased by this and placed another piece in his plate. Lora moved to grab it for him, but Dean took it and claimed that he wanted to eat it on his way to his bedroom. In reality, he was never comfortable with having maids taking care of him. He wasn't anyone special. He was an employee just as much as these ladies.
He threw himself back into work and started to plan out the biggest attack. He wanted to destroy everything that Alastair stood for. He wanted to burn everything to the ground. He wanted to erase the son of a bitch off the map. There wouldn’t be a person alive who would think of this man with a fond memory connected to him. There wasn’t going to be Italian family anymore.
Castiel's face cleared and he looked out of the window. “So. He has started war against us. Against me.”
The ceremony was absolutely beautiful. Emilio cried when he saw Anna, and cried some more when she read her vows to him, and cried even more when they exchanged the rings. Seeing a tough man break down like this on their wedding day was something that Dean didn’t get to witness every day. Anna’s dress looked expensive, and it fit her like a glove. It was long and had a small tail. It was a corset dress, but it had a chiffon bust to it that continued up to her shoulders, and down to her back. The embroilment on the dress was hand woven and it had real diamond rocks on it that glittered off under the sun. Emilio's suit was an expensive three piece one, which was designed by a famous designer that Dean didn’t know how to pronounce. He looked extremely hot in it. Thankfully, the weather wasn’t too hot today, because Dean was sure that he wouldn’t be able to pull it off.
“Oh,” Castiel turned to look at Dean. He was still pretty much naked, but he had put on boxers sometime during the night. “I guess you’re okay to come to bed.”
“I’ll get it,” Dean said. Castiel looked at Dean, and he indicated for Castiel to follow him out.
“I know what you mean. Trust me, I do.”
For his age, Castiel Novak looked pretty young. He looked sharp and had intense eyes. And the way he'd pose himself spoke volumes of who he was outside of their arrangement. There was the niggling feeling at the back of his neck where Dean felt like he was going to face more than he was ready for. But despite that, Dean felt like he was going to be in good hands.
“He went out. I don’t know where he went off to, or if he’s coming back,” Lora replied quickly, shrugging slightly.
“Uh yeah, they're in the truck,” Dean indicated to his car with a thumb over his shoulder.
“I’ll be there in forty,” Castiel didn’t wait for an answer. He ended the call and dropped his phone on the bed that was nearby. With the same hand he unzipped his pants and got his dick out. With his thumb, he pushed open Dean’s mouth and he placed his dick right in there. He didn’t give Dean time to adjust to it, since he started to move his hips in and out of Dean’s mouth.
“I think we gotta talk about this, boy.”
“Uh, hey,” Dean said, his voice gruff. He licked his lips in the quick way that he does whenever he was really nervous or uncomfortable about something. “I, uh, I came back to give this back.”
“I forgot about your panties,” Mr. Novak said as he dipped his head down and wrapped his lips around Dean’s dick. He had been steadily dripping cum, and the panties had gotten wet already. Dean’s hips buckled up. Mr. Novak moaned, placing kisses around the head. He pulled back and Dean tried not to sound too disappointed. “I’m gonna fuck you with the panties on, Dean.”
“I think so…” Castiel frowned and ran his hand through Dean’s hair. He stared at the way Dean’s hair got through his fingers, and seemed to fall back to the way it had been before his fingers disturbed them. He kept at it for couple of minutes, deep in thought, while Dean continued to look at him. They didn’t say anything to one another, just relaxing deeper in each other’s presence…
A tingle ran up and down his whole arm. Dean shook his hand a bit and tried not to pay too much attention to it. That’s when he heard the music. Curiosity piqued, Dean walked down the street a bit faster and Mr. Novak followed him. And just like that, Dean found the hole in the wall
“So...” Dean said, drifting off, waiting for Castiel to say something.
Dean gasped out, because he couldn’t make his lips work to form words. Instead, he lifted his hips up and helped Mr. Novak to take off his pants. Dean pushed himself up on the bed some more, and waited for Mr. Novak to come to bed again. The dark silhouette that Mr. Novak’s body made, made him look a bit more muscular than he actually was. Dean shivered when he heard Mr. Novak’s pants drop down on the floor. The bed dipped as Mr. Novak got on it, and he made his way up to Dean.
“Then why are you treating me this way?” Dean asked him again, his voice a bit rougher around the edges. “I did nothing wrong. I did everything you asked me to.”
“Old man?” Castiel asked, raising up an eyebrow. “Old man?”
“Who’s the new toy?” okay, that came out not in the way that Dean wanted to ask… and he wasn’t jealous. Nope.
“I gotta tell you something,” Dean whispered, and Castiel tightened his hold on the naked body.
“I loved everything that you made for us. Thank you, Anna.”
“Don’t,” Dean whispered. “Don’t do this.”
TW: Rape. Murder of certain characters.
“Ah, yes,” he said nodding. “That’s why I took Dean.”
Mr. Novak opened the door further and said, “After you.”
Dean said goodbye to Anna and walked out of the kitchen with Lora, from another door. This one took them right to the main hallway. It was already dark outside so the mansion's lights were all lit.
Castiel was going to stop his hands from exploring even more. He moved his head to his earlobe bit down on it and growled, “Patience.” And suddenly, Dean didn’t care about anything at all. There was a ringing in his ears and he was filled with lust once more.
“Why did you turn on me?” Castiel growled at Gabriel, who was desperately trying to get his breathing back under control.
“Did you enjoy your meal?” Anna asked as she grabbed a cake topper and continued working on it.
She walked to him and slapped him across the face. “Don’t you fucking dare tell me what to do. I don’t give a damn if they will come after me.”
They broke off the kiss, and Mr. Novak rested his forehead against Dean's. He breathed out softly through his lips and Dean lifted his hands to grab on to his wrists. He squeezed them in reassurance. Dean opened his eyes and noticed that Mr. Novak's eyes were closed. There was a slight frown on his forehead and his lips were still parted. His black button down shirt was tight on him, and Dean could see it straining on his body. With a start he realized that he never saw Mr. Novak without a shirt on. He had never seen him naked.
Castiel tried to swallow again, leaning against the counter. “I… I guess I am.”
“Tell your men to leave. I don't need protection.”
After they were done with their… reunion, Mr. Novak said he wanted to show him something. That something turned into Mr. Novak wearing his boots, and asking Dean if he was okay with getting his clothes a bit dirty. Since Dean didn’t dress up, just a T-shirt and jeans, he shrugged and said okay. Soon, Mr. Novak was holding his hand and dragging him out of the mansion, out on to the gardens, and walking straight to the edge of the forest. When Dean realized where they were going, he planted his feet firmly in the grass, crossed his arms over his chest and refused to budge.
?” He mocked the words as if they were the most disgusting thing he ever had to say. “He was pretty. The pretty little slut wanted to have a life, wanted to have a family. I told him to remember what he was, because he would never be able to get out of it fully.”
was heavily guarded from top to bottom, but Castiel had been staring at the map for so many weeks now, that he knew the secret passageways to the house by heart. They parked their cars away from the main road and the streets that definitely had people guarding them. Castiel and his men would take care of them later.
The three of them stood in a tense silence, but Castiel snapped back to action after he took labored and calculated breaths to calm down. “I need you to track down where this image was sent from, Charlie.” He held out Dean’s phone to Charlie.
“I gotta make a call,” Dean said as he made his way out to the patio.
“Remember when I told you I had two traitors in my family?”
“Why?” she asked. “Do you think I’ll look at you different if you were to tell me? Even though you already know I know what it is?”
“Dean,” Castiel whimpered, burying his face deeper into Dean’s chest. “It hurts,” he whispered. “It hurts so much.”
The color of his suit was in deep grey colors, his shoes were leather. His black button down held the same bulletproof material in it which his suit held as well. He didn’t have a tie on, so he left the three buttons close to his neck unbuttoned. He took a picture on his phone and sent it to Jess and Sam. He placed his phone back in his pocket and ran a hand over the light stubble on his cheek. Last night he wanted to shave it off, but Mr. Novak went a little crazy on it, and
“We can’t be together, Anna. He’s my employee. He needs this job. For personal reasons, which I cannot share with you.”
I was unsure as to what Kevin Tran's nationality is in the SPN-verse, so I took a chance with it and placed him in the Japanese nationality. If I'm wrong (which I'm sure I am??) please accept my apology. This is a work of fiction, so anyone can be anything, IMO x)
Dean licked his lips, and gave a small shake of a head. “What if something bad happens? What then? What if it’ll start thundering and shit like that? What are we supposed to do then?”
“Ready?” Mr. Novak asked and Dean nodded again. That was the only warning he got when Mr. Novak moved his arm and snapped it against Dean's chest.
“Understood.”
Mr. Novak's hands were shaking as he covered his mouth with his hand. His blue eyes were shining and his body was shuddering. Dean stood by the door. It seemed that he was having a break down, but while he watched he realized that Mr. Novak was trying to contain his emotions.
It was dark outside, some lights here and there, flickered on and off, as the tenants of other buildings puttered around their own apartments. Castiel took a sip from his drink and looked down. There were 3 black jeeps in front of the building and across it. He knew that his men were down there. Few of them standing outside the door. Castiel wanted nothing else but to send everyone home to rest, but they wouldn’t budge.
Once they were done with cleaning up Dean, and with Castiel adding some lotion on his bruises, and thoroughly groping Dean’s ass, Castiel walked to the counter in the kitchen and grabbed his cap. He placed it back on and waited for Dean to walk him out. Dean stared at him for a moment, before he said, “Stay for the night.”
“Hold your ass open for me, doll,” Mr. Novak said and Dean obeyed. He placed his cheek on the sofa and grabbed on to his ass cheeks to spread them open. He didn’t give Dean any warning as he went in and Dean’s eyes shuttered close at the feeling.
“Yeah, sure. I’d love to give them a once over,” Dean said with a shrug. He felt Mr. Novak relax beside him and after that the conversations flowed around him. Dean was sure that he’d need a moment, or half a millennium for his heart rate to get back to normal and for his legs to start working again after this dinner. But all in all, it was a successful one.
“If Anna hadn’t managed to do so for all of these years, I’m sure he won’t get fat because of some garlic bread that I made.”
“I know. That’s why I don’t want him to know the gender of the kid. Not now, anyway.”
Dean nodded and said, "Yeah. Positive. Thank you."
“Not stalking. Just… keeping you safe.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said, with a prideful smile.
“How did you know?” he asked, his voice low.
Alastair cackled at that and the sound made Castiel shudder. “Oh, she’s in good hands,” he replied. “Gordon has her.”
Dean swallowed as Mr. Novak stood before him and regarded him with open lust. He had an unwavering gaze that Dean was sure he used on a lot of people when he wanted to get shit done, and fast. Dean didn't know what he wanted him to do, but he knew he'd do it in a heartbeat.
“Hmm,” Castiel said on the matter. “Have they spoke any words about why we are getting the wrong orders?” the last part was said by him raising his voice slightly.
“Yes, sir.”
A chill ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the AC blazing all the way up in the room. He knew exactly what Gabriel meant, but he cleared his throat and said, “It's a family emergency. So if you can help, I'll be more than grateful.”
Castiel’s lips pursed together in disgust as she tried to chew and speak at the same time. Castiel sipped on his coffee as he ate a piece of toast with it. “That is disgusting,” he finally said, shaking his head in exasperation.
“You’re having a boy?”
“Hm?” Castiel hummed, but Dean shook his head again.
A week away from the time Castiel had to leave for Spain, he was making his way down the hall to his bedroom, when Dean burst out of his bedroom. Castiel jumped back in surprise, and thought something bad has happened, when he registered Dean’s excitement and the way his cheeks blushed from it. His eyes were wide and he had a big smile on his face.
“That’s a good enough answer,” Castiel said, lowering the arm that he held up on his leg first. “Thank you for this.” He hesitated for only a moment, before he pulled the trigger on the one that was held to the boy’s head. The boy only had a moment to draw in a sharp breath, before he slumped down and didn’t move.
Dean took another steadying breath, shook his head and walked to the door that Mr. Novak indicated to. Dean had to go through a narrow hallway, and then he was standing in a vast kitchen. Dean was passionate about cooking. He had cooked meals for him and Sam for way too many years, since their mother passed away. He could make the best burgers, from scratch, and variety of pies. Maybe one day he'll use this place to make something for Novak...
He covered his eyes with his hand and sighed, trying to calm his wildly beating heart in his chest. He was nervous about this whole thing. Castiel didn’t feel like he was strong enough for this conversation. He had a half made up thought to call Sam in for this, but… they weren’t on speaking terms exactly. Sam had been avoiding him like a plague whenever he’d come in to see his brother. Even when Castiel would sit in the corner of the room, and do nothing but exist.
his ass to move Dean's boxers down with his hands… Down his legs and to the floor. He tapped at Dean's legs and Dean helped him to get his boxers off. Dean's dick was half hard, but it was going to get steadily hard because of how Mr. Novak was touching.
There was a car beside him. The windows were see-through, and that gave Castiel an opportunity to check out the driver. The guy didn’t look like him exactly, but he still had green eyes and young face. His eyes were hooded as he stared at Castiel’s car. He licked his lips slowly. Castiel was glad that his car’s windows were tinted, so that the guy wouldn’t be able to know who was ogling at him.
“Collapsed lung, fractured rib, dislocated shoulder. His blood pressure is high, but it will go down soon enough. He is mostly asleep, but I could also call it a coma. He’s been severely dehydrated. He’s going to survive this, but he’s going to need some time to recover from it.”
“Does it matter?”
“Alice will take your stuff up to your room, if that's okay,” Mr. Novak said. Dean hadn’t noticed her before; she had a slightly smaller frame, and mousy hairstyle. She had a small smile on her face and she was standing over to the side, with her hands behind her back. Dean nodded his consent at her. He was rewarded with a slightly bigger smile from them both. “Shall we?” Mr. Novak asked turning his body around, towards the house.
“We could, but Mr. Novak loves taking the tour there himself. So...”
Of course he was going to interfere. Of course he was going to take care of the only person he learnt how to truly care for and love. He was going to help Dean out however and whichever way he could. He wasn’t going to back down from it. He was going to make the people who sold drugs to him bleed until there was nothing left of them. Even though he wasn’t active in this life, as much as he should’ve been, he still held that much authority in everyone’s lives and in the city.
“Hi,” Dean whispered, his hands uncurling from Castiel's shirt, and smoothing out the slight wrinkles in the fabric.
Castiel raised his hand and knocked on it couple of times. He strained his ear to hear any sound, but there was nothing. He knocked again and this time he heard a shuffle and a thump from inside. He locked his hands behind his back, and waited for the door to open. He heard the bolt slide, and the door unlock, before it got swung open and Castiel reminded himself to breathe.
“Did they set a limit on how much?”
And then he turned around and walked away from Castiel.
“I’m wearing these glove like, hand sponges, so I can wash you up without touching you,” Dean said in a low voice, but the quietness of the bathroom made it sound like he was screaming.
“I wasn’t counting.”
“Touch yourself, and you won't be able to seat for a week,” and then he was out of the bedroom, the door closing after him with a soft click.
“It could get dangerous,” he answered truthfully. Well, as truthfully as he could. He couldn't tell Dean that he was at war with the Italian mob. Although, people of this town, and probably the state, knew about their feud.
Dean activated the camera without unlocking his phone, needing to protect his privacy and the image of his daughter, and posed his phone in between them, directed at the mirror. They looked a bit awkward and not into it. He said so to Mr. Novak who just huffed and moved his arm to wrap it around Dean’s waist, effectively bringing them close to each other. Dean smiled at the proximity of them and started to take pictures.
“Yes, you are right, I do have stuff to tell you,” she said, and Castiel snapped his mouth shut. “God,” she muttered, shaking her head. “I have been so angry with you, and so bitter that I…”
“You’re fine,” Dean said and smiled at him. “Happens to all of us. Here,” Dean shifted and from the back of his pocket he took out a pack of napkins. The stranger took it from him, with a nod and a thank you, and he started to dab dry his papers, and the bag next to him.
Castiel looked at Dean. He swallowed through the clog in his throat. His heart was beating a bit too wildly in his chest, and his breathing was becoming more ragged. “Dean…” he breathed out.
His legs were pushed up slightly, since the chains there were slightly looser. He started to writhe and wiggle, the chains clanging as he tried to move away and just to stop this whole thing, but he couldn’t. He was trapped.
Close enough for Dean to feel how tense Mr. Novak was and he could do nothing, but stand there and wait for the ceremony to end. Dean could hear his measured breathing, and Dean knew that he wasn’t doing as fine as he led everyone else to believe. After the ceremony would end, they were going to head back to the mansion. Dean didn't know what Mr. Novak’s plans was, but he hoped that he could have him alone for couple of hours. Dean's head was swirling around with ideas and from the corner of his eyes, he saw Mr. Novak turned his head to his side, stared for a few seconds, and then he was looking forward.
“You're thinking too much... How do you feel about letting go some of that tension?” Mr. Novak suggested in a low voice, his hand trailing up and down his thigh, lightly. Dean didn't even notice his hand, until now.
“Oh.” Castiel said, not knowing what else to say. In the end he settled for silence and looking out of the window again. After a moment, Charlie grabbed his hand, squeezed his fingers, and released it.
“Yes, it was okay,” Castiel said, after a moment he added. “Punishment comes after a crime after all.”
“Are you a journalist for
“He’s-He’s at the east side of the manor. He’s got this-this place in here, which is like a torture room. But it looks like a warehouse,” the boy blabbed in nervousness. “Please don’t kill me. I gave you everything I know.”
“You ready for this?” asked Mr. Novak, his voice breathless in his ear. Dean shuddered from it and nodded. “Good boy. Get on your hands and knees for me, however way you want.”
“I do. And I will, sir. Now,” Dean said as he took a step back. His dick hung heavy between his legs. It was still red and looked painfully hard, and Castiel resisted the urge to touch him. “You have to leave. Because if you won’t, my willpower will fail me, and well…” Dean didn’t need to continue with this thought, since Castiel understood what he meant.
Dean stared at him, and for the first time during the day, Dean’s eyes weren’t filled with hatred, but more of softness and undeniable trust. Castiel breathed out easily, and he reached his hand out to get the gun from Dean. And the next thing Castiel knew, he was hugging Dean close to his chest with only his one arm wrapped around Dean’s shoulder. Dean took a shaky breath, but he didn’t release his hold on Castiel.
Mr. Novak leaned in to him, when he took another bite from the cake and let out yet another moan, and said, “If you won’t stop those noises, I’m gonna have to bend you over my knee. Right here. Right now.” And Dean promptly started to choke on his cake. He turned his head to glare at Mr. Novak because what the fuck.
. Castiel teared his eyes away from his lips, before he’d do anything stupid such as leaning forward and kiss him in the middle of the hospital. “Well, we’ll just tell them I work for you. Just try to avoid giving out any details to them. They can get nosy. If you can’t handle any of them, let me know.”
Later that night when they were getting ready for bed, and Mr. Novak was already in bed, with his glasses on and a book in his hand, Dean laid back beside him with nothing on, but his underwear. “Hey, Anna asked me to stop by her house again to help out with the wedding,” he said. “I’m going. I hope that’s okay, right?”
“I didn’t know that.” It slipped out of his mouth before he could think better about it.
“It's always in a great condition. I do have a mechanic.”
Mr. Novak gave him a flat look and tugged him on his waist, down to his lap. Dean let out a low grunt as he fully sat down on Mr. Novak’s lap, earning him a satisfied smile. His hand went under Dean’s shirt and started to rub his back up and down. Dean tensed at first, but then relaxed.
Dean swallowed through a dry mouth, and tightened his hold on the body underneath him. Unwilling to give up what he had, and knowing what it could mean to him in the long run… what it meant to him right now. He knew, deep down, it was going to cause him problems, but for now, right here right now, he was willing to bask in it as much as he could.
Next thing he knew, Mr. Novak was kissing him and then he was being fucked. Dean had no idea when Mr. Novak managed to get his dick out, and entered Dean, but he did that so effortlessly that Dean bit down on Novak's lower lip. This only made Novak to move his hips up harder and faster into Dean.
“You’re doing great,” she said, with a mouthful of cookies.
“Azazel,” Castiel said. He looked down at the table, noticing the half-finished pizza, coffee, coke in a glass, and scattered napkins. He tried not to grimace at the table, just barely.
“Let me take you home,” the words left Dean’s mouth even before he had formed his thoughts all the way through.
“We always judge a book by its cover. Sometimes it matches the pages, and other times…”
“But-“
Castiel sat there for a moment, before he asked, “Why did you invite me over, Dean?”
Sam was buried deep in paperwork when Dean and Natalie got to his office. He lit up when he saw Natalie running up to him. He only had time to push back from his desk, and stand up, before Natalie pummeled at his legs and hugged him close. He let out a low ‘
When Dean woke up in the morning he felt rested. Safe from his body being numb, and dull with a throbbing pain, his eyes felt like they were burning. But otherwise he felt fine. He was lying down on his side, blinking at the white unfamiliar wall of a bedroom he was sleeping at. Yesterday’s event came back to him slowly, but surely, and soon, he was sitting up in bed and thinking about how fucked up his life had become and how much he fucked up himself.
