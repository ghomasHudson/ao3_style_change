“What? No!” Dean exclaimed, trying to pull back but Cas continued to hold him. “Cas, what are you talking about? You can’t do that. You’d be human.”
“Dean,” he replied, motioning for another shot.
Her smile softened at his words and the mischief was gone from her gaze, replaced by a sweetness that left him wordless. “Honey, is it your first time trying this new thing?”
Castiel smiled even brighter at the nickname but didn’t comment against it. “I had religious parents growing up.”
“Get a grip, Winchester!” he berated himself. “You’re having dinner with a really sweet, ridiculously good-looking guy. Dad’s not here anymore. Its just you and Cas. You’re getting to know him. Everything’s good. Stop acting like a pre-pubescent teenage girl.”
He took a deep breath at her thought and felt Cas’ shoulders drop at the mention. Dean no longer carried the anger he once did and turned to Cas with a small smile instead.
“Love muffin?” Cas asked, laughing at the look of horror Dean gave him. “What about Baby Cakes? Sexy Pants? Sugar Lips?”
Lifting his gaze to the bar several feet away, Dean took a deep breath and started making his way. He was still dressed in his black jeans and tee, the dark green flannel covering his arms. Jess had bought it for him at Christmas a year back, teasing that it brought out his eyes. His palms were sweaty, his nerves on end but he forced himself to grab the door and step inside. The moment he did, the world didn't end the way his irrational mind had worked up. No one paid him any attention, the loud music blasting through the stereo overhead. One end of the vast room had scattered tables and booths, full of occupants throwing back their drinks and laughing away. The middle was a small dance floor, couples gyrating against each other, lost in their own world. When Dean’s eyes caught on two men holding each other close, exchanging small pecks, Dean flushed and forced his feet towards the end of the bar, hopping onto a stool and leaning forward on the counter. The bartender was a looker, her dark hair falling over her shoulders, tattoo peeking out from the small of her back when she reached up for a bottle on the top shelf. Any other day and Dean would have turned on the charm but tonight was different. Tonight, he was celebrating his promotion and allowing himself to maybe experience something that for years, he had wanted but denied.
“We met here,” he spoke aloud after a few moments, talking to Cas as if he were there. “You walked in, lights going haywire. I’ll never forget it.”
“Dean?” Cas asked, his voice breaking through Dean’s thoughts.
Dean switched on the engine and pulled through the open field. Once they were back on the main road towards the bunker, he turned his attention over. “What do you wanna call me?”
“Thank you, Chief,” Dean said, smiling at the older man who had been a second Father to him. “For everything, not just this.”
Dean felt the same fluttering inside him as he took the words to heart. Could it be that simple? Could Cas choose humanity, to set aside his Grace and live a life with him?
He nodded and followed her gaze again until their eyes fell on a man sitting at the bar several feet away, staring down at his beer with a cute frown. The mop of dark hair was messy atop his head, the navy shirt striking nicely against his skin.
When Cas had disappeared moments later, the Empty tearing him away, Dean realized he had missed his chance. Cas was gone, perhaps forever, leaving Dean alone in the shadows of the room. His phone had buzzed minutes later, Sam calling him over and over on repeat. But all Dean could do was sit frozen against the wall. All he could do was drop his face in his hands and silently cry in his misery. Castiel, Angel of Thursday, friend, and soulmate. The latter description would have scared Dean a few years back. He would have denied and ignored, pretended that the connection they shared was nothing more than brotherly. But he mourned Cas in a way that was different from Sam. After all these years, he finally understood the disparity.
So many words had been exchanged over the years, words that held hidden meanings and yet in the end, so much had been left unsaid. Mourning Cas had been nothing new for Dean but each time he lost his best friend, each time was harder than the last. Losing him after his confession felt like a jagged knife had been twisted into Dean’s heart, holding in place. He had been angry at himself for not speaking up in that moment; angry for so much time that had gone to waste; angry that he had been so blind for all those years. But Jack had proven to be a merciful God when he had rescued Cas from the Empty, transporting him back to the bunker after Christmas night. Dean had stood frozen in place, eyes locked with Cas, neither really believing the moment. Sam had been first to greet him, hugging Cas close in a way that signified their close friendship bond. Cas had smiled at Sam but his eyes had kept flickering back to Dean, a myriad of emotions playing out on his face. He was hopeful and wary, nervous, and happy, waiting and watching until Dean had finally crossed the room and closed the gap between them. Holding Cas close, pinning the Angel to his chest, all Dean could do was tilt his face inwards and breathe him in. Tentative arms had wrapped around him as Cas had slowly given in. They had stood there, holding each other, neither willing to speak from fear of waking and discovering it had all been a dream. When Dean had finally pulled back, Sam had disappeared down the hall. Dean had wanted to say everything all at once but he’d stepped back instead. The light had dimmed in Cas’ eyes and as much as Dean had wanted to reach out and smooth the frown away, he had an idea of how he wanted things to play out.
“Well, Dean, haven’t seen you here before. Your first time?” she asked, watching as he downed his second drink.
Growing up with John as the only parent, Dean had learned to hide certain parts of himself over the years. His Father had never been one for showing weakness, always getting aggravated when Dean or Sam had shown excitement for something that fell far away from what his definition of masculinity was. On Dean's seventh birthday, John had taken both kids to the local store. It had been one of his better days until the moment Dean had reached for a doll instead of a G.I. Joe. The fit that John had thrown inside the aisle had left Dean in tears. No son of his would like anything queer. As a child, Dean couldn’t understand the difference. Once he had started crying, three year old Sam had done the same. The other shoppers had given John the stink eye as he left the rest of their purchases and dragged both boys out of the establishment. He’d backhanded Dean so hard in the lot, Dean had stood frozen in place. John had seemed shocked at his own actions for a quick moment but his anger had returned as he pushed both boys into their car and sped away. They had never gone back for toys after that.
“Cas, you gotta know that I never thought anyone could even come close to mattering to me as much as Sam. Not even Dad came that close. Not even Mom,” Dean started. “For so long, it was Sammy and me. It was always Sammy and me. But then you showed up and you saved me from Hell and you were always just there.”
Dean smiled at the direct words. “I think we can do that.”
Dean took a breath at the deep, gravelly voice and felt a sudden heat spring up inside him. He peeked towards them and saw Douchebag leaning even closer, the movement making the man finally tilt his head in that direction.
Dean wasn’t sure how to take the words but he offered Pamela a wave and followed Cas towards the entrance. When they were out on the sidewalk, the noise of the bar now a muted sound in the distance, Dean looked up when he felt Cas gently reach for his arm.
“Have you died and gone to Heaven?” Dean replied.
Cas’s tilted his head, his expression growing thoughtful. “Perhaps don’t call me ‘buddy’ any longer?”
a car. What you drive is a cheap impression of one.”
“I like hearing you call me that,” Cas whispered, lowering himself down, teeth grazing across Dean’s collarbone and up his jaw.
“Castiel.”
“If it’s about that girl from last week, I swear I thought her name was Lola!” Dean defended.
Cas frowned, peering past him to look inside the room. “Seems practical.”
“Congratulations on the promotion,” Pamela said with a smile before leaning further in. “You looking for some fun while you’re here? Guy or girl?”
“Castiel,” he tried again.
,” Cas corrected, reminding them of the conversation they had once shared in Bobby’s hospital room years ago. “Dean, it was for you. All of it. I care for Sam. He is a brother, a friend. My family. But it started, all of it, with you.
Dean cleared this throat and ordered burgers, fries and sweet tea for them both. When the waitress left their drinks and disappeared behind the counter, Dean gave a chuckle that had Cas turning towards him.
“Sammy, have I taught you nothing? Nothing at all?” Dean started, his voice bordering a whine as he swept his arm backwards toward the Impala. “
She opened her mouth to comment but stopped when she caught Dean’s gaze. Instead, she turned towards her boyfriend, smiling up at Sam. “Too tired for dinner?”
“Yes, and it’s my choice and I choose this life with you,” Cas said, his voice growing quiet. “I choose to grow old with you.”
“Don't wait up. I'll see you in the morning. I love you, too.”
“How about classic rock?” he asked, leaning on his elbow. “Zeppelin, Springsteen, The Stones, Bob Seger?”
He shook his head as his voice began to break, tears welling in his eyes.
“Would you retire?” Cas suddenly asked, the words bringing Dean out of his thoughts.
“Bobby,” Dean started, blinking heavily at the words. “Gordon’s got more years than me on Truck.”
“Dean,” Sam started but he held his hand up and shook his head.
“I take it you complained a lot to your Mother growing up?”
Douchebag stuttered in offense but quickly disappeared through the crowd. Dean watched as the man shook his head and turned back to his beer. As much as he enjoyed watching Douchebag strike out, he wasn’t sure his anxiety would make him a better replacement. He’d never picked up a guy before, never even flirted out of fear of how John would have reacted. Even now, a small part of him felt that same, irrational panic. He hadn’t seen his Father in years but a part of him was still worried the man would suddenly materialize out of thin air.
“It was different back then and everything is different now,” Cas reminded. “Doing this is my choice, Dean. I choose happiness and you are at the very root of it. It’s why the Empty took me. You are my true happiness, Dean. You always have been, even before I understood what any of it even meant.”
“Yeah, he does and he’s a great firefighter but he doesn’t have what you have,” Bobby cut him off again. “You’re a damn great firefighter, Dean. One of the best I’ve ever seen. You’ve taken all the classes, you’re quick on your feet, you’re smart and more than anything, you’re hungry for it. Always the first one through the door and the last one coming out. The men love you, Dean. They all look up to you, especially Sam.”
“The hell have you been Googling?” Dean barked through his own laughter. “None of that Pizza Man porno crap, Cas. You call me any of that in bed and I’m gonna kick your ass out of it.”
“MTV? What’s MTV?” Castiel asked, following his daughter to the door.
*****
“Yes,” Cas replied quietly.
“Not ready to talk about it yet, Sammy,” he said, closing the topic off as he stepped backwards. “Don’t wait up.”
He’d dated different women the past few years, having relationships with a couple that lasted longer than a weekend in bed. Anna had been the first. She and Dean had met at their local grocery store, both reaching for the last paper towel like a scene in a cheesy romance. But she had been cute and witty and Dean had been quick to charm her away. Their relationship had lasted four months before Anna had put an end. She cared for him deeply but felt that Dean was not all in. They had parted as friends and when he ran into her every now and then, it was always with smiles on their faces. A few months of one night stands had followed, earning Dean a reputation until a bad fire had brought Dean to his knees, not in a good way. Jess had poked and prodded until Dean finally relented, visiting the local gym and accepting the passes she’d given for yoga classes. One look at the instructor and Dean had vowed to make the class a habit. He and Lisa had gotten started hot and heavy. Once the initial heat had worn off, they’d fallen into a comfortable relationship. Her young son Ben had been a bonus. Dean had loved showing the kid the ropes, teaching him everything he had passed on to Sam, wishing his own Father had been different. But after a year of domestic bliss, the itch had started to rise again. As happy as Dean thought he had been, there was something missing between them. He loved Lisa and especially loved the kid but the gap he had wanted to fill was something she couldn’t provide. Their relationship had ended more roughly than it had with Anna. Lisa had accused him of sleeping around, of not loving her and everything else he could imagine. She had been wrong about it all and eventually apologized for her verbal beating but one part of her words had rang true. The love he felt for her was less than what she and Ben deserved. Their second parting had been kinder as Lisa had hugged him tight, wishing his next love would be his truest, one that would allow him to open himself and his heart the way she had wanted. He still saw Ben on occasion, dropping by Lisa’s to fix a leaky sink or mow the lawn every now and then. They considered each other friends but Dean could always see the lingering look that Lisa gave him.
“Are you gonna give me the Impala?” Sam asked, twirling the keys in his hand.
“At least I can hear my own thoughts and yours,” Cas almost shouted, the words making Dean smile for the hundredth time in ten minutes. “I mean, conversation is important, isn’t it? Or is it one glance across the bar and sex is a promise?”
“Cast-i-what?” he asked, loving the sound of the man's laugh.
What he wanted was to reach out and pull Cas against him, to lose himself in those Blue Eyes, feel the touch of his lips and a strong embrace around him. He wanted so much so quickly that it scared Dean back a step. Before Cas could extract himself and free their hands, Dean’s eyes caught sight of an eyelash. Swallowing hard, he reached up with a slightly shaky hand and pulled the lash from Cas’ cheek.
“It’s fine,” Cas said, reaching out to squeeze his arm again. “Gabriel calls me Cassie all the time.
The endearment slipped out and Dean froze, looking up slowly. The broad smile on Cas’s face instantly made his anxiety fade away. Within seconds, Cas was on him, two magnets drawn together, unable to stay apart. They kissed again and again, the cold night air going unnoticed. They laughed when they drew back, Dean letting one final kiss drop against Cas’s temple. Dragging himself away, he walked to the other side and watched Cas clamber inside. Hesitating for a moment, he lifted his gaze towards the sky, eyes shining bright, smile lifting the corners of his mouth.
“Perhaps you should drive faster,” Cas directed, all casualness vanishing from his voice.
Climbing behind Baby’s wheel with Cas beside him and a cooler full of beer in the backseat, Dean pulled away from the bunker and drove out into the dark. Less than an hour remained until midnight, until the crippling year of heartache and misery could finally be left behind. They drove together in comfortable silence, trading occasional glances as the music played quietly in the background. When he was miles away from the bunker, Dean pulled the Impala down a country road, stopping in the middle of a field. Cas tossed him a look of confusion but joined Dean as they slid onto Baby’s hood outside, the cooler left on the grass below. Leaning backwards, they stared up at the night sky, littered with stars that filled the darkness overhead.
of you.”
The smile Cas gave him made his breath catch. It was full of a promise of things to come, of everything they had long denied themselves or been too inept or stubborn to admit out loud.
Blue Eyes sighed heavily and twirled in his seat only to freeze when his gaze landed on Dean’s face. Their eyes locked as they stared at one another, a long, charged moment passing until both cleared their throats.
Dean took a shaky breath and ran a hand across his own eyes, letting the words sink in. When he looked up again, Cas was watching him with the focus of a hawk, studying his every reaction, trying to measure his thoughts.
A sudden spark at the end of the barn made him slowly lift his gaze. Blinking through the wetness in his eyes, he watched as the spark disappeared and then another took its place moments later, brighter than the last. The sparks came one after another, intensifying until a brightness filled the entrance to the barn. Dean steered his gaze away just as the walls around him began to shake. Stumbling backwards, he reached inside his pocket for the demon knife he always carried. A quick bolt of thunder and the light disappeared.
“I choose you, Dean. I will always choose
Bobby smiled warmly, nudging his shoulder once more. “That’ll make us all happy, Dean. You know that, boy.”
“Are you alright?” Cas asked, watching him the way he always did.
“And you’d do that?” Dean asked, needing the words repeated. “You wouldn’t get bored or antsy or tired?
“No more being afraid, Dean. We’re free.”
He felt another grip and this time, Cas had taken his hand. Their fingers slowly twined in a way lovers reached for each other after years of togetherness. It was so soon to feel this way for a stranger but as much as Dean felt nervous, something in Cas’ eyes grounded him. It felt right, standing there, holding hands.
“Pretty cool place,” Dean said with a glance around them.
“How could you tell me I changed you? How could you tell me that you cared about everything because
to me. You weren’t just an ally anymore, Cas. You were my best friend. My family.”
Looking down, the sadness he felt washed over him once more. A part of him wanted to leave the barn, to drive back to the bunker and force the pain away like always. To bury his ache so deep that eventually he was numb from it all, as if it had disappeared. But now that they were free, now that their lives weren’t in peril, all he could do was think. As much as he wanted to shut his brain off and forget, he couldn’t bring himself to do it anymore.
“Hold up,” Dean said, breaking his lips free and laughing fondly when Cas chased him and stole another kiss. “Sweetheart, hold up a second. I don’t exactly want us to do the deed here, out in the open.”
“Yeah,” Dean finally spoke up, motioning with his chin over his shoulder. “Was thinking of putting a second nightstand in here.”
He saw her nametag and looked up with a smile. “Something dark and hard, Pamela.”
*****
He waited a few beats before he found the courage to meet Cas’ eyes. What he saw was a warmth that made him never want to leave that moment.
“But even if Sam didn’t know, I wouldn’t hide this, Cas. I don’t want to,” Dean added. “You’re it for me, buddy.”
Besides, I wouldn’t be destroying my Grace. We would keep it hidden somewhere safe in case a need ever surfaced,” Cas said, choosing his words carefully. “But I would like to share the rest of my life with you. If you’ll have me.”
Dean could feel the faint blush across his cheeks and quickly cleared his throat to force it away. “I don’t know what to say.”
Dean chuckled at her frankness, feeling the heat on his cheeks as he rubbed the back of his neck. “Normally a hot chick but tonight I figured maybe something different.”
“Yes,” Cas replied, the firm response and the low voice making Dean shift in place. “I would like to be close to you, Dean, in any and every way you allow.”
Bobby grunted again. “You wanna thank me? Get your ass over to my place one night this week for dinner. Ellen’s been driving me nuts all angry that she hasn’t seen you.”
She laughed and reached for a bottle a few feet away, pouring him a glass and one for herself. When she leaned in and clinked her glass against his, he smiled and downed the drink, squinting only a little as the liquid burnt his throat. Alcohol had become an escape over the years. As much as he had vowed to never follow in his Father’s footsteps, he couldn’t stop himself from turning to the booze whenever he was at his lowest. Tonight, it gave him courage, loosening up the nerves that had him wound up tight.
“What are you all talking about?”
Cas tilted his head in a way that made Dean’s insides turn to mush. “Are you volunteering to educate me?”
“I think it already came true,” Cas murmured but he blew the lash anyway.
He wasn’t sure what he had expected but it wasn’t for Blue Eyes to turn fully in his seat towards him, reaching a possessive hand out to grip Dean at his waist. Dean had to remind himself to breathe as the move locked their knees together and brought their faces close within inches. In the near distance, he heard an angry muttering and heavy footsteps before the loud sound of the entrance slamming made its way to his ears. He figured once Alastair was gone, Blue Eyes would put distance between them and drop the charade. Instead, the man's fingers seemed to grip his side even tighter for a brief pause. Breathing deeply, Blue Eyes finally tilted away and dropped his arm back to his own lap, smiling up at Dean with a sweet tilt to his mouth.
“Rough night?”
“So I gotta find myself someone for Ellen to lay off?”
Now, standing at the edge of his doorway looking in, he felt an emptiness that had long been considered nameless. After everything that had happened the past year, he and Sam and Jack had finally defeated Chuck. The crushed look on Chuck’s face when Jack absorbed his powers was one that Dean would never forget. Once Jack had rebuilt the whole world and brought people back, he had bid the Winchesters farewell, promising that the God he had become would be different than the last.
. He had wanted to say so much more but had been stunned silent by it all. Nothing had made sense. Cas loved him? Romantically? How could that have been? Had Dean been so blind not to see it all those years?
Two birds with one stone. Wasn’t that the saying Sam always repeated? Sliding away from Alastair, Dean rushed forward and finally took the seat he wanted. Taking a deep breath, he turned towards Blue Eyes with fake confidence.
Dean smirked and Cas was quickly on him. The kiss was all tongue and teeth, bruising their lips red. Moving backwards blindly, Dean stumbled into the bedroom that was no longer only his. With the door being locked behind them, to rule out any form of interruption, Cas yanked off his trenchcoat and tossed it to the chair beside them. Dean was on his back, moving towards the pillows when Cas climbed over and covered his body. Looking up into those blue eyes, Dean understood the importance of this second chance. He understood the significance of the choice he had made and at the end of it all, he had chosen happiness. Their lips pressed together, a promise between them. After years clouded by anguish, Dean felt the weight of choosing to love Cas and accepting that love in return, deep in his chest and all the way through to his soul. The ache he had felt inside him for so long was finally gone.
Dean closed his eyes and felt a single tear slip out. His heart was full of so many emotions, overwhelmed but elated. When he felt a gentle press against his cheek, he leaned against the touch, seeking its warmth, unable to pull away. He opened his eyes and stared into the deepest blue. It was a gaze that had watched over him, shattered, and healed him and loved him in the same breath. It was everything he had always secretly longed for, a sense of belonging, a feeling of home and safety and devotion. All the steps they had taken, all the choices they had made had led them to this moment. But Chuck was no longer holding the reins. When their lips finally pressed together in the silence, it was because they both wanted it. Their bond, forged in Hell when Castiel had first gripped him, was a connection that had never broken against all odds.
, giving his all to Dean. How could he choose differently?
above it all, loved him in a way that had suddenly made so many shared moments make sense. Dean had been too overwhelmed to do much more than say Cas’ name in those crucial seconds. But as he had sat there on the floor after Cas had been taken and repeated every last confessed word to himself, all the puzzle pieces had finally fit in place. Friendship and family were no longer good enough to describe what Cas meant to him. Cas was all of those things to Sam but with Dean, it was different. With Dean, it had always been different.
“That last fire was rough. Think I’ll just turn in early.”
“Come on, Cassie. Let’s get you dressed so I can take you out,” Gabriel pressed him, raising his eyebrows in a lewd gesture.
“No, I’m good if you are,” Sam said, dropping a kiss on top of her head.
“Dean, I don’t understand. What happened? What did I do?” Cas pleaded, confusion bursting through.
Releasing a heavy sigh, he made his presence known and walked forward. Eileen leaned against Sam’s shoulder, his arm immediately wrapping around her as they turned towards him. Sam’s eyes squinted as he took in Dean’s appearance, focusing on the jacket, handprint visible in the light.
“So you can go and find someone, Dad!” Olivia was the first to speak. “Maybe a nice lady, maybe a nice guy.
“Well, isn’t he sweet?” the waitress said, tossing Dean a wink. “Seems like a keeper.”
“It’s your birthday,” he said, his voice intimate between them. “Make a wish.”
“I’ve heard of those names,” Cas said with a frown.
“She’s right, Cassie.”
“Chief Sinclair’s good with it?” Dean asked, unable to mask his surprise.
had been too much for Dean to handle at that moment. Cas hadn’t just said that he loved humanity. He had loved
But as much as he welcomed the sweet moment, the heaviness in his own heart refused to leave. Their makeshift family was back together but the biggest part for Dean was still missing. His mind traveled back to that day as it constantly did, to Cas's confession before the Empty had taken him and Billie. So much had been professed in those few short moments.
“Nothing, Cas. Nothing at all. It’s my fault for being such an idiot,” Dean spat before he turned on his heels and jogged down the road, ignoring the looks he received from people all around.
. Twelve long years had gone by and it felt like no time had passed at all. Opening his eyes, Dean made his way around the barn with slow footsteps.
Dean gave a faint nod, not really grasping the words until Eileen reached forward and touched his arm.
Dean swallowed hard at the words. For so long, emotions had been difficult for him to address. The way they had been raised, all the pain he and Sam had survived, expressing himself had always been a challenge. But with Chuck defeated, the world no longer ending, Sam happy with Eileen and Cas back from the dead, Dean felt his discomfort slowly ease away. This wasn’t a one night stand with a nameless stranger, a way to pass the time and scratch an itch. This was Cas, his best friend, the person he loved so profoundly he could barely comprehend it. He wanted to do this right. They both deserved it.
“Cas,” Dean tried again. “If we do this, I can’t handle you taking off or disappearing to who knows where without a word whenever something big or small happens. I can’t handle you going off for days or weeks without any word from you at all. I’m not saying you can’t do your own thing but it can’t be like it was. I’ll lose my damn mind.”
He saw the glistening in Cas’ eyes and quickly realized the pet name he had said. Dean chuckled through his flush but Cas reached for his head and held him in place.
When he looked up, Cas’ smile had grown softer than before. They held eyes for another few moments until the patron behind Dean bumped into him, sending him forward a few inches. He was nowhere near the danger of falling off his stool but Cas had reached out anyway, gripping his side in protection. Dean felt his entire face flush and cursed himself under his breath. Why was he acting like a teenage girl around some guy he hardly knew? Making a fool of himself every second?
Three hours passed before he pulled the Impala to a stop behind an abandoned barn. He hadn’t even realized where he was driving until he stopped. Climbing out to his feet, he made his way through the darkness, boots crunching on the ground. Leaving the barn doors open to allow light inside, he made his way through the entrance and stopped a few feet in. Glancing around himself, he closed his eyes and was back in time, standing shoulder to shoulder with Bobby, guns full of rock salt gripped ready. The doors had opened, the lights sparking around them and suddenly,
“Yes, but my brother always has nefarious intentions,” Cas grumbled. “He wants me to do the ‘horizontal tango’ tonight.”
“Not why I wanna do it,” Dean mumbled but before Cas could question him, Sam popped his head around the corner.
“Nah,” Dean said, his voice growing quiet. “She died when I was four. Never really got around to it.”
She leaned forward to catch Dean’s eyes again. “You joining us tonight?”
“I love you,” Cas said, breaking through his thoughts again.
“You want it to be?”
Castiel tossed him a look of displeasure and Gabriel threw his hands up in defense. Shoving the vest back inside the closet, he searched for a moment and finally pulled out a short sleeve, dark navy button down and black slacks. Gabriel whistled in approval and reached for the items.
I despise.”
He glanced up again and watched as a woman took the stool beside the brunet. This time when the man tilted his head, Dean was finally able to see his face. The bluest eyes he had ever imagined were staring at the lady, turning her down more kindly than he had with Romantic Interest Number One. Her confident shoulders had slightly sagged but Dean watched as they parted on better terms. Knowing it was now or never, Dean took another swig of his beer. His move was disrupted by a sudden, heavy hand on his shoulder. Startled out of his comfort, he looked up to see the face he despised more than anything. The leery smile and perverted gaze sent a chill down his spine.
, Dean. I have always chosen you.”
Cas’ smile became fond as he looked down but Dean couldn’t leave it like that. He couldn’t let his words have a different impact from what he intended.
“That would be the one,” Dean said with a chuckle.
“You…,” Dean started, stumbling back a step. “You gave up your grace? Why?”
Dean swallowed hard and pressed on the gas, allowing Cas to hold his hand the entire way. When they were back in the bunker, parked downstairs, they turned towards each other in the silence. A quiet beeping made Dean glance at his watch before he looked back up and grinned.
Dean swallowed and nodded along with the words. “I’m sure you’ll find the right fit, Bobby. Heard rumors that maybe Arthur Ketch will take the spot from Firehouse Eleven.”
Dean felt the intensity from Cas’ gaze and turned towards him again. They sat together for a beat in silence, the stillness of the night peaceful, allowing Dean’s nerves to settle so he could finish saying what he started.
The water was scorching hot as it fell against his skin, just the way Dean liked it. The heat took away the smoke that covered him, removing a bit of his tiredness with it. Once he was showered fresh, he pulled on his jeans and black tee, sliding a dark green flannel on top and made his way towards the common area. Just as he turned the corner to the main doors leading out of the firehouse, an arm wrapped around his shoulders, pulling him backwards by an inch. He looked up and smiled at his younger brother’s grin, shaking his head as they followed the rest of the men outside.
“I love you, too,” he finally said.
“Seriously?” Olivia deadpanned. “Dad, you’re supposed to wear a shirt that’ll make someone wanna hook up with you, not think you’re some boring old librarian.”
Dean took a deep breath as he sat inside the Impala. The sound of music made its way to his ears, muted by the heavy door of the front entrance. The bar was nestled at the other end of town, known for welcoming people of every sexual orientation. He’d driven past it once on his way home a couple years back, the name of the bar piquing enough interest that he’d spent the rest of his night scanning Yelp reviews. When he finally made it to the actual web page, the photos that had greeted him had sent a flush all the way down his spine. Littered across the screen were images of different couples, straight, gay and lesbian, all across the spectrum. For so long he had wanted to scratch a certain itch, to let himself explore something different. How would it feel to have strong hands and stubble brushing across his skin instead of the soft curves he always felt with women?
Dean caught another wink from the waitress before she walked away. He rolled his eyes and rose to his feet. “Gonna use the restroom. Be right back.”
“Come on, let’s leave him alone,” Garth interrupted, smiling kindly when Dean gave him a grateful nod.
“Thank you,” he said and climbed behind the wheel.
“It’s incredibly loud,” Cas replied, lifting his hand to circle above their heads. “I love my brother but how is this even considered music?”
Seeing Sam and Eileen embrace again after she had vanished with the rest of humanity had been a beautiful moment. Their grip on one another had been tight, whispering words that only lovers shared in the space between them.  Seeing Sam happy, his smile real and true, had made Dean walk over and close the distance. Eileen had steered her grin in his direction and he could see her beauty, humor, grace and intelligence all at once. Dean had opened his arms and she had fell against him willingly. He had welcomed her to the family and when they had pulled away, the tears in Sam’s eyes were falling. When they had returned to the bunker the next night, their makeshift family had been waiting. Charlie and Stevie, Bobby, Jody, and Donna were standing with their arms held open. Bobby’s words from years before had entered Dean’s mind as he welcomed all the hugs.
“Are you sure? You know me, Cas. I’m not perfect. Are you
did, that I was the most selfless, loving human you knew?” he said to the emptiness around him. “How could you tell me you loved me and then leave me?”
Rolling his eyes, Dean raised his gym bag over his shoulder and stepped forward. “Insult me all you want, old man. Leave my Baby out of it.”
“What happens now?” Dean asked when they pulled back to catch their breaths.
“Nah, she was just a one hit wonder,” he replied, ignoring the way Sam rolled his eyes at the words. “Too tired tonight to go bar hopping anyway. Think I’ll just head home.”
“This not really your scene?” Dean asked.
“Don’t get me wrong. Sam mourned you, too, but with me, it was different. It’s always been different,” Dean said, glancing over and seeing the emotions playing out in Cas’ gaze. “When I was younger, a small part of me thought that maybe one day, I’d settle down. Once Yellow Eyes was dead, maybe I could carve some sort of normal in my life. But it didn’t happen with Cassie and things never really happened with Jo. With Lisa? You know how that all worked out.” He sighed quietly but didn’t look away. “Then things just kept going from bad to worse. Sam’s soul, the Leviathans, Bobby dying, Purgatory, the gates, Kevin, Gadreel, the Mark; Charlie, me becoming a demon, the Darkness.
“It’s my birthday,” Cas said with another sigh. “My brother Gabriel dragged me out here to celebrate. This is his establishment.”
“Yeah, I’m getting that,” Dean spoke softly and swallowed the thickness in his throat. “Every time you died, it hollowed me out. Felt like a wound that couldn’t heal.”
Catching his breath in relief, he edged towards the bedroom door before stopping and turning back around a final moment. A part of him wanted to stay just once, to take a leap and see what happens. All those similar times he had woken in a stranger’s bed, he had always been the one to sneak away. As much as he wanted to curl against the other body, to let himself have a moment of happiness, he could never bring himself to do it. She was nothing more than a fun time and a way to escape. He hated how that made him sound, using people for a single night to draw away the loneliness but there had been no false promises or pretenses from ether her or him. Both had known where the night would lead and how the morning would eventually end. Deep down, Dean ached to find the love he had always wanted. After the life he had led, he longed to find someone he could call his own, to let himself be loved and love that person in return. But fantasies hardly came true and Dean’s reality was vastly different. Enough verbal beatdowns from his Father ensured he believed a truth that had long ago been hammered into him. He didn’t deserve to find the love he so desperately wanted. All he was good for was warming someone’s bed for a few minutes. Then they would toss him aside when morning came because that’s all Dean Winchester was to them. A way to pass the time, never good enough for commitment. As much as his younger brother Sam had tried to make him see different, to undo years of damage, his Father’s words had forever scarred him.
Castiel’s mouth hung open at the words, snapping out of his bewilderment when he heard Gabriel chuckle beside him.
Cas’ smile widened in understanding. A sudden thought made Dean loosen his grip around Cas’ neck, hands falling between them, fingers twining again.
Dean couldn’t help the sudden flush that filled his face. “You trying to get me into bed?”
“Happy new year, Cas.”
When the need for air became too intense, Dean tore his mouth away. Cas chased his lips, sneaking another kiss before his face buried against Dean’s neck. They closed their eyes and Dean groaned when he felt the bite against his collar. Cas slid his lips up to Dean’s jaw, stealing one more kiss and trailing back down to bite again. Dean’s body shook from the sting, one hand moving through Cas’s hair, the other sliding down his back to feel the tightness of muscles where his wings had once been.
Dean stood in the doorway of his room, peering inside. For the entirety of his youth and early years as an adult, all he had ever known were motel rooms and the Impala. When he and Sam had discovered the bunker, Dean could barely contain his giddiness. He finally had his own bedroom, one where he didn’t have to deal with Sam’s snoring and other noises; one where he could disappear to when things were tough. Having his own room had also proved useful each and every time Cas had died. Unable to deal with Sam’s sympathetic eyes or his endless need to talk things out, Dean would go to his room and let the heartache he was feeling crawl out. When the Mark was on his arm, he used his bedroom as another form of escape, a way to rein in all the anger that was constantly there, just lingering under the surface.
Their banter could have continued like it normally did but instead, Sam tapped Dean’s forehead with his own, high with brotherly affection.
“Yes, I know it is and I loved the sweater you gave me and the beautiful chocolate cake,” Castiel replied, smiling warmly at his daughter.
Dean flushed again and looked to the side, the move allowing Cas to lower himself down and leave another mark on his neck. It would bruise over, Dean was sure, but deep down he craved it. The idea of being marked, of belonging to someone else made his heartbeat turn rapid. The Mark of Cain and his connection to Amara had been dark. This was the light.
“Or something,” she said with a wink and made her way towards the other bartender.
“For an Angel with little experience, you know what you’re doing,” Dean said, arms tightening around the body above him.
Freedom. It was the strangest feeling. As Dean left his room and made his way down the hall, his mind went over the past few days on a never-ending loop. No longer were their strings being pulled by Chuck. No longer were their lives out of their hands. They were free.
“I’m not good at this,” he started, smiling at the head tilt he had already grown to love.
bed. Safe and warm in their bedroom, sheets tangled around their bodies where all they could feel was each other and nothing else. Their first time together deserved more than a fumbling in the dark. He wanted to take his time and map out every curve of Cas’ body, to feel Cas against him, inside him. When years ago, the thought of being with another man would have made Dean run, with Cas, everything was different. None of those misgivings mattered, not after everything they had been through and all the times they had died and come back. This was their chance at the truest form of happiness, a chance to submit themselves to a connection that not even the Heavenly Order or Lucifer could shatter.
. But as he turned another corner and heard the faint voices in the distance, a heaviness weighed on his heart, one that had been there for days. After defeating Chuck and bidding Jack farewell, their first stop had been the bunker. It had been their first real home in so many years and it felt right going back. They had glanced around themselves and shared a drink, unable to fully comprehend what their newfound freedom really meant. One drink and a laugh later, they were back in the Impala, driving towards their first destination.
“I think it may be a late one tonight,” Cas spoke in the phone. “No, I’m busy at work. Don’t think I’ll be home until late. Don't wait up.”
“Cas is fine or Castiel when I’m so deep inside you that you lose all ability to think,” Cas said, the words making Dean laugh in surprise, his body growing hot. “I liked Sweetheart as well.”
“Hey! Sam hasn’t been over for a while, either!”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said, his voice holding a tenderness Dean had never felt in his twenty-eight years of existence.
His heart ached when he thought back to that memory. He had been so surprised to hear those words, not fully understanding their meaning. Instead of reaching out for his Angel or voicing his own speech, he had simply stood frozen in his spot, watching his best friend with nothing but a mixture of shock and agony. When he had finally managed to speak, the words had been
He took a moment in hesitation, wondering if his refusal was worth the incoming argument his brother would give or the waterworks his daughter had perfected to get her way. Finally giving in, he shut his laptop and rose to his feet. Olivia screeched in excitement, grabbing his hand, and dragging him up the stairs to his bedroom. She jumped on the bed, pointing towards his closet and Castiel resigned himself to his fate. With Gabriel leaning against the dresser and both watching him expectantly, he reached between his clothes and withdrew a grey sweater vest.
“We go home,” Cas said without pause. “I very much enjoy kissing you. I would like to continue kissing you if you are in agreement.”
Cas gave another nod and it was enough for Dean to reach forward. Curling his fingers around Cas’ arm, he pulled the Angel closer as their eyes locked in the silence. A few beats passed, the air around them charged, until Dean gave a final squeeze and stepped into the hall. He made his way towards the garage, knowing that Cas would follow. The thought made the fluttering in Dean’s stomach expand. Even when they had argued, even when hurt and betrayal had kept them at a distance, they had always been drawn back together again. The bond between them was one for the ages, a connection that even Demons and Angels had questioned but never fully comprehended.
“Alastair,” Dean greeted, positioning his body slightly backwards.
They shared another look before Sam gave Cas a pat on his shoulder and walked out. When Dean turned his attention back to Cas, the Angel’s gaze was already on him, waiting and watching in patience.
As years went by, John would always throw a comment here and there. On good days, he would point out every beautiful woman that crossed their path. On bad days, he would go on drunken rages, cursing the world and his life, filling Dean’s ears with every homophobic slur he could find. If Dean had answered too slowly or not answered the way he had wanted, John would raise his hand again. Dean had eventually learned to perfect a mask of indifference. Agreeing with Dad and keeping him happy was easier than the alternative. When Sam had been old enough to start answering back, towering above both Dean and their Dad at sixteen, Dean had always played the peacekeeper between them. All he had wanted was for their family to get along, to let Sam be a kid and grow up without that fearful pit inside his stomach. He tried his hardest to be a good son, to do as his Dad had wanted.
Dean felt an ease settle inside him. The pang of jealousy had been irrational but somehow, Cas had been able to see through him. Somehow, Cas had known how to ease his wandering thoughts.
The words were innocent but Dean couldn’t stop the flush that filled his cheeks and neck again. “Yeah, you know? If you want.”
With a final glance backwards, he left the bedroom and walked out of the apartment. The moment he stepped onto the sidewalk outside, his façade was back in place. Offering a charming smile to an elderly couple walking past him, he ducked across the street and made his way towards the second most precious thing in his life outside of Sammy. Climbing behind the wheel of his ‘Baby’, he took a moment to run his hands across the smoothness. So little in his life had ever brought him true elation but his 1967 Chevy Impala had always been a second home to him. Sitting behind her wheel, he could silence the voices in his head telling him he wasn’t enough, telling him there would never be someone willing to love him. Sitting behind her wheel, he could finally breathe again.
“Are you sure?” Dean asked, his words slow and hesitant. “Cas, are you
Dean chuckled as he moved backwards. “No chick flick moments, Sammy.”
with me all the time but I assure you, that’s not how it is.”
“Yes,” Cas said, head tilting in confusion as if his answer should be obvious.
“You told me I was the most caring man on Earth.”
Blinking himself awake, Dean let his eyes take in his surroundings until they landed on the large painting pinned to the wall up ahead. The image of a laughing pig, adorned with devilish horns and a red smear of blood dripping from its teeth was enough to snap him fully awake. He took a breath and suddenly felt the weight in bed beside him. Slowly turning to the left, his gaze was met with a wave of messy blond hair. Memories of purple nurples flashed through his mind and he groaned from realization, running a hand across his face. The woman beside him continued sleeping peacefully, completely unaware of Dean’s presence. Was her name Mona? Tina? Rita? His head hurt trying to think of all the different names she could have been. When he glanced back towards her again, he let his eyes trail across her smooth skin, barely covered by the thin sheet. As fun as last night had been, Dean felt empty looking at her now, same as he always did.
Dean looked away, feeling his face flush but Cas gripped his chin and pulled him back.
“He knows, Cas,” Dean said, shaking his head. “According to the smartass, he’s always known. Back when Lucifer first got raised, I think that little speech of yours in Bobby’s hospital room made him start seeing things a little different.”
Laughing mildly, Dean looked up as Cas reached his doorway in the present. They stood a few feet apart, the silence comfortable, eyes roaming as they took each other in. Long ago, in the dark corners of his own mind, Dean had wondered how it would feel to pass through that final barrier and pull Cas against him. While such thoughts had years ago scared him, they no longer held the same weight as they once did. Cas was alive and back again. Dean understood the chance he’d been given and damned if he were going to let that chance go to waste.
“Got a promotion at work. Drove by this place a bunch of times. Figured tonight I’d see what all the fuss is about.”
“I admit, I’m not a diner enthusiast,” Cas said and quickly sat up to correct himself. “That didn’t come out right. I have nothing against these establishments.”
He could hear Cas calling his name another few times but ignored it as he ran. When he was back behind Baby’s wheel, tearing away from the curb, he hated the tears that were beginning to fill his eyes. It wasn’t until he was parked in his driveway, hands tight on the wheel when he let his frustration out. Thumping his head down, he closed his eyes and let John’s words fill his ears in the darkness of the night. That’s all Dean was. Just a way to pass time.
The words were enough to stop Dean in his tracks, a few feet away from the booth. An anger began to boil inside him, his hands folding over into fists. Of course Cas was married or had another partner. How could anyone like him be single? Dean felt like he deserved the grand prize for World's Biggest Idiot, falling for the first smile and sweet words he'd been given that night. Cas had turned everyone else down, waiting for the one person who was worth his time, worth cheating on whoever his partner was, waiting for him back at home. That’s all Dean was after all. A way to pass the time. A way for people to meet their needs before tossing him aside. His Dad’s words had never rung more true as he took a step back.
“Are you alright?” that gravelly voice asked and Dean swallowed hard to stop the groan that threatened to leave his lips.
Cas was smart enough to understand his meaning and reached under the table to take Dean’s hand in his own. The touch settled the nerves threatening to rise and Dean released a grateful sigh in reply.
“As much as your love life is a scintillating conversation I’m sure we’ll never have, I wanted to talk to you about Victor,” Bobby cut him off. “You know already that he’s moving off to the other side of the country in a couple weeks. That means the Lieutenant spot on Truck is opening up.”
He shook his head at the words, grateful at his own insistence of raising her to be so open and inclusive. She was wise beyond her years, an endearing trait for which he couldn’t fully take the credit.
Cas gave a pleased smile as Dean looked down, once more realizing what he had said. “I’m not a health freak, Dean. I just meant I hardly have time for sustenance. Whatever you choose, I’ll be happy to eat it.”
When they were back on the road towards the bunker, miles of road separating them from home, Dean took a deep breath and let his heart settle. Sam was safe at home, the woman he loved in his arms. Bobby, Jody, Donna and Charlie were alive. Even his parents were at peace. He and Sam were free. A lifetime of pain and misery, anger, confusion, and choices that had left them with battle scars unable to heal. But now, that chapter had closed. Now, they were finally free.
“A second nightstand?” Cas suddenly asked, realization dawning upon his features.
*****
“You still don’t like my car, do you?”
“Dean, ever since that night in the barn when we first met, I found myself more suited for humanity than I did with Heaven,” Cas explained. “All the time I spent by your side and with Sam and Bobby and your Mother confirmed it. The last time I lost my Grace, I was a poor imitation of a human, fumbling around lost and confused. I do not intend to make the same mistakes.”
“Going on dates with other guys,” Dean said with a shake of his head. “I’ve never…I’ve never been…”
Blue Eyes let his eyes travel before meeting Dean’s gaze again. “Do you mean the old pervert throwing daggers at us?”
“So you know my name but you have me at a disadvantage,” Pamela started.
They turned towards the PIC walking towards them from the ambulance. Jess had a sweet smile as she slipped in beside Sam, holding onto his arm.
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” the nasally voice said as the older man slightly leaned in, the smell of alcohol heavy on his breath.
They leaned back for air only when the need grew too intense. Not wanting the distance to extend, Dean tucked his face into the hollow of Cas’ neck, breathing him in. He could feel the tension in Cas’s muscles as his hands trailed up and down, mapping Dean’s body with nervous movements.
“Well, I can help point out the ones that are potentials and the ones you should seriously avoid,” she said, the encouragement in her voice giving Dean a sense of a blooming friendship between them. “Look over there.”
The Angel snapped his head up and met Dean’s eyes, his gaze softening as he recognized the hunter. They stood on opposite sides, both frozen, afraid to take that first step. Another moment passed and Dean was finally moving. Gripping Cas tight across his shoulders, Dean released the breath he’d been holding when he felt a pair of arms go tight around his waist. Cas whispered his name and turned his head to the side to bury his face against Dean’s neck. Before, they would have embraced and pulled away, leaving so many words unspoken. But now, everything had changed. They held each other, bodies molded as one, neither willing to let any space between them. When he felt Cas breathe him in, Dean shuddered and did the same.
“Were you watching?” Cas asked, amusement in his voice.
“And why would my daughter need a babysitter tonight?” Castiel asked, looking between the two.
His words trailed off and he pushed away from the table, moving quietly to the opposite side. Burying his hands in his pockets, he fell against the wall, the light from outside reaching his feet.
“Well, I should have a discussion with Billy Stevens,” he muttered.
“No disrespect to Ketch but I got my eyes on someone else,” Bobby said before sighing. “Kid, I’m putting your name up for promotion.”
“Waiting for my date. Gotta go,” Dean replied when his eyes caught the empty stool a few feet away.
“Sam and I do this sometimes,” Dean said after a minute. “Whenever things got too difficult and we needed a moment just to ourselves, away from it all, we’d drive out here and stare up at the stars. Some nights, we could hardly see anything in the sky. Other nights, they were shining bright like right now.” He looked over and caught Cas watching him with a soft expression. “Feels good, doing this with you.”
“Like how blue their eyes are or how the loose strands of hair keep falling into their face, making you want to run your hands through it,” Dean said, swallowing against the sudden thickness in his voice.
“Do you not understand the meaning of no? Should I contact the Special Victims unit and see if your name is on their list?”
“Is this a date?” Cas asked, the tease in his voice making Dean laugh.
“Not interested,” the man replied, not even bothering to look up.
“House music’s not for everyone. Kinda more suited for a club than a bar,” Dean said, nodding in agreement. “What kind of music you into, then?”
“Or?” Dean prompted, hating the space between their bodies.
“Mother or Father’s side?” Cas asked, the smile not leaving his face.
The words shattered through Dean, forcing his mind back to that day, to Cas's confession before he snapped back to the present. As his heart thundered wildly, he understood the choice he had. He could avoid it all, avoid what his heart yearned for and give in to his fears, masking his emotions behind a wall of friendship and family. But the look in Cas’s eyes made Dean swallow and take a leap. He was tired of being afraid of the connection between them. He was tired of letting the pain win. Cas was standing in front of him,
“You know what!” she exclaimed, walking the few feet of distance and stopping beside him. “It’s your birthday, Dad!”
“Hook up with me?” Castiel exclaimed, turning around to stare his defiant daughter down. “You’re nine years old! How do you even know what that means?”
“Dean’s sex life,” Gordon said with a snort, the words making Jess crinkle her face in annoyance.
“From hunting?” he said with a shrug. “With Jack the big man on campus, I don’t know. It’s like a weight’s finally been lifted. I mean, monsters will still be out there but maybe we can take a step back, relax a little. I don’t think I could ever fully quit. Hunting’s a part of who I am, it’s in my blood, ingrained in me, you know? But maybe we can take a breath and not let it be so important.”
The pep talk was enough to calm himself down. Once his face and hands were dry, he left the restroom and made his way back. Cas had tilted his body in the other direction, unable to see Dean as he approached, phone pressed to his ear.
“Get off me!” he snapped, yanking his hand away. “Just get off me.”
Taking a deep breath to ready himself, he blinked his eyes into focus and looked forward. What he saw made him freeze, his jaw falling open in disbelief. Cas was standing several feet away, staring down at his hands, his brows furrowed together as always. A part of Dean wanted to draw the knife out, not trusting the vision before him. But the other part that yearned for it to be true let the knife fall back in his pocket as he took a small step forward.
“Pamela made it sound as if I have
“Sam’s got a lovely girlfriend,” Bobby reminded.
“Yes,” Cas said again, the word sounding like a prayer.
“You done gazing at your car, idjit?”
“What did I do to deserve all of that?” he asked, unable to hide his amusement. “Olivia?”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at the air quotes, a flutter of butterflies erupting inside when Cas gave him another smile.
“Or become human,” Cas said, his voice barely a whisper as he took in Dean’s shocked expression. “I chose humanity, Dean.”
“And perhaps when you are ready,” Cas added, his fingers reaching for Dean’s collar and pulling it down so his lips could leave a gentle bite at the exposed skin. “Perhaps when you are ready, we can do other things.”
“Gabriel!” he hissed, grabbing the clothing back. “Both of you, out of my room.”
“You good with that? Going for a drive?” Dean asked.
“You’ve heard…?” Dean started and shook his head. “Cas, that’s just sad. You need to be schooled in the art of actual music!”
“Douchebags,” she commented with a shake of her head. “They’re the kind that will use you for their own pleasure and then toss you aside.”
“I’m thinking Sugar Pie, Snowflake and Honeybun are out as well?” Cas asked and Dean simply shook his head in dismay. “Maybe I’ll call you Beautiful or Gorgeous.”
Dean laughed and leaned forward. “What do you want me to call you then?”
“I love you too,” he said, pulling the Angel’s face up to meet his eyes. “Let’s get out of here and go home. I’m getting too old for fooling around outside like this. You, me and our bed.”
“That was my fault. I kicked you out,” Dean cut in but Cas covered his mouth with gentle fingers.
Cas gave a wide grin and stole his own kiss. “What can I call you?”
Cas spread his hand over Dean’s heart before answering. “You are the embodiment of beauty, inside and out. What I said to you that day, I meant those words, Dean. I made this choice because it felt right.
Dean took a large swig of his beer and took another peek at the other man. When a stool opened up a few closer to him, Dean grabbed the opportunity and took the spot. He was only four stools away, the proximity enough that he could hear the conversation when one of the douchebags Pamela had pointed out leaned on his elbow beside the man.
“He gave me a choice,” Cas continued, unwrapping his arms from Dean’s waist, and allowing his hands to fall away. “To return to Heaven, fully restored.”
“Sixth sense or something?” Dean asked, accepting the beer she pushed towards him.
Dean chuckled again and played with the label on his beer. “I’m with you there. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had my share of one night stands but sometimes it’s good to say something more than ‘Hey, how’s it going’ before you fall into bed.”
“So Dean, you got any hot dates planned?” Gordon asked, tossing a glance backwards. “Same girl from the other night?”
“Cas,” Dean started, his cheeks tinting red.
“Why do you keep leaving me?”
“You showed me those awesome wings, told me you were an Angel and I hated you. I hated you for who you were, for everything you represented. I was angry, Cas. I was so angry back then. Hell, I always have been,” Dean spoke quietly, snorting to himself self-deprecatingly. “For a long time, I thought you were nothing more than a puppet, a hammer. But then it all changed. You helped me. You went against everything you stood for, against your superiors, against Heaven and helped me. We went from enemies to allies to friends in a span of weeks. I didn't want to trust you but I did.”
His voice echoed slightly in the open space as he reached out to touch the wall. It felt cool against his hand, his fingers dragging against the metal.
feel right. You always have. My love for you has always been there, never wavered. I just understand it now.”
Her eyes narrowed even more as she crossed her arms at her chest. “Dad, you can’t stay here all night. It’s your birthday!”
The smile Cas gave him turned sweet as the Angel leaned in to hold Dean’s face with both hands. “Perhaps it’s time I put away my Grace.”
“He said I mattered to him and that I mattered to you,” Cas replied, his voice gentle. “Seeing him in the Empty, seeing him as he is now, I can’t describe it. The Empty’s hold on me was broken. I was released.”
He hadn’t believed it then but he was finally beginning to believe it now.
,” he said, reaching a hand up to rub the back of his neck. “When Lucifer stabbed you, it killed me, Cas. It killed me like it's killing me now.”
“Well, we all live in the same house so if you feel hungry, just drop by the kitchen,” she said with a wink as they stopped at Sam’s car.
“Gabe’s little brother always drinks for free,” she said and gave a wink. “So do his
They stared at each other for another beat, completely lost in the moment. The door to the diner opened behind them, yanking them out of their trance. Exchanging smiles, they made their way inside and Dean couldn’t help but grin when he felt a faint press of fingers at the small of his back. They reached an empty booth and Dean slid inside, inwardly glad when Cas moved to sit directly beside him, personal space be damned. The waitress was younger than Dean, smiling brightly when she reached them.
