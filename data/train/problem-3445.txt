And it’s true. Everyone they lost through Chuck’s little game of wipe-the-board had come back. Dean had been on the phone constantly over the last week.
There will be two more chapters in this and I hope to get it done soon.
inside him that still made him
Only then does Cas allow himself to look at the wound. Dean’s left calf is dark red and swollen, even darker around the stab wound he must have suffered in the fight. Yellow liquid oozes from the enlarged flesh, and the stench of rotten meat hangs in the air. Cas heaves at the sight and the smell. Until now, he had hoped that they would find another option. With his limited medical knowledge even he can see that the leg cannot be saved. He steels himself, tries to ban all thoughts about the future from his mind, all the selfish wants and musings. There will be time for that later. Right now, they have to save Dean’s life.
“Shit, Cas, you can’t just walk in here in the middle of the night like this. I could have hurt you!”
, he thinks, Led Zeppelin. Dean groans and pats the bedside table with a murmured apology for the interruption.
Ellen starts to pull the sheet back. “I will need both of you to hold him.”
“I might not have encountered that memory yet, but I think I should know: Are we romantically involved?”
As promised.
Cas nods, slowly, and his head feels heavier with each motion. He saddles his horse in silence, rides out in the early hours of the morning while mist still wafts over the wheat fields.
“You should go to bed, Cas. Mind if I use your couch for a nap before I drive back?”
Tears drip steady down on the concrete, one drop between each helpless buzzing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fed up, by himself, the situation and the world in general, Dean snags the crumbling paper from under Cas’ nose, takes one look and puts it flat on the table.
“I didn’t know you openly acknowledged your preference for men.”
“One mocha frappucino with extra caramel sirup and one coffee, black.” Gabe places their usual order like he did a thousand times before. For a second, Cas dares to hope that his brother will respect his wish and let the matter rest.
As a matter of fact, he can’t wait to find out.
it’s the color of my eyes,” Cas says, pointing to the wet lace. It’s a weak attempt at flirting and Cas knows it, but it sparks something in Dean’s eyes as he steps closer to share the warm spray with Cas. Dean’s hand comes up to brush against Cas’ nipple, still hard from the cold and clearly visible under his wet shirt. Dean flicks against it. Cas gasps when the sharp sting spreads from his chest and heats up his skin more that the water ever could. He grabs Dean by the jaw and pulls him into another kiss. This time he sets the pace, teases Dean until he gets impatient, before he licks inside and swallows Dean’s moans.
“You are a monster. I am a hunter now. I stop monsters.” Jack’s voice is brittle but resolution drips from every word. He sounds a lot like Sam when he was eleven and not yet old enough to join John and Dean on hunts.
"Why am I on your lockscreen, Cas?“ he asks, and his own voice sounds all wrong, words pushing against the sudden lump in his throat, strangled by his rising pulse.
Cas is not there when Dean wakes up. He’s teaching the first year novices – the sacraments. He’s glad he’s done this so many times he knows the lecture by heart, and he’s glad the young boys don’t ask questions – when Charles’ red head appears in the door. He smiles, and then he’s gone again.
The moment lingers. Something profound expands in the air between them. Cas’ heart hammers in his chest. He wants to ask what Dean means by that, but he can’t even put his own emotions into words. His blood is roaring in his ears, his body trembling with want and uncertainty. Dean’s eyes are wide and dark and earnest, and Cas could easily get lost in them. That is, until Dean winks and breaks the spell.
Dean’s done first and leans against the sink while Cas finishes up. When he straightens, Dean surges. A warm hand on Cas’ neck, and Dean is there, close, but stops right before their lips meet.
“Tell me, Dean, in all the years you and your annoying brother studied the supernatural, did you find out what happens to an angel’s soul when they die?”
Dean’s eyes widen before he slips them shut. His body stills into one long line of tension. His hand stops, white-knuckled. Cas can see his climax ripple through Dean like a long wave. He decides then and there that it’s his new favorite sight on earth. Dean comes with an almost inaudible sigh, in long pulses that fall on Cas’ skin like hot wax, only there for a second before the water takes it away.
The small bubble of panic at his own recklessness, the unprecedented
“I’m sure we have lore on that, but I can’t guarantee it’s accurate. And there’s another point you have to consider.”
. But even when he imagined it, it was hard to find the words. An
If Cas gave himself the chance to think about it, he would see the same compatibility between him and Dean. He would realize that he gave up way too early and for the entirely wrong reasons, but, being who he is, he shoves that thought down whenever it surfaces, mostly in the few silent hours he spends at home with not distraction to stop him.
Feeling bold, Cas drops his voice a little lower, just to see how Dean reacts.
They sat like that for minutes, before Cas spoke up again.
Cas swallows against the sudden lump in his throat.
They smile at each other for what feels entirely to long for a sane person to smile at another, but Cas doesn’t care. His mind, finally catching up with the fact that there might still be a chance to right these wrongs, falls into the gutter fast and hard.
Damn if Cas knows.
Cas shoots Dean a look which might lack in heat due to his clattering teeth and the full-body shivers, and Dean just smirks, leans against the stall and starts laughing.
Sam feels like a schoolteacher who tries to hammer a very basic concept into the heads of his pupils. “You should consider that Cas likes being touched by you so much – because it’s you that does the touching.”
Castiel seems to ponder that, and you had to know that face like Dean does to see the wheels turning behind his steady gaze. In the end, Castiel tilts his head in acknowledgement. “Was.” And then, “I’m sorry.”
Cas alright, indignation, ire and condescension all rolled into one statement.
Before he went to a party.
Dean barks a laugh, and Cas takes the chance to admire the curve of his neck. He’s suddenly very aware of how close they sit, Dean’s thigh is pressed against his own and Cas still remembers the weight of it, the warmth of it just hours ago.
“Father Robert,” John addressed him. “It’s good to see you again. This is my son, Dean.”
Cas doesn’t notice he moved until Dean’s legs meet the bed and he tumbles backwards onto the mattress with a surprised chuckle. All his limbs are splayed from the fall. Cas follows the curve of his legs up to the cut of his hips and the visible outline of his cock, and wonders if the panties will get too tight at one point, – he makes a mental note to find out. Dean’s waist broadens into his strong chest and stronger shoulders, thick muscled arms. Cas wants to map out all of it with his hands and his mouth.
Because they have plans.
He sits down on the bed, knees weak all of a sudden. He is so completely out of his depth here, he feels like he’s drowning. What is he supposed to do? Go down there and have breakfast with Dean as if nothing happened? He can’t do that. He can’t. Can he?
Dean needs a moment to catch up. He’s very aware that he’s still straddling Cas’ thighs and how wide he has to spread his own around the sheer
“You don’t wanna do that, son.”
“A key?” he asked after a while. “I don’t know what you find funny about that.”
“Sam?” It’s nothing more than a croak, his throat is so raw.
Cas walks up the small path that lead from the tree-line over to the porch. They went shopping the other day – not a great idea to walk around the tiny village clad like a medieval warrior – and contrary to his former self, this Cas sticks to the tight fits. Black jeans, grey t-shirt, solid boots. He looks like a manifestation of Dean’s wildest daydreams, even more so with the sunlight playing in his windswept hair and the small smile curving his lips.
“Nice to meet you. I have to apologize for him, Cas. He could never keep a secret, but I assure you, even I couldn’t get any details out of him, so it’s gotta be something special he sees in you.”
Cas shook his head. “I don’t know much about these things and I know what the law says, but I am convinced that the reason why people do something is important. At least for me, it makes a difference if someone steals because he’s greedy or if he steals because he’s hungry.”
Cas doesn’t even try to conceal his exasperated sighs anymore.
“No bother at all, come in,” a deep voice greets Cas. Cas stops in his tracks, swallows and tries not to choke on his own tongue. Mrs Smith rounds him and curls her hand around the waist of –
So in his free time, Dean fled reality and fought wars at the side of Agamemnon, cried over Iphigenia’s sacrifice and he suffered with Prometheus on his rock. When Cas found him in the library one afternoon with tears drying on his cheeks, he smiled softly and told him crying was good for the soul, before he touched his shoulder lightly and went to find a book for himself.
Dean had never thought about it like that. “Do the other clerics see it that way, too?,” he asked tentatively.
They pay and leave in silence.
The words die in his mouth when he takes him in for the first time. His face – he is so gorgeous, it’s unfair. Deep green eyes, freckled skin, strong jaw, full lips. He looks like an indecent fantasy incarnate, and Cas’ tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth.
Glimpses of his humiliation come back to him, each one sharp, like a knife to his skull. He groans. Another bang rings from the kitchen.
, “we are not involved.” The last word tastes sour on his tongue.
If he can have this with this version of Dean, a selfish part of Cas can’t help but wonder, it might be best if Dean stayed here for a while. They would have an illicit affair, just like Sunny and Conrad. Cas could have what he always wanted. He gasps when Dean’s tongue darts out and curls around his own. It’s wrong, yes. But Cas feels very, very selfish right this moment.
“You look like a wet cat,” he rasps between chuckles.
“No need to wait outside, Mr Novak,” he drawls in his warm southern accent. Cas steps inside with a quiet thanks and waits while Benny prepares his extra strong Java. There’s nothing like the fragrance of fresh coffee to start a morning right, and for the first time in a long while, Cas allows himself to find a little joy in it. The bell is chiming as another customer enters and stands next to Cas at the counter. Benny takes his order. “Name?” he asks while he pours the dark liquid in Cas’ cup and hands it over the counter.
Dean’s heart does some weird things in his chest while Lucifer talks. Why would this Castiel save him? He’s got no reason to trust Dean and the other soldiers after what they did to him. Oh yes, Dean had found out about Cole, and he can’t say he’s surprised that he’s a scumbag over here, too. He wishes he could kill him with his hands, but Ash told him a demon had already taken care of that.
Thinking back to their time at the Sunset Plaza, Dean sometimes can’t believe that this Cas is the same person that felt awkward over blowjobs. No that Dean minded at the time, in fact he loved the way Cas melted for him and allowed himself to let go just once. A lot has changed since then, though. Cas turned out to be the most responsive, eager partner Dean ever had, always shy at first to try something new, but once he made up his mind, he was a force to reckon with. Turns out, as much as Cas needs to be in control at work, he loves giving that control over to Dean once they’re home.
Zachariah’s voice rose into an agitated, high pitch and deep red blotches crept up his feisty neck. Dean cowered under the lecture. He had forgotten that the other tutors didn’t enjoy questions and discussion as much as Cas.
Snot is clogging up his nose, makes it hard to breathe, so he lets his mouth hang open, dry air in, wreaking breath out, labored, like he‘s lifting something heavy.
Dean looks down on his hands, spread out on the table as if he wants to feel something solid under them. “It’s not that simple, Sam. I can’t go to him and ask about stuff like that. That’s not how we work.”
It will take time to get used to it, for all of them. Dean can’t help but be grateful it happened, even if a part of him is still weary – after all, who knows if all of Cas’ soul was saved? Who knows how different he is because of the part of him that’s still there and not-quite-Cas?
Lucifer throws back his head and empties the glass, as if it’s cheap tequila, while Castiel watches him, horrified. Like this is going a step to far, even for the fallen archangel.
His reading improved rapidly, and he was able to follow the basic Greek lectures now. As much as Cas admired scholars like Anselm and Augustinus for their clear minds and rational thinking, Dean liked the Greeks more. Father Robert gave Cas a lot of freedom concerning his subject matter, so they practiced Greek not only with the ancient philosopher but also on the tragedies.
Cas freezes when he hears the company’s name. They still haven’t talked much about their lives, apart from a few anecdotes from work and stories about their families, nothing that led to questions about a possible future. Now Cas’ blood runs cold and hot and cold again. Dean’s brother Sam apparently found a new job, and Cas would be happy for Dean who seems to be genuinely happy about the news.
He lets his eyes dart away, but Dean’s not having it. He guides Cas’ chin back with his index finger, until Cas’ can’t look away anymore.
, and Dean lets his eyes linger on him while Cas comes closer. Cas doesn’t break eye contact and the smile stays firmly on his lips.
Has to.
“We can define God as the perfect being, do you agree?”
Dean’s never been good at math, least of all when his dick is sitting up like a meerkat sensing danger, but maybe, just maybe two idiots can measure each other out into something really awesome.
He has no such luck.
Dean smiles at that and winces when a deep gash on his bottom lip opens from the motion. His lids part slowly, and he blinks a few times to open his eyes fully. His hands are bound, so he can’t rub the grime from them. A quick inspection confirms his suspicion. They took his gun, his angel blade, his knife. It’s ridiculous who naked he feels without them, seeing that they wouldn’t do him much good anyways.
Unbeta'd as usual.
Counting to ten.
Cas does indeed find that bit of information intriguing, but he’s not about to share that with his sergeant. “What I’m interested in are his crimes against the crown, Bradbury,” he answers a little bit harsher than intended.
Lucifer has his back to Dean and a blade to Castiel’s throat, Dean’s blade. Castiel strains against the shackles, tries to get away from Lucifer, but he’s got only so much room to maneuver. Still fighting, even when he’s completely outgunned. Some things never change.
Dean shrugs and tugs his hands back to curl them around his mug.
His memories of the years with his mom were clouded. She had died in fire when he was ten years old. John Winchester had always been a man of strong opinions and rigid rules, but the events that led to and the death of his wife had hardened him into an even harsher version of himself.
The gears are turning in Cas’ brain, Dean can hear them, even over the screaming in his own.
The blood that just managed to find its way up to his brain again returns south one more time. His mouth waters at the sight. At least the saliva chases away the cottony taste. Small mercies. He swallows hard.
Cas knows what Gabe is referring to and he doesn’t need the reminder. The last time he felt like this was after Balthazar had left him. And how silly is that? To compare a break-up after three years to the fact that a one night stand didn’t end in a love confession? Cas hides his face in his hands and chuckles without humor.
Garth beckons him to a slightly bigger building with cracks concrete and busted windows. “Come in,” he says, and enters through the metal door.
Cas answers through clenched teeth. “You talked to your brother. That morning. On the phone. And you didn’t mention me.”
-expression. Cas can relate. He’s got an older brother, too.
“I don’t know. It feels like a trick. I can’t put my finger on it.” His temples pounded with the concentration, but he couldn’t tell Cas what bugged him about the argument.
Cas looking down at him, brow furrowed.
He presses a soft kiss on Dean’s freckled shoulder and concentrates on the most important part of Dean’s sentence.
When he gets back to the office, he sinks into his chair, ready to let the world swallow him whole. His laptop chooses his moment of existential despair to ping with a new mail. The invitation to the annual Milton and Partner Christmas Party. Everyone is encouraged to bring family and partners. He laughs without the least bit of humor. Cas can count the people he spoke to outside of work in the last weeks on one hand. He wonders if he should ask Benny to come, since most days the friendly barista is the closest thing he has to a friend. He closes the mail with a sense of finality. Spending an evening between happy people celebrating with friends and family sounds like his worst nightmare. He will tell his brother he won’t go this year. Gabe will understand.
Eventually, he‘ll pick himself up, pick up the phone, pick up the burden. And he‘ll find a shred of hope in the rubble, and he‘ll be able to cling to it and get back to Cas. It‘s what he does.
Dean slips in and out of consciousness. Whenever he wakes up, he hesitates to look at Cas, whose face is ashen and whose limbs have lost all tension. Dean concentrates on the slow rise and fall of Cas’ chest. He wonders if Cas will still be breathing the next time Dean opens his eyes.
“Do you remember the summer, when you booked that holiday for me?” Cas starts, and Gabe nods.
“Good, that’s good,” Dean murmurs absentmindedly. He looks his brother in the eyes. “You said you located Cas…” He lets the sentence hang there, but Sam knows what he means. His eyes are wide and he doesn’t blink once when he answers.
“This is a bit weird for me, too. I mean, I have hook-ups now and then, but usually it’s dark by then, and I’m a little tipsy and it’s all frantic and quick,” Dean rambles. “You … this is not what I’m used to.”
“And later … I wanted nothing more than to watch you while I listened to you jerking off. I tried to picture it. Did you stand? Did you sit down? Did you bite your pretty pink lips to keep from making a sound?”
“They took my leg,” Dean mumbles. His hand is resting on his leg, fingers feeling out the new edge, the part where his thigh would have met his knee and now meets only nothingness.
When the tremors slowly subside, he steps back, unsure if he should apologize. He meets Castiel’s gaze through the blur of tears. Something moves in the blue depths, and for a second, Dean is fooled, lets himself be fooled, and he reaches out and cradles his palm around the angles of a too-familiar jaw. The stranger with the face of Castiel inhales sharply at the touch, his eyes go wide, and Dean lets his hand drop.
Cas collapses on top of him, uncaring about the mess between them and nuzzles into Dean’s neck with a contented sigh. Dean wraps his arms around him, lips against Cas’ soft, sweat-slick hair, rubs a hand along his back while they catch their breath. Their hearts slow down until they beat in one steady rhythm against each other.
Pure heat is settling in his gut, and he opens his stance and puts a hand on the tiles to keep himself upright. Did Dean stand in the same spot? Did he … did he know that Cas would listen? The thought sends sparks of lightning down his spine, and Cas allows the next sound that builds in his chest to tumble out, a choked-off groan. It’s exciting to imagine Dean on the bed, eyes closed as he listens to Cas masturbating right next door. It’s something else Cas never thought he would be into, but god, he is, and his cock is weeping out another spurt of precome when he thinks about Dean, lazily touching his spent dick and enjoying the sounds of Cas coming undone.
That. That’s not what he expected. Cas kissed Dean to get a reaction, to shock him back into his own mind. He expected to be shoved back, shouted at. He expected a fist to his jaw – which he would have deserved for taking such liberties.
They avoid the topic of the future. Cas doesn’t even know where Dean lives, and asking for would give away too much. This still so fresh, and to learn that it will be over by the end of the week, because they live on opposite ends of the country – it’s a burden Cas wants to shoulder when he has to and not one second earlier. As a lawyer, he likes to know all the facts up to the last detail to be as prepared as possible. With Dean, though, he wants to enjoy the in-between as long as he can, and live in the moment for once in his life.
“Now’s not really the time for that conversation, is it?” He shakes his head as if he wants to clear his thoughts. “How about you tell me your address and I’ll take you home. What you need right now is a toothbrush and a good night’s sleep.” He gazes out of the windshield, watches the snowflakes melt against the warm glass. The lights of the bar blur into watercolors before the wipers sharpen them again.
As promised, the next chapter. I'd love to hear how you like it.
“Hmmmnnn?” Dean tried to focus on the face, the voice, the hands. The hands most of all. Nobody had touched him for so long now. It felt nice despite the unbearable heat. He turned his body towards it and sighed.
At long last, his mind came back to the reason he came here. His father’s face and the lines of malcontent that had deepened to permanent furrows in the last month rose to the center of his thoughts. If John was right, Dean wouldn’t find any friends or solace here. He was tainted beyond redemption, the son of a sinner, destined for the same path.
“Clean and cool,” Cas smiled.
Dean laughs, a short gush of air, but he’s smiling with a fondness that tugs on Sam’s heart. “Yeah. Yeah, he is.” A deep inhale. “But you know, since he can’t go to heaven anymore, he needs – uhm – help with—“
“Father Robert told me.”
Bradbury nods three times in quick succession. Cas’ neck hurts from watching it.
The outstretched hand hovered between them before Cas let it sink back to his side. He looked heartbroken.
They sat like that for a long time, both of them lost in their own minds. As much as Dean enjoyed talking to Castiel and listening to his lectures, he liked those silent moments the most. With autumn approaching, the sun set earlier now. When the creeping shadows of the buildings reached the spot they had chosen for their meetings, Castiel got to his feet and held out a hand to help Dean up. Dean grabbed it with the distinct feeling that something had shifted between them.
Ellen ruled over the kitchen with absolute power, but she had a soft spot for Dean, so working for her didn't turned out half bad. Dean loved the warmth and the smells of the kitchen – it felt more like a home than the house he'd grown up in.
Dean makes a sound deep in his throat, as if he’s upset, as if he wants to say something but decides against it. They stand still, both grabbing the blanket, and Cas is choking on the words he wants to say, not just the big things like how much he missed Dean, but also the small things like how he can see so many mannerisms of Dean in Sam, how he can’t go past a vintage car without thinking of him. He wants to ask why Dean came to the party, and why he took Cas home even after everything he did. The words lodge in his throat like bricks. It’s painful to swallow them down, but easier than spitting them out.
“You have to say ‘boo’ in the exact same moment I see you or just before, Cas,” he says, and the crease between Cas’ brows deepens.
almost overwhelming.
Cas looks up and squints at Gabe, suddenly suspicious. “What are you planning?”
“What did we learn about the sophists and their use of rhetoric?” Twelve hands went up. Castiel chose one of the students, a slim boy with blond hair. “Yes, Jonathan?”
When Dean opens his eyes again, he sees Castiel crouched by the lifeless body a few feet away. With sure hands, he twists the blade out of the chest of the dead angel that tried to shoot Dean. When the warrior that isn’t Castiel comes back to him, holds out the blade for Dean to take it, something in him just … falls apart. He’s shaking, in shock most likely, the still working part of his brain points out,
“Can’t you radio your crew?”
He fell silent and watched Dean closely. “When you’re not learning, you can help me with the bookkeeping and give Ellen a hand in the kitchen. I will think of other chores. No go with Garth. He’ll show you the refectory and the dormitory and give you your garments. Questions?”
, Dean thought, and the knowledge settled like a heavy weight in his gut. Dean bit his bottom lip and moaned at the sight of them both, so close, a low pleading sound, begging Cas not to leave him alone in this.
“That’s –“ The man shakes his head. “That’s one of the weirdest compliments I’ve ever gotten.” He grins. “Thank you for telling me.”
The door opens around eleven pm and a slightly drunk Dean stumbles in.
“Morning, Cas.” Dean waves his hand to indicate the kitchen. “I hope you don’t mind?”
The broth was fat and full of flavor and so hot Dean burned his lips on the first sip. Just when he had just reached the bottom, the door flew open and a skinny boy with a mop of dark blond hair fell through it. He beamed at Dean as he came to a stumbling halt in front of him. “Nice to meet you, I’m Garth.”
“I want you to be content,” Cas says.
It finally happens one evening when they’re sitting in the library, tables strewn with beer bottles and books.
“Yes, thank you, ma-…”
“Are you an exhibitionist?” Cas asks back.
“Yes, I understand, brother Zachariah,” he mumbled, trying to look demure.
“What?” Dean asks.
"You are a menace," Cas grumbles. Sweat is beading on Cas’ chest and he’s panting through his open lips.
Now there’s no mistaking that Cas is, in fact, smiling. That asshole. Cas takes another step closer, until his chest almost bumps against Dean’s. Dean can feel the warmth from Cas body on his skin, and Cas’ breath on his face when Cas keeps talking like he’s having a normal conversation.
Ellen came once a day, too, to bring Dean hot chicken soup. When he could sit again, she gave him a few pieces of cherrywood and the small knife. Dean’s fingers were clumsy and weak, but after a few days he was able to carve the wood into small figures. He had seen a chess game on the table of one of the rich costumers his dad used to visit, and he remembered feeling pure awe at the intricate little statues. Since he had no idea how the game worked and what stones would be required, he asked Cas to look it up for him. Cas’ eyes widened with instant curiosity: he didn’t know the rules either and he positively beamed with excitement to learn something new.
His head is lifted with an index finger under his chin. Despite the panic that bubbles just under his skin while he waits for Cas’ answer, he has to smile at the sheer cheesiness of that move. Cas has definitely watched too many movies, but then again, Dean won’t complain when it leads to this.
Dean has to get up, he’s got to get away from being so close to Cas, but as he moves he bumps against Cas. Their noses brush. Dean freezes. He doesn’t dare to breathe.
The next summer, Dean doesn’t spend his holiday at the Sunset Plaza.
“Don’t madam me, son. I’m Ellen. Eat.”
Dean moans loud and low around Cas’ cock, then leans back and closes his hand around him instead of his lips. “Fuck, Cas, that’s – “
Dean rolls his shoulders to chase the stiffness away but the sudden stab in his neck tells him he probably made it worse. This business makes him feel old on the best of days.
“What’s wrong about being comfortable enough with each other that talking’s not necessary?” Dean raises an eyebrow at him.
And while he watched his friend, a sudden clarity fell over him and he finally, finally realized what was wrong about Cas’ reluctance to meet his eyes.
The shackles clank loudly through the vast room when Castiel struggles again, and a low growl echoes from the derelict walls. Dean doesn’t agree often with Lucifer, but it does have a certain ring to it. Poetic justice maybe. If their lives were a story, it would be fitting that he’ll die in this world with Castiel by his side.
While Dean began to think of Castiel as a friend more than a teacher, Castiel kept up his stiff demeanor. Dean didn’t mind as much since he behaved like that around everybody. He made it his mission to crack the demure façade, though.
Dean felt Zachariah’s attention on him.
“You should talk to him,” Ash muses, “I’m sure you can find out more about his motives.”
Cas laughs, loud and honest, like he hasn’t laughed in, well, months. “As a matter of fact, I have.”
“I am Castiel Novak, and I booked a single.”
“Was,” he grunts through clenched teeth.
“Need a little help there, Cas?”
Castiel spoke slowly and formed his words with care. Dean had never met anyone who seemed to cherish language so much. He nodded, and added a quiet “yes” because he wasn’t sure if Castiel could see the movement. Castiel finally lifted his head and fixated a point over Dean’s right shoulder.
That got Cas’ attention. He reached for his belt and Dean, aware of Cas’ discomfort, turned around while he undressed. A minute later, splashing indicated that Cas had joined him in the water.
“215,” Cas answers and Dean’s smile widens, lips thinning out and eyes crinkling up. It’s blinding.
Ellen smirked and her tone fell back into the usual grumpiness. “Well, not now. Bring the new ham to the meat cellar, will you?”
He smiles into the skin of Cas’ neck. “Not yet.”
“You talking about the time you stared into space for hours and looked like a lifeless husk all the time,” Gabe’s voice is hard, and Cas hears Dean’s low gasp. A moment later, a warm hand slides against his palm and squeezes.
Cas can only nod and Dean chuckles, supposedly at his dumb-struck expression. It makes Cas look up. The blush on Dean’s skin deepens while he watches and he reaches out again to lay his hand softly over Dean’s heart, just like Dean did a moment before. He can feel Dean’s heart beat steady and fast beneath his palm. He moves his palm up slowly under the trimmed edge of the bathrobe and pushes it over Dean’s shoulder until it falls onto the ground. The room is suddenly very quiet.
Dean doesn’t let go of Cas as he steps backwards into the wide open stall. Their faces are close enough that Cas can see the dusting of freckles on Dean’s nose, the glint in his eyes. Cas narrows his eyes at him. “How impolite of me. May I use your shower, Cas?” Dean asks, voice rough.
“I’m sorry, I …” Cas starts, but Dean stops him with a shake of his head.
“So, in conclusion, what you’re saying is that we’re both dumbasses,” he grouches but can’t help the small tug of a smile.
“You told me how to dress and to open the button on my shirt, because you thought I looked better that way.”
His forehead throbs in the rhythm of his heart.
Lucifer’s booming laughter brings his focus back to the here and now. “If only you knew how very wrong you are.” Lucifers strides over and crouches down in front of Dean, squashes his chin between his fingers and turns his head until Dean can’t not look at Cas. “Have a good look at him. I’ll bet he won’t make it to sundown. Did he tell you about his dreams, Dean? Did you notice that he seems to remember bits and pieces of his life on the other side?”
“Who?”, Dean mumbles, although he knows exactly who Castiel is talking about. He just needs to buy some time, clear his head, and then, well, then, he still won’t know how to answer that question.
The young man couldn’t be much older than Dean. Dark brown hair swept over his head in thick unruly waves. He was tall, not quite as tall as Dean, and lean under the black novice’s habit. Elegant hands with long fingers gestured as he pointed out an interesting word choice in the text they discussed. A straight nose gave his face a stern expression that was softened by a wide mouth with chapped pink lips. Dean couldn’t make out exactly what he was saying but kept staring at those lips as if they could reveal unknown truths all on their own.
“Wow, looks like you could really use it,” Justin-Dean laughs. Dean’s been brainwashed, obviously, but Cas’ heart hurts to see how happy he looks. The lines of worry, such a constant part of Dean’s face, are gone, smoothed out of Dean’s features like the crinkles out of a freshly pressed dress shirt.
Our Cas.
Lucifer taps his foot while he waits for the grace to trickle out, impatient, because it’s taking longer and longer. Dean decides to play along, if only to prevent Lucifer from hurting Cas again to reprimand him for his failing body.
Right, they got themselves captured yesterday by a bunch of demons. Who, as it turns out, work for an old acquaintance of Dean’s.
When Cas finally speaks, it‘s almost inaudible. "I think you know why,“ he says, little more than a whisper, all tension sliding off his shoulders in silent defeat.
Confusion gives way to understanding, but the smile is cool and professional. “Yeah, I’m surprised anyone remembers that. Putting your brother through college isn’t cheap – we do what we gotta do, huh?”
“Bullshit,” Gabe says again, lower. “Last time I saw you like this … wait. Did you meet someone?”
He awakes from sound of metal banging.
"Sadly, I do," Cas shoots back, but the effect is ruined by the small moan that slips in at the end of the declaration.
“What are you doing?” Dean sound breathless, his chest is heaving. His eyes flicker between Cas’ own, but he doesn’t step back.
Suddenly he felt sure that everyone around him knew what he was doing. A hundred eyes, judging and secretly coveting at once.
“I’ll leave you two alone,” Sam murmurs and leaves. The silence in the room is choking.
A knock on the door echoes through the small room.
Cas sits up suddenly, and Dean grips his shoulder to keep from falling over. Which means…he’s now sitting in Cas’ lap, with his thighs around– and Cas’ hands are on Dean’s hips, and he’s close enough that Dean can feel his breath on his own lips.
get over it.
Cas shakes his head, so Dean has to move his hand with it. “You couldn’t hurt me, Dean.”
Cas concentrated on logic even more than usual, and although Dean’s brain hurt from the twists and turns of the arguments, he enjoyed challenging his mind. At the moment, they learned about the arguments for God’s existence, and Cas’ eyes shone with enthusiasm when they came to the ontological argument. He stood in front of the class and rubbed his hands together is if he was about to take the first bite out of a tasty pie.
Cas keeps watching the couples by the pool. Dean is not exactly wrong. He can’t even remember the last time he had sex. Or a date. He loves his work, and tends to get lost in it.
. Dean chews on the inside of his cheek and watches Cas as he hangs in his shackles and gets paler by the minute.
“Women,” he spat out as soon as each of the ten students were seated. He paced the length of the room with his arms on his back. “You have to be aware of their deviousness. Don’t look at them, and if you cannot circumvent direct interaction, do not look into their eyes. That’s where the sin lies. The female gaze has the power to send out rays that tempt even the strongest men.”
Cas groans at that and bucks into the tunnel of Dean’s hand. God yes, he wants that, with a desperation that shocks himself. His thighs are trembling with the need to come and he looks down the length of their bodies, his own cock red and leaking, Dean covered in his own come, soft dick half tugged in his stained panties. Cas watches as Dean picks up speed, jerks him in that perfect pace.
And now Cas might be living proof of not only having a soul, but of the possibility that a soul can inhabit a new vessel.
Dean chuckles.
Dean didn’t ask who he meant. Cas had a way so see right through him, and it should have made him wary, but if he was being honest with himself, he liked the thought.
There’s a sigh lodged in his chest that finds its way out when Dean reacts, licks against the seam of his lips and dips inside Cas’ mouth. A tension that kept him strung tight for the last weeks loosens when Dean kisses him in earnest, curls his hand around Cas’ neck and makes a contended little sound, like he’s yearned for this just as much as Cas.
Dean Winchester doesn’t like surprises.
Cas tries again. “What I mean is. Why were you there? At the party?”
“Because they have a life elsewhere.” Cas takes a step closer to Dean, puts a hand on his shoulder. The right one. “Because this isn’t real.”
“I am aware that we can’t presume a person with your background to understand this, but I will try to explain the matter in simple words.”
“My name is Dean.” He smiles, a little shy, but his eyes are bright and clear. “And I want a divorce.”
“No? And where would I go, Cas? Stay here? Waste away in this godforsaken place and live by the charity of the monastery?” His tone is hard, and his eyes are red-rimmed. “And you would take in a man you don’t even know, a man you have every right to …”
No, the women were the ones Dean had to fear. All the sinful females that corrupted with their gazes and their looks, just like his mother had. She had ruined the life not only of her husband but that of her son, too. And Dean would never forgive her for that.
“Look, little brother, this has got to stop. You had your heart broken and I get that, but now it’s time to pick up your life again.” Gabe’s tone is soft and sympathetic. God, he must be real mess when his brother talks to him like that. “Come to the party. Maybe you’ll meet someone who can distract you from your misery.”
“My attempt was a failure, so I thought I’d leave,” Cas says, but he says it slowly as if he’s just now realizing that he can’t just get up and go as long as Dean is sitting in his fucking lap like a fucking idiot. Dean starts scrambling backwards, but Cas’ grip on his hips tightens.
Cas’ brain is still trying to catch up. “Wait. No, I didn’t mean ...” He walks over the stove, ignores the tingling sensation where he brushes against Dean’s side and turns the gas back on. “Please. Stay.”
Cas gulps down the last drops from the bottle and sinks into the cushions of the seat, in the vain hope they might swallow him. He’s had a few low points in his life but this might actually be the worst. He knows why he keeps away from people. Emotions are messy. In law, there’s right and wrong, black and white. Sometimes it’s hard to find out the truth but there are rules and precedents and he knows his way around them. Here, he feels like swimming in dark and muddy waters. He wants to reach out and crawl into Dean’s arms. He wants to get out of the car and never look back, never feel like this again.
He’s not sure what kind of greeting the situation warrants. Should he hug Dean? Kiss him? A handshake surly would be awkward, since those hands have already been in their respective underwear only hours ago. Dean rescues him and leans in for a soft peck on Cas’ cheek. Cas’ skin burns where Dean’s lips touch him and Cas reaches up with his hand to touch the spot.
Cas whispered, “Zachariah told us about the class and the reason for your punishment. You should practice yourself in humility, Dean.”
, he thinks.
“No, no, it’s fine, it’s okay I mean, he needs help, I help him out.” Dean is rambling, and Sam deduces from that fact alone that Dean is deeply shaken by whatever Cas and him are doing behind closed doors. That doesn’t come as a surprise to Sam becaue Dean and Cas and
“Bye Dean,” Cas whispers low enough that Dean won’t hear his voice breaking. The first burning tear grows and grows until it spills slowly over, runs down his cheek.
Cas had made that decision early, because in his heart he knew no woman would ever tempt him to leave his path. He had felt superior to the other novices who struggled constantly with the urges of their bodies. Not so Cas – he had found his joy in reading, in teaching, in silent contemplation, sure that he was safe from the temptation of the flesh. Looking back, it seems almost poetical. When he gave up the right to lay with a woman, he had had yet to learn that he was weak, too, that he could be crippled by longing and desire like every single one of his friends.
“Maybe I wanted to see you again?”
He’s only got time to slip from Dean’s mouth before his knees buckle and he sinks to the ground in an ungraceful heap. Dean chuckles and clears his throat. “Told you I was good,” he whispers almost voiceless. His throat must be raw after the way Cas used it.
His brain screeches to a full stop for one, two, three seconds.
The small lake lay hidden behind trees, invisible from the road. Sunlight filtered through the trees and sparkled on the quiet surface of the pond. Willows curled over the water and formed alcoves full of shadows. A small stripe of soft green grass lay between the forest and the shore. Dean remembered his awe at the beauty of it all when he had first stood here. He knew Cas would feel the same.
The boarding house is picturesque with its well-kept gardens and the porch painted in soft pastels. A little too tidy for Cas’ taste, just like the whole town with the neat cardigans and the perfectly coiffed hairstyles. There’s something off about it, and not just because there’s obviously something wrong with Charming Acres. During his years with the Winchesters Cas learned that he liked the little imperfections that made a thing – or a person – unique. Dean makes fun of him for his crooked tie and the wrinkled suit all the time. What Dean doesn’t know is, that Cas is perfectly capable of ironing his trench coat and straightening his tie, but he prefers them just the way they are. Dean also doesn’t have to know how much Cas enjoys it when Dean touches him to smooth his clothes and
Dean scoots over on the bench he’s sitting on and waves Cas closer. “Sit down. I wasn’t sure you’d c- you’d show up.”
“That will be all, Dean. I’ll see you in class.”
A few hours later, he’s sitting behind his desk, staring blindly down on a file. He came straight to the office. The thought of his empty house and the silence of his living room, his bedroom was unbearable. Better to occupy himself with work. Stacks of files had greeted him when he sat foot into his office. This way, he doesn’t have to think about the fact that he can still smell Dean on his skin, that he can still feel the bruise on his hip where Dean sucked his mark into Cas’ skin. He doesn’t have to remember the small sounds of pleasure that fell from Dean’s open lips at Cas’ touch.
Dean wakes up with a start, and Cas can feels his body shaking under his hand. He tugs it back immediately. “You were having a nightmare,” he says, and keeps his voice low and quiet to not startle Dean further.
“Thank you,” Dean murmurs. Cas leans his head to the side and breathes in the scent of Dean, fresh sweat and the smallest hint of whiskey, feels Dean’s hair tickle his cheek, and a minute later, sleep drags him under.
Dean clears his throat, and watches with satisfaction as the predatory grin falls from the strangers’ face.
“You are not alone.”
“You held yourself well,” Ash says. He looks like death warmed over, a large gash still oozing blood over his left eyebrow. Dean sees traces of his old pal in him, but a lot of the good-natured sass is replaced by cool strategic efficiency. “Not sure we would’ve made it without you.”
“No, not at all,” Gabe practically croons as he rounds Cas’ desk to stand in front of the tall man, close enough that he has to look up to him. Which he does. Like he’s admiring a painting. What happened here when I was gone, Cas wonders. Sam doesn’t seem to mind the attention, and blushes slightly.
A deep-felt thanks to everyone who commented and followed this story, for all the support here and over on tumblr. I was so close to giving up on this so many times and y'all made me pull through. One day, I might straighten this out into something more coherent, but for now, I'm happy it's finished, and I hope you enjoy.
John seemed to debate saying more, but in the end he just nodded, dug his heels into the flanks of his mare and left. Dean took a deep breath, before he led his horse to the stable to take care of her. He leaned against the warm flank for a minute or two, letting the choking lump of self-pity rise in his throat. He would not give in to the tears that pricked at the corners of his eyes. Straightening, he steeled himself. Time to face his future head-on.
A voice cries out.
“It doesn’t matter,” he mumbles against his palms, feeling like a child who admits that it’s afraid of the dark. “It’s over.”
Tries again.
“Yeah, you said that, and I … yeah, I … uhm … do that, too. But – what I need to know is, what you mean.” His heart is pounding in his throat and every nerve in his body is oh so ready to flee or fight, his muscles tense enough to cramp, but he’ll stay and hear Cas’ answer.
He stays put. It’s the angel who moves first. His steps are slow. Dean looks down to see his feet are shackled, too. The sounds of metal clashing and people dying gets drowned by the furious pounding of his heartbeat in his ears. Castiel closes the distance between them, a look of wonder transforming the features Dean knows like the back of his hand.
Leave it to Cas to just go and say something like that.
Cas nods minutely.
When Dean gets back to him, he splashes up from the water like a shining statue. Cas’ mouth is too dry to speak, and he doesn’t get the chance to, because an evil grin spreads over Dean’s features just before reaches out and dunks Cas under water. Cas grabs at Dean’s chest in reflex, stunned by the contrast between cold water and warm skin, as he struggles to come up again. Water runs into his eyes, blinds him when he breaks the surface again, but his hands are still curled into Dean’s skin. He should retaliate, but his plan changes as soon as he finds Dean’s smile through his blurred vision.
“God exists,” the students shouted.
A small part of him tells him he should be thankful for what he has, that big dysfunctional family he found in the most unlikely of places, all those people worming their way into his heart and his life, sticking around through all that happened. It’s a miracle, is what it is, and he should be content.
Here, in the most unforeseen of all places, he gets his chance, even if it’s still not real. Cas will stop, any moment now, but first … Bold, Cas licks against Dean’s lips. Dean’s whole body shudders when he opens up and invites Cas’ tongue inside. Dean fingers dig into his hips. His chest touches Cas’ with every inhale.
Winchester listens intently and has the audacity to smile. “Those are ambitious plans, Lieutenant Milton. Pray tell, does your superior know about this?”
Dean closes his lips tighter around him and sucks in his cheeks as if he’s urging him on. His eyes fly open and Cas gets lost in that gaze while he body stills, tenses as he’s riding that perfect plateau for long moments, unable to move, unable to look away. Slowly, slowly Dean leans closer, swallowing Cas to the root. The wave crests in slow-motion and buries Cas underneath. His cock jerks inside Dean’s mouth. He spills down Dean’s throat with a broken cry. Dean swallows, sending another wave of pleasure through Cas, and another, and another, until he’s spent.
“Boo!”, Cas says triumphantly as Dean takes a stumbling step back.
Cas looks around the room and takes in the rumpled sheets. The sight of the bed, clearly used by two people, and the memory of Dean, asleep in his arms, makes his heart ache with longing. It felt good to share a bed and feel a warm body next to his. It felt so good to take care of Dean when he had a nightmare. And it felt so, so good to feel wanted.
Cas nods in a short jerking motion, before the content of the question even registers. “I could do that.” His throat is tight and dry. He’s still half-hard and willfully ignoring the way his shorts flow around his groin, how the fabric shifts against him in the tiniest of caresses, how much he wants to pull Dean close again.
The letters on the page blur into unrecognizable shapes. He’s read the same paragraph five times and has no idea what it’s about.
He glides into the welcome coolness and swims over to Dean in four long strokes. It’s good to move. The familiar exercise dampens some of his nervous thoughts, and his body relaxes into the motion. Too soon, or not soon enough, Dean is next to him and Cas catches the edge of the pool as he realizes this is the deep end. He treads water while he blinks over at Dean.
He lets his voice go dark and low, because he knows exactly what it does to Cas. He’s rewarded with a shaky breath and a glare through dark lashes andthe beginning ofa smile.
“Will you join me?”
“I have to be honest, I don’t know what to do with you, boy. You don’t have enough Latin for our novice’s class, but you’re too advanced to sit with the villagers.” He let his hands fall onto the table. “What do
Where he knew Cas would be.
Dean’s voice is muffled through the fabric of the undershirt that Cas is tugging over his head in one sweeping motion so Cas can’t quite make out his answer, but it doesn’t sound very apologetic. When Dean's chest is finally, blessfully naked, Cas dives in to mouth along his collarbone and Dean sighs.
The guy reaches out with his right hand. “Dean Winchester.” He has the audacity to smile despite the situation. Cas grips his hand and realizes his palm is sweaty. He tugs it back quickly.
Dean nods. “Yeah, you did.”
Dean smiles a little smile when Cas hands him his coffee and their fingers touch for a second, but Cas still doesn’t find the words to start a conversation they should have had much, much sooner. This could feel like a typical Sunday morning of a couple who’ve known each other for years and enjoy the silence of a lazy breakfast. It could, but it doesn’t, because of the giant cloud of open questions that’s hanging in the air between them.
“Happy now?” Cas asks, and Dean nods slowly.
“What-,” Cas clears his throat again. “What are you doing here?” It comes out rougher than intended. His vocal chords feel like they’ve been sandblasted.
The blade falls to the ground. Bound hands reach up slowly until a thumb meets the skin on his cheeks to wipe away another tear. Feathers rustle and Dean blinks through his tears to watch them expand and twitch behind Castiel's back.
“We were separated from the rest of the group,” Cas starts, but falls silent again.
He has to get out of here. When the coffee is ready, he nods a quick thank you in the direction of the barista, grabs his cup and leaves the shop at a brisk pace. Once outside, he feels like he’s getting the first lungful of air again after holding his breath for too long. He slows down and sighs heavenward. The fresh autumn breeze clears his head a little.
“Winchester, I take it?”
“Dean,” Not-Castiel says, and it’s
He hears Gabe’s footsteps and then a warm hand lands on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, bro.” Gabe rubs his back like he used to when they were kids and Cas had the flu. It feels good. It feels like home.
Where was he? Right. Lucifer told Dean that some angels have souls. Dean had wondered about that when Cas first fell and became human. If his grace was lost, there had to be
“My mom… I don’t remember much of how she looked. It’s one image, mostly, and I sometimes think I dreamt it. She’s cutting bread and then she smiles and touches my head. It’s… disorienting.”
“He must be very happy about that,” Sam tries, carefully.
The air shifts with the energy blast of a dying angel.
Dean’s eyelids were heavy, too. He blinked them open slowly and a blurred face came into view.
“Almost there,” his father announced. His tone carried his conviction that Dean needed the hint, as if even detecting a building this size was above his mental capability.
Another stroke. The thick head of Dean’s cock vanishes in Dean’s broad fist. Dean squeezes and lets out a choked sigh.
Dean and Cas didn’t talk about the strangely intimate moments they had shared at night, but their bond grew stronger even without words. In March, Cas found Dean sleepwalking again, and he led him back to the dormitory. In a hushed voice he assured Dean that he wasn’t possessed, that his mind just worked differently from others, and Dean tried to believe him.
“If that’s what you have to do,” she says slowly. She worries her lip as she contemplates her next words. “I think you should know that I haven’t seen him this happy in a long while. Dean’s my best friend, and I know he fucks things up now and then, but he’s good guy, Cas.” She lets her hand slide down his arm to grip his hand in a reassuring squeeze. “I hope you’ll change your mind about this.”
“Why don’t you tell me what you know about this goddamn war,” he suggests, and Castiel, after a long pause, complies.
“Dean, you don’t have to…”
“My mother, she - she was an adulteress. She… fornicated with three men before my father found out.”
Gabe leads Sam out with a light touch on his arm, still very, very close to their new associate. Cas grins despite himself, before the implications crashed down on him like a landslide. What the hell is he supposed to do now? It was only a matter of time before anyone slips up, and people would realize that Cas’ mysterious heartbreaker is in fact Sam’s brother. The firm is small, and people gossip all the time.
“Don’t call me that.”
Sam stands and claps his brother on the back. “You should talk to him, Dean.”
“Bullshit,” Gabe gripes. He runs a hand through his hair and sighs like the weight of world is resting solely on his shoulders. His voice is softer when he continues. “What happened.”
He dusts off the shelves in the library, reorganizes the books.
When it’s time to part, they agree on meeting at the pool later. Cas goes over to the front desk to sort out the new room arrangements. He’s given a new room and has to vacate the one he shared with Dean till noon. He goes back up to his floor, lost in memories of their unexpected meeting, and he wonders if Dean is as shaken by it as he is. Probably not, he reasons, Dean will meet interesting people every day.
Dean has seen him fiddling with it in the rare quiet moments, saw him taking pictures of pigeons and dangelions that grow in the cracks of sidewalks.
They didn’t talk much in these days. Dean stayed on his own and kept his head down, hungry and bone tired because he didn’t sleep well with an empty stomach. The others gave him space, they offered encouraging smiles but didn’t start a conversation. Dean was thankful for that. He wouldn’t be good company anyway with his dark thoughts and whirling emotions.
“Let me see,” he rasps and tugs on a belt loop.
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs, because he has no right to touch him in a way he has always been too afraid to touch the real Cas. His Cas.
Cas picks up his spoon and adds some milk to his cereal. “Alright,” he mumbles, and starts to eat, pointedly ignoring the armada of butterflies somersaulting in his stomach.
It’s a small and greasy burger joint in the middle of goddamn nowhere.
The guys – green, huh – eyes flicker from Dean to Cas and back to Dean.
Sam looks up and puts on his
He changes his clothes, packs the letter detailing his appointment to his new post into a leather satchel and makes his way down to the harbor. The sun is just setting over the sea, pulling mists from the water, thick white clouds that can make a man disappear. Cas stops to give Bradbury his orders and slips unto Winchester’s ship undetected.
All too soon, it’s their turn.
“Do you love him?” His voice is guarded.
“In the movie,” Cas starts, but he looks unsure now. His gaze darts from Dean’s eyes to his mouth and back to his eyes. Then Cas squares his shoulders. “In the movie, the male protagonist surprised the female protagonist. They laughed about it. Then they kissed. It was clearly depicted as a human mating ritual,” he lectures, as if he’s recounting a spell or a historic fact to Dean.
Cas is not sure he’s ready to take the offer, but on the other hand, there’s not really an option. He’s confident he can’t embarrass himself any more than he already did. And after longing for such a long time to see Dean again, he’ll take this chance, even if it will hurt more in the morning. He mumbles his address and gives Dean a few directions, watches as Dean navigates the car out of the parking lot and unto the empty street.
“Do you hate me? For the things I asked of you.” Castiel is not quite sure why it matters, considering the grand scheme of things, but the question burns in his mind.
Ash shrugs and takes another pull from the bottle, swallows the harsh liquor without flinching. “I guess. He’s not like the other angels I’ve met. I think something happened to him. He doesn’t seem to know what happened himself, but he told me about strange dreams he had lately. And then one of the demons we captured acted strange around him, as if he carried some kind of disease.” He shrugs again, his bony shoulders going up to his ears. “I sure as hell wouldn’t mind to have him fighting with us, but the others are wary. That’s why he’s still in shackles.”
Everything about Dean is sensual, from the way he curls his hands around his coffee mug to the subtle glances he shoots Cas now and then, to his laugh and the way his muscles move under the thin t-shirt he’s wearing. Cas isn’t used to the constant urge to make Dean smile or touch him, or be touched by him. It’s disconcerting, and it frightens Cas a little, but he decides to be brave and see where this leads, decides he’s due for a bit of happiness, and sitting here, warmed by Dean’s radiant smiles, makes him more happy than he’s been for a long time.
Gabe grins his most annoying grin. “Won’t say”, he chirps. He hops off the desk and walks over to the door.
Dean wipes his already dry hands again, throws the towel into the sink, goes over, claps Jack on the back. “You did good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Something is very wrong, Cas can feel it in his bones, but he steps inside, curious how this will play out. “I don’t want to bother you–“
Dean’s head shoots up, eyes wide, mouth opening and closing around nothing. Sam waits.
Cas has a feeling that anything can happen, and for once in his life, it doesn’t scare him at all.
Mrs Smith looks from Dean to Cas and back before she busies herself at the bar, filling glasses with different clear liquids and what looks like olives. Cas never had a martini, because Dean does not believe in mixing alcoholic beverages. In the bunker, guests may choose between beer and whiskey. If Cas needed more proof that Dean is not himself, that he isn’t just messing with him, he has it now. When Mrs Smith hands him his drink, Cas takes out the toothpick and downs his glass in one go.
Cas moans softly every time he finds the right angle to drive Dean deep. He looks stunningly beautiful, eyes closed in concentration as if he wants to commit it all to memory. Dean can feel Cas’ thighs beginning to tremble under his hands, and starts rocking up into him with short thrusts, each of them drawing those perfect little sounds from Cas that Dean can’t get enough of. Cas’ head sinks forward to his chest when he lets go, lets Dean take over, and this, this is Dean’s favorite moment, every single time they make love. He holds Cas’ hips steady as he fucks him deep and languid, just the way Cas loves to be fucked, and ignores the pulse deep in his groin that tells him he won’t last long.
Dean stops breathing, waits for Cas to topple over, wondering how it will happen today, sudden or drawn-out, with his eyes open or closed.
“Did you have a good time tonight, honey?” Dean asks, looking up at Cas. “Did you enjoy being held open for me?”
“Why did you do that?” There used to be a time when Dean thought Cas was cute when he was upset (and if he’s honest he still kinda thinks that), but right now, he’s hungry and he’s nervous and he needs to eat.
He spends the afternoon alone in his room and contemplates the events of the last 24 hours. Dean breezed into his life like a whirlwind, tumbling carefully constructed fences and facades upside down. In the silence of his room, Cas takes stock of the new landscape Dean left behind, and to his surprise, he finds he likes it. He likes how Dean makes him feel and how Dean coaxes him out of his comfort zone, how Dean seems to acknowledge Cas’ boundaries, but tease him to step outside of them.
“It was amazing, is what it was,” Dean grouches. His voice drops to a whisper. “You are amazing.”
“I think now is exactly the time. In fact I think it’s been time for a while now. The first memory that came to me was of
“Back to plan A,” Jack says, a defeated look on his face. He seems to consider talking Dean out of it, but only opens his mouth and closes it again.
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, but– woah!”
Castiel lets his touch linger. Standing next to the bed, he foresees that not only the fate of the world but his own will be tied to this man. Whatever comes next, it will happen with Castiel right by Dean Winchester’s side.
Oh. Ooooh-kay.
This chapter gives a glimpse into scholastic philosophy. I always enjoyed these kinds of arguments, so I wanted to have one in the story. The ontological argument is one of the most prominent arguments in the history of philosophy and was famously discussed by Anselm, René Descartes and Immanuel Kant. I highly recommend looking it up if you like logic and riddles.
His thumb hovers over the call button, when a new wreaking sobs breaks free from somewhere behind his ribs.
Strong hands work on his constraints. Muttered curses. With his vision slowly coming back, Dean can make out a figure over by Cas’ side. Deft hands opening the shackles. Cas’ lifeless body falls into waiting arms. Jack’s arms.
“No, Cas, we are–,”
Dean's leg needs to be amputated because of an infected wound. You can skip the paragraphs from "Ellen walls over" to "By the time" without losing important information.
Thanks so much for the nice comments!! Your feedback really means a lot!
He patted his chest where his heart beat like a drum.
Cas hands are on Dean’s shoulders. Their grip tightens when Dean repeats the teasing.
What a mess of an evening.
After a long while of just savoring Cas’ kiss, Dean tentatively started to reciprocate. He moved his tongue to meet Cas’ and circled it. Cas’ grip tightened on Dean’s fingers and Dean took that as a good sign so he tried it again. This time he was rewarded with a low moan. Gaining confidence, Dean explored and teased just like Cas had done before, sliding his tongue against teeth and sucking on Cas’ full lips, while he pushed up against Cas’ hips.
Cas sat next to him. So close that Dean’s side felt warmer, so close he could smell him, herbs and fresh sweat and a hint of old books. Dean breathed the familiar mix in and took comfort in it.
They had opened Castiel’s restraints the day after he had saved Dean’s life. Dean had vouched for him and promised that he would take full responsibility. He still doesn’t know what made him do it. Apparently, he can’t help but trust Castiel, no matter the world they find each other in. He didn’t look to closely at the way his heart leaped in his chest when Castiel sighed in relief after Ash had opened the cuffs, when Castiel looked up to stare right at Dean in a silent thanks.
“Nothing. I just thought that we both aren’t very good at this.” He indicates the rest of the room, full of couples whispering and laughing, and while the PDA is kept to a minimum, the nature of the acquaintances is blatantly clear.
“But that’s just it, sir. Winchester only has a room there. I asked a few of the girls about him and they say none of them ever … uhm.” Bradbury’s face turns a dark shade of red. “Isn’t that peculiar, sir?”
Dean vanishes in the bathroom and Cas listens to him shower. Dean hums a Zeppelin song while he brushes his teeth. Then he comes back out, this time wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He slips under the covers on his side of the bed, turns his back to Cas and mumbles good night.
Cas waves the compliment away. “You, too,” he croaks, all the other words like
Definitely not shy anymore, Cas palms his own filling cock and just stands there, feet a few inches apart, on their patio, expression stormy and turned-on in equal measure.
“Did she love this other man?”
As he Exits the bathroom, he walks right into the long line of Cas’ body. The sound he makes is not a squeal, but might be mistaken as one by a bystander how doesn’t know that Dean Winchester doesn’t squeal.
“And you would want that? Kiss me?”
Lucifer chuckles. The sound runs down Dean’s spine like ice.
Dean looks smaller on the bed, a fragile human with the iron will of a titan. Castiel reaches out and lets his fingers trace the lines of Dean’s face, his strong jaw and his slightly crooked nose, the fullness of his lips and the crease between his brows. The touch quiets Dean’s restless movements, and his face relaxes gradually when Castiel takes away the pain. It’s time for Castiel’s heart to hammer in his chest. His wings spread in another sphere, the rustle loud in the silence of the night.
Dean’s hands creep higher slowly, to part Cas’ cheeks. Cas’ mouth falls open when the motion moves the plug inside him. Dean knows exactly how he feels. The constant pressure must have driven him half-nuts over the last few hours. Dean nudges a finger against the base of the silicone, just a bit, and Cas squirms above him.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Gabriel demands as he storms into the room to loom over Cas. The looming only works because Cas is sitting down, but he doesn’t mention that, and he refrains from standing up, even though every brotherly instinct screams at him to assert his dominance. Cas deserves this. So he lets his brother loom over him.
“Drink that”, he orders, and Cas obeys, grateful for the chance to get sour taste out of his mouth and having an excuse to not talk.
Lucifer spares him a sideway glance. If he’s surprised by the sudden interest in his plans, he doesn’t show it. “I’m glad you ask, Dean-o. See, for all its bleakness and pitiable lack of entertainment, I’ve grown fond of this place. A whole world just waiting for a king to bring order to its chaos, a strong hand to teach those crawling hordes a little respect. It’s like hell, but with so much more possibilities, you know?”
“Uhm, here’s the thing, I–“
Summer went by in a daze. Between classes, silent repetition, services and the tasks Father Robert assigned him to, Dean barely had time to think. He liked that, because being busy trumped being alone with his thoughts any day.
Gabe has an arm slung around Sam’s middle and makes an ushering motion with his left. Sam’s looking down at Gabe with a fond little smile, nodding, and Cas has to admit, they make a pretty cute couple. The pang of jealousy he felt at the party feels like a distant memory, now that Dean’s back in his life.
So he breathes.
gets Dean’s attention. Dean opens his eyes slowly to watch Cas unbuttoning his shirt, letting it slip over his shoulders. He’s casually stepping out of his pants. Cas’ boxer briefs drop to the floor next. The soft light from the living room illuminates his golden skin, throws shadows along his lean muscles. He’s fucking beautiful, Dean thinks, just like every single time he sees Cas naked.
“Ah.” Dean fiddled with a loose thread on his habit. “I… I have a brother.”
“I leaned over the sink, on hand on the mirror, and fucked my fist thinking of you.”
The red-haired woman chokes on a laugh and hides her grin behind a hand. Cas sits down and sets down his plate – fruit and a bowl of cereals – before he glares at Dean. Dean’s blush deepens. “This – this is Charlie. Charlie, this is Cas.”
Maybe Dean will shoot him one of those cocky looks and he will ask “Are you always this loud?” and Cas will say, maybe, “Wouldn’t you like to know?” and Dean, Dean might answer, “Yes, I’d like to find out.”
Dean wants to ask about it, when a loud bang rattles the walls of the building. The earth shakes underneath Dean. A wave of pressure blasts through the room, picks up pieces of paper and debris and takes them with it. Dean’s ears are ringing.
want that, but he doesn’t want him to go either. He’s swaying a little on his feet while he waits for Dean’s reaction. The harsh light in the hallway seems ten times brighter than a few hours ago when he got ready to leave. His head pounds with each beat of his heart.
Dean steps away gingerly but stays at Cas’ side. When Cas is done hurling the remnants of his dinner and the last shreds of his dignity onto the pavement, Dean starts cleaning the worst of the puke from his shoes with a tissue, then lays a warm hand on Cas’ neck.
Cas keens and throws his head back, sits down hard on Dean’s exploring finger, and honestly, Dean will never tire of this sight, of Cas taking what he wants from him.
“You have no idea how
It’s Cas’ turn to look away. “It’s disconcerting to have so many different emotions inside me. I should feel like two different beings, but it’s not as simple like that. I know that I used to be different – in both … lives, you might say, but now I’m only me. And at the same time, I don’t fully understand what I’m feeling–“ He sighs and rakes a hand through his already messy hair. “I wish to understand what connects us.”
, and with it longing like I never experienced before and the desperate need to find you again. Before I remembered anything else, it was
Experimentally, Cas opens his lips over the bulging head and sucks. Dean whimpers, so he does it again, until the fabric is soaked with his spit and more precome. The material feels odd under his tongue and tastes a bit like washing detergent, but Cas loves the way it makes Dean squirm and wriggle under him. When the panties are dark with wetness and Dean is panting, he gently pushes the waistband down under Dean’s balls and lets his erection spring free.
Cas had been desperate to do this for almost ten years.
Cas nods solemnly. “Of course.”
So it's been over a year since the last update. That's ... not what I planned. But I have a few free days on my hands and good chunks of the last two chapters are already written, and I AM DETERMINED to get this done. For anyone who just stumbled over this: Hi! I hope you like it. To all the folks who stayed with me through this story: Thank you for your patience, y'all are angels.
It’s better this way, Cas tells himself, but he doesn’t quite believe it.
Dean gets lost in the wet glide of their bodies, pleasure curling around his spine in ever tighter circles. The light buzz from the drinks, the soft light and the sounds of the night give it all a surreal quality. The way Cas grinds down on him is a steady, achingly perfect torture.
They stay at the lake house. Cas keeps to himself at first. He takes long walks around the lake, clearly enamored with the trees and thriving nature around them.
“What happened?”
When he goes over to the bed, he finds a note. The handwriting is neat and the letters well-rounded. Cas takes a second to admire it before he forces himself to read and learn what Dean has to say about this morning.
More often than not, he found Castiel staring at him, with a crease between his brows and a soft smile on his lips. The expression was a contradiction just like Castiel himself. He had been friendly but reserved when they had met two days after Dean’s arrival to discuss his education. Dean had told him what he had told Father Robert and empathized the fact that he was willing to work hard to make up for his advanced years. Castiel had listened and nodded and looked at his hands that lay flat on the table in the study hall. Dean was used to people facing him when he talked. Castiel’s behavior made him nervous.
Cas listens to Dean’s moans and he ignores the way his pants grow tight, just as he ignores the way Dean flirts with Sunny, and he decidedly does not, for the thousandth time, imagine how it would feel if that charm would be directed at him.
“That is why, as far as I know, certain other kinds of release are deemed more sinful than laying with a prostitute.”
“Okay.” Sam worries his bottom lip between his teeth. He’s got to tread carefully. “But you don’t feel comfortable doing it?”
The question earns Dean a raised eyebrow. Right, Cas doesn’t know what he means, so Dean opens his mouth to explain –
“Dean,” he chokes put, and maybe it’s a warning, but Dean ignores it, just hums that content hum again, the one that makes Cas so very helpless. He comes with thunderclap, so hard he blacks out for a second and his ears are ringing with the force of it. Dean works him through it, whispering hoarse endearment Cas can’t quite make out through the roaring in his heartbeat.
“I couldn’t leave you there,” is all Castiel says, and while it
“You are Dean Winchester. And I am Castiel. I raised you from hell and saved your life a hundred times after that. I’m not going to lose you to some kind of Stepford wife.” Cas is a little proud of himself that he made a fitting movie reference, even if Dean’s not fully there to appreciate it.
It feels weird to go back up to his room and get dressed again only to get undressed later, but Cas does it anyway. He settles for grey slacks and a dark blue short-sleeved button down. His stomach flutters with nerves the whole way to Dean’s room and he pauses for long minutes in front of the door.
Dean watched Castiel closely. He caught himself doing that more often. Castiel’s gaze was cast down, his brows drawn together. Dean couldn’t even begin to imagine what thoughts and ideas whirled through that quick and clever head. But he wanted to know. Was Castiel afraid of anything? Did he sometimes dream of another life? Did he sometimes wish he was like the others who didn’t ask questions all the time?
Lucifer comes and goes. He takes Cas’ grace, leaving him weakened and desolate. Sometime, he ignores Dean and his hoarse threats, sometimes he takes the time to kick him in the ribs on his way through the hall, smirk down on him and tsk as if he’s disappointed in Dean’s lack of manners.
Dean looks so lost and unsure. It’s a look Cas never wants to see again on his face, but right now, it warms him up inside, seeing how serious Dean is about this, the evidence of his emotions clear on his face, a mirror of his own desperation to make things right again.
“I already told you I see the grave error of my ways,” he tells Dean while he rubs a thumb up and down his length. “Would you allow me to continue on the path of my enlightenment?” At Dean’s nod, he opens the buttons of Dean’s pants, one at a time, and shoves the fabric down Dean’s hips. He takes his time taking off Dean shoes and socks, then realizes how rough the carpet is under his hands and helps Dean up on the bed. He tugs Dean’s pants all the way off, revealing a new set of panties – this one bright pink satin.
Stomach full, coffee warming him up and clearing his mind, Cas runs out of excuses to put this off any longer.
“She died in a fire when I was ten years old. I didn’t know what she had done before and I guess my dad didn’t either. She had met another man and lain with him. We learned later that there were others before that.” His voice dropped into a whisper, and his cheeks heated with shame.
It’s still there, the heat in Dean’s eyes, the answering tightness low in Cas’ belly, as if the last weeks didn’t happen. The ease of falling into playful banter. There’s still a lot to talk about, but right now, Cas wants to wrap himself in this feeling.
Instead, he’s lounging on a deck chair on the patio he built behind their house and sips a colorful cocktail through a straw while the moon shines over the flower beds Cas planted a few weeks back.
Cas still wonders how he can use his newfound knowledge how to make Dean squirm, when Dean grabs Cas’ by the neck and pull him forward into a deep kiss. Dean
After long moments, out of the blue, Winchester speaks up again. “My father came here as a soldier and got discharged. He wasted his life in the taverns, drinking away what little money was left. He was a drunkard and quick to use his fists instead of his wits. So you’ll excuse me when I don’t have the highest opinion of men who the Royal Navy declared to be worthy advocates of the British Empire.”
“Why now?” he asked, and when Dean shot him a confused look, he elaborated. “Your mother died when you were ten, but your father sent you here last year.”
“Open your eyes, Cas, please,” Dean panted. And he knew he wasn’t playing fair, but he curled his hips again and reveled in the shiver that ran through the body under him and the grunt Cas couldn’t hold in.
After a few minutes, it’s clear Dean’s having a nightmare. He’s crying out softly and tossing around. Cas tries calling his name, but Dean doesn’t wake up, so Cas reaches over an touches Dean’s arm, carefully at first, then shoves him a little.
Ellen sits atop her own old horse with a straight back and determination in her eyes. When Cas explains to her what happened, her mouth thins into a straight line and she grips her stirrups tighter. “I was good of you to call me. From what you tell me, we will have to take the leg. But Castiel,” she reaches over between their swaying horses and touches his arm lightly, “it’s possible it won’t save him.” Her eyes are warm. Cas wonders what she sees, how much he’s already given away.
“I think lust clouds men’s minds. Just like power, it bends their morals and impairs their judgement. So I understand why it’s seen as sin, as an invitation for evil forces. For that reason, I agree with the scholars – any act committed not with the clear goal of procreation should be avoided.”
The wound on Dean’s leg festers. Neither Charles nor Cas had been aware how bad it was, only realize the extent of the inflammation when Dean’s fever spikes. Dean never wakes up, but tosses and turns for hours. Cas sits by his side whenever his responsibilities allow it, keeps watch when Sam and Charles sleep.
“I don’t think you do,” the monk shot back. “You will fast with bread and water for the next five days and spend your free hour in the chapel, contemplating the nature of sin and the grave danger your soul is in.”
“Is there a defined amount of time in which I have to say it?”
Cas’ breathing hitches next to him, but Dean pretends not to hear. His thumb is drawing patterns under the head, and he revels in the friction of the fabric.
Gabe clears his throat. “Now that we cleared that up, I want it to go on record that I was right.” He has to bend his neck to look up at Sam. “It was my idea after all to introduce them to each other. And now I have proof that they’re a perfect match, since they’re both complete idiots who should be happy we’re looking out for them.”
The pressure built until his heart thumped furiously and he had to sink his teeth deep in his bottom lip to keep quiet.
“Take your time to think it through and tell me if you found the problem. The same applies for all of you. We are not discussing these arguments to disprove them, but if we find flaws, we should talk about them.” He turned and went back to the front of the room. “Now, to the different versions of this argument. The most prominent goes back to Anselm of Canterbury, an Italian cleric...”
Cas nods. He knows that the procedure is a risk. He’s seen men and woman bleeding to death after an amputation. He’s seen the gangrene come back after the limb had gone. He’s seen patients too weak to recover from the shock.
There’s knock on the door. Cas takes a steadying breath and says, “Come in.”
Time flies by while they get to know each other. Every new thing Cas learns sheds another beam of light on the person he’s slowly falling for. Dean is so much more than the man he first saw at the reception desk. He’s bright where Cas is stern, energetic where Cas is contemplative, practical where Cas is academic. They shouldn’t fit so well, but they do, and in Dean’s warm eyes, Cas begins to see what Dean might see in him, a riddle to be solved, a yin to Dean’s yang that he wants to figure out. It’s what Cas feels anyway, and he’s sure he wouldn’t be able to figure Dean out even if he had years.
Dean watches over Sam’s shoulder when Eileen picks up. He watches from the war room table when Sam opens the door for her. Waves hello and slinks back in his room to give them space.
