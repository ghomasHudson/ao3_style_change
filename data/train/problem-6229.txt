Even though he hadn't had a drink in 6 years, he was now halfway through his second bottle and still didn't feel that comforting haze that the booze used to give him. It had only made his anger grow.
"Between that he wanted to be a ballet dancer, an astronaut and a doctor. Now he does ballet on Thursdays."
He didn't answer the questions. Pepper appeared in his office with a box. All his stuff in a small, pityful box. He was craving for a bottle of scotch.
However, the odds were more in favor of him dying there. Tony had known for a long time that he wouldn't die peacefully in his sleep when old. He expected to die on the battlefield, or killed violently in a dark alley. Not frozen to death. He had never thought of frozen to death.
The day after he was discharged. He gave the press conference, to announce that there wasn't anything to worry about, that he just needed time for himself.
His phone vibrates and he has a spark of hope that it's a call for the avengers. At least it'll give him something to do. He unlocks the phone with his thumb and deflates when he sees the notification for a work email. He reads it anyway, might as well be useful than lie there watching Steve sleep. (It's not creepy, he's just very bored and Steve is ten times more interesting to look at than the ceiling.) He types a detailed answer to the intern, telling to go to bed while he's at it. His phone tells him only 2 minutes passed and he gives up. He's not gonna spend another night like this. He gets up, and goes to the kitchen making as little sound as humanly possible. He opens the fridge and gets the rest of the dinner's wine.
Steve sat back, taking Tony with him. His back was pressing against the soldier's chest, and Steve put his arms all around the mechanic. His chin was resting on Tony's curly hair.
"Pete, go to the kitchen an grab a trash bag, I'm parked in front of the house," he practically had to scream in his kid's hear.
He loves being with Steve, there's no point denying it. It's easy, safe and most importantly exciting. He loves him, and Steve loves him too, which he still has a hard time wrapping his head around. It's not perfect, of course. They fight sometimes, for dumb things, but it never lasts nor it impacts their work on the battlefield.
"When I was 15, at MIT, the first party I ever went to, no one took me seriously, right? I was a kid, I definetly shouldn't have been there, but I wanted to prove myself to them because I was arrogant and stupid. I have almost no memory of that night." Peter turned his head then, eyebrows up in confusion. "Woke up the next day in a hospital bed. They tell me I drank too much and almost died. They call Howard, who deals with it like everything else, ergo, not dealing with it, and send me back to MIT with a big cheque to the Dean to forget the whole thing."
Peter looked at the giant beer stain on Tony's shirt, his mouth forming an 'o' and then at his feet and nodded. Tony crouched down next to Ned and shook his shoulder until he opened his eyes.
Peter nodded and loweres his head on Tony's shoulder. His breathing was evening, his eyes fought to stay open.
"You blacked out. Friday called Pepper, and she called me when they found you." he paused,.You've been out for 2 days, Tones."
It took a few seconds before Steve turned to face him. Even in the darkness Tony could see his puffy eyes and red cheeks.
"You were under the water for 8 minutes before Thor could get you out. You could have-" He stopped himself then, a hand coming up to his mouth.
Steve's shampoo had been the same for years, and a pang of sadness rushed through Tony as the smell of it englobed him. It was pathetic, really, how his heart still did weird things when he saw Steve. How Steve still felt like home, even in a house where Tony had never lived.
The AI's voice was distant behind the panic in Tony's chest. His vision blurred, he heard voices and languages that he hadn't heard since… since… they were going to drown him, or electrocute him before the sharpnel got to his heart. The car battery next to him sparkled, and something pulled him out of the water.
He slowly opened his eyes. White lights appeared, burning like hell. He forced himself to keep them opened. When he had accommodated to the neons, he turned his head to the left, to see a sleeping colonel.
"You better have a damn good excuse to call, Steve." the tone was arsh, maybe his soon-to-be ex-husband didn't deserve that, but the whiskey in his veins decided for him.
It might have been more than a second, because when he came out of the bathroom, the Leeds were pushing a swaying Ned through the door, saying goodbye to Steve and profusely apologizing for the inconvenience. Steve closed the door behind them and let a shaky breath out. He turned to Tony, the ghost of a smile on his lips.
His voice was thick with sleep and annoyance of being woken up in the middle of the night by his ex-husband.
After 40 minutes through the empty streets and many road infractions he found the right street, and quickly spotted the house full of drunk teens and too loud music. He realized how cold it was when the wind wipped through his thin shirt.
The next time he woke up, his head hurt, his stomach was wrecked, or so it felt. Tony was exhausted, and had no idea why. There wasn't voices anymore, only silence.
"Uh, yeah, once and- and he's sleeping I think, we're in the room-" he cut himself and shouted something about the bathroom before comming back to the phone. "The, uh, parent's room, I think. Or guest, I don't know."
Tony can't help but laugh. This is what he did. He turned Captain America into a guy who tiptoes around words to make sure he doesn't upset him. Because who knows what a drunk will do if he's upset. Tony burries his face in his hands and the humorless laugher turns into barely concealed weeps. He might be way more drunk than he thought, or maybe it's the bone-deep faigued that settled yesterday. Or both.
He pours the yellowish liquid in the first glass he finds drying next to the sink, maybe the equivalent of 2 or 3 shots. He downs it in one go. He doesn't waste time to dwell on the fact that kitchen rum is really awful to drink. The rum burns his throat and his chest. He lets out a sigh of relief and refill his glass.
He waits in the dim lit kitchen for the alcohol to do its magic, nursing his third (or forth?) glass. The oven reads 3:47, in blurred bright red numbers. It turns 3:48 when Steve's voice rings in the quiet appartment.
Steve offered him a clean t-shirt and sweatpants and got a towel out for him. He took the beer- soaked shirt off once he was in the bathroom, and remembered for a brief second what it tasted like. That was the kind of dangerous trail of thoughts that he learned to put in the background, or straight up forget.
Everything is fine. Steve and him are good. SI is doing well. No alien has tried to invade earth in 73 days. The last update to JARVIS's security systems worked wonders.
The pain in his chest rose more and more. If they get out here alive, he'll surely have a 3 degrees burn around the arc reactor. Everything else hurt so much he felt numb from the pain. He couldn't think, his mind focused on the fact that he couldn't feel his fingertips or his toes anymore. A mechanic without hands, that was something he really didn't want to see.
Admittedly, a part of him is still expecting the other shoe to drop. "You know what, i thought things over and it's not working." "You don't pay enough attention, you don't love me enough." "I can't deal with you anymore."
Steve shrugged and laughed, and for a moment Tony felt like the last three years didn't happen. Tony got up and brought Peter's bowl and his cup in the sink. He started rincing them and doing the few dishes that layed there from, he guessed knowing Steve, the night before. Steve came up behind him, put his cup and his plate in the sink. Tony could feel his breath on his neck, a shiver ran through his back.
Tony's and Peter's heads turned around to face Steve, both hands raised, palm out. He glared at Tony before turning to Peter.
Tony waited for the answer, for the shouting. For the look on captain America that would made him feel even more like a useless weak man. Steve kept silent.
The medics made him sit with a hot coffee in hand, while the rest of the Avengers was talking with them. He drank slowly, more for the heat burning his throat than for the caffeine. Someone sat next to him, but Tony didn't react.
"And from now on, you tell us where you are. I'm not gonna forbid you to go anywhere, I'm not delisunal enough to think I could if I wanted," that made Peter's lips tugged upwards and Tony counted it as a win."But I want to know. And if you don't respect that i have the means to track you down so don't try me."
" Sorry, I shouldn't have tell you that, forget it " he tried to shrug it off " it's old and not really interesting. "
He clenched the counter, Steve's knuckles turning white with strain. Tony stepped back until his legs hit a chair.
Tony climbed under the cover with him, and Steve secured his arm around Tony's waist. Steve's breathing was warm on Tony's hair.
Tony put the cups aside to dry and rinced his hands. Steve was already handing him a towel when he turned around. He dried his hands slowly, under Steve's watchful eye. He had his disappointed face on.
The sun was already set when he dragged himself in the workshop.  The weeks where Peter was at Steve's place were the weeks where he could work the most and put out most of his work. Every other week, he packed his schedule with meetings and workshop sessions so that he could spend time with his son. He pulled up ongoing projects and hollograms and revision notes and looked tiredely at his cluttered desk. A wave of exhaustion washed over him as he got to work. He wished the pot of coffee on the burner was enough to keep it at bay.
“You've never fed birds, Cap? I figured back in your day that was the only entertainment outside of watching paint dry.”
He heard a creak as the door opened and shut, and he relaxed as he realized who it was. Tony came in and sat down beside him. He pushed himself around to lay his head in his lap and Tony brushed a hand through his hair.
Funny how two days ago he was planning to never let Tony join the pack, just so he could avoid this moment, and now he didn’t care. Hell, he thought it was funny, how satisfied Tony was about being right, even while looking like a drowned puppy.
He still didn’t respond, hoping she would go away. Instead she walked over, and ran her hand through his hair a few times. She sighed, and he closed his eyes, feeling the soft puff of her breath against his cheek.
They circled again, eyeing each other up. Much like their human forms, Steve was significantly bigger, standing three and a half feet tall at the shoulder. Tony was slighter as well, his long legs built for speed. He was a handsome wolf, Steve had to admit, with his dark brown fur fading to a cream on his stomach. His ears and paws were tipped with black and coupled with his slender build, it all created an almost fox like appearance. It suited him well.
“That’s good. I used to sleep like this with Bucky all the time, back when we had no heat and the wind whistle through the house like it was trying to hold a tune. Winters always get cold, down in 12.”
“It wasn't that bad,” Steve said, trying to defend Tony, who laughed it off good naturedly. “You grew up in the depression, I'm sure if I served you some dandelions on a plate you'd tell me it was the finest salad you've ever eaten. I'm great at many things, including being just amazingly modest….”  and at that he had to dodge the mug Clint threw at him, which Steve caught before it could hit the ground and primly put back on the table outside of Clint’s reach. Tony stuck out his tongue at Clint and continued, “But I'm willing to admit that cooking isn't one of my strong suits. That's why takeout was invented. I'm the futurist, I'm waiting for the day that food comes out of a box with the touch of a button, then I'll be laughing while you look back on all the years you wasted learning to cook.” He folded his arms as Natasha snorted.
“Yikes! You’re pretty quiet for such a big guy, it’s unnerving. Is this part of the hazing I have to go through before I can be a part of your special club? If I prove you can’t startle me and I can carry suitcases with my soft and spoiled arms you’ll stop being such a huge dick, and we can start to try to make the best of this situation?” Tony snapped.
Tony splashed him in the face. Clint pulled off his shirt and cannon balled into the water between them, soaking them both. Jan jumped in right behind, splashing Clint as he came back up. It quickly devolved into a water fight of epic proportions. It was hours before they squwelched their way home in their wet cloths. The broke apart at the stairs to go to their separate rooms, and Steve stopped Tony. He leaned awkwardly in the doorway while he stood in the hall, water slowing dripping off of them to hit the floor with small plinks, sprinkling dots like stars on the swirls of the wood.
The first few weeks were terrible. People looked at us with pity in their eyes, always whispering behind our backs. Child services was sniffing around for a bit, but I’m old enough that they let it fly. We were afraid to shift on the moon, people were constantly stalking through the woods with their rifles looking for the animals who did it, before the monsters attacked their homes. Even a couple of out-of-towners came in, some sort of biology team. They wanted to relocate the animals, or maybe study them. Getting into a locked house to kill more than a dozen people is apparently ‘scientifically interesting’ behavior. A couple reporters interviewed us too. Some for the town paper, a couple nut jobs who thought it was Bigfoot. Only guy who guessed it really was werewolves sent me a letter wanting to create a team like we were superheroes or something. I didn’t respond to any of the crazies, no point in encouraging them, and eventually the messages tapered off.
Steve read it through quickly and crumpled it up in his fist, his face going red. “Doesn’t say anything important. Tony, hold out your leg, I want Bruce to take a look at your ankle before I try to wrap it. Nat, Clint, go find him a good stick to walk with.”
Tony conceded the point and pulled off his shirt and pants. Steve turned to face the wall so Tony could pull off his underwear. He might be half wolf but he was a full gentleman.
Jan cackled. “Don’t worry, Clint and I are on the case! We’ll take care of it.” She gave him a pat on the cheek and ran off to wherever Clint had gone.
Tony bent over and looked at her curiously. “How do you know? She looks exactly like all of the other cows.”
“That's because there's no one else competing for the title. Best archer for our team is more like a participation prize at this point. Now who's ready to break some eggs?”
Steve dropped his hand. “It was worth a shot.” He rubbed at his chest absentmindedly. “I might actually take the stitches out, they’re itching.”
“And if I don’t? You’ll do what? Put me back in the games?” Tony started to laugh, a harsh wheezing thing, cut off as the peacekeeper hit him in the face. The peacekeeper grabbed him by the arm and dragged him along the ground and threw him in the chair. Tony bent over, holding a hand to his eye, still laughing under his breath. Beside him Hammer had gone white as a sheet. Tony could practically see the perception of the peacekeepers being there to keep everyone safe falling away. Tony put his hand down so Hammer could see the full glory of his swollen eye.
Steve tried to put his hand on Tony’s shoulder and Tony moved away, rejecting the offer of comfort with a bitter twist of his lips. He glared Steve down and finished his story with a sharp note in his voice.
It wasn’t the worst kiss Tony had ever received, that honor went to the time Tiberius kissed him without permission while drunk then immediately threw up on his shoes. This one was still bottom ten though. The cut on Tony’s lip stung and Steve drew back before he had the time to process what was happening.
Tony recognized him immediately, and how could he not? He was King Thor’s most loyal knight, the leader of the Dragon Guard, and the hero of the great war. Though Tony had never met him in person, he recognized his face and knew his name- Steve Rogers. Tony remembered being at the armory to drop off his latest batch of weapons, and watching a dragon descend from the sky in a flurry of wings. Tony knew the beasts were huge, but seeing it in person impressed upon him for the first time how truly large they were. The dragon stretched the full length of the courtyard, and it stood twice as high as their largest horse, filling the air with a crackling energy. The dragon stared at Tony who was standing frozen, its eye as large as his fist and shining with a weird intelligence. Tony felt himself being sucked in, and he stepped closer as everyone else drew back in fear. The dragon smelled warm, like an barn cat’s fur after it had been sleeping in the sun. Tony found his hand stretching out, a need to touch the smooth blue scales bursting to life inside him. The dragon snorted a jet of steam at him and he jumped back with a yelp. For a second Tony got the impression of laughter, the dragon’s eyes dancing and tail flicking. Then the rider whistled and the moment was broken. The rider dismounted and Tony recognized him as the Captain. He hurried inside the castle, and Tony went back to his work, the image of the dragon’s burning blue eyes still haunting him. The Captain had looked good then, tall and strong in his uniform, light blond hair tousled from the wind and glinting in the sunlight. His stride and movements were confident, coming from years of command. Now he was still and pale. Blood darkened his shirt, and Tony pulled it up to reveal a long jagged cut. It wasn’t too deep, and he sighed in relief. Even his meager skills could handle this. He left to get supplies, the overseer watching him closely. He cleaned the cut with water, dabbing at it carefully with a cloth. Once he was satisfied, he threaded a needle and made a row of neat stitches, tying the skin together and stopping the bleeding. He finished by wrapping the man’s chest to try to keep everything clean. There was always dust in the air around the mine and an infection when he was already so weak would prove fatal for the Captain. His work done, Tony stepped back. The overseer examined his work and nodded.
Steve perked up and thought to himself, "Oh? Didn’t hate him? Did that mean he liked him? Not that he cared of course….
Tony could feel his anger as almost a physical presence pushing down on him. He felt a wave of cool calm and Steve shoulders untensed from under his arm. Tony remained silent for the rest of the trip. It hurt to hear that the greatest hero of their generation was cursing his name, especially since he wasn’t aware that Tony hadn’t known that the swords or plane plans were going to Loki, and Tony had spent the last few months trapped in the mines with the other prisoners. Was Steve wrong to hate him though? Whether he had know or not didn’t change the fact that people were dead. He should have been more careful, more aware of what was happening to the swords he so proudly labeled ‘Stark.’ He hadn’t done enough, and he still wasn’t doing enough, taking Steve from his dragon and back to captivity where they would have to try to escape again.
“Spill, or else I’ll go ask Tony. And you know he overshares.” Natasha threatened. Steve was unimpressed.
She stood in the doorway for a second, not sure how to conclude. Finally she turned and walked away, back to the outside where there were relationships to mend and work to be done. Steve stared at the doorway after she left. He closed his eyes. Opened. Closed. Opened. Had it been two hours or two minutes?
“You mean we should ask the sponsors?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded. Tony shook his head. “It made you upset last time when we kissed. I’m not going to force you.”
“We don’t have a relationship.” Tony said petulantly, leaning away. “That was just an excuse to send me here.”
Steve was a short man in his late twenties, pale hair and striking blue eyes, and his fingers were long and delicate where they were resting on the doorknob. Piano fingers, is what Tony’s mom would have said. There were smears of wet paint running up his arms and his apron was covered with the stuff. He was staring at Tony with wide eyes.
After Tony’s Sleeping Beauty routine where he said he’d walk through Hell as long as Steve was there, he had reevaluated their relationship and realized they had passed being purely platonic friends weeks ago when they started referring to their weekly dinners as date night and sharing closet space. Now they were officially together and couldn’t be happier.
Steve tiredly rubbed his face. “I guess. If he still wants to stay tomorrow, he can stay. If he wants to go, I'm not stopping him. The best you'll get out of me, Jan, so just let it go.”
He arrived at Steve’s place at 3, and waved to Clint before trotting up the stairs. Steve was standing in the hallway, arguing with the delivery man who was trying to drop off the fridge.
“Are you going to be ok with shifting?” Steve asked. Since their little spar, Tony hadn’t left human form, and Steve felt like that shift had been more of a fear response than a purposeful choice.
Steve walked over from where he had been leaning against the sink and put a hand on his shoulder. “You should have waited for us to get there.”
“Forget the plan, we fight now!” Rhodey yelled, and broke the shackles that they had spent days filing away. Pepper and the rest of the prisoners followed only a second behind and they all jumped on the guards, their strength in numbers making up for their lack of training. They tore the men away from the Captain, and forced them to the ground. Happy punched Vanko to the ground and Steve untied Tony, holding him up as he slumped.
He wanted this, he wanted Tony. Tony felt a laugh bubble up in his chest. Tony stroked his hand up and down Steve’s side, and Steve let him, because he wanted this. Amazing. He was trapped in a fucking death arena and Tony had never been so happy.
Remember his harsh from words for earlier, Tony edged around the truth. “I was a lord, but not of anything of importance.” He quickly changed the subject. “I saw you and your dragon many a time at the castle. She is magnificent.”
“Catapult maintenance. His royal highness suspects that the rebels are gathering in the mountains and wanted everything to be prepared in case of assault.”
“Please Sir, let us know what it is, I don’t think Tony’s heart could bear another moment of this suspense.” He looked up at Stern with puppy eyes, Tony's limp hand clasped between his own.
Tony lead the cart to the long shack where all of the miners slept. He looped and arm around the man’s shoulders and dragged him inside, laying him down on the bed next to Tony’s. He pulled his boots off, and laid the blanket over him. It would be best if Tony was here when he awoke, to offer him water and check how he was feeling, but the overseer watched from the doorway and Tony knew he would be expected to return to the mine. He dragged it out as long as he could, checking the Captain over for any other injuries, and using his rag to wipe off his hands and face. Others had survived worse, and as long as infection didn’t set in the Captain should make a full recovery. Under the grime he was a handsome man, with light hair and a strong jaw. Tony brushed a hand down his face, idly wondering what color his eyes might be. It felt odd to meet a legend up close, to see small bruises ruining the image of the untouchable victor. Tony wondered if he would live up to his reputation. It was a lot to live up to, between being the first to tame a wild dragon, to leading the charge in the battle of the keep, and commanding the troops to victory in the great war. Not to mention his years of loyal service in times of peace.
When Tony heard heavy footsteps in between the echoing thwacks of the pickaxes, he would urge Steve to his feet and shove a tool in his hand. Vanko stopped a few times during the day, watching suspiciously as Steve struggled to raise the pick high enough to get a decent strike. Once he moved on Steve would slide down the wall, face drenched in sweat and breathing roughly. Tony’s chest aches fiercely as he tried to work double time and cover up Steve’s lack of progress. All prisoners had to do their fair share, hurt or not. This was Vanko’s version of cutting them some slack, and if they weren’t going through enough rock for his satisfaction by the end of the next week there would be hell to pay.
At Steve’s blank look the man sighed. “Nobody ever responds to my letters.” He shook it off and was soon back to a model of polite professionalism. “All of the wolves who worked on the serum Stane had will need to be investigated and possibly put to trial, as well as the task force who murdered your pack. We’ll be in touch.”
Tony nodded and Steve stepped out of sight. Tony curled up as tightly as he could, and made sure his jacket was zipped up to the top. Steve came back a few minutes later, and half carried half dragged Tony to a sheltered space in a gully that was protected from the wind by a bush. Steve helped him get his backpack off and sorted through it, noting the jerky and rope but no blanket. He handed it back to Tony who clutched it to his chest, adding another layer between skin and air. Steve laid him down and curled around him, his back providing another barrier against the wind. He wrapped an arm around Tony’s stomach, below the bag. His arm was solid and warm.
Now he was invested in the skinny blond boy from 12. He pulled up the district 12 reaping ceremony. It wasn’t required watching for Capital citizens, so he hadn’t seen it. Nobody ever watch these, they were supposedly boring as hell. He was under the impression that they rounded up all the volunteers then did some sort of random drawing to pick who got the honor of going to the Capital and competing in the games. Tony would never volunteer for something like that, and couldn’t understand why the people from the districts would want to volunteer either. Fame? Fortune? There was a decent prize at the end, both for the contestant and their district. Maybe they just wanted an excuse to kill. Some of them were crazy enough.
“I’m rich and I felt like it, that’s all the reason I need. If you hang around me long enough these sorts of things happen. Why not take it? You need it and it’s not coming out of your pay.”
It cost a hell of a lot more than $900 but Tony knew this was one of those times he needed to keep his mouth shut.
“We must have forgotten or mismeasured something. Let’s go through the recipe until we figure out what we did wrong.”
Stern looked down at his papers, then at the wall, then back at them, shuffling things around and trying to make it look like he was doing something. “Hmph, well, uh, it looks like it will be…” he pretended to type some numbers into a calculator and while his head was down Tony stuck his tongue out t him and Steve stifled a snort. Stern looked up at them triumphantly, then plastered a fake look of sorrow on his face. “Oh no, this is just terrible, it really is!”
“It worked? Oh my god, it worked.” He scrambled to his feet and held out a hand. Steve cautiously shook it. Instead of letting go like a normal person, the man held on tightly.
A heavy hand came down on his shoulder and he turned. The Captain was standing beside him, frowning. “He was too unruly to make a good asset anyway. Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?”
“No it doesn’t, don’t be a baby. We need to keep him, and more importantly, we want to keep him.” declared Clint.
“Any further attempts to do this will result in swift and immediate retribution. May the odds be ever in your favor.” Hammer signed off, and the sky went dark.
Steve still couldn’t see himself marrying Tony. But friends? That didn’t sound so bad. That didn’t sound bad at all.
He never did get around to reading it, though he made a post about it for his Instagram. His publicist called him once a week to gush about how well it was doing, apparently giving the writers full royalties had resulted in some good stuff and the book was hanging around the bottom of a couple best seller lists. That meant he had to make a second one.
Tony sighed dramatically but agreed, and wiggled his way out of bed, holding his half full mug of coffee possessively. Steve grabbed the empty plate and followed him out the door. They walked downstairs and Steve put more eggs from the pan onto the plate for Tony, and got out a second plate for himself. They sat at the table with the rest of the pack, where Jan and Clint were close to done. Bucky was still pushing the eggs around his plate, not making progress as much as he was making piles. They wished him a good morning and Bucky returned it absentmindedly, staring at Steve with concern. He put down his fork with a loud clink.
Clint and Jan grabbed him and hoisted him up onto their shoulders. He let out a yelp and grabbed their shoulders for balance as they marched in a circle chanting “MVP! MVP! MVP!” Tony laughed, and struggled to hang on. He looked at Steve, his smile dimming and his eyes growing worried. Like he was going to yell at him or something? He gave him a reassuring smile and cupped his hands around his mouth to yell.
He got up from the table and Jan grabbed his arm, looking close to tears. “No! You can’t go! You can’t!” Clint and Steve quickly agreed.
“I'm going inside. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” He turned and opened the screen door. Bucky caught it with his hand.
“You are a leader in your own right. These people look to you for strength and healing, and you dispense it with a generous hand.”
About a week later, the Avengers were all hanging out in the kitchen eating breakfast. Steve was eating plate after plate of scrambled eggs. Sam, Clint and Natasha were eating the same, at a much more sedate pace, while Tony was standing by the counter drinking coffee almost as fast as Steve was shoveling down the eggs.
“If you paint this chair, I'm painting the rest purple. Admit it, you want to sit next to Steve,” he shot back, though he still got up and went to sit in his usual spot by Natasha. Tony plopped down smugly, careful not to spill his coffee.
The pizza arrived and the team settled at the table, new chairs being pulled up to fit more people as Scott and Sam and Carol joined everyone. Steve took his normal spot next to Tony and Tony rolled with it. Rhodey and Sam were debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza, Vision had a piece on his plate to be a good sport despite not having to eat, and Natasha was eating it with a fork because she was Russian and enjoyed how angry that made the rest of them for no rational reason. Things really were exactly like they used to be, plus a few new faces. Tony was even eating, and it was like pulling teeth to get him to eat anything besides his green shakes and the occasional cheeseburger. He claimed that he snacked and that was good enough, though a few handfuls of dried blueberries weren’t enough to make up for skipping meals in Steve’s opinion.
Rhodey knocked the dice out of his hand and dragged him away from the crowd. “We’re late, and President Stane will have both of our asses on a platter if you aren’t there and looking perfect when the cameras start rolling. Come on.”
Plus he didn't want to think what trouble Tony would get up to if he thought he was being ignored. The very thought made Steve shiver. Clint didn't seem to care.
How many victors had lashed out against anyone that came close, Tony wondered, their minds ground away by the arena until everyone and everything appeared to be a threat?
Obie sighed. “Tony, Tony, Tony. You were happier when you were ignorant, I was doing you the same service given to all the Capital citizens. They all want to laze about and have their parties and drinks and fun, and they don’t want to think about what’s going on in the districts. What’s the old folk saying? No one wants to see how sausages are made? Don’t be so naive.”
The things he had designed were never meant to be used like this, they were supposed to go on the borders to keep everyone safe from the mutated animals that roamed the wilds. Using his weapons to blow up innocents went against everything he stood for, and everything the games were supposed to stand for. The games were meant to show that when they were left alone, the people of the districts would tear each other apart. Instead, five of them had formed a loyal group and called themselves the Avengers, and welcomed Tony in to it. They had shared their food and protected each other and stood together even when they could have run. Meanwhile the Capital had used underhand traps, and sent in peacekeepers to hurt them when they didn’t follow the Capital’s rules. It made Tony think that maybe the Capital wasn’t the beacon of moral purity that he had always assumed. Seeing how the people of the districts reacted to computers and medicine made him realize that what they told him in the mandatory loyalty training was very different from reality. They were lying to him, and the rot ran deep.
Sometimes that meant taking a break to enjoy one of the popsicles they had bought on their supermarket trip, eating them outside on the porch as crickets chirped a peaceful melody, their conversations loose and meandering as the cows that grazed their fields. Sometimes it meant Steve would turn his drawing pad around, and they would play hangman, arguing over if ‘y’all’ was really a word, because honestly Tony, if you got to do antidisestablishmentarianism, he should be able to do freaking ‘y’all’.
Tony was back in the Capital in less than an hour and forced into the hands of the stylists to make him presentable for the cameras. They gave him several of the healing pills and he felt the last vestiges of damage fading away like they had never existed. They shaved off his scruffy four day beard, and styled his hair back in neat waves. They put him in a black suit, with a black shirt and tie. No more tacky baby blue.
That left option three, which was the option that made the most sense. He would call Pepper and harass her to go through his desk until she found the second book deal, find the name of the writer who did the Brooklyn articles, then Tony would give him a call and have him personally show him all the sights. Then he could meet up with Christine and wow her into bed. It was the perfect plan.
“Maintenance? Nobody is allowed to touch those planes without express order from the king and while supervised by the chief engineer! Let me in this instant!”
It was too late to go that night, and the next day they had to wait until all the cows had been milked, and the milk and eggs had been dropped off in town. It was huge pain living in the middle of nowhere, since it was a 45 minute ride to town, then a 45 minute ride back to the ranch, then Stark Industries was a hour long drive the opposite direction.  Steve ended up going to town alone to drop off the stuff at the supermarket and houses, then the whole pack piled in to go to Stark Industries. Jan and Clint were still pissed at Steve, and two people had to sit in the back which was uncomfortable and made the ride feel longer. Jan won rock paper scissors, and used her time up front to glare at Steve for the full hour. By the end of the ride he was gritting his teeth and the tension was getting unbearable. Steve pulled the truck into a spot in front of Stark Industries, and turned off the engine. Tony hopped out of the back, and trotted to the front door. He swiped a card, and disappeared inside, leaving Steve alone with his pack mates. He got out of the car and turned to them with a sigh. They had got out of the truck and were standing next to each other, arms crossed. Sometimes it was very obvious the two of them were siblings. Steve brushed a hand through his hair. The responsible leader side of him was saying to apologize, and the angry twenty one year old werewolf was saying Clint needed to not be such a wimp and that he was still mad about the math mistake and they should duke it out as wolves. Responsible adult Steve was needed here, unfortunately.
Tony was pounding ineffectively at the bird’s leg when it disappeared with a mournful wail. Tony had no time to celebrate before he realized that he was plummeting towards the ground. He kicked on the suit's rupulsors, and after a half second the lights in his hands flickered out. Then his boot jet went out too. Tony wasn’t surprised, it was just one of those days. He tried to stay in the air, but with only one boot and no hands he wasn't able to stabilize himself and was falling faster and faster.
The birds began flying closer, the circle of free space shrinking, forcing Cap to step closer to the villain and Captain Britain, who laid beside him with the gun aimed at his head.
Tony took his hand, and Steve pulled him down so they were both lying down facing the same way on the bed. He wrapped an arm around Tony, careful not to get too high on his chest.
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, and shut the oven door. Tony put another ten minutes on the timer and they sat at the counter.
During his rounds a thought had occurred to him, and he asked Steve. “Will your fellow riders be looking for you?”
“Please no,” Sam moaned. “We all remember the last time Tony cooked, calling it burned is generous. I think there was more shell than egg.”
The peacekeepers rushed the stage and grabbed him as he lunged for Tony. They dragged him off as he screamed and cursed, cutting off as a peacekeeper hit him in the head with the barrel of his gun. The boy went limp, and they dragged him backstage. The door swung shut with a click, audible in the silence of the empty auditorium.
The problem was that Steve didn’t know of his plans, and was currently doing his best to win him over. He greeted him cheerily every day, and offered him the first portion of breakfast oats from the pot. He would hand him flowers from the path, and any ripe berries. At night he would set up his blankets beside Tony’s. Tony refused all of his affections, but Steve was not dissuaded.
Tony snorted as Steve walked forward. He was trying to look nonaggressive while wearing full tactical gear and holding his shield, and it wasn’t working. Tony felt like half the time Steve still through of himself as a 5’4” shrimp, and not the six foot muscle bound lummox he was now.
Tony never could resist a challenge, Steve thought to himself warmly. Tony stood up and Steve clapped a hand over his eyes. “Jesus, Tony, you’re still naked.”
Natasha glared at him from across the jet. “Well, maybe second best.” He amended hastily. “Definitely best archer though.”
“I’m not going to play your little games!” The blond kid yelled, so worked up he was almost spitting. “I’m not going to sit here like a lamb for the slaughter and pretend that this is all ok! This is wrong and you should all be ashamed of yourselves! Our lives are not a game!”
They broke apart to see Sam standing in the doorway with his arms crossed. “Do I need to leave again? The rest of the team is getting impatient.”
Tony kept posting pictures, partially because he thought it was funny that his publicist flipped out over every tiny thing (clearly he was joking about the cocaine), and partially because it was fun. He’d post pictures on his jet, of his hotel rooms, of local monuments. He had to travel for work so much that he was never out of new locations to take pictures of. Pepper quickly came around to the idea, happy that Tony was outside getting some fresh air and taking pictures rather than causing a ruckus at the hotel bar. She also used it as a way to make sure he actually made it on the flights he said he was going to catch.
“I’m nothing like you,” Tony insisted. “I made Game Master at 18! The President is practically my dad! I’m going great places, I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.”
Still facing the wall, Steve continued his instructions. “Ok, now focus on your sense of smell. What can you figure out about my room?”
“And that’s the problem, because I like you very much. More than I should.” Steve spoke so softly and earnestly, and Tony could hardly bear it.
“Shut up, I'm being your wing man!” He hissed back, before switching back to his overly loud voice, drowning out Steve as he desperate pleaded that he really, for sure, definitely did not want a wing man, or even to try to flirt any more. Clint was not dissuaded.
“I’m not letting you leave, I’m coming with you,” Tony promised. “We’ll all die, let’s see what the Capital thinks of that.”
Steve put his hand on his earpiece. “I've located the hostile, last room in the basement.” His team acknowledged and raced to join him. Maxwell tried to escape from the room but Cap blocked the door. He retreated back, and grabbed the smaller man around the neck. “Let me out of here or he dies,” growled the cornered villain.
Tony cautiously sat in the chair meant for guests, and Obie blew a thin stream of smoke from between his lips, tapping his cigar on the tray on his desk. Tony hated that the smell reminded him of solid hugs and a comforting supporting presence.
Obie was going to answer for all of this. Tony could no longer pretend that this was all some mistake; the evidence had piled up too high. As President, Obie would have known the truth of the games and their needless cruelty and misused weapons, the truth about the people from the districts and how they were suffering, and truth about Tony. He hadn’t been a traitor, but he had been too close to uncovering things Obie wanted him to stay ignorant of.
“What are you going to say to him?” Sam asked, leaning against the side of the jet. Steve put a box in the cargo space, and tightened the straps to hold it in place. It was already filled with all the supplies that the Rogue Avengers would need for their mission back to the US to work out the terms for their return. The boxes included clothes, paperwork, gifts, and absolutely no weapons. He had already found several knives that Natasha had hidden away and returned them to her with a disapproving look. They were on thin ice, and lucky that the US government was opening up negotiations at all. No need to push them on any of their terms, at least not so early and something as reasonable as ‘no weapons will be present at the meetings’.
Steve saw red for a second and had to take several breaths to calm himself down. He unclenched his fists and flattened them on his legs. Bucky thought he was being nice, he thought he was being generous, he didn't see it as stealing away yet another one of Steve’s crushes. Except this wasn't a crush, this was Tony, his fiery, impossible, Tony. If he laid a finger near him Steve was going to turn into a wolf and bite it off. He kept his voice even, though his displeasure still bled through.
Two more peacekeepers guarded the exit and Tony walked past them like he had every right to be there, and in his Capital clothes with his snooty Capital attitude, they didn’t question him.
“And your skills will bring the rest home. Do not mourn for me, because now I go to rejoin my family.”
They both trailed off, and Tony tried to process what Bruce had said. That was already what happened? Bruce hadn’t volunteered?
“Did we really forget the first ingredient? The ingredient that makes up the majority of the muffin?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged.
“They’re gone. He has an aunt and he says she’s supportive of it, as long as it doesn’t affect his school work or get him into any situation he can’t get out of. I made him a kevlar version of his spider suit and put something in there to alert me if he’s in trouble so he’s safer now than he was before.”
“Stark Industries still has a few old ties to the military, and my friend Rhodey has some pull too… He’s back the whole week.”
“I don’t care what you do in your free time. It’s your life.” Steve forced out, the lie feeling bitter on his tongue. Tony called him out on it.
“Nearest vet?” He asked the people walking down the sidewalk. Most ignored him, but an old lady took pity and pointed down the street.
“Just a clumsy sort of day,” Steve said, rolling a few of the remaining unpopped kernels around in his hand. He dropped them back in the bowl and put it on the table with exaggerated gentleness and smiled when Tony laughed. He leaned back and let himself relax. “I’m glad you’re here, I thought you were mad at me.”
Tony nodded and left the office with a quick goodbye. Tony felt his shoulders hunch up to his ears as the guard followed a step behind him. God, this was embarrassing. He should have known that the people from the districts were lying to him. It made much more sense than the whole Capital and Obie himself being the one’s in the wrong. Obie had always been the one person he could trust completely, the one he could turn to when his own father didn’t have time for him. And after his parents death’s Obie had been the one by his side, offering a guiding hand. If he couldn’t trust Obie then he couldn’t trust anyone.
“As long as there’s no violence or screaming it’s ok. The bar for you two is at rock bottom right now. ”
Tony laid down on the hard ground and closed his eyes. Now what was he supposed to do? Sit in this cave until the other tributes killed each other? Tony wasn’t going to try to kill anyone, and he didn’t intend to die either. Could he even win the games, since he was here as a punishment instead of as a district tribute? Or would they wait until he was the only one left and shoot him where he was standing? That assumed that he would make it to the end, and not be found and snuffed out by a tribute, which is what was looking like his most likely end.
“All you two do is scream at each other and the whole building would have heard that. We heard you two yelling in your room yesterday.”
“We’re all bad at math! You lost the coin flip so it was your job to do it! You needed to step up! I’ve stepped up to role of pack Alpha, I’ve stepped up to running the ranch, I negotiated a deal with Stane and lord knows how bad I am at diplomacy! If I could get enough money to cover our bills negotiating with a born and bred businessman with absolutely nothing to negotiate with, the least you could do is figure out how much I was supposed to negotiate for! You failed! You failed this family and now were going to lose everything!”
Tony lunged forward and knocked the first man’s sword out of his hand, leaning back to avoid the swipe of the other man’s weapon. Tony crouched down and swept out a foot, taking down the second man. He bashed the other guy in the head with his frying pan and ran out the door. He needed to make it to his forge, where he had swords and crossbows and everything else Thor’s loyal men would need to fight back against the traitors.
“Thanks, but I think you guys already took care of the crazy guy. I don’t need an escort, I’ll just take my own car.”
It felt incredibly fake next to the handheld footage shot from someone in the crowd. He went back to the first video and got a notice that it had been taken down. He switched back to the train video, watching it again with a frown. It felt even faker and more disjointed the second time.
Their meal was interrupted by the Avengers’ alert. Steve's instincts kicked in and he was on his feet in less than a second. Friday started rattling off the details.
Mostly it seemed to be weight lifting. Lots and lots of weight lifting. They picked something heavy up. They put it back down. Boring. No wonder this wasn’t televised, no one would watch it, mandatory or not.
“It sure is. And you know what else? I made out with Captain America on the couch. I didn’t let him do dishes. Steve, you’re going to have to kick me out of the country. I’ll go be Canadian, and live wild among the moose.”
Tony’s mind immediately went into the gutter. It took a huge force of will to keep himself from asking Steve if he would let Tony get to second base. Stupid baseball metaphors. He cleared his throat. “I think that’s as good as I’m going to get when it comes to baseball.”
“You bought me a $900 refrigerator because you were concerned that i didn't get leftovers last time? That’s not a good enough reason!”
Later that night Steve found himself back on the base. He still felt too guilty over the Commandos to celebrate the victory as raucously as the others. He walked to his quarters, where he found a tall man sitting against his door with his head in his hands.
They reached the door, and Steve handed Tony the check back. “You should be the one to give it to the bank, you’re the one who earned it.”
“You say that every time, and the list keeps shrinking.” Tony said fondly and huffed out a breath. He kept his eyes facing forward and said, “I love you, how about that?”
Smoke filled the air and Tony covered his mouth with his shirt, wetted with river water where it lapped against the entrance of the small cave.
“Decent???” Steve shrieked. “That’s more than Beyonce! How do you have more followers than Beyonce? She’s the most famous singer of our generation and you run a small technology company and spend your free time buying refrigerators for strangers.”
Pepper was less forgiving. “We have no supplies to carry us through the long journey. Vanko sends the same man to the closest village every time, if we try to go ourselves they will report us to the many guards who haunt the towns on Loki’s behalf.”
“Sir, There’s been reports of a disturbance on 19th street.” Jarvis said, interrupting the loud music.
Bucky grabbed Steve’s arm. “It was a trap, it was all a trap. Stane has been behind everything. The pack I met? They work for Stane, they killed our pack, and they were camped out to finish the job after the wedding.”
Bucky looked at him, horrified. He grabbed his arm and hissed, “I can't believe you did that! What were you thinking? This isn't the early 1800s, packs don't do arranged marriages anymore!”
When they got back they slipped in the way they came out. The cart was missing from the line, and there would be interrogations and possibly beatings tomorrow if the overseer noticed. It couldn’t be helped, it was too heavy to be pushed, especially with Steve. Tony laid Steve down and checked his bandages. Blood darkened the white, indicating that he had popped the stitches. Tony would have to redo them tomorrow when it was light. For now he wrapped another layer of bandages and let him doze off. Tony collapsed on his own bed and tried to get as much sleep as he could before the work bell rang the next morning. Instead his thoughts were plagued with innocents dying and Loki laughing maniacally, waving a sword above his head. Steve appeared, and ran his sword through him, and Loki fell with a gasp as Tony cheered. Then Steve approached, his eyes cold. "You're next."
Sam pushed his bowl away. “Outside the city, we all got in the jet and he stayed behind,” said Falcon, and the others nodded their heads.
“We need a loan. An alliance. And, ideally, more wolves.” Stane's eyebrows drew together as he laid it all out on the table. The older man casually flicked a bit of ash off his cigar, and Steve watched as it hit the tray.
Tony sighed in frustration. Why was he being so stubborn about this? If this was like the time he bought Rhodey a sports car, he wasn't going to be able to change his mind. Whatever, if Steve didn’t want it he knew someone who would. He snapped his fingers at the delivery man. “You, follow me. I’m changing the address on my delivery.”
“Thank you, my friends. I am glad to see that you have made up.” He pulled back. “I only hope that I may do the same with Loki. He waits in prison for now, along with his remaining guards. The mercenaries he hired have all fled and the kingdom is ours once more. Come! Let us celebrate!”
Steve lived in a dull grey apartment complex on the non hipster side of the Brooklyn borough. The street smelled like sauerkraut and muddy water, and Tony stepped over garbage lying in the street with a grimace. How could a guy who lived here know where the good places were? This guy’s idea of fine dining was probably McDonalds.
It all started a few years ago when Tony made an Instagram. He had met a hot girl at a party, she had told him to follow her Instagram, saying anyone who was anyone had one these days. Tony was game, and so he downloaded the app and made an account. He followed the girl, and everyone else at the party, setting him up with thirty followers and thirty people to follow. His profile picture was him drunk as hell making a peace sign in the flashing lights of the private club. He forgot about it the next day, until the end of the week when he was in a taxi for the long drive to the airport and had nothing better to do. So, he pulled out his phone to see what exactly this Instagram things was. As he scrolled he got an interesting mix. Some people posted food, some parties, some pets, some traveling. Hey, he was traveling. As he stepped out of the taxi and onto the airstrip, he took a picture next to the jet and posted it on a whim, with no captions. He shut off his phone for take off, and settled in to do some paperwork. Pepper was going to be so happy with him for finishing up the contract for her.
He pushed Ned on the the backseat and put his seat belt on. The kid's head lolled against the window and he fell asleep again, nose scrunched up on the window.
At the end of the conversation, Tony had said that he had a ton of work anyway so Steve could stay in the house with Peter and he'll use the penthouse like he used to. Tony had ended up sleeping in the workshop, unable to bare the memory of their first nights in the appartement. Not that he had slept a lot anyway.
He felt the soldier refrain himself from asking more questions. He owed him some answers, didn't he?
Tony got out of the room to get a bucket and a bottle of water. He brushed against Steve on his way to the kitchen. The man grabbed his arm, just hard enough to stop him.
He drove away, purposefully ignoring Peter's glares in the mirror. In a few minutes they arrived at Steve's house. The man was waiting for them at the door, apparently unbothered by the ice cold air in just sweatpants and a t-shirt that wa s a size or two too small, and now was not the time to think about Steve's too tight shirt. Tony parked roughly and got out of the car, still fuming despite his best efforts to calm himself. He opened Ned's door and helped the kid to his feet, visibly swaying and unhappy to not be sleeping. He nodded to Steve as he passed the door.
All of this had stopped when he and Steve had decided to really give a try to something more serious. And it had worked. They had married 8 months later, they had enjoyed their honeymoon, he had got sober, they had adopted.
"You want to watch something? Or we can try to go back to bed," Steve whispered in Tony's hair when the sobs subdued.
"I don't know. He thought it was a girl thong and he didn't think girls were as good as boys," (despite the hundreds of times Peggy proved him wrong.) "or something like that."
Steve is next to him, on the opposite chair now. (how does he move so fast?) He approaches his fingers until they're almost touching the glass, and when Tony doesn't react he takes the glass and the bottle away.
Tony shrugged. Why what? Why was he on the verge of a panic attack when he heard the love his life? Why did he try to drink himself to death? Why did he abondonned his son? His friends? Why was he still alive?
He hadn't gone to the board meeting, nor did he to the aa one. He had locked the workshop down, had opened his hidden cabinet near the tool table and popped a few pills with his scotch. The project due to the next day was slowly taking form, not near as far as it would usually go.
It felt like everything was falling apart. Like one wrong move would send his somewhat normal life into oblivion (stop being dramatic, Stark, come on. Stark men don't cry, right?). He couldn't tell how long he stayed like this, trying to contain tears and shivers that didn't care about what he wanted. He couldn't have Steve see him like this, could he?
Tony locked his legs behind Steve and brought him closer. He put his arms aroud his neck and played with the short hair at the back. God he'd missed this. He sighted happily as Steve kissed him, deep and slow.
Tony wasn't too sure of what was happening but Steve had mentioned coffee. He pushed himself up until he was on his knees and Steve slipped out of the covers. The curtains were open and the room was already filled with sunlight.
He breathed heavily, trying to concentrate on his friend's voice, trying to ignore the steps getting farther every second, the door knob clicking, the door shutting down.
Tony was starting to doze off when he heard Steve's breathing changing, and shuffling under the cover.
"You're aspirering to be the drunkard who drops out in his first semester?" he quoted."Projecting a bit? I know it's a sensible subject but Peter is not you. He has a support system, friends, we're not gonna drop him in the wild and watch as things go to shit."
He took the phone and found the contact. He called, and waited several rings before Mr. Leeds answered. Steve explain the situation, in a calm voice that made even Tony relax the tiniest bit.
He kept his eyes closed. He didn't want to deal with anything, or anyone. He heard steps getting closer, going to his left.
Peter's mouth twisted when he understood who Tony was talking to, and started to violently shake his head and whispering pleads to his dad, hands coming together like if he was praying. Tony pointed his thumb at the back of the car, and with one sharp flick of his wrist, Peter was dragging himself to the other side of the car and slammed the door shut behind him.
After a long shower, he put the undersuit and Steve's suit in the workshop, and told JARVIS to remind him to take care of it.
Tony would have sworn he was good at hiding how tired he really was. Steve must have read his mind because he chuckled.
"What?!" Steve suddenly sounded very awake. Tony heard shuffles and curses on the other hand of the line before Steve came back loud and clear. "At Ned's?"
He stood and the whole room started to spin. His stomach followed. Tony fell. He heard himself throw up. Everything went black.
It was very Steve to be sure of something with the kind of certainty that convinced other people, that could even comvince Tony if he let it.
His own voice and his frustration were raising. Sure, he hadn't exactly thought before smashing in the alien, but however he looked at the situation, there wasn't a lot of different outcomes. Steve got hurt, or he did, and there wasn't one universe where he would let Steve get hurt.
All Tony could think of was the pain raising on his chest. Not that he would die and Steve would discover on his dead body the arc reactor, that he would find out that his armored best friend had lied to him for years, that he would finally reach peak disappointment, because let's face it, no one wanted to be bestie with a war profiter. He was definitely not thinking about that.
"It's not fine! You keep doing this. You dive in without thinking and you put yourself in danger over and over again!"
It took Tony a good second to get where the question came from, and then looked down at his shirt, as to make sure it was what Steve was talking about.
" You're not home anymore. There's that girl at school. It happened to her parents. And at some point they asked her who she wanted to live with. "a silence." but I don't want to chose. I can't. "
Tony was struggling to think and didn't want to talk to the most important being in his life while inebriated.
Some people were outside of the house, mostly smokers, given the low temperatures, that didn't seem to either recognize him or care that a 50 years old man sneaked in a highschool party. He got inside the packed house, the noise and the music ringing his hears. He pushed through the crowd, none of the kids were much older than Peter. He entered what had to be the living room. A kid tripped on his feet and bumped in Tony, half of his beer landing on Tony's shirt. The day couldn't get any better. He cursed more that he should in front of highschoolers. The kid stumbled forwards and Tony held him up and started swimming through the people again. He spotted a flight of stairs, the lower half invaded by the kids, and climbed upstairs.
"No, a kid dropped his beer on me. By the way, I'll steal one of your shirt to go home," he added as he walked away from his husba- ex-husband. God he was tired.
"It's okay to cry, honey. If you need it or if you feel like it..." (the hypocrisy is huge here.) He pushed the thought aside. "My father had outdated views on a lot of things and he didn't think crying was an okay thing to do. And I just..." (internalised it, because no one can know how fucked up you are, or they'll sell it to people magazines or use it against you and you'll have to admit that Howard was right.) "I started to believe him."
Steve's arms tensed, and pushed against the arc reactor, Tony wished that the coat was thick enough.
Those damn tears wouldn't stop. Peter's hand, covered by the long black sleeves, came on Tony's knee. He looked up to him, his big brown eyes behind blond curls.
Because there was no way he could take care of a child on his own, because Steve had been the one who had taken care of Peter-and him at his worst-, because it wouldn't be fair to anyone if he was to keep Peter. The empty glass on his desk mocked him.
His gut twisted. Peter. How could he have done that to his kid? What his drunk self had thinking came back to him. Worse than Howard, worse than the worst. James must have noticed, maybe guessed what he was thinking, because he put a hand on his friend's shoulder.
"I can't remove it," he lied. He didn't know if he could take it off, he never tried. "It doesn't have to mean anything."
Peter made an 'ok' gesture with his right hand instead of screaming back, and was shallowed whole by the dancing crowd a second later. As he got closer to the door, the kids got sparce, until he could actually walk without elbowing his way forward.
He wasn't sure himself. He had tried to work. To distract himself from something. He didn't remember what.
Tony winced. He hoped Ned wouldn't blame Peter for any of the night's events. He squeezed his folded clothes a bit tighter.
"It's just…" He took a deep breath, trying to order his thoughts. "When he called I got so scared something had happen, and then the kid with the beer-"
But now, he cherishes the time he has with Steve (because he's sure it's limited and there's going to be a day where Steve wakes up and realises what a gigantic mistake this relationship was), and waking up next to him is one of his favourite things to do. Since the insomnies started, he feels like he's kept out of those moments that should be his. Left out of the good things, of the intimacy he should have with his boyfriend.
He wanted to cuddle? That wasn't dumb. But he could see the arc reactor, or worse, feel it. On the other hand, Tony was dying, and dying in Steve's arms wouldn't be that bad.
Peter's blond hair appeared next to him, the boy drowning in a too big Black Widow sweater, a crease of worry between his young eyes (you put it there, you idiot.)
"Just, let me finish. So, I'm back at the dorms, another party rolls around, and now I know how to not end up in the hospital. Every weekend, there's something. Someone's birthday, a day off, celebrating the end of the semester… And then winter break during my last year, they tell me…" he swallowed against the lump in his throat, and met Steve's encouraging eyes. "They tell me my parents had an accident, and they need me to identify the corpses. I show up, drunk off my ass, I couldn't even tell you what happened or the face of the cop. I drink for a week straight, until the funerals. I show up late, a bottle of whiskey in hand, everyone tell me what a good man my father was, how sorry they are. Obie tells me that I can drink today, apparently, it's socially allowed. Rhodey drives me to the hospital at 4 in the afternoon."
He found Peter in the second room, sat next to the bed where Ned had crashed on top of way too many coats. Peter was clenching an empty glass and chewing on his sleeve when he saw Tony.
6224 days to be precise, not that he was counting or anything. He should be proud, and he was, on better days. But saying it to Peter had an awful bitterness to it.
He led him the kid to Peter's room and sat him on the bed. He removed his shoes and jacket. Ned didn't resist one bit when he gave him a push to the shoulder to lay him down.
His free hand circled Tony's waist, and found its way under Tony's shirt. Steve trailed kisses on his neck, excruciatingly slow. Tony wanted to turn around but he couldn't, his hands deep on the soapy water, and he knew Steve was taking advantage of this. He peeled himself off of Tony a second to find a tea towel and dried his hand up before circling Tony's waist once again. He started off where he'd left, his mouth finding its way along Tony's neck and shoulder.
The teen was resolute on winning his starring match against the cereals and didn't acknowledge Tony. Tony took a deep breath to prepare himself to say what he had to say.
He couldn't remember the last time he slept so well. He woke up to someone gently stroking the back of his head, and it took him ridiculously long to realize that it wasn't normal. He peeled  his eyes open and foud Steve's shirt pressed against his cheek, or the other way around.
He moved and rolled around in the bed until he gave up on trying to sleep half an hour later. He got up and opened slowly the door.
Friday told him that it was 6 am and that he should get prepared for the meeting he will attend to 2 hours later. It was the second day in a row that he hadn't slept. The great Tony Stark wasn't used to stay up that long anymore.
He walked away from the frame, remembering that he was here to sleep. He lied down under the covers, Steve's smell engulfing him. It felt like a dream. The unfamiliar darkness around him clashed with the comfort of being burried under Steve's things, in Steve's room, In Steve's home, like coming back to your childhood bedroom now turned into an office.
"I need space," Steve said, their bedroom door slamming behind him before Tony could register his words.
Tony took a step back, taken aback by the sudden change of ton. Steve noticed too, because he paused and took a deep, shaky breath.
"Thor, go help Black widow with the cleaning team, and tell the medics to stay. Tony needs a check-up," the captain said.
The room was clean and ordered. Nothing was out of place. Even the frames on the dresser were perfectly angled. 5 years old Peter looked at him with a giant smile and a big teddy bear tucked in his arms. Tony was surprised to find their wedding photo on the wall. The one in front of a giant wedding cake, Steve holding a plate with a piece and a spoon full of whiped cream colliding with Tony's nose. Tony held his breath as he got closer. Steve hadn't change much in two decades. A little wrikle here and there around his eyes, his frekles had darkened slightly where the sun hit the most and, if you looked closely, a few lighter streak of hair on his temples. Tony rarely felt his age as much as he did now, watching his younger self's mock indignation at the wiped cream.
Tony used to be there when Peter had nightmare, or when he couldn't sleep. He used to be there. And sober.
Peter mumbled an apology in his cereals an excused himself after he finished, saying he'd check if Ned was still alive.
His voice is thick with sleep and on the verge of panic. He must have woken up from a nightmare, Tony thinks. Steve immediately appears in the doorframe, hair tousled and t-shirt crumpled. His face goes from anxious to relieved to completely blank in a matter of seconds. It's only then, when Steve's eyes fix the almost empty bottle in the kitchen that it occurs to Tony that it can't be a good look.
It was even worse. He was his father. Of course he loved him. He had loved Howard, at some point. He had tried so much to impress him, to be good enough for his old man.
He grabbed Peter and lifted him on his lap. He pushed the curls aside. What he did to get such a good kid, he didn't know. He didn't know either how he didn't fuck it up yet. He took a deep breath, putting his thoughts in order, and trying to ignore his wet cheeks.
There were something she wanted to say, but she pressed her lips together in a thin line. She exchanged a look with James.
"No," he sighted, feeling somewhat relieved to find that it was the truth. He couldn't be. "Your Pa was in a tight spot this afternoon, " this part hadn't made in the pg-13 retelling of the afternoon, "and I got scared and did something a bit dumb."
Tony wanted to go back to sleep. He would ask where he was or why his friend had traveled through the ocean latter. He closed his eyes, slowly drifting away.
That voice. That damn voice that made his heart clench every time he heard it. That voice that drove him to tears.
Tony jumped when his phone rang in the silent workshop. His eyes drifted to the clock on the corner of the screen. 1 a.m. He rolled his chair to the console and picked up the phone without looking at the caller's contact.
He had been abducted with Steve and put in a giant fridge. One or two degrees below freezing, if his internal thermometer was right. The edges of the arc reactor were burning him and the light jacket he was wearing wasn't doing much. They had tried to force the huge door, but even the super soldier's strength hasn't been enough to open it. Iron man could have cracked it, with one or two reactor blasts. Tony stark was, on the other hand, useless.
Maybe he was sounding like a dickhead. Like the worst father in history. Maybe even worse than Howard. That was something. But then again, was he so different in the end?
Steve's voice was a whisper, shaky and unsure. It felt like he was trying to convince himself more than Tony.
He had tried. He had tried so hard. But that was expecting too much of him. The glass of scotch was mocking him from his desk. He had throw 6 years of soberty away when Steve had told him he wanted a divorce. He was too busy to care, too miserable to try again. He finished his drink.
"Give me your phone," he said in a tone that didn't leave room for argument. Steve had that military way of dealing with Peter, or anything, really.
He froze. Lack of sleep had never made him erase entire days from his memory before. Alcohol had. She left to reach the door, when her hand touched the doorknob, he called her.
"She's right, but being scared for someone else makes me a bit reckless." (a lot, even.) "And I gave Steve quite a scare." He stroke Peter's cheek, the boy was already drifting to sleep. "I'm sorry you heard that," he whispered.
It wasn't a concious decision, not really. He saw the giant alien move behind Steve and the armor was diving in before he really thought about it. Tony collided with the alien's armor at a speed he didn't want to think about, shoulder first in the thing's flank. He saw a flash of Steve's face before they crashed into the bridge's fence.
Tony felt a headache blooming behind his eyes, from stress or fatigue, he wasn't sure. He walked up and down the long of the car, trying to calm himself and not explode at his son when he'd come out. It was nearing 2 am, his eyes closed themselves at regular intervals, he definitely wasn't in shape to drive back to the city. He would have, if there wasn't two teenagers with him. He fetched his phone from the glovebox and searched for Steve's contact. Tony knew that at this time of the night he was probably asleep.
"My point is, I'm never going to be okay with you drinking. I know it's not entirely rationnal, I know that drinking a beer once in a while will not cause problem but I can't help it. And when you called last night I thought- I thought you were walking in my shitty footsteps and I freaked out, but I'm glad you called, and that you trusted me enough to call. And I'm sorry I reacted that way, it wasn't... I shouldn't have."
He guided the kids out if the room and then downstairs. The music was awfully loud and Tony wasn't sure if he was reacting like an old man or if it was justified. In his day it wasn't like that, and the music was actually good. He cringed inside when he realized Howard had had the same reaction to his fourteenth birthday, the last he celebrated at home.
At some point, someone appeared in his workshop. It was Steve. The last person he wanted to see. To talk to. To think about. Steve noticed the untouched box. He asked. Tony didn't answer. He was craving for a bottle of scotch.
There was an awkward silent after he left, Steve sipped his tea and ate his toast like he'd done the last 45 years, his cheeks getting slightly redder as the silence stretched on. Tony knew he should leave and forget about last night's... Thing that happened. It was the best for his dumb heart.
" Hey we're not... We won't ask you to choose,sweetie. Pops and dad,... It doesn't work very well anymore. But we'll never ask you to choose. We still love you. You're our precious little bean, Pete. "
She was back on business mode, giving her boss a file full of - he could already tell - boring work.
Steve's voice is softer now, his hand gently rubbing Tony's. He doesn't know if it's better that getting the cold shoulder treatment.
With difficulty, Tony moved his legs to close the leather jacket and once he made sure the arc reactor couldn't be seen he turned to thank the soldier. He was now wearing a blue shirt on top of a white tee.
"Yeah, you always have an excuse. You just graduated? You're gonna throw a party. Long day? you drink because you deserve it. You're bored ? You drink to make something happen. You drank too much the night before? You drink to make the headache pass. Before you know it you're throwing back a glass of whiskey at 9 am because you need it to concentrate, to stop the shaking. You need it to stop the headaches, to sleep, to function. You're stuck on a project? You drink to have some creativity."
"I mean. I was still drinking when we got together. When we married. The three fist years it was Steve, me and a bottle."
"An alcoholic? It's... Do you know what it's like not have control over your life? I kept this cabinet full to prove myself that I could have control over this. Everytime I saw it, I took the decision not to open it. It was my call, James. I got to chose. I made the call. And it worked. "
The sweatpants were unexpectedly too big for him and hung on low on his hips. He was drowning in Steve's clothes and allowed himself to burry his face in it for a second. He was so tired.
Tony jumped, not expecting anyone to walk on him like this, especially not his son. He tried to wipe the tears away, but they didn't stop.
Thor put him down and in an instant Tony was throwing up the disgusting water. He was still coughing when Steve jogged to them, shield and uniform covered by alien blood and dust. He squatted down next to Tony, rubbed circles on his back until he  could breath normally again.
He jumped in the car the closest to the garage door and sped through the city, following Friday's indications.
Steve's hand raised in the air. Before he could think better of it, Tony ducked his head like an afraid cat.
"The press heard about your hospitalisation. So as far as they're concerned, you overworked yourself."
He considers lying, saying it's a one time thing and brush it off as just Tony being Tony. Steve has that little crease between his brows, almost all the way up to his hairline. He makes the same face when Tony take hits during missions.
There was some more curses and shuffle before they hung up. The cold and the beer-soaked shirt made the whole ordeal just a little bit worse. Tony took a second to breath the cold air and regain his composure before sliding behind the wheel.
Steve munched on his toast, with all the normalcy in the world, as if the hours of arguments and screaming hadn't happened between them. As if there wasn't divorce papers burried in one of the drawers of Tony's desk.
Steve pushed Tony towards his bedroom door, and took a blanket from the closet before disappearing in the living room.
He propped himself on his elbows, his back gently telling him that the sofa hadn't been the brightest idea he'd ever had.
Steve raised his arm in an invitation, and Tony just stared, not quite sure what was happening. Steve hadn't even open his eyes, but he waited.
Steve tightened his grip and planted a kiss on the crown of his head. Tony didn't know why his throat closed off like that, a wave of nostalgia taking over him. He raised his head towards Steve and their lips met. He froze then. What was he thinking?
It still feels like a half truth. He had trouble sleeping all his life, but usually it was his fault. He was the one staying up, eyes glued to screens and schematics. He was the one to go the clubs and parties. He was the one to avoid his bedroom for days for fear of nasty nightmares.
Water was sipping inside the suit, from the leg the alien had destroyed, and all the little gaps Tony hadn't thought to render waterproof. Water was awfully close to the arc reactor, JARVIS told him.
He pulled up the covers to Peter's shoulders for the second time today and made sure that mister Hulk was right next to him.
Tony took several seconds to process who was talking and what was the question about, then several others to ponder his answer.
Tony pushed himself on his feet, made sure the way too big sweatpants hadn't rolled down and started to the kitchen. He welcomed the cup of coffee that Steve pushed in his hands. Peter was now glaring at his cereals, purposefully ignoring his parents. Steve nodded towards the teenagers like to encourage Tony to talk first. Tony downed half of his cup before starting.
Tony knew that. He knew that his fears were not entirely founded. When they had adopted, it had taken a lot of work to not freak out and sabotage the whole thing out of fear of fucking the kid up. It was so easy to do, so quick to happen. Not being there enough, being there too much, a hand off comment that he would take to heart and build his entire behavior on. There was so many ways to traumatize a child, even without realizing it.
Steve was sound asleep on the sofa, all the cushions on the ground. He walked to the fridge and hoped to find something. He wasn't  sure what he wanted, he wasn't even hungry. When he didn't find anything appealing in the fridge, he poured himself a glass of water. Before he realized what he was doing, he was sitting down on the ground next to the sofa, legs drown to his chest. He listened to Steve's slow and even breathing. The whole house was dead silent, to the exeption of the low buzzing of the fridge. It was strange, eery even.
He slipped inside their bedroom, Steve already in bed, back to the door. He wasn't sleeping, Tony could tell, his breathing was too regular and controlled.
He got just a groan in response and something that sounded like 'sleep'. He ordered Peter to dig Ned's jacket up and to make sure he wasn't forgetting anything. Tony sat the kid up who thankfully went along with it, and finally opened his eyes.
"No…" Peter got out of the house with a clean trash bag in hand. Tony watched as he crunched his face in disgust as he passed the smokers and quickened his pace to arrive at the car. "He was at party. I'm dropping them at your place."
Tony was pissed at himself, at Steve, at his past-self for keeping the cabinet full, for drinking so much that now he needed a full bottle of whiskey to be slightly drunk.
