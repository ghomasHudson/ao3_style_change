. Well, I dunno about how he feels about moving to Chicago, but I do think he's possibly the best thing that's ever happened to you.”
His temporary home sits on
These days, the farewells are just as random as the greetings.
one causes a tinge of pink to break out across the bridge of Dean's nose, clashing with his freckles, and he ducks his head before Sam notices. He pushes his half-finished cup of coffee in Cas's direction, hoping the beverage will occupy the angel's mouth long enough for Dean's feelings to chill the fuck out.
He tries to ask one of the maids how her day is going, but she scuttles away to do her job, completely unlike the friendly Mrs. Butters. Castiel walks over to the river during his lunch breaks, but the water isn't the same as the pull of the ocean waves. His visit to Dr. Alder goes well, the man remarking that Castiel already looks healthier but that they'll have to wait for the test results to see any true difference.
With the door already open, there is no bell or chime to signify their arrival, and thus no one to greet them at the front desk. The store is crammed to the brim with tall shelves, all piled high with an assortment of books. Reading some of the spines, Castiel learns most are books on traveling, the ocean, ships, the history of Texas, and various fiction. Although they seem mainly new, the manner in which the books were slotted into their spaces has given way to wear and tear on many of the spines and corners, and a fine sheen of dust covers everything in sight.
He takes a beer from the fridge and stomps back to his room, trying not to let Sam's ideas rattle around in his mind.
He gets in line to check out behind a woman with red hair, and Castiel is pulled back to Rowena. He has engaged in questionable nights before, and he's disregarded a few wedding bands in the heat of the moment. Rowena though, he actually
“I know that,” Castiel sulks.
Dean's laughter is gradually fading into small chortles. “Hell no, Cas! Ro is great, don't get me wrong, but she's not really my type. And I'm pretty sure if we were rooming together, Crowley would have already killed me in my sleep.”
about saying anything.”
“Yes,” Cas agrees, his lips brushing Dean's, “I suppose that's fair.” He draws back when Dean pushes closer, smirking when the hunter whines with need. Castiel's voice is low and demanding when he says, “Now how about you blow me a kiss, goldfish?”
Dean rolls onto his side and locks eyes with Castiel. “Not that I expect you to do the same!” he amends. “I know Ro kinda shoved all of this on you last minute, and you could do so many more interesting things than watch me get dressed–”
It ends up being a ten-minute wait for a table, but they're able to get one outside on the balcony looking over the ocean. Castiel peers closer when he notices the fencing on the porch. “Seagulls,” Dean explains.
Cas blinks the remaining sleep away, coming to stand behind Dean at the stove and look over his shoulder. “No, I'm actually very well-rested, but thank you for asking, Sam.”
“Amara,” Castiel repeats, disliking the way it rolls off his tongue. “Why does that sound familiar?”
“Yeah,” Castiel replies quietly, “she is.”
“Oh but I did, baby-bro. Geez, calm down, Cassie,” Gabe chides at his brother's furious expression. “It's not like she had a huge selection. There were, like, six books...
“You know, the syrup bottle shaped like a woman?” hints Dean. “Mmm, I could go for some pancakes right about now...”
“Don't talk about my nose,” Bela grumps. “Speaking of... Have you seen
Even if it is a bribe, does it matter? Castiel thinks of Dean's long lashes that frame sparkling eyes, the slope of his neck, the curve of his jaw, the way those pants cupped his round ass, the ridiculously filthy yet hot mechanic's uniform. The rude attitude, the low-paying job, the GED. In so many ways, Dean is everything Castiel never considers.
“Where are you?” comes Rowena's frantic accent.
“Dearie, I've
His thumb strokes along the underside of Dean's wrist, and Dean sucks in a tiny gasp. Castiel steps closer, waiting for any sign that he should stop, but Dean can't seem to move, eyes dark and lingering on their joined limbs. Castiel slides his other hand behind Dean's neck as he closes the distance, their shoes touching. Dean's eyes meet his before lowering to Castiel's lips, and Castiel tugs Dean's head down to meet him.
“I'm gay, too,” he replies brashly, enjoying the way her smile falls to the floor. “And her name is
One day, maybe soon, maybe tonight, he'll tell Castiel. Tell him how much he loves and appreciates him. But for now, he will wait until Cas comes back, comes back to
Dean really should have noticed sooner.
If only he was allowed.
Dean stares at the countertop, frowning at the toaster oven sitting there.
He looks up to meet Dean's cheerful expression, smile genuine and nose rosy from the cold. Castiel is taken aback by the sincerity in Dean's eyes, as if he's truly happy to see him.
“Dean,” he exclaims, surprised by the sudden appearance of the very man he's been trying to avoid all night. “I, erm, didn't think anyone would be up here.”
Fuck, that was the wrong thing to say. Castiel holds back a whimper and rolls over onto his other side so there's no chance Dean will see anything he's sporting.
“But guess what? I know of someone who's completely free all weekend.”
“A few times,” Dean says, glancing around warily before moving to the front desk. He looks almost nervous, uneasy in a way that Castiel has never seen before. Something has his back up, and Castiel keeps an eye out, too, although he's not sure what he's looking for.
. “You never asked,” Dean replies cheekily. “So, what'll it be?”
“Yup, my pride and joy,” preens Dean, stroking the steering wheel with love. “She belonged to my dad, and when he passed away, I inherited her.”
Dean is almost done cooking breakfast when Cas finally wakes and emerges from the bedroom, trudging into the kitchen with a yawn. He's sporting a pair of sweatpants and Dean's nightshirt, and damn if
He removes his lips from Cas's, grinning when the angel tries to follow. “Hold your horses, cowboy,” he chuckles, though Cas is far from amused, rolling his hips against Dean and causing the man to choke and stutter. “J-Jesus, Cas! I'm just saying we might want to continue this somewhere else... where Sam won't be able to walk in.”
And if Cas wants to let off a little sexual frustration, Dean is willing to take what he can get.
Ah fuck. A reporter recognizing him is nothing new, but right now, it's most inconvenient. It's not as if he's in hiding, he's a wealthy businessman, not a top celebrity, but Castiel hadn't exactly announced his vacation, either. People were bound to notice he'd disappeared from the public eye at some point. Although he is the least social of the Novaks siblings, he's still one of the most recognizable, courtesy of his baby blues, according to Gabe.
about it. Not until recently. Not until he'd seen firsthand Rowena's failing business. Not until Dean told him of his troubles.
this place?” Dean asks in disbelief. “How the hell can you afford this!?”
, and Castiel is trying not to have a mental breakdown in the middle of a department store.
She nods. “I thought about selling completely, but...” She gives a small shrug. “It's all I have left of him. I wish to hang on to it a little longer.”
Dean chokes, but Castiel only huffs fondly, leading the way up the stairs to the apartment. The two of them crowd into the tiny bathroom, and Dean pulls out the kit from underneath the sink.
“You stupid son of a bitch,” Dean finally says, tears falling down his face. “I love you, too.”
“I love him,” Castiel declares, jaw set and eyes burning. “And even if...” His voice falters. “Even if he won't have me back, I still think I'm making the right choice by leaving the company.”
the same events.”
Castiel winces at his brother's loud voice. “That's not true... I always drink at events and such.”
you. Ouch.”
“You're a terrible human being,” Castiel repeats, flattening his jacket.
“We arranged to meet with Ms. MacLeod this afternoon,” he continues briskly. “Perchance, do you know of her whereabouts?”
“Bookshelves?” The doctor sounds incredibly confused.
He's beginning to feel desperate, having searched the majority of the hall, when he overhears a nearby conversation.
Toward Castiel. With the demon cat.
, not my money or my job or my family name. And because you cared, I grew to care for you, too.” He steps closer, with a watery smile and wet lashes. Dean is frozen, but Castiel thinks he can see the hope behind those green eyes. “You
Bowed Legs cocks an eyebrow at Gabriel. “Is he for real?”
He bumps his hip against Cas's, and the angel's anger fades.  Still, Cas keeps the smoldering heat behind his eyes as he leans closer, tilting his head up to capture Dean's lips in a chaste kiss. He pulls away before Dean can properly respond.
Shooting him a funny look, Dean nods. “Yup. I'm repping Versace tomorrow, and I can only hope whatever clown suit they stick me in doesn't look awful.”
Dean wipes the tears from his eyes, cackling. “The fuck, that nosy git! No, Cas, my
“You sure about this?” Gabe asks one final time as he drops Castiel off at the airport.
Sometimes, Cas's lines are so unexpected that Dean cannot be held accountable for his reactions.
Rowena does an excellent job of distracting the guard by claiming to have lost her pass, while Castiel sneaks into the room with her badge. He sneaks because he's fairly certain there's a dress code for these sorts of parties, and, sure enough, he's acquiring a fair amount of scandalized looks once he's inside.
“Are you... tired?” Sam inquires incredulously.
And now, he never wants to let him go.
This year, Castiel will have to miss out on the big event, but he won't be stuck at home. MacLeod's is hosting a get-together for staff and regulars and friends, and Rowena basically threatened to drag his ass there herself if he didn't show.
“Gabriel!” Castiel admonishes, thoroughly embarrassed. Rowena is clearly unimpressed, eyeing Gabriel with a shrewd expression.
Dean hoots with laughter. “Nah, Sam's my brother. He was here all winter break when I first moved. Sam's a huge nerd, loves books, that's how we met Rowena. Those two really hit it off, and when he went back to California after the new year, Ro and I kept talking. Didn't anticipate becoming best friends with a crazy plant lady, but she's pretty awesome.”
, for an unknown amount of time; it could have been two or seven minutes, Dean can't tell the difference. It's only when his stomach rumbles that Dean tears his attention away from Cas and quietly closes the door, more out of respect for Cas's privacy than any sort of panic he might have upon Sam discovering Cas in his bed. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it.
“I mentioned my dad passed when I was in high school, yeah? Turns out he'd had cancer for a while but was too stubborn to go to the hospital.” Castiel feels for the man, squeezing Dean's hand in support, and Dean gives a quick squeeze in return.
“Let me guess, kiddo. You finally figured it out?”
“You're... You're not still moving back to Illinois, right?” Dean asks, sounding confused.
“How about you show me your honey bunch of oats?”
Castiel rolls his eyes and follows Dean into the hotel lobby. “I assume you've been here before then?”
His cart is soon bogged down with food, presents, and copious amounts of alcohol. Dr. Alder recommended cutting back on the liquor, and Castiel
special, but he isn't sure Dean wishes to hear such things from someone who wants to fuck his brains out but not actually date him. He settles for, “Do you want to talk about it?” It sounds even more cliché aloud, but he can't think of anything better in the moment.
Castiel's thumbs smooth over Dean's collarbone, and he unwillingly pulls back with a final nibble on Dean's ear. The man looks completely and utterly
Still... remembering how Dean had paid at the auto shop... If he pretends for a moment that the act isn't a payoff for sexual activity... While completely unnecessary (and somewhat insulting for Dean to assume Castiel can't afford an oil change), the gesture leaves a warm, tingly feeling in his veins. Or perhaps that's the alcohol kicking in.
The sound of cheers and hurrahs reach their ears, and the fireworks are exploding one after another, signaling the start of a brand new year.
“Cas, was it?” she smirks, a hint of something devious behind those lips. “You look familiar. Where have I seen you before?”
Fucking inconvenience.
Castiel doesn't have a chance to answer, scrambling away from the hidden door as it opens seconds later to reveal not only Dean Winchester but the Scottish Fold, too. “Sorry, Ro,” Dean greets, still holding the cat, who, as far as Castiel can tell, seems perfectly content in the man's arms. “I didn't realize how long I slept. Crowley didn't want me to leave.”
This will be another piece he can tuck away once it's over.
him to be? Despite his... lack of sophistication or college degree, Dean does offer a certain... appeal. Castiel hasn't been able to forget how delicious Dean looked in that suit, and his dreams take far too many liberties in demonstrating how Dean would remove said suit. The GED is hardly relevant; Castiel will teach Dean anything he needs to know, although he's fairly certain Dean already knows exactly how to move those plush lips of his. Besides... it's not as if Castiel wants to pursue anything long-term. Dean can grunt like a caveman for one night, Castiel thinks he'd prefer it.
They leave the restaurant hand in hand, and Castiel doesn't think he's ever had such a good time with someone before. Dean's touch sends warmth tingling through his veins as they cross the street to walk along the seawall's oceanside, hands swinging between them. They travel a few blocks, discussing mostly the store. Everything from the books to the coffee to the sales. They talk about Rowena and her love of plants, of Crowley and his demonic aura. Castiel shares a few stories from his childhood involving his siblings, omitting the finer details, and Dean tells him of several motel adventures with Sam, and Castiel has never felt so at peace.
“Did she just say 'tumblies?'” snickers Gabe.
“Never would have guessed,” he replies, bright eyes twinkling, and Castiel feels somehow mocked.
“You can't
But he approaches too closely, and, like a scared deer, Cas flees the kitchen and bunker alike, front door slamming behind him.
Dean on the nose with his index finger. Dean's brain must malfunction, because all he can manage is a high-pitched sort of wheeze.  And Cas pulls away, returning to Sam's side and advising him on the best way to handle the cursed decorations. It's over so fast, Dean isn't quite sure it even happened at all. At least not until Cas bids them farewell, merely nodding at Sam. Then, eyes crinkling, Cas smiles at Dean and declares, “It's been a treat, parakeet.”
at the inference. Deans takes this to mean the angel has spent the last few hours watching nothing but stupid cat videos and Minecraft tutorials on YouTube.
But somewhere in there, it had started, and then it slowly spiraled out of control over time. Hell, the whole mess is probably Dean's own fault, like most things. It sounds like something he would do, either because he was too tense at the time and one of Cas's sudden arrivals caused him to snap.  Or maybe Dean was just dicking around, poking fun at his favorite angel. Favorite because it's
“Shouldn't you... erm, be comforting Dean?” he questions awkwardly. “Not that I don't appreciate you being here, but... I figured you'd be supporting your best friend, not the outsider.”
They arrive back at the house just in time for a dinner consisting of homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Mrs. Butters leaves at six, promising to return the next day at ten, so Castiel will be on his own for breakfast, but she wrapped some loaf and potatoes for him to take for lunch. Castiel finds it odd to have someone taking care of him like this, though it is not entirely unwelcome. He is used to the quiet and unseen maids in his Chicago penthouse. Not this cheerful and lively housekeeper.
to move? He'd assumed all along that Dean enjoyed the lifestyle his modeling provided, and maybe at one point, he had. But Dean now... Dean is happy working at the auto shop. He's excited about getting certified and restoring old cars. He likes hanging out with Rowena in the bookstore. He enjoys taking Castiel around Galveston and showing him the island. Dean is happy here, how did Castiel not see it?
Their food is ready sooner than Castiel expected, and Dean leaves and returns with a huge tray of food. Although the music and noise from the other customers bothers him at first, Castiel learns to tune it out in favor of Dean's smooth vocal cords.
Castiel is no stranger to men handing out their digits. When someone gives Castiel their number, he knows what it means. But with Dean... Is this the same thing? How can Dean just give out his number so heedlessly, with no regard to Rowena? Castiel pushes her aside for the moment.
“Show's already over,” Rowena informs, leading the way. “But they're all in the banquet hall.” She chews on her painted lip. “He's not doing well, Castiel.”
much better than Bobby's rickety old couch. Dean groans something about memory foam and Castiel shuts him up with another kiss. He pushes Dean back until the man is lying atop the pillows and straddles his waist, bending over to mouth hotly at Dean's neck. Dean arches into the touch, sliding his hands under Castiel's shirt and digging his nails into the warm skin. Castiel hums, tugging Dean's collar to the side so he can lick his way down to Dean's clavicle. Dean's hands slip down to Castiel's ass, and he groans with satisfaction when Castiel thrusts down into Dean's lap.
“At ten, I'm aware,” interrupts a smooth voice that Castiel has come to associate with his headaches. He finally looks up, and immediately wishes he hadn't.
“Sounds to me like you're missing out,” Dr. Alder muses, collecting the test results and stacking them into a folder. “Why don't you just read them?”
, he reminds himself. Castiel was only planning things with his desires in mind. He'd never stopped to ask what Dean wanted.
Castiel chokes on the glass of water he'd taken from the table. “A
Dean's brows furrow, but Cas is gone before he can even start.
so I'd blissfully agree to uproot my life and move with you to Chicago!?”
“I'm... That's really shitty of him,” Dean says. “Is that why you said you don't do relationships?”
“But, if I may say so,” the man continues. “You seem a bit... disconnected as of late?”
“Rowena never told me where we're going,” Castiel admits, changing the topic. “She said you would tell me.”
break out into a flush. But, he can't deny the swooping sensation of his stomach or the relief that pours through him. “Ah, yeah, right... of course! So, uh, I'll see you later?”
But really, he's afraid to bring it up. He knows his brother is right though. With August fast approaching, and October in sight, his stay on Galveston Island is coming to an end.
Some of the crowd is whispering, speculating on just who the stunning man was winking at, but Castiel pays them no mind. He's too busy dealing with the sudden onslaught of feelings, and not just those of lust either. Dean broke face, looked so happy to see Castiel there in the audience, again with faint surprise that he's here and not off somewhere else. Like he can't believe Castiel actually stayed.
inside the hotel? Shit, now he really wants to know about Dean's job.
was the one to assault her. It was a lengthy and hard process for Dean, who had next to no one on his side. The only thing that saved him was the lack of proof; there were no fingerprints aside from her own on the weapons, and security footage of their apartment revealed nothing. Dean could only guess Amara had wiped the tape of her attack, but she couldn't fake video of Dean attacking her. The case eventually settled, with Dean paying thousands of dollars in legal fees and contract rewrites. He didn't have enough on Amara to get a restraining order, so he dropped off the New York modeling grid and moved down to Galveston with his uncle, working off the debt and Sam's remaining tuition.
, just avoiding, then. This, Dean can work with. He knows about avoiding things. He understands embarrassment. Embarrassment is the reason Cas ran away last time.  So he lets Cas keep up the charade, pretends to be oblivious to the angel and his brother so that Cas can feel more at ease, let his guard down. And when Sam and Cas are knee-deep in conversation about whether or not they should drive up to Madison, Wisconsin or if they want to call Jody (and personally Dean thinks that should be the decision since the case soundly relatively minor), Dean slinks away unnoticed. He doesn't need to be there; they aren't talking to him, and anyway, Sam will share the necessary details.
“They're
Ms. Rowena MacLeod, nor can it be her deceased father from whom she'd inherited the financially troubled business. Eyeing his tattered flannel and mismatched socks that peek out from under ripped jeans, Castiel wonders if the man is homeless and had wandered in through the open door. He certainly looks soiled enough, Castiel thinks, judging from the black streaks across his skin and the stains on his shirt.
“Buy you?” asks Dean, puzzled.
“Or something,” Castiel agrees, avoiding his gaze. “My brother was in town, too, so I spent a lot of time with him.”
Still, Castiel allows himself to admit the home is beautiful. He doesn't care for the local plant life; he's never been a fan of palm trees or sago bushes. At least he won't have to look at them much; he assumes he will spend his days either inside, or over at his new workplace.
Sam's tone can spell nothing good for Dean. “Cas only throws these one-liners at
He desperately hopes the shower is noisy enough to muffle any other sounds.
So Dean
“Looking for someone?”
“I realize this is a lot to process,” Castiel says, growing worried. “Perhaps I shouldn't have unloaded so much on you at once.” Or maybe Dean is trying to figure out how to let him down easily. “I know this is sudden, and if you've moved on, I completely understand and will walk away and never bother you again–”
He tries for nonchalance. “I wouldn't know; I don't remember you.”
Sadly, none of the bathrooms have actual showers installed. However, the one across the hall does sport an attached shower head to the clawfoot tub, in addition to modern plumbing (thank God). The house does not come with a washer or dryer, though, and so every few weekdays, Mrs. Butters will take home the laundry and do it there.
been busy. But Dean lifts an eyebrow, daring Castiel to insist he hasn't been avoiding Dean at the store.
Dean grins. “Kippers,” he announces proudly.
“You'll catch flies that way,” Dean informs him cheekily.
Stirring the potatoes, Dean shoots him a

to do. It had been Gabriel's genius idea to buy out a failing business and get it back on its feet. At the end of the year, Castiel can either sell it back or maintain some sort of ownership, whatever he decides. Upon hearing of Gabe's plans to have his brother run a bed and breakfast, however, Castiel intervened to have some input on his temporary endeavor.
He makes an escape up the hidden staircase, entering Rowena's apartment and stopping in awe. He hasn't been up here in weeks, since before Gabriel arrived, so Castiel is just now seeing her Christmas decorations. Twinkling lights hang from every potted plant dangling off the ceiling, like an enchanting night sky. A small tree is shoved in the space between the couch and chair, multicolored lights and what appear to be handmade ornaments gracing every branch. Embers gleam in the fireplace and suggest a bigger flame is finally burning out, and Castiel's eyes are drawn to the stockings hanging from the mantle.
“For what, Dean?”
. Do you by chance know him?” Considering they were both in the show, Castiel hopes for the best.
Castiel, in turn, lets himself drink in the stranger, six feet of freckled skin and perfect cheekbones, topped off by gorgeous green eyes. Too bad these features are hidden under all of the dirt, or Castiel might consider himself interested.
“Insane right?” Dean says, frowning as he pulls up to the valet stand. “They do have a lazy river though.”
“Fuuuck,” he swears, chucking the card across the room with reduced aim.
Gabe stays the night, bunking with Castiel so they don't dirty unnecessary sheets, although there is a tiny second bedroom on the third floor, housing a single bed that looks too small for even Gabe's height.
He has. He excuses himself with an errand every single time Dean visits.
Dean whistles again at the interior. “Shit,” he exclaims, careful to toe off his shoes. “This looks straight out of the early 1900s.”
“You know,” Sam says thoughtfully one evening after Cas has left following yet another strange salutation of,
The show itself is nearly three hours long and features five labels. Castiel is shocked but pleased to find himself seated in the third row with a perfect view of the runway. Nearly all of the models could be sex dreams, but Castiel is disappointed each time someone walks the catwalk who isn't Dean. They are all gorgeous men, but Castiel is too distracted wondering what Dean will look like to care about the others.
“Me and Ro?” Dean chuckles, tears in his eyes. “First you think I'm with Jo, now you think I'm dating
this life his wheelhouse? What if the ex wasn't an issue, the other models, either? What if Dean could still dress up and go to parties and eat nice dinners?
Dean formulates a plan. He acts on it the next time Cas swings by for an impromptu visit.
Castiel scowls. “Oh, I found it all right.”
“Hmm?” His response is muffled by the skin of Castiel's throat as he sucks a mark there.
Castiel coughs out a dry laugh. “No, I'm not part of any mafia.” He finishes the rest of his beer, the cool drink soothing his churning gut. “I'm the head accountant for my family's banking firm.”
“Baby bro, you don't even realize how much Dean-o has affected you, huh?” Gabe leans forward with his elbows on the table. “You look happier than I've ever seen. You're more relaxed, the lines are fading from your forehead. From what you've told me, you're trying new foods you used to avoid. You're going out and having
only a ten-minute's stroll away from the beach.
Dean waves it off. “Bobby hunts in his spare time; guns are like his third arm.”
For one brief second of insanity, Castiel thinks the
“You're not sticking around for breakfast?” Dean questions, hoping Cas doesn't hear the ache behind it.
“Yeah, I was waiting for you to quote one of your weird farewells before disappearing.”
“You don't normally eat fish for breakfast,” Cas comments. Then, thoughtfully, he amends, “You don't normally eat fish at all.” He meets Dean's playful look. “Why now?”
Castiel can't imagine losing his mother so young. She'd always been the rock of the Novak family, looking after them all while running the corporation with an iron fist. And his father, while not as stern, especially after his health scare, Castiel can't picture him abandoning his own children. Dean must have been forced to grow up quickly.
“Castiel, if you don't mind,” he introduces, shaking her proffered hand and trying to not smirk as Gabe rubs his sore skin. “It is nice to meet you, Mrs. Butters. You are the housekeeper, correct?”
“Of course I am,” he answers, highly confused himself. “I leave at the end of September, remember?”
Mrs. Butters arrives just before ten o'clock, and she usually finds Castiel fresh out of the shower after completing his morning run. Jogging is one part of his new schedule that Castiel is completely on board with. He used to run in college, but that had stopped soon after working for the firm. Occasionally, Castiel had made it to the company gym, but he detests working out in front of others, not exactly being a social body. But this? Jogging up and down the streets, or running along the seawall and feeling the ocean breeze on his arms? Further points in Gabriel's favor.
“My tire light came on,” he explains. “And I probably need an oil change.”
outfit. He's silent and staring for too long though, and the man clenches his jaw. “I see,” is all he says, and Castiel feels an ounce of guilt for his blatant judgment.
“That has to be the cheesiest line I've ever heard,” he states seriously, although Cas can't quite conceal the mirth behind his eyes.
For their second date, Dean takes Castiel to the Galveston Pleasure Pier. It's gimmicky and pricy and made for tourists, but Castiel loves it. He and Dean get on every single ride, roller coaster or otherwise. Dean throws up his four hotdogs after the Revolution spinner, but they ride everything else twice, even the carousel. After funnel cakes and other snacks, Dean drags Castiel to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, an overpriced seafood restaurant based on a film Castiel has yet to see (“We are so correcting that one day,” Dean cries, “How have you
texting your brother. For months now.”
trying to sell it.”
Right. The car.
something was wrong with this omelet! You put fish in it, didn't you!?”  Dean ignores his brother, though he does hear Sam gag and leave the room muttering about one too many pranks.
“I...” His voice comes out in a scratch.
“You boys flatter me.” She grabs her purse from behind the register and turns to Castiel. “I'll be back on Sunday. Don't let the place burn down while I'm gone.”
Huh. Interesting.
Dean rolls his eyes, having something else in mind that Cas can
“Ahoy, matey.”
Bobby's house is being fumigated, and Castiel is too sexually frustrated to deny Dean when he suggests taking their kisses back to his place after they get kicked out of a restaurant for too much PDA.
It's not supposed to hurt this much.  It always ends this way.
“Please, Dean, do be quiet,” Castiel orders as they approach the Versace designated rooms, and Dean shuts his mouth. “Rowena may have asked, but in the end, I agreed. I never do
“Oh, I didn't. But he tends to grow on you, doesn't he?”
“He probably already left,” Aaron continues blatantly. He leans in close. “Listen, this pregame is mostly for the critics, the guests. A bunch of us are heading to the
before, not like this. Dean paid his bill because he wanted to do something nice for someone he likes. And that someone is Castiel.
Jo smirks. “No charge. It's already taken care of.”
His head is swimming with questions.
Cas is still searching his face, waiting kindly for Dean to stop deflecting, to sort through his thoughts and gather a true response. It's one of the things he admires most about Cas, that after all they've been through and all that they've done to each other, he
“I think I'll declare myself a lost cause,” Castiel says, accepting the towels and patting at the stains. “It took years for me to learn how to use a computer, and that was dire to my accounting career. I can only imagine how long I'll war with the coffeemaker.”
They close shop at five, Castiel helping to keep Rowena on a set schedule. He returns home around five-thirty to whichever heavenly dinner Mrs. Butters has prepared that day. She does the dishes while he eats, and although Castiel could retreat to the dining room for privacy, he doesn't want to create more of a mess for her to clean right before she leaves, so he chooses to take his meals in the kitchen and listen to the woman prattle on about her day and her family.
to sleep simply because Dean did, wanting to remain snuggled against him. He watches Cas fondly, deciding it's not at all creepy. He stands there, leaning against the door frame with a smile on his face that Sam would surely label as
“Those stockings are old,” Dean laughs. “Rowena made 'em when I moved here a few years ago. Matching ones for her and Fergus, and the same for me and Sam.”
Castiel, however, keeps finding new ways to surprise Dean.
This time, Dean traps Cas against the wall with his hands.
Dean had been right; the place really didn't feel like a home. Castiel prefers their new one, full of Dean's textbooks and Castiel's novels, Dean's movies and Castiel's mugs, Dean's records and Castiel's hand-knitted blankets. They live on the north side of the island, because while Castiel was content with a beach house, Dean made a good point for something a bit more hurricane-proof. And from their balcony, they can still see the ocean, not as close, but it's just fine for watching the fireworks.
“But you said... you were waiting for me to leave.”
Like a vehicle.
And isn't that typical of Castiel, considering Dean's feelings before his own. It's actually rather sweet, but Dean fights back his blush. It won't do to falter now.
“They've mostly made up,” Rowena replies. “Samuel is mad at Dean, but for different reasons. He doesn't like that his older brother suffered in silence and went into the job to pay for Samuel's schooling. Dean's a very private person, even among his family, and Samuel just wishes he could be there for Dean, but he's still in school and Dean still sends a check every month.”
So instead, he resolves to treat this as the best he'll ever have, as Cas has certainly ruined him for anyone else, now that
Not after he has finally realized what Cas has been after this whole time. How had he not recognized it?  Dean has been throwing down pick-up lines since he was an early teen.  True, Cas's vocabulary might not be quite as... seductive as most, but it's still having the intended effects.  Now that he's aware, Dean can practically see the sexual tension rolling off the angel in waves. And sex, well Dean knows all about that. Does he think this will screw up the friendship he and Cas currently have? Probably. Will he be depressed and moody afterward? Definitely. But this isn't about what Dean wants; this is about what
“Needed some air,” Castiel admits, admiring the way the firelight reflects on Dean's skin.
? A client? A coworker? A... one-night stand?
“It was my mistake to hope–” He shuts up and finishes buckling his belt. “I should have remembered you don't like it when I watch you sleep.”
“It's not that, Cassie,” Gabe replies, noisily slurping down the last of his nutella shake. “I can't believe
Castiel distractedly finishes closing the shop, his mind so preoccupied that he checks the front door three times before he's convinced he really did lock up.
He'd sold the Cabriolet before returning to Chicago, not anticipating further need of it. He now wishes he hadn't, although the thought is irrational; where would he have kept it? Castiel contemplates ubering all the way to Galveston, but the app shows that is going to cost way more than a pretty penny. Better to just buy another car, he'll need one here anyway.
Castiel bites down hard on his lip, hating every word she's spewing.
. A good chunk of the audience must agree, for Castiel hears several gasps, and a few women even swear.
Dean. Castiel suddenly wants Dean more than he's ever wanted anything in life before. This penthouse, his job, his money... He has all of it, but he's not happy. He was happy with
It's just as captivating as the first time he read it pressed into a corner of the couch with Dean's feet atop his, the faint noises of the store and the smell of paper all around them, Dean's breathing slow and even as he scratches away in his textbook, and Castiel looks up to remark on a particular passage to Dean.
Castiel orders a Texican Old Fashioned, which looks like a really fancy name for a modified whiskey, and Dean requests a water. Perhaps he'd prefer something off-menu?
Dean doesn't know what he expected would happen after enacting upon this rather ridiculous plan, which constituted of nothing more than
“–and where has your little yappy dog run off to now?” purrs a silky female voice. “She's gone and left you all alone. Or maybe she's just scared.”
“You're an account?” Dean asks, surprised. “Before this I mean.”
“You're in... Wait,
“You look...” Castiel bites his lip, unable to say what he's actually thinking,
“Congratulations, Mr. Novak, your blood pressure has gone down,” Dr. Alder praises during his next appointment. “I think your vacation did wonders for your health.”
And Dean... Dean is incredibly tense, although he's plastered on a stiff smile as they weave their way through the crowd. Most of the guests are chatting easily, although many conversations break off as Dean and Castiel walk by. They eye Dean appreciatively, although they turn a nose up as they take in his suit. Castiel receives a few nods for his taste, but he ignores them, he's not here to mingle, after all, he's here to... He's not exactly sure what he's here for.
“Dean?”
Dean cocks an eyebrow in return. “Uh, no. I live with Bobby Singer, my uncle, behind the auto shop. Why did you think I live here?”
“You think that's...?” Gabriel inquires doubtfully. Castiel shakes his head.
Dean checks them into the ballroom, where many round dining tables have been crowded into the area. Across the back of the room sits a large catwalk, and Castiel's eyes immediately go to the posters hanging from the ceiling.
“Nah, she only talked about how you and your brother bought the business.”
“Dean! How is your day going? Mine definitely just got better,” Cas praises, plopping into the booth next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shit, Cassie, how much did you drink last night?”
“Tires are good to go, and your oil's been changed,” she informs.
“I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to cars,” Castiel says, attempting to replicate Dean's way with the coffeemaker.
Humming, Castiel looks up directions. He's pretty sure Discount would check the tires for free, but he's also overdue for an oil change... and since when has he been pressed for funds?
to these events but they don't get any easier. Hate 'em sometimes, honestly.”
The man stares, then barks out a laugh. “Riiiight. Follow me.” He strides on bowed legs from the secondhand section back into the main part of the store, Gabe giggling after him and Castiel struggling to reclaim the situation.
He wakes every morning at seven, even if that really means he wakes up at five and forces himself back to sleep for two more hours. After he dresses, Castiel makes himself a breakfast of avocado toast, because, in addition to a list of strenuous activities he's to avoid, Dr. Alder had also provided dietary guidance. Thankfully it's more a list of foods to eat vs foods to avoid, rather than a strict diet, but Dr. Alder had told Castiel that he needed to cut back on the alcohol and red meat. A crime, truly, considering alcohol and red meat is what Castiel prefers most.
The jacket Dean is showing looks to be a combination of polyester and wool, colored a deep and spirited solid red. His pants are the same shade, with black shoes and a collared black shirt. Castiel vows green is still Dean's best color, but this red–
Castiel pulls out his phone and brings up Gabriel's number.
Although Castiel agrees wholeheartedly with that second statement, he frowns at the way Dean seems to think of Sam as the 'brains' of the family, as if he's not intelligent too. To be fair, Castiel didn't think so either at first; he recalls Dean first mentioning the GED and Castiel's subsequent sneer. Even if Dean isn't a genius, Castiel shouldn't have judged so quickly. Dean is clearly talented in other areas.
Castiel drives off, the threatening figure of Bobby Singer growing smaller in the rear-view mirror, and he only breathes easier again once they're off the property. Dean chuckles.
“You don't...” Dean's voice cracks when he realizes what Castiel is saying. “Not at all?” he asks, like he's waiting for Castiel to say
Fergus hisses wildly when Castiel finally notices, as if the cat had been purposely waiting for him to see before making noise.
Castiel and Dean's dates become at first a weekly occurrence, and then later, a day-to-day one. As the weeks stretch into months, they go out three, sometimes four nights a week. Castiel's first impression of Galveston had left much to be desired, but Dean continues to prove him wrong.
Singer Auto is only a twenty-minute drive, probably less during non-holiday hours. The shop is easy to find, set back just off the main road. From looks alone, Castiel would have never come here; the place is rundown and dingy, with broken cars and parts scattered across what appears to be a salvage yard. However, Rowena's good word spurs him forward, though he remains somewhat apprehensive as he pulls up in front of the main shop. Further back, behind more cars, sits a small house, and Castiel wonders if Mr. Singer lives there.
“Target,” Dean corrects with pride. “I do it out of spite.” He looks up and down Castiel's figure, eyes darkening. “Not that that suit isn't working for you, but I didn't realize you cared so much about fashion.”
“I'm... sorry I thought you and Rowena were dating.”
But Cas is gone before Dean can collect himself, before he remembers how to breathe. Before he hurries off to the bathroom to resolve a problem that he's not entirely sure how he acquired, although it probably has something–
Castiel parks behind the bookstore, and they walk the few blocks to the hotel. Dean looks up at the old building with masked emotion.
He tries not to read into it, but Dean thinks Cas begins dropping by more frequently.
“A bit yeah,” Dean admits. “It's not really my wheelhouse, you know? But... I kinda liked it. A part of me liked dressing up and going to parties and whatnot. After my ex... Well, she sucked the fun out of everything. Same with douches like Aaron.”
Dean takes a few paper towels, tentatively reaching for Castiel's chest. Between the two of them, they pat Castiel dry soon enough, although he still feels a bit sticky. Dean's hand lingers at his waist, towel rubbing skin that already dried.
“They're full of books I've never read or given a second glance to. And I find myself staring at them often,” Castiel explains slowly. He isn't quite sure what he's saying or why, but the words keep coming out. “And it makes me sad.”
?” Dean gapes, apparently still unable to process Castiel's declaration of love.
are involved. Dean will still go out for a lay to combat the loneliness, but he knows it will never be like
why he hadn't wanted to bring Dean home. “It's mostly my mother's company.”
It can't be Rowena's; he's never heard her mention a child. Castiel downs several shots after this revelation, although he takes care to watch his limit.
Castiel thinks of the GED. “Oh, is that when you got your...?”
were great.” There's the truth. Cas was
,” Dean snorts. “And that was ages ago, back before you fixed your nose.”
The grocery bag turns out to be two gallons of chocolate ice cream and a box of plastic spoons.
And Cas's laugh is loud and inviting, spreading its warmth through Dean's rib cage. His fingers find Dean's jaw, thumb stroking the scruff fondly.
, and then gave out his phone number. Is this supposed to mean something? Did Dean take care of the bill so that Castiel would then feel obligated to call? Is this supposed to be a bribe? Castiel is not unfamiliar with those, either. Lower-ranking Novak employees have approached him before, promising sex in exchange for promotions. Not that Castiel ever agrees to these offers.
“Dearie, I was just poking a wee bit of fun.” She looks at Gabriel. “Stiffer than a redwood, this one, eh?”
This hastily-scrawled message is followed by a phone number.
“And after?” She wants to know of his long-term intentions. Understandable, considering that not only does he now own her business, but the building as well, including the two floors where she lives.
The restaurant they dined at in Houston was even more expensive than this one, so Castiel doesn't understand. But as Dean shifts in his seat, looking self-conscious in his dark jeans and flannel next to Castiel's sleek blazer, he realizes... Dean's uncomfortable.
As it is, the weather is fairly cold for Galveston this time of year, the highs hugging 70 degrees, but more often than not, dropping between 65 and 60, bolstered by the sea winds.
“Hey hey, pipe down, you ain't a tiger,” a gruff voice rebukes from beyond the ceiling. Fergus keeps on making noise, however, and a moment later, a head pops through where the stairs end.
“Altered?” Dean repeats, brows raised. “What do you mean,
He expects Cas to join Sam at the table, but the angel merely takes a sip of his piping hot drink before scooting back into Dean's personal space, resting his chin on Dean's shoulder. Dean forces himself to ignore the urge to turn around and flip Sam off for whatever mushy face he's making.
Their date to Moody Gardens is one of Castiel's favorites. He enjoys the aquarium pyramid, particularly the penguin area, while Dean prefers the sharks and big fish. In the rainforest pyramid, Dean's allergies begin acting up, but Castiel's heart melts a little when Dean insists he can manage so that they can finish the exhibit for Castiel's benefit. They relax a bit in Palm Beach, but there are too many children running around and too many judgmental parents for Castiel's hands to wander as much as they'd like, so they leave after only twenty minutes and buy a second round of tickets for the aquarium.
“That's acceptable,” he continues. “As you're undoubtedly aware, I'm only here for the next twelve months, October to October, and then I'll be heading back to Chicago. Within that time, we'll work on getting your business back up to speed.”
All three of his calls to Rowena go straight to voicemail, so Castiel focuses on what else he needs now that he's in Houston.
Dean Winchester is strolling leisurely into the store, looking for all the world as if he just waltzed off the pages of a magazine. He's wearing black dress shoes, and while they don't exactly scream
“Haha, for sure, every Fourth of July, too. Rowena's got the best spot on the island.”
“No, I can't,” Dean mutters back, jingling his keys. “I have to finish the contract or we're screwed. This isn't just about me; I've got to consider Sam, too.”
Castiel storms off, heading for the exit and the elevators, uncaring at that point if Dean is behind him or not. He is, of course, and is grinning like a fool.
Then cautiously, “Do you still want me to leave?”
But the door snaps shut, and Castiel is left alone on the rooftop in the chilly January air.
Dean smiles down at him reverently, eyes soft with love. He leans down to capture Castiel's lips, and Castiel melts into the kiss, pulling him closer as his free hand cradles Dean's jaw.
They drive up the interstate and into Houston. Dean informs him that tonight's function is merely a dinner, and tomorrow Dean will be working, but Castiel will have entry to the event, although he's more than welcome to explore the city if he chooses.
Although Gabriel can be a handful, Castiel is grateful he spent Christmas here. Otherwise, the holidays would have been long and lonely. Generally, Castiel is always incredibly busy around this time of year with work. And if he's not working, he's attending holiday galas and spending Christmas Day at his mother's mansion with his siblings. New Year's Eve is the big Novak Corp end-of-year function, and there's always an open bar and more than enough single men looking for a midnight rendezvous.
Dean sighs as his fingers linger on the last bandage. “Look, Cas... About what happened... I'm sorry. I told you I'm not looking for something quick, and I stand by that.”
This leads to many movie nights, where Castiel comes over to the Singer household, and Dean curls up next to him on an old couch while Bobby goes upstairs and pretends to ignore them. Castiel staves off any activity at his own home, telling Dean he doesn't own a DVD or Blu-ray player (he does, but he left both back in Chicago since he wasn't a movie person before). The couch sees a fair amount of heated action, wet makeout sessions and bodies pressed close together into the cushions. Dean never escalates things further, although, with his uncle only feet away in an upstairs bedroom, Castiel doesn't fault him.
After dinner when the house is quiet, Castiel fires up his laptop and checks his email and Facebook account. Nothing work-related of course, Gabriel had actually gone and changed the passwords to his Novak accounts, the bastard. So he's left to check his personal email and Facebook, the latter being where his mother requests daily updates. He doesn't go into details, merely promising her that he's fine and eating better and not at all stressed. He's bored out of his skull by the laid-back attitude of islanders and tourists alike and disappointed at the lack of alcohol he's consuming, but he doesn't mention any of that.
No, Dean sneaks off, up the stairs and out of sight, hiding in the shadows by the front door. He's not about to let Cas pop off so easily again.
“And after I left my number in your car, too.” Dean sits up suddenly. “Unless... you never found it?”
“Do you remember giving me a piece of blue sea glass?”
He sighs, fingers pausing in their rhythm to sink into the skin of Cas's hip.
“Did you get onto the internet again? I told Sam not to leave you unsupervised.”
He laughs. “Yes, Dean.”
Rowena whispers a few things in Dean's ear that have the man blushing scarlet, and Meg paws for one final attempt at Castiel's ass, and then, they're off. They sit in awkward silence for a handful of minutes, Dean's rock music playing, both seemingly unsure of what to say.
Castiel sits up in a hurry, the room spinning as he does. “Damn. What time is it?”
“You were at the shop?” Castiel rubs his temples before sipping at the rest of his water.
attack me.” Castiel hesitates. “Not that he didn't try.”
“Yes, dearie,” she reminds him gently. “I told you last week I'd be gone this Saturday. Don't tell me you weren't paying attention?”
“Is that why you're quitting?”
Dean's expression darkens. “That's... one reason.”
“Of course it's not free,” she hisses, keeping her voice low, mindful of the other two customers who are also in the room. Thankfully, none of them noticed Castiel's remark. “I said it's already taken care of.”
“Lucky for me, you're here,” Castiel replies, hands fisting into his fiancé's hair and tugging him down for one of many more kisses.
“If everyone followed your logic, we'd never get anything done,” Rowena replies tartly. “Recall the famous quote, 'don't judge a book by its cover.' You can't view everything as doomed to fail, dearie.”
“Erm... well, that's... nice,” he finishes lamely. “I thought you didn't like him?”
Castiel keeps the Scottish Fold in his peripherals as it hisses while he lowers himself into the chair. “I see.” He reaches for the mug, and Fergus the cat screeches and swipes his paw, yellow eyes flashing dangerously.
Dean shrugs. “I've been doing it for years, I better not suck,” he jokes, his speech dropping slightly.
“Just
He spends a painstaking amount of time researching and arranging the date. He scours the internet for the best restaurants in Galveston, eventually choosing and securing reservations to the Rooftop Bar atop the Treemont Hotel. He has his car washed, because even though Dean wants to take the Impala, Castiel is adamant that, as the one taking Dean out, he will be the one to pick up Dean. He frets over what to wear, finally deciding on a nice black blazer and navy button-down with his favorite blue tie, the one Anna says brings out the color in his eyes. Although he's trying not to be assumptive, Castiel stocks up on condoms and lube; even if they don't use them tonight, he's positive they'll come in handy at some point (preferably soon).
Castiel accepts his glass with a kiss, nibbling on Dean's lower lip before he lets go. “I think we deserve the night to ourselves.” He makes room on the wicker couch for Dean to join him. “Besides, I bet you ten dollars that Rowena and Gabe are going at it before the night's over.”
“They dated for nearly two years. But during that time, Amara revealed her true colors,” Rowena says, contempt evident in her voice. “She only allowed Dean to take her out to expensive restaurants, and she manipulated him into buying her all sorts of pricy jewelry. When he tried to resist, arguing he needed to save money, she accused him of cheating, blaming his lack of cash on spending it with other people. Slowly, she began driving away all those Dean considered friends. She started controlling his modeling schedule, his diet, his hobbies. She wanted to be the only one in his life, and she was extremely jealous of his close relationship with Samuel. I think out of everything, she hated Dean sending Samuel monthly checks for school. She felt that was money Dean should be spending on her.”
Dean has the decency to look apologetic at that. “Sorry, man. These parties are not my forte. I, uh, I'm kinda a showman, you could say?” He fixes his suit in the mirror. “I mean, I'm
Castiel forces himself to look away from the lean lines of Dean's body.
Castiel hesitates as they get into the elevator. “I didn't mean to be presumptuous... I know we didn't get off to the best of starts–”
“Dean finally discovered she'd been screening his calls and telling his brother that Dean didn't want to speak to him. Dean confronted her about it, about everything, and she... let's just say she didn't take it well.”
“Yes, well,” Castiel fumbles. This is
“Anyone ever tell you you're an asshole?”
“But... but...” Castiel thinks back. “But you're always sleeping over, in the shop or her apartment, and her cat loves you, and what about that date?”
“What?”
?” he questions, studying the interior of Dean's car. He has to concede: it's an exquisite ride that appears to be well-taken care of.
He wants to argue, he wants to tell Dean that's not true, that Dean
“No, I don't want you to leave.” He clasps Cas's hand between both of his, lowering it between them. “Cas, I...”
“Chicago, yes,” he confirms, but Castiel is hesitant to say more. After hearing Dean speak of all his money troubles and problems, Castiel is worried about sharing too much too soon. He doesn't want Dean to see him as only some rich exec who wants to get back to the high life as soon as possible, even if it is the truth.
“I gotta disinfect them, 'k?” he says, removing the little bottle first from the box. “'S probably gonna sting.”
. He snorts; perhaps it hadn't been so random after all. Gabriel hurriedly dumps it onto an end table.
The angel doesn't need to nap, so Dean takes a moment to appreciate that Cas lingers here in bed with him. Dean's tired and sated, and he wants nothing more than to roll over and fall asleep next to Cas.
Dean Winchester to hiss.
Dean can only wonder how fucking long-overdue this has been, and why has he ignored these feelings all that time? He should have acted on this
So why is it that, two months later, he's
After helping Castiel move his Cabriolet into the carport at the back of the house (“See, bro, not a scratch!” “Yes, but I have to drive slower than a mile an hour. This is going to be a nightmare.”), Gabriel offers to drive them both over to Castiel's new place of employment.
Such as, what to pack. He was instructed to bring an overnight bag, but not much else, and so he has no idea if what he's brought is adequate enough. He has another suit in his garment bag for a second event tomorrow night, and he wonders what sort of function a mechanic would attend that requires two suits.
He learns that Mrs. Butters lives just off the island, up the mainland in a little place called Texas City. Her husband died in the war, though she never says which one, the topic too unsettling for her to completely breach. She happily tells Castiel of her three daughters, however, and of her five grandchildren. Two of the girls and their families live up in Dallas, but the youngest is still in university in Houston, and they meet on weekends.
Cas is quiet after this. His face pales, eyes darting away, but the sheets are being pulled back and Cas is rising from the bed before Dean can finish deciphering the expression. He feels Cas's skin recede from his hold, and Dean sits up anxiously as Cas picks his clothing from the floor.
Although the bookstore only occupies the ground level, the structure itself is three stories tall, and Castiel was wrong to assume them to be occupied by storage rooms. The stairs open up to a small but homey living room, stuffed with a couch, chair, and even more bookcases, all crowded around a tiny fireplace. The books here are even older and rougher than the stacks downstairs, but Castiel figures they are worn with years of love rather than neglect. Plants hang from almost every available space on the ceiling, and a very ancient, boxy television protrudes from the widest shelf available. To his right, Castiel can see a tiny bathroom beyond a small door, and to his left, a second staircase leads to the third floor, wiry and black and curved.
They take an uber to a ritzy place a few blocks over. Dean wants to put some space between himself and the event, but he also explains he eats free at certain restaurants as part of his modeling contract.
“Yeah, I assumed you'd be there at this time. When I didn't see you, I expected Rowena to swoop in all worried. But no, instead it was your bible-thumping boyfriend who started asking all the questions.”
Unfortunately, Castiel's mental promise that Dean is forbidden territory does not immediately vanquish his attraction, and with any number of dirty things springing to mind at the sight of him, Castiel takes to avoiding Dean in the following weeks.
Castiel stares. Hard. “Excuse me...?” he chokes, his voice an octave higher than it should be.
Castiel leans his head on her shoulder as Rowena puts aside her ice cream and folds her legs.
“Yeah, but not
“Sort of,” he answers with a grin, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “My GED doesn't allow many options, but I'm trying to get a certification.”
And Castiel is already closing in, his breath tickling Dean's eyelashes.
“I told you about my ex. It's just... Seeing her frequently at these events gets to me. I know it sounds stupid and unprofessional, but... I'm at the end of my rope, Cas. Especially without a restraining order, she bothers me incessantly.”
“Cas, it's fine,” Dean interrupts kindly, still smiling like a giddy child. “I consider you a friend, too. Now, what do you say we go back to the room so I can refresh, and then head out for dinner?”
Not that everyone here is suited up, but Dean is likely embarrassed looking so dressed-down. Castiel knows
“You aren't thirsty?”
Castiel is torn between laughter and shitting his pants, and he jumps nervously when Dean suddenly reaches across him to wave out the window.
“I gotta be up at five,” Dean breaks the silence, “but you can sleep in if you want. I'll leave your ticket on the dresser.”
, in ways I've never felt.” He swallows down the tears and the break in his voice. “You cared about me, cared for
to stop!” He eases Castiel off his lap, movements sluggish as he comes out of a haze. “I'm not saying that wasn't hot as fuck, but...
“Save it,” Dean cuts off icily, words dripping with venom Castiel's never heard before. “You're dead to me.”
For almost a minute, Dean swears it's so quiet that Cas must have found a way to break the wards and fly directly out of the room. Closing his eyes, Dean reminds himself that everything is fine. He knew this would happen. Sure, he didn't expected it to cut so deeply, but since when did he and Cas ever inflict anything less than major scars upon each other? They have, as Cas had once called it, a
Rowena is proficient with the machine, but Castiel struggles. One Saturday after they've closed, Dean volunteers to teach him while Rowena is upstairs feeding Fergus.
“You're very good at it,” Castiel says over his steak. He likes the restaurant, feeling very at home surrounded by all of the elegance. He can almost imagine this is somewhere back home, and Dean is– He pauses in his fantasy. Dean is
“I didn't realize how much he hates wealth,” Castiel admits shamefully.
“I see you opted for something more casual,” Dean observes, eyes trailing down Castiel's buttoned shirt and pressed slacks. Castiel almost responds positively, until he realizes Dean is using sarcasm again. He huffs.
Castiel squints. A model. Wait. He'd thought Dean looked like a magazine spread the first time he'd seen the man dressed to the nines. “I knew I recognized you,” Castiel says, catching Dean's attention. All the blood seems to drain from his face. “You did a Rolex ad, right?” Yes, Castiel remembers clearly now, Dean's face had been featured in a few of the magazines he kept on the coffee table in the tenth-floor lobby outside his office.
The man wakes with a start, flailing ungracefully before rolling off the sofa and onto the floor, knocking over several books on the nearby coffee table in the process. He stands quickly, glancing around to get his bearings before his eyes rest on the two men hovering. The man allows his gaze to roam from Gabriel's casual polo and jeans, to Castiel's suit and trench coat, eyes lingering a bit longer on Castiel than his brother.
“Cas, don't you know it's bad luck not to kiss at midnight?”
🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝
“Oh. Well, uh...” Dean's face continues to fall as he fumbles. “I was hoping maybe we could, you know... take things slow?”
“I can understand that,” Castiel replies. “No, really. Being here, working at the bookshop, redoing the store, and seeing sales improved... It's such a feeling of accomplishment. I never feel this good about my job in accounting, even though I'm taking home far more wages. It's... invigorating.” He smiles with bittersweet emotions. “I'm going to miss it.”
Dean rolls his eyes, returning to Cas's original question. “It's sirloin steak with garlic butter and roasted potatoes, obviously. You sticking around for dinner today?”
“You consider us friends, Cas?”
Aaron doesn't like that, apparently. “To be honest, Dean is probably off screwing that red-haired bimbo; he's always blowing the rest of us off like he's better than we are,” Aaron scoffs viciously.
Showered and dressed in slacks and a button-down of the day, Castiel heads off to work. The back alley is a learning process; the first morning, he makes the mistake of trying to drive out the same way another car is trying to drive in. His neighbor, an older man named Frank, yells at Castiel for five minutes about how the younger generation has no sense of direction, be it cars or running the world and a bunch of other malarkey Castiel disregards. By the end of the week, though, he's fairly comfortable at driving his Mercedes in and out of the narrow backstreet.
on my floor.”
Castiel lurks at the edge of the greenery, watching. He hasn't seen Dean in weeks, since Rowena advised it would be best to give the man some space before trapping him alone with Castiel on her roof. The scheme seemed ludicrous at best, there was no way Dean would fall for such an obvious ploy; Rowena never needed help with her garden. It must have worked to some degree, however, because Dean is here, sweating under the afternoon sun in jeans and a tank, arms bare and freckled for all the world, or at least Castiel, to see. Golden sunlight reflecting on his skin and in his hair, Dean waters the sprawling leaves, toeing at the mosaic patio tiles with his boot.
Dean whistles. “Damn, Cas, you live
The man hastily stands, the book, where he'd been scribbling notes in the margins, slamming shut around his pencil, and ah, there's the bowed legs that earned him the nickname all those days ago.
“So you went into modeling because of your looks?” he prompts, curious how that started.
Dean doesn't even look at him, dropping his duffel bag on the bed before hanging the garment bag in the closet and doing the same to Castiel's. “Yeah. Forgot to mention, don't call me Winchester here. I use the name
“Isn't it great, Cassie?” Gabriel preens as soon as they are both parked on the street and out of their respective cars. “Your parking spot is around back off the alley.”
by your arrival! The house has been empty for the past several years, so I've just been cleaning for the tours. But I always say, it's not a home unless someone's living in it!”
Dean sighs through his nose. “Of course she did. We're, uh, headed to a work gig of mine.” Noticing Castiel's doubtful face, he clarifies, “Not Singer Auto. I, uh... have a second job. Only a few times a year. Almost done, thank god.”
“He's... he's different, Gabe. He likes me, just me. I want to bring him back to Chicago,” Castiel announces.
He doesn't even bother with Dean's shirt, going instead for the zipper on his jeans and wrapping a hand around Dean's tented boxer shorts. They're damp, and Castiel wants to know if he's been like this since the restaurant. Dean's gasping and stuttering as Castiel moves his hand under the fabric, kissing his way back up to claim Dean's mouth again. He doesn't mind that Dean's already almost there, he's been dying to get his hands on the man for months, and he's not about to stop now. Castiel breathes praise onto Dean's lips as he comes apart beneath his fingertips, leaving Castiel's hand and Dean's boxers hot, wet, and sticky.
. She's sorting through the latest mass estate purchase, deciding which to keep for the secondhand shelves and which will be donated. “First edition!” she squeals, setting it aside. “Ninnies, the both of you! Just take the boy out on a date.”
“One of my jobs... I was one of those sign-flippers, the guys on street corners twirling advertising signs. One day, this lady pulls over and hands me a business card, tells me I could model,” Dean explains, shrugging. “I thought it was a scam, but Sam, only a freshman in high school and already acting all lawyery and investigative, looks 'em up and whaddya know? It's a legit modeling agency. The gigs paid more than my three other jobs
“Keys are in the car, Mr. Novak,” Jo concludes with a shit-eating grin. “Have a nice day!”
want to,” Gabriel says, handing over the single duffel bag Castiel has brought. “What if he's not worth it?”
would be.
Castiel is wearing one of his finest suits and pacing between the store shelves as he waits for Dean to pick him up.
“Maybe now I'll start,” Castiel mutters, looking at the dismal storefront.
Dr. Alder crosses his arms. “Yes, disconnected. Detached from your environment. Is something... bothering you?”
Castiel bites his lip. “Why not? I like you Dean, I like you a lot. And... I've been thinking about it. It would be good for you to come back with me.” Dean's expression blanks, and Castiel grips his hands tightly. “I have a nice penthouse apartment with plenty of room for both of us,” he insists, talking faster as Dean's face remains emotionless. “I go to a lot of functions and charity events, we'd get you some really nice suits... My family would love you. And you wouldn't have to worry about your ex or modeling. You wouldn't need to worry about school or working... or Sam's tuition, you'd never have to want for anything again.”
At some point during their mad rush back into the bedroom, Castiel finds time to slip the ring onto Dean's finger, assuring the man he has a matching one.
?” Dean snarls, not liking where this is headed.
So Castiel takes the rest of the afternoon off and returns home, staring down the looming bookcase. He doesn't have to read them all today, just start with one and work from there... His fingers trace the spine of
He jumps when he turns and finds Castiel standing so close behind him. “Ah, yeah, gotta lock him in the bedroom so he doesn't follow us. Ro hates when he gets out.”
Dean cants his head back when their lips slide together, and Castiel doesn't know if he's trying to get away or if it was just a reaction, but he keeps a hand on the back of Dean's neck, gentle enough for Dean to break if he really wants to, but firm enough to keep him in place. Castiel pulls him even closer, backing himself into the counter. Blessedly, Dean follows, his free hand carefully skimming Castiel's revealed skin to settle on his hip bone. Dean's touch is just as searing as he remembers, angling his face to slot their mouths together more deeply. Dean presses his entire weight against Castiel, and Castiel doesn't even care that the drawer handle is digging into his back. He melts into the contact when Dean licks at the seam of his lips.
Castiel's trench coat does end up on Dean's floor, discarded and forgotten with the rest of his clothes, Dean's too.
“Yes, well, that's...” Castiel has no clue how to finish that sentence, but Mrs. Butters doesn't appear to be paying attention so he lets it drop. She ushers them all inside, instructing the men to unload Castiel's luggage into the foyer for now.
It clicks.
later, and then he's heading for the entrance.
“Keep the heid!” comes a voice from behind the door. “No need to shout, but really, dearie, you promised me twenty minutes while you manned the shop–”
He doesn't see Dean until the week after Valentine's Day.
Great, and now he's thinking about steamy sex with Dean Winchester.
A wide grin splits across Dean's face. “I'll be disappointed if you don't.”
Dean gave Castiel his phone number.
“It's not money he hates, dearie,” she comforts, wrapping an arm around him. “I shouldn't go into much detail since it is Dean's personal history and not my place to share such things... but he's also a bampot who should have told this to you already.”
“I ran into some difficulties,” he growls, looking around for the way to the event.
Gabriel turns his mischievous eyes on Castiel. “Oh, she's a feisty one! I like her.”
, not in agreement, just
There's a small lot behind the row of buildings where he works; although getting in and out can take a while, depending on how many cars are trying to park or leave at the same time, he's grateful not to be parking on the street each day.
He has to interview potential replacements, although his siblings volunteer their help for most of the appointments. Castiel has to sell his penthouse, his cars, his furniture. The few things he wants to keep, mostly books and his coffeemaker, Gabriel offers to store at his place until they can be shipped.
He'd taken a very cold shower last night, the image of Dean in a suit plastered across his mind. In the end, it hadn't helped; Castiel woke from a dream involving Dean deftly unbuttoning that infernal waistcoat, harder and more aroused by one person than he could remember, not since his last relationship that had ended a few years ago. Fucking Dean Winchester and his fucking hot waistcoat and his fucking perfect cheekbones and sparkling eyes and beautiful fucking freckles. Castiel had masturbated in the shower, but his pants already feel tighter at the mere memory.
Laughing, Dean reigns him back in for another kiss. “Calc you later,” he promises against Castiel's mouth.
Dean smiles against his lips. “I'd like to try with you, too.”
“What? No, Cas, you're fine,” Dean assures, shaking his head. “This place is just... more than I'm used to.”
Dean slips from his grasp, rubbing his elbow anxiously. “But... why?”
Swearing, Castiel pulls over and gets out on the side of the road. Checking the trunk, he locates the spare and the proper equipment. He's never changed a tire before, but it can't be that hard, right?
His sobriety comes to a crashing end two weeks before Christmas, when his tire check light flashes on one afternoon.
in that flat but soft voice, the one Cas seemed to reserve solely for Dean. He must have mentioned it once, offhandedly said something like,
“I don't exactly make a point to look up my ex,” Dean retorts, attitude souring by the minute. He glances at Castiel's half-empty plate and doesn't give him a chance to respond. “You through? Good, we're leaving.”
“And to think you bought a bookstore,” she responds with a sniff.
“Erm, well, my last relationship... The man I was dating, turns out he only wanted me to elevate his career. Once he had that, he left.”
“All right, go on and scoot, you little newt,” Dean chastises, flicking Castiel's ass with a dishtowel.
Dean's hair is ruffled, his unclean clothes wrinkled, and the man yawns as he finishes stretching. Castiel fails to ignore the rippling muscles of Dean's arms or the sloping angle of the man's neck. The cat kneads at Dean's shirt, yellow eyes still fixed upon Castiel.
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Nah. Sammy got the brains in the family.” He winks at Castiel. “I just got the looks.”
Castiel closes a hand around his wrist.
He's looking around uneasily at all of the rich tourists, picking at his sleeves.
Castiel would prefer to knee the pretentious fucker in the groin, but he doesn't want to cause Dean any trouble. He's still trying to figure out a polite way to extricate himself from the situation when–
Castiel retreats to the kitchen, trusting Gabe to let himself in. Mercifully, there's some Aleve in one of the drawers, and Castiel downs two with a tall glass of water.
“He mentioned some of it, that he moved here to escape a persistent ex. But I didn't realize how bad it was,” Castiel says quietly. “What... What happened with Sam?”
my job, Dean,” he answers tiredly, though there's no real bite behind it.
“You know, a book collector, so to speak. Someone who hoards a lot of novels and likes the idea of reading them someday, but never actually gets around to it.”
Dean glares at her sharply, a caged, haunted look showing on his face that sets Castiel on edge. “You know I haven't,” he snaps. Dean hastily gulps down the rest of his water. “Why? Is she–?”
“Shit, almost forgot about those,” Dean replies sheepishly, relaxing.
Anxiety-inducing bridges aside, Galveston is not what Castiel would call an attractive vacation spot. Many of the buildings are rundown, covered with boards leftover from past hurricanes. The dirty, decaying houses are surrounded by new, colorful homes on stilts, and the result is an eyesore in Castiel's opinion. His headaches are supposed to
“Sooo...” The man grins at Castiel. “How about the Continental?”
Behind him, Sam chokes out a noise of disgust. “I
“Pretty sure you sounded
. Staring at Dean all gussied up in his sleek (if off-the-rack) suit, he's getting the most bizarre sense of déjà vu.
“You're welcome, Dean.”
Rowena smirks. “So you've mentioned.”
He almost mistakes the guy for someone completely different, but as Castiel rounds the couch, he recognizes the man's unkempt state and grease-smeared cheekbones. He's so put-off by the man's appearance, that it takes Castiel a few moments to realize what the man is
“Of course,” he concurs, slightly out of breath as well. “We should continue elsewhere. Your place? Or mine?” He lowers his hips enough to create the smallest amount of friction on Dean's legs.
“Howdy-doody, tootie-fruitie!”
“I thought you'd be more comfortable if I... stopped.”
“Oh. That.” Dean looks down at his lap and twiddles his thumbs. “That wasn't a date. That was... Ro was just doing me a favor by going to a work function with me.” Castiel tilts his head; a work event for the auto shop...? “I, uh, have a second gig,” Dean elaborates vaguely.
. The two women here should have joined them an hour ago, having closed the shop early, but Rowena is waiting to see off Dean, and Meg is just admiring the view. Castiel would have preferred Dean pick him up from his house, but Rowena demanded Castiel uber to the store so that she could have final approval on his wardrobe. As if Castiel doesn't dress better than every islander combined.
“Do you think we should have gone?” Dean asks again for the third time as he carries the champagne out onto the balcony.
With his brother refusing to go on a grocery run until his current translation is finished, Dean is stuck searching the empty kitchen for something to eat when Castiel finally reappears. Dean would swear the angel pops out of nowhere, and since that is impossible with the bunker's warding, he must have crept into the place on tiptoes for Dean not to hear anything.
“'S fine,” Dean disregards. “I don't exactly go around broadcasting that I'm a model.”
Gabriel does get credit for selecting a nice house, Castiel can concede as much. The home is a three-storied Queen Anne build from 1894, the wood exterior painted a pale blue. The multi-gabled roofline and overhanging eaves seem to be in excellent condition, one benefit of choosing a house on the Historic Homes list. While some may be put off by the limitations of not being able to personalize the house's exterior (or interior, for that matter), Castiel isn't at all bothered. Gabriel explained it to be an investment of sorts. Buy the house, live there for a year, and when he's ready to return to Chicago, Castiel can leave the dwelling in the hands of the city, sending them a check every year for upkeep and get a great summer retreat out of the deal.
Although he's not a Grinch, Castiel will concede he's not as festive as some. Luckily for him, the Galveston Historical Foundation comes along and decorates the house for the season. Even Rowena, who's declared herself repeatedly to be a summer soul, has decked out the bookstore for the holidays. Castiel can enjoy the enthusiasm of others, even if he's not gung-ho himself. He particularly likes the Dickens on the Strand event, and the Moody Gardens Festival of Lights, and although he attends neither, he still enjoys the idea of such things. Gabriel's words come to mind,
