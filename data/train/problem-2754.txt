Superglue is never, ever, ever used with any magic affecting brain function.
He tried to watch till dawn, but he fell asleep for a moment or maybe only looked away, and when he turned back, with the morning all around him, Sherlock was gone.
— which he could presumably have slipped in again to remove, once whatever was in the vial had taken effect.
The soldier nodded again, and stood. “Well,” he said, “thanks for your time.” He took up the little shabby book and replaced it in its envelope. “I probably wouldn’t have believed you if you’d said he was alive, anyway.”
The Warren Street tube station is on the Northern and Victoria lines, which are partially automated and
“Hang on, superspy, I’ll hunt up some pins.” John Watson closed the exam room door behind him.
He knew where the microphones and cameras were; there was no reason for Jim to bother to hide them. Still holding the syringe, Sherlock made a survey of the flat. All the red lights on all the devices had gone dark. Jim hadn’t planned for this.
He might have hours. He might have the whole night long.
He tore the used paper sheet off the exam table and rolled out a new one.

“Fucking hell,” John Watson was saying, “you could save the NHS a fair bit of money on diagnostic equipment and testing.”
Two weeks and a couple of days later, on a Saturday night in mid-September, Will Holmes, aficionado of art and assistant-to-be of the powerful and shady — although they didn’t know that yet — stepped out of the lift, let the double glass door of the Hove Gallery be opened before him, and made his debut.
Mycroft beamed at him. “Exactly so, Mr. Hareton.” The only pleasure to be had in any council that included the Foreign Secretary was that of making him think he had said the opposite of what he meant. As what Hareton meant was usually idiotic, this had the knock-on effect of improving the quality of the discussion. “I think we can all cite many examples of colonies geographically remote from the motherland.”
I was preparing to resume work on my monograph concerning the beetles of the Thames estuary when Mrs Hudson brought in my breakfast; on removing the lid from my bacon I found myself in possession of
Sometimes Sherlock leaves a strand of his black twining hair on the pillow. John may pick it up and hold it between his hands. Sensation in the thumb and forefinger of his left hand is diminished, because of nerve damage from his mundane shoulder wound. Spell injuries are meant to be more difficult to recover from — no qualified medical practitioner had been able to do much about the persistent icy ache in John’s right thigh — but on the night of the day they met, as they lay learning each other on Sherlock’s wide bed, Sherlock laid his palm on the part of John’s thigh under which ran the obdurator nerve. A feeling of relaxation and well-being flowed out from Sherlock’s hand; when John tried to describe it to himself later, the closest he could come was the memory of a massage his medical school girlfriend had given him once when he was in that sweet balance of drunkenness that makes everyone seem like a friend and that doesn’t leave hangover behind. John’s mouth fell open and he caught Sherlock’s wrist; “Oh!,” he said. “God, you — how did you do that?
“But — ”
He called Sherlock’s name. Over and over he called it.

Miss Winter smiled a little. “What a fine lady Miss de Merville was, and proud and educated too. But he got his hooks in her just as he did in so many low-born girls. I wonder, sometimes, whether her life might have been, in just one way, something like a lady’s maid’s.”
on which were printed the words “my first.”
How loud that word seems to John. A snatch of song lyric comes to him:
not human. Then I saw your face.
“Speaking of which,” Sherlock continues, his manner one of patient curiosity, “I was never able to work out quite why you left. Even if you don’t wish to return, I would find it helpful. If you could see your way to elucidating . . . ?”
“I misconstrued everything you said and did. Everything.”
Anderson smirks and doesn’t try to hide it.
Sherlock unlocked the door at Montague Street to find Jim seated at the kitchen table with a china cup steaming in front of him. He peeled the transmitter off his collarbone; the residue of adhesive itched. “Tea for two?”
Sherlock doubled over, retching, and put his hand over his mouth.
Sherlock’s
The speaker’s height, when he stood up, would be well shy of Sherlock’s own six feet. Of his clothes, Sherlock could hear Mycroft’s voice saying that they might be best described as decent. But his “Yeah?” had been purely rhetorical and his intonation was that of someone used to being obeyed.
politely called “disinhibited chatter” about various handsome celebrities’ charms and presumed inclination to fellate him. Now, seeing where Rockham’s gaze fell, Sherlock thought he would have been satisfied to take up any of the better-looking men on the invitation they absolutely weren’t giving. It was not pleasant to be grateful to Jim, but Sherlock was grateful that even if Rockham proved to find him attractive, sexual overtures had been explicitly ruled out: “His lays are good for six months, max,” Jim had said. “They’re fungible. You, on the other hand, are gonna be long-term and indispensable.”
but thinking, through his own distraction, that Sherlock must be something else entirely, a practitioner not just more powerful than others but of some different matter altogether.
. . . Still no?
“No,” Sherlock said.
But Sherlock is the quietest sleeper John has ever known; he doesn’t snore, or speak half-articulated words, or thrash or scream—though, John thinks, surely Serbia at least gave him cause enough for the latter. When he turns, he scarcely disturbs the covers. He is a water spirit. His sleep is as deep as Rosamund’s. A sanctuary. Only, if Rosamund frets, or if John says his name, he rises out of sleep as quick as a seal breaking water.

He had left the prepped syringe on the kitchen table. The laptop had gone to sleep so he touched a key to wake it. In the screen’s light, the syringe cast a low ominous shadow as if in an old-fashioned anti-drug movie — except no laptops in those, of course. Sherlock held the syringe over the sink and depressed the plunger; then he lay down on the bed to wait.
however, a military invasion is not on the cards. I believe Mr. Skeffings will agree with me on that point?”
John registered with surprise — over his nape, and down the other side, dropping to the grass and, like the raven and the fox, gone.
“Gray eyes, sharp cheekbones, fucking me for money so from one of the less economically powerful EU states. I thought you were trying to impress me.”

he reminded himself. “Thank you, Doctor.”
“I’m glad you think so,” Sherlock replied, with perfect truth.
; he would put this understanding together with the sense that something was, from my point of view, amiss in our intimate relations; and so a distance would grow, made of my silence, his hurt, the loss of ease between us here, in our bed, where (law or no law, church or no church) we sanctified our love.
“You don’t think that’s laying it on rather thick?” Sherlock said of this last, through a wave of nausea of whose source he felt unsure. Under the street-side window was, inevitably, a low table of pale wood on which were arranged three smooth black stones and a narrow glass vase with some bare black branches in.
and Rockham’s expression now was speculative ...

The flat is clean. It is neat. It is functional. John is clean and neat and he used to be functional, too.
The oldest child says nothing, because oldest children often find it wearisome always to go first. The middle child says nothing, but weeks have already passed since she privately began to feel strange about how quiet Beakley always is. The second-oldest child looks at the brochure, looks at Beakley, bursts into tears, and says, “We should take him there
The kidnapper/crime boss — this must be he — wore the Westwood suit that he could not (yet?) afford to keep his minions in — or, no; Sherlock revised the thought: he would always want to outshine his underlings. He sounded, as he had during the kidnapping, like an overenthusiastic florist, and his guards were terrified of him. Sherlock was, he had to acknowledge, somewhat alarmed by this fact, because what sort of a man was it who terrified hard men? — but also intrigued. He mustered his upbringing around himself and said, “To what do I owe our acquaintance?”
“Crikey,” she said, under her breath, and held the excised pages out to me.
“Let’s say Monday, hm? You can have the weekend to make your sad farewells.”
A long time had passed since John had been, to anyone but himself, more than whatever function he served or what condition he was in. What lived inside him began to lift and uncurl. “You — ” he began, intending to say
“No, not one of those. What, do I make different — ” But he can’t bring himself to ask what noises he made, and Sherlock doesn’t answer that unasked question. John tucks his hands into his armpits. The tremors had receded; now another one comes on. When it has passed, John says, “Do you ever wish you hadn’t killed Magnussen?”
“Since you cannot tell us,” Hareton said, “exactly how the Russians mean to carry out this alleged existential threat against us, then can you tell us what, precisely, we keep you in your exalted position
As for Holmes, he did not ask our visitor her name or her business; he only cocked his head, as if listening to a distant sound and trying to work out its source. I cleared my throat, but both he and the young lady preserved their silence. “Holmes?” I said at last; and, when he still did not speak, I turned to our visitor. “You have some difficulty with which Mr. Holmes can assist you, Miss . . .?”
John grabs at the arms of his chair. Perhaps he hasn’t spoken the words “Oh, God” out loud, because Sherlock only frowns;
which earned me, an hour later,
He offered me everything I wished for. I took all of it; I rendered it back to him; and in the years since, years of gift and return and gift again, have found myself in possession of such wealth as I could not dream of in the poor hungry days of Dr. G.M.A. Huche and Basingstoke.
The next time the spasms abated, Sherlock got up and went to the window again: civil twilight. There was still no mains power. Laptop, 7:08. The battery was down to 18 percent. He noticed that he was naked, which probably explained the shivering unless he was just having another bout of chills. He found the discarded towel, laid it over his shoulders, and resumed pacing. Time was a narrowing road; foolish, he had been foolish, passing this wretched night to no purpose. A fully charged phone, a wind-up clock, a whole bloody generator: one way or another Jim would have his organization running. In less than two hours the minion would appear no matter what the state of London’s electrical grid. It wasn’t nearly enough time for Sherlock to get to the point of being able to fake a damned thing. He lay down again on the bed and put his face in his hands; civil twilight became full day.
in every face he passed that evening; he sat looking out of his window for a while, trying to think how he might find Sherlock again, and at last laid himself heartsore to sleep.
“Ah, God, John,” he said. We may be in a hansom cab or even, God help me, conferring with Lestrade, and if some chance brings to mind the groans and pleadings to which our congress reduces him I can go almost mad with wanting him. He had bathed earlier that evening but the smell of him was strong now; it made me want to bite his thighs and fuck him, or frig him till he spent in my mouth and then feed his spend back to him in a kiss, or hold his head still with my hands wrapped tight in his black hair and make him beg to do more than touch his lips to my stand.
When the soldier had gone out, Sherlock closed up the shop and went upstairs to the flat. He ate the required supper, his last dose and his works laid out before him, trying to convince himself that it didn’t matter whether he fixed now or five minutes from now, as either way the next week at least would be horrible. Then he did fix, greedy for it the way one can be greedy to press against, to hold, the body of a departing lover.

He could leave London, but that possibility, unpleasant enough in itself, also left Jim permanently in possession of the means to convict him of murder. Strike that.
“Many of my clients don’t believe, at first,” Sherlock said. He knew he had a kind voice: several marks had told him so. “We don’t have a scientific understanding of the process yet, so I can’t blame them.”
’ Once they’ve been telling themselves that for a while, it’s practically their reason for being. And then what you’re selling isn’t any particular thing you do, anymore. Nope!” Popping the terminal consonant, just the way Sherlock sometimes did. “Now you’re selling time in your

John Watson’s tone was purely curious and in fact he was beginning to look delighted. Sherlock found himself answering more or less honestly. “An experiment.”
“It’s a puzzle,” Sherlock explains. “For you. To give you something to do, for a few minutes at least. You see, you push the paper aside to get your food out from under it. After you’ve eaten, you can tear the paper to bits and fling it about. Or you can do that for a break between courses, if you like. It’s to stop you going mad in your cage. Although perhaps you already have. I don’t know whether I can fix that, but I’m going to try.”
I quizzed Wiggins at length: From whom had he received the flour? When? Where? All he could tell me was that he had found it just outside the door of the room he shared with two of the other Irregulars, and that he had immediately brought it to me for inspection.
“I’ll concede it for the sake of coming back to the more important point,” Sherlock said, and retched again, briefly. “You made it clear, earlier, that you take an interest in my deductive skills. Therefore you’ve a purpose you want to put them to. That the purpose is criminal in nature is apparent. But what, specifically, is it?”

and he went on following the jacket-beacon. The jacket moved fast, threading through the morning crowds, northward now; though Sherlock quickened his pace to follow, Orange Jacket was only a flash here and there. Sherlock staggered, caught himself on a bollard, found Orange Jacket again, well ahead, near vanishing.
John clears his throat. “Yeah, uh. Obviously.” Hoping Sherlock hasn’t noticed, he tears his gaze away from what had been advertised as a four-poster bed but is, in actuality, a cot. Or, rather, two cots, pushed together and made up as one. “Bit narrow, that,” he says, and bites his tongue. Too late.
Your puns are as depraved as . . .]
Sherlock lays his hand flat along John’s sternum, to which he has easy access because this breakfast is taking place in bed, and which access he takes advantage of because John’s breast is solid and because Sherlock likes the valley between John’s pectorals, which are hairy to exactly the correct degree, in Sherlock’s opinion. The feeling of John being alive is also an excellent feeling. “I won’t steal it,” he promises. “But tell me anyway. Tell me about the house, just to try your memory. It’s good for your brain. You should do mental exercises, to keep your capacities youthful.”
“It's exactly as dull as you suspect it is,” said a voice in John's ear.
To the pensioner whose dog had wandered off on Hampstead Heath the previous month and not been seen since: “Cricket isn't lonely or afraid.” (Cricket had found someone to take him in, or Cricket had been hit by a lorry. It was possible, Sherlock supposed, that Cricket had been taken in by someone who shouted at him and struck him, in which case he might well be lonely and afraid, but that was no lookout of Sherlock’s.)
Many years ago, in a faraway land, there was a brave soldier.
he had thought though not in words, because those by then had deserted him. Then the boot landed and he, Sherlock, had not cried out but he had made a noise, not much of a noise, a noise probably inaudible to the shouting, laughing West Ham fans.
: Master of the Universe, in middle age. A slab of well-marbled beef, redder in the face than seemed consistent with healthy blood pressure, genial in the way that dissolved the instant anyone obstructed the least of his wishes — in that last quality, he resembled Jim. And a suit, of course bespoke, cut to just the same degree of flash as Sherlock’s good off-the-rack, because Jim  judged, probably correctly, that Rockham would notice the affinity and so identify Sherlock as, though lower-ranking, one of his own.
And then he made a sound — the soldier did: it was like a sound Sherlock remembered hearing emerge from himself, once, when he was on his way home from a night out with his velvet jacket over his shoulders and his lipstick smeared because he was with Victor and they had been kissing in doorways, tasting the marijuana smoke on each other’s breaths. West Ham had lost that afternoon, that was the trouble: “Aw, look at that. Hanging off each other’s necks,” Sherlock remembered hearing, and then there was an interval he didn’t remember but for a moment when he lay on the pavement and saw a boot swing back and then forward, toward him;
Sherlock reminded himself that if he wasn’t getting junk sick every time he went six hours without a fix that would make one less hold Jim had over him. One less puppet wire.
“Well, we talked for a bit — you made all those deductions about me, and yes, I  did take note on the spot of how clever you are — and then we walked here — Oh. Right. I helped you get up.”
Silence. Itching.
“Oh,” Sherlock says; “in short, these
Sherlock nearly replied,
Life went well enough, John supposed. The room he had found was smallish and darkish, overlooking as it did an alley rather than the street, but it was cheap. His weeks with the nurses had taught him how to clean a wound, change a dressing, mop a brow: he found a place with a physician. He liked the work — didn’t mind the smells, had the knack of working gentle-quick so as to cause less pain — would have liked to be a physician himself, he thought, but who would have an apprentice as old as he, with a weak hand at that? On his free days he sat in the best light he could find and doggedly, biting his lip, swearing in frustration at the hundredth, the two hundredth, the five hundredth futile attempt, taught himself to thread a needle in reverse, with his left hand tucked against his breast to steady it and his right hand bringing the thread in close. Even to keep the thread between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand was difficult: he had always used his left hand for fine work, before. When he could thread the needle on the first try nine times out of ten, he bought himself a piece of fine supple leather and a whetstone to sharpen needles with, and taught his right hand to sew. It went easier than threading the needle had done. “So I have educated you,” he said to his hand, in pleased surprise. He was mostly alone when not at work and had formed the habit of speaking aloud.
“And six. Splinter NATO, and it’s off to the races.
This question was insistent, its answer obvious. Sherlock chose to ignore it.
John sits down, hard.
Jim giggled. “It’s so spiritual!”
Sherlock says, “I always felt everything, John. I thought I was showing you that. I felt everything.”
Sherlock’s legs wrap themselves around John’s back; John brings his left hand down behind Sherlock’s thigh to stroke him and braces himself on his right elbow; “Come on, then,” he says, “I want to see.” Sherlock leaves off clutching at the blanket and latches on to John’s arms, opens his eyes to gaze directly into John’s face, only for a moment: he twists up and muffles a long cry against John’s neck. His fingers are going to leave bruises. John is savagely glad about this. He raises himself to wipe some of the come scattered on Sherlock’s belly and slick his own cock with it. Sherlock can be a selfish prat but, give him his due, he seems to regard sex as something that ought to be done at least as well as chemistry, or detection, or the wearing of closely tailored suits, so he’s deadly alert to everything John likes: with both hands, he reaches behind John to spread him and push against his hole, because there’s something about that combination of fucking into his own hand while his arse is held open, that feeling of being made visible front and back, that sends John flying wild faster than anything. It works on him now the way it always works, until he falls groaning into Sherlock’s arms.
He was never going to get away, and the best he could hope for was that when Jim was done with him the end would come with him kneeling somewhere anonymous with his hands tied behind his back, and a bullet to the brain: perhaps Jim had that much sentiment. Perhaps. It was much too easy to imagine quite different scenarios, most of which ended with himself as the subject of one of Jim’s home movies.
Jim wrinkled his nose and pushed at Sherlock’s filthy pillow, delicately, with the tip of his pointy shoe. “Junkies.”
If only he weren’t so bored.
Molly Hooper beamed from under her surgical cap, holding her sample of Mrs. Bronley’s liver aloft. “Oh,
Mycroft had said that to him, or he had said it to Mycroft; curiously, Sherlock could no longer remember which.
“Yes sir, Mr Holmes.”
Only, by the bedside stood a satchel such as a physician might use. Bandages; a flask of clean water; a velvet-lined case for half a dozen fine needles, scissors, and a whetstone; a spool of white silk. A separate case with stoppered bottles: spirits for disinfection; elixirs for cough, for fever, for pain. Sherlock, more alert now that he wasn’t struggling to keep himself upright, smiled at John. “Give me the willow bark,” he said. “Mistress Poppy and I had rather a long romance, and still feel the strain of parting.”
your interrogation technique.”
For a consultation lasting twenty minutes, one hundred fifty pounds.
Sherlock says, “But, if your facial immobility was a means of communicating strong emotion — ”
Nothing had happened that he couldn’t return from; he hadn’t done anything that he couldn’t return from.
Sherlock waited — Yes, there was the bright expressionless gaze. If you looked carefully at Jim’s face when he wore that look you could see right down into the pit.
John finally moves out the day he loses his magic.
“Yes, I do, but please regale me with an account of the workings of your mind.”
but Jim paused with his hand on the flat door. “One more thing. Your new boyfriend used to be a soldier, you said? Funny, so was that client you were so awfully kind to yesterday. Doesn’t seem like a coincidence, somehow.
Sherlock was dirty and junk sick and his clothing and shoes were gone. He did not often think of himself as valuing what the world called dignity. He squared his shoulders and looked at the newcomer. The spit on the back of his right hand cooled as it dried.
“So you better find someone to fix you up sooner not later, yeah? But it’s not going to be me.
48–49: “How I enjoyed Basingstoke’s pliancy, his gratitude for the sweet pains I could inflict! I bade him draw down his trousers and smalls and bend himself over the drawing-room table — it was low, so that in resting his head and arms upon it he perforce thrust his bare arse high into the air and, stretching his legs and thighs, made taut the skin. My breath quickened at the thought of how much more the blows of the crop would sting with my beloved victim in this pose. . . .”
Sherlock says, “And everything I have learnt about human demeanor and behavior suggests that you are telling the truth.”
“You want to know whether I was holding back? No. The present situation is much too serious for that. Walter Hareton is tedious in the extreme, but I need every scrap of information he and his minions can bring me.”
Miss Winter and her friend had remained in England long enough to see Holmes and me off to Sussex upon his retirement. She called in at Baker Street one day shortly before our removal to find Holmes out, attending a lecture on the recently developed analytical technique of “chromatography,” and me sorting through the materials from his old cases, deciding which to discard and which to keep — Holmes, having boxed up all the items of scientific value, had declared himself indifferent to the rest. As it happened I had just worked my way round to the year 1902, and therefore to the case that introduced us to Miss Winter. Holmes had kept the album by means of which Miss Violet de Merville was finally brought to her senses concerning Adelbert Gruner — why he had kept it, I don’t know; I suppose he hadn’t so much made a decision as succumbed, without giving the matter a thought, to his general magpie inclination to collect. The Baron’s “souvenirs” could do no more good to anyone and might, in the wrong hands, do harm to many. I set the foul thing before the fireplace, meaning to burn it.
“Oh! Will there be a rise in salary?” Testing the tightrope, testing — Jim glanced at him sidelong; had the rope just sagged? Sherlock winked at Jim:
Another knowledge —
The thaumatology consultant says, gently, “Your cast of Tranquilium was flawless.”

“A world of possibilities thus opens before us. Perhaps they will arm one of our more rabid racialist organizations. But with conventional weapons? Or, perhaps, with a biological weapon. Or a dirty bomb. They might mount a series of terrorist attacks purportedly by adherents of the group pleased to call itself the Islamic State, for example. Or they might facilitate a series of actual such attacks.
Mrs. Ellison quiets the instant the pain fades; her face, which had been screwed up in animal misery, goes soft.
Sherlock was exhausted, and in a general and chronic way frightened, but specifically, in this clinic at this time, no one was looking for him to make a misstep and no one had any intention of killing or hurting him, or of killing or hurting anybody else. It was so easy to sit in the black vinyl chair and lean on the doctor’s desk, letting the sounds from the corridor drift past him; the fluorescent light from the overhead fixtures had an unpleasant effect on color if you had nothing to distract you from it, so he shut his eyes and just listened to the people walking back and forth, their exchanges, some of which were followed by a laugh or a short mock-disbelieving exclamation; “Oh, absolutely,” someone drawled. Gossip, gleeful but without malice. A metallic rattling approached and then receded but whatever was on the cart made no sound that Sherlock could hear. Plastic instruments or cleaning supplies in plastic bottles or toilet roll. . . . The morning’s fix wasn’t yet wearing off but the thought that after today there would be no more made him want to at least look at the remaining doses. He could open the kitchen drawer where he had left the packet, take it out, hold it . . .
If the skin of an animate was cut or punctured, the animate bled, as the animate killed at the Ladies’ Bathing Pond had bled. Circulatory system human-like, then?
“Because,” Sherlock said, fascinated now, “the movements of your left hand as you tie off the suture are coarser than the movements of the right, as one would expect if you were right-handed. Yet the deliberation with which you use your right hand to insert the suturing needle and draw it through suggests that that hand is not naturally dominant. A doctor with your years of experience would not normally have to give such careful conscious attention to an everyday task when using his dominant hand. Finally, not only is your motor control deficient on the left side, but on close scrutiny it becomes obvious that the shoulder is stiff.
“As for you: you like her well enough, but as you might like any other household convenience, and you like novelty; you’re tiring of her presence in your bed, otherwise you might not have dismissed her so readily to talk to a complete stranger who, after all, is trying to sell you something, and salesmen are such a bore. But I recommend that when you dismiss her as your arm candy you make it your business to find her a permanent post. Foresight, realism, an eye for the significant detail: she’ll do well almost anywhere. She may even be grateful to you, in which case you’ll find yourself in the unusual position of having succeeded in buying someone’s loyalty. Congratulations.”
For that matter, why did he drink down the contents of that vial without hesitation?
“Stay,” John said, and kissed him.
Attempting to attempt suicide at the Warren Street tube stop. Lycra Louts. Torn trousers. Isn't it supposed to be the
Better to look as though fixing were not a matter of urgency, or to act in accordance with what he and Jim both knew? Probably there was nothing to be gained by any show of resistance. Sherlock began assembling his works.
John Watson was beaming. Sherlock thought of setting his hand on John Watson’s nape, of how his fingers would rest against the curve of John Watson’s occiput. He looked away.
John Watson drew in his breath. “Sure.”
. . . and in the next moment the attackers had vanished, the roof had vanished, Sherlock had vanished, and John was looking down the moonlight road of his fever dreams; he thought he could hear hoofbeats, fading, and hounds baying, far away. He was alone.
“We can increase our scrutiny of goods shipments,” Mycroft said when he considered they had had sufficient time to meditate upon the drawbacks of totalitarianism. “Subject, of course, to the same resource constraints as universal surveillance would entail. But as we have no inkling of what we’re looking for, or whether, indeed, it will arrive in material form . . .”
Between patients at the clinic, John tells himself he ought to cut his losses. While he waits for whatever takeaway he is bringing home of a Friday night, he tells himself he ought to cut his losses. While he and Sherlock are fucking, John thinks
“I was.”
The empty vial of counterpotion rests in the inner breast pocket of John’s donkey jacket. He hadn’t taken the jacket off when he sat down, since he had no idea how long he might be staying. It’s bunched up uncomfortably behind him, but he’s still unsure whether he can presume so far as to take it off and hang it up —
“Oh no no no no. See, Will, what you’re forgetting: the marks
“I didn’t say there was nothing we could do!” Dr. Wiesner turns to her laptop and pulls up the web page she wants. “Here. And I’m owed a few favors myself, you see, so I think we can persuade them to take in a bird on short notice.”
What was left! Nothing that John could use, surely. He unwrapped the scrap of bandage that held the serpent’s scale, and turned it over and over. Sherlock’s breathing was labored; a week ago he had whispered, “You see, it’s just as I knew it would be,” and since then John had not heard him speak.
I had opened my hands in assent — assent also to the revelations now inevitable — when, to my vast relief, Holmes raised a finger admonishing me to silence: he had heard Lestrade’s foot upon the stair.
There was a pause while those present contemplated the examples of East Germany and of the USSR under Stalin.
Someone else, speaking from the same elevation as Sherlock’s ear, put in:
Holmes had written this:
— they had planned for the Iraqi friend to immigrate to the UK but then the Iraqi friend’s visa didn’t come through and didn’t come through and the soldier’s tour ended and then Daesh took Mosul and in between raping the women and shooting the men who failed to grow beards they found time to do a pretty good job of rooting out the, the, you know, anyone they thought was gay or whatever (it was wonderful, Sherlock had time during all this to think, how people believed that if they surrounded the important word with a flotilla of words that did not matter, the important word would somehow become inaudible yet also retain its communicative power) and throwing them off Mosul’s remaining high buildings or the most convenient cliff and the soldier hadn’t heard from his friend in fourteen months, could Sherlock tell him anything.
“Keeping me around for a bit longer, then?” Sherlock asked, as lightly as he could manage. It was past eleven; the delivery would have arrived an hour ago, on a normal evening, and the first whispers of anxiety had begun drifting through him. He looked around the room. There, on the counter.
“To harden you, you mean.”
When some hours had passed in silence, the skin over Sherlock’s breastbone began to itch. He was bored and restless, and he could smell himself. An armchair stood in the corner diagonally across from the bed. “Any difficulty with my sitting over there?” he asked, without rising. The guards ignored him, so he sat up. A pair of black leather slippers stood just where he would have put his feet on the floor. Sherlock frowned. He kicked the slippers aside and made his way to the chair. The itch had migrated to his left arm; when he scratched there, it returned to his chest. He jiggled his leg, seated himself more comfortably in the chair, drew his right knee to his chest, brought his left knee up to join it, rubbed the fingers of his left hand against his thumb, wiped the sweat off his upper lip. He was growing more and more bored. It wouldn’t do to ask the guards for a top-up, though; it was one thing for them to see him bored and restless, another for them to learn that they had any leverage over him. They had no leverage — he reminded himself of this; there was nothing he needed, or even especially wanted.
Aspects of Animatio had never been well understood, and never would be, since no one can legally cast the spell. Why, for example, did even badly sculpted animates have the usual distribution of body and head hair? Why did they appear to have the full complement of human internal organs? “Appear to,” because, as recent scholarship has pointed out, no one had ever performed surgery on an animate; animates could not be autopsied, and as no animates now existed, modern imaging technologies had never been brought to bear. The fact remained that animates ingested food and produced excreta (but what happened in between?); that a stethoscope — or an ear — laid against an animate’s chest picked up what sounded like a heartbeat, and that what felt like pulses appeared on an animate’s body exactly where a human pulse would appear.
The hounds of the Wild Hunt snarled and bayed, and the horses drove fast behind them, shaking the earth. The cloaked riders sought their prey.
“That is remarkable,” Holmes owned, after a moment. His interest was up, I saw — indeed, he was practically vibrating.
he thought, which was easier than thinking about how he had apparently brought a knife back with him from his dreams. He sat on the side of his bed in the morning light and studied the engraving on the black blade: a feather, worked in detail so fine he could make out the individual strands of down at the base of the quill. Suppose he had touched Sherlock’s black hair, would it have been as soft as the feathers on a raven’s breast?
I withdrew my hand from his mouth and crawled backward until I could lie with my head between his thighs; he raised his legs at once and rocked up, the better to expose himself. “If
“Just — go ahead.” The speaker frowned down at the cadaver she had just slit, breastbone to pelvis. The room smelled of meat and Thames, but neither she nor her visitor paid the stink any mind. “I’ve got to take samples from Mrs. Bronley here. The folder you want is the one with her husband’s name on it, I got his tox screen back yesterday, oh, well, of course, he came in last week — ”
Jim's Montague Street building exists only in my imagination, but Google Street View shows one near the Russell Square end of the street that looks like an annex to the building just south of it, and that, conveniently, would be perfect if it had a shop window punched in the facade. This makes me unreasonably happy.
He retched again, and as he straightened, wiping away the reflexive tears and the string of thin bile-tasting spittle that depended from his mouth, the door opened. The guards had been alert, before; now their eyes widened, their posture stiffened; the one to the left side of the door tightened his mouth and glanced sideways, toward the man who had just come in — who gave Sherlock a finger waggle and said, “Wide awake, I see!”
man, he was a phantasm. He was to be forgotten.
Then, seeing that it is not: “Consider why you beat me, John: you were ill with grief, and terrified, and you felt betrayed. Whereas Smith killed people to amuse himself. He could never have felt betrayed by anyone, because he didn’t love anyone, do you see? He was not to lord it over you. No matter what you had done.”
he thought, warring stupidly against himself,
“Goodbye, Beakley,” says the oldest child.
John pinches him.
Holmes had opened his mouth — I got him to admit, later, that he was about to describe a complicated stratagem of his own devising, which, he had satisfied himself, Miss Winter must have used — when we realized that Mrs. Hudson, who had been dusting the bookshelves, was laughing.
It’s difficult to believe that Sherlock sees anything different, but Sherlock has always understood John otherwise than John understands himself. When they first met, at a time when John believed that there was only a dying ember inside him, Sherlock had breathed on the ember and brought him blazing into life. John makes a hash of their friendship, of marriage, he thinks he makes a hash of fatherhood as well, but Sherlock is steadfast. Over and over he has shown that he will stop at nothing to shield that flame. Therefore John goes on.
?” She pointed to herself. “And you know there are matters of which women will speak only to other women. — I could be valuable to you, Mr. Holmes.”
The consulting room was as bad as the waiting room: it was set up like a psychotherapist’s, with a chair for a single client, a sofa should clients arrive in pairs, and a bookcase full of titles most of which seemed to include the words “Zen,” “Living,” or “Hope.” Sherlock had considerable confidence in his acting abilities but was nevertheless relieved to see no scrying ball or deck of Tarot cards.
When John tired of evenings spent wondering what had become of his life, he walked. From one of the crumbling warrens where the poorest lived, and the smells of rotten cabbage, river water, night soil crowded the air because the streets were never cleaned, you could pass in the space of a few minutes to a quarter busy with louche establishments — places where the sap of poppies could be bought, or women, or for that matter men — and thence, in a few minutes more, to a grandly lighted boulevard along which sleek horses bore their even sleeker riders toward entertainments John could only imagine, as he could never afford to attend them: formal balls, with velvet-and-silk-clad dancers cutting geometrical figures over polished marble floors; performances by esteemed instrumentalists, the audience silent in awe; sumptuous meals, course after course after course of terrapin and lark and suckling pig —
“No — well, never mind; it was a fancy, merely.”
John laughed at this and shook his head. “Caught me,” he said.

There was no way reliably to die by jumping from a first-floor window, not even if he flew headfirst.
“Are we friends? I hadn’t noticed.”
I pointed out that the riddle, having eight parts, was not yet complete.
“My cane,” John Watson said, setting the last pin, “is lying in the gutter across the road from the Warren Street tube stop, isn’t it.” He sat back in the chair and looked straight up at Sherlock. His eyes were sparkling.
Accidents with Superglue are unusual, but not rare, and they tend to be catastrophic; there are always research teams working on ways to reverse its effects. Triskaidekotonin itself is also the subject of intensive research, like the trial John’s thaumatologist got him enrolled in. A fair few experimental potions have gotten as far as clinical trials, and all have failed. It’s ridiculous to imagine that Sherlock Holmes, working alone, should in the space of five months have succeeded where experts,
The door chime had not gone off and Sherlock was not at all sure he had been able to keep his face impassive; he thought wishfully of the delivery man’s blankness; but then, to the delivery man, Sherlock never came as a surprise. Besides which — but he arrested this train of thought.
She wore a crystal of amethyst on a chain around her neck, so he inquired about the state of her aura. In reply, she told him all about her dead ex-boyfriend. He had used to drink, you see, and then he’d get rough with her; she didn’t like to call the police, at first, but then she did, and they arrested him, which she felt a bit bad about, really, though it was a relief as well, but then he got out of gaol and the first thing he did was to start in drinking again — meaning, the
(“I’m not doing this anymore,” Victor had said. He was still in hospital. Sherlock only had a broken wrist and one cracked rib, and wasn’t. “You’re just — I don’t know why you have to be such a fucking queen.” So that was that.)

Before 1906 was out, Miss Winter had become Holmes’s acknowledged apprentice — acknowledged among us, that is. She had taken the surname Emerson, but even so it was necessary to keep her out of the public eye: during her trial, her name had been on every scandal-monger’s lips, and the sensation-papers, whose readers would have been thrilled to hear of the “Female Holmes,” would have swarmed her and soon uncovered her past. Holmes’s wish to retire a few years later presented a conundrum, for neither of us liked to see him withdraw his aegis and leave her without a means of earning her keep; fortunately, his brother Mycroft stepped in. He had connexions in Boston; armed with letters of introduction to them, Miss Katherine Emerson and her friend removed to that city, where she set up a consultancy of her own. She and Sherlock continued to correspond, from time to time also exchanging telegrams when she sought his advice on a case.
How easy it was to lift the latch of the cage around the John-shaped beast; a finger’s touch could do it.
Toward evening he began to vomit. He puked and sweated and shook and cramped all night and by Tuesday morning he had given up on cleanliness or dignity and was fully occupied by crawling between the toilet and the nest he had made of his duvet and pillow on the floor just outside the bathroom. A few times he had made it as far as the tub and run tepid water over his head, drinking some too and even managing to keep it down. When Jim appeared he was mostly upright, with the duvet mostly over his shoulders, so at least he was spared Jim finding him sprawled naked and shaking on the filthy tile. He had been drooling, however. He wiped his mouth on a corner of the duvet and said, “Well, what brings you here?” as cheerily as he could manage, which wasn’t very. He was chagrined and this feeling in turn reminded him that he did, in fact, value his dignity. Pity he had none anymore. But that had been true long before today.
knocking, lightly, under his skin. Once he was clean it became more obvious how very bad indeed he must have smelled to Jim and the suit-clad henchmen. Perhaps he ought to do some laundry.
“Interesting,” Sherlock said. “This may be the first time I have ever attracted a hiring director. Tell me, what is it you think you’re hiring me for?”
She had chosen the spot that gave her the best vantage of the waiting room as a whole. But instead of watching the door through which W. S. S. Holmes, Spiritual and Practical Counselor, would emerge, as one might expect of a prospective client curious about the person she was about to pay, she had trained her gaze, and with it her full attention, on the street door. She had been chewing her lip; at the sound of Sherlock’s voice she shot halfway out of the chair.
“And hence your interest in the
Yet he remembers that cold, impassive face, signaling the indifference of Sherlock’s heart.
The back of his head was wet, but only with water — gutter water, though, because it had rained heavily overnight, and with miniature flotsam in; he would almost rather have had the wetness be blood, because the sight of a head injury might have brought an end to the shouting. “Yes,” he said to the owner of the loud voice, “yes, I understand that your bicycle could have been damaged by its impact with my left side, but as you're abusing me in the conditional I gather it wasn't. Go away. No,
even if that miracle had happened, he’d never have been able to decide, morning after morning after morning, for as long as Jim owned him — for the rest of his life, that meant — not to throw himself into the sanctuary-by-the-dose brought helpfully to his door sometimes even before he had brushed his teeth.
she said.
“Fuck’s
“And suspicions will be high on the Russian end just now,” Mycroft said. “Try not to lose anyone too valuable, will you?”
He was going to have to quit using, eventually. Every junkie knows he has to quit eventually; it’s only that as fast as the date approaches, so quickly it recedes again.
And then it's as if John's thoughts, taking step by step along a familiar path, miss their footing and he finds himself — his understanding — thrown into the air and spinning. He lands, torn, on one day, like poor Mrs. Ellison’s hand snagging on that sharp bit of metal: the day on Hampstead Heath when he began, in earnest, to give up on Sherlock.
“Bye, Beakley,” says the next-oldest.
said, but it was the old beggar-woman from our street who stood before us, and whose voice we heard.
He tried to keep himself awake for a while at night, after he fixed. Between the fear and the lack of exercise, this was less difficult than one might have expected. His bed stood under the window and the nearby buildings were taller than the place he inhabited; if he fought sleep long enough, and if any of the people who lived in those buildings were still up by the time he lay down, he could watch the lights in their windows go out one by one. Sometimes human figures were visible, moving or standing, passing in and out of the lit rooms, silent and untouchable as the stars, which from this angle Sherlock couldn't see at all and which, though he thought of them from time to time, he did not miss.
A crumb of sorrow in John’s heart also lifts its wings and rises, waveringly, higher and higher; and higher yet; and then it is gone.
Not a day goes by that John doesn’t think he ought to leave Sherlock. On mornings when he wakes alone in their bed he turns his face into Sherlock’s pillow and tells himself to cut his losses.
“I don’t think my tales of your exploits ever attributed to you any opinion concerning woman suffrage,” I said.
In the stinking tent that housed so much pain, the soldier named John Watson lay fevered and near death, and he was dreaming. He found himself in a landscape of black earth and sharp black trees in moonlight. He stood by the side of a great empty road, waiting, as one might wait for the stage to arrive; but there was no stage; and still he waited, watching the road. He did not understand how he knew to watch in one direction and not the other, but he watched . . . Hours passed, silently, and still John Watson watched the empty silent road.
John used to want to accomplish things. He wanted to make hurt hurt less; he wanted to heal wounds, to make an impression, to change the course of events. He isn’t even angry at Sherlock anymore: you might as well shout at a cliff face and expect it to change. But, at home in the evenings, John is always aware that whichever room he is not occupying at the moment is empty. Maybe, he thinks, he should have looked for a bedsit after all.
“Yes, but — you’ll love this, the GP had
He had expected to nod off, after his restless night, but the jitters took him over; the options were to pace the flat wringing his hands or to go for a walk. A walk offered at least the possibility of distraction, but the choice of where to go was beyond him. He could have tossed a coin, heads north tails south, if Jim had ever given him access to cash.
When John had lain in the tent, feverish, after he took the shoulder wound, his dreams had been simply what came; he neither wanted nor didn’t want them, more or less as he neither wanted nor didn’t want anything else. He had accepted the raven’s feather, the fox’s whisker, and the serpent’s scale in the same way, without questioning them or marveling over them.
Set up a proper lab. Conduct experiments without relying on Wiggins’s unreliable — and now entirely unavailable — good graces.
said the snake.
“What?” Sherlock said now, slow on the uptake because his gut was cramping and he had retched bile half a dozen times on the pavement outside Wiggins’s door.
Yes, the delight you express whenever you make some new discovery concerning me is endearing. There, I have admitted it and I hope you are satisfied.]
“To cast Animatio,” Sherlock says, sounding personally offended by the information, “is not difficult. Yes, yes: the creation of life or at least its semblance” — a barely audible pause here — “weightiest implications of magical practice; humility in the face of same, et cetera. But the spell depends on the identical principles, somewhat elaborated, as the basic spell for establishing an electrical charge that is taught in secondary school physics. It’s

These came to another six hundred and thirty pounds, and in view of the understandably unexpected additional expense he would drop his fee for the actual exorcism from nine hundred pounds to seven fifty — well below the standard rate for these things, no, no, there was no need to thank him; he was glad to be able to do it; this was, after all, a helping profession.
Sherlock thought, approximately, that under other circumstances he would be worried about being taken by people he didn’t know to a destination he hadn’t been apprised of, but the great gift of the poppy was the sure knowledge that
So, then. It was for Sherlock’s own good, what John did. Everything up to that moment. Then the beast roared out.
Sherlock smiles at him.  “It’s rather crowded in here; will Watson sleep through the rest of the night, do you think?”
Learn a language in childhood and you can speak it without conscious thought; but it doesn’t follow that someone who carefully and awkwardly speaks a second language, learnt for the purpose of communicating in the land to which he has immigrated or been exiled, is therefore lying. “I thought I was like a pet to you,” John makes himself say. “Or, not even a pet. A toy. And then the toy got broken.”
The practitioner occupied in inventing the impossible spell had eyes the color of cloud and moonlight, and a mouth that needed John to bite it. His shirt, John wanted to say, could not have been fitted so closely by merely physical tailoring.
Animates might run fevers. They sustained injuries and healed from them. They got sick; they got better, or they didn’t. An animate that partook of spirits would behave as if drunk.
is always terrific, but with this chapter she went above and beyond. To the extent that you find you're not reading two thousand words of info-dump, thank her!
Sherlock glanced at him. “Oh?”
Having moved on from the fungi of Aberdeen, I was deeply absorbed in the geology of Wales, with specific reference to the Jurassic limestone along the Glamorgan coast, when Mrs Hudson once again admitted Wiggins, this time bearing, of all things, a flask of water. This too was accompanied by a slip of paper, tucked into the neck of the flask, and bearing printed words: “my second.” Not from
“Any attempt to make of the UK a colony — ” Here the Foreign Secretary broke off.
There were three reasons why he had not yet escaped: The difficulty of getting heroin. The wish to avoid starring in one of Jim’s videos. The evidence implicating him in Niall’s murder. Three reasons: so he had thought; it hadn’t occurred to him that with the gaoler holding open the door of his cell and bowing him out, a prisoner might hold fast to the thought of enclosure, the thought of how he might fold himself up with his arms wrapped around his legs and, as long as he did what he was told, he would be safe.
, ever since it first occurred to him that perhaps, perhaps, just as Sherlock offered clients and witnesses a series of false selves, so might the self Sherlock offered him, John, be shammed. The Sherlock above him in bed, in evening half-light sent fluttering by their bedroom curtains, pressing his mouth against John’s neck: that Sherlock, was he real? Sherlock had a hundred or a thousand lying smiles; what of the one he gave John, the sweet small joyful one: could John repose his heart against that joy, would it give way to genuine contempt? When John wasn’t there to look at Sherlock and to hear, what expression did Sherlock’s face wear then, what did he say?
“Oh, no, no, go ahead. Like I said, none of it probably means anything.”
At last he felt, through his booted feet (but was he not lying in a tent, barefoot and naked?), the slightest of vibrations, like the roar of a distant tide; then the tide drew in, closer and closer, until the black earth rumbled beneath him. Until the earth seemed to rise and plunge like ocean. Surely, he thought, he ought to hide, but there was nowhere to hide; the dream trees had vanished and he stood exposed upon the plain. There were no colors in the moonlight.
Camp again: “Oooh, so he does. Just a bit, Sebby, don’t take chances.” Feet shoved into the seat well, shoulders shoved against the seat back, safety belt
One night in October the lights went out. All of the lights: in the office, in the flat, from the streetlights, and when Sherlock leaned out the front window to look up and down Montague Street, London stretched black before him. It wanted five minutes till eleven; he could have prepped his dose in the absolute dark of a cave a mile underground, anyway, and the light from his laptop screen should be enough to find a vein by.
“Ah!” said Holmes, with his characteristic look of eager inquiry — mixed, just now, with amusement.
“Three. Russia is conducting military exercises near its borders with the Baltic states.
“You note it with smugness, you mean. Also, you’re lucky that cane was a cheap one. — Okay, then, tell me how you worked the rest of it out.”

“Well, no, I don’t know, it might be, I guess? It’s just, every so often something about a case bothers me, so I make another file for it. You know, not official or anything, just — bits and pieces. Probably nothing, most of the time.” She took up the forceps from the absorbent pad where she had set them and used them to reach into the dead woman’s torso, biting her lip.
“But you won’t find that,” Sherlock put in, “because we’re not. Here’s my card; do your worst.” He nodded toward not-Melinda, and then toward Rockham, and turned to go.

ran through John’s head, and he felt as if someone had drawn a needle through his heart.
Always, Sherlock had been oblivious of John — of anyone — when busy with an experiment or drawn deep into a case, but now, if John manages to catch his attention at all, Sherlock will look up and watch him blankly for a while, then, just as blankly, turn away again, as if no one were there. Really, as if neither of them were there, it seems to John.
useful for understanding Russian anxieties about NATO and the desire for a buffer zone against the West.
“Really,” Sherlock says, pinching apart the placket of his pants and, with great delicacy, drawing out his cock and balls, “is that your chief concern at present?”
But John does imagine it. He does.
I bet you’d love to go for a walk.”
The cart is full of vials of newly compounded mundane medications and, also, potions. Among the potions is the inhalant everybody calls Superglue because it makes the effects of certain spells and potions permanent if administered within a few minutes of casting or ingestion. Superglue is normally transported in a padded sleeve, to prevent accidents exactly like the one about to happen to John, but someone was in a hurry, it seems. A vial falls off the cart and shatters on the floor.
He wakes at the thin end of the night, a week or so afterward: his chest heaving, his face wet. This happens sometimes. Rosie smacks her lips and then falls into deeper sleep again, so when John realizes that tremors like punches are running through him, he gets himself into his dressing gown and goes downstairs. The nightmare keeps its hold; partway down the stairs he has to pause and repeat assurances to himself. The reality had been bad, but not
The blood had vanished and the snake was whole again; John was no longer surprised by this.
— a little weird, that’s all.
“You should stay,” John said. “Keep off that leg while it heals. Can you — ”
he had asked; the answer, half heard, was drifting into vapor, but he snatched at the memory, and caught.
In any case, the notice that caught my eye that happy morning proved to be of the greatest interest to both of us: it was an announcement that plans had been put in train for the rebuilding of the area around Holywell and Wych Streets, and that demolition of the existing structures was to begin the following spring.

I hardly dared draw breath. Hope had begun to beat wild in me.

The night of the quarter moon, Sherlock cried out in his delirium; wide-eyed, he gripped John’s shoulder and whispered, “You see, it’s just as I knew it would be,” then fell back, panting like an animal pursued.
There have been many such instances.
“Certainly we have
Sherlock pulled it the rest of the way over to himself and rested his palms on the lid. Perhaps his thoughts showed on his face again, or perhaps Jim was only addressing the obvious idea that anyone in Sherlock’s position would have had, because Jim said, “Don’t bother trying to cheat the keystroke tracker,” and played a sound on his phone: not one of the sounds from the video he’d shown Sherlock already.
“Well,” Sherlock says, raising his head like a dog responding to a scent far outside the human olfactory range, “it’s fortunate you’re not a large man —”
Jim stretched out the corners of his mouth, waggled his fingers, and was gone. Forty-five minutes remained before Sherlock was scheduled to close the shop; it was enough time for the sweat to dry from the small of his back, but his hands didn’t stop shaking till he was upstairs and tying off his arm.
It was rather like living in any other serviced flat, apart from the surveillance, and of course apart from Jim.

Sherlock makes the How Dare You Call Me a Drama Queen face, and shuts up.
In short, it was an ordinary happy evening, made even happier when Holmes, as he so often did, confirmed my heart’s choice by demonstrating his essential courtesy and kindness. In recent days an old beggar-woman had taken up residence at our corner, where the deep doorway of an empty house afforded her some meager shelter; my friend had made it his business to look out a refuge for her, and on this evening, as we passed her on our way to dine, he pressed into her hand a paper bearing its address and a sum of money that would feed her for many days.
as opposed to any other user in London, had also already been answered, by the conversation about his wallet. Someone knew that Sherlock could deduce things, therefore wanted Sherlock to perform that service on his behalf.
Delia Smithson made an appointment for the following evening at eight, when Sherlock promised to have some preliminary results for her. The front door had barely shut behind her when a whole-body tremor took hold. When it was done with him, he was covered in sweat. The time was 11:15. Late, late, late. He took the stairs to his flat two at a time, stumbling. It occurred to him as he dropped into a chair and tied off his left arm that in making his mental picture of the flat he had omitted all his gear.
He lay on a narrow cot in a tent where the air stank of wounds that had gone foul, and of shit. He was one of about — depending on how many had died overnight, and how many more had arrived — two dozen. Some of them never stirred. Some of them twisted this way and that, clutching at the rough sheets that covered them. Women went among the cots offering all the comfort available: cool cloths, and laudanum. Swish, swish was the sound of the women’s dresses, but you could scarcely hear it amid the stertorous breathing and the gasps of men trying to conceal their pain, amid the gasps and sobs of men who were past such false dignity and only hoped to live, or not to.
The question put me in some difficulty.
“It totally is! Just remember” — Jim pivoted and stepped in front of Sherlock, stopping him in his tracks — “you can run away from a lot of things, but you can’t run away from yourself
He never received any reply; but in the following February, when the Act came before the Lords, Curzon refused to speak for those in opposition. With its opponents thus demoralized, the Act passed by a vote of  134 to 71.
The red-eyed hounds howled past him, dark against the dark earth, with the moon glinting off their backs; the horses drove past him and he saw that their hooves never touched the thundering earth. A horn sounded. “I am in the land of Faerie,” John Watson told himself. What poor creature were they hunting, those cloaked riders?
“No.”
“You’re not going away for a bit; you’re leaving,” Sherlock says.
John puts up a hand. “No, let me — let me say this. I — First, I saw you practicing, facial expressions and so on, trying to learn, I guess, and I thought, I thought that meant you were just faking all the — the feelings that those expressions came with.
but such is my case, and such is that of Sherlock Holmes, with whom I am so fortunate as to share my heart and my bed. Or perhaps it is he who shares his bed; such minor questions of title do seem to grow muddled over time.
Exasperated, but fond. In the time before he came to believe that Sherlock felt nothing. Tears prick. John runs the tap till the water’s as cold as it will go, measures exactly 250ml into the cylinder, and opens the vial of potion.

That afternoon I took tea with Mycroft at the Diogenes Club. In the evening, I played the Nocturne through two or three times and was able to find it satisfactory.
John has bloodied Sherlock but never left a lasting mark. Nowadays Sherlock may bear a bruise at his hips where John has clutched at him, or the print of teeth where John has worried at tender arousable flesh. Sometimes at these moments, which are the moments when he himself is most bared to Sherlock and in which he is telling his love as well as he is able, John can see all the way down inside himself, down to the bottom, all the way to the pit of fire. The view brings him up short, a scratchy blank instant as if a musician had forgot his notes. He’s pretty sure Sherlock notices, but Sherlock never says anything. His hands are always careful on John, the way they were the first time he held John properly, cupping his head while he wept. John can’t remember whether he had begged forgiveness then. But Sherlock had already forgiven him. Even in the moment, Sherlock had forgiven him; and there’s Rosie. Sherlock is John and Rosie’s refuge; they are his. So John keeps watch, after his nightmares, while Sherlock sleeps. And often, John’s happy. He hopes that Sherlock is, too.
So Watson had suborned not only the chiefest of my Irregulars but also our landlady. There was one possible means of retaliation, and that was to pre-empt his telegram. Accordingly, I sent, express,
Macdermid sighed. “Well, I’ll do what I can to rebuild the lost networks. You know, though: the quicker an agent is introduced, the likelier it is he’ll be rumbled.”
John nods, because that’s easy; then, weary of himself, speaks aloud. “Yes.”
Monday was as he had known it would be.
but the thought doesn’t prevent him from crying out in shocked ecstasy. Sherlock comes, too; Sherlock also makes noises; but Sherlock’s face, when John steals a glance at it afterward, appears uninhabited.

The sixth day of Watson’s absence was a Sunday, and Wiggins did not appear. This was owing to the fact that a Benevolent Society had taken an interest in him of late; the interest was not, strictly speaking, mutual, but one of the benevolent persons had a daughter for the sake of whose

The first shiver had come early on, the first false note struck. Barely perceptible, really . . . John had spoken sharply, that was it, annoyed by — nothing much: after an unexpectedly weary shift he had been longing, his whole way home, to sit at the kitchen table with his head in his hands, and milky tea steaming in front of him; he could taste the tea, could feel the ease of

He was named Duane Oliphant. He was in his mid-thirties, he wore a wedding ring, his face was drawn and gray. “You have had a loss,” Sherlock said gently —
arrives on the third day, which is to say that Sherlock somehow incorporated a TKDT-replenishing effect into the potion. John has forced himself not to try any spells in the meantime, but self-discipline isn’t the same thing as calm and he has been sleeping more poorly than usual. On that third morning, he walks into Mrs. Ellison’s room with her breakfast and finds her curled up and whimpering around the bleeding index finger of her right hand: a ragged cut that’s left a trail of blood back to the bedrail where there must be a bit of metal poking up. Poor Mrs. Ellison has reached a point of dementia at which she doesn’t speak or even understand words anymore, so there’s no soothing her by telling her that help is on the way. John casts Make-it-better before he remembers that he isn’t supposed to be able to cast anything.
Sherlock says: “I thought perhaps the potion was such a gesture as might make that clear.” A pause. “Before you left . . . At the scene with Galatea, I saw at once, from your reaction in particular, that I had misstepped. It was because of the revulsion, you see, that all the histories take such care to mention. I thought it best to make plain how remote from myself I found her. I, human;
Watson arrived at about noon, a day earlier than we had expected him. “Well?” he said when the cabman had set down his luggage in our sitting room. “Did you enjoy my riddling?”
Holmes and I both like to think that his letter had something to do with that outcome; but if we are to be honest about it, then we must admit that Miss Kitty Winter’s hand it was that guided his pen.
John opens the door.
Behind his right hand, Sherlock closed his eyes. Fadil must have left traces of himself while writing on the rough paper: molecules of oil from his skin; if he had held the page close and kissed it in farewell, the damp of his lips, his mouth. The soldier could touch this page, and that was probably as close as he would ever come to embracing Fadil again. Presently Sherlock uncovered his eyes and folded his hands in his lap. He said:
“can we sit?  I need to tell you something.” John led them to the chairs around the table in the kitchen. He held sherlock’s both hands in his own and looked down at them for quite a while before he inhaled loudly and looked up to him.
“I promised I would.”
John walked to his hair beside the bed. “they’re fine. Good. I’ll bring rosie to see you soon. “
Sherlock’s eyes closed and he decided to give in. he felt john dropping a gentle kiss against his forehead. And he thought he heard a whisper.
Mary went pale at john’s words. But john wasn’t done. Everything he had kept bottled up for some time came out rushing.
He was being released from the hospital today.  John was doing the paperwork. Sherlock had changed when john came back with a wheelchair. Sherlock still couldn’t walk for too long but when he saw the wheelchair he recoiled.
Sherlock came to suddenly, everything from last night crashing into his memory. He opened his eyes and slowly turned his head to john’s face, afraid of what he would find there.
He filled another glass of water after finishing his own. Sherlock was the most light-headed middle aged man john knew and if he didn’t hydrate he’d have a royal hangover tomorrow.
“I know I know.”john falling to mary’s chair with his face in his hands.
Sherlock had an odd look on his face. He didn’t know what his expression meant. “can I ask why?” his voice careful.
John made his way out of the cab after paying trying to keep track of the plastic bags of grocery. He put the bags near the door and checked his watch before getting the key out. Weird how sherlock never asked for it back. He was twenty minutes early but the sitter had taken rosie and there was no point in sitting in his own house waiting. He could not tolerate peace and quiet for long these days.
“what was it about?” he asked mostly to distract himself. “do you want to talk about it?”
“sooo I got thinking… why would you do that much for her smile but you wouldn’t even give me a chance. I mean I was there before you even got married, you didn’t even have to cheat on your wife. now I’m sure you find me attractive. and It can’t be the gay thing you were all over sholto in your own wedding. So that left me with this question.” Sherlock finally locked eyes with a frozen john. “what’s so inherently wrong with me?”
“I was just checking up on rosie… heard her over the monitor I didn’t want to wake you again.” He said his eyes boring in sherlock’s soul. He nodded his understanding.
John looked at him expecting him to be talking to sherlock but he was looking directly at john. He hadn’t picked up on it before but he felt the anger now. it was interesting how the only thing he felt was gratitude at him for being sherlock’s friend and watching out for him. He’d liked it more if Greg wasn’t trying to set him up with a hot Italian guy, but who was he kidding. He had no right… no right at all to anything from sherlock. Hell he’d even tried to make him get to Irene Adler yesterday.  Although that didn’t come out the way he really meant, it didn’t change what he said.
“good that’s good. “sherlock said quietly. “maybe I could help you …. I mean after a while…only if you like…I could help to keep her when you need to work… with Mrs. Hudson nearby of course.”
“didn’t get much sleep last night?” he asked.
He felt the mattress dip again before a hand was touching his shoulder.
“okay. Alright. I must admit it would be much easier for me and mrs.hudson could look after her if a case came up unexpected. I know she’s not our housekeeper OR babysitter. But I guess…” he trailed off about the practicality of this choice and Sherlock could barely contain his glee. John was coming back and already planning on how he would tag alone with him on cases.
Sherlock opened his eyes seemingly surprised to see john still standing there.
“you cheated on your wife with eurus because of her smile. You were ready to throw away your perfect life with your family because she smiled at you. “   sherlock was still not looking him in the eye. But pain was pouring off him.
“I don’t …” Greg stammered, his expression softening. “I don’t hate you john…I understand that you’ve had it so difficult these past few years…I know that... I was there for all of it ... but I’m not gonna let you take it out on sherlock anymore.”
“night”
“hey do you mind watching her for a few hours? I have a short shift today and was wond…”
Sherlock nodded and turned back to the window. John took take of rosie on his own when mary had been gone but he had rarely ever stayed the nights in baker street.
John looked uncertain. “do you want to?” he asked quietly.
“it is but I need you to get some rest. Before we do more of this. “
John settled on the couch deciding to have a read before actually sleeping. But he couldn’t focus through the tangle of thoughts in his head. He wanted to apologize. But an apology seemed so ridiculous for what he had done.  Besides, what would he say? Sorry I was an arsehole? If anyone had done what I did to you, I would’ve killed them? It all sounded empty and meaningless.
I enjoyed writing this very much. I hope you enjoyed reading it too :)  comments are very appreciated. :)
The next day john opened his eyes and glanced in sherlock’s direction as usual. Today was Saturday. He couldn’t spend all his day here. he had to go home some time. it took john half a second until he saw mary at the foot of sherlock’s bed.
he didn’t want to blame him, especially now but he couldn’t help it. He also couldn’t help hate himself. John was selfish to bring rosie back to the world of criminals and murderers just because he felt empty without it. Just because life with sherlock was the only thing that ever made him really happy other than his daughter.
“hey… you don’t have to worry about it.” John said with a determined voice. “I’m moving out as soon as you feel better and don’t need my help anymore.”
“john… wake up it’s okay you’re alright. You’re home.” At this his eyes fluttered open and took a few seconds to find sherlock’s in the room.
“okay time for bed I guess. I’ve left the baby monitor with rosie so she’ll be fine “ john was looking uncomfortably around the flat. “ I think I’m gonna sleep on the sofa… you know in case you need me.”
“I will NEVER hurt him again like that. I’m going to therapy…I’ll…I’m working on it.” John didn’t know who he was trying to persuade more, greg or himself.
“I don’t want to impose, you know. You never asked to be woken up by a kid’s cry in the middle of the night. “  john said like he was stating the obvious.
He was staring at his girl and not mary, like he was trying to ground himself.
“john I love rosie” he blurted before he could stop himself. He had to try.   ” and if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather live with the two of my most favorite people in the world rather than alone. “
“sweetheart you need to be a little quiet, we don’t want to wake sherlock just yet.”
“then may I ask what? My landlady wouldn’t have let you up if you were a client so you either have told her you’re a relative or a friend. She knows most of our friends so either an old friend or a relative. Which one then?”
“I’m FINE.” Sherlock said loudly. Greg narrowed his eyes at sherlock at that but seemed to let it go for now. Sherlock tried to stand up while huffing to himself and both john and Greg moved to help him.
“brother mine, I’m delighted to see you awake.” He said with a fake sneer. But Sherlock knew better. His brother was genuinely glad that he was relatively fine.
“that’s a beautiful family picture there mr holmes. I guess the tabloids have missed the fact that you’re raising a child with your old friend. “he said with a smile that didn’t touch his eyes.
“the roof of barts. “ sherlock continued. John frowned in confusion. He was not expecting that.
Sherlock was becoming aware of movement that was dragging him out of his dreamless slumber. His room wasn’t lit much but it wasn’t pitch black either.
“what what’s wrong? where is he?” he blurted out panting.
*******************************************************
“it was nice seeing you mary.”Sherlock stood up slowly.  “Give my love to Watson when she wakes up. “ mary hesitated then put her arm around sherlock in a quick half hug. John tensed next to him.
“she smiled.” Sherlock said suddenly very sadly.
“Sherlock… mate… can you open your eyes? “ greg said with hope apparent in his voice.
“I love you too.” But that could have been a dream.
“It’s probably your bloody case that actually woke him up” he joked.
“Well mrs.norbury,” Mycroft said. ”I must admit this is unexpected”
(See the end of the chapter for
********************************************
“how much longer Mycroft? “john asked looking at Sherlock going paler by the second if that was possible.
“I don’t know john he was shot in the lower abdomen...I…we can only hope…”
“okay sherlock can you stand? I need to wash your hand before checking it. “  sherlock turned up his head and nodded. Wondering what john was thinking now. was he already cursing himself for getting back to 221b and having to clean up his messes again? Or was he regretting ever considering putting his daughter in his care now that he couldn’t even do the simplest things on his own.
*****
“sherlock can you press my hand?” john felt his ever still hand tense in his palm. A sob made his way out of his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“God sherlock. You’re awake.”
“thank you. For coming back. “he whispered just loud enough for him to hear. And then he pulled back picked up his bag and left without another word.
“oh “ he just said. But he pulled back and rested his arms on sherlock’s hips.
“so what changed your mind?” john asked quietly.
Sherlock nodded with his tentative smile.
John did the easiest yet hardest thing he had ever done. He put his hands around sherlock’s face and pulled him down for a kiss.
Sherlock was looking at him with narrowed eyes and a tilted head. Scanning him. The familiarity of the act made john smile but when he realized what might be scanned he stopped smiling.
“not for now. We will monitor him closely for a few days.”
“because I saw it… finally…that we don’t work. And I didn’t want it to work anymore. “he sighed deeply. Maybe it was exhaustion but he was lightheaded and didn’t have the energy for filtering his thoughts. “you’ve been shot twice now and both times because of her… I wasn’t gonna stick around for a third time. “
“Happy to do so mate. I’m sure you’ll find him at least interesting. “ lestrade said seemingly unaware of the turmoil in the room.
……………………………….
“Sure yeah” john tried to smile. “I would really appreciate the help. Thank you sherlock. “
“you were gone… I … I thought…” he couldn’t finish his sentence. But john seemed to know exactly what he had thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
“so you can go home right ahead greg thanks for everything.” John said with a serious tone as he was putting away the last of groceries that nobody asked him to buy.
the morning after
*****************
“RELAX DAMMIT” sherlock shouted. “just going to the bathroom not to shoot up… you can calm down.”  Greg got up anyway and hovered behind him while sherlock made his way to the bathroom through the kitchen. His movements were slow and careful and every low “hiss” that john thought he heard from the man, made his heart sink lower and lower.
Greg nodded but he didn’t look completely satisfied.
“thank you” john said.  “for everything.” Greg nodded awkwardly before leaving.
sherlock drew a deep breath. He never wanted to see john miserable again. he made a vow to himself to always try and make him at least smile if not laugh his ridiculous adorable giggle. Oh how he wanted to kiss that smile. They both leaned in at the same time. Apparently john was thinking the same.
Another hour had passed when sherlock’s surgeon came out the door and john jumped to his feet.
Not good ... not good... miscalculation... she is cornered and wants revenge before going to jail. Sherlock had underestimated her. Before Sherlock could do or say anything she pulled the trigger. He felt a white hot pain ripping through his shoulder.
“yes thank you. I’m sorry I’m just curious why all of a sudden you have decided to visit a friend of your boyfriend. “ sherlock asked casually sitting in his chair.
Sherlock’s heart was beating against his throat. He nodded and john’s lips were on his one second later. This kiss felt different than last night. The intensity and hunger in john’s kiss was making electricity spark in sherlock’s heart all through to his feet. John was running his fingers through his curls and pulling him further towards himself. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from moaning in john’s mouth.
“drink up, you’ll thank me tomorrow.”
“what? “ John stopped and looked up at him.
Images of sherlock shot, sherlock bleeding on the sidewalk, sherlock sitting on the floor obviously distraught after smashing the coffin, sherlock holding a gun under his chin… john stood up throwing his phone on coffee table.  He raked his fingers through his hair pacing in the familiar living room now dimly lit by the kitchen lamp and the low light coming from the street.
At this sherlock’s breath hitched. “but you need to promise me… to hold me accountable for whatever I  do…and I promise I will do the same. “
“Now come on be sensible” said greg in a convincing voice behind him.
Rosie squealed angrily at being carried away from her circle of toys but sherlock snuggled her closer to his chest.
“Actually you couldn’t be more wrong. “ Lestrade said hesitantly.
“he’s out at the moment.”
John wanted to cry. Sherlock was sprawled under him looking at him like he was the sun and the moon at the same time while his eye was still bloody the stitches still in the eyebrow.
John was here to stay...sherlock was over the moon for a moment until he said that he’s here to give mrs. Hudson a break. Like he needed a baby sitter for the night. Like he had enough of a reason to want to get high right now that john was here… not even just for the hours that he had agreed with before but for the whole night.
……………………………………..
“hey.” Said john with a grimace. “I’m so sorry I left my phone on the couch last night… I … the alarm…it’s not too late yet… good thing they’re not antibiotics… “
Lautner still avoiding the chairs looked long at sherlock without answering.
hope you liked it :)
“… your weapon.” Sherlock made the words out over the pain that had taken his body. “… hands in the air…”
John gently washed his hand and sat him back down on the tub. he was checking for any forgotten shards in his palm, when greg left the bathroom.
“it’s alright.”sherlock realized his hand was still on john’s shoulder. He pulled it back reluctantly. Then just to have something to do he stood up with his wobbly knees and brought a glass of cold water back for john. Who was still following him around with his stare. But accepted the glass and drank it at one go. Water trickled down his throat joining the beads of sweat. sherlock couldn’t help but stare.
Before he knew it john leaned forward and put his palms on each side of sherlock’s face. He had no choice but to stare back at the dark blue eyes. His mind had drawn a blank page and his heart was racing. John closed his eyes and he felt his warm lips touch his own. It was a sweet gentle kiss and before he could react or start to take in the details they were gone.
John’s voice seemed to have left him completely along with his ability to form thoughts. But good thing was that sherlock wasn’t asking him to answer.
Sherlock was trying to catch up. His muscles weren’t exactly obeying his orders and keeping his head up even for a few minutes were a struggle. He had some delightful exercise to look forward to get the use of his body back. But his mind had more important things to think about. John was getting a divorce. Sherlock couldn’t tell him exactly the reason of his guilt. He could accept he was not the reason of their separation but the joy he felt in the deepest darkest part of his heart was real. And it made him a disgusting person. But john was getting a divorce and he had to try hard not to let hope take much space in his beaten and broken heart.
Sherlock didn’t dare to move. John had him tangled in his limbs and sherlock was enjoying it too much to move a muscle. For the first time in… ever, he felt happy… he felt safe and warm inside his battered and abused heart. The heart that was healing already.he felt home. It had started when the octopus around him, started kissing him and washed away his pain.
"In my wedding to John. Would you do me the honor of being my best person?" She opened her eyes and studied his face. He was serious.
"Like what?" Greg took the final drink of his coffee and took his plate to the sink. He just stood at the sink looking out the window.
'Ok. -Sigyn'
"Ok, mark down the cards you have. Don't let anyone see your cards or paper. We take turns rolling the dice and moving our pieces. Once you're in a room, make a guess. Who you think committed the murder and what they used." Mycroft and Sigyn just stared at Greg.
"You always seem to exceed them" she turned back to finish her sketch of her father and Greg only to find her father on his back. He was obviously deep in thought.
"Rosie really wanted a horse and this way I still get to train him. It made her so happy."
"I've played all my cards but one. Once you place your card down I'll have won another game." Mycroft was more than a little annoyed. He played a card and Sigyn placed her final card. She had won.
"Do you mind if I turn on the TV? A rugby game's on"
"I love you. I love you so much. Man, I had a whole speech and now I can't even remember my own name. Screw it!" Greg got down on one knee and pulled the box from his pocket.
"It seems my mind had been changed for me." She smiled at Greg. Sigyn grabbed the life jacket.
Sigyn was brushing her horse, Mattie when a little voice distracted her. She turned just in time to see Rosie running though the barn. Rosie jumped into Sigyn's arms and wrapped her arms around Sigyn's neck.
"Always. Hi, Uncle John." Sigyn hugged the ex-army doctor and smiled when Rosie gave a squeak between them. Sigyn lifted Rosie up and placed her on Mattie's back. Rosie grabbed the reins and squealed with delight.
"I think your daddy is waiting for you just outside" Rosie held out her hand and looked up at Sigyn. Sigyn smiled and grabbed the five year olds hand.
"I take it you ate my leftover chow fun." She only looked at him before
"Uh, right." Greg took a big gulp of his wine and whipped off his mouth.
My goal was to make my sister cry with this chapter.
"He's a complete idiot." Sigyn rolled her eyes and went back to the kitchen. She got a serving bowl out and put the freshly drained pasta in it followed by the sauce from stove. She gave them a good mix together. She pulled the bread from the oven and salad from the fridge. She took the pasta bowl to the dinner table. John was saying something about coat collars and being smug. Sigyn went back to the kitchen and got the salad and some dressings. In the few seconds it took her to grab the bowl, John was now complaining about the mess his flat was in. Sigyn placed the bowl on the table and grabbed the bread from the kitchen. When she walked back to the dinner table, John was listening the things he loved about Sherlock. Sigyn sat down and looked at her father.
"Would you mind if I stayed and watched with you?"
"I'm sorry, what?"
"You said your name was Jean."
They finished their meal in silence and cleaned up. She was drying her hands when Greg asked,
"So Greg, when are you gunna propose to my father already?"
"So you don't drown. When you wear this you float."
The strange man put his bag in the hall and jacket on the coat rack. He turns to a camera in the corner and gives it a wink. He walked into the kitchen and came back with a sandwich and water. He sat in the chair away from her and started eating. Her father will not be happy that this man is eating outside of the dining room.
"Holmes? Myc? What's going on?"
"I'm not a guy"
Thousands of results were found. The most recent was a murder that involved a man having choked on a piece of meat and being a strict vegan. It ended up being his neighbors who was angry about the victim's garden coming over onto his side of the fence. The doorbell rang and she only assumed it was lunch. Greg had paid the delivery guy and was putting the pizza on the table when she reached the bottom of the stairs. She sat at the table and waited. She surveyed the table and found more then just pizza. She saw a bowl of salad, different types of dressing, a bottle of soda, glass, plates, utensils and of course the pizza. Greg sat next to her and smiled. He grabbed the plates and started serving the salad.
Yes I used some of Sherlock's best man speech in hi vows.
"Please call me Greg. It's nice to meet you too, Sigyn"
'The driver will open the door. I'll have a another copy made for you.' Before she finished reading the message the driver had the door open and bags inside. She thanked the driver and closed the door.
"Let's play."
"Ugh! Fine! I'll find out how he feels before you ask. Ok? If everything is fine you propose, if not just wait a bit. Ok? Feel better?"
"Do you want a special room?"
"Go back to sleep," Greg nodded his head and rested his head on Sigyn's.
Getting as close as he dare he got to hear the most perfect good bye speech from a man that has said those words much to much in his life.
"I have multiple degrees in multiple fields! I defuse possible wars! I run the whole of England! I will not be defeated by a game made by Parker Brothers and designed for children!" Greg leaned over and whispered to Sigyn
"I forget, thank you Mattie. I have nice ride" she patted the horse and left the stall. Sigyn gave Mattie some grains and met Rosie outside the stall.
"I know he will. The only thing is, I want to take a gap year and when I go to university I do not want to study international affairs like my father."
Mycroft put down the serving utensils and reached into his pants pocket, pulling out a plain blue box. Inside laid a beautiful silver ring. It had a single row of five diamonds. The diamonds laid at an angle. Inside it had the engraving of 01/18/17. Sigyn could do nothing but smile. Both men were on the same train of thought. The only question left was, who would ask first?
"Did you say something Sig?"
"Long way down, not even a soft landing. I can help save you, if you let me."
"One for you, another for me, and the last one is for" Greg looked at Sigyn who had tears in her eyes. Greg stretched out an arm and signaled for Sigyn to join them. She joined Greg on the floor in a tight hug. Mycroft was at a loss of words.
"You mean my nightmares? Then yes, yes I do" he raised his head from his hands to look into the Doctors eyes
A light piano music started playing to signal for people to find their seats. It didn't take long since most of the guests were in the wedding party. Sherlock's parents sat on the right and John's on the left. John's sister even made the journey. Greg walked around a corner and straightened his jacket. He had on a black suit, red shirt, black tie and purple pocket hanky. He winked at Sigyn and walked down the isle.
"I now pronounce you husband and husband, you may now kiss the groom." John raised himself up on his tiptoes and grabbed Sherlock by the collar. They kissed as the crowd cheered.
Sigyn picked up her flowers and took a deep calming breath. She walked down the isle and stood in her spot. She was more than a little pleased that she didn't trip. Rosie made her way next. She emptied her basket of flower petals and sat next to Mrs. Hudson.
"Why didn't you ask my father to be your best man?"
"Is your father here?"
"That brother of yours solved it in a matter of hours."
"I'll deal." Greg handed Sigyn the deck. She shuffled them and delt out seven cards each and a discard. Greg played first. Than Mycroft. The game had began.
"What type of dressing would you like?" There was ranch, Italian, thousand island, balsamic vinaigrette, Caesar, and blue cheese. She never really cared for blue cheese. Her father loved it for some reason.
Moments later, the TARDIS was on the roof of Bart's. He opened the door to see a panicked trench coat suit wearing, curly black haired, tall thin English man staring at a body. Pulling his sonic from his pocket, he walked up behind the thin man. The body laying flat on the roof was a man that had slicked back dark hair, intelligent brown eyes, a slight chin stubble, looked to be in his mid thirty, was dressed in a fine suit (looked to maybe be a Westwood), a gun in his left hand, and for some strange reason he was sporting a sinister grin. Noticing the pool of blood starting to form under the head, the Doctor knew he didn't have to scan him to confirm he was dead.
"I'm fine Greg."
"Yes but it's the first time you called me that. You only ever call me Sigyn."
"Where is Rosie?"
"Do you have a reason for entering my room?"
Sherlock could feel a tear weld up in his eye. How could he hurt his best friend? His one secret love, the only one to see his vulnerable side. With a stone face he turned, passed the Doctor, and walks into the TARDIS.
"Sherlock doesn't appreciate the beauty of these magnificent animals." Just then Sigyn's father walked up behind Sherlock.
"What's wrong?"
"I'll marry you, if you marry me."
"You did this in half an hour?"
"Yes sir."
"I actually graduated early and am planning to take a gap year."
Greg gave both horses some oats, fresh hay, and clean water. When he was done he got a saddle and bridle on Mattie. He then got a bridle for Gladstone, the yearling was not happy about that. Greg tied Gladstone at the front of his stall before he mounted Mattie. He guided Mattie towards the entrance of the barn grabbing Gladstone's rope before they left. As they rode he kept it at a slow pace, giving Gladstone encouragement along the way. After about two hours, he returned the horses. Once they were back in the appropriate stalls, he started the grooming. He brushes out their hair, checked their shoes, and gave them an apple as a treat.
"Yes, Gregory, I am. Thank you for noticing. I do know how to cook, I just don't do it to often."
"Welcome home, love." Greg responded in a whisper back.
"Well in all fairness he is a Holmes, by definition..."
"I arrived on into this plane of existence almost 16 years ago, arrived to London yesterday, your flat 10 minutes ago, and I have been inhabiting your room for two minutes."
"Is there a specific reason you knocked on my door?"
"Ya. My head and body still hurt. I haven't vomited since this morning. I'm still tired."
"But this is a different night! What if he says 'no'? What if he thinks we're moving to fast? What if I ruin this great thing we have?"
"May I voice my opinion?" They nodded their heads.
"Welcome. Welcome. What brings you to our lovely shop today?"
As he shakes his hand to ease the pain, he points at River,
"Fine." Greg and Sigyn cleared the coffee table of any and all evidence of Cluedo. Greg brought the card game to the table as Sigyn refilled everyone's drinks. Sigyn was drinking water along with Greg. Mycroft switch to wine after the second round.
John continued to complain about Sherlock as they ate. Sigyn simply blocked him out. She was in her own world when her father's voice got her attention.
They finished the rest of the meal in almost complete silence.
"She is my daughter and I see nothing wrong with her riding and having a horse." Sherlock's face fell. A look that could only be described as heart break consumed his face.
