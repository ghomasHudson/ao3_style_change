Sherlock grins all the way to the bedroom. Can’t remember being this happy since that first day, when John had ditched his cane and chased him through the streets of London without a moment of hesitation. When finally, after years of searching and even more years of resignation, he had found the one person who accepted him unconditionally. Who didn’t run screaming at the eyeballs in the fridge, or balk at his too-forward deductions. Someone who truly saw him, and amazingly, liked what he saw even when Sherlock couldn’t see it in himself.
“I really thought Mary was the one.” He sways on the bench for a moment before grabbing onto the side to steady himself and slouching down. He turns his head upward, gazing into the sky as if the answers he’s searching for are somewhere within that eternal darkness. “I just thought… i dunno what I thought.”
Sherlock just hoped John was not an idiot. At least not about this, at least not tonight. He had tried to show John over and over how valuable he was to him, asking for his input on cases, even commenting on that ridiculous blog. Tonight, he had made sure to specifically ask for his help, certain that he wouldn't be able to refuse. But he hasn't heard a word from him, not even an "I'm busy".
18:37. His phone pings and he grabs at it, hoping it is John saying he is on his way. Instead it is Mycroft, no text, just a picture of a man sitting on the bench near the Thames. He expands the picture and looks closer, realizing with a start the man is John. And that he is holding a whiskey bottle. Only a few sips missing though, this isn’t necessarily not good, maybe John had just wanted to clear his head with some fresh air. Never mind that a blizzard is expected to hit later that night. He deserved a drink after all he had been through.
So Sherlock took the dull case, he took lots of dull cases. And instead of arresting the woman immediately, or during any one of the 17 opportunities that were available to him throughout the day, he dragged John to stake out her apartment when he knew she’d be at work. And when her military brother happened to invite some of his friends over, he had decided that would be the perfect opportunity to waltz in and announce that s
It still hasn’t, he reasons with himself, hard as it is to form rational thoughts while Johns body is pressed so close, his hand on his neck, his tongue continuing to explore, his lips softly forming whispers of groans that reverberate throughout Sherlock’s entire body and make his hair stand on end. The only reason this is happening is because John is lonely, depressed, and drunk out of his mind. He simply wants human contact, and Sherlock is relatively that. Also the only body available at the moment. John probably won’t even remember in the morning.
He realizes John has paused, now is probably the time to try to offer support and comfort. That’s what people do after all. But while he’s still contemplating what word choice would be appropriate, John opens his mouth again.
Galax is extremely enthusiastic about being pet. It isn’t that surprising, John thinks. It’s not like these creatures are constantly showed affection by, well, anything on this planet. It continues to make John feel like he really is the only one who can even interact with them! John wonders for a second whether or not these creatures can interact with each other. Surely there are more than just one cat-like creature roaming around, and what about all the other creatures he sees? He’s never been alone with more than two surprisingly, but when he goes out into the fresh, more accurately polluted, air of the city, he sees a literal highway of creatures above him. A lot of the creatures swooping down and flying into the different shops. Some even ride on the huge creatures in the sky, looking down at the people below as they rock side to side with the movements of the ship sized creatures. It’s truly fantastic to look at which causes John to usually bump into people because he’s too busy admiring the system going on up above him. The creatures seem so different from each other that John starts to think they’re from separated dimensions but he absolutely loves the idea that they’re all from the same place. It inspires him to paint what their world might look like, their space, their planets or planet. Maybe they have their own cities and history similar to humans, but he accepts that he’ll most likely never find out the real answer to that.
John continues to stare, mouth open, until he finally finds his vocal cords and says, “The creature!”
Sherlock decides to move some of his stuff out of the way, and rests his head against his arm, the desk stable beneath him as he allows himself to catch up on all the sleep he’s been missing.
It looks up at Sherlock throughout this entrance and jumps, squeaking in a more annoyed fashion. Sherlock is able to snap himself out of his trance and carefully moves his hands towards the creature, his fingers eventually touching the soft bristles. It immediately curls into Sherlock’s touch, its bright, orange body rolling onto its back to reveal a neon green tummy.
The man is drawing the being before him. The orange being whom is laying on his back probably taking a nap. The man is able to see it. Like John can.
“But how do you know they don’t just travel here? It’s not like you have a written copy of their schedules. You said yourself they don’t like you much. And I sure haven’t been able to communicate with them even with my several encounters.” Sherlock looks extremely annoyed, though John thinks if he wasn’t paying attention he would’ve missed it the slight change in his companion’s face.
A strange being, the size of a kitten, that is. Its fur resembles a star-dusted, patch of space. Quite bewitching; Something to get lost in. Noting every small detail decorating its petite physique. The moment John feels himself slipping back into unconsciousness, he reluctantly looks away from the enticing lure of this ethereal being. Whatever it is. John has always seen strange creatures roaming around, never truly being noticed by others. John, as a small child, was always told it was his overactive imagination. However, as he grew older, the unusually small beings were as present and clear as possible to him. He can always see every small detail of these beings from up close or far away.
A nearly gray slime floating in the air rather than staying on Sherlock’s nose and cheeks. He loosens his hold on the creature as he watches the gray bubbles slowly climbing upwards into his roof before disappearing. It takes Sherlock a minute to fully come back to his senses and he starts typing even hastily than before, accidently dropping his little squeaker onto the faded blanket he had put over his legs to save money on the heating bill once the chill had started to really bite at him.
“Brother dearest, you're mind has been slipping more and more lately and I'm beginning to get worried.”
“What do you mean, ‘relationship’? Don’t the creatures bother you too? I just met this cat today and it hasn’t left since.” With this confession Sherlock returns John with his own strange look.
Jolting awake, Sherlock’s brain realizes it’s morning as the brightness of the day shines smugly into his eyes. Trying not to go blind, Sherlock maneuvers his hands until they find the drapes, throwing them to the right, effectively blocking the rays of destruction from hitting his abused pupils.
Being slightly distracted that morning, his usual routine took longer as he goes over everything from last night for the millionth time. However, he forces himself to stop after he spends 10 minutes brushing his teeth. After getting dressed, he opens the door to his room quietly and looks over at his desk where he suspects the cheese ball to be sleeping. His guess is faultless as his eyes note the orange ball climbing his computer screen, causing his little green feet to type random letters onto Sherlock’s word document. Sherlock quickly walks over and tentatively picks it up, then erases its paragraph of “6”s and “8”’s.
In front of him is another unearthly creature, roughly resembling a platypus. Bright orange colors most of its features. Its mouth and tail showing a dark brown. It’s lazily on its back, absorbing the sun and making a noise similar to loud snoring; its chest heaving up and down in a peaceful cycle. A tongue-like structure slips from the side of its mouth.
“I can’t believe him sometimes.” Sherlock pouts, remembering all the other times Mycroft wouldn’t leave him alone until he had gotten what he wanted. Frustrated, it takes awhile to continue his research. Looking down at the chubby creature, Sherlock finds similarities between it and another species on Earth, visible to everyone who isn’t completely blind. However, Sherlock doesn’t want to classify these monsters with animals from earth since they are obviously different, it might become confusing. However, this little thing seems different than the rest, definitely smarter in Sherlock’s opinion. Its small paws have a layering of intricate spikes that ride in a line up to its shoulders  and hide behind its quills. A perfect design that had Sherlock wanting to look at it for hours on end.
As John gets closer he can see what the man’s drawing. Or should he say painting. The man’s art tools come into view. Yet what catches John’s eye is not the many greens in the man’s painting, but the bright orange center.
“I’m rarely ever able to get close to these creatures. They always run away and I only ever see them outside my house. I thought they treated everyone like this since they never bothered the other people in the city. However, I see now that I was mistaken.” Sherlock pauses for a second looking back at Galax before continuing. “I’d like to hear about your other experiencing with these creatures.”
The creatures that would sometimes visit him in his room in his younger years never stayed. They always disappeared sooner or later, and John never let himself feel that sad about it, always reminding himself that they weren’t his. He learned to enjoy their random appearances rather than wish it lasted longer.
Sherlock looks away, back at the sleeping donut laying on his hand. “Mycroft, please go.” Sherlock murmurs, trying his best to make it sound confident, but Mycroft knew he didn’t mean it this time. Mycroft leaves the room, but he heads to the kitchen collecting dust, and begins to cook Sherlock a meal with whatever his men had placed in the fridge the week before.
John puts his phone back in his pocket and continues his venture to Michael’s, with Galax zipping through the shops and spinning around crazily. Apparently after that kitty nap, Galax was extremely excited. It bounced on the cars driving back and on the heads of the people walking on the streets. Galax suddenly zipped up and down John’s entire figure and tried nudging his hand towards something. John waved it away, but it only seemed to get more enthusiastic about bothering John’s right arm.
He looks in awe as the monster nudges its face against his nose before diving for his hands. Sherlock worriedly watches as the monster gets comfortable in his palm, hoping he wouldn’t cause another attack. Sherlock’s mind went into full reverse, it couldn’t be him… The little thing looked so calm, seemingly drifting back to sleep. Maybe these monsters were more intelligent than other animals on Earth. They could be just as advanced as humans, but have extremely different ways of life. So much was to be discovered and it makes sherlock’s heart race the more he looks at the one… creature that has cooperated with Sherlock.
Galax steps towards John carefully, feeling the sudden shift in his mood. It purrs gently and quickly before nudging its head into John’s chin. He feels foolish. It’s just a Cat. Well, a cat nobody but he could see. He sighs, getting off his now sore ass to check on his food. He notices Galax follow him this time around, strangely enthusiastic as it runs around and in between John’s ankles.
Don’t forget the extra supplies has been moved to room 303, John. Don’t want a repeat of last time, do you? LOL
Walking through the city proves to be quite difficult. People not moving fast enough, so many people not moving at all. Most of the people here are glued to their phone apparently since they never watch where the fuck they’re going.
I am deeply sorry for the 50 years it took me to write this chapter. Lots of stuff has been happening.
If John had known that following these creatures would lead him to another person able to see them, he’d have done it much sooner. Mr. Holmes, or Sherlock like he always insists (says ‘Mr. Holmes’ reminds him of his brother), was a rather strange man. However, with his strangeness excitement followed closely behind. The two had went out for tea that day, after John had dropped off his groceries of course. Sherlock’s snide remarks about his apartment based off what he could view from the entrance way weren’t subtle, but John’s glare at Sherlock caused him to shut his trap and walk out into the hallway as John was putting away the last item that needed to be refrigerated.
Sitting up slowly, eyes closed as he stretches, very suddenly feels a gentle weight pulling at his comforter. He peeks through his right eye, looking down just in time to witness his absolutely stunning visitor jump elegantly onto his shitty one-person bed.
“You’ve been trying to figure out why there are creatures roaming around our ‘plane of existence’ since you were ten.” John repeats dumbly. Sherlock nods his head, taking a sip of his tea. They’ve been here for nearly 20 minutes, time going by as they chat about numerous things. John ends up ordering something else in embarrassment because the waitresses kept giving the two men looks, waiting for one to get something other than two teas and a cinnamon bun.
John H. Watson wakes up to the smell of freshly cut grass and the obnoxious roar of Mrs. Hudson’s lawn mower across the street from his cramped flat. Popping an eye open, only to quickly shut it close once more with a wince. The sheer brightness of the sun shining straight into his eyes causes him to groan and turn over. Huffing in exhaustion as his face hits the pillow. He lazily opens his eye again, only to be greeted by a small cat.
I live and breathe for comments so if you have the time, I'd love to see what you have to say about my lil' AU!! I try to respond as fast as I can :)
John feels like this sudden rush of adrenaline was the only thing making him do this, but for once, he chased after one of these strange creatures. He quickly found Galax, but they run so fast it was extremely hard to keep up.
“Coming with me, yeah?” Galax rubs his cheek against John’s in response. He sighs. “Alright then. It’s not like anyone will be able to see you anyways.” He adds quietly, stepping out into the hallway.
“She brought most of it with her,” John half-defends and half-admits.  “What do I know about decorating a child’s room?”
He slips the paper through the slot, and it’s only because his phone rings, telling him that he got the position and when to report in, that he is standing there to hear the rustle of paper as the next note falls to the floor.
He feels a bit giddy, which is probably not the best way to approach this particular patient, who has absolutely no idea who he is. He takes a breath, tries to calm his heart. “Can I take a look?”
“That was worth the wait,” John jokes, later, watching Sherlock catch his breath. Sherlock grins up at the ceiling. “I expected this to be more awkward, though,” John muses.
Donovan immediately asks, cheekily, whether he’s getting laid. He says something snotty in response about her and Anderson. He barely registers the exchange as he strides to where Lestrade is standing near the body. He gives the scene a first glance and waits for Lestrade to explain why he asked him here so urgently, what the special circumstances are. Instead, Lestrade clears his throat a few times. Sherlock looks up at him sharply.
John writes. He steps inside and locks the door, and he pauses to admire the scarf long enough to receive a final message for the evening.
“I told you that you’re getting quite the reputation,” Lestrade tells him. “I’m going for coffee, and if you’re not here when I get back, I’ll have you arrested. I don’t imagine you’ll make it far without passing out anyway.” And with that, Lestrade is out the door, leaving John to face an angry man who just happens to be the younger self of the best friend he’s made in all his months in London.
“And a strong foundation for future scientific education,” Annabeth agrees, though some of the words are a bit mispronounced.
“Yes, it is.”  Sherlock is staring at John again, though mostly at his mouth.  “I would like to kiss you again now, if I may.”
The subtext, John thinks: You fail, but I like that you try. He imagines Sherlock sitting at the bottom of the stairs all evening, waiting. He probably brought a book.
and he stops short at that, silences the voice, because an evening on the front stoop isn’t the same as true company, and why had Donovan thought he was sleeping with anyone?
Sherlock scoffs aloud for the fourteenth time that morning since finding the scrap of paper on the careful pile of mail Mrs. Hudson left outside his door. “Really, John?” he says aloud, pushing away the still uneaten toast Mrs. Hudson had also left him, just this once. “Magic?”
She nods. “Okay. Then, is this. I mean, are men.” She smiles and sighs at the same time, and John wonders whether this is how he looks when he is reading a particularly difficult letter from Sherlock. “Is this why you haven’t been more serious about us?” she asks finally.
“Unless those questions are being asked for purely rhetorical purposes,” Harry adds, smiling at Sherlock, “to make sure everyone knows exactly how brilliant you are.”
Somehow, she turns the whole thing around on him and secures an invitation to 221B, where she carefully appraises Annabeth’s bedroom, the white desk and matching bookshelf already filled to bursting, the pink blankets and butterflies on the wall.
Or the life that he sort of just stumbled across, the day John walked into his lab.  Sherlock imagines that John would say that Sherlock hasn’t
“You were one once, too, John.  I have photographic evidence.”  She shakes her head.  “So, where does your flatmate sleep?  With you?”
“I’ll get used to him someday,” Harry says briskly, forcing a smile.  More quietly, to John, she adds, “No need to upset Annabeth right now.”
“I do think so,” John agrees.  He takes a breath.  “Not that this is important right now, but before he left, he kissed me.”
and tries to put the whole thing out of his head. Dr. John Watson, competent medical professional, embarking on his civilian life,
“We’re all very happy,” John mumbles into the pillow, “except that it’s six o’clock in the morning and I expect to be woken with breakfast or not at all.”
“You never use it,” John admits, and Sherlock nods seriously.  John is obviously crumbling, never having been entirely resolved to leave Baker Street in the first place.  “But Sherlock,” he starts.
John doesn’t answer, can’t answer.  All he can do is take his daughter in his arms, careful of her hurt wrist, and hold her close.  She’s so small, he thinks.  And Moriarty is dead, which makes John smile, makes him
“John.” It’s all Sherlock can think to say, and he’s pulling John to him in a crushing embrace, and he doesn’t know which of them is more surprised.
She takes his hand and holds on, though he tenses at the contact.  “He’ll do everything he can.  He loves her.”
John doesn’t know whether he’s projecting or whether, perhaps, Sherlock is as lonely and troubled as John sometimes reads between the lines of his letters.
John corrects. He feels ridiculous, ducking in and out of his door on a winter evening, irritating Mrs. Hudson, who told him last time he spent an evening this way that she would charge him a larger share of the heating costs if he did it again.
She smiles through the sadness. “I lost a dear friend on this night two years ago. The young man who lived in this apartment before you, actually.”
Sherlock takes a moment, considers John, and looks at Annabeth, who is also waiting for his answer.  He finally says, “Yes.  We’re all here.  I won.”
John writes, cutting to the chase. He doubts Sherlock would acknowledge or appreciate an apology even if John could bring himself to offer one.
“It says ‘Mycroft,’” Sherlock says.  He hesitates in the doorway when John’s eyes meet his.  “He would assume that a child could only appreciate simple flowers.  If you were a few years older, he would have sent lilies.”
Sherlock is smiling to himself when he gets out of the cab, adjusting his new scarf, pleased to think that somewhere, sometime, in another life, John has his old one.
“You know how very little self-restraint I usually exercise, John.  Count yourself lucky that I didn’t do so months ago when the urge first struck.”  And then Sherlock was gone.
“I don’t,” Sherlock says seriously. He tilts John’s chin up and kisses him, more skillfully this time. “I have other plans.”
All John can do is wait.  He’s under watch by Lestrade’s orders, and he has already failed twice to slip past the officers watching the door.  Another hour has gone by, the tea Lestrade brought him long since gone cold, when Harry is escorted in.
Sherlock plays the violin for two days and doesn’t eat, doesn’t open the door to Mrs. Hudson, is finally only roused from his misery by Lestrade. He pounds on the door and, once Sherlock mutely lets him inside, complains that Sherlock hasn’t answered a single text or voicemail. He explains a new case, a murder in a locked room, Illuminati symbols and false identification and something about a member of Parliament.
“So you’ll be staying,” Sherlock says briskly. “Don’t bother to answer, I already know that you’ve let your lease lapse. You have,” and here he pauses, looks John up and down, “four days to vacate your flat.”
And that is when he notices that Sherlock is brooding, his violin tucked under his chin, his jaw clenched.
John motions Sherlock into the chair nearer to the sink in the corner of the room -- he can’t keep his hands sterile if he needs to walk far enough to require the cane -- and prepares a suture kit. He finishes with the worst of it, and it is only when he is standing before a seated Sherlock, gently cleaning blood from Sherlock’s oddly beautiful face, that he finally speaks.
Annabeth Watson is a tiny little girl with serious brown eyes and the first hints of eventual freckles.  She is intelligent and quiet and polite, and she is threatening to undo the life that Sherlock has worked so hard to build.
But one evening he’s chatting on the phone with Harry, who sounds sober and hopeful, and she says that it’s hard to believe that it’s been two years since Clara left her, two years since John came home from Afghanistan. “A lot has happened, Johnny,” she says, and he thinks that she doesn’t even know everything there is to tell. And then he realizes, all in a rush: that he moved into 221B just after he returned, that Sherlock’s first letter was just after that. If he’s been back two years, then Sherlock should be at the flat by now. He could go to him, make him understand: John never meant to let him down.
“I’m here because I was pushed down a flight of stairs while performing Inspector Lestrade’s job in his stead,” Sherlock explains. “Whatever I may still have in my system has little bearing on the matter.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” John says quietly, calmly, into Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m not leaving, you can let go.”
No other letters arrive, though John checks every day until he leaves Baker Street. He writes to Harry instead, who seems endlessly grateful to have her brother back, though she questions his chosen mode of communication. He reminds her that she was the one to suggest letters in the first place.
Sherlock passes Mrs. Hudson when he comes home, one brisk winter afternoon. She looks sad, and Sherlock tries to remember: dates from her husband’s trial, her parents’ passings, some reason for her to look forlorn but not so distressed as to suggest a more recent cause. He calls it curiosity rather than sympathy that makes him stop, that moves him to ask.
indulging childish fantasies with a mystery correspondent who must be sneaking by his apartment when he’s not home. And somehow breaking inside to clear his own notes from the floor.
Sherlock hates himself -- suddenly, strongly. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Yes, John had been a bit heavier, a bit grayer-haired in the years between their meeting and the night Lestrade called Sherlock to the scene of John’s death, but the scarf, how many men wore a scarf like that with such worn trainers? Even after such an abrupt rejection, John was still wearing the damn scarf Sherlock gave him. There were motivations there that Sherlock didn’t quite understand, sentimentality and affection, but he had considered learning them once.
He kind of prefers the time travel idea over that possibility, actually. Logic and reason be damned.
That got the full and complete attention and seriousness of Sherlock, who turned around to look at him, forgetting the smuggling, forgetting everything. He had told Mike about his soul mate a few years ago, after he insisted too much about it. Somehow, he eventually asked him indirectly that if he saw a sand colored wolf in Buckingham or the surrounding areas, to let him know. If his soulmate was in the service of Jim Moriarty he preferred know, as bad as it was than to remain in ignorance.
John blinked in surprise. He could now understand why Jim wanted Holmes to be at his side. To be able to know everything about a person by just looking...
“I... I knew for a long time I had feelings for you.” The confession made something start to twist inside Sherlock’s body, but the soft music helped him remain calm. “I think I knew since the beginning. I did try to ask you on a date. But it wasn't until recently I admitted it to myself.”
“We’re both clean. I know you take monthly tests and I did one on myself after Mary. Do what you want but if you don’t fuck me right this instant...”
John kissed Sherlock’s knuckles before standing up and helping him do the same. By the time they were both on their feet, Mycroft crossed through the door with an excited Rosie in his arms. The child got rapidly excited when she saw John and Sherlock, almost throwing herself out of Mycroft’s safe embrace in an effort to reach them. John took her into his arms, burying his nose into her hair, breathing her in, so happy to see her alive and well. He registered the firm grip of Mycroft’s hand on his shoulder, squeezing once in a welcoming gesture. John bowed his head in acceptance, grinning like an idiot.
Since John and Rosie came back to Baker Street, they made an agreement to keep the risk factor as low as possible. They called it “The Rosie Agreement”. John was a father now. A single father, and Rosie was his priority. Sherlock understood this and even joined into the idea. He loved Rosie and accepted that a baby implied certain sacrifices. He would rather take a boring case or drop the criminal chasing at some point altogether, it to the Yard, in favour of remaining unharmed and safe to go back home again and put Rosie to sleep. Both John and Sherlock had the feeling their times of adrenalin highs and running around London were gone. At least, until she was a bit older. What were a few years compared with eternity, anyway? So, so little.
If John’s gasp of surprise didn’t alert the man of his presence, then Galax’s very loud meow certainly did.
Galax was still with them as they sipped from their cups, John taking a bite out of the cinnamon bun he ordered. Sherlock stares intensely at John, causing him to feel flustered, but John realizes that it is not he who Sherlock’s attention is on, but Galax. He chuckles at the thought which causes Sherlock’s assessing gaze to focus on him. John looks up from his cup and locks eyes with Sherlock, smirking. Galax lays down, curling around Johns neck, its vantablack eyes closing, leaving its galaxy themed fur to show in its place. Sherlock looks back down as it does this and then sharply back to John in a questioning manner. John smirk turns into a smile as he continues eating his cinnamon bun and silently sipping his tea.
“John”. Sherlock is still standing, his voice low and husky, his eyes piercing into John’s, begging him to understand, needing him to understand. His mind flashes back.
Ah. Mary. He was expecting that to be the topic on John’s mind, but he’s still not prepared for the knot that forms in his belly at the mention of her name. He had tried to be supportive, he really did, but honestly, the woman went off and left her own husband for months. She had lied to him from the moment she met him. Of course, Sherlock lacks experience in this, but even he is pretty sure that’s not how relationships are supposed to work.
Slowly, Sherlock approaches the bench and sinks himself down onto it, coat collar up to protect against the wind, hands shoved deep into his pockets. The warmth of his body radiates off of him despite the frigid temperatures, and he knows John can feel his presence, even if it goes unmentioned.
Which is how he knows that’s what John needs now. Friendship, warmth, caring. He doubts he’ll ever be able to save John the way John has saved him, but he knows he needs to try.
Another message, again from Mycroft. “This isn’t his first bottle. He’s already finished a half-empty one”.
The thought of Sherlock not wanting this after all the looks, the tension, the fantasizing over the past years is so ridiculous that in any other situation it would cause him to laugh. Now, however, he simply  grabs John’s arse and moves him slightly to the left. Sherlock’s semi-seated position on the table lowers him just enough so their cocks match up perfectly.
Now he knows for sure that that’s not true. He would give up anything to do this with John for the rest of eternity. For John to want this, for him to have permission to reciprocate. He wishes he could just forget this night, for it not to torture him every time he sees John, or even thinks about him, a reminder of what could have been. But as his mind palace is cataloging every detail, every touch, every noise, he knows that is impossible.
Sherlock continues to sit quietly, eventually reaching his thumb out to brush against John’s hand on the bench, then gets bolder and slowly moves his whole hand until it’s covering John’s. Human contact. And, as John makes no move to pull away he hopes desperately that by some miracle it will be enough. That it will make John realize everything will be ok. That he is not alone. That he is loved.
And just like that, he breaks out into a full-blown grin, the first one Sherlock has seen in years. It’s a simple action, but accumulated stress seems to physically fall off of him and he looks ten years younger. He bites his lip, an action that has been bloody antagonizing for years, and Sherlock brings his finger to his own lip in an unintentional response, to the same spot where John’s mouth was mere hours before.
“That’d be nice, thanks. Whatever you like is fine.” John shuffles to his chair as if he never left it, still in the jeans from last night, his shirt unbuttoned to expose a white undershirt below. If Sherlock focuses, he can make out his chest underneath it. If he lowers his eyes he can barely make out his nipples peeking through the thin fabric. Lower still and he can make out the bulge in John’s trousers, imagine stepping close enough to press his thigh to it. Feel John gasp underneath him for real. Do all the things he wasn’t able to last night.
“You”, he slurs, obviously taking great pains to try to control himself and talk coherently even as his body sways unsteadily on the bench. He pauses for a moment, his face scrunching together in concentration, making Sherlock want nothing more than to kiss the adorable little wrinkle that forms in the middle of his forehead. “It’s you. You make me happy. You…”
His head rests again Sherlock’s shoulder, and once again, Sherlock is startled by how natural it feels. Normally, he detests physical contact, but this is John. John. Who can incapacitate any adversary without batting an eye but who struggles to use a chip and pin machine. Who can beat up a criminal, leaving several bruised ribs and sprains, yet in the same hour with the same hand, gently bandage the most gruesome wound. Full of contradictions: the doctor and the soldier, arrogant and humble, brilliant and an idiot. The best thing to ever happen to Sherlock, and also the worst. John taught him what it meant to care about someone more than himself, to be human, to become the person John already thought he was. And then he left, making Sherlock wish he could go back to simply being a sociopath. But apparently there isn’t a switch for that sort of thing. Sherlock would know; he conducted extensive research on the subject.
Headache? Oh. Of course. He must have quite the hangover, and all the violin music can’t have helped. Sherlock snaps into action. God, he’s such an idiot. He quickly places his violin back in its case and rushes over to the kitchen table, rummaging among his latest experiment that’s strewn about. “I know I have phosphoric acid and acetic anhydride here somewhere, we can mix it with some water and ethanol and it might not be quite the same as an aspirin, but it should help that headache some. I wish I had salicylic acid, maybe in the drawer by the sink…?”
He’d had to hide it under his coat for ages while he dealt with the idiotic Scotland Yard. Worth it, though, as he presented it to John as a present in the cab on the way home, to hear John’s “you’re a bloody nutter, you know that” with an exasperated smile clearly laced with affection and warmth, yet still not quite reaching his eyes. It was ok though, it was better than nothing. Sherlock took what he could get these days.
“I love you” he whispers into the darkness. I have always loved you, since that first moment. I will always love you. He startles for a moment when he notices John’s eyes flicker open before closing again, a silent acknowledgment that he’s heard. Sherlock prays he won’t remember in the morning, yet finds he doesn’t mind as much as he should if he does.
John had called him insane, but had followed him in anyway. Just like Sherlock knew he would, just like he always did. Given the circumstances, the fights that followed were relatively amicable. There was one brief moment of being caught off guard when one of the men pinned him to a piano, but John had come to his rescue within seconds. The police were there within minutes.
After a few moments, he slowly regains the slightest bit of composure to find that his mouth has gone slack, clearly an unconscious effort on the part of his body to allow John better access. John takes this as consent and continues to press in with full force. Sherlock has never seen him so vulnerable and yet so determined. Other than the occasional bite of food after a full day without, John has never taken charge of anything related to Sherlock. The occasional eye roll of course, and “oh god” whenever a new body part appears in the fridge, but certainly never like this.
He knew John had been depressed, but he never imagined that it was this bad. Stupid, stupid. Is it possible that Mary had meant that much to him? It wouldn’t be the first time his inability to understand human emotion had interfered with his deduction abilities. But still, John had hated her at the end. Hadn’t he?
He pulls John into the seat next to him, hoping that he won’t be sick on the ride home, but he is mercifully asleep even before the door is closed.
But it got John out of the house, a rarity in the months since Mary had died. The only times Sherlock saw him at all anymore were in response to cryptically worded texts promising mystery and danger.
“God, Sherlock. You’ve put your life on hold for me and I’ve been nothing but an arse to you in return. I don’t deserve it, which makes you even more amazing. Why can’t you see that?”
He looks down at the floor and smiles, and when he looks back up, Sherlock almost shatters. He knows Sherlock, and is still here. Standing in the kitchen at 221B. Still in awe. Still open with his declarations of praise.
Now, he would give anything, would leave Mycroft to deal with Moriarty on his own, if it meant that John would stay.
Come back home. Sherlock thinks, his eyes roaming John’s face in an attempt to read him, but his gaze remains fixed on the carpet. Move back in, and I’ll play you whatever song you like, as often as you like. I’ll compose whole sonnets just for you. I’ll never stop playing. My fingers can fall off, and I’ll learn to play with my teeth.
He remembers that first day, meeting John, back when his biggest concerns had been finding cases exciting enough to keep him off drugs and placating Mrs. Hudson after he burned a hole through her kitchen counter. How he thought he had been able to convince himself he didn’t need anybody. How he was married to his work. How it was easier this way. Now, six years later, danger in itself isn’t enough. John, damn him, had taught him to feel. To be a better person. To enjoy talking to a living entity for once, instead of just a skull on a mantlepiece.
He takes a breath as he once again returns to his seat on the bench, John still searching his eyes for an answer. “John. You are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say that you are the only one with whom I would ever want to spend an extended period of time, much less with whom I could ever live. You’re a skilled marksman, a phenomenal doctor, and an even better friend. Far from making my life worse, you have made it infinitely better and I am forever indebted to you for saving my life again and again. Mary wasn't your fault, she was mine. I’m sorry I wasn't there when you needed me before, and I will do everything possible to rectify such an error. So I will be here as many times as you need me, for as long as you will let me. From now on. You are my…”. He pauses awkwardly. Why is this so hard to say? He’s a grown man for Christ’s sake. Surely it’s obvious by now anyway, but still somehow has never been uttered aloud. He takes a steadying breath and tries again. “You are my best friend.”
The thought sends an unexpected tingle up his spine. That such a small action can cause such an effect because he did it. His John. Always the soldier. Always in charge. Always composed. Now losing his ability to think clearly all because of him of all people.
Not to be outdone, Sherlock returns the favor and bites down on John’s bottom lip which earns him the reward of a half-moan. It’s not all that  loud, more of a gasp really, but it is the first time ever Sherlock has heard John be aroused because of him.
So she knew exactly what Sherlock was going through. And she had hoped, sincerely, that he would not have to go through it.

Then he turned to John, blue eyes locking on his. He saw the almost ginger beard twist with his lips to draw a bothered expression.
And he did. He walked with his feet intertwining from the pain and the lack of use. He continued until they walked into the wide room where the man with the back facing them continued talking with his phone.
Large windows in the living-room showed a vast field exterior  with not a single sign of other houses in the vicinity which actually made sense. If this was a place for retreat and protection, it was reasonable to assume they would have tried to avoid being surrounded by humans or other threats. Whether they had accomplished this out of sheer luck or by purchasing an obscene amount of parcels, he didn’t know. But John would’ve put all his money on Mycroft owning a big ass estate without blinking twice.
Irene had lost her soulmate seven years ago. She havent been able to find them in time, so she never knew how they were or what their name was. It was a butterfly, she knew that. Beyond that, she never knew any other information. And she was nearly glad of it. The loss was a well-known and quite painful process for the dystopic that was left alive. Once, she had met someone who had told her that their souls were connected by the thread of destiny, and when one side died, the thread wasn’t cut, but it extended to the afterlife. But the surviving half felt it broken, and the sensation was of being torn apart from the inside. Irene had felt it. She had woken up in the middle of the night with no air to breathe, and a few minutes later, she fainted. When she woke up, a while later, she felt alone. So terribly abandoned... And her lioness,
He was about to move, concerned, when at last John turned to look at him. His pupils were back to normal, his eyes relaxed and shining with a light that hadn’t been there before. There was a bit of blood trailing down the corners of his lips and across his chin, and dark splatters on the fabric of his sweater. John’s mouth was glossy, crimson coloured, and Sherlock couldn’t look away from how his tongue lapped at his lower lip in an attempt to clean the mess.
The voice over him sounded concerned. He was about to ignore the man in favour of getting up, when whoever pushed him away from the car rose and lent him a hand. Frowning, he took it and used it as a leverage to get himself up again. A spark like static crossed his whole arm, right from the spot in which their skins touched.
The corpse of the young man was found by Scotland Yard mere two hours after John made the call. The crime scene had been set, investigators made their inquiries, and left with the body after taking pictures. The area was still restricted, though, and he resolved not to cross the lines. Not that trespassing the crime scene would help  anyway. All he could have needed he had already taken.
The smell of wet ground and algae had gotten so intense, he couldn’t help wrinkling his nose. Were this the herbal soothers Mrs. Hudson was always talking about? He had always suspected it had been an euphemism for good old weed…
Sherlock trying to avoid any contact with him for twenty four hours at least, to avoid getting any of that smell on himself.
He growled, opening his eyes. He was sprawled on his throne, dark and cold in an effort to find a comfortable position. The creature was magnificent. His long legs were over the armrest, his dark wings spread hiding him from sight. From between his dark curls, two ram like horns rose above his head and curled back towards his thin jaw. The bone of the horns were pitch black, absorbing any light in the room and as thick as an arm. From between the horns rose a flame, burning as if fuelled by gasoline. It’s crackling blazes moved sinuously, sometimes caressing and engulfing the black horns that framed them.
Then John’s eyes dropped to his lips and before he knew it, his friend’s lips were pressed against his. They were as soft as he imagined them to be, tender and full. His eyelids slipped closed as John let out a soft moan and deepened the kiss, tenderly holding Sherlock’s face with his hand, caressing his cheek with his thumb. The tip of John’s tongue slid between Sherlock’s lips and he opened his mouth, allowing the intrusion, and grabbed John’s shirt with his hands, moving him closer.
He had seen drug addicts in the smoking rooms in the ‘Lion Den’. There were many, as well as brothels and other… recreational centers. In the end, it was a way to gain a little bit of extra  food and the basics for survival. John didn’t judge those who worked there, or those who, cornered by the hunger, would seek refuge in the drugs, which were almost given away. But he could not help think how someone who could not barely pay for a meal would precede the pleasure to something as basic as eating to maintaining alive.
was perched in an oak tree, away from him and of the Scotland Yard agents. Mycroft had asked if he could be allowed to stay with his brother because he suffered a variety of Asperger that was very strong, and needed constant care as days could pass without him speaking. The agents checked Sherlock and as they didn't find his animal spirit, they decided it was 'pure' and let him go. At that time, during the first year of the new regime, Mycroft was twenty-one years old. Sherlock was sixteen. They put the tracker on Mycroft's the ear. It was an ugly black button that had a flashing green light. They didn't put any tracker on Sherlock.
John tensed. He did not expect Jim to know his name. In fact, he wished that he hadn’t known. He noticed the Leader’s eyes go over his body up and down, and when he licked himself, he gagged, remembering for the first time since he was in the room that he was naked. He wondered, with some black humor, if he would get killed if he vomited over him, and what would his face look like. What he found most surprising was that he noticed that he wasn’t much older than him.
John’s hips bucked against his hand automatically, and he kept stimulating that spot inside him till John screamed, begging and muttering incomprehensible things. Sherlock was nearly purring with satisfaction. Not only was John a screamer, he was extremely sensitive.
When they were finally on their own, free to take a look at the menu, Sherlock felt John’s foot push softly against his own and he moved it carefully a bit upwards in answer, before lowering it and leaving it touching John’s.
Holmes fingers pressed some point in John’s shackles, which were electronic, introducing the opening key. With a click, the metallic plate that closed his hands fell to the ground, and John saw his opportunity.
“I’m not going to say what will happen to you because I’d be lying", said the man beside him without looking at him. John saw how his hand clung tightly to the handle of the umbrella again. Suddenly he cringed lightly, grimacing with undisguised pain and to lean on him in order to be able to stand. “But you will learn to control it… if you live long enough.”
Sherlock was gasping, his lungs oppressed. He couldn’t breathe. His eyes began to sting, and tears began to fall. He could feel as if he had a rope that died in him, in tension, the other end fixed somewhere else. The inexplicable sensation of being bound to something or someone with an overwhelming intensity that had always kept him sane and alive, it started to unravel until it was hardly a thin strand, without any kind of support. He wanted to fight so that the fragment inside of him did not break, he begged for it.
It was easy for Sherlock to turn himself toward a calmer, almost floating state of mind. Between the lure of the excellently played music and the smells and tastes surrounding him, he felt in near ecstasy. So few things had the capacity to shield a vampire from the grating everyday environment, and he was pleased this was one of them. Point for Mycroft.
“I know”, Sherlock growled. Blood started pooling, the ugly winter jumper already dark and damp, and his fangs were trying to come out from the sight and sweet smell.
Sherlock was lying boneless on the sofa, absolutely spent and satiated after the kitchen sex and the (reheated) breakfast. Still enjoying the thrill of another case closed, and not yet ready to start looking for another one. John had left a couple of minutes ago to get some groceries, and so Sherlock decided it was a good moment to call Mycroft.
It was John’s turn to laugh then, and he felt the dark, heavy atmosphere that had descended upon them slowly fade away.
“Perks of being immortal and good at predicting the economy,” he said, a smirk on his face. “Plus, I was terribly rich during my pirate days. Most of the gold was later invested in estates and properties around the world. I might not be as obsessed with money as my brother, but I’m no fool. I like nice things.”
John smile grew bigger and he started to unbutton his shirt. Apparently he was in such a hurry he couldn’t wait to be in the privacy of the bathroom. He had to go and do it right in front of Sherlock.
“Seb, I’ll need you to attend the barricade at Embankment station. In the Bakerloo and Northern line. And if it’s necessary, make them open a gap and make Thames fall on top of them. I don’t care. Go and fix it. Now!” The man screamed, and he swore that he had seen one of his veins in his temple throb. Moran hesitated. He couldn’t let go of the leash or he could let him go. “Ugh, for the love of God and the Blessed Virgin. Give Holmes the leash and go! NOW!”
“Well. I can’t believe it’s you, wolfie. You have been a very bad boy”, said Jim, with a nasty smile on his face. He approached him and stared. He felt bad about having to look up to center on his eyes on him, but he did it anyway, standing at attention. “You have been for a long time trying to escape from me, but now it’s over. Isn’t he naughty, don’t you think Holmes?”
The last thing he had eaten had been a piece of bread. He gave the rest of the bread and a piece of cheddar to an orphan boy living on the streets who was now under his responsibility. He was called Wiggins, Bill Wiggins. The child had a golden eagle as his animal spirit and said that he had dreamed with a salamander.
Morning Star was looking at the body with something like curiosity. As if he had never seen a dead body before. A pale hand rose over him, thin, long fingers caressing the lips of the boy before pulling back . Frowning, John turned to see  Morning Star sniffing his own fingertips, as if he was some kind of hound, and made a face of distaste.

“Could he? Have died then?” he asked, careful to sound less curious than he felt. It was Sherlock’s brother, after all.
Sherlock bought once the incense ‘Night Queen' when he was a little older in one of his trips to the clean area. When Mycroft came home late that night, the room smelled like his dragon did, and he could not help but strongly embrace Sherlock, with tears in his eyes.
's breast. He was called after one of Odin’s ravens, the Norse God. Sherlock had always liked the old myths. And the name had its own joke since it was the thoughts were the only thing capable of keeping Sherlock alive in recent times.
Even thinking he was inevitably going to die, he refused to do so without a fight. Always so stubborn. Feeling his chest tight, he swam faster, seeing a blurry point of light over him. Whatever it was, it was surely the surface. If he managed to reach something and pull himself up…
He heard John cursing above his head, and the sight was a glorious one. His mate was holding onto the headboard, knuckles white, and head down, chin pressed to his chest. His eyes were open and dark, pupils engulfing the iris. He was trembling with restraint, fighting not to move, the glorious muscles of his body tense. Sherlock pressed his hips against his mouth encouragingly, and with a relieved sigh, John moved them slowly toward Sherlock’s face, his cock fucking Sherlock’s mouth softly, in and out.
The nurse passed by without answering, and stood in front of the machines, reading his vital signs, writing down the results in a clipboard. He swore he saw copper hair tied up in high ponytail. He repeated the name, and felt the warmth of his wolf leave him when she approached him to change the IV drip.
“I was. I thought you were a good looking bloke, and you amazed me with your skills, so I decided to go bombs away and just try. But I was so conflicted that when you rejected me, I didn’t dare press the issue and so I retreated.”
Before John could complain, he was distracted by the shrieking sound of an old door opening. To John, it looked like a basement entrance.
He noticed the collar, of course he did. Someone with his powers of observation could not overlook such detail, and let alone after the gesture of the individual in question. He didn’t care about it. He knew what that meant, and he couldn’t care less. He was here. He was alive. They were together. They had found each other. Nothing else mattered.
As he poked the logs, he waited for a reply, but the only thing he heard was John’s breathing. It sounded hard, fast and short. His husband was unsettled, and doing his best to keep his breathing in control without suffocating. Had he been running?
The vents had become fireplaces, and the food that they received came to them periodically through anonymous donations. Some people even escaped far enough from the sight of the frontier and went hunting for a few months until they came back, with enough pieces to put them in salt and hold a couple more months. They were generally saved for the winter, when the food became scarce even in the ‘Lion’s Den’.
“I think it’s time I spent some time with my niece, don’t you?” Mycroft’s tone was polite and soft. He had already met Rosie, when John first moved back to Baker Street.
Sherlock found himself enjoying a more civilian lifestyle, one where he went to the park with Rosie to feed and chase the ducks or to find squirrels while John was working at the clinic. He would sit peacefully reading a book from the shelf while John played with Rosie building with her foam-made construction games and her stuffed animals. He was delighted every time he heard the sweet sound of the child’s giggles and learned how not to be terrified each time she decided to cry, especially at night.
Sherlock was panting, by the time the light died out and the warmth receded . John was blinking, as if confused, looking at him on the floor. Something flashed quickly across his eyes, cold and sad, and his hands were closed in tight fists at his sides.
There was a drain at the centre of the room, the cold concrete floor slightly uneven. John saw, under the fluorescent lights above, that the floor was also a bit shiny, almost plastic-like. Scratching at it confirmed it had been treated with some kind of plastic based transparent paint. He nodded, impressed. Mycroft had thought of everything including the possibility of… fluids being spilled inside and efficiently disposing of them in that case.
John touched his cut ear, where the locator chip had been. It had been wrapped up in gauze to prevent the bleeding and favour the disinfection of the wound and the scarring. He now understood the sedation and the pain in his shoulder.
He had already spent hours attending Lestrade’s psychological tests, when John was finally allowed to talk to him without having a doctor measuring his emotional answers based on his heart beat and his physical reactions to the question. He had to admit that he had become a very good liar after all those years he had served Jim. He had only lied twice when the questions became a bit too private. And they were not even lies, just ambiguous answers. There were things that people didn’t have to know.
John stood up, relaxing his shoulders. Embracing the memories that would cover him to human eyes, fitting into the skin of a new identity. The glamour covering his spiritual nature to human eyes began to form. Like a spider with his web, thread by thread the spell constructed how the world would perceive him. John Watson; doctor and soldier. Wounded in battle and honorably discharged.
Sherlock was about to ask if he’d done something wrong when the strong smell suddenly diminished, and he realised John had been about to come.
John is hungover and tired and sorry when he reads this. He’s also on forced paid leave for the next three days, while he “gets his head together.” Mrs. Hudson is away for the day to visit her sister, and he can spend as much of the day as he pleases sitting by the door, trying to make this right.
John is sitting in Lestrade’s office, head in his hands.  Not very much is penetrating the buzzing in his skull.  Even when he hears Donovan in the corridor tell Anderson, “What did he expect, shacking up with Holmes?” he barely registers it, just files it away as something to be offended about if he makes it out the other side of this.
Sherlock begins to play, a soft and slow song usually reserved for Annabeth.  “Donovan must feel vindicated.”
“Are you okay?” John asks, because Sherlock has presumably just faced off against his greatest enemy, and apart from a bruise on his cheek, he seems no worse for wear.
He is about to respond when the door opens and Donovan says, “Come on, then.  We’re going to meet the ambulance at the hospital.”
Since he was a boy, a voice in some part of Sherlock’s brain has narrated his life back to him, rephrasing his movements, adding adjectives and adverbs to his actions. More and more of late, that voice has spoken itself as letters composed to John.
Sherlock suppresses the panic threatening to rise in his throat and says, “You don’t have to leave.  She can live here.”
“Difficult patient here under police custody. I put them in an exam room. I asked the Detective Inspector to just take the man to the hospital, but he said it was all he could do to get him here.” At John’s raised eyebrow, she adds, “It’s a head laceration, probably just a few stitches, but he’s been fighting to leave since he got here.”
“John,” Sarah begins. She seems to stop, reconsider, try again. “You understand that in this office--”
“Yes.” The officer rolls his eyes. “That’s all it is, nothing at all about your well-being or potential. You have me all figured out, Sherlock.”
He presses his lips to Sherlock’s hair just in time for Lestrade to return with Sarah in tow. John cringes, because this is bad in so many regards. Lestrade pays cash for services rendered, and Sherlock looks a bit lost as he follows him out the door.
John is running late for work, and when he comes inside, stamping snow from his shoes as gingerly as he can to accommodate his bad leg, Sarah says, “Thank god you’re here.”
A little while later, Sherlock finishes his letter, feeling oddly pleased. He performs some unspeakable experiments -- unspeakable if only because no one else would understand if he tried to explain -- and ignores a few texts from Mycroft. It’s evening by the time he thinks to look downstairs for a letter, and the one he finds makes him frown at first.
“Yes.”  At this point, Sherlock would agree to almost anything.  He might even vaguely intend to follow through, though that will no doubt waver if John would just
John’s smile is grim but fond, a combination he would never have thought possible before Sherlock Holmes became a part of his life. He picks up a clean piece of gauze and cleans the last of the blood from Sherlock’s cheek. It is as much a caress as anything, and Sherlock meets his eyes sharply.
“Of course it’s justified,” Sherlock says to the air. It’s about time someone admits it, he thinks. And then he smiles.
“You’re being simple,” Sherlock says, but he doesn’t argue further.  The song changes to something a bit faster.  “Why did you say that we need to talk?”
He waits, feeling ridiculous -- Sherlock’s note could have been hours ago -- but sure enough, a near-immediate reply:
Sherlock feels nervous and delighted in spite of himself. To think that that had been John, his John, that day at the surgery, the man he’d tried to forget because he had sparked some feeling that Sherlock hadn’t known where to file. To think that he might have time, now, to touch those hands and incorporate this person, these possibilities into his life.
“She’s already so behind,” Sherlock frets occasionally, when she is asleep.  “I would never forgive myself if she turned out to be ordinary.”
On his way out the door to interview for a part-time position at a local surgery, another meeting where he has no intention of mentioning his most recent hobby, he drops a fairly sarcastic note
“Oh,” John says, and he is smiling and looks just a bit exasperated as he pulls Sherlock back down to the bed. “Of course.”
He reads the notes on the way to the crime scene, and he rereads them once he determines the order in which they were written.
Sherlock rips the nearest piece of paper he can find, Mrs. Hudson’s calendar, and folds it over, writes John’s name, marks it as an urgent message to be read as soon as possible. On the inside, he writes,
John has had his experience stitching up the belligerent wounded, so he takes a breath and pushes open the door to his office. A tall, thin man is sitting with gauze pressed to his head, glaring at the officer standing against the far wall. “You wouldn’t,” the man says, glaring, barely sparing a glance a John as he enters.
“Yes, you do,” Annabeth argues.  “Mrs. Hudson sits for me so you two can go on dates.  And have grown-up time.  I think that’s what she called it.”
Family is important for a child, John decides.  Or maybe he’s just being cowardly and planning ahead for the day when he’s going to want a woman to explain certain things to Annabeth.  Or maybe he has been reminded all over again that life can be too short.  Whatever the reason, John calls Harry to arrange a lunch date.
John knows by now that Sherlock himself barely sleeps -- and that night, John doesn’t sleep much either.
A waiter brings a candle to the table, distracting Sherlock from his careful watch out the window. He is a little resentful that he must be putting off these obvious signals, that everyone here tonight who knows him at all is waiting to see who could possibly have turned Sherlock sideways like this.
“Whyever not?” Sherlock asks, genuinely confused.  “Mrs. Hudson is more than capable of babysitting.”
“I believe so.  And I know for certain that I don’t want for you to have one with anyone who isn’t me.”
Ten o’clock two nights later, John has just read Annabeth to sleep and come back to the sitting room.  “We should talk,” he says.
“As would I,” John says, making sure to smile at each of his girls.  Families are always works in progress, he reminds himself.
Sherlock looks pained, but he balances the violin on the cushion between them and gestures to encompass their surroundings.  “I want more of this.  I want you and Annabeth and these too tight quarters.  I’d like to be permitted to touch and kiss you as the mood strikes, though I must admit that I do not yet know for certain which forms that touching may take.  It may be more or less than what would make you comfortable in a relationship.”
And Mrs. Hudson steps into the foyer, perfectly fine because John is gloriously, wondrously alive, and says, “John, back for a visit?” as if she doesn’t realize that John is there for Sherlock, to be his.
And he does.  John can tell, in moments, such as when he joins them for breakfast one morning to find Sherlock’s long fingers French braiding Annabeth’s hair while he instructs her, “The peach jam on your father’s toast.  The raspberry seeds hurt his teeth.”
-- and then the door opens, and with it, Sherlock’s eyes, and there is John with an almost embarrassed look on his face, an apology already on his lips for coming inside without knocking.
She actually looks apologetic.  “I don’t know the details.  They’re both alive.  The suspect isn’t.”
Sherlock scoffs and strides across the room to sprawl in the chair beside the bed.  He is watching John and Annabeth with an intensity in his gaze that makes John want to blush, crazily.  He remembers the kiss, though it feels like forever ago now.
He seems more confused by the affection itself than by the inappropriateness of the situation, which says a lot to John about this strange man, so alone.
The tension is high, and Annabeth glares at Sherlock right until the moment something clicks and she says, “Oh, of course.”  Sherlock waits, and she says, “Well, obviously two girls can date if two boys can, and you two go on dates all the time.”
John sits on the sofa beside Sherlock, and Sherlock watches him curiously over the violin.  “You’re not a sociopath,” John tells him, “or a psychopath or whatever else.”
John continues quietly, “Things won’t be the same.  I won’t be able to just drop everything and run off with you on a whim.”
“I did,” Sherlock agrees, “and you reacted even less favorably than I anticipated.  Out of respect, I haven’t repeated the action.”
Harry chuckles as they step into the kitchen, and Sherlock looks up.  “Harry,” he says.  “Three months without a drink
