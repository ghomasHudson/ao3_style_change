Tony just calls him now to hear his voice again and again. He squeezes his fingers in his eyes, trying to hold back the new crying fit. He would blame the lack of effectivity of his medication, but antidepressants only take you one part of the way. Tony knew from the beginning that he would still feel episodes like these, and that they would pass eventually.
And he’s hopeful. For ten minutes, he keeps his hopes up. But when, after that, Steve still doesn’t pick up, Tony figures the guy just doesn’t want to talk to him. And it hurts, a whole lot. No matter how often he tries, all he gets is voicemail. And not because Steve’s away; the guy actively declines the call, and eventually even turns off his phone.
want to get to know him. I want to know who he is before I come sending him an ‘it’s a boy!’ card, you see?” Peter answered. Yaël nodded, while she saw Wade walking up to the pond and started throwing crumbs to the ducks. As soon as the ducks noticed him, they swim up to him, happily quacking and diving for the bread. Wade just became the god of the duckies.
The moment the line goes over, Tony realizes that he can’t see Peter. He must have his camera turned off, then.
“We’re here to get you out. Can you still walk?” Peter asks her, kneeling down in front of her to look her over. The girl just nods as Peter puts a hand on her shoulder. She doesn’t speak anymore, instead coughing the moment she opens her mouth.
Of course, Peter can’t complain. Well, he does, of course, but the moment he’s standing next to Mr. Stark, whichever speech he’s prepared today quickly disappears as the words die in his mouth, and he’s finding himself once more holding a screwdriver in his hands while looking down on the next invention.
Yaël heard something to her right and saw… another man. Great. He looked like a professor that needed a big coffee. He had a stubble, like he hadn’t shaved in a few days. His brown eyes looked tired and his hair was turning grey.
“If she loves you, she’ll understand,” Steve assured him, unknowingly holding out his hand until it was resting on Tony’s lower arm. Then the two men looked at it, staring right where their skins were touching. It lasted for a few seconds before Steve realized what he was doing, and he pulled back. “Sorry, still a bit groggy,” he lied.
“And then you disappear, just like that! You don’t go to school, you’re not at your apartment… You’re just, gone! How could I even get my payback like that?”
“What the hell’s going on, Steve?” Natasha asks. All the Avengers are surrounding them, each one looking even angrier than the other.
“Planning on making it up to me after this?” he asks, letting his hand glide over Steve’s chest, smirking underneath the helmet. Steve clears his throat while starting up the bike.
Sometimes she felt her heart pound so fast and hard, she needed to sit down. Sometimes her sight started shaking and she had to wait a few second before it stopped. It was like her body was trying to tell her something, but Yaël didn’t seem worried as she never fainted or anything. Maybe she just had a lack of some kind of vitamin.
Now, running to avoid the same thing happening again, Peter can’t help but hate every action he’s made so far. He shouldn’t have done it, shouldn’t have gone through with this thing with MJ. Because the villain eventually
“Tony, we’re not even marri-“ Steve starks, clearly tired of arguing about it. He, too, comes to stand in the hallway, though he’s staying close to the door, his hand above his eye in exasperation and shaking his head.
She had to focus on her own creations’ fighting and her own moves, which was extremely hard in such a way it made her head hurt massively, like she had to split her personality. Luckily, Loki was quite concentrated and noticed immediately he had to steer her a little in their back-to-back attack position. At some point, he grabbed her under her arms from behind and made her tumble so she smoothly kicked down a few of the zombies as she landed. Without any hesitation, given the hectic situation that didn’t give her mind the opportunity to go even further in overdrive, Yaël followed Loki’s moves.
He points towards Johnny, and the other guy follows his finger, suddenly making an understanding sound.
So while Shuri starts up a conversation with Rhodey – something about his injury and helping him out – MJ leans towards Peter to give him a reassuring look. Peter smiles at her, taking her hand to squeeze her fingers shortly before letting go of her again.
“I’ll make a show out of it.” Tony returns. Patting Steve on the chest once more, he moves away from him and heads back to his seat. “Say, you think Nat would want to sing a song, too? I heard her sing one of her scary Russian lullabies once. She might put up a real good horror show there.”
Secondly, I'd like to thank each and every one of you, dear readers. Without you, I wouldn't have found the excitement of writing this story in such a quick speed. In comparison to my other stories, this one really just practically flew out of my fingers. Because you've been keeping on motivating me. Whether it was with kudo's, comments, bookmarks or subscriptions. I never for one moment felt like I was writing without anybody reading it, while I've been feeling like that with my other stories in the past. You've all been so participant, giving me ideas and unknowingly stimulating me to change some things, try out stuff. I know there have been some unanswered things in this story, which will be addressed in the timestamps OR in the possible sequel for which I've already made a banner (shame on me). There are ideas, and if it's going to happen it's going to be WAY shorter than this one, but it's a possibility that, after the exams, I might start typing up the story after all this!
He can just imagine Pepper storming back into his room, kicking him out of bed again because he just invented a talking toaster or something like that. No, thanks!
Peter nods, though only vaguely aware of it. It can’t be possible. There’s no way that Uncle Ben could have just told him off for something Peter has no idea of. Uncle Ben’s dead, has been for years. How is this possible?
“Okay wonder-trio, what’s with the staring at my junk?” Tony suddenly asks with no shame at all. Natasha doesn’t need to look up to know Steve’s face is already red. “I mean, I know I pack some good stuff in there but I thought you knew you won’t ever get it?”
“Where are you going, anyway?” Tony asks Peter after having noticed his bag hanging over his shoulder. Peter feels his cheeks redden, glad that neither Tony nor Steve are looking at him right now.
“No, I’m not starting a revolution,” Yaël smiled as she interrupted Korg’s story. He’d be able to tell all his plans to whoever, just by accident. But she liked Korg’s innocence. “I’m making a statue.”
“Uhm, because I’m not sure if I’m walking into a trap,” Peter mutters out. “Has my dad awakened yet?”
“What I want to ask of you is to take a good look at the gauntlet to figure out what exactly is wrong with it.”
“Well, not that this wasn’t fun, but I’m going to bed now,” he says. He punches Tony on the shoulder before turning to the others. “Good night!”
“I lost my comm-link,” Steve interrupts him, holding a hand to his ear. “I took it out after the fight was over. It must have fallen out of my hand.”
Yaël couldn’t shake the feeling that Nilla knew things she wouldn’t tell, like she knew more about the Queen’s plans or…well, there were certainly things she kept to herself and Yaël needed to figure out what it was. Even if she had to do it all by herself.
They must’ve something to do with why Fury doesn’t like her and why she is locked up in this ugly ass cage.
Like he suspected, it’s all about the Goblin’s attack. There’s some footage of him fighting with the other Avengers, and somebody even managed to get a good shot at Iron Man flying by. Out of all the Avengers, Tony Stark has always been the one that gave him the most chills whenever he talked to him. It’s probably out of a scientist-perspective, but the idea that somebody as smart as Mr. Stark would even strike a conversation with him… No, he still can’t quite fathom it.
“I know, because you’re a very polite person,” Tony counters sarcastically. With his back still pointed towards Steve, he has no idea what his reaction to that is.
“I, uh, I think so?” he mumbles out. Steve reaches out his hand towards Tony, clearly just as nervous as Tony feels. He knows how anxious Peter had been before they were taken on stage, and he wishes for the world that the Avengers wouldn’t have put him through this. But, he figures that if Peter
He knows, he doesn’t like the emptiness in there, but he’s been avoiding the place, and thus Vision, for such a long time now, and he’s already feeling like a crappy friend again. So after telling Happy to get him to the Compound first, Peter ends up finding himself in the place where all the Avengers used to live together.
“Bless you, Spider-Man,” she says. “Bless you.” She squeezes his fingers one more time before lowering her hands and throwing her arms once more around her kids. Toby suddenly pulls out of her hug and runs back towards Peter. Then, he suddenly points towards the toddler on the woman’s hip.
Gwen says with a grin. Peter laughs then as well, and then figures he’s right about that. With his eyes closed he imagines Gwen disappearing again, and after a few more seconds of just standing there in silence, he turns around again and heads back home to take a hot bath and warm up his body again.
“I think that reaction was mostly due to the name,” the blonde woman says, picking at her own glasses. She’s wearing blue ones, and her lips are bright red. Not the same red as Pepper or Aunty Peggy used to have, so obviously Tony hates the color.
There’s only silence in return. Peter waits for Karen to respond, but nothing happens. Not even a few messages come up on his visor. Peter scratches his head in confusion, pulling off the mask to quickly check if anything got messed up in the battle.
“Girl?” he calls out, still unknowing of the girl’s name. Is she even still here? Or did she trick him into getting in here?
The moment he bursts through the door, he shoots out a web to pull the gun out of the guy’s hands, only to realize a bit too late that, simultaneously, the four other goons point their own weapons at Peter out of reflex.
-side of life, while Stark Industries would offer possibilities in engineering.  “I’m hesitating still between electrical engineering and biochemistry,” Peter confirms Tony’s suspicions. So the boy
- Of course, FRIDAY doesn't want Peter to enter the room. She cares for him and doesn't want to see him hurt. Sadly, it's a small flaw in her programming that causes for her to be unable to ignore a direct command from any Stark. If Peter tells her to open the door, she might try reasoning but eventually has to open the door. Clearly, soon enough Tony will find a flaw in this way of thinking and he'll make the necessary adjustments.
Well, everyone except the scum and the outcast. They just got buried in random places. Yaël looked down when she heard the crackle of gravel under her feet. Without even noticing it, she had walked past the gates, into the graveyard.
“You can always try and take that tablet from Tony if you want to read up on it,” Steve offers. Peter ponders about that for a moment before shaking his head.
“He said he couldn’t tell us over the phone – can you believe Thor has a phone?” Steve doesn’t smile, though. His arms are crossed over his chest, his face serious. Then he gives Tony a pointed look. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
“Peter, you alright?” Tony asks. He can feel Steve shift a bit next to him. Peter just grunts, rubbing his eyes while sitting up.
“Uh, yeah that’s good,” he says. Hilde starts dragging Sam along before noticing Tony standing there.
Peter takes the glass case and opens it up, taking his reactor in his hands. It’s just as warm as the other one, just letting out a bright blue shine for nobody really.
Eventually, Happy stops the car in front of Peter’s house. Tony realizes then that he hasn’t spoken a single word about it at all. Even as he opens his mouth, he finds that he lacks the words to speak. He wants to tell Peter everything he knows, but there’s no good way the words form in his mouth.
Peter ignores them, walking past them as he gets to the passenger’s seat. Then the guy stops him by putting his hand on Peter’s chest.
Class goes slowly. The teacher goes over their last test, which according to her more than half the class failed on. Peter got a perfect score, of course, but that’s probably because he now has two super intelligent people living in the tower.
“Peter?!” What the hell was going on? Why was Parker lying next to her? When did she lay herself down? She turned to look back at Loki, but she only saw the wall of her bedroom. It started to kick in. She went to the party last night… and… she looked back at Peter. This couldn’t be happening right now. Yaël just found out she had been in some sort of relationship, or was she still in it? Were they still ‘together’ or something?
Great, he’d been drunk. He thought he wouldn’t be going that way again? He remembers all too well how it felt after that one time. Angry at himself, Peter gets on his feet, just wishing that this pounding in his head can just pass quickly.
He’s not sure if he’s screaming or not. He feels his throat, knows there’s some sort of sound coming out of his mouth, but it’s drowned under the sound of the machine Johnny brought from the lab. There’s nothing around them, nothing to distinguish the loud sound waves currently incapacitating Venom.
“Whoa, I’m sorry, Peter, I didn’t see you there,” Liz Toomes says. Peter takes a step back to look at the damage he’s caused her, happy to see that she isn’t injured from colliding with his hard head.
There’s a heavy silence. Tony watches the gears work inside Strange’s head as he tries to place May, but it’s clear that recognition is far away.
“Yeah, uh, the, uh… the voice let me in?” Ned asks, with eyes open wide, taking in Peter standing there with his suit still on.
If he’s going to, at least. After that fight, he wouldn’t put it past him to just decide and head to sleep himself.
Peter nods, though he doesn’t verbally respond. As the screens finally change from some other generic trailer or another random movie to an actual news report, Peter can see smoke and flames rising up in the air.
“Peter, I know this is kind of awkward, but… uh… it’s not really that unusual for us to, you know, have some fun, right?” Tony scratches his head, while Steve scratches his beard. The two make a lot of effort not to let their eyes meet Peter’s.
Stark’s mystery kid?” Felicia suddenly asks. Peter turns back to her with his mouth open. He had actually forgotten that the girl didn’t know about Peter’s heritage! He’s so used to hanging out with people who know about that detail in his life, he’s not even been trying to hide it away around them.
For a moment he wonders if the population of New York starts to realize that doing crime in here is a hopeless task given that it’s the home base of who knows how many superheroes? He
We know we messed a bit with canon here; we just didn't really like the idea of Clint abandoning his family to do some hero-work, but at the same time we really wanted him in the story more. We talked about it for a while, and agreed that, in here Clint never married Laura. Not that we dislike her character or their kids, but it just didn't feel right in the story.
“Most things are more fragile on Earth, we’re not as strong as you are,” Bruce clarifies. Brunnhilde just inspects the glass for a bit before Tony arrives with the cooled bottle. When he fills the glass, she smiles.
Tony puts a hand on Steve’s mouth to make him stop talking. When Steve has calmed down a bit, Tony slides that hand to Steve’s cheeks, taking his face into his hands.
“I don’t really have time to explain. Ask FRIDAY and she’ll tell you everything,” Tony shouts back. Peter sighs and shuts the TV down again just as they were to announce the possible killer. He doesn’t really want to know; it’s not his battle.
He gets dressed quickly, making sure his hair is not too much of a mess. Then, in a hurry, he gets out of the bathroom to grab a quick breakfast. He’s glad he packed his bags yesterday, so he doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.
I have this list of timestamps I need to make. I have made a title for each and every one of them in the document that holds the story. Yet, all that seems to come out are these random things that come up to me at the most randome times in my day.
But the Goblin doesn’t seem to just want to fly him somewhere. That much is clear when suddenly he’s grabbed by the throat and thrown against the wall. A sharp sting hits in his back, and the tears already starts welling up in his eyes. This hurts, damn it!
“I will withhold sex if you don’t delete that footage right now,” Steve warns him. Peter scrunches his face together, though Harry watches it happen in fascination.
Even when Flash is on his side, he still wants to be the best. Just to prove that, the guy went up and punched another guy a massive nosebleed when he was trying to get too frisky with Felicia. Sure, he got himself a warning from the school, but apparently his manhood has been rescued or whatever else is going on in Flash’ mind.
Yaël supposed that the Asgardians and the Sakaar- escapees would be searching for a new planet to live on. How or where, she wasn’t aware of. Somehow, Yaël would get back home, right? Maybe it would take a few years longer than she had expected when she travelled to Norway…
Mr. Stark laughs as he presses the button once more, though a little longer. This time, there’s a longer string of the web, and before it flies away Mr. Stark grabs a hold of it. The web is attached to the wall, so Mr. Stark gives it a good pull to check if it would break.
“Of course,” Yaël answered dryly, which made Steve raise his eyebrow, not knowing how to react to that.
“With Steve you mean Captain America, then?” the boy asks. Tony frowns, putting his hands in the pockets of his jacket while he shifts a bit uncomfortably.
“You’re lucky that I love you,” Steve says, coming to stand next to Tony to put a hand on his forehead. Tony pulls away, grabbing a hold of the glass and bringing it close to his lips. “Otherwise I would have kicked your ass.”
Aunt May is surprised when Peter gets home, since he’s earlier than usual. Peter doesn’t want to explain what happened, so he just keeps it with ‘Tony wasn’t feeling too well,’ and leaves it at that. Aunt May doesn’t ask any questions, luckily.
dad in the world, but he figures he would be alright. Maybe he should talk to Steve about this, figure out what his vision on it is.
He doesn’t speak, just holds out his hand towards Steve, who hesitantly takes it. Once their hands touch, Tony pulls him closer as if they’re dancing. With Steve’s side pressed tightly against Tony’s, the engineer comes off the ground.
There’s a hard lump in Tony’s throat. No word is going to escape through his mouth anymore. All he can manage is a quick nod before Mary starts cleaning up the place to make it look like nobody came there. She takes the vials of blood from Richard with her to dispose of them somewhere Richard won’t find them.
“You need to push it, then pull it down before pulling it up,” he explains. Hilde hums in understanding, and when she does it, Tony lets out another relieved breath as the suit opens up around him. The late-summer air hitting him at last, Tony rolls out of the suit despite how much it hurts his leg.
“He overdosed last Thursday…the same day you got, you know…stuck in your dream.” Holy shit, an overdose?! Of what? Yaël didn’t ask, it was none of her business. But she couldn’t help being curious, though.
“Class dismissed,” he says. All the kids get back up immediately after that, packing up their stuff. As if they want to get out of the room as quickly as they can. Tony rolls his eyes.
Peter takes the paper and skips towards the actual article, where there are more pictures shown that were taken. But when? Sure, Peter remembers coming across the Black Cat a few times more in the past few weeks (almost once every two days), but after the usual flirting from her side Peter always skips off to get back to his duties.
“Can I see the pictures?” Steve asks then. Tony nods, before leaning towards the dashboard and opening up the screen.
May returns after an hour, bringing a couple of guests inside the room as well. Tony doesn’t look up, but he can hear Natasha softly muttering something to Bucky, and he’s probably not mistaking when he catches a word from Carol as well.
“Because…” Peter mutters, sniffing his nose once. “Because I felt so much stronger, invincible. I was fast, agile, flexible. Even more than before so…”
“Well, they mostly needed us to hold back the people who turned psycho because of it while Loki searched for a way to fix it. I can’t believe it took as long as it did. Almost two weeks of non-stop fighting confused Asgardians gets old after a while.”
After that, X said goodbye to Wade and before rolling himself out of the door, he turned to Yaël with his typical sweet smile.
“I lo- I love-“ Tony can’t finish his sentence, as a loud gasp escapes his mouth instead. He’s reached his peak, that much Steve knows. Steve presses his nose against Tony’s neck and decides to just let go. After this they can sleep. Tony has been tired often, lately.
“No way!” Peter mutters out. Because that’s MJ, hanging high above between two towers with nothing to defend herself with. Freaking MJ?! Anger boils up inside of Peter, and he’s just about ready to punch somebody in the face.
Though Peter saw his face. At least, Tony thinks he did. But he can’t reach him. Tony sighs and puts the phone away.
“He knows. I know he knows. He doesn’t know that I know, though,” Tony explains casually. “That’s the problem, should I tell him I do?”
“I’ll, uh, open the door for her,” Peter starts. May hums in agreement. “Tell her she looks nice but not too much ‘cause that’s creepy.”
He’s still laughing ten minutes later, when the girl successfully dressed him in said shiny clothes, and even managed to put on some sort of make-up on him despite their permanent laughter. Peter has no idea what she’s doing, but he finds it hilarious on its own.
“Nothing too special, really,” Aaron returns. “Lots of sweaty people, too many of them. Didn’t get to see too much of the view, y’know?” He takes a sip from his beer while diverting his eyes towards the news. “That whacko out again?”
Now, it’s not even that late. The sun is probably still up, and they haven’t even had dinner yet, but it doesn’t seem to matter. Because Peter has his hands resting on his painful stomach, carefully avoiding his bruised ribs and not breathing too hard to keep the pain under control. He’s only just finished his call with MJ, affirming another date for tomorrow. Or, date… it’s a big word. They’re just going to serve food to the homeless again.
“Jeesh, the nerve of that guy,” Harry mutters out. Once he’s turned around to check after Peter, the boy is already running.
“A day, huh?” Mr. Stark watches how Peter puts the shooters back into his bag before leaning forward on his desk a bit. “Anything else you’ve created?”
“Oh, I wasn’t worried. I suppose you’ll find us at Avengers Tower,” Bruce says with a light smile, though it’s obvious he doesn’t really mean it.
“I haven’t gone through everything yet since Blonde Ambition times two over there keep on distracting me,” he mutters. Steve and Sharon roll their eyes again.
“Ah well, X and Fury told me not to watch the news,” mostly Fury, “fearing it might trouble my mind, or whatever their crappy excuse was to keep me out of the world…”
“Hi!” A sandy-blonde man in front of her interrupted her with a wide grin. Where the hell did he come from?!  The man brought his hand towards her and Yaël shook it. “As you might not remember me, my name’s Clint.” She nodded, of course he was Clint, who else would be shooting arrows at her.
For a few hours, the two work on it, discussing on their agreements with the changes, and adding the things they would change as well. There’s not much Tony can remark on it. The only things he mostly wants changed is the rules on minors, who shouldn’t be allowed to sign as long as they’re not considered adults.
“What do you want, Flash?” Peter asks, and the guy then lets go completely, the anger on his face suddenly gone.
What is Steve thinking right now? What is he even doing? It’s about six hours later all the way in New Asgard, so Steve’s probably… uh. Wait, what time is it even?
Suddenly, the two Avengers stop, pointing towards a room with a closed door. Peter doesn’t need them to tell him who’s inside. He nods, takes a deep breath, and opens up the door to walk in. All too aware of the heads turning his way, Peter is faced with all the other members of the Avengers staring at him. He feels small, like they’re all judging him. They did tell him to just go, to listen to Steve.
Dropping his phone on the counter, Peter limps back to the couch. Now, pulling a blanket over him, he falls asleep immediately.
“Okay, that’s enough,” he warns Ross, who nods at his colleague. He starts talking again, explaining how the government no longer wants them to operate just like that. When the other man hands him a thick book, Tony figures that must be what these supposed ‘accords’ are all about. Handing the book towards Wanda, Ross calls them the ‘Sokovia Accords’, which, Tony thinks, is probably the crappiest name they could have chosen, but he doesn’t mention it at all.
“FRI, can you let me in?” he asks. There’s no answer. The penthouse is dark, so Peter presses his face against the window and tries to focus a bit.
“You’re hurt?” he states, noticing the cuts he has on his face and arms. Peter looks at them as well, shrugging.
“Oh, eh, hi!” Peter calls out nervously. He hasn’t spoken to her since that one morning he refuses to think about. Not only is the idea of him sleeping with his friend unsettling, but also the thought that this girl is much older than him (she explained that, while she appears 23 years old, she’s actually over a hundred already).
“I wanted to help people, but I figured rather soon that this wasn’t the way I wanted to do it.” Once Tony’s removed the needle she grabs a tissue and presses it against the bleeding wound. Tony, meanwhile, goes to take a bandage to put on it.
So, he came to the party wearing his suit? He’s been hoping for a reason to get away, and some Spider-Man action is just about the right thing.
Their victory towards Thanos… that’s another question that has been kept unanswered. Because while Peter was sure the Avengers had never met the Guardians of the Galaxy, or that Thor had never known about Peter’s existence, it seemed like they were all too aware about each other. There hadn’t been any introductions, just cryptic talk that made it clear that they didn’t want Peter to know too much about it.
He doesn’t regret sleeping with Gwen. He’s glad he got to experience that with her, that he got to give her that bit of him. He loved her enough to do it. He loved her to a point where he would gladly do it again.
Tony frowns, looking back up towards Steve in confusion. Why does he sound so distant, as if he would rather just run away from here?
Tony shouts in return, sounding incredibly annoyed. Well, that’s pretty much how Peter is feeling right now. Then, somewhere in the background, he can hear Tony talk to somebody else. “
“All you do is make me feel exactly what you are, you make me sick!” You make me sick- Of Mice and Men
After the game of laser tag with Wanda, Peter and Vision (who, according to Yaël, had been cheating since he can walk through walls and so randomly appear to shoot at someone), they all went to the living room.
“I’m-“ he begins, but then he starts coughing, his sentence dying on his tongue. Steve quickly puts his hand behind Tony’s back and pushes him forward until he’s sitting up. Then he gently taps his back.
“Don’t tell me you don’t want my son to play?” he asks with a smirk. Clint and Sam both shut their mouths, while Scott just leans back in his chair and waves his hand.
, he reminds himself. He curses to himself, smashing the window shut behind him. After that, he rolls his eyes and lets out another sigh.
“Richard Parker isn’t Peter’s blood relative. So it wouldn’t have worked,” Steve deduces. Tony nods.
“Oh, I don’t know his names. I only got to meet his contacts. He’s much about keeping a low profile and all,” she explains. “But he’s Russian, that I can tell you.”
Yaël smirked. “Let’s move to another country.” Nilla looked a bit surprised, and then burst into laughter.
He passes Rhodey with a nod, gives Vision a high five – he’s been the lucky person to teach the Android how to do that – and receives an apple from Clint without asking for it. Enjoying the sweet, fruity snack, Peter knocks on the door of Dr. Cho’s office, and waits for her word to be taken inside.
“No! Go away!” she screamed hysterically. But his voice changed, it wasn’t Raido anymore who was yelling at her, yet Yaël didn’t dare to open her eyes. Someone picked her up and carried her somewhere. That’s when she grabbed all her strength to look up, which she could only do for a split-second. But that was enough to immediately recognize the jawline of the man who was carrying her.
That evening, once they’re finished, Peter finds himself at the place MJ texted him. And he finds her immediately, holding out a speech for her fellow protestors. And Peter takes his camera, and this time takes a shot from her. The picture doesn’t come out like it does with her camera, but he plans to hold on to it either way.
“Yeah, uh, just… stay away from the big guys now, huh? At least until we’ve tweaked the accords enough,” Tony warns him. Peter nods, not planning on going after the big cases for a while. He gives Tony another strong hug, and then pulls away with a smile.
He notices Harry – no, the Goblin – fishing out something out of his bag when he’s almost just behind the fighting figure of Black Widow. With a cold feeling and a shudder he senses the danger before it gets there, and so even before the Goblin can make his throw Peter throws his web to fish it out of his hand. The thing is already making beeping noises, so with the lack of another idea he throws it high up in the air. Next to him, Hawkeye seems to have noticed what he’s doing, and he sends an arrow straight after it, blowing up what ends up to be a bomb high above enough that nobody would get hurt.
“Can I-“ Steve stops, clearing his throat before looking back up. “Can I kiss you? Just this once? To know what it’s like?”
, the doors slide open and Peter is brought into the familiar hallway that leads to Mr. Stark’s office. This time, the assistant isn’t sitting at her desk in the front.
“I guess not,” Tony mutters. Then, with a loud sigh, he, too, looks Peter right in the eyes. That’s when Peter realizes how awful Tony must be feeling right now. He can read it in Tony’s gaze, seeing that wetness, the tears that are threatening to emerge. “I kicked Steve out.”
Cap is everywhere. He takes the most shifts, but also the longest ones. He stands next to Tony whenever he’s working on small things, ready to hand him whatever materials he needs next. When he can’t help, he sits down on the couch and starts drawing stuff – stuff he never lets Tony see, which makes the inventor even more curious.
” Yikes! Yaël surely hoped that that was pure drunken blabbering and not real feelings coming out of a deep drawer in Peter’s heart.
There’s a slight relief when they walk on a pathway underneath trees. The sun is cut off from their skin, and the smell of the plants go straight into Tony’s nose. He smells something fruity, and his mouth waters immediately. T’Challa chuckles, plucks something out of a tree above him, and then throws it at Tony, who catches it only barely.
“You’ve never been one to stay quiet, have you?” Steve asks jokingly. Tony sighs, nodding in agreement.
Everyone stood when Luna walked out with Steve on her right arm and the hologram of Tony on her right. When she reached Bucky the hologram of Tony disappeared as they walked forward to Bruce. Bucky kissed her head and smiled taking his seat. Bruce walked her to Happy and hugged her close whispering in her ear. When Happy stopped with only the stairs left to the altar he kissed her forehead.
“I don’t care what people say. We don’t have to be ordinary… make your best mistakes. Even if it includes marrying me at eighteen. Luna Pandora-Elizabeth-Sara Stark-Rogers, will you do me the honors of being Ms. Stark-Rogers-Parker?”
Tony held his hand back and stood to look up at the man. “Isn’t it funny were talking about kids and we’ve never had sex before.”
Tony looked down at his phone and looked at the text message. [This is a reminder that you have your first chemotherapy appointment tomorrow at eight in the morning. Please be there ten minutes before your appointment.]
Luna’s knees gave out as she kneeled putting her head on his chest crying. “HIja’ bangwI’ SoH. Yes, you're the love of my life.”
“Kids. We will figure this out so fast we promise,” Tony told them and hugged them close. “I have you. I love you both.”
“Send him in,” Tony told him and sat up slowly. I sat up looking at Tony keeping my head on shoulder. Slowly he put my glasses on my face while kissing my head.
“Stop! Just stop!” He screamed at her and the girl flinched. “It’s over. I got you back to your family. I know you don’t understand. And I am so sorry, Violet.” Gilbert was starting to go pale from bleeding out. “N-never wanted you involved… you have to l-live free. And live with your family.”
“You're damn right it could have been worse,” Steve told her and walked over. “You could have died!”
“Remember this isn’t you, Vi. It’s Miss Imagine. Colorful and fun. Annnnd my sidekick. I can’t do this without you,” Peter told her from the other side of her bedroom door.
As soon as the cars were out of sight Tony turned and punched Steve across the face. “Why?! Why did you bring up the twins?!”
“Oh, baby girl. We’re right here.” Tony whispered and sat on the left side of the bed while Steve took the right. “We have you. You're safe. It’s okay.”
“T-that’s not short…” Peter stated and rubbed his face pushing his hair back. “I would have never known you were a guy until you said something.”
“Please leave us alone,” Tony asked as nice as he could. “Our daughter is hurt and we need to attend to her wounds. We promise we will answer all your questions at a later date. I have your number and we will call you. And if you get all the reporters away I will make sure you are the only one we talk to this month.”
Tony kneeled and smiled rubbing Peter’s cheek. “I know, buddy. If you want to see Santa you have to wait your turn and wait like everyone else to board the train. Okay?”
“I’m really, really happy right now. Decides that I’ve been alive and that’s about it,” Tony told Sam and went into his arms hugging him.
“I understand.” Luna looked down at the sand and cried. “I’m sorry. I don’t even know how I got involved. I’m so sorry.”
“N-no I need to see them first. I need to make sure they're okay. I can’t dream about what I’m thinking. Please don’t make me sleep, Aunt Nat.” I begged while yawning.
“I won’t break his heart he only has one of them. I'll break his bones he's got 206 of them. I really need to study, Daddy.” Luna got up and kissed his head. “I won’t wake you up in the morning when I leave.”
“How can I tell what cute is?” Luna asked him and cocked her head to one side. “Now if you can excuse us. The ones with more brain and eyes are trying to leave here. In case you didn’t notice, that’s us and not you.”
“Fine.” Tony kissed his husbands head and left the room sitting on the couch. Tony couldn’t help but think of the worst. The number one being that maybe Steve’s body was finally giving out on him since he is 130 years old.
She nodded and gripped her cane close to her chest. Pulling her knees close to her chest she began to tremble. The pain of the world falling down around her made her start to panic. Luna started breathing heavy. A panic attack taking control.
“Tony. I wanted to tell you, but you brought up the baby. And I want a baby with you. I thought maybe I could take family time and go later.” Steve confessed.
“I didn’t mean for them too,” Dad told me and kissed my head. “Well by now you know we are moving. We are going up to New York to live with everyone. It’ll be safer for everyone in our family. It’s safer for you. Especially after the battle in Sokovia. How’s school?”
Steve walked over and tapped her shoulder. “Vi, you need to wake up. You are safe and loved. Come on.”
Steve looked over at Clint with a glare. “Really, Tony?! He knows?” Clearly jealous of the man sitting across from them.
“That was before we were even dating and had twins. We need to step up to the plate, Tony. One of us does. It doesn’t matter who as long as it is one of us. We could even swap out every once and awhile.” Steve suggested and kissed Tony’s hand. “Please, talk to me.”
Jarvis heard the conversation and started heading to the nearest grocery store not wanting to sit in the parking spot anymore.
The hour drive to HQ was quiet decides when the radio played a song that all of them knew. Then they would turn it up and yell the song out. Their favorite song to do that to is Don’t Stop Believing by Journey.
“They are doing things legally. Which is stupid. This shouldn’t ever happen. I’m sorry.” Tony told him and patted his arms sighing.
Steve cleared his throat and looked at him, “No. Not again, Tony. We really need to talk. Fury wants an answer by tomorrow. And sadly we need to decide which one of us is going.”
The two of them were unpacking the kitchen dishes handing them to Steve if they were glass, plastic to Tony. Everything was coming together. Only a hundred more boxes of everybody's junk was left to unpack in the common room.
“They were until you fucked Barnes! You hurt me. No, you hurt all of us. You hurt all three of us. You choose me. You have no right to do anything!” Tony started to cry. “And now you're staying here! In my house!”
Peter climbed on the bed and smiled laying next to his daddy and having his papa on the other side of him. He felt love and strength laying between them. “Maybe Santa wanted this to happen. Us all be happy together.” Looking at the door Peter saw Bucky dressed as Santa. “Bucky! You can’t be the Winter Soldier and Santa. That’s not fair!” He giggled.
“I’ll have to ask May…” Peter told her. “Don’t change yourself just because you inconvenience someone. You always said you liked being blind. It’s a part of you.”
“They are in the living room,” Steve told him and helped him stand on his two feet. “I’ve got you. Let’s sit you on the couch.”
“They're my children too!” Steve yelled back and slammed his fist on the table. “They don’t even know about the separation!”
Happy drove them home to the empty tower. Violet was the only one at the tower. She sat in the main room in the dark trying not to make a sound knowing as soon as her fathers came home she was in the worst trouble of her life. She watched the TV flash with the word freak under the picture of her and Peter.
“He will be glad to hear that. Don’t tell him I said this, but he really enjoys giving the younger generations the chance of learning. Though there’s a chance you won’t really see much of him, I’m afraid.”
It had been almost six months since they had met their father and husband (Tony's) and all that was getting so hellishly complicated, they had never been more than two or three months apart although in those months Rogers traveled sporadically to visit them. But since Hydra had taken power in one part of the world, the captain went back into action and much more overworked as he was the commander of the army. But the one who suffered most of them all, was Tony although he did not notice, he must be strong for his children.
-Aaagh, the bad thing about pops coming back is that we will have to see them so sticky -Harley said while sitting at the end of that table with Peter and Maria watching as Tony had Johnny in his arms and Steve was beside him hugging him by his waist While listening to Tony's plan for that mission, his uncles looked at the scene with amusement and tenderness since occasionally Tony steals kisses from Steve and he blushes or just laughs. Nat was amused to see Sharon's face of boredom and grief at seeing that.
They shouted the two chestnut trees making the room explode in funny laughter and Tony smiled with determination
-I have to go, we'll talk tomorrow. Yes? -Said Steve Rogers better known as Captain America, leader of the avengers and army commander, as well as being the right hand of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Anthony Stark.-
-As my husband knows, Steve has not been able to go these last missions to be busy with the army. There is a mission that is a bit complicated, so that's why I quoted everyone here. I apologize for not being able to call them at the base, but I have to take care of four Stark-Rogers chitauris and take care of the company so I have been with meetings all day ...
Peter sat on the bench looking at the piano. He pressed one of the keys and let his tear go down his face escaping his eye. “Your eight today. Did you know that? Are you celebrating with anyone? Playing music? Maybe even dancing? How did you expect me to go on without you? I had to make a new best friend. Your my sister and I love you. That’s the truth. Why did you leave me? I hate you for leaving.”
They didn’t even get to the door when Doctor Cho called them to come back. The husbands sat in the office looking at Doctor Cho who looked nervous.
The moment of truth came when she walked out on the stage looking at the piano. The hands were clumsy, but she figured playing was her utmost priority. Violet walked to the microphone. “Violet M. Rogers-Stark number 620. Playing the piano instead of the violin because of injuries. I will be playing the same song.”
“Everyone this is Loo- Luna Stark-Rogers. This is Harry, Ron, Neville and I’m Hermione,” Hermione told them.
Tony ripped his shirt off and wrapped it above the shots to keep the blood from spilling out of him. He reached into his pocket and called 9-1-1, but got shot in the back. “Bucky listen we will be fine.” Tony slipped the phone into his pocket and fell on top of him blacking out.
“I want your permission to marry Luna. I wish I could ask Tony and Steve, but they're not here. You guys have been raising her since then as a team. I need you to tell me yes or no.”  Peter looked up at the group paralyzed while waiting for there respond.
“No, you don’t!” Tony sniffled and gripped the collar of his shirt. “You don’t love me. You left me. After you said forever and always. I hate that I thought you were mine; always and forever. I can’t move on. Our children need familiar faces. Not the ones I bring home after finding them. I haven’t had sex since you found Bucky and you left me. I should have known when you started not sleeping in our room. Or being home longer than four hours.”
The ride home was miserable for Steve. All he could think of was somehow that being their daughter. Though he hoped she wasn't. After they found out that Helen Cho never sent out an assistant they looked through the footage. She was there one day and the next she was gone. Like she never existed, but Steve drew a picture of the girl knowing if he ever saw that face again that he would kill her or at least break a bone.
I will run a few tests, but I need you to leave the room for the machines so then your heart doesn’t screw with the results.
Wanda walked the bag over and looked at him. “How about I clean that up? You should be down there with your children.”
Violet looked over at him trying her best not to cry in front of him. “I’m sorry. Don’t hate me. Please…”
“I can’t trust you. I just met you and don’t know if I can trust you.” Peter told him and bit his lip. “D- Cap what do you think?”
“I swear baby girl,” Steve kissed the top of her head again and smiled. “I have to go now. I wanted to make sure you were getting home safely. I’ll be back in a week hopefully. If something happens you know where everything is. Happy and Pepper will be here in the morning to watch you. Bruce is gonna make sure your fed tonight though.”
Pepper sat on the floor next to the girl and held her close into her side. “It’s Aunt Pepper. Yout dads have everything taken care of. They are just having people come in to make sure everyone goes to jail and medical attention if hurt.”
Once everyone was inside they followed Professor McGonagall inside the great hall. Everyone was in robes except for Luna who was in a purple t-shirt with flowers and jeans. She had no shoes on since Draco took her trunk from the loading dock. All of the old students were looking at the newcomers. Luna kept her head held high and smiled behind the rest of the group.
“Begin telling your tale. I have that chair to turn red when you lie.” Dr. Strange told her with a grin. This was his favorite ancient article that he is allowed to ‘play’ with.
“We did a bunch of tests and she isn’t dangerous. She has powers, but she can control them. The letter from the mother said that she needed to grow up with people like her.” Nick slid the paper over to the husbands.
It was seven years later when Stark-Rogers Industries building was finished. Each member of the team lived on a floor with their families. Life was enjoyable. They were all getting ready for the twelfth birthday of the youngest family member. Luna is full of life and enjoys having fun with everyone in the tower.
“She was found sitting in front of my office last week. She isn’t harmful and she is quiet. Attached to her was a letter from a parent we don’t even know how got in here.” Nick told them and pointed to the chairs. “Sit with me. Peter can play with her though she may not even move from the seat. Unless she has to use the bathroom.”
“I can stable him I just need us to be in the lab.” Bruce got Tony on the stretcher and moved them out of the train.
Over ten million people came to Tony’s funeral. Filled over fifty guest books. Everything was red and yellow. All of his suits were on a lock-in-key display. White flowers were all around the building just like he had them at his wedding reception four years ago when they got remarried for the public. Uncle Stan Lee was there in his wheelchair was the highlight of the party since he was making the comics of his nephew's friends adventures.
“What do you like doing, Violet?” Steve asked and ate a cookie himself while looking at her then back to Peter.
“I know… I’ve got homework. I can’t skip grades and slack off. I need to be smart like dad. Thank you, everyone.” Peter smiled and walked to the elevator and got on being taken up to the ‘learning floor’.
“Who wants to watch a movie?” Tony asked and turned on Cinderella setting Peter in front of the TV. “Watch this why I go change.”
Tony came out with his Iron Man suit on. His armor was exactly printed on the suit. “How do I look? Stunning?”
Steve walked over and placed a hand on his cheek. “Yes, my love. It’s me. Calm down… it’s okay I promise.”
Thor walked behind Violet letting her lean on him. He tried carrying her but she had a hissy fit. Once they reached the locker rooms Thor stopped. “I can not go into the women’s room.”
“You requested this song. You're too cute…” She whispered into his nape. “I love you, Peter Parker.”
“Of course. Stay safe.” He leaned over and kissed my head. I pulled him down into a kiss knowing this would be the last one in this timeline or at all.
“I’ve got you and won’t let go,” Steve mumbled into his neck and kissed his cheek. “I’m so sorry about everything.”
Peter looked at them like his whole world was crashing down. “You can’t do this to us! What happened to family first?! The family is the only thing we have in the whole world to trust! You told us that Aunt Nat! Family! They work everything out always for one another! I hate you, Papa! I hate you both!”
When the song died down Luna put the ice cream away and sighed sitting on the floor. She leaned over and began to cry while Skinny Love began playing on the speakers. I didn’t want you to leave to make me smile. “Dad!” she screamed hitting the fridge while sinking down on to the floor crying into her hands.
“I’m not going anywhere. We’ve been able to live at home for two years now.” Peter whispered to her.
“Lately I’ve been thinking! I want you to be happier! I want you to be happier!” She sang along like no one else was in the room dancing around with the ice cream in her hand.
“Sure, but he has to behave himself,” Tony told him. “I don’t want anyone taking my underwear again.”
“I got pregnant after eight years of dating and had my daughter. Something I never wanted to do was leave her and my husband behind so I never got married knowing that I would hurt him when I left for the three years. During the three years I was here I kept her safe from everything. She learned to fight from a master in China. I told her it was the red room. She is quiet and scared of everything. She couldn’t master her powers though. Her’s are different from my powers.
Going in the elevator I paced the little box whimpering. He could be dead. He could be hurt. He could be in a coma. They could be giving me back. They could return me.
With everyone working together they were able to stop the city from flying away and killing millions. The couple was happy that they got to save those in trouble for there honeymoon. But, just like everyone else they wanted to go away and cherish their love together.
Violet sat in the middle of the bathtub staring at her feet. The water was only up to her ankles. “Dad, Papa. Glad you're okay. Come sit with us. We’re having a tea party.” She held the little plastic cup full of apple juice. “Uncle Bruce said I could have the juice is that okay?”
Luna looked up at him with her grey eyes launching herself up into his arms sobbing her heart out on to his shirt. “D-daddy!”
“Hey, Peter come on please,” Tony begged and bounced the toddler in his arms slowly. “You know you can’t shoot spiderwebs in Papa’s nose. It’s mean.”
“Well. This was great turn out, but I’m gonna go. I’ve already seen all the projects and you already promised money.” Violet told them and kissed her father’s cheeks. “I guess I’ll see you the next time a business meeting comes around Peter. MJ take you for coming as well. I’ll see you all for Christmas?”
After our fathers got shot we stayed at the house. Bruce and Nat slowly moved into the house to take care of us. We were upset when they took over there bedroom, but it had to come eventually. I left the school of arts to go to Middletown with Peter. Peter graduated two years early and went to MIT just like our dad did.
Violet sat there and watched leaning on the soft pillow trying to stand up. Whimpering when she fell onto her face not being able to get up. “Po….”
I stood up. “It’s too late, Peter. It’s going to send me back in an hour, Peter. I was here to see if you wanted to go with me. Guess not.” I held a letter out to him. “Give this to Gilbert for me, please.”
Luna looked towards the reporter smiling. “I enjoy feeling safe and it’s nice to have a secret identity. And know that everyone near me is able to keep me safe. I love all my aunts and uncles with my heart, but my parents with every breath that I take.”
Steve hugged his son tightly and smiled. “Peter, you get taller every time I leave and come back I swear it.” The last time he saw Peter he was only up to his shoulders, but now he was almost up to his chin. “It’s only been two months this time too.”
She started wheezing. Fully going into panic mode. Feeling that all of life itself was starting to drain out of her mind. Physically she began to pale and sink to the floor on her knees.
He put on the cleanest suit he had and got dressed. When he put the jacket on he could hear a paper crinkling. When he went in his pocket to find out what it was Tony saw the note on a pink sticky note: Have a good day with meetings daddy. Love the unstoppable twins. Tony could remember when the twins came in his walk-in closet and put these notes in all of his suit jacket pockets. He thought he had them all but was glad he had this one.
“Daddy look they are letting people on!” Peter squealed and grabbed his pant leg. “We gonna go see Santa?!” Peter was the most excited out of all of them since the boys at school told him that there was no such thing as Santa, but was ready to prove them all wrong.
“With a little training, it can be yours. If you want to join the Avengers someday.” Tony grinned and pat his head.
“Really, why did you need to say that out loud?” Steve rolled his eyes and laid his hand on Tony’s knee cap. “We leave tomorrow morning to whatever place you planned on taking us...”
“Leave her alone,” Bucky hissed at Lois and pulled Luna into his embrace with his metal arm. “She doesn’t need this today. As one of her legal guardians, I say bug off.”
“Hubby… come here and show me what Iron Man is truly made of.” Steve teased and ran into his bedroom belly flopping onto the bed. Steve waited ready for Tony to come to join him in the bed he grew up in.
All Tony could do was watch him cry. He didn’t know what to think or expect. His children were harmed. “Hey… it’ll be okay. I promise.”
“That is fine,” the judge got up. “Six o’clock sharp Mr. Bougainvillea. Not a minute later. I do not want to stay here all night,”
Steve walked into the room looking at Tony and sighed knowing he needed to be with him. “H-hey… how is she?”
“Well, since we will not be able to have you both look like yourselves I figured we could go out as Fairy Tail Natsu, Gajeel, and I be Wendy the first day. The second day I thought I could go as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles… we could get Bucky and Rhodey dress up as turtles too and I can go as, April.”
Luna gladly followed her keeping Newt close to her. They walked until the lady knocked on the door. When Luna walked in it smelled like musk to her like it was hiding a smoke smell. “Nick Fury. Where is the fucking hell is my Pops?”
Tony leaned over and kissed Peter’s head. “Christmas kisses for my whole family. I’m glad your doing better, Steve. You scared us and a shit ton of pidgins a scare.”
Breaking the mask off he saw his little girl laying there with her eyes clenched shut. “Violet, can you hear me?”
Pushing her hair back she looked up at Fury. “I-I just pictured a bomb. Pops has one in the attic that he pulls out when it’s The Fourth of July. It was just the first thing I thought up of.”
Tony took the wand from the man and put it into her hand. ‘She’s blind,’ Tony mouthed to the man and patted her head.
Luna put her finger on her lip thinking. “Hmmm… what about… Star Wars? Luke, Han Solo and I can be Leia?”
“Where is she?” Sam asked wanting to hold her first. “I’m gonna be the fun uncle. Rhodey is gonna be the candy uncle and Bucky is gonna be the badass fuck the rules uncle.”
Uncle Bucky was her best bet since he listened to orders like he was told and he is still feeling guilty for almost killing Steve four months ago. Thor might be an even better choice since he never cares about rules. She just needed her father to leave the room.
“Yes, sir. It was the suit that got destroyed not me. Though you know that.” Jarvis told him. Steve swore if Jarvis could laugh he would. “Bruce Banner would like to see you in Mistress’s room when you are available.”
“Mr. Lovegood is standing right there with the dog. I came here to hand deliver your Hogwarts letter and discuss everything.” Dumbledore told them and sat his wand down on the table putting his hands up. “Mr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers I truly need you to listen. Luca Lovegood’s parents didn’t go to jail for what they did. They went in for killing a great wizard. They knew their son was a prodigy and wanted them to go to the finest wizarding school. Changing him was to protect him.”
“Luna how old are you?! Do you enjoy having fags as your parents?! They teaching you how to fuck right?!”
“Isn’t that the truth. Where is the rest of our family?” Steve asked and set his coat on the rack next to the door.
“Just paperwork and two doctor visits before you leave the country. If you come with me we can get them arranged for you,” Gale told them and walked with Tony up to the front room. “Is there a reason you're going so fast, Mr. Stark?”
Luna sighed and sat on the couch. Newt jumped up and sat next to her. “Jarvis, play the recording of Dads first fight in front of the Avengers.”
“I’m honored you thought of us man. We will take care of the little Stark-Rogers. We have so many stories to tell her that it’ll be like you never died.” Bucky told them and walked over putting his hand on top of their shoulders. “You can trust us to make sure she will be taken care of. I swear on my life.”
Peter walked over from and back and kneeled in front of her taking both of her hands into his. Kissing each of her fingertips.
“I know you're in here somewhere Peter,” Tony yelled and walked around the apartment. Steve pointed to the cabinet and sat down on the couch. Tony walked over to the cabinet and opened it up. “Found ya!”
Tony took care of himself and only spent two hours in the lab at a time when he was feeling up to do something. He would force himself to watch movies with his daughter trying not to fall asleep. He would make sure every time they said goodbye he said ‘I love you’ to everyone they knew. His regret was to die and not say ‘I love you,’ before he dies.
Four things, you feel: “Floor.” Luna took a deep breath gripping her knees tighter. “Desktop, my cane, and shirt.”
Only a family and a few choice friends were told about their marriage. The family (and Pepper) only knew about the twins being created so then the paparazzi wouldn’t find them. They built a house twenty miles away from the compound. They were going to raise the children away from everything they have created in the world.
“But you pretend all the damn time!” Peter yelled and stood up. “I won’t do this without you! So, just fucking sign the papers!”
Gale’s heart sored for him. “I’m so sorry. I won’t say a word. I will try and get you home as soon as possible. Let’s get these papers signed. I will get Steve to sign them when he comes in.”
She nodded. “I-I’m gonna fix my vision… I don’t want to have someone babysit me every day. I didn’t want to do it because I couldn’t see my birth parents and now I never was able to my adopted parents. I have no one now. I can’t let Happy put his life on hold to watch me. I’ll go back to Hogwarts get my sight fixed then move back here and be able to be with you. I want you and May to come to move into the compound with me. In my apartment. Not quite now… but as time moves on.”
“So, we going to interrogate them?” Nat asked with a slight grin. This was always her favorite part of the job.
“Shit.” Tony looked around. “Where’s his staff? If they each have enough power in them they will react and stop long enough for us to get that cube.”
“We were in the music room. She was getting ready for the concert or something… then some guy that wanted to be a reindeer came in and started using his wand. He went to blast me, but Violet ran in front of me out of nowhere. I thought she went to hide. I didn’t think she was still there with me,” Peter told him and rubbed his hand. “Where’s Dad and the rest of the family?”
“How are you able to come back like this? And why don’t you have normal arms?” Bruce asked leaning forward.
“We are Earth’s mightiest heroes and we can’t even trust one another! They kicked our ass! It’s your fault they did this!”
She walked over to them slowly and sat down on the sand. “Papa, I’m sorry I left…” she leaned into him.
Rhodey and Tony got into there suits and began searching up and down the streets of Queens. All Tony could think about was his baby girl being alone in the big world with nothing. Clearly, something had to happen to her when she was staying with that man.
Steve sighed. “We sent her away to school to keep her safe, but now that we are moving out here we are going to bring her home. She came out as our daughter two years ago, but that didn’t go so well. We paid everyone off to keep her off the records. Even though we do adore her. She leaves tonight to go back. She will be back around Christmas. If you don’t want to tell her until she comes back it’s up to you.”
I just smiled and shook his hand, I was surprised not to see the diploma or the medal in his hand. Someone touched my shoulder and I turned my head to look at that person with surprise and emotion
I hear some shrieks of joy but he didn't care, he didn't want to see how one of his friends was happy with his father while one of them was away, he was going to take another pencil until the voice of one of his companions was heard.
Maria said happily as she hugged him by the neck and cried with joy, Steve bit his lower lip so as not to cry while stroking her baby's back-
She was very worried about not getting out of the line, although her mind wandered elsewhere, Harley had fallen asleep at night with her since Maria kept crying. At least with the story his brother had managed to forget his grief a little, he felt his eyes tired but how he liked to paint he entertained himself in what he did until the teacher spoke, wrinkled his brow, did not like to be disturbed when there was something important. In that aspect he looked like his daddy. He kept painting no matter what that woman standing in front of the class would say.
The shoulder turned to walk to where his secretary was to give him the two diplomas and the two medals for Peter's companions, I looked to my side and the boys raised my thumbs in support.
-I'm glad you're here Captain, Peter has been a little distracted lately but I know that now with his presence he will be able to rejoice again
-Quiet dad, you know that Maria misses him, we all do it but she affects him more for being the pop princess and you ... it will pass. Rest see you tomorrow, goodbye beautiful baby
Everyone shouted happily except Maria who kept painting, she knew that her daddy Tony had an important meeting and his pops ... his pops was far from her, he took a hand his left eye to rub it and not allow himself to cry, she was a big girl .
Yes, damn I missed him so much sometimes I felt that the air was missing when I stopped listening to his voice at the end of the video call. I was explaining the tactics plan when Pepper opened the meeting room door
-I called the teacher, Maria will be in an art workshop so you can surprise her -Nat said while hugging Buck by the waist and looking at Steve happily, the blond thanked him while the four walked to the car, they saw leaning on him to Clint who smiled when he saw them back greeting the three with a hug.
- They are going to continue doing it or I will accuse them with pops, and they know that he punishes worse than daddy. They don't want to hear a one hour speech about how to be a good brother, do they? -The little girl looked at her brothers with a tender innocence while Harley murmured "Little manipulator."
- You came back dad, you came back and complete! -Harley said while crying and I held him in my arms, I didn't think his reaction would be like that but I was glad it was still my baby and Tony. It was exciting that out of the corner of my eyes I saw how Bucky wiped his eyes and Nat smiled tenderly at his godson, Maria clapped for joy and Sam smiled happily, once again I could not stand my tears-
The scientific fair had begun for a long time, all the projects presented were already there and now only the winners were given the prizes, Peter, Harry and Mary Jane had conquered the first place and at that time they waited for their prize. Peter looked around and his smile faded, he had missed his parents so much at that time, the two always accompany them to the scientific fairs with their brothers, that day and none of them could. Instead Mary Jane had her mother present and Harry his father who looked at him proudly, MJ's mother tried to hold back tears of joy, sigh hoping that it will end quickly to go to Stark Industries and at least receive the hug of her father and at night his congratulations from his pops, he wanted everything to return to normal, he wanted his pops near him, theirs ...
He moved to the left to take off a teammate, sighed when he saw that he would have no other way out than to throw towards the goal since those of the opposing team made him a wall, begged Domino to have his luck and be able to make the goal, looked at his He then aimed the ball and threw it into the corner. The cheerleaders who supported them shouted with joy, Harley put an arm to his forehead, wiping away sweat, he would have responded with a flirtatious smile but now, he was tired, exhausted ... he was sad.
-It's Steve ...- And when he said that I felt that my heart was slowly stopping, the room was spinning and before anyone spoke or if someone said something I did not hear it since I had run away, take out my cell phone while swallowing, My throat was dry. I looked for Steve's number but he didn't answer me, I got desperate little by little, dodged one of my workers. Why were they all out of their places of work and looking at someone? I frowned and approached little by little, I dropped my cell phone when I came to the front of that crowd of people, there I stood in front of my eyes with a funny smile and his military uniform (which all this, he looked delicious) Steve Rogers, on one side and really funny were our children looking at me, not even I knew what my face was when I saw my husband there, my legs were shaking just like my lips. But I forced my brain to send the order to my walking legs, and when I did it I did it slowly to then run and throw myself into his arms by winding my legs to his hip, I searched his lips desperately to kiss him and when I could touch that My mouth shook from head to toe, my God had missed him so much and I knew that like me he had done it too since it was a desperate kiss, needed to show us the love we had and how we had missed each other, I felt the Salty kiss but I didn't care, it didn't matter that everyone was watching us if I felt we were both alone.
Clint, Nat, Bucky and Sam watched with tenderness and emotion that scene while Steve could not retain some tears trying to get out of his eyes, he was on his way home.
He turned on his heels before taking his backpack and purse, leaving the soldier with his words, on his way to the air zone where Rodhey and Carol were already waiting for him as well as Bucky and Sam who would travel with him since they needed a rest, Buck six months ago that I did not see Nat and Sam needed a vacation after a year of intense military campaigns, I greet Carol and Rodhey as the army protocol commanded and then smiled
-As every morning Potts, my children are little angels called chitauris, I do not know at what time Steve coaxed me to have children with him, now I am a mother, father, IronMan, Philanthropist, former playboy and head of SHIELD at the same time. -The businessman said with a touch of drama while Pepper laughed fun and handed him his coffee-
He said goodbye to both of them and then got on the plane with his comrades and best friends, when he sat sighing and looked at his wedding ring, he would soon be with them. With his happiness ...
-If my princess, I'm here, with you and I promise not to leave so soon and leave you so long ... I'm already coming home, my love
He was going to continue playing when the crazy shouts of the cheerleaders and some exclamations of astonishment from his companions were heard, he turned to see what was so much fuss behind his back, his mouth opened in surprise since he was walking near the opposite arch Captain America himself, Steve Rogers, his pops ...
He had physical education that day and although he did not like sports very much if he liked what football was. It was where they never bothered him for being a good player and apart from the fact that they always had physical education when cheerleading training, he could enrich his eyesight as Daddy Tony would say.
Peter mentioned with his eyes full of tears, his body reacted almost throwing himself over me and hugging me by the neck, I brought my hands behind his back to caress him
Harley and Peter sighed in relief, although their relief was unnecessary since at that time someone was naughty stroking the ass of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D and heir of Stark Industries.
"Cheer up, we have pops again to control Dad when he wants to make some crazy invention," Peter said as he cared for Maria in the head who played with her dolls, "and we won't have to play tea with Maria anymore."
-Don't stay there, Steve, we'll need you here too. Many children love and take advantage of the moment with Tony, I need another nephew.
I dried her tears as she smiled at him and placed her medal giving him a hug again, she was coming home.
-I love you, take care, yes? They're calling me, we'll talk tomorrow- Rogers sent them a kiss and cut off the communication while everyone said goodbye very happy, when the screen turned black everything returned to its normal rhythm, Maria squeezed her teddy bear, Harley frowned and Peter erased his smile.
“Eddie! Oh my God, what are you doing here?!” Peter asks, not even bothering to think about the fact that Spider-Man shouldn’t know Eddie. The jock just chuckles slightly before shaking his head.
FRIDAY explains just as Tony is figuring it out. He leans back in his seat for a bit and lets out a long sigh. Then he takes a look at the phone, and reaches out his hand to see if the documents have been downloaded yet.
“Stop being such a wise-ass,” Steve returned, pushing the chair forward to the door. JARVIS opened it up for him automatically, so Steve could push the chair into the elevator once it arrived.
It’s nothing too important, just administrative papers for school for his request at doing an internship; his hours for school, his papers to arrange transport there, and whatever else. Peter figures he might have a look at that later.
“DON’T YOU WALK AWAY!” Steve calls out, probably scrambling to his feet as he tries to join Tony in the kitchen. By the time his glass his filled again, Steve is standing right next to him again. Tony grins, pulling the glass towards his mouth and keeping his eyes averted from Steve.
Tony hesitates for a bit, just a few seconds, before his mind tells him that, once upon a time, he could tell Mary anything. She would never judge him, no matter what it was. He figures things wouldn’t have changed that much.
“I’m afraid we can only allow one person with him, otherwise it’ll be too crowded,” the third nurse says before she can get it. Tony nods, looking at May with wet eyes.
“So now you’re walking around with porn, is that it? Porn of you and your boyfriend? You two are disgusting,” she mutters out. It’s not too hard to pretend to be disgusted by it. Tony flips her off, putting the DVD back in his jacket. After that, Steve walks inside, looking oblivious to everything. Once he notices everybody looking at him, he frowns.
“Yaël!” Steve and Peter yelled at her in unison. They both blushed a bit, which would make them even a better father-son duo. Would that make Peter, like, her brother? Oh, man, these two men were taking over her mind.
“As long as we can ship your ass all the way to Switzerland tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.”
“I don’t know,” she said as she literally tried to wave away the problem. Wade would think she was acting way too butthurt if she’d tell him what was going on in her head. So, to change the subject, she asked him to repaint her roots. And as Wade has the concentration-width of a retired goldfish, he let the subject just pass like that, grabbed Yaël’s arm and pulled her behind him as he happily hopped to the store.
And then he figures he won’t be needing that. Because he’s a father, and a father would do anything to keep his kid alive. And Mary, being a mother, should be able to recognize that desperation.
“She’s fine,” he quickly assures him. “She’s confined to the compound, currently. Vision and Peter are keeping her company.” And to be honest, that’s her best-case scenario in any way. It was either this, or having her in custody, which Tony surely wouldn’t have wanted for her.
of privacy, no?” Tony complains. Pepper rolls her eyes before turning around and walking towards the door.
take the mask off? He designed it to make it easily breathable, but right now he feels like it’s choking him on the spot.
Tony eyes the goo on the ground, wondering where his checkbook went. Following Strange, he takes a good look at the building from the inside, having never been here before. It’s just like he would have imagined it being; full of nonsense.
Steve doesn’t need to talk. He’s going to say it otherwise. And it’s really the last thing Tony needs to hear now. If he says it, Tony is going to break for real.
He’s barely aware of another door opening, barely aware of the whisperings around him – though he can’t understand what they’re saying. He’s probably too tired to even question the shifting on the bed, of the two sudden hands against his head. A girl lets out a sad sob, tries to take a few deep breaths.
“For who?” Natasha asked. Steve looked back up at her, his blue eyes meeting the greens of hers. At that moment, the shape of her eyes, the shape of her face… it reminded him much of Pepper Potts. He let out a shaky breath.
“You need to tell me this, Parker; when I looked at the dormitories, I was happy. You want to know why?”
“Stop being so nervous, I’m not going to eat you,” Mr. Stark then says, jokingly. Peter laughs quickly before nodding again.
Peter’s cheeks redden again, and Yaël, too, seems to shuffle uncomfortably next to him. Yeah, that’s still going to be a bit of an issue…
“Medical from SHIELD?” he asked. Natasha hadn’t responded, instead pushed him onto the bed and marching towards his closet. She sighed when she took in the very few clothing he had in there. She seemed to find it absolutely ridiculous, or that was at least what he heard her mutter.
- Take care of pops, please come back soon Yes? We miss you too much but I'm taking care of everyone. -A young Peter spoke with a happy smile, he missed his father very much. In his arms was a little Johnny who babbled while looking at his caretaker.
-I love you guys, Maria remember to brush your teeth before bed but, when the last one is released and the mouse falls, it won't bring you anything. Harley don't make your father mad and stop disarming his suits. Peter, I hope you do very well at the science fair tomorrow, remember son that you are the best and always will be; Give a lot of kisses and pampering Johnny from me Yes? and Tony ...
Peter and Harley looked confused as the avengers held their laughter and Steve lowered his head in shame, when the children of the leaders realized they opened their eyes with surprise.
I started talking while I had all the avengers more present to Coulson, Hill and Carter who were the agents that would help us in the mission, sometimes the words were going to be admired as Johnny played with his stuffed dinosaur and why he remembered Steve , he should be in charge of this meeting and I sat admiring my husband with Johnny in my arms, as he frowned as he looked at the maps and fighting tactics, as his left eyebrow was raised when he heard any recommendation we were giving or how their shone when his gaze fell on Johnny and me ...
- It's Captain America! -Maria reacted by jumping a little in her seat while turning her head a little to see a man who would act as Captain America, but there in the room, looking at her with a smile and an infinite tenderness was her pops, Maria screamed with joy, rose from her seat quickly as some tears came down her face she ran into her father's arms, who raised her and hugged her when she reached his arms-
The first pose was with them having hands on their hips. The next one was Peter kissing Violet’s cheek while she blushed bright red. Everyone stopped what they were doing when screams filled the night's air.
With their lips against each other, he can hear Steve muttering against his just as much as he can feel it.
“Hello?” he asks carefully. There’s another grunt. Miles moves forward, gasping when he sees something red on the ground. At first his mind tells him that it’s blood, but then he notices that it moves. It’s a boot, a foot, something like that.
